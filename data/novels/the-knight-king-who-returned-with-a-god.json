      "content": "Chapter 1: You’re Stuck With Me\nThe first thing I saw after I was reincarnated in a fantasy world is a serene ceiling and candles illuminating the room instead of LED bulbs.\nThe clothes were woven from silk and brocade and judging by the dull wooden utensils, it’s clear that they’re far removed from Earth’s civilization.\nBut hey… it’s a fantasy world, so I guess I’m rich, right? It’s a nice reincarnation for an overworked poor orphan.\nThere was one thing that convinced me I was noble. It was my mother’s beauty.\n“My baby…….”\nMy biological mother’s dazzling smile as she looked at me. How could that face not be aristocratic? My future love life would be trouble-free.\n~Year 3~\nI’m out of the cradle and out of the room. The world outside was so big and huge, for a toddler.\n“Young master!”\nMona, my nanny, gasped and picked me up. And that was how my first adventure ended.\nI shouldn’t have dreamed of an adventure at this point.\nIf I had known that real adventures are 100% real and 100% muddy, I wouldn’t have gone through all that trouble.\n~Year 6~\nApparently, the house I was reincarnated into is one of the most famous in the kingdom, The Grand Duke of Dragonia.\nThe family was founded by a legendary knight who slayed an evil dragon and bathed in its blood. The family has produced four kings since the kingdom had an elected monarchy.\n~Year 8~\nI was expected to learn to wield a sword as the next knight of the kingdom.\nI was excited. A fantasy knight! Would I be able to draw a sword and put aura on it?\nThe man who would teach me was Sir Gordic, a Holy Knight sent from the royal palace, but who was he?\nHuh? Holy knight?\n~Year 10~\nIt hurts. My whole body feels like it’s going to break.\nI chose the knight’s path, and now I’m getting beaten up by Gordic the Macho every day.\nIt was nice to be a squire in the Grand Duke’s favor, but every day was spent learning to wield a sword and ride a horse.\nHoly knights…yeah, they’re like sword masters in fantasy.\nWhile the knights of this world are a bit different from my fantasy knights, the Holy Grail Knights are truly monsters that are far from human.\nHowever, in order to become a Holy Knight, you must complete quests through training, become a knight of the kingdom, earn prestige and honor, and drink holy water by being chosen by the Holy Grail?\nYou had to be strong, honorable, and faithful to become a Holy Knight, an Otherworldly Sword Master.\nDamn it… I’m not religious.\n~Year 14~\nEvery day is a pain.\nAside from the bone-crushing training there’s a sense of accomplishment, though, because I can feel myself growing stronger with each passing day. It was bearable.\nThe problem was discipline and study.\nI was a strong contender to be the next Grand Duke. Naturally, I had to learn everything there was to know about being a duke.\nHow to rule the people, how to carry out the law, the philosophical debates between justice and law, how to treat a lady, and even how to study the Bible.\nIn this world, there are many gods, and you pay tribute to them at their temples and do as they say.\nGods…how fantastical.\nBut me… I’m supposed to be recognized by the Goddess of Justice or something to be chosen for the Holy Grail?\n~Year 16~\nI was wandering the world now.\nWhat? Isn’t a 16-year-old a middle schooler? Coincidentally, I’m considered an adult in this world.\nThe first requirement to become a Holy Grail Knight is to leave your training, protect the people of the kingdom, and complete an honorable quest.\nTo fulfill that quest, I must find the goddess’s alter ego. How do I find it?\nJust go around the kingdom and do my best to honor her, and she’ll find you. I’ll be damned.\n~Year 17~\nToday I slaughtered some orcs. Sons of bitches, warlike brutes. They invade the kingdom’s borders on a random day and kill our people. If it weren’t for them, the kingdom would be a peaceful place.\nAlong the way, you cut down the orcs with Sir Gildus, Sir Antoine, and Gunnar the Animated Woodman, the guardian of the forest.\n“Thank you, knights, thank you!”\n“Tend to the wounded and set the woods straight. The sword of the kingdom and the favor of the goddess be with you.”\nI’m worried. The farmers have had a good year, and their taxes have kept the kingdom afloat, but the country has too many enemies.\nThere are too many non-humans around.\n~Year 20~\nI met a goddess.\nI’m not kidding. It was real. God was real.\nWasn’t religion supposed to be a way to enlighten and organize the ignorant?\nHeaven? Hall of Fame? Dinner with the gods? Weren’t they all myths?\nThe current king has been alive and ruling the kingdom for 110 years, but I thought he was a Holy Knight who did some kind of transmogrification trick.\nMy current master, Sir Gordic, was a 90-year-old Holy Knight.\n“Leon Dragonia, son of Archduke Wulfric Dragonia, I grant you a quest to prove your honor and faithfulness.”\n“Yes, by the command of the Goddess!”\nDuring my fourth year as an apprentice knight I have finally met the Goddess’s alter ego. Arianna is real!\nI’ve slain orcs, torn goblins apart, slayed hordes of evil wizards and defended the realm’s territory.\nIt wasn’t all bad. Rather, it was good. The ringing of my name, the accolades, the admiration and respect that came with each honor made me shrug.\nSir Gildus, son of Galbat the Warnight. Lord Antoine, Guardian of the Mines, and Gunnar the Tree Man, who was only two meters tall when I first saw him, but has since grown to be a five-meter Tree Giant.\nI have been recognized by the Holy Grail and made a Holy Knight.\n~Year 27~\nI am the youngest Warknight.\nI’ve decapitated an Orc Warlord and wiped out a savage barbaric tribe.\nThe orcs would come in hordes of 100,000 or 200,000 whenever they attacked.\nThe first thing I did when I became a Warknight, with the freedom to wage war and call my own knights, was to attack the orcs.\nI buried 700,000 of the damned green-skinned bastards, men, women, and children. It made my blood boil.\n~Year 35~\nThe honorable Fourteenth Lionheart King, living saint and demigod Argent Majesty Lionheart has died. He died in battle against a Great Demon summoned on the fringes of the Empire.\nOrcs are a pain in the ass, but now demons were running amok. Those damned Imperial mages and their inquisitive minds leading them astray in their study of the dark arts.\nThis is why people must believe in God and live a faithful life.\nIt is because of their inherent curiosity and their futile pursuit of truth that the Great Devil has sliced a hundred thousand people into pieces.\nApart from that, we needed to elect a Holy Knight to succeed King Lionheart, who died honorably while helping the nearly destroyed empire.\n“Holy Knight Leon Dragonia.”\n“Arianna.”\nThe Goddess herself descends and nominates me. Apparently, this is the first time in the kingdom’s history that the Goddess has directly chosen a Holy Knight.\nBeheading the Great Demon must have been a great honor.\nIt is an honorable path and a demanding position, but I cannot let my knights and people down.\nI am now Archduke of Dragonia and King of the Lionheart Kingdom.\nI was implanted with the heart of a lion, a holy relic bestowed by the Goddess, swore to protect the Grail, and took up the holy sword and lance to slay the enemies of my kingdom.\n~Year 80~\nMuch has happened in the meantime.\nThere have been three great battles against the orcs, and a strange curly goblin who became a great demon.\nI could have ripped its guts out, but I was unlucky and it escaped through the Demon Gate.\n“Your Majesty, the Imperial School of Black Magic is said to be conducting experiments again!”\nAre they insane? Imperial bastards, what is wrong with them these days?\nThe Empire’s self-indulgence and distrust have reached a peak lately.\nThe annual pilgrimage to the Great Hall of Gods has been canceled, and a bunch of stupid theocratic independents have taken up residence.\nIt’s all the fault of the pagan bastards from the north. We didn’t have enough soldiers, so we took in barbarians and their beliefs.\nIn the Lionheart Kingdom, they’ll live their entire lives as lowly serfs and die like pigs, but they’re treated like people.\nI feel like I’m watching a group of trolls in a group task.\n~Year 98~\nThe Imperials have gotten their act together!\nThe Emperor’s bastard son, performing the secret sacrificial rituals of the Evil Cult because he didn’t want to die, has summoned a Chaos Lord to the Imperial capital!\nThe young cub, barely seventy years old, wanted to live forever, so he killed three million people in the capital!\n“Ha…….”\nI summoned the knights, holding the holy sword that was still oiled by last year’s killed orcs blood.\n~Year 121~\nThe world is ending.\nI have done my best, I slayed demons on behalf of Arianna, the goddess of justice, and sent priests of Demera, the goddess of fertility, to rebuild the farmlands.\nHeto, the god of iron and blacksmithing, provided armor and swords for the Holy Knights, and Petos, the god of war and flame, descended upon me to burn the ashes of the battlefield.\nIn the twenty-third year of the Divine War, a war that began because of the imperials, and slowly led to the destruction of the world.\n“Lord Leon.”\n“Lord Antoine.”\nThe appearance of my arch-rival remained youthful.\nAs I spoke, by the grace of the Goddess, I looked no different than I had a century ago.\n“Be proud, Antoine. Your father has died an honorable death and gone to the feast of the gods.”\n“Yes…….”\nI see the soldiers and knights looking at me, comforting the son of a dead father. The final battle… no, the final resistance was starting as I heard the thudding of the earth as the enemy marches on, and the mixed emotions in my people’s eyes.\nHorror, fear, helplessness, despair.\nAlas, Goddess.\nMaster of the Grail, who has given this lackluster creature a lion’s heart, and whose holy sword is lit with a brilliant fire here are thy lambs trembling with fear.\nWomen soothe their weeping children and swallow their tears, young men clutch the dying embers of war in their hands and knights try to leave seeds of hope in the blood-soaked wilderness.\nBut not me, lord of the holy sword, lance, and chalice.\nI know that I will not be able to stop the evil that stretches beyond the horizon.\nGoddess…My Goddess…What shall this foolish knight do?\n“Do as thou wilt.”\n“…….”\n“My knight. My dear, honorable knight. Your goddess will be with you to the end.”\nThe Goddess is with me.\nI will indeed meet my end, and it will be an honorable one.\n“For the Goddess, for honor and for Lionheart!”\nThat winter in my 121st year we fought against the ten million demons that infested the earth.\nBarbarian serfs were expended as meat shields, and soldiers armed with spears and shields and knights of glory fell with honor.\nHoly Knights ascended one by one, slaying demons until their last breath.\nOnly I, the agent of the pantheon, chosen by all the gods slaughtered demons alone to the end.\nI tore apart countless Demon Lords and Archdemons and shone the divinity of the Holy Knights upon them.\n~Year 217~\nWinter is not yet over.\n~ Year 256~\nThe last remaining Demon Gate was destroyed and hundreds of thousands of demons looked at me with desperation in their eyes as they lost their escape route.\n“Lowly demons! You are now trapped in this world with me, and I will annihilate every last one of you!”\nI am not trapped! You’re trapped with me, you fucking things!\n~ Year 300~\n“Holy shit, I’ve never seen a gate like this before, where the hell am I?”\n“Relax, Ha-ri, it’s been 13 years since we’ve seen an Unmeasurable Gate. We don’t know what we’ll find.”\n“I know… but what is there in this world that can’t be measured?”\n“I don’t know…Isn’t there some kind of high-level demon?”\n“Don’t say such horrible things.”\nI was only 300 years old when I encountered Earthlings.\nTL Note: I’ll just add this here so that readers won’t get confused.\nDemon Ranks:\n-Lesser Demons/ Low-level demons\n-Mid-level demons\n-Greater Demons/ High-level demons\n-Archdemons\n-Demon Lord (Lord of Chaos is the title of a lord)",

      "content": "Chapter 2: The Black Gate\nA gate opened in the middle of Seoul but this in itself is not a rare occurrence.\nSince Jamsil Gate, Namyangju Gate, Songdo Gate, and others opened across the district 30 years ago, gates in the middle of the city have become commonplace.\nThe problem is the grade of the gate.\n“Black…….”\nAn “out of specification” rating that is not even considered by the World Hunter Association’s official measurement scale.\nSince it is measured by the amount of energy inside the gate, it boasts a 99.9% hit rate.\nThe Korean Hunter Association was prepared for this. They asked the World Hunter Association for support and asked the country’s leading hunter guilds to enter the gate.\n“Fucking assholes… This is the only time they’re busy.”\n“It’s not the first time the Hunter Guilds have done this.”\nHunter Han Ha-ri, a member of the Hunter Association, made an expression of disbelief at the words of Kim Jin-soo.\nA Black Gate had appeared after 13 years but the big domestic guilds refused to enter and took a wait-and-see approach.\nNo wonder. The scarlet color of the A-ranked gate alone would cause countless casualties. But a black, non-standard gate that was beyond S-grade?\nNone of the major guilds wanted to consume their precious power on a gate with an unmeasurable risk.\nIn the end, the government-affiliated Hunter’s Association was forced to take matters into their own hands.\nThe vanguard would enter first, assess the danger, and return with as much information as possible to distribute to the larger guilds.\nThis was the standard method, as it gave players a huge advantage if they had the right information. The problem is the vanguard, which must enter without any prior information.\n“Ha-ri…are you okay?”\nChief Kim looked worriedly at Ha-ri, who had followed him as the Hunter Association’s vanguard.\nIt was a dangerous reconnaissance mission and the association was so determined that they would only select applicants and leave them with a suicide note.\nIt was a shame that a promising new member of the Association, barely twenty years old, would be sent to such a place.\n“It’s okay, I’m the only A-class hunter among the applicants, we should have at least one decent fighter.”\n“Even so…….”\nClass A Hunters are definitely a big deal. On top of that, the Hunter Association didn’t even have any Class A Hunters since hunters that talented would have joined the sinful guilds.\n“For the safety of the citizens and the well-being of the country! Isn’t that the motto of our association?”\n“……silly girl.”\nShe’s one of the Association’s few up-and-comers.\nOn modern Earth, where the big guilds have siphoned off talent, Hunters who want to become state employees are usually D-or C-class.\nShe was barely a B-class.\nAn A-class hunter prospect who applied to join such an association as soon as he graduated from the academy. If she was trained well, she could become the only S-class Hunter outside of the Association’s president.\nPart of him wanted to tell her to go back for the sake of her future, but the strength of the vanguard is too low to send her back as it is.\nThis is the first Black Gate in 13 years. It was a selection mission that required S-class hunters, not A-class hunters, and yet there was only one A-class Hunter, Ha-ri.\n“Huh… Let’s hope we make it back alive.”\n-We’re going in, everyone, get ready!\n* * * *\n“Hmm… a field gate.”\nThe inside of the gate was a mess.\nSome of the gates were ravaged, as if they had been destroyed, but the black gate the Association vanguard entered was beyond their imagination.\nFirst, the sky turned crimson but the crimson color of the sky was not the color of the setting sun. It was an eerie red, as if the sky had been turned upside down.\nThere wasn’t a blade of grass on the ground. The ground is so barren and desolate that you wonder if this place ever really had life.\n“My God, I’ve never seen a gate like this before. Where the hell are we?”\n“Relax, Ha-ri. An Unmeasurable Gate hasn’t been opened in 13 years so we don’t know what we’ll find.”\n“I know… but what is there in this world that can’t be measured?”\n“I don’t know… Isn’t there some kind of high-level demon?”\n“Don’t be so negative.”\nIt was then that a message flew to Ha-ri and the other Hunters from the Association.\n[Gate Mission]\nA mission system window that was created after Gates appeared in the world and Hunters awakened their magic.\nIt is a valuable system that informs Hunters who enter a Gate of the minimum information about the Gate and the goal of clearing it.\n“Chief….”\n“Fuck…….”\nHowever, the Hunters who checked the system window had pale complexions and shivered.\n[Hunt all demons]\nDemons remaining: 117 / ????????\n“Demons…….”\nA race that occasionally appeared in high-grade gates among the countless gates.\nSix years ago, a high-level demon, Kanbala, appeared at the Vermilion Grade Gate and killed a Korean S-class Hunter, Ko Jin-hyuk.\nThe appearance of the Great Demon Skazakari or a monarch-level demon in China 22 years ago always caused a terrible disaster.\n“Fuck! Fuck! We have to get out now!”\n“Chief!”\nAt the worst possible moment, even the stalwart Chief Kim was thrown into a panic.\nThis gate was a demon gate among many gates.\n“Those bastards won’t die even if we kill them!”\nEven if demons are killed they resurrect.\nThe Great Demon Skazakari, which emerged from the Shanghai Demon Gate in China 22 years ago, has been slain more than five times but Demon Gates don’t disappear, and every four years they resurface to cause a dungeon break.\n“Calm down, Chief. It’s only 117 demons, and we might be able to finish it off surprisingly easily.”\n“That’s the problem! It’s only 117 demons, and they’re rated black! That means there are at least some major demons!”\nThe rating of a dungeon is determined by the amount of energy in it.\nWith only 117 demons, a black rating meant that every single one of them was terrifyingly powerful.\nWorst of all, if it was a Great Demon Gate, the dungeon would never close, like the Shanghai Demon Gate.\nThat would be terrible. Right now, Shanghai alone has become a ghost town because of that Demon Gate.\n“Let’s retreat! We have to let the association know that it’s a Demon Gate!”\nThere’s nothing they can do with a vanguard of less than 20 people so the party leader, Chief Kim, decided to retreat.\n“Chief, look over there!”\nA Hunter pointed in the direction. There, a large, masked demon stared down at the Hunters.\n“Holy shit…Great Sword!”\nGreat Sword, a lesser demon and a minor race demon of about 1.5 meters with a sword larger than my own body. However, just because it’s a low-level demon doesn’t mean you should let your guard down. Even among demons, the Great Sword has a particularly powerful attack.\nAs its name suggests, the human body would bleed uncontrollably if it was struck by the Great Sword.\n“Argh……”\nAnd there wasn’t just one Great Sword.\nOne Great Sword after another, plus the other demons, their number already exceeding a hundred appeared.\n“Damn, they’re already causing dungeon breaks?”\nEvery gate has a grace period until the mission is completed. But as soon as this gate opened, this happens?\n-Gate! It’s a gate!\n-We can live!\n-Run, run, run!\nThe demons let out a grotesque cheer. The Hunters gasped and gripped their weapons as the demons rushed toward them.\n“Hey, everybody, stay with me! We can’t let the demons get through the gate! They can hide as soon as they get to Earth!”\nDemons can disguise themselves as humans or hide in their shadows.\nAll it took was one demon to slip through and something terrible would happen, which is why the Demon Gate must be closed at all costs.\n“Form up, I’ll take the lead!”\n“Ha-ri!”\nDespite Chief Kim’s urging, Ha-ri drew her sword at the front of the line.\nShe wasn’t a tank, and it would be suicidal for her to take the lead, but she was needed now to encourage the panicked Hunters.\n-Run! Run!\n-I want to live! I don’t want to be annihilated!\nThe demons screamed in an unintelligible language as they charged. The first to come to the forefront were the hellhounds, a quadrupedal beast, the lowest of demons, but faster than an automobile. They rushed toward Ha-ri, gasping for breath.\n-Kaaaaaaaaaah!\nThe hellhounds leapt. Ha-ri imbued her sword with magic and slashed at the hellhounds.\nThe enchanted sword sliced through their hides with ease, and the hellhounds writhed in agony.\n“Good, good start!\nShe had killed four in one fell swoop and just as she was hoping her efforts would boost their morale, the gutted hellhounds began to act strangely.\n“What?”\nHellhounds that were mortally wounded ran upright, dripping with blood, as if they were trying to enter the gate somehow.\n“Stop them!”\nBut they were blocked by the Hunters.\nThe Hellhounds weren’t the only ones; the Great Swords bumped into the Hunters in front of them and crawled toward the gate, barely responding.\n-Coming! He’s coming!\n-He’s coming! He’s coming!\n-No! Run! Over the gate!\n“What, what?”\n“Have these guys been drugged…….?”\nThe demons were defeated with ease, but Ha-ri and the other Hunters couldn’t help but feel a sense of déjà vu.\nEven though they know they’ll be resurrected after a while, why are they so reckless? As if they were ‘running away’.\n“Ha-ri, dodge!”\nThat’s when something hit the ground with a bang. Something overwhelming that swept across the terrain with only the aftermath of a shockwave, sweeping everyone away, including Ha-ri.\n“What…?”\nHa-ri scrambles to the ground, her mind racing as she realizes what has happened.\n“What the hell…….”\nSomething had fallen, and Ha-ri recognized it instantly.\n“Ah…….”\nSomething huge came into view as a torn wing, an axe far beyond human size with rotten skin and a gaze that she didn’t want to see, even in her dreams appeared.\n“Ahhh…….”\nAn Archdemon, the nightmare of the Demon Gate that tore even S-class Hunters alive.\n“Move aside, lesser ones, before I kill you all!”\nThe demon overwhelmed the Hunters with a creepy sonic boom and the Hunters dared not move, stifled by the aura he emitted.\n“Off, it’s over.”\nUnmoving legs and rushing breaths, despair and fear overwhelmed them all.\n“Oh, no. If he crosses over to Earth…….”\nIt has to be stopped. If a monster like that causes a dungeon break in the middle of Seoul… ten million citizens will be in danger!\n“No.”\nHa-ri raised her sword. She dragged her unmoving legs forcibly and stood in the face of irresistible despair.\n“A lowly human being…!”\nThe Archdemon clicked his tongue at the sight of Ha-ri before him, but strangely enough, the only emotion she felt was urgency.\n“Move, bug!”\nHe throws a light blow, literally shooing the bug away but Ha-ri focused all of her magic to block the blow and…….\n“Huh?!”\nWith a single blow, she bounced all the way to the gate.\n“Black…!”\nThe ground, which had become a weapon in itself, slashed at Ha-ri’s body, and she realized with a single blow that she stood no chance against the Archdemon.\n“Hmph…….”\nAs the dying embers flickered precariously, a figure stopped in front of her. At first, she thought it was Chief Kim, but then she realized it was the Association’s Hunters, immobilized by the power of the Archdemon.\nDirector Kim, a veteran, was also frozen in place as the Archdemon’s head rolled on the ground.\n“Huh?”\nRolling in front of her right now…is that the head of the Archdemon that had just destroyed her?\n“No, Lionheart King! No! No!”\nThe Archdemon screams in agony as his body burns from the cut but he wasn’t the only one, the demons around him were also shivering in fear.\n“Huh?”\nThe Archdemon’s appearance was strange. In the recorded footage, the Archdemon was spitting out curses against humanity, heralding its resurrection, as it always did.\nBut what about the one in front of her?\n“No! No! The holy law…! My soul… is… extinguished!”\nIt screams and struggles desperately, as if it’s actually facing death.\n“Ah…….”\nI get it.\nThe demons aren’t here to cause a dungeon break. They were rushing the gate in a desperate attempt to survive… to get away from someone.\nWho? Who could make those brutal demons, those infinitely resurrecting demons, tremble?\n“This is the last of you.”\nIt was a naked man.\nAm I seeing things?\nA man who wore nothing but his bare body and the hilt of a worn longsword. And yet, the light from his halo is graciously holy and brilliant.\n“Rise, brave one.”\nThe words are archaic, almost dignified, coming from the mouth of a madman.\nThe tone, the demeanor, the posture…everything overrode the man’s attire.\nJust hearing the voice rekindled the dying embers.\n“Ha, ha, ha…….”\nWhat the hell is this? What the hell is the man in front of me…….?\n“Now is not the time to go down… stand up and fight back.”\nJust hearing his voice made me feel empowered as a surge of energy and vitality lifted my injured body.\n“You… who are you?”\nIn response to Ha-ri’s question, the brilliant blonde man spoke with a stern expression.\n“I am the Lionheart King, King of the Holy Knights and agent of the Will of the Pantheon. I am Leon Dragonia Lionheart.”\nThe man raised his sword.\n[All the demons were slain]\nDemons remaining: 0 / ????????",

      "content": "Chapter 3: The Lionheart King\nChief Kim Jin-soo, of the Korean Hunter Association, returned home with a huge accomplishment, the closing of the Black Grade Gate, only to be met with unwelcome scrutiny and long meetings.\n“Ha-ri, what do you think?”\nIn the lobby outside the interrogation room Han Ha-ri’s exhaustion was evident.\n“They don’t seem to believe me.”\n“Of course they don’t.”\nThe Black Gate was cleared by a vanguard that was half expected to die. Moreover, the gate was a notorious demon gate, and an Archdemon had appeared? They should have been wiped out, not half dead.\nKim’s immediate supervisor thought to himself.\n-Are these assholes organized now?\nBut when all the Hunters in the vanguard spoke in unison, their eyes naturally turned to a man.\n“What is your name?”\nA brilliant blonde man seen through a magic mirror. A powerhouse who had defeated the Archdemon in a single blow and killed all the demons.\nMeasured as an S-class Hunter at the very least, his identity was…….\n“A survivor… right?”\n“Yes, an otherworldly survivor.”\nThere were some beings who survived beyond the Gate.\nThe Gates that had popped up around the world over the past thirty years had something in common. They all had one theme: a world that had fallen, or was in the process of falling.\nGovernments around the world speculated that the gates were connected to the records of a lost world, or a post-apocalyptic world, and on rare occasions, survivors would cross over.\nNot just humans, but elves, dwarves, and other fantasy races.\nPeople started calling those who crossed over from the otherworld ‘survivors’.\n“But it was a Black Grade Gate, is it possible for a person to survive there?”\n“He’s actually right in front of us.”\nGiven his extraordinary strength, it doesn’t seem impossible.\nIt’s also odd that they’re arguing about common sense after the apparition of the gates.\nThirty years ago there was a cataclysm with monsters bursting out of cracks they’d never seen before.\nMore than half of humanity has died, the land has been poisoned, and cities have been destroyed.\nLuckily, the mana-blessed beings commonly referred to as the Awakened…Hunters, appeared, and humanity survived, but there was still so much they didn’t know about the Gate.\n“Survivors…….”\nSurvivors, unlike the awakened Hunters, were innate mana users, and having survived the fallen world, many of them were as strong as or stronger than the Hunters.\nHowever, they also have a high opinion of themselves, and their culture and lifestyle are vastly different, making it difficult for them to integrate into the modern world.\nThe people of the XXth Empire, the Sages of the Forest, and the Masters of the Underground Dungeons must have lived a life completely alien to modern civilization.\nTherefore, the government has a policy of treating the survivors with the utmost respect and accommodating their wishes.\n“We have to bring him in, he’s…he’s a very powerful man.”\n“Yes… unconditionally.”\nEven an A-ranked Hunter would have to risk his life against an Archdemon.\nAside from the Chaos Lords, the Archdemons are the strongest monsters but Leon defeated one in a single blow.\nThere have been Hunters who have repelled them, but none who have overwhelmed them.\nEven the survivors were afraid of the Archdemons and could not overpower them like Leon.\nRegardless of their strength, survivors have emerged from all over the world, many from cultures completely alien to Earth.\nAt least royalty, judging by the way he called himself investigators should proceed with caution.\n“I think we might be able to talk to him.”\n“You have reason to believe that?”\n“Because I sensed it in his voice. He seems…nice.”\nHa-ri hadn’t forgotten the warm tone in the man’s voice as he pulled her to her feet.\nA man like that, who looked at the courageous with a praising and compassionate gaze… how could he not be good──\n“You lowly thing, how dare you sully the name of the glorious Lionheart!”\nBoom!\nThe desk collapses with a single punch and the shockwave shatters the reinforced glass that protects against even monster attacks.\nBeyond the shattered magic mirror, a brilliant blond man bellowed at the investigator.\n“I thought you said you were stuck in…….”\n“Cultural differences?”\n* * * *\nLeon felt a sense of strangeness when he returned to Earth after 300 years.\nHe had been a poor orphan who had died of overwork in his twenties.\nAfter his reincarnation, he had been a knight and king of a kingdom for more than 100 years, and he had hunted demons for 200 years after the demons invaded the world.\nThat was over 300 years ago, so he was lucky to have even a faint memory of it.\nThe problem is, even if he compared that faint memory, the Earth is a different place now.\n“Hello, Leon Dragonia…Lionheart?”\n“Hmm…….”\nThey called him a survivor, which meant there were others like him.\n‘It wouldn’t do any good to reveal that I’m from Earth.’\nBeing from Earth, while it might make for an unusual resume, didn’t do him any favors.\nAfter all, wouldn’t a 300-year-old knight-king from another world be much better than a young man in his 20s who had just died of overwork?\nAfter all, he had been a knight and a king for so long.\n“Call me Your Majesty. Commoner.”\n“Yes? Ah, yes, yes…! Your Majesty!”\nThe investigator bowed and complied with Leon’s insistence. Hmm, either the investigator was a gentleman, or the government was taking a cautious approach to the survivors.\n“You made contact with our Hunters in that…Black Gate… uh, Your Majesty’s world, and slayed all those… demons?”\n“Yes.”\nThe demons he had slain last night were the last demonic energy he could feel in the world. They had been marked by Arianna, the Goddess of Light, with the last of her power.\n“I forgot.”\n“What?”\n“This king has upheld the honor of knighthood by destroying the demons, and I hereby appoint you as my temporary scribe to record this honorable event.”\n“Uh…yeah…yeah…yeah……….”\nThe investigator, looking at him like he was half-crazy, muttered ~huh culture difference~ as he scribbled down Leon’s notes.\n“By the way, doesn’t this place have any etiquette for serving guests?”\nIn other words, it’s a more elegant way of asking for a meal.\n“I’m sorry, I’ll have your meal ready in a moment!”\nThe investigator hurried out the door and ordered a decent takeout meal from his men.\nBefore the food arrived, Leon asked the investigator a question.\n“You, commoner, you shall reveal to me the information of this world. What world is this?”\nLeon asks him, even though he knows about Earth. What he wants is not the Earth he knew, but the Earth after he disappeared.\nWhat the hell happened to the Earth of the 21st century?\n“Oh, right, let me explain.”\nThe cataclysm of thirty years ago, the Gates and the dungeon breaks.\nDemon Gate, the Hunter’s Association… Leon felt that the catastrophes that had struck Earth were similar to those that had struck the Lionheart Kingdom and the other world.\n‘A little different.’\nIn his kingdom, the Demon Gates opened immediately since imperial wizards had made a pact with the demons to open the gates.\nCountless species of demons poured out of them, and one by one, the nations fell but Earth was different.\nEarth was flooded with gates, but they were not invaded by demon gates in the same manner as the other world.\nEach gate had a concept, and upon entering the gate, there was a system window called Clear Mission As if testing the planet and strengthening it step by step.\nWhile Earth saw the existence of the gates as a disaster, Leon saw it as a testing and strengthening process.\n“And there are other beings like me?”\nSurvivors also known as otherworlders from beyond the Gate.\nHe wondered if they were from Earth like he was, but he was certain that none of them had identified themselves as such.\n“The meal is ready, Your Majesty!”\nAn investigator brought the food and Leon’s eyes widened at the sight of it.\nA thick soup, salt and pepper in a whitish broth and kimchi!\nFor a man who had just finished labor on Earth, seolleongtang(ox bone soup) was like soul food.\nThe broth made from the bones of a cow, salt and pepper added at his discretion, airy white rice, and cabbage kimchi!\n‘No… no.’\nBut Leon swallowed the saliva that was pooling in his throat. He reminded himself of his position, even though he hadn’t tasted seolleongtang and kimchi in 300 years.\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart, otherworldly royalty, gent of the gods, guardian of the Holy Grail and master of the holy sword and holy spear.\nHow could he possibly be interested in the soul food of the common people?\nSipping broth and munching on somen noodles is more like royalty!\n“What kind of food is this?”\n“It’s a dish called seolleongtang, Your Majesty. It’s the soul food of the common people──”\nLeon slammed the desk as if he had been caught red-handed, then stood up and shouted.\n“You lowly thing, how dare you defile the glorious name of Lionheart!”\n“Yes? Yes?”\nThe poor investigator shook his head in disbelief, trembling at Leon’s overbearing presence.\n“How can royalty be served commoners’ food, and how does your kingdom, the Republic of Korea, treat the royalty of another country like that!”\n“Oh, no, not that…….”\nMr. Park Jong-pal, a 42-year-old investigator, having lived his entire life in the free Republic of Korea, should know how to treat royalty.\n“Why don’t you get out of here, you lowlife?”\nLeon chased the investigator away with a shout, and read the common knowledge of Earth that he left behind.\nDuring the Three Hundred Years’ War Leon Dragonia Lionheart had slain Chaos Lord Malus, Twenty-Three Archdemons, and millions of demons.\nHe was a demigod, the Guardian of the Grail, an agent of the pantheon, the lion-hearted king with the heart of a lion, a living saint and wielder of the Holy Sword and Holy Lance and also the first knight of Arianna, goddess of light and justice.\nFinally, the former returnee from Earth, who had returned to Earth after a 300-year absence, thought to himself.\n‘This is what happens when you don’t have the right faith.’\nIt was the duty of royalty to enlighten the foolish commoners.",

      "content": "Chapter 4: Survivor\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart, the third survivor of the Black Gate in thirteen years, has left the Hunter’s Association and the government in a dilemma.\nSurvivors are extremely rare otherworlders from beyond the Gate. They live in different cultures and environments, some of which are oppressive or hostile to Earthlings.\nThere are war heroes sealed in ice walls, and vampires who live for eternity and also descendants of dragons and dwarves who dug underground tunnels and defended fortresses.\nNot all of them were easy opponents, and each had their own stubbornness, but they tended to be content to accept that their world had ended and to be treated as survivors.\nGovernments’ policies toward survivors are the same.\nBring them in somehow. If they can’t join the government, resettle them within the country.\nAs survivors of a destroyed world, many were highly skilled in combat, and all had something special to offer.\nOf course, not all survivors were accepted. Some of the survivors had values that were unacceptable to the current human civilization.\nThe newest survivor among them, Leon was the type of person they didn’t really know how to deal with.\n“What do we do, do we learn court etiquette or something?”\n“Uhm…I’ve seen some historical dramas…….”\nKim Jin-soo and Han Ha-ri, looked at the survivor and benefactor of their rescue with a confused expression.\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart claims to be the king of the Lionheart Kingdom and an agent of the gods, a demigod, and an honorable knight.\nHe appears to be a strictly hierarchical figure, as he speaks and acts like a noble.\nHe refuses to eat seolleongtang and kimchi, saying they are commoners’ food. Although he was briefly interested in jjajangmyeon he refused to eat it, saying it was a lowly dish with ugly soup splashes.\nThey suggested chicken, but he also refused because it’s eaten with the hands.\n“He’s like a real noble….”\n“Yeah.”\nHe rejected Earth’s food as the food of the common people just by looking at it. As a result, food had to be shipped in from the finest restaurants in the vicinity.\n“Ha-ri… you go first.”\n“Me? I don’t know etiquette.”\n“But he seems to like you a bit. He even complimented you.”\n“All he said was that I was brave…!”\nHan Ha-ri was brought in to deal with this demanding survivor because of the favorable attention she received from Leon in the gate.\n“Ugh…….”\nHa-ri cautiously approaches Leon, who is gracefully slicing the finest T-bone steak and sipping a ’93 red wine.\n“Your Majesty, Your Majesty…May I join you while you dine?”\n“The swordsman of the hour, sit down.”\nAfter not being immediately ejected Ha-ri sighed softly and clenched her fist against the magic mirror for a moment.\nShe was sure her colleagues on the other side were cheering her on.\n“Your Majesty, how do you like your meal?”\n“Not bad. The chef put a lot of work into it.”\n“I’m so glad you liked it. Ah…We committed a mortal sin by serving you dishonorable food…”\n“I think you misunderstood.”\n“What I’ve been pointing out to you is the way you’ve been treating this king.”\n“And what does Your Majesty mean by that?”\n“When royalty meets with representatives of other nations, they should be treated with dignity. It’s part of your nation’s character.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Commoners eat as much food as they can carry. They are not so spoiled as to withhold food on the battlefield. But when you stand in front of your men, representing the will of the state, you are expected to show them the proper honor.”\nIn other words, the food wasn’t the reason for his behavior.\nHa-ri honestly wonders if he shouldn’t just eat it, but when she thought about it he was right, their country wouldn’t serve McDonald’s Big Macs to a visiting head of state.\n“I see. I apologize for my rudeness due to my short learning curve………….”\n“Never mind. By the way, what was your name again?”\n“Yes, yes…Han Ha-ri.”\nLeon watched as Ha-ri mimicked the clumsy historical drama’s behavior and didn’t tell her to relax. After all, royalty doesn’t take kindly to commoners.\n“I have heard stories of this world.”\n“Ah….”\nDespite his frustration with the investigators, Leon was diligent in gathering information about this world.\nThe investigators tried to explain as much as they could about the planet and its situation, so Leon had some information.\n“Apparently, this place is under some sort of invasion. Gates also appeared in my world too.”\n“Is that so?”\nGates were a common thread in the survivors’ eyewitness accounts.\n“Demons, those particular creatures, also haunt this planet, don’t they?”\n“Yes… they do.”\nHa-ri had one mission. First, to get him into the Hunter’s Association, which is part of the Korean government and the next best thing was to somehow integrate him into this country called Korea.\nThe appearance of a survivor always attracts the attention of governments and they’ll do anything to integrate him into their ranks.\nIn the 21st century, scouting for survivors is at the center of international espionage.\nLeon’s value as a survivor goes without saying and his combat prowess was already proven by several Association employees.\nThe problem is his insistence on a high status system and his idiosyncrasies, but he’s not that incomprehensible when you actually talk to him. Above all──\n‘This person has a strong sense of their own worth.’\nAdopting a high-pressure posture with a stranger from another world is a sign of confidence.\nAmong the survivors, there was a tendency to bend to a certain extent to deal with the nations.\nThey can’t defeat a nation as a single person and they know instinctively that there’s no good in turning the nation against them. But this man, Leon, is the epitome of pride and self-respect.\nHe boldly demands what he doesn’t know and insists that what he needs be given to him immediately and since he’s the last of the noble class, so he’s bound to be imposing in his dealings with everyone.\n“I beg your pardon, Your Majesty, but if it pleases you, the government of the Republic of Korea will accept your position.”\n“What does that mean?”\nHa-ri slowly laid out the options for him.\nBecome a hunter for the country or settle down and find another path.\nEither way, the Society would provide support for the survivor, especially if he became a Hunter for the country, emphasizing that the support would be enormous.\nThe higher-ups in the organization don’t know about Leon’s value yet but once they do, they’ll be happy to bring him to Korea.\n“This place is being invaded by evil races and as a honorable knight I must fight back. As long as I am settled in your world, I’m obligated to go to the battlefield.”\n“I see!”\nHa-ri’s face brightened. He had more sense than I thought, didn’t he?\nMany of the survivors had refused to enter the gates, either because of the demons or because of the gate. They said they had no obligation to get involved in another world’s fight. Yet they took every cent of the survivor resettlement money they could get.\nAt least this one didn’t seem to be that unscrupulous.\n“Then, if you join our hunter’s association──”\n“No. A king cannot enter in the army of another king.”\nHuh? What does that mean?\nHa-ri looked puzzled.\nIn his own mind, Leon didn’t think it was in his best interest to join the government. But if he was saying that, didn’t that mean he would also refuse to join another Hunter’s Guild?\n“I’ll establish a new Order of Knights in this world.”\nHa-ri could only nod at Leon’s ambitious declaration.\n* * * *\n“This is a weird situation.”\nSynthesizing Leon’s story, Kim Jin-soo scratched his head. Still, Ha-ri had a positive assessment.\n“Not bad, isn’t it? At least he’s willing to fight.”\n“Yeah, but he doesn’t look like he’s trying to leave the country.”\nSurvivors in Leon’s condition are rare, even among the entire survivor population.\nHe’s strong enough and willing to enter the gates, and he’s not hostile to the current world.\nBeing a human in a caste system is a flaw, but it doesn’t mean he’s acting out of character.\n“Still, I was appalled when he said he had to meet the president.”\n“Uh… You didn’t agree, did you?”\n“I didn’t want to cross swords with him since he can put his sword into subspace and summon it at will.”\n“He doesn’t even have a subspace pouch, so how does that work?”\nIf some random survivor swings a sword at the President… it would be a national disaster.\n“What are you going to do?”\n“We’ll support him as much as we can.”\nThat was the conclusion of the association’s meeting.\nBuy his favor and help him settle in the country as much as possible. For them, it was worth it, even if it meant an astronomical budget.\n“In Korea, the government is too weak…….”\n“It’s all because of the big guilds who only care about money and power.”\nKorea’s deep-rooted ills were still making the country sick.\n“By the way, before we entered the Black Gate, hasn’t there been a Scarlet Gate recently, up in the Hunan Plains?”\n“Yes, the Firebird Guild picked it up.”\n“I hope it goes well…if something happens over there, we’re in trouble.”\nAfter the Cataclysm, the world was ravaged by dungeon breaks everywhere.\nThe problem with dungeon breaks isn’t just the monsters spilling out. When the cracks in the gates opened, they let out “miasma” along with the monsters.\nMiasma is a deadly poison that erodes space and curses the land. The land eroded by miasma had to be cleaned up for at least a year before crops could be planted.\nIn other words, a dungeon break in the Granary was deadly enough to make or break the year’s farming.\n“The Firebird Guild is still home to S-class Hunter Lee Yong-wan, so even a Scarlet Gate isn’t that difficult.”\n“……Yes.”\nChief Kim Jin-soo wondered if he should tell Han Ha-ri about the intelligence he had received from the National Intelligence Service.\nThe Firebird Guild had been acting suspiciously lately, ever since they had asked the government for an exemption and been denied.\n-Beep!\n“Huh?”\nAt that moment, Kim Jin-soo and Han Ha-ri’s phones vibrated with the same timing. An ominous siren sounded, “Beep, beep, beep.”\n[Hunan Plain Gate Dungeon Break, all active employees stand by.]\nSeeing the message, the two of them shouted in unison.\n“”Firebird Guild, you bastards!!””\n* * * * *\nThey must have thought that being behind the magic mirror wouldn’t make them inaudible, but Leon had a clear grasp of the sound from beyond.\nHis blessed body was already beyond human flesh and he was a living saint. In other words, a demigod.\n‘They’re in trouble.’\nIt wasn’t the Dungeon Break that was the problem; it was the fact that the Dungeon Break happened in the Granary.\nApparently, when a dungeon break occurs, the land becomes contaminated and crops don’t grow…….\n‘I guess they’re not here.’\nWith that, Leon was convinced that ‘it’ was absent from the earth.\n‘Bad harvests’ and ‘bad years’ are a sure sign.\n’Demera, are you good?’\nHe asked the ‘goddess’ hidden in my heart.\n────\nShe gladly responded to the agent of the pantheon.",

      "content": "Chapter 5: Divinity (1)\nIt’s been a week since a gate appeared in the Hunan plains, responsible for South Korea’s rice production.\nThe scarlet gate, with an average difficulty of Class A, was supposed to be a breeze to clear when the Firebird Guild won the bid.\nIf only the Firebird Guild had played their cards right.\n“What the hell is going on?”\nChief Kim Jin-soo and Deputy Han Ha-ri flew straight to the Hunan Plains by helicopter, where they were met by the Firebird Guild’s Guild Leader, Lee Yong-wan.\n“Ah, Chief Kim. Our rookie Han Ha-ri is also here?”\nDespite the gravity of the situation, he was relaxed, and from the look on his face, the two had a hunch.\n‘This guy… on purpose!’\nThere was no doubt. The Firebird Guild had deliberately caused the dungeon break by making the gate attack sluggish!\n‘They’ve been asking for an exemption, and now they’re doing this?’\nThere has been a lot of friction between the Association and the Firebird Guild recently.\nThroughout this year, the Firebird Guild has consistently demanded exemptions for themselves as one of the top ten guilds in the country.\nThey demanded an exemption of up to 1 trillion won for income generated from gate byproducts, spirit stone income, and monster materials.\nThe reasoning behind the request was to improve the quality of training and increased cost of healing for guild members.\nThe government, which already provides various benefits to large domestic guilds, was reluctant and rejected Guild Leader Lee Yong-wan’s request.\nI thought they’d do something, but how could they do something like this in the midst of the uproar over the Black Gate, which hadn’t appeared in 13 years?\n‘Damn bastards, what kind of land is the Hunan Plain, and how can you do this when the cleanup of the Naju Plain hasn’t even been completed!’\nAfter the Gate incident, the world’s food trade routes froze to a standstill.\nThe Great Plains, where the initial response to the Gate crisis was slow, were contaminated by miasma, and South Korea was no exception.\nKorea’s so-called Naju granary was contaminated, and the reagents to clean it up were astronomical!\nIf this year’s farming in the Hunan Plains is ruined, the country’s self-sufficiency in food will be cut in half.\nHan Ha-ri called out in a panic.\n“Hunter Yong-wan, we need to close the gate right now! It’s been a week since the break! Any more than that and-”\n“I know, I know, the rights to the gate go to the winner. But what can we do?”\nGuild Leader Yong-wan mocked the two with a despicable smile.\n“Since our guild members are injured, it’s unlikely that we can close it in this state, so it looks like the Firebird Guild will have to give up the rights to the Hunan Gate.”\n“……!”\nKim Jin-soo and Han Ha-ri’s faces boiled with anger. They both wanted to shake their fists at the bastard in front of them, but he was an S-class Hunter.\nEven his subordinate, Han Ha-ri, an A-rank Hunter, couldn’t handle him, let alone Kim Jin-soo, a mere B-rank Hunter.\n‘Bastards! With so many A- ranks, you can’t close the gate?’\n“What do you want to do?”\n“……What are you trying to say?”\n“How did the Association deal with the monsters that came out in the first round, and you know that the gate hasn’t completely opened yet?”\nThe black gate hadn’t injured any of the people who had been sent in, so the Association had some time to spare for the moment.\nIt would be from Day 7 to Day 10 that the gates with monsters inside would cause dungeon breaks.\nIn other words, the scarlet gate of the Hunan Plains hadn’t been fully opened yet.\n“Should we take control of the gate right now──?”\n“No, Mr. Kim, I don’t understand why you’re doing this. You know that according to the Hunter Law, the guild that wins the bid for the gate keeps it until the eighth day.”\nNo matter how much the Association wanted to, they couldn’t forcibly take away a gate that had already been bid on. The Firebird Guild Leader was taking advantage of that.\n“We’ll try until tomorrow, but we have a lot of injured members, so I don’t know if we’ll be able to capture it.”\n“Bastard…….”\nHan Ha-ri cursed uncontrollably but at her remark, Yong-wan smirked and relaxed.\n“It’s nice to have an amicable agreement like that, isn’t it? The heroes who risk their lives to defend this country of blue, white, and red can’t ask for even the smallest benefit?”\n“Already… you’ve already received so many grants and tax breaks…….”\nThe benefits the government gives to the big guilds are not small but the problem is that they’re insatiable pigs.\n“Why don’t we go to Japan, they promise to treat us much better than our shitty country?”\n“……!”\nYes, this was the problem.\nIn the global battle of the survivors and awakeners the wealthier nations tried to recruit high-ranking Hunters for their own safety, risking diplomatic friction and scheming.\nTo preserve what little power it had, the Korean government tied up the big guilds with lavish benefits…but even that could only go so far.\n“Don’t you…have the least bit of patriotism?”\nEven if survival of the fittest is the virtue of this world, shouldn’t there be at least… a minimum of conscience and justice?\n“Patriotism? Justice? Such things have long since gone out of fashion. Don’t be childish, my dear Miss Ha-ri, didn’t I tell you at last year’s draft that in this world, money and power equal justice?”\nHa-ri shuddered and swallowed her anger. This was why she’d joined the Hunter’s Association.\nThe behavior of the current generation of Korean Hunters, who only cared about money and risk, with little regard for the people they harmed, their lack of humanity, justice and the mockery of anyone who tries to do the right thing was an abhorrent behavior for a young girl who admired heroes and wanted to protect people.\nBut should she admit it? That the world is all about money and power? If she acknowledged this miserable reality, where would she find justice?\n“What shallow and stupid people you are.”\nAll eyes turned to the voice from beyond.\n“Your Majesty Leon?”\n“Do not call the king by his name, woman. Only honorifics are permitted to you.”\nThe man who had followed the two hurried travelers to see the world, stood between them, as if he had been listening to the entire conversation.\n“What are you, a European, I suppose–”\n“How dare you talk to this king?”\n“Eh?”\nLee Yong-wan was one of only twenty S-level hunters and the guild leader of the Firebird Guild, one of the ten largest guilds in Korea.\nIn this day and age, where strength as a Hunter translated into power and wealth, no one dared to make fun of him. But…….\n‘What is it, you bastard?’\n“I want you to die──”\n“Stop, Hunter Yong-wan, he’s a survivor!”\n“Survivor?”\nAt that word, Yong-wan’s energy subsided. Yes, survivors. They are strangers from a different culture than Earth.\nTheir cultural differences aside, a survivor has great value in and of itself. Not all of them, of course.\nYong-wan didn’t make the foolish mistake of antagonizing a survivor right away.\n“Excuse me, I’m Yong-wan of the Firebird Guild…I don’t suppose you’re the one who came from the Black Gate…”\n“The king does not speak twice.”\nImmediately shutting him up, Leon turned to Han Ha-ri and Jin-soo.\n“Tell him the problem.”\n“What?”\n“Don’t make me tell you twice. He doesn’t know the first thing about gates. Lay out the problem neatly for him.”\nThe two men’s tempers flared and the survivor was willing to take matters into his own hands.\n“It’s a dungeon break! When a dungeon break occurs, the land will be contaminated by the mass release of miasma! If that happens, there’s a possibility that the entire Hunan Plain will be contaminated! Even now, the miasma that has already spread is contaminating the land!”\n“What’s the solution?”\n“We must use decontamination agents to cleanse the pollution, and clear the dungeon as soon as possible to eliminate the dungeon itself!”\n“I understand. It’s the polluted land and the expanding gate. Gather your forces. The moment the deadline for the capture of those birds ends tomorrow, I will take matters into my own hands.”\n“Are you sure?”\nLeon was an S-class Hunter at the very least, and when a powerhouse like that offered to help, what fool would refuse?\n“However, first…….”\n“First?”\nThe two of them could give him anything he wanted. Should they start by getting him a weapon? No, he already has his own sword.\nHe doesn’t seem to have any armor, so should they go to an auction or something?\nBut Leon’s request was something completely different.\n“A king of another country can’t just waltz into someone else’s territory. I’ll have to get permission from this country’s king himself.”\n“Yes? No, that’s fine…….”\n“There is due process in all things. Let’s send a message to your king.”\n“”…….””\nEven the top ten guilds in the country don’t ask the president to show his face.\nYong-wan thought for a moment.\n‘This bastard, isn’t he worse than me?’\n* * * *\n“……This is the president.”\nFortunately, the president, who was traveling abroad, didn’t fly to the Hunan plains.\nLeon was relieved to hear that he had gone to ask for assistance with the Black Gate, and settled for a brief phone call to wish him well on his return.\n“Your Majesty, all 50 members of the Hunter Association’s official raiding party are ready!”\nHan Ha-ri, Chief Kim Jin-soo, the fifty official raiders for the gate, stood before him, armed to the teeth.\n“Good. Did you say that the legal deadline for those birds ends tomorrow?”\n“Oh, yeah…….”\nHa-ri stared at Leon in surprise. His behavior was so unexpected that she had expected the man to just barge through the gate, disregarding legalities.\n“Do you look upon this king as a savage?”\n“What? That’s not possible!”\n“There is a law in civilization called due process. How can I be an honorable knight if I don’t obey the laws of the land?”\n“Ohhh…….”\nThe Association staff exclaimed in admiration as Leon swept them off their feet, displaying his natural command.\n“What more can I ask of you than that, have you prepared?”\nAt that, Ha-ri and the others couldn’t shake their suspicious glances.\n“I…Your Majesty.”\n“Speak.”\n“You said to prepare, and I have, but…what do you intend to use these for?”\nLeon ordered them to make 100 rice straw dolls.\n“Our precious land has been polluted, and we must cleanse it.”\n“What?”\nIn all, more than 100 straw dolls were made by the Association’s staff, who hurriedly traveled around the city asking “women who had given birth” to make them.\n“Are those the wives who made the dolls?”\n“Yes, sir.”\nAt dawn, more than 100 women who had been urgently requested by the Association’s staff and the city office were lined up.\nThe women ranged in age from young to middle-aged to octogenarians.\n“Show me the dolls you have made.”\nSome of the women struggled with the command, but the reward offered by the association encouraged them to be generous.\nLeon began to inspect the straw puppets the women had made.\n“Hmm… this is ridiculous.”\n“……?”\n“To think of calling these metaphysical monoliths dolls.”\n“Hmph…!”\nThe first straw doll was tossed aside.\n“Ho-ho, this one?”\n“‘Mmm…do you like it, Your Majesty?”\n“It’s like a living doll.”\n“It’s not that well made──”\n“I’d rather choose self-destruction soon than live in such an ugly form.”\n“…….”\nThe second, third, and twentieth dolls were thrown out. It was Han Ha-ri’s turn.\n“Hmm? Did you participate too?”\n“Oh, yes! I’m good with my hands, so I’m good at making dolls!”\nHa-ri’s puppet was certainly convincing. Despite being made of straw, it was nicely shaped and decorated.\n“I’m surprised you’ve ever given birth.”\n“What? Oh, I’m not… married, I’m afraid. I thought it was all right for women…”\n“No, you silly thing.”\n“Uh-uh!”\nThe straw doll was brutally torn apart, and the wind whipped it away.\nAfter such a harsh criterion, Leon’s eyes were drawn to an old woman.\n“Excellent! How many children have you given birth to, madam?”\n“Twelve.”\n“Hmm, so young, so patriotic, and so full of life. Do you have any plans for future children?”\n“I’m a widow.”\n“Hehe, if you’re as full of life as you are, I’m sure you’ll be able to remarry. You’re still young, so give it a good ten years.”\n“I’ll search first.”\n“Normally, I would send a knight to personally deliver a plaque and gift to a woman who has borne more than ten children, but forgive me if this is not possible.”\nLeon kissed the back of the old woman’s hand and placed the straw doll on the altar.\n“The conditions are met.”\nLeon reached into his subspace and pulled out something. As the subspace opened a goblet appeared in his palm.\nIt was an old goblet, faded and cracked in places, but no one could take their eyes off it. It was as if some divine energy flowed through it.\n“You are the mother of the bountiful land. May the children of the earth dwell in the dolls of the harvest offered to you.”\nThe goblet was filled with water and when the self-filled goblet was placed before the altar, a strange thing happened.\nThe water in the goblet boiled over and gushed out as if it were regurgitated and entered the straw doll!\n“What the hell is going on?”\nThe staff of the Association, the ladies who made the straw dolls, and the guild members of the Firebird Guild couldn’t take their eyes off what was happening in front of them.\nThe sun was rising and the red glow colored the clouds as the day was about to begin again. But on this day, May 24, 2032 the sunset will mark a special beginning for the entire world.\n“Lionheart, my child.”\nThe straw doll rises as the divine doll speaks with a benevolent voice.\n“Greetings to Mother Earth Demera, goddess of life and fertility.”\nDivinity has descended upon the earth.",

      "content": "Chapter 6: Divinity (2)\n“Hello, it’s been a while since I turned on the stream, this is Mr. Park, a farmer from Jeolla Province.”\n-What are you doing at this time?\n-When are you going to post traditional content?\nFarmer Park was a farmer who was also a part-time YouTuber.\nHe is a typical local YouTuber who combines his job with farming, showing rural life such as farming content, frog eating, and wild boar hunting.\nHe was here to see his neighbor Kim’s rice field, which he said was recently disrupted by the appearance of the gate.\n“Didn’t I mention in the community that Mr. Kim’s field is affected by the gate?”\n-You did.\n-The Firebird Guild won the bid.\n-Mr. Kim set up a table for the Firebird Guild Hunters to eat and drink to make things right.\n“Oh, but I heard that the dungeon break happened.”\n-Mr. Park’s son-in-law.\n-The Firebird Guild with an S-rank Yong-wan and multiple A-ranks couldn’t clear a scarlet gate?\n-Bullshit ㄴㄴ\nThe viewers’ reactions made Mr. Park feel resentful, as he had seen Mr. Kim, the owner of the field, cry unwillingly when he saw the field contaminated by the miasma.\nPark didn’t know much about the Hunters, but he knew that Firebird was a famous guild and that they were very good.\nStill, the Dungeon Break happened, and Kim’s fields were still being contaminated by miasma. It was the farmer’s worst fear since the Cataclysm 30 years ago.\n“I swear to God,” he says, “even the people from the association are here, and they’re freaking out. All my rice is rotten because it was contaminated by miasma.”\nMr. Park zoomed in on the camera footage, showing the contaminated land and the Association staff confronting the Firebird Guild.\nIt wasn’t just the rice that was rotting, but the skeletal remains strewn about, suggesting the remains of skeletons.\n-……Really? If it’s spreading like wildfire in Hunan, it must be an early harvest this year, but no news?\n-Isn’t it fucked up? At least they’ve increased farming subsidies because food self-sufficiency is down.\n-What’s the point of more subsidies? I don’t have any land to farm.\n-The answer is smart farms. Buy Doojung Future Food now.\n-Worms OUT!\nAfter that, Mr. Park continued to take videos around the gate.\nAlthough the gate was cordoned off, Park was lucky enough to be spotted wandering among the crops, and the viewers’ reactions became more serious.\n“Oh… there’s a foreigner.”\nThen, a blond man walked into his camera and the viewers raised questions.\n-Who is this foreigner? Is he from the Firebird Guild?\n-He’s poorly equipped for such a thing. He’s not even wearing any gear.\n-Then he’s an Association employee?\n-There are no Europeans in the Association. But he’s very handsome.\n-Aren’t there many women over there? They’re all carrying something? Zoom in on them Mr. Park.\nPark saw the altar and the straw puppets.\n‘Are they doing a ritual?’\nIt’s not uncommon to see people doing rituals on the land contaminated by miasma.\nThey hope it will cleanse the land, but in the end, the only way to cleanse it is to inject the reagent in time.\n‘Is that blond guy some kind of mage? No, he doesn’t look like a mage at all.’\nMr. Park was strangely uneasy about the man.\nIt’s not just his appearance and even though he was being filmed from a distance, the living saint’s radiance exuded an air of nobility.\nHe instinctively felt a sense of “authenticity” that he doesn’t get from the upper class and actors he often sees on TV or the internet.\nThe modern aristocracy may be high achievers and entrepreneurs, but their elegance and pedigree can’t replicate the real thing.\nThen, in the next moment Mr. Park, a farmer, witnesses a moment that will change his life.\n* * * *\nLeon is the first knight of Arianna, the goddess of light and justice.\nAll the previous Lionheart Kings of the Divine Knightly Kingdom of Lionheart were Arianna’s first champions in her service.\nBut in the Kingdom of Lionheart, where harmony with and service to the gods is a virtue, some gods are essential to the faith, so naturally the Lionheart Kings are also their champions.\n[Lionheart. My child.]\n“Greetings to you, Demera, Goddess of Life and Fertility.”\nLeon did the courtesy of dropping to one knee, offering his respect and reverence to the crested figure.\nDemera’s stature in the pantheon is high. She is the embodiment of all life and the goddess of abundance.\nAs everyone struggled to understand the voice that echoed from the straw doll, Demera, the god within the straw doll, spoke.\n[This new land is also being invaded by evil. The land is polluted.]\n“Yes, evil species exist in this land. But I fear that the absence of divinity and the lowly, lowly pigs will stain the eyes of the Goddess.”\nLeon’s first emotion upon returning to Earth was disappointment.\nBeing an awakened or a survivor is secondary. He had only a faint memory of the 20 years he had been alive.\nHowever, when he returned, he found himself faced with the domination of a guild and an incompetent government, which was both pathetic and sad.\n[Ignorance and greed are not necessarily sins. Such is the nature of mortal life. What do you intend to do about it?]\n“I don’t like it, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to drive out the legitimate rule. This land elects its leaders through the pathetic means of voting, but that’s the way it’s supposed to be, and that’s the way it is.”\nIt was the only reason he recognized the president’s authority.\nThe incompetence of a man who can’t handle a bunch of knife-wielders is appalling, but the right to rule is sacred, and he intends to follow due process.\n“I will establish parallels between rights and duties on this earth then I will teach the ignorant and guide them on the right path.”\nEarth, his home, where power and money have become justice was a land devoid of divinity above all else.\nLeon will build a new pantheon on this land. He would restore the gods of the now defunct pantheon and create a new order of Holy Knights.\nTo do this, he would need faith, countless followers, priests, and true believers to worship in the Great Hall.\n“Oh, don’t you have a favor to ask of this mother?”\nDemera read Leon’s intentions and smiled.\nHe was no longer a champion of light and justice alone.\nWhen the gods of the pantheon chose the Grail Keeper, Leon, as their vessel and decided to put all of their divinity into the pantheon within his heart.\nThe gods staked everything on Leon. They trusted him to slay the hordes of evil and survive to the end.\nHe did so admirably for two hundred years, and then saw his chance in a new land so the gods of the Great Hall will grant him whatever he wishes. They will trust the greatest knight of all time to uphold their honor and sanctity.\n“Yes, Demera. The free peoples of this land are suffering from a foul influence called miasma. Please heal and cleanse this land, though it is not your will.”\nDemera, the straw doll, had divinity at her fingertips.\nIt was a small blessing, nothing compared to the faith of so many but in a land where faith is absent, it would be a great miracle.\n“You are my priest and our champion. The earth of this world might not be this mother’s flesh but if you spread my divinity and replace this barren land with my flesh, everything on this earth will be your ally.”\nThe land is infused with divinity.\nA living saint, a demigod, the Lionheart king…and the Mother of Life blesses the land.\nThe earth is life. It is the source of life and the beginning of a world of abundance.\nThe divinity of the earth, with its infinite energy, created a marvelous sight.\nThe earth, contaminated with miasma, rotted and the rice that had come in was destroyed but the unforgiving divinity sprouted new life.\nAt the same time neither the contaminated soil nor the rotten rice could stop their growth, for the saint’s hand had fulfilled the rightful duty of all life rooted in the earth.\nLeon said to all those who watched from afar.\n“See and realize, you uneducated and ignorant humans, this is the world with the divine!”\nThe procession of rice rose like gold while trembling hands and mouths clasped together at the miracle of life that had come forth from the polluted earth.\n“Be fruitful and multiply. It is the rightful duty of the living, and this bountiful land is a testament to the covenant to all eternity.”\n* * * *\nHan Ha-ri, Kim Jin-soo and the rest of the staff of the Hunter Association were dumbfounded by the miracle that was unfolding before their eyes.\nHow could a miasma pollute the land?\nHow can life not grow in a polluted land?\nAll of their questions led to one conclusion.\nA malevolent force beyond the comprehension of human common sense or technology was at work to ravage the world.\nCrops cannot grow on contaminated land. Cleanup efforts are possible, but they are offset by a significant investment of precious Hunter mana.\nYou can’t grow crops on land contaminated with miasma. That’s modern common knowledge, and why modern humans cling desperately to printed cultures and palm farms.\nAs more and more land becomes contaminated because of the Dungeon Breaks, humanity’s food self-sufficiency rate will plummet.\n“What the…….”\nHa-ri and Kim Jin-woo couldn’t believe their eyes at what they were seeing as the golden crops on the ground swayed gently in the wind.\nThe golden fields on the ground shone brilliantly, as if the fact that they had just been contaminated was a lie.\n“Chief… This, this is real rice.”\n“I see it too.”\nThe rice grew in an instant but it’s not just the hunters’ association that is horrified. So was the leader of the Firebird Guild, Lee Yong-wan, who was trying to intimidate the Hunter Association by polluting the land.\n“Hah! You don’t realize that crops grown by magic are poisonous!”\nYong Wan had a point.\nEver since the Cataclysm, mankind had been researching ways to grow crops with magic. However, the enchanted crops were inedible to ordinary humans and acted as toxins.\n“What an ignorant thing to say. This is a crop blessed by the gods themselves. How can you judge it as poison?”\n“It’s just a straw doll──”\n“I forgive ignorance only once. Do not defile the goddess with your light tongue.”\nThere was something powerful and submissive about Leon’s words. Above all, the implicit wariness he felt toward the survivors kept him from acting in vain.\n‘Shit, I shouldn’t be doing this.’\nThe Hunan Plain was a hostage and just as the Association had suspected, the Firebird Guild had deliberately induced a dungeon break.\nThe top 10 Korean guilds still receive countless benefits, but they wanted more, and the centerpiece was the exemption for dungeon byproducts.\nRight now, they want an exemption worth 1 trillion won a year, but they’re only going to get bigger and bigger, eventually demanding a complete exemption.\nIn the end, if you scare the government with the excuse of Dungeon Break, the government will have no choice but to accept it, even if it means protecting the country and its people.\nBut it was all ruined by one survivor and Yong-wan wanted to say something.\n“Let’s check it out,” he said, “I think it needs to be verified for the safety of the people who will be eating that rice.”\nHis intentions aside, the argument was true.\nCrops grown with magic are inedible to normal humans. So, of course, it needed to be tested.\n“I’ll lend you my guild’s appraiser. I’m curious to see what you’ve grown in one second.”\nYong-wan smiled his trademark mean smile and waited for the results. Looking forward to the moment when he could unmask that shameless stranger.\nIf the crops showed even a trace of magical energy, he would call him a fraud.\n“Go and check it!”\n“Quick, quick.”\n“Our guild’s appraisers are excellent.”\nJust as Yong Wan was expecting the appraiser’s mouth to say that people couldn’t eat this rice, the appraiser’s mouth, which was covered in cold sweat, finally dropped.\n“The appraisal result is Rare!”\n“Huh?”\n“Every single rice grade is Rare!”",

      "content": "Chapter 7: Divinity (3)\nSince Cataclysm, item appraisers have been one of the most important support classes.\nWhile there are only a few appraisal skills, if an appraiser’s level is low, they can often miss an item’s stats or fail to interpret a special ability.\nIn that sense, it’s no exaggeration to say that Firebird Guild’s appraiser Kang Sun-woo is one of the best appraisers in the country.\nAs he appraises the miraculous rice in front of him, he is both thrilled and disappointed with the results.\n‘The rice that was forced to grow by magic has toxins and is inedible for humans. Even hunters have to wash their stomachs after eating it a few times.’\nThat’s how nature works. It demanded due process, and it needed time.\nEven with the development of things like printed food and palm farms, they can’t completely replace the existing food system.\nSo it’s easy to be overwhelmed by the golden field and disappointed by the results.\n“Let’s get started.”\nHe stacks the rice and begins to analyze it, his eyes glowing with magic and revealing one element after another.\n[Results].\n“Huh?”\n[Blessed Rice]\n◆ Rating: Rare\nDescription: Rice blessed with the divine power of Goddess Demera, the goddess of life and fertility.\nAlleviates grade 3 diseases and if consumed continuously, there is a high probability of being cured.\n“Eh?”\nHe panted, checking the message in front of him.\nWith the advent of potions and elixirs after the Cataclysm, recovery items, diseases, and injuries had also begun to be graded intuitively.\nGrade 3 diseases included most neurological conditions and even early-stage cancers.\n‘This rice cures cancer? All of this rice? Isn’t that better than the expensive cures in the tower?’\n“The test results are in!”\nHe couldn’t wait to introduce this amazing miracle crop to everyone.\n“The appraisal result is Rare!”\n“Huh?”\n“Each and every one of these rice is a rare grade!”\nEveryone was stunned by Kang’s words, and some didn’t understand what he was talking about. It sounded too unrealistic. But when he said that this rice can even cure cancer, everyone’s minds were blown.\n“Is it true?”\n“It’s true!”\nHa-ri couldn’t keep her mouth shut, but she turned to Leon who was talking to a straw puppet imbued with Demera’s divinity, as if he didn’t need to listen.\n“Your Majesty!”\n“Insolence! This king, a priest, is talking to a goddess!”\n“I’m sorry, I have committed a sin worthy of death!”\n[It’s all right, how can a mere mortal know how to treat a goddess?]\nThe voice was merciful like when she heard Leon’s voice at the Black Gate, and it had encouraged her, and she felt warm inside just hearing it.\n“Since Demera says so, I will forgive you this one time.”\n“Yes…….”\nShe bowed her flat head and looked at the two of them. The straw doll was becoming limp.\n“I think I’ve done my part now, and I’ll go back to sleep.”\n“Thank you. The grace of the Earth Mother Goddess, I will always swallow it sweetly.”\n[Ah, this mother has one last nagging word.]\nThe divine voice sounded strained, as if it had suddenly lost its strength. Inhabiting the doll, she spoke to her champion one last time.\n[Don’t go off and starve.]\nWith that, the straw doll collapsed and Leon closed his eyes and reflected on the Earth Mother’s grace.\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, the flat-faced Ha-ri cautiously raised her head.\n“That…Your Majesty? What is this…….?”\n“Divinity.”\n“Divinity…what do you mean?”\n“Are there no gods in this world?”\nHa-ri didn’t know how to answer Leon’s question.\nOf course there are religions on Earth. Jehovah, Allah, Buddha… Isn’t Buddha a god? Whatever.\nReligion exists but she’d be careful about saying that God exists.\nSure, religious people will say that God exists, but whether they can prove that God is real, as they just witnessed, is another matter.\nThe gods of Earth’s religions claim to be real only in their doctrines, not in their miracles, as Leon demonstrated.\n“Well… I don’t know.”\n“This is divinity, a pantheon of burdens. The right life and world is one of harmony with the divine, and you Earthlings should follow suit.”\nHan Ha-ri wondered if that was even possible.\nThe Earth was already in the grip of the established religions. Their exclusivity toward other religions is understandable.\nEven relatively mild-mannered Protestants enter other people’s temples on fictional holidays, trampling on the ground and desecrating shrines.\nBut what’s in front of them was a real God demonstrating a miracle.\nHa-ri feels a strange sense of trust in this strange, anachronistic king.\nCould they…could they really have brought someone so extraordinary through the gates that he would change the world?\n“Cut the rice! Bow in gratitude to Demera and let the crop fulfill its rightful role!”\nLeon had them cook rice from the blessed rice that sprouted in the middle of the Hunan Plains. There were three hours left before the Firebird Guild’s right to capture the Hunan Plains Gate expired.\n* * * *\n“No way.”\nKim Jin-soo swallowed hard as he looked at the system message that flashed before his eyes.\n[Cooked blessed rice]\nThe fact that steaming white rice appeared in the Awakened system window was bizarre, but the information the appraisal showed was shocking.\n-100 health regeneration per minute.\n-50 mana regeneration per minute.\n-Duration: 8 hours.\n“Crazy…….”\nHe couldn’t believe that rice gave a buff, and even then, the effect was massive.\n“This is almost like a passive buff.”\nThis was exactly what he expected from a 3 million won per bottle potion that didn’t perform horribly for the price.\nHa-ri approached with a mouth full of pork belly on air rice.\n“Eat and tell me how you feel.”\nHa-ri swallowed hard and finally spoke.\n“Chief, chief, this is awesome…….”\n“What is it?”\n“It… stacks.”\n“What?!”\nKim Jin-soo’s ears perked up.\n“I’m just curious… Have you ever eaten bugs that grew in a rice field besides rice?”\n“Worms?”\nQuick, how could she think of eating a worm?\n“I ate them and they… nested.”\n“Really?!”\nKim Jin-soo was dumbfounded, but he looked toward the rice paddies.\nNot only rice grows in the paddy field. There are deer worms that nibble on the growing rice and insects that feed on it.\nIf that blessing is an area-wide blessing for the entire land… it wouldn’t be strange if all life was blessed, not just the rice.\nGreed burned in the eyes of the hunters who were about to enter the gate.\nThey risked their lives to capture the gate and although government hunters were given a minimal amount of enhancements, it was minimal.\nFor a salaryman, a few million won in enhancements is a last resort. But now there were free buffs everywhere. It was like eating bugs.\n“Come on, get one! Get one more!”\nHunters armed with armor and swords scrambled through the rice paddies.\n“It stacks up to three times…….”\nThe momentum of the Association Hunters soared before the raid.\n* * * *\n“Guild Leader…are you okay?”\nThe Vice Guild Leader looked at Lee Yong-wan and asked as everything was disrupted by the appearance of the survivor named Leon.\n“…….”\nOf course he couldn’t be okay.\nThe Firebird Guild had deliberately induced the dungeon break, and they were prepared to bleed.\nAs a top ten guild, they couldn’t be openly hostile, but they were likely to be treated differently than other top ten guilds.\nIn particular, they would be excluded from the most lucrative high grade scarlet gates and above for the time being.\n‘Damn it, where did that bastard come from?’\nYong-wan glared at Leon, who was still meditating with his eyes closed.\n‘It’s him. That survivor ruined everything. If it weren’t for him, the crippled government would have been forced to give in to our demands.’\nHe wished that Leon would die in the gate.\n“Huh?”\nSuddenly, Yong-wan remembered the gate he had been wandering around for days.\n“Hmph… This isn’t so bad.”\n“Vice Guild Leader?”\n“Don’t worry about it, but we have a gate to close at the end.”\n“That’s right, I was a bit… out of shape in the middle, but… Ah!”\nThe Vice Guild Leader who had attacked the scarlet gate with him had the same expression on his face when he read Yong-wan’s intentions.\n“There’s only one A-rank hunter, huh?”\nIf so, the result was obvious. That gate boss would never be defeated by the Hunter Association’s floaters.\n“But if there’s a survivor of that…….”\n“He’s a tough nut to crack, even for me. He’s a Buffer, with a blessing on the land. They say he’s the king, so he can’t be much of a fighter.”\nEither way, the conclusion is the same.\nGate strategies are not for nothing. You need to understand the concept of the gate and prepare accordingly.\nThey will never be able to defeat the boss of that gate and if they can’t defeat the boss, they can’t close the gate.\nTwo twisted smiles greeted the Association raiders as they departed in search of a way to die.\n* * * *\nLeon had a vague idea of what a gate capture was.\nEvery gate revolves around a mission, and by clearing that mission, you can close the gate… That is, get rid of the gate.\n“Most of them have a boss mob… no, a boss, and defeating it will often close the gate.”\n“Hmm… a diary of boss encounters. I like that.”\n“Ah…….”\nHa-ri didn’t know how to answer so she remained silent.\n“I’ve heard that those birds have been attacked before, but there are quite a few monsters, aren’t there?”\nLeon said, looking at Kim Jin-soo and the Association Hunters fighting at the front as skeletons had been charging at them from the gate, armed with swords and shields.\n“That’s a feature of this gate.”\n“A feature?”\n“Yes…In most gates the total number of monsters can be reduced but in special cases, such as skeletons, zombies… demons…they respawn indefinitely as long as the boss monster remains intact.”\n“I see, so it will only end when the boss is defeated, I understand.”\nHa-ri guessed that this was a command gate and that there would be a commander controlling the skeletons.\nKim Jin-soo thought so too, and as a rule of thumb, the odds were in their favor.\n“If there’s a high probability, does that mean that other things will appear with a low probability?”\n“Yes. For example…a very powerful commander.”\nJust as Han Ha-ri was about to explain more.\n-Kii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-i–!\nA bizarre ringing sound that seemed to tear at the eardrums was heard.\n“What?”\nChief Kim Jin-soo and Deputy Han Ha-ri turned pale. The other Association Hunters did the same.\n“Lee Yong-wan, you son of a bitch, why didn’t you tell me that!”\n[Dungeon break begins.]\n-You are sentenced to death. The time limit for all life within the gate begins.\n-Commander Knight Dulahan advances with his army.\n-Defeat Commander Dulahan. Time remaining: 3 hours 00 minutes\nFrom the beginning of the dungeon break the entire army has begun to march toward the capture point.",

      "content": "Chapter: 8 Chivalry (1)\nKim Jin-soo, party leader and tank of the raiding party, swallowed hard as he looked at the swarming skeleton army.\n“That’s a lot of them.”\n“Chief, do we distribute potions?”\n“Distribute as much as we can…….”\nUnlike the private hunter guilds that invested lavishly in gate capture, the Association’s raiding party had limited resources and budget.\nThey didn’t have enough of the short-term buff potions that a hunter guild would have invested in, or the lifesaving recovery potions that a hunter guild would have.\nAfter all, the Hunter’s Association was part of the government, and as a national organization, it was difficult to spend more than the set budget.\n“It’s a good thing they’re a bunch of bones.”\n“Still, don’t let your guard down. Even a blind sword could cut you.”\nSkeletons are the easiest of the undead to deal with since their strength comes from their muscles and hunters who have awakened their powers could tip the scales, but as long as they’re alive, the basics remain the same.\nSkeletons don’t have a single muscle since they are animated by the power of thought or magic. Their basic power also varies, so beware of the skeleton archer who shoots blind arrows or the occasional skeleton mage.\nChief Kim called out to his men.\n“Deputy Sa, Deputy Park, the two tanks, fall back, and join Deputy Han and Dealer Han in the reserve!”\nThey were the youngest and most talented members of the party. With them in reserve, Jin-soo searched for any possible Skeleton Mages.\n“Man-sik, how many archers and mages do they have?”\n“Thirty archers and two mages right now!”\n“The ones with long range skills will take care of them first, and the ones with shields will stop them from coming in, I trust you, assholes!”\nBefore he could finish, the skeleton army charged, and as the mass of bones clashed, Kim felt the heaviness of his shield.\n‘It’s heavier than I thought, I guess the Scarlet Gate is different after all.’\nBut it’s not something he, a B-rank tanker, can’t handle. With his remaining hand, he blocked the skeleton warrior in front of him, and with the other, he crushed its skull with his war hammer.\n-Wham!\nAn arrow flew between the skeleton’s ribs but as his shield was a little too long it almost hit his knee.\n‘What the hell, a skeleton archer can snipe?’\nChief Kim was momentarily stunned, but then he shouted as he hit a new skeleton.\n“Archers, wizards, hurry up and shoot those bastards!”\n“Sorry!”\nIn retaliation, the Association Hunters sniped the Skeleton Archers one after another. As the Skeleton Archers fell one after another with their skulls pierced, they smiled in conviction.\n-Goooow!\nA magic circle was drawn to the front and the Skeleton Mages had used magic.\n‘Damn, there’s not a single mage on this side, but those skeletons over there have mages!’\nSkeleton mages usually command a high ransom. Chief Kim swallowed the woes of his impoverished organization and shouted.\n“I’m here!”\nHis voice was enchanted and the threat rate instantly rose as the eyes of the Skeleton Mages turned towards him.\nThe spell that was about to land in the middle of the party was twisted and directed at Chief Kim.\n-Kwalung!\n“Boom!”\nThunder crashed from the magic circle and struck Chief Kim directly but he held on.\n“Chief!”\n“It’s okay… It’s just a sting. This armor is expensive──”\nAt that moment, a shadow fell over him and he was met with a gaze.\nA head resting on the waist, a headless knight and a huge warhorse, all of them were staring at him.\n“Dulahan…!”\nThe moment his paralyzed body failed to react the headless knight, along with his giant warhorse, rushed forward and slammed into Chief Kim.\n‘Huh?!’\nChief Kim was thrown back with a bang as voices could be heard calling out to him, but they were quickly replaced by screams.\nDulahan, the Headless Knight and boss of this dungeon had gone on a rampage with his giant sword.\n“Kwak…!”\n“What, what, what greatsword…!”\n“What the hell are you doing, block the opening!”\nA gap opened up behind the devastating cavalry charge and skeletons tumbled through the gap.\nSkeletons are nothing to be afraid of since a properly organized party of D-rank hunters can handle them. On the contrary, the moment they become most deadly is when they get into a scuffle.\nUnless you crush their skulls, the skeletons, which can only move with their knuckles, will tangle with your allies.\n“Chief Kim!”\nHan Ha-ri and the party, who were standing by in reserve, looked anxiously at the collapsing front.\n“What can we do? We have to go save him, Deputy Han!”\nThey had to save them but Han Ha-ri naturally sent her gaze to Leon, who was waiting behind her. If…if this self-proclaimed Lionheart King who had slain even that Archdemon…….\n“Your Majesty, please support us!”\nEveryone’s gaze naturally turned to Leon. However, even with those gazes, Leon only stared coldly.\n“A king doesn’t take the lead in a small fight like this.”\n“What? What do you mean…?”\n“You should find a way to bring honor to me, not make me move my jade body for a bunch of insignificant bones.”\nThe Knight King did not draw his sword, genuinely disgusted with the group.\n“It’s a disgrace to the Goddess that my sword should touch such undead rags. It disgusts me to even look at them.”\nWhat the hell, really!\nBut Ha-ri recognized that this man has no intention of acting as his gaze remains fixed on the headless knight with interest.\n“Deputy Han, what are we going to do?!”\n“Ah, damn it! Reserves move!”\nHa-ri drew her sword. The allies tangled with the skeletons are in danger, but the most dangerous is Dulahan, rampaging in the middle of the formation.\n“I’ll take care of the boss, you guys support Chief Kim and our allies!”\nUsing the skeleton as a stepping stone, she leaps into the air and reaches Dulahan in a flash.\nBut Dulahan had eyes on the back of his head, and his greatsword moved behind his back, blocking Ha-ri’s blade.\n“This, you blocked this?”\nThe ambush was foiled in an instant. It was a lost cause, but there was always next time.\nHa-ri spun around and slashed at Dulahan’s chest but his armor blocked the blow, leaving only a scratch.\n‘Alas…I should have bought a more expensive sword!’\nIt was the best weapon she could get on a limited budget but the dungeon boss’s armor was heavier and harder than she thought.\nFor now, Ha-ri was satisfied that she had drawn Dulahan’s attention to herself and Dulahan was pulling on the reins of his horse, minding his own business, unlike when he had been cutting through the formation.\n“Come on!”\nThe reins are yanked in response to the taunt, and the slight distance between them is enough for Dulahan to launch his most daring cavalry charge yet.\nWith a thud, Dulahan slams into Ha-ri and it was a charge that would blow away even the B-rank tanker, Kim Jin-soo.\nThe dizzying impact is transmitted to her──\n-Bang!\nBut flames erupted at the moment of collision and cushioned the impact of the charge. Ha-ri smirks at Dulhan, who realizes that this is no ordinary flame.\n“I’m sorry, but my skill range is too big.”\nAs if she had been waiting for this moment, flames erupted from her sword.\nThe flames, generated by her magic, quickly grew into a great fire that engulfed Dulahan.\n-GAAAAAAAA──!\nA scream rang out from the burning Dulahan but without stopping, Ha-ri pierced the flaming Dulahan head.\n-BANG!\n“Huh?”\nHa-ri was confident that the blow would bring her victory, but it only made a very light sound as if the attack had hit steel.\n‘You blocked it with the side of your greatsword in that situation?’\n-Ho-ho.\nSomeone exclaims and a fist flies through the flames.\nRolling on the ground from the blow, Ha-ri didn’t understand how her attack didn’t have any effect.\n“Ha-ri!”\nJust then, the hunters rushed to her aid but their attacks were no match for Dulahan swordsmanship.\n“Kkkk?!”\nHe lightly swings his man-sized greatsword, blocking the blows and using the momentum to strike back.\nIt’s a necessary choice to protect his head, which is his fatal weakness, but Dulahan’s ability to overwhelm the hunters with such a small penalty is awe-inspiring.\nUsing his pure swordplay he dominated the hunters.\n“Excellent!”\nIt was then that a raspy voice echoed throughout the dungeon and all eyes turned to the blond man behind them.\n* * * *\nHe was called the Headless Knight and despised by Leon as an undead.\nLeon had always despised them. From bony soldiers, to ghouls, to corpse golems, to death knights there is no honor or glory in raising the dead and using them as meat shields.\nThose that have lost the skill of the living, and are driven by strength and magic alone, are no match for a Holy Knight.\n‘I was mistaken. That’s not just any undead.’\nLeon had faced countless undead, but none of them were as skilled with a sword as that one.\nThose moves were impossible for an undead. How could a creature perform such a sophisticated swordplay?\n“Excellent!”\nAnd so he decided to fight.\nWhen you see a great knight, how honorable is it to defeat him?\nHis raspy voice drew everyone’s attention, even the skeletons.\n“First, let me apologize for my shallow eyes that mistook such a fine knight as yourself for an undead.”\n-…….\nDulahan stopped swinging his sword at Ha-ri and listened to his voice.\n“Your swordsmanship is excellent, despite being one-handed. Your use of strategy and tactics is also superb so you must have been a renowned knight in your day.”\nAs he was talking to a dungeon boss and the hunters paused at the absurdity of the situation.\n“Very well, I, Leon Dragonia Lionheart, King of the Lionheart, authorize you to speak your name. Speak your name!”\n-…….\nDulahan didn’t answer because Dulahans have no vocal cords and Leon had no means to communicate with him.\nUnderstanding that, Leon nodded.\n“Hmm… I see. You are excused. I regret that I do not know your name, but let us leave that to the tragedies of the battlefield.”\n“……No, Your Majesty.”\nWhat if you’re talking to the real boss\n…Ha-ri wanted to say but couldn’t get the words out so Leon continued to speak in his way, much to the amusement of the Hunters.\n“Nameless Knight, I grant you the right to challenge this Lionheart King to a duel!”\nA duel? No, not even a duel, but the right to apply for one? To a monster?\nIt was unprecedented in the history of the Gate but he didn’t stop there.\n“There is no need to hurt the soldiers of both sides. Let’s end this fight with an honorable duel between two knights!”\nEveryone swallowed hard when he said that.\n-Nod\nIt worked?!\nFor the first time ever a dungeon boss accepted Hunter’s challenge to a duel. No, the hunters hadn’t even requested a one-on-one duel in the first place!\nBut that wasn’t the end of the story.\n“Hmm… However, it appears that the King does not have the steed necessary to fight as a knight. Due to circumstances, I am unable to obtain a horse at this time. That is clearly this King’s fault, but…….”\nSo what should he do…….\n“Knight, for the sake of your honor, why don’t you get off your horse and fight me fair and square.”\nThe boss isn’t an idiot, why would he get off his horse──\n-Dismount!\nHe was getting off!\nHa-ri and the Hunters’ jaws dropped as the headless rider, charging on his horse and wielding a greatsword larger than a man, dismounted of his own accord for a showdown between righteous knights!\nThe Hunters were dazed as they watched him approach Leon.",

      "content": "Chapter: 9 Chivalry (2)\nAs Dulahan dismounted, Leon realized he had been right.\n“Indeed, an honorable knight.”\nLeon summoned a sword from thin air, an iron blade worn but strong.\nHe wore no armor since the armor forged by Heto, the god of iron and smiths, had crumbled after so many years of war.\nLeon looked at Dulahan, who held a greatsword in one hand and clasped his head around his waist, and offered a word of consideration.\n“You can put your head down. Your swordsmanship, by nature, is two-handed. A true duel is not complete unless you use both hands.”\n“……I, Your Majesty.”\nJust then, Ha-ri cautiously approached.\n“What is it?”\n“That… Dulahan, he won’t die unless his head is cut off.”\n“So?”\nHow the hell are you supposed to defeat Dulahan without cutting off his head?\n“It doesn’t matter. It’s a knight’s honor to fight to the death.”\nNo, so he won’t die? After thinking about his words, Dulahan left his head to the skeletons and gripped his sword with both hands.\n“First Knight of Arianna, Goddess of Light and Justice, Grand Duke of Dragonia and King of the Lionheart I grant the honorable knight the challenge.”\nNo sooner had the anachronistic introduction and misplaced proclamation ended that Dulahan, who had closed the distance in an instant despite his creaking armor, slashed down with his greatsword.\nThere was a dizzying thud, but Leon was unscathed as blade after blade pushed against each other in a power struggle.\nLeon’s sword was an ordinary long sword. Dulahan’s sword, on the other hand, was a greatsword that could have been twice that size but even with the advantage of the top-heavy stance, Leon doesn’t flinch.\n‘What power…….’\nIn terms of power, Leon was overpowering Dulahan. In fact, he’s the one with the advantage in this situation.\nDulahan puts his hand on the blade of his sword, ready to strike. But in the blink of an eye, Leon sidesteps the blade, and in a flash, he’s driving his sword into Dulahan’s chest with a quick burst.\n“One strike.”\nThere was no mistaking what that declaration meant as Dulahan took two steps back and swung his greatsword with all the force he could muster.\nIt was a blast that would shatter any defense but Leon parried it with his blade at first, then crushed it with his pommel as the greatsword was embedded deep in the ground.\n-……!\nIn the next moment, a kick strikes Dulahan in the chest. It’s more of a shove than a swift kick but somehow, though, Dulahan’s stance collapses and he falls on his ass.\nThe sword is pointed straight up, and Leon says.\n“Two strikes.”\nWatching the sequence, the Hunters didn’t understand what had just happened.\nLeon’s kick looked more like a light shove, and yet Dulahan’s stance collapsed.\nTo the casual observer, it would have looked like Dulahan was letting Leon off the hook.\n“What the hell just happened?”\n“……It’s great.”\n“Ha-ri?”\nOf all of them, Ha-ri was the one who had understood what happened.\nShe’s been training with a sword for a long time, as an aspiring kendo player since she was a child.\nYou’d think that since it’s a sport of boxing and swordsmanship, she’d just need to be good with her fists and swords, but in any martial art, there are certain things that are emphasized like how to shift your center of gravity and how to move your lower body.\nWhether it’s throwing a light jab or parrying a hit it all starts with the lower body’s center of gravity and what Leon did was to disrupt that center of gravity.\n‘At first glance, it looks like he’s concentrating on his right foot, which is the one that’s doing the kicking, but it’s actually his left foot that’s on the ground, and he’s using his magic to create a pocket in the ground that creates a small vibration in a 2.5-meter radius.’\nA technique that shakes the ground with just the force of the footstep it’s a double-edged sword, as it disrupts your opponent’s stance while also disrupting your own but Leon did it so effortlessly and broke Dulahan’s stance.\nThe kick for the person with a collapsed center of gravity is nothing more than a slight push to the person standing at the edge of the cliff.\nIt was an intricate technique, but he had executed it effortlessly in such a short time.\n“Regain your stance.”\nDulahan limped back to his feet.\n* * * *\nKnight Dulahan was a knight who sought honor and glory.\nHe was cursed by the Commander Mage to lead an army but now free of his bindings, all he can do is stay in this unknown place and repel invaders.\nRepeating that task, he commanded an army to repel the invaders again.\nSome of the invaders were strong, but none were great.\n“Excellent!”\nExcept for one man, the one who called himself Leon Dragonia Lionheart and He boldly demanded a duel as a knight.\nIt had been a long time since someone calling himself a knight asked for a duel but it was most likely a ploy to get out of the predicament he’s in.\nAnyone who had been asked to dismount would have judged him as such but Dulahan would be furious at such foolishness, telling them not to sully his knightly honor.\nLook at him, look at that knight with his upright posture of a veteran of countless battlefields and the eyes of a star, seeking honor and fame.\nHe is the end of honor for knights. The king of knights, the one all knights should look up to and challenge.\nHow can anyone look at him and think of such a trick?\n“That’s three times. Will you do it again?”\n-…….\nThe third death.\nA casual observer would have said that the armor would have stopped it anyway but Dulahan knew that if this man wanted to kill him, he could have done so at any time.\nThis knight, the idol of all knights, had taught him and honored him therefore Dulahan could not help but be impressed by the knight.\nThis knight, this Lionheart King…treats his demotion to commander with honor.\nHe had great powers as a Commander Knight since Commander Armor canceled 80% of all physical damage, black magic and many other powerful powers he gained as a Commander Knight but he didn’t want to use any of them.\nHe just wanted to be a knight, straight and true, clashing sword to sword, without any sorcery.\nAgain and again, again and again, he wanted to cross swords with this man just as he had done with other knights of renown who had once roamed the world with honor but are now forgotten.\n“Ten times. Your swordsmanship is becoming more and more sophisticated. Have you managed to retrieve your memories?”\nDulahan realized the knight’s intentions.\nHe was treating him as a knight, not as a wretched servant of a warlock, and restoring him to his glory days.\n“What more can you do, knight?”\nDulahan had the skeletons bring him his head, then he dropped to one knee and offered it up. It was the perfect surrender, putting himself at their disposal.\n“Excellent. I am pleased to see your honor restored.”\nLeon placed his hands on Dulahan’s head with both hands and spoke in a pious voice.\n“I will pray for you. If there is a god you believe in, may he give your soul rest. If not, may the Goddess guide you to the edge of the garden.”\nNo matter how long he spent killing or how many times he fought without honor.\n“May we meet at the table of the gods, fine knight.”\nDulahan was overwhelmed by this knight who treated him as a knight, prayed for him, and blessed him.\n“Let there be light.”\nLeon’s hand glowed and Dulahan sensed the warm glow guiding him.\nIn his final moments, Dulahan destroyed all the skeletons and bowed in worship to Leon.\n-Glory be to Leon Dragonia Lionheart!\nHis silent reverence echoed through the dungeon.\n* * * *\nDungeon Boss Commander Knight Dulahan has fallen.\nNormally, that’s not the end of the story because even after defeating the boss, if there were any monsters left, you’d need to take some time to clean them up.\n“He… kept his promise.”\n“Gee, he really did…end it in a duel.”\nIn his final moment Dulahan destroyed the skeletons’ army with his own will.\nSincerely subdued, he bowed to Leon in worship, accepting his fate.\n“What was that light just now? I thought he said, ‘Let there be light’.”\n“Isn’t that ……divine power?”\nThere is no divine power among the Awakened. Even the survivors, who have claimed that gods exist, have been unable to provide evidence of their existence.\nBut the power that Leon had just used to cleanse Dulahan once and for all was inexplicable unless it was the holy power of the gods, the natural enemies of the undead and demons of novels and comics.\n“Uh… if you have such a skill, why don’t you use it?”\nHa-ri couldn’t say it out loud, but she said what anyone would have thought.\n“Then this honorable knight will meet his end as a Commander.”\nTo remind Dulahan of his knighthood? To accept his own death?\n“A knight is by nature a man of honor and reputation. Honor comes from deeds, and deeds come from the discipline of the will. A noble knight would have done just that.”\nHa-ri didn’t fully understand Leon’s words but there was so much she wanted to talk about like the uncertain possibilities, the harm that could come from failure, irrational behavior and illogical arguments that don’t calculate risk but it didn’t seem necessary to say it out loud because this man, even with all that he knew, would act as if it was natural.\nHe uses emotion instead of reason and intuition instead of logic, that’s something many know but not many can follow.\n“Hmm, now let’s go take the spoils.”\n“Uh… what?”\n“If there has been a battle, then there must be spoils, so lead the way. You’ll have to figure out what’s valuable.”\nThat day, as the dungeon closed, the Association Hunters received unexpected loot.\n[Dulahan’s Cloak]\n[Dulahan’s Greatsword]\n[Commander’s Gem]\nOther items were hastily picked up after the dungeon boss died.\n“Wow, look at this gem, it’s got a lot of magic power in it, even if it’s fake, it’ll be worth a lot if we sell it──”\n“It’s a piece of trash. This stuff will only cause trouble.”\n[Knight’s Cloak], [Dulahan’s Greatsword], magic stones and more. Although there was some commotion during the looting process, the clearing of the Hunan Plains Gate was a success.\nNot only did they cleanse the plains of miasma pollution and perfectly handled the scarlet-ranked gate, they also witnessed an incredible miracle in the form of the Blessed Rice.\nThe Firebird Guild and Yong-wan gritted their teeth and returned home, but for now, it was time to celebrate with everyone. However, the problem came from an unexpected source.\n“I… Your Majesty, don’t you have to pay taxes?”\n“Uh-huh! How can a king tax the king of another country? This is my own spoils, and it is against the law to tax it!”\n“Ah, no, you don’t have to pay the tax in cash; you can substitute the tax with a magic stone from that loot…….”\n“Kings don’t count coins. How can you argue with a king about what lesser men should do?”\n“Then, your majesty, what shall we report to the president?!”\n“There is nothing to report; it is better that we respect each other’s honor.”\n“You mean you won’t pay a penny in taxes?”\n“Stop talking about coins. It’s demeaning.”\nThe staff of the Hunter Association looked at Leon, who was arguing back and forth, and thought in unison.\n‘This bastard…isn’t he even worse than the Firebird Guild?’",

      "content": "Chapter: 10 Chivalry (3)\nHunter Association headquarters in South Korea.\nThere, a single topic dominated the meetings of the assembled executive staff, from the chief level and above.\n“Leon Dragonia Lionheart…what kind of name is that? I mean, he emerged from the black gate and…….”\n“He decapitated an Archdemon with a single blow…Is this the report you guys want me to believe?”\n“Survivors vary in strength, so it’s not impossible. There were cases before weren’t there?”\n“What else did you find out, God? Wasn’t that magic to make the crops grow?”\n“He also assisted in the capture of the Hunan Plains Gate?”\n“That’s good to know.”\nThe black gate that appeared in the middle of Seoul passed uneventfully through information control but the problem is that a survivor was found inside the black gate.\nThe Association approached the survivor very cautiously.\n“Chief Kim Jin-soo, I heard that you’ve been watching him the last few days. He even helped us attack the Hunan Plains.”\nOh Kang-hyuk, president of the Hunter Association, asked Kim Jin-soo.\n“Yes, sir. Director.”\n“What kind of person is he?”\nKim Jin-soo thought for a long time, which was unusual for him to answer a question from his superiors.\n“Well… I don’t know.”\nHis conclusion was as vague as it was troublesome.\n“You’re not sure?”\n“Not…evil…but rather just.”\nOf that, he was sure.\n“But his values are very different from ours. He is basically like medieval lords…….”\n“That’s troubling.”\n“I wish he was more modern.”\nTheir reactions were understandable because while a significant number of survivors are integrating into society, an equally significant number are not.\nThe lower the level of civilization, the more likely it is that they were the ruling class or due to racial differences.\nThe survivors were unable to integrate into society, causing all sorts of social problems.\nIf they were just a nuisance to society, they would be ignored, but there were many survivors who were just as powerful as the Awakened.\nIn short, even if a madman comes out, the problem is that the madman’s too powerful.\n“Hmm… In terms of ideas and etiquette, it’s best to be cautious and match him as closely as possible.”\n“Yeah, but he can be surprisingly smooth. He seems to understand your culture.”\nThat was because Leon was originally an Earthling but he was currently pretending to be from a completely different planet, so he could act a little unreasonable.\nFor Chief Kim, who doesn’t know that, Leon appears understanding and in terms of abilities, Leon was surprisingly impressive.\n“The part about descending gods…tell me more.”\nLeon’s miracle at the Hunan Plains Gate appeared on a personal YouTuber’s livestream, but he stopped the livestream for fear of confusion.\n“Yes, Demera, the goddess of fertility and life, possessed a straw puppet, and it appears they actually had a conversation.”\nIt was also captured on video. Somehow, the straw man’s voice was inaudible, but it was clear that the straw man had moved.\n“You don’t think she was just using some sort of telekinesis?”\n“A goddess, that’s ridiculous.”\nMost of the officers dismissed it with the same words. A goddess was too much of a stretch.\n“But there’s evidence…….”\n“Couldn’t it just be some kind of magical effect? The rice grew because God blessed it? That’s ridiculous.”\n“If there’re demons, why not gods?”\nOpinions were divided within the Association, but there was one consensus.\n“The rice must be good.”\nWith Leon’s blessing, the rice grew rapidly. But that’s not all. The land contaminated with miasma was instantly purified as the rice grew.\nThe mere fact that the land was cleaned of miasma was shocking enough, but when the test results showed that each and every one of the rice was a rare grade, the room was once again in an uproar.\n“Rice that can heal cancer patients and give long-lasting buffs…….”\nThis ability is as remarkable as Leon’s brute strength. No, maybe even more so.\nOrdinary potions made by potion masters only lasted for three hours, and they cost millions, so even large guilds were wary of using them.\nHowever, this rice keeps the buff longer than potions and can stack up to three times if they are of different types.\nIf utilized properly, this meant that every hunter at the gate would only need to take one or two doses to stay buffed.\n“I’ll have Leon Drago…Nia Lionheart weigh in on that.”\n“Yes, sir. And about the subsidy for survivors…….”\n“Maximum. Give him whatever he wants, we need to bring him into our organization.”\nEven as he spoke, Oh Kang-hyuk was unsure of himself.\nSince the Firebird Guild was present at the scene this information shouldn’t be theirs alone. At the very least, the Firebird Guild knows about Leon’s abilities.\nIt’s only a matter of time before the Ten Guilds find out about Leon the Survivor.\nWill the Association be able to compete with them? Oh Kang-hyuk sighed as he looked at the remaining budget for the year.\n“I…But, Mr. President. There’s one thing Survivor Leon asked for.”\n“What is it? Whatever he says, I’ll listen.”\n“It’s…….”\nKim Jin-soo hesitated, as if he didn’t know what to say, then said it with difficulty.\n“I need to meet with the President.”\n“What? Why?”\n“Because he’ll be living in our country so it’s only natural for a king to greet a king…….”\n“???”\n* * * *\nIt’s been four days since Leon returned to Earth.\nHe’s been staying in a five-star suite in Seoul. Initially, the Hunter’s Association had offered him a place to stay, but he immediately rejected them.\n“It’s not a battlefield,” he said, “and there’s no beauty in the king’s bedroom!”\nIn short, it’s not classy.\nHe demanded a room with the finest bed, servants at his beck and call, and art to admire at all times.\nEventually, in the middle of the night, Ha-ri went around to the five-star hotels and asked for a compromise. They could rent a suite and decorate it with paintings and pottery pieces.\n“Your Majesty… please let me sleep!”\nAt two in the morning Ha-ri asked Leon to let her sleep, mimicking the pleas she had seen in historical dramas.\n“Hmm…….”\nLeon backed down from the request since he didn’t want to pester the bureaucrat too much.\nThe next morning, Ha-ri was in charge of room service.\n“Your Majesty, Ha-ri is here!”\n-Come in.\nHa-ri swiped his room card to open the door and pushed a tray of breakfast in front of her.\n“I hope you’re feeling better after your journey.”\n“Morning.”\nHa-ri set the food down herself.\nThe meal was a short rib banh sung that cost over 100,000 won. The ribs, marinated in spices and grilled with the finest Korean beef, made her drool.\n“Have you had breakfast?”\n“Not yet.”\n“Eat when you can. Don’t go hungry.”\n“Yeah….”\nWhen Leon had finished eating, Ha-ri decided she should get a sandwich from the café on the first floor.\nHave a seat.”\nLeon invited her to take a seat.\n“Your Majesty…!”\nHe asked her if she had a meal and offered her a seat. Apparently, he was going to share his meal out of consideration for her.\nHa-ri searches for chopsticks with a touching gaze.\n“What are you doing?”\n“What?”\n“I asked, what are you doing with these ribs, instead of making them edible?”\n“Ugh…….”\nHa-ri bent her head down and tried to separate the bone from the flesh of the spiced ribs.\n……\n…\nAfter checking out, Ha-ri drove away with Leon and as they were moving to their destination, she began to explain things.\n“The Hunter’s Association has decided to provide you with a grant and resettlement assistance. They will take you to a place where you will be comfortable, though not as comfortable as the royal palace.”\n“That is very considerate of them. When do you think the President of the Republic of Korea will be free?”\n“Ah, well, that’s… there’s the matter of our security, and──”\n“Do you think this king has no honor and would assassinate the president? A king does not kill a king!”\n“Oh, no, we don’t!”\nShe didn’t think Leon would ever try to kill the President, but she thought they couldn’t assure the President’s safety by saying ‘I think so’.\nLeon is a force to be reckoned with, even for an S-class hunter, and it wouldn’t be surprising to see the worst disaster in Korean political history if he were to act unexpectedly.\n“I’ve already told your majesty that land in the capital is very expensive, so your majesty will be much more cramped than when you lived in the royal palace. Do you think you’ll be okay?”\nAt first, she thought she’d try to find a decent apartment in Seoul. Rent support for survivors with a high assessment totaled 15 million won for a year.\nOf course, if you think about it, $1.3 million a month for an apartment would be a palace for a modern man, but Leon was a king.\nHe had his own royal palace, with hundreds of rooms and just one of which must have been enormous.\nThey would have to give him the Blue House or Gyeongbokgung Palace to match his aesthetic. Of course, this was impossible.\n“As a guest, how can I be extravagant?”\nHa-ri didn’t mention that the Hunter Society had lobbied to have the museum’s artwork removed to accommodate Leon’s request. Nor did they tell him that the housing allotted to him now was the private vacation home of Oh Kang-hyuk, the president of the Hunter Association.\nThe Hunter Association was trying to accommodate Leon’s demanding tastes.\n“Your Majesty, speaking of which, the distribution of the loot.”\n“I’ve ordered that you handle that yourself. But I like the cloak, so leave it alone.”\n“Yes…….”\nIn the end, it was decided that the loot from the Hunan Plains Gate would be exempt from taxes as a special case.\nTechnically, they were saying, “We don’t have any loot from the Hunan Plains!”\nIt was a better deal than the Firebird Guild and the other ten guilds, but Leon hadn’t listened to the Association staff. He insisted that if he could speak to the king of the country, the president, he would be more likely to listen to him, and eventually the Association agreed to arrange a meeting with the president in secret.\nUntil then, Leon would be granted immunity and tax exemption from all charges.\nThe loot allocated to Leon was Dulahan’s Greatsword, Dulahan’s Cloak, and $5 million worth of the $10 million worth of magic stones that had been mined in the haste to close the dungeon.\nIn fact most of the loot was given to Leon but since he had actually closed the dungeon on his own none of the staff had any complaints.\n“Your Majesty, we arrived.”\nThey arrived at an office building in Bundang. It’s a high-end office building that’s close to the Hunter’s Association and has a helicopter on the rooftop, so it’s favored by the Hunters.\nThe lobby is just as lavish as the rest of the building as the elaborate framed prints and contemporary artworks on display create a convincing atmosphere.\n“Those little paintings are the best.”\nLeon’s aesthetic didn’t make sense of some of the artwork.\n“Ms. Han Ha-ri of the Hunter Association?”\nIt was then that a well-dressed man in a business suit spoke to the two as they made their way to the lobby.\n“Who are you?”\nHa-ri was wary of the man who spoke to them as if he had been waiting for them. It was a secret that they were coming to this office building.\n“Haha, what a coincidence. I’m Park Jong-chan, director of Doojeong Group, Doojeong Future Food.”\n“Doojeong Group?”\nDoojeong Group was one of the top three conglomerates in Korea, so why would a director of such a conglomerate be waiting for them under the guise of coincidence?\n“Ah… You must be the famous ‘survivor’ these days, nice to meet you Leon Dragonia Lionheart.”\nHe had already figured it all out.\nHa-ri’s heart sank at the sight of Mr. Park, Leon, on the other hand, stared in disbelief at Park’s hand as he shook his.\n“A merchant…shook this king’s hand?”",

      "content": "Chapter 11: A merchant…shook this king’s hand?\nDoojeong Group was one of South Korea’s most prominent conglomerates.\nFrom instant noodles to missiles, it has dabbled in every industry in South Korea, and while some have failed and others have succeeded, Doojeong influence in South Korea and the world is not insignificant.\nThe business that has been most affected by the gate is the food industry.\nCountless granaries in China’s Huabei Plain, Egypt’s Nile Delta, and elsewhere have been abandoned due to miasma contamination from dungeon breaks.\nThirty years ago, there were no reagents to decontaminate miasma contamination, so this contamination caused permanent damage and, of course, food shortages on a global scale.\nGovernments had to find alternative sources of food for the abandoned grain fields and heavily supported domestic companies in this regard.\nDoojeong Future Food is a large company that has come to account for a third of the domestic food industry thanks to the government’s full support.\nPark Jong Chan, the managing director of such a company, is a person who can carry the weight of the world on his shoulders and he has never been looked down upon by anyone.\n“A merchant….shook this king’s hand?”\nFor a moment, he thought he’d misheard.\nIn the modern world, businessmen are the most respected members of society. They control vast amounts of capital, move power, and even change laws.\nIf you’re the managing director of a major company like Doojeong Group, you can’t be messed with by any high-ranking hunter or congressman.\nWhat was this look and tone of voice that belittles and demeans such a person and the business itself?\nEven the association’s female staff is staring in disbelief at this shocking statement.\nPark Jong Chan doesn’t let his expression crumble, and he smiles a business smile.\n“Haha, Survivor Leon, you seem to be unfamiliar with modern Earth civilization. In modern times, being an entrepreneur is very different from being a merchant in the old days…….”\n“How dare you, a lowly merchant, speak ill of royalty. This king has never authorized you to speak.”\nWhat, is he crazy?\nPark Jong Chan had met a few survivors on business, but he’d never been looked at with such disdain.\n“I, Your Majesty… In our world, businessmen are a highly respected profession…….”\nLeon’s voice trailed off in disbelief.\n“Businessmen are essentially crooks who sell their dignity and self-respect for profit. They exploit loopholes in the law and are proud of it.”\nThere was no denying it: Doojeong Future Foods was immediately criticized for tax evasion, illegal unionization, and excessive profit-seeking but other businessmen were no different.\n“Even if the world is different, it won’t change the nature and fundamentals of business. How can those with lowly tongues and lowly natures stand face to face with noble royalty?”\n“Hmmm…….”\n“I have nothing more to hear.”\nAfter delivering the last of his insults and disrespect, Leon strode nonchalantly past Park Jong Chan and Ha-ri followed closely behind as Park Jong Chan was stunned and speechless as he watched.\n“What, what…….?”\n* * * *\n“This is where Your Majesty will be staying.”\n“Well, it’s nice.”\nIn the modern world, a 50-square-foot office apartment is more than enough for a single person, but for Leon, it was nothing compared to his royal palace.\nStill, he wasn’t in the mood to argue, given his Earthly origins and the fact that he was used to sleeping on the streets.\n“This place is provided to you by the Association for a year. You don’t have to worry about rent or maintenance, the association will take care of that.”\nHa-ri explains to Leon, who nods. She adds that there is also room service and a cleaning service that is paid for by the Association.\n‘Huh… That’s good.’\nIt was fortunate for Ha-ri, who is a member of the Hunter Association, that Leon passed by Jong Chan Park, the executive director of Future Foods.\nInformation about survivors is usually classified and like North Korean defectors, those from remote societies are kept in quarantine for three months for training.\nBut in a completely different world, the gap must be enormous. Normally, they would have to be quarantined and trained gradually, but if they wanted to quarantine Leon right away, there would be an uproar.\n“But what is the matter that brings him to Your Majesty?”\n“Where would merchants go? He must be after profit.”\nProfit? What kind of profit would the executive director of Doojeong Group want from Leon…Ha-ri slapped her knee.\n“It’s the rice, isn’t it? That blessed rice from the Hunan plains…….”\nThe situation was so urgent that there was no information control and an internet broadcaster had filmed it.\n“It must be Mr. Park, the farmer…?”\nShe searched on YouTube and found a video of Mr. Park. Apparently, the Association had taken the video down and issued a warning…\n“What? He posted again?!”\n* * * *\nMr. Park, a farmer, was depressed because his latest video had been taken down.\nThe shocking scene was filmed in real time in front of the Hunan Plains and the land that was obviously contaminated with miasma was cleaned in an instant.\n“Did you see that, brothers, the rice… the rice… the rice… it grew like a bang?!”\n-What? What?\n-Magic?\n-Was he a mage from the Tower? Did he use some kind of rapid growth spell?\n-But even magic can grow plants on miasma-contaminated ground?\n-Maybe it’s a new technology we don’t know about.\nMr. Park, a farmer, knew all too well how amazing it was to see crops grow on contaminated ground.\nEven after the advent of miasma purification technology in the Magic Tower, it took a year or two of expensive reagents to purify the miasma -contaminated land.\nThinking of his neighbor, Mr. Jung, who went bankrupt because he couldn’t afford the reagents, Park swallowed hard at the miracle before him.\n-But the crops grown with magic are inedible anyway.\n-It’s enchanted, so it’s poisonous to normal people.\n-Even the Hunters would need a stomach wash after a few bites.\nBut soon, an amazing sight was witnessed. The Association’s employees were threshing rice and cooking it themselves!\n“Hey! What are you doing?”\nWhen he tried to get closer to see if they were really eating rice, he was chased away by the association staff, but later that evening he found the owner of the field, Mr. Kim.\n“Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim, did you get what I asked for?\n“Of course. The guys at the root Association said I shouldn’t take it out at all…….”\n“What kind of law is that? Aren’t you the owner of the field?”\n“That’s right…….”\n“Because rice grew on the miasma contaminated land the Association members ate a bowl of rice each.”\n“That’s right…….”\nMr. Park was curious enough to become a YouTuber, filming all kinds of wildlife in the countryside.\nThe land contaminated with miasma was cleaned up, and the crops grew in no time. How could he pass this on?\nHe wanted to post a video on YouTube but first he wanted to do a little experiment.\n“Let’s cook some rice and feed it to the neighborhood pig first.”\n“Hmmm…good idea.”\nTo test the waters, the two cooked up a small batch of rice.\nThe glossy, shiny rice was tempting to eat with torn kimchi, but they decided to test it on animals first, just in case.\n-Bam!\nThat’s when it happened. The rice was barely done cooking when an old dog came to the door.\n“Isn’t this Mr. Chen’s old dog?”\n“Yes, it is. Why is he here?”\nDolshun was a twelve years old dog. As is often the case with old animals, he suffered from arthritis, which led to lack of exercise and obesity.\nWhy is he here when he usually stays at home?\n-Thump! Thump!\n“No, Dolshun, why don’t you go home?”\nIt was then. Dolshun, who was looking at them from the doorway, suddenly stuck his head into the rice.\n“What the hell!”\n“Is Dolshun crazy?!”\nThe two men were furious, but soon became amused by Dolshun’s behavior.\n“You bastard, you can’t eat that!”\n“Why is he eating it all of a sudden?”\nIt was a big deal because Dolshun was a dog that Mr. Chen pampered and raised and he would be sad if he died from eating rice.\n“Spit it out! Spit it out!”\nMr. Park tried to open Dolshun’s mouth to spit out the rice, but Dolshun swallowed the rice as if his life depended on it.\n-Kung, kung, kung!\nDolshun jumped up and down with a thunderous sound. After scurrying around like a grasshopper, Dolshun immediately ran towards Mr. Chen’s house.\n“What?”\n“What the…….”\nIt was an old dog with arthritis that had trouble walking and only last week they saw Mr. Chen crying as he held Dolshun but what does that mean? It was as if he was getting healthy.\n“…….”\n“…….”\nMr. Park and Mr. Kim looked at each other, thinking the same thing as they immediately started making a new meal.\n“Ugh, chronic scoliosis?!”\n“It’s like my stuffy chest has been opened up!”\nThe miracles that happened there quickly spread throughout the village.\nMeanwhile, a similar phenomenon was taking place in the Doojeong Future Food Lab, where the Firebird Guild had set out to determine the identity of the rice.\n“What the hell am I looking at?”\n“How can such a dense energy be contained in a single grain of rice?”\nThe ‘Blessed Rice’ that had been sneaked through the Firebird Guild was cross-checked by the appraisers and found to be rare grade one by one.\n[Blessed Rice]\nGrade: Rare\nDescription: This rice is blessed with the divine power of Goddess Demera, the goddess of life and fertility.\nIt alleviates grade 3 diseases and if consumed continuously, there is a high chance of being cured.\n“Blessed rice? What the hell is it blessed with?”\n“Isn’t it magic? From what religion is Goddess Demera?”\n“If it’s a grade 3 disease, what does that mean?”\n“Something like early colon cancer.”\n“Damn it! Can you prove this? Test it on lab rats!”\nThe results of the experiment showed that the healing powers of the Blessed Rice were real as the mice that were dying from the constant consumption of the experimental crops were cured.\n“Yi, hurry up! We need to report to the top, and tell them to get as many seeds as possible!”\nThe report of the lab’s findings was sent to the upper management of Doojeong Future Food, and the managing director, Park Jong Chan, was immediately dispatched.\nIt wasn’t hard to find Leon, as Doojeong had planted eyes and ears in the Hunter Association.\n“A merchant….shook this king’s hand?”\nBut Leon ignored them, and Director Park Jong Chan returned with a grimace.\n“You arrogant savage!”\nMr. Park’s anger erupted like an active volcano as the researchers who had come to report to him squinted at the plaque he threw at them, but he didn’t care about them.\n“Hey. Those rice crops. Are you sure they’re effective?”\n“Yes, yes…! Yes, they are.”\n“You haven’t even done any clinical trials. If it works on rats, what guarantee do you have that it’ll work on humans?”\n“Well, it’s…….”\nThe secretary stepped in.\n“We went to the owner of that field to get as much of the seed as possible. But there──”\nThe secretary relayed what Mr. Park and Mr. Kim had experienced.\nA dog that was dying came back to life and after eating the rice and their chronic inflammation and rhinitis were cured. After that the whole village was cured of minor to major illnesses thanks to the rice.\n“We don’t have the clinical trial data… but it’s as good as proven.”\n“That’s a good thing.”\nMr. Park’s eyes lit up with greed. If he hadn’t trusted the appraisal in the first place, he wouldn’t have stepped forward.\nThe rice is a hot commodity that could change the world.\n“If only he wasn’t a crazy asshole.”\nThe problem was the survivor who held the secret to the rice.\nThe anachronistic barbarian survivor looked down on the director of the world-class Doojeong Group as a lowly businessman.\n“Mr. Director…we must have it, it has infinite power.”\n“I know.”\nThe rice that is said to cure cancer just by eating it would revolutionize not only food but also the medical world.\n“We’ll see… we’ll see.”\nSince he’s so demanding, I’ll have to ask for a meeting through the Association. I made a surprise visit before the Association restrained me, but it all went awry.\n“You don’t know anything about business in this country, do you?”\nHe was determined to punch this barbarian in the nose.\nSo many survivors of a stupid, foolish, barbaric civilization thought they were the best but when they saw the overwhelming scientific and productive power of modern civilization, they finally admitted that they were behind.\n“I see you’re making a big deal out of a little rice…I’ll represent Earth and show you the power of science.”\nPark smiled triumphantly.\n‘I’m going to overwhelm him with a culture shock.’",

      "content": "Chapter 12\nUpon returning to Earth, Leon had three goals.\nFirst, he wanted to spread the faith since there are no true gods here.\nIf Jehovah, Buddha, Allah and the countless devas the Hindus speak of were real at least some of their saints would’ve joined the fight against the demons.\nBut there were no priests or saints endowed with divine powers, whether cardinals, priests, or fanatics chanting Allahu Akbar in the 2030s.\nBy its very nature, the destruction of demons requires the most powerful force of all, holy power, and yet not a shred of that power exists?\n‘There are no gods that transmit divine power to the priests of cathedrals and mosques.’\nIn essence, God gives his grace through faith.\nIf you think about what happened in the plains of Hunan right now, the concept of the land being polluted and a bad year coming is wrong.\nHow can a land that has been worshiped and blessed by the goddess of life and abundance be polluted, and how can the god of rain and clouds send down rain, and how can there be a bad year?\nJust look at the crops.\nRice, which has been improved and grown with the best technology of the 21st century, cannot cure even a small tumor inside the body?\nDoes it make sense to expect people to go through the barbaric practice of healing in hospitals instead of sanctuaries because they can’t cure a single tumor?\nThe problem is getting sick in the first place. If they had been eating the crops Demera had blessed, they could not have gotten sick.\nHealing is reserved for soldiers wounded on the battlefield or cursed by evil cultists.\nTo harness holy power, Leon had to spread the faith.\nLeon managed to deal with the issue in Hunan Plains using the holy power he had but for what was to come, he would need great power.\nHis world ultimately fell to the demons because there were no more believers.\nThe second was the rebuilding of the Holy Knights.\nIn this world, there is no group that fights using holy power.\nIf the Grail Guardian, the Lionheart King, is a demigod, the Holy Knights are the next level below him, living saints. They are the knights of the gods who use the Holy Law.\nThey fought to the last man and as they ascended their holy power kept Leon alive.\nThe Holy Knights of Arianna, the goddess of light and justice.\nSir Jenkins, the Guardian of the Sea, who guarded the harbor and served Poma, the god of the sea and waves.\nSir Genoa, Knight of the Flame, who served Petos, the god of war and fire.\nAnak, a holy maiden who supported the knights with the light of Demera, the goddess of life and fertility.\nAs empires crumbled along with the great forests of the elves and the underground cities of the dwarves the Holy Knights continued to slay demons. They were the terror of the demons.\nThe third purpose was to annihilate the evils that installed themselves upon this land.\nHe had to restore divinity by spreading faith, and to train Holy Knights in the harmony and order of a proper pantheon.\nPerhaps it’s too much to hope for super-powered saints called Holy Knights to emerge from the lowly unbelievers and ignorant commoners however Leon Dragonia Lionheart will do what he had to do.\n“Your Majesty, there is someone who has duly requested an audience.”\n“Hmm… If the formalities have been followed, there is no reason why I shouldn’t meet him.”\nLeon guessed who it was and allowed him to come.\n* * * *\nDirector Park Jong-chan realized that the survivor named Leon was very much like him.\nThe way the man from the barbarian civilization acted like he was royalty and puffed himself up was a bit much for him, a modern-day Earth aristocrat. But apart from that, he coveted Leon’s abilities.\nHe could make crops grow in an instant, but they were still fit for human consumption.\nWhat’s more, his powers are not ordinary. Curing cancer is one thing, but when he found out that Leon can also clean up land contaminated with miasma, he was blown away.\nThis is a man we must have in our company.\n“Thank you for allowing me to meet with you, Your Majesty.”\nFor the sake of corporate profits, he bowed to the barbarian for a moment.\n“This is a small gift from my company to your majesty.”\nAccompanied by his secretaries, he presented the gift to Leon. It was a weapon closet made by a master craftsman from the Doojeong Guild, one of the top ten guilds in Korea.\nJong-chan planned to dazzle the barbarian with the splendor of the finest goods inside.\n‘Once you taste it, you’ll never go back. I’ll make you beg me to let you join our company.’\nMr. Park was looking forward to the reaction of Han Ha-ri and Leon, who would be stunned by the enormity of the gift. But…….\n“Okay, I’ll take you up on your offer.”\n“You’ll take it?\nWhat’s with that attitude? It’s like I’m the one who has to accept it.\nThe arrogance made Mr. Park’s teeth chatter, but he managed to keep a business smile on his face.\n“Ha, why don’t you check it out, I’m sure you’ll like it.”\n“Tsk… I can’t be bothered to explain manners to an inferior being. Han Ha-ri, open it.”\nLeon insists that Ha-ri open the gift, trying to make him feel even more annoyed.\nHa-ri immediately unwrapped it and swallowed hard.\n“What is this?!”\nThe neatly made closet expanded to reveal a weapons display with dozens of items on the shelves.\n“These are the latest and greatest from our group. I hope you can pick out whatever you like.”\n“These are unique grade armor made by the Doojeong Guild’s own master?”\nThese were unique grade armor made by the Doojeong Guild, a top ten Korean guild controlled by the Doojeong Group. They were so expensive that even high-ranking Hunters would go out of their way to get them, even if they didn’t have the money.\n“I heard that you’re going to be a hunter in the future, so these items will be of great help to you.”\nHearing those words, Ha-ri found it difficult to breathe.\nThe armors crafted by the Doojeong Guild’s master craftsmen were ultra-luxury items that cost a billion each.\nUnless you were lucky enough to get one in the gate, it was one of the finest things you could ever acquire through normal means.\nHa-ri swallowed hard at the sight of the Unique Sword, which she had only seen on a video throughout her time at the Academy.\n“What am I supposed to use such a lowly weapon for?”\n“Lowly?”\n“Your Majesty, what do you mean, lowly?!”\nLeon’s demeanor stunned Ha-ri. Even though he was an Otherworlder, how could he have such an attitude when he saw this pamphlet’s picture?\n“These, these are top-of-the-line items manufactured from compressed alloys using the most advanced magical engineering techniques. You can’t get anything like this anywhere else──”\nMr. Park was trying to explain how much technology had been applied to the items he had brought, and how expensive the materials were.\nEven the most savage of savages could understand what he was talking about. But Leon had a different perspective.\n“How can you make a greatsword that is not bathed in the light of the stars or blessed by the gods, and your armor is only used to hunt beasts?”\nWhat does he mean, he wants us to dry the weapons in the sun like pepper and recite a prayer or something?\nUnknown to him, he was right on the money.\n“Anyway, compared to my holy sword and holy spear, they’re just toys. Tsk, tsk…How dare you bring something that hasn’t even been blessed?”\n‘You, you barbarian!’\nEvery survivor thinks that their world is the best.\nThe dwarves as a craftsman race had a lot of pride but their pride crumbled before the materials and metallurgy of modern civilization.\nNo matter how many times a dwarven master forged a steel sword, it would bend before a normal longsword forged in a factory with modern technology and magical engineering.\n“Hah, hah… You must be very confident in your sword, Your Majesty.”\n“I was merely stating the obvious.”\nLeon summoned a sword from nowhere.\nSubspace magic? But I didn’t sense any magical energy.\nIt was an old iron sword that was missing a tooth here and there, worn out and unable to cut anything.\nJong-chan wanted to ask what he could do with such a piece of junk, but when his gaze met Leon, he was speechless.\n“You are full of distrust in this king.”\n“Oh, you misunderstand.”\n“It’s not uncommon for merchants to bring me things. It’s like using a cattle prod for a chicken, but I’ll show you what I can do.”\nAlthough thrilled, Mr. Park was troubled.\nShould I show him the difference in power and crush his confidence, or should I give him a modest defeat and make him feel good?\nHow dare they devalue the Doojeong Group’s technical capabilities?\nMr. Park felt he needed to take the initiative.\n‘Barbarian, I’ll show you what real technology is.’\nHe couldn’t help but smile as he continued.\n“In that case… I’d like to sample the brilliance of Your Majesty’s sword, eh, Deputy Han Ha-ri?”\n“Yes…….”\n“Would you like to try out any of the armaments that catch your fancy?”\nHa-ri glanced at Leon and when he nodded, she gripped the sword she’d admired for four years, the Dawnbreaker of Master Park Jin-cheol.\nIt had been forged for ten days in a special gate, bathed in the intense energy of the sun, and its strength was unparalleled. Its special ability, Sunlight, has the melting power to melt even the strongest special alloys and with her fire blessing, it’s a perfect match.\n“Can I really…wield this?”\n“Why bother asking an adult’s permission to wield a toy?”\n‘That asshole is going all the way to…….’\nMr. Park’s fever seemed to reach the top of his head, but he waited for the refreshing cider that was just around the corner.\nHolding her dream weapon, she admired it and worried that Leon’s weapon might break, but she couldn’t do anything about it.\nShe activated the Dawnbreaker special function, and the blade turned red as a fierce energy enveloped him.\n“Then… here we go!”\nThe sword she swung with all her might collided with Leon’s old iron sword, with the result being──\n-Bang!\nHa-ri sword broke.\n“Huh?”\n“Uh…….”\nHa-ri, Mr. Park, and the secretary shook their heads while Leon was the only one with a free expression as he looked at the severed sword.\n“You really did bring something useful as a toothpick. Put it away.”\nWhat the hell is going on?\nMr. Park’s head was spinning at what was happening in front of him.\nThe Dawnbreaker was a weapon of supreme cutting power that could easily cut through the hides and bones of high-level monsters. It was the most powerful weapon they could create, containing the essence of the Doojeong Group’s technology.\n‘That is a high-grade weapon?’\nThat old sword, no way.\nSurvivors would occasionally bring over the world’s best weapon, a High Grade weapon, but it was still the best they could do.\nAn old, toothless sword like that couldn’t possibly be such a weapon…….\n“I’ll cut your time short. You have three minutes to finish what you have to say.”\n“Ah, no… that, that… no?”\nThis was supposed to be a steamroller, but how did this happen?\nMr. Park tried to say something, but the words wouldn’t come out of his mouth, and it wasn’t until his secretary shook his shoulder that he finally came to his senses.\nYeah… gifts are just a way to buy goodwill. It’s a shame that a billion-dollar weapon was destroyed, but that’s not what matters now.\n“Les, Leon, Your Majesty’s──”\n“What kind of courtesy is it for a lowly tradesman to speak of this king’s dignity?”\n“Ugh…Your Majesty.”\nHis clenched teeth made a sound like they were about to crack. He had never been so disrespected and belittled in his life.\n“Your Majesty…Doojeong Group would like the exclusively purchase the rice you grew.”\n“The crops that I grew? Did you think I was a farmer?”\n“Ah, no, we just want to secure the seeds of the crops that His Majesty has allowed to grow in the Hunan Plains and grow them ourselves.”\n“Hmph… You’re going to convert? That’s the most pleasant thing to come out of your mouth.”\n“What?”\nWhat the hell do you mean, convert?\n“That crop grows in a land blessed by priests who serve the gods of life and fertility. You intend to become one of those priests. I see you’re quite ambitious for such a frivolous subject.”\n“Oh, no, that’s not it.”\n“Huh?”\nFinding it difficult to follow Leon’s words, Jong-chan saw no point in continuing so he went straight to the point.\n“We want to take over the patent rights to the seeds of that rice.”\n“Excuse me?”\nLeon’s eyes sharpened and Mr. Park hastened to add a condition.\n“Of course, it will come at a price. By our management’s calculations…. It was thought to be worth 180 billion won.”\nIt was a steal, of course. There’s no way the seeds of a super rice that can cure cancer are worth only 180 billion won. But if he explained the value of 180 billion won to this ignorant barbarian, his eyes would probably roll.\n“You mean you want to buy seeds with money?”\n“That’s right, of course, but you’ll have to sign a contract stating that only Doojeong Future Foods can distribute it exclusively. Oh, and if you want, I can raise the price a bit more, depending on the negotiations──”\nMr. Park was looking forward to seeing how he could toy with this barbarian.\nUndervalue the seeds, act as if he had nothing to lose, and bamboozle him with difficult explanations of the law and complicated distribution networks.\nAs a natural businessman, Jong Chan had a knack for devaluing his opponents and adding to his own value. But──\n“How dare this lowly businessman blaspheme the divine!?”\nHe didn’t know that in front of him was standing the representative of all divinity and the most devout religious man.",

      "content": "Chapter 13: Medieval Taxation\n“How dare you, you lowly tradesman, blaspheme the divine!”\nLeon’s thunderous tirade was no mere rebuke.\nThis was the most exalted being in the mortal realm and words spoken by a living saint and demigod are magical in their own right.\nThe fury he unleashed in his rage was not something a normal human could withstand.\n“Huh…!”\nHer eardrums are shaking and her mind is foggy. Her heart raced as she felt the wrath of an unimaginable divine agent but despite his incomprehensible rage, she understood one thing.\nThe life and death of the Doojeong Group and its managing director… Park Jong-chan, depended on the otherworldly man in front of her.\n“Your Majesty!”\nAt that moment, Ha-ri, sensing the danger, stood in front of Leon, her legs trembling as she forced herself to not fall.\n“Your Majesty, if you kill him, we’ll be in…trouble!”\nBeing a survivor is not a license to get away with anything. Understanding Leon’s culture and class is one thing, but committing a crime is another.\nOf course, Leon’s value is not comparable to that of a managing director of a major national company, but even so, this was not it.\n“Hmm. Don’t be mistaken, this king is not a fool that runs around.”\nWith that, Ha-ri, Park, and the rest of the staff breathed a sigh of relief. Director Park broke out in a cold sweat.\n“Foolish one, you’ve made your sins known.”\n“Yes, yes? No, I…….”\nWhat the hell had he done wrong? He’d tried to slap a price on it. But how could a savage who had been on Earth for less than a week know that?\nFeeling wronged, Mr. Park cautiously pleaded.\n“I, I really don’t know what’s wrong.”\n“Heh… How can you be so ignorant and clueless?”\nAt this point, Leon’s eyes held pity, not contempt.\n“The crops come from the land blessed by Demera. It is a gift bestowed by the goddess upon the farmers who toil and cultivate the fields.”\nHumans cannot survive alone. When there is a bad harvest they would starve and when they are hungry they must go to work in the fields.\nThey dig up the soil and steal the seeds from the earth.\n“Therefore, those who are farmers should be grateful for the blessings of the land and thankful to the Divine for its creation.”\nFaith, divinity, and divine grace is not something that can be bought with gold, but is bestowed upon a grateful heart and faith.\n“Thou art a lowly thing, deceiving others for the sake of petty profit. How dost thou seek to profit from the product of a divinity thou hast no faith in?”\n“Profit…!”\nDirector Park Jong-chan gritted his teeth and backed away. As he walked away, apparently in a wait-and-see manner, Ha-ri expressed concern.\n“Is it…going to be okay? He may be a lowly trader in Your Majesty’s eyes, but… he’s quite influential.”\n“Hmph. Not even worth bothering with.”\nLeon is not dismissive of the influence of businessmen.\nBusinesses play a huge role in modern civilization and they have spread their influence far and wide in the soil of capitalism.\n“Ten thousand temples carry a burden, but it’s not a burden that can shake this king.”\nThere was an overwhelming confidence in him. No, it was beyond confidence.\nHe was the chosen one, the king recognized by the heavens, a living proof of the Divine Right of Kings. The Emperor of the Empire, the Steel Dwarves of the Underground City, and the Guardians of the Forest recognize the demigod’s authority.\nOnly the self-indulgent take the agents of the gods lightly.\nIn the world of divinity to come, they will be excluded and relegated so it is not worth dealing with the ignorant and unintelligible.\n“By the way, have you done what I said to prepare?”\n“Uhm…You mean…the issue of the faith?”\n“Yes. It wouldn’t hurt the country, of course.”\nHa-ri remembered Leon’s request not long ago, and of course, the Hunter’s Association flipped.\n“Actually, Director Park Jong-chan contacted me before his visit, saying he had some suitable land…….”\nIf Leon could solve this problem, there was no reason why the Hunter’s Association couldn’t help, especially since the President was happy to see it.\n* * * *\nSince the gate crisis, humanity has lost tons of arable land.\nCountries have been overwhelmed with responding to gates in urban centers and have failed to discover gates in rural and remote areas.\nAs a result, many gates have caused dungeon breaks, and much land has been contaminated.\nThe only reason humanity hasn’t had a severe food crisis in recent years is purely because of the amount of people dying. And some of the plains that failed to be dealt with have been permanently contaminated, creating countless displaced people.\nThe Naju Plain, where Choi had spent his entire life plowing fields, was one of them.\n“Dad, do you see nothing but fields again from the morning breeze?”\n“…….”\nDespite his son’s question, Choi remained silent and looked at his land contaminated by miasma.\nToday, Choi is a government-subsidized assistant at a supermarket in town, but until five years ago, he was a farmer in Naju.\nHe had spent his entire life herding cows and driving tractors but five years ago, a failed red gate triggered a dungeon break, and the entire Naju plain was contaminated with miasma.\nThe contamination was so intense that many farmers, including Choi, lost their land.\n“Haa…….”\nNothing can be done on land contaminated with miasma and ordinary people were contaminated just by stepping on it, and only hunters could survive.\nNo one wants to buy land that doesn’t grow crops and although there were government subsidies based on the size of the land, they were pennies on the dollar.\nThey’ve been buying reagents to clean up the miasma from the Tower, but even that has its limits. The reagents were unable to cleanse the land of excessive contamination.\nThe next new reagent will work, and the next one will be better…\nChoi spent his fortune to buy the reagents from the Tower, even though he was now the only one who kept trying.\n“Give up now. It’s a land that even the leaders can’t do anything about.”\n“Shut up! I fed you and your brothers with rice grown on that land, I sent you to college, what kind of land is that, it’s the land I worked my whole life!”\nSince his birth, there has been a great war that has divided the country and he grew up in a war-torn country, receiving handouts from the military.\nHe had big dreams and wanted to buy his own land and farm it. He wanted to raise his children to be Southerners.\nIn the end bought the land with the money he had earned by risking his life fighting the Viet Cong in Vietnam.\nThe land and the fields were everything to him.\nAll he had to do was farm the last of it and leave it all to his children, and he would reap the rewards of his life’s work……..\n“Fucking bastards. Bastards!”\nThey appeared and polluted his land.\nHe had spent twenty-five years worrying that miasma would contaminate his land and hoped that it would never appear on his land but in the end it happened.\nNow he has only one wish. Just once, just once, he wanted to plant a seedling on his land and see that golden color again.\nHe wanted to see it just once before he died.\n“Uncle, did you hear what Mr. Lee said? The Hunter’s Association is introducing something.”\n“Another unhealthy and expensive drug.”\nThe reagents sold by the Tower were expensive. Even though they were subsidized by the government, they were still expensive.\nThe purifying probability of the reagents was not high, and it would take two years if they were unlucky. Besides, they didn’t work at all in a highly polluted land like the Naju Plain.\n“Let me tell you what I heard.”\nHe was always the one who cursed the Association and the Tower, but always listened to the news while holding a glimmer of hope.\n“My name is Leon Dragonia Lionheart, and I have come to preach my faith to you.”\nThe blond nobleman, accompanied by the Association’s staff, spouted more nonsense than the usual visiting wizards of the Tower.\nAnd then── A golden light bloomed in the land contaminated by miasma.\n“Ah…….”\nIt was a land that could not be purified by expensive reagents or priests, a cursed land where not a single pest could grow, let alone crops.\nBut…\n“Alas…!”\nChoi fell to his knees before the blond man and thanked the man for the miracle he had performed.\n“Who are you?!”\nThe boisterous shamans and the priests said this was a trial from God…….But to Choi, the man in front of him was a god, a savior.\n“Farmer with noble hands I am the Lion King, a representative of the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods, and I have come to bring you the divinity of life and abundance.”\nOn this day, the first worshiper of Demera on Earth offered his faith, and the farmers of the polluted lands followed suit.\n* * * *\nIt was real.\nHa-ri marveled at the cleaned-up plains of Naju.\nThe Hunan Plains were still in the first stages of contamination and even with the reagents from the Tower, it could still be cleaned up.\nTo Ha-ri and the rest of the association, it seemed like Leon’s special power was the only thing that could have cleaned up the Hunan Plains. But Leon insisted that it was a miracle of the gods, and he demanded a place to prove it.\nThat was when the cleansing of the Naju Plains was decided.\nFive years ago, after the Dungeon Break at the Red Gate, the land was completely polluted and even the newest reagents from the wizards of the Magic Tower were ineffective.\nLeon is willing to cleanse the barren lands on one condition.\n“First, tell the President. It would be nice to meet him in person.”\n“We’ll have to see about that.”\nWith the proposal delivered over the phone, the president gave the Hunter Association discretion over the matter.\n“As per the agreement, 8,735 hectares of the farmers of the Naju Plains will be transferred to the patronage of His Majesty’s ‘Guild’. Of course… subject to the consent of the residents and the sale of ‘blessed rice’ to the government.”\n“No problem.”\nWith the help of the Association, Leon established a guild in the country, which he named the Ten Thousand Gods. It was the name he chose to spread the faith of the Ten Thousand Gods across the world.\nThe guild was given a special autonomous region where its members could live and train and be provided with help.\nBusinesses could even move in and pay taxes.\nIt was a law that had been forced through by the Ten Guilds, but it gave Leon a legitimate estate.\nOf course, the government has put in place minimal safeguards, so it’s not permanent.\n“Don’t worry. I would never covet the lawful lands of another nation. This is only to spread the faith, and I will return them to the President when the time is right.”\n“Uhm…technically, to the people.”\nLeon had no interest in the land since this county was too small for him to be greedy and it would take more than that to restore the Lionheart Kingdom to its former glory.\nHowever, after obtaining a suitable foothold and building up his power he would make his move.\n“First, we’ll need to get the residents’ consent to join Your Majesty’s Guild, since they have the right to reside in the Special Territory.”\n“No problem.”\nLeon approached the waiting farmers. Some were middle-aged, some were elderly.\n“Uh, uh, uh… welcome, Leon de… de… de…….”\nChoi bowed and greeted Leon, but couldn’t quite memorize his long name.\n‘Ah… He’s going to be in trouble.’\nThe Lionheart Emperor didn’t even allow Ha-ri to call him by his first name but contrary to her expectations, Leon smiled gently and his voice trailed off.\n“Your Majesty is sufficient, old man.”\n“Aigoo… I’m sorry.”\n‘What, are you discriminating against people?!’\nHa-ri made a sour face, but Leon continued.\n“Did you say you’re Choi Chul-jin?”\n“Yes, I did.”\n“You have sworn to serve the Goddess Demera, the goddess of life and fertility. What about the others?”\nAt that, a middle-aged man stepped forward.\n“…Are you going to cleanse our land as well?”\nLeon frowned at the middle-aged man’s words.\n“Do not attempt to bargain with the divine, for I promise you nothing in return.”\nHe despised shallow beliefs that promised to grant wishes in exchange for offerings, faith, or devotion.\nYou can’t trade with God. Only sincere worship will be granted by the gods.\nTo ask for a favor in exchange for faith is to doubt the divine and try to trade.\n“I will give you the proper teaching. Will you listen to the divine teachings?”\n“Yes, I will listen.”\n“I am not forcing you to believe. It is your choice.”\nJust then, a young man approached, a rarity in this part of the country… a son, to be exact, who had inherited his late father’s land and was invited to this meeting.\n“I, I… I go to church…….”\n“It doesn’t matter. You can believe in both gods.”\n“Is that okay?”\n“Divinity is not a singular existence. There are many great gods in the world, so why should we believe in only one?”\nThere are many faiths in the pantheon and its polytheistic nature does not limit beliefs.\n“It is only up to you to follow the teachings and practice them. I will not impose my beliefs on you.”\nOf course, if someone worships an evil deity, he will mercilessly decapitate them and tear their souls apart.\n“Join this king’s Guild. Follow the due process to enter the enclosure the King will erect and receive the teachings of the Goddess.”\n“I’ll do it, please let me do it!”\nChoi eagerly embraced the faith. It was a miracle that no king, no shaman and no priest could have performed. He had come face to face with a real God, and He had purified his land.\nHow could he not believe then?\nHow could he not be grateful to the One who had given his old body a chance to plow the fields once more?\nChoi rejoiced with tears of gratitude that he could reap the beauty of his life’s work.\n“Yes, I will follow you.”\n“Me, too…!”\nOne by one, the hesitant ones stepped forward.\nThe land was contaminated with miasma and could not be sold, so what was there to lose receiving help to cleanse it?\n“Do you swear to follow the Divinity of Life and Fertility and to practice its teachings?”\n“I swear!”\n“I swear!”\nWith that, they were officially inducted into Leon’s Guild, The Ten Thousand Gods.\nLeon knew they had their eyes set on the purification of the land, but he was confident that one day they would find their true faith.\n“Very well, if you believe and follow, you are children of the Goddess. I, on behalf of the gods, will bless you as you deserve.”\nLeon lifted the chalice and poured the holy water within it upon his new followers. The holy water flowed through the crowns of their heads, energizing them.\n“Oh, my God… My head is clear and my body is full of energy!”\n“I feel like I can see the world differently!”\n“Is that straw doll really a goddess?”\n“Yes. Goddess Demera…!”\nThe faith of those who already believed in the goddess filled the Lionheart and Goddess Demera would turn that faith into divine power.\n“Build a temple. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy, just a place where everyone gathers weekly to pray.”\nLeon preached the teachings of life and abundance, which shouldn’t be too hard to follow.\nThen came the most important moment.\n“What about the offerings…how do we pay?”\nThe congregation embraced this new faith, but was uneasy about it. After all, religion is all about collecting periodic offerings under all sorts of pretenses.\nYou pay to make your child study well, you pay to expand the temple…….and their living was already tight since they hadn’t been able to farm for five years.\n“You only have to pay one thing.”\nThe congregation’s faces lit up at the words. No need to make a new offering for every holiday or season? What a blessing──\n“The Ten Commandments.”\n“”……?””\nTo the wide-eyed congregants who wondered if they had misheard but Leon declared proudly.\n“You will pay by contributing to the salvation of the world.”\nHa-ri, who heard his words thought ‘isn’t this evil?!’",

      "content": "Chapter 14: Demera, Goddess of the Earth\n“Contaminated Naju Plain, what is the mysterious rice field?”\n“A cleanup that even the experts said was impossible? A new reagent from the Tower?”\n“Is there a Guild of Farmers in Naju Plain?”\nFor a while after the purification of the Naju Plains, the internet was full of news about the purified land.\nLeon had already cleaned up land contaminated with miasma in the Hunan Plain, but it wasn’t widely known since the Firebird Guild had pressured the media.\nHowever, the Naju Plain was a different story since it had been contaminated for five years.\nSouth Korea’s self-sufficiency in food was greatly reduced, forcing the country to import expensive rice from China and Japan.\nNo matter what farming methods were applied, no matter what reagents were used, the cleanup of the Naju Plain, which was thought to be impossible, happened overnight.\nThe farmers of the Naju Plain were moved to tears, but the reaction of the Internet and celebrities was more rational.\n-Has the Tower developed a new reagent? The Tower technological advances have been extraordinary lately.\n-How do we eat crops that grow so fast? Aren’t they inedible because of the toxins?\n-Humanity’s technological prowess in magic engineering is increasing every day. At this rate, the world’s grain fields will soon be restored.\nThat was the general reaction.\nWhen faced with an improbable phenomenon, most people try to interpret it according to their common sense.\nFor the people of a scientific civilization, miracles and the descent of the divine are alien, irrational ideas.\n“Your Majesty, the internet is reacting. Perhaps an official announcement from the Association is in order?”\nThe Hunter’s Association had not yet made an announcement about the Gods.\nThe disturbance caused by the country’s largest religious faction is one thing, but the appearance of a government organization promoting a religion is another.\n“Even if you announce it now, the foolish people won’t believe it. They need more proof.”\nLeon spent the next three days touring the Naju Plains and as he purified the land he found that a higher quality of faith than he had expected permeated the temple.\nThe faith that flowed to the God of Life and Fertility was immediately converted into holy power, and Leon was able to harness it to cleanse the Naju Plains.\nA crested effigy replaced the image of the goddess Demera on the Naju Plains, and the people bowed and worshiped at its altar.\n“I give you the right to cultivate this land,” said the king, “and you shall raise up the flesh of Demera to continue its fertility.”\nThe new believers were grateful for the cleansing of the land, but hesitant, and rightly so.\n“But, Your Majesty… isn’t a ten percent tax a bit much, to say the least?”\nYes, this was the problem.\nLeon briefly explained the tax structure of the Lionheart Kingdom. You pay 90% of your total output. This was the same for nobles and freemen alike.\nHow does a country run when 90% of its income is collected in taxes?\nIsn’t everyone starving to death?\nThis was a common criticism of the kingdom from the empire, but it was a misunderstanding of the structure of Lionheart’s kingdom.\nThe Kingdom of Lionheart, under his rule, is a divinely-centered, unified nation and the gods of light and justice governed the ruling class and the common people alike,\nFishermen who followed the gods of the sea and its waves caught the allowed amount of fish and the land tilled by farmers who followed the goddess of life and fertility was always bountiful.\nEven the king was carefully chosen from among the Holy Knights, by the goddess, so that over the millennia of succession, the kingdom was always at peace.\nIt was a perfect social structure with a divine connection and only invasions from the outside disturbed the peaceful kingdom.\nGreedy northern barbarians, crude orcs, and filthy vampires who refuse to die have invaded the bountiful kingdom but there are honorable men who are willing to give their lives against these invaders: knights.\nThey follow the gods of light and justice, armed with iron armors and warhorses, and bravely slay their enemies.\nThe free people praised the knights for their bravery and honor and supported them. And so the Ten Commandments were born.\nIt was a system that the freemen willingly agreed to in order to support the honorable knights as they rode endlessly to their deaths.\nOf course, this was only possible because society was inherently just.\nUnlike empires and miscellaneous kingdoms that are often torn apart by judicial corruption and greed, the Lionheart Kingdom was chosen by the Goddess because it was just and honorable.\nThe slightest misappropriation of the overflowing taxes would result in the withdrawal of the Goddess’ favor, and the family would not be given the opportunity to train to become an honorable Holy Knight.\nThat’s why the taxes of the Lionheart Kingdom have always been used for the common good.\nThey were used to build bridges, build walls, improve facilities, and care for the families of those who died honorably in battle.\nAll of this is done under the watchful eye of the Goddess’s perfect king, King Lionheart, so no matter how much you pay in taxes, you can’t complain.\nIt was with this background that the country became the last bastion against the invasion of the demons.\n“But this is Earth, and Korea….”\nEven the peasants who had witnessed the divine and vowed to become believers agreed.\nThey understood that he was the king of a medieval civilization and that the culture of the survivors was different from Earth.\nBut this is Earth and the land was technically owned by the farmers, and they had to pay a separate tax to the government.\n“Your Majesty…but ninety percent is too much. They have to pay taxes to the government, and they have to pay for their living expenses and fertilizer…”\n“What do you mean, why should they worry about paying taxes to the government, living expenses, and fertilizer?”\n“What?”\nHa-ri and the other farmers, who had been listening intently, looked puzzled at Leon’s unexpected statement.\n“As a follower of the goddess, how can you worry about going hungry? The food you pay as taxes will be distributed, leaving a minimum amount to cover all expenses.”\nWhat he was saying was simple.\nNo taxes, no paperwork, not even living expenses or anything else.\n“I will select a pious man from among you to be a priest. The rest of the harvest will be purely yours, and you may sell it for dignity and luxury.”\nSo everything is taken care of for you, your food, your welfare, your life, except for 10% of your output.\n-What. Does that sound appealing to you?\n-No. Still, 90% is too much, don’t you think?\nAt that point, Ha-ri gave Leon a sly look.\n“I… come to think of it, this blessed rice is worth a fortune.”\nThe performance of 160 grams of rice per kernel is comparable to that of most fortifiers, and the duration is overwhelmingly long.\nHowever, because its yield is so much higher than that of potions, the price of potions related to health and mana recovery will drop massively.\nUsing a very conservative estimate of the market oversupply and the resulting price drop, the Hunter Association’s appraiser concluded that──\n“The conclusion… was that the price of an 80-kilogram sack of rice would be 150 million won.”\n“Eh?”\n“Eh?”\n“Eh?”\nThe farmers rolled their eyes and doubted their ears.\nA hundred and fifty thousand? A sack of rice? What was the rice harvest five years ago?\n“Long live the gods.”\n“Long live the goddess!”\nLeon listened with satisfaction to the praise of the divine that was well-deserved, and taught them the Tenets of Demera, the goddess of life and fertility.\nMake an image of the goddess from the first fruits of your harvest and offer it to her altar. Do not piss in the fields. Manure is fine. Build a scarecrow and make sure it has a hat and clothes. When you harvest, sing a song. It’s better if it’s a song of thanks to the goddess. Don’t go hungry, even if you’re in a hurry. …………\n…………\n…………\n“Is that…is that all right, Your Majesty?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I just feel like there are too many material conditions attached to your faith…….”\nOf course, religion basically promises a take-two deal: you die and you’re saved but Leon didn’t seem like the kind of guy who’d want to believe that.\n“Hmm. How can I expect the nobility of a knight and the dignity of a nobleman from a bunch of ignorant commoners? But if they get drunk on divine grace and lose their proper faith, it doesn’t matter, because that grace can always be taken away.”\nLeon had no intention of being greedy from the start, for in the end, only those with true faith would be chosen by the divine. And it’s not just farmers he’s preaching to.\nWhen the crops grown there are released to the world, people will witness a second miracle: crops that are healthy to eat.\nThe people of this planet, terrified of disease and forced to rely on the barbaric practice of medicine, will eventually admit.\n“Will the crops that grow be used as seedlings?”\n“Some will be purchased by the Hunter’s Association.”\nIt was only a matter of time before a world with divinity would come.\n* * * *\nAfter the cleansing of the Naju Plains and building the altar for the goddess Demera, the first crops were deposited in Leon’s storehouses as foretold.\n“This time,” he said, “take seedlings of all but the most delicate varieties to expand agriculture. Those who need money can sell them at a reasonable price, as the Association has agreed to purchase them for research.”\nLeon gave most of the crops to Mr. Choi, whom he had appointed as a temporary priest, who would distribute the necessary food to the people and plant seedlings for the next season.\nThe villagers were left to sell the rest, which the association had promised to buy, and which was worth well over five billion won.\n“Are you sure it will be fine if you leave it to him?”\n“You mean the elderly farmer?”\n“Yes… You’ve handed over most of the earnings.”\nAs far as Ha-ri was concerned, Leon’s method was too simple.\nThe crops from each parcel of land were given to the lord… and when the lord was absent, the priest would take care of it and send the appropriate amount back to the Lord-Leon.\nOh, my God. It’s like they’re setting you up to steal your taxes.\n“How do you catch people stealing in your kingdom?”\n“We didn’t have to catch them.”\n“Why, why is that?”\n“Because everyone who did went to hell.”\n“Ah…….”\nLeon is an inhabitant of a world where God is real, not Earth where people talk about heaven and hell.\nThere was harmony with the divine, faith and grace…Of course, there was also punishment.\nCheating bureaucrats? Corrupt nobles? Vicious knights? How could such beings survive?\n“A man who cheats the gods for a moment’s riches and glory…that’s a different kind of courage.”\n“…….”\nHa-ri swallowed hard.\nFaced with Demera’s divinity, she was overwhelmed by the existence of the gods and their grace… but the realization that there were also divine punishments gave her chills.\n* * * *\nThere are two ways to become a Hunter.\nEnroll in the Hunter Academy and spend three years of state-funded training and development to receive your Hunter’s Certificate.\nThis is the case of Han Ha-ri, a representative of the National Hunter Association.\n“I graduated at the top of my class, hehe.”\n“I didn’t ask.”\n“Eh…….”\nThe second way is to take the Hunter Association’s authorized Awakening Test, which assesses your “job” and “skills.\nAwakeners who were past the age to enter the Academy were usually allowed in, and many Hunters traveled to the Association’s testing grounds every year to renew their ranks.\n“I don’t know if Your Majesty would like to be tested as well, but it’s more convenient for the job, procedurally speaking.”\nSo, what kind of job does Leon have? What other skills might he have? Ha-ri wondered inwardly.\nSurvivors often had skills that Earthlings couldn’t acquire, and the Association was intrigued.\n“What the hell is that?”\nBut Leon’s response was cold.\n“How are you going to test this Lionheart King with a bunch of crap?”\n“Uh… then why did you ask me to take you there?”\n“I need to find some useful soldiers. I will test them.”\n“Isn’t that, uh, the protocol…….”\n“If not, make it so.”\nAt Leon’s insistence, Ha-ri wondered how to report this to Chief Kim.\n“More than that, when will the president return home?”\n“I’ll call him right away. Hello? Chief Kim?”\nIt would be better to allow this knight king to meet with the president.",

      "content": "Chapter 15\nD-rank Hunter Koo Dae-sung came to the Association for grading again this year.\n“Uh~ Mr. Koo. You’re here again this year?”\nA middle-aged man is happy to see him. It was Team Leader Kim Do-han, who had worked with the gate mining team a few times.\n“It’s been a while.”\n“You’ve been working hard, Mr. Koo.”\n“Haha…….”\nAt the words of Team Leader Kim Do-han, Koo Dae-sung let out an awkward laugh.\nHis age is thirty-two this year and he has been a Hunter for over ten years.\nTalented people usually awaken their powers in middle school and receive admission to the academy. However, he awakened at the age of 22, his rank is D and he has no unique skills.\n“How about this year, do you think you’ll improve your rank?”\n“Haha… I’ll try.”\nKoo Dae-sung has been a D-rank for 10 years. It is said that the limit of the untalented is C-rank, but he was stuck at D-rank for ten years.\n“Why don’t you join our team? If you’re as good as Mr. Gu, you’ll be diligent and do a good job, and you’ll become an ace in no time.”\nNot all Hunters who have awakened their powers have combat jobs.\nThere are those who work in production, those who work in research, and quite a few who work in conventional industry rather than as Hunters.\nHowever, the vast majority of untalented and unremarkable Hunters work as porters for raiding parties or on mining teams that stop just before the gate closes to mine for items.\nThey were able to do this because they were much stronger than the average person, but they were still laborers.\nKoo Dae-sung had been doing this menial labor for 10 years, but he couldn’t give up.\nEven as a D-rank Hunter, the money he earned in the dungeon was nothing compared to the menial labor.\n‘I need to earn more money, and unless I can find a dungeon with high profits, I can’t pay the interest.’\nHe had debts, an old mother to support, and younger siblings to take care of. He couldn’t afford it without his Hunter income.\nBut there was hope that one day he would awaken his unique skills and become a Hunter who could take on high-level Gates as part of a raiding party.\nHe imagines a future where he can shine as an Awakened. But the reality was harsh, and even that glimmer of hope was fading.\n“I’ll try.”\nHe says, but he doesn’t expect much. His goal is now realistic, and he’d be grateful if he could somehow become a C-rank and escape the life of a porter.\n“Hmm? A young man is coming?”\nJust then, someone enters the association’s waiting room. It’s a foreigner with blonde hair.\n“Could it be someone from Europe?”\n“He looks like royalty.”\nThe eyes of the people in the lobby turn to the blond man.\n-Wow, he’s handsome.\n-Oh my God… he’s so handsome.\nHe was certainly striking.\nWith the straight gaze and gorgeous blonde hair, he had the air of a nobleman. Most of all, in a place full of black heads, a blond man was bound to stand out.\n“Is he a foreign worker?”\n“I think he’s European.”\n“Aww, Europe is not all well off, there are poor countries too.”\nEven after the cataclysm, South Korea was a fairly well-off developed country.\nIt’s not a bad country for foreign workers to come and work in, except for the fact that it has a terrible food self-sufficiency rate and relies on imports for most of its food.\n“Hmm…….”\nCuriosity piqued, Kim approached the blond man with his trademark backwoods charm.\n“Hey, young man. How are you?”\n“Don’t talk to me, you lowly thing.”\n“……?”\n“???”\nFor a moment, he thought he’d misheard me, but the intensity of the verbal assault that came back was so strong that he forgot what to say.\n“Ha, you learned Korean in a weird way, didn’t you?”\n“Well, yeah.”\nMr. Kim turned around, unable to ask any more questions. At that moment, the blond man’s gaze crossed with Koo Dae-sung’s.\n“Hmph…….”\nKoo Dae-sung gasped as the pressure from the blond man gaze was like a huge presence suppressing him.\n“Haa……”\nThe only reason Koo Dae-sung could breathe was because an association employee called his number, 57.\n“57, Mr. Koo Dae-sung!”\n“Yes, yes, yes, I’m coming!”\nKoo Dae-sung rushed to the association staff, feeling a strange chill from the gaze behind him.\n* * * *\n‘What a bunch of lowlifes.’\nTurning his head from the Association’s lobby, Leon looked at the assembled faces and made a harsh assessment.\n‘Weak.’\nLeon’s gaze alone can penetrate a person’s insides, sensing the energy within them. However, the auras within them were all dull and small.\nIn the first place, those who came to take the ranking test were either junior Hunters or those who were just about to take the Awakening Test.\nA bunch of ignoramuses whose ‘talent’ wasn’t discovered unless they were from the Academy but Leon is not looking for the strong.\n‘It is a lament that there are no men worthy of being soldiers.’\nHe’s not here to find knights. He’s here to recruit men to follow and support him…soldiers.\nOf course, a knight and a soldier have very different standards.\nSoldiers are not serfs, and they’re not going to be used as a meat shield, so they should have some talent, but they don’t even pass that small threshold.\n‘Though I see one who might be useful.’\nWhat he sees is more than just internal energy. He sees marks, scars, signs of a life lived.\nA man of Leon’s stature can judge people by their face alone.\nMost of them are full-grown men, but their faces show no sign of hardship.\nThere should have been a few with skilled muscles, but even then, they were barely useful as laborers… no, janitors.\n‘It’s not like I’m going to be satisfied from the start.’\nLeon stood up when his turn was called and headed for the interview room.\n“Leon, number 77… Mr. Dragonia Lionheart?”\nThe interviewers were employees of the Association. Of course they knew Leon was a survivor but they didn’t know his personality.\n“Address me as Your Majesty, commoner.”\n“Uh…….”\nThe association worker paused, then nodded to the deputy who poked him in the side.\n“Uhm…Your Majesty…….”\nLeon listened to the officials’ deference with satisfaction; he knew his common sense was at odds with Earth’s, but there was a reason he insisted on imposing his version of justice and decorum.\n‘It is not for royalty to consider the laws of the commoners.’\nThough he is an Earthling, he has been a knight of noble birth and a king for three hundred years.\nRoyalty is not bound by the rules of the lesser, and there is no reason for him to consider cultural differences, even if they are worlds apart.\n“Then please place your hand on the measuring device here for the test.”\nThe test for a Hunter’s rank is a two-step process.\nFirst, they’re tested for unique skills and class aptitudes.\nUsually, the class aptitudes that follow the Inherent Skills are Warrior or Swordsman, and in the rare case of a Wizard aptitude, they would contact the Tower.\nThe next step is to take a practical test at a gate maintained by the Society to determine your final rank.\nThey had heard that Leon was a very powerful survivor, so they were very curious to see what his unique skills would be.\n“Foolish!”\n“What?”\nBut it was Leon’s scolding that came back.\n“How can a commoner test the honor of a knight!”\nWhat?\n“Your Majesty, it’s not us that’s measuring, it’s a magic tool, and it’s quite accurate…….”\n“How can a machine measure a knight’s worth? Only honorable knights and the gods can measure a knight.”\n“…….”\nThe Association’s staff was puzzled, too; they’d had plenty of survivors with odd personalities, but this was the first one to refuse to take the test.\n“Uhm, well, then…on the very next test…no. You refused to take the test, so you must go…….”\nThen why are you here?\n“I’m here to recruit useful soldiers, but I can’t believe even the auditors are such scumbags.”\n‘Headhunting? So openly?’\nMany guilds, including the Ten Guilds, hire scouts to recruit good hunters. But to openly refuse the test and come to headhunt like this?\n“So far, I haven’t found anyone I like, so what’s the next test?”\n“There’s a practical test at the… gate.”\n“Good. I’ll be there to observe.”\n“…….”\nBut the employee could only nod as the manager poked him in the side once again.\n* * * *\nEach gate has its own concept.\nDungeon type and field type are the largest categories, followed by several smaller categories such as quest type and capture type.\nThe general rule of thumb is that once a gate is cleared, it should be closed and removed.\nHowever, in some cases, gates are kept open even if the boss is not captured or the closing conditions are not fulfilled, such as the Seoul Station gate.\n“Does anyone else get dizzy? Some people get motion sickness when passing through the gate.”\nThe Seoul Station gate is a field-type gate with a green meadow.\nKoo Dae-sung sighed softly as he looked at the Seoul Station gate, which he was already visiting for the tenth time.\nThis year’s measurements weren’t much different from last year. There were no unique skills and no stat increases.\nIf he wanted to turn the tables, he’d have to perform well in this practical test. And in order to perform, party members are important. Koo Dae-sung looked at the faces of the party members who had joined him for this test.\n“Wow, this is the gate. Brother, this is a hot mess.”\n“Jinmi, let’s turn off our cell phones first.”\n‘Two newbies…….’\nHe also saw the blond foreigner from the waiting room.\n‘Haa…….’\nIf he’s here to test his rank at that age, it’s most likely a case of late awakening since Academy graduates are tested separately.\nIn a party of five, three of them are just beginners… Koo Dae-sung turned his eyes towards his last hope, but it was the old man who was there.\n“Hehe, the air is so good.”\nThe old man must have been over sixty years old. He may have awakened during the Cataclysm thirty years ago, but he had not made a name for himself among the first generation of Hunters.\nThat meant that the old man was just an unremarkable C- or D-rank Hunter like himself.\n‘I wasn’t expecting it, but…….’\nIt can’t be helped that they’re either beginners or D-rank in the first place.\n“Then, Hunters, don’t worry and feel free to attack the gate, even if it’s dangerous, because I, a B-grade Hunter, will step forward.”\nLeaving the association staff behind, Koo Dae-Sung stepped forward.\n“Then… let’s introduce ourselves and confirm our positions.”\nEven at a time like this, he had to play the role of party leader and raise his evaluation score.\n“I’m Koo Dae-sung. I’ve been a Hunter for 10 years, and my class is Warrior. My main position is dealer.”\n“Shin Tae-hoon. I awakened this year and I use a shield and spear.\n“This is my sister, Shin Na-yeon, she uses daggers and is learning to use a bow.”\nThey are beginners who haven’t even found their aptitude yet so Koo Dae-sung cautiously asked.\n“Did you two go to separate schools?”\nDue to age restrictions, those who can’t attend a hunter academy often attend training centers run by veteran hunters.\nIt’s not as structured as an academy, but it’s more of a cram school.\n“Me and my brother went to school for three months at a time.”\nThey were complete novices. Koo Dae-sung didn’t expect it, so he approached the old man.\n“Hey, old man. What about you?”\n“This old man is fifty years old and my name is Oh Kang-tae. Although I’m an awakened, I was recently dismissed from my job.”\nHis weapon is a pistol and he has little experience for his age.\nA pistol…even if he was a martial artist, it would be hard for him to overcome the disadvantage of a sword or spear.\n“Huh… And finally, the foreign visitor, do you speak Korean?”\n“…….”\nThe blond man… Leon stared at him for a moment, unmoved by Koo Dae-sung’s question.\n“This king doesn’t fight.”\n“Uh… You’re a good fighter? Did you learn Korean backwards?”\n“You can’t use a dragon-slaying sword to kill a chicken.”\nHe learned Korean backwards.\nKoo Dae-sung scratched his head thoughtfully and decided on a position.\n“So… Tae-hoon, you’ll be the tank, me and the old man will be the main dealers, Nari, you’ll be the archer and that foreigner… what the hell, why doesn’t he have a weapon?”\nWhile the Hunters at the gate had brought their own weapons, Leon had none.\n“That…foreigner…didn’t you bring a weapon?”\nStrange. I thought the Association would lend him a weapon or two.\n“Handsome brother over there, do you want me to lend you a weapon?”\nAt that moment, Shin Na-yeon, who was holding a dagger and a bow, cautiously asked. Her eyes sparkled as she looked at Leon, who seemed to have an air of transcending humanity.\n“Do you want to use a dagger or a bow? My main skill is daggers, so… would you like to try this bow? Do you know how to shoot a bow?”\nShin Na-yeon hands over a bow. It’s a new product called a smart bow that can automatically aim and adjust the string tension.\n“You want to give me this?”\n“No, just use it and give it back.”\nLeon stared at the bow in disbelief. As if he heard something he shouldn’t have. Then he frowned as if he had been insulted and threw the bow to the ground.\n“Ack! My bow!”\n“Hey, what are you doing?”\nShin Tae-hoon was furious when his sister’s bow was thrown to the ground. However, the knight king is equally angry at being insulted.\nOf course, the reason for his anger is beyond the comprehension of a lowly commoner.\n“Knights don’t use cowardly ranged weapons.”\nYou’ve got to be kidding me.\nKoo Dae-Sung rubbed his eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 16: Cowardly Ranged Weapons\nIn Leon’s world, ranged weapons are cowardly weapons for the lowly.\nThey are unacceptable to a knight who values honor, and the only people who use them are serfs and free soldiers who have no need for honor.\nOf course, he was a natural commander and an undefeated rising general so he had no shortage of archers, catapults, and cannons.\nBut ranged weapons have their limits. There’s something called recoil, and it’s the same with firearms.\nThere’s a limit to the amount of ammunition, a limit to the amount of firepower… It’s like a weapon with a maximum value. But swords and spears are different.\nWhat you swing is what you swing, and what you throw is what you throw, and it’s purely up to you.\nIf you can’t split a boulder with your sword, you’re not a knight.\nCan’t blow away an opponent’s mounted charge? A good knight can pierce through pikemen.\nIn the end, honor and fame are earned through sheer strength, not through the use of a bow.\nFor a Holy Knight who has completed the quest and been chosen by the Grail, a ranged weapon is a dishonorable admission of inadequacy.\n“No, there’s something wrong with you!”\nOf course, it didn’t make sense in modern terms.\n“You’re a funny fellow.”\nOh Kang-hyuk laughed it off, but not the rest of the party. They were about to say something when a frantic Hunter employee shouted out.\n“We need to get going!”\n“Okay…….”\nKoo Dae-Sung followed where the Association employee led, thinking this test might be a bust.\n“This test… how does it work?”\nKoo Dae-sung asked, and the Association staff answered.\n“Basically, you’ll be hunting 50 kobolds. They’ll be out in the field, but if it’s too dangerous, I’ll step in.”\nEven though the staff member said that only kobolds could be hunted, Koo Dae-Sung wanted to earn a higher score.\nOf course, hunting gnolls and boss monsters earns higher points, and there are specific areas where they appear.\n“Hey, guys. I know a place, why don’t you go there and hunt?”\n“You’re more experienced than us, so…….”\n“I’m in……..”\n“……”\nThe three agree, and Leon remains silent so Koo Dae-sung led the party out of the meadow and into the forest.\nTae-hoon and Na-yeon, the newbies, craned their necks to see where he was leading them.\n“Mr. Dae-sung, I see a village at the end of the meadow. There must be a lot of them.”\n“Don’t mess with the villages. We’re outnumbered and could be surrounded by kobolds and gnolls.”\nKoo Dae-sung is a veteran of the game, tackling the Seoul Station gate for the tenth time.\nHe has seen kobolds and gnolls at other gates as well, although they’re not as frequent because they’re only set up for testing.\n“We’re going to target the kobolds in the cave.”\nKoo Dae-sung explained the advantages of fighting in caves.\nFirst, the cramped quarters and one-way passageways meant they wouldn’t have to worry about being surrounded.\nTearing off a patch of grass he’d found along the way.\n“I’m going to light a fire with the grass here and inject smoke inside, so we can easily target the cave kobolds.”\n“Ah~”\n“You’re different after all.”\nEven as he was praised by the party members, Koo Dae-sung smiled bitterly.\nComing to the test gate ten times wasn’t that big of a deal.\nAs his rank increased, the test gates would naturally change. For C-rank was the Samjeon Station gate and for B-rank, the 63rd Building Gate.\nHe studied and researched all the strategies, imagining that one day he would be able to enter the top gates, but he could only see the gate here at Seoul Station.\n‘I have to move up this time, I can’t stay a D-rank forever.’\nHe wanted to be strong, and he was sick and tired of being D-rank.\n“Kobolds up ahead!”\nAt that moment, Shin Tae-hoon, who was in the lead as a tank, stopped and the kobolds spotted them because they were so loud.\n“Grrr…!”\nKobolds are humanoid monsters with the heads of dogs. They are about the height of an elementary school student and are the lowest class of monsters.\n“Block them with your shield in front Tae-hoon!”\n“Yes!”\nThe kobolds’ charge was straightforward and simple and they had a strong tendency to go for pure strength and power.\nIn that case, the hunters would win unless they were overwhelmingly outnumbered.\n“Kiaaak!”\nThe kobold that had been charging upright was knocked down by Na-yeon’s arrow.\nThe kobold spun around to face Tae-hoon’s shield and crashed head-on into it, bleeding from the nose.\n“Stupid bastards.”\nTae-hoon plunged his sword into the fallen kobold but just then, another kobold threw himself at Tae-hoon, and he fell to the ground in anger.\n“Ouch…!”\n“Tae-hoon!”\nJust as the kobold was about to sink its teeth into him, Dae-sung’s sword pierced the kobold’s neck and hot blood poured out onto Tae-hoon’s face.\n“Don’t let your guard down! They may be weak, but they’re quick!”\nThere are five kobolds left but Na-yeon’s arrow, drawn straight, pierces the second kobold.\n“Hmph.”\nThe old man, Oh Kang-tae, takes over the fallen line and punches the kobolds in the face with his armored fist. It was a swift jab.\n“Kung!”\n“Kung!”\nThe kobolds’ fell, one after another, as Dae-Sung picked up Tae-Hoon and joined them.\n“Whoa….”\n“I’m sorry. I made a mistake.”\nWhen Tae-hoon apologized for his mistake and breaking the formation, Dae-sung clapped his hands to encourage him.\n“It’s okay, it happens to everyone at first.”\nHe, too, had made his share of mistakes against the kobolds. Considering he was a rookie, Tae-hoon’s mistakes weren’t even on the error side.\n“Na-yeon took care of two of them, and thanks to you, no one got hurt. Everyone did a good job.”\nDespite his initial misgivings, this is not a bad party, except for one person.\n“Hey, foreigner, you… you didn’t do anything in our fight, did you?”\n“That’s right, I just stood in the back and watched, Mr. Employee, is this okay?”\nThe arrow was returned to Leon, who remained silent. He was dying to get rid of Leon and get another party member.\n“Haha…I’ll take that into consideration, so don’t worry too much.”\nLeon would get the lowest score, and the others would get extra points. Dae-sung was disappointed but he thought it was fine if they would get extra points.\n“If that’s the case… let’s go further in. We’ll find a cave soon.”\nTrue to his word, they walked further into the forest, and a cave appeared.\n“There really is a cave.”\n“Ugh… Do we have to go in and fight? I don’t like dark places.”\nNa-yeon’s complaint made him want to say, “You’ll never be a hunter…” but Dae-sung held it together and smiled.\n“No, we’re going to ‘raid’ the cave.”\n“Raid?”\n“Well, a basic part of being a hunter is raiding gates, so I need you all to gather some leaves from around the area. We’ll set them on fire and send the smoke into the cave.”\n“Aaah! You’re going to choke them to death with smoke?”\n“Wow, awesome. Then we’ll just have to catch the ones that jump out.”\nThat was it. In Koo Dae-sung’s experience, there were more than twenty kobolds in this cave.\nHe had been using this method since the sixth game, as it allowed him to take out more than two dozen kobolds with little loss of health in a gate attack where health balance was crucial.\nAs he organizes his plan and gathers the leaves and grass clippings around him, his eyes catch sight of Leon, arms crossed and eyes closed.\n“Hey, why don’t you help instead of playing?”\nLeon opened his closed eyes. His blue eyes pierce Dae Sung.\n“In your eyes, you see this king being lazy.”\nIf not that, then something else…But he couldn’t say it out loud.\nHe couldn’t explain it with logic or reason, but a strange gut feeling told him that if he said anything more here, he might get in trouble.\n“Uhm… Oh, whatever, you’re the lowest of the low, so you know!”\nIt was the best he could do to avoid eye contact.\n“I’ve got it all!”\n“Do you need a lighter for the fire?”\n“This old man has a lighter. Oh, I’ve long since given up smoking, don’t get me wrong.”\nHe was about to light the tinder.\n“Do you really think that’s best?”\nLeon spoke up.\n“What, you haven’t even helped yet?”\n“This king asked you if that is the best move, don’t make me tell you twice.”\n“……I’ve tried this three times. And it worked all three times.”\n“It’s based on experience, which isn’t bad. But how can you rely on experience when that experience is so shallow?”\n“What are you talking about, really…….?”\nFor a moment he thought he did something wrong, but he knew better.\n“Oh, never mind. You’re too young to have experience…….”\nHe lit a fire and pushed the smoke from the large leaves around him into the cave.\n-Kyaaaaah!\nA monstrous screeching sound echoed through the cave.\n“Oh, they’re coming!”\nTae-hoon shouts as he raises his shield, and everyone prepares for battle. And just as the first group of kobolds burst out of the cave, they stop dead in their tracks at the sight of the flames blocking the entrance.\n“Now!”\nThe arrow Na-yeon pulled flew, and the rocks thrown by Old Man Oh and Dae-sung crushed the kobolds’ faces.\n-Crack!\n-Khahak!\nOne after another, the kobolds fell. After killing five of them in an instant, Dae-Sung exclaimed in triumph.\n“See! My method is not wrong!”\nThe next group of kobolds jumped up. They were gasping for air to keep from choking on the smoke, and they looked dizzy.\n“Alright, let’s get on with it!”\nHe shouted as he took down the seventh kobold.\n“Krrr…!”\nAnother similar but different howl was heard and Koo Dae-Sung doubted his ears.\n“Gnoll?”\nHe turned to the sound and there, staring back at him, was gnoll, armed with armor and shield… and a one-handed axe.\nWith the head of a vicious hyena, and one and a half times larger than the average gnoll…….\n“Gnoll Captain?!”\nGnoll Captain is the boss here at the gate of Seoul Station. His monster rank is definitely C-class. It’s too strong for them.\n“Oh, no. Why now?”\nSuddenly, Dae-Sung’s mind flashed back to Leon’s words ten minutes ago.\n‘Do you really think it’s the best move?’\nIt was as if he’d been expecting this, but how?\n“Dae-sung, what should we do?”\nNa-yeon’s urgent cry made Dae-sung’s heart race.\n“You and Na-yeon, stop the kobolds in the cave, and me and Tae-hoon will deal with Gnoll Captain!”\nThey needed people on both sides. Above all, it would be suicidal for a D-rank to fight against a Gnoll Captain without any tactics.\nHe could only hope that Tae-hoon, who was technically a novice, could hold his own with the shield.\n“Kraaaaaaaaah!”\nThe Gnoll Captain screams and charges. Tae-hoon takes the lead and raises his shield, but his legs are shaking from the roar. He can’t even block an attack like that!\n“Tae-hoon, wake up…!”\nBefore he could finish his sentence, a terrifying axe slammed into Tae-hoon’s shield and Tae-hoon, unable to withstand the blow, fell to the ground, losing his shield.\n‘Holy shit!’\nThe Gnoll Captain was about to strike Tae-hoon down but Dae-sung moved to save Tae-hoon.\n“Krrr…!”\nThe Gnoll Captain lightly blocked the charge with his momentum and the longsword was unable to penetrate the shield from the front, and he was stopped.\n“Krrr…!”\nThe Gnoll Captain grunted as his back snapped forward and swung his axe towards Dae-sung.\nDae-sung was thrown away by the impact that his armor had barely absorbed.\n“Ouch, ouch…….”\nIt was then that I saw the terrified Tae-hoon about to be struck by the great axe.\nHas the party cleared out the kobolds yet? Why hasn’t the Association’s staff moved?\nHis thoughts didn’t last long as Dae-sung raised his shield, forgetting to even grip his sword.\n“Tae-hoon, step back!”\nDae-sung’s shield blocks the axe as it strikes and his knees buckled under the unimaginable weight of the axe.\n“Thud!”\nBut he held on and he instinctively adjusted the angle of his shield to deflect the axe at an angle.\n“Krrr…?”\nThe Gnoll Captain let out an annoyed howl as his weapon slipped, and he raised his axe again.\nA second blow, could I stop it? If only Tae-hoon could come to his senses and fight back.\nThe axe comes down, and Dae-sung grits his teeth.\n-……!\nThe expected clang is not heard, and Koo Dae-sung’s pupils dilate as he stares at the Gnoll Captain axe without closing his eyes the entire time.\n“That’s a good enough score.”\nThe Gnoll Captain axe was still in Leon’s hand, trembling in his fingers.\n“You saved……..”\n“Try again.”\n“What…?”\n“Raise your shield and face him again, I say. If you have done it once, why not twice?”\n“???”\nLeon, who had let go of the axe, urged, and Koo Dae-sung and the Gnoll Captain both shook their heads.",

      "content": "Chapter 17: Yakt Spinner\nKoo Dae-Sung looks up at Leon in disbelief, realizing that he has been saved.\nCaptain Gnoll’s axe is… suspended in midair. Or more precisely, it was clutched in Leon’s fingers, trembling and unmoving.\n‘How strong does he have to be…….?’\nCaptain Gnoll may not have the full strength of a C-class Hunter, but he’s on par with a C-class Hunter. He was the boss of the Seoul Station gate, which is the graveyard of the beginners.\nNot only could he block Captain Gnoll’s axe with his fingers, but he’s holding it so tightly that he can’t even pull it out?\nThat was impossible, unless the opponent was overwhelmingly strong.\n“Try again.”\nFor a moment, Koo Dae-sung wondered if he had misheard.\n“What…?”\n“Raise your shield and try again.”\n“????”\nAnd then Dae-sung realized Leon let go of the Captain Gnoll axe.\n“Now, block his attack and counterattack.”\n“No, what are you doing…! We’re all in danger!”\nFrom a common sense perspective, Koo Dae-Sung is right a hundred times over. But in the eyes of the lion-heart king, it’s not only foolish, it’s impious.\n“Rude! You have the honor of being guided by the Lionheart King, and yet you dare to disagree!”\n“No…!”\nOutrageous! What have I done wrong?\n“As a Holy Knight by nature, it is an honor for me to lead a mere soldier. You cannot thank this king for such a favor.”\nLeon spoke with a nonchalance that was already beyond insulting, an attitude that would have stunned even the gnoll next to him. But Leon could only glare pathetically at the dazed commoner.\n“Raise your shield! Block the axe, counterattack!”\n“Ugh…!”\nSince Leon had let Captain Gnoll axe through, Koo Dae-sung had no choice but to raise his shield in order to stay alive.\n“Krrr…!”\nWhile Koo Dae-sung got up, Captain Gnoll glared ferociously at Leon. Of course, Leon attracted much more aggro than Koo Dae-sung.\n“Kyaaaaah!”\nCaptain Gnoll swung his axe at Leon without paying attention to Koo Dae-sung but just as his axe was about to hit Leon in the head.\n-Tup!\n“Krrr?”\nThe axe blade stops in midair. The sharpened axe was once again blocked by his fingers, unable to move.\n“Is this rabid bastard insane?”\nCaptain Gnoll cowered under Leon’s gaze while Leon stared at the axe for a moment, then grabbed the shield in the gnoll’ captain hand.\nAn unscathed hand wraps around the shield and the unbelievable happens as the iron shield snapped, crushed by the grasping hand.\nIt was a horrifying sight meant to send one message ‘don’t do it’.\nCaptain Gnoll understood immediately since wild beasts by nature understand the hierarchy of power.\nHis tail curled as he realized that he was no match for Leon. Instead, he directed his anger and embarrassment at Koo Dae-Sung.\n“Uhhh…….”\nKoo Dae-sung was stunned by the unexpected aggro, but the Gnoll Captain, who had lost his shield, swung his axe straight at him.\n“Ouch…!”\nKoo Dae-sung raised his shield with a gasp as a clang sounded and the impact was transmitted through the shield.\n‘Strong!’\nHe was able to block the strong impact.\n“Fool, how can you use your shield to block it?”\nLeon yelled at the old man as he watched the battle from the sidelines and began to train him.\n“Don’t go toe-to-toe with a being more powerful than you! Deflect like you did before, deflect his weapon and look for an opening, that’s how the weak fight!”\nDamn, if it was that easy, who the hell would I be, a D-rank Hunter for 10 years?\nBut Koo Dae-Sung tried again to deflect the swinging axe with his shield.\nHe twisted the direction of the shield and slanted it so instead of taking the full impact, he deflected it diagonally.\n-Bam!\n“Boom…!”\nBut it was easier said than done since the Gnoll Captain also reacted to the twisting shield.\n“Your opponent is no scarecrow! He is a living, breathing, learning beast! How can you expect to succeed by simply twisting your shield?”\n“Ack! Damn it! What am I supposed to do──”\nWith a thud, Leon’s kick to the side knocked Koo Dae-sung off his feet.\n“What, what are you doing──!”\nKoo Dae-sung saw the trajectory of Captain Gnoll’s axe as he fell. The shield he’d casually raised in response to Leon’s words wouldn’t have blocked the axe’s blow.\n“Stay focused. Take my advice like the sky, but keep your eyes on the enemy.”\nLeon stops the axe-wielding gnoll in his tracks with a blow to the head and looks down at him.\n“Get back on your feet.”\nWhen he tried to plead ignorance, Leon said.\n“Don’t let your talent rot. Unlock your potential. You can do better.”\nTalented? Me?\nKoo felt a strange sensation at the words.\nA hunter without a single unique skill, a talentless D-rank hunter who just happened to be awakened.\nLeon’s words of encouragement were so unexpected, and his voice alone filled him with a strange sense of trust.\nI can do this\n.\nI raise my shield. This is my first time using a shield since I’ve always used a sword.\n-Bam!\nIt’s heavy. Damn, how did I block that attack earlier?\n‘Keep your eyes on the enemy.’\nI follow his advice. In the narrow field of vision blocked by my shield, I stare at the axe that the gnoll captain is wielding.\nThe trajectory of the swinging axe, if only I could read it!\n-Bang!\nThe sound of metal scraping against metal rang out, louder than before and the attack was deflected.\n“Stand, you’ve succeeded…!”\n“Krrr!”\nThe gnoll’s front paw slammed into his abdomen and Koo Dae-Sung’s body flew into the distance.\n“Tsk…! How pathetic. How can you not see the whole picture?”\nStaring at the axe, he didn’t see the creature’s foot move.\nKoo Dae-sung’s vision blurred and his eyelids finally closed.\nThis year, he received a D grade again.\n* * * *\nWhen Koo Dae-sung passed out, Leon, the gnoll captain, and Shin Tae-hoon were the only ones left.\n“Cr, cr…….”\nCaptain Noll glared at the fallen Koo Dae-sung, but kept his eyes on Leon.\nIt could only stare at Leon in horror. With that alone──\n“How much longer will you, a filthy son of a bitch who isn’t even human, stand by and watch this king?”\n-Crack!\nA finger snaps. It’s not even a fist, but the mere contact of his chin with the outstretched index finger sends Captain Gnoll’s head spinning thirteen times.\n-Kududuk!\nCaptain Gnoll crumbles to the ground with a crunching sound as his neck breaks.\n“Huh… dirty.”\nLeon frowned like a dysentery patient who had touched something that shouldn’t have been touched, then stood in front of Shin Tae-hoon.\nSighing, he wiped his fingers where they had touched the Gnoll captain on the hem of his shirt but Tae-hoon didn’t dare say anything.\nCaptain Gnoll is the boss at the gate of Seoul Station, where there is no specific boss.\nIt’s a graveyard for beginners with a Class C-rank and not many novice Hunters survive with the help of the Association staff after encountering Gnoll Captains.\nWhat kind of Hunter would play with a Gnoll Captain like that?\n“Wait, an Association employee?”\nAs it turns out, even though it was a clear crisis, the Association staff didn’t step in. Instead, they keep their distance and act as if they expected this to happen.\n“That’s right! Na-yeon…!”\nTae-hoon’s eyes widened in surprise as he looked in the direction of the cave.\n“Ugh… Oh, big brother, it’s all taken care of.”\n“You young men had a hard time.”\nIn front of the cave, where dozens of kobolds were about to emerge, Old Man Wu laughed and wiped the blood off his holster.\n“Then… we’ll end the test.”\nWith those words, the hunt at Seoul Station Gate came to an end.\nMoments later Han Ha-ri, who was waiting at the entrance to Seoul Station Gate, saw Leon and ran over.\n“Your Majesty, how was it?”\n“Just a walk.”\nThe Seoul Station Gate was nothing more than a walk for him. Even though he’s a weakened knight-king who’s lost most of his power, his body is still that of a demigod.\nEven if tens of thousands of gnolls swarm around him they can’t put a dent in his jade body\n“So… did you accomplish your goal?”\nLeon had come to the Seoul Station gate in the name of testing to learn about the hunters’ physiology and find talent at the same time.\n“No, I encountered several Hunters in the waiting room, but they were all lowly commoners. There is no one worthy of serving this king…….”\nLeon remembered a man, D-rank hunter Koo Dae-sung.\nHis skill with a shield was unremarkable. Poor, to be sure, but he showed promise.\nA professional soldier’s skill was to use a shield, so that was something worth cultivating.\n“Well, he’s fit enough to be a sergeant.”\n“I see.”\nIt was then that the Association staff and other party members who came out with Leon came into view.\nHa-ri was surprised to see the elderly man among them… or rather, the unmasked Oh Kang-tae.\n“Association President?!”\n“Ms. Ha-ri, it’s been a while.”\nOh Kang-tae. No, Oh Kang-hyuk, the president of the Hunter’s Association smiled a cheeky smile.\n* * * *\nA cafe near Seoul Station.\n“Did you know?”\nOh Kang-hyuk, the president of the Hunter Association, assumed that Leon had realized his identity from the moment he stopped caring about the kobold cave.\n“There’s no way a warrior of your caliber could be out there.”\nLeon had known from the moment he approached him under his pseudonym, for the aura he carried was out of the ordinary.\n“Hehe, I even wore a mask of illusion on purpose, but it must have been meaningless.”\nThe magic tool that transforms the face to look like someone else was meaningless to Leon in the first place, as he was an outsider who didn’t even know the face of the most famous Hunter in the country.\n“I heard you’re forming a guild this time.”\n“Only if you replace the name of the Knights with a guild.”\nOh Kang-hyuk wanted to know Leon’s intentions. He needed to know what he was after, where he was headed, so he could keep him in the small country of Korea.\n“I would like to thank you on behalf of the nation for cleansing the Naju Plain. The President said he would like to see you soon to thank you.”\n“It’s not a big deal. It doesn’t require the king to thank me.”\n“We would like to make our own case, if that’s what you want-─”\n“I’m not particularly anxious to leave the country.”\n“……!”\nThe words hit the nail on the head.\nWhat the Association wants from Leon is for him to stay in the country.\nHe has proven to be a powerful being in his own right, but more than that, his miraculous ability to cleanse the land of miasma contamination makes him more valuable than any other survivor.\nIf any other country realized what he could do, they would go to war to get him.\n‘Even our ally, the United States, can’t be trusted.’\nThe United States has also lost all sorts of granaries to Dungeon Breaks so they’ll pay Leon any price to cleanse the land.\nAnd that price, Leon seemed to already know.\n“You are mistaken.”\n“What… what do you mean?”\n“It is not this king’s power or ability to cleanse the land of pollution.”\n“What is it then…….”\nHe heard from the association staff that Leon cleaned up the plains of Hunan and Naju. He saw it on video, so how can it not be Leon power──\n“You mean… by believing in Goddess Demera… anyone can do that?”\n“Not just anyone. You have to be a priest with sincere faith and her approval.”\nHe was amazed. A mere priest could solve a problem that humanity has yet to fully solve?\n“In this world, there is a basic freedom of religion.”\n“……Yes.”\nReligious conflicts still erupt, but there was no religious persecution in Korea. One religion has been a bit extreme, but it pales in comparison to bombings in the Middle East.\n“It’s a problem that will be overcome naturally. If you want divine power, first prove it with your faith.”\n“…….”\nOh Kang-hyuk wondered if he should really trust these otherworldly religious people. But regardless, he couldn’t deny the purified land.\n“Your Majesty’s wishes are well understood, but if there’s anything else you need, we can help.”\n“Perhaps I offer you the opportunity to serve this king.”\n“How?”\n“I need to improve my reputation.”\nReputation? Oh Kang-hyuk gave me a puzzled look.\n“When you say reputation, you mean…….”\n“I intend to raise this king’s reputation on this earth… no, in the world, so that I can have the opportunity to preach.”\nIn other words, he believed that the more fame he gained, the more he could spread the faith of the Ten Thousand Gods.\nHe wasn’t wrong, in fact, it was the most effective way.\n“Hmm… I see… In order for Your Majesty to increase your reputation… That is actually the best way. His Majesty must have guessed.”\nOh Kang Hyuk remembered that he had joined the test to find talent.\nHe created a guild, accepted residents, and recruited guild members.\nThe simplest way to increase your reputation on modern Earth. Needless to say.\n“First, I’d suggest you start building a track record to raise your rank as a Hunter. In this day and age, there aren’t many ways to spread prestige like force.”\n“And how do you raise that rating?”\n“Simple. You close the gates. Of course, this will be a complicated process for Your Majesty, who has only just settled on Earth.”\nThe first problem is the gates. Most high-ranking gates are pre-bid by guilds, and the only gates that Leon, a novice hunter, can enter are low-ranking gates owned by Association that no one has bid on.\n“If you want to raise your reputation quickly, there’s nothing like a high-rank gate.”\n“But, I heard that those are the ones that guilds bid on in advance?”\nAt that, Oh Kang-hyuk laughed and replied.\n“Actually, there is a case of a failed attempt to capture the Vermilion Gate. It’s a specialty gate, and the Association is struggling with it.”\nHe pulled out his smartphone, played a video, and placed it politely on the desk.\nOn the screen, a “spider” appeared.\n“This is a vermilion gate in the city of Cheongju. It’s a special gate that was recently upgraded to an actual ‘Vermilion’ gate.”\nThe eight wide-angle lenses covering all four directions are constantly moving, and the eight thick legs are too cold and hideous for a creature.\nHuge cannons and bladders on thick, crab-like carapaces along with a railgun that emits a vicious electromagnetic pulse.\n-Ahhhh! Run! Run! Run! Run!\n-What the hell! We can’t beat that thing!\nIt was a nightmare that hops from building to building on eight legs, taunting the Hunters.\n“The boss of this special gate, which no one has cleared in a year.”\n“Either obtain or destroy the ‘Wisdom Gem’ guarded by the Yakt Spinner.”",

      "content": "Chapter 18: Hunting the Spider (1)\nThe conditions for a dungeon break are simple.\nAfter the gate appears, the magic inside begins to expand, eventually causing the gate to crack. This is why dungeon breaks have a time limit.\nPreventing the dungeon break is surprisingly simple.\nYou can either close the gate by clearing a condition that appears when you enter the dungeon, or you can periodically clean the inside to remove the expanding magic.\nThe latter method is used when you intentionally leave a gate open, such as the gate at Seoul Station. But just as the explanation for gates is not perfect, there are always exceptions.\nThis is the case with the gate at Cheongju Sports Complex.\n“Hey, tinkerers, let’s get a win this time!”\n“You lost 24:3 last week, so you lost 8:1 three times, and now you’re going to win! I saw it!”\nAs the 10,000 spectators watched, a gate appeared in the middle of the stadium.\n“Ah, we could have won this time.”\nAfter the gate was opened, the Association staff measured the gate’s rating.\nThe gate was rated vermilion after measuring the amount of energy inside. After registering the Cheongju Sports Complex gate through the Association’s database, the next step was to select a target area for the gate and local guilds were prioritized first.\nThe fastest raiders will be prioritized, followed by raiders of a certain rank and above.\nThe Cheongju Sports Complex gate was won by the KPP guild, a group of local native hunters, and they immediately entered the gate.\n“Brother, this is…….”\n“I know…….”\nKPP Guild Leader Kim Hansu and Class A Tanker Cho Ho-yeol shared a subtle look at the sight of the gate.\nThe wilderness, a desolate world with barren cities and blowing sandstorms.\nThis kind of world was not uncommon among the Gates. The desolate interiors, as if the world had ended, were a familiar sight to Hunters.\nThe problem was the civilization level of this gate.\n“At least modern civilization. Maybe…more advanced than Earth.”\nRuined but standing buildings, autonomous robots roaming the streets…….\n“That’s interesting, a gate to the future.”\n“There’s fantasy and martial arts, so why not the future?”\nThe world inside the gate varied greatly.\nIf it’s a dungeon-type gate, you can simply defeat monsters and bosses, or if it’s a field-type gate, it’s often not implemented beyond a certain distance.\nHowever, the higher the grade of the gate, the more complex and diverse the scenery and tendencies inside become.\nIn fantasy gates, for example you’ll see humans and elves using swords and magic, and goblins and orcs as enemies.\nIn fantasy martial arts type gates there are martial arts practitioners and the Demon Cult as enemies.\nOther gates include apocalyptic, arcane punk, and steampunk.\n“New implant released. Replace your useless body with a machine.”\nA perk for gate intelligences and hunters Jo Ho-yeol reads a poster on the outside wall of the building with the “perfect translation” function.\nHe looked at it and said to Guild Leader Kim Hansu.\n“Guild Leader, this is the cyberpunk type.”\n“What…….?”\nA future world where civilization is more advanced than Earth.\n“This is troublesome, we’ll have to overhaul our party strategy against monsters.”\nHighly developed civilizations inevitably use high firepower ranged weapons such as firearms and laser weapons.\nFor hunters, who are forced to rely on individual firepower, it’s tricky.\n“For hunters with large individual variation in power, mass-produced models are the enemy, as they have limited stamina.”\n“Yes, but since it’s a group battle, we can go from building to building and distribute our stamina so we won’t be surrounded.”\nHunters are strong. Even D-class Hunters are beyond the reach of most humans. However, they were still living beings, limited by their physical strength.\nRegardless of the type of monster here at the Cheongju Gate, it would be difficult to deal with an army armed with firearms.\n“Let’s use the building over there as our base camp. It’s quite tall, so it’ll be a good place to scout.”\nThe 58 members of the KPP Guild’s raiding party entered a small seven-story commercial building among the crumbling buildings.\nThey prepared for battle and attacked floor by floor, but all they saw was a desolate ruin, with no results.\n“Look at this, Guildmaster. These clothes are pretty cool. Didn’t they just have holograms on them?”\nHe marveled at Park Hye-ri, who was picking up a novelty item from a nearby clothing store.\n“Hye-ri, keep that. If it’s got good technology in it, it’ll be pretty cool.”\nMore advanced civilizations are picky, but it’s not like they don’t have anything to eat. Most of the stuff from more advanced civilizations could be used in the real world if interpreted correctly.\nAlthough most of them are indecipherable, reverse engineering is not without success, and governments are still mining technology from these gates.\n“Ho-yeol, do you see anything?”\n“Umm… nothing really. No NPCs, no monsters.”\nStrange.\nNormally, a field-type gate would have NPCs and monsters.\n“Where’s the Yakt Spinner? I thought that was the boss mob.”\nA quest that popped up as soon as they entered the dungeon.\n“Either obtain or destroy the ‘Wisdom Gem’ guarded by the Yakt Spinner.”\nThe KPP Guild’s primary goal is to defeat the boss monster, Yakt Spinner.\nSince the gate closing condition is the Wisdom Gem, they were going to appraise it before deciding whether to take it or destroy it.\n“I don’t see it at all.”\n“That’s weird…….”\nThe weather was shitty. But still, it’s strange to be in a city this big and not see a single monster, let alone a human.\n“Well, at least we’re not dealing with the Resistance or the army of an evil dictatorship.”\n“Anyway, let’s make sure the perimeter is secure. Get the scouts out and draw a map──”\nSomething passed by.\nThe KPP guild members turned their gaze towards the guild leader who was suddenly interrupted…….\n“Big brother Hansu?”\n“Guild Leader?”\nThe entire upper half of his body, from his navel to his heads, and anything in between, disappeared.\nThey only understood after Guild Leader Kim Hansu’s forearms and head fell to the ground that they had just lost their guild leader.\n“That’s a sniper! Take cover!”\nVice Guild Leader Cho Ho-yeol shouted urgently. The Hunters, who had all been through the prenatal battle, quickly took cover, leaning against the exterior walls of buildings and stalls.\n“What the fuck, how did we not even react?”\nHunters are superhuman and they are far beyond human limits.\nHuman firearms are useless against them at the Gate, but that’s not true on Earth.\nHunters are far better than the average person, but they can still be killed by the high firepower of modern weaponry.\nHowever Kim Hansu was an A-rank Hunter, a tanker, with the highest defense and the best reaction time of anyone but he couldn’t even react and was killed by a single shot?\n-BAM! -BAM! -BAM! -BAM!\nBefore he could say anything, gunfire rained down on the building housing the KPP Guild.\nThe heavy blows are not on the level of the weapon that killed Kim Hansu, but they are heavy enough.\n“Kak!”\n“Dae-oh!”\nA Hunter disappeared, leaving only the lower half of his body behind. Nothing remained where the overwhelmingly destructive hypervelocity cannon had passed.\n“Damn it! We’re going to die at this rate! Do you have the enemy position?”\n“Three o’clock! Can’t get a range because of the sand, sir! We’re too conspicuous up here! We need to get down now!”\n“I understand! Everyone retreat in sequence!”\n“What about the guild leader’s body?!”\n“Ugh… We’ll find it after we get out of here and deal with the enemy!”\nCho Ho-yeol gritted his teeth and gave the order to retreat. Under the barrage of fire, the KPP guild members fled the building, and the fastest moving archer, Hye-ri, was the first one out of the building.\n“What?”\nHye-ri ran out the door with the same momentum as before and touched her neck, which felt strange.\nIt’s ticklish. Why does my throat feel so ticklish──?\n“Hye-ri?”\nThey looked at their fallen comrade’s body and couldn’t help but recognize the drops of blood in the air.\n“……Wire?”\nThere was a wire leading to the entrance of the building. Running without realizing it was there, Hye-ri had literally run through the razor-sharp wire.\n‘Since when?’\nThe Hunters shuddered as they imagined the enemy waiting to strike from the moment they entered the city.\nWho are they? How many? How long have they been watching them?\n“Damn it, hit them all, we have to get out of here somehow!”\nThe hunters’ magic surged but once they realized the wire was there, it was just an annoying hindrance.\nThey cut through it with their shields and slashed at it with their energized swords, trying to get out of the city.\nOf course, the unseen enemy wasn’t watching, unleashing a barrage of machine guns and unknown hypervelocity cannons, hunting down the KPP guild members one by one.\n“Damage-──!”\nIn the brief moment that they recognized something, a ‘wire’ swung like a whip passed through the hunters’ bodies.\n“Huh?”\n“Huh?”\nThe three Hunters collapsed in unison as a silver thread at the speed of sound sliced through their bodies.\n-Puff! PUBBUBBLE!\nThe slaughter was swift, barely giving them time to realize they were dead.\n“Bastard, show yourself!”\nHe screamed in terror and finally, when only one of them remained, it emerged, retrieving the wire.\n“Robots…?”\nEight heavy, thick legs with camera eyes staring in all directions, a nightmarish design, like what you’d get if you turned a spider into a horrific killing machine appeared.\n“Is it you…Is it you, Yakt Spinner.”\nCho Ho-yeol stared at the only ‘monster’ that existed in this gate.\nEight glaring eyes locked with his, and the hideous 240mm supersonic accelerator cannon and 60mm machine guns on its carapace stopped working.\n‘Is it… letting me go?’\nHe didn’t realize that the Yakt Spinner made the economical choice of expanding its ‘limited supplies’.\n‘It ran out of ammo and wants to fight?’\nThe auxiliary joints, which were probably designed for obstacle removal and explosives, are revealed.\nThe recovered ‘wire’ tied to that secondary joint is released by a mechanical arm, and in an instant it is dozens of meters long.\n“Ah…….”\n‘I see, it had no intention of letting me live.’\nIn a brief moment the swung secondary joint sends the wire flying at the speed of sound and a gleaming silver thread reflected in the sunlight as the sandstorm dissipated as the thin, tough silver line passed where Cho Ho-yeol had been.\nCheongju Gate.\nFirst Assault, 58 KPP Hunters.\nNo survivors.\nSecond Assault──\nThird Assault ──\nThe Hunter Association has organized an indefinite suspension of the attack on Cheongju Gate and the Gate Boss Yakt Spinner was raised to Red difficulty.",

      "content": "Chapter 19.1: Hunting the Spider (2)\nThe suggestion of the association’s president, Oh Kang Hyuk, was a pleasant one for Leon.\nAn impregnable gate that no one has been able to close in a year and two months, if he could capture such a place, he would be able to spread his reputation quickly.\nLeon would gladly accept the offer.\n“But, old man, I heard that this gate has been abandoned for a long time, so why are you suddenly interested in it?”\nLeon thought about the prestige he would gain by taking on the impregnable gate, but he weighed the situation calmly.\nIt’s a special gate that won’t cause a dungeon break so there should be a reason why they wanted to resume their assault on such a place.\n“It’s not uncommon, isn’t it, to take a risk and attack a gate because it’s worth it?”\n“Think about it.”\nOh Kang-hyuk smiled bitterly at Leon, who was clearly looking down on him.\nHe was the head of the Hunter Association and the first generation S-class Hunter representing Korea, a living legend.\nBut Oh Kang-hyuk, who had been observing Leon for a while, knew that Leon was treating him very well.\nThe way he treats the so-called “commoners” like Han Ha-ri or Mr. Park of Doojeong Group who approached him was different and considering Leon’s high-handed attitude towards them, even this was pretty good.\n‘The unfortunate ones have to bend.’\nBecause of Leon absolute value is in his ability to cleanse the land of miasma contamination, Oh Kang-hyuk is willing to bend over backwards for the sake of the country.\n“The condition for closing the dungeon, the Grail of Wisdom, has been found in America. It was the reward for a recently cleared Vermilion Gate.”\n“It must be of considerable value.\n“Yes, it is. The Tower studied it and proved that it contained tremendous power, which encouraged the higher-ups of the Association.”\nIn short, they wanted to secure this treasure trove of wisdom, no matter the cost.\n“Who is accompanying me?”\n“There will be contingents from the Golden Lion Guild, one of the Ten Guilds, and from what I’ve heard, the Tower has decided to send a mage of their own.”\n“The Ten Guilds… are they like the knights of this country?”\n“They’re not affiliated with the country, so… they’re more like mercenaries.”\n“Hmm. I see. Protecting the people is a knight’s duty and honor.”\nPresident Oh didn’t bother to point out Leon’s mentality since authoritarians like him are always outraged by disagreements.\nThey are so sure of their point of view that they ignore everything else.\nIf they don’t have the ability, they won’t recognize it, and if they do have the ability, it’s not something that can be fixed by a third party.\n“Okay. On two conditions.”\n“You can tell us anything. As long as it doesn’t violate our principles… we’ll support you.”\n“Well, that’s not much of a condition. First, I need you to spread this king’s name after this battle is won.”\n“We haven’t announced your existence as a survivor yet, Your Majesty. We were planning to do so after you’d sufficiently adjusted to life on Earth…….”\n“I have a general idea of the situation on this planet and your ecology.”\nLeon, who had lived in a world so anachronistic and different, was hard to understand, even with the flexible mindset of Earthlings, but would it be easier the other way around?\n“The second is…….”\nLeon’s gaze traveled beyond the Association’s headquarters, where the Association’s staff… Han Ha-ri… was also present.\n“Here I am!”\nHa-ri rushed over, holding out a prepared notepad.\n“What is this?”\n“A list of cadets to be trained by your majesty guild. It’s a bit of a mishmash, but it’s good enough for now.”\nIt contained the names of several hunters, including D-rank Hunter Koo Dae-sung.\nLeon had noticed one thing in common among the hunters he watched during the test.\n“Most of them are D-rank…C-rank at best. I don’t think anyone would stand out in front of a powerhouse like Your Majesty.”\nOh Kang-hyuk mentioned that he could assign more promising hunters to Leon if he wished, but he shook his head.\n“I’m not looking for a knight. This is enough for now.”\n“We’ll look into it, Your Majesty, but the choice is theirs, so we won’t be able to force them all to join.”\nEven as he said that, Oh Kang Hyuk was confident that they would not refuse his offer.\nAll of them were low-ranked Hunters who couldn’t even get into a decent small or medium-sized guild, let alone one of the Ten Guilds. Would they turn down an offer like that?\nOh Kang-hyuk didn’t think so.\n“If they refuse, they’re out of luck.”\nLeon decided that it didn’t matter if they refused. Rather, he was confident in how generous and blessed my offer was.\n“When will it be?”\n“In three days, we’ll meet in front of the Cheongju Sports Complex.”\n“Good. I’ll show you the Dance of the Lionheart King.”\nPresident Oh Kang-hyuk smiled bitterly and eagerly agreed.\nI’ll have to give Miss Ha-ri a nice year-end bonus, he thought\n.\n* * * *\nThe attack on Cheongju Gate has resumed and the indefinite suspension of the Cheongju Gate, which has been elevated to a red gate, was a high-profile event in Asia.\nIt was a special gate where three raid groups were wiped out by one monster.\nUnable to overcome that single Yakt Spinner, countless Hunters turned Cheongju Gate into a graveyard.\nAs a result, Cheongju Gate has become a nuisance in Cheongju City and has been a source of unrest for the people of Cheongju City ever since.\n-Ahhhhhh!\nIt was then. Citizens gathered at the Cheongju Sports Complex began to cheer.\n“The Golden Lion is here!”\nAs the crowd cheered, reporters fired off flashes at the black vans entering the stadium.\nWhile the association’s staff fends off the crowd, people start to get out of the 20 black vans one by one.\n“Golden Chul! Golden Chul!”\nThe man who stepped out to the cheers of the crowd was over two meters tall.\nAt first glance, he seems intimidating, but he looks like a successful rapper with gold necklaces and bracelets, just like black rappers in the United States. In fact, he was one of the top rappers in Korea.\n“I’m here, citizens of Cheongju!”\nGolden Chul, one of the hippest hunters in the media, smiled and enjoyed the cheers of the citizens.\n“It’s embarrassing, can’t you stop doing that?”\n“Fanservice~ fanservice~ record and sell t-shirts.”\nGolden Chul smirked at her sister who was hanging a t-shirt. She complained about him taking time out of his walk to pose for photos with fans and sign autographs.\n“If you’re going to do that, why not just be an entertainer? You’ve got a lot of douchebags listening to your shitty rap. Give up the guild and start an entertainment agency.”\n“My dear Sister, being a Hunter is more profitable.”\n“Love you.”\nThat was it. Fans flocked to his sister, who was famous as an A-rank hunter even though she was never in the entertainment industry.\n“Kaaaahhhh! Hwang Yeonha is here, too! Sis, look at her!”\n“Is that so, dear My Sister Geum Soon?”\n“I told you not to call me Geum Soon, you golden pig.”\nWhen the name change was over… Hwang Yeon-ha headed for the Cheongju Gate, which was set up by the Association but there was more.\n“Mage Gil Tae-sung, I’ll escort you inside.”\n“Hmm, thank you for your guidance.”\nUnder the polite guidance of the Association’s staff, Mage Gil Tae-sung appeared with his chin held high.\nHe’s a promising member of the Korean branch of The Tower, a combat mage who’s almost a quasi-S in the hunter world, where mages are rare.\nHe was followed by dozens of foreign Hunters.\n“Black Mamba?”\n“The mercenary hunters who are said to be charging over two grand per head?”\n“Is he really that serious?”\nA wizard is at his best when he has a bodyguard and with The Tower full support, Gil Tae-sung mobilized the Black Mamba, a mercenary group of B and A-ranks hunters.\n“Uh, there’s another vehicle coming in.”\n“An Association vehicle?”\nStepping out of the last Association vehicle to arrive was a female with braided red hair.\nStraightening the lapels of her suit, she was the most talked-about recruit in last year’s Academy Draft.\n“Han Ha-ri?”\n“Oh no, the Association is putting Hanhari in?”\nWell, yes, it makes sense. She’s known for being one of the best hunters in the country.\nThere are quite a few A-grade hunters in the country, but it’s her age that makes her stand out.\nShe awakened at the age of fourteen, activating her unique skills while training at the Academy and became the youngest A-class Hunter ever.\nShe was approached by the top 10 guilds in Korea with huge contracts, but she turned them all down and joined the Association.\nEveryone naturally expected her to participate. But…….\n“Your Majesty, we have arrived.”\nShe bowed and guided someone from inside the vehicle and it was a blond foreigner, unexpectedly.\n“Who is this foreigner?”\n“I don’t think he’s with Black Mamba…”\nReporters and onlookers alike were curious about the man’s identity.\n* * * *",

      "content": "Chapter 19.2: Hunting the Spider (2)\nWhen multiple factions want to attack a gate, they need to coordinate in advance.\nWho should tackle the boss first, how to distribute the items that come out, etc… It’s hard not to have conflicts over everything, starting with the order, and these discussions often take days and days.\nIn that sense, this Cheongju Gate strategy is pretty straightforward.\nThere’s only one boss mob, a Yakt Spinner, and the only reward is the Wisdom Gem, which is a mining resource.\n“We’ll hand over all the rewards to the Golden Lion Guild, and all we want is the Wisdom Gem.”\nHwang Yeonha was stunned by the words of Gil Tae-sung.\n“That’s the key, and if you take it, we’ll have nothing to live on.”\nIt was an expected reaction but Gil Tae-sung smiled and said,\n“I’ll give all the credit for defeating the boss to the Golden Lion Guild. In addition, I promise you a reward of 50 billion won if you hand over the gem safely.”\n“”……!””\nHuang Yeonha was stunned by the unexpected amount of money.\nFifty billion? A Legendary ranked weapon was about ten billion.\nEven as a quasi-S-class, she had been saving up for a Legendary-class weapon, but 50 billion was enough to buy not only a weapon, but a full body set.\nHe’s willing to give that much money away?\n‘Why would he do that?’\nHuang Yeonha hesitated, unsure of what to say but,\n“That’s a lot of money. Okay, we get the credit for defeating the boss and you keep the gem.”\n“Hey, you can’t do that…!”\n“My Sister~ We can’t understand it anyway, even the Pentagon couldn’t interpret it, so they gave it to the Tower. What’s the point for us to keep it?”\n“…….”\nGolden Chul wanted to hand it over because he didn’t know the value of the Wisdom Gem but because there’s no point in fighting over something he didn’t understand.\nGolden Chul was known for his toughness and boldness on the battlefield, but he was surprisingly cautious.\n“……60 billion. Oh, no, 55 billion. I’ll… demand that much.”\nAt that, Gil Tae-sung smiled broadly.\n“Let’s just go with 60 billion.”\n“Hmmm…!”\nHwang Yeon-ha regretted that she didn’t ask for 65 billion.\nThe agreement with the Golden Lion was over, and Gil Tae-sung was confident in the outcome of the raid.\n“By the way, aren’t you going to negotiate with him separately?”\nGolden Chul glanced toward the end of the dais, where Han Ha-ri, the Association’s A-rank Hunter, was pouring a cup of tea from a thermos.\n“It’s called barley tea.”\nGil Tae-sung and Hwang Yeon-ha scratched their heads, but Leon gracefully lifted the cup to his lips.\n“Hmm, not bad.”\n“Come to think of it, you were the hunter sent by the association, and I was wondering what kind of person you were, since we needed to free up a seat…….”\nGil Tae-Sung didn’t consider the two of them to be a viable force.\nThere were 49 Black Mamba members, made of B-rank or higher raiders, including himself, and 49 Golden Lion members, one of the Ten Guilds while the Association sent 2 people.\nEven if there was the A-rank Han Ha-ri, what could two people do?\n“Since I don’t want to be the one to talk about it, I’ll make a proposal to the Association. Once we get our hands on the gem, we’ll pay the two of you 500 million regardless of your contribution. Not bad, right?”\n“Fool!”\nRidicule flowed from Leon.\n“What is so ridiculous?”\n“Mage Gil, the Association sent him here and they’re using this year’s Rookie of the Year, Ms. Han Ha-ri, as his servant. Don’t you see the significance of that?”\n“Are you saying he’s stronger than……A-rank hunters?”\nAt the very least, a semi-S-class. Maybe S-class. Of course, neither Gil- Tae-sung nor Golden Lion had ever heard of him.\nBut Golden Chul had an idea of his identity.\n‘The black gate that recently disappeared, most likely a survivor from there.’\nUsually, powerful people who suddenly appeared from nowhere without any connections were survivors.\nHeavenly demons, killer stars, witches, adepts, and countless other named survivors had similar behavior to Leon.\n‘It’s probably some kind of debut match organized by the Association, and they’re pushing him into the Red Gate for nothing.’\nThe Association was overconfident and Gil Tae-sung thought so too.\n“Excuse me… Then we have a new proposal…”\n“Same thing.”\nThe first words out of Leon’s mouth stopped Gil Tae-sung in his tracks.\n“What…?”\nLeon recognized the look on his face. He looked like Leon said something he didn’t deserve.\n“You’re already talking about loot without even standing on the battlefield. Your eyes are full of greed.”\n“Are you disrespecting the mages of the Magic Tower?”\n“What honor has a spellcaster to disrespect?”\nGil Tae-sung was dumbfounded by the unexpected outburst.\n“I don’t know how great a dance you loot-blinded bastards will put on, but…well, I’ll let you lead the way.”\nIt’s like a surrender, but in a very unpleasant way. He was dumbfounded.\n“What, you’re letting us take the lead? So while we’re fighting to the death, you’re going to stand back and watch with your arms crossed?”\nBecause it was the first time he was yelled at in this world Leon brow narrowed.\n“You tease with your tongue, woman.”\n“What are you saying, boy, you want to challenge me to a fight?”\n“You have no right to challenge this King.”\n“You’ve got to be kidding me!”\nShe was restrained by a golden iron grip on her shoulders from behind but her gaze was on Ha-ri, not Leon.\n-Are you not going to take care of the survivors?\nHa-ri shook her head with a grim expression at Golden Chul gaze.\n-I was going to try, but no…….\n-Okay. He’s a fuck-my-way type.\n“Okay, then, Your Majesty, you’re saying that we have first dibs on this place, right?”\nLeon didn’t answer, but silently affirmed.\nFrom what the surviving Hunters have been able to gather, it seems the boss was quite powerful, but whether or not it’s a warrior worthy of facing Leon it’s another matter.\nIt’s unlikely that anyone would have the honor and skill to take on Leon, who has regained some of his strength from spreading the faith of Demera.\n“I… Your Majesty, are you all right?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“The goal of this raid is to spread Your Majesty’s fame…….”\nHa-ri had a point, if the Golden Lion or the Tower took down the Yakt Spinner, he wouldn’t fulfill his goal.\n“No matter how important honor is, it’s not a good look for the Lionheart king to go first, pushing everyone else aside.”\nThis man is an oddball but Ha-ri had learned the true art of socializing by not letting it show.\n* * * *\n“Just like I saw in the video… the weather sucks.”\nCheongju Gate is a city in the middle of a wilderness.\nRandom sandstorms blow in, and those who delay too long are quickly trapped in them. The unlucky raiders were faced with a sandstorm as soon as they entered the gate.\n“Do not enter the city, the Yakt Spinner has a higher chance of appearing inside.”\nGolden Lion had set up a base camp on the outskirts of the city, rather than “inside,” based on the information from the failed raids.\nThere are quite a few buildings on the outskirts of the city, so it’s not hard to set up a base camp.\n“Your Majesty, we’ve set up camp over here!”\n“Hmm.”\nInside the large building, Ha-ri sat down and opened her lunchbox.\n“Your Majesty, I have prepared some scanty food – please eat!”\n“Not enough to complain about on the battlefield.”\nHa-ri looked uneasy though she prepared the meal.\n“How is it?”\n“Hmm… I’m worried if it goes well, and I’m worried if it doesn’t.”\nIf it goes well, that’s the best thing that could happen to Leon and if it doesn’t work out, that’s the worst of it.\n“Actually, it would be best if it worked out without your Majesty having to do anything.”\nEven as she spoke, Ha-ri glanced at Leon and wondered if the anachronistic Lionheart king was going to tell them to stay out of the way so he would have a chance to make a name for himself.\n“Yes, it’s for the best.”\n“What?”\n“If the Lionhearted King doesn’t do it himself, it means the job is lighter. What do you think is the role of a king in the Kingdom of Beasts?”\n“Uhm… ruling… no?”\n“That, of course. But that, too, can be filled by anyone. Unless, of course, they are flawed.”\nThe Lionheart King makes a statement that has no place in an absolute monarchy: that the work of a king can be replaced by anyone.\n“Well, then… as the king of knights, taking the lead… ah.”\nHe had never taken the lead at the Hunan Plain Gate, nor at the Seoul Station Gate…nor at the current Cheongju Gate.\nHe continued to assert himself with his actions that the sword of the king would not be drawn in a petty battle.\n“No way… The title of Lionheart King is…….”\n“The last bastion.”\nAt those words, Ha-ri swallowed hard.\nAll this time, she and the Association had thought of Leon as a barbarian king from the Middle Ages, with the power of faith thrown in for good measure.\nBut if he’s telling the truth, Leon is more than just a ruler. Nor was he a hardened knight or general.\nHe is the last bastion of the Lionheart Kingdom. And when he stepped forward, it meant that the final weapon would be deployed.\n“Do you understand? The very fact that the Lionheart King himself has to step forward is a disgrace to the knights and means that the situation is serious.”\nAs he spoke, he gave a rare sigh.\n“It looks like this king will have to do the heavy lifting once again on your pathetic, weak behalf. I miss the glory of this king’s Knights.”\nIt was an eerie foreshadowing as if something big was about to happen and he would have to step in.\n“But we have an S-class Hunter here, the Golden Lion Guild, and a Wizard from the Magic Tower.”\nThere was only one opponent and even if I was a killing machine with a terrible record, they should be able to handle the raid with an S-rank hunter and a mage…\n“I’ll admit that hunters are a bit more powerful than normal humans.”\nLeon snorted, sneering at the superhumans of modern Earth.\n“But they don’t know about war. The outskirts have been safe so far, I’m sure, having only fought three battles.”\n“What? What’s that…….?”\n“You call yourselves raiders. You’re supposed to recognize patterns in monsters and counter them. How ridiculous.”\nHa-ri felt uneasy at Leon’s words.\n“The long-lived learn to adapt to circumstances. There’s no pattern to it, and I think that Yakt Spinner is a born warrior.”\nAnd then, as if on cue, the proof begins.\n-Kaaaaaahhhh!\n-What, what, this!\n-It’s the enemy! He’s attacking──!\nScreams echoed eerily in the sandstorm as Yakt Spinner attacked the camp.",

      "content": "Chapter 20: Hunting the Spider (3)\nThe sandstorm that blew in from the outskirts of the city did more than just block the view.\nThe gusts of wind pounded the ground, shook the buildings, and drowned out most sound.\nIt was a perfect opportunity to ambush the invaders and Yakt Spinner made its way to the outskirts.\n[Yappy. I’m done here.]\nThe Last Order, from the highest commanders was to kill all the unknowns that have invaded the city.\nWith no resupply, no repairs can be expected and support being non-existent the only way to win is with maximum efficiency and minimum damage.\nThe Yakt Spinner approached the Hunters’ camp slowly and cautiously, using the sandstorm as camouflage.\nThe Hunters were alert with their keen senses, but they were unable to overcome their limitations, and the Yakt Spinner had city-level backup.\nDespite their inexperience, the Yakt Spinner analyzes the camp thoroughly and finds that there are no guards against machines.\nIt begins mapping in real time, with long-range scans and every single enemy number then it blithely sidesteps the flimsy perimeter and lets the sandy breeze wash over it, blending into the darkness and noise of the storm.\n“Ugh….I can’t even see this.”\nA puppet has wandered away from the camp and is alone in a remote area so the Yakt Spinner immediately runs the figure’s measurements.\nThe latest invaders were lightly built, but wore metal armor. Even more bizarrely, they come armed with bladed weapons, not guns or artillery.\nThey were only categorized as a level one threat but there was the potential to bring in allies.\nWhen dealing with large groups, Yakt Spinner found it safer and less risky to attack them individually.\n“Whoosh!”\nHunter, who was watching the perimeter through the windshield of the building’s outer wall, hadn’t noticed Yakt Spinner presence.\nIt moved its huge body made of steel in a creepily silent manner when──\n“Dude, why are you peeing in there?”\n“Huh, Jackson.”\nIts crab-like body leaned back down.\nThe approaching Hunter, the entity called Jackson rubbed shoulders with him, pretending to be overly friendly.\n“What, what, what’s going on?”\nHe was a member of the same Black Mamba mercenary organization, but not one to make such over-the-top gestures. Flustered, he says something, and Jackson shushes him.\n“Shut up. Shut up. We need to get out of here quietly, unless you want to die…….”\nHe alerted his coworker about the threat in a voice barely audible in the sandstorm.\nHaving been warned by his companion, he took a step forward without even looking at his surroundings, but──\n[I…have…to…dig…out…of…the…dragon.]\n-Apply a noise filter to the speech file. Sentence reinterpretation complete. Play──\nThe voice buried in the sand was filtered out by the noise filter and analyzed into a clear voice file.\n“They’re coming. Be quiet. We need to get out of here quietly, or we’ll be found…….”\n-Pack!\nThe sound of a secondary joint moving and a whip cracking was lost in the sand.\n* * * *\nIt wasn’t until the twelfth victim appeared that the Hunters realized that Yakt Spinner was attacking.\nIt was a grisly ambush on the outskirts of the camp, and the last of the Hunters to be cut down by the silent wire cutters was the one who didn’t die instantly.\n“Off!!!”\n-Kaaaaaah!\nThe Hunter who had his lower half cut off by the wire cutters swung an energized sword, but his struggle was meaningless as a large shadow fell over him.\n“Oh, no.”\nA pair of armored legs weighing over five tons each crushed the Hunter of the Black Mamba Mercenaries.\n-Kwazik!\nThe Hunters, sensing the commotion, rushed forward to find their fellow Hunter disemboweled and Yakt Spinner glowing with an eerie light.\nThe joints, stuck together with chewy bits of meat, creak and squeak as if they haven’t been replaced and maintained in years and the sound sends chills down the spines of the hunters, as if it were the wailing of a victim’s soul stuck in a piece of meat.\n“Yakt Spinner!”\nThe voice, muffled by the sandstorm, barely reached his kin but the Yakt Spinner attacked.\n-Bang! Boom!\nAfter a murderous barrage of 60 mm machine gun fire the heavily armored Hunters had their entire bodies bounced off, but the lightly armored Hunters were torn limb from limb.\nThe excessive violence takes its toll on the Hunters.\nEven as the sandstorm’s dirt pounded the concrete, the sound of a shell’s impact imprinted itself in their minds as an eerie meat grinder.\n“Cover! Cover!”\nThe words are barely audible, but none of these men are fools enough to stand idly by on the wide open plain and they hurriedly duck into the buildings to escape the machine gun fire that pierced the sandy wind.\nThe Yakt Spinner wide-angle lens calculated the Hunters’ paths and where the most Hunters were hiding, which buildings were deteriorating, how many rebars were holding up the concrete……and which ones would do the most damage if knocked down.\nThe Yakt Spinner railgun fired a round, generating an electromagnetic force for supersonic acceleration.\n-Bam!\nThe projectiles from the 240mm railgun reached Mach 3 in an instant and a sonic boom blasts through the building.\n-Bam!\nThrough five columns, to be exact, the building began to crumble as Yakt Spinner exquisitely destroyed the vulnerability of the building the Hunters were hiding in.\n“Holy shit…!”\nTheir last words were buried with the crumbling concrete.\nAs Hunters with superhuman physical abilities, they wouldn’t be killed by being crushed by the building, but it was enough to incapacitate a dozen of them in an instant.\n“What the fuck, what kind of monster…!”\nThey couldn’t leave the building because if they did, they’d immediately fall victim to machine gun fire.\nYakt Spinner had gotten over its fears and prepared to fire a second round at the huddled Hunters.\nThe powered-up railgun was about to bring another building down to pinpoint when-──\n“Fuck you.”\nSomething slammed into Yakt Spinner with the sound of a shell being fired.\n-Bam!\nWith a dizzying impact sound, Yakt Spinner joints collapsed.\nFor the first time since the attack, Yakt Spinner wide-angle lens finds its attacker: a gleaming golden iron clad figure wielding a massive hammer.\n-Gee!\n-Cooka-cooka-cooka-cooka-cooka!\nA barrage of machine gun fire was shot but Golden Chul raises his shield to block as the sixty millimeter rounds pound into him without mercy.\n-Kirik?\nBut Golden Chul shield was solid and it didn’t even crack under the baptism of fire.\n“It’s a legendary shield! Do you think it’s going to be pierced by shells? Geum-soon!”\n“I told you not to call me Geum-soon!”\nHwang Yeon-ha’s weapon is her fist and a unique grade armor that stretches out like a ferocious lion’s mane.\nLike a rocket boost, it absorbed magic power and generated a thrust.\n-Boom!\nThe fist, sparkling with golden magic, slammed into Yakt Spinner joints and its legs buckled under the impact, momentarily stumbling.\nAt that moment, a magic circle unfolded in the sky.\n“Good job tying him up.”\nCombat Mage Gil Tae-sung threw a thunderbolt at Yakt Spinner whose legs are bound by the Hwang siblings.\n-Kwalung!\nThe thunderbolt flashes across the carapace’s armor, sending a tremendous charge through it.\nThe blow would be fatal to a machine so Yakt Spinner completes its self-diagnosis in 0.8 seconds and makes a decision.\n[Emergency purge of overloaded wires. Radar system down.]\nWith the systems he’d relied on for navigation down, Yakt Spinner was forced to rely on his wide-angle lens to locate his enemies and that’s not good when you’re surrounded.\n[Limited resources authorized. Activating RWR equipment in the city. Substitute target.]\nIn a city with crumbling infrastructure, it activates the electronics it’s been building for years.\nObservation equipment hidden throughout the city mobilizes and becomes the eyes of Yakt Spinner.\n[Threat level 3, prioritized for elimination.]\n“Ugh, look at this guy!”\n“He’s running! Chase him!”\nShaken by the brothers’ attacks, Yakt Spinner climbed the surrounding buildings to escape their pursuit.\nThe dashing, multi-purpose machine darted from building to building, aiming its 60mm cannon at specific targets.\nMachine gun fire rained down on mage Gil Tae-sung but he was heavily protected by the Black Mamba mercenary hunters.\n“Huh.”\nTae-sung shattered a bead-like tool against the hail of machine gun fire, and a transparent membrane unfolded.\n-Koo-koo-koo-koo!\nThe hail of machine gun rounds distorted into impossible trajectories and landed in the wrong place.\n“What, what…….?”\nAs the Black Mamba mercenaries escorting him stared at the station commander in disbelief, Gil Tae-sung smirked.\n“It’s a magic tool engraved with a distorted force field enchantment developed to target Yakt Spinner. It’s absolutely impenetrable by firearms.”\nThe power of firearms comes from their rate of fire and accuracy. No matter how many dozens or hundreds of rounds are fired, they are useless if the point of impact is distorted.\nIt’s a disposable and expensive tool, but he was up against Yakt Spinner with a difficulty level of Red so he must be prepared for this──\n[Hazard anomaly observed. Initiate maintenance operation.]\nHowever, the opponent is an AI killing machine that has already faced three raids, and even observations outside the laws of physics are subject to calculation for it.\n[Analysis complete. Strike points D15, S37, and F11.]\n-Thump! Thump! Thud!\nDarting from building to building, evading the Hunters’ pursuit, the short bursts of machine gun fire hit the distorted force field.\nIt lands in a completely wrong spot, a far cry from the usual ghostly impact point but the distorted shell bends with a snap and strikes the Black Mamba mercenary hunters in the temporal region.\n“Kuck?!”\n“What the hell!”\nThe trajectory of the bullet was completely unexpected but the distorted force field bent it into an improbable trajectory and hit the Hunters.\n“No way!”\nHe analyzed it in such a short time? Is that even possible?\n“Mage Gil Tae-sung, turn off the distortion force field, we can’t defend!”\nArtillery fire poured in one after another. Not a conventional firefight, but sniping with precision shots, calculated by a city maintenance supercomputer that no human could ever hope to keep up with.\n“Damn it! What are you all doing? Deal with him!”\nGil Tae-sung shouted urgently, and the Huang siblings and the Golden Lion Guild immediately tried to eliminate Yakt Spinner. But at that moment, Golden Chul saw something and shouted urgently.\n“Stop!”\n“……?”\nHuang Yeon-ha and the rest of the Golden Lion Hunters stopped in their tracks at Golden Chul’s urgent words, and they realized why he said that.\n‘Wire?’\n‘He didn’t just run away.’\n‘When did he do all of this?’\nYakt Spinner had left wires everywhere as he weaved in and out of buildings to escape the Huangs’ pursuit. It was as if the entire area was surrounded by a giant spider’s web.\nFor a few seconds, the Hunters were immobilized and Yakt Spinner railgun pointed at Gil Tae-Sung.\n“Ah, no…!”\nJust as the railgun bullets begin their supersonic velocity…Yakt Spinner rear view camera catches a strange object.\n-Dag-dag-dag-dag!\n“Huh?”\nEveryone’s faces twist as four pure white legs stretched out.\nThe soft mane flutters like cotton candy as they follow the downy white fur. But the muscles packed throughout its body gave the creature an intensity that made it impossible to ignore. It was──\n“……Horse?”\n“”Horse?””\nAs everyone watches in awe, a stalwart Stallion emerges, his sturdy frame and magnificently decorated shining armor.\n“Long time no see, old friend.”\nLeon throws his arms around the neck of the fierce Stallion, and the ancient god willingly carries his ally on his back.\nStroking its glowing mane, Leon pointed his holy spear at Yakt Spinner and called out.\n“Listen, warrior!”\nIt’s a ridiculous sight on the modern battlefield, but the thick, sour aura emanating from the spear and the horse makes the crowd’s jaws drop.\nThey cannot deny it with reason, but understand with instinct that this was something else.\n“The bravery of charging forward single-handedly against a multitude of enemies is praised by the Lionheart King!”\nHe first praised the outstanding warrior.\n“I grant you the honor of dueling with this Lionheart King. I grant you permission to challenge me, warrior!”\nHe gave him the right to apply for the duel.\nSeeing this generous and merciful gesture from the Lionheart King, Huang Yeon-ha inadvertently spat out her true feelings.\n“…………Is he an idiot?”\nAt this moment, no one could deny that they were all thinking that.",

I grant you permission to challenge me, warrior!”\nThere is no need to interpret the meaning of the words and Yakt Spinner aimed his railgun at the horseman, who waited with stupid honesty.\nThe projectile aimed at Gil Tae-sung pulsed with super-electron velocity.\n[Railgun acceleration timing set. Output 13%.]\nIt had no choice but to conserve the limited energy in its reserve cap and shoot as much as possible but it was enough for a human-sized opponent.\nThere is no ‘creature’ that can survive being shot in the face by this doomsday blaster. If there is, it’s either an otherworldly being or a being with the power of metamorphosis──\n“Run, my best friend.”\n────!!\nThe stallion responded willingly and its four legs pounded the ground like a storm, charging toward the enemy in front of it.\nA knight on horseback charging, with his lance pointed reminded people of a scene from history.\nThe sight of a knight of old, clad in honor, glory, valor, and strength, charging down the road was a sight to behold. But these weapons are nothing more than relics of a bygone era.\nWhat is the point charging on horseback when the profession of hunter has already pushed the limits of humans?\nHeavily armored, lightly armored, and armed with super-fast guns. Do I even need to put the absurdity into words?\n-Quang!\nThe supersonic cannon reaches unrecognizable speed.\nThis is the difference between mechanical and biological weapons. An overwhelming difference in firepower that… Leon must have been fully aware of it.\n“A knight will not be defeated by a cowardly ranged weapon!”\nThe holy power flowing from Leon’s entire body formed a thin film in front of him.\n-Quang!\nThe shots and the membrane collided and the supersonic cannon was surprisingly stopped by a thin membrane. No…it wasn’t just stopped. It bent and bounced off, as if forced by something.\n“……?!”\nFor a moment, even Yakt Spinner high-performance AI stopped computing and logic had failed to explain what was happening in front of it.\nYakt Spinner saw the mage and recorded his pitiful attempts to block his guns with anomalous physics but it understood that the intangible energies of the ritual have physical effects. But not this one, this time is different.\nIt didn’t go through a process of clashing, blocking, and then penetrating or defending. It just bounced off. There was no process, just a result.\nWith the protection of the Holy Law arrow shield any ‘ranged attack’ is ‘deflected’ ‘once’ and ‘unconditionally’.\nThe Holy Laws are practiced by all Holy Knights as though it were their very breath.\nThe miracles of the Holy Knights, mankind’s most powerful super weapon were the laws that enforce the rules.\nShrugging off the railgun fire, the knight charged forward at an unbelievable speed.\nIn an instant, the knight was in front of Yakt Spinner, scattering the remnants of storm.\n-Beep!\nThe machine judged that his weapon is an old-fashioned jousting lance, and while he’s fast, there’s a limit to the impact power of mass, no matter how much speed he gains.\nUnlike the Hunters, who imbue their weapons with superhuman movement and a special energy known as “magic,” this spear contains no energy, it’s pure physics and penetrating power.\nThreat level 0.\nA threat it didn’t even need to respond to. At most, it will hit its leg and stop, and then── Figure out a reasonable response.\nThe machine’s rationality has made an irreversible choice.\n-Thud!\nThe machine didn’t understand the situation if the sensor hadn’t recorded the “leg piercing” sound it detected and if the secondary camera hadn’t captured the pudding-like penetration of the joint’s heavy armor,\nYakt Spinner wouldn’t have even hypothesized that it might have been the man’s lance that went through its leg in an instant.\n[Impossible. Impossible.]\nThe AI denied the hypothesis because the tough armor on his joints was not meant to be broken by the ridiculous, archaic practice of lance-charging.\nThe framework of “common sense” established by science and the laws of physics was inescapably a product of the old civilization.\n-Bam!\n“……??!”\nYakt Spinner wobbled, its joints creaking from the impact of the swung holy spear.\n“Sturdy.”\n[Information refinement. Reanalyzing.\nUnable to analyze logic. Unable to understand physics.\nEnemy threat level forcibly increased.\nThreat Level 5.]\nYakt Spinner response to the forced threat assessment of the battle was to retreat.\nYakt Spinner takes a huge leap, risking the strain on its joints to face an enemy it would normally ignore or crush.\nOne of its legs is blown off, and another joint is crushed, but Yakt Spinner secondary joints are sufficiently distant to allow it to move.\nWire cutters swung like whips as the murderous whip that had cut countless Hunters in half swung toward Leon.\nIt was a supersonic wire whip that Hunters with superhuman vision wouldn’t even recognize. However, the Hunter’s vision was no match for Leon’s and he simply raised his spear and coiled the wire around it.\nYakt Spinner pulls on the coiled wire and naturally, a battle of strength is established between the two.\n“A battle of strength with me. This is fun.”\nLeon pulls the wire around the spear.\nThe secondary joints, which are normally used to clear minor obstacles and explosives, are unable to withstand the force of Leon’s pull.\n-Boom!\nHaving lost his railgun and wire cutters, Yakt Spinner unleashes a frenzied barrage of machine gun fire.\nLanding on the roof of a building, Yakt Spinner focuses all of its fire on Leon, but the Stallion quickly escapes the barrage with an astonishing sequence of moves.\nEven though it was a move that wasn’t expected to hit, the maneuver still managed to widen the range between them.\nMachine gun fire can only go so far and the goal was to keep Leon away from it, and it worked. Once again, it fired the railgun at…….\n“────!!!”\nThe next moment, something ripped through the air, and it took 0.02 seconds before the camera sensors realized it was the spear Leon was holding.\nThe machine’s reaction was too late, and the penetrating power of the spear pierced Yakt Spinner left side and shattered the railgun fuselage.\nWith half of its sensors and its railgun destroyed, Yakt Spinner staggers as its drive joints are slow to calculate their movements. Meanwhile, the fire continues.\nAt this point, the only hope for retreat is to keep the enemy at bay.\nTo a human, the wound would have been instant death, and the creaking of the crushed joints was like a roar of rage or pain.\n-Crunch, crunch, crunch!\nYakt Spinner disappeared into the darkness of the sandstorm, leaving behind the creaking mechanical sounds of a killing machine from a cheesy B-movie.\n* * * *\nWith the sandstorm still raging outside, the Hunter’s Camp is deserted.\nYakt Spinner had attacked and killed many. It was the sense of urgency that brought the individualistic Hunters together.\n“How many people are dead?”\n“Seventeen that we can piece together. I didn’t count the ones crushed by the building.”\n“That’s about thirty dead.”\nA third of the Hunters in the Hunter camp had been killed in a single raid.\nIf Yakt Spinner hadn’t retreated, the damage would surely have been worse.\n“Was it fortunate or unfortunate that the railgun was destroyed…….?”\nThe Hunters’ eyes fell on the man who had single-handedly defeated Yakt Spinner.\n‘……Who is he?’\n‘A Hunter that is not even recorded in the latest data.’\n‘This guy…didn’t use magic or anything? Did he actually defeat that monster using only his physical abilities?’\nThere were many guesses, but nothing was certain, and no one could answer their questions.\nWhat was certain was that this man was the only one with the power to single-handedly defeat Yakt Spinner.\n“You are much stronger than I thought.”\nGolden Chul was convinced by Leon’s display of power. This man is a survivor, and an incredibly powerful one at that.\n‘Maybe he’s out of the norm.’\nIf he is, we need to be completely cooperative with him because once he’s established in Korea, the country will revolve around him.\n“…….”\nThis was also true for Hwang Yeon-ha and Gil Tae-sung. If it wasn’t for him, the damage caused by Yakt Spinner would have been much greater.\nGil Tae-song, in particular, was getting impatient.\n“If you don’t mind, why don’t you make a deal with us? As long as we get the Orb of Wisdom, we’ll give you our full support in the future──”\n“You’re boring.”\nWith a single word, Leon shattered all possibilities.\n“I expected you to be a spellcaster and a powerhouse, but in the end, you’re just a joke. The only one worthy of being a true knight is you.”\nHis gaze and expression were drained of even the slightest hint of interest, but his arrogance remained unwavering as he glanced at the hunters and mages.\n“At least be qualified and know this king. It’s not easy to earn the right to face the Knight King…”\nMaintaining his arrogant and dismissive demeanor to the end, he walks away. Only the bushy-haired swordswoman hurriedly followed him, bowing her head.\n“Ah~ What a strange survivor.”\nGolden Chul smiled bitterly in disbelief and Gil Tae-sung’s lips trembled with shame…….\n“Shit… Stay the fuck away.”\nUnexpectedly, Hwang Yeon-ha sent him a longing glance like a child.\n* * * *\nYakt Spinner dragged his creaking joints as he entered the maintenance building.\n“Guard the seal. Don’t let anyone get close.”\nIn all his years of serving the Supreme Order, he’d seen parts replaced as they wore out, but he’d never seen them smashed and crushed like this.\nYakt Spinner slowly dismantled the bolts that held the joints together in the way.\n-Thud!\n[Falling joints. No spare parts.]\nYakt Spinner diligently searches through the remaining armament and parts inventory in the repair shop.\nMain armament unavailable. Five standard rounds, thirty-six homemade rounds, provisionally discarded.\nSub-armament 60 mm machine gun available. 657 rounds of ammunition. Need to make homemade ammunition.\nResupply wire cutters. Secondary joints diagnosed, damaged. Causes severe imbalance in weaponry.\nDispose of Secondary Arms.\nPrimary armor discarded.\nConclude that it is not possible to kill a Threat Level 5 with only a secondary weapon.\nThreat Level 5, originally intended for enemy main battle tanks, attack helicopters, or Class 1 bio-weapons.\nYakt Spinner recognizes Leon as something beyond a Type 1 bio-weapon, a new entity from a hostile force that hasn’t appeared in nearly a millennium.\nHow to react to a new entity that is more agile than it, and capable of unknown destructive power?\nThe AI compared forces, ran battle simulations, identified effective tactics, and selected and executed the most likely winning options.\nIt outfitted itself with modular robotic arms from the garage and began tearing its body apart piece by piece.\nNo need for thick armor that can withstand the guns of a main battle tank. Peeling away.\nNo need for load-bearing legs. Remove two more of the six remaining legs. The remaining legs are also dismantled with minimal armor.\nAfter removing the railgun’s remaining barrel, which had become obsolete as a weapon, and the dedicated battery for energy, the 100-ton multipurpose machine was down to 46 tons.\nConsolidated the city’s collected remnants to replace ammo-limited firearms due to lack of constant supply.\nSupplied with steel wires and equipped with additional robotic arms for maintenance, Yakt Spinner looked very different from the original catalog.\nThe legs had been stripped of armor to the point where they could only defend against rifle bullets and explosives,\nThe joints were skeletal, but sufficient to handle the reduced weight.\nWhat the spider lost in firepower and defense, it gained in mobility.\nThe machine’s strict rationality had stripped it of everything unnecessary, preparing it to repel its foes.\nAnd yet──\n[Yappy. Thank you for protecting the city.]\nIn the old memory module, the undestroyed voice was still playing.",

      "content": "Chapter 22.1: Hunting the Spider (5)\nAs the sandstorm intensified, the Hunters cautiously moved from building to building, heading for the center of the city.\nDespite Yakt Spinner terrible fighting prowess, the Hunters’ momentum was uneven.\nYakt Spinner had taken heavy damage and retreated. Its main armor and joints were undoubtedly shattered and the Hunters thought it would take a long time for it to repair itself.\nEven with Leon’s refusal to cooperate, the attacks of S-class Hunter Golden Chul, semi-S-class Hwang Yeon-ha, and mage Gil Tae-sung were still effective.\nYakt Spinner was not invincible and the Hunters were confident.\n“But will it be okay without that weird knight?”\n“It’s not like we’re going to miss him.”\n“No, but still… if he can overpower that monstrosity, isn’t he stronger than our guild leader?”\nEven among the Hunters, Leon’s identity is a topic of conversation and the Hunters who had some experience in this area come to the same conclusion.\n“Most likely a survivor, and survivors tend to be selfish.”\n“Still, it’s not that bad, is it?”\n“Where did he come from, anyway? I haven’t heard of any Survivors coming out of the Gate lately.”\nThe Hunters tried to piece together Leon’s comet-like appearance with what they knew but even they couldn’t remember anyone that resembled him.\nThe man was different and they instinctively sensed that he was an alien to this world.\n“Wait.”\nThe Hunter in the lead halted the others with a wave of his hand and pointed a finger as if he’d found a dull metal.\n“Two hundred and fifty meters ahead, on the roof. Machine guns out. That’s him.”\nAt his words, the Hunters behind him cautiously checked out the shape.\nIts distinctive crab-like fuselage was exposed at an awkward angle to snipe with a rocket.\nLuckily, there was a ten-story building across the street from Yakt Spinner with a good view. Sniping from up there would leave him helpless.\n“Ranged dealers, make your way up to the building opposite. We’ll wait here. If he sees us, we’ll distract him and buy time.”\nAt his command, the Ranged Hunters headed to the building opposite. It would take them a while to get up the stairs, breathlessly and slowly.\n“We found it.”\nThe hunter smiled and waited for the signal from his colleagues up the building.\nOne minute, three minutes, five minutes……but he didn’t move for fear of being spotted by Yakt Spinner, but no matter how long he waited, the signal didn’t come.\n“What are these guys doing up here? Send someone up there and check it out.”\n…………\nHe cautiously sends his colleague up, but there’s no sign for a long time and when the hunter notices something strange-──\n“Huh?”\nThe hunter felt his vision swim and as his vision spun, he saw the familiar shape of a spider.\n“Y-you?”\nSomething… different… much smaller… no, wait, if that was Yakt Spinner, then what the hell was the rooftop entity they had been watching all this time──\nHis gaze shot up into the air, his subtle vision catching a glimpse of the building’s rooftop.\nA large carapace and there was also a ‘model’ of a crude machine gun on a wide armored plate that seemed to have been partially removed.\n“Huh?”\nBy the time the man’s head hit the ground, dozens of whips had already been swung.\n* * * *\nYakt Spinner lived up to its name and its groundbreaking lightweight maneuverability allowed it to climb across building facades wire cutters wielded by a multitude of robotic arms emitted a distinctive air-splitting sound that crushed their prey.\nIt slaughtered the Hunters with nothing but its wire cutters, moving deftly on its lightweight fuselage and flexible legs.\n“Shoot! Hit it with something to make it stop!”\nSomeone shouted, almost in a panic and at the same time, a magic missile fired in the gale force winds of the sandstorm chased after Yakt Spinner.\n-Kirik?\nWith a marvelous movement, Yakt Spinner stretched itself vertically and deftly inserted itself into the narrow gap between the building and the wall as two Magic Missiles slammed into the building’s exterior wall, unable to keep up with its precise dodge.\nThe three faster Magic Missiles realized they had lost their targets and turned vertically and the bolts of magic soar into the sky, straight for Yakt Spinner as it crawls through the gap in the building.\nIt can’t maneuver fast enough in such a tight spot so a muzzle spins and the magic missile explodes in midair.\nThe AI is perfectly capable of intercepting Magic Missiles and the Hunters who witnessed it gaped.\n“Crazy… is that possible?”\n“It’s not like it’s acrobatics or anything…….”\nThey couldn’t imagine it. How could they understand the strong artificial intelligence of a killing machine born only to fight?\nAs they stood in stunned silence, Yakt Spinner caught up to them in a flash.\n“Shit! Take cover! Take cover!”\nThe robotic arms swung the wire cutters they held and the onslaught of Yakt Spinner, who had switched to wire as its primary weapon, had killed over two dozen Hunters so far.\nThe Hunters swallowed their screams and sprinted as even the wizard’s ranged support failed.\nThe horror of wanting to live and not wanting to die consumes them.\nAfter a desperate run, the few surviving Hunters reach a cemetery, where they stumble over overgrown weeds and stone beaks.\n“Kwak…!\nRolling on the ground with the momentum of his run, the Hunter gasped for breath and tried to crawl away.\n-Screech! Screech!\nBut the four-legged Yakt Spinner was closing in, and the hunter despaired as he realized he couldn’t escape.\n“Oh, no. Help me… Lord, I don’t want to die…….”\nHe used the shabby headstone next to him as a shield, begging for mercy. A mercy he doesn’t even believe in himself.\n-Geek….\nYakt Spinner skidded to a halt in front of Hunter, machine guns trained on him.\nThe killing machine’s logic circuits, which had never let an intruder live before, made their judgment.\n[Second Logic – Priority. Destroy intruders.]\n[Third Logic – Priority. Destroy invaders.]\nThe machine guns open fire. No matter the weapon, Yakt Spinner can overwhelm the Hunters. But──\n[Autonomous Judgment. Logic decision hacking. Sub-logic silence. Forced prioritization.]\nThe weapons are retracted and at that moment of pause with all those weapons retracted, a magical arrow rained down from the sky.\nThe magic arrow strikes Yakt Spinner.\n“That’s it! I got it right!”\nYakt Spinner turns his wide-angle lens on the Hunters who attacked him. It’s an attack that can be easily dodged by maneuvering inside the cemetery. But…….\n[Final decision. Prioritize. Protect citizens.]\nIt turned to the tombstone that the hunter hid behind and knew that fighting here would lead to inevitable losses so Yakt Spinner decided to retreat.\n“Huh?”\nYakt Spinner ignores the hunter, who makes a stunned sound, and runs out of the cemetery. The hunter, who was being chased, couldn’t speak but was relieved to be alive.\n“Yakt Spinner is getting away!”\n“Chase!”\nHe hops from building to building on his four remaining legs, running as far away from the cemetery as he can. Yakt Spinner didn’t even fight back, not wanting to risk any losses.\n[Yappy. Look, I made a crown out of flowers!]\nThe safety of the citizens was the most important thing to prioritize. Even if it was a citizen who was already dead.\n* * * *\nYakt Spinner has returned to the repair shop once again.\nHe repaired the damage he took in battle, resupplied the broken wire, and reloaded his ammunition.\nIt hasn’t been easy maintaining my body in a shop that hasn’t even been a regular facility, but he’s been able to keep up.\n[Protect the seal. Don’t let anyone get close.]\nIt was the last order in the machine’s chain of command but the AI’s sobering realization is that it was becoming impossible to fulfill that order.\nIf it stops this intrusion, what next? At some point, it will fail. Its time of fighting was coming to an end.\nReplacing broken parts with homemade ammunition, wire, and parts made by melting down the city’s scrap metal, he connected to the remaining surveillance cameras around the city.\n-Estimated enemy survivors: 49. Level 5 threat alive, Level 3 threat alive, multiple Level 1 threats. 35.7% chance of defeat.\n-Combat continues.\nNothing changes and the machine merely fulfills its orders.\nWith a grunt of effort, the machine reaches its full capacity and-─\n“Did you have fun with the minions?”\n“…………!?”\nThe knight had been watching the scene from beginning to end.\n* * * *",

      "content": "Chapter 22.2: Hunting the Spider (5)\nLeon worships chivalry. Nay, he is chivalry incarnate.\nHe abhorred cowardly assaults and sought out fair fights. Of course, his opponents don’t always fight fair.\nHis many enemies harassed him with raids, plots, and all manner of sorcery. But this is no reason for him to forsake the virtues of knighthood.\nHe was the kind of man who would smash battlefield intrigue and shadowy sorcery from the front.\nHe was the embodiment of chivalry: broken, but unbreakable. That’s what made him strong.\nIt was for this reason that he waited for Yakt Spinner to finish its maintenance.\nWith very few exceptions, a knight’s honor is important, even if it’s a non-human being.\nLeon had encountered many dimorphic races, some of them completely alien to humanity.\nHe was an Earthling, but he had lived in the world of dimorphs and xenomorphs for much longer than that.\nYakt Spinner inhumanly cold armor plates and structurally different joints were just part of its personality.\n“For a robot, you’re majestic and powerful. It will be hard for those creatures out there to take you down.”\nBefore he could finish his sentence, a swinging wire slashed across Leon’s path. He ducked out of the way, but it struck a nerve with the Lionheart.\n“Is it too much to ask for honor from a machine?”\nYakt Spinner eyes glowed red.\nArmament check: 480 rounds of 60 mm machine guns.\nFour wire cutters, two tons of last resort in the repair shop.\nSupersonic whip after supersonic whip.\nThe Wire Cutters’ trajectories, their speeds, all calculated to keep them from tangling with each other and supersonic whips struck Leon from the ground, overhead, left, right, and center, with no way to dodge but Leon gripped his holy sword and parried the onslaught.\nHis opponent’s evasions were calculated, and the only attack that reached Leon was a wire cutter, which he deflected with his holy sword.\n“………….”\nThe mixture of molten iron ore and hardened steel should have shattered under the whip of the supersonic wire cutters but the iron sword remained intact and even the common sense in the machine’s database couldn’t understand it.\nYakt Spinner used his four legs to disrupt Leon with even more agile moves than before.\nIt’s good if its opponent holds his ground like a heavy tank because immobile targets are just fodder for machine guns.\n-Tut-tut-tut-tut-tut!\nThe machine gun opens fire and the first round misses as it should but Yakt Spinner analyzes the trajectory of the flying shells and makes adjustments before hitting Leon.\n-Thud!\nThe concrete crumbles as it hits the ground, sending the figure soaring.\nIn the next moment, after the rising concrete blocked his view, Yakt Spinner condensed the hydraulic springs in his joints and leapt away.\n-Quang!\nA spear pierces through the spot where Yakt Spinner was just a moment ago. Yes, he expected it.\nHe analyzed the combat patterns of Threat Level 5 enough that he assumed every eventuality.\nSpears appearing out of thin air, iron swords that don’t break at all, or shattering tank-grade armor with sheer force. It all defied common sense and logic, but the threat in front of him was real.\nThe sound of a door closing was caught by the noise filter and sounds don’t lie, even if they can’t be detected through debris.\nYakt Spinner slammed into Leon like an artillery shell as he ran against the wall but before he knew it, Leon mounted his summoned beast and retrieved his holy spear.\nYakt Spinner couldn’t understand how an organism can run that fast but he’s long since abandoned logic. The lightened Yakt Spinner darted between the maintenance buildings, blocking Leon’s approach.\n“Stallion, he wants to play hide-and-seek with us.”\nThe fleeing Yakt Spinner and the horseman that gives chase, smashed through building walls and pillars with their bodies.\nIt’s a contradiction in terms, with Yakt Spinner guerrilla tactics using the terrain to his advantage and the horseman chasing him in a straight line, but Yakt Spinner isn’t just running away.\nThe wire cutter’s unexpected attack on the pursuing Leon was intimidating and deadly, but it was only buying time.\nLeon calmly and skillfully deflects Yakt Spinner attacks while seemingly ignorant of its pursuit.\nYakt Spinner picks up the pace even more, thoroughly avoiding Leon’s approach but its joints are slowly wearing out.\nIts structural limitations designed to deal with armored vehicles and slow infantry are being tested by a superhuman.\n-Squeak!\nThe machine has been overworked beyond its carefully calculated capabilities and has collapsed from within.\nHow will the machine handle the absurdity of exhausting itself before the human did?\nAfter a few minutes of chasing, the reversal was a calculated move.\nWith a large building pillar in front of it, it hooked its flimsy legs over the pole and grimly changed course.\n“……Stallion!”\nYakt Spinner moved in an instant and slammed straight into the horseman.\nWeighing over forty tons, even if it was lightened, it was not the kind of impact an organism could withstand.\n“Not bad.”\nBut the Stallion held on, sliding smoothly as it was pushed back by the impact.\nIn the face of an impact too great for flesh and form to sustain, man and horse shake their heads lightly and gallop on again.\nNothing changed and Yakt Spinner took advantage of the distance and fired its remaining shells.\n“──!”\nStallion dodges the fire with an amazing move and even with all the precious machine gun shells being fired, Stallion’s sprint doesn’t stop.\n-Kugugung!\nThe hail of 60 mm shells chips away at the durability of the old building in real time as the walls, ceilings, and columns of the massive structure crumble like a sponge, spewing out huge chunks of stone.\nStallion leapt lightly toward the deadly boulders, and then began to climb, spurred on by the falling rocks.\nThe phantasmagoric beast, called a god, dodged the cascade of boulders and reached the ceiling in an instant.\n────!!\nAs gravity pulls him back down, the camera lenses of Yakt Spinner and the eyes of the rider intersect.\nFacing each other perpendicularly, they aimed their machine guns and lance at each other.\n-68 rounds. All rounds fired.\n“Glory be to the Lionheart…!”\nGravity-defying machine gun rounds rained down, and horsemen slammed vertically through the ceiling.\nThe ceiling, which had barely retained its shape despite the merciless misfires of the machine guns, completely collapsed under the impact of the white horse.\nIt was a charge like a white comet, a falling star pummeled by machine gun fire. But──\n“……?!”\nThe glowing Stallion is unscathed since no physical attack can penetrate the Light Divine Beast, who has unleashed his divine power and is in sync with his rider.\n-Boom!\nA devastating blow of dense holy power slams into Yakt Spinner.\n-Kwazizik!\nYakt Spinner is pierced and torn in half but Yakt Spinner robotic arms moved, even as it was thrown like a piece of trash from the massive impact.\nWith his opponent frozen in the aftermath of the impact and fall…it had 2.7 seconds to get his fuselage moving so it swung its four wire cutters.\nThe high-performance AI calculated the trajectory even as its body bounced around to kill the stationary enemy with certainty.\nThe trajectory determined that the sharp wire cutters swung from four directions would cut through the prey. This time, it was a must-kill.\n“Excellent…!”\n“……?!”\nYakt Spinner took a moment to review the camera malfunction as in a flash, the Stallion carrying Leon vanished into thin air, and he slammed into the ground.\nThe trajectory of the wire cutters had been calculated assuming a rider on horseback but when the target is less than half the size of the rider, the perfect calculation leads to a fatal miss!\nLeon fired at it like a shell, hitting it right in the middle of its perfect trajectory. With the destructive power he’s shown so far, it’ll only take a moment to cut through the main computer.\n[Yippee. What’s sealed in here should never leave.]\nThe AI finished its calculations in a split second.\nA workshop built on top of a sealed facility, the last way to protect this place. If there is even a 0.01% chance, the machine will not stop acting.\n-Initiate self-destruct sequence. Detonating all the explosives in the facility.\n-Boom, boom, boom!\nA large number of explosives planted in various parts of the repair shop explode in unison.",

      "content": "Chapter 23: Hunting the Spider (6)\n4.7% success rate, that was the probability of Yakt Spinner being able to defeat the Special Entity named Leon.\nThat’s the odds for a fighter that’s lost its legs and wire cutters. In fact, that’s including the fact that it would self-destruct due to a battery surge.\nHowever, there was a trick that boosted those odds to 93%.\nYakt Spinner had a large stockpile of explosives, about two tons that it had buried for use in the event of a final push, when it could no longer produce or maintain ammunition.\nThough it was beyond the scope of his calculations that the final self-destruct target would be a single threat, Yakt Spinner would not hesitate to risk everything to fulfill his last order.\n-Bang!!!\nA boom echoed throughout the city as two tons of explosives went off at once, instantly burning away all the oxygen in the building.\nThe sturdy buildings shatter, the pressure of the explosion violently pushing the air out of the way and sending out a powerful shockwave.\nAll buildings within a two-kilometer radius of the explosion’s center are gone, and all buildings within 10 kilometers are crushed or cracked.\nThe shockwave extends outward for 20 kilometers, blowing Hunters who are resting from injuries to the ground.\nSmoke from the explosion was sucked up as air once again filled the vacuum created by the crushing fire in the atmosphere.\nExplosive smoke billowed upward as a huge hemispherical cloud of dust spread in all directions like a mushroom.\nNo one would survive that blast.\nIt was an obvious guess.\n* * * *\nUnit JS-10,253 was manufactured 1,038 years and twenty-two days ago.\nUnlike its factory-built siblings, the intensely intelligent Yakt Spinner was built for the civilization’s final showdown.\nThe Yakt Spinners of the 112th Unmanned Armored Regiment, including their commander, 10,253, had only one order: never let the center of the city be unsealed.\nEnsure that what is sealed in the heart of the city is never unsealed and do so by any means necessary but they were never given the chance to fulfill the order.\nAs they were being produced and transported from the factory, the enemy attacked, destroying the train and more than half of them before they could be put into service.\nNo. 10,253 would have been destroyed without a last-minute emergency start by the transporter.\n“Protect the city! Go! Do your duty!”\nThe transporter was devoured the next moment.\nTaking over the command module, 10,253 accessed the integrated network system. With the 37th’s remaining forces, it cleared the raiders and headed for the city.\nThe sky was filled with gray dust, and the ground shook from time to time from the explosions, hindering their ability to maneuver.\nNear the top of the cliff, a comrade was buried with the collapsed earth.\nThe Red Menace attacked from all sides, at all times.\nSurrounded by an endless stream of enemies and mechanically slaughtering them, a mushroom cloud rose.\nHe entered an emergency evasive maneuver, but was unable to prevent half of his teammates from being caught in the shockwave.\n[JS-10,244 Unable to process. Contamination level 8, lethal to civilians.]\n[JS-10,185 Core damaged. Level 14 radioactive material overflow.]\nMost of them were contaminated and decontaminated late. They followed the logic and calculated the damage to the citizens if they entered the city and agreed.\n[Contaminated entity to cease activity immediately. Commence self-destruct sequence.]\n[Execute order from interim commander JS-10,253. Initiate self-destruct sequence after friendly units have departed.]\nThe late decontaminated units buried themselves in the ground and self-destructed.\nThe city they arrived in was under attack and 10,253 gave the order.\n[Initiate fire support to friendly forces. Defend the city.]\nTwelve machines entered the fray and were able to repel the enemy. They became the city’s heroes.\n“Yakt Spinner! Yakt Spinner!”\nThe people cheered the killing machines that had saved them.\nThe story of the drone that sniped and killed the enemy leader in a desperate situation, and was willing to throw itself to save a citizen from the aftermath of an explosion, was a fable that inspired hope in the city.\nThey became a symbol of hope and knights of steel that protected the people.\nThe regrouped Yakt Spinners, under the command of their commander, defended the city.\nThey defended and defended and defended, until there was nothing left to defend when the final battle was over.\nThe defense system was only 3% operational and less than five citizens remained but most of them mortally wounded.\nThe chance of survival was 0% and the last inhabitants of the city would die.\n“Yappy. This is it. Last order.”\nThe commander, roughly ignoring the blood throbbing in his bitten arm, gave his last order.\nHe explained why the city was being raided over and over again, what it was sealed and built upon.\nAnd that the seal must never be broken,\n“Guard the seal. Do not let anyone approach.”\n– May future survivors not be as foolish as we were.\nAs they fell, one by one, the end came.\nThe city in the middle of the wilderness had only one drone left.\nJS – 10,253 had done its duty faithfully.\nDo not allow the seal to be broken.\nProtect the seal. Protect the city.\nEliminate anything that approaches the city.\nTo conceal the sealed section, a maintenance shop was built on top of it, and explosives were placed to bury it in case of emergency.\nUsing the knowledge in the database, it repaired the city’s defenses, refurbished its body, and crafted supplies using auxiliary joints and facilities to replenish its railgun shells and ammunition.\nIt was lucky to have a mine near the city so it could make cheap black powder.\nPrepare, prepare, prepare, prepare, for an enemy that could come at any moment.\nThat’s how it survived for a millennium.\nIn the aftermath of the explosion, the dust clears and the intruder walks through the wreckage, unharmed.\nHoly Law <Protection of the Arrow Shield>\nThe absolute defense against ranged attacks neutralized even Yakt Spinner final self-destruct and it even protected the Yakt Spinner itself.\nHe swung his iron sword to break the seal on what was sealed ‘beneath the workshop’.\n“This is what you were meant to protect.”\nHe poured cement to bury it, built a workshop over it to conceal it, and finally detonated an explosive to bury it.\nToday, with no cipher left to unlock the protocols, the vault has been cut open with an iron sword.\nWhat was revealed was a black sphere that seemed to condense endless darkness.\nBlack smoke billows from it, contaminating life with its overflowing residue. This is not a nuclear reactor or radioactivity. This is the thing that threatens the city, the thing that has poisoned the human world.\nThe Wisdom Orb.\nThis is the gate’s closing condition and the reason for Yakt Spinner millennial mission.\n-Chirp! Chirp!\nYakt Spinner dragged its half-destroyed body, inching closer to Leon.\nForcing its severed joints to move, it wrapped its broken wire cutters around Leon’s ankle with its remaining secondary arm.\nThere was no power left to pull it. Even if it had any energy left to fight, it had a 0.00% chance of taking down a level 5 threat.\nKnowing this, the machine lurched forward, intent on taking Leon down.\n“Still trying to fight?”\nLeon turns to face Yakt Spinner, holding the black sphere.\nThe camera eyes, now down to one, stared at the sphere from start to finish.\nLeon closed his eyes as he watched the machine struggle to get the sphere out from underneath him and retrieve it.\n“How long have you guarded this, how many years have you fought?”\nAs if empathizing with the years, the knight watched the machine before him wordlessly.\nThe time it had spent repairing itself, tearing itself apart, repairing itself again, replacing itself… its indomitable will deservedly rewarded.\n“You have fulfilled your mission to the end.”\nHe sincerely lamented his inability to communicate with the machine before him. How could this honorable one not be called a knight?\n“A knight of loyalty and a knight of faithfulness, your service is beyond measure, and all living things are indebted to you.”\nLeon raised his holy sword as he knew that the sphere of evil could only be cut by it.\n-Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!\nThe neatly sliced evil screamed in agony and vanished as the Holy Grail, the purifier of evil, absorbed it and finished it off.\n……………\nYakt Spinner was silent.\nWhat must the machine be thinking, witnessing the destruction of what it had kept sealed for so long?\nWithout a word, Leon conjured holy water from the Holy Grail.\nPouring the holy water, Leon humbly steps forward and drops to one knee in full reverence.\n“Sir Yakt Spinner, I solemnly declare that your quest is complete.”\nThe seal was broken.\nNever let out one of the things that destroyed the world. It was what powered Yakt Spinner for a thousand years.\nNow it’s gone, and there’s no need to keep the seal.\nThe Last Order has been brought to an end after a thousand years.\n-Chirp! Chirp…!\nThe last remaining camera eye blinked. As if it knew it was finally over, freed from its fate.\n[Yappy, you are a hero to the city.]\n[Yappi! Thank you for protecting the city!]\n[Yappy!]\n“May you rest in peace…….”\nThe voices that remained in the old, worn memory module came to an end.\n* * * * *\n[Quest cleared]\nThe Hunters scratched their heads at the sudden message.\nCleared? What? Does that mean they’ve defeated Yakt Spinner?\nThe Hunters, still reeling from Yakt Spinner guerrilla warfare, couldn’t believe it: the vicious killing machine had fallen?\nBut at the same time, they remembered the anachronistic knight who had stared down at them with a misguided, arrogant gaze.\nWho else but him could have defeated the machine and completed the quest.\n“He was a good man until the end.”\nGolden Chul acknowledged him honestly. Although Yakt Spinner was an unfamiliar enemy, it was a formidable foe that even he, an S-class Hunter, couldn’t do much about.\nIf he could clear it alone against such a monster, the future of Korea would inevitably be centered around him.\n“Let’s prepare to withdraw, everyone!”\nHe was encouraging his tired men when a man appeared in the distance.\n“What is that?”\nThe man was carrying the wreckage of a massive piece of machinery… the remains of Yakt Spinner that must have weighed tens of tons.\n“Ohhh…! Your Majesty!”\nGil Tae-sung, who had meanwhile acquired the proper manner of addressing Leon from Ha-ri, turned to him exaggeratedly.\n“I was worried that the explosion might have damaged your jade body.”\n“You’re full of flattery, spellcaster. What’s the matter with you?”\n“Haha…….”\nTae-sung glanced at Leon, searching for something he should be holding. But he wasn’t holding any of those things so Tae-sung wondered.\n“I… Your Majesty, do you happen to know where the Jewel of Wisdom is…….?”\n“Destroyed.”\n“What?”\nAt those words, Gil Tae-Sung and the Hunters stopped dead in their tracks.\nDestroyed it? The thing that the Tower had spent tens of billions to get? Why?\n“That, do you know what kind of object it is? The Wisdom Jewel… it’s… it’s a high-grade treasure!”\n“What are you talking about, you lowly thing!”\nLeon shouted at Gil Tae-sung to shut him up, but Gil Tae-sung and many other Hunters didn’t understand his behavior.\nThe condition for clearing the gate was the destruction or capture of the Wisdom Jewel. According to Gil Tae-sung, if it was a high-ranked treasure, it was something that the nation would do everything in its power to obtain.\n“It is a vile thing that corrupts people. No good can come of it in human hands.”\n“And for that reason alone, you have given up on it?”\n“Only that reason?”\nLeon’s eyes narrowed, and Gil Tae-Sung felt a chill run down his spine, overwhelmed by the look alone.\n“Foolish things, don’t you realize that your paltry values will ultimately destroy the world?”\nWith that disdainful glance, Leon left and Ha-ri hurried after him.\n-Your Majesty, do you want me to lift it? Uhm… I don’t think I can lift it all, but…….\n-Don’t touch it. It is not for commoners to touch.\n-Eh…….\nThat was the end of the raid on the Cheongju Gate.",

      "content": "Chapter 24: Hunting the Spider (7)\nThe top floor of the United States Tower is the home of the Lord of the Tower…the archmage Reynald Shelman, who is considered an S-class mage.\nThe Archmage, as he is known to the world, is a force to be reckoned with, even by the President of the United States is huddled in his chambers, begging for forgiveness.\n“I apologize, Great One! I have not done what you commanded!”\nThe object of his prostrations was a gem that looked like a black mass.\nWisdom Orb, a unique grade of treasure obtained from the Red Gate of America. It looked at the mortal prostrate before it and spoke in a dreary voice.\n[Foolish, stupid thing I taught you the truth and wisdom of Samra, and you let me down.]\n“I apologize!”\nReynald begged for forgiveness, beating his head until it bled.\nIt was not the manner of one called the Archmage of the World, but addicted to the knowledge bestowed by the Wisdom Orb, Reynald worshiped it like a god.\n“Uh, it was unavoidable. A survivor named Leon was an unexpected variable, even for us!”\n[You defile my ears with your flimsy excuses, just a survivor named Leon…… what the fuck?]\n“What?”\nReynald looked up with a puzzled expression at the sudden soreness in Wisdom Orb’s voice.\n[Who did you just say?]\n“I said Leon…”\n[He must be the same person, right? Turn on the news… the news.]\nThe voice grew lighter and lighter. Was it an illusion that he was trembling as if he were frightened?\nWhen Reynald turned on the news and saw the news of the capture of the Cheongju Gate, there was a blond youth in the spotlight.\n[This is Leon Dragonia Lionheart]\n[Kheeheehee!]\n“Why is that bastard here? Why! Why?”\n“Lord?”\nThe great voice that had always dazzled the Archmage with its sternness and seriousness was nowhere to be heard, and sounded terrified.\n[I, I give up. I don’t. I won’t.]\nIn the next moment, the black aura in the orb scattered and it turned white as if something within it had completely disappeared.\n“Master? Master?!”\nReynald repeatedly called out to the unresponsive orb, but it never spoke again.\n* * * *\n“You have destroyed the Wisdom Orb?”\nOh Kang-hyuk, the president of the Hunter’s Association, looked unhappy when Leon told him that he had destroyed the Wisdom Orb.\n“Is that a complaint?”\n“……No, because the condition for closing the dungeon was to destroy or obtain the Wisdom Orb. If Your Majesty has defeated the Mechanical Spider, then the handling of the Orb is also within Your Majesty’s power.”\nStill, Leon recognized the hidden disappointment in the Association President’s expression. Yes, so be it, the ignorant are quick to see the gain in front of them.\n“Don’t be sorry, it’s poison.”\n“Poison… you mean?”\n“It is the stuff of the demons.”\n“The demons?!”\nAt the mention of the demons, Mr. Oh Kang-hyuk, the head of the Association, is stunned.\nDemons, the immortal beings that emerged from the Demon Gate had always been responsible for causing nightmarish damage to humanity.\n“The orb was created by the evil of wisdom and exploration to tempt humans. At first it grants the wielder what he desires, then it demands a price.”\nThe wizards of the Empire have fallen prey to this orb.\nIt didn’t take long for what was initially a curiosity to turn into an offer of eternal life, immortality, and demonization.\n“The Emperor of the Empire fell for it and sacrificed millions of his citizens to it. You say it has been found elsewhere? You’d better hurry and destroy it.”\n“I can’t believe…….”\nA drop item at the gate hiding such a destructive purpose… The President of the Association was skeptical of Leon’s words, but was convinced that something terrible would happen if they were true.\n“I will bring this to the attention of the U.S. government.”\n“That would be a good idea, but… they may have already fallen under the demon’s spell.”\nLeon did not overestimate the will of men in this age.\nWeak men easily defeated by greed and easily seduced. Their ignorance of the divine is nothing compared to the subjects of his world.\nThey are sick, poor, weak, and greedy. That is why they need true faith and enlightenment all the more. They must be taught that God’s love is a grace extended to all.\n“President, lead me to the place where he is laid to rest.”\n“Yes, sir, he is in the basement of the Association.”\nLeon followed the Association’s lead to one of the warehouses.\nIn the warehouse, where the byproducts of the Gate were usually stored, were the remains of the Mechanical Spider.\n“Your Majesty, President!”\nThe Association’s employees bow, starting with the waiting Ha-ri as they were instructed to be as polite as they could to Leon.\n“Do your work.”\nAccepting their salute, Leon stood before the remains of the Mechanical Spider.\nThe wreckage of the Mechanical Spider was, to put it mildly, a mangled mess.\nIts body, pierced, crushed, and shattered by Leon’s holy spear, had lost its power over the Hunters.\nNow it is a pale shadow of its former glory, less than half its former size. No, it is literally nothing but rubble.\n“What shall we… do with it?”\n“As an honorable knight, you should bury it in the ground and pray that it will find its way to the feast of the gods.”\nSuitable ground would be found in the Naju Plains, blessed by the goddess Demera.\n“Rest in peace, faithful knight.”\nThe moment he blessed the Mechanical Spider, the Mechanical Spider moved.\n“What?!”\nHa-ri’s voice rang out, drawing the attention of the president and his staff.\n“What?!”\n“The Mechanical Spider?”\n“Ooh, it’s moving!”\nThe nightmare of the Cheongju Gate, the boss monster, which had defeated the raiders three times, moved with a weak creak, and the staff was stunned.\nThe only one who remained silent was Leon.\n“Stop flailing!” Leon’s one word was a rallying cry and suddenly, they realized who was in front of them.\nYes, Leon, the man who defeated the Yakt Spinner, is in front of them. They swallowed hard and stared at the Yakt Spinner, relieved to see Leon’s presence.\n“Hmm….”\nLeon was equally puzzled by the situation.\n-Chew… chew!\nThe Yakt Spinner grunted, as if it couldn’t handle its weight, and then began to dismantle its body with its overgrown robotic arms.\nUndoing bolts, removing gloves, disassembling…reassembling itself.\nThroughout the process, Leon sensed a familiar aura emanating from the Yakt Spinner.\n“Holy…power.”\nThe holy water he’d used as a blessing on the Yakt Spinner had somehow worked on the Yakt Spinner.\nThe Yakt Spinner’s power source was shattered and unable to function properly, but with the blessing of the Holy Power, it performed a miracle.\nYakt Spinner finally disassembles and reassembles his body.\nShrunk to one-twentieth of its original size, the Yakt Spinner stared at Leon and Leon smiled, bowing his head in glee.\n“I see…I wonder if you’ll be able to win the Goddess’ favor.”\nLeon summoned the Holy Grail and generated holy water within it, which he poured into his holy sword.\nThe old, dirty sword gathered light as if it were its duty to make the lights of this world adorn it.\nLeon’s old iron sword dazzles with divine radiance.\n“Wow…….”\n“What the…….”\nEveryone marvels at the holy glow, a blessing in disguise.\nHe cuts through space with this holy sword of glory, bestowed upon him by the Goddess.\nThe Holy Grail, the holy water, and the energy of the holy sword all converge as the sword cuts through space, and a brilliant light dematerializes the space.\nThere…the pure white face of a man, or goddess, was revealed. Her snow-white hair dripping with cold energy, the goddess slowly opens her eyes to reveal precious gold.\n“Aaah…….”\nLeon didn’t need to say it; every human in the room knew that the woman of light was no human. She is something divine, something that no one in this world can match.\nEveryone fell to their knees before her as they had no choice but to kneel as Leon kneeled on one knee.\n“Arianna.”\n[Lionheart… my first knight.]\nLeon wanted to say more, but he realized the gravity of the situation and held up the Yakt Spinner as if to introduce it.\n“This Sir Yakt Spinner is an honorable knight, a model for all knights. He is a knight worthy of Arianna’s consideration.”\nThe goddess looked at the strange knight Leon had introduced and her golden eyes pierced the machine’s red ones.\n[This one has not fulfilled his quest. He has not proven his honor and given me glory.]\n“As the first knight of the Goddess, I vouch for him. If not for my presence, he would be a great knight, capable of rivaling the glory of the Lionhearted King.”\n[If my knight says so…there is nothing more to see.]\nThe goddess placed her absolute trust in Leon since as her knight, he gave her glory, honor, and finally victory on an impossible battlefield.\nThe gods of the pantheon hold him in high esteem, and how could they find fault with his words?\n[But let’s get one thing straight.]\nThe goddess looked down at Yakt Spinner and even this inorganic piece of machinery had to humble itself before the Goddess.\n“Will you, knight of otherworldly steel, enter into the ranks of my knight, the Lionhearted King, and praise light and sing of justice?”\n-Kiruk?\nThe Yakt Spinner glanced around, not quite understanding the goddess’s words. He spoke in his own words.\n“You are full of honor and knowledge, but your wisdom is still that of a child, so understand simply. Help my knight destroy evil, and you are my knight.”\nThe Yakt Spinner’s camera stares at Leon and he calmly synthesizes the situation, remembering Leon’s offer, the power he showed, and most of all, the theoretical impossibility of his reactivation.\nYakt Spinner quickly concluded.\n-Crack, crack, crack!\nHe muttered something in machine language, but soon realized that it would not be understood, and once again searched for a language that would be understood in this world.\nHacking into the radio tower of a nearby satellite station is a simple matter for him.\n-Check. The plan. Demonize. Attack. Good plan.\nThe answer was cut short, but neither Leon nor Arianna considered it rude, nor did they ask him to repeat it.\nThey were simply genuinely glad to have this honorable Holy Knight at their gates.\n“Good. As long as you remain loyal to my first knight and support him, you will share his glory.”\nThe new Holy Knight Yakt Spinner 10,253 is hereby sworn to light and justice.",

It’s… a bit complicated and will take some time.”\n“Alright, go do your business.”\nAfter dismissing Ha-ri, Leon walked down the empty hallway with Yakt Spinner and then──\n“Kuluk…!”\n-Kick!\nLeon choked back the blood that was spitting out of his mouth.\n[Are you okay, my knight?]\nThe feedback came immediately but Leon was relieved to see that the only people looking at him now were the Goddess and the Holy Knight.\n“It’s okay.”\nArianna gritted her teeth at Leon’s words.\n[After all, appointing a Holy Knight in a land that lacks faith is a bit much]\n“It had to be done, don’t you think?”\nIn the dying world, it was fine because the overwhelming power of the land protected Leon but now the faith had spread to only a tiny minority.\nHoly Knights are living saints, agents of the gods and it took a tremendous amount of power to elevate such beings. A drain that even Leon, with his lion’s heart, could not endure.\n-Leon?\nLeon smiled benevolently, reading the thoughts in the Yakt Spinner’s mind.\n“It is not your fault. It is my fault for not being strong enough.”\n[How is this your fault, your goddess is lacking]\n“Divinity is not to be blamed in any case. Please withhold your words.”\nAt those words, Arianna was silenced. Their Knight of Glory was faithful, even in times like these. So much so that it was hard to believe he was an atheist who didn’t believe in gods.\n[My knight, your goddess is always grateful for your devotion. However, the immorality of your goddess and the gods for not acting on your lack of faith has hurt you]\nThe goddess felt the need to hasten what was going on in the pantheon within his heart.\n[Rest well, trust in your gods and wait]\n“Arianna?”\nWith those words, Arianna returned to the Lionheart King’s Heart, where their pantheon had been evacuated, where she found the gods waiting for her.\n* * * *\nOn the day that Lionheart King Leon turned 121 years old when the world was destroyed by evil and only one knight remained, Leon kept all the fallen Holy Knights alive and evacuated the pantheon into his heart.\nTo their shame, the gods took refuge in the saint’s body, and for 180 years they watched the Lionhearted King destroy the Evil Ones but the gods did not stand idly by. They bestowed upon him all the strength and power they could give.\nThey made their one remaining saint bear all the burdens thus all the gods of the pantheon owed Leon a debt they could not repay.\n“What is his condition?”\nDemera, the god of life and fertility, inquired.\n“Not well, my knight has overdone it.”\nThe God of War and Flame was furious.\n“What has become of King Lionheart, who once bore the glory of the gods in all their splendor?”\n“Keep your head down, War. He fought for more than two hundred years for the gods, and he won.”\n“I know and that is why my teeth are chattering!”\nIt was not the Lionheart King who was to blame.\nHe was disgracing himself, for he loved the Lionhearted King, Leon Dragonia, more than anyone else.\nThe Goddess of Light and Justice looked around at her brothers and sisters, who must harbor similar feelings, and spoke.\n“The time has come to break our 180-year silence, my brothers and sisters. I can no longer watch my knight suffer.”\nHow could they support the Lionheart King and restore the glory of their Pantheon?\nHe shouldn’t be the only one to bear the burden. The gods themselves had to take an active role in the situation.\n“My brothers and sisters, we must support our only saint.”\n“No longer the only one.”\nIt was the God of Iron and Blacksmith who stepped forward. He was a muscular deity, conspicuously small and dwarfed by the others, but as strong as any of them.\nThe one the dwarves worshiped, their lord, Heto had just mentioned the newest saint.\n“That child, Yakt Spinner, has become a new saint.”\n“Hmph…A saint who doesn’t believe in divinity.”\n“Are you complaining War?”\n“Of course not! To become a saint, one must serve the divine and prove oneself worthy, and he’s not qualified for that!”\nThere were not a few deities who agreed with him, but there was only one reason for their silence.\n“The Lionheart King has vouched for him. What could be greater?”\n“Greater…!”\nAt that, War looked dumbfounded and there were murmurs of impatience around him.\n“Justice, in your opinion, is Yakt Spinner good enough to be a Holy Knight?”\nArianna spoke up.\n“As a pure being that has thwarted the plots of evil for millennia he may lack faith, but he is full of honor and loyalty, Iron.”\n“Hmm…! Leon and Justice place too much emphasis on chivalry. Honor is not enough to win a war.”\nWar rumbled on, and he still seemed dissatisfied.\nArianna turned to Iron, knowing he would eventually honor the new Saint.\n“Iron, there must be a reason you mentioned the Yakt Spinner. What are you thinking?”\nIron chuckled at Arianna’s question.\n“One hundred and eighty years ago, we lost all the Holy Knights except one, the Grail Guardian, who burned himself to the ground as a vessel for the descent of the divine until the very end.”\n“……I know this for a fact.”\n“I learned of this world through the life of the only one of us to gain a believer.”\n“Is that so?”\n“I have seen the world through the eyes of my faithful, and I have discovered an interesting child.”\nDemera, Goddess of Life and Fertility shared what she saw with the other gods.\n[Brothers, this time we’re in the hot Naju Plains!]\nIt was a broadcaster. Mr. Park, a farmer who also streams on the Internet.\nAfter experiencing the miracle of blessed rice, he traveled to the Naju Plain, which was said to be just as purified as the Hunan Plain.\n“What is that?”\nAs some of the gods scratched their heads in confusion, Iron explained.\n“On this world, the homeworld of the Lionhearted King, they’ve recently developed the medium of internet broadcasting, which is quite an effective way to spread news.”\n“You mean to preach to them?”\n“That’s right, show them miracles and demonstrate our divinity in action, but that’s not all, the entire world is tied together by a space called the Internet.”\nAt that, War questioned.\n“But why didn’t King Lionheart think of this? He was an inhabitant of this world.”\nIron shook his head and spoke the unfortunate truth.\n“It seems that when the Lionheart King died in this world, the Internet was still just beginning to develop dramatically.”\nIron then began to describe a concrete plan.\n“We will promote faith in all corners of society with blessings that can be used immediately, including Life (Demera), and the means of promotion will be the internet and news.”\n“But what about trial and error? Even Leon’s ambitious newspaper would have taken twenty years to get off the ground.”\n“That’s where our new Holy Knight comes in.”\n“”?????””\nThe gods stared in wonder.\n* * * *\n-Kiruk.\nThe resurrected Yakt Spinner calculatedly assessed his situation and what he needed to do next.\n[Lack of maintenance. Need a centralized information processing unit.]\nFirst of all, his computing power is significantly lower now that he has no backup from the city, and his main program is not running with any certainty but even he, a machine, has his doubts as to why he is able to move when he should be perfectly still.\nWhy is his computing power, which should be zero, at the level of a sub computer?\nThe A.I. has analyzed thousands and tens of thousands of cases, but it realizes that this is not a logical explanation. Above all──\n[I am Heto, God of Iron and Blacksmithing, and from now on you are my spokesperson and I am your guardian]\nA being spoke to him without any communication devices, and in “any language” he could understand since the beings called Hunters had invaded the city.\nPhenomena that don’t exist in the program, that are physically impossible, are entered into the data and Yakt Spinner could only come up with words to organize them.\n[Divine system at work. Anomaly A into the divine system. Set aside.]\nThe second problem arises when the machine is faced with a phenomenon it can only conclude, “I’ll just have to let this one slide.”\n[Output 13%. Needs immediate repair.]\nSince the body has been reduced to a hundredth of its size, the power output has dropped significantly.\nEven at this size, the original 13% power output is ridiculous for the machine.\nThe destroyed body could not be repaired and he hacked into the domestic computer system to find a replacement, but most of the substances on the planet could not replace the original armor, and even if they could, the quantity was insufficient.\nIt was then that Iron spoke.\n[See this, feel this, this is the ‘metal of the gods’ from which your body can be made]\n-Bam!\nIt was invisible but palpable and he could calculate even though he had no data.\nThe anomaly he felt when I fought Leon, divine power. With this, he could manufacture his own body.\n[What do you want me to do?]\nWith Iron laugh, a ‘revelation’ descended and the strong artificial intelligence quickly began to learn the necessary knowledge.\n* * * * *\n“Huh, Chief. Look at this!”\n“What is it?”\n“It’s a video, is this authorized?!”\nHunter Association Chief Kim Jin-soo’s eyes widened when he saw the video shown by his subordinate.\n“Naju Plain? YouTubers?”\nThe video began by showing the vast rice fields of the Naju Plain.\n[I’ll show you the benefits of our Manshinjeon Rice, a special crop that only grows in our Naju Plain.]\nThe narration begins with a voice that sounds too perfect to be a machine, a soothing voice that you can’t help but like.\n[You ask, “What makes Manshinjeon rice so special?” This video will answer that question].\nFlawless, ultra-high-definition video in 16K, with music that was never heard before.\n[Manshinjeon farmers’ mornings start at 5 a.m. every day].\nThe flowing video is the work of a pro.\n[The Manshinjeon farmers begin with a reverent prayer session with the temporary priest, Mr. Choi, and the farmers. Look at that. He’s still praying to Demera, the goddess of life and fertility]\nThe camera approaches the farmers as they pray toward the altar. Their faces are peaceful and unblemished, more like practicing monks than farmers.\n[What makes the crops of the Pantheon of the Ten Thousand Gods so special?]\n-The crops blessed by Demera make you healthy and cure diseases just by eating them. My wife had dementia, but now she’s fine!\n– I was cured of a long-standing heart condition and can now run 100 meters in 6 seconds!\nIt’s all nonsense, but as the screen transitions the video shows a sick dog running around after eating rice, a dying cancer patient is cured, etc.\n[All of this is possible for one reason: the Pantheon of Ten Thousand Gods served by His Majesty Leon Dragonia, Lionheart King of the Pantheon Guild].\n-Demera!\n-Hail, Lionheart!\n-Long live the other gods of the pantheon!\n“”…….””\nEventually, the video was viewed by the Association staff in the Hunter Division but they didn’t speak until a few seconds after the video ended.\n“……Who made this?”\n“…Isn’t it His Majesty Leon?”\n“You think he’s a youtuber?”\n“……Did one of the deputies make this?”\nIt was weird. Why would he make a video like this in the first place, let alone an overly high quality video?\nIsn’t it a bad commercial? The comments were similar.\n-What is this, a commercial?\n-What a waste of talent.\n-Isn’t he the survivor that’s hot these days? He captured Cheongju Gate.\n-You’re a joke. Even though I’m a foreigner ignorant of the Internet, can I steal this?\n-What’s more, it’s been translated into 104 languages. Did some crazy Payne make it?\nIt was a blatant , and the gods are being invoked.\nEven the cheesy commercials they pay for on current affairs programs these days aren’t this blatant and illogical.\nEating rice cures cancer? A goddess blessed the land?\nThese are the kind of things that would be ridiculed as nonsense.\nThe problem is that everything was absolutely true.\nEating rice really does cure cancer, and there were Association employees who saw the goddess… and at the center of it all is the Lionheart King from the Otherworld.\nIn other words, this is Leon’s video.\n“Leon, I need to see him right now.”\nWhat was he thinking? As Kim Jin-soo prepared to go out, he called Han Ha-ri.\n“What are you thinking?”\n………\n……\n…\nIn Leon’s penthouse, Yakt Spinner pulled his USB-C converted prosthetic arm away from the laptop.\n“Lord Yappy, are you done with my laptop?”\nYakt Spinner nodded as he returned Han Ha-ri’s laptop.\n[Operation Marketing Phase One successful.

      "content": "Chapter 26: Marketing (2)\nThe Manshinjeon YouTuber channel has garnered quite a bit of attention on the internet.\nIt had ultra-high definition and impeccable professional workmanship but the only problem is that it contained the name of Leon, the survivor of the Cheongju Gate raid.\n-There’s a lot of bullshit in this video.\n-Eating rice will cure cancer? It doesn’t make any sense.\nOf course, a mix of commercials and interviews didn’t make people believe in God.\nAnd there was still no official certification from the Association so naturally people had to pass it off as funny.\n“Your Majesty, we have to take the video down!”\nChief Kim Jin-soo saw the video and immediately came looking for Leon, who had confirmed with Ha-ri that he wasn’t in the penthouse, so he came all the way to the Naju Plains where the simple guild building had been erected.\n“Chief, please have some barley tea.”\n“Uh, thank you.”\nHe sipped the barley tea that Ha-ri offered and calmed his nerves.\n“No, who posted that video in the first place?”\n“Lord Spinner.”\n“Lord Spinner?”\nKim Jin-soo’s gaze flicked to Yakt Spinner…Yappy…who was using a laptop in the corner.\nThat killing machine made that video? How the hell?\nLeon’s thoughts were the same.\n‘I can’t believe the gods would give Lord Spinner such instructions.’\nHe was told it was a quick way to gather faith but this was something Leon didn’t have the knowledge to discuss since when he was on Earth, as a child, he had only played the War of the Stars, which was all the rage.\nThe current culture of YouTube and internet broadcasts is unknown to him, as he only remembers the heavy screen of a CRT monitor.\nHe knew that Yakt Spinner’s powerful artificial intelligence would take care of everything, but he didn’t expect it to be this good.\n“What does it mean to take the video down?”\nOf course, people aren’t going to believe the video right away since faith is not something that can be spread by a few commercials. But was it really necessary to take the video down?\n“As your Majesty knows, the rice that grows in the Naju Plain is far different from the crops of our world.”\nSuch a miracle crop should have been classified as elixir, not just food.\n“Actually, Korea Food and Drug Administration…an organization that verifies the safety of food or drugs, and they do a lot of experiments.”\n“It pains me to doubt the blessings of the Goddess, but I suppose you have your own laws and systems.”\n“Thank you for your understanding. The blessed rice is of such a quality that there is no problem with its immediate distribution. In fact, I would like you to distribute it.”\nChief Kim distributed rice to the KFDA and other departments, and the results were amazing.\n-It’s a revolution in the medical world! With this rice, most doctors won’t even be needed!\n-How is it possible to cure an incurable disease that hasn’t even been identified?\n-From the moment you eat the rice, something is working in your body to remove tumors… How is this…How is this possible?\nFrom lab rats to people with incurable diseases whose days were already numbered, the Blessed Rice was a crop that would change the medical world forever.\nThousands of tons of this elixir were being produced every year, and humanity was on the verge of overcoming diseases.\nEven if the only people who could grow it were the Demera faithful who believed in the goddess of life and fertility it would be enough for the religion to expand.\nThere was another problem.\n“This rice…the moment it is announced, it will be sought after by the entire world.”\nYes, this was the problem. There would be many people like Park Jong-chan who would want to secure their own seeds.\nThey might not be able to monopolize it, but they could grow it themselves.\nWith the recent advances in palm farming, the crops can be grown quickly, so it won’t take long for it to be mass-produced.\nBut what if they realize that only Demera believers can grow the blessed rice?\n“The Naju Plains will be overrun by thieves, and they won’t be ordinary humans.”\nIt’s even more potent than an enhancement potion so all the guilds and even the people from the underworld would want it.\n“We’ll cooperate fully once the Food and Drug Administration approves it and we start sowing the rice in earnest. Until then, please be patient.”\n“Indeed, I understand.”\nAt Leon’s nod, Director Kim Jin-soo cheered inwardly: I can finally convince this guy!\n“However, there’s a problem.”\n“What?”\n“You’ve been worrying uselessly, Kim. No one will be able to steal the product of a goddess.”\nLeon was smug.\n* * * *\nThe rise of the superhumans after the Cataclysm was the hope of humanity, but not all of them became icons of hope.\nAwakenings occurred among young and old alike, and of course there were many who chose a life of crime.\nThe Fiend Association, this global shadowy conglomerate has become a thoroughly organized crime syndicate, operating on the deep web.\nThey are involved in all sorts of crimes and are willing to commit murder if the money is right.\nAnd now a request has come in for the Vipers, the third-tier hit squad of the Korean branch of the Fiend Association.\n[We want you to secure the rice seeds in the Naju Plain and burn down the granaries]\nThe payment was in bitcoin, half down payment and half after the mission was successful.\nYue Ying immediately researched the Naju Plain.\n-This… it’s real.\n-The Hunter’s Association has stopped the rumors from spreading, but there are cases of people taking it everywhere.\n-You mean it wasn’t just a stupid commercial?\nAnyway, now that they’ve been commissioned and paid, it was time for action.\nThe Vipers headed straight for the Naju Plains with over 50 minions. They’re only C or D hunters, but they’re way overpowered for something as simple as stealing rice.\nIf it weren’t for the client’s insistence that they take as many members as possible, they could have gotten by with regular men.\n“What the hell. I thought you were going to bring as much manpower as possible because there were a bunch of guards.”\n“Are we really just supposed to secure the seeds and burn the granaries?”\nEntering the fields with the oil barrels, the Vipers slowly made their way through the fields before stopping.\n“Brother, it’s a person…!”\nThe youngest member spotted something in the darkness and gasped.\nAt his words, the members drew their weapons, but their faces fell because it wasn’t a person, but a puppet.\n“It’s a scarecrow, stupid.”\n“Oops…sorry.”\nThey were barely human shapes, stuffed with wadding and woven with straw, hanging from the pole, dressed in clothes and a hat that didn’t fit but in the darkness, they took on a human form.\n“This is weird… I thought it just moved.”\nThe youngest examines the scarecrow.\nUnder Leon’s stern orders, the scarecrows have been painted with dye on their faces to give them eyes and mouths.\nIn this darkness, the spooky is almost creepy.\n“Oh, asshole. Put it away.”\n“Brother…look at those.”\n“…….”\nThe leader of the Vipers was horrified as the scarecrows were everywhere.\nPieces of cotton, straw, stone, wood…like very old totems moved around the field like puppets.\n-Tap, tap, tap.\n-Oh, oh, oh, oh.\nIs the dull sounds of things moving and rumbling an illusion?\nThe sound was so subtle that they mistook it for an illusion, so they didn’t pay attention to it but it seemed like a mistake to enter the field.\n-Tap, tap.\n-Oh, oh, oh.\nSuddenly, there was a loud clang, and one of the tense members drew his sword.\n“You idiot…! Why are you afraid of a scarecrow?”\n“I’m sorry but something’s…off here.”\n“You idiot…don’t go around saying you’re a member of the Vipers.”\nThe leader reprimanded his subordinate and ordered the others to pour oil.\n“Calculate the wind direction and burn it as wide as possible.”\n“But where will we get the seed?”\n“Idiot, we’ve checked the granaries, we can rob them.”\n“Aha~”\nThe men were convinced and poured out the oil from the barrel.\n“If this is so good, let’s get some from the warehouse. Mansu and Jintai, you two… Huh? Where did you two go?”\n“What? They were following me earlier… Uh, where did Doosan Yi go again?”\nThis can’t be happening. How can a person disappear in an instant in this open field?\n-Tap! Tap!\n-Ooooooooo………\nThe disturbing sound from earlier gradually became clearer and as the pressure seemed to be coming from all directions the Viper Lord looked around…….\n“Hey…Was that puppet always this close?”\nA scarecrow with a smiling face painted with crimson dye stood in front of them.\n“What? Uh…I don’t know?”\n“No, it’s weird, it was so far away just a moment ago, and what’s with this clanking sound, and the rumbling-”\nAs he turned his head to address his subordinates, he caught a movement in the corner of his vision.\n“Ugh…!”\nHe was so startled that he didn’t even take the time to assess the situation before blindly swinging his sword.\n“Big brother?”\n“Huh… Huh…! Fuck, fuck, fuck!”\nIt wasn’t until he smashed one of the scarecrows that he understood that they were moving.\n“Check your surroundings, you idiots! These things are moving!”\n“Huh?”\nThe unity was the result of the vipers’ survival instincts kicking in. They turned to face each other, their backs to each other, and witnessed the unthinkable.\nThe deformities become creatures and the scarecrows transform into monsters.\nWhy hadn’t they seen it before? Why did they see it now?\nThere were scarecrows, stone figurines, and even roots strewn across the wheat fields like totems, all sorts of unidentifiable creatures moving about in the night.\nThe scarecrows, made by the shoddy workmanship of the people, were a twisted fantasy, recreating the invasion of the Old Ones.\n“Holy shit, they’re monsters, they’re monsters!”\nThis wasn’t even the area where the dungeon break occurred, so what kind of monsters were they? It was a nonsensical statement, but what was happening now actually defied common sense!\nIn a panic, the Vipers tore and crushed the dolls but the puppets were able to weave their shattered bodies back together, regenerating like living things, or rather, like something beyond living things.\n-Tap! Tap!\n-Oooooooooo…………\nUnbelievers were not tolerated in the goddess’s wheat field, where her holy power resides.\n[Code of Life and Abundance]\nMake an image of the goddess from the first of the harvest and offer it to the altar. Do not urinate on the fields. Manure is fine. Build a scarecrow and make sure it has a hat and clothes. When you harvest, sing a song. It’s better if it’s a song of thanks to the goddess. Don’t go hungry, even if you’re in a hurry. …………\n…………\nThe most important rule number 0 was.\n0. Those who break the rules will die.\n* * * *\nThe Viper Lord Heo Sang-man fled, leaving more than half his men in the field.\n“Big brother, what the hell is that? I didn’t even see them at the gate!”\n“I don’t know, asshole!”\nThe request was strange to begin with since they were paying that much for stealing rice seeds and setting a fire. But even so, it was hard to predict this situation.\nThe Vipers were mostly D-class, but they were still Fiends, and how could they not steal a single rice seed?\nThey recognized that this mission was wrong from the start, and they had every intention of screwing over their client.\nThey may have come anonymously, but they could use the help of the Fiend Association’s intelligence arm, the Dark Moon, and they’ve been generous with their payments, so they won’t be ignored.\n“Uh, big brother, wait!”\n“What?!”\nHeo Sang-man, irritated by his subordinate’s insistence, spotted the building in front of them.\n“This is the granary that is the target.”\nA place where residents stack their harvested rice.\nSeeing this, he had a realization which naturally led to greed.\n“If this rice is real… it’s worth a lot of money.”\nHe’d lost half his men, and he couldn’t afford to come back here empty-handed.\n“Those monsters are only in the fields…there’s nothing in the granaries.”\nCommon sense tells him that with monsters like that in the fields, there can’t be any in the granary, but his confidence is boosted when a subordinate who actually has good eyesight tells him there’s nothing around.\n“Transfer as much rice as possible to the vehicles. Let’s go…!”\nThere would be piles of threshed rice, and it would be easier to steal it than to harvest it but the moment he stepped into the warehouse.\n-Bam!\n“Huh?”\nSomething ominous…a sound that was often heard in war movies.\n“Mines──?!”\n-Quang!\nHeo Sang-man’s body flew into the air.\n“Big brother!”\n“What, what, landmines, why are there landmines here?!”\nHe was gasping for breath and shivering as a mine exploded under his feet.\nEven though the landmine was meant to blow his legs off rather than kill him, it only tore his left foot off because he was a superhuman.\n“Brother, I’m trying to save you…!”\n“Stop, you idiots! You don’t know how many mines there are!”\nAt that, the minions came to their senses.\n“Ughhhhhh…save me…….”\nSeeing only an illusion of a breathless figure, the subordinates were unable to step forward easily.\nEven if they were fiends in the first place, they were third-rate scoundrels who accidentally awakened and fell into a life of crime. Compared to the ‘evil’ fiends, they were just a gang of thugs with a little power.\nIf they were willing to throw themselves into a minefield to help the boss, why would they join the Fiend Association?\n“Run…….”\nA member of the group winced at the tingling sensation at the back of his neck as on his back, the blood-red ‘wire’ glowed in the moonlight.\n“A wire?”\nThe members of the Vipers looked around in alarm and they saw a giant spider’s web of steel wire, and a “steel spider” slithering down from it.\nDespite its diminished size, there’s no fool who can’t recognize the infamous killing machine from Cheongju.\n“Ahhh…….”\nThey realized it was a trap as the Holy Knight himself descended to capture his prey.",

      "content": "Chapter 27: Marketing (3)\nIn the midst of the night’s tumult, Leon did not wake, but slept.\nHow could a man of royalty be concerned with such trivial matters?\n“Your Majesty, there are thieves outside!”\nKing Lionheart chastised the commoner who rushed into his room.\n“Uh-oh, Your Majesty, we’re in big trouble…….”\n“How dare you invade this king’s bedchamber?”\n“What? Did you know about that?”\nLeon had noticed the raiders invading the fields long before.\n“There are thieves, and we must deal with them!”\n“It’s the guard’s job to deal with bandits.”\nLeon’s dismissal made Ha-ri’s heart race. From what she could see on the camera, it was obvious that they were from the Fiend Association.\n“Fifty awakened will wreak havoc in your majesty’s fields, and there is not a single guard on the fields in the first place!”\n“How do you know there aren’t?”\n“What?”\nHa-ri would soon find out that the land is blessed by Demera, and there are more than a few scarecrows on it.\n-Bang! BANG!\nA loud explosion along with screams was heard in the night. The Holy Knight’s eyes glow red in the midst of the pandemonium, giving the illusion of being in the middle of a battlefield.\n“Wow…….”\nHa-ri was dumbfounded as he watched the fiends being subdued in real time.\nThe next morning Leon looked at the fifty captured fiends in front of the village hall.\nFifty people were bound and immobilized by wires with holy power and strange aura of the scarecrows so the police and the Association staff were there to dispose of them.\n“Slit their wrists.”\n“Huh?”\nLeon said as he looked at the men.\n“What a bunch of lowly creatures, trying to steal a little grain but thieves show their true colors by having their wrists slit so slit their wrists one by one.”\n“Uh, wait a minute, Your Majesty, this is the modern age.”\nShe was stunned by Leon’s order to slit the wrists of the captured minions.\n“When it comes to criminals… domestic laws must be followed… ah…….”\n“Tsk. What a lenient law for criminals.”\n“They must be tried.”\nHa-ri wondered how to explain the modern legal system to this medieval-minded king but then the unexpected arrived.\n“Is this where you got the tip?”\n“Yes. They said the fiends were caught stealing.”\nIt was reporters getting out of their cars, and not just reporters, but also professional YouTubers, rushing over to see where they had heard the news.\n“Who are you guys?”\nHa-ri waved them off, but they immediately recognized her and wanted to interview her.\n“Hunter Han Ha-ri, is it true that you were robbed during the night?”\n“I heard it was the Vipers, a notorious fiend gang!”\n“A whopping 50 fiends attacked, how did you manage to defend yourself?”\n“Uh, how did you know all that?!”\nHa-ri was embarrassed; she didn’t know, and neither did the reporters.\nHow would they know about the existence of an anonymous informant who could never be “traced” with modern technology?\n“Why on earth did the fiends attack?”\n“Uh, that’s… I think it’s because of the ‘rice’ harvested by the Ten Thousand Gods Guild.”\n-Rice from the Ten Thousand Gods Guild? What is that?\n-Why, you know that video that’s been trending lately, the elixir rice.\n-Was that real?\n-Isn’t it because it’s real that the fiends are flocking to it?\nOne headline after another began to form in the journalists’ minds. What if the cancer-curing rice was real?\n“Is it true that rice grown by the Ten Thousand Gods Guild can cure cancer?”\n“What’s the deal with the Ten Thousand Gods? Is everything King Leon says true?”\n“Well, if you call his name in front of his Majesty, you’ll get a slap on the wrist… Please be careful what you say.”\nAnyway, the reporters wanted to know why the fiends were trying to burn the rice fields in the Naju Plain.\nThey asked why they were doing this, and naturally, their interviews made the evening’s news.\nOne reporter asked a sharp question.\n“More than that, Hunter Han Ha-ri, is it true that you planted mines near the granary?”\n“Uh, mines? Um… that!”\nThe reporter, who had interviewed the residents of the village beforehand, pressed on.\n“Even if you’re a Hunter’s Guild, aren’t weapons of mass destruction like mines a violation of the Firearms Act? It’s a grave offense! Where the hell did you get them from?”\n“Uh, well, it’s just…! It’s handmade by a guild member, so it’s just…”\nIt was then that a mouse had stepped on a landmine while scurrying around the granary and exploded into a million pieces.\n“Rats, it’s a mousetrap, see? There are so many rats in the countryside. Ahaha…….”\n“”………….””\nNo one believed her a bit.\n* * * *\n“This is what the gods had planned.”\nLeon stepped in front of Yappy and watched the whole thing unfold.\n-Leon.\nHeto, the god of iron and blacksmithing, laid out the prerequisites for gaining faith.\nPhase one was to make as many people as possible ‘hear’ the name of the pantheon.\nThe most basic condition for fame is that many people see, hear, and become familiar with it.\nNo matter how ridiculous it may seem to the common sense of the modern world, they spread the word through marketing.\n-Phase Two. Getting attention.\nThe more threatening and controversial the bandits who come after the rice the better it was for them.\n-Reliance. Self-inflicted.\nIt was Yappy who hired the bandits, which means the raid was self-inflicted.\n“Where did he get the money to hire those thugs?”\nYappy holographically displayed the bitcoin wallet he’d hacked into hundreds of coin exchanges and stolen inconspicuously.\n-Humans. Financial systems. Strange. Extremely inefficient. Lack of security. Infinitely replicable.\n“I’ve heard of bitcoin from Ha-ri. Modern Earth has become a strange world.”\nThe Miners’ Association, which is based on the deep web, a networked system, was not beyond Yappy’s reach.\nHigh-level members with access to the depths of the Miners’ Association were strictly analog and referral-based, so the only people he was able to hire were grunts.\n-Unlimited copies of cryptocurrency. Access to guild funds.\nAs long as he had Yappy, Leon didn’t have to worry about funding since any modern cryptocurrency or financial system could be hacked by Yappy if he wanted to.\n“No, such goods are not legitimate goods. It’s not a good idea to fund the guild with them.”\n-I don’t understand.\nLeon smiled gently at Yappy, who didn’t understand the knight’s way of thinking.\n“It’s okay if you don’t understand now. But honor requires that you always be true to yourself. Lord Spinner, this king hopes you have a strong sense of justice.”\n-Cryptocurrency cloning plan temporarily suspended.\nYappy had fulfilled Leon’s wish without understanding, and he resumed his explanation.\n-Minor crimes. Issue mall.\nThe fiends raided the field and wanted to steal seeds and burn down the fields.\nThe reporters were called, and they made a big deal out of the fact that this was something the Fiend Association was involved in.\n“You said you had a final plan. What is it?”\n-Final Phase of Plan ‘Marketing’.\n────\nUpon hearing the plan, Leon smirked.\n“Apparently, the gods have adapted to modern times better than I, a native Earthling.”\nFinal Phase: Implement the K- principle.\n* * * *\nYakt Spinner is an AI that can’t even be compared to the supercomputers of modern humans.\nThe networking systems of modern humans are mere toys to him, and hacking a simple content hosting website is an easy task.\nYappy hacked into YouTube and began posting dozens of videos of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild and its related organizations.\n[Shock! Hundreds of minions kneeling before the majesty of K-Rice. Why did they target K-Rice?!]\n[K-Rice is a panacea for all diseases? Why does the world have its eyes on K-Rice!]\n[Japan on its knees begging, please sell us some rice. Prime Minister and Emperor begging for forgiveness!]\n[The Ten Thousand Gods Guild. I love Korea so much. Korea is a great country. His Majesty the King loves Korea!]\nYappy is a strong artificial intelligence and can learn anything through algorithms, then thoroughly applies the results that appear as ‘numbers’.\nYappy’s videos got hundreds of thousands of views and thousands of comments.\nThe thumbnails that catch the eye and content that seems plausible created a wave and they just rode it.\n-Yaah~ Is this a true story? I want a bowl of Korean noodle soup!\n-This is the power of Korean rice!\n-Lol!\nThe human world is so strange.\nYappy was puzzled by this reaction, but he proceeded to delete, report, and even delete accounts with the administrator privileges he gained by hacking into the YouTube headquarters.\nAt the same time, he didn’t forget to increase the number of views and comments on the 130,000 accounts he created.\nFrom this moment on there will be no end to the exposure of videos related to the Ten Thousand Gods Guild unless humanity abandons the network system.\n* * * *\nAhn Dong-gil, the 23rd president of South Korea, was recently going through a political crisis.\n“Suspicion of political collusion with the Daelong Group!”\n“The dark side of the incumbent president!”\n“The silence of the president of Korea.”\n“What will happen to the country?”\nPresident Ahn Dong-gil frowned at the headlines in the newspaper. In front of him, Kim Dae-young, chairman of Daelong Group, one of Korea’s leading conglomerates, smirked.\n“Why do you only look at the bad stories when there’s so much good food, Mr. President?”\nThey were in a high-end restaurant in Cheongdam-dong where no one knows what goes on in the secretive, VIP-only chambers there but the people involved.\nIt was here that President Ahn Dong -gil met with Chairman Kim Dae-young and promised to veto any regulatory bills unfavorable to Daelong Group.\n“This is the problem with these bastards,” he said, “they have no fear of the president of Korea.”\n“That’s right. In our younger days, we could never have imagined that.”\nKim Dae-young raised his glass to the president. Although he may only have two years left in office, his political influence doesn’t fade with his departure from power.\nIn his youth, he was a democracy fighter, and his grandfather and great-grandfather were independence fighters.\nAlthough the scandal may have weighed on him a bit, Kim Dae-young didn’t think it would last long and the corners of his mouth twisted wickedly.\n“How far will the barking of pigs go?”\nThis was the kind of rant that, if it had been published in the media, would have sparked a boycott and a movement to remove him from office but Kim Dae-young was unflappable.\n“They can bark in moderation, but it will soon die down. Isn’t that the nature of the pot calling the kettle black, that it boils over when it’s boiling, but quickly subsides when it’s off the heat?”\n“You’re a bit harsh to call the country’s people dogs and pigs, don’t you think?”\n“Hehe, I apologize for that.”\n“Of course. Isn’t this president a servant of the people? Although I’m a servant who holds the leash and shakes the pigs.”\n-Hahahahaha!\nYeah, the people are ignorant and stupid.\nHow can they be so upset that they lost so much just because he passed a bill?\nThe stupid ones fall for the opposition’s propaganda and play the role of justice warriors.\n“Mr. President, this is my small token of respect.”\nKim Dae-young held out a small box and it was no secret that it contained hundreds of millions of dollars worth of gifts.\n“Hehe, what a surprise.”\nPresident Ahn tapped Kim on the shoulder as he took the gift box.\n“By the way, Mr. President, have you heard anything interesting in the news this time?”\n“News? Oh, him?”\nAt Kim’s mention, Ahn immediately thought of a hot topic.\nIn fact, it was partly because of the survivor of the Cheongju Gate that his negative news was not so hot.\n“Leon, the one who said he was a king and an agent of the gods? Heh.”\n“We talked on the phone once and he said something about how he needed me to recognize him for something.”\nThough he had only heard the voice for a moment, Leon had made quite an impression on President Ahn.\nFrom what he heard, Leon was a hierarchical brute, but in his experience, he was far from it.\n“I hear he’s been pissing off Mr. Park of the Doojeong Foods Group. It’s all over the place in business circles.”\n“Doojeong Group? Why him?”\nDoojeong Foods was a major Korean conglomerate that even the president couldn’t mess with.\n“That barbarian friend is making life difficult on Earth.”\nSurvivors break the rules of Earth’s civilization based on their experiences in their worlds.\nThe impersonal behavior of survivors is not a rare sight, as some of them end up becoming fiends because they can’t adapt to life on Earth.\n“I’m going to meet him this time anyway, shake his hand, take a few pictures and have a little dinner; that’ll make for a good story.”\nLeon had become quite the topic of conversation compared to the average survivor.\nFirst, he had cleansed the miasma in the Hunan and Naju plains and cleared the gate that had been the headache of Cheongju.\nA survivor who had been on Earth for less than a month had become an instant star and High-profile hunters were often used as political poster children.\n“Mr. President, if you ever get a chance to meet him… could you do something about that ‘blessed rice’?”\n“Blessed rice? I heard it’s all the rage on the internet these days… but is it really that good?”\n“It’s not just good, my niece was in the middle of breast cancer, and somehow she got hold of that rice and ate it.”\n“Hehe… breast cancer… that must have been very distressing.”\n“I wasn’t too worried because she’s a domesticated bitch, but anyway, did you know that her condition improved greatly after eating that rice?”\n“Is it true that it cures cancer?”\nHe had received a report from Oh Kang-hyuk, the president of the Association, but I was skeptical because it was still in the experimental stage…….\n“That barbarian has very strange powers.”\nThe president waited for Leon’s visit, looking forward to their meeting.\nIf he could get the savage to cooperate, he could cover up the scandal, and it would be a great help to his cause.",

Leon Dragonia Lionheart.”\nOutside the presidential office President Ahn shook Leon’s hand and realized that he was more impressive than he thought.\n‘He’s handsome.’\nOn the surface, he looks like a handsome young man in his 20s. Had he just become king?\n“Let’s take a picture, here~”\nThe president smiled and waved at the reporters’ flashes. The next day, the headlines in the newspapers were glowing.\n‘Hoo-hoo, this will be a good picture.’\n[President Ahn took a picture with Leon, a high-profile survivor. He is strengthening bonds with survivors.]\nWell, it would be appropriate to run a headline like this.\nThirty years after the Cataclysm, the public’s main concern is the progress of Gate Raids and the Hunters.\nThe Gate caused a catastrophe so horrific that it almost wiped out human history, but it also spawned a superstar in the form of the Hunter.\nIt’s the Hunters who have taken over the image of the monster-slaying, humanity-saving hero, so it’s not a bad idea to keep them around as politicians.\n“Leon…may I address you as Your Majesty?”\n“You may, president Ahn.”\nPresident Ahn and his staff even held a meeting to discuss how to treat Leon.\nHe claimed to be the king of the kingdom beyond the gate and even said he was an agent of the gods.\nShould they take him at his word, or treat him like an ordinary survivor or citizen?\nIn the end, however, they decided to treat Leon as if he were the queen of England.\nA superhuman with the strength of an S-class hunter could have a title.\n“If you’d like to eat first, I’ve prepared a feast for His Majesty Leon.”\nOkay, the mood is not bad. If I can keep things cordial through the meal, my political objective will be accomplished.\nWith that, they headed to the banquet hall, with reporters following but Leon stopped.\n“That’s rude.”\n“Um?”\nThe president, his secretary, and the reporters stop in their tracks. When they all gave him a puzzled look, he turned to the president.\n“Mr. President, who are they?”\nLeon’s finger pointed at the reporters, and President An cautiously replied.\n“They’re reporters…”\n“You mean they’re not the servants serving the meal.”\n“Servants?”\nWhen president Ahn was wondering if he should say that the word sounded rude─\n“Rude! How can a commoner come to a king’s banquet? Kings do not mingle with commoners!”\n“”…………!!!!””\nNot only the reporters, but the secretary and even President Ahn gulped.\nWhat did I just hear? What the hell is that in the 21st century?\n“Your Majesty, wait──”\n“Shut up and behave like a commoner!”\n“Oh, no?!”\nWhat’s wrong with this guy, is he trying to kill someone’s political life?!\nPresident Ahn thought of the news headlines that would appear the next day.\n“Authoritarian survivor’s shocking rant. Enjoying dinner with the president──”\nThe damage to his image and his approval ratings were obvious so president Ahn rushed to defend himself.\n“Hahaha, His Majesty Leon is still not used to reporters. Isn’t this an unavoidable cultural difference? Multiculturalism, which I’ve been actively advocating lately, requires understanding of these cultural differences──”\nPresident Ahn broke out in a cold sweat and passed off the rant as a joke but only a handful of people were allowed to remain at the dinner.\nAt least one reporter was able to stay behind.\n“Well, that’s a good thing, because it’s a ruling party-supporting media outlet.\nBefore Ahn could finish his sigh of relief, Leon dropped a bombshell.\n“It’s a good thing we don’t have any noisy rats.”\n“Please!\nIs he working for the opposition and trying to bring me down by labeling me a racist?\nPresident Ahn tried to change the subject.\n“Your Majesty Leon, how is your life in Korea?”\n“I’m making myself at home, Mr. President, by the way.”\n“What?”\n“Please feel free to speak to me.”\n“Oh, no, I’m comfortable with this.”\n“You’re not a king!\n“Hmm… That’s true.”\nPresident Ahn wondered if this man really understood the position of president as a king.\nThe president was trying to make the dinner as cordial as possible, and Leon understood that.\n‘The president wants something from me.’\nIt’s easy to understand what that might be. In fact, given his track record so far, it’s hard to imagine there’s much he could ask for.\nLeon read about the latest scandal, so he thought that the president was trying to look good and build his own image. But there’s something that Ahn overlooked.\nLeon was the king of a country. He ruled for 70 years and lived for 300 years before the world was destroyed by demons.\nTo the Lionheart King who relied heavily on force, but was also a master of court politics and dealt with an unwilling empire and disparate peoples, Ahn was a young man.\n“By the way, Your Majesty, how was your meal?”\n“Not bad. The food culture in this country seems to be of a high standard.”\n“Haha, I’m glad you liked the meal. What did you like best?”\n“Hmm…….”\nLeon was an Earthling once. He was Korean, and he knew what would win their favor.\n‘That’s why he left a reporter behind.’\nHe picked a reporter from a media outlet that was favorable to the president’s party so he’ll spin the story as favorably as he can.\nLeon chuckled and continued.\n“I love the idea of bibimbap.”\n“Oh, you mean bibimbap?”\nThe reporter’s camera shutter clicked as he turned off his flash.\n“This food is called bibimbap. The colors of the vegetables are harmonious and beautiful. It must be because your ancestors were wise and understanding that they came up with such a harmonious dish.”\n‘Ohhh… that’s it! That’s what I wanted to hear!’\nVery good. That’s a good reaction, and it’s one that’s going to be on YouTube for a while.\n[The Lion King of the Otherworld, praises K-Bibimbap]\n[Japan was surprised, China was horrified, and the U.S. was envious! What is the identity of K-food that even otherworldly royalty praised?]\n[The amazing ‘this’ that made the world tremble and Japan envious. What was His Majesty’s reaction?]\nWow, that’s great. Aside from the national pride, it was a very nice comment.\nHow can you say something so pretty without being asked?\n“It’s like the gods of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods and the Lionheart Kingdom.”\n“Hmm?”\n“My kingdom emphasizes the harmonious coexistence of the divine and the human, just like this bibimbap. They intertwine and shine off each other.”\n“Is that… so?”\nNow that this was said, President Ahn couldn’t help but ask about the divinity and Leon’s kingdom.\n“That…what kind of country was the Lionheart Kingdom?”\n“It was a kingdom that valued honor, cared for its subjects, and revered its divinity. That’s why it’s a pity.”\n“For what…?”\n“The people of this country. In my short time here, I’ve seen their lives, and I’ve seen so many sick, weak, and dying.”\n“Huh… It’s all because I wasn’t good enough, serving the people and──”\n“No, that’s not the problem. It’s the ‘falling ill’ part.”\n“????”\nThe reporter’s camera turns to Leon, naturally waiting for his next words.\n“If you eat the crops blessed by the goddess Demera, you’ll never get sick in your life. Cancer, I believe it was called, and I’m shocked that people die because it can’t be cured.”\nWhat? President Ahn’s mind raced. Is this guy advertising?\nHe’s royalty from a medieval civilization. Does he know about modern advertising techniques?\nAfter that, Leon continued to praise Korean culture, but secretly talked about the miracles of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.\nHowever, all of this was backed up by real-life examples of blessed rice and purified Naju plains and the recent capture of the fiends also played a role.\nAs a result, the president and Leon’s conversation naturally turned to the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.\n“Thank you for the meal. President An, why don’t we take a walk and talk?”\n“Sure.”\nThe two stood up and walked down the path as a reporter followed them, but since it was a private moment, he only took pictures from a distance.\n‘Now is the time to hear what this man has to say.’\n“President Ahn, by the way.”\n“What is it, Your Majesty Leon?”\n“I’ve been trying to understand your political system and culture as best I can.”\n“That’s a good thing. Many survivors do not even attempt to understand Earth’s civilization.”\n“Those are the ignorant ones and I am not one of them but there is something I don’t understand.”\n“What… is it?”\nPresident Ahn swallowed nervously. What this man was about to say was strangely disturbing.\n“Democracy,” he said, “you were elected by an act of the people, a vote. Forty-nine percent of the people in this country voted for you.”\n“Haha, I have the people to thank for that.”\n“That’s the problem.”\n“What?”\nLeon began to speak in an offhand manner.\n“I, an honorable knight, guardian of the Grail, chosen by the Goddess, have one vote, the same as a bunch of lowly mortals… Is that what you mean?”\n“No, of course not, in a democracy…….”\n“This king is saying that democracy is an inefficient system.”\nThe president was puzzled: what was this barbarian talking about?\n“The duty of the common man is to toil, to support the knights and nobles. They are easily tempted by evil because they want more than they need and are unhappy with what they have.”\nHe denied democracy and was against capitalism.\nLeon casually rattled off the conclusions of modern Earth’s political system.\n“My advice for my president is that the only truly happy nation is a perfect one, ruled with an iron fist by a king chosen by the gods. How can commoners who don’t know politics elect a king?”\nUnable to believe his words, he stammered back.\n“Are you denying democracy?”\nLeon shook his head in disbelief.\n“How can I deny a law, however foolish and stupid, that was formed through the due process of a nation?”\nWhoa, President Ahn patted his chest in surprise. But then a shocker hit him.\n“So I’m going to run for president myself.”\n“What?”\n“I don’t like the idea of having to get votes from bums, but I have to follow due process. Of course, once this king is president, I’ll have to tear up all these stupid laws.”\nYou’re saying…you’re going to abolish democracy?\nAhn’s heart rate rose again.\n“Your Majesty, a country is its people, and this country’s democracy was built with the blood of its people!”\nLeon looked dumbfounded but then he declared.\n“The burden is the state, never the other way around.”\n“……!!”\nPresident Ahn was shocked by Leon’s words.\nAhn doesn’t think of himself as righteous. He’s moderately corrupt and moderately disrespectful of the people but not like Leon.\n‘I’m an asshole, but I’m no more of an asshole than this guy!’\nAs the independence fighter in his blood has been ignited his goals for the rest of his term became clear.\n‘Father, grandfather, are you watching? I will stop this horrible authoritarian from doing politics!’\nThe dormant justice within president Ahn Dong-gil was ignited.",

      "content": "Chapter 29: Inner Justice (2)\nThe meal and walk with the president wrapped up neatly.\nAs he listened to Leon’s story, his complexion growing paler and more determined, Leon tapped him on the shoulder.\n“President Ahn. Despite my status as a guest, I have a favor to ask of you.”\n“What… favor?”\nPresident Ahn was very worried about what kind of favor this madman might ask.\nThis was a scumbag king who saw his people as pigs to be exploited!\nAwakening his inner sense of justice, Ahn had long since forgotten about his meal with Chairman Kim a few days earlier.\n“It’s no big deal. I have farmers who farm under me. They told me that the contamination of their land has not yet been procedurally resolved.”\n“Ah…….”\nHe knew immediately what Leon meant.\nLand contaminated with miasma is classified as a contaminated area and all activities are suspended.\nThe Hunan Plain has been cleaned up, but it still needs to be verified and processed, so technically it’s still an administrative contaminated area.\n“The local officials are a bit slow. I’ll get it done soon.”\n“Thank you. I apologize for asking you to do this as a guest.”\n“No, Your Majesty, what you have done for Korea is more than enough.”\nPresident Ahn was wary of Leon, but he didn’t deny Leon’s usefulness. He also had questions about the “blessed rice.”\n“Speaking of which, Your Majesty, how do you intend to distribute the rice in the future?”\n“I’ve decided to sell it through the Association.”\n“Hmm, I see, but it seems like a lot for the Association to handle alone, especially since it’s such a big commodity that even foreign countries would be interested.”\n“We can’t even feed the people of this land, so how can we look to other countries? But if all the peasants have the faith they should, it won’t be too far away.”\nPresident Ahn understood Leon’s intentions, but he hadn’t forgotten what Chairman Kim Dae-young had asked him to do a few days earlier.\nLeon’s blessed crop was a big hit, it was an innovation and the seeds had to be secured by South Korea.\nWhat if Korea was the first to distribute the blessed rice to the entire country and create a national health miracle? President Ahn could only imagine the future.\n‘Hmph…….’\nLeon smiled wickedly, since it was obvious what President Ahn was thinking.\nHowever, he shouldn’t be this surprised. The miracles of being in the company of the divine don’t end there.\n“President Ahn. By the way, the Association has been a bit noisy with me lately.”\n“What? Even though I’ve ordered them to cooperate with you in every way?”\n“Hahaha, indeed, you are the representative of the nation. You’re too good to be true, aren’t you?”\nPresident Ahn was willing to grant Leon’s request no matter what. Since he hadn’t made any overt moves yet, he’d take what he could get.\n“What do you want from the Association, just benefits like the other guilds?”\n“Something about this king having to pay taxes.”\n“……?”\n“As President Ahn knows, counting coins is unbecoming of a king.”\nPolitical figures had fun counting the juice boxes (bribes) they received.\n“How can a king be expected to pay taxes?”\nPresident Ahn was criticized for tax evasion of 10 billion won and even his father-in-law was involved.\n“That can’t be right, I can’t pay a penny of my own, and the commoners of the Association don’t understand. President Ahn should do something about it.”\n‘You’re worse than me, you bastard!’\nOnce again, his inner justice was ignited.\n* * * *\nKim Dae-young, Chairman of Daelong Group, received the introduction to Leon that he had requested from President Ahn and the group was busy preparing all kinds of dinner and welcoming arrangements.\n“Kim Shin-young, can’t you get over here quickly?”\n“Uncle, I’m still not fully recovered!”\nKim Shin-young, was the niece of Daelong Group Chairman Kim Dae-young, a young woman who had recently undergone chemotherapy for breast cancer.\nShe was the epitome of a chaebol spoiled brat, with an unruly personality, but not today.\n“If you don’t behave yourself today, I don’t care if it’s your mom or dad, I’m going to break your legs!”\n“C’mon…I’ve been meaning to go clubbing for a while.”\nEven as she said that, Kim Shin-young was looking forward to Leon’s visit.\nShe had been suffering from chemotherapy and miraculously began to heal after eating the rice.\nOf course, she’s not cured yet, but it’s not too far off, as the large tumor mass has shrunk to a size scientists can’t explain.\nThe blessed rice didn’t even need rehabilitation. In fact, even though the cancer was not yet cured, she felt much healthier than before and her body was full of energy.\nAnd most importantly, she felt a strange energy whenever she ate rice. The mysteriousness of it all bothered her.\n“But Uncle, have you tried that rice yet?”\n“Don’t eat it without knowing what it is. I’ll think about it after the safety tests are done.”\n“Well… I don’t have enough to eat.”\nThe food Shin-young had gotten was what her mom had stolen from the Hunan Plains for her during her treatment.\nIt’s not so easy to find now that it’s strictly monitored by the Association.\n“What kind of man is he?”\nShin-young was curious about Leon, the man who produced such rice. The information that he was a survivor of the attack on the Cheongju Gate was widely spread.\nIt had become quite an issue for him to spread his faith, but Kim Shin-young was the one who had directly benefited from it.\nEven now, she could feel the warmth in her body.\nIt was an indescribable sensation for a woman who was used to clubbing, pleasure, and drugs.\nTime passed, and soon a government motorcade pulled into the ballroom.\n“Your Majesty, welcome!”\nPresident Kim Dae-young greeted Leon with an attitude that made him feel like he was about to throw his hands up in the air but despite his hospitality, Leon narrowed his eyes and clicked his tongue.\n“Tsk. If it weren’t for President Ahn’s request, I wouldn’t have come to this banquet.”\n“Haha… It’s our family honor, Your Majesty.”\nMr. Kim did not make the same mistake as Park Jong-chan of Doojeong Group.\nHis opponent was a thoroughly authoritarian royal. He’s arrogant and treats entrepreneurs as vassals but his power is real.\nWhether it’s faith or the Lionhearted King, it’s a kind of power he doesn’t understand, but in short, it’s enough to make money.\n“The reason I invited you this time is because I have a child who has been cured of a great illness thanks to your grace.”\n“Ho-ho? You say you have a child who has been graced by the goddess?”\n“Yes, yes, Shin-young, what are you doing not coming out?”\nMr. Kim’s strategy was to return the favor for Kim Shin-young, whose cancer was cured thanks to the blessed rice.\nIt may seem like Chairman Kim is giving one-sidedly, but the human heart wants to give back when it receives something.\nIn this way, they build goodwill and maintain their relationship, and naturally talk about business.\n“Ah…….”\nAs Shin-young stood before Leon and something inside her responded.\nIt was a radiant brilliance, a holy halo and glory, and a spiritual power that transcends humanity.\nShin-young shuddered at the intense aura that pulsed through her.\n“Niece?”\nWhat the hell is wrong with her? Was she sick? I told her to not come here if she was sick!\nThe niece of the chairman of Daelong Group, Kim Shin-young was very famous within the group. It’s no secret that she’s a bit of a troublemaker, and she pops pills in broad daylight.\nIf it weren’t for the influence of the Daelong Group, Kim Shin-young would have been in jail as a drug dealer. But even Mr. Kim, the chairman of Daelong Group, hasn’t been able to fix Kim Shin-young’s messed-up behavior. But…….\n“Are you a God? Or are you Death?”\n“Niece, you’re scary. What’s wrong with you?”\n“I am an agent of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods. I am the guardian of light and justice, the keeper of the temple’s flame.”\n“Ah…….”\nAs Leon stood before her, Shin-Young dropped to her knees in fear, desperately avoiding his gaze as if trying to prevent something as filthy as herself from touching him.\nNo one in the house, including Mr. Kim, could even imagine that something like that could happen.\n“Please withdraw your hand…….”\n“Don’t be afraid.”\n“Hmph…!”\nShin-young wondered if this was what the sick woman who touched the hem of Jesus’ garment 2,000 years ago would have felt.\nSomething inside her was burning hot in response to the intensity of the man’s radiance.\nShe felt a sense of fidelity and sacredness in her mind that the drug-induced hallucinations couldn’t even compare to.\n“Hold on to the divinity you feel now. Your purity is pleasing to the Divine, so you will be rewarded.”\n“Hmph… Thank you, thank you, thank you, angel…!”\n“Call me King Lionheart.”\nLeon gently stroked Shin-young’s head as she wept with emotion. It was a sight that would have stunned anyone who knew him on Earth.\nBut aside from that.\n‘What the fuck… I’m scared.’\n‘Why is he… he’s crazy.’\nTo ordinary people who don’t consume the blessed rice and don’t feel the presence of the divine, it would have looked like a terrifying seizure of a drug addict with the difference being that she was so much more subdued than usual.\n“Take this child to the bedroom. She is a child of great spiritual ability so treat her with respect.”\n“Yes? Yes?”\nHe’s…excellent as a religious person?\nThey shot him a questioning glance, but Leon’s gaze was firm.\n“Come on.”\n“Ah, yes, ma’am, this way.”\nFaced with Leon, the staff struggled to carry the sobbing girl with weak legs while Mr. Kim was dumbfounded, but Leon’s voice woke him up.\n“Are these the guests you invited?”\n“What? No, I didn’t invite anyone other than Your Majesty──”\n“There’s Chairman Kim!”\nBefore he could finish his sentence, a group of people rushed in from the other side and the president’s bodyguard team immediately stepped forward, but their voices sounded raspy.\n“President Kim Dae-young, guarantee a five-day workweek!”\n“Raise frozen wages!”\n“Reinstate the unfairly fired employees!”\nProtesters holding signs stormed in and Leon asked.\n“What are they?”\n“Your Majesty, you don’t have to worry about them. Those commie bastards.”\n“What?”\nWhen Leon gave him a look of displeasure, Chairman Kim blurted out.\n“They’re protesters……protesters. They’ve been making a lot of noise lately.”\n“Protesters… What are they?”\n“…….”\nChairman Kim hesitated to answer because if he told the truth here, he’d be the bad guy.\n“It’s not a big deal. I hired them, and now they’re asking me to raise their wages without any gratitude. How many other people could replace them, and they don’t even know what they’re doing.”\n“That is not a good thing to say. Labor is sacred and laborers should be treated accordingly.”\nOops. He was leaning toward social justice, but he misjudged the royalty.\nChairman Kim admitted his mistake and tried to play it off as smoothly as possible.\n“No, of course, our group maintains industry standards for employee accommodations. In fact, we do a pretty good job of it.”\n“Industry standards. I don’t need to hear that.”\n“Ha, ha, ha…….”\nMr. Kim broke out in a cold sweat and quickly thought of something to make Leon feel better. Yeah, righteous in appearance, he thought.\n“His Majesty is giving me a big lesson so I’ll raise their wages.”\n“Raise their wages? How?”\n“What?”\nLeon stared at Chairman Kim with questioning eyes, he was genuinely puzzled.\n“There’s no need to raise wages since you already have a set rate.”\n“What? Ah… I heard that His Majesty also favors farmers. What is your majesty’s opinion…….”\n“Ninety percent.”\n“……!”\nFor a moment, Kim wondered if he’d misheard.\n“In the Lionheart Kingdom, where we are taught by the Goddess, people give ninety percent of their output. It’s benevolent and it guarantees them a whopping 10% return.”\n“Huh!”\n“Crazy…….”\n“Unbelievable…….”\nThe exclamations came from all directions.\nTen percent? Ninety percent?\nIt was a horrific tax that even an old British colonial scoundrel couldn’t have imagined.\n‘Is it really okay to join hands with such a devilish person?’\nThis gave Chairman Kim Dae-young a great sense of skepticism.\nAlthough he is a vicious businessman in the eyes of the world, he prides himself on having lived a life of minimal goodness.\nAt least he didn’t let his employees starve to death although like many businessmen, he’s worked his employees to death, subcontracting to third, fourth, and fifth parties to cut costs and creating harsh working conditions.\nBut Leon wasn’t like that.\nTo take away ninety percent of the people’s earnings as taxes, how could anyone be this evil?\nChairman Kim realized he was a real medieval king.\nHe was terrified of what would happen if someone like this had influence over domestic companies.\n‘What an evil man…I am one, but not as evil as him!’\nThe next day, there were reports of a dramatic settlement with the protesters.\n* * * *\nEven with the president’s introduction, Leon doesn’t bother to meet with the lowly merchant in order to distribute 10% of the rice produced in the Naju Plain.\nThe government takes 10% and leaves the rest to the farmers to dispose of freely, but today’s farmers don’t have the “power” to distribute the rice.\nAs the name of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods spreads through YouTube s and news of the Temple and the blessed crops appear on the news, interest in the issue is amplified.\nThis means that individual farmers are powerless to protect it unless they sell their goods.\nImmediately, Han Ha-ri reported that while distributing the rice, they were attacked by cancer patients.\nIt was a disturbance caused by a few desperate, terminally ill patients, but there’s no telling when it will lead to hired guns and mercenaries.\n“Two hundred and thirty million won a kilogram.”\nHa-ri cheered from the sidelines, because it was a lot more than what the Association was paying.\n“That’s a steal, Your Majesty!”\n“It should be cheaper.”\n“What?”\n“It’s the market that sets the price of goods, but the crops are so expensive.”\n“Uh…….”\nIsn’t expensive a good thing?\nHa-ri thought so inwardly, but Leon disagreed.\n“If it’s so expensive, how can the poor people buy it and eat it? God’s favor should be given equally to all the people.”\n“So…?”\n“I told the President that he should educate the peasants and preach divine favor, but he said that the President must remain religiously neutral.”\n“Well…he has a point.”\nWhere Leon lived, religion was a powerful force, but here on Earth, it was different.\nThe theocracy had died out hundreds of years ago, and the only place left where the political establishment could proselytize was in the Middle East.\nThe president was supposed to be religiously neutral.\n“Well, this has gathered quite a bit of faith, enough to build up the power of the Lionheart and its legions.”\nAt that, Ha-ri realized something and spoke up.\n“Those whom your majesty ordered to prepare are currently on standby.”\n“Hmm. Have you found a suitable dungeon?”\n“Yes, but your Majesty…are you sure you don’t mind?”\n“What do you mean?”\nHari dutifully prepared what Leon had requested.\nEven though she had become a temporary employee of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild, the Association was keeping a close eye on Leon, so it was easy for her to give in to his demands.\n“The yellow-ranked gate that appeared this morning…I’ve already bid on it, as your majesty wishes.”\nA yellow grade gate it’s a gate that Leon, who has more than enough power, can handle on his own. But he’s not the one clearing this gate.\n“It would be… impossible for those chosen by His Majesty to attack that gate.”\n“Well. That remains to be seen.”\n“????”\nLeon smirked at the questioning Ha-ri.\n“If they cannot do it with this king by their side I won’t be able to use them as soldiers.”\nTwo days later more than 50 Hunters were gathered in front of Samjeon Station in Songpa-gu, Seoul and among them was Koo Dae-sung, who had been a D-rank Hunter for 10 years.",

      "content": "Chapter 30: The Good Orc (1)\n“Hey, isn’t that Mr. Koo? Did you get the text too?”\n“Team Leader Kim? Nice to see you here again.”\nSeeing the familiar face, Koo scratched his head and said hello.\n“What’s going on, anyway? The president of the association has called all of us low-rank hunters together.”\nAt that, Koo Dae-sung realized that the Hunters gathered here were all D-rank… or at most C-rank Hunters.\nHe wondered if they were trying to recruit new employees, but the Association’s salaries are not high to say the least. If you’re trying to make ends meet, it’s not a very attractive prospect.\nOf course, if you’re a member of the Association, they tend to give you decent weapons and supplies……..\nHe wondered how long they had to wait until they saw a group of Association employees in the distance, approaching them.\n“Oh… it’s Ms. Han Ha-ri.”\n“Han Ha-ri, the Flame Swordsman?”\n“I heard she broke the record for the highest price in last year’s draft.”\nThe young woman’s braided red hair was impressive, and her admiring gaze made Koo Dae-sung inwardly envy Ha-ri.\nHow could he not be jealous that someone twelve years younger than him was being honored with such a brilliant talent?\nSoon, however, another celebrity that Ha-ri couldn’t compare to appeared.\n“His Majesty Leon Dragonia Lionheart!”\nLeon is politely escorted to the podium by the Association’s staff.\n“Heh…….”\nWhen Dae-Sung saw Leon on the news about the closing of the Cheongju Gate, he was stunned.\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart was a survivor and the king of a kingdom destroyed by demons.\nHe knew the blond man he met at the test was out of the ordinary but he had no idea Leon was a survivor.\n‘That’s why he was so strong…….’\nSurvivors are special people. They were great men and women who had survived the destruction of their world, heroes with special powers, unlike ordinary people like him.\nNow that he’s cleared the Cheongju Gate, he’ll continue to rise.\nIt’s already being said that Leon should be promoted to S-class Hunter even though he’s been a D-grade for 10 years…….\nKoo Dae-sung was honestly envious of him, envious of his strength, envious of the fame he was going to get.\nAnyone would be like that and he wanted to be like that too……. But the reality is harsh. He couldn’t be like him so there’s no reason to think about it.\n“Gather round, you have been summoned for a reason.”\nThe Hunters stirred at Leon’s words. It was Leon, not the President, who summoned them?\nAnd if so, what is the relationship between the President and Leon?\nDid the survivor named Leon decide to join the Hunter’s Association?\nWith speculation flying and the local broadcast showing no signs of slowing down, Ha-ri shouted into the microphone.\n“Silence, His Majesty speaks!”\nAwkwardly, the Hunters stopped talking at her words and only when they all looked at him did Leon speak.\n“I will recruit soldiers to join the Ten Thousand Gods Guild. Only those who are worthy, those who have proven themselves and those who have endured the training will be allowed the honor of entering the gates of this king.”\n“”?????””\nThe Hunters were dumbfounded by Leon’s words.\nBut aside from that, the idea of being the next S-class Hunter and joining the guild of a survivor was very appealing.\nIn the top 10 guilds in Korea with S-class hunters, the lowest cut is B-class. Even if they don’t make it, they’re at the upper end of Class C, where Class B growth is likely.\nIt was common for hunters who were class C or D hunters to have to work in small and medium-sized guilds or as porters because they weren’t good enough.\nTo them, the invitation to join an S-ranked Hunter’s guild was too tempting.\n“Hey, is it okay for anyone who wants to join?”\n“Enlistment. Anyway…not just anyone can join. You’ll have to pass a test.”\nAt Leon’s words, the Hunters were tempted to just do a little test, but they didn’t see it as a big deal.\nAs a bunch of D-list hunters like themselves they didn’t think they would make the cut. And then there were those who saw it as a great opportunity and were passionate about it.\n“No, I’ll do it! Unconditionally!”\nLike Koo Dae-sung, there were those who wanted honor and growth to enter Leon’s gates.\n“Then let’s get right to it! We’ll proceed with the practical test. The test is… clearing the Three Regions Gate, which was bid on by His Majesty’s Ten Thousand Gods Guild!”\n“The Three Regions Gate?”\nIt was a familiar neighborhood for him since Koo Dae-Sung had gone to high school nearby.\nThe Hunters immediately used their phones to search for gates in the Three Regions Gate.\n“Uh… it’s a yellow grade.”\n“What?”\n“How are we supposed to clear it?”\nGates are categorized into black, red, orange, yellow, green, and blue.\nThe gate at Seoul Station, which is used as a test for D-rank Hunters, is rated blue.\nGiven that most of the Hunters here are Class C or D, their toughest targets are yellow, where they act as porters.\n“This is ridiculous! You want us to clear the yellow level by ourselves? You’re asking us to die!”\n“What kind of test is this?”\nThe room echoed as more than 100 people shouted.\n“If you don’t want to continue you’re welcome to leave.”\n“Ha! You don’t really think I’m not going to leave when you ask me to leave.”\n“What a waste of time!”\nOne by one, the hunters leave.\nKoo Dae-Sung glanced at Ha-ri and Leon, hoping to stop them, but they showed no sign of stopping them.\nMore than half the hunters were gone, and less than fifty remained when Leon stood up.\n“‘You there, the one who looks like he got hit by a bomb.”\n“Yeah, yeah!”\nThe afro-haired Hunter stammered back.\n“Why did you stay?”\n“Well, it’s just…I thought it might all have a deeper meaning…….”\n“I see. You there. Why did you stay?”\n“I, I… I just stayed.”\nEven with that answer, Leon nodded and turned his attention to Koo Dae-Sung.\n“Why did you stay?”\nKoo Dae-sung replied in a voice that was both embarrassed and excited that Leon was speaking to him from such a great height.\n“I didn’t think you would let us die, so I stayed!”\n“Hmm. You’re determined, that’s good.”\nLeon tapped him on the shoulder and it was strangely not unpleasant. On the contrary, it was encouraging.\n“This king said he’s here to recruit soldiers.”\nIt was a difference in words, but a big difference.\n“The virtue of a soldier is obedience so do not question your knight’s orders. Trust in the honor of the knight, trust in the strength of the knight; that is all that is required of you.”\nIn short, he’d pick the one who listened.\n“We’re going! Get your supplies and be ready.”\nThe fifty or so Hunters quickly donned their gear and headed for the Three Regions Gate.\n* * * *\n“Hmmm… a little heavy.”\nKoo Dae-sung agreed with Kim’s small complaint.\nHe and the other applicants to join the Then Thousand Gods Guild were all heavily armed.\nWith the exception of the ranged dealers, the melee fighters all wore a common set of equipment: shields and armor.\n“I’m a dealer…….”\nInstead of his usual longsword, Koo Dae-sung picked up a shield and a one-handed sword. This would make it difficult for him to use his usual sword techniques.\n“Still, your equipment is good. Isn’t it all rare? It must have cost 10 million won.”\nThe hunter’s equipment that Leon had purchased at his own expense from the Daelong Group’s Daelong Iron and Steel were high-end items that even D-class hunters couldn’t afford.\nWeapons and armor are inherently consumable, so it’s not easy for a low-rank Hunter like Koo Dae-sung to spend a lot of money on equipment.\nBut with Leon paying for all of their equipment, they were able to equip themselves with luxuries they never thought possible.\n“Really…he’s not going to just let us die.”\n“He said it was a test.”\nApparently, this otherworldly king may have a strange personality, but he’s not stingy.\n“But he’s actually a bit skimpy with his clothes.”\n“I know.”\nLeon is dressed in casual clothes and aside from a rather ragged-looking leather jumper, he wears no armor.\n“Mr. Han Ha-ri.”\n“Yeah, what’s up? Hunter Koo Dae-sung?”\nHan Ha-ri also wore armor.\n“Leon ──”\nHa-ri interrupted Dae-Sung.\n“Shhh! You can’t call His Majesty’s name without permission, he’ll be angry!”\n“Ah… is that so, then why doesn’t His Majesty… wear armor?”\n“Because His Majesty’s skin is harder than armor.”\n“????”\n* * * *\nWhat the Hunters saw when they entered the Three Regions Gate was a field reminiscent of the vast European meadows.\nIn this day and age, such a vast expanse of nature is breathtaking to behold.\n“At least we won’t have to fight while inhaling smoke.”\nNot all gates are this pleasant, especially the cave dungeon gates, which are often filled with heat from the aftermath of battle.\n‘The quest is…….’\nKoo Dae-Sung wasn’t distracted by the natural surroundings and went straight to the quest.\n[You are mercenaries from the outside. In this great steppe where tribal wars are raging, choose one of the two tribal alliances and lead them to victory]\n“Hmm… an NPC-assisted quest.”\nJust like the Cheongju Gate or the Hunan Plains Gate, the gate will naturally close after clearing the quest.\n“Mr. Koo, it’s a faction quest, right?”\n“Yes. It seems that you have to take the side of one of the two warring tribal confederations and lead them to victory.”\nIt was the same thing no matter which side they picked.\n“The question is, which side is easier to support?”\nIn these optional quests, the reward depends on the choice you make. The problem is how to figure that out but the moment of truth came quickly.\n“Hey, everybody, look over there! I think it’s a monster!”\nThe Hunters’ gazes snapped up at the shout, where a group of hulking figures were walking toward them.\nFangs jutting out. Massively muscled, huge axes. Green-skinned. They were…….\n“Oh, orcs?!”\n“Orcs!”\nOrcs, humanoids that are almost as common as goblins in fantasy-type gates.\n“Seriously, you can’t be talking about a tribal war…….”\n“A war of orcs!?”\nDozens of orcs approached and an orc who rode up to them on a large boar spoke in a booming voice.\n“Who are you? This is the territory of our Warhammer Tribe, and you have invaded our territory!”\nKoo Dae-Sung hurriedly approached Ha-ri and Leon to ask about their course of action.\n“Uhm… Your Majesty, for now, why don’t we follow the quest?”\n“……As you wish.”\nLeon narrowed his brow, but left the judgment to Ha-ri. She looked at the quest window and took it as her line for the quest.\n“We’re mercenaries! We’re here to help the tribe in exchange for rewards.”\n“Mercenaries?”\nThe orcs tilt their heads at Ha-ri’s words, then nod in agreement.\n“These must be the outsiders the chieftain was talking about, follow me!”\nThanks to the quest scenario, the orcs accepted the Hunters with ease, and they entered a camp set up by dozens of orcs.\n“Welcome, mercenaries. I am Karta Karak, chieftain of the Warhammer Tribe.”\n“Call me Han Ha-ri.”\nHan Ha-ri awkwardly greeted the leader, as she naturally became the spokesperson when Leon didn’t step forward.\n“Hmm, I heard you’d have some useful mercenaries, but you’re not as useful as I thought.”\n“Haha…….”\n“We are currently in the midst of a great battle to determine the Great Chieftain of the Grasslands. The tribes are sending their warriors to fight, and whoever wins will be closer to becoming the Great Chieftain.”\n‘Such a quest.’\nKoo Dae-Sung flipped through the guidebooks he’d kept in his head, having read countless examples of how to attack the gate.\nOrcs are a warlike race that loves to fight and decides everything by war.\nWhile they were generally hostile to all other races, they tended to respect warriors and value honorable combat.\nIn short, it’s easy to win their favor if you fight well.\n‘The rewards for quests involving orcs are mainly weapons, but if you’re lucky, you might get an elemental weapon or the ability to communicate with spirits from a shaman.’\nElementalists are a rare breed among Hunters and once you master the skill, you’re guaranteed to reach at least a B-rank, so it’s known among Hunters as the lotto of Orc quests.\nThe Heart of an Orc Warrior is a powerful magical ingredient that can be used as a permanent body enhancer. It was also called the lotto of lower-level Hunters.\nBut that’s not all as every single Orc is at least a Rank C monster. They are powerful monsters, averaging about B-rank.\nOn top of that, they almost always move as a unit, and the rewards are not worth the trouble.\nAs a result, orc gates are terrible, with many players reselling their gates after they’ve won the auction.\n‘Still, there are dozens of tribes fighting, so we might get lucky and get one or two.’\nWhile Koo Dae-Sung expressed his vague expectations, Karta Karak blew out a thick breath and clenched his fists.\n“Support our Warhammer tribe. Greater wars! More honorable deaths! He who wins shall have it all!”\n“Hmph.”\nThat was it. The cynical sneer on his face was unmistakable.\n“Who are you?”\n“Uh, not me!”\nA Hunter waved his hand in the air, stunned by the momentum of Karta Karak but just then, Leon stepped forward.\n“I’m afraid I’m not going to have any of this.”\n“Your Majesty?”\nHa-ri was taken aback by Leon’s sudden move, but she didn’t dare stop him.\n“You’re…a strong warrior, and with a warrior like you helping us, the showdown will be our honorable victory──”\n“Honor? You’re a brute, with no idea what you’re talking about!”\n“Insulting me──!”\nIt was that moment. Leon’s sword flashed out of thin air, and in the blink of an eye, it sliced through Karta Karak’s neck.\n“Huh?”\n“Eh?”\n“No, what!”\nThe orcs, and even the Hunters, stiffened in horror. Leon, however, points his holy sword and declares with a mischievous expression.\n“You will die, not as honorable warriors, but as worms waiting for the ground, for that is the eternal justice!”\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart is a super orc racist and the Legendary Orc Butcher who buried 8,769,653 orcs.",

      "content": "Chapter 31: The Good Orc (2)\nThe orc chieftain’s head rolled back and as everyone stood there, mouths agape, unable to comprehend the situation, Yappy, who had been sitting on top of Ha-ri’s head, was the first to react.\n[Hostile target recognized. Annihilation initiated.]\nYappy’s robotic arm stretched out steel wires and swung like a whip through a perfectly calculated trajectory.\n“You killed the chieftain, bas──!”\nThe orcs didn’t even manage to show their anger because their heads were already cut.\nThe severed heads of the orcs feel like neatly cut cube steaks.\n“Enemy! Kill!”\n“Kill them!”\nThe orcs in the camp charged in unison as Leon shouted.\n“Raise your shields! Form a circle and block their charge!”\nLeon’s words awakened the Hunters, including Koo Dae-Sung, and they instinctively raised their shields to block the orcs’ charge.\n“Boom!”\n“Shit, what the hell is this…!”\n“I don’t know!”\nThe orcs, who had their chieftain and kin’s decapitated, were enraged and tried to kill the Hunters.\n“Raise your shields higher, shields don’t just protect you, protect the right shoulder of the comrade next to you!”\n“Ugh…!”\n“Stop!”\nThe Hunters protected each other with their shields. But it was only a matter of time.\n“Damn, they’re too strong!”\n“We’re only D-class Hunters! How are we supposed to win against orcs with similar numbers?”\nOrcs, a natural fighting race where even the weakest orc was a match for a Class C Hunter.\nWith their large stature and bulging muscles, the hunters were not a match for them. Normally, it would be a miracle if they even survived the first charge.\n“Huh?”\nKoo Dae-Sung realized that they were blocking the orcs’ charge.\nIt was strange because the Hunters here are the lowest-rank Hunters who can’t go one-on-one against Orcs. But strangely, he wasn’t afraid. Just having Leon beside him was a relief, and he felt a surge of strength, like he could accomplish anything.\nAt that moment, several Hunters saw a system message floating in the corner of their vision.\n[Aura of the Lion’s Heart]\n◆Effect:\nGrants Legion Hardened Assault Defense.\nGrants Legion-Hardened Fortification.\nGrants Legion Reinforcement Battalion Reinforcement.\nGrants Legion Strengthened Valor.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Light Armor.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Tough Skin.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Heavy Strike.\nGrants Legion-Enhanced Archaic Empowerment.\nGrants Legion Improved Ranged Resistance.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Keen Gaze.\nGrants Legion Improved Anti-Infantry Slaughter.\nGrants Legion-Powered Pollution Resistance.\n[Greatest Orc Butcher]\nEffect:\n-Grants 50% Critical Hit against Orcs.\n-Orcs are struck with fear, confusion, and despair.\n– Spreads a well-deserved hatred of orcs.\nWhat is this?\n[Living Demigod]\n[Protector of the War Knights]\n[Grail Guardian]\n[Dragon Slayer’s Honor\n[Terror of Demonic Species]\n[Demon Lord Slayer]\n[Greatest Demon Slayer]\n[Strongest Charger]\n──The level of the Legion members is too low. Many of the enhancement traits are not applicable.\n‘Crazy…!’\nWhat the hell. It’s a scam!\nSometimes the Hunter’s unique class, Commander, was similar to this.\nNatural command, operational skills…and troop buffs could hardly affect a large battlefield in a Red Gate.\nHowever, it was a class that required a rear-guard position due to its lack of combat capabilities, so how could a man with such powerful combat capabilities like Leon possess such power?\n“Raise your shield! Push back! Plunge your sword into the gap!”\nThe voice of the knight-king thundered in their heads and the mere sound of it filled them with a surge of courage and made them shiver with a sense of omnipotence.\nWith him…we shall triumph.\nThe unfounded confidence grows and actually pushes the orcs’ momentum back. From wherever the unbelievable power came from, a stabbing blade pierced the orc’s tough hide.\n“I, the Warrior God…!”\nThe orcs screamed their last words, calling out to their god. But the Lionhearted King would have none of it.\n“How dare these vile beasts call upon their gods! Cut off their tongues, decapitate their heads, and insult their false gods!”\nLeon could not remain still and summoned the divine beast Stallion.\nThe pure white colossus bathed in divine light and revealed green skin in its eyes.\n-Kurrrrrrrr!\nIt roars as its gaze sears with rage and he leaps through the dust, carrying his ally with him.\n“What the…!”\n“What!”\nThe orcs panic, looking at Stallion who delivered a sharp back kick and the orc’s neck snapped and he fell limply to the ground.\n“Let’s go, Stallion!”\nSummoning his holy spear, Leon began to slaughter the orcs that surrounded the Hunters and it took less than ten minutes for the 130 orcs in the orc camp to be decimated.\n“Well done, Stallion.”\n-Poof!\nStallion disappeared, telling Leon to summon him again when he finds more orcs.\nAll around him were the bodies of the slain orcs and the unharmed Hunters.\n“Let there be a shout of victory, an honorable victory!”\n“Whoa, whoa, whoa…….”\n“Waaaah?”\nThe Hunters were dumbfounded as they couldn’t believe that they had won against over a hundred orcs and not a single one was injured.\n“This is strange… Are orcs normally this weak?”\n“No, it was completely different from normal, an unknown power surge.”\nEven those who weren’t looking at the messages felt it instinctively that an unknown force had enveloped them.\n“Is he….a Commander?”\n“No, I heard from the Golden Lion Guild that he single-handedly destroyed the Yakt Spinner.”\n“He’s a combat class, and he has buff skills like that? Is that possible?”\n“……Lionheart King. I heard he’s the king of knights.”\nThey suddenly realized who they were looking at.\nKing Lionheart, a knight of unparalleled strength and a commander who had won countless battles that even before he became the king, he was a renowned War Knight, a border guard who slaughtered countless orcs.\n“I… Your Majesty.”\nHa-ri approached Leon with a bloody face, her sword stained with orc blood.\n“What is it, Ha-ri?”\n“Uh, why did you…do this?”\nAt that, Leon looked genuinely puzzled.\n“Would this king need a reason to kill orcs?”\n“Huh? But the quest is…….”\n“Helping orcs to complete a quest? That’s insane. I’d rather throw myself into a fire than help those green beasts.”\nLeon’s anger at the orcs was unending.\n“They are beasts unworthy of respect. Their very existence is a blight, and they don’t deserve to live.\nHonor? Warriors? There is no honor in their warfare. They may be brave, but how can the ferocity of a beast be compared to the valor of a knight?\n“Do not treat them as men. They are disgusting beasts that do not deserve to live.”\n‘He’s an orc racist.’\nHa-ri vowed never to tell Leon that there were orc survivors on Earth since she could clearly see what would happen if Leon found out about them.\n“Uh, why does your majesty hates them so much?”\n“They can’t build a civilization and are a bunch of dregs that spend their lives fighting. What kind of culture is going to blossom from a people who depend on plunder? They’ll never be able to blend in with other races.”\n“Hmm…….”\nHe had a point since over the course of thirty years, quite a few orcs had crossed over to Earth, but they had all became fiends.\nThe proliferation of the Orc Harlem in the United States is still a plague on American society, and Orcs are involved in the drug trade, massacres in South America, and more.\nMurder and violence were the hallmarks of the race, and they could never be integrated into civilized society.\nHowever, their ability to reproduce was superior to that of humans, and their voting rights and cultural differences plagued the world.\nSo much so that a new phrase was coined: orcophobia.\n“So…how do you propose to close the gate?”\n“Kill all the orcs at this gate! Every last one!”\nHa-ri’s shoulders jolted at the declaration as Yappy landed on her head.\n“Lord Spinner, anything to report?”\n[Scouting report. Field area measured. Two and a half million square kilometers. Fifty-six orc camps found. Orc numbers approximately 4,650.]\n“Four thousand…”\nEven though they had to take a side to win, the scale of the battle was staggering and Leon chose the option of killing all the orcs, so the difficulty level of the gate was no longer yellow, but scarlet.\n“Hmm… For a bunch of beasts, there are quite a few of them.”\n“A few?”\n“Yes. In the Kingdom of Beasts, a single orc tribe had a standard number of 100,000.”\nConsidering the nature of the gate, this was a staggering number.\n“Your Majesty… do you really intend to kill them all? That… would take too much time, to say the least.”\n“Hmm… I’m sure this king can manage, but it’s not right to take up too much of my time with these beasts.”\nBut Leon has not given up, and he intends to kill every last orc in this gate, no matter how long it takes.\n[Your Majesty. Suggestion.]\nIt was then that Yappy made a suggestion in his mechanical voice.\n“What is it, Lord Spinner?”\nYappy showed a hologram through his camera eye. It was a map of the field, created shortly after the battle, when he launched his mapping scope into the sky.\nHe captured the headwaters of the river as it cut through the orc villages.\n* * * *\nMidnight, in the dead of night, while the orcs slept, three figures appeared upriver.\n[This place.]\nYappy from above Ha-ri’s head points upstream with his sharp legs.\n“Hmm. I’ll leave it to you.”\nYakt Spinner dipped into the flowing river and activated its energy.\n[Initiating core overload. Power at 99.9%.]\nYakt Spinner began to activate his core at full power and the cooling system shuts down as the energy kicks in, and a plume of smoke rises.\n[Core overloaded. Cooling system failing. Fuel rods rapidly age. Core meltdown. Eject fuel rods.]\nThe Yakt Spinner opened its carapace and ejected the fuel rods inside as with a bang, something that resembled poop appeared.\n“Mmm, looks like shit…….”\n“Don’t speak dirty words in my presence.”\nWell, she wasn’t wrong.\nYakt Spinner is powered by a small nuclear reactor and the high-power electricity generated by the reactor creates a perpetual motion machine. But because it’s a reactor, it has fuel rods, and in the event of an emergency, a self-destruct sequence that overloads the reactor and causes nuclear fusion happens.\nYakt spinner was only halfway through the self-destruct sequence as it overloaded the reactor to the point of core meltdown and ejected the fuel rods when the critical level was reached.\nThe extremely dangerous radioactive material inside the fuel rods, including cesium-137, iodine-131, stannium-90, and plutonium-238, is exposed along with the fuel rods and contaminates the river.\nThe river that all the orcs in the field use for drinking water is pickled in radioactivity.\n“I…Your Majesty, we are safe under your protection, but… is this okay?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“…According to chivalry, this is cowardly.”\nLeon smirked at Ha-ri’s question. He didn’t seem to feel the slightest bit remorseful for carrying out a plot that he himself would consider cowardly.\n“What kind of chivalry is that against beasts? If I can kill one more, I’ll use a ranged weapon.”\n“Eek…….”\n“Ha-ri, Lord Spinner, this is not a war or a duel against green beasts.”\nLeon said in a voice that held endless hatred and contempt.\n“It’s about exterminating the beasts. What hunter has honor when he hunts?”\n“Umm…there can be good orcs, too.”\n“Ha…!”\nAs if he had heard something funny, Leon let out a sneer and spoke the unchangeable truth as if to enlighten these foolish and clueless people.\n“The only good orc is a dead orc.”",

      "content": "Chapter 32: The Good Orc (3)\nGroktar, a warrior of the Bladeaxe Clan, began his day with a bang.\n“Kahahahaha! Groktar has cracked Galdin’s skull!”\n“That was some good axe work, brother!”\nGroktar prays for his compatriot, whose skull was split open in a morning quarrel.\n“You died fighting bravely, and the Warrior God will send you to the eternal battlefield.”\nAfter blessing the corpse of his fallen comrade, Groktar heads to the river. He raises his staff to the water, celebrating his honorable victory.\n“Groktar, Groktar of the Bladeaxe Clan!”\nA voice called out from across the river. It was an orc from a hostile tribe in the bloodbath that would determine the next Great Chieftain of the Grasslands.\n“Yes, and who are you!”\n“My name is Balbata, of the Iron Fist tribe!”\n“Yes, Balbata! What is it!”\n“Fight me! I will defeat you and honor my people!”\n“Hmph, good! Raise your axe!”\nGroktar split Balbata’s head open and drank victory ale.\nAll around him were orcs who, like Balbata, had come to drink water and then challenged their kindred to a duel and lost. Was that why?\n“Hmm, the water tastes unusual today.”\nSomething about the water tingled and tickled him, making it taste strange. But this was the only water they had to quench their thirst, so they couldn’t find any other.\nGroktar carried the bucket of water back to his tribe and then the tragedy began.\nGroktar realized that his body was rapidly deteriorating.\nBefore lunchtime, he lost his senses and fell unconscious several times.\nThe radioactive material was destroying water molecules in his body, creating an excess of free radicals.\nThe resulting hydroxyl radicals destroyed his body’s cells in real time, and he tasted an unpleasant metallic taste in his mouth – the taste buds on his tongue had been disrupted.\nIn less than an hour, he lost every hair on his body and experienced nausea, vomiting, generalized weakness, and bleeding.\nHis body felt heavy, like he was carrying a boulder, and his vision was spinning and he couldn’t see clearly.\n“…Lord, shaman…call a shaman…….”\nGroktar cried out in pain and slipped out of his tent. He crawled out on his knees, but all he saw were his brothers with the same symptoms he had.\n“Shaman, shaman ah…….”\nThey had found the tribe’s shaman.\nA shaman who didn’t usually treat wounds, only performing tattoo spells to strengthen the tribe members but they asked him to remove the curse on them.\n“What, what… I don’t know about this. I’ve never seen anything like this!”\nThis wasn’t a spell or a curse, it was the result of drinking water from a river contaminated with highly concentrated radiation so a shaman couldn’t deal with it.\nThe orcs were only able to survive because of their natural physical prowess; lesser creatures would have died from the tainted blood they vomited.\nAnd so it was that the orcs in the meadows lay dying, contaminated by radiation.\n“Glory to the Lionheart!”\nThe thundering footsteps of the Hunters echoed across the meadow as Leon javelin pierced the orc shaman’s torso.\n“Kuhhhh!”\nThe orc shaman, pierced through the torso, tried to attack the raiders with elemental magic even as he was lifted up, but was instead thrown and rolled across the ground.\n“Exterminate the beasts, do not let a single one live!”\nWith a rumbling shout, the Hunters burst into the orc camp.\n“Go, free experience points! Kill them all!”\n“I can’t believe how easy it is to kill orcs.”\nThe Hunters slaughtered orc after orc, whistling as they did so at the emaciated state of the orcs they had never seen before.\nIt was not a battle, it was a massacre, a slaughter.\n“Mmm…Your Majesty.”\n“What is it, Ha-ri?”\n“If we kill the radioactive orcs…we’ll be exposed to the radiation too.”\n“The toxins, you mean? They’re nothing to worry about.”\nLeon was not unaware of the toxicity of radioactive materials as Yappy had explained the dangers well enough, and that it was powerful enough to kill all the orcs in the meadow.\n“It doesn’t matter. If it’s that toxic, it can be washed away by eating the crops Demera has blessed us with. Best of all, all who enter the gates of this king will have the power to ‘resist contamination’.”\n“……haha.”\nWhat does this mean for the quest? The dungeon’s closing requirements were shattered… At that moment, a message popped up in front of Ha-ri’s eyes.\n[You have turned the entire Orc Tribal Alliance against you, becoming their public enemies.]\n“What the hell…….”\nA quest change? This was the first time a quest had been changed and Ha0ri looked at the new quest.\n[Hidden Quest: Slay all orcs in the field]\n“Your Majesty, the quest has been…changed.”\nAs Ha-ri reported the changed quest, Leon smiled in satisfaction.\n“Good! At last, justice has been done! Soldiers of Lionheart! The time for light and justice has come!”\nA few hundred orcs remained and Leon intended to dispose of every last one of them.\n─────!!\nIt was then that there was a strange change in the air in the center of the orc camp and the sky was turning green.\n“What is that?”\nLeon rode Stallion straight to the center of the change and found the orcs gathered there.\n“It’s you! It’s you! You’re the one who poured the curse on the river!”\nHundreds of sick and dying orcs and a robed orc shaman looked at Leon and the Hunters, bloodshot and furious.\n“You wicked bastards, you cowards, you call yourselves warriors!”\nThe orc shaman wept tears of blood as he watched his people die a horrible death.\nOrcs are a race closer to death than any other, but because of this there was no such thing as a dishonorable death.\n“Ha.”\nLeon sneered in amusement at the orcs’ cries.\n“Worthless beasts crying out for honor.”\nThe beast’s eyes, screaming with rage, were hollow and dirty, and it was a humiliation for Leon to meet their gaze.\n“The honor of the Lionheart King is not to be found in the eyes of beasts. It’s a crime that cannot be forgiven, even if you are covered in blood and have your eyeballs gouged out alive.”\nThe orcs shuddered at the chilling sentence.\n“Curse your ugly selves and give yourself a chance to redeem yourselves, you filthy beasts.”\n“Arrogant bastards, Gokrok will not forgive you!”\nAt that moment, the shaman’s eyes glowed green and he emitted a doomed aura.\n“The beast speaks!”\nLeon didn’t wait for the energy to dissipate but lifted his holy spear and hurled it at the shaman.\nSeveral orcs raised their shields to protect the shaman, but the javelin, thrown with superhuman strength, pierced through them and slammed into the shaman’s gut.\n“No! It’s…too late!”\nThe shaman poured all of his life force and the life spell succeeded as a portal opened.\n“Gokrok descends…! Our great Shaman God will… punish you!”\nAs if the gates of hell had opened, a black pit pushed through the space, and the great breath from within sucked in all directions.\n“For…the Shaman God!”\n“To avenge our brothers!”\nThe orcs offered no resistance and were willingly sucked in.\n“Your majesty, what is that!”\n“Ha, a human sacrifice. Indeed, beasts, and not the least bit civilized.”\n“…….”\n“…….”\nHa-ri and the other Hunters stared at Leon in disbelief. There were many things she wanted to say, but she decided to hold back.\n“Behold! This is the great right arm and eye of Gokrok!”\n[Hidden Quest: Defeat the Orc Shaman God Gokrok]\n* * * *\nOrcs are an otherworldly race of uncertain origins but their characteristics are simple: they are violent, combative, and highly fertile.\nThey are despised as savage beasts, but they have their gods and Gokrok, the Orc Shaman, one of the Three Great Orc Gods.\nHe answered the summons of the orc shaman who inherited his wisdom.\nThough it took the sacrifice of hundreds of orcs and the souls of thousands of orcs to summon one arm and one eyeball Gokrok saw the Orc Butcher in his searing green eyes and with all his might, he summoned his mouth and called the creature.\n[Unacceptable, must be destroyed]\nGokrok’s eyes glowed and a green beam that was aimed at Leon shot out but the protection of the arrow shield, a holy law that allowed any ranged attack to be blocked once, blocked Gokrok’s eye beam.\n[Protected by a being like me, who is the god that protects you?]\nGokrok realized that the power that blocked the force was that of a transcendent being. Though on a different plane, he was intrigued by a being that could stand up to him.\n“A being… like you?”\nBut Leon’s reaction was dramatic. There was no fear or hesitation in the face of a divine being, but rather anger.\nAll positivity is stripped from his fresh smile, replaced by a vast amount of murderous rage.\n“You bastard. You think you’re a god by being the leader of beasts! Argh!”\nLeon’s halberd glows and Stallion charged, holy sword in hand.\n“You filthy beast, your presence will not be tolerated by the Lionheart King!”\nLeon’s sword glowed, light layered all around it, just as it had earlier when he poured holy water into it to activate it.\n[Mere mortals…!]\nGokrok’s right arm slammed down toward Leon.\nThe massive mass is a force in itself and Ha-ri and the Hunters were stunned by the sight of the twenty-meter right arm slamming into Stallion and Leon.\n“Your Majesty?!”\nBut Leon charged on, unperturbed, his sword glowed with a brilliant light.\nThe Holy Sword given to the first knight by the God of Light and Justice, this sword possesses another power besides indestructibility.\nThe Holy Sword of Brilliance: a symbol of unquenchable splendor that can cut through anything in the world.\n[What!?]\nPanic flashes through Gokrok’s voice but it was understandable since a mortal, albeit a strong one, cut off his arm.\nHoly Knight’s trait: their holy swords are written with holy law. The power of the concept to deliver a true blow to the person you cut.\nEven if you’re strong, if you’re slashed by this sword, your body will take a hit as well.\n[Kaaaahhh…!]\n“Go, Lord Gokrok?!”\nThe god screamed in pain and the orc shaman panicked.\n[Aaah, you…! Yes… it was you… Orc Butcher… Demon Slayer…!]\nGokrok recognized his opponent’s identity by the damage to his body.\nHe was a knight from another dimension than his own, but one so infamous that demons feared him.\nA demigod of that nightmarish world where the highest ranking demons under the evil god of wisdom and inquiry were said to have died in droves.\n[I will retreat for now…but you will pay the price for this rampage]\nWith those words, Gokrok ended his summoning and returned to his own dimension. The orc shaman was dumbfounded as the alter ego of the god he had paid thousands of orc souls to summon vanished.\n“Go, Gokrok. Gokrok!”\nLeon stepped up to the shaman, who shivered at the shadows that shrouded him.\n“So much for the god of your trash beasts.”\n“Eh, ino-oh…!”\nThe shaman didn’t finish his sentence as Leon’s holy sword had decapitated him.\nThe orc shaman’s head rolled back, and Leon stared down at it in disdain.\n“Hmph, beasts like you should not exist.”\n[You have completed all hidden quests]\n-All participants are granted the Talent ‘Orc Hunter’.\n-All participants will receive the Talent ‘Man-At-Arms of the War Knight’\nHunters cried out when they saw that they received Talents as rewards since by nature, Talents are rare rewards for Hunters.\nThe theory was that talents were earned through specific actions or repetitive behaviors, but to have two rewards like this?\n[Orc Hunter]\n-Gain 30% more damage when dealing with Orcs.\n[Man-At-Arms of the War Knight]\n-Gain 20% physical resistance when fighting alongside a knight with the War Knight talent.\nThe stats aren’t great – one is Orc-specific, which is a bummer, but it’s a whopping 30% bonus damage, and Man at Arms of the War Knight grants 20% Physical Resistance.\nVirtually all of the Hunters had physical resistances that only tank Hunters would have.\n“Fuck…this is awesome.”\nAs Koo Dae-sung and the other Hunters stood dumbfounded by the Hidden Quest rewards, Leon exclaimed.\n“We’re collecting the loot! Hurry up and move!”\nThe Hunters jumped to their feet. Yes, there was loot left.\nOver four thousand orcs had been killed and even if the gate where the orcs appear is terrible, 4,000 of them is a lot of loot.\nAs long as the dungeon closing conditions were fulfilled, they had to scrape up the loot from the gate as soon as possible.\n“Hurry up! Focus on the Warrior class and higher, we need to get all the Shaman’s equipment!”\n“Ugh… If these bastards died nicely, the Heart of the Warrior would be a great item…….”\n“Would a radioactive heart be okay?”\n“I don’t know, if we ate the blessed rice, we won’t have to worry about radiation, let’s get them out!”\nThe hunters scattered in all directions of the meadow with greedy eyes.\n-Ugh!\nUnlike them, Ha-ri and Yappy stayed behind since Ha-ri was not greedy for items, and Yappy’s attention was elsewhere.\n“I, Your Majesty… what should I do with this?”\nHa-ri pointed to a giant severed arm. It was the severed arm of the Orc Shaman God Gokrok that was left behind when Gokrok closed the dimensional gate.",

      "content": "Chapter 33: The Good Orc (4)\nThe results of slaughtering over 4,000 orcs were staggering.\nThe average D-rank Hunters easily killed dozens of Orcs that would normally be too much for them to handle one-on-one, and they scavenged for supplies.\n“Wow… Mr. Gu, look at this. There are over five hundred axes in this camp alone.”\nTeam Leader Kim Do-han, who had been mining the resources inside the gate, and Team Leader Koo Dae-sung, who had only been a porter at the green gates, were mesmerized by the loot in front of them.\n“This is amazing…”\nWith more than four thousand orcs, the supplies were enormous.\nFrom weapons to alcohol to meat to orc boars, but as is often the case with orc gates, only weapons and certain items are useful.\n“Elemental weapons! We need to find an elemental weapon!”\nThe orcs’ weapons were sometimes imbued with spirit beasts.\nThese were weapons that could only be imbued with the help of an orc shaman, and could only be wielded by at least a mid-level warrior.\nMost of them use spirits to lighten their movements, such as the Wolf Spirit, or to harden their bodies, such as the Rock Spirit, so the drops couldn’t be better for low-rank hunters.\n“But how do we recognize a spirit weapon? I’ve never been inside an orc gate!”\nTeam Leader Kim Do-han, who only mined, couldn’t tell the difference between spirit weapons but Koo Dae-sung said.\n“The orcs put a tooth or a piece of the corresponding spirit on the spirit weapon as an ornament, you just have to look for something like that.”\n“You know your stuff, Mr. Koo!”\nFifty hunters circled the field of death but the gate was so large that they had plenty of time before it closed.\n“Hahahaha, Mr. Koo, look at this, twenty spirit weapons, twenty!”\n“Seven Orc Shaman Staffs…Five Warrior Hearts.”\nThe Orc Shaman’s Staff was a favorite of Elementalists, and the Great Warrior’s Heart was used to make powerful Permanent Enhancers.\nIf a Rank D Hunter ingested an enhancer made from the Heart of the Warrior, it would instantly boost their physical abilities to rank C.\nThe effect was so powerful that it was the standard training route for all high-level Hunters to consume one.\n‘Should I…steal one?’\nHe wasn’t that greedy but the enhancer was worth at least 400 million won.\nWhen will I ever be able to get something like this when I’m just a porter at the Green Gates, let alone the Orc Gates?\n“Hmph…”\nKoo Dae-sung put the Heart of the Great Warrior down in the storage box. He wanted to be strong, but he also wanted a clear conscience.\n“Kaaaak…!”\nA piercing scream rang out, and all eyes turned towards it.\n“What are you doing, you damn robot!”\nThere was a Hunter tussling with the Yakt Spinner.\n* * * *\n[Gokrok’s severed right arm]\nThe remnants of Gokrok’s dismembered body were still there but the question was what to do with it.\n-Bam!\nIt was then that Yappy’s voice came from above Ha-ri’s head, drawing her attention.\n“You have a message, Lord Spinner.”\n-Message. Delivered. Heto.\nIt was Heto, the god of iron and blacksmithing, trying to deliver a message through his knight.\nYappy immediately brought up a holographic image of Heto in his likeness and delivered his words in real time.\n[I sense a great deal of magic in the severed beast’s arm, Lionheart. If you absorb it through the Grail, we will channel it and give it to you to help you]\n“Is that so?”\nLeon said no more, and took out the Grail from his storage. He absorbed Gokrok’s arm into the Grail, just as he had done when he destroyed the Orb of Wisdom.\n“Tch.”\nEven though Gokrok’s arm was effectively absorbed, Leon kicked his tongue. In his mind, this was a power similar to holy power.\n“The beasts’ worship must be quite sweet.”\nGokrok was the Orc Shaman God. Though he had to admit that he was a type of god, Leon had no intention of recognizing him as one.\nThe gods of demons and green beasts are not gods, they are absolute evil, unworthy of worship, that must be extinguished.\nTherefore, Leon does not recognize them as gods, even if they are. The only gods he recognizes are those who show love to their subjects.\nIt was then that Leon heard Arianna’s voice in his ear.\n[Lionheart, my knight]\n“……Goddess. What is wrong with you?”\nHe hadn’t even performed the ritual, but the goddess herself had spoken to him. Leon reminded himself that he was not in the fullness of his holy power as he had been in the past.\n[It’s okay, my knight, I’ve absorbed the magic of that foul beast, so this should be easy]\n“Is that so?”\n[I have come to you, my knight, because you must make a choice]\nLeon nodded.\n[This power is not unlike concentrated divine power, so I believe it can be used to restore the power of the holy object you desire].\n“Is that true?”\nLeon has four holy objects.\nThe first is the Lionheart, the most powerful heart, forged from the holy power passed down to the Lionheart kings.\nThe wielder of this heart strengthens countless soldiers with his mere presence and grants himself infinite vitality.\nSecond was the Holy Sword that has the same indestructibility as the holy swords commonly possessed by Holy Knights. This means it can never be broken.\nThen there’s Brilliance, the sword that can cut through anything but it’s not something Leon will be able to maintain for long.\nThe final power of the Holy Sword is too powerful. If he could regain that power…….\n“The Holy Sword is on hold.”\n[Yes, it’s not time to regain its power yet, it consumes too much energy]\nThe final power of the Holy Sword is the most powerful power Leon has ever possessed but it consumes a lot of energy. For now, since he has no immediate followers, he has chosen the Holy Grail.\nThe two remaining holy relics are the Holy Spear and the Holy Grail. Leon hesitated for a moment, then made his choice.\n“I will restore the function of the Holy Grail.”\n[Yes, I will honor my knight’s choice]\nArianna understood Leon’s intentions and breathed life into the Holy Grail. Gokrok’s arm, which had been transmuted by the gods of the pantheon, restored the Holy Grail power.\nThe Holy Grail, once a ceremonial object, now glows brightly. Its golden color is restored to its former glory.\n“Aaah….”\nLeon couldn’t hide his excitement at the sight.\nAfter the Great War two hundred years ago, when all humans but himself died, the Grail lost its light.\nHe couldn’t help but feel sorry for the Holy Grail as it lost its shine. Still, it was the Grail that had quenched his thirst from the endless battles.\nThough not all of its functions were restored, Leon was able to generate holy water from the Grail.\nIt was no different than before, but as the Grail’s guardian, he knew that this holy water had different powers than before.\n“It’s done. This is a great harvest.”\nLeon turned to Ha-ri and Yappy to tell them to gather the loot and prepare to return, but Yappy was nowhere to be seen above Ha-ri’s head.\n“Where did Lord Spinner go?”\n“Uh, yeah, when did he disappear?”\nIt was then that a piercing scream came from the loot area.\n“What are you doing, you damn robot!”\nThere, a Hunter confronted a Yappy.\n“What’s going on?”\n“Ugh… this, this damn robot attacked me….”\n“Insulting a Holy Knight, watch your language unless you want to get your tongue cut out.”\nThe Hunters were stunned, but that was to be expected from Leon.\nHow could a lowly commoner disrespect a knight…a Holy Knight, chosen by God?\n“Sir Spinner is a Grail Knight, directly under this king. You will treat him as you would treat this king himself.”\n“What, what robot…….”\n“Shut your mouth. How dare a lowly creature address this king?”\nLeon ignored the Hunter, who was bleeding from a slashed wrist, and walked over to Yappy.\n“What’s going on, Sir Spinner.”\n-Loot. Thief.\nThe Hunter denied with a flushed complexion at Yappy mechanical voice.\n“Oh, no, you fool… no, it’s a misunderstanding!”\n“I’ll know if it’s a misunderstanding or not when I’m done looking. Han Ha-ri!”\nLeon instructed Ha-ri.\n“Search him.”\n“Ah, old man!”\n“What, what are you doing, you’re taking a robot’s word for it…Now, wait!”\nA pouch fell from the struggling man’s arms. It was a crude, blood-stained cloth pouch and inside, Ha-ri found a large heart.\n“This, this…….”\nWhat the man had stolen was the most valuable loot in Orc’s Gate, the heart of an orc warrior\n“This is…a misunderstanding. I, I would never…….”\nIt was the moment. Leon’s sword flashed, and the man’s wrist went flying into the air.\n“Huh?”\nFor a moment, the man stared blankly at his missing wrist. Then, as he realized what had happened, a wave of pain washed over him.\n“Aaahhhhhhhhhh, my, my arm…!”\nThe Hunters’ attention was focused and all but Yappy had pale faces as Leon spoke calmly.\n“I recognize that your laws and common sense are different from my own but you have entered the gates of the Lionhearted King, and that means you must obey my military laws, not yours.”\nThe thief got his wrists slit. That is the sovereign law of the Lionheart Kingdom, a military code where obedience to the knight is more important than life.\n“This is the law of the land and the military code, and those who cannot obey it must die here and now!”\nThe Hunters hesitated at Leon’s declaration.\nThis powerful otherworldly survivor is out of their league and many of his laws and regulations were unacceptable to modern Earthlings but aside from that…\n-All those buffs…….\nThey felt like they went from a D-class to a C-class Hunter…no, more than that.\n-Wasn’t it wrong to steal the heart of an Orc Warrior in the first place?\n-Damn, I don’t know. I’m going to die like this anyway.\nThe Hunters hesitated, but eventually decided to accept Leon’s reasoning.\nSince the Cataclysm, this world had been the world of the top Hunters, and stealing from the Gate was often met with death.\nHow would anyone on Earth recognize a man who had stolen from the Gate anyway? In the Gate, where betrayal and thievery were commonplace, you could get away with anything.\nIn fact, they were even convinced, as Leon had said, that it might be better to have proper military law and discipline.\n“…Your Majesty.”\nThen, cautiously, a man stepped forward.\n“State your name, soldier.”\nLeon knew who he was, but he demanded a name. The point was to make a claim in front of everyone.\n“I am Koo, Koo Dae-Sung.”\n“Why have you stepped forward, Koo Dae-Sung?”\n“Can’t you at least let me take the thief’s… arm?”\n“Are you going to reattach it?”\n“……Yes.”\nModern medicine has come a long way since the Cataclysm, especially to the point where severed limbs could be reattached with a little haste.\n“But there is no point in doing so. Your words dwarf the Lionheart’s punishment.”\n“Ah, I realize that. But…….”\nKoo Dae-Sung looked at Hunter, whose wrists had been cut off, and made a bitter face.\nHe was an old D-rank Hunter like himself, and it was understandable why he would steal the heart of an Orc Warrior. Above all… he had a family to be responsible for.\n“Your Majesty… we were raised differently than you, with different common sense. Your discipline was unknown to us, and now that you have made it known… we ask that you give us a chance.”\nIn short, he said, they couldn’t abide by a military code they didn’t understand, and the price for stealing was too high.\n“You have a point.”\n“I apologize.”\n“By nature, a soldier cannot answer to a knight, but there are rules and laws on this planet.”\nLeon conjured holy water and, holding the severed arm, spoke to the tearful thief.\n“Be thankful that you have a man of reason among your comrades.”\nHe poured the holy water and then something amazing happened as an arm sprang up from the thief’s severed section and regenerated!\n“It’s healed?”\n“What the…!”\nIt was amazing to see a cut arm grow back.\nOf course, there were healers in charge of recovery. But even they could only reattach a severed arm.\nEven S-class hunters, the best healers in the country, could heal it quickly, but they couldn’t do rapid regeneration, where cells grow from nothing.\n‘Crazy… That kind of power, and a recovery that surpasses that of an S-class healer?’\n‘What the hell is that guy, is that the strength of a single person?’\nThe Hunters, and even the Hunter whose arm was cut off, were dumbfounded by this miracle. Instead, the Hunter who experienced the miracle firsthand fell to his knees and begged for forgiveness.\n“I’m sorry, I was wrong, thank you, thank you!”\n“Hmm. Out of respect for the laws of your world, I forgive you this time, but you have lost your right to enter the gates of this king.”\n“Argh…….”\nHe regretted his momentary greed but Leon turned to the soldiers behind him and declared.\n“Those who wish to enter this king’s gates shall remain, and those who do not, divide the spoils and leave.”\nNo one chose to leave. How could they, having witnessed his overwhelming strength and miracles throughout the battle?\nLeon sensed the longing and expectation in their eyes and was satisfied.\nOne out of fifty, but that’s not bad.\n“Good. Then we’ll get straight to training. I trust that you will not fail to survive even this training.\nThis was an opportunity and they would do it unconditionally but it would not be until three days later that the Hunters would tearfully regret their choice.",

      "content": "Chapter 34: Army Training Manual\nLeon intended to revive the Holy Knights but he knew that finding Holy Knights in this day and age was no easy task.\nYakt Spinner was a rare exception but more importantly, the Holy Knights needed soldiers to support them.\nIt was for this reason that Leon scraped together a group of low-level Hunters, including the old Dae-sung.\nThey would be armed with spears and shields and become an iron wall of support for the Knights.\n“I wouldn’t say they’re underwhelming, but they’re just okay.”\n“Well, they’re hunters, so they have good basic physical strength, right?”\nHa-ri didn’t know what Leon’s world was like but generally speaking, Hunters, despite their low rank, were extremely talented soldiers.\n“Hmm. Look at them. They’ve just dealt with four thousand orcs that were all dying, and they look so tired and exhausted.”\n“What?”\nHa-ri didn’t immediately understand what Leon was talking about. Even if most of them had been irradiated to death, there were still over a thousand orcs left.\nEven if they were sick orcs, shouldn’t they be exhausted from running around trying to catch them?\n“I don’t want to give regular warriors the rank of knight. However, they are superhumans in their own world.”\n“They are…aren’t they?”\n“Then they should be at least on the level of this king Endbringers. I don’t want them to be Elderric Master Guards or Rohana’s Divine Watchers. But even with the protection of Lionheart, they’re not even on par with the Baltaric Orc Crushers.”\n“……Your Majesty, I have no idea what you’re talking about.”\nLeon realized he had said something Ha-ri would not understand. But even so, he couldn’t help but compare the Hunters with the soldiers he had shared honor with.\n“To put it simply, the Baltaric Orc Crushers could take on five orcs alone, ten if the War Knights were present and with this king, they could slaughter thirty.”\n“……That’s not a knight?”\nOrcs are the most difficult and powerful monsters in the Gate, aside from the medium and large monsters. A high-level warrior can take on even a B-ranked Hunter one-on-one.\nThey could slaughter thirty of them, and they’re not a knight? Even Ha-ri couldn’t handle thirty orcs by herself.\n“What kind of existence is a knight in Your Majesty’s world?”\n“I’d say you’re about the level of a squire.”\nHa-ri was stunned. Even though she was young, she, the youngest A-rank hunter, was only at the level of a squire?\nThere were only three Knight Ranks in Leon’s system right now: Squire, Apprentice Knight…and Holy Knight.\nHa-ri realized that Leon’s standards were vastly higher than even the Hunters of modern Earth.\n‘If Lord Yappy is a Holy Knight…are you saying that all Holy Knights are above S-class Hunters?!’\nIf Leon’s Holy Knights were to revive in the modern era… wouldn’t that be a cataclysmic event that would upset the balance of military power in the world?\n“For now, we should at least raise their level to that of professional soldiers.”\n“Uh, how will you… do that?”\nWhat is the training method of King Lionheart? Would they be able to undergo such training?\nAt Ha-ri’s expectant gaze, Leon said nonchalantly.\n“Physical training.”\n* * * *\nKoo Dae-sung, team leader Kim Do-han, and 49 other Hunters gathered at a makeshift training center in the Naju Plains.\n“Wow, they paid so much for the training?”\n“That’s right, we don’t have to worry about making ends meet for a while.”\nEven when they were told to train, they couldn’t help but come back, because they felt the same exhilaration they felt at the Orc Gate and actually felt stronger.\nAll the buffs of Lionheart and of Orc Butcher, plus, they got the Orc Hunter talent and the War Knight’s Man-At-Arms talent, so they can’t help it.\nThe Orc Hunter buff was only available when fighting orcs, and the War Knight’s Man-At-Arms buff was only available when fighting with Leon.\nBesides, it would be better for their future if they were paid to come here for training than to be a porter at the gate.\n“By the way, Mr. Koo, what’s wrong with your face and your lips?”\nAs Team Leader Kim Do-han said, Koo Dae-sung’s face was all over the place.\n“Did you…participate in a gate raid?”\n“Yes…my body was tired, so I went to the blue gate…….”\nAfter the battle at the yellow gate with Leon, Koo Dae-Sung felt an unknown sense of exaltation and omnipotence.\nHe wondered if he had really gotten stronger and if he could fight better than usual, so he joined the blue gate raid as a party member.\nIt was a goblin hunt, but he wasn’t as strong or fast as he had been at the Orc Gate, and he returned home battered by the goblins’ crude clubs.\n“You’re going to hurt yourself, boy, you need to tone it down.”\n“Yes…….”\nHa-ri shouted as loudly as she could as she entered the hall.\n“His Majesty Leon Dragonia Lionheart and his Holy Knight, Sir Yakt Spinner, please enter!”\nAt those words, everyone stopped dead in their tracks and at Leon’s mere appearance, they stopped as if they were a single unit.\n“Congratulations on passing the simple test. You’re not quite good enough to enter the gates of this king, but that’s something we can work on.”\nThe Orc Gate was a simple test?\nThey’ve cleared the Orc Gate, a yellow-rank gate, even as low-rank hunters.\nIf it wasn’t for Leon, who couldn’t tolerate the very existence of orcs, turning the entire group of over four thousand orcs against them, they wouldn’t have killed so many orcs to receive the talent ‘Orc Hunter’.\n“As I watched you fight, I saw a number of problems but the most important was your bodies.”\nThe Hunters didn’t take too kindly to that and rightly so since hunters vary tremendously in physicality depending on their rank.\nRight now, a C-rank Hunter is stronger than three D-rank Hunters and the difference grows exponentially with each rank.\n‘It would be possible for Han Ha-ri to kill all of us by herself…….’\nHan Ha-ri, the youngest A-rank Hunter in the country, could kill all the Hunters in this room with her physical strength alone and with her unique skill, Blessing of Fire, the difference would only increase.\n“We’ve decided to start with your training. From now on, you will be thoroughly trained according to the Lionheart Kingdom Army Training Manual.”\n-Regular military training?\n-Medieval military training?\n-Well, it shouldn’t be that hard.\nThey were hunters and whether they were working as porters in the field or training to become advanced hunters, it’s not a profession that lacks discipline.\nBut their limits were clear: they could never fly, and they could only remain low-rank hunters.\nThey didn’t think a little training from the Lionheart King of a medieval fantasy kingdom was going to change that.\n“Hmph, so much distrust. But I understand. Unlike my subjects, you are ignorant.”\nKoo Dae-Sung raised his hand cautiously, Leon saw it and authorized him to speak.\n“Your Majesty…how do you propose to…train us?”\n“I think you need to train your body.”\n“Uhm…something like muscle training?”\n“What is the principle of muscle training?”\nKoo Dae-sung thought for a moment before answering.\n“The organs of the body…have something called a repair mechanism. When muscles break down and regenerate, they become stronger and bigger.”\n“Right. Overloading the body and stretching its limits. Everything in the world grows that way.”\nIt was the most basic methodology of training. Activate the muscles and overload them again and again as they go through periods of regeneration and rest.\n“Sir Gratas the Holy Knight Giant Slayer, the creator of the army training manual, once said, ‘The more you beat a man, the stronger and harder he becomes.’ That’s a great quote.”\n“What?”\nPeople aren’t railroads, so how can they get harder by being beaten?\n“Then how should the professional soldiers who defend the kingdom be trained? Obviously, they must be trained differently than peasants, and Lord Gratas has come up with the following suggestions for the most efficient training!”\nLeon’s cheerful voice filled the Hunters with anxiety.\n“We will tear them apart, pound them, and rebuild them. Not only will their torn and regenerated muscles be stronger, but they’ll also have increased strength to take more hits.”\n“……?”\n“What?”\nKoo Dae-sung and the other Hunters stared at Leon in disbelief.\n“From now on, pound each other like you’re going to kill each other, until every muscle in your body is torn and your fists are shredded!”\nIt would be better if they broke to the bone. No, break them intensively!\n“Oh, no, no, no, that’s not quite right!”\nIn fact, human bones and muscles get stronger and thicker the more they are broken. Martial artists don’t train their fists by pounding on steel plates for nothing.\n“If we do that, we’ll hurt ourselves first!”\n“Why would it hurt?”\nIt was a question Leon didn’t have the energy to answer. Why would a person get sick? Because the body has a limit, an upper limit.\n“Ordinarily, the protection of a War Knight would suffice, but count yourselves lucky to have before you the Guardian of the Grail.”\nLeon held out the Holy Grail as the cold, golden grail emanates a radiance that can move one with its mere presence. And the fully functional Grail was more than just a glowing golden goblet.\n“Eh? Mr. Koo, you.”\n“Yes? Huh?”\nTeam Leader Kim Do-han looked at Koo Dae-sung in surprise, as his bruised face had suddenly recovered and become clearer.\n‘That cup?’\nKoo’s guess was spot on.\n“All warriors will recover in the place where the Holy Grail is placed. Even if they didn’t drink the holy water directly, their bones would be healed and their torn muscles would regenerate. Fatigue will also be moderately restored.”\nThe Hunters were stunned since this recovery ability alone made the Holy Grail at least a Unique Grade treasure.\n“Five hours starting now beat up everyone in sight. You must be completely alone, facing attacks from all sides and in all directions, and beat down the opponent in front of you.”\nHit and be hit. There is no winning or losing.\n“As long as the Holy Grail is present, you will continue to recover. If… after five hours, any of you are still standing, I will beat you myself.”\nIn a nutshell, beat each other until you outpace the Holy Grail’s recovery.\nGet hit, beaten, hurt, and broken since you will recover anyway.\n‘He’s crazy! He’s crazy!’\n‘We’re actually training in this ignorant way?’\nThe Hunters stared at each other awkwardly then as they remained motionless for a moment, Yappy swung a wire.\n-Karang!\nAn eerie sound rang out, like the crack of an overseer’s whip to speed up the slaves building a pyramid.\n“Die, die, die!”\n“Die!”\nThe Hunters tangled with each other and swung their fists as five hellish hours of hitting, pounding, and breaking had begun.\nAt first, Koo Dae-sung dodged the attacks as best he could, pounding away at the man in front of him but there were 49 people in the ring. There was no escape, and it was less than ideal to just blindly pummel his opponent.\n“Aaaaah!”\nHe grunted and was about to swing his fist when he realized that the person in front of him was familiar.\n“Koo, Mr. Koo, it’s me! It’s me!”\n“Ki, Team Leader Kim?”\n“Wu, we don’t have to beat each other up, let’s join forces!”\n“Ha, but…….”\nThat was when a sharp noise pierced their ears as a ‘live bullet’ that was precisely calculated threatened only the two of them.\n-Crack.\nThere, above the head of Ha-ri, who was making a sad face at the mess, was Yappy, glowing with an emotionless red glow, pointing a minimalist-sized machine gun at them.\n“What the hell…!”\nFeeling threatened, Koo Dae-sung swung his fist at Team Leader Kim in front of him and as Team Leader Kim fell backwards, Koo Dae-sung screamed.\n“This is crazy, this is crazy, this is crazy, this is crazy!”\nBut his screams were short-lived as they were drowned out by hunters from all directions.\nIt was past noon and the five hellish hours were over.\n“Alright, that’s enough! It’s time to eat!”\nLeon clapped his hands and the Hunters collapsed to the ground, bloodied and swollen, but thanks to the Holy Grail’s regenerative powers, didn’t have a single broken bone. Or, more accurately, the broken bones were reattached and they were able to fight again.\n“Ugh…I really thought I was going to die.”\n“I’ve never heard of such an ignorant training method.”\nNo matter how hard they beat each other, the Hunters felt no pain. All they felt was an unquenchable hunger and thirst.\n“I’m hungry.”\n“We need to eat something.”\n“I heard that the blessed rice here is so famous…Are we going to have it?”\nEveryone was looking forward to the hottest “blessed rice” in the Naju Plain since it was a rare item that is said to cure cancer, make you healthier, and increase your ‘physical resilience’ just by eating it.\nIt had recently become a YouTube sensation, and the Association had announced its benefits. But what they found was food they had never imagined.\n“…….”\n“…….”\nThe Hunters scratched their heads at the ‘lunch’ in front of them, as they didn’t understand what the intention behind it was.\n“Uh… Ms. Ha-ri, what is this?”\nAt the questioning stares, Ha-ri gave a guilty look, but Leon remained calm.\n“Water.”\n“No, that’s not… I know.”\n“It’s water with salt and sugar.”\n“Oh… I see.”\nThe Hunters looked like they were about to say something, but when they caught Leon’s mischievous gaze, they lowered their eyes.\n“What is it?”\n“I feel like my common sense is being denied.”\n“After all we’ve been through, our only meal is water with salt and sugar?”\nWas this some kind of big deal that they didn’t understand?\nYappy approaches the bewildered Hunters with his robotic arm holding a salt shaker.\n-Salt. Who needs more?\nLord Gratas the Giant Slayer army training manual rule zero: You only need to feed a trainee enough to keep him from dying.\nProper feeding is something that starts with the regular army.",

      "content": "Chapter 35: They say the military is well fed these days\nHa-ri felt a pang of pity for the Hunters as he watched them go through the grueling rigors of training.\n“Is it really okay to train like that?”\n-In theory.\nWell, in theory, yes, but how can anyone do anything but theoretically? Leon acknowledged its limitations.\n“Yes, there are limitations. But at the soldier level, they’ll grow enough.”\nLeon was assuming that their growth threshold would be less than that of his soldiers.\nThis is not to say that the specifications themselves are unreachable. The current Hunters could reach the level of a royal soldier or first-army elite soldier if they weren’t knights.\n‘But the difference in experience is too great.’\nRoyal soldiers were professional warriors who have fought in countless wars throughout the kingdom. They are capable of tactical action in groups of ten or twelve without a commander’s orders.\nIn a war against 800,000 orcs, the battlefield had become too wide, and the royal soldiers were left to their own devices to defend ridges and reinforce key positions.\nIt would be unreasonable to expect them to be as good as the elite troops who have been on the battlefield for thirty years, if not fifty.\n“Real skill can only be developed through experience. The burden will push their bodies to their limits.”\nIn the first place, there was no need to be so harsh at the regular army level.\n“If they were this king people, their bodies would already be perfect. They would have always been nourished by crops and an environment blessed by the gods.”\nBut not these people, who did not know that God existed. They lived sickly lives and were vulnerable to all manner of diseases.\n“Unlike this king healthy subjects, they need to be stimulated and enlightened.”\n“I see.”\nEven though it seemed like nothing more than an ignorant medieval training method, Ha-ri forced herself to understand.\n“Your Majesty, do I have to train?”\nHa-ri asked cautiously.\nShe was technically a seconded employee of the Association, but apart from that, she was the Earthling who had been with Leon the longest.\nShe was an A-rank Hunter herself, but the desire to be strong was common among Hunters.\n“Do you want to be in there?”\n“Uhm…I don’t think so.”\nIt wasn’t that she didn’t want to. It was just the level of difference.\n“Well, okay. To you, they’re like little kids.”\n“Mmm…not quite.”\n“Humility is arrogance at that point. Just as a soldier and a knight are different, so are their training methods. You don’t need to be trained in the same ignorant manner as a soldier.”\nSo much for recognizing ignorance!\nHa-ri found it curious that this barbaric medieval knight-king could be so sharply self-objectifying at times.\n“It’s almost time for me to leave, so let’s go prepare the meal.”\n“Ah, yes, that’s right, they’ve been training hard so they deserve a good meal!”\nHa-ri realized that the Hunters had been training hard and needed to be fed. Surely, Leon would have taken care of that. But when Ha-ri saw the meal prepared for the soldiers, she was shocked.\n“That…Your Majesty? This. Is that water?”\nIt was water. Something had been added to it, but was it some kind of special medicine?\n“What is this white stuff, is it something blessed that your Majesty has prepared?”\n“It is salt.”\n“……Is that all there is?”\n“There is also sugar.”\nStrange….That couldn’t be it. There had to be more.\n“Ha-ri, do you know what is important to soldiers?”\n“To be well fed and well trained?”\nShe quickly pointed out both those things were currently in shambles at the moment.\n“Huh, in wartime, maybe, but the most important thing for a soldier is ‘poison’.”\n“Poison?”\n“A happy soldier doesn’t kill as easily while an undernourished and pissed off soldier is a dangerous combination.”\nSo the soldiers are given only the bare minimum to build up their ‘poison.’\nHa-ri paled.\n“Well, the army is well fed these days!”\n“Don’t speak about what you don’t know. Have you ever led an army like this king?”\n“……No.”\n“Then how can you say that this king methods are wrong?”\n“Well, that’s…….”\nI tried it, and it worked. Have you tried it?\nHa-ri was speechless.\n-Your Majesty. Recommendation.\nOh, Lord Yappy, you’re trying to make objective points with the cold mathematical knowledge of a machine again!\n‘Lord Yappy! Everyone’s survival depends on your calculations!’\nCome on, Lord Yappy!\n“Speak, Lord Spinner, this king is listening.”\n-Excess of 17 mg sodium and 112 calories over the minimum human requirement for sustaining vital activity. Recommendation that rations be reduced accordingly.\nDemons! Demons!\nThe man’s whose method of training soldiers was evil and based on experience, and a cold machine, without a shred of warmth, have formed a maddening collaboration!\n* * * *\nTorture in the name of training, which resumed after supper, was canceled due to the arrival of the rain.\nThe Hunters were crammed into a village hall in the name of improving camaraderie and they stretched out like rainwater.\n“Ugh…After all that hard work, all I got was two cups of sugar water…….”\n“Ugh, my body is sore. It hurts…….”\nThe first training session alone was enough to kill them. But strangely, they felt fine.\n‘I’m really healed.’\nKoo Dae-sung was amazed that his torn skin and broken bones were still intact.\n‘I can’t really feel it yet, but it’s almost like my bones have actually hardened.’\nThe healing power of the Holy Grail was incredible. It gave them the healing of a decent healer for hours on end.\nWhat’s even more ridiculous is that it’s an AoE (Area of Effect) heal.\nWhile normal healers heal one by one person and have a limited amount of mana, Leon’s Holy Grail not only heals all allies in range, but it lasts for at least five hours.\nIt was a different kind of resilience.\n“Ugh…I’m still hungry.”\nThe Hunters were exhausted from their intense training. But all they were given at mealtime were two glasses of water with sugar and salt.\nThe calories weren’t a problem, as the water was loaded with enough sugar.\nAside from the nutrients, it’s the minimum life support a person needs to live. But apart from that, the meals were very inadequate. No one can be satisfied with that after training so hard.\nHuddled together like an army’s internal affairs squad, with only one blanket over their heads, they are buried in the pouring rain.\n“Damn, do we have to drink rainwater?”\n“I’m hungry…….”\nIt was eleven o`clock, the time to go to sleep and none of them could fall asleep but then they heard a knock on the door.\n“Is anyone…there?”\n“Miss Ha-ri?”\nHa-ri peeked out and asked for permission.\n“May I come in?”\n“Oh, yes! What can I do for you?”\n“It’s nothing… I thought you might be hungry, so I cooked up a late night snack.”\nHa-ri’s hands were full of sweet potatoes.\n“We don’t have any cold water…so I bought some bottled water the other day. You’ve all had a hard time, so please have some.”\n‘She’s an angel.’\nKoo Dae-sung and the Hunters were overwhelmed by Ha-ri’s generosity, and they gleefully grab the sweet potatoes and dunk them into the water, unpeeled.\n“Yum, yum, yum, yum, Miss Ha-ri…!”\n“I never knew potatoes were so delicious…!”\n“Eat slowly. There are still plenty of sweet potatoes left.”\nHa-ri felt a pang of pity for the Hunters as they gobbled up the sweet potatoes, looking like beggars.\nYes, people shouldn’t be made to feel sorry for themselves when they still have food to eat.\nHaving lost her parents in a cataclysmic event and grown up in an orphanage, she knew what it was like to be hungry.\n“Drink some water while you eat, it’s a hot day and you need to stay hydrated──”\n-Kwalung!\nThe door to the hall opened without a knock and the sound of the rain pounding the dirt floor was drowned out by the sound of thunder.\n-Maggots.\nAgainst the backdrop of the pouring rain and lightning, the spider machine’s eyes seem colder than usual.\nEight camera eyes creak and squeak and glow all around like an intruder in a top-secret compound.\n“Sir Yappy…….”\n-Cheating detected.\nThe machine’s voice, unchanged from the usual, sounded heavier and more chilling than usual.\n* * * *\nEight legs traverse the rain-soaked dirt and even the slick ground was no obstacle to the polygonal chariot.\n“Stop!”\nOn the other hand, the pursuing red-haired girl runs desperately along the ground, her eyes filled with tears or raindrops.\n“Now, wait a minute, please listen to me, Yappy!”\nShe’s been caught sneaking sweet potatoes to the hunters.\nAlthough it was an act of compassion and thoughtfulness on her part, she didn’t know how Leon would react to it.\nThe moment she realizes she’s been caught, the thought of the hunters slurping down the sweet potatoes brings tears to her eyes, but that’s after the fact.\nHow harsh would it be to even suggest that they take the sugar out of the sugar water, since they’ve had a late night snack!\nHa-ri is desperate to stop Yappy as he runs to report to Leon.\nLuckily, Yappy’s speed is slower than Ha-ri’s as his strides are shorter, and his power is reduced due to his smaller size.\n“There, almost there!”\nBefore Ha-ri could reach him, Yappy stopped.\n-Request to cease tracking. You are committing a grave offense.\n“Ah, okay! I’ll stop, okay? Just listen to me for a second!”\nYappy stops, and Ha-ri naturally stops too but this was Yappy psychological warfare. It’s a tactic that’s been proven to be very effective against those with a preconceived notion that machines don’t lie.\nYappy slowly closes the distance, then runs again.\n“You cheated?! You tricked me by pretending to negotiate?!”\nHa-ri ran, panting but before she knew it, something strong and hard was tied around her ankle.\n“Wire? Ugh!”\nHa-ri sank to the ground, while Yappy distanced himself but as Ha-ri realized a wire tied to her ankle she snapped her fingers.\n-Boom!\nA flame bursts forth in the harsh rain as her blessing of fire burns away the wire tied to her ankles.\n“Stop…!”\nHa-ri ran again and with only ten percent of his power left, the distance between her and Yappy is closing as Ha-ri throws himself at him.\n“Gotcha!”\nHa-ri throws her whole body and catches Yappy as mud splatters her face and tears her suit, but the joy of securing a meal for the Hunters more than makes up for it.\n-Touchdown.\nBut when she throws herself at Yappy, she lands right in front of Leon’s quarters as the door opens, and inside, Leon stares down Ha-ri coldly.\n“What’s all the fuss about in the middle of the night?”\n“Huh?”\nHa-ri’s mouth twitches like a goldfish but the machine is unfazed and in a cold, measured voice, reports.\n-Cheating detected. More nutrients than needed.\nHa-ri was caught feeding the hunters.\n“You mean to tell me…you couldn’t wait one day to do that?”\n“Oh, no, it’s just that…I’m sorry.”\nHa-ri lowered her head, still feeling guilty, but at least the men should be fed.\n“That’s it. What can I do about it? But you’ll have to be careful next time.”\nWhen Ha-ri gave him a puzzled look, Leon smirked and continued.\n“I’ll make sure to feed them properly when it is time for actual training at the gate. Now go bid on the next gate.”\n“I see!”\nHa-ri realized that for the sake of the Hunters’ human rights, she had to find a suitable gate as soon as possible.\n“Ah, right. Your Majesty…I was actually supposed to report tomorrow.”\n“About what?”\n“As your Majesty requested, the President of the Association will be attending the training ceremony to evaluate the performance of the training.”\n“Hmm, I see.”\nThis was what Leon had requested.\nHe invited them to the graduation ceremony to re-evaluate the trained Hunters’ ratings.\nLeon would take them to the Yellow Gate, where the Hunters who had shown growth would be officially re-evaluated.\nThis was how strong they could become once they entered the Ten Thousand Gods Guild…And it was also a means of recruiting more soldiers.\n“There will be many guests, and King Lionheart’s authority would be compromised if he neglected his visitors, so I must warn the villagers to make preparations.”\n“I’ll pass it on…ahh…….”\nLeon added, looking at Ha-ri, who was a mess from chasing Yappy.\n“Go wash up and make sure you take care of their food in the future. I won’t mind if you use the crops of this land.”\nHa-ri’s complexion brightened at the words.\nShe felt sorry for the hunters, who were forced to eat nothing but salt water, and now could eat sweet potatoes!\nShe didn’t know if this is something to be thankful for, but at least the Hunters won’t have to eat nothing but salt water for four weeks.\n‘Huh… I guess he’s a merciful man after all.’\nHa-ri didn’t know that there were no unilateral pluses or minuses to this inflexible authoritarian.\nIf there was a plus, wouldn’t it have to be countered by a minus?\nLord Gratas, author of the Army Training Manual said that if a soldier cheats, make sure he is screwed.",

      "content": "Chapter 36: You Want Me to Stop This?\nMorning training was over for the new recruits.\n“Off, I think I’m going to die…ahhh…….”\nTrainee no. 33 Park Dae-gil is bleeding all over and feels like he’s going to die. As he goes to eat his lunch of sugar water, he hears an irritated voice behind him.\n“Hurry up.”\n“What the fuck?”\nPark Dae-gil reacted nervously to the insignificant words.\nThe trainees who had been pounding each other like crazy had a lot of bad feelings toward each other. Even if they recovered, they would still swing their fists at each other, and no good feelings would arise.\n“You want to die, asshole!”\n“Try me, motherfucker!”\nAs they’re about to collide, the trainees stiffen as they hear the dull, cold sounds of machinery.\n-Dispute, military offense in effect.\n“Hic…….”\n“Sir Yappy, it’s not that…….”\n-Dispute. Military discipline in effect. Corporal punishment by whipping is considered.\n“Hic!”\nThis was the problem. No matter how much stress the cadets were under, they couldn’t relieve it as long as they had a non-human, mechanical supervisor.\nAnd once a cadet rebelled, no one dared to stand up to Yappy, now that they’d seen what it was like to have their calves whipped.\nJust when they thought they were going to get whipped a savior appeared.\n“Lord Yappy, the king wants you!”\n-Recognition.\nAt Ha-ri’s words, Yappy disappeared before he could carry out the punishment and Ha-ri breathed a sigh of relief.\n“Are you all right, Hunter Park Dae-gil, Hunter Han Jong-hyuk?”\n“Thanks to you.”\n“Ugh…what a bastard.”\nThe hunters’ complaints were naturally directed at Yappy.\nYappy, who has no thoughts and only acts according to the principles that have been thoroughly typed out, was resented by everyone. Whereas…….\n“Man, if it weren’t for our deputy, I don’t know what would have happened.”\n“I thank you every night. Hmph…!”\nHa-ri had been bringing nightly snacks to the Hunters, who were starving on sugar water.\nIf it weren’t for the sweet potatoes she brought, the Hunters would have been finished long ago──\n‘We won’t lose!’\n‘But thanks to Miss Ha-ri, I’m barely thin!’\nHan Ha-ri was an angel who saved them from the tyranny of the unkind and harsh Yappy, and without her, this arduous training would have been even more painful.\nHa-ri smiled awkwardly as she watched the Hunters express their gratitude.\n‘Hmm… I can’t say I’m doing this with the king’s permission.’\nLeon divided the roles of Yappy and Ha-ri, into the good instructor and the bad instructor.\nAppeasement and intimidation along with carrots and sticks was an age-old psychological tactic.\nYappy whips the trainees while Ha-ri gives them carrots. With a harsher instructor, there would have been a lot of complaints, but Ha-ri’s presence kept them in check.\n“Hmm, is the meal ready?”\n“Yes, Your Majesty!!!”\nAfter the sugar and salt meal, Leon began the afternoon drill with his usual pep talk.\n“The water, sugar, and salt you drink comes from the sweat of the peasants. Always eat with gratitude.”\n“Yes! Thank you!!!”\nWhat’s Leon’s role in all this?\nHe’s a division commander in the internal affairs squad.\nPeople freeze in the presence of a higher power and dare not show their displeasure.\n“Rejoice, cadets; the king is pleased that you have eaten well.”\n-Eh?\n-No way…he didn’t catch us eating late at night, did he?\n“Then this king will conduct a special tactical training session for you, so that you can use your strength after eating like pigs!”\n-No.\n-Save me.\nThe hunters were anxious but at the same time they were glad that they wouldn’t have to beat each other up for the afternoon, still, they feel strangely uneasy.\n“Oh, and before that, I’ve prepared a reward to motivate you.”\nAt Leon’s command, Yappy and Ha-ri brought in a red lump and displayed it in front of the trainees, and its identity was easily deduced.\n-Oh, the heart of an orc warrior!\n-That’s what they’re giving away as a prize?\nThis Orc Warrior’s Heart is an item from a powerful monster and a unique enhancer worth hundreds of millions of won that can increase strength and stamina so much that it’s a favorite among low-rank Hunters.\nThere are five of them.\n“We’ll do tactical training in groups of ten. At the graduation ceremony in two weeks, I will select the best one from each group and give them this as a prize.”\n-Ohh!\n-That’s awesome!\nThe morale, which had been chipped away by hellish training and sugar-salt water, instantly soared. As if on cue, Leon shows a satisfied look and begins to speak.\n“Your role on the battlefield is that of an iron wall that must not be broken under any circumstances!”\nTankers, in short.\nThe cadets’ primary weapons were shields and spears or swords.\n“Raise your shields! Form up, and we will have to hold off the charge of this king.”\n“……?”\nThe afternoon drill was in groups of 10.\nOn the vast plains of the harvested Naju Plain, one group huddled together with thick shields while behind them, 40 trainees sat and waited.\n“Fighting in the gate is mostly hand-to-hand, except in unusual cases and the basis of cavalry warfare, without a doubt, is formation fighting.”\nIt was a no-brainer: break down the opponent’s formations and defend your own.\n“All but those with ranged aptitude will be trained with shields. These are what you call tanks these days.”\nAt those words, the trainees murmured and Koo Dae-Sung asked an innocent question.\n“I, Your Majesty…You mean, except for the ranged soldiers, all of us will be tankers?”\n“Yes.”\nThe uproar grew louder at that, and rightly so. Two trainees wielding bows to a group of ten made sense…but the other eight were all tanks.\n“No, if we’re all tanks, who’s going to do the damage?”\n“Archers aren’t going to be enough to deal damage…….”\nKoo Dae-sung was very clear about the Hunter raid system.\nModern Hunter composition is gate-specific.\nYou have a handful of rare tanks running aggro and dealers diligently chipping away at the monster numbers.\nTankers are good for killing mobs, but they’re not much more than a deterrent from the mid-boss onwards.\nObviously, you need a dealer who can deal heavy damage instead of a tank who can’t deal enough.\n‘If you want to be a tank in the first place, you need to have that skill so you can take all the damage from the powerful monsters.’\nHow in the world are low-rank hunters with no unique skills supposed to be tanks?\n“Don’t question it. Your job is to hold off the enemy charge, and that’s all you need to do.”\nNothing else matters. Only to stop it.\n“This king will charge, not at full strength, of course, so brace yourselves.”\nLeon stood upright on his horse, facing ten shield-bearing Hunters.\nThe Hunters had witnessed Stallion’s ridiculous maneuverability and power.\n-It’s that horse.\n-It could decapitate an orc with its hind hooves.\n-It’s not going to do it to us, is it?\nIt was then.\n[Aura of the Lionheart]\n◆Effect\nGrants Legion-Hardened Charge Defense.\nGrants Legion Fortification.\nGrants Legion-strengthened Battalion Reinforcement.\nGrants Legion Strengthened Valor.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Light Armor.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Tough Skin.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Heavy Strike.\nGrants Legion-Enhanced Archaic Empowerment.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Ranged Resistance.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Keen Gaze.\nGrants Legion Improved Anti-Infantry Slaughter.\nGrants Legion-Powered Pollution Resistance.\nThey felt the overwhelming sense of omnipotence at the Orc Gate.\nThe amount of buffs was overwhelming, to the point where they wondered if they were really going to train with all of these buffs.\n“Defend! This king will charge”\nWith this many people defending themselves with shields, what could a single steed do?\n“Let’s go, Stallion.”\nAt Leon’s command, the white horse begins to trot.\nKoo Dae-sung and the other Hunters of the First Hunt braced themselves, arms gripping their shields. And then…Stallion speed increased.\nEven a sports car’s zero-back wouldn’t be this good.\n“What?”\nAt what must have been thirty meters away, the tiny figures of Leon and Stallion filled their vision.\nThe momentum was so frenzied that the Hunters felt like they were facing a dump truck charging at full speed.\n-Bang, bang, bang, bang!\nThe sound of horses’ hooves was deafening, and the vibrations from the ground assaulted their entire bodies.\nThe idea of horses has long since flown out the window for modern people who are used to cars, trains, and airplanes but all the hunters felt one thing.\n‘You want me to stop that?’\n‘This is crazy!’\nEven the valor granted by the Lionheart buff could not compel them to act recklessly.\n“Ugh!”\n“Save me!”\nThe cadet in the forefront threw himself down, followed by the cadet in the second row.\nUnfortunately, Koo Dae-sung, who was keeping his shield upright in the last three rows, didn’t dodge and was hit from the front.\n“Huh?”\nAt the moment of the collision, Koo Dae-sung saw that ‘Assault Defense’, ‘Fortification’, ‘Massive Reinforcement’, ‘Valor’, ‘Lightened Armor’, and ‘Tough Skin’ had been activated simultaneously in the system messages. Nevertheless──\n‘Keen Gaze’ recorded this moment, the moment when his colleagues, who were just next to him, turned into black dots.\nIt was three hours later that Koo Dae-sung, who had fallen under the influence of gravity, opened his eyes.\n“Tsk, tsk, tsk… Even with the protection of the Lionheart, you’re still this weak. How pathetic. Next!”\nThe trainees who had witnessed Koo Dae-sung’s fall were pale.\n-What the hell?\n-A man is flying.\n-You want me to stop that?\n-I don’t want to die yet.\nThat day, not a single one of them stopped Leon’s charge.\n* * * *\nIt’s been a month since the attack on Cheongju Gate.\nReynald Shelman, Master of the United States of America Tower, was still praying to his late master.\n“Great One! Please, whisper to your lowly servant once again!”\nSince the capture of the Cheongju Gate, the voice that had been imparting knowledge from the Wisdom Gem had disappeared.\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart, a survivor of the Cheongju Gate raid in Korea, was the most likely culprit.\nReynald tries to investigate the cause of the disappearance of the voice, but the information is extremely limited.\nShould he retaliate? Would the Voice return if he killed Leon?\nBut even the great one had fled in fear and Leon was said to have overpowered the Yakt Spinner, the killing machine of the Cheongju Gate.\n‘Master when are you coming back, are you really coming back?’\nHow many sacrifices have I made?\nAfter a month of patience, Leonard Shelman became irritated.\n“Damn you, demonic bastards, you’re so damn expensive──”\n-Hiss!\n“Great One! We were counting on your return!”\nReynald, who had made a brilliant posture change, glared at the Wisdom Gem.\n[Shit… I did get it after all…….]\n[Hmph…! Get down on your knees, you fool!]\n“Yay!”\nReynald immediately prostrated himself, not knowing why the voice had changed, but only that the evil aura from the purgatory was powerful.\n[I will teach you the truths and wisdom of Samra, and of course you must honor me and make a worthy offering]\n“Of course, Great One! What shall I prepare? Shall we prepare a living sacrifice? Or shall I make servants of the Hunters at the gate, as I did last time?”\n[No, for the time being, you’ll just have to do what I tell you to do…….]\nSoon, a voice came from the Wisdom Gem.\n[Place a spatial transmission spell on the gem, and shoot it in space in case of emergency]\n“What? What do you mean…….?”\n[Fuck you! Just do as you’re told!]\nReynald did as the orb told him and cast a transmission spell on the box the gem was stored in.\n[Good, you did as you were told]\n“Are you sure about this? I know the orb… is supposed to be a tool for the descent of a great being, but I’d rather open a gate than shoot it in space in an emergency…….”\n[Are you crazy? I’m not going to enter that pit!]\n“What?”\n[Listen to me, I’m never going to stick my head on a planet where that freak is alive and breathing]\n“Who the hell is he…….?”\n[………….]\nThe gem was silent for a moment as if it was recalling some horrible memory.\n[I will find a way to kill him. This is one of the few times when the Holy Knights and his legions are not present, and I must somehow enter the same gate as him!]\n“Ah, I see!”\nReynald listened to the voice from beyond.\nThe knowledge imparted by the Archdemon was astonishingly great, and he marveled once again at the wisdom of the Purgatory.\n[Please die…….]\nHowever, the voice from beyond sounded very unconfident.",

      "content": "Chapter 37: I want to be a knight\nDespite the harsh training regimen, the mornings were surprisingly free.\nThere’s no set wake-up time before the torture known as Project Steelskin…begins at 9am.\nYou’d think they’d be up and about by 9 a.m., but that’s not the case. After the afternoon training and meal break, everyone is exhausted and sleeps in at eight o’clock.\nNaturally, there were many early risers, and Koo Dae-sung was one of them.\n“Whoa… whoa…!”\nKoo Dae-sung picked up his shield in the morning to train his shield technique. He was the only one who trained on his own in the morning.\n“Mr. Koo, your strength is good. Why don’t you take a break?”\n“No.”\nDespite Team Leader Kim Do-han urging, Koo continued to practice his shield technique. To be precise, he practiced using a shield and a sword at the same time.\n‘It’s heavier than I thought. And it’s hard to swing the sword.’\nDuring a drill to stop Leon’s mounted charge, the trainees were allowed to counterattack, so they tried to stop him by swinging their swords.\nEven though they were holding swords and shields as long as they were in formation as he tried to swing with his right hand, the man next to him would be in the way.\nInevitably, in the shield formation, he could only thrust his sword.\n‘I’ve heard that shields are essential in hand-to-hand combat… but will they work against monsters?’\nThe attacking stance on this side is too limited. If that’s the case, he’ll have to hone his stabbing skills to the extreme while holding his shield.\nKoo Dae-Sung had been practicing this very thing himself.\nHe pushed the imaginary enemy away with his shield and stabbed with his sword. During his breaks, Koo Dae-sung would go through the shield sword manuals he found online and try different things. And there was someone watching him.\n“Wrong.”\n“Your Majesty!”\nWhen he saw Leon, Koo Dae-sung straightened up, assuming the posture of a soldier.\n“Finish what you started. Stab the sword again.”\n“Yes, yes…….”\nKoo Dae-sung awkwardly gripped his shield and stabbed his sword. After a few stabs, he heard Leon again.\n“Wrong.”\nLeon stepped in front of Koo Dae-Sung and grabbed his shield.\n“You have a habit of lowering your shield the moment you stab. Do not lower your shield at any time even if you can’t see.”\n“Uh, why?”\nKoo Dae-sung asked for a reason for the advice that other trainees might have taken for granted. And in his experience, Leon is not the kind of teacher to let questions slide.\n“When you’re swinging a sword to protect just you, it’s okay. But I’ve said it many times before. Keep your shield up to the right shoulder of your comrade next to you.”\n“Ah…….”\n“If you lower your shield, the man to your left will have an empty right shoulder, which creates a gap, and a gap breeds a crack.”\nNever assume you are fighting alone. Imagine fighting with your comrades. Teamwork is a basic tenet of modern ganking.\nTanks run the aggro, dealers deal the damage, and backup supports provide the ranged damage. But Leon’s group looks more like a regular army than a gate raiding team.\n“Your Majesty, your tactic… is for shieldmen like us to hold the enemy at bay while the knights charge in and sweep?”\n“Indeed. It is the royal way.”\nThe hammer and anvil tactic was a classic even on Earth.\n“But… my opponents are monsters, and they don’t seem to be the kind of beings that can be dealt with by the standard techniques.”\n“Are you trying to teach this king how to fight beings of a different type?”\n“No, not at all!”\nKnowing full well that this Lionheart King’s mindset was that of a medieval classist, Koo Dae-Sung wore a cautious expression however, Leon’s expression was much gentler.\n“There have been many monsters in the Beast World that you have encountered at the gate.”\nIn fact, the monsters in the gates are rather cute.\nThe Lionheart Kingdom has been dealing with constant foreign enemies around them, and while most of them were orcs, there were also many monsters of all sorts.\n“Giants over 20 meters tall, trolls that regenerate endlessly, snakes with multiple heads, spiders carrying dozens of goblins and a giant dragon that could stamp on mountains like a handle.”\nAll those monsters, all those things that were stronger and bigger than humans, were a challenge for the “soldiers” to deal with.\n“To deal with so many monsters, you have to know a lot of hunting techniques and be able to improvise. It’s a skill that only comes with practice.”\nLeon stared at Koo Dae-Sung. Koo Dae-Sung, the soldier.\n“Do you have decades of training with the Goddess against monsters, or do you have the grace to honor any battlefield with a single sword or spear?”\nKoo Dae-Sung felt his breath caught in his throat. As a high-level Hunter, you’d think they’d have a better survival rate than low-level Hunters, but that’s not the case.\nAnything can happen at the gate.\nYou’ll encounter orcs, witches casting evil spells, and monsters that are too big to handle.\nThe Yakt Spinner at the Cheongju Gate alone was an all-around killing machine that was nothing like the monsters he saw before so high-level Hunters facing such monsters will inevitably have a high mortality rate.\nWhy?\nBecause if you don’t know, you die.\nThe knights, Leon speaks about, are superhumans who, like the high-level hunters, hunt all manner of mutant beasts, never knowing what to expect.\n“That’s why we only teach one thing to our soldiers. Versatility is a virtue required of a knight. You are to hone only one skill to increase your chances of survival.”\nKoo Dae-sung and his shield trainees have only one task, [Block], until the knight kills the enemy.\n“But…….”\nIt’s a noble task, not one to be taken lightly. Nevertheless, Koo Dae-sung wanted more.\n“Do you dream of being a knight?”\n“I, how can I…….”\nKoo Dae-sung interrupted, wondering if Leon, who considered him a commoner, would look down on him like the common fantasy nobility.\n“Don’t judge this king kingdom by the common sense of your world. Being a knight is not just for nobles.”\n“What?”\n“One who willingly walks the path of hardship with a noble mission. One who protects the common people and does good deeds with courage.”\nThose who enforce the Ten Commandments and those who swear an oath to the Goddess and her people.\n“Anyone who makes that sacred covenant is a knight. If you are courageous and worthy of that duty, you are worthy of my respect.”\nIt felt like a hammer to the head.\nAll this time, the cadets had been deeply prejudiced against Leon and thought that as a king from this medieval fantasy he world would be a staunch classist and an authoritarian discriminator.\nHe would treat them only as soldiers and expect nothing but submission and obedience. However Leon was a knight king…and more.\n‘I want to be…….’\nI want to be a knight.\nIt was only because Leon told him that he could be one.\n* * * *\nThe end of the four-week training was near.\nThe conclusion of the training was a crucial moment to decide on the future “supply of trainees” after a demonstration ceremony with the association president and other relevant people.\nIt was an important moment to prove the achievements and continue to second- and third-generation trainees. Eventually, Leon’s plan was to grow the organization to the size of an army and recruit high-level knights.\n“Greetings, Your Majesty.”\n“Welcome.”\nOh Kang-hyuk, chairman of the Association, had traveled to Naju Plain on schedule for the graduation ceremony.\nHe’s joined by a number of his staff, including Chief Kim Jin-soo, who’s here because the gate assault will serve as a “grade test” for the trainees.\n“Your Majesty, I’ve heard the plan, but are you okay with it?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I’ve heard that the gate used for this test is a ‘yellow’ gate.”\nThe average yellow gate has a difficulty level of B. It’s not a difficulty level that the average D-rank trainee can tackle unless, of course, Leon takes matters into his own hands. In fact, he might be able to take down the yellow gate on his own.\nBut that’s not how it should be evaluated. The cadets would have to prove themselves.\n“There’s no problem.”\n“Only if Your Majesty says so…….”\nOh Kang-hyuk was skeptical, but he trusted the otherworldly survivor’s abilities. Still, he couldn’t help but worry.\nUnlike Leon, who was so confident, the trainees were burdened with the responsibility of proving their skills.\nThere were more Association employees than expected at the Ten Thousand Gods Guild’s training completion ceremony…plus members of the Ten Guilds who had heard the rumors.\n“Why are there so many people here?”\nKoo Dae-Sung felt overwhelmed by the crowd, and as a ten year D-rank, this kind of attention was too much for him.\nPeople heard rumors that the Lionheart King was training the low-rank Hunters, and if he didn’t show that he had grown up, he would be the target of ridicule and sneers.\n“Damn… Aren’t we getting screwed?”\nTeam leader Kim Do-han feels the same way since he never received this kind of attention before even though Hunters are the most recognized profession in Korea, but that’s only for high-level hunters.\nThose who simply lead mining teams and collect the byproducts of the hunters’ hunts are nothing more than laborers.\n“I hear the king isn’t even helping this time.”\n“And a Yellow Gate? That’s crazy. Surely it’s not an orc gate like last time?”\n“Unless it’s a second-hand gate, we’ll only know when we get inside.”\nAs the trainees express their mixed feelings, Leon, Yappy, and the association’s president, Oh Kang-hyuk, approach the podium.\nOnce they’re all assembled, Leon begins to speak.\n“The boys have proven themselves over the course of four weeks of training. Of course, there will be questions, and there will be complaints. There must have been a lot of unreasonable complaints.”\nLeon knows that the last four weeks of training have been the height of irrationality.\nThe brutal training, where they had to beat each other up and push themselves beyond the limits of their abilities and on top of that, their only meals was water mixed with salt and sugar.\n“Nevertheless, the men persevered and demonstrated using their actions the virtues of patience and submission.”\n-Submission…huh.\n-Patience…it’s expendable.\nWhen they flinched at the word, Leon was quick to catch them.\n“Do not take virtue lightly. It may seem unreasonable, but these trials and tribulations thicken the group and strengthen the outer walls.”\nThere was a pervasive sense of unreasonableness in that complaint. Speaking of the unreasonableness of what was being forced upon the soldiers, Leon says\n“The suffering you are going through now, the forced loyalty, will save you. It will make you strong.”\nReally?\nKoo was skeptical, even as he listened to Leon’s words.\nFor four weeks, they’d been through only two drills: a grueling physical workout and a defense drill where they had to hold onto their shields and block Leon’s mounted charge.\nNot a single group has yet been able to stop Leon’s charge. Are they really that strong?\n“Do you doubt? Do you not believe in yourself? The time for proof has come.”\nLeon declared. His voice was crisp, clear, and had the power to lead.\nThis is why the trainees mindlessly obeyed this absurd medieval fantasy lion king.\n“From now on, you will attack the gate!”\nGwangju City Yellow Rank Gate.\n“It is there that you will realize what it is like to be a soldier of the Lionheart King, and it is there that you will encounter the Faith that you are meant to serve!”\nThe departure of the 49 D-rank hunters began.\n* * * *\nGwangju Gate was not far from the Naju Plain.\nThe break started two days ago and the grace period until the dungeon break was estimated at ten days.\nEven though Leon had instructed them to get a yellow gate for the graduation ceremony, it hadn’t been easy to find one in time, so the Association had been forced to buy a used gate.\n“But are you sure it’s okay, Ha-ri?”\n“Umm… I think it’s fine, Chief?”\nChief Kim Jin-soo expressed his concern to Ha-ri, who hadn’t seen him in a long time.\nThe majority of the members were Hunters who were said to be D-ranks and had no room for growth and Leon made them attack a Yellow Gate with them, proving their growth under the watchful eye of the Association staff?\nHe would have been less worried if Leon had said he was going to attack the Yellow Gate alone.\n“Seeing as the robot knight isn’t here, are you going to clear it with just the trainees?”\nHa-ri and Yappy were ordered to wait while the cadets attacked the gate since it was Leon’s intention to be as fair as possible.\n“Eh, thanks to you, I’m going to suffer.”\n“Good luck, Chief!”\nChief Kim Jin-soo was overseeing the assault. He was the tank of the Association’s raid and a B-rank Hunter, so it was calculated that he could safely supervise a yellow gate.\n“Let’s go!”\nLeon shouted and one by one, the armed trainees entered the gate, including Chief Kim Jin-soo.\n-Leon.\nAs Yappy sends them on their way and his eight eyes are turning sharply, Ha-ri speaks softly.\n“Lord Yappy, don’t worry too much. His Majesty is here, so everything will be fine.”\n-Trouble.\n“Eh?”\n-His Majesty. Forty-nine cadets. One observer.\n“Isn’t that right, what’s the problem──?”\n-Fifty-two people in the gate.\nYappy brought up a hologram as an infrared image of what he had just witnessed. There, a masked robed person was entering the gate ahead of the trainees.\n“Huh? Who is this…….?”\n-Emergency.\nYappy didn’t say anything more, he just charged straight for the gate at full speed.\n“Lord Yappy, wait for me!”\nAnd just as Yappy entered the gate, Ha-ri, who was following behind, couldn’t make it through the gate and bumped into something.\n“Huh?”\nHa-ri realized that something had happened to the gate that Yappy had gone through.\n“What?!”\n“The gate is fluctuating! Magic power fluctuating!”\nThe surface of the gate suddenly turned red, as if smeared with blood.\n“What, what, red?”\n“Why did the yellow color suddenly turn red!?”\nChairman Oh Kang-hyuk was stunned by the change in front of him.\n“……Fluctuation Gate.”",

      "content": "Chapter 38: Fluctuation Gate\nThe lights at the gate faded and slowly a vast battlefield came into view.\n-Kraaaaaaah!\n-Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk!\nStrange monsters swarmed around and all of them were demons. The horns protruding from their foreheads and the foul magick (demon mana) was proof.\nThe demons are racing across the plains and an army stands to stop them.\n“Stop them!”\n“Ma, stop them?”\n“Impossible!”\nThe demons numbered in the thousands, and the army against them was only a few hundred. They’re badly outnumbered, and their armaments are meager.\nCompared to hunters refined by modern technology, medieval armor and spears were no match for demons ten times their size. And it’s not just the trainees who are baffled by the demonic forces.\n“Uh, why demons?”\n“Demon Gate?!”\nDemons coming out of the yellow gate was unprecedented.\nBeing summoned to the middle of the battlefield out of nowhere was baffling enough, but demons?\nEven the ancients, who had studied the gate, had never heard of such a phenomenon.\n“Shields up! Defense! Form up!”\nDespite the sudden change of scenery, Leon’s orders were calm.\nThe trainees quickly came to their senses as he rode up on his pure white horse, swinging his sword in the air and tapping the soldiers’ shields.\n“Shields up!”\nFollowing their leaders’ instructions, the shields are raised in a flash.\n“Forward, forward, forward!”\nForward? Not just stay and watch? Leon’s orders startled the trainees, but they had seen and learned something over the past four weeks: absolute obedience to a knight’s orders. Needless to say, there was a price to pay for disobedience.\n[Lionheart Aura]\nAbove all else, his mere presence grants a wealth of buffs and the trainees raise their shields and slowly advance.\n‘Not afraid?’\nSeeing this, Chief Kim Jin-soo had a puzzled look on his face. He couldn’t help but realize how reckless an order it was to charge into that horde of demons, but the cadets obeyed dutifully.\nAnd most of all, Kim Jin-soo is stunned by the blinding barrage of system messages.\n‘What are these enhancement traits, giving all the Hunters commander and higher buffs?’\nMeanwhile, the trainees, marching steadfastly forward instead of fleeing, caught the eye of the demons and dozens of demons charged toward them.\n“Ah, demon dogs!”\n“Coming this way!”\nBloodhounds, commonly referred to as demon dogs, were human-sized demons and they lunged at the huddled masses of shields and arrows, breathlessly hoping for the best.\n-Bang!\n-Bang!\nChief Kim Jin-soo intuitively knew that the charge would break through the shields. But…….\n“Block them!”\n“Hold on!”\nThe trainees withstood the four-legged beast’s physical assault. Not just one or two outstanding ones, but all of them.\n‘The Blood Hound’s charge that is too much for even a B-rank Hunter?’\nRank B tanks have unique skills that help them tank but these D-rank Hunters don’t have such a skill, and they’ve managed to block the Demon Hounds’ charge with their shields.\n“Counterattack!”\nAt Leon’s command, the trainees stabbed their swords through the gaps in the shields and their swords easily pierced the demon dogs’ flesh.\n-Keeeeeeek!\n-Thud!\nThe leading Demon Hounds fell in a heap, but then another wave of demons arrived, they were Greatswords, wielding swords taller than a person.\n“Block!”\nThe Hunters blocked the Demon Hounds’ charge, then Lesser demons charged the shield wall with frenzied strikes, but it held.\nLeon raised his sword and shouted.\n“‘harge!”\nThe cadets hurriedly raised their shields and charged forward, staying close to the Greatswords and giving the enemy no room to swing their greatswords.\n“Push!”\n-Thud!\nAfter Four weeks of frantic practice the Hunters pushed the demons back with an instantaneous explosive push.\n“Stab!”\nFrom here on out, it was a mechanical repetition of motions: block, push, and stab. There was nothing quite like hand-to-hand combat in anti-infantry warfare.\nAs the rampaging demons were sliced and diced, a hulking demon emerged.\n“Demon troll!”\n“Demon troll!”\nA medium-sized monster with a body the size of a house and a club that must have been two meters long appeared and the trainees’ pupils trembled as they realized that they were no match for it.\n“Don’t back down! Stay in formation and hold your ground!”\nLeon’s voice roused them. His presence was all they needed to ‘hold their ground’.\n-Countering heavy objects. Sniping commenced.\nIt was then that a minimalist machine gun opened fire with a mechanical voice.\n-Toadadadadadadadad!\nA bullet fired from the fuselage of a Holy Knight is a holy attack in itself.\n“Lord Yappy?!”\n“Why is Lord Yappy here?”\nRegardless of the Hunters’ reactions, the Demon Troll, which had been charging with terrifying momentum, slowed down in pain as Yappy’s holy machine gun round had shredded its knee.\n“Kaaaaaaaah!”\nBut the troll didn’t stop its momentum and raised its club. Trolls are at least Class B…their mass even makes them Class A in terms of difficulty.\nThere’s no way D-rank Hunters would be able to stop a boss-level entity from coming out of that yellow gate──\n“Ugh…!” Koo Dae-sung raised his shield. It protected his teammate’s right shoulder. The Hunters, whose ears were bleeding, naturally clustered their shields around Koo Dae-sung.\n-Bang!\nKoo Dae-sung and the other trainees felt their bodies being pushed backwards as the insurmountable difference in mass penetrated their defenses and shocked them.\n‘Huh?’\nBut a common question flashed through the minds of the trainees who had blocked the troll’s blow.\n‘This is lighter than His Majesty’s charge?’\nThe difference in strength must be four times.\nIn the past four weeks, they hadn’t blocked a single one of Leon’s charges and the slightest slip of his foot would send them soaring into the air.\n[Strongest Charger]\nCompared to him, a troll’s swing would make the trainees’ defense stagger!\n“Good block!”\nMeanwhile, Leon, who had already approached the troll’s back, swung his holy sword with a flick, and the troll’s head was sliced off as if it were tofu.\n-Kiiii…!\n-Kyaak…!\nAs the trolls, who had been their secret weapon, died in such a ridiculous manner, the momentum of the demons subsided. The defenders, on the other hand, gained momentum.\nThe demons, demoralized, took notice and began to retreat as the demon trolls had been ‘annihilated’.\n-Kiui… dead.\n-Troll… really dead.\nFor demons, death is not the end. They are immortal creatures who take on bodies and play in the material world.\nWhen they died, they merely returned to the spirit realm, losing their material vessel.\nThe troll that had just died, however, had not gone through the process of disappearing into the spirit world. It was sucked into Leon’s Holy Grail and ‘vanished’.\n“They’re backing off!”\n“We won! We won!”\nAs they rejoiced in their survival, a rider approached Leon and the Hunters.\nApparently a commander or knight by the state of his armor, he first bows his head in thanks.\n“Thank you, for coming to save our Spero Kingdom, warriors!”\nThe Hunters each checked their system windows at his words.\n[The Spero Kingdom is being invaded by demons, defend the kingdom from the invasion of the demons]\nTime remaining: 1 week\n“Is this a quest…….?”\n“Demons…do you mean Greater Demons?”\n“It can’t be a Greater Demon, there’s no way a Greater Demon would come out of the Yellow Gate!”\nThe Hunters were confused, and some insisted on exiting the gate immediately. But…….\n“What, the gate is gone?”\n“What happened… is this a fluctuation gate?”\n“No way!”\nThe Hunters’ faces hardened. The joy of victory was gone in an instant, replaced by despair.\n“Quiet! Don’t be silly!”\nLeon’s voice drifted over them. The Lionheart King’s aura, that lifts the morale of his soldiers by his mere presence, brought the half-collapsed Hunters to their feet.\n“Lord Spinner, what brings you here?”\n-Observations. A third party has entered.\nYappy displayed a hologram of his observations as a figure in robes, not Leon or the Hunters, used some sort of invisibility spell and was only visible in infrared.\n“Is he up to something?”\n-Lack of evidence.\n“Is there anyone who can explain the current situation?”\nKoo Dae-sung cautiously raised his hand.\n“This is a fluctuation gate.”\n“What is that?”\n“It’s an anomaly in the gate…To put it simply, the difficulty of the gate is rising rapidly, and you can’t leave until you clear it.”\nLeon looked at the gate, which had disappeared unlike the orc gate, and realized that the way out was blocked.\n“Hmm…….”\nLeon was surprised that something like this would happen to the cadets during their graduation exam.\nWas it a coincidence? He didn’t know.\nAs Leon pondered, the Hunters’ complexions darkened in real time.\nNormally, the gate was based on the difficulty of the pre-measurement, and it was difficult for the right group of Hunters to respond to the sudden increase in difficulty.\nIt’s safe to say that once a variable gate pops up, the Hunters inside are doomed.\nThey’re stuck in a gate with an infinitesimal survival rate.\n‘Still…….’\nDespite this, there is only one reason for them not to panic: the presence of the Lionheart King in front of them.\n“Your Majesty, Your Majesty… do you have a plan?”\nWhen the attention of the anxious Hunters was focused, Leon spoke with a calm expression to prevent them from despairing.\n“We’ll attack. The quest said to defeat the Demon Lord.”\n“Greater Demon…or maybe an Archdemon.”\n“Hmph…! This Lionheart King has slaughtered two Archdemons and over thirty Greater Demons. Do you doubt this king’s strength?”\n“Ooooo…….”\n“Yes, Your Majesty has three demon-related traits alone!”\n[Terror of Demonic Species]\n[Demon Lord Slayer]\n[Greatest Demon Slayer]\nThese were the only Demon-related Traits that were confirmed by the system message but the Hunters’ faces brightened with hope.\n“…….”\nLeon didn’t bother to mention that the battle was fought in his world, a world filled with divinity.\nHe didn’t tell them that in his current form, he was no match for a Demon Lord(Archdemon).\nThey could only lean on the hope that was in themselves since a knight must remain steadfast at all times.\n* * * *\nMeanwhile, Reynald Shelman, the mastermind behind the transformation of the Gwangju Gate into the Daemon Gate, watched as Leon repelled the demons.\n“In one blow, a mid-level demon, a Demon Troll…….”\nNo matter how much the Hunters distracted it, decapitating such a tough troll with a single blow…Above all, the troll’s demise was a shocking sight.\nDemons are immortal creatures, they live in the spirit realm, and their physical manifestations are merely shells.\nThey are more like remote-controlled drones, and their destruction doesn’t kill them. However, the Lionheart King’s sword forces the ‘death’ of the beings it has slain.\nIt travels up the mental link and forces ‘death’, meaning that the pilot of the drone dies when it is destroyed.\nHe could see why the Archdemon beyond the Wisdom Gem had fled in terror.\n[Heh… Heh… Heh!]\n“Great One?”\nEven after witnessing such a terrifying existence, a dismal laughter could be heard coming from the Wisdom Gem.\n[Weakened! Weakened! Lionheart, Leon Dragonia Lionheart, you’re just a man after all! Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!]\nWeakened? Him?\nThe one who destroyed a Demon Troll that wasn’t even a normal troll with a single blow?\nApparently amused by Reynald’s questioning, the Wisdom Gem giggled and replied.\n[Hee hee hee, if he had the strength of his prime, he would have annihilated about a thousand demons in a single strike, and if he had enough strength, he would have unsealed the Holy Sword]\n“Holy sword… you mean?”\nThe sword emitted a brief but brilliant light when it slashed at the Demon Troll’s throat. Such power, and it hasn’t even been unsealed?\n[Heh heh heh… Even such a strike, it’s only slightly stronger than a Holy Knight, so he’ll be defeated!]\nAs the Archdemon beyond the Wisdom Gem rejoiced, Reynald spoke cautiously.\n“Great Existence…Then shall we perform a ritual for you to descend?”\n[What?!]\nThe Wisdom Gem was puzzled.\n[No! No matter how weak he is, he’s still the Lionheart King! He’s insane!]\nYou said he’s weakened…….\nReynald swallowed his complaint and asked.\n“And what about the one…who’ll handle him?”\n[Heeheehee…! The Demon Lord of this place.]\n“The Demon Lord…….”\nReynald confirmed the existence of a Demon Lord.\n“No way…There really is a Demon Lord?”\nIf there was such a thing, it was definitely a must-win. In the history of the Thirty Years War since the Cataclysm, the Demon Lord was a monster among monsters that had slaughtered countless S-class Hunters…\n[The energy of the Gate is not enough for a Demon Lord to descend, but…there is an evil spirit here that has been appointed as a Lord.]\n“Oh, oh…….”\nReynald swallowed hard at those words. Humans who serve demons often wish to become demons themselves at the end of their roles.\nThey aspire to the immortality of demons and ambition to become Archdemons themselves.\n[Heh, heh, heh… there’s an existence here that those ugly, lustful demons have been working on for a hundred years…! That would be enough to kill the weakened Lionheart King!]\nFor that, Reynald needed to move around. He would use the fleeting hope of the Spero Kingdom to awaken the Demon Lord.",

      "content": "Chapter 39: The Kingdom in the Gate\nSpero Kingdom, this peaceful, millennia-old kingdom has been plunged into a catastrophe.\nThe demons invaded and one city after another fell, leaving only the last royal castle, where the humans are fighting a losing battle.\n“It’s a theme.”\n“A theme?”\nAt a bar inside Spero Castle Koo Dae-sung said.\n“Come to think of it, all the gates had their own scenery.”\n“Yes, there are field hunting type gates like the Seoul Station Gate, and then there are dungeon type gates, and then there are NPC quest type gates like the Orc Gate.”\nLeon has experienced four gates since coming to Earth.\nThe first was a dungeon-type gate in the Hunan Plains where after defeating the boss monster Dulahan, the gate closed.\nThe second was the Cheongju Gate. It was a cyberpunk-themed world where Yakt Spinner was trying to stop the unsealing of the Wisdom Gem.\nThird was Samjeon Station Gate in Seoul where the theme was to help an orc tribe to become the leaders of the plains but Leon had slaughtered them all with his ignorant charge.\nThis fourth gate was similar to the orc-infested Three Realms gates they’d been through.\n“This gate is a little different from the orc gate.”\nKoo said, checking a system window that Leon couldn’t see.\n“There is a condition attached to completing the quest.”\n“Condition?”\n“Yes, a time limit.”\n[The Kingdom of Spero is being invaded by demons. Defend the kingdom from the invasion of demons]\nTime limit: 1 week.\nThat’s right, the quest condition was to defend the kingdom for one week.\n“In other words, we only need to ‘defend’ the kingdom for a week, and then the gate will be closed.”\n“That’s strange…I’ve heard that the gate showed signs of a dungeon break phenomenon. After a certain period of time, it cracks and the monsters inside jump out?”\nIt’s not just monsters. The overflowing miasma inside will spill out, polluting the ground and making it uninhabitable.\nThe monsters inside the gates that are maintained without closing are constantly being cleaned.\n“Yes, for a normal gate, that’s the way it should be. But these ‘specified quest gates’ can be closed as long as you clear the quest, even if you don’t clean the inside.”\nThat was the proof, backed up by the data humanity had accumulated since the Cataclysm.\nEven fluctuation gates occurred from time to time, so Koo Dae-sung should not be wrong.\n“Then… Did you say Chief Kim Jin-soo?”\nLeon glanced at Kim Jin-soo, who was in the middle of his meal, never touching the food in front of him.\n“Yes, Your Majesty!”\nAs an employee of the Association, he was originally brought in to witness the growth of the trainees and re-measure their ratings. And there was a condition.\n“Originally, this king was not supposed to participate. However, given the urgency of the situation, will our ratings be altered by the presence of this king and Lord Spinner?”\n“Ummm…….”\nOriginally, he was supposed to assess the abilities of the Hunters alone since Leon’s inclusion would make things too easy.\nChief Kim Jin-soo hadn’t expected the D-ranks to grow after only four weeks of training, but today’s battle made him reevaluate them.\nThey definitely grew. In just four weeks… with no unique skills, they were at least a C-rank… and thanks to Leon’s enhanced traits, they performed like B- rank tanks.\nHe didn’t know what they were eating, but their physical strength and physical abilities had increased dramatically.\n“Hmm… I don’t think it’s a problem, I have that much discretion.”\n“Oh…!”\nWith the approval of the Association staff, the Hunters’ spirits rose. However, he was still resolute in his determination when he told them that they would be evaluated based on their performance.\n“One more thing.”\nLeon’s words drew everyone’s attention.\n“What do you think about quest conditions changing and hidden quest elements, as it happened in the Orc Gate, do you think there will be any such elements in this Gate?”\n-Hmm…….\n-A hidden quest…….\n-Wouldn’t we have to do something as ridiculous as we did with Orcs?\nThey first saw hidden quests in the Orc gate since Leon’s actions, which destroyed the premise of the quest, changed the quest itself.\n“It’s… possible, I suppose. Mr. Kim, have you ever heard of a similar case?”\n“Uhm… It’s not like there aren’t any, because anything can happen in the Gates.”\nKoo Dae-sung became uneasy.\n“…Your Majesty, do you have any ideas…….?”\n“I’m thinking of slaying the Demon Lord.”\n“What…!?”\nThe meaning of his words was clear. While slaughtering all the demons that couldn’t be counted, they would also try to capture the Demon Lord that was responsible for the invasion.\nThis was even bigger than the Orc Gate. At least back then, they had Yappy, the guild’s weapon of mass destruction.\n“Your Majesty, are you still willing to take such a dangerous path…….?”\n“Don’t worry. I don’t intend to overwhelm you. Even this king knows better.”\nThe Hunters were relieved to hear that.\nLeaving the walls of the castle and the army of the Kingdom of Spero behind to attack the demon with only 50 Hunters would be suicide.\n“In honor of your victory, rest well today, for tomorrow you will have the burden of meeting the commander of this kingdom.”\n“Yes, Your Majesty!”\nLeon left the Hunters behind and went upstairs to the room the Kingdom Knight had prepared for him. There he summoned the Holy Grail and drained the energy of the Demon Troll he killed today.\nThe Holy Grail has the power to destroy evil and turn its energy into holy power. It’s one of the reasons Leon was able to slaughter over ten million demons in his world.\n‘I didn’t think it could absorb the leader of the beasts.’\nHe absorbed one of Gokrok’s arms and used the energy to restore the Grail’s functionality.\nThe Daemon Trolls were not quite as powerful, but he was able to connect to the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods without difficulty.\n[Leon, my first knight]\n“Arianna.”\nHe couldn’t summon the gods, but he could talk to the gods of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods in his heart for a moment.\n[Did you feel it?]\n“Yes, this gate has an otherworldly energy.”\nLeon had only felt the strange energy after the battle.\n“I noticed it too late.”\n[You, a living, flesh-and-blood being, would not have noticed it. It is an aura that blends into this world so naturally]\nWhat it meant was simple.\nThere was an existence in this world that possessed such immense power that even the Lionheart King could feel it naturally.\n“It should be the Demon Lord.”\n[An existence with that much power would have a more intense aura. This is something…different]\nLeon slaughtered two Demon Lords(Archdemons).\nTogether with the Grail Knights, he and the gods had succeeded in slaying the Demon Horde, whose power was so maddening.\nMalus, Lord of Chaos and Dothraddon, Lord of Pleasure, each of these monsters could end a world.\nTheir mere presence makes the world tremble, bringing screams and despair.\nIf a Lord-level demon were at this gate, lesser Hunters would despair despite the aura of the Lionheart.\n[My knight, the gods of the Pantheon have a message for you]\n“Your knight listens.”\n[Fle wishes to investigate this world. She must have sensed something]\n“Fle herself?”\nLeon recognized the divinity.\n“She will need energy to descend.”\n[Yeah, I don’t have to tell you the way, do I?]\nSomething more tangible is needed for a divine descent than simply possessing an incarnation, as in the case of Demera.\n* * * *\nThe next morning, soldiers came to the inn where the Ten Thousand Gods Guild was staying.\n“Lord Lionheart! Where is Lord Lionheart?”\nKoo Dae-Sung, who had risen early in the morning, ran up the stairs to wake Leon.\n“Your Majesty…! May your soldier see you──”\nBut Leon had already descended, fully dressed. Even though it was still early, his appearance had a cheerful glow.\n“I must go to the palace.”\nKoo Dae-Sung suddenly realized that Leon was indeed a different race from him.\n“You must be Lord Lionheart?”\n“Hmm, yes.”\nLeon didn’t identify himself to the soldiers who came to him. After all, he was technically a knight.\n“The Chancellor and the Captain-General wish to see you, sir. The carriage is ready, so let’s go to the palace.”\n“Very well.”\nIt had been discussed yesterday, so Leon readily accepted.\nLeon glanced back before climbing into the carriage.\n“Lord Spinner, stand by. You’ll be in charge of the remaining trainees.”\n-Yes.\n“We’re also headed to the castle, and we can’t go without servants, so I’ll take three volunteers to serve as servants.”\nAfter a moment of stunned silence, the Hunters, who knew from social experience that in times like this, they had to act quickly, stepped forward.\n“Chief Kim Jin-soo!”\n“Kim Do-han!”\n“Koo Dae-sung!”\nOthers followed, but it was too late.\n“Hmm, good. Open the door.”\nKim Jin-soo, who had a lot of work experience, rushed over and opened the carriage door.\nHe didn’t ask the common sense question, “Do I have to open the door for this royal personality?”\nWhen they arrived at the royal palace, a servant bowed to them.\n“Welcome, gentlemen. I’m Parco, chamberlain of the palace, and I’m here to escort you.”\nAs Parco led the way inside the palace, where all sorts of art and decorations were elegantly placed the hunters wondered if this was what it would be like to visit a royal palace in old Europe.\n“Hmm, the owner of the palace must have great taste.”\n“Hoo-hoo, you have good taste.”\nChamberlain Parco responded to Leon’s praise and explained the history of the palace so that the guests wouldn’t get bored.\n“This palace, the Royal Palace of Spero, has a long history. It has hosted many queens, from the founding Queen Fiora to the current Queen Beatrice.”\n-Queens.\n-Queens from the beginning? It must be a matriarchal society.\n-Shhh. Her Majesty is looking this way!\nThe three of them whispered to each other at the chamberlain’s words but Leon glared at them and spoke up in a firm voice.\n“In what country is it proper for a commoner to pry into the affairs of royalty?”\n“I apologize.”\nLeon quickly apologized to the chamberlain.\n“I’m sorry, my friend, they were never taught proper etiquette. The situation is urgent, so I’ve brought in people who don’t know their manners.”\n“Hehe, it’s okay, you’re an outsider, so it’s to be expected.”\nThe chamberlain shrugged it off, but Leon stared at the three of them with a hard gaze and clicked his tongue as if to say, “Listen.”\n“Tsk tsk… Even if you’re unlearned, there’s something to be said for noticing.”\nThe three of them had to keep their mouths shut until they reached the throne room.\nWhen they arrived Leon was greeted by several bureaucrats.\nKnights and officials stood on either side of a large carpet, with what appeared to be a throne at the end of the carpet covered by a tent.\nA silhouette could barely be seen through the canopy, and it took the form of a slender woman.\n“Lord Lionheart.”\nLeon and his companions were well known in the castle for yesterday’s battle.\nAs a mysterious group that had performed heroically against a demonic army, if Leon hadn’t identified himself as a knight, people would have assumed they were a group of mercenaries.\n“Hmph, you must be Sir Lionheart from the battle at the gates.”\nThe first to speak was a middle-aged man in colorful clothing with an impressive mustache.\n“I am Duke Aquium, Lord Chancellor of the realm.”\nChancellor of the realm, needless to say, a man of the court. He was about to recite his proposal to make Leon a knight of the realm for leading them to victory in battle until Leon opened his mouth.\n“I’ll start by greeting the queen.”\nLeon made a beeline for the queen’s throne, but two men stood in his way: Duke Aquium and an elderly knight, presumably a general.\n“How can an outsider, no matter how meritorious, come so close to your Majesty’s throne?”\nThe Chancellor’s words were echoed by the three men who had followed Leon.\n“You have a point.”\n“He could suddenly turn around and try to assassinate us.”\nLeon was an otherworldly royal with a different sense of common sense from Earth, but he wasn’t a closed-minded person who denied what made sense. So he wasn’t offended by the chancellor’s refusal, but──\n“I can’t stand it.”\n“What?”\n“Your Majesty, I am Leon Dragonia Lionheart, Lionheart King of the Lionheart Kingdom, and I will do what must be done, even if I know it is disrespectful.”\n“No, what does he mean by that, Captain, and why don’t you get him out of here──”\nAt that moment, Leon grabbed the chancellor’s face.\n“Now, wait…!”\nThis is some kind of déjà vu──\n-Crack!\nThe Lionhearted King’s arms tightened, and the chancellor head snapped around as it rotated 1080 degrees and settled back down.\nIt was instant death.\n“…….”\n“…….”\nIt happened so fast, and it was so shocking, that it took the people a while to recover.\nAfter three seconds of unresponsiveness, Leon ripped the arm of the chancellor from his limp body.\nIt was rare to see a man’s arm ripped off with pure evil.\n‘What the hell?’\nWhat did he not like this time?",

      "content": "Chapter 40: The Demon Slayer\nThe chancellor’s head spun three times, it was instant death. Plus his arm was torn off.\n“…….”\n“…….”\nThe reactions are slow and in the face of an emergency that far exceeds their common sense, they freeze.\n“What did you do…….?”\nSomeone said and at the same time, the soldiers pointed their spears.\n“You!”\nLeon remained calm in the face of the immediate danger. He didn’t stop at turning the chancellor’s head and ripping out his arm, but kicked him in the knee where he hadn’t yet fallen.\n“You, you…!”\n“How long are you going to hide your identity, filthy fiend, do you really think you can hide from this Lionheart King’s eyesight?”\nThe shivering corpse stirred, then peeled back its skin to reveal a hideous, haggard creature.\n-Kiiiiii…!\nAfter shedding its human skin, the creature’s head resembled a wart, and its scythe-like arms flailed about.\nIt was an arm that had been hastily regenerated thanks to Leon’s earlier removal.\n“A demon?”\nIt was then that the dozens of soldiers and nobles who had gathered in the realm had shed their outer shells, revealing their hideous forms.\n“Huh…!”\n“Demons!”\nThe non-demons were horrified by the sudden appearance of the demons. If they were slow to react, they would be wiped out.\n“Don’t flounder, you lowly things!”\nThe Lionhearted King’s furious yell was deafening to the soldiers and demons alike.\n“Unite! Fight as one!”\nAt Leon’s words, the soldiers rushed to unite while the nobles and bureaucrats retreated behind him in a huff.\n“Kieh-eh-eh-eh!”\nA demon whose eardrums burst at the holy roar rushed forward, swinging a blade-like arm, but the blade was caught by Leon’s arm.\n“Chiiii?”\nThe demon struggles with the unmoving arm but Leon pulls harder and harder, and the arm is ripped off in a pool of green blood.\n“Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!”\nThe demon’s howl of agony didn’t last a second as the holy sword had decapitated it.\nAs Leon cut the demon’s throat in one swift motion, Chief Kim Jin-soo shouted.\n“Raise your shield!”\nUnlike Leon, who could summon his holy sword, they entered the throne room unarmed. Instead, they tried to pick up the dead soldier’s weapons and armor.\n“Kie-e-e-e!”\nIt was then that a mantis demon attacked Team Leader Kim Do-han as he picked up a weapon but just as the sharp blade was about to cut into him, a flash of light pierced the demon’s throat.\n“Thank…….”\nIt was not Leon who wielded the sword but an old man, the kingdom’s grand marshal, who wiped the blade clean of the demon’s green blood and barked out instructions.\n“Demons have infiltrated the palace. Kill them all!”\nSoldiers and knights joined in, and one by one, the demons were slain. But the demons didn’t just die.\n-Kiiiieeeeeeeeeeeee!\n-Kyaaaaaaaaaaah!\nA dense mist of black energy rose from the demons’ corpses, clinging to their skin and disturbing their minds.\n-Ew! Hmph?!\n-Ahhhh! My head, my head hurts…!\nThe soldiers scream in pain.\nChief Kim Jin-soo and Team Leader Kim Do-han also held their heads, shivering while Koo Dae-sung was the only one holding on in a cold sweat.\n“The power of corruption. So, the demons at this gate are its minions.”\nThe demons, on the other hand, were unable to breach Leon’s mental barrier. His powerful ego and absolute faith in the divine are beyond their reach.\n“Let me show you the grace of God.”\nLeon took out the Holy Grail and splashed the holy water into the air, clearing the fog as divine grace took hold, and the evil was driven away.\n“Ugh…….”\n“What the…….”\nWhat the non-demons could barely see was Leon with a gloriously brilliant holy sword and grail.\nIn a room full of evil spirits, he shone with more layers than anyone else and some fell to their knees and shed tears at his noble presence.\n“Greetings, Hero.”\n“You are a hero…….”\nAs they worshiped, Leon moved toward the Queen, who remained silent amid the commotion.\n“Stop.”\nThe Grand Marshal stopped him with his sword pointed at him but Leon did not blame him.\n“I understand your loyalty, but in this time of emergency, you shouldn’t put royalty first.”\n“Only the Queen can judge my loyalty.”\n“You have a point. But…….”\nLeon snapped his fingers at the cool blade of the sword pointed at him.\n-Bang!\nLeon flicked the blade, and the blade bent under the enormous impact, causing the Grand Marshal to tremble as well.\nThe power of Leon was truly beyond human and he spoke to the Grand Marshal as he grabbed his trembling hand.\n“I ask no questions, I make no judgments. It is the queen’s job to decide, and you know it too.”\n“Pfft… Her Majesty is in a daze and cannot make a judgment. She has entrusted that power to the Chancellor… and now that he is dead, I, the Grand Marshal, have full authority.”\n“Hmm…….”\nLeon stared for a moment at the Queen beyond the tent, who remained silent. However, he was soon convinced that she was not a Fallen (beings who turn into demons) and spoke to the Warlord.\n“There is already an aura of the Fallen in this castle, and we will have to clean it up quickly.”\n“Are you sure of that?”\n“A king does not speak falsehoods.”\n“…….”\nThe warlord thought for a moment, then spoke cautiously.\n“What do you want?”\n“Command of the soldiers and the right to execute rogue servants. I will deal with your incompetence.”\nThe Great Marshal turned to face the queen for a moment and since the silhouette of the queen leaned against the throne was unresponsive the decision rested with him.\n“……How?”\n“Gather all the men of this city in the square.”\n* * * *\nKoo Dae-sung and Kim Jin-soo were dumbfounded as they watched the kingdom’s troops bend to Leon’s instructions.\n“NPCs…were they always this cooperative?”\n“In a theme like this, the Hunters aren’t even more than soldiers…….”\nAlthough they were called NPCs for convenience, their intelligence and autonomy were no different from those of modern Earthlings.\nIf anything, they were more authoritarian and wary of outsiders.\nSoldiers, bureaucrats, and nobles bobbed and weaved at Leon’s command.\n“There’s something different about the king after all…….”\nNatural charisma, a noble spirit and unquestioned authority.\nLeon was royalty by birth and would act the same way anywhere. He’s used to being in charge and leading people.\n“I thought about it a lot when he was feeding us sugar water, but……we should stay in the Ten Thousand Gods Guild.”\nKoo Dae-sung nodded at Team Leader Kim Do-han’s words.\nWhile the Hunters were talking, a large number of citizens gathered in the square. Tens of thousands of the city’s citizens, young and old alike, had gathered together.\nLeon stepped to the podium.\n“I am Leon Dragonia Lionheart, Lionheart King of the Lionheart Kingdom, authorized by the Grand Marshal of the Spero Kingdom.”\nThe crowd roared as the foreign knight introduced himself but Leon spoke quickly.\n“There are those among you who are demon-possessed and corrupted, and they plan to riot from inside to match the invasion from outside.”\nThe citizens were agitated and confused by his words.\n“But there is no need to worry. This king is an agent of the gods who has slaughtered countless demons and has a way of identifying the Fallen.”\n“What way?”\n“I’ll let him show you.”\nLeon gestured and the soldiers blocked off the square and began stacking wood as the citizens grew anxious.\n“What the hell are they doing?!”\nLeon was not deterred by the commoners’ words and he pointed his glowing holy sword at the oiled lumber.\n“God of war and flame, rain down your fire upon your warriors.”\nSparks flew from the holy sword. It was brief, but it was enough to ignite the oiled wood.\nThe timbers stacked in a circle spread in shovelfuls, creating a prison that enclosed the entire square.\n“Now, those who are not evil, those who are not corrupt, those who are not heretics, prove your purity by throwing yourself into the flames!”\n“……?”\nThe citizens were momentarily stunned by Leon’s booming announcement, and they weren’t the only ones. Even the soldiers in the circle were dumbfounded by Leon’s command.\n-Kaaaaaaaah…!\nThe flames roared and gained momentum as they consumed the fiercely burning wood.\n“You’re crazy!”\n“He’s trying to kill us all!”\nIt was a natural reaction and even Koo Dae-sung and Kim Jin-soo must have been wondering, “Is he crazy?” at that moment.\nLeon didn’t let the commoners’ outcry go unanswered.\n“Will you shut up, you fools!?”\nLeon’s words effectively silenced them.\n“Demons infect and deceive people with their malice. If necessary, I will kill all of you to stop the spread of evil.”\nOf course, no one would kill an entire city to kill a lurking demon but Leon was saying that he was capable of doing so.\n“Pass through the divine flame and prove your purity. It’s simple.”\n“Crazy…….”\n“A madman. The Great Marshal has brought a madman.”\nI frighteningly agree.\nChief Kim swallowed hard.\n“You always have to show the people in person. This king will have to do the hard work.”\nLeon stormed down, grabbing the protesting citizen and the soldier blocking him by the scruff of the neck.\nThe two panicked, but Leon threw them into the flames.\n-Crrrrrrrrrrr!\nThe screams of agony echoed horribly as it was burned alive.\n“What?”\nBut there was someone walking out of the flames. It was a protesting citizen.\n“What, you’re okay?”\n“Then what was that scream?”\n“Hey, look!”\nThe citizens’ eyes turned to the soldier who had been thrown.\nA demon whose flesh had burned away, tearing at its shell and revealing its ugly true colors was there instead proving that the soldier was a Fallen.\n“This sacred flame burns only evil beings. Give thanks to Petos, god of war and flame, and cross the flames chanting his name.”\nWith that realization, the citizens rushed through the flames.\nOne hesitated, but Leon approached him.\n“Why aren’t you trying to walk through the fire?”\n“What? It’s because…….”\n“Are you a degenerate, a heretic, a sociopath, or do you wish to fall by the sword of this king?”\n“Oh, no, I’m going right now!”\nThe citizen ran, panting and just then, a child approached Leon.\n“Hehe, knight, I want you to buy flowers──”\nBefore he could finish his sentence, he was kicked and sent flying. The child’s body rolled across the ground again and again before bursting into flames.\n“Your Majesty, what…!”\n“Listen, you infiltrating evils! Your foul stench is too vibrant to disguise your purity.”\n-Kie-E-E-E!\nA miniature demon rising from the corpse of a child covered in blood and the small demon bared its hideous teeth──\nA bolt from nowhere pierces the Small Demon’s forehead. Immediately, its evil energy is absorbed by Leon’s Holy Grail, which means it has been destroyed.\n-Enemy defeated confirmed. Changing sniping point.\nA minimalist spider knight moves between the buildings surrounding the square.\n“I will punish you. I will tear your souls apart.”\nLeon raises his sword, and from all sides, the Fallen tear off their shells and reveal their true colors. There were more than five hundred of them.\n-Human bastards. How dare you speak without knowing……?\n-You think you’re going to die a nice death──\n“Demon themeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE──────!!!!”\n-My ears! My ears! My ears!\nOnly the eardrums of demons burst from the roar of the divine lion that it’s activated only when a living demigod is truly enraged.\nThe noise was indeed three hundred decibels, over a hundred times the threshold to be categorized as a shockwave and no longer noise!\nOf course, it was only for demons.\nLeon’s teeth grinded together as an uncontrollable rage bubbled up inside him. He feels insulted by the maggots, who have been ‘hostile’ to him for so long.\n“Scum…maggots…parasitic on human emotions…!”\nThe gnashing of teeth and the raspy voice are divine as the bodies of the demons near him were being disintegrated in real time.\n“You dare to infiltrate the gaps between humans, weave your way through the ranks, and stand before me. You dare to stare at the Lionheart King, for you are not worthy.”\nLeon shuddered, unable to control the shiver that ran through his body.\n“Parasites walking around on two legs pretending to be humans? Forming packs? Pretending to be soldiers? Do you think I will allow this? You will die, screaming in agony. Your cries and despair will echo to the heavens.”\n-Crazy Asshole.\n-…I think we got the wrong one.\nThe Fallen shuddered, sensing that something had gone terribly wrong.\n“Scream more, scream more, for that is the only way you will please this King!”\nThe battle in the square was over in less than an hour while Reynald Shelman and the Wisdom Gem watched from afar.\n“Looks like planting……Fallen doesn’t work, Great One.”\n[Ahhh…that bastard…that murderous bastard…….]\nReynald heartily agreed with the words.",

      "content": "Chapter 41: Shut Up, You Demon\nThe demons were easily dispatched.\nThe Demons of Corruption, who specialize in infiltration in the first place, have low combat capabilities. Add to that their inability to flee outside of the Divine Flame, and you have a one-sided hunt.\n‘Still, it’s a huge number. If this many saboteurs were working from within…….’\nKoo Dae-Sung realized that this quest itself had a ridiculous difficulty level.\nWith this many demons lurking inside, would they be able to deal with them even if an A-rank raiding party came?\nKoo Dae-Sung didn’t think so.\n“Of course…….”\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart was a king from another world with a completely different common sense than modern Earth, a misguided royalty who has no intention of adapting to Earth, but rather forcing it to adapt to him.\nBut this man’s methods always get results.\nWhat choice do we, the common folk, have but to trust this man, or better yet, bet on him?\nThis was something that even the Hunters themselves admitted, let alone the ancients.\nAfter all, they had grown to the point where they were able to fight against a demonic army when they were only D-ranks. But──\n“Team Leader Kim, isn’t that a little… wrong?”\n“……Hmm.”\nThe Hunters shook their heads as they watched the tragedy unfold in the square.\n* * * *\nThe demons inside the castle have been decimated but the citizens are in shock. They were horrified that there were Fallen among them, and terrified that someone next to them might be one.\nMost of all, they feared the demons clad in human flesh.\n“Pull them out!”\nLeon felt the need to dilute their fears and as all the citizens watched, he hung one of the captured demons in the center of the square.\n“Fear not, citizens of the Spero Kingdom. For as long as the Lionheart King exists, these demons cannot transgress against you.”\nThe citizens stared at the hanging demon but their gazes were still filled with more fear.\nThe hanging demon basked in the fear directed at him and let out a ghastly laugh.\n“Hahahahaha… Don’t think this is the end. You will be doomed. The powers of corruption will turn you into──”\n“Shut up, you demon!”\nLeon’s blade slammed into the demon’s skull, crushing it.\nIts skull collapsed, one of its eyeballs popped out, and its chin dropped to the ground, making it look ugly.\n“Look at this ugly beast! These depraved powers are responsible for tempting you and causing you to fear! It is their fault that you are hungry, that you are sick, that there is discord in your family, that you fell this morning, that you are unable to marry, that you have lost money gambling!”\n“Why is it my fault──?”\n“Shut up, you demon!”\n“Aaahhhhh!”\nThis time, the right ear was ripped out as the demon screamed and the citizens watched and questioned the appearance of such a demon.\n-What, that demon is to blame for my mom’s illness?\n-Is he to blame for my failed confession to Marilda?\n-Was that asshole responsible for me losing money at the gambling house yesterday?!\n“You bastard! Why is that my fault──?”\n“Shut up, you demon!”\n“Citizens striving for justice, demons are the ones who bring bad luck to your lives, for they are responsible for every misfortune in your lives, and your lack of knowledge of the right faith is also due to their interference.”\nIgnorance is blamed on the demons. The demons were guilty, but they had no defense. If he opened his mouth, Leon’s violence would be unrelenting.\n“But you have nothing to fear. For your sake, Petos, the god of war and flame, has sent down his sacred flame.”\nLeon grasped the wood that was burning the plaza but the blazing flames didn’t scorch his skin in the slightest.\n“There you are.”\n“I, you mean me?”\n“Yes, come out here.”\nThe young man is forced to step forward as Leon points at him and Leon hands him a piece of burning wood.\n“Hold it.”\n“Yes?”\n“I won’t tell you twice.”\nThe young man hesitated, but remembered walking through these flames didn’t hurt unless you were a demon. Having experienced it once, he grasped the burning wood.\n“Wow…….”\nAnd as expected, the flames did not hurt the young man.\n“Punish this demon with this. Until this demon meets the punishment he deserves.”\n“Uh… that, that’s…….”\n“You’re going to show mercy, are you actually sympathizing with the demon?”\n“Oh, no, I’m saying that my father was killed by these demons too!”\n“Then unleash your wrath, for the God of War delights in righteous indignation, and you have a duty to purge this vile beast!”\nGulping, the young man gripped the wood and stared at the demon. His legs trembled as the demon’s fierce eyes bore into him.\nAll you have to do is touch me with that thing. I’ll chase you to the ends of hell and kill you──!\nWill you be a good boy and open your eyes!”\n“What?!”\nThe demon’s teeth are knocked out by Leon’s fist, his skull is crushed, his eyeballs gouged out, his ears ripped off, and his teeth knocked out…it was almost comical.\n“Hear me citizens! You have a right to punish this vile beast! Punish it! Make it suffer! Burn him alive!”\nThe burning wood was piled up; its sanctity was paled, but it would torment the demon all the more.\nThe young man beat the demon with burning wood and the demon bound by the ‘sacred wire’ was unable to resist.\n“Kill the demon!”\n“Kill the demon!”\nThe cheers of the citizens terrified the demon.\n“You, you madmen, the curse of corruption is upon you──”\n“Shut up, you demon!”\nThe demon tongue was ripped out of his mouth for his protest but the demon did not know that he was the luckiest demon alive because he was beaten to death by the citizens.\n* * * *\nIn the dank, damp basement of the castle, demons were imprisoned.\nBeltas, the demon of pleasure and depravity, shuddered at the screams echoing from the dank dungeons.\nHe had tortured and corrupted countless humans in his 34 years as a demon, but he never thought he would be in this position.\n“Ugh… Uh, why can’t I get any strength in my hands?”\nBeltas struggled to untie the ‘wires’ that bound his hands, but he could not move them.\n-Oh!\nThe sound of iron legs pounding the stone floor grew closer.\n-Crackle\nThe camera’s eyes stared at Beltas.\nAlthough the minimalist size could be considered cute at first glance, Beltas knew better because the tiny little mechanical spider had slaughtered their kind.\n“What, what!”\nHow does one corrupt a machine? It was a question Beltas could not answer for now.\nYappy said.\n-Provide information.\n“Ha! You think I’m going to listen to a mimic!”\nHe tried to sound amused, but the cold machine’s gaze only bore into him. Unnervingly so.\n-No. 14. Uncooperative.\nWith those words, Yappy knocks on the iron gate, and armed soldiers open it and enter.\n“Ha! Kill me if you must, for I will surely resurrect…what is that?”\nBeltas face turned a deep shade of blue as he sensed an unusual aura coming from the water cistern the soldiers had brought with them.\nThe cistern was filled with diluted holy water from the Holy Grail.\n-See Big Data. Reasonable conclusion.\nBeltas swallowed the question that fluttered in his throat.\n-The water knows the answer.\n“What?”\nIn an instant, a wire was wrapped around Beltas neck. Yappy’s mechanical arm pulls on the coiled wire, and the demon’s face is plunged into the trough.\n“Krrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!”\nBeltas screams in horror as his flesh melts away but rising bubbles replace his screams.\n“Puhhh!”\nBeltas face lifted as the wire around his neck gave way but his face melted into a hideous mess.\n“You, you bastard, I am Beltas, the demon of pleasure and depravity, and you’ve done this to me-”\n-Uncooperative.\n“Uffu! Uffu! Ehhhhhhh!”\nThe bucket of diluted holy water was not enough to extinguish the demon. But the pain was certain.\n“Kuheh!”\n-Cooperative. A request to provide useful information under objective judgment.\n“Now, wait.”\n-Uncooperative.\n“Help me.”\n-Uncooperative.\n-Crrrrrrrrrr!\n“I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you anything, so please, no more holy water…!”\nOnly then did Yappy release his grip on the wire.\n“That, but what should I say, I don’t know anything──”\n-Uncooperative.\n“Wait, I’ll talk. I’ll tell you whatever you want, whatever you want…… Stop, stop, please…….”\nBeltas confessed everything he knew. How to corrupt humans, where, when, and how many mid-level demons were in place… everything he knew.\nYappy, who had been recording Beltas words without missing a single one, let out a cold mechanical sound.\n-Prisoner number 14. Information text 30,564 characters. 9,104 characters short of the average text of prisoners one through thirteen, 39,667 characters.\n“What? What’s that…….\n-You could have divulged more information.\nWhat the fuck?! You said average! And you know how much I said with text numbers!\n-Calls into serious question the need for life support for prisoners.\n“What do you want me to say?”\n* * * * *\n-Over. Synthesis of 32 informational texts. More than 89% similarity. Derived as reasonable truth.\nYappy’s report was indeed accurate and reasonable.\nHe tortured demons to get them to say anything, and then he found the information that matches each other.\nThe higher the match, the more accurate the information, which is then reported to Leon.\n“Hmm, good to know. Good work, Lord Spinner.”\n-Yup!\nLeon was ready to use the organized information to kill the demons. He slaughtered hundreds of demons in the plaza, but those lesser demons won’t be enough for a divinity to descend.\nHe needs to kill at least five high-level demons before he can bring Goddess Fle down.\n“Lord Spinner, what did you do with the demons once you had all the information?”\n-Disposed of. Held at 127 decibels for 14 seconds. Very successful.\nYappy didn’t bother to mention that screams of agony resounded in the prison. He merely fulfilled the order, “Let them die in agony.”\n-Square firing squad confirmed death. Peak 155 decibels. Citizens’ cheers 189 decibels.\nYappy played the demons’ screams.\n-Keeeeeeeeeeeee!!!\n-Keeeeeeeeeeeee!!!\n“Hmm, the sound of justice done is always sweet to hear.”\nWith that, Leon entered the bedroom. Armed with this information, he would begin hunting the demons tomorrow morning.\nFor the past two hundred years, Leon has been on the trail of demons, hunting them down as they fled. He was a specialist in demon hunting.\nNone will escape the Lionheart King’s slaying.\n‘My heart is racing.’\nLeon lay in bed with his heart pounding. As he sniffed his pillow, he envisioned tomorrow’s brutal hunt for demons.\n“Hmm…….”\nHis chest tightens, he can’t sleep and his hands and feet are shaking. It’s strange.\nHis heart is pounding, his head is boiling, and he feels like it’s about to explode.\n‘Even while this king is asleep, the demons are breathing their foul breath on the world, aren’t they?’\nAt the thought of it, his anger soared.\n-Your Majesty. Heart rate spiking. Dizzy spells. Chest pain. Difficulty breathing.\n“Ugh…!”\nLeon jerked to his feet. He couldn’t get back to sleep.\n“Lord Spinner, I cannot bear the thought of these creatures living and breathing in the same world as me. What can I do about it?”\n-Rapid Elimination.\n“That’s a good idea, we should go out for the night!”\nLeon feels no fatigue. The living demigod has infinite vitality, so he never tires, even after repeated battles.\nIt was the same with machines so Leon rushed out of the castle with Yappy.\nIt was the start of a brutal night for the demons.",

      "content": "Chapter 42: The Demon Lord of Wisdom is Scared of the Lion King\nIn the plains in front of Spero castle, a cacophony of depravity and pleasure raged.\nMen with grotesque snouts whip and beat, tear flesh into pieces and roast it, and bathe captives in water made from molten gold.\nIt’s a grotesque scene of excess, of luxury, pleasure, and depravity turned malevolent, and it’s here that Reynald Shelman enters, clutching a Wisdom Orb.\n-Human.\n-Heh, humans, humans.\n-Ah, humans, humans, humans!\nThe demons guessed his identity by the aura emanating from the Orb of Wisdom, and their fierce, feral gazes pierced Reynald.\n“Hmph…Is everything all right, great one?”\n[Don’t stare at those lowly whores for long, mortals are quickly corrupted]\n“Yes!”\nReynald turned away from the scene of pleasure, unfurling the shields of his antimagic, as he had been told to do by the Wisdom Gem. But no demon would allow a follower of another demon to roam in the realm of pleasure and corruption.\n-Thump! Thump! Thump!\nSomething rushed toward Reynald with a frenzied noise, but apart from the noise, a huge presence pressed down on him.\n“How dare you bastards trespass on my pleasure grounds, have you lost your mind!?”\nIt was a grotesque giant, clutching a flesh-encrusted halberd in each of his eight arms, with tarnished golden chains at each of his six nipples that spoke.\nThe crown of moonlight on his head contains a malevolence that shakes the very soul of even Reynald, an S-class mage.\n[Do not stare at the crown]\n“Yes, yes…….”\nThe only thing keeping him alive is the magical energy flowing from the Wisdom Orb. The Orb of Wisdom stared at the eight-armed giant that filled the void beyond.\n[Androzin, the Archdemon of Pleasure and Corruption]\nAs the Orb of Wisdom spoke to him he twisted the corners of his hideously torn mouth and said.\n“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! A cunning goblin.”\nArchdemon Androzin’s scornful gaze and voice were not lost on the Wisdom Gem.\n[I’ll make you an offer you can’t refuse!]\n“An offer? An offer, hahahahahaha!”\nAndrozin laughed a despicable laugh, a broad laugh that caused demons everywhere to giggle and join in.\n“Know thy place, beast! Do you still think you’re our equal, that you, with your Lord and most of the Archdemons slain, can stand before this pleasure and depravity!”\nAndrozin remembered the ugliness of the demons of wisdom and inquiry, hunted down over two hundred years. Barely a few survived, while the rest were destroyed.\n[You’ve been hunted down, too, and you’ve been smug about it…….]\n“What?!”\nAndrozin was outraged by the words from the Wisdom Gem, but it was true.\n[180 years ago, during the Great Advent, our lord was not the only one who was destroyed! The Lord of Pleasure was also destroyed!]\n“You bastard!”\nAndrozin monstrous roar terrified the demons. He was so enraged that even the demons around him were targets of his anger.\nOne hundred and eighty years ago, the demons suffered a terrible loss and the five evils united in an unprecedented event.\nRuthless destruction, cruel indifference, disordered exploration, ugly lust, and devouring compulsion, these five vices invaded a world.\nThe result: terrible devastation. It was a catastrophe, with three Lord-level demons killed and ten million demons wiped out.\nMany demons do not know what happened to the Demon Gate, as it was destroyed and there are no survivors.\nAndrozin knows only that the Lord of Pleasure died there, but not who killed him or how.\nWhat Androzin has been doing here for a hundred years is the aftermath.\n[I know what happened there, I’m a survivor of it!]\n“Do you… know?”\n[Your ignorance will not allow you to understand what happened there. You are beasts of desire, driven by animal instincts. I told you I would make you an offer you could not refuse!]\nAndrozin thought he’d been lured in by the unruly desk-bug but there are so few demons that left that world…the world of the Holy Law Users. Even those that knew were hiding it and using it to their advantage.\nJust like the Demon Lord beyond the purgatory.\n“Speak. I, Androzin, will cast him into the bottomless pit of depravity!”\n[Kikit! Did you know I’m doing what the Supreme Archdemon told me to do?]\nAndrozin’s voice twisted sullenly at those words.\n“It will soon be over. Eventually, mortal, the end is near.”\n[Good! Then let me tell you, the commander of those who murdered the Lord of Pleasure is in this world!]\nThe Orb of Wisdom gave Androzin the information he needed and left the barracks with Reynald.\n“Is that… all?”\n[This is the most powerful move I can make here!]\nWisdom’s Gem was not sure of victory. Even though he was weakened, his opponent was a champion of reversals and a mistake could easily result in Androzin being killed.\n[Seven to three. Androzin’s seven, he’s three]\n“Well, if that’s the case… if I, an S-class mage, and the Great One intervene, isn’t it a must-win?”\n[I’m not going?]\n“…….”\nBastard. Reynald was fed up with the Wisdom Gem behavior.\n[Don’t you dare try to intervene either, his holy law will annihilate any spirit body connected to you, even if it shatters the Holy Grail!]\n“……I understand.”\nBystander, unconditionally hiding and cowering. Though it’s obvious that it’s thoroughly self-serving,\n[Androzin may be a dumb beast compared to me, but he’s not stupid, and I’m sure he’ll summon his elite to deal with the Lionheart King!]\nThe Demons of Pleasure and Corruption are the most bizarre of the malignant, but they are not the most powerful in combat.\nHowever, they are almost as numerous as the Demons of Lust and a large number means a large pool.\n[He will soon summon the higher demons!]\nThis is the Halls of Corruption. It’s where the demons of pleasure and decadence have been working for a hundred years, ever since they lost their lord.\n“Where do we go from here?”\nThey don’t plan to stop here. The Demons of Wisdom and Exploration are intelligent demons who specialize in magic.\nThey can strengthen other demons and grant them magical powers.\nWhile the Demons of Pleasure and Corruption are weaker in combat, with the Wisdom Gem himself buffing them, they could easily defeat the Lionheart King along with the kingdom.\n[First, check out the corpse harvesters who are having an orgy in the forests near the royal castle – those fresh corpse eaters are sure to be a force to be reckoned with!]\nThe corpse harvesters are vile demons who play with the corpses of their victims.\nThey are foul-smelling demons who wear their corpse parts as decorations whenever they collect them, but they are highly effective in combat as they scour the battlefield for fresh flesh.\nIf they were to be magically enhanced, they would be a formidable force, capable of taking on even the most elite of Lionheart Second Army Named Elites.\n[Cough, wait, Lionheart, this gate will be your grave]\nThat’s when he found the barracks that housed the Corpse Harvesters. Reynald saw a Corpse Harvester, a mid-level demon, walking toward them.\n“Is that a Corpse Harvester…….?”\nIt was a horrifying creature with a tentacle as a hand while the other held a club.\nThe subject was naked from head to toe but, dutifully concealing its nudity with a piece of a corpse.\nThey were psychopathic berserkers of the worst kind so Reynald tried to speak to him cautiously.\n[Breathe!]\nAt the same time as the whispered words, something snaps around the Corpse Harvester’s neck and it cries out.\n“Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!”\nWith a piercing scream, the corpse harvester rises and Reynald follows the direction he’s being dragged and sees a sight he can’t believe.\n“Ugh…!”\nThere were spider webs everywhere in the forest.\n-Agh…….\n-Kill me…….\nAnd the victims hanging from them, the corpse harvesters, caught in the webs, moaning in pain.\n“Lord Spinner, did you take care of that?”\n-Yes!\nReynald and the Wisdom Gem instinctively recognized the voices of the Holy Knights.\n[Hey! Did you hide properly? Did you turn on your stealth?]\n“Of course, it’s a top-notch stealth spell, completely invisible to the naked eye!”\n[Anxious! Anxious! Anxious!]\nThe Wisdom Gem utilized its own magicka. At most, it used the magical energy it had accumulated from sacrifices to perform a perfect stealth magic.\n-It is believed that there are still surviving individuals. The last one you captured was looking at something.\n“After all that cleaning, it’s still here.”\nWhat the hell is going on here? Reynald hadn’t heard any sounds until he came to this forest.\nSurely a sweep of that many troops in a place like this would make some noise?\n[The Holy Knight’s Holy Law of Silence, what nonsense, blocking even the sound of a warhorse’s galloping! He used the Holy Law of Silence to hunt down all the demons in the forest!]\n‘That, is that possible?’\n[I don’t know, but these bastards did it!]\nThe Holy Knight’s Holy Law was a treasure trove of absurdity.\nEven among the demons of wisdom and exploration, who gathered all kinds of knowledge and magic, the Holy Knight’s code could not be interpreted as anything more than ‘absurd’.\n“Hmm… That’s strange, I can sense an unpleasant aura…….”\nIt can’t be.\nWisdom Gem wanted to cry out.\nThe magic it had just cast was a perfect stealth spell, complete with subspace dimensional separation. Even with the disadvantage of being immobilized in one place, there was no way this could be detected!\n“I think it’s around here…….”\nLeon’s face flashes past Reynald’s and Reynald stares at him through bloodshot pupils, unable to swallow his saliva.\n‘Please just go, just go, just go!’\n“Hmph…….”\nAs suspicion deepens, suspicion turns to certainty and Reynald knew instinctively that if Leon turned his head and looked in their direction, he would definitely notice their presence.\nAs he watched Leon head slowly spin around, a cold sweat ran down his spine──\n-Bam!\n“What’s going on, Lord Spinner.”\n-Target observed. Dealt with at point 4-B17.\n“Looks like we have some more hunting to do today.”\nHearing Yappy’s report, Leon turned away.\nThe sound of the superhuman walking through the forest faded into the distance. It was five minutes after their disappearance that Reynald and the Wisdom Gem spoke up.\n“Whoa, whoa, whoa…….”\n[Dee, I almost lost it…….]\n* * * *\nOvernight, Leon had slaughtered more than 300 demons and all of them were elites.\nHe may have been running on fumes, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t strong.\n“Demons of pleasure and depravity.”\nHypersexual perverts who sought not proper sexuality, but horribly twisted lusts.\nLeon was disgusted when he realized that they were the demons at this gate.\nAll demons were unpleasant, bugs to be burned, but the ugly lust demons were especially unpleasant.\nThey corrupt humans and plunge them into a morass of pleasure and lust by any means necessary.\nSome humans could not even resist the temptations of lesser demons.\nThey are responsible for the widespread corruption of the Empire and its neighboring kingdoms.\nThey are the weakest in combat, but the most dangerous. Leon knew all too well how the Fallen betrayed their own families.\n‘Strange,’ he thought, ‘how come so many lustful demons have taken up residence at this gate?’\nThere were quite a few high ranking demons, and several that were considered elite among the Lust Demons. Naturally, there should also be Archdemons.\n‘If a being of that caliber is in this gate, there must be a reason…….’\nLeon wasn’t going to be patient with the question, he was going to look in the most suspicious places.\n“You must be tired, but you’re not resting.”\nA sweet voice rang in his ears and Leon’s eyes snapped open.\nDemon Ranks:\n-Lesser Demons/ Low-level demons\n-Mid-level demons\n-Greater Demons/ High-level demons\n-Archdemons\n-Demon Lord (Lord of Chaos is the title of a lord)",

      "content": "Chapter 43:\nThe Queen and the Knight\nShe was breathtaking.\nNot even the black clothes on her body, her stern expression, and her dress could hide her ‘color’.\n“Greetings, knight. May I call you Your Majesty Lionheart?”\nShe is a dangerous woman. Even the smile in her eyes and the delicate fingers covering her mouth exude a certain aura.\nAn innate temperament, a source of strife that colors her mere presence and a color that is a harbinger of corruption.\n‘Beautiful.’\nAt first glance, her purple eyes, reflecting the moonlight, seem to hold an endless darkness that no light can penetrate.\nA lesser man would have drowned in the depths of that abyss without even realizing it.\n“I am the queen of this small kingdom, Beatrice Aligieri Spero.”\n“Leon Dragonia Lionheart, ruler of the Lionheart Kingdom.”\nLeon kissed the back of the woman’s hand respectfully, but wary.\n‘How did I not notice?’\nIs that even possible? Leon is not the kind of man to get cocky.\nEven if he’s weakened from his prime, how could she fool his senses that kept countless assassins and demons at bay?\n“Hoo-hoo, don’t be so vigilant, I just wanted to say hello to a benefactor of the kingdom.”\n“This is not a good time for a lady to visit.”\nThe moonlight was still just past dawn. It was a knight’s virtue to rise early in the morning to train, but it was not a royal virtue, much less a lady’s.\n“I am being watched.”\n“Watched?”\nLeon looked puzzled by Queen Beatrice’s words.\n“Watched? By who?”\nThe queen smiled bitterly and named the forces holding her captive.\n“The Great Marshal and his knights are watching me and keeping me confined.”\n“The Great Marshal?”\nLeon remembered the Great Marshal loyalty to the queen, and he didn’t seem the sort of man to commit such disloyalty.\nBut you never know what’s in a man’s heart. A loyal knight might covet a king’s wife, or a pious priest might amass a fortune.\n“Your Majesty Lionheart, I have a favor to ask of you.”\nThe queen’s hand grasped Leon’s. It was a mere grasp, but it had a disturbing quality to it.\n“I will hear and judge.”\n“I want you to kill the grand marshal and his knights, and if you do, I will give you everything in the kingdom.”\n“…….”\nLeon did not accept the offer quickly. It was too suspicious.\nThe queen, not unaware of this, smiled and whispered.\n“I want you to investigate the castle’s basement, where the grand marshal is hiding something.”\nIt was then that footsteps were heard in the hallways, and the castle was in an uproar. It was the sound of armor and military boots.\n“Your Majesty Lionheart, I apologize for the late hour, but I will open the door!”\nThere was no waiting. It was the grand marshal and his knights who burst through the door.\n“How impolite of you to barge into a royal bedchamber in military style!”\n“……I recognize the rudeness, but the situation is urgent and we have no choice.”\nThe grand marshal apologized and paced the room. Queen Beatrice, who had stood before Leon only moments before, was nowhere to be seen.\n“Hmm…….”\nHe sensed the aura in the room and knew in his gut that the Queen was here but he did not ask Leon if he had met her.\n“I have met the Queen.”\n“Is that so?”\n“The queen of your country went out for a night walk, and you don’t ask.”\n“Because that’s the kind of woman……she is.”\n“Ha…!”\nHow could the knights let royalty go out for a night stroll? Even Leon has knights and guards wherever he goes.\n“You leave royalty alone in this time when demons are on the loose?”\n“……Demons don’t invade at night.”\n“Bullshit.”\nSince when do demons work day and night? There are hundreds of them hiding in the castle right now, disguised as humans.\n“It’s almost as if you’re convinced.”\n“…….”\nThe grand marshal turned to leave without answering but Leon’s words stopped him.\n“The queen says you’re imprisoning her.”\nAt that, the grand marshal and his knights’ gazes sharpened.\n“That is none of your business…….”\n“Lord Burns, you’d better come clean about what you’re hiding.”\nRicardo Burns, the Grand Marshal of the Spero Kingdom turned away as if he didn’t need to answer.\nOnce they were gone, Leon stroked his chin.\n“Suspicious.”\nBoth the queen and the Grand Marshal.\nThere was more to their behavior than just a defense quest against a demon army.\n“In any case, do I need to investigate the basement to get to the bottom of this?”\nBut he wasn’t ready for that now. Leon had to face an army of demons that had begun to move with the dawn.\n* * * *\nAn army of demons marches as the legions of ugly lust that corrupt all things living and fill them with pleasure advance.\n-Transgress them. Cut off their heads and let them see their flesh mocked!\n-Corrupt them, let them have an orgy in the square!\n-Cut up the children and feed them to their parents! It will be a sight to behold!\nThousands, no tens of thousands of demons marched as the air changed before the march of malice that corrupted the living in the pursuit of primary pleasures.\n“Androzin has spoken! He will give a hundred slaves to the first to cross the city walls!”\nA naked soldier who embraced even pain as pleasure shouted as he swung his whip.\n“Kee-hee-hee, let us corrupt the men.”\n“Let’s pickle them with pleasure so they can’t think!”\n“Corrupt them! Corrupt them! With pleasure──”\nAt that moment, the demon at the head of the line stopped, eager to tie up the humans with ropes as soon as possible, but then it saw something and shuddered.\n“What is it, why aren’t you going faster?”\n“You idiot! I’m not stuck behind you-”\nThe first row stops and so does the second row.\nRow three, row four…… All the demons within sight of the city wall stop in shock.\n-Kiyo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!\nIt was a scream.\nNo, the scream itself is familiar to the demons. The problem is the subject of the scream.\n-KIEEEEEE……\nThe agonized cry sounded like the despair before death and the battlefield freezes at the grotesque and ghastly scream.\nThose who are more accustomed to screams than anyone else, those who generate them, turn to their screaming compatriots.\nAt the end of their gaze there were Hunters, holding burning wood but demons were impaled in it.\n“”?????””\nWhat was that?\nWas that torture for demons?\nDemons are spirits, after all and when they die, they just go back to the Garden of Evil…\n“False lives that know no death.”\nOn the ramparts, a cavalryman shines with a brilliant radiance in the light of dawn. His golden sword glistens as if absorbing the dawn’s light.\n“Beasts like worms, driven only by primal needs.”\nThe golden sword decapitates the hanging demon, then the knight picks up the severed head and throws it.\nThe head rolled over two kilometers and landed in the middle of the demons.\nA black soul leaked out of the decapitated demon, the soul that should have returned to its body now that it has lost its vessel──is sucked into the rider on the wall.\nIt didn’t take long for them to realize what this meant.\nThe immortal demons witnessed death.\nThey stare at the demonic butcher who has performed the impossible miracle.\n“Listen, you filthy worms, I, Lionheart, on behalf of the Ten Thousand Gods, will teach your evil servants the value of a single life!”\nCome, lowly things, your terror is here.\nThe demons who have made the material world their playground shriek in terror as the Lionheart King, the very terror of the demons, teaches them the value of life.\nThe fear of death spreads uncontrollably among the lower demons and even the mid-level demons.\nThey’re used to destruction, killing, and terror, but only as doers.\nDemons are less accustomed to fear, as it is natural for them to return as spirit beings when they die.\nThe thought of dying never crosses their minds, so when they see death, they begin to self-destruct.\nThe Legion is broken as the immortal army crumbles at the sight of death.\n“You, you fools, where are you running!”\n“Stop! Don’t run!”\nThe higher-rank demons watched their subordinates crumble with ridiculous ease and tried to stop them. But there were too few mid-level demons to hold them back.\n“Damn the Corpse Harvesters, if only they were here!”\n“Where the hell did the Fallen go!”\nThe mid-level demons that Leon and Yappy had hunted so thoroughly during the night were the middle commanders of the army.\nWith them dying en masse in the middle of the night, there would be a shortage of mid-level officers to whip the lesser demons.\n“You stupid things, get back here──”\n-Bang!\nA mid-level demon that was about to shout out was pierced in the torso by a javelin that flew in from somewhere and without even a chance to scream, the demon was torn up.\nAs he fell, gravity taking over, the last thing he saw was a lone rider charging toward him, wielding a holy sword.\n“Glory to the Lionheart!”\nChasing the fleeing demons, a one-sided slaughter begins.\nOn the third day in the gate the demon butcher began his slaughter.\n* * * *\nThey slaughtered over a thousand demons.\nThe hunters, including Koo Dae-sung and Kim Jin-soo, were skeptical that demons could die so easily.\n“At the end… there was even one who killed himself.”\n“And we can’t even use the Holy Law like His Majesty can…….”\nThe demons’ escape was a spectacle.\nEither they didn’t realize they were fleeing, or they became an abomination, trampling over each other and fleeing in all directions to live on their own.\nAll the hunters did was shoot and kill the fallen demons one by one.\n“These bastards… Your Majesty, is this their first time seeing you? What did they do on the first day?”\n“Well… maybe they didn’t get the word out because they have a big army.”\nJust then, Leon spoke behind the Hunters’ backs.\n“That’s not true.”\n“Your Majesty!”\nThe cruel Lionheart King, who had ordered the torture of the demons to be displayed in plain sight this morning, sneered at their behavior.\n“They’re all selfish and uncoordinated, and only care about fulfilling their own desires, not the good of the group. They calculate what they can gain from what only they know.”\n“Is that all there is to it?”\n“Well, there are some things like that, but the only demon this king killed on the first day was a troll, so there must be some things they didn’t understand in the chaos of the battlefield.”\nKoo Dae-Sung recalled the demons committing suicide to avoid being killed by their own hands and knew they would not rally easily.\n“This is why you captured the demons alive?”\n“That’s right. They do the cruelest things of all, and they have no tolerance for it. Scum maggots are scum maggots wherever they go.”\nLeon added as he stomped on one of the demons the Hunters had captured.\n“Capture them well and drag them away. Their screams will make a good symphony.”\nThe Hunters didn’t tell him that Leon was just an ignorant demon hater who wanted to see the demons suffer as much as possible.\nAh, so our Lionheart King had a deeper meaning!\n“By the way, where did Lord Yappy go? I didn’t see him during the battle.”\n“Lord Spinner is carrying out this king’s orders.”\n“????”\nThe Hunters wondered about that, but chose not to ask.\n‘Torturing demons?’\n‘Biting and killing them.’\n‘The word ‘uncooperative’ gives me the creeps.’\nThe captured demons shuddered.\n“Help me! Help me, my lord!”\nThe demons did not look sympathetic. A few of the Hunters, who had been slightly expecting a demon of pleasure, slapped the demon on the back of the head to relieve their disappointment.\n* * * *\nContrary to the Hunters’ expectations, Yappy’s destination was not the prison.\nYappy had taken advantage of the distraction of the battle to sneak into the depths of Spero castle.\n“Huh? Didn’t something just pass by?”\n“Didn’t you see it?”\nCircling the ceiling upside down and not making a sound above a certain decibel, Yappy easily evaded the soldiers’ surveillance.\nThe occasional sharp-eyed knight glanced his way, but his camouflage was perfect. Yappy made his way to the depths of the tunnels, where he found a group of men.\n“General Ricardo, I know you’re in command of a battle, but what are you doing here?”\nIt was Ricardo Burns, the kingdom grand marshal, and the knights who followed him.\n“The outsiders will take care of that. The problem is the seal. I assume the seal is working well?”\nThe seal, a similar term that Yappy had heard for a thousand years.\nIt was the Yakt Spinner who had sealed the Gem of Wisdom, kept it hidden, and ensured that no one could breach it.\n“Yes, but… no, no.”\nThe soldier shook his head pointlessly as he tried to say something but Ricardo looked past the soldier to check the seal.\nThe cover is lifted and the seal is revealed. Yappy’s wide-angle lens captured it clearly on camera. And──\n-what?\nIt was a surprise, even to the super-intelligent Yakt Spinner.",

      "content": "Chapter 44:\nThe Reality of the Kingdom\nThe first battle was a great victory.\nLeon, along with his Hunters and Kingdom troops, headed for the palace with over a hundred demons in their grasp.\n“Crack!”\nAs the ropes were tied like a bundle of fish, the demons fell.\n“Uh-oh, careful──.”\nKoo Dae-sung was just about to pick up the demon when he saw that it had fallen and realized that the demon was a stunning beauty.\n‘What? Just a moment ago──’\nThe ugly demon’s appearance was nowhere to be seen, and in front of him was a beauty who exuded a deadly charm.\n“Mr. Hunter, if you let me go… I’ll do something nice for you.”\n“Uh, uh, uh…….”\nKoo Dae-sung was confused by the devil’s temptation.\nEven though he knew that the being in front of him was a demon, he stretched out his hand as if he would fall for the temptation.\nIf he could hold such a beautiful woman once… it wouldn’t be a bad idea to risk his life──\n[Aura of the Lion’s Heart: Legion Enhanced Pollution Resistance is activated]\nHe stretched out his hand towards the demon but the colorful beauty’s face disappeared, revealing a hideous one-eyed monster.\n“Ah fuck!”\nStartled, Koo Dae-sung punched the demon in the face.\nThe demon is dumbfounded by the punch.\n“A mere mortal can resist my temptations?”\nThis is the demon temptation? I almost fell for it.\nKoo Dae-sung gripped his fluttering heart, wary of the demon’s power.\n‘What kind of bastard is this!”’\nLeon approached on horseback from the front. His figure, mounted on Stallion, blocking out the sunlight, was very authoritative.\n“What kind of bastard has been making a ruckus?”\n“This bastard!”\nWith a quick change of demeanor, he pointed to the demon who had tempted him.\nLeon’s gaze landed on the demon, and he spoke as if he had seen the whole picture in an instant.\n“How dare you seduce my soldier with your filthy body?”\n“Forgive me…!”\nLeon’s military boot slammed into the demon’s shin and the demon’s leg snapped with a pop.\n“Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!”\n“You filthy, lowly thing, raise your voice!”\nLeon tramples the demon while the Hunters and the other demons watching were appalled.\n‘He’s even more evil than the demons…!’\n‘Ugh, kill him……’\nLeon watched as the demon was trampled to death before he got back on his horse.\n‘I don’t even have enough energy.’\nLeon felt the Grail’s energy sharpen as the demon’s soul was absorbed by it.\nAs the demons self-destructed, he hunted down a number of commanders. Some of them were high-level demons, and Leon had recovered enough power.\nThe citizens were waiting for Leon to return with his captured demons.\nThey welcomed him and his soldiers for their victory, but stared at the demons with fear.\n“…….”\nThe war against demons is always like this. They seduce humans, even if they are lesser demons, and draw them into destruction and corruption.\nThe same goes for their ugly appearance. The war against them is never-ending, and only a select few are inspired by victory.\nIn the Lionheart Kingdom, they pray to God, but the ones here have no one to turn to so Leon raised both hands.\n“Applaud.”\n“????”\n“What?”\nThe gazes of the citizens and Hunters alike are filled with questions. They’ve grown accustomed to Leon’s erratic behavior, but that’s not the point.\nWhen he stops all the soldiers stop and everyone is silent as all eyes are focused on him.\n“Applause! Give glory to the god of war and flame and sing the glory of this Lionheart!”\n“”………….””\nThe crowd was silent for a moment but soon someone began to clap, and it spread like a wildfire.\nThe thunderous applause grew louder and louder, soaring to the heavens.\n“Hang the demons and let the citizens kill them themselves. Let them savor the sweetness of their ugly souls being extinguished.”\n“Yes!”\n“… We have come in triumph, but no one has come to see us.”\nLeon thought of the captains and knights who weren’t present and had many questions but just as he was questioning everything, he saw a red glow from the windows of the castle.\n“It worked.”\nLeon turned back to the castle.\n* * * *\nUpon receiving Yappy’s report, Leon hurried to the castle’s basement along with the Hunters.\n“Stop! This area is not authorized for access──”\nLeon didn’t wait for the soldier to stop him and kicked open the spear-barred door to the basement.\nThe door burst open with tremendous pressure and the soldiers had already been subdued.\n“Your Majesty, is this okay?”\nChief Kim Jin-soo had never seen a gate attack like this before.\nIn essence, gating is all about clearing quests. You just need to clear the gate according to the system message that carefully explains the closing conditions.\nDuring the quest, NPCs will also appear, so it’s important to make them your allies as much as possible but he never heard of a strategy where you just go out and turn everybody against you!\n“……Give up. It’s easier if you give up.”\n“No, that’s not…!”\nThe Hunters, who had already watched Leon’s shenanigans at the Orc Gate, were convinced.\n“Now, wait! Look at these!”\nKoo Dae-sung, who was following in the lead, pointed in astonishment.\nWhere the door to the basement had been smashed open, there was a huge cavity. An unnaturally huge cavity…….\n“What the hell.”\n“There’s a place like this in the basement of the castle?”\nExpecting the worst, the Hunters followed Leon as he walked briskly down the hall, only to be stopped by two knights.\n“King Lionheart, what insolence!”\n“Stay back! We can’t go any further!”\nDespite their pleas, Leon didn’t stop but simply drew his sword.\n“The king’s word. Kneel.”\nInstead, it was Yappy who took action as the steel wire of his secondary arm traveled beyond the speed of sound, capturing the knights.\nTheir hardened swords were instantly severed before the sacred steel wire.\n“The swords…!”\n“You!”\nYappy quickly surrounded the knights, and Leon pulled down the covers they were guarding.\n“Huh…!”\n“Wow…….”\nInside was a frighteningly beautiful woman, sleeping soundly, a work of art rather than a creature…no, a subject that seems to have been created by the devil.\nQueen of the Spero Kingdom, Beatrice Aligieri Spero.\nEven in her sleep, she is deadly beautiful, leading men to their doom.\n“Alas…….”\n“Beautiful…….”\nSoldiers, dazzled by her inhuman beauty, turn to her, drooling.\nSeeing the abnormal behavior Leon realizes they have been dazzled by an irresistible temptation.\n“Resist! Do not be seduced by her power!”\nLeon shouted, but the soldiers reached out to the queen, their minds unable to withstand the power even with the Lionheart Aura.\n‘Should I blame them for their weakness…?‘\nLeon thought and punched Chief Kim Jin-soo in the nape of the neck as he reached out.\nAfter that, the Lionheart King himself had to do the laborious work. One by one, he stunned the soldiers, showing a disappointed expression.\nNo matter how lenient he tried to be, he couldn’t help but compare them to his subjects.\n“Off…!”\n“Hmph?”\nLeon, who was stunning the soldiers, saw Koo Dae-sung break out in a cold sweat, clutching his thighs in pain.\n“Ho~”\nRecognizing the deception, he stabbed himself to force himself to overcome it.\n“Your Majesty…….”\n“Take a deep breath. Inhale through your mouth and exhale slowly. Clear your mind.”\nLeon sprinkled holy water on Koo Dae-sung’s thigh as he breathed slowly and deeply, the restorative power of the holy water regenerating his dagger wounds.\n“Impressive. I didn’t think you’d be able to resist the Queen.”\nGrand Marshal Ricardo and his knights walked slowly toward them, surrounding them.\n“You owe me an explanation.”\n“What explanation can I give to a man who is about to die?”\nKoo Dae-sung was confused by the cold gaze of General Ricardo.\n‘What? Is the General a Fallen?’\nThat would be strange. He and his knights had also passed through the divine flames in the square that day.\nIf they were Fallen, they wouldn’t be able to withstand the flames and reveal their true colors.\n“Do you not plan to defend the kingdom? Without our help, you will not be able to withstand the invasion of the Evil Ones.”\n“I don’t care, even without you.”\n“Hmm.”\nLeon’s calm demeanor didn’t falter in the face of the impending threat. Instead, he looked as cool as if he’d solved a puzzle.\n“So, you guys. I see you’re not dazzled by the queen, are you?”\n“……I’m used to it.”\n“Of course you’re used to it. The queen’s powers are more of a curse than a birthright. I’ve seen one with such power before.”\n‘The Lord of Pleasure.’\nLeon remembered the ugly demon lord of lust he had slain with his own hands.\n“One who seduces all that lives. One who is born to seduce. Demonic pleasures that lead men astray. This queen is such a creature.”\nIt was power beyond even Archdemons, a power no living thing can withstand. It was a difference of spirit, and that’s why countless Holy Knights have sacrificed themselves to defeat the Demon Lords.\n“But it’s strange.”\n“What…?”\n“How is it that this king, who despises and loathes demons more than anyone else, senses no such aura from this queen…how is it that you are ‘fine’.”\nLeon is a demon slayer who has fought demons for hundreds of years. There’s no way he wouldn’t recognize a malevolent aura.\nLeon picks up the Holy Grail filled with holy water and atop the chalice was a black flower.\n“Divinity of dreams and death, your guardian asks for your favor.”\nA ritual that wasn’t full-fledged started but when the one doing it is a demigod, it’s a different story.\n[I will gladly answer the call of the Lionheart King]\nThe violet woman smiles and reveals her spirit form. The divinity descended directly from the souls of countless demons, and its mere presence caused everything around it to freeze.\n“Greetings, Fle, god of dreams and death.”\n[Yes, Arianna’s knight. Master of the Lionheart]\n“Lord of dreams, I have strengthened you as you wished.”\nShe had felt a sense of discomfort since Leon entered the gate and to find out what it was, Fle demanded to personally descend.\nWith the god of dreams and death summoned, it should be a simple matter to reveal the truth of this world.\nThe Goddess declared.\n[Demons of Corruption, they have been at work, performing their rituals of corruption in endless dreams!]\nThe goddess pointed her finger at the captain and the knights.\n[All dreams must end. Show your true selves!]\nThe truth of the world is revealed, centered on a beautiful finger.\nThe world is colored in an instant, like ink on drawing paper and the world, or rather, the dream, is shattered.\n“Huh…!”\nSeeing the transformation and the revealed reality, Koo Dae-sung swallowed hard.\nThe Grand Marshall and the knight of the Spero Kingdom who were once heroes, wielding their swords against evil showed their rotted flesh and gnarled with their bony forearms.\n“De, Death Knight?!”\nThe undead knights who refused to die were revealed.",

      "content": "Chapter 45: The Death Knights\nThe truth of the world shattered by the power of Fle, the god of dreams and death, was devastating.\nThe seemingly living inhabitants of the Gate were dead, and Grand Marshal Ricardo and his knights were Death Knights.\nWitnessing the truth, Leon was exhilarated.\n“Ha! I see why I didn’t notice, I see why I didn’t realize! The power to create the world itself!”\nThe gate itself had been a dream.\n“That’s it…!”\nGrand Marshal Ricardo and his knights awoke to their true selves in the shattered dream, and the creepy aura of the Death Knights was no longer hidden.\n-Do not disturb the queen’s rest.\n-Protect the queen.\nThe hostility of the Death Knights is directed at Leon, and he is puzzled by it, though he takes it all in stride.\n“You are not a Fallen, soaked in malice, then…!”\nLeon’s sword turns to the Queen because as the dream cleared, he felt the aura of corruption from her.\nThe visions of this gate must have originated from her.\nBut Leon’s blade is blocked by Ricardo Burns… the blade of a Death Knight. He deflects Leon’s blade away from the Queen.\n-Eliminate hostiles.\nMuzzles pointed at Ricardo but just then, a Death Knight bumps into Yappy.\n“Lord Yappy?!”\nYappy is pushed back by the Death Knight’s charge but he swings a steel wire with his secondary arm.\nMeanwhile, Ricardo’s blade slashes at Leon with a fierce intensity. The warlord strikes again and again, as if he will never tire.\nHis sword is worn with age and power, and its strength is more than A-grade. But it wasn’t enough to reach Leon.\n-Boom!\nSword clashes with sword, and the struggle begins.\nThe warlord’s sword pulses with power, but Leon’s sword doesn’t show the slightest sign of being pushed back.\n“A fine sword, no, a sword so well honed that even though you’re an undead I do not despise it.”\nBut he was no match for Leon. Leon is the pinnacle of those who have walked the path and Ricardo’s blade is pushed further and further away, until it finally digs into his shoulder.\n“Get out of the way…!”\n“General!”\nWith voices like boiling phlegm, the two knights parry Leon’s sword and Leon’s face lit up with anger at their intervention.\n“How dare you betray the honor of knighthood and interfere in a one-on-one duel!”\nLeon saw the pride in their swords. He felt the honor of knights who walked the path, and that made him even angrier.\n“A scribe’s sword and a knight’s sword must be different!”\nLeon’s words were not lost on Ricardo and the knights’ swords.\n“Honor has long since been forsaken!”\n“For…the Queen!”\nThe cries were unintelligible.\nWere they not the ones who imprisoned her?\nThe queen herself had asked him to kill her knights.\nWait, kill her knights? Why would she make such a request?\nLeon stared at the queen lying on the bed as he passed the knights.\nFor a queen who exuded an aura of blatant depravity and seduced creatures, she was still…….\n‘Not an evil species?’\nAs the dream unfolded, the knights revealed their true colors but the queen still had vibrant skin and beautiful features unlike the demons of lust, who are ugly.\n“What have you done, you bastards! What have you done to the queen?”\n“We made a -deal- with the demons, King Lionheart.”\nThe Spero Kingdom, like Leon’s world, was being invaded by demons.\nIt was Beatrice, now Queen, who led the kingdom’s army against the onslaught of evil. However, she was unable to withstand the onslaught of demons, and the Archdemon of Pleasure, Androzin, reached out to her as she stood on the brink of destruction.\n[Queen, I admire your courage. We’ll make a deal.]\n[A deal…?]\n[Embody the essence of corruption, and repeat the destruction of the kingdom for a hundred years. If you are not corrupted, I will spare you and your people]\nAlready facing destruction, the Queen of the Kingdom had no choice but to accept it, even if it was a demonic trap.\nThe war with the demons recurred every year.\nAt first, it was bearable.\nEven if you were killed by the demons, you would be resurrected the next year and fight again. But they were up against the Archdemon of Pleasure. They humiliated and transgressed the people, the soldiers.\nThey corrupted them with endless pleasure and torture, breaking their minds.\nEven the longest-lived soldier did not last more than three years.\n[I… what have I done…….]\nRealizing what she had done, Queen Beatrice sought a way out, but the devil’s traps were cunning and insidious. There were no loopholes in the deal she had already accepted.\nShe grew madder and madder.\nBy day she had to watch the demons slaughter her people, and by night the Fallen whispered to her.\n[It’s because of you. You’re the reason they died]\n[Be corrupt, embrace pleasure]\nThe sight of her kingdom falling and the essence of corruption planted in her body constantly tempted her.\nAfter fifty years of this, when a loyal knight was finally unable to resist her temptations and infiltrated her bedchamber── Captain Ricardo Burns made a decision.\n[Self-destruction]\nSelf-destruction was strictly forbidden in the world of Repetition. Androgen made no allowance for suicide, even when it was self-imposed or with the help of others.\n[Those who commit suicide to evade the contract will become spirits wandering the Nine Realms forever! At the end of the hundred-year deal, you will become servants of the Fallen!]\nNevertheless, Ricardo Burns and the Thirty-seven Knights chose self-destruction.\nDefend the Queen, and serve her. They knew that the oath they swore when they became knights of the realm could never be fulfilled while they were alive.\nThe queen’s charms did not work on those who had died and become Death Knights, and they sealed her away.\n“Though even that seal was little more than a half-day ritual to put her to sleep.”\n“…….”\nLeon sighed as he listened to Ricardo’s story.\nTheir loyalty surprised even the Lionhearted King. But…….\n“That is why the queen asked this king to kill you.”\nTo prevent her knights from becoming servants of the demons.\n“The queen knows. She knows she won’t last.”\n“No-! The Queen will endure-oh, five more years! Five more years! She will make it through!”\n“How can a knight judge a monarch; your loyalty is admirable, but it is not loyalty!”\n“Thou shalt not judge my loyalty!”\nRicardo’s sword struck with all his might but Leon parried it with one hand.\nLeon stretches out his arms to him, empty-handed. He reaches out with the intention of tearing his head off, but is stopped by a stabbing sword.\nLeon drops his arm and steps back. Behind him, two knights swing their swords sideways.\n-Boom!\nLeon stretches his holy sword back to block and kicks out at the charging Ricardo.\n“You think you can stop me…! Even in a pincer attack!”\nThe power of this monster has been witnessed in battles against demons.\nA monster that has reached superhuman status with its physical abilities alone, even without the Holy Law. A knight among knights. Knight of Knights.\n“Forgive the disrespect!”\nOne of the Death Knights swung his sword wildly. A stance solely for added strength but was too crude for a knight to use.\nLeon didn’t miss the opening. The blade of his holy sword stabbed straight for the Death Knight’s empty side, but──\n-Bang!\nThe Death Knight’s shield blocked Leon’s blade and in the next moment, the Death Knight’s sword swung at Leon.\nLeon barely manages to deflect it aside and a strand of golden hair is cut off.\n‘He’s deliberately showing me a gap to make me attack!’\nA bold move based on the assumption that his fellow knight would defend him.\nLeon could feel the trust in that solidity.\nThe attacks continued and just when he thought he dodged the spear, he was tackled from behind.\nThe Death Knight throws his whole body to push Leon away, not giving him room to swing his sword, but giving his teammate a chance to attack.\nLeon catches Death Knight with a right hook and throws him to the ground and as he raises his sword to deliver the decisive blow, a sharpened spear stabs him.\n-Bang!\nThe sound of impact rang out like a cannon blast.\nHe barely managed to block the spear strike with my sword blade, but his trembling hands couldn’t absorb the impact.\n‘Strong.’\nIf it were the Lionheart Kingdom, they would be able to walk the path of the Holy Knight to uphold the honor of the Goddess.\nEach and every one of them must have been a knight of renown.\n‘Perhaps their abilities have been diminished by becoming undead.’\nKnights of this caliber are known for their refined swordsmanship. Becoming undead might have increased their physical strength, but it would have diminished their refinement.\n“And yet…so capable…excellent!”\nRicardo Burns looked down at Leon from his position at the head of the knights.\n“We are the knights of the Spero Kingdom. Throughout the centuries, we have grown stronger and united!”\nFor the defense of the Queen alone.\nHow can these loyal knights be called a bunch of wraiths?\n“Well done, knights, you have done more than your share of honor and pride. But…….”\nLeon returned his holy sword to the Grail and in his hand, he now held a large jousting lance.\n“Before you is the history of the Three Hundred Years’ War of the Lionheart. Can you bear this weight?”\n“What nonsense…….”\n“Take this weight, and I will recognize you.”\nLeon rode on Stallion as he distanced himself from the Death Knights.\n“Chase!”\nBut the Death Knights have also summoned ghost horses. The ghostly horses roam the land, united in death with their masters, and pursue Stallion.\n“Fast!”\nBut the ghost horses failed to catch up to Stallion. This horse, given to him by the Goddess of Light and Justice, is of a different bloodline.\nThe ghost horses could only stare in disbelief as the white horse closed the distance in an instant. And the moment the distance is closed, the rider’s head turns in the opposite direction. Any knight can recognize it.\n-Charge…!\n-Coming…!\nA cavalryman’s strongest strike. Charging.\n“Glory to the Lionheart…!”\nThe horses pound the ground and with their lances raised the knights charge in unison.\nOne knight and thirty-seven knights but in the moment of contact, the Death Knights realize their fate.\n-Boom!\nThe first collision sent the leading knight flying along with his ghost horse.\nThe second clash did not diminish Stallion’s momentum in the slightest as the Death Knights were sent flying.\n“Kwak?!”\nThe third row of Death Knights had only grazed the god horse, but they couldn’t hold on to their horses.\n-Thwack!\nRicardo raised his sword straight up even as he rolled on the ground. He realized that his opponent’s charge was beyond common sense.\n“No…!”\nRicardo looked around and saw that all of his fellow knights had fallen to the ground.\nIn this moment of shock, he was the only one who managed to pull himself out of the way and withstand the impact.\n“With a single charge… you managed to dismantle the Queen’s Guard?!\nEven his hardened skin quivered at the shock but Leon’s holy spear burrowed under Ricardo’s chin.\n“Awake from your fleeting dream.”\n“The Lionheart King…!”\nWhere did this monster come from, how could such a powerful being appear now?\n“We-I…!”\nHe had not yet extinguished the flame of defiance. His loyalty to repeat his queen’s time and finally save her moved his body.\n“If you can’t wake up from your dream in the end, then live forever in your delusions. Foolish knight.”\nThe spear was about to strike when Leon realized at once that a horde of demons was approaching, with an aura that could not be more sinister.\nThey were already gathering their forces and marching however Leon could have taken care of Ricardo first but he didn’t.\n“Rise up, soldiers of the Lionheart! How long will you remain asleep?”\nThe voice rumbled through the halls and roused the stunned soldiers.",

      "content": "Chapter 46: God of War and Flame\nThe morning’s offensive was scheduled.\nOn the first day of the attack, Androzin flew into a rage when he heard that the demons had been defeated.\n“What? They fled without a fight!”\nIt hadn’t occurred to him that the first day’s fighting would be enough to take the castle. According to the original story, the battle would continue for the next five days before the castle was finally destroyed.\nBut this was the first time they had fallen without even a pretense of a fight. In a hundred years, in 95 iterations of history, there had never been a more humiliating defeat.\n“You cowards!”\nAndrozin’s eight arms danced, and dismembered bodies leapt up one after another.\n-Keeeeeeeeeeeeee!\nThe demons decapitated by Androzin’s were not released into the spirit realm; their souls were absorbed by the blood-stained drums, screaming incessantly.\nAndrozin pitied the men who had died in the night.\nThey were specialized warriors, among the demons of lust, who took pleasure in pain.\nBy the end of the night, they were as good as dead. Leon’s surprise was to blame.\nIn all of history, he was the first madman to run out of the castle and hunt demons himself.\nWhat could the madman possibly want so badly that he would abandon the safety of his castle to hunt demons?\nAndrozin didn’t know.\nHe didn’t realize that the all-night demon hunt was a stress reliever for Leon, who had a panic attack at the sight of demons.\nJust as he was rebuking his men and trying to regroup-─\n“What?”\nAndrozin’s eyes widened as the lush field, the forest, had instantly lost its life and died, though it had technically returned to ‘normal’.\nThis meant only one thing.\n“The queen’s dream…broken?”\nThis world is a world of innate evil, a place that could corrupt any man or woman.\nRepeating the dream, he transforms her into a lustful demon with the essence of corruption.\nFor him, endless despair was necessary, and the remaining five years were the final step to ensuring her submission.\nA dream that was supposed to be broken only after her corruption was forcibly broken?\nSomething had happened and Androzin grew impatient.\n“Damn it! The Queen is supposed to be reborn as the Lord of Pleasure!”\nThat was the order of the current Supreme Archdemon of Pleasure.\nAndrozin led his men and headed straight for the castle. There was little time to gather all the forces, but time was running out.\nReynald and the Wisdom Gen watched on and Reynald whispered softly.\n“Shouldn’t you… go help?”\n[I’m not going?]\nYou little shit.\nReynald swallowed hard.\n* * * *\nLeon, Koo Dae-Sung, and Yappy beat the sleepy Hunters out of their daze and headed out of the palace.\nThe Hunters are dumbfounded as they wake up to find the castle in ruins.\n“What, what, what happened?”\n“Apparently… we went underground and… what happened?”\nLeon doesn’t elaborate on the Hunters’ questions. For now, it was more important to deal with this rapidly changing situation.\n“Demons!”\n“Demons have entered the castle!”\nBut the demons were already over the gates and swarming inside and the hunters couldn’t make sense of it.\n“Damn it, where are the soldiers on the walls?”\n“There are too many of them!”\nKoo Dae-sung shouted to the confused Hunters.\n“Raise your shields…!”\nAt the sound of his voice, the Hunters reacted instinctively.\nClick, click, click, shields mechanically stacked. In an instant, the finished product was ready to greet the demons.\n-Kill them!\n-Destroy!\nThe demons of lust charged naked, their fighting strength not great. But lust demons are great in numbers.\nThe mass of the frontal assault alone exceeds a hundred.\n“They’re big…!”\nThe Hunters withstand the crashing demons and plunge their swords through the gaps in the shields.\n-Thud!\n-Kick!\nThe lesser demons were easily defeated by the Hunters’ swords.\n[Terror of the Demons]\n[Greatest Demon Slayer]\n[Demon Lord Slayer]\nThese three traits amplify the Hunters’ damage to demons. Their attacks take on an antagonistic quality, and demons around them are weakened.\nAdd to that the Lionheart aura and the Hunters’ defense became sturdy as long as the demons came from the front.\n-Kiek!\nThey were coming from the side!\nAt the end of the defense row Chief Kim Jin-soo, holding his shield, felt hopeless as the demons came from all sides.\nBeing surrounded meant quick annihilation.\n‘And yet, no one is moving!’\nEven though he, a B-rank tanker of the Association, was getting nervous, how could these D-rank Hunters remain calm and steady?\nThe reason was the presence of the knights.\n-Nonexistent. Weaponless.\nMinimalist machine guns raining down and steel wires imbued with holy power were swung at speeds beyond recognition.\n“Ki…?”\n“Get?”\nThey didn’t know what had passed through their torso, but when they realized it, a neatly sliced section slid away.\nLeon’s side was the worst. The demons pissed themselves just by glaring at him, their eardrums bursting at the sound of his rant.\nTwo Holy Knights covered both sides of the formation. The blows they unleashed were more powerful than all of the blades wielded by all the Hunters combined.\n-Profit…!\n-Demon Butcher…!\n-Center, center, center!\nThe demons were driven back by the Hunters.\nIt was better to die in the dust and escape to the spirit realm than to be sliced to pieces by the Holy Knights on the left and right.\n“It’s big…!”\n“Why is it so heavy…!”\nThis increased the burden on the hunters and Chief Kim Jin-soo shouted.\n“Protector Shield!”\nChief Kim’s unique skill, Protector’s Shield, a skill that temporarily increases the defense of the entire party by 20%.\nNormally, it’s a skill that benefits only sub-tankers, but the Hunters here are supposed to be tanks.\nAndrozin shouted from the rear.\n“Work, slaves, and revel in the pleasure of pain!”\nAndrozin’s crown glowed with a great dark light. The demons’ eyes twisted grotesquely as they were exposed to the crown’s light. The words… tasted… of deception.\n“Kihihi…!”\n“Kyahahahahaha!”\nThe demons screamed and charged. They threw themselves against the shields and didn’t care if their torso was pierced.\nThey throw themselves with glee, as if the pain has become pleasure.\nHe was overwhelmed and the shield was heavy, and he wanted to throw it away right now, but Koo Dae-Sung didn’t. The hunters did not move from their positions.\n[A soldier’s virtue is to be good at only one thing: to block, and the knight will do the rest]\nThe king commanded them only one thing.\nStand your ground and keep the enemy at bay.\nAnd the knights will crush them.\n‘If we can only hold on…!’\n‘The king will do something about it!’\nThe soldiers stare at their king’s back as he rides to victory, holding on.\n“Let’s go, Stallion!”\n‘His Majesty Lionheart will see this through, just like he always has.’\n“Huh?”\nLeon disappeared from the Hunters’ view as the endless black tide of demons had swallowed him whole.\nAll hope was lost as the black waves were all around him.\n* * * *\nLeon swung his holy sword wildly at the horde of evil before him.\nFive demons screamed at the blow but others quickly took their place.\nThe demons show no sign of fear. Their bloodshot eyes are bloodshot and delirious.\nIt’s a trick the Archdemons of Pleasure have displayed time and time again. It transforms the pain of the horde into pleasure and turns them into pleasure-seeking maniacs.\nLust demons are weak in combat, but with buffs like this, they’re a nuisance.\n‘Insufficient penetration.’\nThe enemy is too numerous and Androzin himself has come to lead the army. The final battle was supposed to be on the last day of the defense but it was brought forward by the queen’s shattered dream.\n‘Can I do it?’\nIf only he had the Holy Knights…or at least an Order.\n‘I can’t blame them for not being here.’\nLeon had fought alone a war against evil that lasted 180 years. It was a matter of life and death for all demons and for Leon. But there was a difference between then and now.\nBack then, he was in a land of divinity.\nThere was faith in the gods, holy power, and the support of all the gods, built up since the beginning of human history.\nBut now faith is lacking, and the only thing he has is his body.\nThe holy arts he practiced for so many years can only be used occasionally, and the holy sword and holy spear have lost their power.\nCould he do it?\n“No! It must be done!”\nLeon’s sword emitted a brilliant light and layers of light cut through the demon.\nFor the sake of the soldiers who watched his back, for the sake of the gods to whom he would give glory and honor.\nEven if he is alone, he must do it.\nThat is why he is the Lionheart King, the sole agent of the gods.\n“For Lionheart–!!!”\nIt was then that a black, magical blade flew out but Leon’s holy sword deflected it; however the deflected blade slashed at Stallion’s throat.\n“Stallion…!”\nLeon falls to the ground as Stallion collapses from the blow. The Grail summoned rushed to repair his wounds, but they were not easily healed.\nThe knight’s fall was an opportunity for the minions and a wave of demons rushed toward Leon, intent on devouring him.\n-Stone strike!\nThe masses collided and the moment of impact was dramatic but with a bang, the demons were bounced back by Ricardo Burns and the Death Knights.\n“Warlord.”\n“King Lionheart.”\nWraiths who cut their own throats in their glory days and are now wandering the netherworld. Royal Guards, loyal to the queen even in death, left her side and are here.\n“Have you awakened from your dreams, knights?”\n“Our loyalty to the Queen remains.”\n“As it should be.”\n“But…if we can make a difference…….”\nLeon smirked.\nHe had long been a symbol of hope, even when the world was being destroyed by evil and even when the gods took refuge in his heart.\nEven the Hunters and the Queen’s loyal knights.\n“Then show me. Live up to the expectations.”\nWhat he had always done against all odds.\n“God of War and Flame, answer my call!”\nA strong voice spoke, a divinity that needed no altar, no shrine, only the heat of valor to answer.\n[Still, they are a liability, a flame that could crumble at any moment without you]\n“Then I will stand before them forever, until the day they can stand up for themselves.”\nStallion fades away as it cries out in disgrace at being summoned back.\n“Thank you, my ally. Rest now.”\nLeon turned to look at the 38 knights protecting him, holding the demons at bay. In their midst, the Lionheart King shouted.\n“I am Lionheart, the greatest rider of Petos, the god of war and flame!”\nAt the raspy cry, the demons writhe in pain, and the soldiers and knights recall Leon’s presence.\n“War! Flame, thy greatest war horseman asks for the flame of war here and now…!”\nEach syllable, each word, carries unbending honor and weight. The flames of war responded to that clarion call.\nIn an instant, the skin-searing heat and roar shook the battlefield with vibrations.\nDemons, knights, hunters…all eyes turned to the center of the flames. In the midst of the divine flames, where demons are consumed by the mere touch, a divinity of a density far beyond common sense emerged.\nIt looked like a fire-breathing bull.\nUnruly and ferocious, they are beyond human comprehension, outside the norm.\nLeon climbed aboard a giant war chariot drawn by two such bulls and grabbed the reins.\n“I, Leon Dragonia Lionheart, greet the Queen’s loyal knights!”\nThe thirty-eight Death Knights with swords and spears lined up behind the war chariot, backing away from the terrorized demons.\n“You are the proud sword of the kingdom of Spero, the shield of the queen! Entrusted with the noble task of punishing the wicked. Knights of glory! Be the flame that purifies evil!”\nThe blazing flames of war burned into the blades of the Death Knights.\nThe flames that burned and purified the unholy recognized them as pure.\n“Follow me.”\nLeon aimed his spear and led the way like usual.\n“We will be victorious.”",

      "content": "Chapter 47: Demon Slayer\nThe Death Knights… The Queen’s Guard have felt the changes that the flames of war have wrought.\nTheir eyes grew brilliantly clear and the hands that gripped their weapons were glued together, unable to be separated.\nThe soles of their feet felt surprisingly light on the earth.\nHow could they have been so clear, so pure, so warm, when they had been reincarnated as dead wraiths?\n“Follow me.”\nThe leading Lionheart King aims his spear.\n“Then we shall win.”\nThe chariot spurs to life as flame-breathing bulls pound the ground with their imposing four legs.\nGhost horses followed, but none could keep up with the bulls and the Lion King.\n“Leading the way alone is dangerous!”\nSpero Castle was filled with a horde of demons.\nThe bulls were certainly imposing, but even so, the moment they crashed into that black wave, it was like a light that would eventually be swallowed up.\nThe Death Knights and Ricardo Burns thought so, but──\nLight cut through the darkness and the blackness, as inky as the sea, was melted by the flames.\nThe bulls’ formidable glares and strength make the spears of the demons retreat, and the flames they breathe burn before their eyes, reducing the blackness to black powder.\nIt was like an excavator unleashed from its speed limit and plowed full speed into a pack of rabbits.\nThe sight of the creatures trampled, burned, crushed, and torn to shreds was almost sympathetic.\nThe following Death Knights realized that the mere mass of demons in front of the war chariot was destined to be nothing more than a one-sided slaughter.\nEven the loud carnage and demonic screams were now relegated to an unpleasant background soundtrack──\n“You insolent bastard!”\nAndrozin shouted in anger, his crown dancing and glowing.\nThe Crown of Desire, the treasure of the Lord of Pleasure, grants the power to turn Androzin’s slaves into death-defying fanatics.\nThe Slaves of Pleasure rushed forward, frothing and bloodshot-eyes, under his power.\nRiding monstrous reptilian beasts with sharp claws and wielding whips, they charge at Leon and the Death Knights, two hundred in number, in fact.\n“Ha…!”\nLeon laughs in disbelief at the things imitating horsemen charge and waving ferocious whips.\n“Do you even know what a cavalryman is, you lowly things? A charge is meant to be made with a spear!”\nNot a spear or a sword but a whip. Even if it were sonic weapons, how could they hold off a horde of spurred knights?\n[【Mightiest Charge】 applies]\nNeedless to say, the demons of lust that get torn apart in the moment of clash.\nFlesh rips and bursts, and torn demons splatter in all directions.\nAndrozin didn’t expect them to hold off that ferocious charge either. But…….\n“What the hell, that one.”\nThey outnumbered the enemy by five to one but they were pierced without stopping them for even a moment.\nHe knew what the Death Knights were capable of. They were brilliant knights, but in the end, they could not overcome the limitations of numbers.\nIf anyone could have turned the tide, it was those bulls. No, it was the man at the front, leading the war chariot.\n“Shoot! Sweep them away!”\nThe demons of lust raised their cannon-like energy weapons they had acquired earlier from the Demons of Wisdom and Exploration as a barrage of fire rained down on the enemy.\n[Ranged Abomination applies to this unit]\nTroop Immunity: Applies the Holy Law <Nullify Arrows> to units under your control.\n{Death Knights (38) become subject to <Nullify Arrows>.}\nThe barrage of energy cannons failed to wound the Death Knights.\nThe Holy Knights’ extreme ranged aversion negates ranged attacks not only against themselves but also against their immediate troops.\nThe flip side of this is that the entire unit loses the ability to use ranged weapons, but that’s not necessary for a charging unit. Only a knight’s valor can shake the battlefield. There is no honor in cowardly ranged weapons!\n“Glory to the Lionheart!”\n[Mightiest Charge] is applied to the unit. [War Knight’s Protection] and [Fear of Evil] are combined.\nTroop Upgrade: Increase Charge Bonus by 400%.\nTroop Upgrade: Increase Charge Bonus by 120%.\nTroop Upgrade: Increase Charge Bonus by 100%.\nTroop Upgrade: Increase the Physical Resistance of your Assault Troops by 35%.\nWeaken Enemy: Demon races have 80% less Charge Defense.\n[Warbulls of Petos grants friendly Legions the trait: <Flaming Sword>]\n[[Greatest Demon Slayer] applies reduced physical resistance, reduced holy law resistance, reduced melee defense, and automatic soul retrieval to all demons in a 1 km radius]\nOver a thousand Demons of Pleasure and Corruption were swept away in an instant.\nThe demons disappeared like falling leaves in the face of an overwhelming breakthrough.\nAndrozin was dumbfounded by the horrific reality before him.\nOnly one person made the Death Knights so strong.\nEven the Death Knights themselves were unbelievable, but what about Androzin?\n“Bastard!”\nEight arms swung their halberds at Leon, who was closing in. The blows slam into the war chariot.\n-Ooooooooooo…!\nThe two bulls roar as the rampaging bulls cut themselves free from the chariot, and one of them crashes right into Androzin’s shinbone.\nThe Divine Beast’s charge brought even the Archdemon to his knees as Androzin’s height of over five meters was instantly lowered.\n‘Not good enough. Where did the Lionheart King go?’\nJust then, a shadow fell over Androzin as the flame-encrusted holy spear rained down on him.\n“Ugh…!”\nAndrozin narrowly avoids it and backing away, he cries out.\n“Slaves, kill him!”\nThere are still thousands of demons around and if they come in waves, even the Lionhearted King won’t be able to withstand them.\n“One minute!”\nThe Lionheart barks out his orders as the Death Knights sweep through the demons with flaming blades.\nIn the circle they create, Androzin and Leon stand face-to-face.\n“Lionheart, are you the one who killed Dothraddon!”\n“Dothraddon?”\nLeon smirks as he summons his holy sword.\n“That oversized, fatty.”\nThe flaming holy sword and lance are pointed at Androzin as Leon declares.\n“That lowly pervert was torn limb from limb and your fate will be the same.”\n“You…!”\nAndrozin threw his halberds with the ability to fly and chase enemies.\nIn response…Leon raised his spear.\n“You rely on the power of magic, not your own strength, and that is why you are weak!”\nLeon hurls the holy spear at the eight flying halberds.\nWhile he despises ranged weapons, he does not discredit ranged attacks.\nWeak conscripts and serfs can wield bows and cannons.\nKnights, however, should not. A knight is disqualified if the wind generated by his sword is weaker than an arrow.\n-Bang!\nThe thrown holy spear deflects the flying halberds. After deflecting three of the eight in all directions, the unabated momentum finally sliced off one of Androzin’s arms.\nOne of his arms was blown off, but Androzin didn’t have time to rage at the pain since a chill ran through his body, making him shiver.\nThe Knight charged through the five blades with his holy sword as layers upon layers of brilliant light glowed, ready to cut Androzin’s throat.\n“Crave!”\nThen, the crown Androzin wore glowed.\nThe Crown of Desire revealed the primal desires of Leon and all creatures everywhere.\n“Oh, no-danger!”\n“Lionheart!”\nOnly the non-living, the Death Knights, are not swept up in that longing but not the living Lionheart King.\nThe Crown of Desire has lulled even their greatest queen into sleep.\nIf the Lionheart King would be tempted even for one second he would die at the hands of the Archdemon.\nAs the dejected Death Knights hastily tugged at the reins, they saw the Lionheart King wielding his fiery holy sword.\n“Kaaaahhh…!”\nHe leaped forward and slashed down, cutting Androzin from the tip of his shoulder to the center of his chest. It was a fatal wound.\n“How, how…! How did you escape the illusion of craving?”\nAndrozin stumbles backwards, clutching his shoulder in pain and Leon gives him a mocking look.\n“Even the Lord of Pleasure could not deceive me, so how can you deceive me!”\nEvery living thing has desires that it craves. How can a man not be tempted by them?\nOnly inscrutable emotion wells up in Androzin’s eyes as he looks at Leon.\n“No, stop him, stop him, stop him!”\nAndrozin begins to fall backwards, panting. The queen has been corrupted, and now he must flee.\nTo die by the sword of a holy-law user would be true annihilation.\nAndrozin immediately opened the Demon Gate, hoping to buy himself some time to escape, but then──\n“”Uhhhhhhhh!!!””\nWith a thunderous roar, two fiery bulls charged in front of Androzin.\n“”Grrr…!””\nAndrozin falls to the ground and Leon holding the holy sword was in front of him.\n“Die…!”\n“Wait…!”\nAndrozin’s shout stops the holy sword in its tracks and he begins to babble incoherently.\n“Coward!”\n” Coward?”\n“It was a duel, and a divine being intervened! You knights are supposed to believe in Justice!”\n“Certainly… it’s not honorable for a third party to intervene in a one-on-one duel.”\n“That, yes!”\n“But.”\nThe holy sword shines brightly and Leon’s expression is determined.\n“I have no honor to show you bastards, for this is not a duel, but a worm extermination!”\n“Damn you, you racist-──!”\nThe holy sword struck down relentlessly, decapitating Androzin. At the same time, the magic of the Crown of Desire was broken, and what the demons of Lust witnessed was the decapitated Archdemon Androzin.\nAs his soul was absorbed into the Holy Grail, they watched in horror.\n-Ah, Androzin is dead!\n-We have to run!\n-Where?\nAt that moment, the demons saw the Demon Gate that Androzin summoned to escape but at the exact same moment, Leon saw it too.\n“Run! GAAAAAAA──!!”\nThe demons collapsed in an instant as they started running through the Demon Gate to save themselves.\nAfter the merciless killing and slaughter, many demons survived and returned. It was a swift response.\n………\n……\n…\n“Great One, the plan has failed.”\n[………….]\n“Great One?”\n[Ahh, this game is such a joke]\n* * * *\nLeon stopped his pursuit as he watched the demons hurl themselves into the Demon Gate, followed by the knights and hunters who had been slaughtering them in the chase.\n“Stop the chase.”\nLeon said calmly at the words of Ricardo Burns, the Death Knight.\n“I had to leave an escape route open. If I destroyed the Demon Gate, you’d probably die.”\n“Uh-why?”\nAt his question, Leon looked at the cadet Hunters, including Koo Dae-sung and Chief Kim Jin-soo, who seemed to be able to kill the remaining thousands of demons with ease.\n“The soldier’s body is exhausted, so we have to stop. Excessive use of force would sacrifice the lesser ones.”\n“Is that so?”\nIf it were Leon alone, he would have prioritized the destruction of the Demon Gate and begun the war against the demons.\nBut he was a commander and had many soldiers to be responsible for now.\nIn this battle, the trainees had done their job, and he couldn’t force them to do any more damage.\n“All captains, report damage!”\nOne by one, the captains came forward at Leon’s shout, their faces grim despite the impossible victory they had achieved.\n“Most of them are injured, but they are recovering thanks to the Holy Grail. But…….”\nKoo Dae-Sung looked at the immobilized men on the shield. Their faces had become familiar over the past month.\n“Six have fallen.”\n“Hmm, so be it.”\nLeon acted like it was no big deal but the response made Koo Dae-sung and the others feel sad.\n“I will pray for them.”\nAs the Hunters looked on bitterly, Leon’s sword was held vertically in front of the bodies of the fallen.\n“War and flame. Here your warriors died an honorable death.”\nLeon drops to one knee. It was a knee he would never bend before the commoners. But for this moment, he is only a priest.\n“May their souls be yours. If they have sinned in life, may they be washed away by the Great Fire, and in death may they be judged for their blazing courage, so that they may feast with the gods.”\nSomething transparent escaped from the bodies of the dead.\nThe souls of the dead Hunters were sucked into the Grail, just as the souls of the slain demons were sucked out.\nHowever, this was not done to crush and extinguish the evil spirits, but as a pious act of welcoming them back.\nAfter the Cataclysm, the religious world lost its power.\nEveryone looked to the gods and blamed them for not answering in the face of this unexplained catastrophe.\nHunters are atheists who have made death and violence their lifelong companions. They don’t seek God, and they don’t rely on God.\nBut now there is a saint who performs miracles before their eyes.\nThere is a priest of the gods who shows them the way to salvation from the dreaded death.\n“Gather the names and families of the fallen and report them to me, for their service will be rewarded by the Temple.”\nHow could that cold, aloof voice be so warm?\nIt was so different from the politicians who emphasized the loyalty and sacrifice of those who died only on the day of the ceremony.\n……………\n…………\n………\n……\n…\n[The gates to the paradise of the gods have been opened]\n-Your soul is of low rank. You will not be allowed to enter Paradise.\n-Your level of faith is low. You will not be allowed to enter Paradise.\n-The level of glory you have given is too low. You will not be allowed to enter Paradise.\n[Absolute effect: Blessed by the Lionheart King]\n-Enter Paradise.",

      "content": "Chapter 48.1: Beatrice the Magician Queen\nBeatrice Aligieri Spero, magician-queen of the Kingdom of Spero, was a renowned saint.\nHer kingdom has been prosperous and peaceful since its inception. It seemed like it would last forever.\nOr so everyone thought until the invasion of demons began.\nThe black hordes, coming from the far west, were at first thought to be a pack of orcs but they were infamous and powerful.\nHordes of filthy lust from faraway realms have destroyed kingdoms in the blink of an eye.\nThe closer the black horde approached, the more the queen realized from the influx of refugees and eyewitness accounts that they were something out of the ordinary.\nThe momentum of the foul creatures would eventually reach the Spero Kingdom.\nOf course, the honorable knights and loyal soldiers loyal to the Queen would meet the invasion as they should.\nThey fought back against the hordes of evil that crawled toward them and the army, led by the Magician Queen herself, gloried in victory after victory.\nThe refugees of the kingdom, who had been defeated over and over again, were hopeful as they watched the queen rally her troops to repel evil but it took less than thirty years for that hope to gradually crumble.\nThey are not a warlike group. They are weak, promiscuous and undisciplined, yet their morale is strangely high and they are strangely energetic.\nThey are a ragtag army of misfits, with no faith or cause, but only the pursuit of sordid pleasures, and they throw themselves fiercely into the fray.\nIt wasn’t until three years ago, when the Archdemon she’d defeated returned, unharmed, that she realized they could not die.\n‘This war… was never meant to be won.’\nThey resurrect even when they die and they willingly throw themselves into the fray because they can’t die.\nThe population on this side is being steadily decimated but they keep coming.\nNo matter how many victories they win, no matter how many demons they slay, they always come back.\nIt was an unreasonable fight and the war went on endlessly.\nHundreds of soldiers, dragged from the crowded battlefields after repelling tens of thousands of demons, were corrupted by horrific torture and pleasure.\nDemons wearing human skins infiltrated the royal castle, corrupting maidens into orgies.\nCults fill the streets, proclaiming that the pursuit of limitless pleasure is salvation.\nThe kingdom crumbled as knights of steel were corrupted, and soldiers defending their country pointed their spears at their families.\nI can’t remember the beautiful, peaceful landscape of my homeland that I once saw.\nI can’t remember the days when the streets were filled with people laughing and playing and looking forward to tomorrow…….\nDoom was coming.\n[Queen, make a deal with me]\nThe highest ranking Archdemon offered her a deal.\n[If you accept the essence of corruption and survive for a hundred years, I will stop invading this world and return it to its original state.]\nHow could she believe him?\nShe didn’t even need to ask.\nThe kingdom had fallen, and all that remained was a castle. In the end, her people, her soldiers, her knights… all of them would be lost in the destruction.\nThe Archdemon’s offer was thoroughly in their favor, but Beatrice had no choice but to accept the demon bargain.\nIt was the only way to protect the people she loved.\n* * * *\nThe demons’ traps were vicious.\nThey repeated the destruction of the kingdom for a year and when the kingdom is destroyed, it goes back to the beginning and repeats the process of destruction.\nIf it were only that, the people would have held on, the soldiers would have held on. But the demons of pleasure and corruption do not kill their subjects easily.\nIn their perverted halls of depravity, they humiliated and tortured them endlessly, subjecting them to the most horrific things a living creature could experience.\nNot even death could save them and those who took their own lives became wraiths who roamed the netherworld endlessly.\nIn the end, they had only one choice, to corrupt themselves and join the forces of evil.\nThe whispers of corruption, with their promise of endless pleasure and immortality, dazzled the proud people.\nAlas, I have failed.\nThe choices I made to save my kingdom have turned my people to evil.\nThe proud queen began to crumble.\nAs she watched her people fall again and again, she realized she would eventually fall.\nIt was no mere amusement that the Archdemon of Pleasure would go to such troublesome lengths to corrupt her.\nIt’s an innate vice that frightens even her, and its colors are corrupting even the most honorable of knights.\nAt this rate, even her knights will be corrupted by evil.\nThe queen hoped to save what remained of her knights. She had broken the pact and fallen, and in return, she hoped to save the few remaining knights.\n“My queen, forgive our disloyalty.”\nWhen one knight finally broke into the queen’s bedchamber, the Great Marshal sealed her underground, killing himself to become an incorruptible wraith.\n“I…I made you this way.”\nAfter decades of regret and exhaustion and a doomed destiny, forced to repeat itself, even though each knew the other’s end the queen wished this nightmare would end as soon as possible.\n* * * *\n[Hidden Quest: Save the Queen and the Kingdom]\nLeon returned to the castle after killing Androzin but the castle of the Spero Kingdom is no longer filled with residents singing of hope.\n“You mean everyone is already corrupted.”\n“Yes-yes.”\nLeon sighed sadly at Ricardo Burns’ affirmation.\nHe had seen so many fallen but the temptation of the demons is hard to resist for ordinary mortals and the prospect of a horrific death that would be repeated for a hundred years would only encourage corruption.\n“There must have been people from the kingdom among the demons this king vanished.”\n“…….”\n“Pity them, but do not forgive them. There is only death for the fallen. This is immutable justice.”\nThe Death Knights did not respond to Leon’s heartless words but there was another question.\n“What shall we…do with the dead?”\nThe Death Knights… the undead are unwelcome everywhere, and rightly so.\nUndead who forsake the life they deserve and seek immortality are despicable.\nIf Leon cannot tolerate them…can they resist?\n“That is not for this king to decide. First we must see the queen.”\nLeon led the Death Knights to the subterranean chamber where the Queen was.\nQueen Beatrice had been sealed to prevent the Corruption from advancing as far as possible but even that had failed.\nLeon gazed down at the sleeping queen, breathing heavily.\n“Fle, how is she?”\nAt his words, a divinity appeared, it was the goddess of dreams and death with hair of purple and violet.\n[It’s a natural talent, one that those filthy malignants covet, and one that could have produced a truly terrifying demon lord]\nIt has been said that she can sway a nation by her looks and demeanor alone.\n[The essence of corruption has been planted, and the evil has been amplified. The corruption is already more than halfway complete]\n“But she was not corrupted; she had the vice of lust, and desired the death of the knights.”\nNot because she hated the knights who imprisoned her, but to save their souls. To protect each other, both the queen and the knights did what they least wanted to do.\nWhat royal or knight would not be moved by this loyalty?\n[Leon, mark this maiden with my sigil, for if she can accept my ritual, she will radiate a divinity that will drive away the essence of corruption]\n“I will gladly accept, for she is a ‘king’ who deserves it.”\nLeon felt a sense of sympathy for the queen.\nHe, too, had spent two hundred years fighting demons and knew better than anyone how sweet its temptations and whispers can be.\nLeon touched the queen’s body, and divinity flowed through him.\nFrom the Pantheon within the Lionheart, he felt the goddess of dreams and death enter her.\nThe next moment, the queen’s eyes opened, revealing purple pupils.\n“You have awakened from your dream, Queen Beatrice.”\n[You have cleared the Hidden Quest]\n-All participants’ ’Corruption Resistance’ is strengthened.\n-You have obtained the Crown of Desire.\n-You’ve obtained the Blade of Longing.\n* * * *",

      "content": "Chapter 48.2: Beatrice the Magician Queen\n* * * *\nThe battle was over.\nAndrozin, the Archdemon of Pleasure, has been destroyed, countless demons have been slaughtered, and most of the demons have fled through the Demon Gate.\nLeon’s side took a hit, too.\nSix of his Hunters were killed in action. For over a month, the Hunters were depressed at the loss of their comrades-in-arms, but were relieved to read the message that their souls had made it to Paradise.\n‘So even if we die… we’ll go to heaven?’\n‘Wow… loyalty.’\nLeon and his gods don’t hide in the clouds. They actively announce their existence and invite faith.\nYou shouldn’t try to trade with the gods, but that’s something they can do on their own to help their followers.\nEven machines, dead wraiths, and unbelievers get a free pass if they have the Lionheart King’s endorsement.\n“Your Majesty, the loot is coming.”\nChief Kim Jin-soo and the Hunters are professional hunters. Naturally, once they cleared the gate, they took the loot.\n“Is this the crown and sword that the demon used?”\nThe crown and sword were tainted with evil, so they needed to destroy them immediately──\n-Bam!\nYakt Spinner approached, his eight legs pounding the ground, and he began to wire up the beak.\n“Is this your favorite?”\n-Heavy metal. Useful.\n“But it is tainted with evil. The blade is supposed to trap souls.”\nLeon understood the nature of the blade Androzin had left behind.\nA soul-trapping blade made to punish even demons. The souls of countless demons are imprisoned within that blade.\n-Geeeeeeeeeeee!\n-Forgive, forgive…!\n-I curse you. I curse.\nJust being in its vicinity erodes one’s spirit.\nHunters who actually touched it would have been tainted if not for the restoration of the Grail.\n-I can handle it.\n“Hmm…….”\nIt was none other than Holy Knight Yappy so Leon nodded and gave him permission to handle it.\nAnd──\n[Lionheart].\nFle, the God of Dreams and Death, appeared in front of them.\n“Huh?”\nThe Hunters froze at the sudden appearance of the goddess but Leon shouted.\n“On your knees, you lowly things!”\n“Aye-aye!”\nThe Death Knights dropped to their knees and the Hunters fell to their knees as well.\nOnly Lionheart stood tall before the Goddess, because he could.\n“Speak, Goddess.”\n[Show me the crown that you have won by slaying the bastard]\n“I am afraid it is a cheap object, and I fear it will stain your eyes.”\n[It is all right.]\nLeon held up the crown of longing and the Goddess examined it carefully.\n“A crown of unusual inherent power. I was going to break it when I regained my strength.”\n[I am not unaware of your intentions, but why don’t you leave this crown to me?]\nFle smiles as Leon tilts his head in question.\n[This crown, you may not remember, is the one common to the Archdemons of Pleasure, whose heads you cut off]\n“Is that so?”\nTo Leon, it was only a sinful morsel. When he cut the throats of worms, what did it matter to him what they wore on their heads?\n[Those ugly demons of lust dazzle the uninitiated with meaningless visions and this crown contains such power. Perhaps I can extract something from it]\n“It was an extravagant object to be destroyed anyway. I’d be happy to give it to you, if that’s what you want.”\nLeon handed it over to Fle without much ado.\n[Thank you, and you have done well this time. The whole Pantheon rejoices and is grateful for your glory and honor. War, say hello.]\n[Greetings.]\nIt was then that a man who looked like he was on fire, a male god, whose searing gaze is frighteningly intense, descended beside Fle.\nIt was Petos, the god of war and flame.\nThe Hunters and Death Knights felt their very existence crushed by the appearance of this fierce deity next to Fle.\n“Ugh, ugh, ugh…….”\n“Ugh…!”\nFor the criminals, the presence of a divinity is as much pressure as a spirit body.\nWhat about the Lionheart King that can stand tall under such pressure?\n“Dream and War, I have one request.”\n[It’s been a long time since I’ve seen your face, and you’re asking me out of the blue]\n“I apologize.”\n[What is it?]\nLeon glanced at the Death Knights and saw the Queen still sleeping among them.\n“I beg you, accept their souls.”\nThe gods did not listen in vain to the Lionhearted King’s request.\n[They have broken the cycle of life and death.]\n[You are too rigid, War. The power of death is mine so it’s none of your business.]\n[What kind of god authorizes the undead?]\n[That’s right.]\nThe Goddess of Dream and Death looked at the Death Knights. By nature, she should not tolerate their existence.\n[The knights who defied Death are beings I should punish, for they are outside the cycle of death]\n“Please…forgive me.”\nAt that moment, the queen opened her eyes with difficulty. She was barely holding on to her sanity amidst the essence of corruption raging within her body and the divinity of Fle trying to drive it away.\n“Your Majesty…!”\nThe Death Knights knelt before the Queen. These loyal knights were concerned for their queen’s well-being, even in this moment when their fate was being decided and Beatrice could not turn away from this noble spirit.\n“Alien divinity…the queen of a lowly nation asks you at the risk of her life…….”\nThe loyal knights have defended her for 95 years so the Queen would bend any pride for the peace of her knights.\n[Hmm…….]\nFleur was torn between the plight of the queen, the knights and Leon’s request.\nThe undead are a blasphemy against death, and to allow them into Paradise is blasphemy itself.\n[Loyal knights of the queen, no one in the pantheon can admit your souls to Paradise]\n“……Yes.”\nRicardo Burns and the other Death Knights had already made up their minds. They want only one thing, the Queen’s safety.\n[But. your merits cover your faults, your integrity impresses the gods, and above all, the Lionheart King has pleaded for your souls to me]\nFle proposed an alternative.\n[I cannot admit you to Paradise, but I will give you a chance at reincarnation, a chance to cleanse your tainted souls and be reborn anew]\nIt was a mechanism for souls who were unworthy of paradise.\nEven sinners have the opportunity to purify their souls and be reborn but the deeper the sin, the more often it is lost in the purification process.\nBut the sins of the Death Knights are not heavy, and they could endure.\n[But, Queen and knights, the Underworld of your realm is not functioning properly due to the lack of divinity in the land]\nFor now, the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods and all things related to it were being run solely by Leon’s Lionheart.\nBut reincarnation can only function when there is enough faith in the land.\n[Queen, become my priestess, and help the Lionheart King spread the faith across the land, for it is the only way to bring rest to the souls of your knights]\nBeatrice bowed her head willingly.\n* * * *\n“Then, Your Majesty, we will go through the formalities with Her Majesty Queen Beatrice.”\nIn the aftermath of the Fluctuation Gate, the Hunter’s Association rallied all the Hunters they could muster and prepared for the Dungeon Break.\nThat lasted a week when Leon finally cleared the gate and returned home.\n“Wow…….”\n“Another survivor after the Yakt Spinner.”\n“Pretty…….”\nIt’s not often that a survivor returns from the Fluctuation Gate.\nAssociation president Oh Kang-hyuk registered Beatrice as a survivor at Leon’s request and also expressed his condolences to the deceased Hunters.\n“We express our sincere condolences to the hunters for their sacrifice.”\nSix Hunters died and under normal circumstances, Leon’s graduation ceremony would have been a colossal failure.\n“But this was a fluctuation gate that became a red gate and an Archdemon was present so it’s a miracle you made it out with this much damage.”\n“I’m sure Lord Spinner has the details, but I also need to meet with the families of the warriors.”\n“In person?”\n“They were one of this king’s few soldiers. It’s the least I can do.”\n“You can’t do that………It could end badly.”\nMourning the dead is always emotional and the president of the Association worried that the families of the fallen might try to get back at Leon.\n“It’s not that I don’t understand the wives, parents and children of the dead but they will be relieved to hear this king’s story.”\nThese were souls that Leon had personally blessed and guided, and they would be relieved to know how they would be treated in the paradise of the departed.\nThose who have lost loved ones will be cared for by Leon’s Guild, which is the Lionheart Kingdom’s way of honoring the fallen.\n“Release the video and summon more Hunters. The Evil Ones will eventually invade your world, and we will need soldiers and knights for that day.”\n“…….”\nAssociation President Oh Kang-hyuk has already seen the video of what happened inside the gate.\nThe Demons of Pleasure and Corruption have been seen in Mexico and other places in South America.\nThe city they corrupted in that poorly governed South American country was eventually nuked.\nOh Kang-hyuk had seen the deeds of those filthy, lustful demons time and time again on record.\n“Your Majesty, your power is optimal for dealing with demons, isn’t it?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then…….”\nOh Kang Hyuk told him about the upcoming Association-wide schedule, and Leon gladly accepted.\nAt the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods compound in the Naju Plains.\nThe events of the Fluctuation Gate and the cadets’ graduation ceremony were not yet finalized, but Leon had an urgent need for ‘help’.\nThe people of this world could not help, only the strength of faith, built up to this point, could get him there.\nLeon closes his eyes and allows himself to fall into a coma.\nIn his spiritual state, he sees a purple goddess staring at him.\n[Try to take my hand]\nTouching the glorified jade body of a deity is a familiar experience for the Lionheart King. Drawn to the goddess, he turns to his heart.\nThe temple of all the gods is enshrined in the Lionheart, the only one item that generates its own holy power.\nIt was a place granted to Leon alone among mortals since the dawn of the Age of Gods: Paradise of the Gods.\nThere were those who waited for him before the magnificent shrine.\n“Welcome, Your Majesty.”\nThere was a woman with long brown hair and a cotton robe but she had a divine radiance about her that could not have come from a mere mortal.\n“Anak.”\n“The servant of a lesser god meets the agent of the gods.”\nLeon stared at the multitude of people behind the kneeling saint’s back.\nEach and every one of them a servant of the gods who had reached the pinnacle of their mortal existence and deserved to dine with the gods in the Great Hall.\nAncient Lionheart Kings, Great Holy Knights, sages of the forest and champions of the gods.\n“”Welcome, greatest Grail Keeper.””\nIt was a paradise created by the gods for mortals and in the center of that temple, the heroes and believers bowed before him.",

      "content": "Chapter 49: Paradise of the Gods\n“Anak, it’s been a while. Is paradise comfortable?”\n“Thanks to your Majesty’s protection.”\nAnak Prothesia, High Priestess of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods, stood with Leon until the final battle, when she fell at the hands of demons 180 years ago but she was not alone.\n“Lord Gildus, Sir Antoine, you’re all good.”\nGildus the Holy Knight, Belton the legendary ogre slayer, and──\n“Your Majesty.”\n“Emperor.”\nArgent Majesty Lionheart, Leon’s ancestral Lionheart King.\nSuch legendary heroes stood before Leon.\nUnlike those who lived and died in ordinary lives, they lived lives of honor and glory and went to be with the gods.\nThis was their paradise. Heaven and hell in earthly terms.\nThe afterlife, which, according to the Book of Ten Thousand Gods, is divided into a resting place and a place of soul purification.\n“New souls must have come here, have you heard any rumors?”\nLeon asked, referring to the dead trainees at the gate and Argent Lionheart said.\n“The first new souls in 180 years. Rest assured, they are welcome.”\n‘Indeed.’\nNormally, entering the afterlife is a taboo for the living. But for Leon, who represents the gods of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods, it was permitted.\n“Ordinarily, I would greet the gods of the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods and seek to resolve this dispute, but the situation is urgent. I must borrow the wisdom of the ancestors.”\n“I will give you my friend Petelion.”\nThe horse offered by the Ancestral Lionheart King of Argent was a stately, muscular black horse. The only difference was that it had wings.\nPetelion, a celestial horse that only a few of the Lionheart Kings had ever handled, had died fighting a Demon Lord alongside the Argent Lionheart King.\nLeon rides him and floats into the vastness of the sky.\nIn this paradise of the honored, the steeds that served them in life also live on.\nAs he rides across the open meadows, many knights’ steeds recognize the king’s and bow their heads.\nPerhaps someday he and Stallion will ride through this place.\n‘No, not now, not without leaving a legacy.’\nLeon sees this paradise as the last bastion of the gods, a community of shared destiny. As such, he allowed himself many of the taboos imposed on mortals.\n“Over there, Lord Petelion.”\n-Purrrr!\nUnderstanding Leon’s words, the pegasus landed in the middle of the forest at the mouth of Paradise and the dark forest shook as he landed.\n“Lion…Heart.”\n“The rightful Archduke of Dragonia.”\n“Lord of the Sacred Objects.”\nThe voices echoed throughout the forest, and one need not look far to see that the dense giants around them were all Sages.\n“I apologize for trespassing on your territory, Sages of the Forest.”\n“To you…….”\n“To the Lion King.”\n“All living things… are indebted.”\n“Even the gods.”\n“You need not be polite. The forest always welcomes you.”\n“Honorable, descendant of a dragon slayer.”\n“Heir to the lion’s heart.”\n“For what purpose?”\n“To visit- the paradise.”\nLeon was pleased with their reception and mouthed the name of a sage.\n“I wish to meet the youngest sage among you, my friend Gunnar.”\nThe forest moved and one of the sleeping giants stirred, revealing its features through the rough bark.\nThese forest spirits, called Tree Men, are the awakened selves of the oldest trees.\n“Leon. My old friend.”\nGunnar the Tree Giant was Leon’s traveling companion from his days as an acolyte, and a comrade-in-arms in the Last War.\nHe bent down to his roots, over fifteen meters tall, and locked eyes with Leon.\n“What brings you to me?”\n“I need your seedlings.”\n“Hooo…….”\nTree men who have risen through the ranks to become Sages of the Forest are given the opportunity to plant a “tree”.\n“You did not plant a seedling before you were laid to rest in the arms of Paradise so you must plant a seedling of your own.”\n“Is it…urgent?”\n“This world, Earth, this king’s home world, is being invaded by evil species. This expedition has shown me that their plot has reached alarming proportions.”\nLeon remembered the Daemon Gate in Queen Beatrice’s Spero kingdom.\nA gate tampered with by someone and a kingdom where the demons of pleasure ran amok meant one thing.\n“They have sensed my presence and have begun to play tricks on me. They must have infiltrated this world as well.”\n“Just like the Empire….”\nWhat makes demons so terrifying is not their strength, nor their infinite resurrection. It’s that they corrupt humans, rotting them from the inside out.\nTheir ghostly movements had to be stopped, at least where Leon was active.\n“You’re the only one alive who can take these things from the Underworld, and that’s good. I can trust you with it.”\nGunnar gladly handed Leon his seedling. The tiny seedling, barely ten centimeters tall, looked fragile, as if it could snap in the wind.\n“The moment you plant this, you’ll attract the attention of the evil ones. It’ll be dangerous.”\n“I’m prepared for that.”\nAccepting the seedling, he hurried back to the temple. This was the world of the dead and no good could come for the living to linger among them.\n“It has been a pleasure to see you, my old friend.”\nGunnar’s voice echoed through the forest.\n* * * *\nLeon was about to return with Gunnar seedlings.\n“Lord Leon.”\n“Sir Gratas.”\nHoly Knight Gratas, the Giant Slayer, is a Holy Knight two generations older than Leon and a friend of Leon’s mentor, Sir Gordic.\nHe is also the author of the Holy Knights’ army training manual.\nBut that was not all. Saint Anak and the 13th Lionheart king, Argent Majesty Lionheart also came to him.\n“What can I do for you all?”\nLeon asked, and Argent spoke for them.\n“After much discussion, I have decided to give you something you need right now. In this world, there are limits to holy power, so there are limits to what you can do.”\nKing Argent Lionheart placed a set of reins in Leon’s hands.\n“This is…….”\n“The reins of a master trainer who can control even illusory beasts. When I died, I entrusted them to you, and you buried them with me.”\n“Hmmm…….”\nLeon knew the value of this treasure, which is why he wanted the Lionheart King to hold the reins as he rode through the paradise of the gods.\nFor no soul can take possession of a treasure once it has passed into his possession.\n“My turn.”\nHoly Knight Gratas approached and handed Leon a book.\n“What is this?”\n“I have heard that you are training your soldiers from scratch. As King Lionheart, I imagine it must be frustrating to not have the elite of a proud kingdom.”\nThe book Gratas handed him was no ordinary book. It was carefully woven from leather, and reeked of holy power.\n“It’s one of my lifetime’s worth of training tips, and I hope it helps.”\n“How to Catch a Giant with a Serf…? Isn’t it a training manual from the legend of Lord Gratas, something so valuable?”\n“Hehe, no big deal.”\n“Indeed, a book compiled by the legendary Holy Knight is a holy relic in its own right. I was skeptical since it was only a story, but are you saying that you really captured a giant with serfs?”\n“Three hundred of the five hundred died.”\n“Who cares about the lives of serfs?”\nRather, it was the effective use of those barbarian bums that was the achievement.\nAs he held the gifts from King Argent Lionheart and Gratas, he was approached by Saint Anak.\n“I will give you my necklace.”\nThe symbol of the Lionheart Kingdom is a necklace shape of a crossed sword and Leon knew its value better than anyone.\n“The holy relics of saints are treasures that can only be passed on through saints. How can I receive this?”\n“Who would argue with the Acting High Priestess of the All-Seeing Eye? It will protect you before the Holy Sword’s restoration.”\nLeon hesitated for a moment before accepting her gift. Tradition requires flexibility in times of crisis.\nAnak holy object would only be used once, but it would be of great help at a critical time.\n“Thank you, everyone. I will put your gifts to good use.”\nAnd with that, Leon returned from the paradise of the gods to the realm of the living, carrying a seedling, a holy book, and a treasure.\n* * * *\nWhen Leon opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was the items in his hand.\nThe holy book of Lord Gratas, Grail Knight, the reins of the 13th Lionheart King, Argent, the holy relic of Anak, Saint of Light and Justice, and finally, the seedling of the sage Gunnar.\nThe other treasures were precious but Leon needed to find a place to plant the Seedling of Gunnar as soon as possible.\n‘The President of the Association will send new trainees. I will train them and finish a minimum unit.’\nRecruiting more soldiers is not the only issue. If soldiers are support, knights are the mainstay. The Association president has presented a great opportunity, but Leon didn’t have enough knights right now.\n‘For him…….’\nLeon turned from his seat and headed for a room in the Ten Thousand Gods compound. He knocked on the door, a rare practice for him, and waited for the other party to respond.\n“I am King Lionheart, will you allow me to visit?”\nThere was no answer, just the door opening of its own accord, waiting for him to enter.\nLeon would have gladly walked through this door. But he didn’t.\n“You won’t come in?”\n“Because you won’t let me.”\nThis is how Leon shows respect. You don’t go into the bedroom of royalty uninvited.\n“You’re a proper gentleman, come in.”\nLeon crossed the threshold of the queen’s bedroom. And…he notices that the air in the room has changed.\nJust breathing in the air made him dizzy, it was a power of corruption that seduced the rational…nay, the living. Although not as much as before, still, a man would have her at the drop of a hat.\n“Queen Beatrice, I apologize for keeping you here in such humble quarters.”\n“It’s nothing for an exiled queen, Your Majesty Lionheart, and I hope you’ll just…forgive my rudeness.”\nEvery gesture was deadly.\nIndeed, the next Lord of Pleasure was an ill-fated talent, not that she can help it.\n“The divinity within you is suppressing the essence of corruption… but not completely. For the time being, we must balance it.”\n“Divine power…Your Majesty does indeed possess much power.”\n“The gods love me and a king as beloved as I am can do many things.”\nBeatrice smiled at his unquestioning assurance and he handed her some wine. It was a tribute from the Association, but Leon was not much of a drinker.\n“Is this a farewell drink for the knights?”\n“Because it’s all I can do.”\nBeatrice stared at the crimson liquid in her goblet with a weary gaze.\n“Couldn’t your majesty have had them as vassals?”\nThe Death Knights may be ghosts, but they are not without power.\nIf Leon hadn’t sanctified their souls on the spot-no, if he’d made the knights his servants on the condition of sanctification-who could have refused, the Queen or the Death Knights?\nIn all the wars of history, each Grail Knight ascended, one by one, as they were destroyed by evil ones.\nLeon could have done it but he didn’t.\n“To use the dead is an affront to them. How could I dishonor them and take advantage of their ghosts?”\n“Even if the end is destruction?”\n“Then I will ascend with honor.”\nWhat an old-fashioned, upstanding man.\nBeatrice knew the difference between this alien Lion King and herself.\nThe Lion King refused to compromise even in the face of destruction and demanded justice.\nThe victor is not the wise one, but the one who stays true to his convictions, is the difference between her and himself.\n“You’ve been in this world for two days. Have you adjusted?”\n“I think I’ll need more time. This is…different from my world.”\nBack on Earth, Beatrice was eagerly guided and introduced by the Association staff and realized that it was a very different world.\nThe internet, cars, airplanes…all of these things are shocking to her. Leon was an inhabitant of a world not unlike her own.\n“You don’t have to adapt.”\n“Why?”\n“We are proud and follow our own laws. A king must enforce his rule wherever he goes. The lawless ones simply follow the king’s path.”\n“The mindset of an invader?”\n“Not quite. To benefit the people through righteous teaching, it is the enlightenment of the Lionheart King.”\nBeatrice smiled bitterly at the man’s shamelessly enormous confidence. Well, at least he could handle the insanity of fighting demons for hundreds of years.\n“I’m guessing demons aren’t the only thing you’re up against.”\n“Indeed. This king has a noble quest from the Gods of Heaven and Earth.”\nLeon patted his chest and addressed the queen.\n“Therefore, I ask you, Magician Queen of the Spero Kingdom, to join me in this king’s cause.”\nBeatrice knew that Leon had triumphed over the demons in the end, so much so that they feared him.\n“I am indebted to you, and how can I not repay you?”\nBeatrice covered her chest and bowed respectfully. It was the least she could do for the benefactor who had saved her and her knights.\n“But there is one thing.”\nThe queen’s violet eyes glowed darkly.\n“Teach me the power to destroy the Archdemons of Pleasure.”\nThe Queen has lost her kingdom.\nHistory has repeated itself for a hundred years, and all but the most loyal knights have fallen.\nThe queen of a ruined kingdom was unable to fulfill her duty to protect it and her only remaining duty is to seek revenge.\nKnowing her intentions, Leon gladly accepted the offer.\n“I’ll do anything to kill those filthy parasites, and it thrills me to see their souls extinguished by the holy arts they fear.”\n“……Uh-oh.”\nIndeed, the Holy Law, the only way to destroy a demon, was what Beatrice coveted.\n“In my kingdom, demons are executed by boiling them in a cauldron. They keep coming back to life, so it makes sense to traumatize them.”\n“Wise, for they are selfish and filthy. Have you ever driven an awl under a demon’s nail? That’s when they scream the loudest.”\n“I’ve skinned them and rolled them in a field of nails.”\n“Hahaha, that’s very creative.”\nThe two deepen their conversation.\n“Hahahahaha……!”\n“Hoo hoo hoo hoo…….”\nThe demonic butchers’ laughter spreads, merry and eerie.",

      "content": "Chapter 50: Lord Yappy’s Big Data\nHa-ri starts her mornings early.\nShe wakes up at the crack of dawn, does a light workout, and eats a fried egg with ketchup.\nHer morning routine is pretty conscientious for a modern person. Ha-ri hasn’t seen anyone get up earlier than her since her orphanage days.\n“Ah, Your Majesty, have you had a good morning?”\n“Yeah.”\nBut Leon’s mornings were much earlier than Ha-ri’s. Never one to go to bed early, he was up before the morning chickens crowed.\nHe rises and swings his sword mechanically. Although he never breaks a sweat in battle, what kind of intense training does he have to do to break a sweat?\n“You’re an early riser, I see.”\n“Morning, Your Grace.”\nA ghostly woman in a black dress, her face hidden by a veil.\n“Have a seat, Queen.”\nLeon offers her a seat and the two casually sit down on a bench in the training center.\n“Make us a cup of tea.”\n“Yikes!”\nHa-ri blushed and prepared a teacup for both of them.\n“Your Majesty, would you like green tea or barley tea?”\n“Hmm, my queen. Black tea would be proper, but these people don’t know how to make tea.”\n“As long as it’s hot, she’s fine.”\n“I’ve been neglecting, but I’ll have to hire a maid after all. Han Ha-ri.”\n“Ah, yes!”\nLeon said, gracefully drinking the barley tea Ha-ri offered.\n“You may attend to Queen Beatrice for now. I don’t care about your luggage, but I want you to dress and behave appropriately for the queen.”\n“Ha… yes.”\n“It is not necessary for you to go to such lengths.”\n“No. Royalty must be properly attended to and cared for.”\n“Then… Did you say you were Miss Ha-ri?”\nThe queen’s veiled gaze turned to Ha-ri.\n“Ah, yes!”\n“I sense an intense aura of fire coming from you, and if you don’t mind, I’d like to take a look.”\nDid she recognize her unique skill?\nThe queen’s unexpected suggestion caught Leon off guard.\n“Very well, then, draw your sword. You’ve been carrying the load, and you deserve it.”\nLeon hands over the sword, as if she’s honored to be taught by king Lionheart himself.\nHa-ri hesitantly took the sword.\n“Where did your swordsmanship come from?”\n“I learned it from my master at the Academy. I’ve heard that he was a promising swordsman before the Cataclysm.”\n“Show me your swordsmanship. I’ll take a look.”\n“Yes!”\nHa-ri gripped the wooden sword and stood as Leon instructed.\nAs a recent graduate of the Hunter Academy, she hadn’t had much training and what she had learned was basic swordsmanship so there was a gap in her skills compared to the arcane skills that the Ten Guilds kept hidden.\nRejecting the offers of the Ten Guilds in the draft, Ha-ri had to develop her own swordsmanship on her own.\nHa-ri swings the sword as she imagines a swift, loud blow that slices through space.\nHa-ri was a prodigy…the youngest Rank A Hunter but Leon looked at her sword swing and said nonchalantly.\n“It’s a big move.”\n“……Yes.”\nIt was fast, but that’s all. A fast sword that relied on physical ability has many gaps and a large range.\n“That’s assuming you use your abilities.”\n“Well, yes, sir. You recognized it right away, didn’t you?”\n“Because I saw it when you fought that honorable knight at the Hunan Gate.”\nLeon remembered fighting the Dulahan.\n“Watch this king closely. Swords are meant to be swung hard, but in short bursts.”\nLeon takes up the sword himself, assumes a top stance and strikes down with a light, quick slash.\nIt seems light and simple at first, but the movements are small and unassuming. He had such skill that even the queen admired it. And then──\n-Kwazik! Kwazik!\nSharp sword winds scraped the floor and cut through the outer walls. It was a terrifying sword wind that would tear the entire training center apart with just a little more force.\n“It’s easy enough, try to imitate it by swinging the sword ten thousand times a day.”\n“Ugh…….”\n“And then there’s the Blessing of Fire, which requires you to swing the sword with all your might to maximize its power. Demonstrate it once more by using it.”\nHa-ri’s unique skill, Blessing of Fire, gave her heat resistance and the ability to convert magic into fire.\nIt requires a medium, and in the hustle and bustle of battle, it’s most efficient to use a sword as a medium to ignite the fire and swing it with full force.\nWhen combined with her own unique skill, Blessing of Fire, Ha-ri’s swordplay was quite colorful and convincing.\n“Beatrice, what do you think?”\n“Her use of fire is immature.”\nThe queen stood up and drew her sword. It was a sword from the royal family of Spero.\n“The only way to use fire with swordsmanship is to imbue the sword with fire magic.”\nThe queen snapped her fingers, and fire leapt from her sword. It was a fire created by magic.\n“Fire is a fragile power,” she said, “it must be compressed, not scattered.”\nBeatrice’s words were true, and the fire in her sword was compressed to the limit.\nUnlike Ha-ri’s fire, which quickly scatters around the sword, hers clings to the blade, unbroken.\nHer movements as she demonstrated with the fire sword were as beautiful as if she were dancing, causing Ha-ri to let out an involuntary gasp of admiration. Just then──\n“Releasing the compressed fire is a deadly move. Just like this stab──”\nThe sword soared towards the sky and in the next instant, a fiercely spinning flame shot out like a cannonball, tearing a hole in the clouds.\n“Eh…….”\nA hole in the sky…Ha-ri stared dumbfounded at the sky above her.\n“Compressed fire doesn’t leave flesh behind, you just have to compress it to a high enough temperature to turn it into ash, easy, right?”\n“…….”\nNot easy.\nHa-ri had been taught by some of the greatest minds in the world, but the words of geniuses were hard to understand.\n* * * *\nThe new cadets have arrived.\nThe Association has announced the achievements of Leon’s first class of cadets and promoted them all at once.\n-Really, all those Ten Thousand Year D-ranks just got promoted to C-rank?\n(TL Note: They’re mocking the hunters who were stuck to D-rank for a long time)\n-You saw the video, it’s insane.\n-I can’t believe the D’s survived that long against the demons and in a Fluctuation Gate too.\nThe video of the first class’s graduation ceremony also played a role.\n“Yes, I learned a lot.”\n“It’s been really… rewarding.”\nThe trainees were sincere.\nFor many of them, Leon was a salvation from the horrors of D-rank and death but Yappy, who’s filming the ceremony, cuts the interview and then gives instructions again.\n-Above average text content. Squeeze every last bit of vocabulary out of him.\n“……No, even if you tell me to extract it.”\nMachine gun pointed.\n“I will.”\n………\n……\n…\n“The cadets who have passed with distinction will be rewarded.”\nSeven of the forty-three trainees who completed the ceremony were presented with enhancers refined from the heart of an Orc Warrior.\nIt was a valuable item that ordinary D-rank Hunters would never be able to afford. The recipients were Hunters such as Koo Dae-sung and Kim Do-han, who had actively demonstrated their judgment in battle, which also drew the enthusiasm of many Hunters.\n-What in the world, giving a mere D-rank Hunter the Heart of an Orc Warrior?\nEven mid-tier guilds give it to up-and-comers!\n-Well, this is one hell of a lucky break.\nThe training was great, and the treatment was great. Even the guild members who have become official soldiers are given blessed crops for free.\n-Wow, I’m so happy.\n-The Ten Thousand Gods Guild is the best.\n-You should all join the Ten Thousand Gods Guild. His Majesty Leon is a good man, and treats everyone well.\nI didn’t say that because of the machine gun behind the camera.\n“Whoa~ I have to report to the chief and the president of the Association……I have to feed the new trainees potatoes and sweet potatoes…I have to change the armor, but where do I get a blacksmith…….”\nLeon is not the type to sweat the small stuff. He considers it a disgrace to do such chores, so naturally, he has other people do it instead.\n“Taxes! What do I do about this?!”\nThere was that too but Leon still refuses to pay taxes. The king can’t pay taxes, he said.\nThe Association has been doing things in a way to accommodate him as much as possible.\nFor example, rice delivered from the Naju Plain is refunded and treated as tax.\nIt also took coordination with the local military government to ensure that the majority of the taxes were used for the benefit of the residents, as per Leon’s instructions, amidst a ridiculous tax rate of 90 percent within the Ten Thousand Gods Guild.\nThey couldn’t just build facilities for the residents’ convenience with private capital.\n“Ugh…accounting is not my specialty…….”\nHa-ri’s head hurt. She had learned how to pay taxes at the Hunter Academy in Korea, but this was out of the question.\nHa-ri was carrying snacks for the Hunters as she wrapped her head in her hands.\n-Ha-ri?\n“Lord Yappy?”\nYappy was hovering on the hallway ceiling, defying gravity.\n“What a surprise…….”\nWhenever she sees Yappy in the dark, it makes her jump.\n-No accounting?\n“Huh?”\nIt was an unexpected comment from Yappy, who must have heard Ha-ri talking to herself.\n-Wanting to share accounting duties to increase efficiency.\n“Lord Yappy……!”\nThat’s right. The Ten Thousand Gods Guild had an all-around Holy Knight, Lord Yappy!\n“Well, we also need to account for expenses and pay taxes, and I’ve been to the accountants, but ‘I don’t pay taxes’ is a stretch.”\n-Big Data Notes. Hunter Applying the Special Administrative Law. Can process hunter meal expenses. Registered to produce own equipment.\n“What?”\nHa-ri remembered that last month, the trainees had only spent 38,000 won on sugar and salt but in the accounting, it was registered as 38 million won.\nIt wasn’t stealing, it was accounting manipulation.\n“Well, there must be something wrong with that?”\n-Not wrong. Crop prices in the Naju Plain skyrocketed. Utilizing the special support type of the Agriculture and Fisheries Act. Purchase tax credit.\n“So… you’re buying crops at a premium and including them in the hunters’ food allowance? Isn’t that a scam?”\n-Separating businesses. Ten Thousand Gods Farm and Ten Thousand Gods Guild are strictly separate entities. Utilize special support for Ten Thousand Gods Farm. Additional tax exemptions.\n-Utilize the Trainee Family Support Project. Register a welfare business in the name of Ten Thousand Gods Guild and utilize additional tax exemptions.\n-Registering an independent pension business. Increase asset value through investment.\nHe downloaded the country’s legal system in 0.1 seconds and found loopholes in the law in an instant.\n‘Is this big data?’\nHa-ri marvels at Yappy’s intelligent computing power that finds solutions in a fraction of a second.\n“Wow, that’s really helpful, I think I can put this issue to rest for now.”\n-Ha-ri\n“Mmmm….”\nThere was nothing more Ha-ri could ask for since Yappy had taken care of things so quickly. She now spoke of a very personal matter.\n“His Majesty has asked me to attend to the Queen, and since I’ll need to hire a maid, he’s also asked me to provide her with an outfit…a maid’s outfit, I assume?”\nHa-ri knows that Leon’s worldview is very medieval.\nHe’s from an otherworldly fantasy kingdom, so it can’t exactly be compared to Earth, but the maids he thinks of are probably maids, right?\nYappy agreed.\n-His Majesty Leon. Similar to modern medieval European kingdoms. The handmaiden=maiden inference is reasonable.\n“It is, isn’t it? I was hesitating because I thought I’d be criticized for cosplaying later.”\n-No problem. Rational ‘maid suit’ order based on big data?\n“I’d be grateful if you did!”\nHa-ri didn’t know that the “big data” of a maid suit that Yappy was referring to was aggregated data from online home shopping.\nIt was the number one product with the most satisfactory star rating.\n-My boyfriend really likes it.\n-My boyfriend really likes it. I should wear it more often.\n-Yay!\nIt was the scourge of big data.\n* * * *\nAfter Ha-ri left, Yappy went about his business without a break.\nHeto, the god of iron and blacksmithing, had entrusted Yappy with one task: The rise of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild and the resurrection of the Lionheart Kingdom.\nTo do so, Yappy must manipulate public opinion and spread faith so he got right to work, utilizing his 1,398,865 accounts.\nFirst, he edited the video he shot of the Fluctuation Gate and translated it into the language systems of every country on the planet with an active internet connection.\nHe also thoroughly analyzed local YouTubers, overseas YouTubers and channels, and communities related to hunters and religious communities.\nAmong them, Yappy’s latest concern was to investigate the strength of the Archdemon Androzin items obtained from the Fluctuation Gate.\n-Dense ore. Strength measurement, superalloy MDⅤ or higher.\nYappy sees the possibilities of this great metal. While not comparable to the ‘new iron’ shown by the divinity of iron and blacksmithing, it is at least as hard as the superalloy MD series he was used to in his original world.\n-Similar minerals exist. A special mineral from Gate Mountain. Commonly known as ‘Adamantite.’ 99.8% Identical\nYappy has counted hundreds of instances of it and deemed it worthy of purchase and study.\n-Legendary Minerals. 230 million per kilogram of Adamantite. Need to raise more money.\nThe budget required was enormous so Yappy asked Leon for permission to raise funds.\n“We need large quantities of materials to build research facilities and factories.”\n“Hmm, military funding. We’ll always need money. Is the money from selling rice and the gates not enough?”\n-Not enough. Suggestion. Stock market intervention.\nLeon was only vaguely familiar with stocks, though he was surprised to learn that a famous investor from his time on Earth was still alive.\n“How do you plan to raise the money?”\n-Game plan. Futures market manipulation. Hack the polls and send the coin market skyrocketing.\n“Hmm… I forgot to discuss the definition of human with you.”\nLeon recognized the AI’s lack of human morality.\n“I suppose there are victims to your sordid money-grubbing ways but you are a Holy Knight of the Goddess of Light and Justice. There must be justice in gambling.”\n-Huh?\nLeon laid down a few principles.\n1.Reduce the number of innocent victims.\n2.The standard of innocence would be human morality.\nWith its overwhelming computing power, AI absorbed human morality, commonly condemned financial crimes, etc. into big data, and naturally came to one conclusion.\nIt is possible to make a lot of money and still be moral.\n-Discovered 187 suspected stock price manipulations. Engaged in immoral behavior. Opening unlimited short trades.\nUsing 1% of its computing power to manipulate the stock market, the computational power of artificial intelligence, which can turn even the world’s best supercomputers into barbarians, has begun to intervene in the world’s stock market.\n-I will be a righteous thief today.\nThe destruction of the world’s stock market manipulators has begun.",

      "content": "Chapter 51: Draft\nSince the Cataclysm, the Awakened have been the nation’s most important workforce.\nAwakenings usually occurred between the ages of twelve and fourteen, and they needed to be systematically trained from a young age.\nThe nations of the world were not foolish enough to let their precious Awakened die without training, so they established institutions to train them.\nHunter Academy, a state-sanctioned institution that trains Hunters to protect the future of the nation.\nHere, cadets learn the basics of hunter combat and the use of magic, as well as codes of conduct for dealing with dungeon breaks and accounting for tax purposes.\nAside from the minimal mandatory training, it’s a pretty full-fledged hunter academy, with most of the time allocated to hunter-related tasks.\nTwice a year the third year of the Hunter Academy’s senior class is used to select new Hunters for the Guilds to join upon graduation.\nIt’s called the Draft, and it’s a fiercely contested annual event.\nHan Soo-ho, a third-year senior student at the Hunter Academy in South Korea, was one of the promising Hunters selected in this year’s draft.\n“‘Hoo…….”\n“Why are you, bastard, sighing on a good day?”\n“Jae-hyuk…….”\nSoo-ho smiled bitterly as his classmate Jae-hyuk reprimanded him.\n“It’s the draft today, and the guilds will be coming.”\n“There’s no need to be nervous, we’re number one anyway. Oh, but it would be a bit awkward if a weak guild picked us.”\nHunter Academy’s draft system gives priority to the weaker guilds to prevent extreme skewing of talent.\nCadets also have three veto rights, so they’re not forced into the draft, but if they use them all up, they’re forced into the draft.\nThe draft season is full of pitfalls, as it’s not uncommon for smaller guilds to make backroom deals to steal promising rookies from larger guilds, then made them use up their veto power and snatch them up.\nBut even then, it’s an extreme mind game when it comes to the prospect of the year.\nThe battle for the top rookie of the year in last year’s draft was famously fought over Han Ha-ri, even though she entered the Association.\n“Well, we’re in Class A, so we’ll get picked up here and there.”\n“Didn’t Jae-hyuk say you were going to join the Divine Sword Guild, and I saw you talking to their scout?”\nSoo-ho mentioned, glancing at someone sitting on the edge of the room.\n“No, I don’t really like the Divine Sword Guild. If I go there, I’ll have to bow my head to Chen Jin-soo.”\n“Ugh…….”\nSoo-ho looked over at the girl who, unlike her classmates who were all excited about the draft, was the only one who seemed disinterested, scribbling away at her notes.\nShe had blue hair, light blue eyes and an intellectual appearance that makes even the girl sitting next to her stare at her.\nHer name is Chen So-yeon, the granddaughter of Berserker Chen Jin-soo, the guild leader of the Divine Sword Guild, the absolute number one guild in Korea’s top ten.\nAs the granddaughter of the strongest authorized S-class hunter in Korea, her entry into the Divine Sword Guild is a given.\nDespite her family’s heritage, Chen So-yeon is also a top-ranked B-class Hunter, a genius of her time. She is a genius swordswoman who is said to be capable of becoming an A-class hunter as soon as she proves herself.\nThe classification of the Hunter Academy is strictly based on performance.\nClass B Hunters are the majority of the class, and Class A Hunters, who have already awakened their unique skills, are a collection of geniuses.\nEven in Class A, there are three who stand out: Han Soo-ho, Kim Jae-hyuk, and Chen So-yeon.\nThey’re called the golden trio of this generation and this year’s draft is strictly about who gets these three.\nAside from Chen So-yeon, who will naturally be joining her grandfather’s guild, the Divine Sword Guild, Han Soo-ho and Kim Jae-hyuk have been in the spotlight.\nHowever Han Soo-ho, one of the promising hunters, already had a place in his mind where he wanted to join.\n“But are you really going to join the Association?… If I were you, I’d go to a place like the Firebird Guild or the Infinite Guild.”\nJae-hyuk understood why Soo-ho wanted to join the Association.\nHan Ha-ri, who was a year older than him, was from the same orphanage and Soo-ho had always admired her and hoped to join the Hunter’s Association like her.\nJae-hyuk thought it was silly since in Korea, the power of the Top Ten Guilds is absolute.\nJust comparing the salary of an Association employee with a decent mid-sized guild is at least double. The difference increases exponentially when you’re a prospect in a top 10 guild.\n“If you join the Association, you’ll be sweeping the gates just before the dungeon break. Didn’t your sister tell you that you’d be working for nothing?”\nHa-ri is a newcomer to the hunter community but what she’s equipped with has the community talking.\n-Ha-ri is a Class A Hunter, what’s with the gear?\n-Shouldn’t she at least have a unique item? She’s a hunter of the Association.\n– They’re tax thieves. If you’re an up-and-coming hunter, you should have tons of corporate sponsorships.\n-B-grade hunters can get unique items if they make a big investment, but Ha-ri’s using rare items. Even though she’s only 20 years old and the next S-class Hunter they don’t invest in her? That’s dereliction of duty.\nThat’s why Jae-hyuk is determined to join a top 10 guild. Even though he’s not Ha-ri, he’s still a cadet and is recognized as a B-class prospect.\nThe Top Ten Guilds are a hunter’s dream job because they support their prospects.\nThe Hunter’s Association, it’s not popular with young people these days because it comes with strings attached, like a sense of duty and patriotism.\n“All right, cadets. Today, the Guilds are here for selection, just as we expected.”\n“Waaaaaah…!”\nInstead of the usual classes, the draft information session was packed from first to eighth period.\nIt was a great opportunity for the cadets to hear from the high-ranking Hunters they had always admired, instead of just introducing themselves to the guild.\n“Welcome The Golden Lion Guild Leader.”\n-Wow, Golden Lion!\nAn S-class Hunter himself?!\nThe Golden Lion Guild was the first to strike.\nA month ago, the Golden Lion Guild had been heavily damaged in the attack on the Cheongju Gate, and despite being a Top 10 guild, they had gotten the first pick in the draft.\nNormally, they would have sent a scout from their guild, but the situation was so urgent that the guild leader himself had to come.\nThat was something that most cadets know, nevertheless, the Golden Lion Guild was more favored than expected.\n-They’re still one of the few guilds with S-class Hunters.\n-Their vice guild leader, Huang Yeonha, is also an upcoming S-class.\n-Now is the time when the entry cut for the Golden Lion is the lowest. Perhaps I, as a C-rank, should take a shot?\nThat applies to the elusive top tier, too. Geniuses like Jae-hyuk, who reached B rank in the third year of the academy. Or talents with rare unique skills and are expected to be selected by the traditional top-tier guilds.\n“Whoa~ It’s already the 8th period, I’m tired after doing this all day.”\n“We still have three more days to go, and we’ll have to schedule a field trip during vacation to experience the guild building.”\n“Haven’t all the guilds come out on the first day already? There are plenty of mid-sized guilds this year.”\nThe cadets exchanged opinions and dreamed of a bright future. It was time for a break, and it was getting late.\n“Attention, cadets!”\nAn Association employee loudly announces his presence, drawing the cadets’ attention.\nIt was Kim Jin-soo, the head of a department and Ha-ri’s boss at work, so Han Soo-ho knew him well.\n“The next person to enter is His Majesty Leon Dragonia Lionheart, Guildmaster of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild, who has been making a name for himself lately.”\n-Leon Drag… what?\n-You know, the survivor. The one who attacked the Cheongju Gate and purified the Naju Plain.\n-Ah~ The religious man?\n“You!”\nChief Kim Jin-soo gasped and pointed at the student who had just spoken.\n“Me, me?”\n“Yes, you! Do you want to see all of us die together!”\n“?????”\nSeeing the cadet’s bewilderment, Kim Jin-soo realized that he was lucky to come here beforehand.\n“The man who is about to enter the room, as you know, has a different worldview from ours.”\n“He was more than an emperor in that world, and he is someone who strictly adheres to class.”\n“But this is Earth, a modern democracy.”\n“Please, please, if you have any complaints, keep them to yourself. I’m really, really saying this for your own good. Yes. Please keep it. You’ve all seen the historical dramas, right? You’re either going to mimic them or don’t talk at all.”\n“You’re telling me to imitate the manner of the historical dramas as if you’re the godfather of the Joseon Dynasty, and if I don’t, the students will have to bear the consequences?”\nThese were the same association employees who were usually so polite and bowed down.\nThey know that they know they’re the underdogs in Hunter’s world. With that attitude, they might as well have given up on getting a Class A pick in this draft.\nAnd they were so convinced that they needed to get the message across that they didn’t want to get a pick this year.\n‘He’s a cadet, he’s a cadet, he’s a cadet, he’s a cadet, he’s a cadet!’\nHe didn’t want them to get hurt.\nThere was no way he was going to let that authoritarian classist bully get away with it.\nUsually when a young, handsome hunter comes to scout, a question is always asked.\n-Hey, Hunter, do you have a girlfriend?\nA normal hunter would say, “Haha, I don’t have one yet.” But Leon’s reaction was obvious.\n‘How dare you pry into the personal life of royalty?’\nThank goodness it’s just words. They’d be lucky if he doesn’t beat someone to teach them manners!\n‘What the hell was the Association President thinking, letting that bombshell participate in the draft?’\nNormally, the Ten Thousand Gods Guild is too new to participate in the Draft. However, the young guild’s actions were too great.\nLeon virtually single-handedly cleared the Orange Gate of the Hunan Plains, which was intentionally broken by Yong Wan of the Firebird Guild and defeated the infamous Red Gate Yakt Spinner of Cheongju then made him become his subordinate.\nHe took a bunch of D-rank Hunters and raised them at least a rank… and probably more, bringing the Yakt Spinner and Queen Beatrice into the fold.\nLeon alone was already overwhelming most small and medium-sized guilds, but the problem was that there were no mid-tier A- and B-ranks.\n‘Using that as an excuse to give him priority in the draft, the Association President is completely betting on him.’\nHe couldn’t honestly say that the judgment itself was wrong since the power that Leon has demonstrated is the kind of power that can change a nation…or the world.\nNot just brute force, but a position in the religious world that has been expanding at a frightening rate lately.\n‘Please let it pass without any problems!’\nThe bell rang for the end of recess, and the students took their seats, half nervous, half expectant.\nThe eighth period begins as the door to the classroom opens and Leon walks in.\n* * * *\nHe was a handsome man but more than that, he had a powerful presence.\nThe Class A students felt it instinctively as they watched the blond-haired foreigner stand in front of the lectern.\nHe had an air of something that overwhelmed even the few high-ranking Hunters that visited for the draft and a grotesque power that could not be explained by logic.\nHe was a medieval barbarian, a religionist spouting religious nonsense but the young boys and girls soon-to-be twenty-something were forced to revise their preconceived notions.\nIf ever there was an overwhelming force of nature, it was this man.\nHis every step was like a perfectly polished piece of steel, and his aura was overwhelming.\n‘He’s got an aura about him…….’\n‘I heard he’s stronger than an S-class Hunter, is that true?’\n‘I hear there are a lot of weirdos among the survivors, but that one…….’\nHe looked like he was in his mid twenties but the cadets knew that he was over 300 years old and could only swallow dryly at his breathtaking energy and strong gaze.\nThe cadets understood what Chief Kim was talking about.\nThey must be careful how they speak in front of him.\n“Let me announce something first.”\nWithout even introducing himself?\nThe students didn’t know what to say to a man who didn’t even say his name and started talking as if they should know it but no one could stand up to that intimidating gaze.\nEven the next leader of the Divine Sword Guild, Chen So-yeon, was swallowing her breath, overwhelmed by his aura.\nWith a snap, Leon’s finger pointed at the cadets unlike a normal speech or greeting.\n“Ninety-nine percent of you will not become knights.”\n“……?”\n“Only the one percent who shine will become knights.”\nHe came here to find the sprouts of knights, not soldiers.\nThis was not a solicitation or an offer. Not even a promise of a large down payment and support.\n“Only a handful of talented ones among you will be chosen by me.”\nShow me your talent, I’ll test you.\nIt was an arrogant declaration but one that only he could make.",

      "content": "Chapter 52: Magic is Inferior\nMost of the cadets resented his arrogance in saying that he would only “accept” the best one percent of the class, not through scouting or big offers.\nEspecially in an academy of geniuses, the true geniuses were outraged.\n‘I heard he was a survivor, but I didn’t expect him to be so arrogant.’\nChen So-yeon, the granddaughter of the head of the Divine Sword Guild, was one of them.\n‘Do you think you can be arrogant because you’ve recently made a name for yourself? There are many cadets here who are associated with the Ten Guilds.’\nThis is Class A of the Hunter Academy’s graduating class.\nIt was a gathering place for geniuses who were destined for a great future. It wasn’t as if the cadets of such a special class were being treated with favorable treatment and offered contracts, but ‘show me your skills’?\nHowever, apart from such anger and antipathy, the students did not openly express their dissatisfaction.\nPart of this is due to the trust placed in Kim Jin-soo, a chief of the Hunter Association, but it was also due to the fact that few students are willing to take a chance on Leon, who is no ordinary person.\nIsn’t he a survivor, the one who attacked the Cheongju Gate and closed it?\nHis confidence comes with a track record, so cadets are bound to be cautious.\nOf course, there are quite a few people in the Top 10 guilds who have accomplished such feats and the Divine Sword Guild is a prime example.\n“Guild Leader, I have a question.”\nChen So-yeon raised her hand and Chief Kim Jin-soo’s eyes widened.\n‘I’ve been careless!’\nLeon’s official title is His Majesty, the Lionheart King of the otherworldly Lionheart Kingdom. That much information has been released by the government.\nIt’s a general rule that survivors from other worlds should be treated with respect for their culture. Of course, they’re ignored unless they have the skills to do so.\nLeon was not a typical survivor.\nHe was classist, discriminatory, authoritarian, and a bit of a nutcase to watch from the sidelines but the problem was that he was too strong.\n“Please, Your Majesty! Grant me a…”\n“Tell me your name.”\nContrary to Chief Kim Jin-soo’s worries, Leon replied calmly.\n“It is……Chen So-yeon.”\n“Are you a noble?”\n“Oh, no…….”\nThere is no such thing as aristocracy in modern Korea but L eon shook his head at her answer.\n“So you’re a commoner. I don’t blame you for your ignorance, but in the future, be careful with the way you address people.”\n“What…!”\nChen So-yeon’s face turned bright red as she was instantly turned into an uneducated commoner. However, she quickly regained her composure and asked with a cold gaze.\n“You said you’d ‘try us out’, but haven’t you already received our evaluation data?”\nThe scouts receive the cadets’ information before the draft so they can gauge their worth and make an offer.\nLeon had received that analysis from the Hunter’s Association.\n“What does a piece of paper tell you? This king will look beyond it and see you for who you are.”\n“What…….?”\n“I’ll tell you the opposite. Why should I let you in? Tell me why I should let you in.”\nIt’s not like this is a job interview and they’re asking you why they should hire you…Leon’s expression is too sincere for a pressure interview.\n“This king will teach you. You should be honored to know that you can be a servant of the Lionheart King.”\n“”………….””\nThe students’ reactions were even more dumbfounded and Han Soo-ho realized that Ha-ri would have a hard time under such a person.\n“You Majesty the Lionheart King.”\nRegardless, Soo-ho cautiously raised his hand.\n“Your question is granted.”\n“You said you… teach, but what…is it about?”\nIt wasn’t uncommon for guilds with senior Hunters to personally mark and teach the rookies they drafted because their know-how is invaluable.\nIn fact, Hunters under the tutelage of senior Hunters were often promoted quickly.\n“This king will teach you four things: swordsmanship, spearmanship, horsemanship, and theology.”\n“……?”\nThe cadets murmured.\nHunters could learn swordsmanship or spearmanship but only if they specialize in swordsmanship or spearmanship.\nThose who specialize in other skills take up other weapons, and swords and spears are strictly for ease of use, not to delve deeper.\nBesides, horsemanship, you don’t learn horsemanship because you’re not going to get off your horse at the gate, do you?\n-No, apart from everything else, what’s the point of a theological education?\n-To be our pastor?\nNot surprisingly, someone raised their hand.\n“I, uh, I specialize in…archery?”\n“You’re a misfit. That kind of weaponry belongs to the infantry. This king is here to find knights, not infantry.”\n“You’re too much…….”\nThe archery specialist throws his hands up in frustration as another archery specialist raises his hand in protest.\n“Archery is a great skill, and ranged dealers are essential for gate capture!”\n“Don’t you dare raise your voice, you lowlife!”\n“Tsk, tsk, tsk…?!”\nIt was an even more repulsive epithet, but Leon’s 【Ranged Abomination】 effectively shut the student up.\n“Arrows have their limits. Only perfection, with no limits to growth, is the pinnacle a knight should strive for.”\n“No…….”\n“Of course, I don’t intend to argue with long-range but it is a crude form of combat and can never be a mainstay in a hundred-man battle where sword and flesh meet.”\nIn short, archer is a supporting role. The theory is that a melee cold weapon trained to the extreme will surpass even ranged weapons.\n“In the first place, holy law…I mean, is magic universal? If you have the firepower of magic, what’s the point of relying on a gimmick? If you run out of arrows, will you just grab a dagger and charge?”\n“Ugh…!”\nIt’s a harsh statement, but in reality, the ability of archers to fight for long periods of time has been debated.\nIn a field gate where supplies were scarce or in a large-scale battle, the number of arrows would be limited.\n“So mages don’t need to join Your Majesty’s guild?”\nRaising her hand was a mage girl, one of the few in the entire grade, let alone Class A.\nUsually, mage cadets aren’t interested in the draft because they go to the mage tower after graduating from the academy.\n“Certainly a wizard is handy to have, and there’s nothing this king can teach you about that.”\nWell, sure.\nGiven his range aversion, it’s unlikely he’d use magic or anything like that.\n“But if you study theology, this king can teach you some simple holy laws.”\n“‘Theology’?”\nThat was the most questionable thing. Swordsmanship, spearmanship, and horsemanship aside, what the hell does he mean by teaching theology?\n“What does holy law have to do with theology?”\n“Yes, it does. Holy law is an expression of faith.”\n-What is this, magic in a different name?\n-I’m curious about otherworldly magic.\n-But you say you’re a knight. What kind of magic is swordplay?\n-That sounds like fantasy to me, given your faith. Why not a priest-healer from a game?\n-The light is on the side of the righteous, or something.\nMost people don’t believe Leon’s words since normally magic is a gift that few are born with.\nOf the five thousand cadets at Hunter Academy, only a hundred are mages. That’s a rare talent.\nIt’s an even rarer profession in general, given that the mage cadets are being weeded out by the Tower.\n‘Those who teach swordsmanship and spearmanship, also use magic?’ Suspicion flares in Leon’s eyes.\n“You seem to think that magic is a blessing granted only to the most gifted.”\n‘Isn’t that obvious? ‘\nLeon continued.\n“Holy law is not reserved for a select few. Anyone can do it if they’re willing to learn.”\n“That’s ridiculous.”\nChen So-yeon raised her hand to speak up, momentarily embarrassed by the words she had unwittingly uttered.\n“The way a normal Martial Realm Hunter and a Magic Realm Hunter utilize mana is different. While the Martial Realm uses internal force that condenses mana from within, the Magical Realm is an external force that radiates outward.”\n“So?”\nAt Leon’s so-what attitude, Chen So-Yeon chewed her lip and continued.\n“There are geniuses who can use both at the same time, but they’re even rarer than mages. Your Majesty said that anyone can do it, right?”\n“Indeed. It’s not a powerful holy law, but there are holy laws that even a street farmer can use if it’s necessary for their livelihood.”\nChen So-yeon’s gaze narrowed.\n“It’s theoretically impossible.”\n“Don’t try to understand it with logic. It’s not something that can be learned. But since you don’t believe me, I’ll tell you one more thing.”\nLeon’s next words would have stunned even a mage girl who had approached him out of curiosity.\n“Magic is inferior to the holy law.”\n“”……!!””\nWhat the hell?\nThe previous statements aside, what was this bombshell?\nThe mage cadets in Class A shuddered and raised their hands, unable to contain their outrage, and Leon waved away the questions.\n“Mage Cadet Kim Dae-Su. Inferior… what do you mean?”\n“Literally. Inferior. Next.”\n“I’m Mage Cadet Chae Na-lin. Why is it inferior?”\n“Because a mage’s magic is only the result of an equation. Next.”\n“I am Chen So-yeon…. I’m not sure what that means.”\n“Hmm…….”\nThis is where Leon realized he needed to explain the crucial difference between magic and holy law.\n“For example, let’s say you have a spell that uses fire. What can you do with that fire?”\n“Burn…isn’t that right?”\n“Yes, that is the proper use of fire. But here’s the thing. How far can you burn with that fire?”\nThat depends on the firepower.\nIf it’s a bonfire, it’ll only burn meat, but if it’s a thermal power plant, it’ll burn a lot of fuel.\n“Mage girl there, Chae Na-lin, come forward.”\n“Yes, eh?”\nThe designated Cadet Chae Na-lin glanced around, then cautiously stepped forward. Leon found a suitable object and called out to Chief Kim Jin-soo, who was looking at him uneasily.\n“Chief Jin-soo, I assume you have some training equipment here?”\n“Uh, yeah, that’s right.”\n“If you have a shield, that would be great.”\nWithout asking about Leon’s intentions, Chief Kim immediately grabbed a training shield. It was a semi-large round shield that could completely cover a person.\n“Hmm, not bad for a trainee’s equipment.”\nThat’s the equipment of the Hunter Academy. The most expensive education in the country, paid for by taxes.\nIn fact, the training shields are made of the highest quality minerals of the normal grade. It’s safe to say they’re semi-rare grade.\n“How long would it take to burn this shield with magic?”\n“Tae, burn?”\n“Yes. Think of it as burning it out. Without melting it.”\n“Impossible!”\nCadet Chae Na-lin was right. Setting fire to iron would melt it, not burn it. Even that would require a great deal of firepower.\nEspecially for a hunter’s shield which was made from a crystalline stone.\n“Impossible?”\n“Eh, if you’re an S-class mage, it might be possible…but you still need to melt it!”\n“Yes, that’s your limitation.”\n“”?????””\nLeon said to the dumbfounded students.\n“Your magic isn’t technically magic, it’s just the result of a rational equation. It should be called witchcraft, not magic.”\nThe cadets stared at him in disbelief and disgust.\nUnable to blame them for their ignorance, Leon began to focus his energy on his fingers.\n“This king believes that the sacred flames of the God of War and Flame will consume this shield. It could end in a melting point, if this king wishes. It’s up to him.”\nWhat’s a little faith going to do?\nTo everyone’s surprise, however, fire began to erupt from Leon’s fingertips.\nIs he really using magic?\nBut the cadets’ surprise didn’t end there.\nThe moment the tiny flames touched the shield the shield turned to ash and disappeared.\nIt didn’t even melt, just turned to ash and disappeared in an instant.\n“What…!”\n“”……?!!””\nA muffled shout filled the lecture hall as everyone doubted their eyes, trying to interpret what just happened. But the eyes, nor the mind, can interpret what has just happened, only the results.\nOnly that the fire ‘consumed’ the shield.\nHow?\nThe equation for the most important intermediate step in the use of magic is missing entirely.\nYou create the fire, the fire consumes it.\nOnly the result is visible in reality.\n“This is the difference between magic and holy law.”\nThe obvious was said, and the obvious was done so Leon didn’t boast about how great his “miracle” was since it was just something he could do with the illogical power of faith.\nThis is not innovation or novelty. It’s something else entirely.\nThe holy law…no, Leon’s very existence is ‘different’ from this planet.\n-Really…can anyone learn this?\n-Is this what theological education is for?\n-I can be a mage…I mean, a priest?\nThe cadets look at Leon differently.\nFrom an otherworldly pseudo-authoritarian to the indescribable ‘real’.\n“You can really do that──!”\nIt was then that the bell rings, signaling the end of 8th period, and the heavy atmosphere is lifted.\n“Hmm, time’s up.”\nLeon stepped down from the lectern without hesitation, knowing that he had used up his allotted time.\n“This king will pick only the one percent jade (geniuses). Those who consider themselves Jade, those who wish to become knights, must prove their worth at this king’s gates.”\nOnly the charred remains of his shield lay where Leon had left it.",

      "content": "Chapter 53: The Internet Dictator\nLeon’s declaration spread like wildfire and the Academy’s seniors were initially unhappy.\nHunters are a valuable resource in their own right. Every year, small and medium-sized guilds, as well as large guilds, adjusted their contracts upward to meet the demand for talent.\nHowever, they’ve never seen a guild, even one of the Ten Guilds, be so arrogant.\n-I heard he’s a survivor, but isn’t that too barbaric?\n-What kind of attitude is that in today’s world?\n-Isn’t there a down payment or a salary? Aren’t they following the rules of the industry?\nThere were reviews on the Korean Hunter Academy, and it was posted as a real-time best article in various places.\nWhile the interest in Leon grew in Korea, there were also those who encouraged it. This is the case of Park Yeonrae, a Hunter Academy alumnus and member of the Korean wizard community.\n-Honestly, the man. Saying that magic is inferior is ridiculous, and what’s with the horsemanship?\n-He’s from the Middle Ages, so he’s barbaric.\n“Huh~ That’s refreshing.”\nPark Yeonrae looked satisfied as she watched the number of likes on her comment increase.\n[Magic is inferior to holy law.]\nPark was outraged by this misguided statement but she couldn’t refute it on the spot.\nShe had seen the existence of holy laws that enforced concepts but she could not admit the inferiority of magic. She had lived her entire life with a sense of mage superiority.\nMages are the most powerful Hunters and the non-magical Hunters are merely stalling tactics until they are bombarded by mages.\nBut the Holy Law? The power to make magic inferior? A lifetime of training would not allow it.\n“Alright, just a few more comments and then──”\nPark Yeonrae was about to check for replies to her comments when she realized that she hadn’t seen any.\n“Huh? Why don’t I see them?”\nNo comments. Her comment had disappeared.\n“What? That’s not possible.\nWhat’s wrong with my comment?\nShe checks her comment, but she doesn’t see her comment anywhere. She even checked her comment history and found that all the bad comments she had made were gone.\n“Zee, did you really comment on that? On YouTube?!”\nWhy?\nBut YouTube’s response didn’t end there.\n[We would like to inform you that your account has been permanently suspended for serious violations of the YouTube Community Guidelines]\n“Huh?”\nSuspended? Why?\nAll I did was post a few abusive comments. Not a YouTube warning, nor a suspension, but a permanent ban?\n“Why, why, why?!”\nYeonrae logged in to her account, but the suspension status didn’t change.\nAt the same time, Yappy’s brain sensors, which were floating around the Internet with a computational rate of 3%, posted a report.\n-Account suspension completed. Hacked into YouTube’s centralized processing system. Traces incinerated.\nWhen he wasn’t at the gate, Yappy was putting all his computing power into promoting and expanding the Ten Thousand Gods Guild.\nNaturally, his detractors would hack into the community site, delete posts with administrator privileges, and threaten permanent bans.\nMany of the banned accounts were removed in less than 0.3 seconds, even when the owners complained. It’s like an auto-delete at this point.\nThe internet dictatorship had already begun.\nYappy immediately uploaded the edited video under the Ten Thousand Gods Guild YouTube official account, and simultaneously spread the video through his fake YouTube accounts.\n[Shock! Japan watched in horror, the U.S. watched in horror. Why did the demons kneel down to King K?]\n[Why the demons converted in tears after seeing K Kimchi. Black, please let me naturalize in Korea]\n[8K 60fps. official battle report video of Ten Thousand Gods Guild]\nThis fully edited 8K video, translated into over 100 languages, was the battle at the Fluctuation Gate.\nHe added background music and sound effects, edited out camerawork and poor angles with in-house CG, and interspersed Leon’s booming voice with spectacular charges.\nThe reaction of those who saw it was overwhelming.\n-Holy shit… is that a person?\n-Look at the dozens he’s taking down with each charge. Are demons supposed to be that weak?\n-What are those bulls and Death Knights? How did they manage to pull that off?\nThat’s not all. While the fluctuation gate may have shifted the issue, the original purpose of the gate exploit was to showcase the effectiveness of the training of the first batch of trainees enlisted in the Ten Thousand Gods Guild.\nIndeed, the sight of the Ten Thousand Year D-rank Hunters forming a shield, silently repelling the demonic charge, and even fighting back was just as impressive as that of the Death Knights.\n-What’s with the anti-vibration, they’re all tanks?\n-Their ratios are shit, why are they so good at blocking?\n-Aren’t they B- ranks tanks? Doesn’t that look like Kim Jin-soo, head of the Hunter Association? He’s a B-rank.\nYappy commented with additional information.\n-That’s Kim Do-han, head of the mining team. I worked with him. He’s D-rank.\n-D-rank is that good? Don’t be ridiculous.\nYappy thought about suspending the account for replying and added another comment.\n-Wasn’t this gate capture the one that the Lionheart King trained D-rank hunters had to capture? They were all promoted to C-rank.\n-Why do you know the details? Do you have any idea──\nYappy immediately deleted the account. It further traced the IP, used a VPN, hacked into the consolidated database in 1.5 seconds, and caused a blackout at and around the actual IP address.\nThe power would have been restored in a minute, but his computer would have been overloaded and short circuited.\n-Ahhhh! Fuck my computer!\nConfirmed by the house’s pet surveillance cameras, Yappy repeated the same action 687 times. The entire world was the target.\nEven as this was happening, the videos of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild were spreading far and wide, and the students of the Hunter Academy were beginning to develop an interest in the Guild based on the biased information they were being fed.\n* * * *\nAcademy cadet Han Soo-ho, a native of Hanwon Orphanage, boards the bus to the Naju terminal.\nNext to him are classmates Kim Jae-hyuk and Chen So-yeon.\n“There are more guys than I thought.”\nJae-hyuk scoffs, then looks at the bus full of cadets and sneers.\n“Well, we’ve all seen it.”\nLeon’s holy laws were definitely a culture shock.\nTraditionally, the maximizing power of a gate raid is undoubtedly the rear support of the mages.\nWith tanks and dealers blocking the front lines and mages firing from the rear, their firepower was useful enough to change the difficulty of the gate.\nHowever, mages are few and far between, and even when they are, they tend to end up in the mage tower.\nThe monopoly of magic is not new, and it is common for most gate raiding teams to not include mages.\nEven the Ten Guilds are heavily reliant on mage towers aside from their own recruited mages but what Leon showed was a new possibility.\nHe broke the monopoly of magic and made it possible for dealers and even tankers to use magic.\n“Soo-ho, did you see that?”\n“What?”\n“On the Ten Thousand Gods Guild channel on YouTube there’s an amazing video, and it goes into great detail about the use of the Holy Law.”\n“Really?”\nJae-hyuk hands him his earphones to watch and Soo-ho plugged the wireless earphones into his old Hunter phone and connected to the bus’s Wi-Fi.\n“It’s probably 6G, right? Intercity bus Wi-Fi is slow.”\n“I… use LTE.”\n“Ew. You’re using your grandpa’s phone? What, it’s fucking old?”\nJae-hyuk knew Han Soo-ho was from an orphanage, but he didn’t expect him to live on a shoestring.\n“You make a lot of money, don’t you? You must have gotten quite a bit of money from the last practice.”\n“I sent it to an orphanage.”\n“You and Ms. Ha-ri are so eager.”\nHan Ha-ri and Han Soo-ho were both Hunters from the same orphanage, and they donated every penny they earned to their home orphanage.\n“Sister Ha-ri?”\nHan Ha-ri was also in the video posted by the Ten Thousand Gods Guild and her performance in the Orc Gate was shown.\n“By the way, this guy is a real killer. Have you seen the Fluctuation Gate?”\n“Uhm…I’m watching it now, it’s a bit brutal.”\nThe video showed burning demons at the stake and brutally murdering them.\nIt wasn’t quite as grotesque as it could have been, thanks to the colorful video editing, but you could guess what was going on.\n“By the way, didn’t you say that your sister is also in the Ten Thousand Gods Guild?”\n“Yep. She has been there since the Lunar New Year.”\nHan Soo-ho and Han Ha-ri are from the same orphanage. In the orphanage, they had no choice but to rely on each other, and Soo-ho was a good follower of Ha-ri. Or rather, he looked up to her for her genius at such a young age.\nShe hadn’t hesitated to join the Associations when the Ten Guilds offered her a hefty contract.\nShe chose the Association because she admired the Association employee who protected her from the monsters in Dungeon Break.\nHe died attacking the gate just before Dungeon Break, but he left behind a Rank A Hunter named Ha-ri.\nHa-ri is a righteous and passionate Hunter. She genuinely wants to help and protect people, and Soo-ho, who grew up under her like a brother, admires her.\n“By the way, I read that your sister was sent to the Ten Thousand Gods Guild, but what is she doing these days?”\n“Hmm~ I only talked to her on the phone, so I didn’t hear much… but I’m sure she’s doing great things.”\nSoo-ho didn’t doubt that his sister, the one he admired, would save people everywhere.\nThey arrived at the Naju Plains Ten Thousand Gods Guild base when a familiar voice was heard from beyond the large gates.\n“Hey, Lord Yappy, is this you? Is it really you?”\n-See Big Data. Numbers don’t lie.\n“I think it’s too short though…….”\n-Self-information confidence rate 99.999%. Doubting big data?\nIt’s my sister’s voice\n.\nSoo-ho’s face lit up at the sound of Ha-ri’s voice, which he hadn’t heard since the Lunar New Year.\n‘I have to surprise her!’\nWith his back to his classmates, Soo-ho swallowed his voice and knocked on the door.\n“What, what is it?! That’s right! I heard the juniors are coming from the academy today, hehe!”\nThe classmates were excited as they realized that the voice on the other side of the door was Ha-ri.\nHan Ha-ri was the youngest A-rank Hunter and she received a legendary contract offer in last year’s draft.\nEven though she only worked as a civil servant for the Association, isn’t she one of the top geniuses since the Hunter Academy was founded?\nFor the current third-year students, who have seen her play time and time again in mock games, Ha-ri is still the same cheerful, cool senior.\nBut from the other side of the door comes the sound of frantic running.\n“Okay, wait, wait, wait!”\n-Guests. Should respond in a hurry.\n“No, wait! Lord Yappy, wait!”\nHa-ri’s desperate cry causes the gate to fling open as she hastily pulls down her skirt and greets the students with a reddened face.\n“Ah, hello, everyone, you’ve come a long way…uh.”\nShe wore a sleeveless maid’s outfit that exposed her sternum and shoulders. The skirt was so short it was borderline skimpy.\nThe spandex stockings are transparent, showing off her flesh-colored thighs.\nNo. 1 in YAPI’s big data survey.\nA full set of 5 sexy spanx maid clothes.\nFor: Boyfriend.\nSatisfaction: 9.98 stars.\nNumbers don’t lie.\n-His Majesty, Lionheart King. A culture similar to that of medieval European kingdoms. Maid’s dress = maid’s dress Reasoning.\n-The results of the calculations and the ordered goods are the most complete conclusions.\nIt was a blessing in disguise.\n“Nu, sister… what is that?”=\n“Oh, no, I didn’t buy this because I wanted to wear it…….”\n-Big Data Ignored?\nA tiny mechanical spider raises the hem of her skirt with a mechanical arm to enforce the ‘recommended maid wear’ posted on the sales site.\n“Lord Yappy, please, skirt, skirt, don’t raise the skirt!”\nHa-ri makes desperate excuses to the cadets, who look on in bewilderment.\n“No, no, no…! I didn’t buy this! I, uh, yes, His Majesty, the Guildmaster, is a medieval kind of guy, and we’ve had a queen recently, and that’s why Lord Yappy ordered the appropriate attire, and I didn’t want to wear it!”\n-Distrusting the big data?\nYappy’s red eyes were fixed on Ha-ri.\n“That…what are you wearing?”\nA familiar voice was heard from behind Ha-ri’s cut-out maid suit as Leon’s eyes widened at the sight of Ha-ri’s outfit.\nHe wonders if he’s ever been so shocked since he arrived on Earth.\n“Your Majesty, this.”\nLeon’s voice quavered, and then he burst into a rant.\n“You disgusting bitch, change out of those clothes right now!”\n“Hic…?!”\nHa-ri, whose legs were weak after Leon’s tirade, hesitated on the spot and her pouty gaze turned to Yappy.\n“Lord Yappy?”\nYou said it was me, and even when I told you it wasn’t, you scowled at me for doubting the big data.\n-Huh?\nYappy spun on his heel and began to head nonchalantly toward the kitchen.\n-Two o’clock trainee meal. Brine distribution commenced.\n“………….”\n“………….”\nReuniting with his beloved sister was the worst.\n* * * *\nJeju Island Gate, this “red” gate appeared in the center of downtown Jeju City and made headlines across the country as soon as it appeared.\nThe red gate attracted a lot of attention, even as the recent high-profile Fluctuation Gate incident faded into the background.\nThe gates, which are categorized as black, red, orange, yellow, green, and blue, are not uniform, but there is a general strategy.\nRed gates are the hardest, with the exception of black gates, which are the worst disasters in history. Generally speaking, two S-rank hunters are the minimum number of S-ranks needed in a raid of about 100 hunters.\nThis is the minimum number of S-ranks, but it is generally believed that three S-rank hunters are needed to reliably defeat it.\nThe guild leader of the Firebird Guild, an S-rank hunter and one of the Ten Guilds, bought the Jeju Island Red Gate but was worried that they wouldn’t be able to capture the gate on their own.\nThe Firebird Guild has two S- rank Hunters, including Lee Yong-wan himself but at the very least, he wanted to attract one or two more S- rank hunters.\nHowever S-rank hunters are not that common.\nThere are 20 S-class Hunters in Korea, but all of them belong to the top 10 guilds.\nUsually, the top 10 guilds cooperate on hunter bills and profit projects, but only when they have a common goal.\nThe larger, more competitive guilds were ready to rip each other apart at every opportunity.\nWould any guild be willing to give up their S-rank hunters for a Firebird guild that had outbid them on the red gate?\nNegotiating time is short and if a dungeon break happens in the red gate all would be over.\nRather than invite the ten guilds to a negotiation table that could end at any moment, Lee Yong-wan chose the most obvious option.\n“I’m here.”\n“I paid you to come, but you took an early morning flight, you ghost of money.”\n“Our guild is in a bad spot.”\nHuang Yeonha and Golden Chul brought up to forty Golden Lion raiders under their command.\nIt would be no exaggeration to say that the Golden Lion, who had been heavily damaged by the Yakt Spinner at the Cheongju Gate, had brought virtually all of their strength with them.\n“It’s been a while, Mr. Golden Chul.”\n“Senior Lee Yong-wan, you’ve been saving yourself since the government blackmail incident at the Hunan Gate, and you managed to get a Red Gate?”\n“Thanks to my self-sacrifice, I didn’t end up chopping up all the other guild members.”\n“Hahaha~”\n“Hahaha~”\nThe two S-rank hunters stabbed at each other with smiling faces. This was the usual atmosphere when the Ten Guilds met.\n“Wow, the one who didn’t even give us a bone to eat in this small land has provided us with a true sacrament.”\n“You’ve been on a bit of a hiatus lately, so I’ll take care of you.”\nThe Firebird Guild wanted S-rank power and veteran raiders who could come quickly while the Golden Lion Guild needed funds to repair its tarnished reputation and restore its power.\nThe two Ten Guilds were able to come to a quick compromise in the face of such an alignment.\n“The settlement is five-for-five, right?”\n“What are you talking about? It’s obvious that our guild is the one that’s going to get the short end of the stick.”\n“A~ Who else but us would come to help you, Yong-wan of the Firebird Guild, if you don’t want to, you can call someone else now~”\n“I’m Lee Yong-wan. Junior, don’t you fucking cross the line.”\nThe name was a complication for Yong-wan. No wonder his parents gave him this shitty name.\n“Sixty-forty. No less than that.\n“Okay, but you’ll pay for the food.”\n“You can eat with your own money.”\nThe two made a harsh but quick settlement since they both wanted to get things done as quickly as possible.\n“Why do …… men have such stupid fights.”\n“I know.”\n“Oh, my God!”\nHuang Yeonha glanced at the short-haired beauty who had suddenly appeared behind her.\nIt was Han Yuri, another S-class Hunter from the Firebird Guild. She’s an assassin who specializes in using daggers and has mastered the art of plunging them into the backs of monsters without warning.\n“Sis, you need to wake the fuck up.”\n“Talk nice.”\nThree S-class hunters and one semi-S-class, in addition to more than 150 elite raiders entered the Jeju Island Gate, expecting a steady victory, and──\n[Quest: Save the Slaughtered].\nConditions: Defeat the ‘Majestic Georgic’.\nThere, they see a knight.\n“How dare you try to save those wretches in front of me, in front of this Georgic! You have crossed the line!”\nA hulking knight in heavy armor equipped with a massive one-handed hammer and shield overwhelmed everyone with his fierce gaze and voice.\n“It is I, the glorious Holy Knight of Lionheart, Georgic, who will bring you the Divine Punishment!”\nThe ‘Majestic Georgic’ Holy Knight of Life and Abundance was the boss of the gate.",

      "content": "Chapter 54: Jeju Island Gate\nJeju Island gate.\nAfter the red gate, which is the most difficult gate except for a few, appeared in Jeju City, residents evacuated en masse.\nIf it was a yellow or orange gate, some people would have held onto the resident count, hoping that it would be cleared, but this time it was a red gate.\nIf a dungeon break occurs, an entire city can be blown away in an instant.\n“You’re not going to skip clearing this time, are you?”\nGolden Chul, referred to the dungeon break at the Hunan Plains Gate as a political protest but Lee Yong-wan nonchalantly retorted that it wasn’t a big deal.\n“If the gate’s tax-free privileges are extended, won’t you benefit from it too? I’m the one who’s supposed to be in charge, so why are you frowning?”\n“Well, I’m trying to earn money as honestly as possible.”\nRecently, the Korean hunter community has been buzzing about the expansion of tax-free privileges.\nThe first-of-its-kind tax exemption bill, which would exempt up to 1 trillion won in gate loot sales, was strongly pushed by Ten Guilds.\n“It’s only a matter of time before the top 10 guilds like our Firebird Guild, Blue Star, Mujin, and Shark Guild push for it.”\nFirebird, Blue Star, Mujin, and Shark throw some foreign migration news at the lawmakers they’re feeding money to and they’ll scare the shit out of them and pass the bill. It should have been…….\n‘The Association is coming out strangely strong now.’\nThe problem was the attitude of the Association’s president, Oh Kang-hyuk. As South Korea’s first generation S-class hunter, he is a symbol of national defense.\nHe may be old, but his influence is greater than you’d think, and he’s been able to convince frightened defense officials and the government.\n“Is it because of that lunatic, Lionheart?”\n“Oh, yeah, he is definitely a lunatic.”\nYong-wan asked Golden Chul, who had seen him fight.”\n“What’s your assessment of him?”\n“Well, he’s a little crazy, convicted, chivalrous, but far from efficient.”\nGolden Chul remembered his time at the Cheongju Gate with the Yakt Spinner.\nThe ridiculousness of challenging to a duel a heavily armored multi-armored vehicle on horseback. But──\n“His power is real. At least stronger than me or you. An S-rank hunter is no match for him.”\n“…….”\n‘Even that’s a bit of a stretch.’\nEven though he was the one who had destroyed the Yakt spinner, Golden Chul somehow felt that he was not powerful.\n‘Considering the power of faith, even his current strength may not be his original strength…….’\nThinking about it made him feel eerie. Was it okay for humans to be so strong?\n‘We should seriously consider my sister’s suggestion.’\nWhile thinking about his sister’s suggestion, Golden Chul entered the gate.\nUpon entering the red gate, he was greeted by a combined raiding party from the Firebird Guild and the Golden Lion Guild, who were in a battle stance──\n“Oooh, shhhhhhhhhhhh…….”\nThe ‘red stones’ that make everyone admire are the most common ore found in the Gate and the resource that supports modern civilization.\n“What’s with the red stones?”\n“In a field gate, not a dungeon gate? This…….”\nIt’s a new mineral found in the bodies of monsters after clearing a gate but it doesn’t just come from monster corpses.\nThere are also humans and other races called NPCs in the gates, and they also leave behind their own magic ore when they die. Only certain other races and demons don’t leave them at the Gate.\nIt’s also a job to mine them from corpses, which is why D-rank mining teams are hired to do corpse farming…….\n‘Isn’t this a level where you don’t need a mining team at all?’\n‘We don’t even need to go outside the gate and call the waiting mining team.’\n‘It’s not like there’s a lot of magic stones in the ground like this…….’\nYong-wan and Golden Iron Chul looked at each other and smiled greedily.\n“”Golden Gate.””\nGolden Gate, it’s more of a metaphor than an official name. It meant a gate that poured out gold.\nSometimes there was a gate of epic proportions, but a particularly ‘epic’ quest. To be more precise, a gate where monsters were regenerated endlessly, spewing out endless amounts of magic stones.\n“Check the quest!”\nYong-wan hurriedly opened the message window. The Golden Gate has a quest that releases an enormous amount of Spirit Stones. That meant that there were ‘resources’ of that size inside the gate.\nAnd inevitably, in order to become this large, you must…\n[Quest: Save the Slaughtered].\nConditions: Defeat the field boss, Majestic Georgic.\nWar.\nThis gate is a war gate.\nAnd──\n“Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”\n“Please! Please, don’t kill me!”\nNot too far from the entrance of the gate a certain tribe was being attacked.\n* * * *\nThe attacked tribe was being slaughtered by knights and soldiers on horseback.\n“Kill, kill──”\n“Die, bastards!”\nThe armored soldiers mercilessly slaughtered the unresisting tribesmen.\n“……What the hell, this.”\nThey’ve seen all sorts of incidents and ugly things happen at the gate, but they’ve never seen such a one-sided slaughter.\n“Hey, since it’s a quest to save the people, is there a specific way to save them?”\n“Isn’t it?”\nThe allied raiders immediately entered a combat stance. He didn’t know, but he wasn’t shameless enough to turn a blind eye to the slaughter.\nNow is the time to save them, if only to fulfill the quest.\n“Stop!”\nJust as they rush to the rescue of the slaughtered villagers, dozens of knights and soldiers appear, quickly weaving their shields and halting their party.\n“By the looks of their clothes, they’re not like those bums. Mercenaries.”\n“Well, is that so?”\n“So?”\nThe knight glared at the raider in the lead.\n“I am Dalion Emchain, Knight Errant, second son of Viscount Emchain, Knight of the Realm, of the Viscounty of Emchain.”\n“…….”\nDalion’s curious declaration didn’t deter the Alliance raiders. This side has 100 B-rank Hunters and 50 A-ranks. This is not a force to be trifled with by a mere knight and his horde.\nRather, it was Dalion and his soldiers who must retreat.\n“How dare you point a sword at a knight!? I may not be an official knight, but what disrespect!”\nDalion rages, then Huang Yeonha shouted at him.\n“You bastard, can’t you see you’re being outnumbered? Why don’t you just stop the slaughter?”\n“Massacre? What do you mean?”`\n“Uh….”\nHe sounded genuinely confused, and Huang Yeonha was puzzled. Could it be that they belonged to a different group than the slaughterers who attacked that tribe?\n“Ah~ You mean those bastards?”\nLord Dalion, Knight Errant, made an incredulous face.\n“How is killing them a massacre? They’re not people, they’re beasts. It’s not a massacre, it’s a slaughter.”\n“”──?!!””\nThe inhabitants of the modern world exclaimed at the horrifyingly cruel declaration.\n“Yeah…that’s the kind of character he is.”\nApparently, there is no room for negotiation and the raiders were relieved that their opponent was unmistakably evil.\nThe battle began.\nA mere fifty or so knights and soldiers against a raiding party of over 150.\n“Shit…!”\n“Damn, these guys are strong!”\nThe initial charge of the knights was powerful, but it was easily blocked by the S-class tank, Golden Chul and although Golden Chul was surprised by the heavy power, the battle soon turned in favor of the raiders.\n“Lord Dalion…! We must retreat! We must retreat and call upon the Kingdom Knights for support!”\n“That’s impossible, Sergeant Zenma, we can’t call in the Knights for a bunch of mercenaries!”\nDalion was contorted with shame and ready to die. His whole body burned with fire, and he cast a strange spell.\n“What? Magic?”\n“Knights use magic?”\n“He’s a magical swordsman! Fight back!”\nBut they are the elite of Korea’s top ten guilds.\nThe battle was won easily but even so, Golden Chul and Yong-wan expressions were not bright.\n‘This is the level of an entry-level mob?’\n‘Knights are knights, but their soldiers are also of a high level. Aren’t they minions? They can’t even compete with B-class hunters?’\nIt wasn’t just physical prowess. It was a mastery of group warfare. The morale of the soldiers was unbreakable, even in the face of disadvantage. And then there was──\n“Hold on!”\n“Arianna is watching over me!”\n‘Crazy fanatics!’\nChanting the name of their god, they die.\nThe level is high and the momentum is strong. It was frightening.\n-What the fuck, those assholes.\n-Fucking terrifying.\nThe tired raiders stood still.\n“???”\n“What…?”\nThe air is crushed and a pressure that feels like space is being squeezed appeared as something fell from the sky.\n-Thud!\nIt was a giant armor. No, a knight in green dye-painted armor.\nAll eyes turn to the green knight.\nHe wore green armor, a shield that covered half his body, a huge one-handed hammer, and a searing gaze through the eye holes in his helmet.\nHis mere presence crushes the air and overwhelms his surroundings.\n“What, what, did he just fall out of the sky?”\nIt was a living saint, the highest-ranking knight in the kingdom, honored by the gods for his deeds and praised by the people.\nHe chanted.\n“It is not yet time, soldiers.”\nThe soldiers pound the ground and sing of glory, cheered by the power of the voice.\n” Georgic….”\n” Georgic…!”\n“The Majestic Georgic!”\n“Protector of Gerhane!”\n“Holy Knight of the Kingdom.”\nThe Holy Knight, Majestic Georgic, has arrived.\n“What is that…….”\nThe raiders were baffled by the sudden appearance of the knight from the sky. But it didn’t take long to realize why.\n“Phe, Pegasus?”\nA phantasmagoric creature called a celestial horse. Winged horses have been seen at many gates and the men who rode them were all unusual.\n“Is that…the majestic Georgic?”\n“The Field Boss is already up?”\nAlthough they were a little embarrassed, it wasn’t all bad because the field boss came alone.\nConsidering that boss monsters usually come with tons of minions, this was a lucky break.\n“You are…strangers.”\nGolden Chul froze at the words. Not only him, but all of the raiders dared not approach the hulking knight.\n“Why have you harmed the kingdom’s army, and according to your answer, my warhammer will fall upon you.”\n“What did he say-”\nHuang Yeonha was cut off, and Yong-wan took the lead with a friendly smile.\n“Well… there must have been a misunderstanding. Lord Dalion over there preemptively attacked us, forcing us to respond.”\n“What, you lowly mercenaries-”\nDalion began, but Georgic held up a hand to stop him.\n“Dalion Emchain, I warned you that your impetuosity could destroy your mission. How flippant you are in the name of the Goddess!”\n“I apologize…….”\n‘Oh…they’re more talkative than I thought.’\nMaybe this will work.\n“Your impetuosity led six honorable soldiers to the paradise of the gods, and if you were not the son of Viscount Emchain, Knight of the Realm, you would not have won their allegiance.”\n“Ugh…….”\n“Outsiders, I apologize on behalf of my Dalion.”\n“No, I’m glad we’ve cleared up our misunderstanding.”\nOf course, Yong-wan has no intention of sending Georgic away alive. He’s in apparent peace mode right now, which means he’s letting his guard down.\nField Bosses are powerful, but as long as they’re human, they can easily be dealt with if they’re like this…\n“However, a lowly mercenary killed six soldiers of the kingdom. As long as you pay for it, I’ll let you live.”\n“What?”\n“Let’s see. Six dead, only sixty to go.”\n“”…………….””",

      "content": "Chapter 55: Testing\nThe shocking reunion with Ha-ri aside, the Hunter Academy cadets had a subtle look on their faces as they toured the Ten Thousand Gods Guild compound.\n‘This place is a dump.’\n‘No state-of-the-art training facilities, no medical lounge.’\n‘The cafeteria…is that a cafeteria? Why are they all huddled together drinking water?’\nA guild’s building is a symbol of the organization.\nLook at the ornate buildings in the center of Seoul of the Ten Guilds.\nThe Firebird Guild, one of the top ten guilds, had a 100 billion won building as its headquarters, with numerous training facilities in the basement.\nChen So-yeon, who grew up in the number one guild in Korea, the Divine Sword Guild, knows all too well what a building needs.\nFor starters, they needed a facility for training hunters, a medical center, and a cafeteria. And where would the office staff sit?\n“Ms. Ha-ri, here’s some corn, you can go and steam it.”\n“Oh, thank you.”\n“It’s included in the tribute, so I’ll give it to the king.”\n“”?????””\nThey pass by farmers stacking their crops in their warehouses with a taxation system that they don’t understand.\n“Lord Yappy…is this really all there is?”\n-Need more salt?\n“”?????””\nThe group of cadets stare at the salt-laden water in their glasses that appears to be the meal.\n“This is the ‘soldier’ training ground, folks.”\n“Aaahhhh! Die! Die!”\n“Fuck you until you bleed!”\nThey were fighting with bare hands and almost no clothes on.\nA week ago, news broke that the Ten Thousand Gods Guild had received a new batch of trainees.\nThe news was that all of the first-grade cadets had advanced in rank, and the competition for the 100 second-grade cadets was so intense that the ratio was 85:1.\nThe 100 low-level Hunters who had beaten the odds were shaking their fists at each other, ready to kill.\n“I, I… Senior Ha-ri, what is that training?”\nNo, could that be called training?\nIt was like a battle royale where you had to destroy everything in sight.\n“Huh, training.”\n“That’s…training?”\n“His Majesty the Lionheart King has a very profound intention for you to experience…No, it’s not. The Knight Training Manual says it’s different, so you can read it here…….”\n“I, I’m out of here, I need to get away from this crazy place!”\n“Hmm, is everyone here?”\nIt was then that Leon appeared from behind the cadets. At his appearance, all the cadets stopped.\n“”Welcome, Your Majesty!””\nThe politeness of the trainees, who had been beating each other to a bloody pulp, was in some ways frightening.\n“Today is the visit of the cadets of the Academy who are considering entering the gates of this king. Training will be suspended for the day.”\nThe trainees sat down in unison while Koo Dae-sung, Kim Do-han, and other first-generation trainees sat closest to the king, followed by the second- generation trainees.\nThe cadets naturally sit far apart, isolated in the middle of the training center.\n“I, Ha-ri….”\nJust as Han Soo-ho was about to say something, Ha-ri jumped up and moved the seats in the training center.\n“Your Majesty, your seat is ready!”\nHa-ri prepared Leon’s seat like it’s a given.\n“Hmm, how are Sir Yappy and Queen Beatrice doing?”\n“Sir Yafi is clearing away the meal, and the Queen hasn’t left her chambers, but she said she was getting ready to go out…….”\n“Then shouldn’t you, the handmaiden, go and help her?”\n“… I am guilty.”\nHa-ri can’t say that she couldn’t go because she had to change her maid’s clothes.\n“You, too, stand there.”\n“Um… yes?”\n“You’re going to have to start training as a knight soon. How long are you going to stay at that level?”\n“Uh, yeah!\nHa-ri sprinted off and stood in front of the cadets.\n“I will select a jade stone from among you and make him a seed. Those chosen will be tutored and taught by this king himself, and will bring honor to our organization.”\nIt’s still awkward looking down from this high, but the cadets seem to understand.\n“I, Your Majesty, will I be able to learn the Holy Laws if I become your squire?”\nKim Jae-hyuk ranks in the top three in terms of skill among the cadets gathered here so he was naturally confident that he would be selected.\n“The Holy Law can be taught to anyone. However, it is only by the grace of the gods that any of you are qualified to use it.”\n“The Book of the Ten Thousand Gods…….”\nIn short, if you want to learn the Holy Law, you have to convert first.\nThe cadets are familiar with the gods of Leon’s world thanks to the Ten Thousand Gods YouTube channel.\nLeon thought most of them would choose the God of War and Flame. In any case, the cadets were attracted by Leon’s demonstration of the Holy Law.\n-I saw it on YouTube, and it was amazing.\n-What about the fact that he just empowered the whole army? How the hell did he do that?\nThis is the most media-savvy generation so they’ve come to know what the Ten Thousand Gods Guild is all about and what Leon has done.\n-But it looks like they edited the videos. The camera work is so perfect.\n– They say he’s stronger than an S-class, but is that true? Isn’t there a little bit of bullshit in there?\n-The big demon he killed looked like he was a mess, but isn’t he supposed to be weak?\nHa-ri was dumbfounded by what he heard.\nEven a good-natured Ha-ri would be furious at such a stupid thing. How can they be so immature?\nAn Archdemon is a catastrophe that, upon its appearance, puts the government…no, all governments on the continent on high alert and, if necessary, dispatches their own S-rank hunters to eliminate it in advance.\nHave they forgotten that the Archdemons that have appeared so far have been able to wipe out whole cities?\n“It’s Soo-ho.”\n“Eh, big sister?”\n“Soo-ho, you can’t be impolite to His Majesty, I’m just saying this because I’m really worried as your sister.”\n“……I can see that.”\nHa-ri was worried that Soo-ho, who had grown up like a brother to her in the orphanage, had picked up some bad habits while he was away.\nShe couldn’t imagine the Lionheart King looking the other way just because he was a rambunctious adolescent boy.\n“…….”\nChen So-yeon and Kim Jae-hyuk also heard the warning and her warning made them both a little nervous.\n“We’ll have to see what you’re capable of first. Bring your swords to the fight.”\n“”?????””\nThe cadets looked puzzled at Leon’s words since he didn’t give them time to adjust.\n“The time limit is…yes, until the last one is down. Oh well, you’re not going to die anyway. The Holy Grail will heal your wounds.”\nThe Hunters, who had been in full training before the cadets arrived, shuddered but their bodies had already regenerated ‘without a scratch’.\n“Ah, no, wait, what does that mean-”\nNo way? Really? That uneasiness turned to certainty when Leon landed in the middle of the cadets, his steps as light as a breeze.\n“About forty of you, I hope you at least made it to this king’s body.”\nIn the next moment, there was an enormous surge of power that was enough to make the more sensitive among the cadets doubt their senses,\n“Dodge!”\nImmediately after Ha-ri’s voice rang out, Leon’s finger shot to the forehead of one of the cadets. A flick of the finger, and──\n-Bam!\nThe cadet who was hit in the forehead was knocked back with full force and bounced like a fan baseball but the huge aftermath swept the cadets in the straight line together.\n* * * *\nThe cadets of Hunter Academy are the elite of the Hunter world.\nAmong the growing number of Awakened, they awakened at a young age, and by the time they reach their senior year, they are already battle-hardened.\nThey’re used to dealing with monsters, and they have the safety guidance of their professors, who are also high-ranking Hunters, but there are several who have cleared the orange gate.\n“We… didn’t hesitate, did we?”\nKim Jae-hyuk couldn’t believe what was happening in front of him and so did Han Soo-ho.\n“At first, we all panicked, but we immediately raised our weapons and fought…….”\nHan Soo-ho catches the real sword that his classmate was wielding between his fingers and at the same time, they saw Leon slamming the sword’s owner to the ground.\nHe was too strong.\nThe cadets never took unarmed opponents lightly and the attacked cadet didn’t hesitate to swing his sword at the instinctive stinging sensation.\nHowever, even with the sword and its unique skill, it can’t even move away from the spot, let alone reach his body.\n“What kind of monster is that…….?”\nChen So-yeon, who was holding her own sword, didn’t dare to charge at Leon. Her feet felt heavy, as if she was dueling with her grandfather. No, judging from the momentum, it might be more than that.\nChen So-yeon had been raised to be the successor of the number one guild in the country, the Divine Sword Guild. Under the tutelage of Chen Jin-soo, the so-called Berserker, she had more practical experience than her senior, Ha-ri.\nBut she has never seen a monster that can overwhelm Hunters with its momentum alone, without even moving from its spot.\n“Kids, don’t just rush in.”\nHan Ha-ri had gotten away early and was waiting for an opportunity and Han Soo-ho replied.\n“Sister… Do you think you can win?”\n“No, it’s impossible. He hasn’t even summoned the holy sword, let alone his horse.”\n“????”\nSoo-ho wanted to say something else, but Ha-ri naturally gave the cadets instructions. Being the oldest and an A-rank Hunter wasn’t for nothing.\n“Do you remember the joint gate attack in the second and third grades? Just like the boss raids back then?”\n“Sis…but don’t you think it’s a bit unfair to treat people as boss monsters?”\nIn response to Soo-ho common sense tackle, Kim Jae-hyuk pointed his finger at Leon.\n“Soo-ho, don’t you think he’s worse than a boss monster?”\n“…….”\n“I agree.”\n“So-yeon, even you…….”\nChen So-yeon frowned at the tingling sensation from earlier and agreed with Ha-ri’s plan.\n“Hurry up, senior. I don’t think it’ll take more than a minute for us to be wiped out.”\nThen it happened.\nAmong the cadets being swept away like leaves in a gust of wind, a hulking cadet charged at Leon, holding a mace.\nThe large cadet’s skin was as hard as steel.\n“Kaaaah!”\nUnique Skill Iron Skin, a skill that hardens the skin of the entire body, eliminating the need for armor.\n-Bam!\n“Huh?!”\nThe cadet collapses and vomits up what he ate this morning, and Leon kicks his tongue.\n“You’re so weak, you trusted your skills too much and neglected to train.”\nHis armored skin shattered like glass with a snap of Leon’s fingers and the cadets couldn’t believe it.\n“Now!”\nHa-ri’s shout sends Soo-ho and Jae-hyuk running. Jae-hyuk, a spearman, and Soo-ho, a shield swordsman, attacked at the same time.\nOf course, the difference in reach between fingers and spears is incomparable so Jae-hyuk and Soo-ho don’t rush in and attack from out of Leon range.\n“It’s a solid, standard attack but you’re overconfident based on the difference in length of our weapons.”\nLeon snaps his fingers. The same finger flick as before but the difference was that he hit a spear instead of flesh.\n-Bang!\nThe spear pole snapped and bounced upward.\n“What power?!”\nLeon’s fist stretches out toward the defenseless Jae-hyuk but in a moment of desperation, Soo-ho instinctively raises his shield to protect Jae-hyuk.\n-Tap!\n“Huh?”\nWhat Leon did was simple. He threw Soo-ho’s shield straight up into the air.\nHe slipped his left arm through the handle of the shield, and Soo-ho was sent flying through the air.\nSimply grabbing a shield and throwing a person into the air?\n“Is he even human…….?”\n“Kuhhh!”\nSoo-ho flew in the air for a moment before falling down and Leon tapped him with his foot to help him up.\n“Come on, get up. You’re not tired already, are you?”\n“Oh, no!”\nSoo-ho scrambled to his feet, and the two of them clashed, parrying Leon’s blows but his unreasonable physical strength overwhelms them both.\n“Jae-hyuk, what should we do? He’s a monster!”\n“Do you get it now?!”\nA shadow leaps from Leon’s back.\n“Your Majesty, brace yourself!”\nHa-ri leaps in the air, increasing his momentum, her sword is aimed at Leon’s defenseless head, but──\n-Bam!\nHe caught the blade with one hand.\n“……Doesn’t that hurt your palm?”\n“I thought you said it was a big move.”\nHa-ri replies with an embarrassed look at Leon’s point.\n“You know my skills, right?”\nAt that moment an explosion erupted as the flames that had been compressed around the blade burned through the air and shot directly at Leon.\nIt was an application of Beatrice’s compression of power from earlier. But──\n“The God of War and Flame protects me. Fire cannot hurt me.”\nLeon didn’t even get a scratch on his palm, let alone a burn. The difference in physique preceded the difference in power. But then──\nThe sound of iron grinding against iron came from Leon’s palm as Ha-ri had pulled her sword out of his grasp.\n‘I may not have your power, but I didn’t waste it.’\nShe had talent, after all. With the sword free, Ha-ri stabs the fire-encased blade at full speed.\n“I thought I told you fire doesn’t work.”\nStill, she didn’t hesitate and Leon’s eyes widened.\nReflected in her pupils a sword and a spear glowed with an eerie light.\nAt the same time as Ha-ri’s stabbing, Kim Jae-hyuk and Han Soo-ho attacked without missing a beat.\nIn other words, the fire was meant to draw Leon’s attention but Ha-ri hadn’t expected that Leon would see Jae-hyuk and Su-ho in her eyes at that moment.\n‘That’s a good combination, but….’\nIt was obvious. Moreover, if Leon dodges, they will collide with each other.\nHe was about to step aside half a pace, hoping for a collision when a sharp foreboding flashes through Leon’s mind.\n‘There’s another one?’\nA frenzy of magic erupts as the hairs on the back of Leon’s neck stand on end and a deadly bullet was fired.\nChen So-yeon sword specializes in stabbing and her thrusts were also an art form in themselves.\nThe flashing blade was aimed precisely at Leon’s retreating gap.\n“Not bad.”\nLeon’s voice was heard even by the fallen cadets in the corner before they were swept away by the onslaught, their eyes widening as they focused solely on the tip of the blade.\n“Realize that there is an ‘overwhelm’ that renders all your finesse and coordination useless.”\n“Huh?”\nHe caught the stabbing sword with his hand, not even looking at the flash of light from the square.\nIs that even possible, without having eyes in the back of his head?\nLeon held Ha-ri’s blazing sword in his left hand and So-yeon’s flashing sword in his right and his palms tightened as a terrible crunching sound of metal was heard.\nIn the next moment, even Soo-ho and Jae-hyuk weapons, which had arrived in the space of 0.7 seconds, were shattered by Leon.\n“Low-grade material made just by hammering away at it instead of capturing the energy of the stars? You should arm yourself properly.”\nLeon’s hands were still intact after having smashed the weapons of four people in an instant.\n“What the…….”\nHe actually smashed a weapon made of spirit stones with just his strength?\n“Is…Your Majesty…a human?”\n“Pardon me. I am a demigod.”\nThey knew he was strong, but this kind of power is beyond their imagination.\nLeon’s icy gaze fell on the four of them as the two failed to capitalize on a golden opportunity and Ha-ri cautiously raised her hands.\n“Ha, surrender?”\n“How can you surrender already, when your limbs are still intact?”\n“Does that mean…?”\n“If you want to be treated like a soldier.”\nHa-ri shakes his head in exasperation, she has no intention of having salt water for her meals.",

      "content": "Chapter 56: How strong is a Holy Knight?\nThe wanton violence in the name of testing was over.\nThe training grounds were shattered and the sight of the craters sent a shiver down the spine of Koo Dae-sung and the Hunters.\n‘Even the cavalry charge in training wasn’t at full strength.’\n‘He let us see this intentionally.’\n‘How strong is this guy?’\nLeon sorted the 44 cadets into 3 groups, though they were not as evenly distributed as the soldiers.\nThere were only Han Ha-ri and Han Soo-ho, plus Kim Jae-hyuk and Chen So-yeon, in Group 1, and thirteen in Group 2. The remaining twenty-seven were categorized as Group 3.\n“Group 1 will be treated as trainee knights. You are not official knights, but you have shown enough promise to advance to that level, depending on your training.”\nIn short, they were talented….but the other cadets looked disgruntled.\n“You mean…we’re not talented?”\n“Well, I’m the same grade B-rank in the official assessment and If I train a little more I can reach A-rank…!”\n“Shut up, you’re not even at the level of a squire. To say that you’ve been systematically training for more than five years and you’re only at the seed level… I’m speechless.”\nThe cadets clamped their mouths shut at Leon’s words. What in the world is a squire, and how could he demean them, the elite Hunters of Korea?\n“However, if you train diligently under this king for three months, you should be able to make some progress. I can see buds by the second. But…….”\nLeon’s gaze drifts to group 3, where most of the cadets were placed.\n“You have a long way to go.”\nLeon said no more, but sighed softly and sat back in his seat.\n“The training of a soldier is simple: constantly overloading the body.”\nBones break, fuse, and become harder, muscles tear, regenerate, and become denser.\n“What about the heart and lungs? Are long-distance runners born with them? Repeating the same actions and pushing their limits. It’s a very basic discipline.”\nIt’s a training regimen common to the Hunters of the Ten Thousand Gods. Leon’s four weeks of compressed training overturned the limits of the D-rank hunters.\n“But knights are different. I will raise you to be knights. One of you will be a Kingdom Knight… the rest of you will have to advance by at least one rank.”\n“I don’t understand the criteria, Your Majesty.”\nChen So-yeon raised her hand. She knew what the word “knight” meant but didn’t understand how Leon classified knights.\n“Hmm, in the Lionheart Kingdom, there are five levels of knighthood.”\nFirst, there was the Knight Errant, a wandering knight who has never been formally knighted. These wandering knights must travel throughout the kingdom to prove themselves and earn their lord’s appointment.\nFor this reason, no knight will address a wandering knight as “Sir”.\n“Knights of the Realm (Kingdom Knights) are knights who have proven themselves and received an official title. They are eligible for membership in the Knight Orders, and become the direct subordinates of a War Knight.”\n“The War Knights are next?”\nLeon shook his head at Soo-ho’s question.\n“War Knight is a title. A commander, if you will. Next are the Quest Knights.”\n“Quest Knights?”\n“They are wanderers who leave everything behind to fulfill the quests of the gods. They must be prepared to endure decades of wandering to fulfill their quest.”\n“Ugh…….”\n“Decades…….”\nLeon was not disappointed to see that they were already fed up, for his own hardships as a knight had never been easy.\n“I don’t expect you to walk the path. It’s too hard for young ones like you.”\n“Your Majesty…were you also a Quest Knight?”\nHa-ri had heard Leon talk about being a Quest Knight or a Holy Knight many times before, so he must have traveled the path as well.\n“That’s right. This king fulfilled the quest of Arianna, the goddess of light and justice, through the Path. Thus, he became a Holy Knight.”\n“Holy Knight…….”\n“Huh? I thought I heard a story on Youtube about Yakt Spinner being a Holy Knight?”\n“Guess so?”\nThe cadets discuss the story of Yappy’s edited YouTube videos. It’s only teenage exuberance that quickly becomes a hustle and bustle.\n“Quiet!”\nThe cadets are silenced.\n“This king’s purpose is to raise you to the level of Kingdom Knights. After that, your path is at the mercy of your faith and the gods.”\nLeon continued to introduce the cadets to the gods of the pantheon and let them choose which deity they wished to worship.\nHowever, they were asked to make offerings to two deities that have domains in common, as knights are required to serve both.\n“Arianna, the goddess of light and justice, and Petos, the god of war and fire, are the virtues that knights must serve.”\nKim Jae-hyuk scratched his head and asked, “So there are two places to pay tribute?”\n“Your Majesty, the god of war and flame is pretty self-explanatory, but what about light and justice? I’m just curious.”\n“Because no matter how victorious one is in war, if the victory is not just, it is nothing but evil.”\n“Oh…….”\nSo that’s why\n, Kim Jae-hyuk was quickly convinced. As Leon was finishing his explanation, Han Soo-ho suddenly raised his hand in question.\n“Your Majesty, isn’t there still a fifth one left?”\n“I see. I thought you didn’t need to know, but I should explain.”\nNo need to know? It’s as if he’s saying it’s a place they’ll never reach, no matter what.\n“Grail Guardian is a title given to only one Holy Knight after he receives the Lionheart. To claim it…means to challenge this king’s kingship.”\nThe cadets swallowed hard at Leon’s declaration.\n“It’s not all about strength, but this is probably the only time you’ll be able to challenge this king. This king’s power is weakened from what it once was, and my strength is comparable to that of a Holy Knight.”\n“What?”\nIt’s…weakened? How strong are the Holy Knights?\n“No, Your Majesty, how strong is a Holy Knight then?”\n“Hmm…….”\nLeon thought about what to use as an example. He had the Holy Knight, Lord Yappy, in front of him but right now, he was weakened.\nEven the Yakt Spinner he saw at the gate was at the bottom of the pack by Holy Knight standards.\n“The strength of a Holy Knight…….”\nLeon began to impart the lessons of the Holy Knights in a way that the modern Earthlings could easily understand.\n* * * *\nGive sixty lives.\nYong-wan realized that this Knight had no intention of letting them live from the start.\n“What are you waiting for, why don’t you just stick your neck out?”\n“Haha… Fuck, that doesn’t even make sense.”\n“Hmm… I don’t know, but that’s an insult.”\nThe Majestic Georgic raised his hammer, a one-handed hammer the size of a man’s torso.\n“You have harmed the soldiers and knights of the kingdom so you shall receive the punishment you deserve.”\nIn full battle stance Yong-wan chuckled, despite the tension of already facing the Field Boss.\n“I can’t help it, I’ll die here.”\nAt that moment behind Georgic’s back a transparent figure took shape. Her identity was Ha Yuri, an S-class Hunter of the Firebird Guild who used her Unique Skill Absolute Invisibility.\nThere are many stealth skills that blend into the darkness, but this one specializes in assassination by making the body itself invisible in broad daylight, blocking all sight, smell, and touch.\nOnce she has her foe’s back, the assassin is relentless and her eyes glow as she scans Georgic. To be precise, it was a skill that finds the weakest spot in the flesh of humans, monsters, and demons alike. But──\n‘What’s that, weaknesses all over the body?’\nShe froze at the skill’s incomprehensible report, but her ambush position was perfect so she aimed for the gap in his armor, the only empty spot on his back, and stabbed her dagger into it.\n-Bang!\n“Huh?”\nIt was a sound that could not have been the sound of a dagger piercing human skin. It felt as if she had stabbed a polished alloy.\n“What kind of human skin…!”\nAt that moment, the shield wielded by Georgic slammed into Ha Yuri. She took a defensive stance, but the force of the impact was enough to make her dizzy.\n“Ugh…!”\nHa Yuri barely regains her footing after being thrown around.\n“Yuri, are you okay!”\n“Healers…!”\nAt the same time as Yong-wan’s words, the healers behind the raiding party began to heal Ha Yuri and only after the three healers unleashed their magic power did her injured arm finally recover.\n“Hmm… a sneak attack. This level of stealth would impress the desert assassins.”\nGeorgic raises his hammer, his face in full battle stance.\n“But a lowly assassin dares to attack a knight of the gods. That alone is a mortal sin.”\n“Miss Yuri, you sure you ‘stabbed’ him?”\n“His skin is like steel, but…I did dig in.”\nAt that, Yong-wan chuckled.\nThis was the poisonous fang of Ha Yuri’s Legendary Dagger Galsa.\nThe moment it pierces the skin, it injects the highest level of poison. The poison is so severe that even large monsters would die from the poisoning.\n“Well, the Red Gate’s Field Boss won’t die from this…but it’s still a significant debuff…”\n“Hahahahahahaha…!”\nHis maniacal laughter stopped just as the eardrums of the raid hunters were about to burst.\n“What kind of barbarians are you, to think that you can harm me, Georgic, protected by the Goddess of Life and Fertility, with poison!”\nGeorgic shouts as if he is unaffected by the poison.\n“Prepare for battle, loyal soldiers of the realm! I, the Majestic Georgic, by the protection of the Goddess, am with you!”\n“Georgic! Georgic!”\n“”The Majestic Georgic!””\n[System Message: Majestic Georgic buff is triggered]\n-【Blessing of the Warnight】, 【Blessing of the Living Saints】, 【Blessing of Life and Abundance】────\nWith thunderous cheers, the soldiers march forward and Dalion, an Errant Knight, also charged on horseback.\nThere are only about 40 of them charging against over 150 attackers. What an ignorant and irrational act.\nBut the outcome was different.\n-Boom!\nFirst, the tanker that was trying to block the charge of Dalion Emchain was knocked out by the blow. The main tank, an A-rank hunter, of the raiding party was unable to block the mounted charge and was knocked to the ground.\n“What!?”\n“Damn it!”\nThe raiders rained down ranged damage on Dalion and his soldiers, including the S-class Hunter Lee Yong-wan archers and a handful of mage-powered magic bombardments. But──\n“How can you harm this army I lead, with cowardly ranged weapons?”\n[Holy Law <Ranged Nullification> is triggered]\n-Weakens ranged attacks by 90% against all troops of Majestic Georgic.\n“What?!”\n“What the fuck is that fraudulent skill?!”\nThe reduced damage of the ranged attacks didn’t do much harm but,\n“Is anyone hurt?”\nAside from Georgic’s questioning, wounds begin to heal on the soldiers who had been hit by the magical bombardment in their dense formation.\n“The damage has plummeted, and they’re recovering?”\n“What the…!”\nThe raiding party realizes that they’re facing less than half of the Kingdom’s forces, and things have changed dramatically.\nFirst, they couldn’t deal damage. Even as the dealers attacked the soldiers with their unique skills, their skin grew tougher and their armor became horrifyingly hard.\nIt was an unreasonable defense, as if each soldier was a medium-sized monster. Little did they know, it was a blessing from the Goddess of Life and Abundance.\n“Shit, it’s the boss! The boss did something!”\nLee Yong-wan, the main leader of the Alliance raiding party, quickly realized what had happened. The cause of the Kingdom’s army becoming abnormally powerful was undoubtedly the influence of Field Boss Georgic.\n“Golden Chul, Hwang Yeon-ha and Yuri Yang take the main fighters to attack the boss. Tanker 1, Park Chan-soo, you will surround the Kingdom army and diligently mow them down!”\n“Understood, Guild Leader!”\nGolden Chul and Hwang Yeon-ha, who were clearly outnumbered even for a coalition, followed the instructions since they were actually reasonable. But reasonable wasn’t always wise.\nYong-Wan fired his bow to keep Georgic at bay, but the ranged weapon couldn’t do any real damage to him.\n“Hmm?”\nThere is damage.\nGeorgic looks puzzled at the pain he feels, and at that moment, the golden Chul two-handed hammer is swung.\nA loud thud strikes the shield and the impact through the shield must have been considerable, but he didn’t even flinch.\n“Hmph, good power.”\n“Ooo….”\nFeeling threatened by a one-handed hammer the size of his own two-handed hammer, Golden Chul jerked back.\nThe hammer smashed into his iconic golden armor, causing the compressed air to dent the ground.\nMeanwhile, the assassin Ha Yuri and Huang Yeon-ha had gotten behind Georgic’s back.\nHa Yuri, the fastest member of the raiding party, targets a gap in the armor with her dagger and dodges a hammer strike, giving Hwang Yeon-ha time to prepare her attack.\n-Kaaaaaaaah!\nHer unique gauntlets, which boasted 65% armor penetration, slammed into Georgic’s side with all her might.\n“Kkkk…! Not bad, bitch!”\nFor the first time, she can hear Georgic’s booming laughter.\n“You’re dirty tough, maniac!”\nDespite the onslaught of the four S-rank Hunters, Georgic didn’t back down in the slightest. In fact, he was steadily advancing and pummeling the squad of Hunters.\n“Crack!”\n“Crazy…How does an A-rank tanker get knocked out in one hit?!”\nEven if it was a Field Boss, could a single human-sized entity be this strong?\nWasn’t the nation’s highest ranked raiding team, which had hunted countless boss monsters, powerless?\n“Damn it, my ranged attacks are being halved, it’s like I don’t even do half of my usual damage!”\n“Dealers, do something! The tanks can’t hold out!”\n“What are we supposed to do?”\nWhat a difference a single knight could make\n.\nLee Yong-wan shivered and took off his glasses.\n“Damn it, Miss Yuri, you…!”\n“……You said I wouldn’t use it because it’s expensive.”\n“Kids are dying, it’s not about money!”\nAs if she had been waiting for this, Yuri pulled something out of her bosom.\nIt was a scroll and tearing it open, the war hammer that was about to be swung at Golden Chul was ‘bound’ in midair.\n“Oh…! You almost got me! What was that?!”\n“Hmph?”\nGeorgic looked at the ring-shaped shackles restraining his arms.\n“Magic,” he said, “and quite powerful, high level magic at that.”\n“Is that all?”\nYong-wan and Ha Yuri approached as Yong-wan unfolded a scroll and Ha Yuri pulled out a second one.\nIt was the most expensive guild item that could only be used by Vice Guild Leader Ha Yuri and Guild Leader Lee Yong-wan.\n“The highest level of sealing magic that binds even hydras. There’s…….”\nThe second scroll was torn and at that moment, a huge magic circle unfolded beneath Georgic.\n“Are this…some kind of magic coordinates?”\n“You ignorant knight can’t recognize it! This is a 2 billion Flame Burst Scroll that I bought at the Magic Tower, and I’m going to roast your armor to a crisp!”\nIt was a deadly combo of two 800 million Binding Scrolls and a 2 billion Flame Burst!\nBurning 3.6 billion in an instant made Yong-wan’s eyes water, but he thought it was a small price to pay to be able to kill such a monster.\n“It’s definitely powerful magic.”\nDespite being bound by the binding magic, Georgic managed to wiggle his limbs.\n“Is it possible for him to break free?”\n“Is that possible?!”\n“Ha, ha, ha… don’t worry too much, you won’t be able to break free until the casting is over anyway, right?”\n“Break free? Why would I want to?”\n“What?”\nGeorgic raises his hammer and an intangible energy swarms around it.\nThe Hunters, wondering what the hell they were doing, grew weary of the sight as it slowly consumed the air around them. And then──\nBoom.\nThe gigantic hammer strikes the ground…no, the ground.\nThe crushed earth caused an earthquake that was so destructive that it was hard to stand.\n“…….”\n“…….”\nThe Hunters, in their dazed state, tried to comprehend the phenomenon before them, but they couldn’t, their common sense refusing to acknowledge the reality before them.\nOf course, the S-class Hunters boasted that a single punch or slash could cut through armor.\nMany of their unique skills boast ridiculous cutting power or cause destruction and mages who are known for their firepower can be considered human artillery but not on this level.\nThe crater looks like a bomb went off and nothing was left untouched by the shockwave.\nThe ground was just torn apart as that single strike had changed the landscape.\nIs this…is this what human power can do?\nHow can this absurdity, this destruction, be allowed by one man?\nHow in the world did God give one man this kind of power?\n“What the hell is this…….”\nYong-wan stared dumbfounded at the ground where Georgic stood, seeking pointless confirmation from Ha Yuri, with whom he had torn the scroll.\n“Ma, what about the magic?”\n“Canceled…never mind, just hammered.”\n“Canceled? Magic…can be canceled?”\n“That’s right, magic is only triggered when the magic circle is intact after all, so don’t ask me…!”\nThe martial power displayed by the Field Boss of Jeju Island Gate, Holy Knight Majestic Georgic, was far beyond their common sense.",

      "content": "Chapter 57: All Seeds are Equal\nTL Note: To avoid confusion the Hunters Leon recruited will be refered to as recruits while the students from the Academy will be known as cadets.\nLike the trainees, the academy cadets were to eat, sleep, and train in the Ten Thousand Gods guild compound.\n“Hmph, the cadets’ faces must be a sight to behold.”\n“That’s right.”\nThe first batch of recruits at the Ten Thousand Gods Guild Koo Dae-sung and Kim Do-han, now enlisted as regular soldiers, imagined the looks on the cadets’ faces when they saw their dinner.\nDuring their training, they had become accustomed to the vicious diet of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild.\nMassive amounts of salt and massive amounts of sugar, it was a diet of nothing but salt and calories.\nOnly the professional soldiers…the first recruits who had been promoted to Man-At-Arms, were able to eat well now, but the memories of those days…were as horrible as the sauce.\nThe cadets, on the other hand, weren’t looking forward to dinner either. They’re in the Naju Plains, which is to say, the countryside.\n“I see the villagers walking around and they’re eating what…….”\n“Corn and potatoes.”\n“Or canned herbs from the back mountains.”\n“Can you eat that?”\nFor the cadets, most of whom are natives of Seoul and the Seoul metropolitan area this is what it feels like to be rural.\nAlthough there is a gap between the cadets and the recruits neither side thinks about the quality of the food but there is one common feeling: hunger.\nThe hunger pangs from the day’s intense training were bubbling up to a growl.\n“Mmm, I could eat all the rice they serve.”\n“……I agree.”\nJae-hyuk and Soo-ho, who were ranked first in the group, had to endure Leon’s harsh training while Ha-ri gave them a pitying gaze from the side.\n“Well…you better not get your hopes up.”\nI’m starving, and all I can eat is salt and sugar water. Even in the orphanage, I’d never had a rumbling stomach.\n“Hmm, I’m glad there’s no shortage of places for everyone to sit.”\nLeon walked in.\nThere were a lot of people sitting in the courtyard on roughly laid out seats. It was the kind of scene you might see at a middle school dramatic arts retreat, but Leon didn’t mind.\nThey would have to practice eating here in the rain, so they would have to get used to it.\n“Bring the meal.”\nAt Leon’s command, the gate to the courtyard opened and the residents entered with dishes. The dish they were serving the second-grade recruits was… needless to say, sugar-salt water.\n“Ah~ So this is it.”\n“I thought it would be different today.”\n“Let’s have some sweet potatoes before bed.”\nThe second-grade recruits, who had gotten used to the Ten Thousand Gods Guild drill, gulped down the sugar-salt water in front of them, and the cadets’ expressions twisted as they watched.\n“What is that?”\n“Water? No, what’s in the water?”\n“Alas, it’s called salt water.”\n“???”\nThe cadets’ faces twist in disbelief as they realize that they’re eating something like that.\n“Nu, Nu, what is that?”\nSoo-ho asks, wide-eyed, and Ha-ri replies with a dejected expression.\n“Salt water. I added sugar.”\n“……Why?”\n“Lord Yappy will explain that part to you in a ‘logical’ way……!”\nAt Ha-ri’s comment, Yappy came over. The minimalist mechanical spider gives a logical explanation of the sugar-salt-water diet.\n-Humans. Can survive on a minimum of nutrients and calories.\n“?????”\n-Reducing food costs. Increased ‘venom’ factor. Very efficient.\n“”?????””\nThe cadets were stunned by the vicious logic.\n“Ooh, we have to eat that stuff too?”\n“No way. How can you live on that?”\nWhen the cadets’ faces grew heavy, Koo Dae-sung spoke up.\n“Hmph, don’t get me wrong. After the training period is over, we will give them proper food.”\nTrue to his word, the first batch of cadets…now promoted to professional soldiers, are being served proper rice and side dishes.\nKimchi, a staple of the Korean diet, is served with the meal, and meat-based dishes are also distributed. The rice and local crops they are given are all “blessed” and rare.\nAside from the taste, the soldiers were very satisfied with the fact that they were getting stronger and less sick with each meal.\nJust get through the training period. For the second-grade recruits, the diet of the first-grade recruits is a hopeful prospect, therefore, they can endure while the cadets now have to become aware of the salt and sugar water in front of them.\n“……Do we really have to eat this?”\nEven Han Soo-ho, who grew up as an orphan, was stunned by the salt water in front of him, let alone Chen So-yeon, the heir to the largest guild in the country.\nHe turned to his sister, the one he’d always counted on, but Ha-ri smirked and turned her head away.\n“It’s easier if you give up.”\n“……unbearable.”\nHaving said that, this is only the second time Ha-ri has had salt and sugar water.\nThe first time, she saw the first-grade recruits survive on it, so she tried it to see if it would hold up. But then she spit out the salt water with a yelp and had to listen to Leon’s scolding.\n‘You can do it, Han Ha-ri! You’re an orphan and you’ve suffered in the bottom 1% of South Korea!’\nNo, orphanages are better these days, so maybe 3%?\nHa-ri gulps down her drink, trying to channel her misfortune into willpower.\nThe moment the salted glass slid down her throat, the extreme saltiness burned her throat.\n‘Salty…!’\nSalty. Too salty. So salty that it burned her throat.\nShe wondered if she was going to get esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus) from this but the salty taste was quickly covered by another flavor, the sugar.\n‘Too sweet!\nIf the salt made her mouth burn, the sugar made her tongue burn. The problem is that the flavors are jumbled and painful, and the same goes for the other cadets.\nChen So-yeon, who has undergone a harsh training program, and Han Soo-ho, who knows from his orphanage life that to eat is to live drunk the water but Kim Jae-hyuk tilted his glass to the floor to throw it away.\n-Cheating detected.\nWith a snap, the swung steel wire threatens to kill.\n“Wee, it’s dangerous!”\nHe protests, but the mechanical spider is relentless. The military commander of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild will not take no for an answer.\nWhen the shocking brine meal is over, Leon stands up.\n“Let’s digest this and start training.”\n“What?”\nDigesting something just because you ate it…Ha-ri was more curious about Leon’s reaction, which was different from the way he was used to.\n“…Didn’t they receive time to rest after eating?”\nIt was the basic schedule for the recruits.\nMorning training, then a meal. Rest, then training again. Then a meal and then bed.\nIn other words, after dinner, it was straight to rest and sleep. Unofficially, they were also fed potatoes and sweet potatoes.\n“Tsk, tsk, you are not recruits, you are aspiring knights. How could you think that the training of a soldier and a knight is the same?”\n“Is that so?”\nLeon’s gaze flicked to Chief Kim Jin-soo, who was also participating in the exercise as an observer, apparently unaware of the shocking visual of the salt and sugar water.\n“I told you to be prepared, did you get it?”\n“Uh, that’s right, yes, I did! It’ll be ready to strike sooner or later…….”\n“Not soon. Right now.”\n“……?”\n“The second-grade recruits will rest and sleep as they are while Lord Spinner will supervise. Koo Dae-sung, Kim Do-han, and the rest of you will be ready to depart in ten minutes.”\n“Yes, yes! Understood!”\n“As you order, Your Majesty!”\nThe first class recruits, clearly carrying military flags, ran straight to the weapons storage room and the cadets could only stare after them in bewilderment.\n* * * *\nTo coincide with the cadets’ visit, Leon bought a gate pass.\nIt was an Orc Gate pass that was easy to get since by its nature, the Orc Gate rewards little for the effort.\nThe most expensive item you can get is the Orc Warrior Heart, which is worth at least 400 million won. The problem is, it’s a drop given by the tribe leaders.\nThere’s nothing about him that isn’t intimidating, whether it’s his blood, his warrior sense, his strength, or his special abilities.\nAs such, it’s usually reserved for A-rank raiders, and given their salaries, Heart of the Warrior isn’t even on the expensive end of the spectrum.\nThe rest are a handful of elemental weapons, and even these are too scarce to be a viable option for killing orcs that are at least B-grade.\nAs a result, Orc Gates are often bought and sold at a premium.\nSuch a sale was difficult for the Association to handle, but when Leon stepped forward to buy it, the bidders handed it over.\n“Orc Gate.”\n“Are you okay? Have any of you cleared an Orc Gate before?”\n“Chen So-yeon, Kim Jae-hyuk, and Han Soo-ho are probably the only ones…….”\nThe cadets couldn’t believe that they had come to attack an Orc Gate.\nAfter being tortured with such a flimsy meal, they had come to the Orc Gate to digest it.\n[Quest: A civil war among the orcs is raging. You are a mercenary who has come to join the fray. Help one side to end the civil war and gain the recognition of the Great Chieftain.]\n“Are we supposed to take sides?”\n“At least one orc tribe is on our side.”\nThe cadets breathe a sigh of relief. Normally, this is a quest that can be safely cleared by using friendly orcs as shields as possible. If you fight wisely, the gate won’t be that hard──\n“Hah…….”\n“This…is it?”\n“Of course.”\nHowever, the soldiers’ reactions were quite different. Koo Dae-sung, Kim Do-han, and the other first class recruits had predicted the future.\n“????”\nSoo-ho was about to ask Ha-ri when he realized something was wrong as a group of orcs approached from across the field.\n“Are you mercenaries from the outside world? I am an orc warrior from the proud Tusker Clan-”\n-Thud!\nThe orc warrior didn’t even finish his sentence before his head was blown off.\nA lance that had flown in from nowhere had taken the orc’s chin right off the top.\n“Huh?”\nThe cadets couldn’t react as they saw the orc’s head blown off before their eyes, and neither could the orcs.\nIn disbelief, they look for the source of the spear. No, they didn’t need to look since it had come from the Lionheart King who spewed insults on his pure white steed.\n“By whose permission does this filthy beast open its stinking mouth?”\nThe overwhelming sense of disgust, contempt, and hatred made their skin crawl and the cadets weren’t even the targets.\n“Stop!”\nA voice rings out snapping them out of their reverie as the soldiers reflexively stack their shields and stab their swords.\n“Thud!”\n“Yi, you cowards!”\nThe orcs, caught by surprise, fell back, but the cadets were unable to keep up in the rush.\n“Now, wait a minute, isn’t this a quest where you don’t have to kill them?”\n“Why, why are they attacking them, someone tell me why!”\nBut the soldiers didn’t hesitate a moment.\n“To kill orcs.”\n“That’s a given.”\n“”?????””\n[The Greatest Orc Slayer]\n◆Effects:\nDeal 50% more damage against Orcs. Fills orcs with fear, confusion, and despair. Spreads undeserved hatred of Orcs. Then it happened. The system message flashed before the cadets’ eyes but it did not end there.\n[Aura of the Lionheart]\n◆Effects:\nGrants Legion Hardened Assault Defense.\nGrants Legion Fortification.\nGrants Legion-strengthened Battalion Reinforcement.\nGrants Legion Strengthened Valor.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Light Armor.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Tough Skin.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Heavy Strike.\nGrants Legion-Enhanced Archaic Empowerment.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Ranged Resistance.\nGrants Legion Upgrade Keen Gaze.\nGrants Legion Improved Anti-Infantry Slaughter.\nGrants Legion-enhanced Corruption Resistance.\n[Living Demigod]\n[War Knight’s Favor]\n[Grail Guardian]\n[Dragon Slayer’s Honor]\n[Terror of the Evil Species]\n[Demon Lord Slayer]\n[Greatest Demon Slayer]\n[Ranged Abomination]\n[Strongest Charger]\n“Crazy. What is this?”\nAs the cadets were shocked by the traits that appeared, Leon spoke up.\n“Draw your weapons! Take up positions to the left and right of the soldiers! We’ll flank them!”\nA few of the cadets fumbled with their horses as Leon barked orders menacingly while he orcs clashed with the soldiers in a fury and their flanks hollowed out.\n“Charge!”\nLeon ordered the charge while the soldiers as anvils held their ground, the cadets as hammers became shock troops and crashed into the orcs.\nThe cadets’ combat strength might be higher than the soldiers’, but they didn’t know how to charge as a single mass.\n“Ugh…! These guys!”\n“Ouch!”\nThe cadets dug into the flanks, but their breakthrough power was lower than expected. They didn’t have enough strength to break through the orcs’ massive size and heavy defense.\n“We’re through!”\nThe cadets’ formation was about to collapse and crumble under the onslaught of orcs but flames scorched the air and swung through the air, dispersing the horde of orcs.\n“Ha, Ha-ri!”\nHa-ri grinned awkwardly, having slashed two orcs and burned a third in a single blow.\n“Careful, kids, take them down calmly.”\nAt least Ha-ri is used to this insane orc hatred, and she makes up for her lack of impact with her abilities.\n‘The problem is the cadets on the other side.’\nThe cadets, flanking the soldiers, have split in two and surrounded the orcs.\nThere were less than fifty orcs, so they can easily surround them, but unlike this side, where Ha-ri is present on the other side are only cadets.\n‘His Majesty will not help us, and…….’\nIt was then that from the other side of the orcs Ha-ri was burning, a series of eerie voices rang out.\n“You, you little wench!”\n“I’ll cut you in half with my axe!”\nEven in the midst of the bustling clump fight, a single cadet pierced through the space, thrusting her three swords.\nChen So-yeon, the granddaughter of Berserker Chen Jin-soo and the strongest cadet in the academy, was piercing through the orcs’ throats.\nShe’s not the only one, Han Soo-ho, a swordsman, and Kim Jae-hyuk, a spearman were also coping with the orcs’ momentum.\nAs graduating seniors in the academy’s top class, this was not their first time facing orcs.\n“Hmm…….”\nLeon watched their performance while summoning the Holy Grail to heal the frontline soldiers.\nHan Ha-ri was by far the dominant force, she was practically covering half the damage of the right flank by herself.\nShe’s been criticized for her lack of finesse, but in a skirmish like this, she’s an absolute force to be reckoned with.\n“Now! Take care of the burned orcs!”\nShe’s got talent, after all. If taught well the God of War and Flame will be pleased.\nOn the other side, Chen So-yeon, Kim Jae-hyuk, and Han Soo-ho were the big guns.\nThe three of them have experience hunting orcs, and they’re good at it. Han Soo-ho uses his shield to deflect the orcs’ attacks, while Kim Jae-hyuk mows them down with his weapon advantage that makes up for their height difference.\n“The others, on the other hand, are ordinary.”\nThose four were exceptional, and the rest could not be said to be good enough.\nThe soldiers, barely C-rank, were holding the orcs’ attention and couldn’t make a single flanking attack.\nIf it weren’t for their natural physical prowess and a few standouts along with Leon massive buffs, the flankers would have been crushed by the besieging troops.\nThe battle ended in an easy victory and Leon ordered the already exhausted cadets to rest and prepare for the next battle.\n“Your Majesty…….”\nChen So-yeon approached, breathing evenly, as if she hadn’t broken a sweat in the single battle.\n“I allow questions.”\n“Why… Why did you attack the orcs? The quest is clearly to help one of their sides.”\n“We do not spare orcs. Not a single one.”\n“What?”\nLeon decided it was better to declare it in front of everyone than to explain it to just one person.\n“Remember. Orcs are green-skinned beasts.\nThese beasts may speak the language of men, discussing honor and glory, but their honor and glory are nothing more than the violence of vain beasts.\nHave you seen them build a civilization, have you seen them choose conversation over savage violence?”\nIn the thousands of years of history of the Lionheart Kingdom Leon has learned one truth.\nOrcs are talking beasts.\n“They are just beasts that have taken on the guise of a man and covet the honor of warriors.”\nDespicable. These trashy beasts dare to discuss honor and glory that only an honorable race can discuss.\n“You must be resolute in your resolve, these beasts are not worthy of existence. They’re just filthy parasites who should not live.”\nOn modern Earth, orcs are not treated well, to say the least since their brutality and violence make them unacceptable to civilized society.\nBut in a world where political correctness guarantees the human rights of orcs, no one has ever expressed such extreme disgust as Leon.\n“Smash those disgusting molars and stinking spatulas. There should be no hesitation in slaughtering the beasts!\nThe only good orc is a dead orc.\nThere is no need for cowardice in hunting beasts. All that is needed is killing and righteous indignation. Only murderous intent to destroy them!”\n[Greatest Orc Slayer] spreads righteous hatred of orcs.\n* * * *\nUnder the overwhelming charisma of Leon, the orcs at the Orc Gate were slaughtered, one by one.\nHe slaughtered them nonstop until there were no more orcs left at the gate, and the profits were far greater than the original expectations.\n“Wow, three Warrior Hearts and a Spirit Weapon…How much for the Spirit Stones?”\nThe profit was close to 1.2 billion units and while the individual earnings would be unreasonable for an A-rank raider, the Hunters here are C-rank and cadets who haven’t even graduated from the Academy.\nKim Jae-hyuk looked at the pile of loot and calculated his share.\n“There are 96 Hunters, so even if we’re being conservative, we’re looking at six million won per head.”\n“I’ve never caught so many orcs before…….”\n“Soo-ho, you’ve made some money. Are you going to send it to the orphanage?”\n“Half.”\nThe heart of an orc warrior is an item that can fetch half a billion won at auction so the profit would be even higher.\nWith that, the cadets were told to clear the orc gate and collect their allowances, and they approached Yappy, the financial controller, with excited faces.\nThey weren’t used to having an AI machine calculate their earnings, but they figured that a machine would be honest.\n-Deposit completed.\n“Oh, that’s fast, did you calculate it in advance?”\n“The Orc Warrior’s Heart hasn’t even been sold yet… eh?”\nAfter checking their accounts on their smartphones, the two were dumbfounded by the amount of money they had received.\n“Excuse me, Mr. Yappy, I think you made a mistake in my deposit.”\n-No mistake about my math skills.\n“No, no, why is there only 700,000 won in the account? Shouldn’t there be at least 6 million won?!”\n-Kim Jae-hyuk. Battle video analysis. 700,000 won.\n“Uh… You set the bar a little high. No, but why is only 700,000 won in my account!”\n-Taxes\n“What?”\nThe cadets who had received their allowances came to ask, and they got the same answer from Yappy.\n-We took it in advance to save you the trouble.\nThe cadets were stunned by the vicious tax structure.",

      "content": "Chapter 58: Step aside, woman\n“Ugh…!”\nA bone cracked as Golden Lion Vice Guild Leader Huang Yeon-ha stood up, holding her throbbing skull.\n“Damn, my bones are going to break.”\nHer last memory was confusing, why was she down? She remembers running away from that monster Field Boss…….\n“You’re up.”\n“Who…whoop!”\nShe was beautiful enough to make her blurry eyes flash. The thin clothes woven from natural fabrics, the necklace with amber and the bird feathers were far from the ready-made products of civilization.\nHuang Yeon-ha realized at once that the woman before her was a resident of the gate.\n“Who…?”\n“My name is Hildir, shaman of the Woodsling tribe. A warrior.”\n“What, a warrior?”\nHuang Yeon-ha looks dumbfounded at the unfamiliar title. But Hildir knelt down and nursed her back to health.\n“Because you tried to protect us from those cruel kingdom soldiers.”\n“Ah…….”\nIt was then that Yeonha realized that these were the “slaughtered tribesmen.” And just then, the tent opened and someone entered.\n“My Sister~ You’re alive!”\n“What?”\nGolden Chul, the guild leader of the Golden Lion Guild walked into the tent.\n“What happened?”\n“We ran away…I think I’ve avoided being tracked.”\n“Tracked? Eh, I don’t remember.”\nYeon-ha ruffles her hair and demands an explanation.\n“What do you remember?”\n“That…the ground was crushed and that I ran away…….”\n“A whole day’s worth of memories, no wonder.”\nGolden Chul said, gently stroking his sister’s head while Yeon-ha, who was still in pain and unable to speak up as usual, listened in silence as he explained.\n“After the spell failed, we made a beeline for it. They only had light infantry, so it was hard to track us, but…….”\nHoly Knight Georgic chased the Hunters with a handful of knights since he was not satisfied with the dozens of prisoners they had already taken.\n“From there, the warriors of the Woodsling tribe here helped. We were able to stop them with a trap, but when you fought one of them, you were hit with a hammer.”\nFor two days afterward, Yeon-ha did not open her eyes.\n“Be thankful. If it weren’t for shaman Hildir here, you’d be dead.”\n“Where are the healers?”\n“For some reason, they couldn’t heal you.”\n“Holy Knight, Georgic, has a curse that prevents people from healing others’ wounds. It’s a reversal of the power of healing and regeneration.”\nHildir pulled her t-shirt off and Yeon-ha blushed at the suddenness of the action, but then realized that something had been imprinted on the underside of her navel.\n“What is this!”\n“It’s a spell imprint I made to restore you to health. It has restored your body.”\nYeon-ha looked at her brother and he shrugged.\n“They say it’s a power unique to the tribes in this area, and the power granted varies depending on the imprint.”\n“Really?”\n“By the way, can you get up, so I can take you to the meeting, if you don’t mind?”\n“I can do that.”\nYeon-ha rose from her sickbed and headed for the tent set up as an emergency meeting room as Hildir followed them.\n“Oh, you’re awake, aren’t you?”\n“Are you okay?”\nYong-wan and Ha Yuri were there as well. All the main leaders of the raid were there, along with some unfamiliar faces.\n“You’ve awakened, warrior.”\n“Who…….”\n“My name is Beldi, chieftain of the Woodsling tribe.”\n“I am Grisly, Chief of the Bearsun tribe.”\n“I am Urzon, Chief of the Balterhorn tribe.”\nThere were several other tribal chiefs there, all of whom appeared to be natives of the area.\n‘What the hell. When did they get together like this?’\n‘This quest, apparently, it’s not just a raid.’\nNPCs can be hostile or friendly but the goal of the quest is to defeat the field boss, Majestic Georgic, and stop the massacre.\nOne way to do this is to enlist the help of the tribes on the receiving end of the massacre.\n“Since everyone is here, let’s start the tactical meeting right away.”\nLee Yong-wan asked Woodsling Shaman Hildir to explain for the stunned Huang Yeon-ha.\n“The king’s army has been slaughtering and plundering us, calling us heretics, skinning us and executing us in horrible ways.”\nThe trigger was a show of force by a fed-up tribe.\nThey fought back and killed the knights and soldiers who were executing and setting fire to the elderly and infirm but that only invited more force.\n“The Holy Knight Georgic…that horrible monster had already wiped out three tribes.”\nThe remaining tribes either fled deeper into the woods or defended their homes. The Woodsling, Bearsun, and Balterhorn tribes united to fight back.\n“But the creature’s power is too great. We called upon our gods for help… and this is how the warriors came to save us.”\n“…….”\nHuang Yeon-ha was somewhat convinced. In short, they would act as heroes and receive support to repel the kingdom’s forces.\nThis seems to be the core of this Jeju Island Red Gate.\n“That guy… he’s damn strong.”\nThe 150 elite raiders were helplessly defeated even with four S-class Hunters.\n“Georgic has a defense that can block the charge of a giant bull, and a recovery that can regenerate even a burned body. Some say he can survive the destruction of his heart, and as long as he lives, his army is similarly blessed.”\nYeah, that’s the problem. Georgic himself is ridiculously tough, but even the men under his command receive powerful buffs.\n“The only attack that worked was a soft-shelled weapon. Was it the MF-07 series from Supreme Heimer, with the ability to channel that magic into energy?”\n“Well, yeah.”\nYeon-ha looked at her weapon’s abilities: Armor penetration up to 65%. That had been the only effective hit.\n“I think I’ll have to look around for a vanguard item…….”\n“What’s a Vanguard item?”\nHildir asked, one of the tribesmen who hadn’t caught on to what the Hunters were saying.\n“Oh, a…something that ignores armor to some degree.”\nIn short, impact power. No matter how hard the armor is, it doesn’t mean that it will do zero damage to the inside.\nAfter explaining it logically, Hildir nodded as if realizing something.\n“I see. The tusk imprint of my tribe’s Mazer…it would have a similar effect.”\n“Mazer’s tusk imprint?”\n“Yes. It’s an imprint that amplifies a warrior’s strength and strengthens their resilience. It’s what allowed our tribes to stand up to the kingdom’s soldiers.”\nHildir said she would try the imprint on one of the hunters as a demonstration.\nShe removed his clothes and imprinted the mark on his skin, and the effect was summarized in a system message.\n[Mazer’s tusk imprint]\n-Increases defense penetration by 35%.\n-Muscle strength and endurance increase by 20%.\n“Awesome!”\nThe Hunters asked to get themselves engraved as well.\n“Great… With this, we’ll be able to take on that monster.”\n“Warriors.”\nThe tribal leaders bowed.\n“Please save us. We will help in any way we can.”\nFor the sake of the slaughtered tribes, Huang Yeon-ha clenched her fists and vowed to save them.\n* * * *\nJeju Island Yewol Farm is the largest horse ranch in Korea, supplying one-third of the horses for the country’s racetracks.\nThe peaceful ranch, which usually has only trainers and jockeys, is bustling with people for some reason.\n“Wow, real horses.”\n“My first time on a horse.”\nIt was a large field trip from the Hunter Academy, and the leader is Leon Dragonia Lionheart of the popular Ten Thousand Gods Guild.\n“Oh, welcome, Your Majesty.”\nRancher Park Soon, who had been warned in advance by the Association staff, greeted Leon with as much humility as he could muster.\n“Hmm, thank you for your hospitality on such short notice.”\nLeon patted him on the shoulder, a rare gesture for a commoner but in the knightly kingdom of Lionheart, the profession of horse breeding is a noble one.\n“As I’m sure you’ve heard, I’ve come to ask for steeds for my cavalry.”\n“Yes, yes, yes…! Our Yewol Ranch is the largest ranch in the country, and we supply the most horses for racing! We have some of Japan’s most famous racehorse bloodlines, so our horses are very good from the seed!”\n“Hmm, yes, the sire of the horse is important. Let’s take a look at the horses.”\nLeon left the rancher behind and approached the cadets.\n“To a knight, a horse is a lifelong companion. It is important to be able to communicate with them and become one with them. Get close to them, interact with them, and ride them.”\nLeon walked over to the trainers and other ranch staff and patted them on the shoulder.\n“Be good to them for the day.”\nOrdinarily, people would have thought he was passing the buck, but Leon was a known king of the Otherworld, and when he asks for a favor with a benevolent smile, few commoners can refuse.\nThere’s something about his natural charm and uncharacteristic aura that makes you feel flattered to be asked.\n“Ah, of course!”\n“I’ll do my best to serve you!”\nKnowing that the amount of money delivered by Yappy was not small, the employees were determined to do their best.\n“That’s a lot of talking.”\nJust then, a woman walked by with a graceful gait, protected by a parasol held by Ha-ri.\nShe wore a black dress and a veil covered her face. It’s an awkward combination of colors that would be considered cosplay in modern civilization, but there’s something noble about the clothes, as if they existed just for her.\nEven beyond the veil, the staff and cadets were mesmerized by the sight of Queen Beatrice.\n“Thank you for coming on such short notice, Queen.”\n“His Majesty has invited me, how could I refuse?”\nQueen Beatrice replied politely, casually offering the back of her hand. Leon gladly bent down slightly on one knee and kissed the back of the Queen’s hand.\n“Will you allow me the honor of serving you?”\n“With pleasure.”\nJoining the queen in inspecting the horses was Ha-ri, naturally dressed as a handmaiden and holding a parasol.\n“Your Majesty, these are the finest horses in our ranch.”\nThe horses prepared for Leon and the Queen were among the finest in Yewol Ranch. Some of them were winners of domestic races time and time again.\n“Hmm, not bad.”\nThe condition of the horses was not bad. They were proven horses in domestic races and had been bred to the finest stallions, so their bloodlines were the best.\n“Not bad.”\n“Would you like to take a ride?”\n“Sure. Would His Majesty recommend one?”\n“Hmm, in that case…how about that black one?”\nLeon pointed to the previous year’s winner, a horse named Black Comet and the rancher nodded, but awkwardly.\n“He’s a great horse, but…I think he’s a little too fierce for a slender lady to ride. He’s also a large horse.”\n“You needn’t worry.”\nAt the queen’s gentle refusal, the rancher, Mr. Park Soon, stepped back with a worried expression.\n“Pick one for you, too.”\n“Me, too, hmm~”\nHa-ri looked at the horses with anticipation, especially the white horse with the most beautiful, cool mane.\n“How about that white horse…….”\n“That yellow horse has a nice mane and lots of muscle. Take that one.”\n“……Yes.”\nHa-ri meekly complied and walked over to mount the horse.\n“Umm, how do I ride this?”\nOf course, Ha-ri is a Seoul native and all she knows about horses is what she’s seen on TV and Leon’s horse, Stallion.\nShe doesn’t know how to ride a horse.\n“Why don’t you just get on?”\nAs Ha-ri fidgeted and held the horse’s reins carefully, Leon nudged her.\n“Move over, commoner (woman).”\nLeon held out his hand to Beatrice, ignoring Ha-ri.\n“Take my hand, Lady.”\n“Oh, thank you.”\nTaking Leon’s hand, Beatrice easily climbed on the black horse.\n“May this king lead the way?”\n“Your Majesty would act as a coachman himself? That would be undeserved.”\n“It is a knight’s virtue and honor to serve such a noble lady as you.”\n“Ho-ho-ho, thank you, I will accept your favor.”\nLeon took hold of the reins and gently guided the horse.\nThe fierce, wild stallion was surprisingly calm under Leon’s leadership. But Ha-ri, who hadn’t been able to get on the horse until then, is appalled at the pair’s behavior.\n“This is so discriminatory…….”\nThe difference in their attitudes toward her and the queen is worlds apart. Sighing, Ha-ri jumps up to get on the horse that has no intention of letting her ride.\n“Hunter, that will spook the horse!”\n“I’m sorry.”\nThe horse whinnied, a little surprised, but Ha-ri managed to get on anyway and hurried after the queen’s black steed.\n“Miss Ha-ri, I hope you had a good ride?”\n“Yes.”\nFor a first-time rider, Ha-ri’s riding wasn’t bad. This wasn’t exactly beginner’s luck.\n“You have good compatibility with horses. They are gentle and easy to handle.”\n“Is that so?”\nAs a beginner, Ha-ri wasn’t allowed to run, but he seemed to get the hang of it quickly.\nWhile he was picking out the cadets’ horses Chief Kim Jin-soo, who had received a phone call approached Leon.\n“Your Majesty.”\n“What is it?”\n“It’s an urgent call from the chairman of the Association, and he wants me to tell you that he’d appreciate it if you could take it.”\n“Of course.”\nWith Leon’s permission, Kim Jin-soo switched his phone to speakerphone mode and let Oh Kang-hyuk’s voice come through.\n“Peace be with you, Your Majesty. It’s Oh Kang-hyuk.”\n“What’s going on?”\nOh Kang-hyuk told Leon what he wanted to do, using a beautiful, formal, mass-like language. The short, simple sentences were not a matter of etiquette, but of hearing.\nThe conclusion of this was──\n[Please help me capture the Jeju Island Gate, it’s a big deal if the dungeon breaks]\nIt’s already been five days since the combined Firebird Guild and Golden Lion Guild raid entered the gate so the deadline for the Dungeon Break was approaching.\nAccording to one of the raiders who managed to escape, there was a ridiculously strong boss.\n“This king will be obliged to help you with it. This king is not a janitor to clean up after you.”\n[I’m only being rude, of course, because I think it might be of interest to your majesty. I have news from a survivor of that gate]\n“A survivor?”\n[Yes. We’re assuming it has something to do with Your Majesty]\nOh Kang-hyuk paused for a moment before relaying the survivor’s testimony.\n[The Field Boss of the Gate claims to be a Knight of the Goddess of Life and Abundance.]\nA knight of the gods, in that case…\n[We don’t know if it’s real or fake, but we thought it was worthy of Your Majesty’s attention.]",

      "content": "Chapter 59: I will not tolerate such atrocities!\nIt was a week ago that the Jeju Island Gate was opened, and it was Guild Leader Lee Yong-wan of “Firebird” who won the bid for the gate.\nYong-wan enlisted the Golden Lion Guild’s Golden Chul to clear the red gate, and the combined Firebird and Golden Lion raid team set out to attack the red gate.\nThere’s one rule of thumb when trying to capture a Red Gate: if you can’t capture it, you must call for backup.\nIf the raiders called for help the Association has the right to forcefully mobilize “Hunters” to the Red Gate when a dungeon break is imminent.\nThis is almost the only enforcement power the Association has, because a Red Gate dungeon break could destroy a city but even this was not accepted by the large domestic guilds, so it came with the condition that the ‘failed capture’ must be a predetermined fact.\nThis is why the Association sent Kim Jin-soo and Ha-ri to the Black Gate as scapegoats for the de facto failure of the capture.\n“So you want this king to act?”\nLeon’s eyes flashed with displeasure, and Chief Kim Jin-soo replied cautiously, sweating profusely.\n“Of course not, the Association wants to maintain amicable relations with Your Majesty. In the first place, we’re not even at the stage where we can issue a mobilization decree yet.”\nAn emergency mobilization decree would require the guilds that raided the gate to declare failure. The problem is that there is a Hunter who escaped, but it is ambiguous whether the raid is a failure or not.\n“I need to see him first. Where is he?”\n“He’s being treated at the hospital. I hear he’s pretty much unrecognizable right now…….”\n“It doesn’t matter. Let’s go.”\nLeon headed straight for the Jeju hospital where the surviving Hunter had been taken and the Association staff, who had been radioed in advance of Leon’s visit, bowed ninety degrees at the sight of him.\n“This way, Your Majesty.”\nThe wounded from the Firebird Guild and the Golden Lion Guild were crowded into a four-person room. None of them were in very good condition, but none of them were seriously wounded.\n“So this is the hospital.”\nFollowing Leon to the hospital, Beatrice marveled at Earth’s modern hospital facilities.\nThey’re kept clean to prevent infection, and staffed by countless nurses and doctors.\nIt’s quite a sensation, she thinks, why couldn’t they have thought of something like this in her kingdom… no, it would be impossible….\n“Well, it’s not barbaric.”\n“This facility?”\n“Yes. It’s meant to treat soldiers wounded in battle, but how can commoners be treated here?”\nHe didn’t mean it in a classist way, as if commoners didn’t deserve to be treated.\nIn the Lionheart Kingdom, as well as in most countries, commoners eat the blessed crops and never get sick.\nThey live long lives and are healed at every meal. They also have no germs in their mouths, so the concept of dentistry is foreign to them.\nWhen commoners did receive healing, it was usually for accidental trauma, and since there was no god of medicine, the priests of life and fertility took over.\nWhy do you need a doctor, why do you need hospitalization, when you can just come to the temple, say a few prayers, eat a good meal cooked by the priests, and go home.\nSuch things were reserved for soldiers and knights who needed urgent treatment like reattaching a severed arm, or to repair a wounded intestine.\nThat’s for the Priests of Life and Fertility on the battlefield.\n“……Your Majesty’s world is such an anomaly that it can’t even be put on a scale.”\n“I am aware of that, hence the burden of representing all the gods.”\n“Hoohoo…….”\nThe Queen didn’t bother to tackle the arrogant entitled god-king, for she herself was now the High Priestess of Dreams and Death.\n“Many of you are impolite.”\n“That’s because they’re sedated. If you’ll give me a moment, I’ll…….”\n“That won’t be necessary.”\nLeon approached the queen.\n“Is it my turn?”\n“Please.”\nBeatrice raised her powers. She was the High Priestess of Fle, the Goddess of Dreams and Death and though she was an inexperienced and novice High Priestess, she was not incapable of intervening in a single dream.\n“This shouldn’t be difficult. I’ll create a new space in his dreams.”\nAs a gifted dreamer, she has maintained a repeating world in the midst of demons, so what she is doing now is more familiar than she realizes.\n“Whoa…….”\nHow ironic that the memories and experiences of horrific repetition are so helpful only after being freed from them.\nBeatrice entered the dream of the unrecognizable Hunter, where she could see into his consciousness.\n[……]\nSoon enough, Beatrice emerged from the dream and told him what she had seen in his consciousness.\n“It was a knight in green armor, carrying a huge one-handed hammer and shield, and claiming to be protected by the Goddess of Life and Fertility.”\n“Hmm…Demera?”\nMaybe not. There’s no guarantee that other worlds don’t have goddesses of life and fertility.\n“Do you know the knight’s name?”\n“Georgic. Apparently he’s called the Majestic Georgic and…the Protector of Gerhane. He’s a monstrous knight…….”\n“……!”\nAt that, Leon’s eyes widened.\n“Your Majesty?”\n“We shall depart at once. This king will lead the way.”\nLeon’s willingness to leave immediately brightened the complexion of Kim Jin-soo and the rest of the Association staff.\nWith four S-rank Hunters and most of the raiders out of contact, sending someone in such a situation would require at least comparable power.\nOther large guilds in Korea would naturally be stretched, and the power they would send would be questionable but if it was Leon…….\n‘He doesn’t operate on profit and loss.’\nMoreover, his strength it’s probably on par with world-class monsters, or better.\n“Do you want me to call in the troops in the building? I can arrange a charter flight right now.”\nLeon was in Jeju just in time to purchase horses for the knight cadets.\nIt was unusual for a gate hunter to buy a horse, and he didn’t need to bring soldiers with him.\nSince troops would be needed to attack the gate, Kim Jin-soo could use the Association’s private plane to bring them over.\n“No, I’m not bringing soldiers to the gate this time.”\n“Why…?”\nIn response to Kim Jin-soo’s question, Beatrice, who had witnessed the Hunter’s dream, spoke up with a guess.\n“Because there’s no point in using mediocre people, right?”\n“Exactly. At the very least they need to be a knight that wouldn’t get killed in the fight.”\n“That would be me, Ms. Ha-ri, and the three of them. It was a mistake not to bring Lord Yappy.”\nAt the very least, Koo Dae-sung, Kim Do-han, and a bunch of B-rank cadets of mediocre skill are not enough.\n“The sooner we go, the better. We’d rather be quick than wait for Lord Spinner.”\nVaguely aware of the gravity of the situation, she headed for the gate with Leon.\n* * * *\n“…….”\n“What the hell…….”\nWhat she saw as soon as she entered the gate was a horrific devastation and not even a blade of grass was left standing on the scorched earth.\nAfter witnessing the ruthless slaughter and destruction, Ha-ri gritted her teeth.\n“You, this is too much…….”\nPeople are being skinned and hanged.\n“Uweh!”\nSoo-ho vomited in disgust, and Jae-hyuk patted him on the back.\n“…….”\nChun So-yeon had seen everything under the sun as she cleared gates, but she had never seen such a gruesome execution site before.\nLeon and Beatrice scanned their surroundings coldly, though they didn’t frown.\n“It’s been a while since I’ve seen an execution. Do you think these are Hunters?”\n“Probably not. They’re too short for that. Koreans are generally tall.”\nThey also found signs of recent human occupation and several footprints that crossed the charred field.\n“They’ve practiced the Blue Night tactic and killed every last one of them, so that not a single seed is left in this land.”\n“You know that well?”\n“When I killed the orcs, I did something similar to their few green spots.”\nLeon left the executed victims behind and mounted his horse.\n“It’s been a long time since the work here was done. We’re going to trace the tracks and find out what’s going on.”\nLeon leads the way, followed by the Queen and the cadets.\nThough they were still used to it, traveling on horseback was much faster than walking.\n“Your Majesty.”\nBeatrice asked as they rode.\n“You may speak.”\n“You seem to be in a bit of a hurry and didn’t even wait for Lord Yappy. Do you suspect something?”\n“Hmm…this king was inconsiderate.”\nAs they rode away on horseback Leon began to talk.\n“As I said before, mediocre people are in danger, because there is a Holy Knight here.”\n“A Holy Knight…you mean Sir Georgic?”\nBeatrice remembered the green-armored knight she had witnessed in the Hunter’s dream.\nMajestic Georgic, is a knight of the gods and one of the strongest Holy Knights.\n“He is a Holy Knight favored by Demera, the Goddess of Life and Fertility. Sir Georgic was a Holy Knight three generations before this king and his skills were passed down through this king’s family.”\nLeon doesn’t know much about him either since Holy knights are naturally long-lived.\nWhen they talk about a generation, they’re usually talking about at least 200 years.\n“Sir Georgic was born eight hundred years ago, five hundred years before this king was born, and he ascended while on a campaign against the barbarians.”\n“Ascended?”\n“That means he died, sister?”\nLeon did not deny their conjecture since by nature great saints don’t describe their deaths as death.\nTheir deaths are ascensions to paradise and they’re led by the gods themselves.\n“But Sir Georgic did not make it to Paradise.”\n“His……soul did not arrive.”\n“I traced his aura through the holy relics, but I could not find him or his troops anywhere.”\nBeatrice had seen Leon personally escort his fallen trainees to Paradise so she knew that, at least in Leon’s world, there was an afterlife, and that it was populated by souls favored by the gods.\nIf a Holy Knight was the most favored saint of his time, how could his soul not reach Paradise?\n“I have three guesses. First, Sir Georgic is actually alive.”\nThat’s entirely possible since Holy Knights are not inherently mortal.\nThey ascend when they fall on the battlefield, or when they lay down their posts to be embraced by the gods.\n“Second, his soul was lost in the middle. And finally──”\n“Defection…….”\nThe Holy Knight, Georgic, favored by the goddesses, was actually a traitor.\n“We may be able to find out the truth by attacking this gate, but it involves a powerful Holy Knight. If there is a battle, it will not be a human one.”\nTherefore, only those humans who can survive the aftermath of the battle have been selected. Leon was not yet at the point where he could afford to use up his troops.\nAs they retraced their steps, the cadets’ faces grew darker.\n“Again…….”\n“‘They made a show of it.”\nThe corpses on the execution platforms were horribly mangled.\nBodies burned to death, villages trampled and ravaged, people slaughtered without resistance.\nLeon stares at their flayed skin in particular and growls.\n“This is unspeakable, this atrocity. These people deserve to die.”\nHa-ri nods in agreement with Leon’s words.\n‘I see the king is outraged by this tragedy as well.’\nLeon may be discriminatory and authoritarian, but at his core, he is a just man and despite their cultural differences, Ha-ri deemed him just enough to follow.\n“Han Ha-ri, and the rest of the cadets, listen.”\nThe cadets were tired of the carnage, but they focused on Leon’s clear words, knowing he would lead them out of this hellish place.\n“Whatever happens from now on, you will only follow this king. Do not trust your eyes or your minds. Do you understand?”\n“Ah, I understand.”\n“I will only follow the King’s path!”\nThe cadets gave him a puzzled look, but Leon didn’t say anything more and continued ahead.\nHow far up did he go?\n-Gah!\n-Help!\nAnother tragedy loomed.\n“Your Majesty, it’s a village, people are being slaughtered!”\nKnights and soldiers on horseback were killing naked people indiscriminately. Men and women, young and old, slaughtered those who resisted, and mercilessly beat those they captured.\n-Die! I’ll kill you!\n-Kahahahaha, die, you lowly things!\nIt was a massacre in the making, a scene of one-sided slaughter and Leon was furious as he watched the horrific carnage, as those who resisted were torn limb from limb in even more horrific fashion.\n“You, you scum of the earth…!”\n“Your Majesty!”\nHa-ri was thrilled to see Leon genuinely outraged; this man’s sense of justice could be trusted!\n“Our allies are in danger! We’re charging!”\n“I will follow you!”\nHa-ri clumsily grabbed the reins of her horse and the other cadets did the same.\nThey had no doubt that this was their moment to save their people from being mercilessly slaughtered and to bring justice.\nWith the help of the Lionhearted King, they would do justice.\n-Thud, thud, thud!\nHorses’ hooves pounded the earth and with his lance summoned, the Lionheart King galloped away at full speed, so fast that no one could keep up.\n“He’s too fast, I can’t keep up!”\n“That’s how angry he was, when he met the ‘orcs’!”\nThe cadets excitedly tried to catch up but just then, Soo-ho shook his head and said.\n“……Uh, isn’t the direction a little strange?”\n“Huh?”\nHearing Soo-ho’s question, Ha-ri looked straight in Leon’s direction.\nThe direction in which Leon was furiously charging was towards…the residents facing the massacre.\n“Glory to Lionheart…!!!!”\nIn the moment of impact three people were impaled on the lance like skewers.\nYour Majesty?",

      "content": "Chapter 60: Holy Knight Georgic (1)\n“Kuchek?!”\nLeon’s spear pierced the man’s heart, his back and then the chest of the woman behind him.\nFinally, after three people had been pierced, the victims screamed as they were skewered by the lance.\n“What a noisy bunch of scum.”\nThe lance that had impaled the three men is raised high and swung then the bodies fall to the ground, dripping from the spear’s tip.\nLeon’s spear tip is wet with blood as he looks for his next kill.\n“Let’s go, Stallion!”\nIt was a scene of slaughter and carnage, a battle that was not even a battle.\n“What?”\n“Is he crazy?!”\n“…….”\nSoo-ho, Jae-hyuk, and So-yeon were stunned by Leon’s rampage.\nThey wondered if the charge was misdirected but as the slaughter continues they realize that he is sane.\n‘He’s really on the side of the soldiers!’\nThe ignorant hatred of the orcs is one thing, but they didn’t think he would do this to a fellow human.\n”This, this is not right.”\nHa-ri stepped forward. She wasn’t willing to go into the center of that storm on horseback, but she had to get down and stop this atrocity!\n“Miss Ha-ri.”\nAt that moment, a dark aura blocked Ha-ri’s path as the Magician Queen’s magic restrained her.\n“Wait.”\n“Queen…….”\nHa-ri stares reproachfully at the queen who stops her, but the queen understands her and smiles.\n“Believe in him, His Majesty always has a reason for what He does.”\n“Is there?”\nHa-ri looked in Leon’s direction.\n-Die, you scum!\n-Hahaha! Five! That’s a new record!\n-I won’t spare a single one of you! Die in wailing and screaming!\nLeon impales them with spears, stomps them to death and splits their heads open with his sword.\n“Isn’t it just disgust?”\n“No, it’s……a little bit of excitement.”\nThe cadets, including Soo-ho, are freaking out, not to mention Ha-ri, who’s gotten used to it.\n-Shouldn’t we… run away now?\n-Oh, I agree.\nThe cadets’ reluctance to act upon the horrific scene is not due to a lack of a sense of justice.\nFirst, they realize that even if they did, they would be powerless to stop the carnage.\nSecond, Leon must be a reason.\nAnd finally, because the beings at the Gate are fake.\nWith the exception of survivors, which are few and far between, the monsters and NPCs in the Gate are merely memories of past events.\nUnlike the “real Otherworld” where survivors exist, they can only collect magic stones and drops here.\nThis is evidenced by the fact that all attempts to bring the NPCs and monsters inside the Gate back to Earth have failed.\nThey are, after all, fakes. Whether a fake is slaughtered or displayed on an execution platform, it is frowned upon, but not considered a “sin”.\nEventually, after the massacre, which included the burning of an entire village, a knight and his soldiers approached Leon and his companions.\n“Ugh….”\nHa-ri and the cadets looked at the blood-soaked soldiers and prepared to draw their swords.\nThese were the men who had slaughtered the villagers so brutally.\n“…….”\nA knight in a refined helmet approached, removed it, dismounted and suddenly fell to his knees.\n“Greetings, Holy Knight, the living saint!”\n“”Greetings, Holy Knight, the living saint!!””\nThe knights and soldiers knelt in unison as if in adoration, waiting for Leon to speak.\n“Stand up. We are still on the battlefield.”\nThe knights and soldiers looked up only after he gave them permission and one of the knights stepped forward.\n“I am Toscana Vendellic, brother of Lord Vendellic, Knight of the Lavonian Order of the Dawn, Saint of the Radiance of God.”\n“If it’s Lord Vendellic estate, is it a trading city close to Langquell. Is your brother the lord?”\n“Unfortunately, I am the only one of my brothers who has been recognized for his knightly talents.”\nKnights often don’t serve as lords since it’s the role of the lord to manage and govern the territory.\nUsually, those who follow the path of knighthood…especially if they intend to follow a rigorous path of training…cannot afford to rule a territory.\n“Have you finished your training yet?”\n“Yes. This was supposed to be my last campaign.”\nLeon couldn’t recall a knight named Toscana Vendellic in his memory.\nAt the very least, if he had become a Holy Knight, he would have met him in the Paradise of the Gods. That meant he either failed or died in this crusade.\n“The other knights, name yourselves.”\n“Yes, I am Tejare, Kingdom Knight of the Viscounty of Kitan!”\n“I am Zoltan Bormun, Kingdom Knight!”\n“I am Benienne Barboza, Knight Errant!”\n“I am Ayla Stannion, Knight Errant!”\nLeon checked each name in his memory but he didn’t recognize any of them. Too bad these honorable knights hadn’t made history.\n“This king is Leon Dragonia Lionheart, the rightful Grand Duke of the Grand Duchy of Dragonia, and heir to the Lionheart of Arianna, Goddess of Light and Justice.”\n“”……!!!””\nThe knights and soldiers gasped in horror at the words, but Ha-ri and the cadets could see why.\nThe era of this gate is a distant past in Leon’s world. He is the future Lionheart King so no one would believe him if he claimed to be a king in this age.\n“……Should we judge him as a peasant who had a brilliant rise?”\n“What other knight in the world would call himself the Lionheart King?”\nA faint distrust spreads among them but the knights hesitate at the contradictory nature of this moment, and the intensity of Leon’s radiance.\n“Trust me. It’s complicated to explain, but this king is indeed the Lionheart King.”\n“……I believe you.”\n‘You believe this?!’\nThe cadets’ expressions were filled with astonishment at Leon making such an outrageous claim, and the knights believing it so readily.\nEven the soldiers seem to think that if it’s so, it must be so.\n‘They doubt it, but they believe in something more absolute than their own judgment.’\nChen So-yeon sensed the ‘fanaticism’ in them. What is it that they believe in that makes them disregard hard facts, logical reasoning, and unsubstantiated claims…all rational reasoning?\n“Knights, as I understand it, you are an army that has come to exterminate the barbarians. Is that correct?”\n“Yes…! It is!”\n“And is it correct that the leader of the army is Sir Georgic, the Holy Knight of Life and Fertility?”\n“Yes!”\n“I must meet him at once. Where is Sir Georgic?”\nLeon knew they were ‘bounty hunters’. While the main body of the army faces the largest hostile force, a handful of auxiliary battalions pick off the smaller clumps around them.\nDespite being knights, they wore light armor rather than heavy armor, as they were meant to be speed fighters.\nConsidering the reason for the ‘skinning’, what’s going on here is probably──\n“Lord Georgic is currently facing the main army of barbarians.”\n“Soon he will be slaughtering the filthy barbarians.”\nLeon had a hunch that the Holy Knight, who had not ascended to the Paradise of the Gods, had suffered a change of heart in this war.\n* * * *\nIn recent days, the Firebird Guild and the Golden Lion Guild have used everything they could think of to help the Clan Alliance.\nThey dug, carved, and built traps, waiting for the moment of truth.\n“The log trap is complete, please set it up!”\n“Thank you, warriors, we’ll take it.”\nPeople from a peaceful tribe fight to defend their home against an invasion by an evil kingdom.\n“Warriors, please have a cup of tea.”\n“Uh, uh… thank you, sir.”\nHwang Yeon-ha nodded awkwardly as she joined them. She put down the woodwork she had been working on and took the tea from the tribal woman.\n“Sister, are you joking?”\n“Fuck you.”\nHa-yeon throws up his middle finger and glares at her sarcastically. They look like normal siblings.\n“What’s going on? We’ve done enough preparation.”\n“Well, the enemy’s big boss arrived.”\nAt that moment, Hwang Yeon-ha realized that the density of the air had changed and beyond the wooden fence was the green knight.\nHe was nearly two meters tall with impeccably polished armor, a massive one-handed hammer and a shield.\nHis breath weighs the space down and his massive presence crushes all the humans in the area.\n“…He’s finally here.”\nYong-wan and Ha Yuri are already waiting at the door. The two of them, as well as all the Hunters from the Firebird Guild and the Golden Lion Guild, are tense.\nNo wonder. Even S-class Hunters can’t stand a chance against a superhuman like that.\nOn top of all that, there was only one Georgic back then, and now he has an army following him.\n“That’s a lot.”\nThey were roughly two hundred Kingdom Knights and six hundred wandering knights, seeking honor on the road.\nThe hunters who have fought them in sporadic guerrilla battles have been appalled.\nWandering Knights are upper B-rank and lower A-rank at best while Kingdom Knights are upper A-rank.\nOf course, the difference between an S-rank Hunter and an A-rank Hunter is huge but the problem is that there are a whopping eight hundred knights who can reach A-rank at full strength. That’s more than all the A-rank Hunters in South Korea.\nThat’s not all, Georgic is a monster that even S-rank hunters can’t match. In Golden Chul estimation, not even the Yakt Spinner of the Cheongju Gate could match it.\n“Is this really a Red Gate? Isn’t the difficulty level like a Black Gate?”\nThere had only been three Black Gates in the 30 years since the Gates and each one a crisis for humanity. No, this is the fourth time.\nThey’ve never tackled a Black Gate so they don’t have anything to compare it to…….\n“But it’s worth a shot.”\nYes. Nevertheless, there was a reason why the Alliance raiding party didn’t give up on capturing it.\n“Warriors. The warriors are ready for battle.”\nHildir, the approaching shaman, looked tired, having imprinted all the ‘Hunters’ with her spells these days.\n“What are our numbers?”\n“Two hundred high ranking warriors, three thousand intermediate, twenty thousand lesser warriors and fifty thousand old and infirm men who have decided to fight.”\nThat was good news, considering that Georgic and his legions totaled less than seven thousand men. At least they were outnumbered seven to one.\nIt was not surprising, since all the tribes in the neighborhood had joined forces after the knights’ rampage.\nPlus a combined raiding party of 50 A-ranks and 100 B-ranks.\nThe first battle with the Georgic left more than 30 men seriously wounded or captured, but the main force remained intact. Best of all──\n[Mazer’s tusk imprint]\n-Increases defense penetration by 35%.\n-Increases strength and endurance by 20%.\n[Bai Liang’s claw imprint]\n-Grants the talent Movement.\n-Increases Agility by 15%.\n[Iron King’s Pelt Imprint]\n-Grants the talent Strength.\n-Grants Hard Skin.\n[Black Eagle Talon imprint]\n-Reduces Defense by 30%.\n-Grants the Air Resistance talent.\nThe ‘beast gods’ worshiped by the local shamans and tribes had powerful imprints that can be obtained by serving these deities.\nThe immense power of these imprints increased the combat power of the raiding party.\n“Warriors. Save us.”\n“Of course, Miss Hildir. We, the Firebird Guild, will not leave you behind.”\nAs Yong-wan replied in kind, Huang Yeon-ha poked Ha Yuri in the side.\n‘What’s going on? He doesn’t seem like such a nice guy.’\n‘They had sex.’\n‘Oh……..’\nIt’s a fairly common occurrence for Hunters to make out with NPCs in gates so they didn’t have to worry about it.\nThere are many things that would have been felonies on Earth, so Yong-wan is a good man.\n“Ugh! He’s moving!”\nAt that moment, all eyes turned to the outside of the woodwork. Georgic rode his green-armored Pegasus and flew through the air in a flash.\n“Shit, shit…that thing.”\n“Do you think we can intercept it?”\n“We’ll have to aim for the moment it comes down.”\nIt wasn’t as if they were unaware of the Pegasus presence, so the raiders had prepared for it but Georgic had no intention of coming down, and he spoke to them from the sky.\n“Surviving mercenaries.”\nHis voice was ringing and had a high-pitched echo, as if he was shouting in their ears.\n“I let you live because I saw your ignorance, but what are you doing here?”\n“We’re getting ready to take you down.”\nGate-closing condition: Defeat ‘The Majestic Georgic’.\nThe Raiders planned to defeat him and make a run for it, while grabbing a bunch of Spirit Stones before the gate disappeared.\nIt’s a shame that this gate is so littered with them, probably from the slaughtered tribesmen.\nHowever, the quality of these stones decreases depending on the power of the NPC’s so the raiders coveted the items and gems that the monstrous Holy Knight would drop.\n“You’re ignorant and deluded so I will give you one chance. Give up all your weapons and leave this place. You are not guilty of any great sin.”\n“Hah… Mentioning sins is your business, aren’t you ashamed?”\nYong-wan’s retort was valid and everyone from Earth thought so.\nThey flayed people alive, executed them, slaughtered them mercilessly, and spared not even the old and the young.\nFor these brutal murderers to even mention sins was nonsense.\n“I have no shame to look up to the heavens and no shame to look down to the earth! For my deeds are only justice!”\nNo one is guilty of this brutal slaughter.\nHe sentenced them to death as casually as if they had done something as natural as exterminating an insect.\n“How dare you try to save those worms in front of me, in front of this Georgic! You have crossed the line!”\nGeorgic’s words of doom overwhelm everyone with their resonance and ferocity.\n“Warriors…….”\nHildir grabbed Yong-wan’s hand in fear.\n“I am the glorious Holy Knight of Lionheart, Georgic, and I will inflict ‘Divine Punishment’ on you!”\nIn the next moment a giant green energy is sucked into Georgic’s hammer, and Yong-wan, realizing that it’s the same attack from earlier, shouts urgently.\n“Activate the Defensive Skills! It’s not something he can use often! If we block it once…!”\nHe was prepared and no resources were spared but──\n“”We, the Knights of the Realm who follow the honorable Holy Knight, will gladly lend our strength to destroy evil!””\nThe Knights of the Realm extended their swords and spears but who would have thought that such a seemingly unified and meaningless act would have such a terrible ‘resonance’.\n“Huh?”\n“What?”\nTwo hundred Knights of the Realm who swore to defend the kingdom and entrusted their fate to the gods focused the power of their unwavering faith on a single Holy Knight.\nGeorgic declares from above.\n“Kneel before the glory of the true gods.”\nThe holy power in the sky spread in all directions and in the next moment──the ground collapsed.",

      "content": "Chapter 61: Holy Knight Georgic (2)\nThe goddess of light and justice who presides over all knights and teaches them justice, and whose power is granted to knights who are elevated to sainthood.\nHoly Knights are agents of the gods. As saints, they weave the holy power offered by the faithful into their own power.\nEach Holy Knight’s power varies depending on their deity, but the Holy Knights of Life and Fertility have earth-shattering powers.\n“Ugh…what the hell is going on……this is nonsense.”\nYong-wan couldn’t believe what he was seeing.\nGeorgic’s Divine Punishment Earthshatter had wiped out the area where the Tribal Alliance and the Hunters were.\nEight hundred meters in all directions, near the wooden fence where the main army was gathered a giant sinkhole appeared.\nThe good news was that the area around it wasn’t defended by Hunters. Most of it is held by warriors from the Tribal Alliance. But he just wiped out over three thousand of them.\n“What the fuck… What the fuck… How is that, how is that a person…….”\nBacked by the other Knights, the Holy Knights are a one-man army in their own right. They are monsters, no different from archmages.\nHunters panic at the prospect of a cataclysm unlike any they’ve ever faced.\nWhat could they do against such a monster?\n“Is that a human…….?”\n“We can’t beat that…….”\nThe Holy Knight speaks from above the Pegasus and his tired voice echoed clearly all around.\n“Goddess, protect us from the lands we touch.”\n“Be firm ground for my brothers and sisters to tread.”\n“A chance of purification for misguided souls.”\nIt was a humane and holy prayer but no one saw it as “merciful”.\nThere was a sneer that threatened to burst at any moment, tugging at the corners of his twisted mouth.\n“Die, disgusting heretics.”\n-Uh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh……!!!\n-Follow the Majestic Georgic!!!\nThe knights charge towards the defenses that have been completely destroyed.\n“”──Go!!!””\nThe wooden gate was anointed with oil, boulders placed behind it, and covered in spells.\nThe first person to charge through is, of course, Georgic. His hammer glowed as he rode over the ground on his Pegasus, and his hammer flew through the air.\nHe throws it as hard as he can, and it smashes right into the gate.\nWith a boom of destruction, it flew through the woodwork and the knights rushed through the opening.\n“Stop them!”\nThe leading tanks and the tribal warriors with shields blocked the way.\nGiven their opponent’s cavalry strength, they loaded up on spears and built a barricade to hold them off. But in the moment of contact──spears shattered against armor, and shields ricocheted off shieldmen with a heavy mass.\n-No, no!\n-We had the upper hand in terms of armor, not to mention the effectiveness of the imprint!\nCavalry is weak against spearmen so in front of a dense mass of shields and spears, even the best cavalry would fall apart.\nThat’s conventional wisdom but these are knights.\nKnights are not lightly armed, their heavy armor is impenetrable to cheap infantry spears, and the steeds of the Lionheart Kingdom are unafraid of spears.\nAnd then there are the knights, handpicked and chosen, who are honored to be called Knights of the Realm and commanded by the Warknights.\n“Kraaaaaaaaaaah!!!”\nThe formation was breached as a mere two hundred knights were sweeping across the battlefield, on a battlefield of tens of thousands of units, the likes of which none of the Hunters had ever seen.\n“Shit! Don’t push, I’m falling!”\n“Sa, help me!”\nThe Allied Tribe warriors, whose flanks had been torn open by Georgic’s Divine Punishment Earthshatter, fell into the sinkhole under the force of the Knights’ impact.\nYong-wan did not stand idly by as he tore up his treasured scroll and concentrated his firepower.\nHowever, most of his high firepower comes from his ranged weapons but the Kingdom Knights, who were protected by the Holy Law <Ranged Nullification>, shrugged it off and swung their spears.\n“Stop the main dealers, hit them from the side!”\nThe veteran Hunters take matters into their own hands, stabbing at the Knights’ weak points.\nIt’s a great breakthrough, but there are only 50 A-rank Hunters here so they cleverly pounded the Knights flanks while the warriors of the Tribal Alliance acted as meat shields.\n“Not bad!”\nKingdom Knight Gaston swung his axe at Yong-wan, and he blocked it with his shield.\nIt was heavy and his strength was no match for theirs.\n“I can’t believe a mere mercenary is this strong. It must be the imprint of the barbarians.”\n“A leisurely assessment on the battlefield, Lord Gaston!”\nSir Laurent said, deflecting a javelin flying toward him from the side. He looked humiliated that his charge had been thwarted by the momentum of the Hunters.\n“No, I merely marvel at how lowly scum can become so strong through the barbarians power. Indeed, it’s understandable that one would be deceived by such power.”\n“Blasphemy, Lord Gaston. Recognize that your words may be blasphemous.”\n“Hahahahaha! Sir Laurent is still serious. Doesn’t it remind you of thirty years ago, when we were slaughtering orcs in the Black Desert?”\n“Well, no. We always kill those beasts, don’t we?”\n“I suppose we should fight them the way we fight orcs now, huh?”\nViscount Gaston Valshvar, Kingdom Knight <Orc Slayer> said.\n“I will… hammer them!”\nAnd Baron Laurent Dominek, Kingdom Knight <Iron Barrier> agreed.\nThe flanking knights dismount and their heavy armor rattles as they hit the ground, as if a small earthquake had occurred.\n“Light and justice──”\n“Life and abundance──”\n“War and flame──”\nThey raised their swords and shields, chanting the name of the God they serve.\n“”Glory be to God in the highest.””\nA knight’s destructive power is undoubtedly most potent when mounted and their overwhelming speed, mass, and combined impact can shatter armor.\nBut knights are not just riders on horses. If being good on horseback is what makes a knight a knight, then commoners are just as capable of filling that role.\n‘What?’\nRank A Hunter Park Chan-soo, who was attacking the five isolated knights with a hundred mid-level warriors, was puzzled.\nThey were swallowed up by a wave of numbers and surrounded, their horses were blocked from breaking through, and they were even dismounted.\nEven the strongest armor and the sturdiest shields are no match for this kind of mass warfare and an elite force of unequal specs is bound to crumble and be swallowed up but there was something they had overlooked.\nThe Kingdom Knights may not have walked the honorable path of carrying out the quests of the gods as Quest knights, they have traveled across the continent to prove themselves.\nIn other words, they’ve been wielding swords for decades and by the time they reach the age of knighthood, they’ve been wielding swords for a hundred years.\nThey’ve slaughtered dirty green beasts, ugly sorcerers, and fended off invaders.\n“War! Protect me with your holy flame!”\nHe swings his sword and the flames roar. It was never meant to be wielded in the midst of allies, but the flames consumed dozens of tribal warriors.\n“Madman, you’re bringing your allies into this!”\nThe hunter shouted, stunned by what seemed like self-destruction but then he realized that none of the knights had been burned by the flames.\n“Do you think this God-given fire will harm my brothers of the same faith, foolish mercenaries?”\nEncouraged by the overwhelming performance of the kingdom knights, the flanking knights and kingdom troops rushed forward.\nWith the narrow gates pushed back by Georgic and the Knights, the Kingdom soldiers are able to get within striking distance. And when the battle turns to hand-to-hand combat, it becomes a one-sided slaughter.\n-No, damn it! The knights are too strong!\n-Someone do something about that!\n-I can’t believe the soldiers are this good! The coordination is off the charts!\n“…….”\nYong-Wan gritted his teeth as he watched.\nThe Kingdom knights were unimaginably strong. Not just in terms of strength and special powers, but also in terms of experience, slaughtering the tribal warriors like a machine.\n‘It’s not enough to just match their specs.’\nThere’s a huge gap between them and themselves and Golden Chul who walked up to him felt the same way.\n“What can we do, the kingdom’s soldiers have already arrived and we’re getting crushed in a head-to-head battle.”\n“I know, junior.”\n“The only way out is now.”\n“What? That’s bullshit!”\nHwang Yeon-ha shouted from the side, and Golden Chul shrugged.\n“We haven’t sent in our main force yet. We were planning on using the tribal warriors as meat shields from the start, so we can slowly mow down the Field Boss.”\n“We did.”\n“But we can’t even take out the Knights, let alone the Field Boss. We can’t do this alone.”\nThey had to give up the gate, change their strategy and rely on the other top 10 guilds.\n“If we rely on the help of the other top 10 guilds… it won’t be impossible to capture it, but it will cause a dungeon break, won’t it?”\n“Actually… I think there’s a smoother way to end it than you think.”\n“What do you mean?”\nGolden Chul men had retreated one after another, wounded from fighting the Knights, and luckily the names of the gods they served had reached his ears.\n“Arianna, goddess of light and justice, and Petos, god of war and flame. Where have we heard of them before?”\n“I don’t know, I’m not really into religion. How could I know the religion of the Gate in the first place──”\n“Haven’t you watched the Ten Thousand Gods Guild YouTube?”\n“!!!”\nYong-wan’s pupils dilated at that.\n“What?”\n“That king seems to be from the same kingdom as this gate.”\nWell, that’s a different story. They know about the Kingdom of Lionheart and the Lionheart King Leon.\nWhat if that king is from the same place as these knights?\n“……It’s worth retreating.”\n“Well, they’ll break through anyway. We can’t hope to outnumber them by seven to one.”\nIt makes perfect sense. If they retreat, this tribal alliance will surely collapse, but Yong-wan has no intention of throwing his life away for NPCs.\n“Warrior… are you leaving?”\nEven if there is an NPC with mixed emotions.\n“Miss Hildir.”\n“If you leave…what are we to do? Do you really intend to abandon us?”\n“I’ll bring you reinforcements soon, but for now, we’ll have to leave.”\nWith those words, Yong-wan did not continue to persuade Hildir since there was nothing more pointless than arguing with NPCs.\n“Tell the guild that we’re retreating! Hurry out of the gate!”\n“So in the end, you didn’t defeat those monsters after all.”\n“Miss Hildir?”\nYong-wan felt a chill run up his spine.\nThe lovely beauty who, until this morning, had whispered her love into his bunk, now smiled a grotesquely eerie smile.\n“You disgusting people, never finish your tasks.”\nHer gaze was still on the leader that slaughtered the warriors, the green knight and the knights and soldiers following him.\n“What are you talking about──”\nYong-wan started, but Hildir cut him off with a wave of her hand.\n“Forget it, I’m going to cheat this time, even though he won’t like it.”\nAll she did was snap her fingers.\n-Guck?\n-That?\nIt started with a dead body.\nThe imprinted skin swelled, the muscles expanded, and the skeleton groaned and twisted.\nWhen it finally took on the form of a beast rather than a man, the Knight’s eyes lit up.\n“They’re using magic!”\n“Beastification!”\nThe barbarians who worship beast gods are blessed by the imprint of a beast on their bodies and end up with the power of beastification.\n-Goooooooooo!!!\nBoars, bears, wolves, eagles, there were thousands of these monsters, their human bodies distorted and twisted into beastly forms.\nThe tribesmen cheer at the horrific sight.\n“The Great Beast God has favored us!”\n“We, too, shall soon receive his favor!”\nIt’s not just the warriors of the Tribal Alliance who have become beasts. All who bear the beast imprint, young and old, are corrupted, even the Hunters.\n“K, k, k…! What the hell did you do…!”\nYong-wan protested, scratching at the black eagle imprint on his neck with his nails. Instinctively, he realized that it was corrupting him.\nAt his futile struggle, Hildir twisted the corners of her mouth in mockery.\n“Oh, my love. It’s no use trying to resist. The imprint may not last long, but it’s only a matter of time.”\nYong-wan was not alone, Ha Yuri, Golden Chul, Huang Yeon-ha… and all the other Hunters in the Alliance’s raiding party were imprinted, unable to stop themselves from losing their senses.\nWhen they finally reached the point of no return, Hildir smirked and clapped her hands.\n“Now, then, kill the damned Holy Knight and his knights. We’ll have to start all over again. I’ve traveled to so many worlds, and I can’t even kill one of them.”\nAt Hildir’s command, the S-rank Hunters charged toward Georgic, who was in the middle of slashing tribal warriors and demonic beasts.\n“Peel off the imprinted ‘skin’! That’s their weakness!”\nEven in the midst of the commotion, Georgic split the skull of a charging warrior but he didn’t die.\n-Grrrrr!\nThe imprint on the nape of his neck degrades his flesh, and he swells into a large bear.\nGeorgic’s eyes widened at the sight.\n“The holy law must have destroyed his soul.”\nHis one-handed hammer isn’t just a hammer; it’s a holy artifact that contains his entire life’s holy power, and it constantly absorbs his holy power to enforce the Holy Law of Doom.\nLike other Holy Knights’ holy swords and lances, Georgic’s hammer extinguishes the souls of those it kills.\nEven the mark of the Beast God on a barbarian warrior’s body should fade upon contact. However, he proceeded with his beastification at the same time as his decapitation, proof that something was wrong with his holy power.\n-Uh-uh-uh…!\nHe kicks a giant bear in the shin as it lunges at him and the creature falls to the blows of his hammer.\n“Whoa…!”\nHe hurries to gather the knights and soldiers. If even he, a Holy Knight, can’t use the Holy Law properly, this battlefield will be a constant battle of attrition.\nThey are overwhelmed, but he must send out a dispatch to the kingdom to enlist the help of the other Holy Knights.\n“Everyone retreat──”\nIt was then that a shadow rushed toward Georgic and a two-handed hammer the size of a man slammed into him but Georgic quickly blocked it with his shield.\n“Crunch…!”\nHe recognized the hammer’s wielder: a mercenary captain of considerable strength who now wore the beast imprint and glared at him but he wasn’t the only one.\n“Krr…!”\nAn armored warrior rushes forward and delivers a heavy body blow and impact force far exceeding the previous one is transmitted through the armor and almost simultaneously an assassin stabs him in the back.\n-Boom!\nBut he quickly ducks his head and barely manages to block the dagger’s blow with his armor.\n-Papapap!\nA flurry of arrows shoots out and even though the Holy Law blocked 90% of the damage, the speed was too much to ignore.\nLee Yong-wan, an S-rank Hunter from the Firebird Guild can sense the slightest crack in Georgic’s armor, and he’s firing arrows at high speed.\nThe four S-class Hunters surrounded Georgic, each much stronger than before.\n“You…you must be bearing the heretics imprint.”\nFoolish things. What kind of ignoramuses would believe in a cult that worships beasts?\nThey should all be killed, skinned, and incinerated for their insanity.\n“If you were merely lured by riches, it would have been a simple matter of killing you but if you have the imprint of a beast-god, I have no intention of sparing your souls!”\nGeorgic was furious and determined to extinguish these foolish souls. Though he doubted he could use the Holy Law properly now.\n-Bam!\nThe two-handed hammer was the most intimidating attack and if he blocks it with his shield, a fierce pugilist will pounce on the gap and there was also the archer.\nHe couldn’t just worry about the three men in front of him since if he let himself be vulnerable the assassin would quickly thrust her dagger in his back.\n-Kaaaah!\nThe dagger, which was engraved with the beast god imprint, attacked Georgic with great force while Golden Chul readied his hammer to deliver a deadly blow.\n“Don’t look down on me, you insolent things!”\nIt was then that Georgic threw down his shield and swung his hammer with all his might.\nGolden Chul clashed with his hammer, and in the next moment, the golden hammer shattered.\n“Know thy place, lowly thing!”\nIn the next moment, the swinging hammer struck Golden Chul in the chest and he rolled across the floor and was knocked out.\n“Whoa…!”\nTo counter the Golden Chul deadly blow, he allowed Ha Yuri, Huang Yeon-ha, and Lee Yong-wan to attack. However, Grail Knight Georgic is still standing, recovering himself.\nHe glanced at his surroundings but the situation was not favorable.\nCorpses are crawling like beasts out of the holes where the first Divine Punishment, Earthshatter, should have crushed them and if all the barbarians in the area can be turned into beasts, the Knights alone will not be able to withstand them.\nI will burn this body to the ground to send the survivors back to the kingdom!\nGeorgic steeled his resolve as dozens of beasts charged at him.\n“To the Lionheart…! Glory be!”\nA golden knight fell from the sky as the Pegasus rider slashed through the giant beasts with his holy spear.\nThere was a master of the Pegasus beside himself on this battlefield? Georgic naturally looked at him.\n“Who are you?”\nThe man in gold answered his question.\n“I am King Leonheart, Guardian of the Grail and agent of the Ten Thousand Gods. I am Leon Dragonia Lionheart.”",

      "content": "Chapter 62: Holy Knight Georgic (3)\nAs they raced, Leon explained to the queen and the cadets about the “savages who worship beast gods.\n“They are like rats. We slaughter them from time to time and reduce their numbers, but they always find a way to breed somewhere.”\nHa-ri wondered if it was similar to the periodic extermination of northern immigrants.\n“Well, but… skinning them to death, or even killing their children…….”\n“The kingdom and its knights are not fools who like to do inefficient things. The reason for the skinning is the imprint.”\n“An imprint?”\nLeon threw a piece of something at Ha-ri. She barely caught it as her horse galloped away and yelped at the odd texture.\n“What, human skin?!”\n“There were a bunch of skinned things, and thou art surprised to see it.”\n“Ugh…….” The medieval man didn’t have modern sensibilities but Ha-ri unfolded the hide with one hand and found an imprint on it.\n“What is this…….?”\n“An oath to give yourself to the Beast God. From the moment you engrave it and abuse its power, it will slowly erode your soul.”\n“That’s not possible…….”\n“They infiltrate the cities, dazzle the unsuspecting populace with their power and eventually their souls are consumed and become servants of the Beast God.”\nThus, the only solution is extermination. They may not be demons, but they are followers of an evil god who is no better than a demon.\n“Remember. Your peaceful common sense and fuzzy human rights are useless in this bitter fight. All that is needed is truth and absolute justice.”\n“…….”\nThe cadets fell silent and could only affirm Leon’s words. At first, they thought he was some kind of lunatic, but anything this man said usually made sense.\n“I believed in you, your majesty…….”\nAs Kim Jae-hyuk awkwardly stuttered, Chun So-yeon hit him on the head with the scabbard.\n“Ugh…! Why did you hit me?”\n“Get serious.”\nLord Toscana Vendellic, the Kingdom Knight leading Leon, shouted.\n“We’ve arrived!”\nHa-ri and the cadets swallowed at the knights, soldiers, and monsters tangled together in a terrible melee.\n“What, what is it?”\n“There are members of the Firebird Guild and the Golden Lion Guild!”\n“What’s going on?!”\nThe barbarian warriors already beastified by the Imprint and the Hunters were controlled by the Beast God Shaman.\nThe isolated knights and soldiers held out, but it seemed only a matter of time before they were swept away by the tide.\n“These foul beasts!”\n“We must charge now!”\nA dozen or so knights rushed toward the battlefield, furious.\n“Wait, wait. It’s not right to charge in from here.”\n“But how then…….”\n“Wait.”\nLeon dismounted his horse and scanned the battlefield, looking for Georgic.\nHe stood out from the crowd on the battlefield as a heavily armored green knight and he was being pinched by Korean S-rank hunters and beastly monsters.\nBy nature, they were no match for him.\nFirst, the Holy Knight’s holy law easily breaks the hold of the Beast God, and the corpse’s imprint is erased upon death.\nThe fact that there used to be few barbarians around the Lionheart Kingdom is due to the conceptually enforced laws of the Holy Knights.\nHowever, control and resurrection by the beast imprint proceeds without incident. This indicates that something is wrong with Georgic’s Holy Law.\n“If only I could summon her…….”\nLeon knew of a ‘divine beast’ that could be of great use at this stage but summoning such a great being is too much of a burden.\n[Lionheart, my knight]\nIt was then that Leon heard the voice of the goddess in his ear.\n“Arianna?”\nArianna, Goddess of Light and Justice spoke directly to Leon’s ears.\n[Your goddess speaks on behalf of Demera. Go and reclaim the souls we have failed to reclaim, the wandering souls who have given their allegiance to the pantheon]\n“I will gladly receive them.”\nThe Goddess need not command Leon’s actions, she has come to show him the way.\n[Bind the Ancestor’s Reins to Stallion, for they have the power to awaken old bloodlines]\n“You mean Argent Majesty’s Reins?”\nLeon immediately pulled out the treasure he’d been gifted.\nLeon’s ancestor, Argent Majesty Lionheart legendary reins of are said to tame even the fiercest of beasts but Leon burned this treasure at the King’s funeral, wishing him well as he rode his horse through the meadows of paradise.\nHowever after hundreds of years, the reins were returned to his hands and wrapped around Stallion at the command of the Goddess.\n-Purrrr!\nStallion… gladly accepted the reins from his best friend, and at that moment, something amazing happened.\n“This, this…!”\nThe knights, the queen, and even the cadets stared in amazement as wings had sprouted from Stallion!\nEven Leon was surprised by the sight.\n“Stallion…! I heard that you had the bloodline of a Celestial Horse, but…….”\nStallion is a divine horse, carrying only great bloodlines and noble beings on its back.\nLeon heard there’s even a Pegasus in that long line, but he never expected Stallion to awaken a bloodline that’s been cut off in Leon’s generation.\n“I can’t believe he was willing to give away such a great treasure…….”\nIf these reins are a treasure that can awaken even an old bloodline…could something similar be done to other beasts?\nPerhaps it would even be possible to turn a degenerate drake back into a dragon.\n“The horse has wings…….”\nThe cadets were stunned by the awakening but Leon told them.\n“You guys will wait here with the knights.”\n“What? Uh, why?”\n“Guardian of the Grail, are you asking us to abandon an honorable battle!”\nAt these words, both the cadets and the knights recoiled. It seemed as if Leon alone would throw himself into that abyss.\n“There is no way that less than a dozen horsemen can break through this besieged terrain. You are not up to the task.”\n“Then your majesty intends to ride in there alone?”\n“Not alone.”\nIt was Queen Beatrice who stepped forward and held out her hand while smiling.\n“Thank you for your help.”\n“It is my duty.”\nLeon took the queen’s hand and helped her climb atop Stallion, who had become a Pegasus.\n“Your example is here. Today you shall witness the pinnacle of the glory you should seek.”\nLeon took the reins, and Stallion soared into the sky.\n* * * *\nThe road to Georgic was rough as a flock of giant eagles blocked Stallion’s approach.\n“Filthy beasts. Stallion, you’re not going to get tied up by those things, are you?”\n“Krrr…!”\nStallion responds to Leon’s playful taunt with a growl.\nAlthough it was the first time Stallion had ever flown, the noble beast quickly got used to it.\nThe giant eagles charged but the beasts were newly beastified and unaccustomed to flight so they tried to overwhelm Stallion with their numbers and mass but an invisible wall formed simultaneously with their wings. They couldn’t even slow him down.\n-Boom!\nThe collision ripped through their flesh, and they screamed in shock. In one swift motion, Stallion broke through the group of giant eagles and continued his glide.\nThe eagles gave chase, letting out an irritating tune but behind Leon’s back, Beatrice laughed.\n“Allow me.”\nAt that moment, a delicate touch flows through the air and those skilled in the manipulation of magic would have marveled at the magnificent power concentrated in that beautiful touch.\n-Kuwaaaaah!\nIt was a black arrow but it looked more like a beam cannon from a space opera than an arrow.\nEstimated magic power: Class A ray magic. It requires a casting time even for a high-ranking mage of the Tower, but Beatrice formed it with a wave of her hand.\n-Kaak?\nWith a simple wave of her hand, the stains in the sky are washed away and in the meantime, Stallion has arrived above Georgic.\n“Hold the reins for a moment. I need to clear the ground.”\nStallion stirred at the touch of one who was not Leon, but he was quickly soothed by the nobility of the touch.\nJust like that Leon leapt from his steed.\n“Who are you?”\n“I am King Lionheart, Guardian of the Grail and agent of the Ten Thousand Gods. I am Leon Dragonia Lionheart.”\nHe answered Georgic’s question.\n* * * *\nGeorgic was surprised by Leon’s sudden appearance.\n“The Lionheart King…I do not know who you are, but it is a great honor for a man of God to be called that…”\n“Now is not the time for small talk, Holy Knight of Demera. We must get through this mess first.”\n“……I agree. But how?”\nThe Holy Law is not functioning properly, and the situation is completely out of hand. What could they do in such a situation?\n“First…we need to shut down those pathetic little bastards.”\nLeon looked at the S-class Hunters surrounding the two of them. Including the raiding party, there were more than a hundred of them.\nThey still had the minds of beasts, but not the bodies. Unlike the barbarians, who are dedicated to the beast gods from birth, they have an innate resistance and a short lifespan.\n“I am the Lionheart King and I have come to lead you to paradise.”\nFor a moment, Georgic’s eyes widened at the sight of the holy object Leon held out.\n“Holy Grail!”\nIt was the holy object that has been passed down through the generations of the Lionheart Kings and the reason why they are called the Guardians.\nAn object of such holy energy could never be imitated.\nThe Holy Grail glows of its own accord, holy water bubbles and the sky responds.\nThe dull, dry sky opened up in an instant, and thunder crackled.\n-What, what?\n-What’s going on?\nThe soldiers are agitated, and they’re not the only ones. The servants of the evil beast god who were beastified were also terrified by the shaking sky.\nAt that very moment the holy water evaporated and met the clouds in the sky as a giant semicircle of golden light formed in the center of the sky.\nThe Great Law of Radiance was a divine shield granted only to the Grail Guardians.\nEven the Holy Knights, who have lived a life of honor and glory for hundreds of years, are unable to perform this miracle.\n“Are your wounds healed?”\n“No way…My arm was cut off…….”\nLeon used Grail Healing on a massive scale and the effect was truly miraculous as thousands of soldiers and knights who were dying from injuries were healed and regenerated, one by one but that was not all.\n“Keeeeeeeeeeee!”\nExposed to the shroud of light, the beasts writhed in agony on their burning skin, even those that were beastified and imprinted with the power of the evil beast god while the skin of the warriors who hadn’t yet beastified burned.\n“Ugh, ugh… what, what?”\n“Oh, it hurts… so, so much…….”\nAnd as the imprints burned the Hunters cried out in pain.\nIt was only a matter of time before the imprinting would be completed, but as their strength drained from them, they were left helpless, watching a miracle unfold before their eyes.\n“Ahhh…….”\n“What the heck…….”\nIt was a miracle of the gods.\nThe knights, the soldiers and the men who had fallen to the ground around Leon, were lifted to their feet by the energy poured from the heavens by the Guardian on behalf of the gods.\nAs brilliance radiated from him and divine energy overflowed even from his breath the knights and Georgic realized that this was the true power they had forgotten.\nHow had they not known?\nHow had they not noticed?\nThat this great power is a miracle of the gods and──\n“It is the Holy Power…….”\nGeorgic felt the true holy power flowing through Leon.\n[My child. My lost knight.]\n“Demera?”\n[Go and help the king of knights.]\nGeorgic took up his hammer and repaired his shield.\nThere were many questions, and he let them all flow.\n“Guardian of the Grail, I join you.”\n“It is a pleasure to stand on the same battlefield, Sir Georgic.”\nIt was then that the beasts that had been screaming in agony within the veil of brilliance began to surge forward in waves, forming a massive mass.\nThe souls that had been sacrificed to the beast gods, their bodies twisted, now began to intertwine with each other’s flesh.\n“Great Iron King, we offer you our slaves!”\nAt the end of it all was Hildir, the shaman of the Tribal Alliance.\nShe was once beautiful, but her skin, melted away by the veil, was hideous. However as the agent of an evil god’s will, she survived the miracle of the Holy Law.\nHildir knew she could not back down from this since unlike the soul-bound Georgic, this was a real Holy Knight.\nA being that enforces the Holy Law and a user of the holy law who could ‘extinguish’ demons that could not be killed or even evil shamans whose bodies were but shells.\nIt’s a shame, but I can only sacrifice all the worshippers within the gate, even if it costs me my soul itself.\n[Krrrrr…! Lionheart……!!]\nIt was through the intertwining of over ten thousand sacrifices that an incarnation was formed.\nThe largest of the beast gods possessed an incarnation that was over 50 meters tall, it was Iron King.\nThe remaining remnants are the beasts of Suri and Mazer, and even their numbers are formidable.\n“An incarnation. I once destroyed the incarnations of Bai Lang and Mazer.”\nBeast Gods were the ones who rampaged with the orcs when the demons were on the loose and led the world to ruin.\nTime and again, they summoned incarnations to aid them, but Leon defeated them all alone. And now──\nHe raised his holy sword against all the evils of the end of the world.\n“Hear, my brothers and sisters! Knights of glory and loyal soldiers, the time has come to punish the disgusting heresy!”\nLeon ran towards the beasts.\n“I will join you, King Lionheart!”\nGeorgic followed and despite his massive armor, he was not far behind Leon.\n“Follow the Holy Knight!”\n“Follow the Agents of the Gods!”\nBeatrice smiles as she glides through the sky on the Pegasus, watching the knights charge.\n“I will open the way.”\nShe gestured.\n“By the laws of magic, I command the magical forces of the world.”\nWithin this gate, the terrifyingly full power of magic is woven back together by her hand.\nThe basis of magic is reason and its application.\nIf holy power is a miracle that bends the laws, magic is a phenomenon that utilizes the laws.\nThis is an admission of magic’s inferiority in the hierarchy, but how can magic be neglected in favor of miracles?\n“Holy laws cannot enforce concepts, but…….”\nBeatrice Aligieri Spero, Magician Queen of the Kingdom of Spero and defender of the kingdom for decades, was at the height of her powers.\n<Death Eyes>\nBlack beams of light erase the beasts in the sky.\nDozens of A-rank magic beams is the firepower of a single human being at its peak but the Queen’s magic doesn’t end there.\nGreat Magic <Brightening Heavenly Beetle>\nLightning crackles in the sky, colored golden by Leon’s chalice as the queen artificially generates lightning and harnesses the power of nature.\nThe hail reduces the charging boars to a handful of ashes.\n“It’s crazy…!”\nThe Hunters who had been watching cried out in horror.\nThe sky rumbles, and space shakes as the Magician Queen’s unorthodox magic created a great light, stirred up a storm, and rained down thunderbolts.\nHer magic was more like a natural disaster than magic.\n-Ki──!\nThe hordes of eagles in the sky and boars on the ground were quickly cleared away. Then, with the road clear, the two knights head toward Iron King. However, their opponent is a 50-foot monster but this is where the Holy Law comes in.\nAs the Goddess of the Earth answers Georgic’s prayer Holy Law <Earth Spear> transforms the earth into a sharp spear that pierces Iron King.\n[Huh?!]\nThough not pierced, Iron King staggers before the thousands of tons of mass impact but the spear wasn’t just a weapon.\nLeon, who had been running on the ground, used the Earth Spear, which had been raised by the Holy Law, as a ramp and when he closed the distance enough, he grabbed the glowing Holy Sword.\n[Lionheart…you again!!]\n“Shut your disgusting mouth, beast!”\nLeon’s holy sword flashed and sank into Iron King’s throat. Even if the bear was made of steel, Leon’s holy sword pierced through its soft hide with ease.\n[Kaaaah…!]\nBut the wound was shallow because the size of the incarnation was large. However Leon didn’t push himself any harder and spurred himself away from Iron King, trusting ‘them’.\n-Dag-dag-dag-dag!\nHundreds of horses charged as the diagonally rising earth was no hindrance to the Kingdom’s Knights.\nThe lance-wielding knights charge in unison as they have their sights set on the cracked neck of Iron King.\n“We are the Knights of Realm!”\n“Shields to defend the glorious kingdom of the gods and spears to pierce evil flesh!”\n“”Evil, be destroyed!””\nGrail Guardians and Holy Knights…they are blessed with countless favors and perform miracles with their mere mortal bodies, and among them there is a legion blessing named <Wedge Charge>.\nThe breakthrough power of the knights reaches its peak.\n-Boom!\nThe Knights throw themselves into a single charge, even if it means falling off a cliff.\n[How dare you, you bastards!]\nSlashed, pierced, and shattered, the Iron King’s head lies in tatters but the opponent is a god incarnation and although two hundred knights charged at it, it still retained its form.\n“Know the grace of thy land.”\nGeorgic stood atop Iron King’s head as the knights charged.\n“Purge your disgusting sin and ignorance with blood and screams of pain.”\nThe Holy Knight of Life and Abundance,\n“Your filthy flesh shall find no rest in death.”\nHammer is lifted and blots out the sun.\n“Die and become the fertilizer of the earth, you disgusting heretics.”\nDivine Punishment <Earthshatter>.\nThe hammer crashes down on Iron King’s skull.",

      "content": "Chapter 63: Holy Knight Georgic (4)\nShe ran through a field soaked in blood.\nIt was a blood-soaked field, with pieces of flesh strewn everywhere.\nA corpse here, a corpse there. The soles of her feet hit the ground, crunching up chunks of meat.\n“Shit… shit! Fucking monsters!”\nHildir, shaman of the beast gods, steadied her crumbling body and opened the escape route.\nCenturies of planning had failed. Damned Holy Knights, three such monsters!\nGeorgic, restored to his former glory, and the Lionheart King, from who knows where. And──\n“Where are you off to?”\nThe Black Witch’s voice drifted in front of Hildir.\n“Pfft…!”\nThe Magician Queen, who, unlike the Holy Knights, was not enforced by the Holy Law, but had more firepower than anyone else.\nHildir was afraid of the Holy Law of the Holy Knights, but she considered this monster to be the most ‘prime’ power in existence, especially in a place as magical as this one.\n“I have a question for you.”\nThe voice from beyond the cotton cloth was calm. Nevertheless, her hands and feet tremble, and her disoriented mind threatens to seize up.\nThe Demon Queen stares at the red stone in her hand.\n“I’ve heard it’s called an enchantment stone, and that it can be mined through hunting within the gates. It’s basically a new resource with concentrated magical power.”\nBeatrice had researched the power that supported modern Earth civilization. As a being at the pinnacle of magic, it was second nature to her to study it.\nBut the more she learned about these gems and gates, the more questions she had. There were many questions, but for now…….\n“This gate. The output of the spirit stones was vastly superior to the other gates, and they were scattered about as if they had caught millions of monsters.”\n“That, that’s not how…….”\n“It’s strange, isn’t it? No matter how big the gate is, there’s a finite amount of it inside after all, and yet there are so many magic stones scattered all over the place.”\nIt’s like when one war ends, another begins.\n“It’s a cycle, isn’t it? Just as they tried to corrupt me.”\nThe Queen’s gaze flickers to the battlefield. Knights and soldiers mowing down the remaining beasts as the tide of battle has already turned.\n“Hoo-hoo, I don’t think you’re a demon…but what you’re doing is the same as what I’ve seen them do. I have so many questions for you.”\nHildir realized this woman didn’t consider her a mere NPC; she was going to take her alive, the only ‘living’ thing in this gate.\n“Great beast gods, to your slave-“\n“Stop.”\nHic, a chill runs down her spine.\nWhat was that?\nHildir winced at the voice tickling her ear.\n“It’s not my favorite power, but…I’m careful to use what I can.”\nOut of the corner of her eye, she sees the face of the queen as she reaches for the cotton wool.\nHer hair shimmers like molten silver, her eyes glisten with a strange light, her sweet voice, her gestures and her demeanor had an aura of innate corruption that dazzled Hildir.\n“Will you remain silent?”\n“Ah, ah…….”\nThe sweet voice travels directly through her ears.\nThe seductive lips whispered less than a centimeter away, and Hildir couldn’t fight it.\nShe wants to suck on those lips, bury her face in her chest, and stroke her thighs.\nShe would do anything to have her approval.\n“Goddess…….”\n“Blasphemy. The gods are different, but…yes, I will allow you to call me Master.”\n“Master…….”\nThe power of corruption is a powerful force against reason but at Beatrice’s level, she could corrupt someone of the same sex with her voice alone. The demons of lust didn’t choose her to be the next demon lord for nothing.\nShe is the most formidable woman of pleasure, capable of causing even fanatics to abandon their gods and only the strongest of minds among the Transcendents would take this power lightly.\n[She let us down again]\nIt was then that the imprints of the Three Beast Gods, which had fallen from the skin of the unfaithful shaman, emitted their own eerie voices.\nThe black smoke in the form of the beasts glared at Beatrice and Hildir as if to kill them.\n“Ah, ah, ah… Gods…….”\nHildir shudders in fear, sensing death but behind her back, Beatrice wraps her arms around her chest and grabs her chin.\nThe queen laughed as she flaunted her power over Hildir, who was unable to resist in the slightest.\n“Your slave is now my slave…what are you going to do about it?”\n[The seed of pleasure…!]\n[I see you’ve got yourself a slave.]\n[I shall chew you up and devour you!]\nThe apparitions twisted with rage as Hildir shuddered and forced herself to divulge the information.\n“The gods will descend. This, this gate is the realm of the beast gods… incarnations, but if the rest of the beast gods descend…!”\n“That would be dangerous.”\nThe beast gods, enraged at being deprived of their slaves, began to create cracks in the space.\n* * * *\nAfter defeating their enemies, the Kingdom army came to a standstill. The Hunters who had opposed them also regained their senses one after another, and naturally, people gathered around Leon.\n“Guardian of the Grail…….”\n“Agent of the Gods…….”\nMore than a living saint, a Holy Knight, a living demigod, Lord of the Lionheart and Guardian of the Grail they considered it an honor just to be able to witness the Lionheart King before their eyes.\n“It was an honor to fight with you, Sir Georgic.”\n“It was my honor, too, sir….”\nGeorgic was awkwardly respectful of Leon, for he was not the only Lionheart King he knew.\n“The 11th Lionheart King, Ronald Batallion Lionheart, often spoke of you and his other knights.”\n“Did you… meet him?”\n“Yes, King Ronald is in the Paradise of the Gods.”\n“No way…….”\nThe implications were clear and Georgic realized why he couldn’t call for reinforcements.\nThe true holy power of the self-proclaimed Lionheart King and the warmth of the Goddess Demera that he had never felt before pointed to one thing.\n“We are already dead.”\nHoly Knight Georgic, the Kingdom Knights, the Knight Errants and the loyal Kingdom soldiers who fought to honor their country were actually already dead, their souls bound to repeat their battles and deaths as NPCs.\nLeon told each and every one of them the truth since these loyal soldiers had a right to know.\n“Your Majesty…!”\nIt was then that four people rode up on horseback in the distance. It was Ha-ri, followed by Soo-ho, Jae-hyuk, and So-yeon.\nThey, too, had been in battle with the knights, and were covered in blood.\n“I told you to stay out of my battle.”\n“Oh, that’s right… I wanted to be of some help…….”\n“Who are these men?”\n“Servants of this king and denizens of another world.”\nHa-ri explained the existence of the Gate, the Hunters, and the Quest to Georgic.\n“According to the quest…we must defeat Lord Georgic to close this gate.”\n“Khhhh…!”\n“Lord Georgic…?”\nHa-ri’s explanation made Georgic chuckle.\nIf you kill a creature within the gate, you’ll get a magic stone and that the gate would only close when the Field Boss was defeated.\nGeorgic marveled at the logic of it all.\n“Your Majesty, perhaps I have not been defeated in all these years!”\n“I see.”\nHis voice was raspy, almost painful to the eardrums but Ha-ri struggled up to him and asked.\n“…Do you remember anything?”\n“Um…! I don’t remember much. We were only here to slay the barbarians.”\n“There must have been some kind of spell from those evil gods and the demons must have helped.”\n“…….”\nHa-ri wondered if she should tell them what she had discovered but perhaps it would drive them to despair.\nHowever Leon, sensing her hesitation, interrupted her.\n“Tell them. They deserve to know the truth.”\n“It’s…….”\nHa-ri quietly recited the truth as the kingdom’s soldiers, including Georgic and the knights, watched.\n“We’ve also found the ore within your bodies…it’s a special ore found in creatures within the Gate.”\nThose with the ore belonged to the Gate except for the few survivors.\n“You cannot leave this gate.”\nGeorgic was not one of the survivors. Neither were the knights, nor the soldiers.\nThe moment the gate closes, they would disappear.\nIt was then that the truth was faced, and everyone realized what they were up against.\n[Lionheart…!!!]\n[I will chew you up and devour you!]\nThe Beast Gods entered the realm.\nFilled with dense magical power, they were a formidable foe that could not be defeated.\n* * * *\nThe crack in space was not the same as when Hildir had summoned an incarnation. Then, there were chunks of meat to make the body but not now.\nAll that remains of the gate is the dregs of meat. Even the magic stones were destroyed by Leon and Georgic, who restored the Holy Law.\nAs a result, it will take time for the Incarnation to descend as Hildir testified to Beatrice’s deception.\n“Is there any way to stop the Incarnation itself?”\n“Hehe, there is none… Now that this gate is… finished… the gods will use all the power of the realm… lavishly.”\n“Hmm…….”\nIn other words, a fight is inevitable but Leon shrugged it off.\n“I will fight. How can I leave this gate without the glorious knights?”\nAs his will to fight burned within him, Beatrice counseled him cautiously.\n“Your Majesty, I don’t think it’s wise to go toe-to-toe with them.”\n“We have a choice. I fear that if the Dungeon Break occurs, they will be out in the open.”\nFight them out there or fight them here but Leon decided that it’s best to fight them here, where there’s at least one more Holy Knight.\n“No, there is a way.”\nGeorgic stepped forward, already stripped of his armor, and his large hand flashed.\n-Kwazik!\nHe pierced his heart with his own hand and pulled out a gigantic magic stone.\n“Huh…!”\n“What did you do?”\nHa-ri and the cadets who witnessed the scene turned around in horror. However, Georgic remained calm.\n“The closing condition is that I, Georgic, fall. It would be pointless to fight at a gate that will soon disappear, wouldn’t it, Your Majesty?”\n“You…….”\nBefore Leon could say anything else, another knight shouted.\n“For the Lionheart King!”\n“We offer our souls to the Great Gods!”\nUnderstanding Georgic’s actions, the knights pulled out the magic stones in their hearts in unison.\n“Thank you, knights.”\nEven as they drew out his heart and bled him dry, he was still breathing.\nThough he was breathing harder than before and breaking into a cold sweat, he was a Holy Knight of Life and Abundance. With his holy law restored, even if his heart were ripped out, his regenerative powers would keep him alive temporarily.\nAnd so it was with every member of the Legion under Georgic’s protection.\n“My brothers and sisters! You know that the final battle is imminent, for here, in this place, is the Lionheart King, a representative of the glory of the gods!”\n“We the dead are willing to lay down our lives for the future of the living!”\n“Will you follow me!”\nAt Georgic’s rousing proclamation, the remaining knights and soldiers of the Legion fully understood their position and stared at their only hope: King Lionheart.\nA being who could sing the glory of the gods for years to come, unlike the dead and imprisoned by the Gate, and there was no hesitation.\nAs the knights had done, the loyal soldiers who had sworn to defend the people and kingdom of Lionheart would gladly cut out their hearts.\n“Gulp!”\n“Damn, that hurts like hell!”\nWith their hearts ripped out, they take out the proof that they are dead but their flesh was now animated only by the miracle of God, not by the magic stones.\nIn the midst of their great sacrifice and loyalty, Leon spoke, his face twisted.\n“Your loyalty puts me to shame, and you have left me a great task.”\n“I ask one more favor, Your Majesty.”\nGeorgic held up the spirit stone and hammer he’d removed from his heart.\n“Goddess Demera, grant me my wish.”\nIf this spirit stone is the vessel that binds his soul-─\n“Loyal to the Lionheart King and favored by Demera, through this hammer I, Georgic, shall pass on my power!”\nGoddess Demera was pleased with the Grail Knight’s Sacred Offering.\nThe spirit stones of Georgic and his soldiers vanish like smoke, and are imbued into the hammer as the Holy Knight’s relic glows with even more power.\nThe Holy Knight, his honorable knights, and his loyal soldiers had poured their souls into the hammer and Georgic handed it to Leon.\n“Please keep it until a man worthy of it appears in front of Your Majesty.”\n“…….”\nLeon gladly accepted the hammer and Georgic clasped Leon’s hand.\n“It was an honor to fight alongside you.”\n“I will remember your honorable ascension, Sir Georgic.”\nLeon turned without hesitation while the queen and the cadets trailed behind him. The Knights stepped forward, dismounting from their steeds and willingly giving them to the Hunters.\n“Take it. Despite your lack of horsemanship, you follow the king.”\n“…….”\nYong-wan shakily took over the horses willingly given to him by the knights who were killing each other just a moment ago.\nMore than a hundred Hunters mounted their steeds and Georgic ordered.\n“Horsemen still on horseback this is your final order. Protect the king until the final retreat.”\n“”Yes, sir!””\nThe survivors rode off, escorted by the remaining horsemen.\nThe dead, who have pledged their allegiance to the living, place their hands on their chests.\n“An honorable life.”\n” May the gods bless you.”\nThousands of soldiers salute Leon then turn to face forward, not looking back at Leon and his men as they disappear from view.\nBaron Laurent Dominek approached him as he put his armor back on and was about to enter the battlefield.\n“Sir Georgic.”\n“Sir Laurent, I see no sign of Sir Gaston.”\n“He was killed fighting the beasts but he left behind this sword.”\nLaurent offered the sword his friend had left to Georgic, whose hands were empty.\n“A fine sword. I will use it to slay my enemies and soothe the soul of Lord Gaston.”\n“He will be pleased.”\n-Purrrr…!\nGeorgic petted the Pegasus that flew toward him, a comrade-in-arms who had hovered around him throughout the battle, driving away the black eagles.\n“You will truly meet your end, my comrade.”\nGeorgic mounted his horse and rode at the head of the line, followed by the Kingdom Knights, the Horsemen, and the soldiers of the realm.\nThe beast-gods burst through the rift, bringing with them gigantic mutants and countless servants.\nAgainst the forces of evil and the gods that no mere mortal can stand, Georgic shouts out.\n“I, Georgic…!”\n“One hundred thousand enemies of the realm I have slain in person, and five million I have defeated as a War Knight!”\n“Undefeated in two thousand two hundred and fifty battles!”\n“Defended Gerhane against three hundred thousand orcs, pitted my strength against the Ogre chieftain and won!”\n“Demera has favored me, Arianna has watched over me, and Petos has rejoiced.”\n“I am Georgic, Holy Knight of Life and Fertility!”\n“You have been reduced to beasts by your lust for power. What do you think you’re capable of?”\nThe thunderous echo made even the beastified monsters tremble with what little instinct they had left.\nA saint, shining brightly on the chaotic battlefield.\nA man favored by the gods and bestowed with their power.\nA knight of glory, a symbol of divine presence and evil.\nHe said.\n“Come, let us go. My brothers and sisters. Today we will die for justice. The gods will avenge us.”\n“”For the Goddess!!””\n“”For honor!!!””\n“”For Lionheart…!!!””\nWith a lion’s roar, the Holy Knight draws his sword.\n“Glory be.”\nForward, singing his final glory.\n“To the Lionheart.”",

      "content": "Chapter 64: Holy Knight Georgic (5)\nThe opening of the fissure is enough to attract beasts that are already too numerous to count and they are chased by horses galloping across the fields.\nThe five hundred horses are in a strange formation.\nHunters on the backs of horses borrowed from the Horsemen are at the center, protected by hundreds of other Horsemen.\n“Fifty white horses on the flank, fast!”\n“Archers!”\nThe Hunters’ enchanted arrows shot at the beasts but they don’t have much of a hit rate since shooting arrows from a horse requires far more skill and practice than shooting from the ground.\nEven the Lionheart scouts, take years of training before they’re put into action, let alone the modern men who’ve been on horseback for the first time today.\nThe Hunters’ volleys of arrows land in the wrong places, and Yong-Wan grinds his teeth.\n“Damn it….”\nHe couldn’t believe that he, an S-class archer, let alone the other Hunters, was like this…how hard was it to shoot an arrow from a horse?\n“Take out the ones approaching from the flanks!”\n“Don’t skimp on the holy spells!”\nThe horsemen were skilled, slaying the charging beasts as they rode.\nEven as they rode at full speed, they would gouge out the eyes of beasts that charged from the flanks with their lances or trip them with their legs.\nUnlike the hunters, who were useless on horseback, the horsemen were different. They were masters of combat, having spent a lifetime honing their skills, but even as they risked their lives to protect them, the beasts kept coming.\n“Beast horde!”\n“I’ll take the skies.”\nStallion, awakened as a Pegasus, swoops down as Beatrice fires magic arrows from behind Leon.\nHer overwhelming firepower mowed down the creatures trying to snatch their mounts. But the cracks don’t stop at one place. They were all over the gate, which was starting to disappear because the closing condition was fulfilled.\n“We’ve got a herd of boars charging from the front!”\nOne of the horsemen shouted to the hunters.\n“Flank them and get around them, the leading thirty will charge with me!”\nLeaving the Hunters behind as they flanked, the leading Horsemen charged at the boars.\nThe wild boar is a particularly intimidating beast because of its charge. Normally, it’s best to avoid a head-on collision and cut them down from the side.\nThe horsemen were able to do just that but they didn’t.\n-Boom!\nThey collide head-on and pierce each other, sending flesh flying in all directions with the impact.\n-Don’t let any of them escape!\nThe tangled horses and boars struggle against each other but the boars can’t even think about chasing the hunters because the knights are stopping them.\n“…….”\n“Your Majesty?”\nWatching it from the air, Leon gritted his teeth. Seven knights had just died instantly from the impact, without even a chance to regenerate but their souls flowed into the Holy Grail.\n“Keep them at bay.”\nBeatrice didn’t ask any more questions until they reached the gate the flying knights fell one by one.\n* * * *\nOne by one, the exhausted Hunters leave the gate but even at moment of escape, the situation is not favorable because beasts attack them from all sides.\n-“Keeeeeeee!\n-Kaak!!!”\n“Guard!”\n“Shield wall!”\nBut the portal is guarded by Knights, the Lionheart King, and the Magician Queen.\nAs they dismount, the bodies pile up in front of the gatekeepers. Nevertheless, beasts try to break through the gap and block their retreat but a group of hunters block them.\n-What?!\nThe black eagles are shot down by flying arrows, and the boars mad dash is stopped by a large man.\n-Eh?\n“Yeon-ha!”\n“Hold on tight!”\nWhile Golden Chul, who had been disarmed by Georgic, held onto the boar, Huang Yeonha punched it in the side until the thick boar’s hide was punctured and it finally collapsed.\n“Are you finished?”\nYong-wan approached, his guildmates having been sent off first, but he stayed behind to help the Horsemen and Leon, and as a stationary artilleryman, he was second only to Beatrice in clearing the air of threats.\n“We did nothing.”\nGolden Chul watched in admiration as Leon and Beatrice still shot down the beasts. He knew they were strong, but he hadn’t expected them to be that strong.\nAs a rescued man, he had stepped forward to help ensure the safety of the rear, but the more he watched them fight, the more he realized his own weakness.\n‘Is that a knight…….?’\nToday they had witnessed the end of an honorable knight and now he owed Leon his life.\nThis debt must be paid, one way or another, today.\n“Come on, it looks like they’re all gone. Let’s get out of here.”\n“…….”\nThe four of them walked out of the gate, checking on Leon, who was staring the way they had come.\n* * * *\nThe beasts are still coming. If we delay, we’ll be swept away by the tidal wave of beasts.\nLeon remained where he was, even though he knew he needed to get out of there as quickly as possible, with the Horsemen acting as shields.\n-Stop them!\n-Don’t let any of them go back!\nThe Knights were falling since the terrain, the numbers, and the odds are stacked against them, but they are desperate since their end is near.\n“Your Majesty!”\nA young girl’s voice called out from behind him. It was Han Ha-ri and the cadets.\n“I told you to go first.”\n“…….”\nThey knew they wouldn’t be much help and that they should retreat first, leaving the Lionheart King and the Magician Queen to their own devices. But…….\n“I think we should…see them through to the end.”\nHa-ri felt obligated to see them through to the end.\nThey were men who were willing to sacrifice for justice and who could choose death for glory and honor.\nNot a single one of them wept, nor a single one spoke of resentment or hatred.\nWhat is it about honor that they believe in so fiercely, that they take it for granted?\nAnd Leon…why did he still remain, knowing of the knights’ loyalty?\nPerhaps he has an obligation to the knights or perhaps he has to stay until the end and make amends for his loyal knights and soldiers even if it’s dangerous and irrational.\n“If you want to stay. Stay.”\nWith those words, Leon stared at the knights of the Horsemen until there was not a single one left. And when the beasts he’d seen over the horizon finally reached him, when he confronted them, he realized that…….\n-What a sight…!\nA black stain covered the sky while the four-legged beasts on the ground scrambled, the black eagles that had gathered in numbers were swooping down in unison.\n“Your Majesty… I think we should get out of here.”\n“Not yet. Not yet.”\nLeon was waiting for someone. He was willing to risk it for that last one but the moment the birds were about to make their final plunge──\n-Kiii?\n-Kii-e-e-e-e-e-e-e!\nScreams erupted here and there as the black specks that covered the sky screamed and crashed, unable to spread their wings.\n“What’s wrong with them?”\nThe cadets were puzzled, but Leon understood and in the next moment, he sensed the ‘soul’ that had returned to the Grail and realized that the Great Soul Strike had pierced the incarnation of the Beast.\n“After all…….”\nLeon’s entire body trembled as anger and uncontrollable hatred shone in his bloodshot eyes.\n“You will pay for this, and the Beasts you serve will die the most horrible deaths!”\nHoly Knights impose consequences through the Holy Laws but are the oaths uttered by the greatest Grail Guardian really enforceable?\nThis oath is something that Leon will enforce one day.\n“We’re retiring but I will remember this day.”\nTurning their reins they left but no one pursued Leon.\n* * * *\nThe gate of Jeju Island closed and Leon and the cadets were escorted back by the president of the Association, Mr. Oh Kang-hyuk. However, their steps were heavy, as their leader, Leon, remained silent.\nThe cadets who hadn’t participated in the gate attack had a puzzled look on their faces, but Kim Jae-hyuk and Han Soo-ho took notice.\nWith all that done, they returned to the bedroom but Leon couldn’t sleep for a while.\nThis is not the first time he has witnessed the death of his comrades-in-arms as countless knights have fallen in the Great War against the demons, soldiers have met their end, Holy Knights who he could on have ascended one by one, and saints and priests have fallen into the arms of the gods.\nIn the end, only Leon survived and when the gods moved the pantheon to his heart, he accepted it willingly, but the weight was by no means light.\n“After…….”\nLeon stood up, unable to sleep, and Yappy whimpered beside him, but Leon patted him on the back and left the room.\nThe guild compound has a bar for drinking. Not the fancy, upscale bars of the city, but a crude facility to supply the soldiers and relieve their fatigue.\nOnly recruits who have completed their training period are allowed to drink here. Even then, it’s deserted, as they go to bed early because of their training.\n“Oh, Your Majesty?”\nThere was an unexpected customer.\n“Queen.”\n“Can’t sleep?”\n“Neither can you?”\nBeatrice tilted her head with a languid smile and a goblet full of red wine in her hand.\n“How can you drink without food?”\n“Because I want to get drunk.”\nShe leaned back against the table, uncharacteristically agitated.\nUnlike her usual laid-back demeanor, she looked vulnerable now.\n“I’ll have a drink, too.”\n“You’re drinking with me?”\n“I’m drinking with you.”\n“Whoo-hoo…….”\nBeatrice staggers to a new glass and pours the wine. The overflowing goblet was full of red.\n“Your Majesty…do you also honor those who have gone before?”\nBeatrice’s gaze fell on the glass and Leon smiled bitterly as he looked into her red eyes through the swirling wine.\n“Being a monarch is a tiring job.”\nYou must carry more burdens than anyone else, be stronger than anyone else, and never give up even if no one is left standing at the end of the fight.\nLeon took a big sip of his drink. It was strong. Very much so.\nBeatrice wordlessly refilled his empty glass and grinned as they clinked their glasses together.\nUnexpectedly, it was a common culture across the worlds.\n“Queen.”\n“Call me Beatrice. I have no kingdom or people to protect anymore.”\nHow can a king of a kingdom with no people be called a king? Beatrice gave him a sympathetic glance as she recited her lament.\n“And so it is with me.”\n“Not so with you. You are carrying their souls, and the gods themselves are counting on you.”\nAnd most of all.\n“You are soothing their souls and fulfilling their hopes. You are a great king, incomparable to the likes of me.”\n“……Don’t blame yourself. You are as good a king as any.”\nShe threw herself into the machinations of the demons to save her people and her country.\nAfter nearly a hundred years of destruction and rebirth she may have failed, but who can blame her for her determination.\n“You were victorious in the end, uncompromising with evil, upholding justice and conviction, so that even now your people and knights can hope for paradise.”\nBeatrice’s eyes were both praising and sorrowful as she spoke of Leon.\n“And that is why I feel sorry for you, for you will carry that burden for all eternity. You will lose again and again but you will rise every time.”\nBeatrice had seen the look on Leon’s face when he was forced to watch Georgic ascend. It was a terrible loneliness, a struggle with no end in sight.\nHe must have been frustrated but he was not one to crumble in frustration; he would rise again and again.\nShe wanted to lean against him, struggling under her own weight, to rest her burden on his shoulders, even if it was only for a brief moment of respite.\nThe Death Knights had stood by her until the very end, and the only way she could repay their loyalty was to ensure their safe reincarnation.\nShe could rely on them no longer so she must do whatever he can to lighten his burden.\n“If there is anything you would like me to do, please tell me.”\nNo matter what it is, Beatrice will give Leon what he wants. Leon read her determination and will and smiled bitterly.\n“This king has fought so long alone that he has forgotten all those comrades-in-arms who once fought by his side…….”\nToday, Leon recalled that loss.\n“My people, my friends, my kingdom. My…….”\nLeon didn’t think much more of it; he didn’t want to mention the two men for only he remembered the losses and sorrows that were his alone.\nLeon looked at Beatrice.\n“You must not die before this king, for the death of a companion is hard on the bones, no matter how many times it happens.”\nThe night wore on as they, who shared the same wounds, spent a long time talking.",

      "content": "Chapter 65: Georgic, After\nThe Golden Lion Guild building.\nAn up-and-coming guild in Korea, founded by S-class hunter Golden Chul, this guild was, until recently, a firm favorite among the top 10 guilds. However, the Cheongju Gate and Jeju Island Gate caused them great damage.\nThey’ve gained honor and prestige, but not much else. On top of that, the loss of the guild’s first-team veteran raiders was irreplaceable.\nHowever, the Golden Lion Guild will definitely recover from this wound.\nAs long as Guild Master Golden Iron is around, the Golden Lion Guild will not fall apart.\nThat being said, they couldn’t afford to slack off since the Golden Lion Guild’s quarterly results have been declining with each successive loss of life. Nevertheless…….\n“Are you still training?”\n“My Sister~”\nHwang Yeon-ha looked worriedly at her brother, who had been living in the training room since the Jeju Island Gate.\nYeon-ha knew why her brother was like that. Although they resent each other like normal siblings, they are alike.\n“I thought he was pretty strong.”\nThere are only 20 S-class Hunters in Korea and all the top 10 guilds have one as a leader but Holy Knight Georgic was an unparalleled powerhouse of strength, conviction, and will plus he had hundreds of knights under his command that would have been hailed as mighty men of renown in Korea.\n“Holy Knights…….”\nWho are they?\nSo strong, so determined, and most of all-─\n“They’re cool.”\n“Well… I agree.”\nWith the way things ended it seemed like there was no way to resolve his complicated feelings.\n* * * *\nYong=wan is greedy, he loves money and enjoys watching his fortune grow.\nIt is said that the top 10 guilds in Korea are close to the political world and wield unlimited power, but to Yong-wan, power is just a means to increase his wealth.\nPatriotism, justice, childish things like that don’t help you make money.\nIn modern times, childish ideas are ridiculed. “We, the dead, will gladly lay down our lives for the future of the living!”\n“Whoa…….”\nOpening his eyes, Yong-wan realized that he was in his office.\n“Mmm…I must have dozed off.”\nIt was because he had stayed up all night to process the aftermath of the Jeju Gate but in fact, he hadn’t gotten any work done.\n“You’re not doing so well these days.”\nThe voice belonged to Ha Yuri, an S-class Hunter and Vice Guild Leader of the Firebird Guild, who usually acts as Yong-wan’s secretary.\nAdministrative work is a bit of a chore for Yong-wan.\n“Does it bother you? It gives me nightmares.”\n“……It’s noisy.”\n“If you have a problem, it’s best to talk to someone who knows how to solve it. There’s only one person on this planet who can answer your questions.”\nAt the mention of Leon’s name, Yong-wan smirked.\n“That classist? We’d be lucky if he doesn’t call us names.”\n“You seem to be a surprisingly talkative type.”\n“Heh…….”\nHe owed him his life but that didn’t mean he had any intention of getting close. Yong-wan and Leon were the polar opposites.\n“Now that the situation is under control…I should thank him, but the gift…you can send it yourself.”\n“Should I send Treasure No. 7?”\n“Oh, come on, that’s a lot of money!”\nLooking at Yong-wan shouting, Ha Yuri smirked.\n“You know there’s a big guild gathering for the tax exemption bill next week, they sent me the dress code.”\n“Damn, I forgot. Where’s it coming from?”\n“Celestial, Mujin, Shark…Divine Sword. Most of the top ten guilds are coming.”\n“With this many people, the government won’t be able to hold out much longer. Even if they increase the tax exemption by 20% after all the hard work…….”\n“Take it. You follow the king’s word, even if you lack horsemanship.”\n“An honorable life.”\n“May the gods bless you.”\n“…….”\n“Yong-wan?”\nHonor, justice, glory. Such vain things…….\n“Tsk.”\nYong-wan suddenly felt sick to his stomach. He couldn’t explain why, it just hurt.\n“Tell them I’m sick and won’t be able to attend.”\n“It’s five days away?”\n“I’ll be sick until then.”\nEver since I saw those knights, his mountain of riches didn’t seem so attractive anymore.\nIt’s just that he saw something so intense that, for a moment, he lost interest in making money.\n* * * *\nHa-ri was at the gym again today, following her morning routine. But lately, she’s been arriving earlier and earlier, and there are familiar faces on the field.\n“Soo-ho, did you sleep well?”\n“Yeah, sis.”\nIt was Han Soo-ho, her younger brother from the same orphanage.\nHe was holding a sword and shield, and pounded a scarecrow Yappy had set up for training. It was not just any scarecrow, it was a guardian who guarded the fields.\n“Senior Han, good morning.”\n“Senior Ha-ri, good morning!”\nChen So-yeon and Kim Jae-hyuk came to say hello when they saw Ha-ri enter.\nChen So-yeon was always a fast learner, but it was surprising that even the playful Jae-hyuk came to the training center in the morning.\n“Jae-hyuk has been so diligent lately. Even at the academy, he always missed morning practice.”\n“Well…”\nJae-hyuk scratched his cheeks as if embarrassed, then blushed as if remembering the object of his admiration.\nThe three of them couldn’t figure out what he was talking about.\n“Knights…….”\nThe four of them had seen knights at the gate of Jeju Island.\nAt first, they thought that chivalry, honor and glory were characteristic of Leon, and that only a freak like Leon was unusually concerned about such things.\nHowever, that was not the case.\nHoly knights, the pinnacle of knighthood, and Kingdom Knights, the formal knights along with the Knight Errants who weren’t official knights yet were strong enough to meet Leon’s strict standards for knighthood.\nIt wasn’t just about strength. All of them were honorable, dignified, and armed with unwavering conviction and faith.\nThough their strength was similar, their will was not even close.\n“Does his majesty really think we can be…knights like that?”\nEveryone was speechless at Soo-ho’s discouragement.\nA week ago, they had thought they could since out of the 45 knight trainees, only four of them were squires.\nThey had flirted with the idea that if they trained well, they would be recognized as Kingdom Knights but now they knew much weight the title of knight, and the honor of being called “Sir” meant to Leon.\nA knight is not just a good fighter. They must be honorable, seek glory, and be willing to lay down their lives for their comrades.\nSuch was the case with the horsemen, and even the common soldiers.\nThe comparison is all too real in how Leon devalues the superhuman Hunters of Earth.\nTo him, the Hunters were nothing more than mercenaries who only cared about money.\n‘Wait a minute…….’\nHa-ri suddenly felt a strange sensation.\nAt this time they knew how brilliant and upright the knights were. Then…….\n‘At that pinnacle, his majesty has been fighting alone for two hundred years…’\nWhat kind of battle had he been fighting?\n* * * *\n“Lord Spinner, you’re in charge from now on.”\nAfter handing over the trainees training to Yappy, Leon made his way to the knights’ training grounds.\nThe Knight’s Training Center is nothing more than another training center, isolated from the trainees, except that it’s large enough to run a horse through.\nHere, Leon summoned his holy sword and began training in swordsmanship.\nIt’s something he’s practiced every day of his 300 years of life with the knights of the Grand Duchy, with his wandering companions, and since becoming king, with his soldiers and knights but suddenly he was the only one left.\n“Whoa…….”\nEver since he became a Grail Knight, he had never lost his physical vigor.\nNo matter how much he fought, he never got tired, no disease could affect him, and he always maintained perfect vitality.\n“I’m tired.”\nNevertheless, Leon felt tired as his mind grew weary.\nLeon was tired enough to stop the routine he had been repeating for over 300 years.\nThe first fifteen years of his reincarnation in the other world had been a good time.\nHe had suffered physically under the tutelage of a Holy Knight, but he was confident in his future.\nEven when wandering and fighting orcs, vampires, and barbarians, even when neighbor countries were torn apart by the Demon Lords… even when alone and fighting a war that would last for who knows how long like a horse pulling a carriage, he just kept going.\nWhen he thought about it, it was a life of running forward without ever feeling tired but why was the fatigue that he hadn’t felt when he was slaying demons bothering him now?\n“Khhhh…….”\nYes, he was afraid of losing and the prospect of fighting alone again was terrifying.\nLeon is human, after all.\n‘But it is a burden I must bear alone.’\nLeon reached for his sword to shake off his thoughts.\n“Ah, Your Majesty, are you here?”\nHa-ri pushed open the door to the training center and poked her head inside.\n“I thought you were off at this hour.”\nOver the past few months, Leon had gotten to know Ha-ri’s routine. Basically, she spends her evenings after work watching soap operas.\nShe’s a hard worker, but she makes sure to take her breaks.\nHa-ri scratched her cheek and replied.\n“It’s just that…lately, I’ve felt the need to train.”\n“Suddenly?”\n“Not suddenly.”\nShe’d come to train herself since the young ones weren’t quite up to Leon’s standards, but this is something to be proud of.\n“Grab the sword. I’ll take a look.”\n“Ah, yes!”\n“Top position.”\n“Yes!”\nHa-ri drew her signature sword and assumed the top stance. She’d been practicing kendo for a long time, so her stance wasn’t too shaky.\n“Block.”\nLeon swung his sword, and Ha-ri blocked it.\n“Ugh…!”\nHa-ri barely blocked it, but the shock from the sword made her arms tingle.\n“Your strength is not normal after all!\nA second and a third hit followed…fast and furious, but not unstoppable. However, the cumulative impact of the blows caused her arms to drop.\n“Always keep your arms above your navel. If one is down, you’re 0.2 seconds late, if two are down, you’re twice as late.”\n“Ah, I see!”\nHa-ri raises her sword above her navel as Leon points out. In response, Leon grabs the wooden sword with both hands and raises it to the top stance.\n“The hawk’s stance.”\nLeon strikes diagonally from the top but the force in his hands is many times heavier than before.\n“Ugh…!”\nHa-ri is not a weakling and as an A-rank Hunter, she’s a superhuman but even so, it was too much for her to block Leon’s attack.\n“Defense isn’t just about arms and swords. Keep one foot behind you and don’t let the sword’s center of gravity push you away.”\nShe followed the advice and parried, and the blow was less impactful than before. She felt like she was rooted down and supported by the ground.\nA small change in stance made all the difference but just as she was celebrating her success in blocking Leon’s sword, his sword hits hers and they’re entwined like magnets, and Leon shoves Ha-ri with his shoulder.\n“Boom…!”\nHa-ri stumbled backwards, trying to get to her feet, but the sword pressed against her chin glowed brightly.\n“The sword is not your only weapon. Use your whole body as a weapon.”\nLeon continued.\n“The stance of the sword is important. How many times have I told you, be quick. There is no point in being stale and revealing gaps in your movements.”\n“That…To use the ability…….”\n“Don’t think that efficient use of your abilities is the only way to win. What good is that if you die?”\n“Is that so?”\nHa-ri’s eyes widened in surprise at Leon’s words.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Uh, uhm…nothing much.”\nLeon stared at her, and Ha-ri blurted out what she thought.\n“Your Majesty…I thought you’d ask me to fight to the death…….For honor. For glory…….”\n“…….”\nLeon struck Ha-ri in the crown of the head with the hilt of his sword and her head ringed.\n“Foolish one, where is the honor and glory that you have to offer?”\n“Well, it’s true I’m not as good as those knights…….”\n“I don’t mean them. They sang glory for the gods and honor for their country. Han Ha-ri, can you do the same for this country, the Republic of Korea?”\n“Uhm…I don’t think I can…”\nIn Ha-ri generation patriotism seems to fade away with each passing day, and the idea of giving your life for your country seems like propaganda.\nThis is despite the fact that she has a strong sense of justice among her peers.\n“What’s the point of imitating them if you have no one to give glory and honor to?”\n“To give honor to…….”\nHa-ri was speechless at Leon’s words.\nThe training continued for a while and Leon sharply criticized every aspect of Ha-ri’s swordplay and stance, but she could feel herself improving in real time with each correction.\nHowever, strangely…Leon seemed weaker than ever.\n“That’s all for now, get some rest.”\n“Yes………”\nNormally, he would have said, “You should be honored to be under the tutelage of the Lionheart King, and be grateful for this good fortune,” but he turned away nonchalantly.\nOn Earth, Ha-ri, who had served with Leon the longest, could see the subtle difference.\n“Your Majesty, you look groggy.”\nThe normally dignified and jovial man had seemed somber since the Jeju Gate. She knew he was only human, but the more she thought about it, the more she wanted to do something to help.\n“His Majesty hasn’t been feeling well lately, what can I do?”\n-Huh?\nShe first consulted Sir Yakt Spinner, the brains of the pantheon.\nAs he poured salt into the soldiers’ meals, Yappy rolled his camera eye and let out a mechanical sound.\n-It must be a non-specific biological response to a stimulus applied to the organism.\n“Can’t you talk to me from my perspective?”\n-High stress level. Need to relieve stress.\n“Stress…that’s not a bad word.”\nSo what does it take to relieve stress?\n“Sir Yappy, do you know what his majesty enjoys doing?\n-His Majesty. 5 a.m. wake-up call. Four hours of training. Breakfast. Morning training instruction. Lunch. Afternoon training. Dinner. Late night prayer, followed by bed. Overall, not deviating from the routine.\n“You’re recording all of that……?”\n-Searching for information. Organisms, defining the concept of entertainment. Refers to a whole range of activities to make you feel good. Suitable for stress relief.\nIn short, they should entertain Leon.\n“I can’t imagine His Majesty playing…. What about Lord Yappy?”\n-……Organic dopamine-boosting entertainment does not count.\nWhy is it so hard to say you don’t know?\nHa-ri thought for a moment, and then an idea flashed through her mind.\n“Yes! That would be a good idea for His Majesty to enjoy, and the timing is perfect!”\n-Ha-ri?\n“There’s something at the Association I could use, I’ll have to contact them first.”\n-What plan?\nSlowly, Ha-ri explains the plan, and Yappy organizes the objective information, acknowledging that it is a reasonable conclusion.\n-A serendipitous turn of events for an organism. Not quite up to my computational capabilities.\n“Yeah, yeah, of course.”\nHa-ri shrugged and made a triumphant gesture.",

      "content": "Chapter 66: Stress Relief\nAfter Leon finished eating, he prayed at the altar.\nFor Leon, prayer is not just a time to recite his wishes and give thanks. He communicates with the gods, speaking directly to them and acting as their agent of will.\nHis prayers are always answered by the gods.\n[Leon, my knight, your goddess has waited for your prayer.]\n‘Arianna.’\nLeon posted his report for the day.\n‘Goddess. How are Lord Georgic and his men?\nThe souls of the knights and soldiers Leon had retrieved by remaining at the gate until the very end. The gods had welcomed them.\nIf they were delivered safely to paradise, he would not be too worried, but…….\n[Their souls were tainted by the evil things, and the gods themselves are purifying them and leading them to Paradise one by one.]\n‘That’s good.’\nLeon sighed in relief, and the goddess said.\n[My knight, you’ve been looking a little down lately.]\n‘Nothing to worry about, I’m just a little tired.’\n[Your goddess is very worried about you, Leon. You have served too long and fought too long.]\n‘I did what I had to do.’\n[There is nothing in the world that makes such a fight worthwhile, and your goddess is weighed down with debt.]\nLeon was pleased with Arianna’s concern, but he asked lightly, hoping to ease the goddess’ worries.\n‘Are the other gods like that?’\n[Hmm…they’re the same but lately they got involved with Iron in spreading our faith.]\n‘I’m relieved to see they have something to do.’\n[Come to think of it, Dream has something in store for you, and it must be conveyed through its priestess.]\nLeon seemed to know how Fle, the Goddess of Dreams and Death, would deliver the message.\nIf Fle was merely delivering a message, she could deliver it directly to Leon. But if it’s a prophecy, it’s a different story.\nFle is the goddess of death and the afterlife, but she also intervenes in dreams, making prophecies and showing fragments of the future.\nSuch prophecies are not taken lightly by the Lionheart King, as they are usually relayed through her priests.\n‘Something big is going to happen soon.’\n[My knight’s fatigue has reached its peak, and your goddess’s heart is heavy with the thought of carrying an even heavier burden.]\nFor a time the goddess spoke on behalf of the gods of the pantheon. Then Arianna said.\n[My knight, your service is pleasing to the gods, but even as a watcher, I have many concerns.]\n‘I apologize for causing you concern.’\n[Rest from your fatigue and enjoy some entertainment. You have been fighting for two hundred years without a break, and it is time for you to rest a little.]\n‘Entertainment…that’s a word I haven’t heard in a long time.’\n[Yes, there are many entertainments in this age, but I am not sure that my knight will find them enjoyable, however, there are some things that are immutable and supreme throughout the ages and the world.]\n‘Is there such a thing?’\n[Embracing a woman.]\n‘…….’\nLeon did not respond to the goddess’s words. Not exactly.\n[The queen is a fine mate, in your goddess’s opinion, and her beauty is admirable even for Love.]\n‘……Goddess.’\n[Or how about that redheaded girl, the one War has his eye on. If she keeps it up, she’ll be worthy of the Lionhearted King’s silver.]\n‘She is a young maiden. How can you say such a thing?’\n[By nature, humans are meant to embrace reason and resolve their misery. We must reestablish the royal family as soon as possible in order to honor the glorious name of the Lionheart King even here.]\nLeon shook his head and, for the first time in his life, ignored the goddess’ words. And then──\n“Your Majesty, Your Majesty, I have something for you──Uh-oh!”\nHa-ri stumbled on the threshold as he ran to Leon. What a disgraceful thing for a kid to do with superhuman physical abilities.\n“What is it?”\n“I have prepared something for your Majesty, with the advice and assistance of Lord Yappy.”\n“…….”\nHa-ri had conferred with Yappy and prepared something but Leon suddenly remembered the Big Data No. 1 maid’s outfit she had worn earlier as a maid’s outfit.\n“If you wear such a scandalous outfit again, I will make you do a handstand and spin around the whole neighborhood naked.”\n“What about my-my dignity?”\n“Have you prepared such clothes for me again?”\n“No, no, no!”\nHa-ri shook her head in denial.\n* * * *\nHa-ri said she had something for him, and they arrived at a Gate where staff from the Hunter’s Association was waiting for them.\n“Welcome, Your Majesty.”\nThe Hunter’s assault team, including Chief Kim Jin-soo, stood heavily armed, waiting for Leon.\n“What a surprise.”\n“Yes! Actually, we’ve gathered here as a reward for your Majesty from the Association, in support of Deputy Han Ha-ri, who organized this event!”\n“Hmm?”\nOrganized? What does that even mean? Leon didn’t know much about it, since Ha-ri had brought him here as a surprise.\nTo be honest, he’d only come because he thought it wouldn’t be a sham if Yappy cooperated as well…….\n“Let’s enter the gate!”\nHa-ri walked through the gate, which opened onto a vast forest.\n“What is this place?”\n“This is a training gate managed by the Association.”\nThe Association maintains several gates for training and business purposes.\nLike the gate at Seoul Station, there were several gates that were not only used to test Hunters’ ratings, but also to train their own raiding teams.\nOne of them was reserved for Leon.\n“I’m going to introduce you to the gate now, “she said, “The characteristic of this gate is an area called Suhae, where various flora, fauna and monsters appear.”\nSince the gate is only green, there are no dangerous monsters. The Association also visits it for adaptation training, and most importantly, herbs that only grow here are regenerated.\n“One point for small animals, three points for medium ones, and ten points for the occasional orc!”\n“Hmm…In short, hunting.”\n“Yep. It’s a recurring gate that regenerates over time anyway, so don’t worry about it, just hunt as long as you want!”\nLeon knew why Ha-ri had brought him here. It was a hunt.\n“I was only guessing, but I thought hunting might be in vogue where your Majesty lives.”\n“So you’ve set up a hunting ground for this king?”\nHow could she think such a thing?\nLeon knew what Ha-ri’s intentions were. He hid it well, but his gloomy demeanor must have shown in the child’s eyes. Then again, the goddess had told him to rest.\n“Hunting…hunting…….”\nAs Ha-ri suspected, hunting is a favorite pastime of knights and nobles in the Lionheart Kingdom but it has been 200 years since he last hunted.\nThey refine their bodies, win the competition in style, and offer their victories to the gods.\nIt’s a noble virtue to enjoy the thrill of the hunt, even if the countless wars against demons have left them little time for it.\n“They’re hunters, aren’t they? They’re carrying instruments.”\nThe heavily armed hunters would enter the field with these loud instruments to herd and drive their prey.\nYes, a hunt must have a leader to make it fun.\nLeon smirked and turned to Ha-ri.\n“Did you say there are orcs?”\n“Yes! That’s why we’re all fully armed!”\n“Let’s go.”\nLeon spurred his horse into a gallop, and the Association hunters began to cackle loudly.\n* * * *\nThe Clawed Tribe are forest orcs who live in the forest and lead a peaceful, hunter-gatherer lifestyle.\nThey worship the forest gods, offering sacrifices to them and claiming to be the stewards of the forest.\n-Aaahhhh!\nA scream echoes through the dense forest as a rumbling laugh bursts from him.\n“Kahahaha! You damned big axes, you dare to hunt on our territory? As we haven’t had enough game lately, one of your biceps would be enough for a meal!”\n“Skin their faces first, we need to sacrifice their skulls to the gods!”\nThey are hunting the same tribe of orcs since they’ve recently been engaged in a bloody war of attrition with other orc tribes over territory in the forest.\nThe Forest Orcs, who are few in number, could have chosen to coexist with each other, but they choose to fight.\nThere is no coexistence between them, only battle and killing to enforce their wishes.\n-Dag-dag-dag-dag!\n“Hmm? What’s that sound?”\n“It’s the sound of a boar running and a rather large…….”\nThe moment the Clawed Tribe Orc hunters craned their heads in the direction of the sound, a huge presence burst out.\n“Huh?”\nA white steed and a spear with delicate and exquisite engravings that couldn’t be compared to the crude things of the forest, it was──\n-Eh!\nIt pierced the Forest Orc’s heart.\n-What!\n-Intruder!\nScreams erupted from the orcs as a knight appeared from nowhere and hunted them down.\n“Hahahahahaha! I guess there’s something to be said for hunting instead of fighting.”\n“Who are you, you!”\n“Human! How dare you kill a member of our tribe?”\n“Kill him!”\nThe Forest Orcs charged, but their opponent was a Grail Guardian, the pinnacle of Holy Knights and the orcs, no more than forty in all, were swept aside.\n“Run!”\n“Monster! Run!”\nThe orcs tried to flee into the forest, realizing the battle was one-sided. As long as he was alone and using melee weapons, he wouldn’t be able to hunt down the entire tribe after all.\n-Snap!\n“Thud!”\nA fleeing orc fell to the ground as an arrow pierced his neck.\n“Barzah, what?!”\nOne after another, the orcs fell to the ground, their thick hides able to withstand most of the arrows, but the skill of the bowman was too much for them, and they fell to the ground.\nWith only a few of the tribal orcs able to escape into the forest, Leon dismounted.\n“If you’ve hunted, you should take the mark.”\nLeon pulled out a molar from a decapitated orc and put it in his pocket. The pouch was already full of orc molars.\n“Mmmm…….”\nHa-ri, who had followed him to the carnage, dismounted and smiled awkwardly.\n“You’re a good archer, aren’t you?”\nAs Ha-ri remembers, Leon is a notorious range hater in the Association, which is why she didn’t bring a bow and arrow for this hunt.\nHowever, after Leon wiped out the first group of orcs, he took the orc hunter’s bow and arrow and used it to hunt the orcs. And for a man who despises ranged weapons, he shot surprisingly well with the bow.\n“You’re mistaken. Just because you’re a knight doesn’t mean you can’t use ranged weapons.”\n“Is that… true?”\n“Hunting is a nobleman’s virtue and pastime, how can it be done only with spears and swords?”\nKnights, especially those who travel a lot, must provide for themselves in the wilderness so they had no choice but to become masters of hunting, and of course they shot bows and arrows.\n“The bow is a weak weapon for killing monsters, but it’s good enough for killing prey.”\n“You… have a point, but this… you’re a really good marksman.”\nLeon chuckled at Ha-ri’s honest admiration.\n“This king was famous for being the greatest tournament champion of all time, but he was also the second-best hunter of his time, and he won the occasional hunting contest.”\n“Your Majesty was the second, so the first was another Holy Knight?”\n“Hmm, it is ambiguous to call him a Holy Knight. He was favored by the Moon and the Goddess of the Hunt, but he was more of a hunter than a knight.”\nLeon remembered a memory from the past. When the kingdom was still at peace, before the demons invaded.\nThe kingdom’s greatest knights and nobles had traveled to a tournament to showcase their prowess.\n“The High Priestess of the Moon and the Hunt was a saint, and her bow was like a meteor, which, when drawn to its fullest, would have cleared a mountain ridge.”\n“…”\nIt was an outrageous thing to say but Ha-ri knew well what those favored by the gods were capable of.\nSplitting a giant bear over fifty meters long or wiping out hundreds of demons in a single strike. And it was clear from the Jeju Island Gate that someone with this much power was classified as a ‘Holy Knight’, not even a peak level.\n“But… did you really have to hunt only orcs like this?”\n“I apologize for that. But how can we hunt rabbits when there are bears in the forest, and if we want to win first place in the tournament, we have to go after the big game.”\nHe looked at the orcs like they were his prey and Ha-ri smiled bitterly.\n“There’s the chieftain’s corpse, and judging by the witchcraft, he must have some good stuff.”\n“Ah, indeed. It’s a shaman’s totem. It’s not a common drop.”\n“Sell it and give it to one of the employees who acted as a peddler.”\n“Eh? What, you don’t mind? It’s a pretty good one, it’ll cost around 100 million.”\n“It’ll be a small price to pay for all those people who came here on their off days.”\n“Ugh!”\nHa-ri coughed at the bluntness of the expression since she just asked the Association for a gate to serve as a hunting ground for Leon, nothing more.\nThe mobilization of workers in the middle of their workday was a mandate from higher ups in the Association to look good for Leon.\nIt’s easy to mobilize subordinates anywhere and for their organization to look good to Leon, but it’s a sin to have salaried workers sweating and struggling at the gate.\n“By the way, the footprints of the fleeing orcs lead here.”\n“More hunting? According to the mapped information, you’ve crushed a bunch of orcs…….”\n“Yes. The beasts pollute the forest with their breath, and I cannot allow that to continue. Orcs must be slain, even if they are fake.”\n“Hah…….”\nLeon handed the orc’s bow and quiver to Ha-ri, who sighed.\n“You’re going to have to be good at everything if you want to be a knight. Today, practice your bow.”\n“Uhm…I’ve only used a bow in the academy, on the aptitude test.”\nHa-ri feels awkward about her lack of skill but Leon patted her on the shoulder and laughed.\n“I can teach you the basics.”\n“Is that so?”\nHa-ri smiled weakly at Leon’s words.\n“I’m glad you’re feeling better, though.”\n“…….”\nAnyone who sat on a throne would receive offerings of jesters and treasures to have his mood checked.\nIt was a routine that he remembers always treating mechanically but Ha-ri did this purely to cheer himself up. There was no aspiration or desire in it.\n“Well, that’s nice.”\n“What, I didn’t hear you right?”\n“I want you to kill at least three orcs, and if you don’t, I’ll show you the old ways.”\n“Old ways?! I haven’t shot that bow many times, lord!”\nLeon reined in his horse and Ha-ri hurried after him.\n* * * *\nA few days later, Ha-ri strolled the grounds of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild, smiling from ear to ear.\nAfter that day’s hunt, Leon was in good spirits and Ha-ri’s plan had been quite successful.\n“Deputy.”\n“Ah, Chief!”\nOn her way to the warehouse to pick up her training wooden sword, Ha-ri spotted Chief Kim Jin-soo, an employee of the Association.\n“What are you doing here, I thought you went to collect the harvested rice from the rice warehouse.”\n“My tractor broke down. I came to pick up some supplies.”\n“It breaks down often. Is it because it’s an old machine?”\n“Well, it hasn’t been taken out since the Naju plains were contaminated with miasma, so it must be poorly maintained.”\n“If this is the case, wouldn’t it be better to use horses or cows like in the old days?” Ha-ri blurted out her thoughts.\n“……might be right.”\n“What?”\n“No, when the king blesses them, they’re almost like new horses, right? I heard that the horses we bought from Jeju Island ran much better than before after the blessing ceremony.”\nIndeed. The horses purchased at the Jeju Gate were reinforced with the Sun King’s reins and the gap between the two became so huge that even one horse is enough to take over the world horse racing market.\n“It’s made them a little unruly too…”\n“Well, the hunters are superhuman, so I guess that balances out.”\nThey arrived at the warehouse, chatting away. Every time Ha-ri stopped here, she cleared her mind and said a prayer.\nThis is where the hammer left by the Grail Knight, Sir Georgic, is stored.\n“Holy Fire…….”\n“According to the doctrine of the Ten Thousand Gods, wouldn’t your Buddhist and Christian prayers be blasphemy?”\nKim Jin-soo draws a holy symbol and scolds Ha-ri. The two opened the warehouse door and──\n“……?”\n“Huh?”\nThere was no sign of Sir Georgic’s hammer anywhere in the warehouse.",

      "content": "Chapter 67: Georgic Hammer\nThe Ten Thousand Gods Guild (I’ll shorten it to TTG Guild) headquarters is located in the middle of a wide valley surrounded by five mountains.\nIt’s not too far from the city, but it’s not easy to access either. Sometimes golfers who use the nearby golf course see it.\nUntil recently, it was contaminated by miasma and some roads were blocked.\nRecently, the Shrine of the Goddess of Life and Abundance was built and the TTG Guild headquarters moved in, so some hunters and related people visited.\nBut lately, the TTG Guild headquarters has become quite a hot place. Mostly thanks to hunters and tourists who watch them.\n“Yes, number 59! Mr. Han Jin-soo, an A-class hunter from the Matrix Guild!”\nAt the entrance of the headquarters a burly man walks up from the front of the line.\nHan Jin-soo, famous for being an iron wall tanker, had muscles and was over 2m tall.\nHa-ri swallowed her saliva as she saw the huge Han Jin-soo casting a shadow and carefully handed him the microphone.\n“Mr. Han Jin-soo! How do you feel as a challenger?”\n“What do you mean how do I feel? Can I really take this hammer if I lift it?”\nHan Jin-soo’s eyes were on the big one-handed hammer. All the challengers looked at it with greedy eyes and tourists were filming it, wondering if it would succeed this time.\nIf he’s such a powerful hunter, he might be able to lift that hammer that looks a bit heavy…\nNo, but no hunter has been able to lift that hammer so far. It was because the hammer was so heavy that even the self-proclaimed hunters couldn’t lift it.\nBut Han Jin-soo overlapped his palms on the handle of the hammer and grinned.\n‘I have a unique skill <Weight Conversion>. No weight is a problem for me!’\nAs soon as he activated his unique skill, Han Jin-soo tried to lift the hammer lightly. But…\n“Huh?”\nIt doesn’t budge. Even though he reduced the weight of the hammer to almost 0 kg with weight conversion, the hammer didn’t move as if it was stuck to the ground.\n“If you can’t do it, move on quickly. There are a lot of people waiting.”\n“No, not yet!”\nHan Jin-soo now pulled the hammer with all his strength. He squeezed out all his strength from his feet to his milk-drinking strength.\nBut in the end, the hammer didn’t budge at all, and neither did anyone else.\nThis whole situation goes back to a week ago.\n“Your Majesty! Your Majesty! It’s a big deal!”\nOn his way to have lunch with Beatrice, Ha-ri ran up with Kim Jin-soo.\n“Tsk, don’t be rude. How can a maid act so lightly.”\n“That’s sexist… Anyway! It’s a big deal!”\n“What’s going on?”\nWhen Leon asked with a faint sigh, Ha-ri quickly reported the situation.\n“Georgic hammer disappeared from the warehouse!”\n“The hammer is gone?”\n“Yes! I went in with Mr. Kim Jin-soo today and it suddenly disappeared… It must have been stolen!”\n“That can’t be.”\n“Uh… But it really disappeared?”\n“That hammer can’t be held by anyone who isn’t qualified. If it disappeared, it wasn’t theft by necessity, but something the hammer decided for itself.”\n“…”\nDoes that make sense?\nHa-ri swallowed the question that was about to come out of her mouth.\nYeah, whatever this person says, it makes sense. Even if not, there’s no need to get scolded by picking a fight.\n“I feel the energy close by. Let’s go that way.”\nLeon took the lead and Ha-ri and the Queen followed.\nSurprisingly, the hammer that had disappeared was in the middle of the TTG Guild building.\n“What is this?”\n“I don’t know, it doesn’t budge.”\n“Who brought it here?”\nThe hammer in the middle of the training ground attracted the attention of the trainees and cadets.\nIt’s inevitable that it would catch your eye even if you don’t like it when it’s there.\n“What is the intention of this?”\nLeon stared at the holy hammer stuck in the ground. The hammer that didn’t budge even when the cadets grabbed it was easily lifted up by Leon’s hand.\nBut that was only for a moment. The hammer moved by itself as if drawn by a magnet and soon escaped from Leon’s hand and stuck back to the ground.\n“Oh my~ It’s a hammer with a strong self-expression.”\n“…It seems to have something it wishes for.”\nHa-ri chuckled at Leon’s guess.\n“Does the hammer have a will?”\n“Sometimes they do if they are holy relics. Especially if they have been with a saint for a long time, they become temperamental.”\nHoly relics are objects that have been touched by a saint and blessed by him. Especially the weapons of the Holy Knights have both blessing (holy) and star energy (star).\nThe holy relics exposed to the most high-dimensional energy in the world sometimes have their own will. It can be called egoization.\n“However, I didn’t feel such a will when I fought with Georgic.”\nLeon remembered Georgic declaration before handing over this hammer.\n「I swear allegiance to the Lionheart King and receive Demera’s recognition! Through this hammer, you will inherit Georgic power!!」\nIt was an oath he made with his soul. It is no exaggeration to say that this hammer contains the will of a Holy Knight.\nThat is, the hammer wants to fulfill Georgic oath.\n“I see. You want me to find you a master.”\nLeon snickered and threw the hammer behind him.\n“Leave it alone. And let the Association know.”\n“What should I tell them?”\n“Whoever holds the hammer, I’ll give them this hammer no matter who they are.”\nLeon’s declaration was immediately conveyed to the Association through Ha-ri.\n[Is it a reward item for clearing the gate?]\n“It’s a little different.”\n[Wait. I’ll send an appraiser first.]\nThe appraiser sent by the Association examined the immovable hammer and screamed in less than 10 seconds.\n“Waaaaaah! What is this!!”\n“Why, why are you like that?!”\nThe employee sent as an appraiser, Lee Chan-soo, trembled as if he couldn’t believe what he saw.\n“Eh, epic…!”\n“Epic?!” After the Great Cataclysm, items were classified into normal, rare, unique and legendary.\nBasically, fine products made by blacksmiths called master craftsmen are unique. Legendary items are made with countless resources and painstaking efforts.\nLegendary items are usually made by a fate-like luck of one in ten million.\nThe probability is so astronomical that usually legendary items are dropped items from gates.\nBut there were items called ‘epic’ in 30 years of history.\nThe Heavenly Demon’s Breaking Heaven Sword, the owner of the Ten Thousand Mountains of the Continent.\nThe staff of the founder of the World Magic Tower and the Twelve Rings that are said to open up heaven and earth.\nThe heart of the Frost Queen who is still swallowing and expanding Siberia.\nThe wandering magic sword that wanders around the world after the Black Gate London incident.\nThe criterion for classifying epic items is simple.\nThis item has such a powerful force that it can shake the situation of the battlefield. There was no gate capture that failed with epic items mobilized so far.\nEpic items were extraordinary items that overturned common sense, so much so that national efforts were added when epic items appeared.\nAnd now such an epic item was in front of Lee Chan-soo.\n“Are you, really? Do you really just give it to me if I just hold it? Is that really true?”\n“Uh, um … yes. That will … be?”\nHa-ri, who couldn’t even imagine that the hammer in front of her was an epic item, blinked her eyes and wondered if she should get confirmation from Leon right now──\n“That’s right. Whoever holds that hammer will be the owner of the hammer.”\n“Your Majesty, this hammer is worth a lot. Look at this!”\nLee Chan-soo organized the ability table he had organized.\n[Georgic One-Handed Hammer]\n◆ Grade: Epic\n◆ Details\nIt is a sacred hammer (聖槌) blessed by Georgic, the Holy Knight of Demera, the goddess of life and abundance.\nCore of Faith: Receive divine power directly from Demera.\nPerfect Vitality: You don’t get tired.\nGoddess’s Blessing: Defense increases by 400% while standing on the ground. Recovery increases by 300%. Defense 200%, recovery 150% are applied to all subordinate legions.\nSaintization: Implement holy laws according to faith and divine power.\nEmotionless: Georgic’s──────\nEmotionless: Existence of────────\n“Huhuk…….”\nHa-ri glanced at him and made a strange tongue sound. This is because she had never seen such absurd abilities but Leon’s choice did not change.\nThis news was soon made public through the Association──\n[The first in Korea and the third epic item in Asia revealed at TTG Guild headquarters. Anyone can take it.]\nThe reason why so many challengers flocked was because of this.\n****\n“Heheh, is this the place?”\n“Let’s see the epic item!”\nThe first to visit the headquarters after Georgic hammer was featured was a small and medium-sized hunter guild nearby.\nA shocking condition that anyone can take as long as they can carry it.\nThe hunters who were greedy for the epic item put everything aside and entered TTG Guild.\nThe moment they tried to enter the TTG Guild headquarters──\n-Squeak\nThey came face to face with the Yacht Spinner guarding the entrance\n“Ya, Yacht Spinner?!”\nThe nightmare of Cheongju Gate and the killing machine, who annihilated numerous attack teams, is a survivor as famous as Leon.\nEven if its size has shrunk now, they can’t help but panic when there is a killing machine estimated to be S-class or higher in front of them.\n“What, what?”\n-Hammer challenger?\n“That’s right.”\n-Welcome.\n“Tha, thank you.”\nThe hunters were awkward by the softer response than expected from this killing machine and tried to enter the headquarters.\nBut at that moment, a fierce wire whip slammed down in front of them with a bang!\n“Why, why why?!”\n-Entrance fee.\n“Huh?”\n-Entrance fee.\nWhen repeated twice, the hunters also understood Yappy words.\n“No, what entrance fee do you mean…….?”\n“I didn’t hear that…….”\n-Decided today.\nYappy mechanical legs lifted slightly and pointed to a big sign.\n[Sanctuary Entrance Fee Hunter: 5 million won. Civilian: 500,000 won.]\n“Expensive…….”\n“No, why are we 5 million won when civilians are 500,000 won!”\n-Civilian viewing. Hunter challenge. Additional cost of managing relics.\nThey couldn’t turn back here either. In fact, considering the value of an epic item, 5 million won was nothing, so the hunters opened their wallets reluctantly.\n“……Is five-star pay possible?”\n-Account transfer is possible.\nAfter paying the expensive entrance fee and entering, the hunters met Han Ha-ri who was waiting.\n“Welcome, hunters! I’m Han Ha-ri, the deputy of the management department 3 of the Korean Hunter Association!”\nHa-ri, dressed in a cool outfit, greeted the hunters with a bright smile. They were impressed by the fact that last year’s rookie came to meet them, but they also wanted to see the relic as soon as possible.\n“Where is Georgic hammer? I want to see the real thing quickly.”\n“Hey! Be careful with your expression!”\n“Huh?”\nHa-ri pointed out with a fuss as the hunter looked puzzled.\n“It’s ‘sir’ Georgic. You have to use honorifics when you call the names of noble people here!”\n“???”\nIt’s an item.\nBut when in Rome, do as the Romans do. It was a well-known fact that Leon, the knight king of the otherworld, had a crazy personality.\nThe hunters coughed and corrected their names.\n“I want to challenge ‘sir’ Georgic hammer…”\n“Before that! Let’s go to the altar and pray first!”\n“…What?”\nThe place they followed Ha-ri’s incomprehensible guide was the altar of the TTG Guild, which was separately arranged in the TTG Guild office building.\nThere are altars of Demera, the goddess of life and abundance, who is the object of faith for farmers, and altars of TTG Guild gods separately.\nThe altar is not so grand, and it looks like a temporary altar until a proper temple is built.\n-Squeak\n“It’s here again.”\nYappy showed up. The mechanical spider that went back and forth between the altars stood in front of the hunters who had been ripped off by 5 million won each.\n-Bow down. Bow down to the gods of the TTG Guild.\n“Uh, um…”\nThe hunters glanced at Yappy and reluctantly bowed down. They wondered if they had to bow down to each god’s altar, but it seemed to be enough once.\n-Will you pay tribute?\n“No, what do you want me to pay again…?”\n-You don’t have to.\nIt seemed like Yappy would force them to pay something, but he answered coolly and the hunters hesitated for a moment and refused to pay tribute.\nSome of them were Christians and even refused to bow down at the altar.\nThe place they barely entered was the closed and moved old training ground site. As soon as they entered there, the hunters felt an unknown energy wrap around them.\n“Oh, oh…”\n“What is this? What is this energy…?”\nIt was a warm and soft energy. It made their whole body feel alive, their mind clear, and their vision clear.\nThey quickly realized what caused this mysterious experience.\n“It’s the energy flowing from the hammer…”\n“Just by being there, this energy flows out…”\n“It’s an epic item after all…!”\nThe hunters who were exposed to the hammer’s energy felt that it was worth 5 million won just for this.\n“Here! This hammer is ‘sir’ Georgic hammer! Would you like to try it first, hunter Kim Ho-yeol?”\nThe hunter who was called by Ha-ri swallowed his saliva and approached the hammer. He was a Christian and a devout believer who refused to bow down at the altar just before.\n“Then I’ll try it──”\nIt was the moment he grabbed the hammer.\n-Zap!\n“Aargh!!”\nKim Ho-yeol was bounced off by the energy generated from the hammer handle.\n“Wha, what!”\n“Energy from the hammer?!”\nThe hunters supported Kim Ho-yeol who bounced off and looked at the energy swirling from the hammer. The fierce growling energy was evidence that the hammer rejected Kim Ho-yeol.\n“The hammer does such things?”\n“Oh, I forgot to warn you. If you are not qualified…it rejects you like that.”\n“Disqualified? You should have told me that earlier!”\nThe hunters asked her, but Ha-ri had nothing to say.\n“There is no… standard. It’s just up to the hammer.”\nWhat do you want me to do about it when the hammer does that?\n“Damn! I’ll try it this time!”\nThe one who stepped forward was a giant hunter. Tanker-type hunters are big, but he was among the muscular ones. And as he wore heavy armor and a shield, he was confident in his strength.\nFortunately, the hammer did not bounce him off like the previous hunter. He, an atheist, grabbed the handle of the hammer and tried to lift it up in one breath.\n“Krrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!”\nBut the hammer did not budge at all. It was too heavy, as if thousands of tons of iron were compressed.\n“Kraah! Damn it!”\nAfter that, several hunters challenged. There were some who bounced off completely, but most of them passed until they grabbed the handle. But that was it. No one could move the hammer even 1mm.\nAs the fallen hunters gasped and sweated, Yapppy approached.\n“What, what?”\n-Will you pay tribute?\nWhy do you want me to pay tribute again? The hunters frowned, but one hunter’s eyes sparkled.\n“The relic of God… Yeah, that’s it!”\nThe hunter approached Yapppy and paid about 10 million won in tribute by bank transfer. And he grabbed the hammer and──\n-Creak!\nThe hammer that didn’t budge at all moved 0.05mm…for a very short moment.\n“Huh?”\n“What?”\n“He just moved… He couldn’t move it at all before…”\nDid he move because he paid tribute?\nEveryone’s eyes turned to Yappy.\n-TTG altar temple construction tribute received.\nEveryone took out bundles of money.\nYappy analyzed the activation of the commercial area of various religious sites by big data through a series of processes.\n-The hammer makes money.\n“‘Sir’ Yappy, is this really okay? Isn’t this blasphemy?”\nHa-ri asked with a worried expression, but Yappy calmly answered.\n-Questioning my efficient asset management skills with the intellectual abilities of insignificant organic matter? You just have to do as I plan.\nHa-ri read the plans that Yappy printed out in an instant.\n“…Providing health promotion seats with exposure to the sacred power of the hammer?”\n-Attracting general visitors. Activating the surrounding commercial area.\n“Providing blessed crops to visitors and forcing tribute…”\n-‘Voluntary’ tribute.\n“Using hunters as labor under the pretext of faith promotion?!”\n-Labor activity with physical training. Efficient.\n“How are you going to pay them?”\n-Why pay trainees? Provide meals, sleeping places, cooking, and necessities.\n“No, ‘sir’ Yappy…There is a noble law called labor law in the world…”\n-Trainees registered as interns. Interns can be paid below minimum wage.\n“I’ve never seen you pay even a little money?!”\n-‘Voluntary donation’ recovered. If you don’t like it, leave.\n“Cruel…”\nThe plan of Yappy, the financial manager of TTG Guild, was just beginning.",

      "content": "Chapter 68: Perfect Calculations, Fateful Victories\nIt was not only the hunters who came to the TTG Guild headquarters to see the hammer.\n“This is the TTG Guild headquarters.”\n“Oh my, really? The one that’s famous for rice and a new religion these days?”\n“Of course. My cousin ate their rice and cured her cancer.”\nTTG Guild, which had already built a good image with blessed crops and YouTube, was becoming a temple of that kind of religion that people knew.\nThere was no formal religious activity yet, but this time it was different.\nThe hammer of Georgic, which was revealed to have been obtained from the gate, was a relic itself and had the power of earth and abundance.\nA powerful relic was no different from a saint. This was what the trainees under Leon’s command felt, as they gradually became healthier and more muscular, and their bodies improved overall after the hammer came in.\nThe occasion was when Kim Do-han, the team leader who had entrusted his dementia mother to a nurse, brought her over for a while due to the remodeling of the nursing facility.\nWhen a soldier asked if he could bring his sick mother for a while, Leon kindly allowed him, and Kim Do-han gratefully brought her to the TTG Guild headquarters for a while. And then──\n“Oh my, Do-han!”\n“Huh, mom! Do you recognize me?!”\nShe recovered from dementia.\n“Oh my son! You’ve been through a lot because of mom.”\n“Sniff… Sob sob sob…!”\nKim Do-han, who had seen his mother suffer from dementia for over five years, prostrated himself in front of the relic.\nThis story, Yappy filmed it from beginning to end.\n[K-TTG Guild headquarters where a dementia patient’s eyes opened]\n-Stop lying even if it’s bullshit. (This comment has been deleted)\n-No, what kind of bullshit is this──(This comment has been deleted)\n-This could be true. Our uncle who had terminal cancer got better after eating TTG Guild rice that we got with difficulty. (Like 3,565)\n-What is this? The number of likes is over 5,000 in no time\n-I went to the golf course and saw the TTG Guild headquarters from afar, and the wi-fi connected automatically? But it was over 1km away, how did it work?\nIt was a hard-to-believe story, but with the video and the story of blessed rice spreading, visitors flocked with the thought that it would be worth believing.\nYappy initially rejected them.\n-NO. Only TTG believers can visit except challengers.\n“Oh, no… I came all this way and you have to let me in once…\n-Trespassing on private property. Advised to withdraw.\nThe machine blocked them without an inch of gap. And then, as if he had been waiting for it, Han Ha-ri appeared.\n“Excuse me, sir Yappy.”\n-Kiruk?\n“Aren’t these people actually here to worship at TTG headquarters?”\n“Huh? No, what are you talking about…?”\n“Wait, just stay still.”\nThe visitor kept quiet at Yappy’s restraint but Ha-ri clapped her hands and said.\n“There are many gods in the TTG Pantheon. How about getting to know them while making small donations, praying… and seeing the relics?”\n-Makes sense.\nYappy nodded at Ha-ri’s words and moved the camera eye. The visitors realized it then.\n“Well, then! I was thinking of making a donation!”\n“Let’s see, here, is this enough?”\nOne visitor handed over a blue bill. Yappy looked at it and threw it away.\n-Lack of faith.\n“…”\nThe visitors had to deposit hundreds of thousands of won before they could enter.\n“Is this right? No, what kind of religious worship is this that forces you to donate and doesn’t accept less than 500,000 won?”\n“This is totally a cult──”\n-Zap!\nA creepy wire line grazed the visitors’ clothes.\n-Don’t swear. I understand Korean.\n“…Yes.”\nThe visitors met a villager who worked as a servant in front of the temporary altar of the TTG.\n“Oh my, hello. Did you come to worship at the altar?”\n“Uh, um… yes?”\n“New believers are always welcome. Would you like to see the guide of the Ten Thousand Gods made by our village?”\n“There’s such a thing?”\n“Of course.”\nThe first thing the villager handed over was the spirit and teachings of Demera, the goddess of life and abundance.\nThe spirit of life and abundance.\nMake an image of the goddess with the first harvested crop and offer it to the altar. Don’t pee in the field. Fertilizer is fine. Set up a scarecrow and put on a hat and clothes. Sing when you harvest. A song with gratitude for the goddess is better. Don’t starve yourself even if you’re busy. …\n…\nThe most important 0th.\n※Frostbitten die.\n“Good words.”\n“What is frostbitten die…?”\nIt was somewhat unfamiliar, but still, it was mostly good words written because it was a religious guide.\nThe visitors went through the altar worship, singing praises to Leon Dragonia Lionheart, shouting “Devil die”, buying souvenirs (made by Yappy), and finally entered the training ground where the relic was enshrined.\n“What is this, why is it in such a place if the relic is enshrined…”\nAs soon as they entered the training ground, they saw the relic.\nA huge one-handed hammer was standing proudly in the middle of the barren training ground and the energy flowing from its noble existence made them feel refreshed and energized as their mind became clear.\n“Huh? Huh?!”\n“What, what’s wrong?”\n“Oh, no…my, my eyes.”\n“Your eyes what?”\nIt was a young man wearing glasses. He had such bad eyesight that he received a 4th grade rating and went to public service.\nBut now, as his vision became strangely blurry and he took off his glasses, a world he had never seen before unfolded.\nThe modern people wear glasses more and more because of smartphones but the moment he perceived the world clearly with his bare eyes the young man shed tears.\n“Oh God… thank you──”\n-Zap!\n“Long live Arianna! Thank you for curing my eyes!!!”\nAnother young man became a believer of the Ten Thousand Gods.\n-There is an envelope for donations for the expansion of the altar facilities. Prove your faith.\n“Uh, uh, then! I have 200,000 won right now…will that be okay?”\nHe had escaped from being a visually impaired person recognized by the state and was willing to give up his liver and gallbladder right now.\n-That’s fine. Faith is not proven by the size of the offering.\n“Oh, sir Yappy…you are a Holy Knight of the God of Iron and Blacksmithing…”\nThe young man, who had handed over a 10,000 won bill at the entrance and got cut off, prostrated himself in front of Yappy and bowed.\nAnd so──\nPatients from all over the place who came with the thought that it would be worth it and those who experienced miracles with the combination of relics and blessed crops became believers.\nWith these people gathering the TTG headquarters became a hot place where even foreigners came from Naju, where there was no time to find a tourist spot.\n“Sir Yappy! Starbucks wants to enter here!”\n-Show me the amount of donation and decide.\n“Sir Yappy! Cherry Co., a training facility development company for hunters, said they would build a training facility for us in exchange for advertising! Our TTG Guild is modernizing too!\n-Tell them to donate first.\n“Oh my! The governor said he would deliver a plaque of appreciation! He also wants to consult on blessed crops!\n-Tell him I’ll meet him if he promises budget support.\nYakt Spinner, a strong artificial intelligence killing machine and a Holy Knight of Heto, the God of Iron and Blacksmithing of TTG Guild ruthlessly secured money and goods under the premise of securing funds and expanding his reputation.\nWhat did he do with the budget he secured like this?\n“Wow…Sir Yappy, what is this?”\n-High-strength forging facility.\nWhat was in front of Ha-ri was a huge metallurgical facility located in the corner of TTG Guild headquarters and it had a design that seemed more futuristic than modern.\n“Sir Yappy…is this really a blacksmith shop?”\n-The lowest level forging facility in my database. This is the limit with the earth’s poor metallurgy level.\n“Well… it still looks amazing though?”\n-That’s because you have an organic level brain.\n“That’s mean!”\nHa-ri made a pouty sound, but still sent a hopeful look as she saw an impressive level of blacksmith shop in front of her.\n“Uh, Sir Yappy is a Holy Knight of the God of Iron and Blacksmithing, right?”\n-That’s right.\n“Then, can you make my sword here too?”\n-Impossible.\n“Heeeng… I guess so.”\nHa-ri was technically an outsider. She should be grateful enough to receive TTG Guild knight benefits as an Association member. But Yappy’s refusal was not for that reason.\n-This forging facility is not complete. Additional facilities are needed for Adamantite polishing.\n“Oh, is that so?”\n-To do that, more money is needed.\nYappy said that and went into the forging facility.\nThe building size was about two-story building level, but the entrance was only big enough for Yappy to barely fit in, so there was no way to know what was going on inside.\n-Minimum forging protocol initiated. Seed money secured. Analyzing international situations.\nYappy accessed the global stock exchange via self-developed wireless internet sharing wifi-100Gbps installed at TTG Guild headquarters.\nThe global stock market has been hit by a major disaster recently.\nFrom some point on, someone who joined in on stocks that soared due to price manipulation operations messed up their selling timing and quietly made profits and left.\nThe so-called righteous stock thief.\nThe identity of this whale of the stock market, who was not caught at all and even evaluated as a ghost or a group, was none other than Yappy.\nYappy hacked into the world network and mercilessly trampled on corrupt politicians, media, and businessmen who intervened for price manipulation, and manipulated information to his advantage.\nHe messed up their selling timing, buying timing, and dumped large amounts of stocks that rose due to operations and got out.\n-You bastard! Why! Why are there so many opposite articles at this time!\n-You son of a bitch, can’t you do it right? How much money did I give you for that little news manipulation!\n-What? Wait! A blackout at this timing? No! Cell phones too? Satellite communication is jammed too? This is nonsense!\nThis phenomenon, which happened all over the world, also attracted attention from the financial sector. The pattern was too similar.\nNo matter how different the methods were, the price manipulation forces suffered terrible damage and someone who caught the selling timing made a decent profit and got out.\nIs this possible?\nWhy would a force that can hack into the world network and jam satellite communications bother with price manipulation forces?\nYappy collected enough data and accumulated experience and now planned to move on to bigger profits.\nThe financial item that Yappy was eyeing was food.\nThe food situation of the 21st century humanity was not good at all.\nFirst of all, there are too many places contaminated by miasma. At the beginning of the Cataclysm, the Western powers and East Asia dealt with it exemplarily.\nThey closed the gate, encouraged hunters to grow large guilds, and built a system that could cope with red gates as well as variables like black gates.\nThe downside was that they were swayed by large guilds, but anyway, it was exemplary in terms of security.\nBut poor Eastern European countries, rigid Middle East Asia, and backward countries that had no time to nurture hunters experienced dungeon breaks that burst out of nowhere.\nWhat’s the problem with dungeon breaks? First of all, there is human damage caused by monsters.\nBut that’s ultimately a secondary problem. The problem is that the land is contaminated by miasma.\nAs you can see from the case of Hunan Plain and Naju Plain, land contaminated by miasma is a huge problem that threatens survival. Of course, the value of the land is infinitely close to zero.\nYappy bought this contaminated land. The first target was Beida Huang Grain Field in Heilong People’s Republic in northern East Asia.\n20 years ago, after the Shanghai Incident, one of the 50 independent factions that were torn apart, this place’s miasma contamination was serious.\nAlmost half of the land was contaminated and he bought some of it to spread the faith of Demera, the goddess of life and abundance, and started purification work.\nLarge-scale purification and immediate food production at Leon’s level were impossible, but still, thanks to prayers and accumulating faith, the contaminated land recovered greatly.\nNow all he had to do was harvest the food and it would turn into a grain field worth a fortune with “blessed rice, corn, barley” and so on.\nThe expected profit is a whopping tens of millions of dollars. And if he thinks about the tax that the farmers will pay, he can get closer to the amount he aimed for.\n-Calculation of grain market impact in progress. Error range confirmed.\nThis is just the beginning. The global food market will be shaken by this country as a start, and people will eventually take it for granted that blessed crops will come up on their table.\nOf course, only farmers who serve Demera, the goddess of life and abundance, can grow these blessed crops, so in fact, TTG Guild will dominate the world’s food.\nThe only uncertainty in this grand plan is the neighboring country of that region…\nThe machine thought that the possibility of invasion in Beida Huang region was low when looking at the complex situation of East Asia’s ‘53 countries’.\nThe world history changed greatly after the Cataclysm. Inter-state wars became meaningless waste of national power, and more importantly, these numerous countries were overwhelmed by dealing with their own gates.\nIt won’t be a problem in the end. There is no way it will be a problem. There were once those who shouted for unification of China, but that’s an old story now.\nThe factions who broke away from the central government of the great country and established their own kingdoms did not feel the need to expand their kingdom unnecessarily.\nThe neighboring country of Heilong People’s Republic, Gilim Republic, is also busy blocking gates.\nA human leader with common sense would have no reason to do excessive use of force here.\nLogical calculation based on big data and fateful victory. This was the only conclusion Yappy came up with.\nA perfect zero-sum game? High risk high return? That kind of thing is meaningless number play in front of a strong artificial intelligence.\nMy land will rise. It will definitely rise. It has to rise.\nThree days later.\n[Gilim Republic coup d’etat.]\n-Sir, sir Yappy! This is Huang, the head of the department! Food prices! Food prices are plummeting! There are rumors that orc armies are heading to the grain fields!\n-Kiruk?\n[Coup d’etat by orc soldiers. Blatant invasion declaration to Heilong People’s Republic grain fields for food security.]\n-This is news that the company’s profitability will plummet! The loss rate has already exceeded 30 billion won! If this goes on, we’ll go bankrupt!\n-Kiruk?\n[UN criticism letter issued. Shocking statement by Lin Xiang Kazak, who led the coup d’etat, ‘Orcs decide everything by war’.]\n[Detroit city mayor publicly supports orcs.]\n[Orc discrimination violates political correctness. Those who have power must reflect and understand them.]\n[Great confusion in the world food market. Will Beida Huang grain fields fall into orc hands?]\n[Rising Comet Divine Private Equity’s sudden war causes quarterly returns to plummet!]\n-The bank came. It’s a seizure warning. You have to pay 14 billion won in interest this month.\n-Ki, kiruk?\nAre they going to take this?",

      "content": "Chapter 69: Yappy Private Equity\nYacht spinner, the nightmare of Cheongju Gate and an emotionless killing machine.\nHe is the final boss and survivor of the Red Gate, and currently the first Holy Knight and financial manager of TTG Guild, the de facto brain.\nYappy work is complex and plentiful.\nManagement and surveillance of trainees. Expansion of facilities needed for the headquarters. Infrastructure construction and legal, administrative management.\nHe is a tireless machine and a strong artificial intelligence, and he does all this perfectly, but Yappy most important missions are TTG Guild publicity and financial management.\nThe former is hacking the central system of YouTube and SNS, and perfectly manipulating public opinion and media control.\nIt has already been promoted worldwide, and among those who are interested in it, he finds suitable talents by collecting personal information, financial status, and kinship without missing.\nHe has a perfect grasp of the believers who will be the pilot cases of the TTG Guild.\nThe latter is financial management. This was easier than the former.\nYappy is already a big fish in the stock market. Under the principle of becoming a righteous thief, he disrupts the stock market and robs the absolute majority of the operation forces.\nThe collapse of successive operation forces has become a big news topic overseas, and it has been reported that there is a strange phenomenon in the stock market where self-purification is suddenly taking place.\nA virtuous cycle stock market where good companies are evaluated at their proper value and bad companies are undervalued. It was thanks to Yappy who was smashing the operation forces in real time.\nYappy, who did these two tasks perfectly, wanted to move on to the next step: a profit-making faith system that combines the former and latter tasks.\nShow off TTG Guild miracle and increase believers, seize the food market and maximize profits. The influence on the world food market is a bonus.\nThe plan was perfect.\nLogically, rationally, even looking at international public opinion.\nThe grain field of Heilong People’s Republic, where Yappy invested, is a stable country as if there is no external threat.\nUnless there is a ‘coup’ in the next country or a war ‘declared’ in the next country.\n-Yaya, there was a war upstairs.\n-Upstairs? North Korea?\n-They’ve been ruined for a long time. More upstairs.\n-Does Russia have any room to start a war?\nEven though Leon was the owner of TTG Guild headquarters, they had basic infrastructure such as internet and TV.\nThanks to the 100-gigabit internet designed by Yappy everyone knew about the hot war news on the news.\n“Sir Yappy did you hear that there was a war upstairs? It doesn’t matter much to us, but it seems that the government side is very busy.”\n-…\nYappy was watching over the trainees’ sword training. To be precise, he was recording the number and time of mechanical repetitions such as cutting 10,000 times, blocking 10,000 times, swinging 10,000 times, etc.\nHe had been doing this for a week already, so he wondered if he was used to it or not. Ha-ri repeated upper cuts while chatting with Yappy who didn’t have any sense.\n“But it’s a big deal. I heard that Heilong People’s Republic’s grain field imports food from our country. Rice is no problem, but they seem to import quite a lot of other crops.”\n-…\n“The UN and the US are warning and sanctioning them, but they are orcs anyway. Long-term war is inevitable──”\n-Inadequate action. Delete from record 1,397 times. Do it again.\n“Huh?”\nHa-ri was struck by lightning out of nowhere, but Yappy was merciless to this insensitive organic matter.\n“Whew… I’m so tired today.”\nHa-ri whined tiredly as Yappy approached her.\n“Hic! Sir Yappy, I did my quota today?!”\nYapipy kindly poured her a drink himself and recommended it to Ha-ri who was startled.\n-Drink. Hydration required.\n“Oh, um… yes, thank you.”\nHa-ri awkwardly accepted it. It was awkward because Yappy had never been so kind before.\nYappy smiled with an emoticon on his hologram and said,\n“Wha-, why are you so scary?”\n-This is only for Ha-ri.\n“Only for me?”\n-I have my own hedge fund in operation. It is an asset management group that is growing smoothly.\nIt’s true. Yappy’s hedge fund has been operating for two months now and has hired a suitable asset manager to run it. Its return rate had already reached the highest level in Korea.\nOf course. He didn’t mention that he had fallen into hell for three days recently.\n-I plan to implement financial welfare for TTG Guild employees.\nYappy devoured all the books related to psychological warfare. People don’t persuade them to invest, they beg them to let them in.\n-I will manage your assets for you as a special employee welfare. Join today.\nHe said that and distributed the membership form. Ha-ri stared at Yappy with trembling eyes.\n“Are you investing?”\n-I’m going to ‘manage’ your assets.\n“Sir Yappy, do you also do stocks? Wow~ You’re so smart.”\nHa-ri, who lived with a wall built with finance and investment, looked at Yappy with curious eyes.\n-Han Ha-ri. Considering your poor financial situation, you need a professional asset manager.\n“Po-, poor? No, no? I’ve saved quite a bit for my age?!”\nYappy hit her with a fact.\n-Only 15% of the average financial situation of A-class hunters. Even if the activity period is short, it is an abnormal situation. The problem is donating your meager salary and gate clear bonus.\n“Well, that… I’m donating to the orphanage where I grew up after deducting living expenses…”\n-Donation behavior, moral. But you need financial expansion for more donations.\n“I don’t really need it──ouch!”\nYappy hit the back of her hand with a non-lethal wire as he kept counting seconds.\n-Giving up on life by being lazy about financial studies in a modern society closely related to finances. I will fill your lack of knowledge. Be grateful.\n“Uh… Then two million won…”\n-20 million won.\n“That’s all my savings?!”\n-I’ll give you ten times back. Take out the deposit for the semi-basement in Seoul.\n“Ah…”\nHa-ri reluctantly deposited money into Yappy’s account, thinking that the machine wouldn’t lie.\nYappy, who received Ha-ri’s money, made an additional suggestion as planned.\n-Han Ha-ri is now a ‘silver’ member. I raised it one more level from bronze.\n“Silver member?”\n-Bronze members guarantee 100%, silver members guarantee 200% profit. Do you want to upgrade?\n“Well, that’s good?”\n-If you sign up five more members, I will upgrade you to a gold member. Then 300% profit.\n“Re-, really?”\nHan Ha-ri, 20 years old, a social freshman who was just thrown into society.\nShe was so naive that he couldn’t even think that this was a typical method of multi-level marketing.\n“Soo-ho, sister found a good place to invest──”\n“Oh, Ha-ri. ──”\nHa-ri was kind. Anyone who knows her does not doubt her goodwill. So…\n“Wow, diamond member! Then 500% profit guaranteed?”\n-Congratulations. If you pay more money, I’ll raise you to diamond 3-star member.\n“Then if I take out the rent money…!\nHa-ri was a great multi-level employee.\n-Choi Young-gam High. Are you interested in investing for retirement? The villagers too──\nAnd this movement spread all over the place centered on TTG Guild. It was only a matter of time before the number of members soared.\nAnd a week later.\n“We came from the district court. It’s an asset seizure warning.”\nThe bailiff came with a red sticker.\n****\n[Bankruptcy crisis for TTG Guild!]\n[Reckless asset management. Is it a failed investment by Yappy!]\n[A survivor with a shabby appearance. Will the survivor’s success story collapse like this?]\n“…”\nLeon read the newspaper and stared at Yappy and the TTG Guild staff in front of him.\nIn front of everyone, Yappy was lonely as if he was on trial.\n“What happened? Summarize it.”\nA seizure warning came from the local court. It was because they failed to pay the interest on the loan borrowed in the name of TTG Guild.\nThat wasn’t all. Most of the TTG Guild staff, including Ha-ri invested, but the private equity fund they invested in plummeted.\n-I’ll explain.\nYappy began to recite his recent actions logically and clearly.\nHe established a private equity fund for the expansion and fund-raising of TTG Guild. He borrowed bank loans as much as possible in the name of the guild and increased the investment funds by attracting staff.\nThe amount of money he invested in the Heilong People’s Republic Fund and Farm, which was shattered by the invasion of Gilim Republic.\n“Yappy, you bastard… That money is 86 million won, my entire fortune… I even gave you my deposit money…”\nHa-ri sobbed with a sad face and the other staff was the same.\n“Damn it…! My money! It was my wife’s savings that I scraped together!”\nFrom Kim Jin-soo, a dispatched employee of the Association…\n“Ha, haha… My five-year fixed deposit that I saved to buy medicine…”\nThe soldiers, including Koo Dae-sung, a first-generation trainee.\n“I put up land as collateral…”\nEven local farmers.\nThe amount was a whopping 800 billion won!!\nThe victims were not only these. People who invested in Yappy’s TTG Guild private equity fund made a fuss outside the gate, and Leon listened to their stories for a while.\n“Lord Spinner, how much is the loss?”\n-At this point, it is 878 billion 54 million 34 thousand won. Increasing by 49 million 85 thousand 3 thousand 655 won per hour. Loss rate about 72%\n“Huh…?!”\nHa-ri was shocked by the debt that transcended common sense. Leon also asked with curiosity about the large scale.\n“There is no such amount of money in this temple?”\n-Borrowed with collateral.\n“Collateral?”\n-Naju Plain rice field 130,000 hectares. Rice harvested this year. TTG Guild office building. Georgic’s hammer.\nIn short, it meant that he had poured out all the money that could be used by TTG Guild, not only the money of the investors who were harmed. If he goes bankrupt, Leon will also end up on the street.\nYappy made an excuse.\n-The fund will recover. This time is just a temporary liquidity crisis. It is ignorant and impatient to rejoice or grieve over minor chart changes. The Beta Huang Grain Belt is the lifeline of East Asia. The international community cannot leave such a grain belt alone──\n“No, Russia just declared support for the Republic? It’s falling in real time?”\n-That can’t be… true. It’s an irrational conclusion. There is no reason to risk international sanctions. The disadvantages are much greater than the benefits. That can’t be──Putin bastard.\n“”…“”\nThe victims lost their words at Yappy’s confident and even shameless claim.\nIn short, it was like an asset manager who lost more than 70% of his investment amount saying that it would go up and puffing up his chest.\n“Ah! Give me back my money!”\n“Damn it, let’s take something!”\nInevitably, TTG Guild staff ignored their second priority and investors who invested in private equity funds went crazy.\n“Hey, hey! Let’s take that pillar!”\n“Search for something! There must be something!”\n“Empty out the rice warehouse! That’s all money!”\nThe investors who tried to save even a penny stopped when they found the blade of Archdemon Androzin, stored in the warehouse.\nThis legendary item made of Adamantite was Yappy’s precious research material.\n-Stop, human. Don’t take that…! It’s my property!\nIt was then. When an investor tried to reach Georgic’s hammer at last──\n“Stop floundering, you wretched things!!”\n-Kuk?!\n-Huh!\nLeon’s roar stopped everyone in this place.\nEveryone stopped with a tingling fear, and Leon waited until they calmed down enough.\nLeon said.\n“Lord Spinner.”\n-Your Majesty…\nSpinner also approached him with a low posture, sensing Leon’s anger in his voice.\n“I believe you can solve this situation with your intelligence. How long can you solve it?”\n-I will solve it by tomorrow.\nTomorrow? How? How can he solve the loss of hundreds of billions by tomorrow?\n“Good. Then I’ll leave it to you.”\nBut the victims couldn’t answer anything to Leon’s faith.\nThey also thought that this situation could not be reversed by ordinary ideas.\nEventually, they had to rely on an external force, but who could clean up this mess except Yappy, the culprit of this whole situation?\n“I guarantee your debt in the name of the Lion King. You guys just go back and do your work.”\nThe investors had a lot to say. But no one could stand up to Leon’s roar.\nMore than anything, it was clear that even if they applied for seizure now, they wouldn’t be able to get even half of the amount they invested.\nA day. Will a miracle happen that everything will be solved within that time?\nYappy went into the workshop for a while and didn’t come out. And four hours later──\n[Emergency injection. Safety test ignored.]\n[Integrated armed platform MK.1 with special external skeleton launched.]\nA weapon that changed the history of human warfare was launched from TTG Guild office building.\n[Operation code: Fund resurrection]\nFor a very annoying reason.\nThe war was started by the invasion of the orc dictator who seized power and Hunters from various countries were also mobilized in this war.\nHundreds of hunters, tens of thousands of soldiers along with orc immigrants from various countries were involved.\nNo matter how much the continent was torn apart and collapsed after the Great Cataclysm, the continent was a continent. The number of troops mobilized was not ordinary.\nAnd modern warfare is advanced network warfare.\nKilling each other with guns and knives on the battlefield is not the whole of war.\nElectronic warfare in various countries is also an important battle to paralyze the enemy’s network or disrupt the GPS information of missiles.\nThe information soldiers of Gilim Republic, the invader, also executed electronic warfare using all means they could for two weeks after the outbreak of war.\n“Hoo… Damn it, what kind of hardship is this because of those damn orcs.”\n“This is a war without any justification…”\nMany survivors came over from another world after the Great Cataclysm. Among them were humans, but there were also many heterogeneous races.\nMartial artists from the martial arts world, elves, dwarves, orcs and other heterogeneous races from the fantasy world.\nEven recently, mechanical tanks from the future world came.\nAmong them, orcs are still a headache for modern times.\nAt first, they competed to receive immigration in various countries to mobilize their excellent combat power for gate conquest, but problems soon arose.\nThey were too violent and tried to solve everything with violence. They ate food at a restaurant and tried to kill and loot the restaurant owner, and they asked for a duel to take away the house they liked.\nAnd what are those bastards doing so hard to breed? The population grew quickly, and after five years they were as strong as ordinary hunters.\nSo Africa was full of orcs, and orc coups happened frequently in Southeast Asia.\nBut then an orc coup happened in Gilim Republic and they tried to support their breeding population by waging war on their neighboring countries.\nHow can a war be justified with such a bullshit reason?\nIf Russia had not supported them and opposed the dispatch of peacekeeping forces from the UN, trying to contain the US and the Western world, they would have been suppressed long ago.\nBut in the end, the one with the sword is the master, and the information soldiers of the Republic of Gilim had to invade the Heilong People’s Republic, which was once their brother.\n“Damn, let’s hope the war ends soon.”\n“How did our Han people end up like this…”\nBut it might be better than the socialist country D, where a necromancer became the head of state, with such resignation, he was tapping on the keyboard at that time──\n-BEEP BEEP!\nThe alarm sounded throughout the computer room. The information soldiers of the Republic of Gilim screamed in horror.\n“Wha, what? The headquarters information room hacked?! The third firewall was breached? It’s been less than 3 seconds since we caught it!\n“Si, sir! The fifth firewall was broken through!”\n“What kind of bullshit is that?”\nLike other continental countries, the Republic of Gilim was also a military faction country that inherited the legacy of a former superpower.\nThey still had supercomputers and information assets that were active in protecting their national information network, and the system built by IT talents was solid.\nAbove all, the security capability of the military information command was not at the world’s best level, but it was not at a level that Heilong People’s Republic could handle.\nBut all those firewalls were breached in less than 5 seconds?\n“GPS system disabled! Traffic Safety Agency down!”\n“The tactical radio network collapsed! It seems that military satellites have also been taken over!”\n“It’s not just the military radio network. Civilian networks too… This is crazy! The bank system is down too?”\nWhat the hell is going on? The colonel who commanded the information command shouted urgently.\n“Did those Yankees set off an EMP or something?! There was no nuclear missile in orbit!”\nNo, even if they detonated a nuclear missile with EMP from space orbit, would this be possible? Besides, there were more than one or two computer downs that could not be explained by EMP.\nAs everyone watched helplessly at all the disasters unfolding before their eyes, the same phrase began to appear on their screens.\n“Wha, what is this?”\n“The culprit…”\nThe phrase that appeared on their screens was──\n「I came to end this war.」",

      "content": "Chapter 70: The God of Electronic Warfare\nThere was a huge country on the continent. No, the continent itself was a country.\nIt was a bit exaggerated and pretentious, but it boasted that it had ten thousand years of history.\nIt had some mishaps, but it still predicted explosive growth with its overwhelming size and population. A sleeping lion.\nBut the lion was slaughtered without waking up.\nThe Great Cataclysm, the worst disaster of mankind that announced the morning of the 21st century hit the country as gates sprouted up from all directions.\nAt that time, there was no system for hunters who could oppose the gates.\nMost countries could not cope with the gates and lost many lands to dungeon contamination, and their cities were destroyed by monsters that came out of dungeon breaks.\nIt could have survived somehow with its advantages since the country had a lot of people and a lot of land.\nWhat if some people die, what if some land is contaminated?\nThe population of one billion became 500 million in just one year, but there were hundreds of thousands of warriors who were loyal to death.\nThe communist party leaders at the time were not incompetent.\nSurprisingly, they did their best for their country in this natural disaster. But──\nThe country was too big, too wide, and too huge.\nThe gates pouring out from all sides, the rigid response peculiar to dictatorship, the check on the sky warriors who suddenly gained power and exerted an undeniable influence, and the refusal of local military factions to withdraw their power revealed the corruption and decay of the country and the population continued to decrease, the land was contaminated, and food was scarce.\nIn the fall of 2012 the appearance of the second black gate, Shanghai Gate, and the emergence of the Archdemon Skazakaria and the epic item Wandering Demon Sword evaporated 15 million people in Shanghai.\nThe country began to collapse with this terrible damage as a start and local military factions rebelled against the weakened central government.\nAs usual in the history of the country, ambitious military factions proclaimed themselves kings.\nSo today in 2034 the country was torn apart into more than 50 small countries.\nHere in the north-easternmost part of East Asia there are two countries from the former continental country that has been torn apart into 53 pieces.\nA land of misfortune where more than half of it was contaminated by dungeon breaks, but it is adjacent to Russia and has abundant grain fields in Heilong People’s Republic and Jilin Republic, which accepted a lot of orc immigrants and lost soldiers, sky warriors and hunters while blocking monster waves.\nBoth countries were once huge countries, but until yesterday they were just ordinary continental countries without much presence among the other 50 states.\nBut that was until yesterday.\nThe two countries were mentioned one after another in overseas topics around the world and became the hottest countries in the world.\n“Kraaam~”\nOrc Private Liu of Jilin Republic Army is a typical orc immigrant.\nHe is exactly an immigrant of 16 generations, but since orcs become adults at two years old and start breeding, generation distinction is meaningless.\n“Boss, where are all the enemies?”\nOrc People’s Army soldiers approached Private Liu and they seemed to be itching to fight right away.\n“The guys next door are boring! We came to fight them, but they ran away with their tails between their legs!”\n“Human bastards are weak. They don’t know anything about the honor of warriors.”\nNext door, that is, until two days ago they were the Heilong People’s Army who stood together on the southern border, but orcs don’t remember such old pasts.\nAll they know is that Rynshang Kazak, a legend among legends of orcs, became Jilin’s great chief. And if you want to eat a lot of food, you have to kill all those humans on that ridge.\nThe Jilin Republic, which lacked power due to continuous wars and gate raids, was destroyed by orc immigrants they accepted but the irony was that this was not orc business at all.\nIf they were normal civilized people, they would have negotiated and traded, but orcs solved problems in a very orc way.\n“They say there’s a lot of food next door!”\n“Let’s kill them all and take their food!”\nWhy bother trading when you can kill and take? They were different races from the beginning, so there was no reason to discuss common sense.\n“I can finally eat human stew.”\n“I wish humans would show up soon!”\nThe orc army advanced toward Heilong People’s Republic without hesitation and in front of their powerful combat power, Heilong soldiers and citizens who were fed up ran away long ago.\nThey tried to enter the city with the intention of looting even an empty city. And then── something fell from the sky.\n-Gwoooooooo…!\nIt was a 10m tungsten rod that fell at Mach 25.\n“God’s rod was hacked?”\nUS Secretary of Defense Julius doubted his ears.\nIt was natural.\nHe heard that the secret weapon of his country, the satellite weapon ‘God’s Rod’, suddenly started to operate.\nGod’s Rod, a cold war thing that drops super-heavy projectiles from artificial satellites and causes nuclear weapon-level destruction.\nOriginally, it should have been scrapped long ago, but it was made to snipe the ‘Archdemon-class’ entity that caused dungeon breaks after the Great Cataclysm.\nOf course, both the satellite and the projectile were much stronger than the original plan, and it was a hidden weapon that was literally made with the money of the 21st century America.\nSuch a weapon suddenly started to operate.\n“What is this, how did this happen! Who issued the activation permit for the G-1 satellite!”\nOnly three people in the United States have the ‘password key’ to activate God’s Rod.\nOne is the US president. It’s like a symbol, just like a nuclear bag.\nThe other two are the Secretary of Defense and the Commander of the US Special Hunter Department.\nAnd one of them, Julius Secretary of Defense, never approved this operation. Of course, neither did the president or the hunter commander.\n“Was it hacked…?”\nThe soldiers at the command raised their hands at Julius’ question.\n“The password key changes every minute. The combination pattern is over 100 million. It takes 13 years to calculate even with the world’s best supercomputer!”\nThen who on earth activated God’s Rod?\n“Damn, we have to stop it somehow! Is there no way to stop it at the activation stage?”\n“No, impossible! The password pattern has been strengthened! The estimated pattern is over 10 billion!”\n“What kind of fantasy is that?!” How is that possible?\nMeanwhile, God’s Rod was preparing to operate and finished firing preparations.\n“G-1 target specified! Jilin Republic…? It is! Jilin Republic?!”\n“What, what nonsense? Why are they targeting them?!”\nIt’s an area that has been bothering the United States lately.\nThe coup d’etat was caused by orc soldiers and the sudden war with neighboring Heilong People’s Republic.\nNormally, they would think that they should send UN troops or US troops to end the situation, but Russia suddenly intervened and blocked it.\nThe Heilong People’s Republic attacked the Jilin Republic first. That was the reason.\nOf course it was nonsense and obvious.\nIf the orc army occupied Heilong People’s Republic, they would claim to be liberators of Heilong and take over Heilong grain fields next.\nThe United States had no intention of getting involved in protecting the remnants of a country that had already been torn apart as much as possible.\nThe UN also only issued a moderate criticism statement, and had no will to actively stop this war.\nThe northern part of the Korean Peninsula was a can of worms to begin with.\nThere’s no reason to bother with the Russian-backed Jilin. But──\n“Damn! If God’s rod hits Jilin like this, the Russkies will jump around!”\nIt was an impossible thing for the United States to attack another country with nuclear weapons without a declaration of war. Even if Russia whines, it would be a bit of a hassle.\nJulius Secretary of Defense made a decision.\n“Fire a ballistic missile at G-1.”\n“…”\nNo one questioned the order to destroy their own $10 billion military asset.\nThe soldiers in the control room silently instructed the nearest ballistic missile launch site to fire, and──\n“Sir… The base is not responding.”\n“What do you mean?”\nIt was literal. For some reason, none of the missile bases or naval fleets in the United States connected to the Pentagon responded.\n‘Could it be, communication was blocked?’\nHow?\nRegardless of the question, time went by.\n“Tell the communication room to order by Morse code or something! Use analog or whatever!”\n“The communication room is not responding either! Phone, internet are all down!”\n“What nonsense is that?”\nAs if someone expected this? No. It’s too clever timing for that. As if someone next to him heard his command and dealt with it in real time.\n‘It can’t be! That’s impossible!’\nIt can’t be. Even if all the hackers in the world unite and hack the Pentagon, it’s impossible. Secretary of Defense Julius shivered in fear in his confusion as someone in the control room shouted.\n“5M65 NATO codename Grizzly confirmed to be activated!”\n“…Why?”\nThe code name that the controller just shouted is a ruby high-output laser satellite weapon that is only activated by Russia’s dungeon break final operation protocol.\n18 years ago, it was a collection of Russian military technology that sniped the army of the Frost Queen in Siberia.\nIt uses astronomical amounts of ruby just to operate once, and it has only operated three times in 18 years. Why did that activate now?\n“Grizzly lens moving! Coordinate specified… Jilin Republic border area… What’s there that──Orc army advancing to Heilong?”\nOnly then did Julius Secretary of Defense realize what intention this situation had.\nHe didn’t know, but someone wanted to destroy the Jilin Republic and the orcs.\n“Launch countdown begins! Ready to operate simultaneously with Grizzly!”\n“Crazy…”\nWho?\nHow? For what?\n“5! 4! 3! 2! 1──Launched!”\nThe device of destruction operates.\nAs soon as it operated, it hit all orc armies in the Jilin Republic.\nGod’s rod and codename Grizzly the shot one after another annihilated the orc army in an instant.\nSurprisingly, they showed accuracy that exceeded the performance of the two satellite weapons, rather upgraded, and only sniped orc armies persistently.\nIf there was even one civilian or humanoid other than the orcs nearby, they wouldn’t even try to bombard at all.\nWhen this whole situation was almost over, emergency announcement videos from the White House and Kremlin were released on the Internet.\n[We, the United States of America, do not tolerate the actions of the Jilin Republic Army that break peace, and fired twelve God’s rods for the protection of the Heilong People’s Republic.]\nOn one side was the face of the US president──\n[Russia does not tolerate provocations from bad neighboring countries. We will not spare any cooperation for peace. We cooperated with the United States to specify coordinates and only against the coup army──]\nOn the other side, the Russian president announced his position.\nAnd when communication was restored and Secretary of Defense Julius confirmed these videos, he shivered in fear.\n“Deepfake…”\nThe deepfake video that could only be called perfect was blocked from being deleted.\nCurrently, SNS and media outlets are flooded with economic news announcing US-Russia joint attacks on the Jilin Republic coup army.\nThey were perfectly fooled.\nSecretary of Defense Julius felt fear in front of a great hacker who could manipulate the information network of the United States and Russia in this 21st century.\nAbove all, what should he call an electronic war god who has near-omnipotent electronic warfare capabilities in modern times where everything runs on electronic devices and networks are developed?\n“Deus…”\nDeus ex Machina.\nIt was a machine device worthy of calling itself a god.\n“Why… Did this happen?”\nIn Jilin Republic Presidential Office, orc chief Rynshang Kazak, who cut off the neck of the former president and took his seat, looked at the coup army that was annihilated in an instant with a blank expression.\nHe was a veteran of three generations of orc immigrants who conquered gates with his powerful combat power and became a power broker of the Jilin Republic. It was natural for him to kill the weakling who ordered him.\nHe got the big boss position, and all that was left was to start endless wars as an orc boss.\nBut…\nCommunication was blocked and all electronic systems operated by using weak human bones were completely down.\nEven the encrypted communication of each unit that delivered news in analog only reported the annihilation of the unit.\n“Boss, what do we do?”\n“Are we fucked?”\nThe subordinate orc officers wanted an answer with an anxious look, but Rynshang Kazak had no answer.\n“First, let’s take care of the remaining guys and take the money and run. Let’s go to the grassland and have some kids and start over.”\nOrc’s fertility is terrifying and they can give birth anywhere, like popping out babies.\nIf you ‘work’ for five years, they can quickly grow in size, and with this much power, they will be welcomed anywhere for gate raids.\nThat’s how bad the situation on the continent was, and it was a country that even had to borrow orc hands.\nBut the machine knight who watched all this did not tolerate it.\n-Kwang!\nSomething broke through the wall of the office and as the orcs witnessed the intruder their pupils widened.\n“What, what is that!”\nIt was a steel armor in the shape of a human.\nIf you modify a medieval crude knight armor into a futuristic one, would this futuristic yet old-fashioned design come out?\nThe unpainted ‘Adamantite’ exoskeleton armor looked like it had been hastily pieced together and soldered together somewhere.\n<Special Exoskeleton Integrated Armament Platform Mk.1>\nAs much as it looks like a peculiar knight armor, the weapons attached to the whole body are ferocious.\n[Target target confirmed. Non-human species-orc confirmed.]\nDeus ex Machina.\nThe armored platform of the machine holy knight who came down from the sky aimed at the culprit of this whole situation.\n[Give me back my funds.]",

      "content": "Chapter 71: Who owns the hammer?\nSuddenly attacked by Yappy’s integrated weapon platform Mk.1, Rynshang didn’t take it seriously and raised his axe.\n“I don’t know who you are, but you dare to challenge this orc warlord Rynshang Kazak──”\n[Assassination mode activated.]\nMachine gun bullets rained down on the orcs around Rynshang’s office.\nThe orcs generals were engulfed by the firestorm of the ultra-high-speed machine gun that fired 6,000 rounds per minute. But only one orc officer of the lowest rank was hit by the firestorm.\nAt that moment, the orcs who came to the office with their weapons raised their shields to block the machine gun bullets.\n“Die, you bastard!”\nOne of the orc officers aimed a large shotgun. It was a 17-type high-power buckshot gun developed for orc infantry. It was the most preferred weapon by the orcs who were fascinated by the hot firepower of the shotgun.\n-Kwak!\nThe buckshot showered Mk.1 but the shotgun’s firepower couldn’t even scratch Mk.1.\n“Guns don’t work! Bring out your axes!”\nThe reason why the migration of orcs was strongly encouraged was because they were a combat race that attacked the gate with their axes.\nThe orc generals who wielded house-sized axes rushed at Mk.1 in unison.\n[Special-modified ultra-high-mass 12-gauge buckshot x2 SET]\nThe set gun was a 35-type high-power buckshot gun secretly smuggled through domestic violent organizations for orc generals. It was a high-mass high-power bullet that was modified to the extreme.\nIt was fired at two orc officers who approached.\n“Kuk?!”\nThe orc officers were torn to pieces by dozens of steel balls.\nModern equipment was effective for orcs and hunters, unlike the monsters in the gate. Not to mention the special bullets that were handmade by the God of Iron and Blacksmith along with Yappy.\n“Die!”\nBut the orcs who didn’t care about their comrades’ deaths took advantage of the gap and swung their axes.\n-Kang!\nA clear sound of metal clashing was heard but the orc officers looked puzzled.\nThey were among the strongest of the orcs, being officers, their axes were unique weapons and their swinging power was comparable to A-rank hunters or higher. Even if they tried to block it with a shield, the shield would crumble…\n[Organic aesthetics cannot distinguish Adamantite.]\nIt was an exoskeleton coated with Adamantite, which was melted from the blades of the Archdemon Androzin but that wasn’t all.\nThe exoskeleton that made up Mk1 was filled with only the highest-grade rare minerals. Its strength was unique-level defense, even excluding the Adamantite parts.\nIt wasn’t a defense that could be broken by an orc who had a slightly better weapon.\n“You bastard…?!”\nAt that moment, Mk.1’s palm grabbed the orc’s face. The orc struggled to break free, but he didn’t budge.\n‘Wha, what kind of power…!’\nThere have been many combat robots that could replace hunters.\nBut none of them were commercialized, because there were phenomena where mechanical devices broke down inside the gate, and more importantly, it was almost impossible to implement a power that could surpass human-sized combat machines, hunters.\nTo be precise, it was possible to implement a low-rank hunter level, but it was better to hire one more hunter or hire orcs than to make such a super robot.\nBut Yappy’s Mk.1 surpassed the limits of modern military technology by far.\nYappy’s small nuclear reactor produced spare batteries that could move a tank and he put five such batteries in it.\nWith that power, he had no choice but to hold on to the orc.\nHe blew off the orc’s head with a 12-gauge shotgun and stared at Rynshang Kazak, the only remaining orc officer.\n“Not bad. The guys you just killed were confirmed to be generals.”\nRynshang Kazak raised his axe at Yappy who killed his subordinates.\nYappy fired a 12-gauge shotgun right away, but he blocked it with a large axe blade.\n“WHAAAAAAAAAA──!!”\nWith a loud roar, Rynshang Kazak charged but Yappy made a mistake in trusting his Adamantite armor and facing his charge head-on.\n-Kwaaang!\nWith a loud noise, Mk.1’s body was pushed back. And that wasn’t all. The left arm coated with Adamantite broke and bent under Rynshang’s axe strike.\n[…Same material used.]\n“That’s right! This axe is also made of pure Adamantite! Even drakes couldn’t withstand this axe strike!”\nRynshang was an orc soldier of an immigrant tribe who rose to be an officer right under his enemy.\nThe rank of an orc was determined solely by their achievements and specialties in the gate. In other words──\n[Estimated rank S.]\nHe was not a mere coup dictator, but a hunter of S rank.\n[Firepower insufficient.]\nHe hastily completed the weapon, so it was lacking in armament.\nOriginally, in addition to the special-modified 12-gauge shotgun, he should have equipped a special-reactive machine gun or an ultra-accelerated extra-class railgun for the target species.\nOriginally, this exoskeleton suit was a platform for operating an integrated weapon system to replace Yappy’s reduced body and he wouldn’t have even deployed if he hadn’t been rushed to intervene by the investors’ enthusiasm.\nThen there was only one way left: close combat.\n[Unauthorized prototype combat system activated.]\nYappy manipulated Mk.1’s body as the two thick legs split in half and turned into four.\nThe thick steel plate on the back turned into a huge sword and it looked like a knight with four legs. Half-human, half-demon…No, rather than that, it was closer to a spider, the spider knight that was expected to be the final result.\n[Project Yacht Spinner. Prototype bayonet specification activated.]\n“Kahaha! You know something! Yeah, let’s fight like warriors!”\nRynshang laughed heartily and ran at him with his axe while Mk1 faced him head-on.\nThe axe and sword collided, sparks flew, and the friction of metal and metal splashed.\n“Hmm…! Not bad!”\nThey were evenly matched in strength. But the sword started to lose its edge. The difference in material composition as a weapon was too great.\n[Thrust activated. Activity limit 3 minutes 20 seconds.]\n“Huh?!”\nThe thrusters on Mk.1’s four legs and arms began to spray high-temperature energy. It was an overuse of output that anticipated the melting of its own battery.\nHe had no choice but to be pushed back by the self-destructive over-output, even if he was Rynshang.\nRynshang, who was pushed back by force, hit the wall and broke the building wall one after another.\n“Kahaha! Not bad! But…!”\nRynshang twisted his body slightly, brushed off Mk.1 and swung his axe hard. He was an orc warlord who had rolled on the battlefield for a long time and avoided a head-on collision skillfully.\n-Kwaduk!\nOne arm flew off with a skillful axe strike and Rynshang read his victory.\n“Die!”\nMk.1, who lost one arm, swung his sword, but he easily knocked it off and penetrated into the center. Rynshang smashed Yappy’s remaining arm with his axe strike and trampled on him.\n“You’re clumsy and slower than the monsters in the gate!”\nAs Rynshang raised his axe, a hidden auxiliary arm aimed a 12-gauge shotgun at him. But at that moment, a huge shock wave erupted from Rynshang’s military boots that trampled on Mk.1.\n-Kung!\nThe powerful shock wave shattered Mk.1 and smashed the auxiliary arm and shotgun as well. Rynshang laughed.\n“Do you think you can face me, who has the blessing of the war god Helkan, with this piece of scrap metal?”\nIt’s over now. The last struggle failed for Mk.1, and he mercilessly struck his chest with his axe, avoiding the Adamantite skeleton. And as Mk.1 shattered──\n[Budget, time shortage. Field test failed.]\nMk.1’s chest opened and a bright light appeared inside. Rynshang tried to strike it with his axe, but he couldn’t move.\n“What?”\nRynshang noticed the wires that tied his arms. As soon as his chest opened, wires shot out from inside and tied Rynshang’s arms.\n[Good field data obtained. With this, big data is closer to perfection.]\n“What nonsense are you──!”\nAt that moment, Yappy’s secondary arm swung the wire.\nThe spider web swept past Rynshang in the blink of an eye. Rynshang saw the moment that made his neck tremble in real time.\nThis was the end of Rynshang Kazak, an ambitious orc dictator who had taken over the Jilin Republic in a coup and waged war against its neighbors.\nAfter slaying Rynshang Kazak, Yappy pushed past the rushing orcs and grabbed the axe Rynshang had left behind with his tiny secondary arm.\n[Checked for Adamantite, will retrieve]\nBinding the axe with wire and loading it into the half-destroyed Mk.1, Yappy left the command center.\n* * * *\n[The coup d’etat in the Jilin Republic that shook the world has come to an end. The newly established Jilin Republic government apologized and negotiated for peace──]\n[The food crisis that was triggered by the invasion of the Jilin People’s Republic has returned to normal. At the same time, blessed crops were discovered in the BeidaHuang Grain Field, and the market price──]\nThe orc troops that were advancing to the Heilong People’s Republic were annihilated, and the core forces of the coup d’etat, including Rynshang Kazak, were assassinated, and the war ended.\n“Wow~ I’m so relieved. The war is completely over.”\nHa-ri was relieved by the fact that the war was over. She thought it was hopeless, but it seemed that there was no law that said people had to die.\n“Oh, then Yappy’s hedge fund will recover, right? Let’s see, what? The, the return rate?!”\nHa-ri almost dropped her phone in shock when she saw the return rate announced by Yappy’s hedge fund.\nThe good news that started to appear in the news at the same time as the end of the war, the spread of Demera’s goddess worship and miasma purification in the BeidaHuang Grain Field.\nAlthough it was small, blessed crops began to spread, and the food price soared to the sky.\nThe return rate that was soaring in real time was about 800% more than before the crash. In other words, Ha-ri earned more than 600 million won in profit excluding fees.\n“Wow, wow! It’s amazing, Yappy!”\n-Kiruk\nYappy spoke to Ha-ri in a somewhat arrogant tone.\n-You ignorant ants. Do you know what liquid assets and real economy are?\nYappy’s hedge fund, which seemed to be doomed to fail, recorded a minimum of 1,200% return rate and soared to heaven, and Yappy immediately distributed the profits to investors and cut off investment.\n-You foolish organic beings who doubted me. You can no longer trade with me.\n“Oh, oh my, Yappy! We were wrong!”\n“Please have mercy on us, who are ignorant and foolish!”\nFor a while, there were more investors who begged him to invest again than customers who came to see the hammer at TTG Guild headquarters, but Yappy ignored them.\nAnd then he broke another piece of good news and achieved a high return rate.\n-Will you support TTG Guild Foundation?\nThey made a historic worst unfair deal by donating nineteen trillion won of hedge fund returns to TTG Guild Foundation, and they were able to become investors again.\n-12% of the target amount reached.\nBut it was still far away. The final plan that Heto, the God of Iron and Blacksmithing, and his Holy Knight Yappy were planning was still far away.\nThe Jilin coup d’etat left two legends.\nThe emergence of a legendary hacker Deus Ex Machina who hacked and paralyzed the US and Russian defense departments as well as using deepfake to disable the Jilin Republic.\nAnd the dramatic revival and legendary profit surge of a hedge fund that seemed to collapse due to the war crisis.\nOf course, both of them were Yakt Spinner himself.\nOne day after a series of events came to an end, Leon began to sort out the evaluation sheets of the knight trainees who had completed their basic training for about a month.\nThe academy trainees had their own characteristics, but they repeated only basic training for a month: swordsmanship, shieldsmanship and spearmanship.\nTheir riding skills were not enough to become cavalrymen, but at least they wouldn’t fall off while running.\n‘I need to connect them with the gods soon.’\nOriginally, they would have had to go through a process of faith after receiving education as an apprentice priest or a knight.\n‘There is no time.’\nWho knows when those villains will interfere again? Although it is still at the stage of speculation about the identity of the gate, it is clear that demons are involved.\nAs the Gods said they would exceptionally simplify the process, their guidance would be somewhat influenced.\n‘Han Ha-ri.’\nShe is one of the young ones who has both talents and she was born with fire energy and attracted attention from God of War and Fire.\nShe has a good and pure nature. Leon also paid attention to her.\n‘Han Soo-ho.’\nHe has a cautious personality but has a strong will when needed. He has an excellent talent for protecting others as his name suggests.\nHe is second to none in swordsmanship but his shieldsmanship is also remarkable and he fulfilled one of the virtues of a knight.\nHis unique skill is also defense enhancement so he might be compatible with Goddess of Life and Abundance. If he holds Georgic’s hammer──\n“Hmph.”\nThere is no choice. It is up to the hammer to choose its owner. Whether he has the qualifications to be recognized by the sacred object or not is another matter.\nHe might not see his successor for the rest of his life but Leon thought he could do that.\n‘Kim Jae-hyuk.’\nHe is a boy who uses a spear as his main weapon but he is a surprisingly stable type apart from his fierce spearmanship.\nHe also looked through the profiles of other knight trainees and saw a girl.\n‘Chen So-yeon, was it?’\nShe is the granddaughter of the strongest swordsman in this country and one of the few talents who silently completed the basic training for a month.\nShe has a surprisingly stubborn and orthodox personality so she is suitable for the knight’s subject. But…\n‘Greed…Is it.’\nThe next successor of the best guild in the country came to TTG Guild just to join. There is no naive thought that she was fascinated by the power of the gods. Most of the trainees were like that, but she looked impatient.\nLeon recalled a familiar face from her appearance.\n“She looks like him…”\nHe was reminded of someone who was cold and blunt──\n「You killed him, Your Majesty. You are the greatest king in Lionheart history.」\n“Hoo…”\nLeon sighed dryly and made a bitter expression.\n“It’s too late.”\nHe turned his eyes to work as if trying to forget his thoughts, and it was right then.\n“Hmm?!\nLeon’s senses captured all movements within 30 km in all directions.\nWhat he has been paying attention to lately is Georgic’s hammer, the sacred object that emits powerful sacred power just by existing and who it will choose as its owner.\nAnd just now the sacred object showed some movement.\nLeon hurriedly ran out to the training ground where the hammer was. And there──\n“This is… unexpected.”\nVery slightly. It was so vague that it was hard to say that he moved it, but compared to the previous challengers, it was incomparable.\n‘The hammer itself’ judged the suitable person. He saw Leon and rambled.\n“Yo, Your Majesty! No, that is…It was break time, so I just tried it once…!”\nThe one who moved the hammer a little bit. He was──",

      "content": "Chapter 72: New Trainee\nEarly in the morning, when tractors usually come and go, there are four-legged beasts running on the ground without hesitation.\n-Clack clack!\nFarmer Choi Young-gam greeted them with a smile at the sound of the rough breathing and loud hoofbeats of the horses.\n“Oh, Your Majesty. You’re full of energy this morning.”\nLeon stopped in front of Choi Young-gam, who took off his hat and bowed slightly.\n“Old man Choi, you’re working hard early in the morning.”\n“I came to catch some bugs. Do you want to have a drink with the students?”\n“It’s riding training.”\n“I see.”\nChoi Young-gam, a priest of Demera, the goddess of life and abundance, was happy to see the temple growing day by day.\nHe felt helpless when he saw his land rotting without bending his waist, but now he was so happy.\nAll this happened after he came here. Choi Young-gam bowed his head again with gratitude toward Leon, who started to run again.\nThe scarecrow he hung behind him seemed to bow with him.\nLeon, who ran with more than 44 students and horses early in the morning, started to teach the students at a nearby open space.\n“There are many skills in riding, but the most important thing is to become friends with your horse. The ones you can rely on in the battlefield are your comrades next to you, and your horse is your closest comrade.”\nKim Jae-hyuk raised his hand at Leon’s words.\n“Your Majesty, how can we be friends with horses that don’t understand human language?”\n“That’s a reasonable question. The scholars of the empire said that they were the masters of beasts, not friends.”\nLeon made Stallion walk slowly and looked around at the students and horses who were staring at him.\n“Horses are smarter than you think. But at the same time, they are also very timid.”\nStallion stopped in front of Kim Jae-hyuk’s horse as he walked slowly. Then Kim Jae-hyuk’s horse did something unexpected.\n“Uh, uh?”\nKim Jae-hyuk’s horse lowered its neck softly. Not only that, it bent its legs and lay down in front of Leon and Stallion, as if bowing.\n“Why is this guy doing this?”\nLeon said to everyone in front of Kim Jae-hyuk, who was confused.\n“Stallion is a being that can be called the king of horses. Kim Jae-hyuk’s horse obeyed Stallion’s authority and lowered itself.”\nIt was natural. Stallion was a divine beast, and its existence was at the top of the hierarchy among horses.\nThe horses of the students would all obey Stallion’s authority.\n“However, you have to be close enough to reverse this hierarchy with your horse. It must be willing to challenge spears and swords for the rider on its back.”\nLeon gestured and Stallion snorted. Then Kim Jae-hyuk’s horse stood up stiffly.\n“Horses are timid, but they will gladly charge at beasts if they are with their riders. Why do you think that is?”\nChen So-yeon raised her hand.\n“Is it because they trust their riders?”\n“That’s right. Whether it’s a beast or a densely packed infantry with spears and swords, the horse throws itself into it because it believes that its rider on its back will solve it.”\nBuild such a trust relationship, a relationship that can entrust your life on the battlefield.\n“From today on, you will ride your horse for two hours every day and spend time with it. You also have to learn how to wield a lance while riding.”\n“Your Majesty, does that mean you’re taking two hours off our daily training?”\nIt was Kim Jae-hyuk’s question. Leon hit him hard.\n“Fool! Why do you reduce training when you can just sleep two hours less? When I was a knight, I didn’t sleep for two hours a day!”\nThere he goes again. Back in my day~.\nIf someone else had said it, they would have laughed it off as yeah, sure~. But they had to admit it when Leon said it.\nThey had been in the army for a month, but they had never seen Leon lie.\n“And there will be a new student added.”\n“Yes?”\n“At this time?”\nThe students tilted their heads at Leon’s words. All those who could come from the academy had already come. They were those who gave up the draft offer from the guilds and came here.\nIn other words, those who did not come here had already finished their salary negotiations with other guilds.\nIf they want to tear up their contracts and come to TTG Guild now, they would have to pay a huge penalty.\n“This person will train with you from now on and challenge the knight’s title in the future.”\nThump thump, a rider came from over the ridge toward them.\nThe horse walked on the ground as it pleased, and the rider swayed and tried to calm the horse somehow.\nUnlike the young students who quickly became familiar and moved their bodies, he had a sad expression that showed his age.\nHe walked for a long time and finally bowed awkwardly in front of Leon and the students.\n“TTG Guild first generation recruit Koo Dae-sung. I look forward to working with you.”\nThe man’s expression looked insecure.\nTTG Guild first generation recruit Koo Dae-sung looked at the second generation recruits who were approaching their graduation ceremony and felt nostalgic.\nThey were like that a month ago. Their rank, which they thought would be D forever, rose to C and they could clearly feel their growth.\nAbove all, the moment they cleared the orange gate with the help of a knight, which was considered impossible to attack, was a joyous one.\nOf course, the gate that Koo Dae-sung and the generation recruits cleared was not an ordinary gate, but a variable gate with demons in it.\nKoo Dae-sung looked back on his situation.\nHe was a modern man with no qualifications and a high school diploma. In his twenties, when it was natural to have a lot of specs, he had a card called awakened.\nAwakened. Hunter. The superhumans of this era.\nBut Koo Dae-sung had no talent. The title of perennial D rank was humiliating even among hunters.\nHunters his age usually advance to C rank. Even if they don’t have a unique skill, they can at least go out to orange gates.\nOn the other hand, Koo Dae-sung couldn’t even access the orange gate as a porter.\nKoo Dae-sung had a goal while moving from one rented room to another. A goal he wanted to achieve.\nS-rank hunters. The heroes who live a brilliant and cool life. The real heroes who receive people’s praise and clear the gates.\nIt’s something that perennial D-rank hunter Koo Dae-sung can’t even dream of. But──\n‘If I follow his teachings, can’t I become stronger?’\nKoo Dae-sung’s life has been going well lately.\nHe met a survivor from another world by chance. Thanks to him, his rank went up and he was able to get the precious orc warrior’s heart potion.\nHe became strong enough to lift tons of iron easily, fight one-on-one with orcs, and do things that were impossible for him before.\nHe didn’t deny that meeting Leon was a great fortune. He could also make enough money here.\nBut he wasn’t satisfied with this situation.\nHe became stronger by consuming the orc warrior’s heart and the blessed crops. But that was it.\nHis growth stopped without increasing, and he couldn’t guarantee that something like the orc warrior’s heart would happen again.\nBeing a perennial D-rank and becoming a C-rank doesn’t make him that much stronger and he felt that when he saw the academy students.\nThe students that Leon brought as knight candidates had dazzling talents.\nIt was like heaven to Koo Dae-sung, even if Leon was dissatisfied but they were B-rank at that age…\nThey had unique skills and could easily do things which were impossible for Koo Dae-sung.\nSuch dazzling, fantastical talents.\nThe world they live in is too different. Unlike Koo Dae-sung, who decided to enlist to try to raise his rank once, they wanted to become knights from the beginning and their growth rate was incomparable to him.\nHe was envious and wanted to become a knight like them.\nAs Leon said, unlike soldiers who only have to do one thing well, they are superhumans who can do anything.\n‘O Goddess Arianna. O God Petos. Thank you again today.’\nKoo Dae-sung thanked the two gods first and suddenly remembered the goddess of life and abundance that the farmers worshiped.\nThe one who purifies the land contaminated by miasma and feeds the believers with blessed crops. There is no hierarchy among the gods, but is there anyone more important than this in the world at this point?\nThe farmers are so grateful to Demera and offer a tenth of their crops to the altar for a reason.\n‘Is it a disrespectful thought?’\nTo appreciate Goddess Demera more than others.\nKoo Dae-sung thanked Demera separately and went back to his dormitory. He passed by the training ground where a solemn aura was emanating and suddenly remembered the thing inside.\n“There was a hammer, right?”\nThe hammer of the Holy Knight Georgic was said to be an epic item with tremendous power because it was a relic itself.\nThere were many challengers, but Koo Dae-sung never thought of lifting the hammer.\nHe knew his place.\nHe dreamed high, but he was pessimistic about his place. He thought it wouldn’t even budge anyway.\n“Is there no one…?”\nHe didn’t even look at the hammer because he didn’t want to be humiliated. Koo Dae-sung realized that there was no one around and sneaked up to the hammer.\n“Wow…”\nThe appearance of the hammer was really solemn and noble.\nIt felt like the impurities were washed away just by looking at it, and the hammer stuck firmly to the ground.\nThe head of the hammer, of course, and even the handle was beautifully engraved with patterns.\n“What if I try it once…”\nKoo Dae-sung touched the handle of the hammer. He lifted the hammer with all his strength from the beginning, but──\nSqueak!\nThe hammer twitched. Only enough to feel a little bit of air.\n“Ugh…!”\nKoo Dae-sung let go of his hand and the sound of the hammer hitting the ground was loud.\n“Huh…! Is it still not working?”\nWell, I know my place… Koo Dae-sung was about to turn around in disappointment when it happened.\n“This is… quite surprising.”\nIt was Leon’s voice.\nAfter the Great Change in 2002, countless gates appeared on Earth.\nThey each have their own concept and rank, but among them, there are some that are priority targets for subjugation.\nThe first priority is high-rank gates.\nThe higher the rank, the higher the risk of dungeon break, so it’s a matter of course.\nThe second is gates that open in wastelands.\nAfter the Great Change, humanity lost as many wastelands as its population.\nNothing can grow in land contaminated by miasma, and people can’t live there either, so it’s natural to stop contamination itself.\nBut among all these threats, there is an exception that becomes a top priority for clearing as soon as it is observed.\nIn this case, the government takes the lead and issues a ‘conscription order’ to forcibly mobilize hunters.\nThe US and Japan have already notified that they will dispatch attack teams. The problem is not that.\n“Why now…”\nOh Kang-hyuk, chairman of the Association, sighed at the repeated reports and identical observation information. The observation equipment was too accurate to be mistaken, even with cross-verification from neighboring countries.\n“Dragon Palace… It’s practically confirmed.”\nSea gate AKA Dragon Palace.\nGate appearances are usually observed on land. Naturally, people expected gates to only appear on land, and they didn’t care about the sea at all when there were no satellites to observe gates after the Great Change.\nBut 25 years ago, the world’s first sea gate appeared in Tokyo Bay.\nThe Tokyo Bay gate, which was left alone until dungeon break occurred, not only annihilated Tokyo Bay but also contaminated the entire coast and turned marine life into monsters.\nIt was the worst gate disaster in history, and Japan had to waste 15 years to end this disaster.\nThat’s why Dragon Palace gate is a priority for neighboring countries to cooperate and attack together in an international situation where national self-interest prevails.\nHe had already received reports from America and Japan that they would dispatch attack teams. The problem wasn’t that either.\n“Every year… there’s a storm warning. This year seems especially strong, but that’s not the problem.”\nOh Kang-hyuk turned on the news. The weather information that was broadcasted as an emergency bulletin on public broadcasting.\n[Yes, I’m now in front of Ulleungdo Island. Typhoon Nabi, which was expected to move to the Pacific Ocean, suddenly changed its course and is moving slowly toward Ulleungdo Island.]\n[Nabi, which is expected to be the biggest typhoon of the year, is surpassing the record of Cicada in 2003 with a speed of 64.5m per second, and serious damage is expected for the residents of Ulleungdo Island.]\nA storm warning that happens every year seemed especially strong this year, but that wasn’t the problem.\nThe direction of the Dragon Palace gate and the typhoon overlapped.\n“Gather the hunters. Urgently! And…”\nOh Kang-hyuk added.\n“Contact Leon, the Lionheart King of TTG Guild, as a top priority.”\nOh Kang-hyuk instinctively felt that Leon, the mysterious king who performs miracles and receives the love of the gods, was the only solution.",

      "content": "Chapter 73: This Is Discrimination\nJuly, when the hot summer begins, at the TTG Guild headquarters, the second graduation ceremony is being prepared.\n“Your Majesty, have you arrived?”\nThe ones preparing for the graduation ceremony are Queen Beatrice and Yappy. They were in charge of the whole process of the graduation ceremony for the second batch of recruits.\n“Did you come back late last night? Did you finish the test raid well?”\n“Yes, it was Orc Gate. The second batch of recruits also passed the test brilliantly. But…”\n“But?”\nBeatrice whispered in Leon’s ear with a slightly awkward expression.\n“Sir Yappy was quite ruthless in dealing with the orcs. Some of the recruits were scared.”\n“Hmm… I see. But, it’s not a problem. If it’s not inefficient enough to discuss, isn’t it natural to be angry at the beasts?”\n“That makes sense.”\nBeatrice compared the orcs to demons and immediately agreed.\n“We decided to simplify the graduation ceremony and leave the progress to Sir Yappy.”\n“Wouldn’t it be okay for you to do it?”\n“If I do it, the trainees will… be in a difficult situation.”\nBeatrice smiled bitterly behind the veil and Leon nodded silently.\nShe certainly had a charm that contained the essence of corruption, and she could seduce people with just her breath.\nEven if she covered her face with a veil, if she encouraged the soldiers from a close distance, their will would be broken.\n“Lord Spinner will do well.”\nA week ago, he said that some kind of war fund or something had collapsed due to the war, but it seems that he has recovered since he didn’t hear about it again.\nLeon had also been a resident of this Earth, but he lived in a time that was far from finance. The financial crisis he remembered was the IMF at best. Do I need to say more?\nLeon looked at Yappy, who was pinning badges on the second batch of recruits at the graduation ceremony, and shrugged his shoulders.\n“I guess Lord Spinner is more adapted to Earth than me.”\n“Your Majesty, wouldn’t you have adapted less than me?”\n“Why do you say that? I came here two months earlier than you.”\nBeatrice smiled and showed him a rollable smartphone. It was the latest rollable smartphone. He couldn’t even adapt to a touch-type smartphone and made Ha-ri hold his phone for him so he had no choice but to envy Beatrice.\n“You seem to have adapted quickly. I’m relieved. You’re better than me.”\n“How can I be better than you when you’re trying to adapt yourself to Earth?”\nLeon took the rollable smartphone from Beatrice and shook his head, wondering how he could use this thing to surf the internet and watch videos.\n“What about Lord Spinner?”\n“He said it was too primitive a communication tool and hacked into the communication station.”\n“…I wonder if this is compatible with justice.”\nHe also made an illegal modification of the Wi-Fi amplifier installed in the TTG Guild headquarters. It seemed that it was quite rumored among tourists.\n“By the way, what happened to ‘that guy’?”\n“He’s still being silent but he’s holding on pretty well. It’s thanks to the remaining power of the evil god.”\n“If you need it, I’ll help you. How can he stand it if you peel off his face?”\nBeatrice shook her head politely and refused.\n“I can’t ask such a thing from an honorable knight so I’ll do the dirty work since I’m surprisingly good at it but I promise you that I will obtain valuable information from that thing.”\nThe Queen of Magic did not bother to say how creepy the process would be.\n“It’s a shame that I can’t watch it.”\nShe laughed sinisterly and Leon also laughed as if answering.\nThe laughter of the two sounded so wicked that it was scary to see.\nThe Dragon Palace appeared.\nUnlike the gates on land, when a dungeon break occurs in the sea, it is almost impossible to solve.\nNo matter how powerful a hunter is, he has activity restrictions in the sea.\nAnd if you think about marine life contaminated by miasma, it’s hard to solve the aftermath of a dungeon break.\nThat’s why the Hunter Association has the right to urgently conscript powerful hunters when a sea gate is confirmed.\n“Have you arrived, Hunter Lee Yong-wan?”\n“It’s been a long time, Chairman.”\nLee Yong-wan, guild master of Phoenix Guild, came to Hunter Association with his vice guild master Ha Yuri after receiving conscription order.\n“Hunter Ha Yuri also came.”\n“Hello.”\nHa Yuri bowed her head as she looked around with a mask on.\n“But I don’t see anyone else?”\nChairman Oh Gang-hyuk shrugged at Yong-wan’s question.\n“This time, East Sea Gate will receive support from the United States. Therefore, other guilds will remain as reserve raiders in case of anything.”\nLee Yong-wan’s mouth twisted at the chairman’s words.\n“Do we have to be the first conscription target? There are many other great guilds.”\n“It’s hard to find a guild as great as Phoenix Guild.”\n“The aftermath of Jeju Island Gate is still there.”\n“It’s been almost a month, so I believe you’ve recovered. Hehehe.”\n‘Damn bastard.’\nLee Yong-wan realized the chairman’s intention. This is a penalty for the mischief he made at the Hunan Plain Gate.\nHe was the most active in the tax exemption bill for large guilds, and he took action. It was fair to say that it was a warning to everyone.\n‘Now you’re coming on strong.’\nIron Oh Gang-hyuk was a first-generation hunter who had once been a powerhouse on par with the Divine Sword Guild’s Berserker and the Blue Star Guild’s Infinite Sword, but had become the oldest and weakest member of the faction.\nHe is a civil servant who has to struggle in front of the 10 guilds that have grown too much.\nThat’s why he came out so strong against Phoenix Guild, one of the 10 guilds.\n“Maybe you won’t send us alone. Will you show us your trump card?”\n“Trump card? He is not someone who can be evaluated by someone like me.”\n‘That’s right.’\nIf it was his previous self, he would have thought that the chairman had made a secret deal with Leon or brought him into his power but he saw the arrogance of the Holy Knights at Jeju Island Gate.\nGeorgic, Leon…The saints who claim that they have been chosen by God are not those who obey the orders of humans.\n“Ugh~”\n“Well, it’s your own fault, isn’t it?”\nHa Yuri said as she sighed and sat down. Yong-wan looked at her with displeasure, but Yuri just shrugged her shoulders.\nAnd while the two were waiting in the waiting room, one of the staff members ran over and reported.\n“Chairman, he’s coming.”\n“Hmm…! I see.”\nAt that, Chairman Oh Gang-hyuk checked if his suit and tie were out of place and even took out a hair comb to fix his hair.\n‘What?’\nAnyone would think he was going on a blind date. What’s all this fuss about? Yong-wan thought so while the chairman looked at him with a glance.\n“What, what is it?”\n“Hunter Lee Yong-wan, if you don’t mind, can you fix your clothes a little?”\n“…Why?”\n“Because it would be rude to him who will visit soon.”\n“Huh?”\nWhat is this bastard talking about…Yong-wan’s expression became weird. Then, as the door opened with a clatter, a blond handsome man came in with the guidance of an employee while Kim Jin-soo and Han Ha-ri followed him like attendants.\nChairman Oh Gang-hyuk ran up to him in a hurry.\n“Thank you for your visit, Your Majesty.”\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart. He looked down at Chairman Oh Gang-hyuk who bowed his waist and said arrogantly.\n“If you make me move my royal body, you should have a reason worthy of it.”\n“Of course. I am very grateful that you have moved your heavy footsteps.”\nLeon accepted the chairman’s sincere greeting and sat down naturally in the seat of honor. He heard a sound from beside him as he got up. It was Ha Yuri.\n“Why are you getting up?”\n“I thought I should?”\nYong-wan frowned as he saw Ha Yuri get up as soon as Leon arrived. It wasn’t just Yuri. The chairman also didn’t sit down and stood next to Leon.\nThe only one sitting in this place was Yong-wan.\n-Aren’t you getting up?\nEveryone’s eyes were on Yong-wan. No, why, what? Is that guy a king here as well as the other world?\n-Really not getting up?\nYong-wan couldn’t stand for 10 seconds and got up. Only after he got up did Leon open his mouth.\n“Report.”\nHe treated him thoroughly like a subordinate, which was amazing, but no one was able to tackle it.\n“Yes, Your Majesty. Last night at around 11 o’clock we discovered the appearance of a gate on the east coast.”\nThe chairman personally showed the data and pointed to the map of the east coast.\n“It’s 8 km south of Ulleungdo, completely inside the sea and borders Japan’s maritime territory.”\nAnd this is cross-information observed by Japan’s maritime force and the US fleet that there is a gate in the sea.\n“If it’s in the sea, just go out to sea and raid it. You made me move my royal body because you couldn’t even take care of my garden.”\n“I’m sorry, Your Majesty. I’m ashamed, but raiding the gate is secondary to reaching the gate.”\nThe chairman added weather information.\n“A typhoon is approaching. Unfortunately, it is scheduled to pass through the direction where the gate is located and it’s such a strong typhoon that we can barely approach it with a warship.”\n“What about waiting for the typhoon to pass?”\n“Time is tight. Unlike other gates, Dragon Palace Gate… The gate that appears in the sea is difficult to raid and requires quick resolution.”\nBut it takes four days for the typhoon to pass. This is an unbearable risk.\nIf the first raid team fails, there may be a dungeon break before sending the second raid team due to the tight time.\nAnd a dungeon break that occurs in the sea will lead to a disaster, so it must be raided quickly and perfectly.\n“You know that you are betting on the prestige of the nation. But, you seem to think of me as a gardener of this country, like Cheongju or Jeju Island.”\n“Never…! How can I take you lightly?”\n“Then what is it? Even if this small land has its own heroes, why do you look for me first?”\nOf course, Oh Gang-hyuk could have conscripted other hunters before Leon.\nIn the case of Dragon Palace Gate, the Association has the right to force conscription, so it would be possible to mobilize domestic strongest guilds such as Blue Star Guild or Divine Sword Guild’s Guild.\nOf course, whether these guilds would comply or not is a separate issue.\nYong-wan was looking forward to how the chairman would persuade this difficult guy.\n“Your Majesty, this is an opportunity to elevate the honor of Lionheart! Please give us your heroic order!”\nLeon didn’t hate the chairman’s honey-coated tongue and laughed softly and opened his mouth.\n“Well, okay. But, moving my royal body is heavy. You should prepare a proper tribute.”\n“Do you have anything you want?”\nChairman Oh Gang-hyuk glanced at Leon. If this survivor wants something, he will support it if possible, but it is also important to figure out what he wants.\n“The king doesn’t count coins. Discuss the details with Lord Spinner.”\n“Hmm…”\nHe naturally handed over a blank check.\nOh Gang-hyuk smiled bitterly and thought it wasn’t easy.\nLeon’s participation in the East Sea Gate raid was decided.\nHe had raided numerous gates, but this was his first time in a special situation like Dragon Palace Gate.\nRaid teams were dispatched from each country of Korea, Japan, and the United States, and even warships were mobilized.\nOnly a limited number of people could enter from each guild, so Leon carefully selected participants.\n“This raid will be carried out on a small scale due to the nature of the gate. From now on, those who are called will come out in order.”\nThe first one to be called was Yacht Spinner, who showed versatile responses in any situation. He was the top priority.\nNext were Han Soo-ho and Kim Jae-hyuk. They were knight candidates, so it was natural that they were called.\nThen came names of the trainees including Koo Dae-sung, a new trainee. There were ten knight trainees in total and twenty soldiers were also called.\n“Huh?”\nThe ones who questioned first were Ha-ri and So-yeon.\n“Um… Your Majesty. Among those you called, there isn’t a single ‘woman’?”\nIs it gender discrimination? Aww~ Ha-ri knew that Leon looked like a discriminatory person but he really wasn’t.\nEven if there was a distinction between women and men, who would make such a distinction in the organization of a raiding party like this──\n“If you put a woman on a boat, it will sink.”\n“???”\nIt was a very discriminatory reason.",

      "content": "Chapter 74\nIt has been 14 hours since the Dragon Palace Gate was discovered. The Hunter Association quickly prepared for the attack on the Dragon Palace Gate.\nThe attack on the Dragon Palace Gate is a national emergency. The Hunter Association received a swift order from the top, and warships were mobilized to attack the gate in the middle of the sea.\nIn Gyeongsangdo Donghae Port 1st Fleet Helicopter Landing Zone the Black Hawk helicopters of the Korean military landed with their rotor blades spinning fiercely.\nThe people who got off there were not soldiers, but a group of civilians.\n“You can get off, Your Majesty.”\nThe first to get off were Kim Jin-soo, a chief of the Hunter Association, and Han Ha-ri, an agent. The two respectfully escorted Leon.\nAfter that, Lee Yong-wan and the hunters of the Firebird Guild, and the members of TTG Guild came down one by one.\n“It’s a good vehicle. I should have a few of them. It’s even better because it can carry horses.”\n‘Helicopters? No way…’\n“The chairman says we can give you some. Would six be enough? We’re sorry we didn’t tell you in advance.”\n‘You’re giving them away?!’\nLee Yong-wan was stunned by Kim Jin-soo’s words that he would give away hundreds of millions of won worth of military helicopters.\n‘It’s not Kim Jin-soo’s decision. It’s an order from the top.’\nThere was no way a mere head of department had the authority to move helicopters.\nSeeing how the chairman handled it, it was obvious that Oh Kang-hyuk, the chairman of the Association, had told Leon to take whatever he wanted.\n“Your Majesty, this model is a bit old-fashioned. There’s a new model that’s just arrived in our country. It’s called Surion… It’s nothing, but if you could take a commemorative photo and say a few words when you receive it──”\n‘What?’\n“That’s fine. I like foreign ones better. The big Chinook or something. It can carry horses, so it’s perfect.”\n“Yes…”\nHa-ri patted Kim Jin-soo’s shoulder, who looked gloomy.\nThe TTG Guild and the Firebird Guild headed straight to the 1st Fleet Command. There, hundreds of people, including commanders, captains, sergeants and soldiers, lined up in advance as if they had received a prior notice.\n“Salute! Welcome to the 1st Fleet Command of the Republic of Korea Navy!”\n“We are honored to meet Leon Dragonia Lionheart!”\n-Bam bam bam~ Bam bam bam! Bam bam bam~!\nA loud welcome and congratulations. No matter how much hunters were treated as half-heroes in modern Earth, there was a distinction between civilians and military.\nUnless it was a continent torn apart by 50 countries or a hunter dictatorship, there was no such hospitality in a sane developed country.\n“Hmm, are you the commander of this base?”\n“Yes! I am Choi Jae-sung, the commander of the 1st Fleet!”\nCommander Choi did not make any rudeness in front of Leon thanks to his thorough prior warning. But he was not so polite just because of the order.\n“It is an honor to meet you, Your Majesty! My granddaughter was cured of leukemia after eating Goddess Demera crops. I would like to convey my gratitude.”\nChoi Jae-sung’s granddaughter was a terminally ill patient who had been waiting for her death for a long time due to leukemia.\nBut after eating the blessed crops and seeing his granddaughter cured of leukemia, he cried and worshiped God for the first time.\n“I see. If you are grateful for receiving Her grace, you are also my brother. Always be thankful and worship Her.”\n“It is an honor!”\nIt had been three months since Leon came to Earth and his influence was spreading throughout this country.\n“Then before we brief you on this operation, let me introduce you to the allied forces who will fight with us.”\nChoi took the visiting hunters to a joint gymnasium. It was one of the few places in the somewhat small Donghae Port facility that could accommodate hundreds of people.\nThere were foreigners of various colors waiting for TTG and Firebird there.\n“Are they from the US attack team?”\nChoi nodded at Lee Yong-wan’s question.\n“Yes, they flew straight with the Navy Air Force transport plane. It’s strange.”\nIt was strange, as Choi said.\nThe Dragon Palace Gate was a gate that occurred in the East Sea. The adjacent countries involved in this sea were Korea and Japan.\nNo matter how much Korea was a military ally of the US, did they have to send an attack team? It’s not like Korea and Japan were short of hunter resources.\n“The Navy team came from Sasebo and they seem to be taking it quite seriously.”\nThe US participation was still incomprehensible, but they had to let it go. Anyway, if the Korea-US-Japan joint attack team sends two S-class each, there will be no shortage of power.\nA tall blonde-haired man approached the Korean hunters.\nHe had blond hair and blue eyes like Leon, but his atmosphere was closer to a scholar than a noble young man.\n“Huh?”\n“Reynold Sherman?!”\nThe Korean hunters who recognized him were surprised. Wasn’t he the US Magic Tower Master?\nWhy did such a big shot come to Korea?\nReynold Sherman smiled at the reaction towards him and he confidently introduced himself.\n“Nice to meet you, Korea hunters. I am Reynold Sherman, the Magic Tower Master who was invited for this gate attack──”\nThe introduction was cut off as Reynold pupils trembled and his gaze was directed at a blond-haired man.\n“FUC—“\n* * * *\n[Go to Korea right now!]\nUS Magic Tower Branch Top Floor. The Wisdom Jewel, which was carefully placed in the office of the Magic Tower Master, suddenly said that.\n“Korea…what are you talking about?”\n[Yes! There’s something you have to do there! You can’t do it alone, so I’ll go with you!]\n“…”\nReynold was fascinated by the knowledge that the Wisdom Jewel bestowed on him, but he hesitated to answer the words to go to Korea.\nIt was because he had already been there once and met a ‘terrifying existence’.\n“That… Leon──”\n[You bastard! Don’t say that name with your mouth! Damn it! I need to clean my ears!]\nLeon had become the one whose name should not be spoken in front of him.\n‘Why are you freaking out…?’\nWhy do you want me to go to Korea? Isn’t it inconsistent with your words and actions?\nAs if reading his question, the Wisdom Jewel spoke as if to reassure him.\n[Don’t worry. I’ll tell you how to make an artifact that can completely hide the demon magic. If you have the ingredients, you can make it too.]\n“Is that so?”\nDoes that mean he can escape from the detection of the Lion King?\n“What do I need to make it?”\n[Unicorn horn, phoenix feather, dragon claw fragment──]\nUnicorn horn price 3.4 billion. Phoenix feather price 2.1 billion. Dragon claw fragment no stock. And there were plenty of other items of unique, legendary grade materials.\n“…Great Being?”\n[What?]\n“These are not items that can be obtained right away…”\n[Then there’s no choice. It’s a bit inferior, but if you have this, you can easily make it!]\nThe Wisdom Jewel, as a holder of great knowledge, came up with a solution on the spot. Seeing this, he could say that he was more competent than the previous demon in charge of the Wisdom Jewel.\n“That’s definitely something I can get from the Magic Tower’s warehouse right away! You’re amazing, Great Being!”\n[But it’s inferior, so it’s not very durable. But well… No matter how small Korea is, you won’t necessarily meet him if you go there.]\n“That’s right. It’s not like Leon is the only hunter in Korea.”\n[Kyakyakyak! I was born with bad luck!]\nThe two smart villains’ reasoning was too rational. It’s not like Leon is the only hunter in Korea and that the chances of meeting him right away are slim.\nBut sometimes──\n“Be polite, spellcaster.”\nThere is also an existence that is the irrational itself.\n[Ouch-shit!]\n* * * *\nReynold and the Wisdom Jewel who met Leon trembled at this irrational misfortune. Reynold quickly asked the Wisdom Jewel for advice.\n‘What, what do we do, Great Being! He’s right in front of us! Right in front of us?!’\n[Calm, calm, calm down! If he was in a bad mood, he would have cut your neck off without hesitation! He hasn’t noticed us yet!]\nThat’s right, it was because of the artifact that the Wisdom Jewel had prepared in advance. He didn’t think he would meet him in Korea, but it was a ring-shaped artifact that hid his magic as a minimum insurance.\n‘As expected of the Archdemon of Wisdom! I trusted you!’\nIt was then. When Reynold was fiddling with his lifeline, the magic ring, he felt the ring wearing away.\n‘Great Being!!!’\n‘Calm down! It’s being worn out by his holy power!!’\nReynold couldn’t tell the Wisdom Jewel, who was screaming, to calm down first. It was inevitable that his only lifeline was wearing away in real time.\n[We, we have to back off! Get away quickly! Get away from his holy power!]\nReynold showed his greatest wit and pretended to be calm.\n“I’m glad to meet you, Your Majesty. Your reputation is high even in faraway countries. I wanted to meet you.”\nReynold tried to offer a handshake, but hesitated for fear of being exposed if he touched his skin.\n‘Damn it! This will make him suspicious!’\nReynold glanced at Leon with an uneasy look, but he smiled rather satisfied.\n“You know your place well, spellcaster.”\nWhere did he hit such a satisfying point?\nLeon passed him and headed to his place, while Reynold barely calmed down his trembling gums.\n‘Let’s run away. I believe the Great Being will agree too!’\n[No, no… This is important. We have to do it…]\nMother fucker! Why did such a low-level devil get attached to the Wisdom Jewel!\nReynold had no choice but to listen to the briefing quietly while cursing.\nHa-ri diligently organized the information she received from the briefing as an Association employee.\nShe couldn’t participate in this attack team, so she wanted to give them as much help as possible.\n“Ugh… His Majesty also said… Women should never board a ship…”\nCommander Choi admired Leon, but he had a puzzled expression on his face when he said that women would bring bad luck if they boarded a ship.\nHe tried hard to say ‘It’s because he’s from medieval times… It’s a cultural difference…’.\nThe Kwanggaeto Daewang ship that will be used for this operation had no female crew members from the beginning.\nThe navy had to get the maximum efficiency out of the limited space, so they couldn’t afford to prepare separate bathrooms and bedrooms for women soldiers.\n“Emergency food and… combat food that can be cooked without fire…”\nShe was heading to the supply warehouse of Donghae Port to get this and that when she saw a hunter carrying a large backpack in front of the supply warehouse guarded by navy guards.\n“Huh? Hunter Koo Dae-sung?”\n“Agent Han?”\nHa-ri met Dae-sung and wondered.\n“Why are you carrying luggage? This is something we should do…”\n“No, no. I have to do this kind of chore.”\nDae-sung’s words were not incomprehensible. It was customary for Man-at-Arms (soldiers) to do chores in the TTG Guild but Dae-sung’s position was different now.\n“Hunter, you’re now a knight trainee. His Majesty wouldn’t have asked you to do chores.”\n“I’m not worthy of that…”\nDae-sung shrugged his shoulders and made an awkward expression.\nHe had trained with them for a few days after joining the trainees, but Dae-sung felt out of place among them.\nHe was weak and old compared to other trainees and they couldn’t understand why a soldier like him was chosen as a knight trainee.\n“It’s just that I got lucky and got a chance to lift the hammer.”\nDae-sung knew that he lifted the hammer the highest but that was because the hammer was revealed not long ago.\nThere were quite a few hunters who succeeded in moving the hammer slightly, which showed that there were many with potential on Earth.\nHe just happened to have an opportunity to lift the hammer earlier.\n“Hunter Koo Dae-sung, it was His Majesty who made you a trainee.”\n“That’s true, but?”\n“Then don’t you think His Majesty would think after hearing your worries?”\nHa-ri put down her backpack and pretended to be stern and snorted, then started imitating someone’s voice.\n“How dare you doubt this king’s will, you wretched thing? What right do you have to question the goddess’s will? You should just train as you are told!”\n“Uh, um… Agent Han. There…”\n“Stay still! His Majesty would also say. [That’s not good~ You’re too comfortable so you have so many thoughts. From now on, add four hours of training! I mean. I trained without sleeping!]”\nHa-ri, who was snorting at Dae-sung, noticed that he was silently looking over her shoulder.\n“…”\n“…”\nAfter a moment of silence Ha-ri couldn’t stop her pupils from trembling and opened her lips.\n“Is he behind me?”\nNod.\nAnd then a cold voice from behind.\n“I’ve never seen such a rude thing. A lowly thing that speculates and imitates this king’s will?”\n“Eek…! I’m sorry! Please kill me!!”\nHa-ri fell flat on her face and Leon looked down at her coldly.\n‘This is bad!’\nWhy did he have to be behind me when I was imitating him!\nShe trembled at the scolding that would come from Leon, but soon heard a voice.\n“Tsk tsk, how did such a thing get his grace?”\n“Yes?”\nShe didn’t understand what he meant and slightly lifted her head.\n“Han Ha-ri.”\n“Yes, yes!”\n“Glorious news. One of the gods is interested in you.”\n“Yes?”\nHa-ri remembered what Leon had said once. When the training of the knight trainees was over, the gods would choose each of them.\nThe first step to becoming a Realm Knight was connecting with a god and that was what Leon was talking about now.\n“Which god?”\nThe goddess of light and justice, Arianna?\nThe god of war and fire, Petos?\nHa-ri hoped that whoever it was, it matched her personality well. But the name of the god that came out of Leon’s mouth was completely unexpected.\n“The holy god of the sea and waves, Poma, wants to make you his priestess.”\n“…Yes?”\n“You’ll have to join this expedition too.”\nLeon put his hand on Ha-ri’s shoulder and looked at her with a pitying eye but she couldn’t understand the meaning of his gaze.",

      "content": "Chapter 75: Han Ha-ri, Goddess\nof the Sea and Waves\nAfter confirming the East Sea Gate the departure was decided.\nThe flagship of the Korean First Fleet, Gwanggaeto the Great, and the Aegis destroyer Arleigh Burke-class dispatched from the US Seventh Fleet were ready to sail together.\n“Hmm … it’s a pretty big ship.”\nLeon looked at the East Sea, which was about to sail soon, from the stern of Gwanggaeto the Great.\nThe scenery was surprisingly clear and clean for a typhoon approaching. It must be the calm before the storm.\nHe was enjoying the sea view and calming his mind, when there was a slight noise around him.\n“Load everything including the rations! Load as many spare weapons as possible! What do the hunters from the US say?”\n“They’re doing their own thing. Should we switch the radio to a shared channel?”\n“What for? It’s useless once we enter the gate anyway.”\nLee Yong-wan and the Phoenix Guild hunters were busy moving. Indeed, they were professional. They were mostly low-level hunters and academy students who were about to graduate.\nOn the other hand, they were pros of gate raiding. They claimed to be one of the top 10 guilds in Korea. It would be rude to compare them with Leon or Yappy, who were out of standard Holy Knights.\n“I’ll contact Manager Park, so you guys do your own thing.”\nLee Yong-wan finished his instructions and came out to the stern. Then he ran into Leon and stopped.\n“You’re quite good at leading the charge.”\n“… Well, I’ve been rolling in this field for over 10 years.”\nHe still looked young, but he had 10 years of experience. Leon recalled his first impression of him.\n“Have you stopped that dirty trick?”\n“Dirty? … It’s a legitimate business activity. Your Majesty of the Middle Ages wouldn’t understand.”\nYeah, I don’t know.\nLeon died normally and was reborn.\nThe country where he was born as a child of a great noble was an honorable country, a righteous country, and a country that was cared for by the gods.\nThere, Leon could do right. He performed justice, kept his faith, and lived.\nSometimes he destroyed a messy neighboring country, sometimes he exterminated dirty beasts, and sometimes he buried barbarians.\nBut, all his actions were only for the light and justice.\n“You guys pursue money and only care about wealth and influence.”\n“Isn’t that what powerful people always do? Your Majesty is not much different.”\nLee Yong-wan knew that this world’s Lionheart King was using his power and divine miracles to expand his influence.\nHe had already brought a revolution to the domestic food market and made the Hunter Association his puppet.\nThen what’s the difference between TTG Guild and them? They just use more sophisticated methods.\n“No, they’re different. You guys and beasts are different from Lionheart.”\n“…”\nLeon shrugged off his eyes toward him.\n“Food and wealth are ultimately for making people rich. If you have infinite wealth, what does it mean to monopolize it alone?”\n“What does it mean if there is a medicine that can cure any disease but it is not bestowed on patients?”\n“It’s useless to pile up gold and jewels in a loveless world.”\n“…”\nLee Yong-wan looked at this man who was like a sage and unconsciously thought of a man. His name was mentioned right away.\n“What did you see from Sir Georgic?”\n“Suddenly?”\n“Not only Sir Georgic but also his knights. What did you feel from the soldiers of the kingdom?”\n“…”\nYong-wan recalled what happened at Jeju Island Gate.\nHe saw their courage and was saved by their sacrifice but that’s not because they were transcendent strongmen.\nThey fought against the immensely powerful beast gods, against the endless army of beasts for one reason.\n“Justice. You must follow justice only. It is the first phrase taught by Goddess Arianna.”\n“How childish is justice …”\n“Childish. Yeah, it would look like that to those who look at the world cynically and live calculatingly.”\nJustice is childish.\nGood deeds are losing money.\nSuch notions existed in his kingdom as well.\nThe humanists of the empire did so, and the wise magicians scoffed at it.\n“My boy, anyone can laugh and be cynical.”\n“Justice is childish, good deeds are not profitable, and living purely is foolish.”\n“But those who live unjustly cannot get anything.”\n“Those who live evilly may be wise but cannot be brave.”\n“Those who are not pure cannot love.”\nLeon gave this unjust man unusually much advice.\nGeorgic and his knights gave up their lives for their beliefs and they had to realize it.\nTheir sacrifice, their bravery and justice were valuable.\n“Prove it. Whether you guys deserved what the glorious knights and loyal soldiers saved.”\nIf not, I’ll punish you.\nAt Leon’s cold declaration, Lee Yong-wan swallowed his saliva and tensed up.\nAnd he also secretly …\n-Buuuuuuung!\nIt was then. On the deck, the sailors retrieved the ropes connected to the land, and the loud horn sound began to ring.\nThe ladder connected to the land was removed, the Korean flag was hung, and the tugboats adjusted the direction of the warship.\nGwanggaeto the Great, was ready to leave the port by cutting through the water and the US Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class Aegis ship followed suit.\n“Finally leaving.”\n“You hit the scheduled time exactly.”\nThe lecture time naturally ended. But it wasn’t such a bad time for Lee Yong-wan either.\nHe himself also deeply engraved their attitude of living with justice and goodness in his heart.\n“Your Majesty, if you don’t mind, can I repay you for what I owe you before … Huh?”\nIt was then that on the deck of Gwanggaeto the Great a strange cry was heard.\n-Aisha! Aisha!\n“TTG Guild?”\nStudents and soldiers carry something long on their shoulders and cross the deck to the stern. Someone was hanging on the pillar they were carrying.\n-Hey, this is something wrong! You said I was a goddess! This treatment is wrong!\n“Han Ha-ri…?”\nWhat are they doing? At Yong-wan’s gaze, Leon explained with a satisfied expression.\n“It’s a law that brings impurity if you bring a woman on board. But there is a way to make up for it.”\nAre you saying that you hang people on the masthead and offer them to the gods?\n“Why do you look at it like that? Thanks to the sacrifice of the goddess chosen by the god of the sea and waves, other women were able to board.”\nHe was proud.\nThis man who committed a heinous crime had no shame in his actions.\nThis is … justice?\nHa-ri wondered if she should be happy or not when she heard that she was chosen as a goddess by Poma, the God of the Sea and Waves.\n“Well … thanks to that, I was able to participate in the raid too …”\nIt wasn’t such a bad thing, but …\n“Han Ha-ri, there is something you have to do for me.”\n“What is it?”\n“Originally, it is a law that brings impurity if you bring a woman on board. The storm rises, the rainstorm hits, and the sea monsters attack.”\nIsn’t that too prejudiced? Ha-ri gave up that question early.\n“But there is a way to make up for it. Rather, the ship sails smoothly, the sea becomes calm, and guarantees a safe voyage. Can you do it?”\n“Yes, just tell me! I can do anything!”\nHa-ri should have asked at least what that method was at this time.\nCould she have dared to imagine that he would hang her on the masthead and offer them as goddess?\n-Hey, this is something wrong! You said I was a goddess! This treatment is wrong!\nHa-ri protested this injustice while her whole body was tied to a pole and fixed, but the students and soldiers who moved Ha-ri thought differently.\n“Senior … I’m sorry. Everyone is comfortable if only senior suffers.”\n“Junior Jae-hyuk? You, you! Soo-ho! My brother Soo-ho!”\n“Sister…I’m sorry. My opinion…doesn’t count.”\n“Traitor! Juniors! Hunters! Someone! Someone with reason should stop this!”\n““Aisha! Aisha!””\n“Are you all listening?!”\nAs he said, Gwanggaeto the Great was sailing. And … soon witnessed the typhoon shaking beyond.\n“Typhoon approaching ahead! It’s a butterfly! 64.5m per second!!”\nThe sailors were also busy.\nThe East Sea Gate, which was their target, was in line with the direct course of the typhoon. Of course, they had to prepare for a collision with the typhoon.\nOf course, Ha-ri was left alone tied to the masthead during this process.\n“Kyaahhh! Save meee! Save me!!”\nThere was thunder and lightning in the dark clouds.\nAre you really going to enter that hellish cave of that monster face-to-face? That too with me hanging?\n“Save meeeeee!!”\n“Shut up!”\n“Your Majesty?!”\nThere was a voice, and Leon was sitting calmly on a fishing chair. He even set up a fishing rod.\n“Be quiet, the fish will all run away.”\n“Fishing? Are you fishing now?!”\nFishing calmly while hanging people on the masthead and offering them as goddesses? Ha-ri was stunned.\n“Because of you, the fish seem to have run away.”\n“Well, there’s no fish in front of this big warship!”\n“I can catch them all. When I was the guardian of my port city Rangkul, I fished while riding a whale.”\nIt sounded like a lie, but it was credible because it was Leon so Ha-ri asked with an anxious look.\n“So, are you really going to hang me like this and head to the typhoon? It’s not too late now!”\nHa-ri was terrified by the approaching typhoon. If the masthead that hung her broke in the typhoon, it would be a matter of course that she would take the Styx River Express.\n“Your Majesty! Do you have any way? There is a way like magic or something, right?! I trust you, Your Majesty! I trust you!”\nDid Ha-ri’s desperate prayer reach him? There was a reaction from Leon’s fishing rod.\n“Hmm, it’s quite sturdy!”\nLeon pulled the fishing rod. Even in this situation, he was a pro and caught a fish in one breath, and a big one came dangling at the end.\n“Lieutenant Colonel Choi. Get ready.”\n“Yes, yes, Your Majesty …!”\nThen the sailors rushed in and quickly set up something.\nWhen he was about to sail long distances, he put a fish that was killed on the spot on something that served as an altar as an offering table.\n“You are the gracious lord of the sea. Appear before these villains who dare step on your territory.”\nThen something amazing happened. The ship that was shaking with all kinds of abnormal weather and waves became calm, and the seawater began to take shape while shaking.\nIt looked like a giant shark but it was too artificial to talk about the mystery of nature. Everyone felt it.\nThat is ‘god’.\n[Oh~ Lionheart. My beloved lighthouse. The protector of my temple Rangkul.]\n“Poma. The god of the sea and waves.”\nLeon bowed one knee and greeted him satisfactorily. He looked at the typhoon approaching from the East Sea and beyond and sighed regretfully.\n[It’s a very despicable sea. It has no dignity. As Petos said, I feel that there is no divinity in this land.]\nThe water droplet in the shape of a shark looked down at the warship that he could swallow in one bite.\n[What is the reason for not having sails on board? And these guys and those guys don’t realize the grace of the sea!]\n“It can’t be helped because they haven’t received the teachings of the sea yet. Please take care of them and comfort them.”\n[No! I have no reason to comfort those who are not even my believers! Only fear and respect will bring grace as well!]\nAt Poma’s scolding, the sailors fell into fear.\nThey didn’t know why he was angry, but just facing his anger made them tremble.\nIn front of his whimsy, they were no different from sand grains swallowed by waves.\n“…”\nLeon received many favors from many gods, but not all gods were comfortable opponents.\nPoma was especially fickle and eccentric among them. He never showed his anger at him, but he often made unreasonable demands on other believers.\n“By the way, how did you choose that kid as a goddess?”\n[Hahahaha …]\nPoma let out a deep laugh and looked at Ha-ri who was shaking while hanging on the masthead.\n[I barely persuaded Petos, but it was worth it. This kid has a natural vessel to accept God.]\n“Hmm?”\n[Of course not as much as you. You are out of standard that can contain all the divinity.]\n“I felt that my luck was mixed, but I really did.”\n[This is a blessing. How do you see it as misfortune?]\n“God’s attention can be poison to the unbelievers who lack faith.”\n[I believe that my lighthouse will solve it gradually.]\nAt that, Leon sighed and leaned back on his fishing chair.\n[Han Ha-ri, my new goddess.]\n“Me, me?”\n[I will give you the blessing of water and the power to control the waves. Accept this gladly and spread my spirit and teachings widely.]\n“Oh, yes, yes …! Just let me go!”\nPoma shouted.\n[As long as there is a sacrifice of my goddess, no wave can invade that ship!]\n“…Yes?”\nHa-ri shook her head, but Poma smiled and gave her a trial.\n[Your sacrifice will ignite the flame of life.]\nAs he said that, the huge water droplet collapsed. Like a soap bubble once.\n“…End?”\nWhen Ha-ri was at a loss, someone shouted.\n“Typhoon approaching ahead! Wave height 10m!!”\nAt that, the sailors and hunters evacuated to the inside of the deck at once, leaving Ha-ri alone.\n“…”\nAre you really leaving me alone? Are you leaving me like this?\nShe met eyes with her academy juniors who only peeked out their faces from beyond the railing.\n-Be strong.\n-Sister, cheer up.\n-Senior, fighting!\n-Show your strength as the top student of the Korean Hunter Academy!\nHa-ri only heard some cheers and had to face the approaching waves.\n-Kwaaaaaaah!!",

      "content": "Chapter 76: East Sea Gate\n-Kwarrung! Bang bang!\nThe loud thunder, the high waves and the rainstorm hit together but Ha-ri was not so strong-hearted that she wouldn’t be bothered by this situation.\n“Kyaahhh! Up! Up!”\nThe rainstorm hit and Ha-ri couldn’t open her eyes.\n“Save meeeeee…!”\nWhat happens if the waves hit like this? If lightning strikes? Doesn’t lightning usually hit the lightning rod first?\nLeon’s voice was heard in her ears, which were covered by anxiety and typhoon noise.\n“Hehe, you lack faith. But, it seems that Poma likes you, so he forgives some of your disbelief.”\n“Don’t forgive me! Please, let me down!”\n“Calm down. Entrust your body to the sea. Then the endless nature will embrace you.”\n“Your, Your Majesty! I am …!”\nI want to live right now!\nThe words she was about to spit out were blocked by the rainstorm.\n“Calm down. We are in the middle of a typhoon right now. But then, isn’t it strange? Why doesn’t a single wave hit you.”\n“Huh?”\nAt that, Ha-ri slowly opened her eyes and blinked them at the sight that unfolded.\n“The waves are …”\nThe fierce whirlwind that hit from afar, the huge waves that did not invade the ship at all.\n“Poma is calming the waves with the power of the sea through the goddess of the masthead.”\n“Is that true?”\nThat’s such a deep meaning. I thought it was because he was a racist.\n“Ah!”\nSnap! The rope came loose as Ha-ri broke the knot because she was shaking and struggling.\n“Ack!”\nHa-ri fell on the deck, grabbed her sore butt and made a sour expression. And right at that moment──\n-Kwarrung! Bang bang!\n-Kwaaaaaaah!\n-Kwaaaaaaah!\nAs Ha-ri fell from the masthead the ship began to shake and even a dull person would know that this change was due to Ha-ri falling.\n-…\n-…\nEveryone’s eyes turned to Ha-ri.\n-Not going?\nHa-ri twisted his face in tears.\n“You can tie me again…”\nIn the end, Ha-ri hung on the masthead again with Leon’s help and the waves calmed down.\n-Kwaaaaaa!\nThe waves hit the Arleigh Burke ship along with thunder strikes.\n“Kee … Great being. The ship will flip over at this rate!”\n[It’s a mess!]\nIt was too much to break through this typhoon and head to the gate. But there was no choice.\nTo quickly close the gate, he had to leave at the same time as the Korean attack team that left first.\n“Damn, why do those bastards look fine?”\n“Holy shit! Those crazy Koreans. They hung people!”\nThe US Navy sailors looked incredulously at Gwanggaeto the Great, who was sailing without shaking even in this storm.\nThe Wisdom Jewel shouted.\n[Tell the captain to chase that ship’s tail right now!]\n“What?”\n[If you don’t want to see the ship sink, do as I say!]\nReynald listened to the wisdom jewel and ordered the captain to chase after Kwanggaeto.\nEven though he was an admiral of an Aegis ship in the U.S. Navy, he couldn’t oppose Reynald, and the ship stabilized surprisingly well as he chased after Kwanggaeto.\n“My God…what is this…….?”\n[He’s using the power of the god of the sea and waves! Ships protected by that god reap bountiful catches and don’t sink in stormy seas!]\n“I see…”\nReynald swallowed his next words.\n“Well, with this kind of cruising in this typhoon, we should be there in no time.”\n[Remember, what you have to do is very important!]\nThe ships sailed through the typhoon and arrived at their target coordinates, where they heard the message.\n[Here is Arleigh Burke and we have unfortunate news. It seems that the Murasame-class Haejae who sailed from Sasebo has been overturned by a storm and is being rescued.]\nHaejae failed to break through the typhoon and sank. In other words, it meant that one-third of the power had evaporated before the raid started.\n[This is Gwanggaeto the Great. We will proceed with the operation. We will enter the gate from now on and board the attack team on a boat.]\nThe two ships boarded hunters on rubber boats and their goal was the gate towering in the middle of the vast sea.\n“We are now entering the gate.”\nThe black boats rowed in unison toward the gate and light wrapped them up.\nMy arm hurts.\nKwaa, kwaa~ The water rushing in wet my clothes.\n“Hmm …”\nHa-ri licked her mouth, which kept flicking with water … The saltiness of the sea hits her taste buds.\n“Eek! Salty!”\nHa-ri got up in a hurry and shook off the sand that stuck wetly and opened her eyes that had been submerged and saw a red sunset over the horizon.\n‘What, half a day has passed?’\nHa-ri grabbed her head with a throbbing headache and recalled her memory before fainting.\n“As soon as I entered the gate, a whirlwind …”\nThe rubber boats of Korea and America that entered were all overturned and swept away.\nHa-ri’s complexion turned pale.\n“Where are they all?”\nHa-ri looked at the other hunters lying on the sandy beach. Most of them were familiar faces.\n“Soo-ho! Wake up!”\n“Hmm …”\n“Sister?”\nAs Ha-ri shook him, he gradually opened his eyes. The students and soldiers were here but there were more people who were not visible.\n‘Where is His Majesty? Where is Yappy? Where did the American hunters go ?!’\nHa-ri hurriedly asked the people around her.\n[Calm down. Everyone will be safe.]\n“Who!”\nShe was startled by a voice and turned around, but all she saw were fallen students.\n“Ghost?”\n[Here.]\nShe cautiously approached where the voice was heard but there was only one small turtle.\n[Here.]\n“Tu, turtle?”\nThe turtle, which was small enough to be placed on Ha-ri’s shoulder, looked at her with a blank expression and Ha-ri asked cautiously.\n“Are you … Poma?”\n[Yes, my goddess. I sent my avatar for your salvation.]\n“Avatar…?”\nHa-ri had seen the avatars of the beast gods at the Jeju Island gate.\nA huge iron monkey. That beast god was truly a giant worthy of being called a god, but the god of the sea and waves in front of her was…\n“Small.”\n[Oh, this! You can’t even bow down when you see the divine body, let alone!]\nHa-ri was stunned by the small turtle’s anger, and didn’t know whether to be afraid or not.\n“By the way, you said everyone would be safe, do you know what happened?”\n[As soon as you entered here, I pushed them to land safely with the power of the waves. I couldn’t stop them from scattering, though.]\nHa-ri marveled at Poma’s power that protected everyone from dying there.\n“Wow, you’re amazing.”\n[But it’s inconvenient to move with this body. Put me on your shoulder.]\n“Uh, yes …”\nHa-ri put Poma’s avatar on her shoulder. The small turtle yawned and pushed his head into his shell.\n“Poma?”\n[…]\nNo response. Ha-ri didn’t bother to wake Poma, wondering if she was sleepy, and…….\n-Dadak dadak!\nA strange sound of footsteps was coming from the inside of the island and Ha-ri, who witnessed it, shouted with a pale face.\n“Everyone get up! Get up quickly! Monsters!”\nHuge crab-shaped monsters that reached 1.6m rushed in with their huge claws clanging.\n“Uh, why now when I’m out of my mind …!”\nHa-ri immediately took a stance and drew her sword. Not everyone who was shipwrecked had woken up yet so she needed to buy some time.\n-Tadak!\nSparks flew from Ha-ri’s sword. She intended to block the monsters with her maximum firepower, a unique skill called Fire Blessing, but …\n“Huh?”\nSomething impure got into the flow of magic that she squeezed out of her body.\n-Splash!\nA stream of water poured over the flames and the fire went out.\n“Huh?”\nWhat’s wrong with this? Poma looked at Ha-ri’s bewildered face and said.\n[The goddess who … receives the blessing of … the sea and … the waves … why does she need … fire …]\n“Huh?”\nWhat does that mean?\nShe couldn’t use her fire magic anymore because of the blessing she received from Poma.\n“I can’t use fire?! Oh, no! Give it back! I don’t want to be Poma’s goddess!”\n[No. I don’t intend to give it back….]\nHa-ri’s scream echoed widely on the sandy beach.\nThe US attack team was also swept away by the whirlwind that occurred as soon as they entered the gate.\n“Phew … It was bad luck to have this at the entrance.”\n[But thanks to that, we got away from that monstrosity.]\nWhile Reynold and Wisdom Jewel voice were relieved, the US hunters who were part of the attack team approached.\n“Thirty-eight people confirmed, sir.”\nMinitman, ranked 8th in Maverick, a super-large guild representing North America. He was a 2m tall giant S-class hunter picked by Reynold for this job.\n“Do you have any idea how many people are left?”\n“This is my first time doing this but I’m sure they’re holding their own.”\n“And the ‘natives’?”\n“There’s been a commotion, so they’ll be approaching. Oh, there they are.”\n-Dadak dadak!\n-Dadak dadak!\nAs Minitman said, giant crab-shaped monsters were pouring out of the forest but the Maverick guild members quickly took up combat positions considering they were stranded on an island.\n“It’s time to work, bastards. Let’s clean up quickly and start constructing the base.”\nReynold didn’t have to bother them and under Minitman command, the Maverick guild members slaughtered monsters like killing machines.\n“Then build a base and rest. I’ll go inside the island for a while.”\n“Do you need an escort?”\n“I’m fine.”\nReynold left the Maverick guild members on the coast and headed inland.\nHe is a powerful magician representing North America. He is not a weakling who will die in such a gate without a hunter’s escort.\nIn fact, some crab monsters attacked him in the middle, but they died by Reynold magic.\n“Wake up.”\nReynold poured evil magic into the monsters. Then they wriggled as they became undead and got up.\n“Guide me to the statue.”\nThe crab monsters took the lead at Reynold’s words and because the island was quite small, he was able to get to where he wanted in no time.\n“This is …”\n[It’s the statue I was looking for. You have to find more of these!]\nThe statue Reynold found was a huge statue with an alien shape.\nAn artifact that feels like something that would come out when excavating ancient civilizations ruins.\nAn ordinary person would have sensed traces of civilization here, but Reynold sensed a tremendous power from the statue.\n“Then──”\nAt the moment Reynold reached out to the statue──\n“Wait …!”\nA voice that stopped him echoed.\n* * * *\nYappy, which had been swept away by the whirlwind, could barely function due to the seawater that entered his body.\nAlthough Yappy is an ultra-high-performance, multi-role vehicle, it was not designed to be used in the sea, so it was not saltwater-treated.\nHowever, thanks to the waterproofing of critical components and a self-diagnostic program that triggered when the system went down and decontaminated it, he was able to get it back up and running quickly.\n-What?\nThe first thing Yakt Spinner sees after booting up is a bunch of monsters.\n-Yuck! Yuck, yuck, yuck!\n-Squeak!\nWhen Yappy opens his eyes, he sees a group of claws pacing back and forth in a cheerful manner, their paws raised high in the air, rejoicing in his every move.\n-What?\nHe couldn’t tell at first but Yappy realized he was being held in a primitive cocoon nest, piled high.\nHe must have been rescued by these crabs.\n-Ugh!\nYappy scratched his head and spoke up, and the crabs cheered.\n-Squeak, squeak, squeak!\n-Giggle!",

      "content": "Chapter 77: Drifting\n“Wait …!”\nReynold turned his gaze toward the voice that stopped him.\nThere, the two S-class hunters of the Phoenix Guild and the attack team members were lined up.\n“Mr. Lee Yong-wan, Ms. Ha Yuri. You are safe.”\nReynold stopped his hand reaching for the statue.\n“Do you know what you are touching?”\nReynold licked his tongue as he saw the Phoenix Guild, who had come from the other side.\n‘I didn’t expect them to come so soon. They’re quick to judge.’\n[As long as it’s not him. But where is that bastard?]\nWisdom Jewel’s vigilance against Leon was almost obsessive-compulsive.\nOn the other hand, Reynold calmly spoke about the statue.\n“You must have received a quest too, right? This statue, didn’t it tell you to break it?”\n[Explore the island and destroy the ‘Rakshar the Great Statue’. 0/3]\n-Destroyed Rakshar Statue: 0\nThe quest they received after entering this gate. Of course they checked it right away.\n“…”\nBut Lee Yong-wan had recently doubted the ‘quest’ given by the gate and system.\nIn the previous Jeju Island gate the quest was to ‘stop the massacre and defeat the majestic Georgic’.\nBut when he looked back, Georgic was not a target to be defeated.\n‘I haven’t shared this information yet …’\nThere is something behind the quest given by the gate. At least it’s not something to be taken for granted.\n“Let’s put it aside for now. It’s not clear if this is the statue that came out in the quest.”\n“…What do you mean?”\nReynold’s eyes narrowed. Lee Yong-wan, who faced his gaze, was uncomfortable, but he was not comparable to Leon or Georgic.\n“If this is not the statue in the quest, there may be some trap if you destroy it. Don’t you have to make sure what ‘Rakshar’ is first?”\n“…”\nReynold remained silent.\n‘That’s not an unreasonable thing to say.’\n[Back off for a moment. You alone will have a hard time dealing with all of these guys.]\nReynold agreed with Wisdom Jewel’s voice and showed a business smile.\n“Then let’s go together to the beach for now. There are Maverick guild members there.”\nReynold decided to wait for an opportunity.\n“Huah …! I finally finished everything!”\n“Sister, you worked hard.”\nHa-ri and the TTG Guild students who repelled the crab monsters gathered on the beach.\n“Soo-ho, is anyone hurt?”\n“I’m fine, sister.”\nHa-ri comforted her academy juniors who were checking their bodies and approached Kim Do-han and the soldiers. There was also Koo Dae-sung who was taking care of them.\n“Hunter Park Dae-sik! Hunter Koo Dae-sung! Are there any injuries?”\n“I’m fine, Miss Han.”\nPark Dae-sik, a first-generation man-at-arms, smiled kindly and waved his hand. On the other hand, Koo Dae-Sung had a serious expression on his face.\n“Hunter Koo?”\n“…It’s cut off.”\n“Huh? What?”\n“His Majesty’s aura has been cut off.”\n“Ah …”\nLeon had various passive buffs such as Lionheart’s Aura and War Knight’s Blessing to his subordinates.\nThose buffs increased their power by at least one level and up to two levels and made D-class hunters barely compete with orcs.\n“That’s a big deal. I’ve seen a lot of His Majesty’s buffs …”\nThe guild members naturally looked at the islands that were faintly visible in the distance.\n“Do you think His Majesty is on one of those islands?”\n“It doesn’t look that far away …\nAt that remark, Koo Dae-Sung shook his head vigorously.\n“I have suggested it to His Majesty and tried it before to see how far does His Majesty’s aura reach.”\nThe buffs were applied to the corps members at a reasonable distance. But there was definitely a limit to that distance.\n“The widest range of buffs was up to 30 km but none of us are currently receiving that buff.”\n“So what does that mean?”\n“His Majesty … There is a possibility that he is not on any of those islands.”\nNot even on those islands? There are no more islands around here. Then where is he?\n“What if His Majesty …?”\nHe cautiously uttered a word. But everyone waved their hands and shook their heads.\n“His Majesty would never…”\nNaturally denying the atmosphere, only Ha-ri had a serious expression on her face.\n[Ha-ri, the connection with the Lionheart King has been cut off.]\n“…”\nHa-ri kept her mouth shut and did not show any reaction. She was worried that her anxiety would spread to others.\n“First of all … let’s gather and talk. We also need to check who is gathered.”\nSo they gathered in one place for the time being, students and trainees. They called each other’s names and counted the number of people.\n“I don’t see Kim Do-han.”\n“I can’t see Jae-hyuk.”\nThere were dropouts from both students and soldiers. And…\n-Hi everyone, I’m Michael.\n“Oh~ the girl who was hanging on the boat. Why did you do such a crazy thing?”\nAbout 10 hunters of the US Maverick Guild, who were dispatched as a joint attack team, were also present.\n“Oh, right. You are from the US.”\nHa-ri distinguished them by their appearance rather than the language they used.\nAfter the Great Change, awakeners and system windows appeared. And that overturned the language barrier between the awakeners.\nSimilarly, survivors also spoke the same language as Earthlings so communication with the Maverick guild members was not difficult.\n“Hello, I’m Maverick Guild callsign Mistral. What’s your name, pretty girl?”\n“Uh, um … I’m Ha-ri Han. Mist … Mistral?!”\nHa-ri’s eyes widened as she heard the man in front of her introduced himself as Mistral. He was a famous S-class hunter ranked 6th in the Maverick Guild.\n“Really Mistral? That Allen Taylor?!”\n“Why bother with a callsign if you call me by my real name?”\n“Oops! I’m sorry.”\nShe bowed her head and the students who sent their longing eyes to the world-famous S-class hunter.\n“I didn’t know you were on the attack team.”\n“Wasn’t there any information sharing? Well, we left in a hurry without having time to properly brief. But is your guild master not there?”\n“His Majesty is absent …”\n“Well, there won’t be any big deal. There will be some people swept away by the waves.”\n“That’s not it.”\nAt Ha-ri’s assertion, Allen looked puzzled.\n“The sea god gave us his blessing. There will be no one killed by the waves.”\nAs if he was confident, the turtle on Ha-ri’s shoulder stuck out his head.\n“And … if His Majesty wanted to find us, he would have found us long ago.”\n“That’s right, sister. His Majesty has Pegasus.”\n“So are we left alone to do whatever we want? He is a person who trains us hard anyway …”\n“???”\nAllen made a strange expression as he heard Ha-ri and TTG Guild members’ conversation about their guild leader.\nSea god? The legendary divine beast with wings? It’s too frivolous to joke about.\n“Anyway, what we have to do on this island is simple.”\nAllen’s gaze turned to the air, towards the system window that anyone who is a hunter has.\nThis system window, which tells the purpose of the gate as soon as they enter the gate, tells them what quest they had to perform.\n[Explore the island and destroy the ‘Rakshar the Great Statue’. 0/3]\n-Destroyed Rakshar Statue: 0\nIn other words, does it mean that the dungeon will be closed if three statues are destroyed?\nBut Ha-ri and TTG Guild students who had already experienced Jeju Gate had different thoughts.\n“Let’s explore the island first and postpone destroying the statue for a while.”\n“Yeah, I don’t think it’s a good idea to destroy it blindly. Let’s figure out the gate first.”\n“I agree.”\n“Hmm?”\nAllen frowned at the reaction of the TTG Guild members.\nHunters only need to follow the closing conditions of the dungeon gate. It’s enough to quickly close it after getting all the resources you can get in it.\nBut the reaction of the TTG Guild was different from that of an ordinary guild.\n“Well … I guess it’s okay to do it while looking for the statue.”\nBut right then──\n[The first wave begins.]\n“Huh?”\n“Wave?”\nThe system window warned them.\n“Kraken? It’s a sea monster!”\nA huge monster arrived on the sandy beach riding the waves and behind it, countless monsters showed up together.\n“It starts with an A-class field boss. It’s tough.”\nTTG Guild and Maverick Guild raised their weapons toward the flock of krakens that were advancing by swinging their huge tentacles.\nIn the abyss of the endless sea, the deep sea where even sunlight cannot reach, there is a luminescent body on the bottom of the sea that emits a brilliant light.\nIt creates space and air by pushing away even the huge pressure of the deep sea.\nIt was a safe zone for terrestrial creatures in the middle of the sea and the being who created this impossible miracle opened his eyes.\n“It’s troublesome.”\nLeon, who opened his eyes, stared at the deep-sea fish that were flocking from all sides.\nAttracted by the intense light, things like lantern fish show interest, and giant snakes like deep-sea fish that are hundreds of meters long show their hundreds of teeth.\nIn nature, predators and prey would not look so peacefully in one place, but all these deep-sea fish were looking only at him.\nNot only that. This deep sea was not just the bottom of the sea.\nRuins of buildings that maintain their shape even under the huge pressure of the deep sea and traces of civilization showed that this place was evidence of a ruined world.\n“Hmm …”\nWhen the boat capsized, Poma’s power was temporarily cut off.\nTo be precise, his power decreased in the sea, which was not his territory.\nWho can temporarily block God’s power and pull him in the deep sea?\nThe only ones capable of such a thing are beings who have the same divinity or demons of a completely different nature.\n“Show yourself, evil thing.”\nKugugugung!! The sea moves at Leon’s rebuke. No, it looked like that.\nThe bottom of the abyss splits and reveals a huge presence. The movement alone makes the whole sea roar and.\nThe fierce teeth with jaws, the deep-sea fish boasting a length of hundreds of meters, and even whales that seem to be bigger than anything else in the world are instinctively afraid and cannot move.\nThe land where Leon stands itself is its palm, so how can such a huge being be called a creature?\n[Lionheart…The hound of gods. Descendant of Dragon Slayer. The one who killed the most demons.]\nA deep voice spreads through the water. What appeared was only one of hundreds of tentacles but even that one tentacle was bigger than the biggest creature in this sea.\n[The knight among knights. The king among kings. The guardian of a kingdom that once had brilliant glory appeared in front of me after losing his army and having his power weakened.]\n“Do you know me?”\n[Who among demons doesn’t know the Lionheart King? You are famous among us.]\nThe lowly approaching tentacles were too big and big is itself a huge violence. The being in front of him is the most unreasonable violence in this world.\n[Many heroes have visited this place, but there was no hero who could defeat me. Are you different?]\nThe tentacles looked straight at Leon as if they had eyes on each one.\n“You filthy bastard dare to insult me. Don’t you really know that there is a heaven above heaven among you?”\nThe huge tentacle grabbed a whale and squeezed it as it was.\nPaddeuk! A whale spitting out its intestines died miserably and fell to the ground. The impact was so heavy that it reached Leon.\n[But I thank you, Lionheart.]\n“What?”\n[Thanks to you defeating Malus, I also have a chance.]\n“Malus …”\n‘Malus, Demon Lord of Chaos. Is he related to that bastard?’\n[I spent an idle time here for five hundred years. But that’s over now. It’s time to end this long sleep.]\nDozens of tentacles reveal their grandeur and stretch out in all directions as giant deep-sea fish that can’t even think of escaping are caught by those tentacles and torn and swallowed.\nFrom where the huge tentacle brought the prey, a voice that caused waves faced Leon.\n[I was bored of eating fish for five hundred years. I wonder what the knight of the gods tastes like.]\n‘Archdemon…no, more than that.’\nLeon faced the evil that looked down on him.",

It would be difficult to continue the battle without the healing function of the Holy Grail.\n‘I barely managed to block a blow…….’\nMeanwhile, Ha-ri penetrated the gap between the monsters that landed.\n“Ha!”\nHa-ri jumps in. Fortunately, Ha-ri’s sword flashed in the gap he dug in.\n-Kwak!\nThe sword that swung at the head only severed the leg that was trying to hit her. After landing, Ha-ri dodged the blow and cursed her luck.\n‘If only I could use my skills!’\nHa-ri backed away and shouted at Poma, who was sticking out his head on her shoulder.\n“Poma! I’m supposed to be a priestess, but why don’t I have any super tsunami skills or something?”\n[Did you read too many novels?]\n“Yikes! You’re the most novel-like!”\n“Sister, avoid it!”\nWhen I turned around, the merman that came with the Kraken was holding out a sharp trident.\n“Huh?!”\nDangerous. She was so focused on Kraken that she didn’t notice. In a hurry to block the trident with her arm, something flashed and pierced the merman.\n“Be careful, pretty girl.”\nIt was Allen. He and the Maverick guild members swept away the monsters that landed and came to help with the Kraken.\n“Are you flirting with women, boss?”\n“A man does that everywhere.”\n“Well. Oriental kids look too young, so I’m a little hesitant.”\nThe Maverick guild members were relaxed even against an A-class field boss. Usually, boss-level large monsters are bigger and more difficult than their measured grades, but …\n“It’s not bad for an A-class?”\n“It’s the first wave. Make sure you manage your condition properly and don’t overextend yourself.”\nThe huge field boss was helpless in front of Allen and the Maverick guild members.\n“…They’re strong.”\n“Yeah. They’re America’s best hunter guild.”\nTTG Guild had more than thirty guild members, but Maverick achieved overwhelming results with only ten or so.\nIt was natural since each of them was an A-class hunter, and their leader was Allen Taylor, one of America’s best hunters and an S-class hunter.\n“Let’s clean up the rest! There’s not much left!”\nTheir power was so overwhelming that the battle itself was easy.\n[The first wave is over.]\n“Hoo~ the wave is over.”\nThe battle ended without much trouble. Although they had a hard time because of the field boss, their power was overwhelming.\n[Well, it’s not a bad level.]\nPoma, did not leave Ha-ri’s shoulder even during the battle and Ha-ri found Poma annoying.\n“Poma! If it weren’t for your divine power, I could have fought much better!”\n[Hehehe, my priestess, why do you blame your shortcomings on God?]\n“Eek … I used to be a fire swordsman.”\nHa-ri felt that it was a loss that she could not use her fire blessing because of Poma’s divine power.\nShe was a promising A-class candidate in her own right, and this was why she couldn’t use her power in the wave.\nA hunter’s unique skill is his characteristic and innate talent itself.\nHa-ri had the ability to manipulate fire, which was a powerful advantage over other hunters.\n“If I have water powers in the first place, shouldn’t I be able to do something like freeze or Ice spear! Why is it that when I channel my powers, water gets mixed in with them and puts out the fire?”\n[I said I am a god of sea and waves. You should look for a god of ice or something like that.]\n“Do they exist?”\n[There is a goddess of winter, but there is no god of ice.]\n“Well … That’s true.”\nHa-ri felt uneasy that she could not use her own power right now. It’s natural to be anxious because the blessing she’s been using since childhood has been neutralized.\n[My child. Don’t be obsessed with a handful of power. There is infinity in front of you, how can you not realize it?]\n“…”\nHa-ri could not understand Poma’s words. To be honest, she just wanted to ask why he didn’t tell her.\nBut Poma, who spoke in metaphors and analogies, felt like a sage. Why is that? Something like a recluse master who teaches the protagonist in a movie.\nIn fact, there might be some hidden truth and reason, right?\nBut that expectation was soon broken.\nStatue search and repeated wave defense. Allen of the Maverick Guild decided to do both of them in a textbook way.\nFirst, he formed a team to search for the statue by breaking through the crab monsters on the island,\nSecond, he built barricades and camp facilities on the coast to prepare for a long-term battle.\nCrab monsters didn’t usually come to the beach, so it was easier to hold on to the beach and face only one side.\nThis work was done quickly. The academy teaches how to build a base and survival common sense at the gate where you don’t know what will happen.\nThe Maverick guild members who had experienced everything and the TTG guild members who had received enough training quickly built a base and took a break.\n-Kyak!\n-Oh, don’t throw it! Don’t throw it──Oof!\n-Don’t go too deep into the sea!\nEven though they didn’t have swimsuits or facilities, these kids could play with water anyway.\n“Hoo~ Do you want some water, Poma?”\nHa-ri, who dried her wet clothes and sat on the sand, took out a water bottle filled with an emergency backpack and poured water on the turtle’s mouth.\n[Kra~ The water tastes good.]\nPoma placed his sunglasses on the turtle’s head and laid his belly down. The turtle’s gaze focused on the energetic Academy cadets.\n[Hoo~ The scent of flesh and the lively appearance of virgins are always good to see.]\n“Uh …”\nHa-ri’s face distorted at Poma’s comment.\n[My priestess. Don’t you want to play in there?]\n“I don’t really like water play. The sun is hot, and my skin is sticky.”\n[Hehehe, every young woman has a freshness that is different from others. Enjoy your youth, virgin. How can you sit huddled like a basement dweller with that sturdy flesh?]\n“You are … like a typical bad boss.”\nTo be honest, if he wasn’t a god, she would have said something.\n[What~ After all, young men and women are like blooming flowers, so they can spread their reproductive instincts indiscriminately at this time. In that respect, I agreed with that war guy.]\n‘…Old-fashioned god.’\nHa-ri thought of Leon, who was the most old-fashioned type she could think of, and wondered if he was influenced by the gods.\n“Oh. Then Poma.”\n[What is it?]\n“Why did you hang me on the mast as a sacrifice? I mean, thanks to that, I didn’t get capsized by the waves and sailed safely.”\nIt was a pure question.\n[That? It’s a kind of sacrificial ritual.]\n“Sacrificial … ritual?”\n[In the old days, there were people who were overly loyal to us without us asking. A typical example is human sacrifice.]\nPoma said that he used to send down his own spirit directly when he saw people throwing virgins into his palace for him in any sea in the world.\n[What’s the use of throwing it into any sea? At first I took them to my palace and made them brides, but there were too many of them.]\nSo he agreed to hang virgins on the mast.\nHa-ri wondered if this was something to agree on.\n“Just tell them not to do it?”\n[I can’t do that. After all, offering to God is itself a lump of faithful faith. They pay their dues because they respect and fear God. Miracles bestowed without compensation only lead to laziness and sloth.]\n“I guess … but why …”\n[The flesh of virgins is always good to see, isn’t it?]\n“…Pervert.”\n[What did you say?]\n“Oh, nothing!”\nPoma peeked out of his sunglasses.\n[If you are my goddess, remember my commandments, for they are now yours to teach and preach.]\nWhat kind of teaching will Poma give?\nHa-ri recalled the commandments of Demera, the goddess of life and abundance.\nAren’t the words of the gods always good words across cultures? I think it wouldn’t hurt to learn.\nThe God of the Sea and Waves\nRelease the first fish you catch into the sea. Only throw the net to the right. Do not throw garbage into the sea. Do not have sex on the boat. Especially between men. …\n…\nThe one who catches the biggest fish on the first day of the first voyage will have good luck until he reaches land. The one who catches the smallest fish on the first day of the first voyage can be ridiculed. Even if he is the captain. …\n…\nDo not take women on board. Misfortune will come. A virgin with bare skin is fine. The more skin is exposed, the better. [Did you hear that well? From now on, either don’t take women on board, or save a virgin and hang her on a mast. Then I will bless that boat.]\n“…”\nHa-ri looked down at Poma with a rude and timid gaze for a long time, swallowing many words she wanted to say.\n‘He’s a complete pervert…’\nPoma yawned and enjoyed the warm sunlight and hot sand bath. He ignored Ha-ri’s gaze lightly.\n[The third wave has ended.]\n-Kiruk!\n-Kikiruk!\nThe Kikiruk tribe cheered and exclaimed as the third wave ended. They dedicated this glory to Yappy.\nIt has been 36 hours since he drifted.\nYappy blocked the wave that flocked to the island with the Kikiruk tribe on the island where he drifted.\nAccording to Yappy’s judgment, the waves continue to hit periodically. And those wave monsters are blocked by the natives, the Kikiruk tribe.\nThe wave renewal time is 12 hours. In this regular invasion, many Kikiruk tribes also died.\n-Kikiruk tribe population count. Abnormal breeding speed and growth speed.\nNevertheless, they were able to block the wave because of their innate mass breeding power and abnormal growth speed.\nAny creature needs nutrients and skeletal formation time for growth but Kikiruk tribes grow and breed at an abnormal rate.\n“Brother Yappy. Brother Yappy!”\nIt was then that Kim Jae-hyuk, a trainee knight of TTG Guild, who broke through the Kikiruk tribe, ran towards Yappy. He was rescued by Yappy’s instructions after being found drifting on the beach.\n-What is it? Kim Jae-hyuk.\n“Rakshar statues have not been destroyed yet.”\nYappy is a survivor. Survivors have an advantage that there is no language limit, but unlike Awakeners, they cannot see system windows.\nJae-hyuk played a role in delivering information from that system, and Yappy inferred a lot from it.\n-Rakshar statue. Abnormal magic density phenomenon. It may have affected Kikiruk’s abnormal growth.\n“Do you mean we have to protect Rakshar statues?”\n-That’s right.\nWhat if all the statues are destroyed?\nYappy and Jae-hyuk thought of the worst case scenario from there.\n“If we keep defending like this, will it work?”\n-Impossible.\n“Huh? Brother Yappy swept them all away.”\n-The difficulty increases sharply as the wave stage rises. With current power, high possibility of strategic defeat from 5th wave.\nYappy is a Holy Knight. Of course, he’s not at full power, but at least it’s ranked third in combat power in TTG Guild.\nHe’s power is comparable to an average S-rank, but he can’t guarantee victory?\n“The others will be better off than us…”\nOf course, there are advantages here too. It’s that Kikiruks move as Yappy commands them.\nKikiruks saw Yappy as a savior who came to save them.\n-Kikiruk! (Hooray!)\n-Kiruk! Kikiruk! (Praise the savior!)\nKikiruks are completely under Yappy’s command. And they were a more sophisticated tribal society than he thought.\n-Power reinforcement is needed. Even if it’s primitive cold weapons, you need to equip them.\n“Cold weapons… That’s right, brother Yappy. I found something interesting.”\n-Kiruk?\nFollowing Jae-hyuk’s guidance and escorted by Kikiruks, they arrived inside the island. It was hidden inside a waterfall.\nYappy witnessed an amazing sight as he passed through what looked like a cave.\nIt was a trace of urban civilization.\n-The width of the road, the skeleton of the building, and the direction of the formed culture match the physical characteristics of Kikiruk.\n“That’s right. It was a developed civilization, but…”\nWhy are Kikiruks now forming a primitive society?\n-Kikiruk’s intellectual ability is not lacking compared to humans. They have superior intelligence and more social empathy skills than dolphins. They have all the conditions necessary for civilization formation.\nThen there must be a reason why they have fallen like this and can’t even use their ancestors’ heritage.\nYappy saw an old blacksmith shop and asked the Kikiruks.\n-Kiruk! Kikikiruk! (Is there a place where something similar to this mineral is gathered?)\nKikiruks answered.\n-Kirukkiruk!\nThe answer didn’t need to be translated and Yappy immediately gave instructions.\n“Brother Yappy? I can’t understand what you’re saying, can you translate it?”\nHe couldn’t understand what they were saying.\n-Simple.\n“Wow, brother. What kind of amazing trick?”\nYappy confidently rolled his camera eye and declared.\n-I will raise the level of civilization in this world.",

      "content": "Chapter 79: Advancing at Mach Speed\nThe wave is already the fourth. It’s been two days since they drifted into the gate.\nDuring that time, Ha-ri tried to awaken her power while fighting the waves on the beach.\nNormally, she would have been more diligent than anyone else in searching for statues or something, but she had a desperate reason.\n“Ah! Ah!”\nShe hit the water with her bare feet and tried to squeeze a handful of seawater but the water soon collapsed and the squeezed seawater scattered in her hand.\nPoma shook his head at Ha-ri’s meaningless struggle.\n[If you want to play with water, take off your clothes and do it. Make it look good.]\n“Yuck…! Don’t harass me when I’m trying to awaken somehow!”\n[I don’t know where your attempt to awaken the power of the sea and waves is.]\nHa-ri pouted her lips and sat down on the wet sand floor at Poma’s question.\n“I learned that you can be closer to Goddess Arianna of Light and Justice by repeating righteous actions or raising honor.”\n[It’s a fitting teaching for her. It’s boring.]\n“Goddess Demera of Life and Abundance was grateful to the land by farming, and God Petos of War and Fire was victory and flame of will? Something like that.”\nThe gods teach the proper teachings and how to perform them according to their respective domains.\nSurprisingly, the previous gods were simple in terms of difficulty rather than teaching.\n“Since Poma is the god of sea and waves? I thought it might have something to do with the sea.”\n[I don’t think it has anything to do with water.]\n“Yuck…! Then why don’t you tell me? Should I go out to sea and catch some fish?”\n[It’s more like offering me fish that you catch. But how are you going to catch fish without a boat, a net, or a fishing rod?]\n“Uh…”\nHa-ri wondered why this bright turtle god didn’t give her any power.\n“His Majesty Leon…you said we had to save him … Shouldn’t we hurry in that case?”\n[That’s right. He is trapped in the sea, not on land. The fact that he hasn’t come out by himself means he’s in a rather difficult situation.]\n“Then why don’t you hurry up and awaken me so I can find His Majesty?”\n[That’s right.]\nThen why? Ha-ri couldn’t understand this god of sea and waves.\n[Ha-ri, my goddess. It’s easy for you to practice the code of the sea and waves and build your faith.]\n[Every day, pray as a fisherman, throw a net, harvest fish, and thank me, pray for the source of life.]\n[The sea is an infinite source of life. You can build faith by just being grateful for it.]\nShould I make a raft or something? As Ha-ri was worried, Poma said kindly.\n[But, Ha-ri. Young goddess. How do you mistake the way of believers and priests? Are you arrogant enough to think that the enlightenment of soldiers and knights is the same?]\nRealize and practice. Only that way can you realize the way of faith.\n“…”\nHa-ri had mixed feelings. Just tell me what to do instead of talking so much.\nShe wanted something like skills or systems that gave results without any process.\n“Hmm… I’ll try harder.”\nBut what can I do? Ha-ri just tried hard to awaken the power given to her as Poma told her.\n“Sister! Sister!”\nAnd then, he saw Soo-ho running fiercely towards the beach.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“The Maverick Guild found a statue!”\nThere were nine hours until the next wave so Ha-ri immediately followed Soo-ho.\nThe interior of the island is full of crab monsters, making it a challenge just to advance but Reynold’s island was on the smaller side, so the distance to the statue was not very far.\nThe mission Reynold received from Wisdom Jewel was to destroy all the statues.\nHe should have destroyed this statue on the first day and proceeded to the next island…\n‘You’re still guarding it. You’re more stubborn than I thought.’\n[Why are they doing things they weren’t told to do?]\nThe Phoenix Guild thoroughly investigated the statue and its surroundings. As if they doubted the quest itself that said destroy Rakshar statue.\nThat was beyond Wisdom Jewel and Reynold’s expectations.\nUsually hunters who receive quests try only according to those quests, not digging into the intentions or truth of quests.\nThe sweet fruits they get while clearing quests, rewards are chased by hunters, but now Lee Yong-wan and Phoenix Guild’s movements were clearly different.\n‘Should I destroy it secretly at night?’\n[There is no need to arouse unnecessary suspicion, and we have a reason.]\nReynold quickly understood what Wisdom Jewel meant by reason.\n“Hey, Korean guys. Don’t you think we should destroy the statue soon? I think we’ve waited long enough.”\nThe Maverick Guild members agreed with the judgment of the Phoenix Guild.\nWhether it’s really ‘Rakshar statue’ as the quest says, or if there’s anything else around it.\n“When I was trying to capture the gate in Mexico City, I made a mistake and fell into a trap.”\n“It’s not a bad choice to do a thorough investigation rather than blindly destroying it.”\nThey blocked the wave while investigating the island for three days, and came to a conclusion.\n“There was nothing to be found on the island except for those crab monsters and traces of civilization.”\n“There is only one statue. One per island according to the quest. It seems right to destroy Rakshar statue.”\n“Is there any reason to wait?”\nMaverick Guild drew a reasonable conclusion based on their research.\nLee Yong-wan and Ha Yuri had nothing to say against it.\n“Hmm…”\n“I can’t help it. I don’t see any other way.”\nAlmost as soon as he agreed, the Maverick Guild’s S-class Hunter Minuteman pounded on the statue with a fist the size of his head.\n“This thing is pretty hard.”\nBut that was all. The S-ranked Hunter was serious, and the statue was destroyed shortly thereafter, at which point the quest window updated.\n[The ‘Great Rakshar’s Stone Statue’ has been destroyed].\n1/3 of the statue destroyed\n“So destroying this statue was the right answer.”\nThe Maverick Guild’s members had a positive response to the quest update. However, Lee Yong-wan and Ha-Yuri still had a nagging feeling.\n“I wonder if this is it.”\n“It can’t be helped, I don’t see any other way.”\n-Kiruk!\n-Kiruk! Kiruk!\nThat’s when it happened. The moment they destroyed the statue, crab monsters came bubbling out from everywhere as if they were enraged by the destruction of the statue.\n“They’re going crazy all of a sudden.”\n“Kill them!”\nBut the crab monsters were no match for them. Even though their numbers were huge, they were fighting against three S-class Hunters.\nThe hunters calmly slaughtered the crab monsters and the battle continued for a long time.\n“Whew… Damn, there are so many.”\n“We also found and destroyed the nest, so they won’t come anymore.”\n“Lee Yong-wan, it’s wave time.”\n“Already? It took longer than I thought.”\nIt’s time for the sixth wave. But even though it was 12 o’clock, there was no wave warning on the island.\n“There’s no wave?”\n“It was the right answer to destroy the statue.”\nThey destroyed the statue and the waves stopped. No wonder they were so confident that their actions were correct.\n“Then let’s attack the rest of the islands!”\nThe Phoenix and Maverick guilds split up and agreed to attack the islands.\nAfter four days they were lucky to recover the rubber boats that had drifted away.\nLee Yong-wan parted with the Maverick guild and headed for the island, and he was able to reach the second island soon by entrusting himself to the calm waves.\n“Everyone, unload the supplies and build a camp first! We have to respond to the monster wave right away!”\nThe Phoenix guild quickly built a camp and started installing obstacles to deal with the wave as soon as they landed.\nWhen it was about halfway done, the hunters who had gone out for reconnaissance returned.\n“Guild leader! There’s something you need to see!”\nA guild member who urgently looked for Lee Yong-wan.\n“What is it?”\n“Well, there are traces of battle!”\n“If hunters were swept away here, it’s natural──”\n“No, it’s not that kind of trace! You have to see it!”\n“???”\nLee Yong-wan felt puzzled by the guild member who was pale blue and followed him to another sandy beach that was a little distance from where they landed.\n“This, this is…!”\nLee Yong-wan’s eyes widened when he saw it.\nIt was a trace of war.\nMore precisely, a war between the landing force and the defenders.\nIf that was all, he would have thought it was a trace of hunters fighting with wave monsters but that wasn’t it.\n“…Cannons?”\nThe scars of the monsters were not traces of being cut by cold weapons such as swords or spears.\nThey were mangled corpses, as if they’d been decimated by a powerful firepower.\nIt would be roughly like this if you watched the gruesome scene of a war documentary.\n“We have to go back quickly. This island is different. We have to prepare!”\n-Kiruk!\nIt was then that a lot of eyes that made him feel cold and Lee Yong-wan hurriedly aimed his bow at the island.\n-Kiruk kiruk!\n-Kikik!\nThe crab monsters he had seen on the island were staring at him, their inexhaustible gazes fixed on him.\nIf that was all, Lee Yong-wan, an S-class hunter, wouldn’t have much to worry about. These crab monsters were only numerous, not very strong monsters. But──\nArmor that fits perfectly along the thick shoulder blade bone and a line that looks like some kind of electric device connected to it.\nWhat was more surprising was that it wasn’t just that. The crab monsters all had something big and long on their backs. It looked like… ‘cannon’.\n“A cannon?”\n“They are armed with firearms! How come only on this island?!”\nNo, calm down. The island they were attacking wasn’t full of primitive monsters like the previous one.\nBut how can they use cannons only here? There is no way that there is such a gap in civilization. Surely that’s decoration──\n-Bang!\nThe cannonball shot past Lee Yong-wan and sank into the sea.\n-Kwang!\nThe shell exploded and raised a fountain of water as Lee Yong-wan clenched his teeth as he got hit by the rising fountain of water.\n“It’s real…”\nThere are hundreds of those cannons. It’s too much difference to start a battle rashly.\nHesitant Lee Yong-wan came up with some crab monsters carrying something on their shoulders. It looked like a big basket.\n-Kiruk kiruk!\n-Kikik!\n-Kikiruk!\nThe crab monsters bowing in reverence to the tribal chief-like existence decorated with flowers and wood ornaments from ancient times. It was… really an unexpected person… no, machine.\n“Yacht Spinner?!”\nYacht Spinner, the killing machine of Cheongju Gate, who received the reverence of crab monsters and came riding on a basket, was undoubtedly TTG Holy Knight Yacht Spinner.\n“Bow down to Brother Yappy, our Kikiruk tribe’s boss!”\nBehind him, wringing his hands and chanting, was the unmistakable Kim Jae-hyuk, a knight cadet of the TTG Guild.\n-Surrender, organic beings. You have no chance of winning.\n“”…“”\nYong-wan Lee put down his weapon with a pale face after seeing them.\nFirebird Guild suppression complete.",

      "content": "Chapter 80: Demon Archduke Rakshar (1)\n[‘The statue of the great Rakshar’ has been destroyed.]\n[Destroyed statues 1/3]\nThe first statue was destroyed and it was reported to all the hunters.\n“It looks like they destroyed the statue on another island, sis.”\n“Hmm…”\nThe statue discovered on the island where Ha-ri was located was found in a neglected place where bushes grew.\nThere were crab monsters resisting, but they were nothing more than fallen leaves in front of the power of the Maverick Guild.\n“Let’s destroy it soon. We only have to destroy one more.”\nThe opinions of the Maverick Guild members were very reasonable. It was natural to clear the quest of the gate in order to close the gate.\nBut the TTG Guild members, who had seen the duality of the gate several times, doubted that this time would be different.\n“Sis, do we have to destroy it?”\nSoo-ho cautiously asked Ha-ri for her opinion. Now that Leon or and were not there, Ha-ri was the biggest decision maker.\n“Sis?”\nBut there was no answer. Soo-ho turned his head toward Ha-ri, who was silent, and found that her face was pale.\n“Sis, what’s wrong? You don’t look good.”\n“No… no.”\nHa-ri couldn’t understand why everyone around her was peaceful. Surely they were looking at the same thing, so why didn’t they notice?\nThe terrible energy that the statue is suppressing.\n“We… can’t destroy this. If we destroy it… something terrible will happen!”\n“Sis?”\n“Han Ha-ri?”\nThe Maverick Guild members, as well as the TTG Guild members, reacted with curiosity to Ha-ri’s intense reaction since they can’t feel the energy that the statue is suppressing.\n“I, I, I know I’m saying something really weird, but this can’t be, this can’t be, there’s… something in here!”\nShe couldn’t tell what it was, or why she was the only one who could feel it. She could only wonder if something had changed in her since she had become a goddess of Poma.\n“What are you talking about?”\n“There’s something, there’s something! The statue is holding something back! You can’t touch this! Please tell them Poma!”\nHa-ri realized she couldn’t convince her on his own, so she turned to the gods. As much as she felt it, he must have felt it too.\n[…….]\n“Poma?”\nBut there was no sound of Poma’s voice.\nHa-ri tried to shake Poma, who was on her shoulder, but he remained stiff and unmoving, like something frozen in place.\n“Ugh…….”\nHa-ri stood in front of the statue as if to protect the statue from everyone.\n“Miss Ha-ri, what are you doing?”\nThe Maverick Guild members’ expressions hardened. No matter how they looked at it, Ha-ri’s reaction was not normal.\n“This… can’t be touched, no one. Never…!”\nHa-ri’s declaration of intent puts Allen in a bind since he’s a hunter on assignment from the United States.\nThe U.S. government, concerned about the security of the Pacific, has asked him to do one thing: to close the East Sea Gate as soon as possible and eliminate the security threat.\nHe needs to complete the quest, and Ha-ri’s actions are getting in the way. But Ha-ri’s status is too subtle to dismiss and force her.\nShe is not a guild member of the TTG Guild. She’s an employee of the Korean Hunter Association.\nThat means she’s a government employee, and as a foreign Hunter, it’s a burden to harm a government employee of another country.\n“Ms. Ha-ri, isn’t this a little out of line?”\nWell, she had a point so Allen decided to take his time convincing Ha-ri. After all, raiders and soldiers in foreign countries have their own rules.\n“Oh, I know, I know, I know, I’m so weird!”\nHa-ri couldn’t back down with a smile or a cry but Koo Dae-sung stepped forward to help her.\n“I’m Koo Dae-sung, a member of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild. Actually, Deputy Han has a point.”\n“Mr. Koo?”\nThe TTG Guild students looked at Koo Dae-sung, who raised his hand and stepped forward, with curious eyes. But he started to speak somewhat shamelessly.\n“Actually, Deputy Han has a unique skill related to foresight. It’s more like intuition than perfect foresight, but it’s pretty accurate.”\n“…!”\nAt that word, Ha-ri opened her eyes wide and looked at Koo Dae-sung.\n‘I don’t have that ability?!’\n‘…Please catch on.’\n‘Ah!’\nAllen asked with a suspicious look.\n“Han Ha-ri, is that true?”\nIt was a chance. She hesitated for a moment, but Ha-ri responded to Koo Dae-sung’s ad-lib.\n“It’s true! This is a pretty high-ranked unique skill! It’s not accurate, but something like intuition? Future foresight? That kind of feeling! Thanks to this, I survived several times!”\nWhen foresight skills were mentioned, the Maverick Guild members also became cautious.\nThere were occasionally hunters who had skills related to foresight in reality.\nThey prevented great disasters and this was officially confirmed.\nJust now, foresight skill holders from all over the world are predicting the ‘Wandering Demon Sword’ route and evacuating citizens. The number of lives saved by this will exceed hundreds of millions.\n“I’ve never heard of a foresight ability in Korea…”\n“She, she got her unique skill last year! She was our academy senior until last year!”\n“That’s right. Senior Ha-ri, getting a prophecy skill was quite famous in our academy!”\n“They said there was a lot of trouble with other guilds scouting.”\nThe TTG Guild students who caught on to Ha-ri and Koo Dae-sung’s play responded.\nAs the TTG Guild members responded one by one, Allen couldn’t just force them to destroy the statue.\nHe was a hunter who knew the situation and a gentleman.\n“Okay, but I can’t wait long. The wave gets stronger as it repeats, and there is a limit to stopping it.”\nHe would wait. That was the last compromise Allen could make.\nAnd so began a strange standoff──\n“What? Why haven’t you destroyed the statue yet?”\nMinuteman and Maverick Guild members who had destroyed the statue arrived and said so.\n‘It’s a strange situation.’\n[Damn, it’s annoying.]\nReynold arrived at the second island and stared at the TTG Guild members who were in a standoff over the statue.\nHe knew the situation. A guild member named Han Ha-ri blocked the destruction of the statue with a unique skill as an excuse, and Allen decided to stop destroying it because he thought it made sense.\n“A unique skill. It’s a tricky situation.”\nMinuteman, who had the same authority as Allen, also became cautious when the unique skill was mentioned.\n[Following the system too closely is also a problem!]\nModern humans blindly trusted the system and the awakened ones. They didn’t even know who created the system window, they just thought it was the salvation of humanity and didn’t doubt it.\nIt was natural. So far, the system has been the reason why humans have survived. There were those who doubted the system and its intentions, but they were very few of them.\nThat’s why everyone became cautious when Ha-ri mentioned her foresight skill. The Demon of Wisdom had to prepare a means to break it.\n[We must hurry, it’s not like she can keep him bound forever!]\n‘Since she’s claiming to be a unique skill, it must be destroyed.’\n[Then the method is simple.]\nThere is the Demon of Wisdom and America’s leading archmage so it was a simple matter to expose the lie that Ha-ri came up with on the spot.\n“Han Ha-ri.”\n“Yes…Master of Magic Tower.”\n“Can I do a unique skill appraisal?”\n“What?”\n[A system is a collection of information, after all. Figuring it out is no big deal!]\nThe Wisdom Jewel produced a skill appraisal on the spot from trivial items. It was a skill that surprised even Reynold.\n“Sk, skill appraisal?”\n“Yes, it’s nothing. It’s just to understand the skill and how the conclusion was derived. You won’t refuse unless what you said was ‘false’, right?”\n“Ah…”\nBecause Reynold’s smiling face, and the Maverick guild members who were annoyed by the delay Ha-ri couldn’t refuse Reynold’s request.\nOf course──\n“This damn! She tricked us!”\n“Why did you do this, Miss Ha-ri …?”\nThe lie was soon exposed and there was no such thing as an intuition-like skill from the beginning.\n[‘The Statue of the Great Rakshar’ has been destroyed.]\nDestroyed statues 2/3\n-Kurururung!\nAround Rakshar the light of the huge statue went out. In other words, it means that the island’s statue was broken.\n“…”\nLeon opened his eyes and stared at Rakshar. In the deep sea, he seemed to smile with a twisted smile.\n[It’s my victory, Lionheart.]\n“There’s still one left.”\n[You are overconfident in your subordinates, Lionheart. Now there is only one left so I will now escape from this disgusting prison.]\nThe last of the seals that held him back glowed, and a giant chain seized Rakshar’s tentacles.\nRakshar moved his huge body to get out of the chain. Just by doing that, the traces of civilization were shattered and shook the continent.\nWhen he finally couldn’t get out of the last chain, Rakshar raised his pincers.\n-Kwadeuk\nRakshar cut off his tentacles and got out of the chain. Even though he cut off his own feet, Rakshar didn’t flinch and tried to soar toward the light.\n-Kiiiiiiiiing!\nIt was then that around Rakshar the city that sealed him, ‘81’ statues that seemed to have stopped functioning, spewed out huge heat rays at Rakshar all at once.\nEach one is comparable to a great magic…Final weapons that burn at the molecular level but even with their indiscriminate attacks, Rakshar calmly bit his lips.\nHis remaining tentacles wrapped around and threw and broke the statues.\nThe city could not hold Rakshar’s ankles.\nWhen even the last obstacle failed to stop him, Rakshar pushed the ground and soared above the water surface.\n-Kuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa────!!\nRakshar soared and nothing could stop him.\nGiant deep-sea fish were died with their guts exposed by just brushing them, and the fish that couldn’t even think of running away died in groups.\nThe moment he finally showed his appearance above the water surface, the system recognized him.\n[Demon Archduke of Chaos Rakshar has awakened.]\n[His existence crushes everything alive.]\n【 Aura of Chaos 】\n◆Effect\n: Weakness, Chaos, Creepy, Confusion, Tetanus, Scream, Fear, Confusion, Despair, Physical Decay, Mental Contamination, Soul Erosion────\n【 Legendary Demon 】\n◆Effect\n: Unrecognizable.\n【 Demon Archduke Rakshar 】\n◆Effect\n: Unrecognizable.\nTraits continue to show up in message windows as Demon Archduke Rakshar affects everything alive in this gate just by coming up above the water surface.\nArchduke of Chaos Rakshar declared for the first time in hundreds of years after coming up above the water surface.\n[I am Rakshar…!]\nRakshar roar echoed throughout the sea as deep-sea fish trembled in fear and fish suffocated.

Not yet.”\nThere is a prerequisite for his last move.\n“Han Ha-ri, you foolish child, I’ll bet on you.”\nLeon builds up his strength since this was not the time to act.",

      "content": "Chapter 81: Demon Archduke Rakshar (2)\nRakshar moved.\nIts massive body brought the ocean to its knees just by stepping out of the depths.\nThe mere act of walking unleashed a tidal wave, churning the sea.\nFish rose to the surface in droves across the vast expanse of water. Choked fish wash up with the waves, becoming waves of corpses.\n“What, what is that?”\nThey noticed the change almost at the same time.\nA terrifyingly dense wave of magic power was coming from the sea. Even if dozens of great spells were released in quick succession, the air wouldn’t be this heavy.\nAll living creatures, not only those with systems, trembled in fear, realizing the evil that shook this world.\nThey all sensed his presence even though they couldn’t see it in front of their eyes.\n“What’s going on? Abrams! Identify it right now!”\n“Ah, yes.”\nAbrams hurriedly moved his gaze to the sandy beach as Allen reacted nervously despite his gentlemanly personality.\nPossessing the unique skill of clairvoyance, he looks out over the sea and sees it.\n“What is that… That, that…….”\nThe shape of a mutant can be seen from far away even from within the island. If you look at the dozens of tentacles, it seems like a mollusk, but the carapace that covers the whole body is sturdy and smooth like a helmet bug.\nBut decisively, seeing his hideous head and pincers that seemed to cut both ends of the island, he could only think of it as a demon of another world.\nIt was a terrible and overwhelming, literally gigantic monster that he could not imagine how it evolved.\nHe didn’t know, but Abrams and his eyes met.\n‘Did our eyes meet? At this distance?’\nIt’s coming, looking straight at him. Was he targeted? Glared at? As if staring at prey…\n[Chaos Pollution is inflicted.]\n“Ah, uh…”\nThe island vibrates with the giant’s breath.\nIs this real?\n“Ah, ah, hee, heehee…….”\n“Abrams? What are you doing!”\nAllen put his hand on Abrams’ shoulder. But Abrams pushed his arm away with bloodshot eyes.\n“I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die. You have to die!”\nAt that moment, Abrams’ bow was aimed at Allen. The moment he pulled and shot the bowstring, he reflexively swung his spear and cut off both arms. It was minimal suppression.\n“Wh, what are you doing…!”\nAllen reacted reflexively to Abrams’ sudden behavior, but was confused by his colleague’s rampage.\nNo one would know that Abrams’ attempt to kill Allen was born out of pure goodwill more than anyone else.\n“End, it’s over… It’s all over. End, end──”\n“Get a hold of yourself!”\nAbrams kept banging his head on the floor as if trying to escape from something scary. His mind was filled with chaos.\n“Bo, boss… there…….”\nIt was then. The huge presence that narrowed down the distance and could barely be seen with clairvoyance approached in an instant.\nAllen realized its identity through the system window.\n“Oh, archduke ? Archduke ?!”\nA demon of a scale never seen before.\nThe most powerful demon humanity had ever faced was the Archdemon.\nThey were horrified by the appearance of evil itself because they couldn’t even imagine that there was a more powerful existence than that.\nAlso──\n【 Aura of Chaos 】\nAn overwhelming aura that crushes existence.\nAll living things knelt down without being able to resist an aura that was completely different from when they carried Leon’s blessing.\nEven Leon had a limit to his aura distance but Rakshar’s aura was a terrible pressure that crushed the whole world.\n“Oh, no. No way. We can’t beat that.”\nDespair rises in the hunters’ eyes. They were trembling so much that they couldn’t even think of running away.\nThey don’t understand.\nWhy? Why were those things targeting Earth?\nNo, why did human civilization survive when there were such things in the first place…….\nEventually.\nUntil Rakshar stood before them no one could move a single step.\n-Kraaaaa──\nNo one’s breathing can be heard. Only the breath of the archduke flowing sinisterly on the island can be heard by them.\n[Kr, kr, kr──]\nHe roared loudly enough to make their ears burst but Rakshar didn’t care and continued his roar.\n[Submit.]\nIt was his first ‘civilized conversation’. At the same time…\nThud!\nAnd all the creatures knelt down.\nThere was no hesitation. There is no fool who does not know how foolish it is to oppose an invincible being.\nThey couldn’t control their teeth trembling, their arms and legs twitching, and their lower body that seemed to wet themselves at any moment.\nThe only thing that came to mind was to beg for mercy from the other party through submission.\n-Kkakakaka──\nRakshar was pleased with the submission of the humble ones. He stared at one creature who did not kneel.\n“Ah…….”\nHa-ri felt his ‘gaze’.\nShe shouldn’t have been seen by such a giant creature , but she felt his gaze.\n[There’s an unpleasant smell.]\nHa-ri wanted to wake up the god who was sleeping on her shoulder but she had a hunch that if he tried that, she would be stepped on and killed by that huge thing.\n-Kukakakaka──!\nA loud rumble spreads and all living things have knelt down. They shed tears and could not resist.\nEven the S-class hunter Allen Taylor, who was called the strongest of humanity, lost his will after seeing Rakshar.\nThe same was true for S-class hunter Minuteman and the rest of the A-class Maverick attack team and they had a different black aura rising from them.\nIn the end, only Ha-ri could stand on her own two legs in front of that magnificent being.\nShe didn’t know it, but in Leon’s absence, she was the only one who had the protection of the gods and Rakshar knew this, too.\nRakshar could handle Ha-ri himself. He could beat her to death with his giant tentacles, or grab her and swallow her in one bite. But savoring the delicacy was not his priority. Rakshar’s attention was on an old grudge match.\n-Tsk, tsk, tsk!\nThose who dared to seal him away and keep him in those shackles for so long. They should be the first to suffer his wrath.\nRakshar’s gaze traveled to the island where the remaining statue lay. He moves, and a tidal wave rises, washing over the Hunters.\n* * * *\nThe tidal wave washed over the Hunters, and they barely managed to get to their feet, spitting up salt water.\nNevertheless, Ha-ri was relieved that the behemoth didn’t seem to care about them.\nWhatever happened, they were alive, or so she thought. But then──\n[The area is tainted with chaos. All living things are in a state of ‘confusion’]\nThe entire region was tainted by Rakshar’s passage, just for that simple reason?\n“Hmph, hmph… hmph, hmph…….”\nBut a familiar chuckle from behind her back.\nThe cackle of despair, of giving up on everything, echoes ominously.\n“Hmph, hmph…!\n“I must… die.”\nThe human voice choruses in a cacophony that is chilling to listen to.\nJust as Abrams did when he first saw the Rakshar, all living things have seen the Rakshar and lost the ability to think normally.\nChaos.\nDespair.\nScreams.\nAll that remained was purely instinctive goodwill, which was──\n“Kaaaah!”\nThey swing their sword towards a comrade.\n-Caw!\nSlashing, stabbing, and dismembering each other here and there. It was only a matter of moments before Ha-ri realized what happened.\n“What are you all doing- -Ugh!”\nA flurry of spears stabbed at Ha-ri and although she managed to block it, but the impact alone knocked her back a few steps.\nAllen Taylor.\nEven S-class Hunters, who were said to be the strongest of the human race, were stunned by the sight of Rakshar.\nMinuteman, a fellow S-class Hunter, in addition, the A-class Maverick raiding party was moving, and a different black aura was emanating from them.\n[Blessing of Archduke Rakshar]\n: To all who submit──■■■■■\nDestroy.\nRuin.\nObedience.\nTheir pride as America’s finest hunters was shattered along with their humanity and they realized.\n“We are… too weak.”\n“You’re mistaken. With this much power… you’re Class S, you’re the best hunters… you’re looking down on us…….”\nTheir eyes are filled with despair and there is an uneasy air.\nIt was an air of abandonment and degradation.\n“Oh, no…….”\nHa-ri cried out. The only good thing was that their killing spree did not include the members of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild.\nPerhaps they were blessed by the gods, or perhaps they had been eating blessed crops in between but they are trembling, crushed by Rakshar’s pressure, and dare not move.\nOnly members of the Maverick Guild are able to move their cowardly legs in exchange for obedience to Rakshar.\nIt is clear what those who can move will do from now on.\nKill each other, help each other commit suicide, and give each other whatever chaotic goodwill they can.\n“Jugger, jugger! Jugger—-! That’s the right thing to do!!!”\nAllen raised his spear.\nBy the time Ha-ri instinctively raised her sword, the spear was already raining down.\n-Crack!\nThe weight of the spear was transmitted through the sword and Ha-ri was pushed back.\n“Grrr… Mur, stop──”\nInstantly, Ha-ri felt a pressure above her head and when she looked up she saw Minuteman slamming his giant gauntlet down.\nMinuteman’s fist barely missed but a shockwave hit the floor, knocking Ha-ri to the ground.\n“Kuck?!”\nHa-ri’s light body bounces off the ground, she rolls on the ground, sand in her face, and bounces again and again.\n“That’s enough…!”\nWhen she gets up, she’s faced with Allen’s spear barrage.\nShe dodged his spears with the best reaction of her life but a slash across her forearm, a graze across her thigh, a graze across the nape of her neck appeared.\nIn less than ten seconds, Ha-ri’s body is ravaged.\n“Ugh…!”\nHa-ri, who had been struck thirty times by Allen, was already bleeding all over but she didn’t let go of her sword, even though she looked like she was about to die.\n“Kill──!”\nIt was then that an impossibly large fist slammed into Allen’s back as Minutemen had swooped down on Allen.\n-Kwak! Kwak! Kwak!\nAllen is sent flying, bouncing off the floor but with him out of the way, Minuteman sets his sights on Ha-ri.\nJust as Minuteman’s fist was about to strike Ha-ri’s abdomen──\n-Bang!\nHa-ri’s body bounces into the air, the gravity pulling her down to the surface.\n* * * * *\nThe sun may shine on the surface, but beneath the surface is an abyss that never ends.\nHa-ri stretched out her hand, watching the light fade as it mixed with her blood.\n‘Ah… will I die like this?’\nIf she’d known, she’d have used her savings.\nHa-ri had been orphaned for reasons that are commonplace in modern times.\nCaught in a dungeon break, or a gate raid── the epitome of the typical 21st century orphan, raised in a state-run orphanage to provide for the children who flooded the streets after the Cataclysm.\nShe wasn’t rich, but she wasn’t poor either, and while she didn’t want a private education, she had the talent to get one.\nShe dreamed of being a righteous hunter.\nHer parents died saving the world, as the orphanage’s director told all the children.\nEven though there must have been countless other cases, the director wanted Ha-ri to be proud. She wanted the children to be proud of their parents, whom they had never met.\nEven though the story was a lie, Ha-ri never lost sight of her goal of becoming a great hunter.\nSo she was naturally disillusioned with the Ten Guild’s rhetoric about defending the nation and protecting its citizens when she realized that their priority was money.\nShe turned down the huge salary offered by the Ten Guilds and joined the Hunter’s Association.\nIn the Hunter’s Association, she thought she could at least fight to protect people but even as an employee of the Association, she could only do so much.\nSurely the Hunter’s Association was fighting a better fight than the Guilds and they were doing more valuable work but that’s all it was\nThey were not moving forward.\nSame as it was 30 years ago, same as it is now, same as it will be 30 years from now.\nIn the end, all Ha-ri could do was adapt to reality and become a lazy civil servant waiting for her pension, just like any other civil servant.\n“This King is the Lionheart King, King of the Glorious Knights and agent of the Gods, Leon Dragonia Lionheart.”\nWhen she first saw him, she thought he was crazy.\nAuthoritarian, superstitious, discriminatory, arrogant, misguided, and rabid.\nHe doesn’t belong in the 21st century and it was no exaggeration to say he was a barbarian but he had a will, a purpose, a conviction, and the power to carry it out.\nInadvertently, she wondered if he could change the world, so when she was chosen to be a priestess of the god of the sea and waves, she was pleased.\n‘Damn… damn…!’\nBut why?\nWhy am I so helpless?\nUnlike the Lionheart King, whose mere existence gave her hope, she couldn’t even stand on the toes of that knight, Sir Georgic, let alone the Lionheart King.\nWould it be any different if she were like Yakt Spinner?\n“Come, let’s go. My brothers and sisters. Today we will die for justice. The gods will look upon us.”\nShe willingly chose to die, sparking the final flame.\nEven her final moments, could not keep the flames──\n‘That’s right. The fire goes out right away…….’\nDamn gods! Gods who can’t help her!\nNo matter how much she stretches out her arms, all she can grab is a handful of water. Even if it was a senseless act, all she can do is reach out with her hands in desperation, but even that scatters meaninglessly.\n‘Do something! Do something!’\nAt that very moment, the turtle she had missed during the battle with Allen and Minuteman appeared in front of her.\n“……!”\nThe turtle’s gaze was different than before.\nThe sea god, who had been devious and sinister, intoxicated by the smell of women’s flesh and dazzled by the sight of bare skin…was looking down at Ha-ri with a more serious gaze than ever before.\n[Han Ha-ri]\nPoma said.\n[Do not try to grasp the sea, for you are but a handful of water in the palm of the endless ocean.]\n[The ocean cannot be grasped, but you can throw yourself into its embrace.]\nI don’t know what you mean.\nBut all I know is that what I’ve done so far is meaningless.\n[You have holy power within you but using it does not mean becoming a Holy Knight. A Knight of the Gods does not belong to the idea of limits.]\n‘I don’t know what you’re talking about, it’s… so vague!’\n[What you lack is not strength; fill your heart with faith and trust; perceive and understand the enormity of what you hold.]\nAnd again, unintelligible words.\nI don’t understand, for what I need now is a miracle, and what does a miracle-maker expect from a rascal like me.\nAs if reading Ha-ri’s intentions, Poma said.\n[Do not look for miracles, but perform miracles. The most favored of the gods do not beg the gods for power.]\n“…….”\n[Listen to the sea, for it is infinite, and if you did not know that you are held in its embrace, you will now feel it.]\nI once peered through the telescope of an observatory.\nI’ve looked through the eyes of a telescope in the orphanage. Like when I zoomed in on the vastness of the universe, the vastness of the ocean it’s the same.\nYour senses relay information about the world you’re immersed in.\nThe tumultuous movement of the currents, the flailing of the coral reefs, the gently swaying of the seaweed in the currents.\n[A world of nothingness, a handful of seaweed, a handful of water.]\nInfinite power is not to be grasped, but embraced.\n[Finite beings, mortal ahimsa, if you wish to attain your true immortal power.]\nDo not try to grasp it.\nInfinity is to be worn.\nYou are now, within the infinite.\nOnce Ha-ri realized this, she realized what she could do.\nShe feels the ocean, is surrounded by it, and controls its waves.\nIn the infinite ocean, her gesture would become a wave.\nHer senses have even reached the Lionheart King in the Deep.\nHoly Art\nAt that moment, from the bottom of the ocean to the sky above the surface the sea split in two.\nAt that very moment──\n-Purrrr!\nFrom the depths of the ocean a Pegasus rose.",

      "content": "Chapter 82: Demon Archduke Rakshar (3)\nRakshar moved toward the last of the statues.\nNot so much for the sake of destroying it, but for the sake of his long-standing grudge against the native creatures of this land.\nIt is only fitting that the enemies who sealed him and kept him should be prioritized.\n-Kiruk!\n– Kiruk!\nFrom the islands all around came the clawed creatures, tens of thousands of them, the clans that instinctively came to stop Rakshar when his seal was broken.\n[Obedience──!]\nRakshar’s cry made the world tremble but the native creatures resisted.\n[Hmm?]\nDemon Archduke of Chaos Rakshar is an evil demon that taints life itself. All who face him descend into chaos, unable to maintain their sanity.\nWith very few exceptions.\n[Holy Knight…!]\nThere was a divine energy on that island that could withstand even his own magic and Rakshar knew who they were, having invaded the world of knights long ago.\nChosen by the gods to change the laws of the land, they should have killed most of them, so how could they exist on that island?\nHe couldn’t imagine anyone else being so favored by the gods.\n[No wonder!]\nRakshar swung his giant tentacles around and slammed them into the Kikiruks.\n-Boom!\n-Bang!\nA thunderous explosion struck Rakshar but mere firearms meant little to Rakshar.\nHis armor is so hard that the difference between an arrow and a shell is meaningless but these shells are different.\n-Battery three, firing. Fall back to cool barrels. Move the ammunition carriers.\nHoly Knight Yakt Spinner, Saint of the God of Iron and Blacksmithing.\nEverything he touches is a holy object in itself, imbued with holy power.\nIt was these Holy Grenade shells that gave the overwhelming Rakshar pause.\nIt was a feeble struggle as Rakshar raised his claws high, slapped the water, and a huge tidal wave rose.\nForty-six meters high, a natural disaster capable of wiping out life on a single island.\nThe moment the terrifyingly high waves were about to overwhelm the island──\n[Holy Law]\nThe waves, which seemed to be about to overwhelm the island at any moment, scattered. That’s not all, the waters beneath Rakshar’s feet swirled and turned upside down, trapping him.\n──!\nRakshar’s gaze is fixed on a single point. Above the blue expanse, a dazzling pure white divine beast stared down at him.\n[Lionheart…!]\nLeon and Han Ha-ri looked down at Rakshar.\n* * * *\nThe moment Han Ha-ri used her miraculous holy power, the pressure of the deep sea that had trapped Leon temporarily cracked.\nLike the miraculous parting of the biblical Red Sea, Leon didn’t miss it.\n“Stallion!”\nHe summoned his oldest ally and Stallion, who understood the situation in a flash, picked up Leon and spread his wings.\n-Heh!\nThe Pegasus soared through the air as crumbling sea walls and deep-sea fish pounced on Leon, but the fastest and best steed dodged them all with ease.\n“Stallion, let’s get out of here first.”\nLeon used the power of Poma to pluck Ha-ri from the surface and grabbed by the nape of her neck, Ha-ri gasped for air.\n“Your Majesty?”\nHa-ri gulped and spat out the seawater she’d swallowed, then looked up at Leon and smiled as if she’d found a savior.\n“Well done.”\nLeon praised frankly, then tucked Ha-ri in front of him as she reported what happened.\n“The Demon Archduke has been resurrected, and everyone is going crazy, killing each other and cutting themselves…!”\n“I know. It’s hard for criminals to stay sane in the face of great evil.”\nLeon quickly landed on the island where the Maverick Guild and the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods Guild were. In the midst of the scuffle, as each side swung their weapons at the other, he called out.\n“I’m here!”\nLeon’s voice rings out. At that moment, not only the members of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild, but also the Maverick Hunters see a system window before them.\n[Lionheart Aura]\n◆Effect\n: ──────\nGrants Legion-enhanced Corruption Resistance.\nAmong the many effects of the Lionheart is the ability to purify pollution.\n[Demon Lord Slayer]\nWith a great being in front of you who has slain even a Demon Lord, you regain your senses──\n[Greatest Demon Slayer]\nThe effect of granting a percentage reduction to all demons’ actions was granted to everyone.\nCrucially, the light from the Holy Grail Leon took out healed their wounds and restored their shattered spirits.\n“Uh, uh?”\n“My, what did I do…….?”\nThe awakened Hunters stare at each other and it wasn’t long before they turned their gaze to Leon.\n“You lowlifes, if you’ve come to your senses, prepare now.”\n“What are you talking about?”\nAllen asked naturally, waiting for Leon’s instructions. All the Mavericks fell to their knees, feeling the holy power radiating from the Lionheart King and the Sea Goddess.\n“You are of no help. Run for the gate now.”\n“What?”\nInwardly, I was relieved that this wasn’t an order to fight Rakshar, but run for the gate?\nThe gate was in the middle of the ocean and there weren’t enough boats to take everyone.\n“You have before you a new daughter of the sea god. Have faith, and you will walk on the surface of the water.”\nA new system message flew in front of them.\n[Protected by the Goddess of the Sea and Waves]\nEffect:\n-You gain a 35% advantage on actions in the sea.\n-Waves are favorably affected.\n-Penalties for being underwater are removed.\n-You can walk on water.\nIt was a favor given to those who worship the sea god but now that she’s awakened as a goddess of the sea, she’s able to bestow them to even the most ignorant of unbelievers.\n“It’s real.”\n“I can walk on water?”\nThey marveled at the miracle of not drowning and walking on the surface of the water.\n“Lionheart, what are you going to do?”\nAllen asked politely. Do you think even two people can stand up to such an evil? It was a natural thought.\n“Save as many survivors as we can. We cannot win against it in this world.”\nThe oceans of this world are Rakshar domain and their force was powerful enough to temporarily block even the power of the gods so they had no chance of winning in this world.\nLeon would buy time until he could get as many survivors to retreat.\n“Let’s go, Stallion!”\nStallion leaps to his feet at Leon’s shout, then Leon grabs Ha-ri by the scruff of the neck.\n“Your Majesty, Rakshar, Rakshar is attacking Lord Yappy!”\n“We’ll have to bind his feet first. Han Ha-ri, you do it.”\n“Me?”\nLeon sighed at Han Ha-ri’s half-question.\n“The whole world is an ocean, so how can you argue the impossibility. Manipulate the flow of the ocean and tie his feet.”\n“Eh, eh…!”\nHa-ri was at a loss, and Leon grabbed her by the shoulders and pulled her face close.\n“Your Majesty?!”\n“Close your eyes and concentrate. You have already heard the sound of the sea.”\nWhether Ha-ri blushed or not, Leon spoke from his experience as a senior priest.\n“The ocean is a flow. Think of it as one giant living thing. Manipulating the current is nothing more than moving your hands and feet. You will feel it now.”\nLeon was right. Ha-ri had awakened to the power of the ocean and its waves, and she could feel its flow.\nShe did as she was told, manipulating the currents around Rakshar to submerge the hulking Demon Archduke and trap him within.\nSensing that this was his limit, Leon continued to order.\n“Next, ignite the flames. You have been chosen by the God of War and Flame.”\n“What?! Flames? It’s underwater, so it won’t work──”\n“You fool, how dare you reduce the power of a god to a set of intelligible laws. The Holy Law is the power to change laws. No common sense you know applies there.”\nStir up fire. A sacred flame that will burn brightly even under the sea.\nHa-ri stoked the fire as usual. Once awakened, her powers bend to her will.\n“This fire cannot be extinguished by water. It flows like the currents and moves like the waves at your will.”\nLeon took Ha-ri’s hand to assist her. Then something amazing happened.\nHa-ri’s fire began to envelop Rakshar under the sea like a giant wave. The fire was indeed underwater, burning Rakshar without being extinguished.\n“I did it, I did it, Your Majesty!”\n“Well done.”\nLeon gave Ha-ri a rare pat on the head and landed in front of Yappy, who was still resisting Rakshar.\n“Your Majesty!”\nThere was not only Yappy, but also Yong-wan, Ha Yuri, and Kim Jae-hyuk from the Firebird Guild.\n“Lord Spinner. We need to get out of this gate right now.”\n-Enemy Severe blow. Gradual retreat possible.\n“No.”\nLeon denied Yappy’s speculation.\n-kraaaaaaaaaa──!\nA monstrous roar was heard as dozens of tentacles clawed at the bottom, breaking through the vortex of fire and the backwash of waves.\n“Close the gate and retreat.”\nLeon wanted to slice the Demon Archduke in front of him, but he lacked the strength.\nAt the very least, if he didn’t recover the Holy Sword, he wouldn’t be able to defeat Rakshar.\nWith his power limited, the best he could do was to save as many people as possible.\n“Lord Spinner. We must close the gate now.”\n-Gate closing conditions. To destroy the statue.\nDestroy the statue, then, and that’s it. Then, Yappy made an additional suggestion.\n-The Kikiruks. The clans that sealed the demon. Not ‘NPCs’.\n“Then?”\n-Survivors. Suggesting they leave.\n“Do you think we have time? It won’t be long before the divine punishment binding him is extinguished.”\n-Possible. Willing to use the last resort.\nWhile Yappy was worshiped as the savior of the Kikiruk, he read the island’s remaining records and their epitaphs.\nAs only he could interpret their language in real time he could read even the most weathered traces of civilization.\nAnd he knew that the Kikiruk had a last resort.\n* * * *\n[The ‘Statue of the Great Rakshar’ has been destroyed]\nDestroyed Statues 3/3\nAll the statues have been destroyed.\nRakshar, who had been imprisoned and sealed in the statues for hundreds of years, immediately recognized the change.\n[He intends to escape]\nRakshar knew the terms of the gate’s closure: if his seal was broken the gate would close.\nOf course, Rakshar had no intention of sparing the visiting Hunters, so it would be pointless, but they would flee while this pillar of fire bound him.\nWith the help of Ha-ri, the Sea Goddess, all of the Kikiruks raced across the surface of the water toward the gate.\nThe Holy Knight, revered by the Kikiruks, the beloved of the sea, and the Grail Keeper, who could bind even the mighty Rakshar.\nThree miraculous beings, all in one place.\n[A foe of the demons, indeed, but one step short]\nRakshar crawled out of the fire vortex.\nAs a Demon Archduke, the holy laws of the newly awakened priestess only served to bind his ankles for a moment.\n[Do you think you can escape?]\nA resounding roar that was enough to make all those fleeing stop in their tracks shook the sea.\n[Lionheart!]\nA steed and a knight with a spear swooped down. Just as Leon’s spear was about to pierce Rakshar by surprise, a long tentacle slammed into his flank.\n-Puck!\nWith a fierce crash, the steed plummets toward the sea. Just before its wings touch the water, the awakened Stallion barely manages to fly above the surface.\n“Stallion!”\nStallion dodges the threatening tentacles and Leon strikes with its lance at those it cannot.\nHe closes in until the sharp tip of his spear touches the giant beast.\n[Ugh!]\nRakshar’s gaze is fixed on Leon, and in that instant, his eyes glow with an immense amount of magic.\n-Kaaaaaahhhhh!\nThe light cut through space as the two reacted at the same time.\nThrowing themselves at each other, Leon and Stallion sliced through the magic beam with a juggling move. Leon was defenseless in the air, but he had a footing.\nLeon steps on Rakshar’s tentacles as they unfurl and keeps running.\n-Kwaah──\nJust as it was about to unleash its light once more, a spear pierced its eyeball but Rakshar didn’t stop his massive display of magic.\nThe magical light, centered on the spot where the holy spear pierced, tore the sky into dozens of splinters.\nA dark light filled the sky but Leon and Stallion ran through the light.\nTentacles lunge at Leon, but Stallion’s acrobatic flight evades them, and his holy sword slices through the flying tentacles.\n[Swatting like flies…!]\nStallion is knocked back into the air by the shower of magic light.\n[Holy Law]\nA spell that blocks all ranged attacks. However, in an instant, it is forced beyond the limit of his defenses, and the magic irradiation is more like a piercing blow to a massive mass than a ranged attack.\n“Stallion, hold on!”\n-Phew!\nLeon is finally pushed into the sky by the immense energy.\nIn the end, Leon is unable to reach Rakshar, and Rakshar is unable to finish him off with the blow he just delivered.\nEven in that moment, the two beings continue to pressurize each other.\n[Chaotic Curse] hits Leon Dragonia Lionheart, the Lionheart King]\n◆Effect\n: Weakness, Chaos, Eeriness, Confusion, Tetanus, Screaming, Horror, Confusion, Despair, Physical Decay, Mind Pollution, Soul Erosion────\nIt was a powerful curse that can kill a normal human instantly and drive a Hunter insane but the Grail Guardian’s has protection against it.\n[Grail Guardian] resists the curse]]\n◆Effect\nVitality, Order, Fear Immunity, Confusion Immunity, Wound Regeneration, Valor, Perfect Body, Pollution Resistance, Great Soul────\nPerfect Resistance.

His screams as he burned in these flames for thirty days still echo sweetly in my memory.”\nInstinctively recognizing the grotesqueness of it all, Rakshar gulped down a mouthful of seawater and spat it out at Leon.\nThe thousands of meters of water shot from the behemoth was enough to cut through the city. But it did nothing to extinguish the flames Leon had ignited.\nAs Rakshar concentrated his power in order to use the attack he used earlier.\n-Giruuuuuuuuuu!!!\nA giant being moved the waters and a raspy cry drew Rakshar’s attention.\nA huge presence that even Rakshar could not ignore surrounded him, clawing at him.\nThis was the last bastion of the Kikiruks that Yappy had found, they were ancient guardians.\n[There were still living ones!]\nThey were the last of the Kikiruks to be slain when Rakshar destroyed this world.\nThe giant Kikiruks charged at Rakshar.\n-kraaaaaaaaaaa──!\nThe beast roars even while being held back by the three giant Kikiruks and shoots out a black light of doom.\nAt the same time the beast is engulfed in roaring flames.\n[Divine Punishment]\nA black mass and a red meteor accelerate toward each other.

      "content": "Chapter 83: Demon Archduke Rakshar (4)\nIn the middle of the ocean, a pillar of fire rises.\nIt is a great flame that will surely burn anything.\nIts energy is absolute, like the compressed explosive power of a nuclear weapon. Not even a Demon Archduke could survive that pillar of fire.\n-Observation. Logic circuit error. Impossible.\nAt Leon’s denial, Yappy tried again to observe, and saw a creature moving within the steaming pillar of fire that was evaporating the pouring seawater in real time.\nDemon Dink Rakshar was still alive.\nIs there anything in this universe that can survive a direct hit of that kind of energy?\n“Lord Spinner. What’s the status of the evacuation?”\nLeon landed on Yappy, who was overseeing the evacuation. Leon and Stallion don’t say much, but their exhaustion is palpable.\n-80% progress. Major supplies, records secured.\n“A little short.”\n-No. They’ll hold on.\nYappy’s gaze turns to Rakshar, trapped in the pillar of fire. Or, more accurately, the three giant guardians surrounding him, pincers raised, keeping a watchful eye on Rakshar.\n“Have they made up their minds?”\n-Have been sleeping for this moment for 500 years. Analyzing the language system. Prosperity to Kikiruks.\n“Is that their name?”\nLeon held out his hand to Yappy, grateful for their sacrifice.\n“The gates are closing now. Let us retreat.”\nYappy climbs onto Leon’s forearm and boards Stallion, then Stallion flaps its wings and takes to the sky.\nAs they head for the gate, Rakshar calls out.\n[Lionheart…! Fleeing is not a virtue of knights!]\nAs he burns in real time in a pillar of fire, his eyes remain fixed on Leon as he engages in hand-to-hand combat with the three giant Kikiruks.\nLeon sneers.\n“I would not honor the code of knighthood against such a lowly creature as you. Green beasts and abominations are not worthy of respect.”\nWith those words, Leon sprinted toward the disappearing gate.\n[Lionheart────!!]\n[Gate closed]\n* * * *\nAfter the East Sea Gate was cleared, the world was abuzz for a while.\nThe first Demon Archduke was discovered. It was huge news for humanity, who had suffered terrible losses even against Archdemons until now.\nEven S-class Hunters couldn’t stand up to its mind pollution.\nNaturally, the world began to place large orders for Mind Defense items, but it was a meaningless waste of money.\nThe news was not all bad, however.\nThere were some beings whose minds remained untainted by the Demon Archduke’s terrifying aura.\nThe first was Han Ha-ri, a priestess of Poma, the god of the sea and waves.\nThe second was Yakt Spinner, the first Holy Knight of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.\nAnd finally, there was Leon, who not only resisted, but went toe-to-toe with the Demon Archduke.\n-Wow, what the fuck is that?\n-Was there ever a demon that big? Can we beat that thing?\n-Look at that. Flying around on a pegasus. They were almost evenly matched in hand-to-hand combat.\n-What’s with that crazy pillar of fire? Han Ha-ri’s flames in the waves didn’t even make sense, but that thing just pierced the sky.\n-The Otherworldly Lion King. Have you seen his Trait, The Greatest Demon Slayer? I mean, there’s no one in all the dimensions who’s slain more demons than that guy.\n-Is that a human?\n-Demigod.\nYappy’s footage of the Battle of the East Sea Gate was broadcast to the world via the guild YouTube channel.\nPeople don’t despair easily. They somehow find hope in the midst of despair.\nLeon was a symbol of that hope, and naturally, people began to learn more about TTG Guild and join.\nThe Maverick Guild’s S-ranked Hunter Allen and Minuteman, as well as other core A-ranked raiders, took it upon themselves to proselytize for the TTG Guild.\nAnd.\n“Uh, well, then… I hereby declare the district of Mokpo Special Autonomous Region of the Kikiruks as of today.”\n-Giggle!\nPresident Ahn Dong-gil smiled awkwardly and shook hands with the giant clawed creature.\nThe second issue was the mass migration of the Kikiruks. The relocation of the world’s largest group of 10,000 survivors required a huge administrative process and political decision that required the president himself.\n“Thank you, President Ahn.”\n“Ah…, no problem, Your Majesty.”\nAhn Dong-gil put on his best business smile and shook Leon’s hand.\nIn just a few short months, Leon had grown into a tycoon that even the president could not easily ignore, and he had brought with him an unprecedentedly large group of migrants: ten thousand survivors.\nPresident Ahn and the political establishment could not refuse Leon’s request to give them land to live on.\nThere was some opposition from the citizens of Mokpo, but their territory didn’t overlap with the human population, and as the head of the South Korean government, they couldn’t ignore the only power they had against the Demon Archduke.\n“That, Your Majesty… what is that?”\nPresident Ahn stared in disbelief at the giant statue of a turtle in the middle of the sea, along with the giant statue of a Kikiruk.\nWere they territorial markers for the survivors?\n“It honors a great hero who sacrificed himself against the Demon Archduke. In the center is a statue of Poma, the god of the sea and waves.”\nOoh, idolatry… No, it’s not even an idol. They were real gods, and they really did bestow grace and favor.\nPresident Ahn Dong-gil, a Protestant, had a bitter look on his face.\n“I don’t think that’s the only statue.”\n“Ah~ There’s one of this king and one of Lord Spinner. Lord Spinner is the actual representative of the Kikiruks.”\nLeon is a demigod, but now even machines are idolized… President Ahn suddenly realized that there was one more empty spot on the statue.\n“Haha, you have good eyes. That’s your seat, President Ahn.”\n“What?”\n“How can we not be grateful to the benefactor who gave us the land, and even the non-believers, the Kikiruks, will come and bow to your statue on their way.”\n“Oh, no, that would be idolatry… Oh, well, I don’t have a statue of myself anyway…….”\nLeon chuckled, patted President Ahn on the shoulder, and disappeared.\nAs a born-again Protestant and an honorary elder of Gangnam XX Church, he’s just worried about the keywords ‘idolatrous president’ that will be posted this weekend.\n“Mr. President.”\nJust then, the chief of staff approached Ahn. He had come in person to gesture to the media that he was friendly with Leon, but he was probably in a security meeting in Seoul right now.\n“What’s going on?”\n“It’s off the security agenda, but… I have an urgent intelligence report from the National Intelligence Service. It has to do with North Korea.”\n“North Korea? They’ve been so quiet lately, why?”\nSince the cataclysm, North Korea has gone from being the South’s headache to a troublesome neighbor.\nThey’ve given up their nukes in favor of gatekeeping, and a central government that has lost its authority has been unable to keep warlords from running amok.\nAt least they’re on good terms with the most orthodox government in Pyongyang, which hasn’t caused any trouble in quite some time.\n“We lost contact at midnight yesterday.”\nIf that were all there was to it, I’d have said, “What the hell,” and wondered if it was a protest to send rice.\nBut the information from the press secretary clearly foreshadowed something more.\n“Satellite observation over North Korea has been suspended. Reconnaissance satellites are not taking pictures of anything in North Korea.”\n* * * *\nOld Pyongyang, North Korea.\nJust as the continent was torn into 50 pieces by the effects of the cataclysm, North Korea could not escape the storm of the cataclysm.\nWarlords who had Awakened and gained power to deal with the Gate began to defy the chain of command in Pyongyang, and the North Korean government, which had lost what little conventional power it had in the early days of the Cataclysm, was powerless to control them.\nBy 2030, the North could only borrow strength from the South whenever a gate appeared.\nHere, in a barely functioning regime that had given up its nuclear arsenal, they hoped to rebuild.\nSectarianism began to spread after the Cataclysm. They were ready to summon the mighty Archdemon by attracting devil worshippers.\n“Heh, heh, heh, the Kang Seong Dynasty will be established by invoking the devil.”\nThe Pyongyang rulers who ordered all of this reviewed the monumental demon summoning.\nIt had been formed by sacrificing 100,000 of Pyongyang’s citizens. With the help of devil worshippers from around the world, a long-held desire would be fulfilled.\n[This is Reynald Shelman, we’re ready, you may activate the summoning circle].\nA signal came from the Yankee wizard. A signal that said something needed to be prepared, but after nearly a week of waiting, it finally came.\n“Summon!”\nWith a wave of his hand, the summoning circle began to glow. Ominously red and dark, it consumed the flesh and souls of the corpses laid before it.\nWhat was summoned was a giant beast.\n“Eh, eh?”\nDid they really not expect such a huge beast to be summoned? Or were they surprised to see that the beast was covered in wounds?\nNot only was the beast burned all over, but its hands and feet had been torn off.\nThe giant claw marks suggested a massive battle.\n“What’s wrong with the Great Demon? Did you summon it correctly?”\nDespite their leader’s pleas, the demon worshippers didn’t understand the situation.\n[Hmph~]\nRakshar looked down at the thousands of soldiers gathered in the summoning hall.\n[Hmph~]\nHis wounds were too deep to act immediately.\nRakshar realizes that he needs to recover first, as it will be some time before the other ‘Great Demons’ gather.\nUntil then, he’ll have to recover from the abundance of food.\n[Obedience──]\nAt that moment, the three million citizens of Pyongyang heard the voice.\n* * * * *\nWhen the TTG Guild building was constructed, it was not designed with underground space in mind.\nIt was basically built as a rice warehouse on a rural site and expanded as needed.\nHowever, when the otherworldly magician queen took up residence here, the building was transformed.\nFor example, she can take a space the size of a single room and expand it to the size of a soccer field with her space-expanding magic, warping space to create a subspace that no one but the magician could enter.\nModern wizards would have screamed at the top of their lungs about the ridiculousness of it all, but to a magician queen at the height of her powers, it was no big deal. And──\nIn the subspace beneath the TTG Guild that was decorated to look like an underground, a beautiful woman stood bound from head to toe.\nNo, more precisely, she is ‘not’ moving as if she is chained herself because she’s been told to.\nDespite the damp environment that makes prisoners uneasy, the direction of the space that makes even the smallest sound echo, and the created dreariness, the woman was shivering a little.\nAnd in such a dreary space, she creepily hears a new sound.\nAgain, again, again… A clear, crisp voice was approaching the inmate, Hilde.\n“How are you today? It’s been a bit noisy outside lately, it seems we’ve got some new neighbors.”\n“Uh…uh…uh!”\nHildir is not wearing any restraints and naturally, her lips were also unrestrained.\nBut all she can manage is a choked voice. There is only one reason for this is that a demonic charm has taken a firm hold on her, a magical presence that could corrupt even the oldest shaman in the service of a beast god.\nBeatrice, Queen of the Lost, with nothing but rage and vengeance in her heart, smiled bewitchingly at Hildir.\n“Hic…!”\nJust seeing that smile in her eyes was enough to make Hildir lose her mind.\nHow could such a deadly aura emanate from a human being?\nAn overwhelming need to give him everything she had, just to hear her voice, to see her face beneath the cotton cloth.\nBeatrice had a natural talent for mesmerizing even those of her own sex. The magician queen of Spero utilized her talents to corrupt the shaman of the beast gods.\n“I remember when I used to fight demons, it was pretty simple back then. It wasn’t really about interrogation, it was just about making them ‘suffer’.”\nBeatrice smiles brightly. Despite smiling, there’s not the slightest hint of cheerfulness in her smile. There’s just a creepy dryness to it, like it’s dried up and twisted.\n“But this time,” she says, “it’s purposeful. I want to know so many things about you… things that have mesmerized me and that you haven’t told me yet.”\n“Ugh!”\nHildir knew that death was not the end. She could do no more to betray the gods, not even for the sake of her soul, which would be captured by the beast gods after death.\nThis was etched into her soul and decided the moment she gave her soul to the Beast Gods, imprinting their imprints on her skin.\n“Yes, I thought so.”\nA slender finger caresses Hildir’s cheek in a knowing gesture, sliding down her arm. It’s enough to send her into a frenzy of happiness and pleasure, but the dry voice that follows brings her back to reality.\n“That’s how the demons who invaded the kingdom built their pride.”\nThere was a snap, and a sound like something breaking.\nBeatrice’s fingers, so soft and gentle, had snapped Hildir’s fingers.\n“Turn it off?!”\nEveryone screams in pain when their fingers are snapped in the opposite direction but Hildir was not allowed to make her voice heard.\nHer full-throated screams remain only in her mouth. Beatrice stroked Hilde’s cheeks and asked in a soothing voice,\n“They used a hundred years to corrupt me. How long will you last?”\nSeeing Beatrice’s smile, Hildir realized that she could not save her soul.\nShe realized too late that the matter had been decided from the moment she had given her soul to the demon.\nFor what seemed like an eternity, Hildir poured out everything she knew to Beatrice.\nAnd among them was──\n“……Is that true?”\nBeatrice sighed deeply as Hildir, covered in tears and snot, nodded.\n“Funny, demons can ‘go through any gate’.”\nThe gate is a phenomenon.\nDemons can use them to travel to any system and historical moment they wish.\nThen.\n“I guess that means we can go to any gate we want, too.”\nHoohoohoo….\nThe Magician Queen’s smile flashed across her face.",

      "content": "Chapter 84: Utilizing Gates\nThe coastal estuary of Mokpo.\nKrashatria, a.k.a. The Special Autonomous Region for the Kikiruks, was a hive of activity.\nWith the arrival of 10,000 survivors, administrative and local problems overlapped, and the first challenge was securing a place for them to live.\n“Okay, let’s dig by category on the tidal flats over here! It’ll be low tide soon, but you don’t mind, do you?”\n-Giggles!\n-Giggle!\nHan Ha-ri, recently established as a goddess of the sea and waves, has been working with Yakt Spinner, the de facto landowner of the Kikiruks, to help develop their settlement.\n“Lord Yappy, are we really going to build a house on a tidal flat? I hear they can breathe underwater.”\n-No problem. They’re self-sustaining, as long as they have nests and hunting grounds for breeding.\n“I think it would be a big deal just to feed them.”\nThe resources of tidal flats are not infinite. There was also a backlash from local residents who said it was destroying nature through overdevelopment.\nThe good news is that their fertility and growth rate returned to normal after leaving the gate.\nAlthough their lifespan is half that of humans, they can reach adulthood in three years, which is quite fast.\n-Collaboration with Mokpo City and neighboring coastal cities is planned.\n“Ah, so they’re used for fishing, community development, and menial labor?”\nEven though their average strength is below Class D, that alone is a tremendous force for labor. And with their freedom of movement in the ocean, they shouldn’t have any trouble finding work.\n“Survivors who are not used to modern Earth civilization are often scammed, so please tell them to be careful.”\nThe survivors receive substantial grants and state support. Unless you’re an outlier like Leon, there’s no shortage of settlement grants and monthly subsidies.\nOf course, there were scammers who took advantage of this, and although the number of cases is small, it is a serious social problem.\n-No problem. Signing up for the TTG Guild Life Assurance Service.\n“Life Assurance Service?”\n-It provides various services for all administrative and legal problems of subscribers.\n“Is there such a thing? Can I join?”\n-Already signed up.\n“……?”\nI’ve never heard of it.\n“Me?”\n-You’ve been benefiting from the peace of mind service for the past month.\n“…….”\nHa-ri felt a little uneasy.\n“Uh, how much am I paying?”\n-Ten percent.\n“Scammer!”\nHa-ri was about to say something in frustration, but then she felt cheap.\n“Wait… This time, they’ll be given a resettlement grant and a monthly subsidy, right?”\nThere are ten thousand survivors. The amount of money they’re legally guaranteed is astronomical.\n-Subscribed, of course. With nothing left.\n“Lord Yappy’s wealth management schemes are getting more vicious by the day!”\n-No one of the Kikiruks complained.\n“Of course not, they’re a race with no sense of economics!\nHeck, even orcs recognize the value of money, so they’ll sell drugs or work as mercenaries but the kikiruks don’t need money because they’re self-sufficient under the sea.\nA few fish a day was enough for them.\n“How did they open an account?!”\n-TTG Guild Reassurance Service.\n“How did you transfer the money? It’s not even yours!”\n-Hacked bank.\n“It’s a crime!”\n-I received consent.\nVicious. What in the world has he done to deserve this much money?\n“Don’t you think you’re a little too obsessed with money, even if the king told you to?”\n-For good measure.\n“What is it?”\n-Confidential.\n“Scammer…!”\nThat was it. As if on cue, Yappy hopped down from Ha-ri’s shoulder.\n“What’s going on?”\n-A dispute at the harbor. Someone is messing with the local fishermen’s fish allowance.\n“It’s a big deal, should I go help?”\n-No need. You’ll pay for it later when you go out to sea.\n“Ah…….”\nIt’s not just the kikiruks who have migrated to the Korean coast.\nWith the construction of an altar to Poma, the god of the sea and waves, the belief in Poma was also spreading among fishermen.\nPerhaps in the future, whether or not they worshiped him would determine the amount of fish they caught and the safety of their voyages.\n“Hmm… I feel like Korean society is becoming increasingly infiltrated by the TTG Guild, and there’s even a public opinion that all politicians should serve the goddess of light and justice.”\nThe petition came after news spread about divine punishment for failing to follow the goddess’ code.\nOnce, when reporters had interviewed Leon about the kingdom’s culture, it had become quite an issue.\n“So, Your Majesty, you’re saying that in your kingdom, nobles and officials were free of corruption?”\n“Of course not. There were some scum who foolishly got caught up in the greed of the moment, but that’s okay, they’ve all been torn to shreds.”\n-So… all the corrupt ones went to hell?\n-There is no hell in the Ten Thousand Gods doctrine. It’s either heaven or reincarnation.\n-The soul is torn apart and reincarnated according to the weight of the sin.\n-If it’s too heavy, your soul is destroyed.\n-Lol.\n-Shouldn’t we apply this to all politicians so they can all go to hell?\n-Honey.\nThe South Korean political establishment broke out in a cold sweat and claimed religious freedom in response to the petition.\nA white-winged pegasus landed in front of Ha-ri and Yappy, who were circling the shore to check on the kikiruks.\n“Your Majesty!”\n-Your Majesty.\nThe two casually dropped to one knee in deference. Leon said.\n“Get on.”\nWhen Leon offered to take her aboard Stallion, Ha-ri was surprised. This was the king’s steed, Stallion usually only carried Queen Beatrice or Yappy.\nIt was an emergency at the East Sea Gate, but this time it was really unexpected──\n“Your Majesty?”\n“Uhm…….”\nLeon stared at Ha-ri with a puzzled expression as she tried to figure out how to get on Stallion.\n‘Is it because I’m a lowly commoner that you don’t want me to ride?!’\nThis Lionhearted King was the embodiment of classism.\n“Whoa…….”\nLeon sighed for some reason, then dismounted and held out one hand in a polite gesture. It was knightly etiquette.\n“Get on.”\n“Eh?!”\nHa-ri’s eyes widened at the polite, gentle tone she’d never heard before.\n“Why, why are you doing this, you’re scaring me…….”\n“Ride on, fool,” was the usual response, “It’s an honor for a lowly commoner to ride the king’s horse.”\nThe sight of Leon politely extending his hand to invite her to ride was more than astonishing, it was horrifying.\n“Tsk. Get on.”\nLeon clicked his tongue in disbelief, but politely put Ha-ri on his horse. As he soared into the sky, he handed her a document.\n“What, what is this?”\n“A manor.”\n“A manor?”\nWhat Leon handed over was a land document for a part of the Naju Plain. A deed, to be exact.\n“The land is yours. Take care of it.”\n“Uh, uh, is this real?”\nIt’s not a big piece of land, but it’s where the blessed crops grow, so it’s worth it. Ha-ri looked like she’s asking if she deserves this, but Leon gave her a wry smile.\n“As a knight of the realm, it is customary for the kingdom to grant you a manor. I know it’s unclear where you belong, but as someone chosen by the gods, it’s only natural.”\n“Hmm…I still don’t quite understand why the gods chose me.”\nHa-ri was essentially chosen by Petos, the god of war and flame since her affinity for fire was so innate that it manifested as a unique skill.\nBut even Poma, the god of the sea and the waves, chose Ha-ri as his maiden, not only because she was beautiful… but for a surprisingly different reason.\nPurity.\nThe gods favor those who are unspoiled, blank slates.\nAs knights swear to love purely, the purity of their view of the world is a rare gift.\nEspecially in the twenty-first century, a human like Ha-ri was a rarity, so she was sure to attract attention.\n“In any case, you are now officially a knight of the realm and a goddess. Be aware of your position and spread the word of the gods.”\n“Ah, I understand, my lord, and I will do my best──”\n“And mend that ridiculous way of speaking. I will not ask for a lady’s manners, but you need not lower yourself.”\n“Ah, yes, I understand…!”\nHa-ri now realized that she was now a noble who would be treated differently by Leon. If she was given a manor, wasn’t she a de facto noble?\n“Your Majesty?”\n“Speak.”\n“So am I a noble now?”\n“Yes……..”\nHa-ri couldn’t resist asking with a smirk on her face, so he admitted it.\n“Yes, you are. You’re second only to the Queen and Lord Spinner, at least in the pantheon.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Hmm?”\n“Then Lord Yappy!”\n-Hmm?\nYappy hopped up on her shoulder at Ha-ri’s question.\n“Don’t be disrespectful to me in the future, I’m…I’m a noble too, noble.”\n-Snap!\n“Ack, when did you hit me, now?!”\n-Don’t be rude, organism. No respect for an unintelligent monkey.\n“Your Majesty, ahh… we’re the same noble, but I got hit.”\nLeon sighed deeply as he watched Ha-ri cry out in frustration.\n* * * *\nIn a separate warehouse in the TTG Guild compound, Beatrice set up her magic workshop.\nAs the Magician Queen of the Kingdom of Spero and the High Priestess of the Goddess of Dreams and Death, she has many powers.\nAmong them is the ability of entering a target’s dreams and extracting information from them, and that target was Hildir, the “thing” they captured in the Jeju Gate.\n“You have come, Your Majesty.\nBeatrice greeted Leon.\n“How are the results of your research?”\n“Successful, I say. Would you like to see it?”\nBeatrice showed the Crown of Craving, the centerpiece of her workshop.\nIt was the crown of craving, obtained by defeating the former Archdemon of Pleasure, Androzin. It had been recovered by Fle, the goddess of dreams and death.\n“It became clear that the demons were using the gates, as your Majesty had predicted.”\nThe questions began with the Fluctuation Gate.\nHow could the demons have changed the gate to a Demon Gate in time for Leon’s entry?\nCoincidence? Yes, it could be a coincidence. But the suspicions came to a head at the Jeju Gate when the quest to save the slaughtered and defeat the majestic Georgic appeared.\nIt was seemingly just a quest to save the barbarians who had sold their souls to an evil god and defeat the honorable Holy Knight.\nAt this point, Leon was convinced that the system and the quests given to the Awakened were not “well-meaning,” but rather “malicious” in their intentions to steer the Awakened to their own ends.\nThen came the East Sea Gate.\nThis quest culminated in the destruction of the stone statues that held the seal of the Demon Archduke Rakshar.\n“As it turns out, the gate is divided into two types: ‘real space’ and ‘imaginary space’.”\n“What is real space?”\n“The Kingdom of Spero, where I was, the city that Lord Yappy guarded, and the Black Gate that you returned from, in other words, the gates where the ‘survivors’ are.”\nThose places have one thing in common.\nThey are home to survivors of worlds that have not been completely destroyed and have not been completely taken over by demons.\nIn reality, Beatrice was merely undergoing a hundred years of time looping and corruption, and the Cheongju Gate also had a millennial guardian in the form of the Yakt Spinner.\nThe same is true of the gate to which Leon returned, where the demons were eventually slaughtered and the last survivor survived, but the world was not conquered by the demons.\n“The second example, on the other hand, is just a place that mimics the real world; it’s literally a virtual space that takes a moment in the past and recreates it.”\nThis was the case with the Orc Gate, and it was the case with the Jeju Island Gate, where Georgic and the knights were.\nThe gates mimic an event or place, and hunters can do the quests there to retrieve items, magic stones, and more.\n“So there’s a difference between ‘real’ and ‘virtual’.”\n“There’s a difference between ‘virtual reward’ and ‘real reward’ with a clear purpose.”\nWhy can’t you just call it fake?\nItems, rewards, traits and gates.\nThe Gate’s resources are the foundation of human society.\n“It’s also what distinguishes ‘survivors’ from ‘NPCs’ on Earth.”\n“You’re referring to the magic stone, which replaces the heart.”\n“Yes. Also, given the examples of Sir Georgic and me, the Gate seems to be able to regress.”\nWe can speculate on its identity, but it also begs the question.\nIf the Gates, or “virtual spaces,” are demonic farms, why do they allow us to mine all sorts of items and magic stones?\n“One thing’s for sure. Nothing in this world is free.”\n“I agree.”\nIn fact, it was a question anyone could ask.\nWhy did the gates occur, and why do they all have a common resource: magic stones?\nHow could there be such a common object in so many worlds?\nThere were a few doubters, but they were not the mainstream.\n“This world has become accustomed to the bounty of the magic stones, and even if there are doubters, they will not give it up for economic reasons.”\nBlinded by immediate profit, the cost of changing the system is too great.\nEven the promised doom is ignored and passed on to the next generation. That’s how humans have always handled risk in any world.\n“Foolish things cannot be helped. That’s why we need monarchs and nobles with truly noble duties.”\nLeon is willing to take on that role. It is a duty he feels he cannot fulfill unless he is the bearer of the divine mandate and has proof of his kingship.\n“The conspiracy of evil has reached alarming proportions. We must act quickly to counter them, and I have heard that this gate is something we can utilize.”\n“Technically, I’m only talking about ‘virtual space’. A gate with survivors or a gate with demons requires a medium to specify the ‘coordinates’.”\n“So you want me to use this to input the coordinates of the gate?”\nAt that, Beatrice shook her head.\n“As it is an evil object, it will leap to a place associated with it, so why don’t you try something else first?”\n“Something else?”\n“How about using Your Majesty’s holy objects as coordinates?”\n“Sacred objects?”\nLeon had a holy sword, a holy spear, and a holy grail. There are many other things that could be called holy, but those are the three.\n“Well, it’s worth a shot. What should I carry?”\n“Fuel for the gate summoning… that is, a large amount of magic stones. We’ll need a lot… a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, of it.”\nIf the item is the navigation that takes the coordinates of the gate, then the magic stones are the fuel to reach the gate.\nIt takes a lot of them, and like all gates, it has a duration of between a week and ten days.\nThe question is, where do you get them?\n“It’s simple. There are still plenty of places to mine them in the world.”\nLeon quickly realized the intent of Beatrice’s words, and he immediately contacted Yappy and Ha-ri.\n“Issue an order and rally all available forces. We will attack the gates indiscriminately from now on.”",

      "content": "Chapter 85: Total Mobilization of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild\nIt has been four months since the appearance of the TTG Guild.\nEver since the Otherworldly Lionheart, Leon Dragonia Lionheart, set foot on Earth, they, or more precisely, Leon, have always brought issues.\nThe first issue was the complete cleansing of the Naju Plains, the appearance of blessed crops and the virtual cure of diseases.\nThe crops have been in plentiful supply since the blessing’s rapid growth, but next month, when the full harvest is due, they’re sure to bring a huge shock.\nConsidering the prime farmland in Asia and the fields that will be harvested by the Maverick Guild’s S-class Hunter Allen and Minutemen, the world will be divided between the Blessed Crops and the rest.\nThe second issue is the defeat of Yakt Spinner, the nightmare killing machine of Cheongju Gate.\nNot only did the S-ranked Hunter, Golden Chul, the semi-S-rank Huang Yeon-ha, and the Mage of the Tower along with Leon took down the elusive field boss in one fell swoop, but he also brought him into his guild as a survivor.\nAt one point, there was a consensus that the Yakt Spinner should not be accepted after slaughtering so many Hunters, but even that has been silenced in recent times.\nAs the first official Holy Knight of the TTG Guild, his overwhelming network dominance has not only erased all negative comments about TTG Guild, but has also led to retaliation.\nThe third issue is the training of the lowest-ranked Hunters, the D-rank Hunters, and survivor Beatrice Aligieri Spero.\nHe took hunters who weren’t even used as carriers at the average D-ranked gate and not only raised them by one rank in just one month, but he also cleared the fluctuation gate where an Archdemon appeared.\nNo matter how powerful Leon himself was, the performance of the D-rank Hunters in the video was far from D-rank.\nAlthough the organization was briefly criticized for its harsh human rights abuses and inhumane treatment, the miracle of rising in rank in just one month drew countless Hunters to enlist with hope.\nAnd a new survivor of that fluctuation gate, the Magician Queen of Spero.\nA Hunter of at least S rank and a rare mage at that.\nHer beauty was obscured by a veil, but a reporter conducting an interview caught a glimpse of her face and collapsed in a heap of bubbles.\nSince then, the Hunter Academy’s collective draft incident, the Firebird and Golden Lion Guild’s failed assault on the Jeju Island Gate, the appearance and defeat of the Demon Archduke, the relocation of the 10,000 kikiruks, etc……..\nThe TTG Guild has been at the center of every issue, and it was well documented on the official TTG Guild YouTube channel.\nAnd now it’s been four months since the TTG Guild appeared.\nWhen the famous TTG Guild was about to receive the fourth wave of recruits, they became the center of attention again.\n-Dude, this place is a joke.\n-What?\n-There’s a truckload of Hunters on the bus.\n-I think they’re from the TTG Guild. I saw Yappy.\n-…there were a bunch of kikiruks, too.\nIt was an army march.\nThe TTG Guild is larger than most guilds.\nUsually, a guild would select a limited number of guild members to form a raiding party.\nUsually 50 and even if you count 100 people for the second invasion team and a reserve, it’s about 130 people.\nThis is only true for small and medium-sized guilds and above, who can bid on gates and rotate them from time to time.\nGuilds in the provinces usually operate in small groups of 3-40 players with no reserves.\nHowever, the TTG Guild was basically a supply chain.\nThe first and second level Man-At-Arms and Knight Cadets alone numbered around 300. Add to that the third and fourth generation recruits, and you have a thousand. Out of the 10,000 survivors of the kikiruks, there were around 2000 warriors.\nEven taking into account the kikiruks, this is a superhuman army of 3,000.\nConsidering that they are promoted to C-class hunters after passing the four-week hell course of the TTG Guild, their power is unparalleled.\nEverybody else is doing it in small groups, but only the TTG Guild is organizing an army.\n-The gate opened in front of Gwangju Station, and the TTG Guild appeared! It’s Han Ha-ri. Isn’t he an employee of the Association?\n-She’s almost like a dual citizen these days… It’s weird. Yesterday, the TTG Guild entered the gate in front of my house? This is Gangneung, by the way.\n-Yeah, there’s a gate here in Wando, and the TTG Guild is there? It’s Yappy and the kikiruks. What are they armed with? They’re fucking murderous.\n-Wow! The queen is in Hwaseong! The wind scattered the veil on her face and everyone fainted. What is it?\n-The Lionheart King appeared in the sky! The orc gate was left unattended for four days, and they attacked!\n-You mean the New World Department Store in Sindong-dong, Dongnam-gu? Hey, there was one here in Buldang-dong yesterday.\n-Are they crazy? They’re just going to capture it in one day and move on to the next gate?\nTTG Guild had divided their 3,000-strong army into 20 attack squads to clear gates across the country.\nThe higher-ranked troops were led by Leon, Yappy, Beatrice, and Han Ha-ri, while the lower-ranked gates were quickly taken by cadets and Man-At-Arms.\nIn particular, the kikiruks were taking down gates at an alarming rate.\n“Let’s go, shoot that way!”\n-Bang! Boom! Boom!\nThe monsters inside the gate were swept away by the indiscriminate bombardment of the firearms-armed kikiruks.\nWhile modernized weapons are ineffective inside the gate, the sacred shells that Yappy made himself are a different story.\n“Ammunition is limited, so reload and prepare for an all-out war!”\nAt the low-ranked gates, rather than the high-ranked gates, Yappy warriors swept through the gates with great firepower + faithful armor.\nAs they swept through the gates, the domestic hunter guilds voiced their disapproval.\n-This is too much. There are more than 20 gates that the TTG Guild has taken in the past four days.\n-Never before have so many been awarded to a single guild. The Hunter Association’s favoritism is threatening the survival of small and medium-sized domestic guilds!\nThe average guild gets two gates per month. When you’re a top 10 guild, that number increases to three or four, but that’s for a month.\nThe TTG Guild closed over 20 gates in just four days, so it’s no wonder they’re being criticized.\nBut Oh Kang-hyuk, the Association president, was adamant.\n“The TTG Guild is the largest guild in Korea with over 3,000 dedicated hunters. Most of them are D-level hunters who are not hired by many guilds and work as day laborers, so the number of gates they can capture is small compared to their size.”\nOriginally, bidding on gates depended on performance and headcount. If you have a large number of Hunters, you can naturally run multiple raids.\nHowever, TTG is lacking in performance and number of hunters.\nThe Hunter Association organized and pushed for this, but it was a minor issue, and the citizens responded well.\n-Wow, that gate is finally gone. I thought no one would come because it was in the middle of the countryside, but then the Association’s raiding party came.\n-Guilds don’t bid if they think the traffic is bad.\n-They almost caused a dungeon break when they gave up on the orc gate in front of my house.\n-If they can’t do it, they should give up quickly, but I’ve seen too many assholes give up at the last minute just to maximize the amount of magic stones they can mine.\nGates are a resource. If you bid on it, you have to recover the amount of money you bid on it.\nIt’s been a long-standing problem that guilds mine until two or three days before the dungeon break, with the caveat that they shouldn’t lose money, and then leave it to the Association.\nWorse yet, how many gates are left untouched and unheard of after challenging the top gates, which is also a burden on the Hunter Association.\n“Wow, the Lionheart King is truly a national treasure.”\nOh Kang-hyuk, the head of the Association, is almost dying for the beauty of the TTG Guild, which clears the ignored gates at an incredible speed.\nThe Hunter’s Association has been losing talent to the top ten guilds, and thanks to the alliance of domestic guilds, they’ve been at their mercy.\nHowever, the TTG Guild doesn’t care about the Association’s interests, isn’t negligent, and works quickly.\nThey don’t give up just because it’s far away or in a difficult area. Whether it’s orcs or demons at the gate, they’ll kill them all.\n‘I’m glad I chose TTG Guild. Only they can stand up to the dominance of the 10 guilds!’\nOh Kang-hyuk was familiar with examples of developed countries being dominated by powerful mega-guilds.\nIn neighboring Japan, the rise of mega-guilds has led to the rise of guilds that are more powerful than the state, and in some torn countries, guilds have even replaced the government.\nSouth Korea was no better off.\nLed by the Blue Star Guild of Kangjin Province, which is said to have surpassed the Divine Sword Guild as the number one guild in the country and is now on par with the Berserker Guild, the Mujin, Shark, Chuwon Medicine, and Firebird Guilds are uniting to push for a tax exemption bill.\nA coalition of these five guilds could result in a second Japanese Kaminari alliance.\nThe last thing we need is for the powerful Hunter Guilds to gain power beyond that of the state.\n‘His Majesty, on the other hand, is different. He has no interest in political power.’\nFor a medieval knight-king, he was very different in that he treated President Ahn Dong-gil with respect and was willing to comply with his requests.\nOf course, when it comes to taxes, there is a bit of a vicious side. I understand that it’s a cultural difference, but the tax structure was too much.\nIf you dig deeper, it is a structure that is so distributive that it can be seen as the ideal of a welfare state, so it seems that there are no complaints among the members.\nNot even Oh Kang-hyuk himself would have any complaints.\nIsn’t it a utopia guaranteed by the gods if you pray well and follow the code?\n“I’d rather Korea follow the system of the Ten Thousand Gods than-\nNo, this is going too far. Implementing the system of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild in a country means tearing the country apart from the ground up.\nEven if the general public didn’t know about it, the higher-ups in South Korea would stop it no matter what.\n‘By the way, they also paid attention to the presidential election.’\nSometimes they imagine what kind of country it would be if the gods blessed it.\nStrangely enough, it doesn’t seem so bad.\n* * * * *\nOne week.\nThe results of all of Ten Thousand Gods’ troops indiscriminately raiding gates across the country to mine for magic stones were evidenced by the magic stones that filled the guild warehouse.\n“13 Unique grade equipment, 89 Rare, and 500 other equipment with a total of…….”\n-3.83 tons, sorted by grade. Approximately 38.3 billion won in Korean won. Estimated item auction price around 12.7 billion won.\n“You’re quick with the math, Lord Yappy!”\nA thousand human hunters and two thousand kikiruk warriors had been mining the spirit stones day and night.\nLeon looked at the ominous blood-colored stones and turned to Beatrice.\n“Is this enough?”\n“Yes, it’s enough.”\n“Very well then. Get ready.”\nLeon glanced at the assembled TTG Guild staff.\nThere weren’t many Hunters here now, aside from the ones who were carrying the magic stones.\nYappy, Han Ha-ri, and a few knight cadets.\n“This will be a small group effort, and all information related to this mission is forbidden to the outside world.”\n“”???””\nLeon’s words puzzled them, and they scratched their heads.\nLeon has no choice. He can open the gate intentionally and specify coordinates through a medium so this information could be used against them.\nThe Hunter’s Association will have to be informed sooner or later, but Leon intends to withhold the information until he’s sure.\n“Han Ha-ri, you will have to keep the Association in the dark as well. Can you do that?”\n“Uh, um…….”\nHa-ri looked confused. She was a goddess of two gods, but she was also a strictly state official.\nThe reason she was here in the first place was to report the events that happened at the TTG Guild.\n“Your Majesty… you’re not doing anything that would harm the country, are you?”\n“Of course not.”\n“Then I will believe in His Majesty!”\nHa-ri knew Leon’s eccentricity, but also his justice, and as long as that upright justice was not shaken, this negligence was acceptable.\nLeon had assembled his entire top tier force, including Beatrice, Yappy, and Han Ha-ri, and only a handful of knight cadets who could ride horses.\n“Ready, Your Majesty.”\nBeatrice was ready. She placed the holy sword at the center of the magic circle and designated the magic stones for sacrifice.\nUsing the information she had thoroughly gleaned from Hildir, the Beast God’s shaman, she activated the magic circle, and the stacks of magic stones in the warehouse began to shake.\n“……!!!”\nEveryone was stunned by the phenomenon before them. The magic circle swallowed up the spirit stones like they were being sucked in, forming a gate the size of a truck!\n“A gate?”\n“A gate…artificially created?”\nUntil now, the gate had been a random phenomenon, and now Beatrice had created it right in front of their eyes.\n“What is this…….?”\nLeon, Beatrice, and Yappy, the machine, are the only ones who don’t panic at the situation in front of them.\nThe knight cadets are left speechless by the shocking truth that is unfolding before their eyes.\n“Let’s go!”\nLeon leads the way, followed by Beatrice and Yappy. As the last of the cadets in the raiding party entered, the gate glowed as static as ever.\n* * * *\nAs they entered the gate, the peculiarly dim vision returned. Leon furrowed his brow at the tinnitus in his ears from the commotion.\n-Chang! -Chang!\n“Hmm…….”\nFamiliar sounds were heard, it was the cacophony of iron clashing against iron was a sound Leon had grown accustomed to throughout his life.\n“As expected…….”\nScanning his surroundings with his restored vision, Leon was not pleased to see that his prediction was correct.\nSoldiers in armor battling ‘green-skins’ and knights on horseback slaughtering a pack of bears and wolves.\nThis was a battlefield.\nThe soldiers of the Lionheart Kingdom were fighting very familiar and repulsive creatures.\n-Stop them! Don’t let them get through here!\n-Damned orcs! How dare they dig a trap!\n-We must buy Lord Jerea time!\n“Jerea?”\nA familiar voice called out from beside him.\n“Your Majesty, what is this place?”\nThe two knight cadets, Han Soo-ho and Jae-hyuk, were in the middle of the battlefield when a flying axe came flying towards Jae-hyuk.\n“Jae-hyuk!”\nAs the axe came to rest on Jae-hyuk’s nose, there was a flash of light.\nLeon’s holy sword and a shield from out of nowhere simultaneously parried the axe.\n“Uh, thank you…….”\n“Knights, why are you lingering there?”\nThe soldier, the one who had sent the shield flying, came running back with his shield back on like a magnet, and when he spotted Leon, he immediately fell to the ground.\n“Your majesty, how did you get here…!”\nThe soldier on one knee wore familiar armor and decorations.\nOrc skulls on each shoulder, a distinctive sawtooth blade and the dark blood makeup on the inside of his helmet recalled familiar soldiers.\n“Baltaric Orc Crushers.”\n“Yes, Your Majesty, I am Beverly, company commander of the Sovereign Baltaric Legion!”\n“Rise. Where is this place?”\n“What? Oh, no.”\nBeverly was taken aback for a moment by Leon’s unexpected appearance and questions, but then she began to speak dutifully.\n“We were attacked by orcs and barbarians on a convoy for Lord Jerea’s holy relics, and most of the convoy is currently fighting them off!”\nHe remembered.\nThis had happened in his reign.\nThis was the last mission of ‘Jerea the Twilight’, the Holy Knight of Dreams and Death, a holy convoy.\nIt was a disastrous mission that ultimately failed and the Holy Knight along with his knights were killed.",

      "content": "Chapter 86: The Holy Relic Convoy (1)\nIt was the 96th year of Leon’s reign.\n“Your Majesty, it is said that a holy relic has been found in a savage land that worships a beast god!”\nA holy relic is an object imbued with divine power that can only be used by a Holy Knight or a priest of the highest rank.\nSince the dawn of the Lionheart Kingdom, there have been countless holy objects, but not all of them have made it to the Lionheart Kingdom.\nThe Lionheart Kingdom has battled the evils of the world, winning some battles and losing others.\nThe holy relic found was lost 900 years ago, when the 12th Lionheart King died in a barbarian war in the north.\nIt was found by the Relic Seekers, a group that searches for lost relics.\nLeon immediately organized a convoy to take the relic from the barbarian lands but there was a major catch: to reach the barbarian lands, the convoy would have to cross the Empire’s borders.\nThe Empire also became an uncomfortable neighbor in Leon’s time, thanks to the Archdemon Summoning Incident.\nLeon, the youngest Holy Knight and War Knight at 35, defeated the Archdemon that killed the 14th Lionheart King, Argent Majesty Lionheart.\nIt took place on the fringes of the Empire, at the hands of warlocks backed by one of the Empire’s 13 Overlords, and although the Archdemon was defeated, a great grudge remained with the Empire.\nPartly because the Lionheart Kingdom had crossed the border as soon as the demon summons was detected, but also because they had burned the man responsible for the whole thing at the stake.\nThe Empire was outraged, and even the Emperor condemned them, but the Lionheart Kingdom ignored them.\n“There can be no leniency when it comes to demons! You should be ashamed of yourself for not being able to handle it yourself!”\nFrom then on, relations with the Empire remained difficult, with Imperial troops lining their borders to this day.\nAs a result, the Empire still held a grudge sixty years later, refusing to allow a large convoy of holy relics, and eventually they had to send a smaller convoy of 500 seekers, who eventually succeeded in their quest.\nTwo thousand orcs and seven barbarian tribes were burned to death in the process, but the search for the Relic seemed to be coming to a successful conclusion.\n‘But Lord Jerea did not return.’\nThe exact process was unknown since no one else in the holy relic’s convoy made it back alive.\nLeon had met Sir Jerea in Paradise, when the gods had taken refuge in the Lionheart during the final battle with the demons, but he too said nothing.\nHe would only say that he had been slain by a mighty orc, but he knew nothing of what happened after death.\nThe holy relic’s whereabouts were unknown until two years later, when the Emperor summoned the Demon Lord of Chaos to sacrifice three million Imperial citizens.\n‘If I’d known I’d be here, I could have gone to Paradise and gathered the testimonies of the soldiers who fought.’\nNo, what can I do about what had already happened?\nThere is only so long the living Leon can spend in the world of the dead.\nHe had been able to see Sir Jerea face once on his way, but he hadn’t been able to see each of his soldiers.\n‘Where are the others?’\nWhen Leon opened his eyes, there were only soldiers and knights around him. His companions were nowhere to be seen.\nThey must have split up when they entered.\n‘That means they can’t even cover the gate.’\nThat, too, could be adjusted with experience and data.\nLeon turned to the front, where there was still commotion.\n“Fight back!”\n“We can’t let the orcs get behind this!”\nThe Baltaric Legion.\nThe Baltaric Orc Crushers.\nThey are the masters of orc hunting, even making jewelry from the bones of orcs.\n“”whaaaaaaaaa──!!”\nGreen beasts, probably twice the size of the sturdy Orc Crushers, charged at them, wielding axes and clubs.\nBut the Orc Crushers parried the attacks with their shields and calmly stabbed the orcs to death.\nThere were only a few hundred Orc Crushers, but one of them could handle four orcs.\nAnd there was another force protecting them.\n-Siaaaaah…!\nBlack smoke emanated from the center of the Orc Crushers. The orcs that breathed it in fell with a thud.\n“Lord Jerea’s Reverie Zone has formed, retreat back!”\n“Retreat twenty paces and regroup!”\nThe Orc Crushers retreat in unison from the black smoke, and in front of them is the Knight of the Three Swords, skewering Orc heads with his handsome beard.\n“Hmph… The orcs have momentum.”\n“Ser Jerea!”\n“Captain Beverick.”\nCaptain Beverick faked a bow and dropped to one knee.\n“His Majesty Lionheart, King Leon Dragonia Lionheart, is here!”\n“What? That can’t be right, why would he…….”\nJerea was stunned to see the familiar blond Lionheart behind Beverick’s back then willingly knelt down and bowed to him.\n“I greet the first Knight of Arianna!”\nLeon looked down at the aging Holy Knight who bowed before him.\nThe moment a Holy Knight drinks the holy water of the Grail and awakens, he is reconstituted into the body of his prime.\nWhile Leon’s case was unusual in that he became a Holy Knight at such a young age, the Holy Knight in front of him was unusual in the opposite sense.\nJerea, the Elder Holy Knight, the oldest Acolyte and the oldest Holy Knight.\nHis body was not reconstituted the moment he drank the holy water. In other words, this old, decrepit body was his prime.\n“Still the same…you.”\n“……?”\nThe knight with the handsome mustache and refined style was dumbfounded, but he did not raise his head, maintaining courtesy.\n“Rise.”\nThe descending voice made Jerea awkwardly rise to his feet. He looked up to see before him and it was unmistakably, King Lionheart.\nThe youngest War Knight, the youngest to become a Holy Knight, the legendary one who had broken through an army of demons to defeat an Archdemon.\nHow could he be here when he was supposed to be in the royal castle? Despite his many questions, Jerea did not doubt the divinity before him.\n“I will explain later. Ser Jerea, explain the situation.”\nLeon wanted to first compare what he knew with the situation of the holy convoy.\n“Yes, Your Majesty, we were on our way to the Imperial border to retrieve the holy relics as scheduled!”\nAfter retrieving the holy relics from the barbarian lands, the convoy headed straight for the Imperial border. The Empire and the Kingdom were longtime allies, albeit frosty ones.\nIt takes less than three days on horseback to cross their border into the Kingdom.\nOnce they reached the Imperial border, the mission to escort the holy relics would be over but then something happened.\n“Orcs attacked with the Beast God’s cultists. Orcs from the northeast, presumably.”\nOrcs often cross the country in wars, so it’s not surprising that they’d come this far. What is strange is their behavior.\n“Orcs are not known to be sociable, but they have joined hands with humans. That’s unusual.”\nLeon doesn’t distinguish between orcs and cultists, but they do ostracize and categorize each other in their own way.\n“At first, the orcs would beat up anything that wasn’t one of their colonized races, the goblins or trolls.\nBut cultists and orcs holding hands?\nIt was unusual and alarming, but…….\n‘It was commonplace in the Last War.’\nLeon remembered the fall of the empire and the alignment of the beasts that had begun in the ninety-eighth year of his reign.\nOrcs enjoyed warring with demons and cultists, but sometimes they cooperated. It was a wonder their stupid animal brains knew the word cooperation, but──\n‘What happens, happens.’\nLeon figured it had happened long before ’98. Only two years later, the Emperor of the Empire would summon the Lord of Chaos.\n“So, Lord Jerea, what did you do with the holy object?”\n“Yes, we left only infantry and a handful of knights to hold the orcs at bay here, and we tore the holy relic into five pieces and escorted it away. We had to tear it as much as we could, since the Black Eagle God’s cronies were tracking us by air.”\nIt was a reasonable conclusion.\n“Then… where is the convoy containing the ‘real holy relic’?”\nJerea said without hesitation.\n“Convoy five, southwest. It’s being led by my ‘past’.”\n* * * *\n“Mmmm…….”\nBeatrice drooled, her normally laid-back and bewitching voice sounding out of place.\nShe opened her eyes upon entering the gate, only to find a desolate canyon in front of her, with her companions nowhere to be seen.\n“I must have… miscalculated.”\nGate magic is a type of magic she’s never used before.\nShe was able to identify the coordinates and open the gate, but the arrival coordinates were scattered.\n‘A miscalculation? That’s a bit bizarre.’\nEven though it was her first time casting this spell, would she who was called the Magician Queen of the Spero Kingdom make such a mistake?\nBefore that, Beatrice was at a loss as to what to do in this wide canyon. It’s a place she’s never seen before, and she’s never seen anything that has anything to do with Leon.\nJust as she was about to mount the horse she had brought with her, a commotion reached her ears.\n-Kiie-e-e!\n-Keep running, we can’t let them catch up!\nIt was the beasts pursuing the cavalry.\nA few knights, presumably knights, and a few soldiers, armed with light armor rather than heavy armor that appeared to be commoner cavalry.\nTheir identities were unknown, but their pursuers were known.\n“Servants of the Beast Gods.”\nThe cavalry may be allies, but they are certainly enemies. Beatrice stretched out her beautiful fingers and worked her magic.\n-Quang! Quack!\nA beam of light cut through the sky, and the thunder crackled.\nBoars were struck by lightning and roasted, and black eagles were pierced by beams.\nThe magician queen unleashed an endless stream of magic, each one a deadly blast of violence that swept through the beasts.\nShe must have looked like the absolute queen of death to the beasts and it was the same for the cavalry.\n“Who, who are you!”\n“An Imperial mage!”\nThe knights stepped forward and stood before the queen, wary of her face covered by the veil, but not hiding their favor for being saved.\n“How will you prove your identity?”\nBeatrice raised her powers to prove her identity, and to make herself easily recognizable to the knights.\nThe power of Fle, the goddess of dreams and death, was a dark purple color.\n“You’re the same… as Sir Jerea…! You’re the goddess of Fle?!”\n“No, a holy power as clear as her is only possible for a priestess of the highest rank…….”\nBeatrice smirked as the knights looked on in confusion.\n“More importantly, knights, can you explain the situation we’re in for a moment?”\nIt was crucial to gather information first.\n* * * *\n“Ugh….”\nMy bones ache.\nKoo Dae-sung realized that he had been hit with something blunt.\nHe never thought he’d get hit as soon as he entered the gate. Was everyone else okay?\n“Hey, hey, hey!”\nA voice patted his cheek. When Koo Dae-sung opened his eyes, there was an old man with an impressive mustache in front of him.\n“Hehe, this fellow has opened his eyes. If you’re in such a hurry, why do you throw yourself in front of it?”\n“Ugh…….”\nKoo Dae-sung was stunned to see a large bear carcass in front of him, its fur as stiff as steel.\n“Whoa…!”\nHe stumbled backwards and looked around. The area around him was littered with corpses that had been attacked by beasts in the middle of the night, and in the distance, a familiar girl was pulling a horse with a horseman.\n“Ah, old Hunter…you’re awake, aren’t you?”\nThe red-haired girl clapped her hands in concern and checked Koo Dae-sung’s condition.\n“Deputy Han…what about him?”\nThe trooper leading the horse felt the gaze and replied.\n“Ah, I’m sorry I’m late in introducing myself, I’m Vion of the scout cavalry. Knight, please keep your voice down.”\nWhy would he call him a knight? That question was answered by the older man, who called himself Sir Jerea.\n“And how did the knight of the earth and abundance come to this land, anyway? I thought I was the only one who did such crazy things.”\nKnight? Apparently, they mistook him for a knight.\nKoo Dae-Sung opened his mouth to correct the error, but a system message flashed before his eyes.\n[Assist Lord Jerea of Twilight in escorting the holy relic to the Lionheart border]\n“Convoy…the holy relic?”\n“That’s right. We are currently retrieving the holy relics from the Savage Lands and escorting them.”\n“Is that so?”\n“I’m a little late in hearing from you, but that’s to be expected from a knight who sought honor even in this land.”\n“I beg your pardon, Twilight… Lord Jerea?”\nJerea chuckled and shook his head at being addressed as the system prompted him.\n“That is an honor earned by the future me. For now, I am simply a Quest Knight on a quest.”\n“What?”\nKoo Dae-sung tilted his head.",

      "content": "Chapter 87: The Holy Relic Convoy (2)\n‘Jerea the Twilight’.\nBefore he could become a Holy Knight of Fle, the goddess of dreams and death, he had to undergo a long period of training.\nThere are two paths for those who have proven themselves as wandering knights and become knights of the realm.\nThey can either continue to serve in the Kingdom’s army and fight honorably as a War Knight, or they can embark on an unpredictable journey to become a Quest Knight.\nOf course, not everyone who becomes a Quest Knight will be able to become a Holy Knight.\nOnly those chosen at the end of the journey would receive a ‘quest’ from the gods, and even then, few would succeed.\nThis is why Holy Knights could remain in their positions for hundreds of years without finding a successor.\nUsually, you would receive a quest within twenty years, and complete it within five.\nIf they didn’t receive a quest, they would realize their inadequacies and return to being a Kingdom Knight.\nBut not Jerea Bertum. He had not received a quest from any god for nearly fifty years.\nHe had traveled to the waves, hunted monsters, and fought in the orc crusades of the War Knights, cutting off thousands of orcs.\nHe willingly slaughtered bandits for the sake of the barbarian-plundered people of Changeling, and prayed to the heavens from his thundering mountain top shrine.\nHis attendants shifted from reverence to mockery, from derision to pity.\n“Man, you could have done better,” they said, “you’re not good enough, and the gods don’t answer you.”\nThis was when he was working as a mercenary for the Empire to pay for his training.\nAt the same time, he became a Realm Knight and commanded a thousand knights as a proud War Knight of the Lionheart.\nAt the age of fifteen, he wandered the world, spending ten years as a Knight Errant, another ten years fulfilling his duties as a Kingdom Knight, and fifty years on the path.\nIn all that time, he never received a quest from the gods.\nOnly the superhumans of human history were worthy of the quest.\nHe was a great knight, but he was not a superhuman who could single-handedly change the course of a battle.\nHe was reckless, uneducated, and ignorant.\nA woman appeared in Jerea’s dreams and said,\n[Why do you wander endlessly on the road of hardship? The Pantheon knows your heart. Return and serve the kingdom.]\nJerea realized that the woman in his dream was a divine being, but he politely rejected her.\n“Lady. Blame me for my shortcomings, but do not deny me my quest for honor.”\nJerea left to train once more.\nHe walked through mud where no noble knight would go, and his hands were always stained with blood, even as bards sang of his dishonor.\nHe did not become a Holy Knight until he was a hundred years old and was the oldest one to reach that level.\n* * * *\nThe canyon that marks the boundary between the Empire and the northern barbarians is called the Valley of Death and is a region to be feared.\nNarrow entrances, paths that diverge as they descend into the interior, and native monsters abound. At its end, it is said to be the border of the Empire, but the dangers of traveling there are too great.\nNevertheless, there was one reason Jerea chose this place to retreat: the narrow entrance.\nAttacked by orcs and barbarians, Jerea organized a dummy convoy of swift cavalry to buy time and block the gorge to prevent a full-scale pursuit.\nMost of the army was trapped at this narrow entrance.\n“Shield wall forward, axemen, stand by!”\nThe orc shredders move like machines at the bellowed command of Company Commander Beverly.\nArmed with shields and swords, each one flaunts an orc skull ornament and sends savage glares.\n-WHAAAAAAAA────!!!\nThe green beasts charge, flaunting their massive weight, but the shield wall withstands their clash.\n“Axemen, strike!”\nThe axemen, hidden among the shieldmen, skillfully slashed the orcs’ wrists and decapitated them using efficient mechanical movements.\nWhistles sounded as the soldiers executed the orcs, two at a time.\n-Beep! Beep!\nBeverly’s whistle opened a gap in the shield wall as the orcs’ corpses fell and the front row retreated to a clear space between the shield walls.\nThe second row transformed into the first, and the whistle sounded again.\n-Bam!\nAnd the battle was repeated. Row 1 blocked, Row 2 stabbed. Again, row 1 switches to the back row, and row 2 takes over for row 1.\nIt may seem simple, but is it possible to move with precision on a crowded battlefield?\nThe Orc Crushers, who lacked strength and size, were skillfully slaughtering the orcs as if they were backyard dogs.\n‘They’re strong… It’s not about strength, it’s about combat power as a group!\nHan Soo-ho, who was on standby, couldn’t help but admire the performance of the Baltaric Orc Crusher Legion.\nUp until now, he had only been impressed by the soldiers of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild, who were only D-rank.\nThey fought quite well for D-ranks and could be the backbone of any small or medium-sized guild’s raiding party.\nStill, when he realized that they didn’t meet Leon’s expectations, he was a little surprised.\n-Weren’t they just conscripts from the medieval kingdom? How well could they fight……?.\nBut the soldiers of the Lionheart Kingdom are all career soldiers. They’ve been fed blessed crops since birth, and their combat experience is overwhelming compared to modern hunters.\nThey are masters of group warfare, with entire armies operating as a single machine.\nTheir bravery and collective combat power is second to none.\n“Trolls! Trolls are coming!”\nThe soldiers twist their pikes in response to their leader’s shout.\nBut trolls weigh nearly three times as much as orcs. Even the Baltaric Legion, with its defense, cannot avoid a collapse in formation.\n“Knights!”\nLeon’s voice rings out. As Leon’s voice rang out from behind the Baltaric Legion, knights and commoner cavalry from both sides raised their spears.\nAmong them, Han Soo-ho and Kim Jae-hyuk were excluded due to their ‘lack of horsemanship’.\n“Where the hell are they going to charge?”\nSoo-ho and Jae-hyuk asked.\nThe Baltaric Legion had blocked the narrow entrance.\nSuch a formation would be absolutely advantageous for defense, but it would not allow for fluid troop movements. There was nowhere for the cavalry to run.\n“Charge!”\nNevertheless, Leon boldly ordered the cavalry to charge, and without any hesitation, they began to run──\n“Ah, aren’t you going to hit the rear of our allies?!”\n“It’s dangerous!”\nAs the two cadets watched in horror, 20 cavalry on the left and 20 on the right, a total of forty cavalry were dizzily charging towards the rear of the Baltaric Legion.\nIn the dizzying moment before they struck the rear of their allies, the two cadets realized what they were lacking: horsemanship.\n-Bam!\nSir Jerea, at the head of the line, spun on his reins and galloped up the steep wall of the canyon, right next to the Baltaric Legion.\nIt was a reckless move that would have crushed them if they had hit the wall at such a gallop. But the steeds of Lionheart are no ordinary steeds.\n-Heh!\nThe black steed spurs the ground and pushes against the wall. It soon begins to “gallop” up the wall.\nIt’s a miraculous moment, seemingly defying gravity. But it wasn’t. The horse is simply running before it crashes down the wall it has climbed.\nAnd this feat was accomplished by all the horses that followed.\n“Yay…!”\n“Run!”\nThe steeds raced down the canyon wall, willing to trust their decades-long comrades. The horses running on both wings of the Baltaric Legion passed them in an instant, and──\n“Take them down!”\nJerea shouted, and his steed responded by slamming into the wall. The acceleration from the gallop and the momentum from slamming into the wall combined to send the horses crashing down on the trolls in midair.\nIt was a sight to behold. A dozen or so trolls were pierced from head to toe by the lances.\n“Mee, madmen! Hit them!”\n“Damn it!”\nThe orcs with axes clenched in fear bravely charged toward the leading Kingdom Knight, only to be met with fire from the Knight’s lance.\n“To ashes in the holy flame!”\nLike a laser blast, the spiraling flames shot in a straight line.\nOrcs touched by the spiraling flames were reduced to ashes without delay, and the flames spread in all directions.\n“Arghhh…!”\n“Boo, fire!”\nWhile the orcs panicked at the flames, the knights finished off the trolls, leaving their corpses in the way, and climbed the wall again, returning to the backs of the infantry.\n“Holy shit…….”\nThe infantry’s combat prowess is awe-inspiring enough, but the knights are something else entirely.\nFor some reason, the Lionheart Kingdom’s military was at least one level higher than the Hunters of modern Earth.\nNo wonder Leon was so unimpressed with the knight cadets and trainees.\nThese were the elite War Knights, the ones who traveled in legions. How lowly they must have seemed to him.\n“At this rate, we’ll be stuck here forever.”\nLooking at the mountain of monster corpses in front of him, anyone would think so.\n“Don’t let your guard down. They haven’t even started yet.”\nAs Leon approached, Jae-hyuk realized why Leon wasn’t taking the initiative: he was hiding his power.\nThe Lionheart King is a superpower in itself. Unless there was a real crisis, he would wait for the right time.\n“Still, even if there is a ‘quest’, isn’t it necessary for His Majesty to be here? Holy Knight Sir Jerea is also incredibly strong.”\n“…….”\nLeon didn’t reply, but recalled the ‘system message’ that Jae-hyuk, the Awakener, had reported.\n[Assist Sir Jerea of the Twilight to escort the Holy Grail to the border of Lionheart]\n-Side mission: Defend Lord Jerea’s main body to the end.\nThis gate suggests two purposes.\nFirst, to escort the true convoy with the holy relics to the border.\nThe second is to support Jerea and Baltaric in blocking the canyon for the convoy and hold it to the end.\nFrom a purely efficiency standpoint, it would make sense to abandon Jerea and go after the Relic convoy.\nLeon would be able to take to the skies in his Stallion and chase them down but he chose to stay behind.\nHis reasons were simple.\nFirst, he trusted that the Relic convoy would make it and second, he wanted to see the honorable Holy Knight through to the end.\n“Han Soo-ho, Kim Jae-hyuk, have you checked what this king told you to check?”\n“Yes, I checked the corpses of the orcs, but there was no magic stone anywhere!”\nThe situation is clear: there are no magic stones but no survivors either.\nThe knights and soldiers here are all reaping the rewards of an honorable life in Paradise.\n‘Gate quests are also unbiased.’\nIn the past, some Gate quests have hidden their intentions, most notably the quest to defeat Holy Knight Georgic and the Statue of Rakshar.\nBut this gate doesn’t feel like a gimmick. It’s purely a way to take advantage of this historical event.\nAre Gates Neutral? Are the quests that appear at the gate neutral?\nIf so, why were the previous gates so malicious?\n‘The gates themselves are neutral but the quests…could the system be manipulated by demons?’\nOn the first try, he was able to deduce quite a bit and after a few more tries he’d have a decent conclusion.\n“Han Soo-ho, Kim Jae-hyuk, you two will check the canyon at the back for any other cadets and──”\nIt was then that something flashed and came hurtling toward Leon.\n-Boom!\nLeon swung his sword to deflect it but the tremor of its weight was felt through his fingertips.\n“…….”\nA spear was thrown at Leon from the sky and Leon’s gaze shot up into the air.\n“Clink…!”\nA boar-like beast, twisted tusks spread its hideously massive wings and carried an orc on its back.\nThe Bonecrusher, a flying beast that only orcs of Great Chieftain rank could ride.\nAtop the flying beast, a hybrid born of a terrible orc spell, was a messily tattooed orc holding a spear.\nNo doubt he was the one who shot the spear at Leon.\n“A filthy green beast…using a ranged weapon?”\nThat made the Lionheart King very uncomfortable.",

      "content": "Chapter 88: The Holy Relic Convoy (3)\nThe sight of the orc looking down at him from his perch aboard the Bonecrusher bothered Leon deeply.\n“A beast that should be destroyed like a worm that waits on the earth… how dare you look down on this king.”\nThe king’s wrath is not unleashed by the king’s hand. First, Leon finds a knight to claim the glory.\n“Holy Knight Jerea, bring me the head of that foul beast!”\n“I will gladly offer him to your majesty.”\nThe frail-looking knight bent down as if to offer his assistance. And at that very moment, a transcendent momentum propels his body into the air, carrying him to the top of the canyon.\nKim Jae-hyuk and Han Soo-ho were stunned, and the soldiers cheered.\nThe oldest Holy Knight but the most defiant saint.\n“Jerea…!”\n“Jerea…!”\n“Jerea of the Twilight!”\n“The one who challenged the thunderclap!”\n“The knight of glory who has risen from the lowliest of places!”\nTo the cheers of the soldiers, the Holy Knight leaps to his feet.\nAs the Holy Knights soared with great majesty, it was easy to see why they were the favored saints of the gods and the strongest super weapons of mankind.\n* * * *\nThe orc shaman Krakan loaded his spear with spells for the next attack.\nThe shamans of Gokrok are known for their uncharacteristically cunning and destructive spells that overwhelm their opponents.\nKrakan planned to deal with the humans from the safety of the air, out of their reach. That is, until something erupted from the ground…….\n-Bang!\nBy the time he realized it was a human, it was too late.\n“Ugh…!”\nAn orc was an orc was an orc, even if it was a shaman so Krakan instinctively pulled on the reins, and the flying beast’s body twisted.\n-Whoosh!\nIn a flash of grisly foreboding, Krakan saw the form of a man who had just passed through the spot where he had been at super speed.\n“How dare a beast that should crawl on the earth intrude on the sky where kings play?”\nThe elderly knight stretches out his hand at the Bonecrusher even as his attack misses.\n-Grrrr…!\nThe Bonecrusher’s eyelids, which had just been fiercely purring, closed heavily. Naturally, it stopped flapping its wings and crashed.\n“You, you…!”\nEven as it was falling towards the orcs at the mouth of the canyon, Jerea was willing to give chase for the head he had promised the king.\n-Quang!\nThe Bonecrusher’s head exploded as it fell from the sky, killing him in his sleep while Jerea rolled on the ground and chased after the crawling Krakan, who grunted.\n“Mmph…!”\nKrakan struggled to his feet, running away from the cold gaze behind him.\n“Do it! Kill him!”\nKrakan whirled around and pointed at Jerea.\nAn army of tens of thousands of orcs and barbarians had gathered to attack the convoy and each of their ravenous gazes was a force Krakan could use.\n“You will regret coming here alone! I have an army!”\nDespite being a wounded ragtag bundle, Krakan was confident, and true to his word, thousands of orcs stepped forward and the barbarians were turned into beasts.\nAn army too many for one man but here orcs and beasts fill the land while black eagles roam the sky.\nJerea frowns at the prospect of such a massive force.\n“To mobilize such a large number of beasts is certainly unusual.”\nOrcs and barbarians are common enemies in Lionheart, but that doesn’t mean they get along.\nTo begin with, orcs are ignorant brutes who are only good for fighting and usually they attack barbarians but now they cooperate?\nSomething was definitely wrong.\n“Kkkkk… Even you can’t take on this many alone──?!!”\nKrakan suddenly realized that it was too dark in front of him.\nEven though it was still broad daylight, the sky was pitch black and he thought the sun was being blocked by a large number of black eagles…….\n‘It’s not like that! This is different…!’\nThe hairs on his body stand on end. He can feel it in his bones that he’s going to die if he touches it.\n“There are many, many.”\nJerea’s low voice is eerie as black vultures fall down, unable to escape the purple haze that covers the sky.\n-Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee…!\nThe vultures plummet with their final screams, unforgiven for their presence in the heavenly realm, the great sinners paid the price with death.\nA purplish mist spreads in all directions as if swept by the wind.\nThe beasts that realized death at the mere touch of it fled, but not faster than the wind.\n“Death to the unbeliever, an unbreakable nightmare──”\nAt the merciless slaughter that wasn’t even a battle Krakan shouted urgently.\n“Go, golems! Use the golems!”\nAs a shaman he recognized the fog as the life-sapping mist of death and the rock golems the shamans had constructed in a matter of hours moved through it with dull tread.\nKrakan smiled triumphantly, but it was quickly replaced by unease. Why? Why did the old man look so unconcerned at the sight of an army of golems?\n“Do you know why the Holy Knights are called the strongest creatures in the world?”\nHe leaped at the slow approaching golem and slams his sword down on the massive mass of rock.\n“It is because we alone surpass a Legion.”\nThe several golems weighing tons were sliced off like tofu.\n* * * *\nChirp, chirp, chirp… A muffled bird song echoing through the canyon at night but a gently squeezing grip grabs Koo Dae-sung, who raises his head absentmindedly.\n“Be careful. Most of the nocturnal beasts here are demons.”\n“I apologize.”\nJerea gave Koo Dae-sung a benevolent smile.\n“You might not know. You’re still young.”\nThey were hiding in the bushes, and not only that, but their horses were lying down and holding their breath. Dae-sung and Ha-ri’s horses had been forced to sleep.\n“Thank goodness there’s a bush nearby.”\nAs they hid in the waist-high bushes, an orc riding a boar wandered by.\nThe orc was only a few steps away, and their camouflage was blown but just then, Jerea’s purple mist enveloped the orc.\n“Eh, eh, eh…! Uh, this is…….”\nThe orc and boar, who had been searching with bleary eyes, shuffled about with unfocused eyes, as if they were drunk.\n“No…….”\nThe orc turned the boar’s head and looked the other way, causing Ha-ri, who had been holding her breath, to exhale with a sigh.\n“Da, thank goodness.”\nFor the umpteenth time, everyone stared at Zerea in relief.\nAfter removing his armor and tying it to his horse to reduce the creaking, Jerea led the group in a relaxed voice.\n“There’s a cave nearby. Let’s go there and hide.”\nThe others were able to muffle the sound with muzzles, but their horses hadn’t been trained to do so, so they slept with Jerea’s method.\nHe picks up one of the horses and slings it over his shoulder.\n“Sir Jerea. We can do this. How can your body…….”\nThe knight looks embarrassed as Jerea takes the lead, and they’re uncomfortable with the idea of him, a Holy Knight, doing the chore.\n“It’s fine, Lord Stella. I’m not a Holy Knight now.”\nIn wartime, a paladin takes orders from a War Knight or Kingdom Knight, so in that sense, Stella is the one in charge.\nEventually, Jerea carried the horse until they reached the cave.\n“I’ll block the cave from now on. Stand back.”\nSetting the horse down inside the cave, he knelt down on one knee and prayed to Demera, the goddess of earth and fertility.\n-Goooooow…!\nThe knight’s prayer was answered, and the cave was covered with indigenous plants, so the entrance to the cave would not be discovered or look awkward.\n“This is amazing…….”\nHa-ri and Dae-sung shared the same sentiment as they watched.\nIf it weren’t for him, the pursuers would have been caught on ago.\n“Just an old man’s catch.”\nJerea smiled his good-natured smile and headed for the interior of the cave, casually tethering the horses and setting up camp.\n“Lord Jerea. May I ask you to guard the holy relic?”\nThe red-haired Kingdom Knight Stella, who had questioned Jerea earlier, handed over the box of holy items she was carrying.\nJerea shook his head as he examined the lanky box, which must have been at least a foot and a half long.\n“Lord Stella, you know that in wartime, a knight of the realm has more command than a wandering attendant. Don’t try to impose your will on me.”\n“But, my lord. You are a Holy Knight, chosen by the God of Dreams and Death.”\n“You may as well ascribe my future exploits to me. What you have before you is a challenger not the fulfiller of a quest.”\n“Okay…….”\nDae-Sung said cautiously to the confused Stella. It hadn’t made sense in broad daylight.\n“Forgive me for interrupting, but what do you mean by future Sir Jerea… and past Sir Jerea?”\n“Ah… I suppose it might be unfamiliar to knights who are just starting out on their wanderings. Lord Han Ha-ri… did you say Lord Koo Dae-sung?”\nStella and Jerea tilted their heads at the unusual names of the two people, but only for a moment.\nFor, regardless of their origins, their Divinity was proof that they were brothers.\n“It’s just a favor from the Goddess.”\nJerea of Twilight, Holy Knight of Dreams and Death.\nHis endless challenges were famous throughout the kingdom and even the continent.\nA foolish man, Jerea never stopped challenging the bards who sang of his dishonor.\nWhen he finally drank the holy water of the Grail and became a Holy Knight, Fle gave him special powers in honor of his great journey.\n[Unique Law]\nA Unique Law that symbolizes the life of the Holy Knight, who began his wanderings at the age of 15 and pursued his dream of becoming a Holy Knight.\nIt’s a unique talent that combines the power of dreams and death, and its ability is simple.\n“Fle recreates the past in dreams and summons an alter ego in reality. I am now eighty-five years old. I’ve only just received my quest.”\n“That’s the law of…….”\n“Doesn’t that… disperse the power?”\nAt Ha-ri’s question, Jerea smiled and denied it.\n“This body is merely a recreation of the past. It reproduces power, but it doesn’t disperse it.”\n“Wow. Doesn’t that make you invincible?”\n“I may be strong, but I can’t compare to the power of a Holy Knight. Don’t get your hopes up.”\nApparently, summoning your past self doesn’t double your power.\n-Kugung!\nA frenzied tremor shook the entire canyon and everyone was barely holding on to their center of gravity.\n“What the…! Dodge!”\nJerea hastily grabbed Ha-ri and Dae-sung and threw them into the cave. At that moment, something huge rained down from the ceiling.\n-Kwak!\nSomething collided with Jerea’s sword.\nAttacks were exchanged again and again amidst the dust and by the sound of it, Koo Dae-sung realized this was an attack, not an accident.\n“Lord Jerea, I’m here to help──cough!”\nIn the thick dust, Stella also collided with something.\n“Mu, what…!”\nKoo Dae-Sung was about to step forward when Ha-ri drew her sword, and her flames surged and turned into a vortex, rushing toward the cave entrance.\nFlames to burn the dead and waves to wash away the dirt, both forces followed her wishes and swept everything inside the cave without harming her allies in the slightest.\n-Boom!\nThe raiders were swept up in a vortex of fire and slammed against the wall. The dust swallowed up by the vortex pours out of the cave, and all that’s left of the cave are the shapes of her allies and the raiders.\n“What the hell?”\nJerea threw the raider by the scruff of the neck and decapitated him, and a rolling head fell to the ground.\nHa-ri and Dae-Sung gulped at the sight.\n“Monster?”\nAt over two meters tall and the size of three or four bears combined, it was no man. In fact, it was hardly a living thing at all.\nMelting skin, tentacles protruding from gouged-out eyeballs, a foul smell of rotting flesh and grotesquely shaped joints.\nThey were grotesque monstrosities that seemed to desecrate and abhor life itself.\n-Keeeeeeeeeeeee──\nSomething like a muffled wail echoed deep into the cave.",

      "content": "Chapter 89: The Holy Relic Convoy (4)\nThere were five raiders. One of them was decapitated by Jerea, and two were struck by the holy law vortex unleashed by Ha-ri.\nA blazing holy flame, would surely burn my enemies even when it touches them, it sticks to them like white phosphorus and won’t stop until it burns them all──\nThe burning monsters, drenched and shivering, continued to stare at the convoy.\n“How can you be on fire and still…….”\nAs if they didn’t feel the pain.\n“Stay alert. Bring up your shields, keep an eye on his attacks, especially those tentacles, they’re poisonous.”\nHa-ri was about to ask how he knew, but then she looked at the nape of Jerea’s neck and frowned.\nA black bruise spread across the nape of his neck, centered on a small cut.\n“Lord Jerea…!”\n“Focus on the enemy. That is your priority for now.”\nLike the most veteran knight in the land, Jerea unsheathed his sword without hesitation. And so the battle between the four monsters and the holy object convoy resumes.\n-Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!\n-Geeaaaaaah!\nThe monsters’ voices were different, but their behavior was the same, as if they were the same species.\nIt swung its huge claws wildly like a bear, looking for an opportunity to release its poisonous stinger with its tentacles. It seemed to feel no pain, shrugging off the slightest snatch and pushing in.\n‘Strong…! It’s almost at the level of a Class A monster!’\nWith a tricky strategy and pure physical prowess that would make it a mid-boss in the Orange Gate, it’s not easy to deal with, especially since it ignores pain.\nBut Ha-ri is a goddess. She’s a chosen holy law user, and these monsters are no match for her in terms of power.\n-Kaaaaaah…!\nThe flames were large enough to incinerate them if they weren’t driven back by their touch.\nHa-ri’s flames consumed the stinging tentacles, burning the creature whole.\n-Guy Yi Yi…….\nThe creature’s vocal cords burned away in an instant, its voice dying. Meanwhile, Jerea and the knights dutifully slayed the other creatures.\n“Riders, hold onto your shields. I have two seconds.”\n“On my mark!”\nThe commoner riders held off the monsters’ charge with their shields. Though they were lightly armed and commoners, they were skilled enough in the art of the shield to rely on each other for the strength and weight they lacked.\n-Ew!\nThe monsters screamed as their charge was blocked. But in a group battle, it’s not the strength of the individual that matters, but the coordination.\n“Just watch out for the tentacles.”\nJerea and the knights dodged a flurry of tentacles and stabbed the creatures in the head, the vital center of all life.\nIf they couldn’t penetrate the skull with a single blow, they stepped back and let the next knight’s sword take over, stabbing again and again until the creatures shriveled.\nWhen only one last one remained.\n-Burn, burn, burn…!\nThe creature that had been stopped by the shield wall saw something and broke into a mad dash. At the end of his death-defying sprint was a ‘holy chest’ that had been left behind in the chaos of battle.\n“Uh, uh, uh?!”\nKoo Dae-sung, who happened to be the closest, unwittingly stepped in front of him.\n“Hunter Koo Dae-sung!”\nHa-ri shouted, but the monster was already right up to Koo Dae-sung’s nose. Koo Dae-sung reflexively stabbed his sword into the tentacle-wielding monster.\n-Kwak!\nWas he lucky? Koo Dae-sung’s sword, combined with the monster’s acceleration, pierced his skull, and he died.\n“I’m down…!”\nBut as it collapsed, the monster continued to attack him.\nIt had the speed to run, so the impact force of a near-collision was transmitted directly.\n“Ouch! My arm…!”\nHe tries to pull his arm out of the pain, wondering if it’s in the wrong place, but for some reason it won’t listen.\n“Pull it out!”\nThe knights and their riders rescue Koo Dae-sung from the monster. Ha-ri pushes the monster’s corpse as hard as she can with her tiny hand, and Koo Dae-sung barely manages to free himself from its weight.\n“Hunter Koo Dae-sung, you’re hurt… Ouch.”\nHa-ri, who had been tending to him, paled as she examined Koo Dae-Sung’s broken arm.\nThrough the torn fabric of his tentacles, she could see… black spots.\n“Poisoned.”\nKoo Dae-sung was not alone. Jerea, who had saved Ha-ri and Dae-Sung during the first attack, and several knights and riders, had also been impaled by tentacles while dealing with the monsters.\n“Ouch…….”\n“Poison…….”\nIn the heat of battle, the rider’s adrenaline was too high to care, but one by one they fell. The knights seem to be holding on, but they don’t look well.\n“We need to find an antidote.”\n“But how, with a monster we’ve never heard of?”\n“Could it be some strange curse cast by orc shamans or barbarians?”\nIn her dozen years of service as a Kingdom Knight, Stella had never seen such an abomination, and neither had Jerea.\nIt’s a new creature, and finding an antidote seems impossible. But…….\n“This poison, I think I recognize it.”\n“What? Sir Jerea?”\nGazes focused at his words. He was the first to be poisoned, and as he examined the spots on his body, he deduced the poison.\n“It’s a neurotoxin from a sea coral. It’s a potent poison and will kill you if left untreated.”\n“Sea coral, you mean? Why would the venom of a sea creature be used by a monster on land…….?”\n“That’s not all, its forepaws are like those of an aardvark, and its skin is like that of a warthog. It’s a mix.”\n“…….”\nThe knights frowned at the words. It was taboo.\nSynthesizing and creating life was the domain of the gods, a taboo that should never be granted to humans.\n“Chimeric synthetic water, the work of warlocks.”\n* * * *\nJerea quickly created the antidote. Dismantling the chimera, he produced the ingredients for the antidote from the tentacles of a sea coral.\n“Horsemen first. We’re in a hurry.”\nJerea fed the antidote to the least resistant riders first.\n“Great… thank you, sir.”\n“Lord Jerea… you must detoxify first…….”\n“Never mind me. I have sworn an oath to protect the knighted, the commoner, as you have sworn to protect the people of the realm.”\nThe duties of nobles and knights. They sacrifice first. None of the knights shirked this duty.\nThe problem came when it came to distributing the antidote among the knights.\n“One…is…insufficient.”\nThree knights were poisoned.\nJerea, a knight errant; Stella, a kingdom knight; and Koo Dae-sung, who was considered to be a squire.\n“Antidote, starting with Sir Stella.”\nJerea half-coercively handed the antidote to the redheaded knight. It was obvious that she, as the one in command, should be the first to be detoxified.\n“Lord Jerea…….”\nStella took the antidote and hesitantly swallowed it, her duties as commander taking over.\n“Ugh… I’m sorry, I burned one of the monsters…….”\nAt Ha-ri’s self-reproach, Jerea pats her on the shoulder and gives her a gentle smile.\n“In battle, you never know what might happen. Don’t blame yourself.”\nJerea then approaches Koo Dae-Sung and offers him the antidote.\n“I….”\nKoo takes the antidote, but hesitates. He is the weakest person in the convoy, and Jerea is the alter ego of a Holy Knight.\nCould anyone even begin to compare their worth?\nWhy does this knight casually hand him the antidote?\n“Here, take it. This old man’s arms are heavy.”\nFeeling burdened by the knight’s unflinching gaze, Koo Dae-Sung accepted the antidote and swallowed it.\nThe powdery antidote clung to the back of his throat, but he washed it down with a drink of water from Ha-ri’s hand.\n“I’ve hidden the entrance more discreetly. Even with their good noses, they won’t be able to track us easily in this cave.”\nJerea summoned the last of her power to ensure the safety of the convoy, and urged them to rest for a while.\n“…!”\n“Lord Jerea!”\nAnd his limit had finally come.\nKnights and horsemen with bonfires burning around him, hooded to make him more comfortable. He was dying with honor, albeit in an alter ego.\n“Sir Jerea…….”\nAt their sad gazes, the aging knight said.\n“Rest assured. Even when this body dies, the old me will be with you again.”\nThe Grail Knight’s recreation of his past is not a one-time event. The countless steps he had taken, the prime of his life, were granted to him for as many as seven times as he fulfilled the Task of Fle.\nIn other words, Jerea could be summoned six more times.\n“But… there is only one of you, isn’t there?”\nKoo Dae-sung’s words struck a chord. Death is death, even if it’s a recreated past. How could he accept his own death so casually?\n“My true body… is protected by the Lady of Death. She favors me, the one connected to her, so… there is no need to grieve. My death will be peaceful.”\nIt was a calm death for him, but one that grieved those who watched. Jerea turned to Koo Dae-sung and said\n“Young knight, you have earned it, and thanks to you, the holy relics have not been defiled by the evil hands.”\nKoo Dae-sung wanted to say that it was a miracle that he had managed to do it at all, that he was a halfpenny who couldn’t even fit on the shaft of a knight.\nThe illusion seemed to weigh him down as he realized that he had only been lucky enough to pick up the hammer.\nJerea’s gaze turned to everyone.\n“Lord Stella.”\n“We are listening, Lord Jerea.”\n“It has become apparent that this mission is… a trap. The question is who is behind it…….”\nThe rare alliance and raid by orcs and barbarians could have been dismissed as a blip in the search for the holy relic.\nBut such a relentless pursuit, a raid by an unknown group…and the capture of a holy chest that the monsters prioritized over their own lives.\n“Someone is after the holy relics…….It must not…must not fall into their hands.”\n“Of course, Sir Jerea.”\n“You… equate me with the Jerea of the Twilight… but I am but a foolish Jerea. Treat my resurrected past as such. This relic must be delivered to the Lionheart King.”\n“…….”\nJerea looked at Stella, unable to speak, and then at death, unable to speak anymore. His blurred gaze stared at the ceiling.\n“Glory be…to the Lionheart…….”\nHe was a knight to the end, and Death willingly wrapped his last breaths in his arms.\n* * * *\n-Gahhhhhh…!\n-Gaahhhhh…!\nThe roar echoed through the canyon. The surrounding orc warriors and beasts stumbled backwards.\n“Ugh…….”\nChimeric monsters that made even the orcs hesitate, let alone the beast gods appeared.\nThe leader of the pursuing party spat, showing his displeasure.\n“To chase with such monstrous creatures.”\n“That’s right. Even though it’s an order from the Great Chief…….”\nIn addition to joining hands with the barbarians, who would normally have taken an axe to the head on sight, they were firmly ordered to never come into conflict with the bastards who started this whole mess.\nOrcs are notorious for disobeying orders, even those of their chieftains, if they don’t like them, but it was the Great Chieftain who gave them their orders.\nBefore his fearsome strength and axe, even the mightiest of Orc warriors would fall to their knees in fear.\n“There is a handy thing, though. These monsters can smell a human.”\nAll around the orcs were the bodies of torn horses and knights. It was one part of the convoy that Grail Knight Jerea had split into five pieces.\n“Damn it, I can’t find that thing! That’s my second bust!”\n“How many convoys are left?”\n“Three.”\n“These chimeras… have any of them not returned?”\n“None.”\nIn other words, all three are dead. Knowing the power of these chimeras, the orcs realized that the remaining three convoys were no match for them.\n“We’ll go after them all. We still have a long way to go to get out of the canyon.”\n“And then?”\n“We’ll hit the weakest ones first.”\nThe orc pursuers’ reasoning was sound.",

      "content": "Chapter 90: Holy Knight Jerea (1)\n“Waaaahhhh…!”\n“Long live Lord Jerea!”\n“Long live King Lionheart…!”\nAmidst the cheers of the soldiers, Leon approached the battlefield that had been devastated by the ‘Purple Mist’.\nNaturally, to escort the king, the knights followed, as well as Jae-hyuk and Soo-ho.\n“Gulp…!”\nThe two swallowed dryly as they surveyed the battlefield in front of them.\nAn overwhelming victory.\nNo, it’s not a matter of a victory or a great victory.\nThere is no battle at all. It’s a one-sided slaughter.\nOnly 30 minutes after Holy Knight Jerea’s departure. The orc camp in front of the canyon has been transformed into a hellhole.\n“In half an hour…over a thousand dead.”\n“This…Holy Knight. It’s not the first time I’ve seen one…….”\nThis is not the first time the two have seen a Holy Knight power. At the Jeju Island Gate, they witnessed the Holy Knight of Earth and Abundance, Majestic Georgic.\nA creature of supernatural power, the pinnacle of earthly existence.\nLiving saints, transcendents chosen by the gods.\nOne of them, an old Holy Knight, straightened his mustache and armor, took a piece of cloth and knelt down to offer it. It was the neck of Krakan.\n“I offer this honor to the Goddess of Death and the Lionheart King.”\nThe chosen one, the strongest of all Holy Knights Leon Dragonia Lionheart, Grail Keeper and the pinnacle of his profession gladly took the offerings in his hands.\n“What a foul, foul thing.”\nKrakan’s head exploded in Leon’s grasp and a knight wiped his hands of the filthy blood.\n“You did it quite spectacularly, Sir Jerea.”\n“I was hoping to draw their attention to their spirits, but…….”\n“Patient for green beasts.”\nLeon felt the eyes on him. He’d backed away from the mist of death, but the orcs were still close, and he didn’t mind that their fierce gazes were on him and Jerea.\nIf anything, the Orc Butcher’s aura emanating from Leon frightened them.\n“If he’s unmoved by this much provocation, he must have a boss with quite a bit of charisma.”\n“In that case… could it be that the Great Chieftain has emerged?”\n“Maybe.”\nLeon searched his memory for the past. “Two hundred years ago… at this gate, two years after the summoning of the Chaos Lord by the Empire, the orcs of the world rallied.”\nThe orcs were on no one’s side in that great war, for it was the orcs who smashed humans and demons alike.\n‘But they were quite organized. Is there an Orc champion, chosen by the Orc gods?’\nThere were some.\nA leader chosen by the orc gods to unite all the orcs and start that great war.\nThe orcs who joined the war against the Evil Ones fought on the opposite side of the battlefield from their own. He heard that the great empire ruled by the Sky King, the great power of the East, fell at the hands of the orcs.\nHe eventually clashed with the same orcs that brought down the Sky King’s empire, dealing with the evildoers, but he didn’t see any great chieftains among them.\nPerhaps there was infighting among them, or perhaps-\n“It’s too early to tell.”\nLeon turned his horse’s head. Ignoring the stares he felt from within the main camp of orcs and beast gods.\n* * * *\nIn a barracks in the canyon, with soldiers standing guard and watching the orcs’ movements, Leon approached the tent of Jerea, the commander of the holy relic convoy.\n“Welcome, Your Majesty, and I apologize for bringing you here in such squalor.”\n“I am not young enough to be slumped on the battlefield.”\n“Haha, how dare anyone dismiss your Majesty as young?”\nLeon appeared to be a young man in his mid-twenties at most. But as a Holy Knight, his body would be reconstructed to his prime.\nWhile Leon had become a Holy Knight at a very young age, it was not uncommon for other Holy Knights to be around the same age or in their thirties.\nLeon is 96 years old by today’s standards, so he’s not the oldest Holy Knight, but he’s also not the youngest.\nJerea, the grandfatherly man in front of him, is 158 years old, which puts him in the middle of the pack.\n“And you… you’re still the same.”\nLeon looked at the aging Holy Knight.\nA man who had traveled to all continents in his 70 years of training.\nAs the oldest Holy Knight, he looked like a gentle old man, even in his prime.\n“I saw you not so long ago, when you were crowned king, but you look so longingly into my eyes. You must be desolate in your old age.”\n“I am not.”\nLeon had lost countless comrades and friends in the Great War against the Demons.\nAmong them were his most trusted Holy Knights, who had ascended first and left him behind, but some Holy Knights did not even see the ascension.\nOne of them was Jerea, right in front of him.\nIt weighed heavily on Leon’s mind that he had not been able to perform the ascension ritual as the Lionheart King for the Holy Knights that accompanied each as they ascended.\nHe was an ugly king who had failed to honor the Holy Knights’ farewells.\n“Lord Jerea. There is something I need to tell you.”\n“I will listen.”\nSlowly, Leon began to tell him the truth of this world.\nThat he had fought demons for two hundred years, and that the world had been destroyed.\nThat he had founded a new pantheon on Earth, and that it too was being invaded by demons.\nThat he opened the gates to this place…among other things…….\n“You have already ascended. I met you in the paradise of the gods.”\nThat Jerea had already died and ascended to the Paradise of the Gods.\n“…….”\nJerea was speechless from all the shocking news.\nAnyone would be. That he was already dead, that the world had ended, that he was merely reliving a moment in history.\nThere was nothing shocking about it, nothing to deny but not this old knight.\n“I’m sorry.”\nJerea rose from his seat and fell to his knees.\n“How can you be sorry? Get up!”\nLeon hastily helped him to his feet, but Jerea swallowed his bitterness and poured out his grief.\n“How thou hast borne that long fight…alone. Do not forgive this disloyal knight.”\nJerea was only sorry that he had not fought with the king to the end.\nAs he helped him to his feet with this confession of guilt, he heard his future and was convinced.\n“If I had died at the hands of the orcs…the rise of an orc overlord would be a virtual certainty.”\n“That would be true. There will be a champion on this battlefield, chosen by one of the orc gods.”\nOrcs are spread across the continents, across the world, but from time to time a great chieftain emerges who unites several orc tribes.\nThose who can unite as few as five or as many as ten orc tribes rise to the position of Great Chieftain.\nIn an Orc society where the strongest are the bosses, the only Orcs with such power are the Orc Champions, who are favored by the Orc gods.\nSince ancient times, the rise of an Orc Champion has meant a great war.\nLeon himself had fought in two such wars, earning the honorary title of “Greatest Orc Slayer.”\n“So, Your Majesty, what is it that you wish to accomplish here?”\n“Fundamentally, one thing.”\nExperimenting with gates. Getting loot from the system’s quests is secondary.\n“But when I came through this gate, there was another thing.”\n“????”\nLeon flashed a rare smile at his burly comrade-in-arms.\n“This time I want to be with my friend to the end.”\n* * * *\nThe story of the clueless Jerea was well known to Leon.\nWhen Leon was only twenty-seven years old and preparing to go to war with the orcs as a Holy Knight and War Knight, he saw an attendant knight who rode up on horseback to join him in this war.\n“Tell me your name, my lord.”\n“My name is Jerea, second son of Baron Bertum, and I served in the Knights of Riona Sunset.”\nAn 87 year old paladin who was aging slowly, even for a Lionheart. From what he had heard, it was already fifty years ago that he had served in the Order as a Kingdom Knight.\nLeon was quick to reject the old attendant knight’s participation.\n“Sir Jerea. This orc crusade is a war against an orc champion. It may be too dangerous for you to go.”\nHe spoke quickly, but in the end, he meant to send him back. Many knights might take it as an insult, or they might take it as consideration.\nRegardless of how he took it, Leon had no intention of sending him into battle.\nHis knowledge and experience on Earth hadn’t completely faded, and an old man in his eighties was hardly the age to be sent into battle.\nExcept for super-powered creatures like the Holy Knights, even knights were only human in the end.\n“Honorable Holy Knight of Light and Justice, please give me the last seat. I don’t care if I have to mix with commoner horsemen or carry a pike among the Man-At-Arms.”\nIt was a great insult to the knight. Heavy armored knights, who were supposed to fight for glory with honor, would fight among light cavalry and common infantry?\nIt meant giving up any chance at glory.\n“Why would you go to such lengths to join the war? There are other ways to achieve glory.”\n“It’s not just about honor and glory. It’s about my attitude, my way of life.”\nLeon realized the grit in this ragged, clueless, mocked knight.\nSometimes he battled monsters in the mud, sometimes he rode alongside mercenaries to earn his keep, sometimes he climbed thundering mountains bare-chested and without a single piece of equipment──\n“You just live for the moment.”\nLeon had a hunch that this man would be like this until the moment he died.\n* * * *\nDawn. A time when the sun has not yet risen.\nOrc life is honest.\nThey get up in the morning, eat for lunch, fight in the afternoon, eat for dinner, and go to sleep at night.\nIt could be said to be the same as humans, but much simpler and more “ignorant” than humans, who split their time and sometimes even shift between day and night.\nStrong and simple, that’s the idea of orcs.\nUnsurprisingly, then, the orcs’ weaknesses are clear. They were vulnerable to night raids.\n-Fire!\n-Tents on fire!\nThe orcs were awakened by flames from the corners of their dens.\n“What’s going on?”\nMorkan, one of the orc chieftains mobilized for this war, grabbed a boisterous orc and demanded.\n“The food storage is on fire, the humans are attacking!”\n“Didn’t the beastly things do the guarding?”\n“I don’t know!”\nThere were not only orcs here, but also barbarians who worshiped beast gods. They must have been standing guard at night…….\n“Stupid humans!”\nBut even they must have their share of injustice.\nOn the other side of the canyon, the humans numbered only a few hundred while on this side they were tens of thousands.\nEven if thousands of orcs had been slaughtered during the day, they were still outnumbered. How could he dare to attack them at night?\nAnd that’s just the two of them.\n“The smell of burning beasts is delicious.”\n“Yes, my lord.”\nBeyond the blazing flames two knights were watching in the darkness.\nNeedless to say it was Leon and Jerea.\nWith their transcendent strength and all-around ability to handle any situation, the Holy Knights were able to inflict great damage on the orc camp with just a couple of raids.\n“Your Majesty, you could have left this to me alone.”\n“Don’t take all the glory, my friend. I merely wish to see the end of those beasts.”\n“Your Majesty’s presence makes it easier, though.”\n“Well, it would be easier if Queen Spero or Lord Spinner were here.”\n“Queen Spero and… Lord Spinner?”\nIt was a connection Leon had made in another world. Of course he wouldn’t know.\n“Not that I care. If we’re lucky, we’ll be able to join them, and I’ll explain then.”\n“I’m looking forward to that.”\n“But it’s just the two of us today. We’re going to have to make sure those orcs get their asses kicked tonight.”\nAt that, Jerea smiled a crooked smile. It was a smile the orcs would have blasphemed as ‘demons’ if they had seen it.\n“We have two Holy Knights here. What’s impossible?”\nHoly Knights are super weapons that could transcend legions in a single bound.\nJerea figured nothing was impossible with the most powerful Holy Knight of them all.\n“A moment that will end up being a fleeting vision. I will extract as much information as I can for your Majesty.”\nJerea was willing to sacrifice this moment to uncover the truth about the failed Holy Relic convoy that history would never recognize.\nAnd if this moment didn’t turn out the way it should.\nIf this moment is a faithful recreation of the Lionheart Kingdom as it was then.\n‘I have him.’\nA Holy Knight comparable to the Lionheart King.",

      "content": "Chapter 91: Holy Knight Jerea (2)\nBy fulfilling the task given to them by the gods and drinking the holy water of the Grail given to them by the Lionheart King, they are able to reconstruct their bodies and become Holy Knights.\nThe Holy Knight’s powers are most notable for their status as an “agent of the gods.\nArianna of light and justice.\nPoma of the sea and waves.\nFle of dreams and death.\nPetos of war and flame.\nDemera of life and fertility.\nHero of iron and blacksmithing.\nUltima of the sky and thunder.\nTatar of the Sun and Judgment.\nDinah of the Moon and Purity.\nIrmin of the forest and trees.\nVentasis of darkness and vengeance.\nSustained by the faith of their followers, they grant their representatives, or “living saints,” the power of the faith offered to them.\nIn other words, unlike the Knights, who are limited to their own holy power, the Holy Knight transforms all the faith offered to a deity into holy power.\nAs such, a Holy Knight is a vast repository of faith that encompasses the deity and its followers, and their natural ability, given their immense holy power, is Perfect Vitality.\nVitality. In other words, living power.\nIn other words, a Holy Knight maintains ‘perfect vitality’ at any given moment──\n“How can these lunatics raid for three days straight without rest!”\nThey never tire.\nNo matter how many days… no, hundreds of years… of intense battles, their bodies never run out of energy.\n“We’ve already been attacked over three hundred times!”\nThe barbarian tribes that worship the beast gods are tired of the unrelenting raids that have been going on since the night, three days ago.\nThey understand if it’s a nighttime raid. No, they honestly don’t.\nA battle requires a minimum of soldiers, but there were only 2 enemies against an army of tens of thousands.\nThe raids even occurred during the day.\nRaiding food stores, blowing up weapons caches, and even slaughtering entire tribes of orcs before making their escape.\n‘Those fanatics, singing their songs of honor…!’\nSurprise is not honorable. The Knights of the Lionheart may sing of righteousness from the front, but they are brutally ignoring it when it comes to the three classes of enemies.\nOrcs, heretics, and demons.\nThey make no secret of their Lionheart-style I-do-it, you-do-it, dishonor mentality, saying that honor is about choosing whom you defend.\n“Why the hell can’t we catch them!?”\n“Because…….”\nThey’re Holy Knights.\nEveryone knew it.\nThe ones that defied all odds and impossibilities, freaks whose very existence was unreasonable.\nThey knew it and even their tribal leader, Dagil knew it.\nThey just didn’t want to believe in this unreasonable reality.\n“Chief… At this rate, we’re just going to be played by them. We have to find a way…….”\nIf there was a way, they would have killed the Holy Knights long ago.\nFor whatever reason, Lionheart’s old enemies had been slaughtered time and time again over the millennia.\nIt was because there was so little they could do in the face of the most powerful creatures on earth.\n“We must do something…!”\n-Quang!\nIt was then.\nThere was a commotion outside the tent where the barbarians were holding their tribal council, and then a chunk of meat was thrown inside.\nWith a thud, the chunk of meat was thrown into the tent was…a barbarian in the shape of a bear.\n“What?!”\nBarbarians who dedicate their souls to the Iron King are granted a body that is harder and more massive than anyone else’s but to blow off the upper half of such a warrior?\n“What the…what are you doing, Champion of Helkan!”\nThe orc wielding a heavy club emanates a fierce energy came soundlessly from the entrance of the tent\nIt is proof that the orc has the blessing of Helkan. In other words, he is a champion of Helkan.\n“I told you to break through, until yesterday.”\nA gravelly voice echoed through the tent and the barbarians trembled in fear at his mere presence.\nBut Dagil braced himself, trying to absorb his aura. He is the chieftain of the Black Eagle clan, the leader of the Barbarians, who has the right to summon the embodiment of the Beast God.\nEven the most powerful champion of the Orc gods would be doomed if he lost here, and his place in their brutalized barbarian society would be over.\nBut the Champion of Helkan has no such qualms.\n-Boom!\n“What?!”\nDagil groaned as a large hand grabbed him by the nape of the neck. The mighty white warrior immediately cast beatification, but was unable to break free of his grasp.\n‘Pfft…! What kind of power is this?’\nHe is an elder who in his youth had even fought a Holy Knight but the power he sensed from the fighter in front of him was more powerful than anything he had ever experienced.\n‘This…is stronger than a Holy Knight!’\nSixty years ago, he had fought a mighty Holy Knight and had barely escaped alive then, but the orc in front of him was stronger than the Holy Knight!\n“We’ll attack tomorrow. Send in the troops.”\n“Ha, but…! They have two Holy Knights!”\n“Me and the great warrior of Skunik will join hands.”\nAt this, Dagil eyes lit up. Two champions of the Orc gods in this day and age?\nIf what he said was true, tomorrow’s battle would be a foregone conclusion.\n“Ah, I see.”\nDagil nodded, fearful of the searing red gaze.\n“Then, starting today, we will launch an all-out attack──”\n-BOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\nDagil was about to make a decision as Clan Leader when a bugle began to blare furiously from the direction of the canyon.\n“What’s going on?”\nIt was not the trumpets of orcs or barbarians.\nDagil and the orc champion left their tents and headed toward the source of the sound, and there-─\n“Hear, beasts!”\nGrail Knight Jerea, had the audacity to hover in front of the orcs’ serious faces.\n“I speak to you lowly beasts in the name of the Lionheart King, and you shall fall down and listen to my overflowing offer!”\nWith those words, Jerea hurled his spear as hard as he could into the center of the orcs. The javelin, rippling with the Holy Knight’s power, pierced one orc before stopping.\n-Black!\nJerea, who had just witnessed the death of an Orc, was not the least bit sorry.\n“Tsk, His Majesty’s robe is stained with the blood of a filthy green beast, a mortal sin that will tear at their souls even in death.”\nThe orc were indignant, but Jerea turned his horse’s head and turned back toward the leaders.\n* * * * *\n“You insolent bastards!”\nThe Kingdom’s message through the javelin was simple.\n“One on one.”\nThere was a lot of rhetoric, but that’s all the ignorant orcs and barbarians understood.\nEach would choose a warlord, and the orcs, barbarians, and kingdom troops would duel.\n“We don’t need to accept this, these despicable bastards have been sneaking around all night, and now they want to duel!”\nThe terms were too favorable to the king’s army.\nIf they lost, they’d retreat, but that’s something that can be accomplished through combat.\nOn the other hand, they had two Holy Knights, the strongest creatures on earth.\nThe odds are not in their favor in a one-on-one fight. In the first place, a monster like a Holy Knight could not be defeated by a single person──\n“…….”\nDagil’s gaze flickered toward the orcs.\nTwo races that normally wouldn’t even hold a meeting together were gathered together, and here were the ‘champions’ of the Orc gods.\n‘It’s worth a try.’\nThe orc gods, cranky and selfish as they were, made a rare choice of their champions.\nHelkan, God of Struggle, Lord of the Orcs\nGokrok, the orc god of shamans.\nSkunik, the orc god of hunting.\nMighty orc warriors whose champions were chosen by the mighty orc gods themselves.\n“What are you going to do? I think we have a pretty good chance if you guys show up.”\n“…….”\nThe orc champion stared at Dagil, who, overwhelmed by his presence, casually averted his gaze and rolled his eyes.\n“We’ve done our part, anyway.”\nHe was surprised. The barbarians could stir up a fight at the mere sight of the Holy Knight.\nThey know their power and their transcendent strength. Even though the barbarians were treated as serf candidates, not even as human beings, they were like servants.\nOrcs were slaughtered for entertainment by the Lionheart Kingdom.\nIf anyone should be afraid, it should be the orcs, but they seemed to welcome this confrontation.\n“The Holy Knight. I’ve always wanted to face one.”\nBalbaza, champion of the God of Struggle Helkan, was more than happy to accept the challenge.\n“The Holy Knight’s body… I’ll take it.”\n“Give me the skin.”\nMaghar, champion of the orc shaman god Gokrok and Skira, champion of the hunting god Skunik.\nThe three orc champions willingly agreed to the duel.\nAs a race of warriors who revere fierce battles and are born to fight, they always look forward to a fight with the strongest.\n* * * *\nThe other day, Beatrice rode out of the canyon and joined the knight cadets.\n“Wow, my queen, I was so… scared…!”\n“Are you all right, I’m glad you weren’t hurt.”\nIt had been three days since the cadets had been scattered, but they had managed to find each other.\nBeatrice’s convoy of holy relics had been crushing monsters and pursuers alike with overwhelming power.\nAt one point, chimeras appeared, but such monsters could not be the Queen’s enemies.\n“The others… don’t they have to join us?”\nChen So-yeon asked. She wiped her sword clean of the blood of the monsters that had attacked and mentioned those who were not present.\nThe corners of Beatrice’s mouth twitched benevolently, for despite her stern demeanor, she was concerned for her companions.\n“Part of the quest was to defend Lord Jerea’s main body, right? The fact that the king hasn’t shown up here suggests that he’s probably on his way.”\nWhen she first entered the gate, Beatrice had cast a tracking spell to locate the cadets.\nOf the four who weren’t here, two were with Leon, and the other two were with what she assumed was another convoy.\nProblem is, they’re too far away.\n“That’s good, but…….”\nSo-yeon, who had been worried about her academy classmates Jae-hyuk and Soo-ho, was inwardly relieved. The problem is the other three.\nKoo Dae-sung, Han Ha-ri…and Yakt Spinner.\nKoo Dae-sung and Han Ha-ri are with the convoy, but Yakt Spinner is nowhere to be found.\n“Where the hell is Lord Yappy?”\nShe asks Beatrice, who should have a tracking spell on him, but she just shakes her head and gives her a blank stare.\n“He’s beyond my range of detection. I thought I had every nook and cranny in this canyon covered.”\nWhere the hell had that super-intelligent knight gone?\nEither way, it’s dereliction of duty.\nOf course, no one believes that the Yakt Spinner would have disappeared through the gate.\nThe Yakt Spinner is an unfeeling killing machine, the ultimate in efficiency. The most bizarre character in the pantheon of gods, far removed from human common sense.\n“I wonder what he’s up to.”\n…………\n………\n……\n…\nEight hundred kilometers above the Valley of Death and the Imperial border.\nTwenty-four hours have passed since the challenger entered orbit, the ‘first’ to do so, unconquered by anyone since the dawn of Divine history.\n-Orbit stalled. Calculating gravity impact.\n-Clear. Observing the gate’s world-realization rate.\nWhen the Yakt Spinner first arrived on Earth, he was disappointed.\nThe level of civilization and science on Earth was beyond his wildest dreams.\nYappy era was a time of satellite terraforming and space exploration, if not for the invasion of demons.\nTo Yappy, who is the essence of that technology, Earth’s civilization’s space technology is a baby.\nBut in the absence of any infrastructure, he had no choice but to improve upon their crude satellite launcher technology.\nAnd it was quite successful.\n-In-gate satellite launch experiment successful. Observations limited. Anomalies being calculated.\nHowever, the satellites launched from inside the gate had their limitations.\nIn essence, a gate is a scene from history that recreates the events of an era.\nIt is only a representation of a region, not the entire planet.\nAt first, the ground observed from space has the appearance of a planet, but no information can be observed except for the canyon where the quest is taking place, some of the Imperial borders… and the Lionheart border.\nIn other words, the other places haven’t been implemented in the gate at all.\n-Measuring the situation. Main body injection system activated. Integrated Armament Platform MK.2 on standby.\nAfter observing and deciding that it was not necessary for him to act immediately, Yappy scanned the canyon, the Empire, and the Lionheart border to gather as much information as possible.\nAs he continued his observations, he saw a group of knights waiting on the border of what he assumed to be the Lionheart Kingdom.\n-High energy body observation.\nIt was a Red Knight.\nA presence that the machine ‘instinctively’ felt, even though it was observing from 800 kilometers above.\nThere was an unspoken momentum about this knight that was distinctly different from the others around him.\nThe moment he zoomed in on the wide-angle lens to get a closer look-─\n-What?\nThe red knight raised his head. For a moment, Yappy calculated that he had made eye contact with the knight.\nNo, it couldn’t be. The machine’s logic circuits insisted it was impossible.\nThis was high in space, in orbit, 800 kilometers above the ground. It would be impossible to make eye contact with a terrestrial creature there…\nUnless he was mistaken in his observations but the Red Knight’s lips were clearly saying.\n“Go away.”",

      "content": "Chapter 92: Holy Knight Jerea (3)\nLeon challenged the orcs to a duel for two main reasons.\nThe first is to get to the bottom of this historical mystery.\nWhy did Jerea die here, and why did the holy relic never reach the kingdom?\nWho intervened in this history? What is the real story?\nIf the orcs responded, he could see what their hand was, and if they didn’t, it didn’t matter.\nIt would mean that their leader was cunning enough to see beyond the immediate struggle.\n“There is also the aspect of buying time. If their main force is tied up here, it will make life much easier for those escorting the relics.”\nOf course, in the original story, Jerea had succeeded in tying up the Orc main force quite a bit.\nThe distance between the Baltaric Legion and Jerea would have been considerable, and the main legion would have been far behind.\n“Nevertheless, the convoy failed to deliver the holy relic.”\n“Then… isn’t that a big deal? Doesn’t it mean that even if we stop the orcs here, we’ll fail in the end?”\nJae-hyuk and Soo-ho had heard from Leon that the convoy had failed.\nThe holy relics were supposed to be the maximum reward from this gate, but if they failed, wouldn’t the gate capture also fail?\n“I wonder about that too.”\nJerea had done enough for the convoy.\nEven if he a superhuman like a Holy Knight himself, he still had an alter ego attached to the Holy Relics that could die and relive the past.\nA seasoned knight who had traveled the world to become a Holy Knight should have been able to outrun the orcs.\n‘But he did not reach the borders of Lionheart.’\nSomething else had intervened.\nAfter listening to Leon’s story and pondering, Soo-ho cautiously raised his hand.\n“Your Majesty… Then shouldn’t we go to support the convoy instead of staying here?”\nAfter all, protecting this place is only a ‘side mission’. The main quest is the Holy Relic Convoy.\nThe main base here will eventually be defeated without Leon, but everyone here are just NPC’s recreated from history.\n“Practically speaking, it’s the right thing to do. After all, this is about paying off this king’s personal debt.”\nLeon felt a sense of debt to Jerea, who had ascended during the mission he’d been sent on, but also to all those who had been with him.\nMost of them had been admitted to Paradise of the Gods, and none of them blamed him… but he wanted to keep them alive, if only in this false history.\nOf course, he didn’t abandon the quest out of a sense of debt alone.\n“There is Lord Spinner and Queen Beatrice. I’m sure they can handle things in this king absence.”\n“I see…I see.”\nBoth Beatrice and Yappy are superhumans who have attained the rank of Holy Knight.\nOf course, Yappy hasn’t been able to recover his body, which was the nightmare of the Earth hunters, but there is also Beatrice.\nThe magician queen of the Kingdom of Spero, her strength is such that even S-class Hunters don’t stand a chance against her.\n“And…maybe if we can get that guy to come along, we’ll be fine.”\n“The man?”\nWhen Soo-ho tilted his head, Leon closed his eyes as if reminiscing about old memories.\n“At this time in the past…his knights were standing by to greet the convoy, though it was thwarted by Imperial opposition.”\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart, the 15th Lionheart King.\nThe Grail Keeper, the most powerful of all time, there were certainly superhumans of the Glory Generation.\nSaint Anak.\nGunnar the Sage.\nAnton the Guardian.\nEach and every one of them shook the continent to its core and if Leon had to pick a favorite, he’d pick the man.\nBefore the Great War, when Leon was still a young Grail Guardian… there was only one knight who could surpass him.\n“I miss you, comrade. And…….”\nGrail Knight Georgic, a Grail Knight not found anywhere in the Paradise of the Gods.\nThe flame.\nThe Butcher.\nThe mightiest holy sword.\nIf he is lucky, someone in the Ten Thousand Gods Guild will face him.\n* * * *\nA rugged valley in the wilderness that stretches across the North and the Empire.\nTens of thousands of green waves have marched through it, right up to the noses of the kingdom’s armies.\nOnly to be met by hundreds of Kingdom troops who stand like rocks at the narrow entrance.\nDespite the overwhelming power differential, which common sense tells us should never be able to hold, they’ve been blocking the army’s advance for over four days.\nThis is due to the overwhelming experience and skill of the Kingdom army… and the presence of the Holy Knights.\nThe orcs, tired of the constant guerrilla warfare of the Holy Knights with their boundless vitality, accepted their request for a duel, and the fighters of both armies gathered in the center of the field.\n“Is this a good… sword, if I don’t get it right, they’ll come right at me?”\nJae-hyuk groaned at the sight of the green wave in front of him.\nSo far, they had managed to hold out in the narrow canyon, but the number of orcs in the main army was truly unbelievable.\nIt was unbelievable how they had managed to hold out against such a large army.\nNo, in reality, the orcs couldn’t use their power properly.\nWith such a narrow canyon, there are only so many troops that can be projected. Orcs may be simple, but they’re not stupid enough to not know the basics of military strategy.\nThey are not foolish enough to push their troops into a canyon full of knights.\n“We’ve come this far… I’m sure we’ll get through if we push hard enough…….”\nBut in the face of tens of thousands of troops, the kingdom’s army, which is only a few hundred strong, looks like leaves to be swept away by a storm.\nJerea patted Jae-hyuk on the shoulder and reassured him.\n“They may be lowly beasts, but they have a code that must be followed.”\nHelkan, God of Struggle, Lord of the Orcs.\nWhile Helkan revels in the blood-washing slaughter of the masses, he also revels in the one-on-one combat of a duel.\n“Orcs never touch the winner of a life-and-death duel. It is one of the few virtues of their tradition.”\nIt was one of the few qualities that the Knights of the Lionheart held in high esteem, as the orcs were savage and favored bloodshed.\nLeon does not deny Jerea’s words. After all, he’s dueled with orc fighters himself.\n“Let’s get going.”\n“I’ll lead the way.”\nThe four of them set off from the main camp of the kingdom’s army, closing in on the gathered masses.\n-Kill! Kill! Kill!\n-Helkan is watching!\n-Kill the armored ones!\nLeon clicks his tongue at the roar of the orcs in the arena.\n“Tsk, undignified things.”\n“Yes, they are. Always the loud ones with the most momentum.”\nThere were four opponents on the other side, three orcs and a barbarian.\nOne of them stepped forward. He was the tallest of the orcs and carried a huge axe.\n“You have come, strong men.”\nLarge molars, simple but heavy shield-like armor. He spoke cynically.\n“The rules of the fight are simple. He who dies is the loser.”\nIt was a simple rule, plain and simple. The orc shouted.\n“I am Balbaza, champion of Helkan, undefeated! Who is the warrior who will fight me?”\nThe Champion of the Gods. Jerea and Leon exchanged glances.\nAfter all, there was a Champion of God on this battlefield. Was he the leader of the orcs?\nIn any case, the other side sent out a duelist. It was this side’s turn to step forward.\n“A braggart beast boasts of his undefeated record in the Shallow Well, Jerea of Twilight, Holy Knight of Dreams and Death!”\n“Yes, Your Majesty!”\n“Go and fetch the head of that shameless beast!”\n“At your command!”\nJerea willingly stepped forward as he asked to be allowed to go ahead of the king.\nHe stepped forward, carrying a sword that paled in comparison to Balbaza massive axe.\n“Your opponent is this old man.”\n“Name yourself.”\nHad this been an ordinary opponent, Jerea would have gladly revealed his honored name. But instead, he glared at Balbaza with contempt and twisted the corners of his mouth.\n“I have no name to reveal to a brute. You will die here today.”\n“Old man, the impossible is not to be spoken of.”\n“I’ve been through the impossible before. Who do you think you are in front of?”\nBalbaza raises his axe, heat rising from the corners of his mouth.\n“Then today will be the first day I break the impossible.”\nHe swung the axe.\n* * * *\nOrc Champion Balbaza, Warlord of Helkan.\nOrc warlord and chieftain who united seven orc tribes.\nHe is the chosen one of Helkan, the unforgiving and demanding god whom all Orcs serve.\nIn other words, his life has been a history of struggle, and he is a warrior that Helkan was pleased with.\nThe northern part of the Lionheart Kingdom and the northwestern part of the Empire is a rugged craggy land commonly known as the Savage Lands was a place of killing and destruction, domination and subjugation.\nBalbaza was born to the weakest of the orc tribes that inhabit these harsh lands.\nThere, at the youngest age, Balbaza rose to chieftaincy as the largest orc in the tribe.\nHe proclaimed.\n“I am the largest orc! My tribe must be the biggest!”\nBalbaza conquered all the neighboring orc tribes. Even the smallest tribe was three times the size of Balbaza’s, but they fell to the mighty axe of the great orc.\nBorn to be a champion, Balbaza fought tirelessly, and his struggles satisfied Helkan.\nHis strength was arguably the greatest of the age.\n“Die, human.”\nIt was a massive axe, an axe that could have covered Jerea’s entire torso, and could have shattered the armor of a Holy Knight.\nThe three swords that blocked it, on the other hand, looked so thin and weak… they couldn’t withstand a single blow from Balbaza’s axe.\n-Crack!\nThe sound was too light to be that of steel being cut. The axe that had split Jerea’s sword in two instantly struck the old knight.\n“What…!”\nJerea’s eyes filled with horror, but he couldn’t dodge the axe. The next moment, Balbaza’s axe sliced through Jerea’s head, splitting it in two.\n-Kwazizik!\nThe strong Holy Knight’s body splits along with his armor. Balbaza looked down at the fallen Jerea with satisfaction and raised his axe.\n“I win!”\n-Waaaaaah!!!\nThe orcs roar and cheer, a sound he’s heard countless times before. Balbaza named his next opponent.\n……\n…\n“”…….””\nThe audience in the arena, Jae-hyuk and Soo-ho, as well as the orcs, stared in wonder at Balbaza, who hadn’t moved since the beginning.\nBalbaza hasn’t moved a step since the duel began.\nOnly Leon and Jerea understand the situation.\n“It worked, a beast is a beast.”\nJerea casually walks toward Balbaza, who continues to drop his head as the duelist approaches.\n“Ah…!\n“The Holy Knight of Dreams and Death!\nOnly then did the two realize what Jerea had done.\nHoly Law.\nFor Jerea, who is endowed with the power of dreams and death, making an orc fall into a dream is not a hard task.\nBy now, Balbaza must be celebrating his victory in his dreams, unaware of his approaching death in the real world.\nJerea has coated his sword with a death aura. A lethal blow that kills at the mere touch.\nJerea’s dreams and lethal connections to death flood in.\n“Die in a sweet dream.”\nThe moment the sword rushes towards Balbaza-──\n“WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA────!!!\nWith a scream, the orc warrior opened his eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 93: Holy Knight Jerea (4)\nJerea saw the moment when Balbaza’s eyes widened but he did not stop. His sword was already rushing toward Balbaza, and even if he were to parry, he was sure to wound him.\nHoly Law<Execution Aura>, a one-hit killing move that coats an object with the power of death.\nUpon contact, the power erodes and slowly kills the target.\n‘At this distance, at this speed… I will reach it!’\nA purple flash of light flashes eerily. Balbaza stretches out his hand, his eyes fixed on the inevitability of death.\nGrasp!\nBalbaza grasped the hilt.\n‘Amazing reflexes.’\nJerea marvels, but it makes no difference.\nGrabbing a sword covered in death aura with his bare hands, that’s the end of it…\n“……!”\nAt that moment, Jerea hurriedly pulled his body backwards to avoid the striking axe.\n-Chew!\nJerea’s retreat was too late, and the axe blade scratched from his left shoulder to his right chest side.\nThe shoulder joint, a gap in the armor, is cut, but the main body of the armor is only dented as Jerea stumbles backward.\nBut it doesn’t matter. The shoulder blade was cut a little, but he had slashed his arm with the power of death. The eroded death power must have sunk into him—-\n“A stab.”\n“…….”\nA fiery aura was emanating from Balbaza’s hand that held Jerea’s sword.\nHe wasn’t dead, but rather, he was emitting a destructive energy that was crushing the Purple’s holy power.\n“……Helkan’s power.”\n“Yes. I am the Great Hand of Helkan and I have the power to crush and destroy all things.”\nThe orc god Helkan puts a part of his own flesh on his champion.\nBalbaza has received the power of Helkan’s great hand and its strength is divine.\n“The remnants of your armor are meaningless before these arms.”\nEven the Holy Laws of the Holy Knights, wielders of concepts and laws, are powerless before those arms. The Knights of the Lionheart will never recognize the gods of the Orcs, but they are one and the same.\nA battle of divinity against divinity is inevitably a battle of strength.\n“Well, that’s certainly annoying.”\n“You think you’re the only ones who can use divine power──”\nAs if to mock Balbaza’s confidence, there was a flash of light.\nThree swords, specialized for sharp stabs, pierce through the cracks in his consciousness, performing an artful surprise but Balbaza shakes his head, dodging the fleeting assault.\nA purplish aura flickers, leaving a residue in the space but that was not the end of Jerea’s assault.\n-Shhhhhh…!\nOne strike, two strikes, three strikes…Thirteen strikes in an instant.\nA fierce, super-speedy stab that could pierce through space.\nIt was only when Balbaza raised his axe, unable to parry all the attacks that sometimes sliced through his armor.\n“……!”\nThe moment he raised his arm, it stopped moving, as if eroded by something.\nNo, that’s not all. His entire body was paralyzed.\nParalyzed? No, it wasn’t that. This was his will.\nAn animalistic instinct that had warned him countless times that if he moved, he would die.\n‘Heavy…!’\nThe fighter immediately realized that this was a defensive instinct, triggered by some threat.\nFor what seemed like an eternity, Jerea continued to strike, the heavy mass of death at the tip of his blade surrounding him on all sides. It warned of instant death on contact.\nHoly Law <Instant Death Vigilance>\nHis holy power maneuvering is something to behold. It overcomes the disadvantage of its physical size, making it an oversized bull’s-eye.\n“I hope you die with this.”\nJust as the cynical knight’s final blow is about to be delivered, the purple masses that bind Balbaza twist.\nWith a flick of his arm, the deathly forces that had encircled him scattered.\n“I told you, you can’t defeat me with just holy power!”\nThe enormous power of his axe is imbued Helkan’s great hand and he swings.\n-Kaaaaaah!\nWith a resounding crash, the aftermath of the swing is revealed as Helkan’s energy splits the earth, crushing it to pieces.\n“…….”\nJerea squinted to see the aftermath of the destruction.\n‘The axe crushed the earth.’\nA slight misdirection would have split the canyon and buried the entrance.\nStrong.\nThe power to crush the armor of a Holy Knight, the destructive power of Helkan divine power.\nIndeed, the Champion of Helkan.\nBalbaza’s red aura pulses with ferocity as he charges. His movements were frighteningly fast and powerful for such a large being.\n-Boom!\nJerea dodged the axe, but the shards of stone from the crushed earth struck his entire body.\n“Thud…!”\nThere was no time to complain about the terrifyingly heavy blow, as a ferocious fist dug in but Jerea’s three swords barely deflected it.\nThe next moment was a series of clashes that left the onlookers stunned.\n“Crazy…….”\nNot only modern people like Jae-hyuk and Soo-ho… but everyone in the room was holding their breath.\nThis was a confrontation between transcendents.\nEven if they were modern humans living in the age of the Awakened, modern weapons are not the end of the world for them.\nUnable to function properly in the special environment of the Gate, modernized weapons are devastating against their human counterparts on Earth.\nNo matter how powerful a Hunter’s skills are, they are no match for a two-thousand-pound bomb dropped by a bomber.\nAnd in Leon’s time… even if the Holy Knights are powerhouses, even if each and every one of them is a nuclear missile… they are still pre-modern wielders of cold weapons…\nThat should be all there is to it.\n-Boom!\n-Boom!\nThe impact of steel on steel was as fierce as ever as the wind pressure from the broken axe created a storm and the flash of a deflected stab tears a hole in the valley behind him.\nTheir power is different but transcendents are not just fleeting miracle workers. Their every action is a miracle, far beyond the limits of what a single creature can do.\nThe aftermath of the Orc Champion’s clash with the Holy Knight of Dreams and Death had already formed a single ground zero, a field of destruction that dropped all who approached it.\nJae-hyuk and Soo-ho are stunned by the phenomenon before them and they are in awe.\nIn an era filled with such things, the Lionheart King had survived alone and become the final victor.\n“Hahahahaha…! You’re holding up well, old man!”\nBlood splatters as axes and swords slash at each other, and even with the venomous stabs of instant death, Jerea is at a disadvantage.\n‘The beast… it’s too strong for a Life Spirit.’\nYes, this was the problem.\nEndowed with Helkan powers that specialized in combat, Balbaza was both monstrous and monstrously powerful, but he also possessed a frighteningly large Life Spirit.\nShort of a divinely enforced death, Jerea can only chip away at Balbaza’s life force.\nHowever, Balbaza’s life force was so immense that it was impossible to do so.\n“Whoa…….”\nJerea was weakened from the blood that had been drained from his perfect vitality and Balbaza sneered at him.\n“What, you’re tired already, you sure look your age.”\nFor every ten strikes Jerea landed, Balbaza single blow tilted the scales of equity.\nTheir power was different.\n“WHAAAAAAAAAA────!!!”\nWith a beastly roar, Balbaza lunges at Jerea, who immediately catches the blow with his sword, but the difference in power between the two is self-evident.\n“Kwak…!”\nThe swirling red energy of the axe sent Jerea tumbling to the ground. Balbaza rushed forward with the same momentum as the beast and slammed his axe down.\n-Boom!\nA dizzying sound rings out as the blade shreds the ground around him.\nThe blade slams into Jerea, whose knees buckle under the weight of the axe. His body bounces off the ground and his stripped helm rolls in a heap.\n“As expected.”\nBalbaza gripped Jerea’s helmet in one hand and the stellar-iron helmet, imbued with stellar energy clinked in his hand.\n“In the end, you are but a weak mortal.”\n“Ugh…….”\nWith a groan, Jerea understood. Indeed, his history was to be defeated by this orc here.\nJerea’s gaze turned to the watching king.\n“…….”\nHis glorious king watches the scene with a frown. He appears to be calm, but his grip is tight, as if he’s restraining a rising anger.\nWhat a pity.\nWhat a disloyal thing to do, to roll on the ground and bleed to death at the hands of a beast when the glory of victory would have been enough.\nJerea was outraged that in real history he would have brought such dishonor upon Leon.\n“Where are your eyes?”\nJust then, Balbaza’s fist dug into Jerea’s breastplate. With a shattering crunch, Jerea’s new armor rolled across the floor.\nBalbaza jeered at Jerea who was covered in dirt and bleeding profusely.\n“It’s over, old man. You, Holy Knight, will crumble at my hands today.”\nThe axe glowed with a frenzied energy.\nThe axe struck, and Jerea did not dodge it.\n* * * *\nIn the silence that came with the clash. All around him is silence, like the throbbing of a dying heart.\n“…….”\n“…….”\nThe look on the faces of the Kingdom troops as they watch in the silence is devastating.\nBalbaza’s axe slashes from shoulder blade to thigh. The only reason his body isn’t cut in half is because he lacked the slightest bit of strength at the last moment.\nJerea’s sword, on the other hand, fell short: it pierced Balbaza’s armor, but that was it. It only managed to dig a little into the flesh connected to his heart, but it wasn’t enough to cause a fatal wound.\n“Ugh…….”\nSoo-ho looked away and Jae-hyuk shook his head.\nEveryone felt devastated at the defeat of the seemingly invincible Holy Knight.\n“I win.”\nBalbaza arrogantly declared his victory and tried to pull out his axe, but…….\n“Huh?”\nThe hilt of the axe was nowhere to be found. Just as he was about to forcefully retrieve it, Balbaza locked eyes with the old knight.\n“……?”\nJerea stares back at him, blood and dirt staining his face.\nA moment of death, a final spark? No, it was too much for that──\n“The Lady who presides over the end of all things.”\n-Poof.\n“Hear my voice.”\n“Huh?”\nAt the three swords digging into flesh Balbaza panicked.\n“Protect your knight.”\n‘How! He doesn’t have the strength to move anymore! I cut him in half. He should have died instantly…….’\n“Why…….”\n‘He’s still alive, isn’t he? How is he still alive when his body is cut in two?’\n“Death is with me.”\nHoly Law <Death Immunity>.\nThe most unlikely of miracles, the ability to resist death and keep breathing.\nJerea did not miss the moment of the great miracle that Fle bestowed upon her knight, who had defied death time and time again.\n-POOF!\nThe three swords pierce Balbaza’s heart and dig into his back and the pounding of his heart dies down.\nBalbaza’s life flame was finally extinguished, unable to understand why he had been defeated.\n“Huh…!”\nJerea looks like he’s about to collapse, but his knees don’t buckle. His soldiers cheer as he declares victory over Balbaza’s corpse…and the next champion approaches.\n“You let your guard down, fool.”\nA masked orc. Maghar, champion of Gokrok approached, keeping his distance from Jerea, carrying a twisted old-wood staff.\n“By the looks of you, you’re about to die. What do you say, do you want to give it one last spark?”\nWhile the aging of an orc could not be directly compared to that of a human, he was a shaman whose aging could be felt as much as Jerea’s.\nHe stepped forward as the second duelist but Jerea hesitated.\nThe moment his <Death Immunity> was released, he would truly die.\nShouldn’t he try to keep at least one more ally for the Lionheart King until the end?\nThe amount of blood spilled was already a lethal dose…Jerea’s knees were about to give out from the lack of blood supply…….\n“A fine fight, Sir Jerea.”\nGrabbing his arm, a knight in brilliant gold helps Jerea to his feet.\n“Your Majesty…….”\n“Rest now as this king will watch and bless your end.”\n“It…….”\nimpossible. His life will now be shorter than a burned-out candle.\n“Green beasts, I will give you your only chance at victory.”\nLeon drew his holy sword, deployed the holy spear and the Holy Grail floated up by his side.\n“All of you come at me at once.”\n“Ha…!”\nThe corner of their mouth twitched at the misguided declaration.\n“Arrogant.”\nSo did Skira, champion of the orc hunting god Skunik. A surge of blue aura spoke of his anger.\n“You think you can take on all of us alone, those of us who have been chosen by the gods?”\nDagil, the clan leader of the barbarians, also glared at Leon with a fierce gaze.\nAll of them felt that Leon had made a provocation that he could not withstand. It was the arrogant bluster of knights, they thought.\n“Hoo-hoo-hoo…….”\nBut only the corners of Jerea’s mouth twitched ferociously.\nIn the face of a declaration that most would call bluster and arrogance, he saw it differently.\n“Behold.”\nThe old knight’s gaze turned to the Lion King, who spread his arms wide.\n“The pinnacle of human power.”",

      "content": "Chapter 94: Holy Knight Jerea (5)\nEight hundred kilometers above the ground Yappy scrutinized the terrain below him, the movements of the creatures, everything.\n-Lionheart Kingdom border. So far, so good.\nEver since the encounter with the Red Knight, he hadn’t paid attention to their movements.\nEven in all the places Yappy knows of, they’ve remained stationary, as if under some sort of constraint.\nWithout knowing the conditions under which they operate, it is dangerous to make contact.\n-Multiple movements on Imperial borders.\nAs far as Yappy knows, the Empire is an uneasy ally of Lionheart.\nThe so-called “unbelievers” are thriving, but they are the same human forces and a handful of survivors of the Last War are said to have stood with Leon.\n-The Canyon Relic Convoys are traveling in sequence.\nTwo of the five relic convoys were cut off by orc pursuers but none of them had members of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild.\nBeatrice’s convoy is unharmed and even if it encounters pursuers, it should be able to crush them.\nThe problem is with Koo Dae-sung and Han Ha-ri since he orc pursuers are not targeting Beatrice or the others, but rather Han Ha-ri.\nPresumably, they’ve been prioritized, but that’s nothing to worry about.\n-Observation of an experienced Holy Law user. Suspected to be an analog of the Holy Knight who joined His Majesty.\nThey should be able to reach the Imperial border without incident.\nYappy’s observations now point to the far end of the gate and are heading toward the orc gathering.\nAfter Leon and Jerea’s unrestricted raiding, the main body of orcs who accepted the challenge have made it to the front of the canyon.\nGradually, new hordes descend from the north, where they were previously ‘unseen’.\n-Check the orc population. Increasing.\nOrcs and barbarians continue to push down from the unobservable area like black dots.\nThe sight of the ever-increasing number of orcs made Yappy feel compelled to drop his Earth-hacked satellite weapons like the Staff of God and Grizzly.\nHowever, the space weapon platform that operates inside the gate is still incomplete.\nYappy decided to observe the orcs in more detail than think of the offensive systems that were currently out of reach.\nAs the magnified lens watched the orcs that gradually emerged from the blackness… something flashed.\n-Kaaaaaah…!\nSomething rushed toward Yappy, and──\n-Evacuation sequence activated\nMoments after Yappy’s urgent ejection, the reconnaissance satellite was pierced by a green beam and destroyed.\nYappy’s fuselage burst into flames as it fell from 800 kilometers in the air.\n* * * *\nMaghar, champion of the Orc Shaman God, clicked his tongue at the arrogant knight before him.\nAll Holy Knights are mortal enemies to the Orcs, but the current Lionheart King is the worst of them all.\nThe number of orcs who have been buried by that terrible creature is well over a million.\nThe first thing he did when he took command of the Knights was to crush the orcs in the southern part of the kingdom that was actually his territory. In the province of Langquell, the orc seed has dried up.\n‘A stumbling block.’\nHe heard the rumors, albeit in different places, that there is an Orc Butcher in the lands to the south.\n“But you are arrogant and overconfident in your power.”\nMaghar stepped forward as a dull green aura began to fog around his rotting, old-wood staff.\n“I am the one who chants three hundred spells and eight hundred curses. King of the Snowfields. Lord of the Crater.”\nThe green energy dissolved into hundreds of curses as the wrath of this great shaman is directed at one man and the other Orc champions are not hiding their fury.\n“A beast of prey. You have too much faith in your teeth.”\n-Thud! Thud!\nIt was then. The floor shook as the orcs cried out.\n-Dothrak the Destroyer!\n-Dothrak the Destroyer!\nIt puffed ferociously and took grand strides.\nCrunch, crunch, crunch, its heavily armored body rumbles.\nDothrak, the great boar of the northern mountains was captured and tamed by a great hunter with the blessing of the orc hunting gods.\nSkira, champion of the orc hunting god Skunik, climbs onto Dothrak’s back.\n“White Tiger, your blessing…!”\nA barbarian tribe that worships the Four Great Beast Gods. The leader of Lionheart’s longtime enemies is protected by the ferocious White Tiger.\nHis physical form is enough to make you want to turn away.\nHis human body is enlarged, his fur grows in rakes, and he exudes ferocity.\nThis is why barbarians worship beast gods.\nThere is no code, no discipline. No long journeys, no tasks to complete.\nSimply give yourself to the beast, sacrifice others, and it will bless you.\nDespite this vicious pact, the foolish and ignorant are drawn to it, as the warriors of the beast gods leave their human bodies for the flesh of the grasslands to be able to gain power so simply, without effort or sacrifice.\nEven in the presence of horrific monsters empowered by evil gods, Leon was nonchalant.\n“It stinks.”\n“”……???””\nA word that strangely touched a nerve. Under their focused gaze, the blonde nobleman frowned.\n“An undignified odor. It belongs in a serf’s barn, not on the battlefield.”\nThe first to lunge is Dagil, his white fur fluttering.\nThe ground crunched under his spurs, his powerful body and speed a violence in itself.\nHe stretches out his arms, as though he could crush Leon with a single blow.\nDagil’s bleached arm is a vicious weapon in its own right. Its sharpness is enough to tear Leon limb from limb.\n“Iron.”\nIn an instant, Leon’s body is protected by the divinity of iron and blacksmithing. The oncoming Dagil’s arm swings, and it hits Leon squarely in the throat.\n-Boom!\nThe sound was too alien to be that of razor-sharp nails striking human flesh.\n“What….?”\nDagil’s fierce eyes widened in bewilderment as Leon’s throat, which should have been sliced open like a tofu, was… intact, without a single scratch.\n“One who represents the gods, one who worships them, one who reverently receives their teachings.”\nThe blue gaze turned to Dagil and he stumbled backward.\n“But you have sought ignorance for ignorance’s sake. The gods you follow teach you nothing, and the followers that follow them seek to learn nothing.”\nThe holy sword is raised and it glows with a brilliant golden halo.\n“You are a wretch. Your god is worthless. Your shallow faith is no match for ours.”\n‘I must stop him…!’\nDagil raised his steel claws and vicious nails that could shred rock.\n-Kwazik!\n“……!”\nThe barbarians’ eyes widened. Dagil, the tribe’s most powerful divine warrior, had been cleanly cut down… even though he had been completely beatified.\nAs if a sharp blade had cut through a piece of paper, Dagil’s nails were split and a straight line was cut from his crown to his groin.\n“You…!”\nMaghar, champion of Gokrok, extended his staff as countless curses formed and stretched toward Leon.\nEach one a venomous poison that takes a life or an evil curse that chokes the world.\n“He who is protected by the Grail, no plague shall trespass.”\nBehind Leon’s back, the Grail shimmered and produced holy water of its own, radiating a brilliant glow.\nThis spot, where the Grail sits, is holy ground. By the proclamation of the demigod, it shall drive out all that is evil.\n“Great…!”\nAs all of his curses melted away under the protection of the Grail, Maghar pointed his staff at Leon, who charged at him.\nDozens of orc spells rain down on him. Firepower enough to annihilate a legion, the destruction spells he had stockpiled to prevent the canyon from being destroyed and the entrance blocked.\n“……!”\nBut there is a lightning bolt that breaks through as most of the spells were deflected by the surge of resistance at the moment of the charge.\n“A spellcaster, what good is it to know all the spells in the world if they are so shallow?”\nMaghar tried to do something, but he could not envision a future where he would be able to escape that holy sword.\n“Shallow all-rounder crumble before the ultimate one.”\n-Boom!\nThe shaman’s bloody crest fell to the ground.\n“Waaaahhhh…!”\nA roar was heard as Skira, wielding a huge spear like a harpoon, charged with the giant boar Dothrak.\n“How dare you, you insolent thing, charge at this king!\nLeon called back Stallion and summoned a fire-breathing bull and the war chariot of the war god Petos.\n[Ultimate Charge]\n“Run…!”\n-Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh…!\n-Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh…!\nThe two bulls break into a ferocious gallop. The air is filled with the sound of their breathing and the heat they generate and the momentum makes the rest of the Northern Mountain Range tremble in fear.\n-Ew!\nFaced with the bull of Petos, Skira panicked and pulled on the reins as Dothrak stopped walking in fear but no matter what he did, Dothrak refused to listen to his commands.\nIn the next moment, the horns of the mighty war bull collided with Dothrak.\n-Boom!\nSkira’s seat shakes with the sound of popping meat and Lion leaps at him.\n“You…!”\nSkira raised his spear and pointed the doomed javelin at the charging Leon but the moment it collided with the holy spear…the javelin split.\n“……!”\nBefore he had a chance to do anything, Skira saw the holy spear pierce his torso.\n“”………….””\n“”………….””\nThe surrounding fell silent at the carnage that was not even a duel.\nHumans, orcs, and the others beyond recognize that the knight at the pinnacle of human history is here.\n* * * *\nHis immunity to death was fading.\nTechnically, he still has the power, but it’s more like he’s taken it from himself.\n“Are you going?”\n“Yes… I think I fought pretty well, but… Your Majesty is still amazing.”\nJerea was proud of Leon for his display of transcendent strength.\nTwo hundred years from now, when the world was finally destroyed and he fought alone in the midst of this tragedy, how strong had he become?\nHe was saddened by it, but also proud. How could he not be proud of his king… such a dazzling man.\n“I have the Grail. It will be with you, if need be, until the end of this world.”\nJerea shook his head in disbelief.\n“Your Majesty, do not dwell on the past. Do not waste your precious time. You have shown me how proud you are, and what more can I ask for?”\nWe were not wrong.\nThe gods were not wrong.\nThe young king before us… nay, the glorious Lionheart of the Eons to Come, would triumph in the end.\nLeon looked at his knight, so unselfish and loyal, and made a decision.\n“I will perform the rite of ascension. Receive.”\n“Your Majesty… the fight is not over yet…!”\nRite of Ascension is a religious ritual performed by the Lionheart King for Holy Knights who are mortally wounded and about to die.\nHis soul is taken by the Lionheart himself and led to Paradise but it takes a great deal of holy power, and Jerea didn’t want to burden Leon with it.\n“The orcs and barbarians have retreated. Unless you wish to pursue them, there will be no more fighting for you.”\n“But I have already…….”\nHe is a fake. His soul rests in the paradise of the gods, and he is but a reproduced memory. How can one such as him…….\n“Holy Knight Jerea Bertum, second son of Jordic Bertum, Knight Templar of the Order of the Riona Sunset. First knight in the service of Dreams and Death.”\nThe ascension ritual began without question as Jerea knelt before Leone, hastily drying his blood-soaked body.\n“Greet the lady.”\nIn response, Jerea prayed to the woman who had granted him the quest, the woman who had given him the opportunity.\n“You who lead from the lowest places. Lady who rules the ends of all things. Here your servant comes to the end of a long journey.”\n“I leave behind a dear friend, a proud comrade-in-arms, and a great king.”\n“All your life you have shunned vainness and falsehood, you have hated gold, you have defended and fed your subjects, my lady.”\n“If thou wilt bless my merits in this life, enlarge my royal domain; if thou wilt lead thy subjects, let my royal cares and tribulations be without.”\n“Do not make me poor, do not make me full, and protect my king with the merit that remains. Lighten the dark path of Vanya.”\nLeon filled the chalice with holy water and washed Jerea bloody head.\nIt cleansed and blessed him of all uncleanness.\n“Dreamer. Death’s protector. Your honor has made Lionheart prosper, and your glory has pleased the gods.”\n“Divinity of dreams and death, here is your first knight on his final journey.”\n“His honor shall be remembered by the living, and his glory by you.”\n“May this knight drink a cup of wine at your table. May his name remain for all eternity.”\n“I, the Fifteenth Lionheart, guardian of light and justice, horseman of war and flame, beacon of the sea and waves—the agent of all the gods, promise you that we will be together at the table of the gods.”\nThe Holy Grail brilliant light enveloped Jerea and he closed his eyes against the warmth that washed over him.\nStripped of his flesh, he shone like a purplish jewel, and──\nThe Holy Knight ascended.\n* * * * *\nThe home of tens of thousands of orcs.\nEven in the face of the unthinkable, the loss of three champions of the Orc God, their spirits remained steadfast.\n“Defeated.”\nHis tone was stern for an Orc, but his pupils, which glowed with a lingering rust-colored aura, were filled with rage.\nShame, embarrassment, and fear of the fury that the presence before him would unleash.\n“I apologize, sir. My apprentice wasn’t good enough.”\nAnother champion of the Orc Shaman God, Golgotha, the cunning warlock, bowed deeply.\nNow he would decide whether they would continue to sweep through those meager kingdom troops, or would follow tradition, admit defeat and retreat.\n“Retreat.”\nThe voice was calm and grave, but with an undisguised ferocity however his conclusion contradicted his voice.\n“I did what I was paid for. No more.”\nWith that, the Great Chief stood up from his throne.\nThe Great Chief who united fifty tribes and the champion blessed by all the orc gods seemed unwilling to take any more losses.\n“The Lionheart King.”\n-hhhhhhh…….\nHis voice was eerie.\n“When the stars align, we can have a fight.”\nBut now is not the time.\nHis agenda is to wrap this up and head to the other side of Lionheart.\nOnce he has circled the world, he will make his final conquest.",

      "content": "Chapter 95: Acolyte Jerea (1)\nThe Relic convoy continued southward, evading pursuit.\n“This way. From the tracks, it’s a road less traveled by monsters.”\n“That beast has a habit of calling out to the surrounding herd when attacked. But they also tend to be cautious in battle. Pass quietly.”\nJerea, an 87-year-old knight, may have been younger, but he was still a seasoned warrior.\nSince the attack of the chimeras, he’d managed to evade detection, hiding his scent and traveling off the beaten path.\nIt’s put them on a bit of a backtrack, but no one is complaining, and they even have time for small talk.\n“Wow~ So Lord Jerea knows about his majesty’s youth?”\nHa-ri’s eyes twinkled, expecting a story about Leon. As luck would have it, his second past alter ego had been with Leon during the orc extermination.\nShe was looking forward to hearing about Leon from Jerea, as well as the other knights and soldiers of the kingdom.\n“Fufu, the memories of those days are very strong, for his majesty was the youngest Holy Knight in the history of the kingdom, and his reputation was high.”\nThe rightful heir to the eponymous dragon-slaying Grand Duke of Dragonia, the Holy Knight set out on the path at the age of 16.\nWhile it is customary to serve the kingdom as a Kingdom Knight before taking the path, Leon was the rightful heir to the Archduke.\nHe went straight to the Path, even if it meant jumping through a few hoops, and has done nothing to shame the Archduke.\nHe single-handedly destroyed a band of orcs and broke into the evil rituals of a society and slashed them to death.\nHe adventured with Sir Gildus, who would later become Commander of the Kingdom’s Knights Templar, Sir Anton, guardian of the Stardust Mines, and Gunnar the Treeman, who became known as the Sage of the Forest.\nAt the age of only 20, he was chosen by Arianna, the goddess of light and justice, and given a quest.\n“He overcame the temptation of the Sobbing Woman, the sea monster of Langquell, and slit her throat; he punished the wicked witch with a trial; and in the end, he fulfilled his quest by defeating an Orc Warlord, who united the three tribes, with a single blow.”\nAt the age of 27 he became the youngest Holy Knight.\nHis skills with the Legion were then tested, and he finally slit the throat of Gunkar, the chieftain of Nine Orc Allied Tribes, and the champion of the Orc God Helkan.\nAt the age of 35, he was crowned the 15th Lionheart King, succeeding the late King, after defeating the Demon King summoned by warlocks from the fringes of the empire, and his glory and honor were unparalleled in the history of the realm.\n“What a dazzling man. There will never be another with such great talent and such a great vessel, and it was an honor to fight alongside him.”\nJerea smiled kindly at Ha-ri, chosen by the God of the Sea and the Waves and the God of War and Flame.\n“You will be at the King’s side, Lord Han Ha-ri, watching and learning from him. For no mortal has ever been so beloved by the gods as he is.”\n“Yes, sir!”\nHa-ri acknowledged Jerea’s talent as they escorted the holy relic.\nIndeed, this much growth at such a young age and to be taught by Leon and the gods themselves.\n“…….”\nBut Han Ha-ri and Koo Dae-sung’s reactions to the story were different.\nHa-ri admired it and wanted to be like him, and Koo Dae-sung dreamed of it, but knew it was impossible.\nAfter all, it’s a realm of elusive talent that doesn’t apply to them.\n* * * * *\nIt’s late at night, a time when the holy relic convoys must be on their guard to avoid enemy pursuit.\nAlthough Jerea has created a safety net of scent blocking, sound blocking, and cloaking, the convoy has decided to minimize the risk by standing guard.\n“Hmph…! Whoops!”\nIt was Koo Dae-sung’s turn and he was spending his boring sentry time swinging his sword at a hidden cave entrance in the canyon.\n“Whoops…….”\nEver since he enlisted in the Ten Thousand Gods Guild, he had been steadily repeating his training.\nAfter just over an hour sweat drips from his body like rain.\n“Kingdom Sword Technique.”\nThe voice came from a white-bearded old knight.\n“Did I wake you up…….?”\n“No. At my age, I’m losing sleep. I thought I’d help with the guard.”\nJerea stood in front of him instead of sitting at the campfire.\n“Your posture is a little off. Your arms shouldn’t be below your navel.”\nKoo Dae-Sung followed the advice and raised his sword while Jerea’s drawn blade struck the top of his sword, causing it to buckle.\n“The sword is not only your weapon of choice, but also your fastest armor. Always keep it in a position to respond.”\nJerea’s sword sliced into the hollow where it had fallen and Koo Dae-sung, who was forced to give up his neck in an instant, marveled.\n“I’ll take it.”\nBefore he can finish his sentence, Jerea’s sword slashes at the nape of his neck.\n-Crack!\n“Ugh…!”\nIt was quick and he wouldn’t have been able to block it if he hadn’t been so out of the way. Even so, his arm trembles from the numbing impact.\n-Kang! Bang!\nInterruption at the top, break at the top again then a slash with a break.\nJerea’s swordsmanship was a model of old-school precision.\nIt’s an obviously mechanical move, fast and precise, with no counterattack.\n“Ugh…!”\nHis twitching wrist managed to miss the blade but Jerea didn’t bother swinging his sword any further.\n“Good basics, not bad reactions. You’ve been training really well.”\n“……It’s not much.”\nKoo Dae-sung felt awkward at the compliment.\n“But… I don’t think it’s working. I’m not good enough.”\n“Hmm?”\n“Ms. Han Ha-ri… No, how about if you compare me to Lord Han Ha-ri.”\n“There’s a big difference. Lord Han Ha-ri has a talent that even an old man can see, and a temper that is loved by the gods.”\nI see.\nThe youngest Class A Hunter and a genius who was chosen by both the god of sea and the god of war.\nHer dazzling talent will eventually lead her to his goal and she will be rewarded for her efforts. She may even become a Holy Knight.\nKnowing the obviously insurmountable talent gap, Dae-sung couldn’t hide his frustration.\nAt most, he had risen from Class D to Class C in ten years. However, there were still many skies above him.\n“Actually… I knew. There are some things you shouldn’t strive for.”\nWhat’s the point in continuing to strive for something you don’t even believe in? What does it mean to be praised for trying as hard as you can?\nIsn’t it just a waste of effort and a drain on your life?\n“You’re like me.”\n“You mean me?”\nKoo Dae-sung swallowed the words, “Me.” The other person is a knight, a genius who strived to become a Holy Knight and eventually managed to become one.\nHow could he be anything like him?\nBut the old knight’s gaze was different.\n“I was never really a knight. My brother was more talented.”\nNormally, it is the eldest son who becomes the lord of a family. Unless he’s a genius with unparalleled talent, the eldest son has no choice but to prioritize following in his family’s footsteps.\nAs the second son, he traveled the road of wandering to become a knight.\n“The future me has accomplished the quest of a goddess,” he said, “but what a strange and wonderful thing it is to the present me.”\nJerea was an ordinary knight. In fact, he was one of the lowest ranked knights in the kingdom.\nYet he traveled endlessly, sometimes slaying orcs, sometimes slaying barbarians, sometimes hunting monsters.\nSometimes he succeeded, but more often he failed, and no one thought he had what it took to become a Holy Knight.\nRather, they mocked him as foolish for still wandering the path at such a young age.\n“In those days I heard many things: my family, my peers, even the king and the woman who appeared in my dreams told me to give up.”\nJerea counted himself fortunate to have people around him who offered heartfelt advice to a man who was so obviously wasting his time so foolishly.\n“But why… why didn’t you give up?”\n“Because I don’t need anyone’s judgment to challenge me.”\nEveryone told him he had an impossible dream.\n“Impossible.”\nKnight Jerea, 87, was adamant, regardless of his future accomplishments.\n“I don’t see any reason why that should be excluded from the challenge.”\nThat was the attitude of Jerea, and no matter what period of his life he was in, he lived by it.\nThat’s the kind of man he is, and he accomplished the quest and became a Holy Knight.\n“…….”\nEven after hearing about the great journey, Koo Dae-sung couldn’t relate to it.\nAfter all, he had a talent that no one else had.\nThat’s why he was able to challenge himself, and that’s why he was able to succeed.\nJerea knew what Dae-sung felt, for the old knight had looked him in the eye time and time again.\n“Young knight. Do you know courage?”\n“Courage…what do you mean?”\n“Or valor.”\n“Or love.”\n“Or hope.”\nThe old knight smiled.\n“A knight is a dragon slayer. It is roaring valor, unquenchable hope, and pure love.”\n“The Holy Knight is the culmination of those qualities, a symbol of courage.”\n“Do you think a Holy Knight has courage?”\n“Of course…….”\nLooking at the knights of this kingdom, he thought to himself that they are truly valiant knights. Convicted and just, none of them are better than the next.\nIf they don’t have courage, then who does?\n“No, no. No one is born courageous from the beginning. It is not something that can be possessed, not something that is given, not something that can be earned.”\nJerea swallowed hard for a moment, then spoke with a firm gaze.\n“Courage is something that is unleashed.”\nThe words made Dae-sung feel his heart flutter but he still couldn’t understand Jerea’s words.\nHowever his words strangely stirred his heart.\n“Young knight. When you pray do you think the gods will grant you courage? Or… will they give you the opportunity to unleash your courage?”\n* * * * *\nThe convoy of holy relics, having lost their pursuers, approached the canyon’s exit.\n“Lord Jerea, look!”\nThey saw an Imperial guard post used to keep the monsters of the canyon from escaping.\nIt was a straight line from here to the Kingdom’s border.\n‘So it’s right on the Imperial border. I heard Lionheart used to do a lot of barbarian raids here.’\nThe Lionheart had no interest in this barren land, only periodic raids against barbarians and punishment for sociopaths.\nApparently, it was only the Empire’s arrival decades ago that led to the expansion of its territory here.\n‘Huh?’\nDae-Sung checked the system message once more.\n[Assist Lord Jerea of Twilight in escorting the holy relic to the Lionheart border]\n-Side Mission: Defend Sir Jerea’s main body to the end.\nThe side mission, “Defend Sir Jerea main body,” is probably being completed by others.\nThe problem is that the main quest, Escorting the Holy Relic to the Lionheart Border.\n‘Why the Lionheart border? Shouldn’t the convoy quest already be over by the time we get to the Empire?’\n“Stop!”\nIt was then that a booming voice interrupted Koo Dae-sung’s thoughts. The voice came from an Imperial guard post.\n“Who are you?”\n“We are a convoy of holy relics from the Lionheart Kingdom! We have passed through here before!”\nStella, the leader of the convoy, shouted, and soon the guardhouse opened, revealing a group of Imperials approaching them.\n“Good to see you, Knights of Lionheart.”\nIt was a burly old man. He looked to be at least seventy, if not older than Jerea. But in this world, apparent age is not the same as on Earth, so one cannot be too sure.\nHe wore a fine cloak and carried a cane, but it was the ornate circlet that crowned his forehead that gave him away.\nBut that’s not all. Behind the old man’s back were two more men in similarly colorful red and green cloaks, their status in no way inferior to the old man’s.\n“King Law, head of the Light Mage School… Lord Wolfhard, division commander of the Imperial Guard… and even Dean Staudt of the Celestial Observatory…….”\nJerea couldn’t hide his dismay at the list of unexpected titans.\n“Why are you here?”\nThe Imperial Prefects, the heads of thirteen families, each of which constitutes an empire. Even the Emperor of the Empire is chosen from these thirteen families.\nSome are great warriors, some are great wizards, and some are great sorcerers, and they are given the treasures of the Empire and inherit the power of the Founding Fathers.\nIn other words, they are the thirteen most powerful men in the empire.\nThe elderly man called the Law King glanced at Jerea and realized his identity.\n“Ah, Sir Jerea of the Holy Knights, Twilight. No, you’re younger. You’re his alter ego.”\nIt was then that a cloud of dust rose at the back of the convoy: the orcs and barbarians he’d thought he’d shunned… and the chimeras.\n“Welcome to the land of the Empire.”\nLaw King opened his arms, not caring about the monsters coming from the depths of the canyon.\n“And farewell.”\nThe next moment, a beam of light shot from his fingertips and pierced Jerea’s chest.",

      "content": "Chapter 96: Acolyte Jerea (2)\nAlmost simultaneously, the convoy reacted.\n“Light…!”\nOne of the knights shouted, his sword drawn and pointed at the surprise attackers.\n“Not a chance.”\nAs Law King who had attacked Jerea stretched out his hand the knight was caught in a glowing net and thrown to the ground.\nIn response, Stella unleashed her flames.\nHoly Law <Barrier of Fire>\nA barrier of fire, erected to keep enemy mages at bay. However, the chanting from beyond caused a rift to form, and──\nThe fire spell raised by Kingdom Knight Stella was scattered like a flash of light.\n“What…!”\nThe Holy Law has been dismantled? Stella panicked. However, Law King only smiles smugly.\n“Unless you’re a Holy Knight or a Priest, your use of the Holy Law is not ‘bending the law’. We’ve been studying your methods for a very long time.”\n“To probe the miracles of the gods…blasphemy!”\nStella indignantly protests, but the Law King only scoffs at the notion.\n“That is why you fanatics are foolish. You don’t progress because you cling to the old, to faith, to divinity. People like you rule the world, and that’s why human progress is slow.”\n“You… divine independents!”\nStella was outraged by the heresy before her.\nDivine Independents denied the miracles of the gods, rejected their teachings and codes, and valued human progress on its own terms.\nShe’d heard that such people were especially common in the Empire, not the Chosen Kingdom, but she’d never thought that Law King would be one of them!\n“No way… did you create those horrible beasts too!”\nThe peculiar chimeras that swooped and chased the holy relic convoy were at first thought to be the work of the beast gods or some bizarre spell of the orcs, but when you think about it, they were far too functional.\n“Pretty good, isn’t it? A collaboration between the Life and Death schools.”\nThe Law King confessing that the horrible blasphemous monster was their handiwork made Stella’s face contort with rage.\n“In the name of the Goddess, I will never forgive you──!”\nIt was then that a sharp flash came from behind Stella’s back.\n“Lord Stella!”\nWith a crack, the harpoon pierced Stella’s shoulder and popped out. The flesh-cutting thing didn’t come out easily, and Stella was dragged away by the harpooner’s hand.\n“These beasts…!”\nA fellow knight cut the harpoon’s cord and rescued her, but it was too late to staunch the gushing blood.\nOrc hunters…and servants of the Beast Gods… Ahead, Imperial troops, one of them an Archmage, surrounded the convoy.\nAs if they were one in the same.\n“Ugh… what the hell?!”\nHa-ri could not hide her bewilderment at the chaotic situation on the battlefield, even as she prepared to deploy the Holy Law at any moment. Koo Dae-sung, on the other hand, was stunned that his suspicions had been confirmed.\n“From the beginning… the Empire and the orcs were on the same side… the Empire was behind this whole thing!”\nWith those words, the knights and riders were forced to recognize something they didn’t want to admit.\nThe orcs and barbarians had joined hands with the Empire. No, the Empire was behind it.\nBut why?\nWhy had they joined forces with the green beasts, the enemies of mankind, they didn’t have to ask.\n“The holy relics…these scums would target the holy relics the gods have bestowed upon the kingdom!”\n“Know thy enemy, know thyself, and thou shall prevail. The relic will help us decipher the gods.”\nSince the relic was discovered in the barbarian lands, the Empire has limited the size of Lionheart’s search party.\nA single Holy Knight and a group of only five hundred men for the important task of searching for the Relic and escorting it back to the Kingdom.\nSince the task of searching for and transporting the Relic requires crossing the Empire’s borders, Lionheart has been forced to reduce the size of its search party.\nAnd it was a conspiracy involving the Empire… or at least three of its Prefects.\nLet them find the Relic, use barbarians and orcs to follow them, and then have the Prefects and the Empire attack the convoy without the Holy Knight and take the Relic.\nSuch was the calculation in the Empire’s mind.\n“Why, the world is made up of the favor and grace of the gods, even if you are indulgent! Is this such a grave matter that you would attack your own kind!”\n“Kind? Did you say kind?”\nIt was Wolfhard, the Imperial Prefect and division commander of the Imperial Guard, who was outraged by the words.\n“You arrogant bastards, have you forgotten the atrocities you committed sixty years ago?”\nThe reason for the recent estrangement between the Empire and the Kingdom lay in a tragedy on the fringes of the Empire sixty years ago.\nWarlocks summoned a Demon King and in the wake of this tragedy on the fringes of the Empire, the kingdom immediately launched the Night War.\nA massive call to arms that must be answered by the provinces in which it was issued, no matter what duties they were performing, even if they were on a divine quest.\nMany knights answered the call, including Leon, who was currently crushing the orcs in Wrangell.\nThe Prefects of the Empire were reluctant to accept the salvation of foreign troops, but they had no choice but to accept them, for they were both heresy-hunting spiritualists and paroxysmal fanatics of the devil.\nEventually, the knights succeeded in destroying the Demon King with the death of the king, Argent Majesty Lionheart, but the trouble came later.\n“I was a knight of the Guard in those days,” he said, “and I saw your atrocities firsthand.”\nWolfhard still remembered the tragedy.\nThe warlocks who had summoned the Demon King… the Holy Knights who had been summoned to the Night War had turned their heads when it was revealed that it was one of their own.\nTo save his life, the Prelate sent two of his local Imperial Legions to stop them, with disastrous results.\nThere were seven terrible Holy Knights in a single legion.\nThe two Imperial legions were overrun in a single day, and the Prefect was dragged by the hair and burned alive by the current Lionheart King, Leon.\n“His Majesty’s actions were perfectly justified, how could he spare a demonic follower!”\n“You have disregarded the laws and prestige of the Empire, and willingly trampled on allies in your quest for justice.”\nOf course, this was not without incident.\nEach and every one of the Knights of the Lionheart is an Inquisitor.\nThey wander across the continent, seeking justice and spreading the righteousness of the faith.\nIt is not uncommon for them to punish corrupt foreign officials, barbarians, and citizens along the way.\nWhat they didn’t expect was for their swords to be pointed at the pinnacle of imperial power, the Emperor himself.\nLionheart’s ruthless hunt for heretics has left the Imperial Prefects feeling very vulnerable.\nThey wanted to have the power to stand up to these crazed fanatics who would kill anyone, prefect or emperor.\n“We will interpret the holy relics and analyze the power of the gods. That is what we seek.”\nTo do this, they would work with barbarians and orcs alike. The Imperial Prefect reached out as imperial troops and orc pursuers, beast gods and chimeras were ready to attack.\nThe disparity in power was obvious but the Prefects knew it, and they were proud of it.\n“By the way, do you know why we’ve been so kind to explain things to you?”\nLaw King twisted the corners of his mouth wryly.\n“Because unlike the dogs of the gods, magic that is purely human power takes a while to cast.”\nThe next moment, behind Law King and Wolfhard, the Archmage, who had remained silent until now, unleashed a massive burst of magic.\nThe entire area began to shake as the light from the staff of Dean Staudt, the head of the Imperial School of Celestial Observation, scattered in all directions.\nHe was one of the best archmages in the Empire, who senses the movements of the heavenly bodies and changes in the climate, among other things.\nHe rejected the Order of Ultima, the god of the sky and thunder, and sought to manipulate the phenomenon of climate using only human power, and his magic began to defy the laws of nature.\n<Spell Enhancement>, <Double Activation>, <Rise in Rank>, <Triple Enhancement>, <Enlarged Area of Effect>.\nIt was a series of spells that were mere precursors to the real thing, comparable to some of the most devastating spells, but Staudt had managed to weave them all together and compute them into one.\n“In my hands I hold the reason of the heavens.”\nGreat Magic <Weather Manipulation>\n-Kaah!\nFirst, the clouds churn.\nThe dry sky transforms into dark clouds, exploding and expanding, amplified by magic, into a massive thundercloud that shakes the heavens and earth.\n“Damn it…charge!”\nThe knights who have witnessed this are horrified and begin to charge at the Imperials, but Law King does not allow them to approach.\n<Rise in Rank>, <Enlarge Area of Effect>, <Exceed Spell Limit>──\nArchmagic <Richard’s Net>\nA massive web of light engulfs the convoy. Their charge was halted and they were pinned down. In the next moment, Koo Dae-sung saw the thunderclouds in the sky churning──\nMega Magic <Lamantha’s Thunderbolt>\nA bolt of lightning struck down over their heads.\n* * * * *\nWhen asked to name the most powerful magic of the four major elemental schools, every mage in the Empire would point to the Celestial School.\nThe casting time, the time it takes to activate, the speed beyond human perception, the unstoppable destructive power of thunder.\n“Ohhhh….”\n“It’s the Archmage…!”\nThe light poured into the thundercloud, destroying the ground and illuminating the world.\nEven with such a powerful force in front of them, everyone can’t help but be mesmerized.\nA moment of human praise, accomplished not with the help of the gods, but with human power alone.\nIt was enough to enrage those who claimed independence from the divine.\nBehold, this is human power.\nThe power of Mother Nature, limited as it is, can be twisted and manipulated by human hands to create transmigration.\nMan’s power to replace God. No wonder they grew arrogant.\nBut──\n“…….”\nStaudt was puzzled that the power of the magic was weaker than he had expected. Normally, a thunderbolt would have destroyed the ground and raised a thick cloud of dust.\nBut what he saw before him was more of a ‘mist’ than dust.\n“Hooo…….”\nThe knights of the kingdom soon appeared. They could see that something had blocked the thunderbolt.\n“Whoa, we’re in trouble.”\nThe heavy seawater spread out over the knights’ heads. It blocked the thunderbolt.\n“A priest…no, not quite.”\nCertainly a holy law user of a level beyond that of a kingdom knight.\nHa-ri unleashed a vortex of fire with her blade and the divine flames swooped down on the warriors like waves.\nWith the blessing of two gods, the divine maiden’s holy sword swung with such ferocity that it threatened to overwhelm the imperial army.\nAt the same time, Law King unleashed his magical baptism.\n<Triple Activation>, <Spell Enhancement>, <Dispersal>, <Targeting>────<HYPER ELEMENTAL BREAK>\nThe vortex of fire is disintegrated by the Law King’s hand. However, he was only able to disintegrate one of the two attributes.\nThe ‘vortex’ of the ‘flame’ dissolves, and the flames scatter, raining down on him.\n“Hmph…Dual Laws.”\nEven though the Holy Law of the Vortex was gone, the Divine Flame was a powerful Holy Law in its own right. It could incinerate an archmage or anything else.\n“The power to defy nature is not just yours.”\nThe next moment, Law King’s circlet glowed.\nPure Concept <Barrier>.\n“Huh?”\nHa-ri was baffled by the sparks that immediately dispersed upon contact with the barrier. Conceptual power woven into the Holy Law was so easily dispersed?\nHa-ri, who had always thought of the Holy Law as an invincible force, could only be baffled.\n“Stay away.”\nThe Prefects did not miss Ha-ri’s moment of panic as Staudt manipulated the thunderclouds still echoing in the sky, and thunderbolts fell in quick succession.\n“Ugh…!”\nHa-ri quickly materialized what a thick barrier of water that blocked any electric current.\n-Clang!\n-Thud!\nA powerful thunderbolt pounded against the water barrier in midair. The sound was dizzying just by looking at it.\n“Ugh…! The power…!\nHa-ri sensed that her barrier was gradually dispersing. Unlike the Holy Knights, who represented the power of the gods, Ha-ri could only borrow the power of the gods.\nThe incomplete Holy Law was gradually evaporated, scattered, and poured out by the successive thunderbolts.\nAnd finally, just as a hole opens up in the water barrier, and the thunderbolts are about to fall towards it──\nGreat Magic <Super Elemental Cancel>\nAt that moment, the thunderbolt that was about to fall disappeared into thin air.\n“What…?!”\nFor the first time, the Prefects expressions cracked. Their overwhelmingly favorable calculations had been upset, and a variable had appeared.\n“Who is it…?”\nTheir gazes turn to the center of the magic wave. Above the canyon, a giant black eagle that must’ve been under the control of a beast god was carrying a woman with a strange aura.\n“I came here because I thought you might be in danger… but you’re not far off.”\nThe one who severed the connection between the gods and the servants and made them obey her absolutely.\nThe one who made the preemptive strike of the Archmage disappear like a bubble.\nMost of all, the deadly colors that shone through her cotton cloak.\n“Greetings, gentlemen.”\nThe Magician Queen of the Kingdom of Spero.\nBeatrice Alighieri Spero.\nThe most powerful archmage of this century smiled bewitchingly at the Imperial army.",

      "content": "Chapter 97: Acolyte Jerea (3)\nThe sudden appearance of a third party made the prefects wary.\n‘That is… the power of the black eagle.’\n‘How can a beast spirit follow a human?’\n‘It doesn’t follow the woman. It is being controlled. You mean to tell me that the power of the gods has been corrupted?’\nEven if they are lowly beasts, their connection to the gods is not something to be taken lightly.\nBut how is it possible for a mere mortal to do so?\nHowever that question was answered when she put away her cotton sack.\nThe high bridge of her nose, her slender face, and her slightly parted lips reveal a faint smile, strongly flavored with the colors of womanhood.\nThere’s something about the way she carries herself and the bewitching look in her eyes that’s not just mesmerizing… it’s corrupting.\n“What the…!”\nRealizing the true nature of her power, the prefects each cast a mental barrier spell.\n<Nullify Mental Interference>\n<Mind Power Double>\nThe creatures of the land could barely escape it after the successive mental strengthening and interference-blocking spells were cast. Even the Lionheart Relic convoy and…the chimeras.\n“How rude. To have the power to seduce men like a courtesan. You have no pride as a mage.”\nEven as he spoke, a cold sweat broke out on his spine and his pores glistened.\nDespite all the mental barriers he wore, the soldiers were almost mesmerized by her magic. If even the soldiers were as mesmerized as that black eagle, they’d be in trouble.\nIt has a curse-like power that corrupts men…nay, life.\n“I apologize for that, but it’s in my blood.”\n“Hmm…!”\nThe wizards didn’t believe her. This much magic, this much corrupting power. It could almost be called a ‘magical phenomenon’, and it was possible to do it just by looking good?\nIf there is such a thing, isn’t it a magic power that the evils of pleasure and corruption covet?\n‘But before that…her abilities as a mage are not ordinary.’\nThe spell that nullified Dean Staudt’s Thunderbolt of Lamantha.\nMagic beyond High Elemental Destruction, which dissolves even the most mundane laws of the land, is astonishing even to the archmages themselves.\n“By the way… That chimera was made by mages after all, wasn’t it? It was so crude that I suspected it was an orc.”\n“Crude?”\nFor a moment, the hot-headed Law King frowned.\nThe use of the word “crude” in reference to a chimera, the crown jewel of the Imperial mages’ biotechnology, was a point of contention.\nBut even under that intense stare, Beatrice smiled.\n“Yes, overly promiscuous and…undignified. That’s the kind of thing you’d use to torture demons.”\n“Ha…! A wizard so obsessed with appearances.”\n“I am royalty, after all.”\nBeatrice glanced at the chimeras and the orcs at the rear of the convoy.\n‘Poor beasts, composites of all manner of creatures.’\nBeatrice frowned at their grotesque appearance and unfortunate fate.\n“To have to use such lowly beasts… it speaks volumes about the quality of the magicians of this world.”\nShe gestured and suddenly, a dark purplish aura poured toward the chimeras.\n-Kuik?\nIn an instant, a cloud of mist enveloped them. Smelling the smoke, the chimeras dropped their heads groggily, then lifted them with bleary eyes.\nThe orcs instinctively sensed danger.\n“Kill them──!”\nTheir instincts were spot on as the chimeras began to pounce on the orcs.\n“Chit…did you notice.”\nLaw King clicked his tongue as he watched.\nChimeras are certainly capable of great physical prowess, but they lack intelligence and antimagic powers. They are especially vulnerable to powers like mind control.\n“You’ve revealed your hand. The Cult of Dreams and Death…no, the High Priestess.”\n“Kingdom bastards. I thought they only sent one Holy Knight, but I can’t believe they have a saint hidden away.”\n“That’s odd. The High Priestess of the Great Fle was supposed to be a man, but she’s not on the Intelligence Ministry’s list of important people.”\nHa-ri’s presence alone was a surprise, but they hadn’t expected a High Priestess.\nHowever the Imperial prefects still had time. There was only one opponent against two archmages and a knight of the highest rank, Division Commander Wolfhard.\nAgainst three of the Empire’s strongest forces the addition of a mere cleric would make no difference.\n“It would have been better to take them by surprise.”\n<Ignition>, <Flame>──<Fireball>\nA giant fireball thrown by the Law King hurtled toward Beatrice but Beatrice pulled on the reins of the black eagle and performed an evasive maneuver.\nThe speed of the fireball was considerable, but not enough to match the maneuverability of the flying beast.\n“Hmph…!”\n<Speed Up>, <Movement Guidance>, <Auto Track>, <Magical Shape Change>── Burning Gaze\nAt that moment, the fireball changed form and began to dart through the air like a slender beam of light. Its speed far exceeded that of a black eagle.\nIn response, Beatrice pointed her delicate fingers towards the Burning Gaze.\n<Hexa Shield>\nA transparent Hexa Shield is deployed by Beatrice to block the Burning Gaze. The fierce flames pummeled the shield, but her defensive magic remained steadfast.\n“You’ve stopped it.”\nAt that moment, Dean Staudt unleashed his magic as the thunderclouds, still darkening the sky, were about to unleash a torrent of lightning.\nAlmost simultaneously, Law King binding magic struck the black eagle.\n“Hmph?”\nHe cast a binding spell on the black eagle and in the next moment, the lightning bolts of Dean Staudt struck.\nMega magic <Lamantha’s Thunderbolt>\nGreat Magic <Super Elemental Cancellation>\nOnce again, Beatrice nullifies the thunderbolt but the attack doesn’t end there.\nLaw King and Dean Stout both unleash their magic at the same time as great flames, beams of light, thunderbolts, and chunks of rock pummel Beatrice from all sides.\nThe two archmages unleashed spell after spell in a frenzy but Beatrice merely deployed them with a relaxed expression on her face.\nHer Hexa Shields block the physical attacks, and she neutralizes the lightning bolts that fall from the sky or deflects them with her Lightning Rod spell.\nIt’s clear they’re on the offensive, but they’re the ones who seem to be at a disadvantage as time goes on.\n‘What kind of ridiculous magic is this?’\n‘I can’t believe she’s single-handedly blocking both of our attacks!’\nAs they panicked, Beatrice started speaking.\n“Holy Law is the power to enforce concepts. It’s a manipulation of phenomena born of faith. Clearly, magic is an inferior skill to Holy Law.”\n“You bitch…! How dare you say such a thing as a proud mage?”\n“Magic is in no way inferior to the Holy Law!”\nThat was the mantra of the mages of this world.\nThey had every right to be resentful.\nThis power, so emblematic of the wise, was no better than the holy laws used by the ragtag peasants of the streets, simply because they believed in God.\nThey could mix a rainy season with a dry sky and drop lightning bolts.\nThey could start fires with little oxygen, and they could nourish the parched earth to make crops grow.\nBut the followers of the faith that pervaded the land were different.\nThey could call down thunderbolts, start fires, make crops grow, and heal the sick by simply wishing just by wishing, just by believing.\nEven the most mundane of things benefit from miracles.\nHow can one not be impressed?\nPower and knowledge symbolize a person’s worth.\nIt is natural for the wise to lead society, to control knowledge and its benefits, so why should their power be compared to the lesser things.\nIt is most disgraceful and unreasonable that those ignorant fanatics should be at the top of their own heads.\nIt was only natural for so many mages to cry out for independence from the divine.\n“That sounds like a lot of hard work.”\nBeatrice was about to say something when she realized the reason behind her opponent’s furious reaction.\nCertainly, the power of the Holy Law was quite unreasonable from her perspective as a magician.\nBut──\n“Magic… no, the magic in this world, it’s no different from magic in my world, after all…I don’t understand how you use it so ‘casually’.”\n“What?”\nIf holy law was the power to bend the law, magic is the power to defy the laws\nIt uses the fifth element, magic, to create fire where there is none, to create waves in a calm sea, to manipulate particles to shoot beams of light.\nIn other words, it’s an art that can do anything with theory and imagination.\n“You’re so obsessed with magic that you’re blind to the possibilities of non-magic. As far as I’m concerned, you’re the ones who don’t understand.”\nThe next moment, Beatrice stretched her hands out wide.\n<Magic Circulation>\nAll the magic that had been unleashed, all the nullifying and defensive spells that had been deployed to stop it and the scattered energies are concentrated and recycled into one place.\nThe concentrated power was so great that even the archmages were aghast. That much power, that much compressed power… it radiated through her pure white fingers.\n<Death Eye>\nLaw King used his power.\nPure Concept <Barrier>\nA miraculous power comparable to the holy laws passed down to the preceding generations.\nThis miraculous power, which the Archmages had tried and failed to produce for so long, kept Beatrice’s terrifying attack at bay.\n“It’s nothing compared to His Majesty’s Holy Law defense, but…if I can’t pierce it, I can bypass it.”\nThe black clouds of thunder began to pulsate with golden color and Dean Staudt was stunned.\n“You can’t be using my magic…!”\nShe utilized a phenomenon created by an opponent as her own.\nAs proof, the thunderclouds, which had flashed with intermittent crackles of lightning, were transformed into golden colors by the endless bolts of lightning.\n<Brightening Heavenly Beetle>\nRing, space. Strike, thunderbolt.\nBlossom, flowers of light.\nPour down the storms. Despite all the defensive magic and pure concepts deployed by the prefects, the power of natural disasters cannot be stopped by blocking only one side.\nIt was a terrible, terrible destruction.\nOverwhelming destruction overtook the two archmages and the Imperial army.\n* * * * *\nBeatrice had limited the scope of her bombardment, not wanting to injure the holy convoy.\nHowever, even the Holy Convoy could not help but grow weary in front of her, whose power and scale were beyond the comprehension of even the Holy Knights.\n“Off…….”\nJerea, who had been killed by the Law King’s surprise, had become younger than before, now looking more like a middle-aged man than an old man.\nOpening his eyes, he immediately assessed the situation. His alter ego already knew that he was his past self and that he was currently on a mission to escort a holy object.\nThe information he needed from his ‘main body’ had been sufficiently implanted.\n“It seems the Empire has betrayed us.”\n“We were escorting a holy relic, and we were in danger of having it stolen by an Imperial conspiracy.”\nKingdom Knight Stella approached, her wounded shoulder healed. She quickly explained the situation, and Jerea was convinced.\n“But I don’t think you need to worry, whoever she is, she’ll defeat those self-indulgent Imperials.”\nNo one disputed the words since Beatrice was completely overwhelming the Imperials.\n[Hear that?]\nIt was then that message reached Jerea and the rest of the holy convoy.\n“The Queen?!”\nHa-ri answered the voice in her head, startled as a chuckle sounded from beyond.\n[Miss Ha-ri, and the rest of the convoy, call for reinforcements now]\n“What? You’re totally winning…….right now.”\nAs of now, Beatrice was single-handedly overwhelming the Imperials and the three prefects but she had other ideas.\n[I can sense a strange strength from their warriors. If we go into a long battle, I won’t be able to handle it alone]\n“I see.”\nIt was Jerea who replied, seemingly understanding Beatrice’s message.\n“Lady of Dreams and Death, I will do as you command.”\nStella said.\n“Lord Jerea, do you intend to return to the canyon?”\n“No, it is too far and I don’t know what’s going on over there.”\n“Then…….”\nAt that moment, Koo Dae-sung, who was double-checking the system messages, shouted.\n“The kingdom’s borders…! If we get there, something will happen, won’t it?”\nDespite his words, Koo Dae-sung was certain.\nThe main quest of this gate was to escort the holy relic convoy to the kingdom’s border.\nThe quest to defend Lord Jerea’s main body had already been accomplished. In other words, someone…whether it was Yappy or Leon, had cleared it.\nIn other words, if they succeed in this main quest, they would fulfill the requirements to clear the gate.\n“But how do we get through them to the Kingdom?”\n“I’ll find a way!”\nHa-ri stepped forward. She was the goddess of Poma and Petos and her firepower was unrivaled here.\n“Very well. Lord Stella, get the convoy under control. I do not have much time left.”\n“What? What?”\n“Get them ready.”\nJerea cleared his throat and raised his lance then turned his horse’s head toward the Imperials, who were still reeling from Beatrice’s magical bombardment.\n“If we can only reach the border…He will be there.”\nThat sums up the entire battle. If Beatrice can hold out until then, if the holy convoy isn’t captured.\n“Let’s go!”\nAnd so the procession resumes as dozens of horsemen set off.",

      "content": "Chapter 98: Acolyte Jerea (4)\nSpace orbit at 800 kilometers above ground.\nAn object was falling from a celestial realm beyond the reach of human footsteps.\n-Beep! Beep!\nYakt Spinner, Holy Knight of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild, moves his camera eye quickly in response to a series of system warnings.\n-Calculating fall speed and angle of impact. Eight seconds to plunge into planetary orbit.\nYappy had escaped from the shattered satellite and jumped out, but he calculated that his fuselage would be incinerated if he entered planetary orbit at this rate.\n-Slowing fall. Escape sequence initiated.\nYappy urgently deployed his parachute. Only by slowing down before entering planetary orbit would the fuselage not burn up. But the attempt was thwarted by a variable.\n-Boom!\nThe parachute, which was actually deployed for the first and last time, was torn apart by a piece of the shattered satellite.\n-Beep! Beep! Recalculating risk.\nMeasurement complete.\nThirteen seconds from orbit to burnout.\nThe main logic circuits of the strong artificial intelligence made a hopeless calculation but Yappy is not giving up.\n-Preparing for emergency deceleration. Gathering materials.\nYappy’s camera eye busily checks the sky above the fall.\nDespite being off-center and spinning dozens of times a second, the ultra-high-performance camera eye manages to capture the satellite fragments in a split second.\nIn a perfectly calculated sequence of movements, he throws a steel wire to wrap around them.\nThree pieces, four pieces… Three seconds to orbit, with a few necessary parts secured.\nPulling them into the retrieval system, Yappy immediately retracted his robotic arm and switched to welding.\n-2… 1… Entering gravity orbit.\nAt that moment, the Yappy’s fuselage begins to cook to a crisp. The moment it entered orbit around the planet, the acceleration caused the fuselage to start burning.\nEven asteroids burn up quickly when they enter a planetary orbit. In other words, Yappy has 13 seconds until his leg burns to a crisp.\nYappy manipulated the steel wire to connect the pieces he had pulled together.\nA Holy Knight is a hub of holy power in itself. As such, even this small body can hold out for some time but even with that in mind he only had 13 seconds.\n-Fabricate emergency equipment. Using divine energy.\nYappy’s mechanical arms are busy, and even as they burn in real time, the Holy Knight of Steel is thoroughly calculated.\nYakt Spinner is a Holy Knight of Heto, the god of iron and blacksmithing.\nTo him, the harsh environment in which his body and materials are being melted down in real time is nothing more than a calculation that is being modified in real time!\n-Cheep! Cheep! Chirp! Chirp!\nEight seconds.\n-Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!\n5 seconds.\n-Ingredient burnout, requiring additional supplies.\n3 seconds.\n-Fuselage disassembly, using all parts except those required for minimal motion.\n2 seconds.\nRemove legs, cut dorsal cover, and bend armor to pieces.\nOne second.\nAt that moment, the finished product is a thin, wide sphere but the important part comes next.\nHoly Art <Toolmaking>\nThe Holy Knight’s holy power is imbued into the sphere. In that instant, the sphere’s form is transformed into a holy object imbued with the power of the Blacksmith God.\nThe next moment, it fell from the sky like a shooting star and landed in the middle of a meadow.\n-Boom!\nAs Yappy bounced off the shattered sphere in the aftermath of the collision.\n-Kiiii!\nThe impact of the fall hits his entire body. Even for Yappy, a fall from 800 kilometers in the air has taken its toll.\nAll of the fuselage except the main computer is shattered, and the shattered camera eye can barely perceive its surroundings.\nIf it weren’t for the Holy Law Sphere protecting his body from burning, he would have been incinerated.\n-Main -Sea -Sea, Tem… Over. Long-grade, repair-grade…p…y.\nYappy tried desperately to move the mechanical arm, but the fuselage, which had already accumulated more damage than it could handle, refused to budge.\nHowever, the only intact sound system was alerting him to the approach of something.\n────\nYappy couldn’t see the face of his opponent, so he didn’t know if it was an orc or a barbarian.\nWith that, the limp fuselage was lifted and the broken camera eye captures the ‘red thing’.\n“Who are you, you. How do you use holy power?”\nThe moment it heard those words, Yappy mobilized the power of all its systems to deliver a single word.\n* * * *\nBeatrice watched her opponent’s movements keenly, even as she fired indiscriminately at the Prefects and the Imperial forces.\n‘It’s strange,’ she thought, ‘with that firepower they should have been wiped out long ago.’\nThe Prefects are holding on in the face of a force beyond their capabilities.\n‘The convoy has departed, but…….’\nSuddenly, Beatrice realized that one of the three Prefects was nowhere to be seen, hidden in the hail of lightning.\nIf they were hiding to attack her, she could respond since reacting to an approaching enemy is a fundamental part of group magical warfare.\nIt’s a shame she didn’t have escort knights, but if you’re not a Holy Knight, you can do something about it.\n‘But what if… they’re not hiding to attack me?’\nTheir number one goal was the holy relic convoy that had just left. Beatrice’s gaze was about to turn towards the escaped convoy when──\n“Where are you looking?”\nA huge fireball shot out but Beatrice blocked it with a wave of her hand, however the barrier she deployed cracked.\n‘Stronger than before?’\nThe two mages in purple gaze-tip robes smirked. They were bleeding from the corners of their mouths after taking such a beating.\nTechnically, it’s feedback from overusing magic while deploying the barrier.\nOne more good hit and they’d be dead so Beatrice snapped her fingers once more.\n<Death Eyes>\nAn eerie purple glow traveled at the speed of light toward the prefects.\n“Hmph?”\nNormally, it would have been an attack that would have left them exhausted and unable to react.\n<Enlarge Area of Effect>, <Multi-Activate>──\n<Hyper Spell Break>\nThe combined spells of the two prefects break down Beatrice’s spells.\nNullifying an opponent’s spells in a major magic battle is commonplace, but Beatrice’s High Spell would have been beyond their capabilities.\nHowever it makes no difference as Beatrice is an enormous magical furnace in her own right, but her true talent lies in her ability to harness the scattered reverberations of magic in the air.\n<Magic Circulation>\nIn this massive magical battle, she is virtually invincible. There is no way she can be outmatched by a fellow magic user.\n“Ugh…!”\nJust as she was about to circulate her own magic and the magic of the prefects, a foreign entity appeared.\n“Magi?”\nThe absorbed magic was clearly foreign, something Beatrice knew all too well.\n“You’ve sold your soul to the……demons.”\n“I never thought you’d push us this far.”\nThe prefects’ eyes turned cold.\nIt shouldn’t have been revealed here since this was a power to be unleashed at least two years from now…after the ceremony of the Elected Emperor.\nBut the variable of Beatrice was powerful enough that they had to break the rules.\nGiven the odds and the gravity of the task, it is better to gamble than to fail here and have two of them die.\n<Malignant Descent>\nA disorderly quest. Archdemon “Zendar”\n<Malignant Descent>\nDevouring appetite. Archdemon “Nurgle”\nEvil magic has started to consume the prefects.\n* * * *\nWhile Beatrice held off the Imperials single-handedly, Ha-ri, Koo Dae-sung, and Jerea’s holy relic convoy galloped frantically toward the Lionheart border.\n“We must hurry!”\nJerea urged his horse, clutching the box with the holy relic. The warhorses of the Lionheart Kingdom were the best in the world, so there was no way anyone could be left behind.\n“Ugh…! Mal, try a little harder!”\nHowever Ha-ri and Dae-sung horses that Leon bought on Jeju Island were barely basic.\nTheir horses weren’t good enough to keep up with Lionheart’s steed, and they were naturally at the back of the pack.\n“Hey, don’t worry about us! You go first──”\nIt was then that Koo Dae-sung’s loud shout came from behind Ha-ri’s back.\n“The imperial army is coming!”\nBlack-armored cavalry furiously chased the rear of the convoy.\nThe Imperial Guard of the Imperial Emperor. In other words, an armed force that represents the will of the Emperor and only has the finest steeds, even when compared to those of the Lionheart Kingdom.\n“Where are you going?”\nLeading the way is Wolfhard, one of the strongest in the Empire.\nHis black horse closed the distance in an instant and slammed into Ha-ri’s back.\n“Ugh…!”\nHa-ri wielded her sword as flames engulfed Wolfhard’s armor, but that was all.\nPure Concept <Armor>\nThe strongest armor passed down from generation to generation to the Imperial Guard division commander, the Protector of the Emperor. The armor even surpasses that of a Holy Knight.\nThe flames Ha-ri wielded were only enough to scorch the armor.\n“Die, whore of the gods.”\nWolfhard wielded his two-handed greatsword with one hand as Ha-ri gave up even holding the reins of her horse and turned back to block the sword, but…….\n-Bang!\nHa-ri went flying like a baseball and rolled on the ground.\n“Ha, Miss Han Ha-ri!”\nDae-Sung’s voice didn’t even reach Ha-ri, who bounced away so fast that it didn’t even register.\nWolfhard jumped from his horse since he was obligated to annihilate them before they reached the Lionheart border.\n“I’ll kill them all here!”\nAt that moment, he linked himself to the evil he was ‘contracted’ with.\n<Malignant Descent>\nRuthless destruction. Archdemon “Knua”\nJust like the two prefects his voice reached across dimensions and in response, the subject of the pact reached out to him.\n-Kaaaaaah!\nWolfhard’s armor expanded as if it would shatter and the flesh inside had exploded in an instant.\nBut the Imperial Treasure readjusts its size to the wearer. Within moments, the armor was readjusted, and Wolfhard had undergone a horrific metamorphosis.\nHe had a blood-crazed glint flashed in his eyes, and his exposed flesh seemed to be bursting at the seams.\nWolfhard was already a large man, but now he was at least twice as large.\nEveryone sensed that something had changed.\nIt wasn’t just a physical expansion. The laws of this world had been distorted, and something that shouldn’t be there had revealed its ugliness.\nRegardless, once on the ground, Wolfhard exhales a vicious breath… and begins to pulsate through the air.\n-Bang! BANG! BANG!\nHe made a terrible noise just by running on the ground.\nWolfhard flew past, not even caring about the knights, his eyes only on Jerea and the holy object.\n“Stop him!”\nStella commanded as the riders turned back.\nAt that moment, they were ready to die.\n“To the Lionheart!”\n“For the Lionheart!”\nIn an instant, the riders turned their horses’ heads, crossed their spears, and charged back at Wolfhard. The moment of collision──\n-Thwack!\nSpears shatter against armor, horses are smashed, and riders are sent flying.\nThree seconds from collision to annihilation.\n“Thank you, loyal soldiers.”\nThirteen meters above the ground. The red-haired priestess strikes her sword, the light she believes in transforming it into a holy sword that shields and repels the unholy.\nHoly Law <Holy Sword Unleashed>\nHer blade flashes and sweeps through Wolfhard. It was a deadly blow for a demonic species, capable of slaying even a high-level demon in a single strike.\n“What…!”\nBut Wolfhard withstood it. Instead, he skimmed through it and grabbed Stella.\n“Ew!”\n“You insolent bitch. Die!”\nJust as Wolfhard was about to snap Stella’s neck, a sharp flash cut through him.\n“……!”\nWolfhard let go of Stella at the threatening foreshadowing and stepped back as a middle-aged knight appeared in his vision.\n“Jerea…….”\nJerea’s alter ego interrupted Wolfhard.\n“You’re not even a Holy Knight, and you’re trying to stop me in your youth.”\nWolfhard knew Jerea, for he had been a renowned paladin in his youth.\nA wanderer who had sought the ways of the gods throughout the kingdom, the empire, and the far east. One who had been laughed at as foolish, but who had accomplished the quest and became a Holy Knight.\nHoly Knight Jerea is a remarkable man, to be sure, and he deserves the most honorable seat but he is not the man Wolfhard sees before him.\nThe one before him was a mere figment of the past and he is no match for the contractor of the Archdemon Knua.\n“You’ll have to bring a Holy Knight to defeat me!”\n“The Empire has indeed grown impudent, and when did you make the Holy Knights a topic of discussion?”\n“This guy…….”\nWolfhard glared at the arrogant Jerea thinking he would borrow the power of the Holy Relic──\n“You bastard! Where is the Holy Relic?”\nThere was no sign of the holy relic that Jerea had been holding just a moment ago when suddenly, Wolfhard’s vision caught a glimpse of someone who hadn’t stopped running.\nAn insignificant commoner riding on Jerea’s steed with the red-haired priestess who was knocked off by the first attack.\nThat bum he had ignored as not worth killing was running away with the holy item!\nWolfhard immediately tried to run towards the holy relic, but Jerea and Stella stopped him.\n“You weaklings…!”\nWolfhard swung his greatsword, and the two barely managed to block it and he immediately ordered his Imperial Guards to pursue the holy relic, but others stood in their way.\nA rider with a broken arm, a knight without a horse, every movable person in the holy convoy was blocking the Imperial Guard.\nSome of them were coughing up blood as if they were about to die.\nStella shouts.\n“Knights and soldiers of the glorious Lionheart! Leader of the convoy, Stella Vermilion commands! Sword in hand…!”\nWithout the slightest hesitation, the men draw their swords and even in the face of overwhelming death, their eyes are filled with determination.\n“Today we die here!”\n“”I’ll take your orders!””\nThe horses charge with thundering momentum, their relentlessness overwhelming the Imperial Guards.\nNot only the knights, but even the lowly commoners are charging like knights, ready to die.\n“These foolish fanatics. The dogs of the gods…!”\nWolfhard had always disliked them.\nThe Empire is a strictly caste system. There, nobles are noble and commoners are expendable.\nThe Kingdom, on the other hand, was also a caste system, but its society was very different from the Empire.\nThe kingdom’s nobility, the knights, were willing to lay down their lives for the code they swore to uphold: scrupulous poverty, noble oaths, and righteous discipline.\nEven the commoners they swore to protect were equally willing to offer their loyalty and service in return.\nIt was a far cry from the Empire, which refused to serve the gods in favor of human greed and autonomy.\nThe gap between the Empire and the Kingdom had widened.\n“You are…! Cattle who refuse to judge for yourselves!”\nWolfhard’s greatsword crushed Jerea….He had broken both of his knees just by blocking Wolfhard’s power, which had been amplified by the power of the Archdemon.\n“Lord Jerea!”\n“Never mind me!”\nInstead, Jerea parried Wolfhard’s sword, trying to block his movement.\n“You fool, the disparity in power is too great!”\nBut Wolfhard drew his sword with tremendous strength and trampled on Jerea then his sword struck Stella and her body rolled across the ground like a tossed ball.\n“Hmph…!”\nIt was then that Jerea, who had been killed by Wolfhard, stood up straight. He was now past middle age and had the appearance of a young man.\n‘His resurrection speed has increased?’\nIt was a question, but Wolfhard didn’t care. He wasn’t even an acolyte anymore.\n“How many times can you be resurrected now?”\n“Until the moment the lady takes this life from me.”\nJerea lunged at him, death defying. The difference in power is vast but Jerea stood up again.\n“Huh… Huh…!”\nFaced with an unstoppable evil, he refuses to give up.\n“Is this the end of the line, you foolish child? It will take your main body to defeat me.”\n“……That’s new.”\nSaid the young… no, the boy knight.\n“The Goddess has chosen a lackluster knight.”\nJerea was bleeding, anemic and shaking, his armor shattered, his body soiled… but his eyes were clear as day.\n“Holy Knights are those who dedicate their lives to fulfill the quests of the gods… to face the end and fulfill the task.”\n“Their lives are the most beautiful flowers that have blossomed from myriad faiths…. That dazzling honor was my dream, my goal.”\nJerea raised his sword and the three blades sliced through the air with piercing precision.\nEven with his armor and body shattered and scattered, his sword and his eyes were as clear as ever.\nHe was a foolish man who had seen the limitations of many talented knights time and time again but he never gave up.\nFinally, after seventy years of wandering, he was given an impossible task.\n“She who presides over the end of all things.”\n“Administrator of the underworld and sinners.”\n“Master of the lowest places, guiding mortals.”\nEveryone said it was impossible.\n“Hear my voice.”\n“Protect your knight.”\nBut the knight challenged the impossible.\nHe didn’t need anyone’s judgment.\nHe saw no reason why the impossible should be excluded from the challenge.\nIn the end, he turned the impossible into the possible, and he overcame death.\nThe Goddess of Death was pleased with you.\n[She protects you]\nBeyond time and space, she smiles upon the knight, still dumb and sturdy── upon the being who is only a reenactment of history.\nAnd that is enough.\nThe dullard sings the end of the twilight.\n“Death is with me.”\nJerea’s momentum grows like a storm and Wolfhard realizes that the inexperienced young knight is not what he once was.\n“Nothing has changed!”\nThe greatsword is raised and as if on cue as Jerea’s new weapon shot out like a cannonball.\n“I am not immortal.”\n” I fight in that which is immortal.”\n“Destined to overcome mortality, destined to win.”\n* * * *\nThe battle was over.\nThe fight between the Holy Relic convoy and the Imperial Guard was a losing battle from the start.\nA handful of mostly commoner riders against the Empire’s finest.\nTo make matters worse, they’d spent over half an hour trying to deal with a convoy that was risking its life.\nThe fact that a man who was barely more than a Knight Errant was the last man standing against Imperial Guard Division Commander Wolfhard.\n“Damned fanatics!”\nWolfhard kicked in fury at the body of Jerea, who had vanished in a puff of smoke and clutched at the wound at the nape of his neck.\nIf he hadn’t demonized it with Malignant Descent, he would have been the one with his throat slit.\nWolfhard began to fear inwardly.\n‘What the hell is this kingdom and these crazed fanatics?’\n“Your Excellency…! It’s not too late! It’s at least half a day’s ride on horseback to the Lionheart border, so we have plenty of time to give chase!”\n“We will pursue them immediately! We must recover the holy artifact!”\nWolfhard did not mount his horse since the effects of the Malignant Descent could still be felt for several hours; it would be much faster to run.\n“Your Excellency, what shall we do with her?”\nAt that moment, one of the Imperial Guards pointed to the surviving Lionheart knight. Covered in wounds, she was Stella, the leader of the convoy.\n“Huh… Huh…!”\nHer eyes were still filled with determination as she barely had enough strength to hold her sword with both hands.\n“Deal with her. No survivors.”\nBefore they could begin their pursuit, the Imperial Guard pointed their spears at the dying woman. Even though she was drained, Stella sheathed her sword.\n“To the Lionheart…….”\nDedicating her death to the kingdom.\nA loyal knight sings her last song of glory.\n“Glorious──!”\nAt that moment, Stella felt her skin crawl.\nHer lips swell and the air burns but feeling the anomaly, everyone looked up at the sky.\n“Ah…….”\nIt was a meteor, a meteor that burned itself to a crisp.\nThe red gas in the sky burns the atmosphere of the entire world, evaporating even the clouds. The sky burns red, and red rain pours down, evaporating again and again.\n“……!”\nIt was an impossible anomaly.\nWeather control magic was something the Imperial archmages had created by layering and reinforcing spells over and over again.\nBut this one, just by falling, stained the sky red.\n-Quang!\nThe meteor fell from the sky, creating a huge crater and sending its wake in all directions.\nA red knight appears with a huge explosion that destroys the surroundings in an instant.\nHis full body armor shimmered like a frightening painting.\nHe had a greatsword in each hand but the most frightening of all was the roaring flames. The flames that seemed to incinerate at the mere touch were not flames at all.\nIt was just a visible overflow of holy power from his entire body.\n“Ah, ah…….”\nThe black-armored warriors trembled in fear.\nNo mortal in this era could be unaware of that legend.\n“The Butcher…….”\n“The Beheader…….\n“Wrath of God…….”\n“The……Witch Hunter.”\n“Divine Punisher.”\n“Warhorse of Doom.”\nThe most powerful Holy Knight of his time, rivaling the stature of Lionheart the Demon Slayer.\n“I am Vulcanus!”\nThe Holy Knight of War and Flame and the most powerful Holy Knight of this age unleashed his rage.",

      "content": "Chapter 99: The Most Powerful Holy Knight\nIn this recreation of history, there were three changes.\nFirst, Leon and Jerea ultimately succeeded in defending the canyon against the orc horde, prolonging the Holy Knight’s survival.\nSecond, Yappy’s ability to survive a fall from orbit and still land without burning up.\nThe third is Beatrice, who saved the convoy from being wiped out by the Prefects.\nCompared to all three of these miraculous events, Koo Dae-sung taking the holy relic, and frantically running toward the Lionheart border would be a small factor in this whole miracle.\nBut\n“Heh… heh… heh…!\nHis frenzied flight must have been──\n“Stop!”\n“We are the Flaming Sword Knights, who are you!”\nIt was the decisive blow that changed the course of history.\n* * * *\nSilence fell.\nThere are many eyes and many mouths, but only the Red Knight moves them.\n“You…….”\nVulcanus checks his surroundings.\nThe knights and riders of the kingdom dead, the message from Yappy, who had fallen from the sky and Han Ha-ri, who finally met him halfway with the holy relic, everything became clear.\nThe Empire has betrayed the Kingdom.\nHe shudders and his armor trembles as it pulses with rage. The gaze in the helm’s visor sends a cold chill down everyone’s spine.\n“Excuse yourself.”\n“Excuse ourselves for…what?”\n“Before I burn every last one of your souls, so that you may be ‘forgiven’ for ‘dying’.”\n“Ha…!”\nWolfhard stared at Vulcanus with an expression of disbelief, his sword filled with the color of blood.\n“You are still so arrogant, God’s dogs. Don’t you realize that your arrogance has brought about today’s crisis?”\nWolfhard, Division Commander of the Imperial Guard and one of the Thirteen Prefects made a pact with Knua, the Archdemon of Destruction and Murder.\nHe was a giant on par with Vulcanus but now he grew to three times his size but it was not just his size that has increased his power has also increased.\n“You will bow before the might of the Empire today!”\n“Hmph…!”\nVulcanus recognized the Empire’s long-standing inferiority complex.\nDespite being many times larger than the Kingdom, their influence had always lagged behind that of the Kingdom.\nNo wonder. Humanists and proclaimers of divine independence, they were no better than the glorious Lionheart, favored by the gods but Vulcanus understood that the Empire does not follow the Code and its teachings.\nThey just don’t want to give up what they have.\nThey are afraid to serve their people, to risk their lives in their defense.\nThis is how the empire has fallen from grace.\nI can’t believe they call it independence from God and putting people\n“That’s all it is.”\n“That’s all? In the face of this absolute power, you’re-”\n-Bam!\nVulcanus’ sword slammed into Wolfhard. His enhanced reflexes barely reacted to it, but the blow was too heavy.\n“Mu, what strength…!\nWhat kind of monstrous power could it be that he, the descendant of evil, could be pushed back?\nThe weight lifted and Vulcanus raised his sword to strike again. However Wolfhard seizes the moment, but before he can react, the blade strikes again.\n“Big…!”\n“Do you know why you were able to call yourselves an empire?”\nVulcanus struck again and again with his one-handed greatsword, while Wolfhard parried with his two-handed sword.\n“It’s because we tolerated your existence!”\n-Bam!\nIt was not a clash of iron against iron, but an explosion that sounded like a meteorite hitting the ground. The shockwave alone caused the Imperial Guards to gasp in horror as their bodies were pushed backwards.\n“And with your insolent chanting of independence!”\n-Bam!\n“And your unnecessary territorial expansion!”\n-Bam!\n“All of it! All of it! All of it! Because we allowed it!”\n-Bam!\nThe moment the blow is delivered, the ground on which Wolfhard is standing turns off and a crater appears. The terrain collapses as if a giant bomb had gone off, and shockwaves reverberate everywhere.\n“Huh…!”\nWolfhard had only taken a few blows from Vulcanus’ sword but his armor was shattered, and his vaunted greatsword was cracked.\nWolfhard had thought he had surpassed a Holy Knight in strength now he had that power.\nHis strength, agility, endurance, and boundless magic were already beyond human limits.\nBut what had happened?\nWhy is he being pushed back, why is he being beaten like this?\nVulcanus had been overpowering him with only one holy sword.\n“No, it can’t be!”\nThe head of the Imperial Guard, the most elite force in the Empire is a superhuman and one of the strongest in the Empire and yet he can’t take down a single Holy Knight?\n“Give me your strength, Knua, and I will pay the price as your contractor!”\nAt that moment, a blood-colored energy surges through Wolfhard’s body as crimson light pierces the crimson sky like a blade.\nWolfhard’s golden armor shatters, unable to withstand his expanding flesh.\nWith his transformation complete, Wolfhard sheds his human form.\nHis flesh grew horribly enormous and his legs became like those of a goat, as he started to resemble the Archdemon of destruction and murder.\n“From now on, this is my land!”\n<Territory Declaration – Skull Shrine>\nThe power of a murderous demon beyond destruction grants the caster unlimited strength and the power to kill.\nWolfhard laughed as he felt the power to destroy everything and the power to control space.\nThis is omnipotence. This is the power of the transcendents. He almost burst out laughing.\n-Kuwaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nThe whole world is filled with his noise as an endless surge of power and magic fills the world.\nWho can stand in the face of such power? It’s no longer about the Holy Knights. Not even the gods can stand against this power.\n“This….”\nWolfhard’s gaze fell on Vulcanus, who was trembling.\nHa, to drop your swagger like that, to finally succumb to overwhelming power. You’re only human after all, he thought.\nBut the despicable satisfaction was short-lived.\nFor everyone realized that Vulcanus’ trembling was not from fear or submission, but from anger.\n“How dare you… how dare you declare the land of the gods a realm of evil.”\nHis power surged as the crimson aura that had been swirling has already risen into flames. The air of the world is scorched, and it is frightening to breathe.\n“This land you stand upon. Not just the kingdom, but here, there, and beyond… all of it, all of it, all of it!”\nA terrible heat surges through the two holy swords as a giant pillar of fire forms in Vulcanus hands, the embodiment of his rage.\n“──The land of the gods!!!”\nIn the next moment, the red sword was swung as the canyon and the entirety of the empire’s lands burned.\nEndless flames scorched the world, as if trying to cleanse the atmosphere of its malignant contamination without leaving a trace.\nThe entire territory declared by Wolfhard was burned and after a mere five seconds Vulcanus and Stella were the only living creatures on the land.\n* * * *\nWith their powers amplified by the Malignant Descent, the two Prefects thought they had won.\nSuch great power, such endless wisdom of magic, such voracious lust for control of space.\n‘It’s only a matter of time before we take down that insolent bitch.’\nSure, it’s a shame we missed the holy convoy, but that doesn’t matter now that Wolfhard’s gone. In fact, capturing an archmage of this caliber might be worth more than the holy relics.\n“Arrogant bastards. The Empire is behind this disaster after all.”\nIt was then that beyond Beatrice, a golden glow appeared from higher in the sky.\n“You are…!”\n“King Leon!”\nThe sudden appearance stunned the two prefects. Why would the Lionheart King, who was supposed to be in Wangdao, be here?\n“Your Majesty, you’re late.”\n“I’m late because I sent off an old friend. Do you mind if I join you?”\nBeatrice shrugs at Leon’s words.\n“Unlike your Majesty, I have no interest in monopolizing the honor or glory of knighthood.”\n“Perhaps we should discuss taking your due honor and the glory of battle …… sometime.”\nLeon raised his holy spear to join the battle but then he saw something in the sky that made everyone turn red.\n“What was that?”\nIt was a massive anomaly that would baffle even the magician queen and a terrible heat radiates from it, as if the sky is on fire.\nEven the two prefects are stunned, wondering what kind of magical phenomenon could have caused it to reach this far, but only Leon shakes his head in disbelief.\n“Well, well. I guess we don’t have to go out there.”\n“Your Majesty?”\n“He has an unforgiveness for demon worshipers that rivals this king’s.”\nIn the next moment a meteor fell from the sky bathed in searing heat as if it had fallen from orbit.\n“An asteroid?”\n“Who summoned Meteor?”\nThe highest level of magic that could only be summoned by ten archmages performing a ritual for ten days and ten nights. Who on earth could have cast such a spell?\nBut they soon realized that it wasn’t an asteroid, it was a single human wearing armor.\n“No way-──!”\n-Bam!\nThe meteor that landed in the middle of the battlefield was an armor in the shape of a man. The knight was a blazing flame, and in his hand was a torn, charred torso.\n“Wolfhard!”\nThe prefects were horrified to see that Wolfhard was dead.\n“These are your fellow scum.”\nWolfhard’s body was thrown away like garbage. After treating one of the Empire’s 13 Prefects this way, the Red Knight glared at the other two with a destructive gaze.\n“You scum will not be left with a single soul!”\nFilled with rage, he doesn’t even wait for the prefects to open their mouths. He simply concentrates all the embers in the world to incinerate the scum in front of him.\nDivine Punishment <Battlefield Flame>\nThe two greatswords become a giant pillar of fire.\n“What, you fool, wasting your power to spread it out like that-─!”\n-Kukkaaaaah!\nA huge pillar of fire engulfs the Imperial army and the prefects.\nThe prefects, instinctively sensing the danger, demonized and deployed a barrier with all their might.\nAmong them was a treasure that had the power to summon a purely conceptual barrier, but──\n“Grrrrrr?!”\nTheir skin burned and their blood vessels boiled. Even though they blocked the flames from the front, their bodies were cooked by the rapidly rising temperature.\n‘This is ridiculous! How can I stop such spreaded power──?’\nHuman strength has its limits however, this Flame Knight had none.\nIt took less than three seconds for the two who made pacts with the Archdemons to burn to ashes.\nVulcanus the Butcher showed his overwhelming power that no species can survive against.\n* * * *\nThe Battle of the Gorge was ended by the arrival of Vulcanus. After burning everything to the ground, he walked toward Leon.\n-Thud! Thump! Thump! Thud!\nThe heavy armor of a man well over two meters tall and must have weighed several hundred kilograms echoed in the canyon as he moved.\nThrough his visor, his gaze burning, he drops to one knee.\n“Agent of the All-Gods, owner of the Lionheart and guardian of the Grail, I greet you, Lionheart!”\nIt was a slight departure from courtly etiquette, but Leon was glad of it, considering his origins.\n“It’s been a long time, Lord Vulcanus.”\n“…….”\nVulcanus didn’t ask why the man he’d met at the palace not long ago was here.\n“Yes, Your Majesty, I am glad to see you!”\nHe dismisses all questions with a stiff reply.\n“Your Majesty.”\nAt that moment, Beatrice came to Leon’s side as the quest was updated.\n[You have succeeded in your quest]\n[Assist Sir Jerea to escort the holy relic to the Lionheart border]\n-Side Mission: Defend Sir Jerea’s main body to the end.\nWhile the two survivors were unable to see, Beatrice, the one who opened the gate, was aware of it.\n“We need to gather everyone before the gate closes.”\n“Hmm…….”\nLeon looked at Vulcanus and came to a decision.\n“I have much to say to you, my lord, but the situation is urgent and we must move first.”\n“Who can argue with the path of Your Majesty?”\n“Sir, can you give me an object that symbolizes you?”\n“If thou wilt.”\nVulcanus stretched out his arm, and a ring of flame formed, from which emerged a cracked… dagger that radiated heat even through the cracks.\n“Thank you.”\nKnowing what it was worth and what it meant to Vulcanus, Leon gladly accepted the item from the honored knight.\n“Farewell, Sir Vulcanus. We will meet again someday.”\nWith that, Leon soared into the sky as he looked at the dagger Vulcanus had given him and thought.\n‘Vulcanus is not in the Paradise of the Gods.’\n* * * *\nRetrieving the scattered cadets was a close call since their starting points had varied as they entered the artificially created gate but thanks to Beatrice’s tracking spell, she was able to find each and every one of them.\n“Your Majesty!”\n“You’re here!”\nFinally, they reached the Lionheart border, where we met Ha-ri, Dae-Sung and Yappy with the Knights.\n“This… is the holy object!”\nLeon opened the box of holy relics that Dae-Sung had given him, and immediately recognized what it was.\n“This is amazing. I can’t believe this is the holy relic I lost…….”\n‘This is also fate.’\nLeon stroked the relic and chuckled.\n“Welcome home.”",

      "content": "Chapter 100: The First Lionheart Relic\nPark Soo-jin, an appraiser at the Korean Hunter Association, had an unexpected business trip scheduled for her morning commute.\nThe destination was the TTG Guild in the Naju Plains, which has been on a roll lately.\n“Wow, did you feel it too? It’s so refreshing.”\n“I… felt God. Should I convert?”\n“Aren’t you from one of the three major Christian families?”\nTourists entering a famous cafe chain with satisfied expressions. I wonder if this is really a tourist destination.\nNot only Koreans, but also foreigners. They say there are 10,000 tourists a day.\nIf you can hold an Epic item, they’ll give it to you…….’\nGeorgic’s One-Handed Hammer, the second Epic item in Asia and the first in Korea.\nA treasure whose very existence is a national treasure… No, it would not be an exaggeration to say that it is the first national treasure, and the TTG Guild has declared that it will give it to you if you can hold it.\nAn Epic item, that is.\nThe world was turned upside down by these words and Hunters everywhere went crazy. It’s an Epic item that requires a hefty entrance fee just to see it, let alone challenge it.\nIt’s just an entrance fee for an item that’s priceless.\n‘Should I… try?’\nYou never know, you could be the owner of an Epic Hammer, and if you put it up for sale, there would be countries all over the place that would buy it for hundreds of billions.\nPark Soo-jin entered the TTG Guild, hoping to take a look around but at that moment, a small mechanical spider stood in front of the entrance.\nThe Yakt Spinner also known as Yappy it’s a killing machine that used to be the nightmare of Cheongju Gate, but now it’s a specialty of the TTG Guild.\n-Collected entrance fee. Accepting donations. Accepts Five Star Pay.\nI’ve heard that he is a Holy Knight, the highest rank in the doctrine of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild but I wonder what he’s asking for.\n-Face check. Park Soo-jin, head of the Hunter Association’s appraisal department.\n“Huh, you recognize me?”\n-The Hunter Association’s data bank knows all.\n“…….”\nPark realizes she just heard a very dangerous statement, but she tries to ignore it.\n-Contacted His Majesty. Wait inside.\n“Oh, yeah, so… while I’m here, do you mind if I take a look at your hammer?”\n-Challenge?\n“Uh, yeah, sure…thanks. But what’s the challenge fee?”\n-Five million won.\n“Expensive…….”\nOf course, it’s not that much money considering the value of Epic items.\nIt wasn’t a lotto level but for a commoner like Park, it was a lot of money, and she was about to give up the challenge.\n-There is an asset quota. You’re in the second quintile. 500,000 won.\n“Wow, that’s a big discount… Wait a minute, what’s my asset class…….”\n-Class 2.\n“What?”\n– Class 2. Are you going to do it or not?\n“……I won’t.”\nPark Soo-jin felt a chill run down her spine. The image of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild is usually that of a private organization of His Majesty the King in a fantasy world that sprang out of the Middle Ages, but could this organization actually be hiding a terrifying power?\nShaking off the chill, Soo-jin entered the building and saw a familiar face.\n“Oh! Ms. Park!”\n“Deputy Han?”\nShe was still the same girl who was so cute and energetic that the Association loved her.\n“I heard you’ve been on the rise lately.”\n“Ah~ Hehe, I’m a goddess even if I look like this.”\n“The goddess of the sea and waves?”\n“And Petos, the god of war and flame.”\nIt seems that she is loved everywhere, even here in the Ten Thousand Gods Guild.\n“You’re here for an appraisal today, right?”\n“Yes.”\n“In that case, follow me!”\nAs they headed to the appraisal location the two continued their long-overdue conversation.\n“I know you texted me out of the blue this morning, but what’s up, you’ve been raiding a lot of gates lately, is that why?”\n“Mm~ Yeah, something like that.”\nHa-ri awkwardly confirmed since there were some things she had to keep from her coworkers.\nLeon said that the information about the fact that a gate could be opened artificially should not be made public yet.\n“Here we are! Ah! The king and queen are here!”\nThey arrived at a terrace inside the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods, where they saw the two of them enjoying a tea break and taking in the view from the second floor terrace.\n“Wow…….”\nPark Soo-jin admired the couple’s appearance.\nHands holding teacups and upright postures. I wonder if this is what royalty looks like, enjoying tea time.\nBeatrice’s face was obscured by a cotton cloth, but it was clear that she was a stunning beauty, and Leon was a nobleman in a way that no picture or video could do justice.\nBlond, wallflower, stereotypical royalty on the cover of a romance fantasy.\nWho would have thought that this handsome young man, who looks like he could be a perfect candidate for romance, could be the world’s greatest super-asshole knight king?\n“You’re from the Association.”\n“Oh, yes! My name is Park Soo-jin…!”\nSoo-jin awkwardly greeted them since the Association’s policy on Leon is strict.\nRoughly speaking, everyone who holds a public office in this country is trained for two weeks in the royalty manual, and the Association even has an internal test.\n“Ha-ri, show her the goods.”\n“Ms. Park, this way.”\nHa-ri showed Park the object to be appraised, and when she saw it, she was blown away.\n“Wow… what is this? Wait, is that… the axe of the Orc Champion?”\n“And this staff? The Magic Tower would pay tens of billions for it!”\n“Oh my god, what is this circlet, pure concept?”\nEach of these items was incredible.\nThe axe of Balbaza, champion of Helkan.\nThe staff of Maghar, champion of Gokrok.\nThe sachet of Skira, champion of Skunik.\nThe pelt of Dagil, chieftain of the beast-god.\nThe circlet of the Imperial Preemptor, Law King, and more.\nEvery single one of them was a Legendary item but as if that wasn’t enough, Leon handed her another dagger.\n“This, this is also a great item.”\n[Vulcanus Ritual Dagger]\n[Rank: Legendary]\n[Description: This dagger was given to Vulcanus, the great Holy Knight of War and Flame, in response to his offering of himself to Petos.\nIt is imbued with the flame of the gods.]\n[Unresponsive: The weathering of long wars has prevented it from triggering its functions.]\nIt was an old dagger however the power contained within the dagger was so great that it was declared Legendary.\nLeon received it when he asked Vulcanus for a symbol of his and he willingly gave it to him.\n-Can you open the gate with this thing?\n-I can. But that means…….\nBeatrice realized from Leon’s question that Vulcanus was not in Paradise.\nHad his soul been captured by the demons, like Georgic’s? If so, Leon would surely set out to bring him back to Paradise.\n“This is the last time.”\nApart from that, there was another box that Ha-ri had carefully brought with her.\n“Let’s see………Wow!”\nThe moment the box opened and she saw what was inside, she felt her breath catch in her throat.\nIt was a sword sheath.\nA dazzlingly ornate and lavishly crafted symbol of authority, more akin to a royal scepter than a sheath but the holy aura it emanated suggested it was an object used in religious ceremonies.\n-Bam!\n‘This is no ordinary object.’\nPark Soo-jin put on her appraisal white gloves and scrutinized the scabbard with her appraisal skill.\n“Wow…….”\nThe basis of the Appraisal Skill is the interpretation of items. Even if you rely on a system, the features and phrases that can be interpreted depend on the individual’s capabilities.\nPark Soo-jin is a 10-year veteran. She examined the scabbard carefully and gently.\n“Made by melting… blessed gold… in the finest dyes, and what is this language? Characters that even the system can’t interpret?”\n“It’s a neologism for reaching for the stars, against all odds. It’s not spoken much these days.”\n“Oh, is that so?”\nShe wondered how Leon knew that, but it made it easier for her.\n“Your Majesty… If you don’t mind, I can translate these characters…….”\nLeon was known for his stubbornness, but he was willing to comply with Park’s request. He seemed to value the scabbard as well.\n“Be brave and do good.”\n“Establish justice, even when the heavens fall.”\n“Love like a star.”\n“Make your destiny shine.”\nLeon smirked as she recited them and Beatrice asked, puzzled.\n“What is it?”\n“They are the aphorisms of the first Lionheart King, words he left to later Lionheart Kings.”\n“They’re meaningful, which means this sword is…….”\n“This is the sword of His Majesty Richard Lionheart the first Lionheart King, who founded the kingdom along with the Grand Duke of Dragonia.”\n[The Sword Collection of Richard Lionheart]\n[Rating: Epic]\n[Description: This scabbard holds the holy sword of the great First Lionheart King Richard Lionheart.\nIt was hammered by the God of the blacksmith himself from stardust melted by divine flames under the beating sun.]\n[Knight of Arianna: The holy sword channels the energy of light.]\n[Horseman of Petos: The holy sword grants you the favor of war.]\n[Protector of Heto: The holy sword reads the voyages of the stars.]\n“Hmph…!”\nPark Soo-jin’s lips quivered as she marveled at the unusual features and then gasped at the rating of the last item she saw.\n“Eh, Epic!”\nHer pupils dilate in disbelief. It was an Epic item.\nNo, Epic wasn’t the name of a lapdog, but how the hell did it just pop up like that, and in a guild that was less than half a year old!\n“So, what do you think?”\n“Ah, yes…! Yes! It’s called… the Epic ranked…Richard Lionheart’s Sword Collection!”\nIt is not a sword collection in the pure sense of the word.\nThe Grail Guardian with the Lionheart has the power to manipulate subspace.\nAs such, there is no need for a scabbard to hold the Holy Sword, the Holy Spear, and the Holy Grail at all times.\n“Holy sword.”\nAt Leon’s words, the Holy Sword appeared from subspace. He raised the holy sword and the sheath reacted.\n“Huh?!”\nA scabbard that reacts to an item and moves itself? Park Soo-jin was stunned, but Leon activated the holy sword’s function as if he had expected it.\n-Indestructible Holy Sword.\n-Holy Sword of Fire.\nThe last function hasn’t been restored, but it will be restored if it’s linked to the sword sheath.\n-Ohhhhhh…!\nA guttural sound ripples through space as the scabbard and the holy sword were drawn to each other like magnets, as if in the process of a great union.\nThen, as the scabbard sheathed itself in the holy sword, an amazing thing happened.\nThe scabbard transformed itself to match the size and length of the holy sword.\n“Indeed…back off.”\nLeon pushed Ha-ri and Soo-jin aside and stared at the sky from the terrace, his gaze focused on the commotion, the soldiers and staff of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild, and even the tourists in the distance.\nLeon called out.\n“Leon Dragonia Lionheart, Fifteenth Lionheart, worthy successor to the first Lionheart, earthly agent of the gods, asks the sacred object for its qualifications!”\nLeon drew his sword from its sheath and at the same instant, a blinding golden light poured from it, shooting out as it swung.\nIt cuts through the air, crosses space, and touches the sky as the light’s mark on the sky was evident in the parted clouds.\nThe Scabbard of the Holy Sword has recognized Leon, and he has rightfully taken its power.\n“”………….””\nLeon laughed as everyone’s jaws dropped at the sight.\n“I guess I better get ready.”\nThe power of his past, his prime, was finally in his hands.\n“Han Ha-ri.”\n“Yes, yes, Your Majesty!”\n“We will begin the knighting ceremony. Prepare yourself.”\n“Ah…! Yes!”\nYou will reap the fruits of your training, and…you will begin to step towards your full power.\n“I will prepare for the ceremony. Originally, I was going to read the heavens and wait for the right time, but thanks to the First Emperor’s sword collection, I can do it now.”\n“You mean the… ‘it’ you spoke of earlier?”\n“Yes.”\nThe plan is known to only three people in the Great Hall: Leon, who will perform the ritual, Beatrice, who will draw the summons, and──\n“Lord Spinner!”\n-Your Majesty.\nYakt Spinner, who had come to Leon’s side by the wall, answered.\n“I will open a stardust forge. Do you think you can do it?”\n-Project completion rate 15%. Two weeks to complete a fully operational facility, which is doable at the current rate.\n“Good. Then we’ll start by forming the Knights and summoning the Star through a ritual.”\nThe requirements for the creation of the Lionheart Kingdom Holy Knights were:\n-The Holy Grail and Knights.\n-Diviners to read the star’s voyage and summon it.\n-A stellar iron forge to forge the star, and a blacksmith of the God of iron and smithing.\nFinally it was all in place.",

      "content": "Chapter 101: The Cadets’ Situation\nKnight Candidate Chun So-yeon is the granddaughter of the leader of Korea’s premier hunter guild, the Divine Sword Guild.\nFrom the moment she awakened as a Hunter, she was favored to succeed Guild Leader Chun Jinsoo.\nNot surprisingly, Chun So-yeon’s own talents are more than adequate to succeed him.\n[Young lady, do you really intend to stay there?]\nBeyond the receiver, a familiar female voice could be heard.\nAs such, it could only be addressed to her, the successor of the Divine Sword Guild.\n“Uh, yeah. For a while.”\n[No one is saying anything yet, but they’re all talking, because you’ve practically stepped out of your appointed position].\n“I can’t help it, I was that attracted.”\n[Was the holy law that impressive?]\n“Yeah. I’ve seen it time and time again.”\nChun So-yeon, the successor of the Divine Sword Guild, who had been treated like a young lady her entire life, was the reason she had come down here.\nThe Holy Law is a miraculous power and Chun So-yeon wanted to have that power.\n[We, the Divine Sword Guild, also have many sword laws and arcane.]\n“I know, but you know, it’s not enough to kill that man.”\n[Lady…….]\nThe voice on the other end of the phone grows somber at the name now forbidden to even be mentioned in the Divine Sword Guild.\nThe only people who can speak it are the Guild Leader Chun Jinsoo and his granddaughter Chun So-yeon.\n“Do we know where he is now?”\n[……The last place it was seen was in Vietnam, and it’s still with us]\nYeah, he’s not dead yet, and he can’t kill anyone.\nA wandering demon, hiding in the back of the world, and no one has ever hunted it down.\n‘The Lionheart King… maybe.’\nNo, So-yeon denied the thought she hadn’t uttered.\nIt had to be her who took its life. It could never be Leon, or it would mean nothing. Therefore──\n“I will master the Holy Law. If I have this power…I can do it.”\nChun So-yeon ended the call, silently vowing revenge.\n* * * *\nThe training manuals of the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods are not for the faint of heart, even for soldiers.\nIt’s true that the world is different when compared to the modern military, which is plagued by issues of basic human rights and brutality, but the medieval system of training in the TTG Guild cannot be compared to the modern era.\n“One!”\n“Two…!”\n“Three!”\nThe soldiers raise their shields in response to the roaring commander’s call, and dozens of horses charge in front of them.\n-Quang!\n-Quang!\n-Quang!\nThe riders charge into the shield wall. It’s a joint morning drill between the Knight Cadets and the Man at Arms heavy infantry.\n“Break through! Break through no matter what!”\n“Block it! Block it with all the strength you can muster!”\nThose who want to break through and those who want to block. The fierce confrontation is kept tense because the blockers vastly outnumber the chargers.\nA hundred Man-At-Arms and ten knight cadets, that’s a tenfold difference, which means they lack the mass of a collision, and it’s not easy to penetrate the layers of armor.\n“Shit, the horses are stuck!”\n“Try pushing through the front!”\nThe knight cadets, unable to penetrate the dense shield wall, let out a collective yell. Their gazes turn to Han Soo-ho, who is at the front of the line.\n“Soo-ho, try to break through!”\n“Ugh… I’m trying my best… Ugh!”\nAs Soo-ho taps at the shield wall with his wooden sword, it is grabbed, and he is dragged to the center of the shield wall.\n“Hit him!”\n“Stomp!”\nThe Man-At-Arms stomped and stabbed relentlessly. A fallen cavalryman is a terrible thing.\n“Boys, wait…!”\n“He’ll recover quickly anyway, thanks to the Grail!”\n“Surely they don’t have the same base as we do!”\n“Ugh!”\nEven as Soo-ho was being dragged away and beaten, the knight cadets in the back row were unable to make a move. Watching, Leon stood up.\n“Stop! Shield group wins! Next group!”\nThe second group was Ha-ri’s. She cast a pitying glance at Soo-ho, who was being dragged toward the Holy Grail with bloodied hands.\n“Ugh, Soo-ho… I’ll avenge you.”\nHa-ri raised her lance. The cadets were equipped with the standard Lionheart gear: swords, spears, and horses.\nSurprisingly armor had not been adopted on the grounds since in Leon’s estimation, it was better to be unarmored than armored.\nIt was quite a comparison to the heavily armored men-at-arms who spent a fortune on it.\n“Let’s go!”\n“Follow Senior Han!”\n“Let’s avenge the others!”\nThe feverish knight cadets raced across the ground and at the head of the pack, Ha-ri raised her lance.\nIt was far from a formal charge since from the moment the horse gains momentum, air resistance is forced into every action.\nThat’s why the lance, assuming a frontal impact, is designed to have as little drag as possible and by lifting it, you’re violating the fundamentals of jousting.\n“I’ve got it all figured out!”\nHoly Technique <Wave>\nWater flows from Ha-ri’s lance. The water wraps around the lance in a spiral, and Ha-ri swings it.\n-Kaaaaaah!\n“Woah!”\nSmall waves pounded against the barrier, and no matter how steadfast the humans were, they could not withstand the onslaught.\nThe shields crumble, and Ha-ri leaps over them in a single bound.\n“Cadets win!”\n-Ouch!\n-That’s it!\nCadet Group 2 bursts into laughter as Ha-ri’s holy arts allow them to break through but the shield group scowls at them.\n“Ugh, isn’t it cheating to use the Holy Law?”\nShield Captain Kim Do-han protested, but Ha-ri giggled and made a V with her fingers.\n“There was no rule about foul play!”\n“Huh…….”\nScratching his head at the trouble he was having dealing with the only gender-neutral cadet in the group, Kim Do-han moved to the grail with his teammates.\nNext up was Chun So-yeon’s group 3 and Kim Jae-hyuk’s group 4.\nBoth of them were ranked Knight Cadets, and both succeeded in breaking through the shield wall.\nThey switched groups and repeated the attack and defense. After the joint training, they reviewed each other’s attacks and defenses.\n“The Guardians have a good defense, but their offense is weak.”\n“Still, they have the lowest loss rate after a failed breakthrough.”\n“Ms. Han Ha-ri is just out of spec, no group can stop her.”\n“She’s a fraud.”\n“Chun So-yeon is a bitch.”\n“Her breakthrough power is unbelievable. After using the spear, she immediately threw it away and switched to a sword.”\n“Mr. Kim is used to using spears. He used his own spear, not a lance.”\n“He’s simply strong, but he’s surprisingly cautious, which is the opposite of his usual personality.”\nOn the other hand, the knight cadets were also back in training.\n” Kim Do-han is from the first class, so he’s definitely a veteran.”\n“Surprisingly, the fourth-grade trainees are pretty tough, too. Is it a numbers game?”\n“I’ve heard there are quite a few C- and B-class Hunters from the third and fourth classes.”\n“They must have the impact power of a mounted charge, but how are they holding up so well?”\n“It’s the aftermath of the charge, after they fail to break through, that’s the problem. If they dry out a bit, they’ll be eaten.”\nIt takes at least a few years of training to create proper knights and soldiers.\nBut they were already quality trainees who had received practical training at the gate and in the academy, and they rose quickly.\nBest of all, they had the most exemplary knight in front of them.\n“Get out! If you fail to break through, fall back with the rear ranks leading the way! The infantry are bound to be slower than you, so use your maneuverability to close the distance and prepare to charge again!”\n“Hold your shields steady! Threaten your horses to reduce the moment of impact! Knights are not invincible! Let the rear ranks support the men in the lead!”\nLeon was a military strategist who mastered both the exemplary breakthrough tactics of the knight and the defensive tactics that prevented the knight from breaking through.\nA veteran of more than a hundred years of leading legions to war was a great help.\nAs the training drew to a close, Leon analyzed each of the knight cadets and tailored his training to them.\nNeedless to say, the cadets’ abilities were growing by the day, as were the trainees’.\n-Your Majesty.\n“Lord Spinner, what’s going on?”\n-This quarter’s batch of knight cadet applications. Several B-class Hunters. Several A-ranked Hunters available.\n“Well, it’s time for the next batch of knight cadets.”\nThey haven’t even formed a Knight Order yet, but the more the merrier.\nAfter all, what Leon ultimately wanted was an army to destroy demons, not a guild to raid the Gates.\n“It’s time to start preparing for the ceremony.”\nLeon looked at the papers before the upcoming ceremony.\nHan Soo-ho, Han Ha-ri, Kim Jae-hyuk, Chun So-yeon, Koo Dae-sung and about 40 other cadets from the academy.\nHow many of them would be able to pass the first exam?\n* * * *\n“Hey, kids~ snacks are here.”\nIn the dormitory of the knight cadets, the cadets jumped at the sight of the potatoes and sweet potatoes that Ha-ri brought them.\n“Senior, where’s the kimchi?”\n“Inspector Choi took care of some.”\n“Oh!”\nKim Jae-hyuk excitedly accepted the vat of kimchi that Ha-ri brought.\nOver the years, many franchise shops and restaurants have opened near TTG Guild.\nThe economic cycle created by Georgic’s one-handed hammer was enough to revitalize the rural village.\nAs the original producer of the Blessed Crops, it was only a matter of time before the city’s economic power grew.\nThe problem was that the benefits of such capital were not available to the cadets and trainees of the TTG Guild.\n“Ugh… How long are we going to have to eat nothing but sugar-salt water?”\n“It’s better when we raid the gates, at least we’ve had a good meal.”\n“I know.”\nIt’s no wonder the cadets, including Kim Jae-hyuk, are making ‘boo’ noises.\nWhile the soldiers can eat properly after the completion ceremony, the cadets are still eating sugar-salt water over and over again.\nThis is how they quench their hunger in the name of late-night snacks, but they can’t help but be reminded of the fast food restaurants they can see across the street from the TTG Guild building.\n-Bang!\nHa-ri clapped her hands, silencing the cadets’ complaints.\n“Come on, it’s only a matter of time before the commissioning ceremony, so you’ll be able to eat proper food from then on!”\n“But, senior, didn’t you say that we’ll finish our faith education before the ceremony?”\n“Didn’t I? Apparently, to become a Kingdom Knight, you have to use the Holy Law.”\n“You said we’re going to connect with the gods, what is that?”\nAll eyes turned to Ha-ri since she was the only one of the knight cadets with a connection to the gods.\nHa-ri’s knighthood was already a foregone conclusion.\n“Hmm~ In my case, Lord Poma and Lord Petos handpicked me, so I’m not sure… Didn’t you all choose the ones you mainly believe in?”\n“Well, we’re basically the same, Lady Arianna of light and justice and Lord Petos of war and flame.”\n“His Majesty has said that knights usually serve those two.”\n“Isn’t Poma, the god of the sea and waves, hot these days? I heard that the Kikiruks have erected a new statue of him off the coast of Mokpo.”\nNaturally, after talking about the gods, the cadets began to talk about lesser deities.\n“Sir Yappy is the Holy Knight of Lord Heto of Iron and Blacksmithing, right? What did he say about his powers?”\n“He said it was a blacksmithing ability.”\n“He’s been making things in his base. Last time I checked, he was experimenting with sub-luminous firing of charged particles or something.”\n“…… Why is he doing sci-fi by himself?”\nIt was then that a familiar mechanical sound came from the dorm’s public address system.\n[Beep!]\n“I heard a tiger comes when you say so…….”\n[This is not a tiger]\nYappy picking up on the cadets’ monologues and answering them horrified the cadets.\n“Lord Yappy, did you put a recorder in here too!”\n[No. The machine’s sound wave detection is not comparable to that of an organism]\n“Privacy! Privacy!”\n[Considered.]\nYappy replied with a cynical mechanical sound, then returned to his original request.\n[Cadet Kim Jae-hyuk, you have a visit from your chaperone; please make your way to the entrance of the compound quickly].\n“…….”\nHearing the news, Jae-hyuk’s expression instantly stiffened.\n“I’ll go.”\n“That’s right.”\nSeeing his suddenly stiffened expression, the cadets gave Jae-hyuk a puzzled look as he left the dormitory.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“I thought……was going to come up.”\nJae-hyuk’s best friend, Soo-ho, looked like he had guessed.\n“What is it?”\n“Uhm… it’s not something I can answer, so… just… do it.”\nSoo-ho shut his mouth, and no one could ask more.\n* * * *\nJae-hyuk trudged toward the entrance of the TTG Guild building.\nHunter Academy is a boarding school and even now, when he was practicing for graduation, he was still living in the TTG Guild, so he had been away from his family for a long time.\nWhile most cadets would feel nostalgic and excited, Jae-hyuk was different.\nJae-hyuk spotted a middle-aged woman waiting for him at the entrance of the TTG Guild building and bluntly asked her,\n“Why are you here?”\n“Jae-hyuk!”\nThe middle-aged woman was Jae-hyuk’s mother, Shin Jin-soo, and rushed toward him.\n“Is that what you want to say to your mom?”\n“Forget it. Just tell me what you want.”\nAt Jae-hyuk’s attitude, Shin-shin made a sad face and said in an impatient voice.\n“Do I need a reason to come see my son?”\n“You came because you have a reason.”\n“You, what kind of language is that!”\n“I’m busy. So just say what you have to say and go.”\n“Kim Jae-hyuk!”\nShin Jin-soo looked extremely angry at her son’s bad attitude.\n“You… you requested a draft from our guild, why are you here?”\n“That’s my business. Don’t bother.”\n“How could I not care? I’m your mom!”\n“I don’t care what you say, I’m not going to your place.”\n“What’s wrong with you? That’s a top 10 guild and you were promised a bright future, why are you doing this…….”\nIf anyone else had seen this, they would have dismissed it as a conflict between a bad son and his mother, a common scene of conflict over future plans.\nBut the next words she spoke were not from a normal mother-son relationship.\n“Have you entered this den of heretics? This is a betrayal of Him!”",

      "content": "Chapter 102: Religion\nAt the TTG Guild, knights and cadets… and staff, if you prefer… have common classes.\nWe call it a class, not a drill, because it’s really a time of learning.\nIt’s a time to learn about the gods of the Pantheon, its history, and its code. The pastor, of course, is Leon.\nWhile religious studies may be the last thing on a young person’s mind these days, the religious education class at the Ten Thousand Gods Guild is something else entirely.\nThis class is what the cadets wanted most, to understand the real gods and borrow their power.\nThis is the moment that the cadets have been waiting for, to borrow power from the gods and implement the Holy Law.\n“What is the difference between the Deities of the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods and the cults, answer me.”\n“”………….””\nLeon’s question caused a collective gasp.\nUp until this point, the Great Hall of Gods and its deities had been sacrosanct territory.\nLeon was the pinnacle of that, the pope proclaiming its sanctity.\nFor him to compare the Great Hall to the cults out there?\nIf he hadn’t said it, someone would have called it blasphemy.\nThe cadets were silent for a moment. Is it really okay to answer a question when the person who is the embodiment of the religion itself allows it?\nIt’s like when the army asks, “Were you drafted into the army?” and who says they were drafted…?\n“Is that the difference between real and unreal?”\nAt that moment, it was Beatrice who raised her hand, sitting some distance away from the cadets.\nThe cadets swallowed hard at the sound of a voice beyond the cotton wool, but Leon responded nonchalantly.\n“Where’s your proof that they don’t exist?”\n“Proof…you mean?”\nThe cadets cocked their heads in response. He was discussing cults and asking for proof that they don’t exist.\n“Not just cults, but the religions of this world. Yahweh, Buddha, Allah, the 330 million gods of India. Where is the proof that they don’t exist?”\nHan Soo-ho raised his hand cautiously.\n“I… those gods don’t work miracles, at least not that I know of.”\nThe gods of the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods do work miracles.\nThey cleanse the land of miasma contamination and enact holy laws that force conception.\nAll of the miracles Leon attests to are only possible because the gods are real, Soo-ho says.\n“If they don’t work miracles, they’re not gods, are they?”\n“What? Uh, um…….”\nSoo-ho doesn’t know how to answer Leon’s question.\nAll he knows is that all the religions he’s ever known have performed miracles in the past, but none of them have performed miracles in the present.\nOnly the gods of the Great Hall are special enough to conclude that they are real.\n“Well… aren’t the gods of the Great Hall of the Ten Thousand Gods something we can see for ourselves? Why did the goddess Demera even possess a scarecrow last time…….?”\nThis time it’s Kim Jae-hyuk. The cadets had witnessed the goddess Demera appearing in front of farmers to bless the land.\nThat’s not all. Recently, the Heilong People’s Republic, which had been in the midst of a war also started to believe in the goddess Demera and she purified the land contaminated by miasma.\nLeon asked again.\n“There are many gods in the Great Hall of the Ten Thousand Gods, and there are many who do not appear. Does that mean they don’t exist?”\n“They are real…aren’t They?”\n“Why, you have not seen them yourself.”\n“Your Majesty has seen them.”\n“What guarantee do you have that this king is not telling you a lie?”\n“…….”\nJae-hyuk was speechless at his words.\n“Because the gods of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods are good.”\nAt Chun So-yeon words, Leon’s gaze turned to her.\n“They give you benefits?”\n“Yes. They answer prayers, perform miracles, and prove their existence, unlike other religions.”\nChun So-yeon goal in staying with the guild was the Holy Law and many cadets were similar.\n“Chun So-yeon, you obviously serve gods of war and flame & light and justice. Have you received an answer from them?”\n“I haven’t yet, because I lacked…….”\n“Lacking what?”\nLeon asked, and Chun So-yeon didn’t know what to say.\n“Faith… I guess.”\n“You’re not wrong but you are decisively mistaken.”\nLeon said, turning to the cadets.\n“I’m not a god to work miracles, I’m a god to reward you for your faith.”\nLeon raised his hand. It was a light gesture.\n-A clap!\nThe clouds rumbled, and rain fell. Lightning struck the dry sky and the rain poured down.\n“……!”\nThe cadets were stunned by the downpour, but even more so by what happened next.\nThe rain was falling like a downpour, but it wasn’t getting Leon or any of the cadets wet. It was as if there was an invisible wall between them, and not a single drop of rain fell.\n“Is this proof of God, is this proof of reality? The criminals might think that the gods will grant what they wish and pray for.”\nLeon added.\n“However, this king prayed for rain, but he did not ask that the rain not make him wet.”\n“What?”\nThe cadets gave him a questioning look. It was a miracle that rain fell in a dry sky, but wasn’t it a miracle of prayer that it missed them?\n“It’s not because I prayed that I didn’t get wet. It’s because the gods bowed to me. I didn’t want my ankles to get wet in the rain.”\nLeon clarified the distinction.\n“Don’t look for proof that God is real. Don’t try to make a deal with God. God is not a wish box that gives you what you want.”\nIn a way, it was the foundation of religion.\nYou pray because you want a miracle from God.\nYou believe in God because you want something.\nWhether you want to go to heaven, be reincarnated into a higher caste in your next life, or be given 72 sex slaves with eternal virginity.\nYou have faith because you believe that no matter how filthy your wish, it will be granted.\n“Whatever god you believe in is up to you. It doesn’t have to be a god from the Pantheon. Yahweh, Buddha, Allah, none of them have been seen to be real, but their teachings are great.”\nLeon doesn’t deny the existence of existing Earth gods. How can he be sure that they are real, even if they are invisible?\nWhat he is talking about is the attitude toward them.\n“There’s nothing wrong with any kind of faith. But be careful.”\nLeon wants to make a clear distinction in the difference between a pantheon and a cult.\n“Beware of false prophets who tell you the cost of believing in God.”\nThat is true faith.\nJust form your faith in good faith.\nLeon’s lesson was easy to understand but difficult to practice.\n* * * *\nAfter the faith education, Leon began the final lesson of the day.\n“Today you will go through a process of connecting with the gods you believe in, as a first step to mastering the Holy Law.”\nThe students cheered at Leon’s words. Some of the cadets, he noticed, did a somewhat irreverent drip, referring to their faith as a power-up.\n“Ordinarily, this would be done through monasticism or knight order, but the gods have granted you an exception. You will have the opportunity to cultivate the virtues and manifest the powers of the gods you believe in.”\nMost cadets chose the gods of light and justice & war and flame, for they were the easiest to serve as knights.\nThe gods Arianna and Petos taught the aspiring knights the code they must live by, a code of justice that the sea had already taught them time and time again.\n[Greetings, my young knight candidates]\n“Whoa, whoa, whoa! Goddess?!”\n“Zee, I hear a real voice!”\n[Hush, children, so that you may be horsemen of this war]\n“Pe, Petos!”\n“God of War!”\nOne by one, the cadets experienced their brief connection to the gods.\nThe gods’ special favor and Leon’s holy law prowess made up for the burden, which would have been impossible for anyone but a priest or kingdom knight.\n‘Three Holy Knights, including this king. Not quite there yet.’\nAt the very least, I hope to find the owner of Georgic’s Hammer, or awaken a new Holy Knight or two.\nThe most likely scenario is that they are chosen by the two gods……..\n‘What happened to the other three?’\nHan Soo-ho, Chun So-yeon, and Kim Jae-hyuk are the others that Leon has his eye on, and he sees someone connected to the gods among them.\n“Soo-ho, I just spoke to the Goddess of Light and Justice!”\nHan Soo-ho and Arianna, the Goddess of Light and Justice had similar personalities.\n“Congratulations, Soo-ho.”\nHan Ha-ri had always been favored by the sea and war so this was nothing new and at the upcoming knighting ceremony she would be knighted.\nThere was another problem. While most of the cadets were happy to hear the voice of the gods, there were two who could not.\n“…….”\n“…….”\nThey’re not shy, but they look around in embarrassment. This is because they could see their classmates, except for them, connecting with the gods and staring into thin air with curious eyes.\nLeon had noticed that Kim Jae-hyuk and Chun So-yeon were not connected to any gods. To be precise──\n“Dangerous.”\nWhy, those two gods.\nIt was never a good thing when the most powerful and the most dangerous gods among the countless gods in the Hall of Ten Thousand Gods were interested.\n* * * *\nThe end of the 20th century, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the outbreak of the Gulf War.\nThere were other big events, such as the British return to Hong Kong and the death of Kim Il Sung, but they were all overshadowed by the Cataclysm.\nThe Cataclysm brought many things to the modern world, but it also caused a major upheaval in the religious world.\nWhere is God?\nOf course, the answer to this is written in all the holy books, the Buddhist scriptures, the Quran, the Vedas, etc.\nThis is also a test.\nThis is karma from previous lives.\nThis is a judgment for our sins.\nThis too shall pass, this too is a process of sifting.\nFor every absurdity in the world, there was a suitable excuse, and people followed their religions and believed the stories of their ministers.\nIn the end, the cataclysmic event came and went with the existing religions unscathed but even new religions were not spared.\n“My lord.”\n“Speak.”\n“The final list of recruits for this draft.”\nNeatly trimmed, all-black hair and kindly gaze and a smiling face.\nThe middle-aged man, with his clean-cut suit and calm demeanor, held the subordinate’s gaze as he read his report.\nThen he asked a simple question.\n“That’s less than I thought.”\n“Is it…….”\nThe draft was not a 100% guaranteed check to join the guild, but this quarter’s draft acceptance rate was much lower than last year’s.\n“What’s causing this?”\n“Our……experts have analyzed it, and they believe it’s due to the increased interest in the TTG Guild.”\n“I see.”\nSome might ask why the draft’s low acceptance rate is to blame.\nCertainly, it is true that the TTG Guild took an unprecedented number of cadets in this draft.\nHowever, “acceptance rate” is not the same thing as the number of people who refused to join.\nThe reason for this was the overlap between the concepts of TTG Guild and Hanbit.\nIn many ways, Hanbit Palace, a Korean top 10 guild and emerging religious organization founded 20 years ago by S-class hunter Park Yong-shin, has followed a similar path to the TTG Guild.\nThe guild leader, Park Yong-shin, is the leader of the organization, preaching teachings and establishing religious doctrine.\nThey were an emerging religious organization where the guild leader is also the leader and preaches the word of God.\nNo wonder there were so many people who were torn between the two seemingly similar guilds and ended up in the TTG GUild.\n“Did you say Leon Dragonia Lionheart?”\n“Yes, the survivor of the Otherworld.”\nAka the Lionheart King of the Fantasy World, the agent of the Ten Thousand Gods and the strongest knight king ever.\nHe beheaded an Archdemon with a strike and fought the Archduke of Demons one-on-one.\nBut apart from that, his impact on Korean society was incomparably greater.\nHe brought up the land contaminated with miasma, especially in the Naju Plain, and then cleaned it up and sold the blessed crops it produced.\nThe tax issue, which most of the top ten guilds are united in pushing for, is being pushed through by the president alone.\nEven the President and the heads of the largest companies in the industry are overly lenient… or fearful… when it comes to the TTG Guild and Leon.\n“Leon Dragonia Lionheart…….”\nYong-shin repeated the name.\nIn only five months old they grew too much and too fast.\nNow they were only lacking in the talent pool of A-grade Hunters, but they were still the size of dozens of guilds.\n“By the way, one of our sect members is there, right?”\n“Yes, he was the number one pick in this draft after Chun So-yeon.”\n“And he’s over there.”\n“……Sorry.”\nThe man, Park Yong-shin, didn’t express much regret; he simply gave different instructions through his silence.\n“I’ll take care of it.”\nThere was no need to give any instructions.\nThey were one of the top ten guilds and after two decades of expansion, the palace of a large religious organization with 1.6 million members nationwide would do whatever it took to resolve any discomfort even if that means crushing an up-and-coming rival.",

      "content": "Chapter 103: Foolish Organisms\nAfter Leon’s lesson, the knight cadets had a spontaneous review session with each other.\nThe topic was the relationship between faith and the Holy Law.\n“But isn’t it a contradiction to want faith and not expect anything in return? The Holy Law requires faith.”\n“Isn’t that what His Majesty Leon was saying, that the quid pro quo is predicated on faith, but not on prayer? You asked for rain, but you didn’t pray that you wouldn’t get wet.”\n“Is that what it boils down to, the gods take care of those who believe?”\nChun So-yeon was speechless as she watched Kim Jae-hyuk and Han Soo-ho discuss the matter. When she didn’t say anything, Jae-hyuk, who would normally be coldly poking holes in her, asked her bluntly.\n“Don’t you have an opinion?”\n“……I don’t know.”\nChun So-yeon was puzzled.\nShe naturally compared the beliefs of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild to conventional religions.\nBelieve and you’ll go to heaven, make an offering and you’ll be saved. If you blow yourself up, you get 72 sex slaves with infinite virginity.\nBasically, religion rewards faith.\nWhen you dig deeper, it tends to emphasize the size of your faith or evidence, but for atheists, it’s more of a pay-to-play system.\nInstead of answering the question, Chun So-yeon raises a new one.\n“How do you prove faith? Who can measure its size?”\n“A note…an offering?”\n“They say a coin from a poor widow is worth more than a bag of gold from a rich man’s offering.”\nIn short, it’s about seeing how sincere you are in your circumstances.\nJin-hyuk retorted.\n“You’re talking about the Ten Commandments.”\n“…….”\n“……”\nIt’s one thing to say they don’t take money but the TTG Guild blatantly wanted proof of faith from its followers.\nIt wanted tribute, it wanted the loyalty of a soldier, it wanted the honor of a knight.\nOf course, the Decalogue is not the Decalogue at face value, but…….\n“In the end, that’s it, just give us your faith, and we’ll take care of you. What kind of unreasonable deal is that?”\nChen So-yeon criticized in a sharp voice. It would be more convenient for her to offer material goods and have her wishes fulfilled.\nShe was the granddaughter of the Divine Sword Guild leader, the next head of the Divine Sword Guild. If she set her mind to it, she could make more offerings than everyone in the Ten Thousand Gods Guild combined.\nIf she wanted to honor the gods, she could go out and slit the throats of monsters herself.\nWhatever she wanted, she could accomplish it but faith was different.\n“Isn’t this the key?”\nSoo-ho pointed out what Leon had been trying to say throughout the lesson.\n“Don’t try to make a deal. I think you’re pointing out the attitude of hoping for something and having faith.”\nIt was a terrible phrase, one that shut down any action that Chun So-yeon could do because she and countless others put their faith in God without expecting anything in return.\nEveryone is equal before the gods but Chen So-yeon found it unreasonable.\n* * * *\nProtestantism, Buddhism, and other miscellaneous religions exist, but they are always wary of new religions entering their territory.\nApart from that, the attitude of the citizens towards the TTG Guild is quite favorable, even the religious ones.\n-Honestly, there could be gods in this world.\n-What if the Lionhearted King is lying?\n-If he’s bullshitting, isn’t that a masterful performance? I’m not saying he was ready to start bullshitting about religion as soon as he crossed over.\nIt’s no secret that the Lionhearted King’s eccentricities are well known to all who know him.\nFortunately, 21st century Koreans are pretty tolerant of cultural relativism.\n-You don’t believe me when I tell you that just eating rice will cure your illness?\n-That could be otherworldly technology.\n-Watch this interview with an old man who farms in Naju.\n-It’s all a bunch of bullshit.\nThe public reaction is favorable. The gods of the pantheon have already proven themselves to be real enough, and the miracles they perform cannot be explained by anything other than ‘miracles’.\nBut what about the government’s stance on accepting these otherworldly deities and allowing them to proselytize?\n-Just keep him out of the presidential race.\n-Except for politics, give him everything he asks for!\n-The power of the TTG Guild is astounding. Even Lionheart’s own powers are considered to be at least S-class, including the ability to destroy demons known to be immortal.\n-And what about his subordinates? The Magician Queen alone could make the Lord of the Magic Tower prostate before her.\n-The Yakt Spinner is relatively quiet, apparently unable to recover from his loss at Cheongju Gate.\nMost of all, it’s the incredible rise in power of the D-ranked Hunters that has catapulted them to C-rank. Their rise to power will greatly benefit the national interest.\nThe government’s position is that they’ll support whatever Leon does as long as he stays out of politics and for good reason since the dominance of large guilds in South Korea is nothing new.\nThey have made many demands on the government in the form of gate attacks and threatened to emigrate.\nRecently, more than half of the 10 largest guilds united behind the Gate Tax Reform Act… On the other hand, the TTG Guild standard of behavior is not for profit.\nThe TTG Guild is driven by doctrine and justice. This may seem like a strange thing to say in the 21st century, but that’s exactly what they, driven by the absolute charisma of Leon, did.\nThe problem was the religious establishment.\n“What the hell, those people.”\n“What’s wrong with them?”\nBut today’s visitors included some rather frowned upon people.\n“Thy mercy come down, come down!”\n“Thy mercy like the spring rain!”\n“Thy mercy encompasses me!”\nStanding out from the bustling crowd, even in the midst of a noisy holy site, was a group with microphones and musical instruments, shouting.\n“What are they doing?”\n“Trampling on the ground at TTG Guild…….”\nIt’s a common occurrence in South Korea.\nPeople enter other religious facilities, sing gospel songs, dance, and disrupt traffic.\nThey physically ostracize those they see as heretics by smashing Buddha statues, burning cultural artifacts, or simply knocking over sacrificial statues that recreate traditions.\nIf anyone tried to stop them, they would treat them as heretics and even assault them, so it’s no wonder they didn’t want to get involved.\n-What were they doing?\nApproaching the commotion was Yappy, the ringleader of the TTG Guild.\nHe warned the rioters who were conducting a live trampling.\n-Your noise level has reached the nuisance level. Restrain yourself.\n“For we love you. Know and enlighten. Because we must go to paradise together. Because it is the will of God.”\n-???\nThe expressionless mechanical spider’s inner thoughts were revealed.\n-Warned again. Quickly stop making noise. No musical instruments were allowed.\nMore than 10,000 people visit the park every day. Naturally, disturbances happen, and as many hunters gather here as there are, there are fights.\nBut this is where the Cheongju killing machine, the Yakt Spinner, comes in. A swift, calculated kill is Yappy’s specialty.\nBut they responded to his warnings by bursting into hymns.\n“The devil tests your faith! Reject heresy!”\n-…….\nYappy wondered as they grew more vocal. What could they possibly believe?\n-Crazy organisms.\nIt was an ultimatum. Yappy’s robotic arm was unveiled, its distinctive wires strung out. It was non-lethal, but it could subdue a decent Hunter.\n“That cold machine is possessed by the devil, and in the name of my lord, it shall die tonight!”\nTheir dominance was short-lived.\nYappy was unrelenting in his punishment of those who failed to heed his three warnings as wires shot out like a net and fell upon them relentlessly.\n* * * * *\n-Don’t come in front of me.\n“That, that devil!”\n-Want to turn around?\nAfter being beaten and chased away from the entrance of the temple, they cursed and ran out of the temple at a fast pace.\nWhen they reached the parking lot, a man came running up to them, panting.\n“Brother Kwang-tae, you’ve been swearing!”\n“Brother Dongshik, did you do a good job?”\n“Of course.”\nDongshik pulled out his cell phone and waved it around, the screen clearly showing Yappy subduing them by force.\n“Brother Kwang-tae, is this enough?”\n“Hmph, enough.”\nThis was the reason for their rampage in the TTG Guild.\nThey shouted and trampled, then waited for the bad-tempered robot to take over by force.\nAfter that, it’s all downhill from there.\nAccuse him of assault and tear down his entire shrine. There will be some testimony, but it doesn’t matter.\n‘It’s just a minority opinion with a commenting army.’\n‘Besides, we’re the ones who were assaulted.’\nAt best, they’re guilty of insult, and at worst, they’re guilty of violence.\n“What ignorant heretics. They don’t know the law in Korea.”\nPark Kwang-tae, the Hanbit Palace evangelist who organized the whole thing, smiled with satisfaction.\nThis wasn’t the last time. From now on, the Hanbit Palace will put pressure on TTG Guild in all directions.\nNo matter how well TTG Guild has been doing lately, it’s still a young guild without strong pillars.\nThey are no match for a guild that has been around for 20 years.\n“Everything is for the sake of the Lord…….”\n“”Everything is for the sake of the Lord…….””\nThey went straight to the police station and accused the TTG Guild of assault, and immediately launched a public relations campaign.\n* * * * *\n[TTG Guild, assaulting tourists!]\n[TTG Guild accused of massive tax evasion].\n[What kind of a person is King Lionheart, the head priest of TTG Guild!]\nKim Gun-tae, an Internet newspaper reporter, couldn’t help but chuckle at the scoops he was about to post.\nThese articles were commissioned by the Hanbit Palace, which had connections to the newspaper, and they showed the will of the Hanbit Palace.\n‘It’s annoying.’\nI figured they’d clash at some point.\nSince the Cataclysm, several new religions have sprung up in Korea, with the Hanbit Palace being the largest and most powerful.\nThey are not only a religious organization, but also a hunter’s guild, and a very successful one at that.\nIn the eyes of the TTG Guild, they are the seniors to look up to. Of course, seniors are not obligated to help juniors.\nIn any case, TTG Guild’s recent behavior must have been quite disturbing to the Hanbit Palace.\nKim Gun-tae had a hunch that not only his own newspaper, but the Korean media as a whole, would be reporting something sinful.\n“Well, since he’s an otherworlder, he’ll be helpless against the propaganda.”\nHis Majesty Leon will pay a high price for this. In the 21st century, nothing is more expensive than an image.\nIn the end, the outcome of this confrontation will depend on how far Hanbit Palace is willing to go to bash the TTG Guild.\nPoor guy, but he’s only doing what he’s paid to do.\nAside from the money, Kim Gun-tae also had a small inferiority complex.\n‘He’s handsome, he’s fucking rich, and he’s got a lot of money, so why shouldn’t we fuck with him?’\nI wonder how he feels in the midst of all the articles and unsubstantiated scandals that are popping up. It’s just a shame we don’t get to see it.\n“Oh, is he going to hold a press conference?”\nWhat could be more fun for a journalist than to bring down a celebrity?\nYou get to use your own brush to bring them down. Wouldn’t that be considered a victory over Leon?\n‘The paintbrush is mightier than the sword.’\nThe moment he hit enter, Kim giggled as he thought of the views and incentives that would explode.\n“Joatsu~”\nTen seconds after hitting enter Kim Gun-tae couldn’t stop his curiosity and pressed F5 on the page where his article was posted.\nHe made the title as provocative and aggro as possible, so maybe there would be comments already──\n“What?”\n[It’s a deleted page]\n“Huh?”\nWhat the hell is this?\nKim refreshed again, but nothing changed.\nAfter six tries, he realized: his article had been deleted.\n‘What, what, did they catch me with an illegal promotional program?’\nIt couldn’t be. His online news organization had never been taken down for running ads for gambling sites or pornography.\nAs he hurriedly reposted the article, he received another shocking message.\n[Your account has been deleted]\n“What?”\nThere was no time to be surprised. Suddenly, the lights and electronics in Kim’s building went out.\n“A power outage?”\nAt this time?\nKim Gun-tae and other reporters screamed, but suddenly, the power went out in a small area all over the country. And five minutes of silence from all media organizations in Korea.\n[XX news agency’s ugly nakedness. Illegal non-fund deposit route. Where is the truth?]\n[Suspicious funds transferred to XXX reporter of OO news agency. The end of the transfer route?]\n[The identity of the passerby who went on a rampage at TTG Guild is Evangelist Park of Hanbit Palace].\nInternet public opinion, You Tube, Jinstagram, Twitta… All Internet sites that modern people in the 21st century can access began to be flooded.\n* * * *\nJae-hyuk was born into a fairly well-to-do family.\nSpecializing in subcontracting for large companies his father’s side of the family had a lot of good clients, so you could say he was born with a pair of spoons.\nUntil Jae-hyuk entered Hunter Academy, things were going well for the family but when his father died his family began a rapid downward spiral.\n“Whoa…….”\nIn a residential neighborhood in Incheon there was a long-lost relative’s house that was old and shabby as he remembers.\n“I came because you said to come, but…….”\nHe couldn’t get used to this damn neighborhood. In fact, he grew up in an expensive, rich neighborhood in Seoul.\nNowadays, apartment prices have risen, but Jae-hyuk’s house hasn’t benefited from that, and he’s sold it.\nThe company he inherited, the land he owned, the apartment… everything was sold.\nThe business didn’t fail. It wasn’t that he needed a loan, or that he had a guarantee.\n‘That damn religion.’\nHanbit Palace, his mother’s religion, was an emerging religion that worships the system as the will of the gods and has S-class hunter Park Yong-shin as its leader.\nJae-hyuk’s mother was so devoted to this religion that she gave her entire family’s wealth to the Hanbit Palace.\nWhen the family ran out of rice, Jae-hyuk enrolled in the academy to escape.\n“…….”\nJae-hyuk hesitantly knocked on the front door of the three underground rooms.\n“Is Jae-hyuk here?”\nA woman greeted him with a smile. As usual, Jae-hyuk’s heart sank at the sight of his mother’s bright smile.\nThe moment he saw his mother-──\n[Punish her!]\nThe voice of a man who growled and didn’t hide his anger resonated in his heart like thunder.\nIn the religious education class a few days ago Jae-hyuk had heard the voice of God.\nOnly, he couldn’t tell anyone, so he clamped his mouth shut.\n[Bring down heavenly punishment, for that is the test given to you]\nJae-hyuk was torn in the face of the God of Sky and Thunder wrath.",

      "content": "Chapter 104: Hanbit Palace\nWhen Jae-hyuk returned to the TTG Guild, he was troubled.\n[Return to the Hanbit Palace, they’ll make good use of you]\nOf course, if Jae-hyuk were to join the guild of the Hanbit Palace, they would treat him quite well.\nUnlike in the past, when he was just a pawn, he’s now a promising academy prospect.\nAt this age, he already has a B-grade Hunter’s Certificate, so he should be able to make it to A-grade without too much trouble, and if he does well, he could even aim for S-grade.\nBut Jae-hyuk knew what the Hanbit Palace was like.\nFrom a young age, he’d been led by his mother to attend all sorts of religious prayers and retreats, receiving an education that bordered on brainwashing, but as his mind hardened, he realized this wasn’t right.\nSo he ran away, joined the academy, and deliberately disconnected. Not completely, but he used training and exams as an excuse to cut off contact.\nThen came the senior draft and he tore up the application form his mother had given me to join the Hanbit Guild and entered the TTG Guild.\n“Hah…….”\nWhen Leon first stood up in front of the class and told us about his guild and his faith, he thought that he was like the Hanbit Palace but now he knew that the gods that the TTG Guild worshiped were real while the Hanbit Palace was a cult full of sociopaths.\nIt wasn’t just his mother’s insistence that he return to Hanbit.\nIt’s because of the god who spoke to him after his religion class.\n[They’re a bunch of sneaky heretics, a bunch of sociopaths. Punish her.]\n“……she’s my mother.”\n[There’s more to life than information from blood relatives! Heretics are unforgivable cardinal sinners!]\nJae-hyuk originally believed in the God of Light and Justice. He offered the Ten Commandments to her, and practiced the teachings and codes according to her standards.\nBut on the day Leon connected the knight cadets to the gods…Jae-hyuk was connected to a different god than the Goddess of Light and Justice.\n‘Why would the God of Sky and Thunder connect to me…….?’\nUltima, God of the sky and thunder, this unruly god connected to Jae-hyuk gave him a command.\n[Punish the sociopaths! They will be punished by heaven!]\nJae-hyuk didn’t know how he, a mere cadet, was going to punish Hanbit, and that included his own mother.\n“Damn it…….”\nOn the way back to TTG Guild Jae-hyuk bumps into someone and reflexively ducks his head.\n“I’m sorry──”\n“You visited your home?”\n“Huh?”\nAt the familiar voice Jae-hyuk’s eyes widened as he slowly raised his head in a stupid reaction.\n“Your Majesty?!”\nLeon was staring at Jae-hyuk in surprise.\n* * * *\n“I understand the situation. Indeed, it has come to that.”\nJae-hyuk confessed everything to Leon, who came to him with half an idea.\nThat he had been a devotee of the Hanbit Palace for a long time, that his mother was forcing him to return to Hanbit and that Ultima, the God of Thunder, was ordering their punishment.\nAs Jae-hyuk faced Leon, he realized that he was the only one he could talk to.\n“Thunder,” he said, “even so, how can you condemn a child to a thousand years of karma?”\n[I am the heavens, who can discuss the karma of the heavens]\nLeon shrugged his shoulders in agreement, but he was not at ease.\n“If thou wilt punish the heretics, leave it to me.”\n[No, I want my child to wash his filthy heresy with his own hands; I want him to give his will to me].\nUltima, god of the sky and thunder, was one of the most powerful of the pantheon of gods, and a fiercely principled man.\nLeon knew it wouldn’t be easy to convince Ultima, especially when it came to sociopaths and demons, whose attitudes were almost as repulsive as his own.\n“Kim Jae-hyuk, why did you not confess to this king that day?”\n“Because I thought he might …….”\nJae-hyuk would have had no choice but he was too afraid of the consequences to tell Leon.\nJae-hyuk had seen what Leon had done to the orcs and demons, and to the Beast God’s heretics.\n“I’ve heard there’s a group that’s been pulling the same stunt lately.”\n“What? No way…….”\n“Lord Spinner has made it clear. They have already declared war on this king and the gods.”\n“Your Grace… my mother is…….”\nLeon cut Jae-hyuk off with a hand gesture.\n“This king is not a madman who kills randomly. I will hold them accountable.”\nSeeing is believing.\nLeon stood up and turned to Jae-hyuk.\n“Where is their cathedral?”\n* * * *\nHanbit Palace, this new religion, born after the Cataclysm, views the System as God’s will and salvation.\nThey claim that the Awakened Hunters and the System that guides them to close the gates is a miracle of God.\nIn the post-Cataclysmic era, the Hanbit Palace has sneaked its way into the lives of the modern world.\nThe Hunters they admire and the fact that the system that modern science cannot decipher was a message from the gods, an aid of some sort, was not a claim without credibility.\nIn fact, many scholars had speculated that the system and the gates were the work of a transcendent being.\n“So I said, ‘You can’t even do that, so how do you expect to be saved? Just believe. Don’t doubt, just believe, and you will be saved.’”\n“Salvation!”\n“Salvation!”\n“You want to be saved? Believe. Only believe. Believe my words and do only what I command, and you will all be saved!”\nPark Yong-shin, a priest of the Hanbit Palace was born in 1990 and he experienced a cataclysmic event at the age of twelve.\nIn those turbulent times, when there was no academy yet and everything was learned by doing, he made a name for himself as a promising Class A Hunter.\nIt was in the winter of 2014 that he met God.\nA fluctuation gate occurred in Samcheok.\nAt this gate, where the difficulty level suddenly changed, Park Yong-shin lost all his teammates and was on the verge of death but then Hanbit Palace Master Park Yong-shin heard a voice.\n[Do you want salvation?]\nHe answered the voice, and the voice’s owner granted him grace.\nHe was the seventh S-class Hunter to emerge in Korea, and the organization he founded is now Hanbit Palace.\n“He bears witness that He is real; look at the warriors of God who are favored by Him; listen to the gospel the moment they enter the gate.”\nAnd indeed, the Hanbit Palace does perform miracles. It’s a variation on a system called Divine Guidance, to be precise.\nOne Hunter testified at the podium.\n“It was an ordinary gate, but the moment I entered the gate, unlike the other hunters, my system went haywire.”\nIn a gate that would normally be a simple matter of defeating a boss and mining magic stones, the hunter followed the system’s guidance and explored the dungeon, with surprising results.\n“Hidden rewards. Discovering that treasure trove changed my life, and it’s all by His grace!”\n“Alas…….”\n“By God…….”\nThis was a common occurrence for hunters in the Hanbit Palace.\nMost of them received a different system message upon entering the dungeon, and it saved their lives, or gave them treasures.\nThis was not just an isolated case, but a phenomenon centered around the Hanbit Palace, and even the Hunter Association had notarized it, so it was not difficult for the Hanbit Palace to expand its power.\nPark Yong-shin stood on the Hunter’s podium to testify.\n“And that’s not all,” he said, “a cure-all herb for an ailing old woman, a miraculous growth for an incompetent Hunter.”\nIf this is not a miracle of God, then what is? My very existence is proof of it!\nBelievers hang on Park’s every word.\nEven those who were cynical, calling him a fraud, drooled as he brought up cases that had even made the news.\nThat’s why they give money to non-believers, come to dawn prayers, and pay their extra quarter.\nBecause they want to be a part of that miracle. They want to have a miracle of their own.\n“Hmm?”\nPark Yong-shin was in the middle of a sermon when he noticed a blond man in the congregation who stood out from the crowd.\nNext to him, a silver-haired woman in a cotton robe and a spider-like machine were tapping away at a hymnal.\n‘TTG Guild? What are they doing?’\nPark Yong-shin continued his sermon, inwardly admiring the dignity and steady posture that exuded from Leon.\n“Your Majesty.”\n“Hmm…….”\nBeatrice nudged him, but Leon was lost in his own thoughts.\n‘Sociopaths.’\nThey are everywhere. Parasites who prey on the plight of the people, burrowing into the cracks of their hearts and minds, preaching false doctrine and filling their mouths.\nOne of Leon’s greatest abhorrences is the cults of miscellaneous gods that spring up in the most inhospitable places.\nBy nature, divinity is fed by faith, not by material things. Why would a god need money?\nOf course, they need it to run the church since priests are human and need to eat but to ask for money in such a crude and undignified manner.\nIf it were only money, he would have passed them off as lowly but Leon found the whole idea distasteful and suspicious.\n“There, Brother. You are a very important visitor.”\nPark’s gaze met Leon’s.\n“This is your first time here, brother, and you are supposed to be baptized.”\nPark Yong-shin had the audacity to invite Leon to the pulpit and Leon was happy to oblige.\nAs he approached the pulpit, he pulled a sack out of subspace. He then threw it onto the podium.\nThe contents of the sack dripped with rainwater. It was a large wad of cash.\n“…… What the hell is this?”\n“Work a miracle.”\n“What?”\n“I thought you said you could experience a miracle if you gave an offering. Go ahead and do it.”\n“That’s rude.”\nPark Yong-shin frowned at Leon’s outburst and glanced at the camera filming him.\n‘Idiot. Your every move will be recorded.’\nAlthough the Hanbit Palace had been labeled as a semi-cult by the world, there was a reason people could deny it.\nIndeed, its followers received a different system message at the gate, one that brought them benefits.\n“You try to test God’s miracles with a mere sacrifice.”\n“Isn’t it your god who demands material goods and faith for salvation? I find the idea of trading with a god disgusting, but I will trade with your god for once.”\n“…….”\nPark did not hide his displeasure.\nHow dare a medieval barbarian, who worshiped a pagan god, insult his god.\n“Did you say that you can go to heaven with loyalty and devotion, and that you will have your place according to your offerings?”\n“Heaven is only the reward of the believer, the salvation of the chosen!”\n“And you are the chosen one?”\n“You must obey and submit to your pastor, and only then can you reach heaven; that is the truth, the gospel!”\n“A servant of God identifies himself with God, who gave you that right!”\nHeaven, as he knows it, is paradise and to enter it, he had to be true to himself.\nSlaying pagans and giving lots of money would not absolve him of his sins.\nThe more you give, the more space you get in heaven.\nWhen he heard that to prove his faith, he had to be willing to go down to the bottom of the pit, he couldn’t help but laugh.\n“What a shallow, sleepy faith.”\nPark didn’t dare to retort to Leon’s stern words.\nIt wasn’t for lack of arguments. The Church’s arguments were invincible, built on a tableau of unconditional faith and insubstantial salvation but his instincts told him that the being in front of him would not allow it.\nHis flimsy arguments were stifled by the fierce gaze and angry majesty but that was okay. He had a winning argument.\n“Unbelievers! Heretics! Minions of evil are invading our temple! This evil must be driven out of the house of the Lord!”\nThousands of church members rose to their feet in response to Park’s shout. They unleashed a searing fury on the unbeliever who had insulted their faith.\n“Get away, you evil thing, this is God’s house!”\n“That’s right, back off!”\n“Filthy bastard, His wrath shall drown you in boiling blood!”\nLeon bore the jeers of the socialites in silence.\nContemplating the nature of the being that these poor, foolish men’s ugly faith supported.\nBut\n“You stupid, foolish──”\nThere is something about insults that can never be accepted.\n“──Devil…!”\n“……!”\n-……chuckle!\n“……hut.”\nHe instinctively read the stunned gaze focused on me and the change in the atmosphere.\nSomething… something was wrong.\n“This lowly thing…….”\nThere are three insults that Leon could never accept.\nOne is parental insults.\nAs the son of Wulfric Dragonia, the great Grand Duke of Dragonia, any insult to them is an insult to his family.\nThe second is blasphemy against the gods.\nHow could mortals insult the gods? Sometimes those who did so were tongue-tied, dismembered, and dried in the sun.\nFinally,\nLeon takes the insults directed at him surprisingly lightly.\nIt is the king’s sin, his immorality, that the vegetation has dried up on this land, that lightning has fallen, that there is a drought.\nA king makes no excuses. A king does not evade. A king does not shift blame.\nHe only takes responsibility, for that is the place of a king.\nEven insults against him were blamed on his own immorality, not his sin but…….\n“How dare you. You… you lowly bastards… you socializing bunch…….”\nHe said he could take any insult.\n“Comparing this Lionheart King to the devil!”\nI will never allow myself to be called a demon. Never! Never!\n“I will punish you for your shallow faith and shallowness! The guidance of the divine stars shall purify you!”\n“Your Majesty…here?”\nBeatrice asked, but Leon had already drawn his holy sword.\nThe hilt of the holy sword streaked light everywhere, projecting celestial movements──\n“The holy relic of Saint Anak shall guide the stars!”\nThe necklace in Leon’s grasp suddenly shot an immense amount of light into the sky. The next moment──\n* * * * *\nMr. Watanabe, an employee of JAXA, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, was doing his usual celestial observations when he noticed a strange movement.\nIdentification number M85-HCCI.\nThe comet, which had been spotted six months earlier, was scheduled to graze the Earth until today.\nDubbed Comet Mickey in honor of its original discoverer, Dr. Mickey of the University of Michigan in the U.S……..\n“Did it change its orbit?”\nWatanabe rushed to report the sudden change in orbit.\n“That’s nonsense! Why would a comet that was passing by just fine suddenly come this way?”\n“Well, to be precise, it’s on the Korean Peninsula──”\n“Who cares! It’s over six kilometers across! It’s going to blow us all away, not to mention the Joseon Peninsula!”\nThis was a 6 kilometer long comet and the comet that ended the Cretaceous period was over 10 kilometers long, so a comet of this size would at least blow away all of Asia!\nThe aftermath would be enough to warrant a discussion of human extinction!\n“Comet Mickey, it’s accelerating! It’s passing through Earth’s gravitational field in less than three minutes! It’s going to hit!”\n“We’re all dead!”\nAt this point, all of the world’s space agencies were reacting similarly.",

      "content": "Chapter 105: Wicked, Build to Ruin\n“The holy relic of Saint Anak shall guide the stars!”\nIn the Paradise of the Gods, Leon received three gifts from the Sage of the Forest, Gunnar, aside from the “seedling.”\nThe first was the bridle of Argent Majesty the Lionheart, the ultimate treasure for a horseman blossoming into his full potential.\nSecond, a training manual on hunting giants as a serf of Lord Gratas.\nAnd finally, the Necklace of Saint Anak, a servant of a great god, chosen from among countless priests and priestesses.\nThere was only one in a generation and the necklace’s power was a simple yet devastating miracle: Guiding Stars.\nSensing the time and the hour, they alter the orbits of the stars.\nThey sense the celestial bodies of the universe by reading the voyages of the stars and guide them with the power of the Sisters’ necklaces.\nThe falling star is heading straight for the Hanbit Palace. But only a few people know that.\nLeon, who summoned the star, Beatrice, Yappy, and Kim Jae-hyuk, who were told about it beforehand.\nThe rest…the poor space employees who are still observing the celestial bodies, reading the rapid drift of the stars, and calling for the destruction of humanity.\n“Ha, what are you saying?”\n“I think the devil’s out of his mind!”\nTwo minutes had passed since Leon shouted. The others were intimidated by Leon’s enthusiasm, but they soon turned on him and mocked him.\n“Lord Yappy get ready.”\n-Giggles.\nBeatrice and Yappy reacted differently. Beatrice stretched out her hand, and a bolt of frenzied magic blew the ceiling of the cathedral off in an instant.\n“Mu, what did you do!”\nThe worshippers of the Hanbit Palace tried to stop Beatrice, but the silver threads centered around her blocked their path.\nYappy protected Beatrice with a tactical maneuver.\n“I’ll pull the star’s orbit this way.”\nA circle of magic spreads out around Beatrice. The transcendent magic she’s been preparing for since entering the cathedral connects with Leon’s sheath and necklace.\nIf the scabbard reads the course of the heavens and the necklace corrects their orbits, Beatrice’s role is to fine-tune them.\nAs she summons the stars, the sacred code that specifies the coordinates for destroying the enemies of the kingdom is passed down to Beatrice to be practiced.\nAnd they saw, even if they didn’t want to.\n“There, there…!”\n“Shooting stars?”\nIt was a giant star falling from above their heads and as it approached in real time, they couldn’t ignore it, even if they wanted to.\n“Ah, ah, ah…!”\n“Shi, divine punishment! God’s punishment is coming!”\nThey’re not wrong. Leon is an agent of the gods, and his punishment is divine.\n“Don’t flounder, you lowly things!”\nAll eyes are on Leon as he yells. The believers thought this was a punishment from their god, but Park Yong-shin thought otherwise.\n‘Suddenly? No! He can’t be punishing us!’\nPark Yong-shin raised his sword. He was one of Korea’s top S-class hunters. Not a desk-biter who lacks combat power.\n“What did you do?”\n“I summoned a star.”\n“That’s a lie…!”\n“We’ll see if it’s a lie or not.”\nIt sounded too good to be true. Summoning the stars, Meteor? Is such a thing possible with human power?\n“You’re going to kill us all, and you won’t be safe either!”\nThey didn’t know how big the star that was heading towards them was.\nTheir brief celestial knowledge tells them that most stars burn up as they enter the atmosphere… but would a massive star, visible to the naked eye, burn up and disappear?\n“Fear God’s punishment, foolish heretics, you will pay dearly.”\n“You’re crazy…!”\nWhen the comet strikes, it won’t be just one or two people who die. Cities… no, countries… maybe even all life on Earth would be wiped out!\n“Issue an evacuation order…….”\nThe worshippers of the Hanbit Palace, the citizens of the neighboring cities… Where do I start and where do I end?\nEven if we evacuate, isn’t it too late? How can we run away from that comet that looks like it has less than a minute to go before it hits?\n“God…….”\nPark Yong-shin has found God. The God who saved him from the gate, the God whose voice he had heard until now──\n[…….]\nAnd now, at this moment, the divinity of the Hanbit Palace spoke softly.\n“God?”\n[……crazy]\n“God???”\nIn the next moment, a light emanated from Leon, a light so intense that it was almost blinding to look at, a blast that rippled and spread menacingly…….\n“Beatrice.”\n“I’m ready.”\nSimilarly, a dark purplish aura radiated from Beatrice as a massive mist billows from her, the priestess of dreams and death, rising toward the shattered ceiling.\nAt the same time, a comet falls overhead and the sky turns black as the sunny weather fades.\nThe sky flashes golden with thunderclouds.\n-Boom!\nThunder crashes from above and darkness surges from below.\nThe two forces collide with the falling comet…and the comet’s nature is imbued with power but in the next moment, Yappy pulls a railgun from his carapace and points it at the comet.\n-Fires a transmutation power shot.\nIn the next moment, the comet, which hadn’t slowed down a bit, slammed into the Hanbit Palace.\n* * * *\nAs a general rule of thumb, if a 6-kilometer comet collides with Earth, the area around it is bound to be devastated.\nApophis, a 340-meter-diameter asteroid on the Turin scale, one of the biggest threats of the 21st century, is expected to be completely wiped out within 4 kilometers.\nConsidering that the damage of a celestial impact increases exponentially with size, the destructive force of a 6-kilometer comet on impact with Earth could wipe out the entire Korean Peninsula, as well as wipe out continents and archipelagos.\nAt that size, it’s not unreasonable to talk about human extinction.\nBut…….\nAt the moment of impact, all light and sound disappeared. Instead of screaming, the devotees of the Hanbit Palace opened their eyes in disbelief.\n“What the…!”\nThe comet from outer space, straight out of a failed cartoon, had not even burned up a little bit on its way through the atmosphere.\n“”?????””\n-What is this?\n-I don’t know.\nThe sight of the comet towering over the Hanbit Palace was so unreal that they couldn’t open my mouth for several minutes.\n“It’s definitely something.”\nBeatrice admires in a low voice and behind her, Yappy collects samples from the meteorite with his mechanical arm.\n-Component anomaly in action. Does not match any metal in the database.\nThis is the “metal of the gods” promised by Heto, the god of iron and blacksmiths. Indeed, this is what the Holy Knights used to forge their holy swords and armor.\nWith this, it would be possible to create a fuselage as strong as their own… or even stronger.\n“Hmm… This should be enough.”\nLeon looked at the star he had summoned and smiled with moderate satisfaction.\n“What is this…….?”\nPark Yong-shin was speechless at the meteorite in front of him. But then he saw something else.\n‘No one died?’\nA meteorite several kilometers long hit directly, and the only thing that collapsed was the building, but no one was killed by the shockwave.\nAnd that’s not all, there are worshippers emerging unharmed from the rubble.\nLeon stepped in front of him.\n“Foolish one,” he said, “but only foolish, for you know your sin.”\n“What, what…….?”\nA man summoned a meteorite and no one was killed by the meteorite. Park Yong-shin could only cower in front of Leon, who had performed a miracle in his human form.\nLeon’s gaze pierced through Park as his clenched fists trembled and his grinding teeth chattered.\nIt’s clear that this man is feeling an uncontrollable rage.\nThe animal instinct to flee in the face of an overwhelming opponent is stirred.\n“Come out.”\nHis finger points at Park Yong-shin but his gaze is beyond Park Yong-shin.\n“Kim Jae-hyuk!”\n“Yes? Yes!”\nThe pouty-haired boy rushed over as Leon grabbed him by the shoulders and pointed to Park Yong-shin.\n“You can see it now. A malignant species attached to him.”\n“Is that… Huh!”\nKim Jae-hyuk looked and saw that a grotesque creature, like a parasitic growth of cells, had taken up residence on Park Yong-shin’s back.\nThe star that sailed under divine guidance, and the energy it spread at the moment of collision, have transformed the area into something otherworldly.\nThat’s why Jae-hyuk was able to awaken the Divine Vision. In front of the Thunder God’s gaze that penetrates every detail, he saw a vicious beast laid bare.\n“What the hell is that…….?”\nIt’s a vicious creature that has been waiting for an opportunity to prey on its host for a long time.”\n“Jae-hyuk!”\nA woman appeared behind Jae-hyuk’s and Jae-hyuk looked at her.\n“Uh, Mom?”\nSomething similar clung to her.\n“You will be the one to punish the evil species that Thunder wishes to punish.”\n“Ha, but your majesty… then my mom will…….”\n“Trust in him, and let his great power be yours, be assured that it will be as you wish.”\nLeon said as Jae-hyuk swallowed hard and closed his eyes.\nFaith. Just believing.\nJae-hyuk reached out toward where his mother was.\nIt was only a suggestive gesture, a self-suggestion that blossoms from anxiety.\nMay the miracle I perform pierce only the evil species.\n“Lord Ultima…….”\nMay your wrath forgive the innocent.\nHoly Law <Heavenly Wrath>\nIn the next moment, a bolt of lightning struck his mother. It was a powerful lightning bolt that struck from the crown of his head, destroying the ground.\n“Kaaaahhhh…!”\nWhen Kim Jae-hyuk opened his eyes, Shin Sung-soo was gasping for breath and looked at her son with tears in her eyes.\n“Uh, Mom!”\nJae-hyuk rushed over and hugged her and she woke up to her son clutching her back.\n“Jae, Jae-hyuk. My son…….”\nMom is sorry. She must have been out of her mind.\nShe couldn’t understand all the things she had done and was ashamed of herself for the evil deeds she had done, as if possessed by a ghost.\n“Well done.”\nLeon smiled with rare satisfaction as he watched at the boy that had been chosen by Ultima.\n“Master of Thunder, who sits upon the throne of heaven.”\nLeon chanted and at that moment, the Master of the Heavens answered.\nThe clouds gathered, and a giant in human form and crowned with thunder raised a massive arm. In his hand he held a massive bolt of lightning that seemed capable of destroying the world.\n“Punishment for the wicked, relief for the lamb.”\n<Divine Punishment >\nThe giant’s lightning bolt struck the ground.\n* * * *\nIn the wreckage of the Hanbit Palace, where the thunderbolts rained down most of the worshippers tore off the evil being that had clung to them but there was a single survivor.\n“Heeeeeeee……!”\nPark Yong-shin…the host of all evil species.\nAt the moment of divine punishment, it had retrieved the evil spirits planted in the believers and inflated its own body, but it had barely withstood the thunderbolt with Park Yong-shin’s protection and recovery skills.\nNo, to say it withstood it would be an understatement.\nIt had only postponed its demise for a short time, and its decayed and charred flesh was falling off one by one, emitting an unbearable stench.\n“Gluttony, the Archdemon of gluttony and stinginess….”\nAmong the demons, disordered inquiry – the vice of wisdom and inquiry – and ugly lust – the vice of pleasure and corruption – are the ones that love to creep into society.\nThey infiltrate the spiritual souls of humans, germinate their seeds, and then sweep in at harvest time with their sinfulness.\nSurprisingly, the followers of the Hanbit Palace were lucky. Unlike the other malignancies, it wasn’t a direct contract, but rather the soul itself.\nThe body attached to Park Yong-shin didn’t even have time to be consumed by Leon’s swift star summoning and divine punishment.\n“Hic…!”\nThe only thing he could do was to force himself to appear and make a vicious threat.\n“I am the first knight chosen by Arianna, goddess of light and justice, master of the Lionheart!”\nThe sticky air around Leon’s thundercloud cleared and as the air cleared, the attention of the panicked congregation was suddenly focused.\nThere was light, a brilliant radiance like threads of gold glistened.\n“Fear not in this place of burden! Do not flee! Do not falter, for the Guardian of the Grail is before you!”\nThe embodiment of light and justice.\nThe Goddess’ knight on earth.\nSavior and protector of the true faith.\nThey realized and admitted that their faith was misdirected.\nIf that warm-tempered, dazzling luminary was not a spokesperson for the divine…then what the hell could be?\nThat horrible being that terrorizes the faithful?\nA doctrine of salvation that demands unconditional obedience and faith?\nIt isn’t.\nIt never was.\nYou can’t trade with the divine.\nDoctrine is not made up.\nFaith is not something you prove.\nIt simply exists.\nSomething that forms spontaneously.\nSomething that stands on its own.\n“Goddess, Goddess…….”\n“Help me. Help me. Please… please…….”\n“Help me, I don’t want to die, I’ve done wrong!”\nThe members of the false faith now realized who and what they should believe.\nThey had seen the divine in front of them, not an insubstantial salvation.\nThere was only one thing for Leon to do, then, as the Goddess’s knight.\n“It shall be done.”\n“Keeeeeeeeee…!”\nThe Demon of Gluttony screams in rage but Leon knew it was only a rage.\nThe demon’s flesh exploded as it consumed its surroundings. It sought to obscure his vision, to create a gap, a way to escape.\nThe thick haze of blood threatened to extinguish Leon’s radiance, to rust his brilliant gold, but how could malice transgress the divine?\n“Holy sword.”\nLeon summoned the holy sword from thin air.\n“Know that this worm is not worthy to be slayed by you.”\n“Keeeeeeeeee……!”\nThe malevolence tore at Leon’s flesh, cowering in fear but it turned away, unable to reach the demigod guarded by the holy sword.\nThe chunk of meat refused to touch the holy sword and crashed down on itself.\n“Do you believe that such malice as yours can surpass the divinity of this king?”\n“Keye…!”\nIt was a warm tone to a human, but to a demon, it was an unleashed violence.\nThe pain of the voice alone seemed to tear at his flesh.\nEven with all the malice, all the false faith, all the amplified power… the prey is no match for the predator.\nIt is the wrong kind of being.\n“Rotten strength, filthy filth, you lack the intellect to claim honor, and the speculation to be a vicious beast.”\nDespite this unprecedented insult, the demon could not face Leon.\nHe couldn’t even glare in anger as the divinity in front of him burned away his viciousness just by looking at him.\n“All you can do is wriggle, and your cunning mouth cannot save yourself.”\nThe voice, a mixture of scorn and anger, gradually approached.\nThe living demigod tore and burned the demon at its mere approach.\nSly tongues melted away and decaying skin burned before it could even fester.\nThe thick haze of blood that filled the room had long since washed away like a lie.\n“Divinity of Light and Justice. In the name of Arianna.”\nAll evil, you are doomed.\nThe holy sword sliced through the air, its amplified holy power burning away the evil.\nThe moment was fleeting but the divinity wielded in the form of the holy sword extinguished the evil that had gathered the faith of 1.8 million people.",

      "content": "Chapter 106: Merger\n“Ugh…….”\nPark Yong-shin opened his eyes.\nHis eyelids, heavy as a thousand muscles, opened, and his body, which had moved as if it were not his own, stirred and moved.\nWhen he opened his eyes, what he saw was a brilliant light.\n“Aaah…….”\nA warm glow enveloped him and an energy permeated him. There was nothing to ask. The one in front of him was God.\n“Great One…….”\nPark Yong-shin prostrated himself with tears in his eyes. He was ashamed of his past of creating doctrines, preaching the Word, and expanding the church for the Voice.\n“You are…God.”\n“A demigod.”\nLeon replied blandly, pointing his gleaming golden holy sword at him.\n“You lowly heretic, you have spoken of salvation through the power of an evil species.”\n“Sin, I apologize…….”\n“You tried to hold the world in your pugnacious eyes. Your arrogance insulted the gods and enraged the Lionhearted King, so how can you repay me?”\n“What… what can I do?”\nLeon pondered.\nNormally, a sociopath would be reduced to serfdom, used as a meat shield on the battlefield, or forced to farm for the rest of his life.\nBut there were exceptions to the rule.\nDemon worshippers, blinded by their unruly quest for knowledge through sacrifice, or barbarians, blinded by power and imprinted with the slavery of beast gods.\nThe Hanbit Palace is somewhat different from both of these examples.\nThe devouring demons of gluttony do not identify themselves as demons, but rather trick gullible commoners into their evil ways.\nThere is no arbitrariness here, so the punishment is quite light unless you have germinated a demonic seed.\n“Ten years. Ten years to serve and worship the Great Shrine! Build up your faith until you are a free man, and only then will you be able to ask the gods for forgiveness as a free man!”\nHe was addressing all of the members of the Hanbit Palace who had miraculously survived the comet’s aftermath, not just Park Yong-shin.\nAs their stunned gazes focused, Leon spoke.\n“In the name of all the gods, bow down for forgiveness. If you refuse, there will be no more mercy.”\nNo one left the room; they all fell down and worshiped him.\n* * * * *\nThe Hanbit Palace, a mega-cult that had gathered 1.6 million adherents over two decades and spanned political, business, and hunting circles collapsed.\nA symbol of salvation, with numerous related industries and over four hundred elite Hunters. The collapse of the Hanbit Palace and the comet impact caused a great deal of controversy.\n-Comet Bom crashed into the Hanbit Palace?\n-What, that comet from the old, failed cartoon?\n-A 6-kilometer comet stuck in the ground. Crazy.\nThe comet that hit the Hanbit Palace was an extraordinary event that turned all common sense on its head.\nHundreds of meteorites enter the Earth’s atmosphere every day, but they don’t make much news because they are all incinerated upon entry.\nHowever, the comet that hit the Hanbit Palace was not even slightly reduced in size.\n-Why are we still alive?\n-If it’s that big, shouldn’t it at least wipe out Asia?\n-Yes.\nEven stranger is the aftermath of the comet’s impact.\nA 6-kilometer comet collided with Earth with no loss of atmosphere, no craters, and no aftermath for thousands of kilometers.\nConsidering that it was a comet impact that ended the age of the Cretaceous dinosaurs, and that the mega basins we’ve found around the planet since then are evidence of a tens to hundreds of meters of impact, a 6-kilometer comet could easily end the human race.\nBut even the Hanbit Palace, which was directly hit, didn’t have a single death, let alone the end of humanity.\n-Hey, isn’t this the miracle Hanbit Palace talked about?\n-They’re going to get their asses kicked.\nSome said that this was a favor from the heavenly gods.\nIt’s widely believed that the system crashes when Hanbit Palace devotees enter the gate.\nIf this is true, then the Hanbit Palace’s expansion will be even greater than the Hanbit Palace being blown away.\n-Hanbit Palace Park Yong-shin is holding a press conference.\n-Tat\n-If it’s true that all the members of Hanbit Palace are alive, isn’t it no longer a cult?\nPark Yong-shin of Hanbit Palace held a public press conference eight hours after the epic celestial collision.\nWhile everyone was looking forward to his announcement, he opened his mouth.\n[As of today, Hanbit Palace will be merging with TTG Guild. All assets will be transferred to His Majesty Leon Dragonia Lionheart, Guild Leader of the TTG Guild and a living demigod, and our raids will be organized as the TTG Guild Man-At-Arms──]\n-???\n-???\n-What? What just happened?\n-The Hanbit Palace is being merged into the TTG Guild?\n-?????\nSince the Cataclysm, there have been numerous examples of Hunter guilds merging with other guilds. Corporations merge, so why shouldn’t half-corporate guilds merge?\nRight now, all of the top 10 guilds in Korea are conglomerates that have been created by merging small and large guilds.\nBut the problem is that Hanbit is not just a guild.\nIt’s more like a chaebol with related businesses such as hunter armor production workshops, item factories, and processing industries for materials obtained from the Gate, as well as alcohol, beverages, construction, media, publishing, and sports teams.\nAnd the centerpiece of it all is the Hanbit Palace. They were both a religious organization and a chaebol group with many businesses, and the head of the group was Park Yong-shin, a Korean S-class hunter.\nAnd now he’s not only handing over all those businesses to TTG Guild, he’s declaring himself a subcontractor?\nIt was impossible no matter how fast TTG Guild has been growing lately, it’s still just a small religious group with an army to match.\nIt was a case of a small business eating a big business.\n-Is that true?\n-Hunter Park Yong-shin, what is your relationship with the TTG Guild?\nThe reporters’ questions kept coming. But Park Yong-shin answered calmly, as if he was above it all.\n[He is the true savior, an agent of God. You must find true faith, everyone. He is the savior of this world].\nWhat kind of nonsense is this?\nIt’s like a Protestant minister announcing that the Buddha is the real God.\n-Was last night’s comet impact related to the TTG Guild?\n-Please tell me more!\n[That’s it]\nHanbit Palace’s announcement of its own annexation to TTG Guild became a hot topic in Korea and around the world because it was linked to the comet impact.\n* * * * *\nAside from the Hanbit Palace merger, Leon looked at the comet that had crashed into the Hanbit Palace.\n“Lord Spinner, when can we begin work?”\n-Needed to build a facility. Major Facility Located in the TTG Guild.\nThe comet was full of iron oxide. It was also exposed to the three forces of nature, which greatly altered its properties.\nThis is the metal the God of Blacksmiths speaks of. It’s called star iron, and the Lionheart Kingdom has periodically summoned it to be forged.\n“What we need right now is 50 suits of armor and swords. Spears and halberds are secondary.”\n-Your Majesty’s armor?\n“Of course, this king’s armor and Sir Spinner’s come first.”\nAll Leon needs is a suit of armor.\nDuring the war with demons Leon’s armor was destroyed.\nUnlike the Immortal Holy Sword, armor is consumable, and no new Stardust Armor was being forged in the annihilated world.\n“Half-assed armor is only as good as the wearer but yours must be of the finest quality, and the gods will bless it in the final stages of production.”\n-Check.\nLeon’s armor and Yappy fuselage were the first priorities. The problem is, they’re for knight cadets, but──\n-Facilities need to be expanded, and legislation needs to be passed.\n“I see.”\nIf it were Lionheart, they would just build the facility since Leon was the king, but this was Korea.\nAs long as Leon respected the laws here, he would need the support of government officials to build and expand the facility.\nAnd the government official was already on his way.\n“Your Majesty, the president of the Association and the Ministry of Science and ICT are here.”\nPark Yong-shin bowed low and reported.\nIn the case of a meteorite from uninhabited space, its ownership belongs to the landowner. But of course he’d handed it over to Leon.\nThat’s why Oh Kang-hyuk, the head of the Korean Hunter Association, and Kim Shin-chul, the Minister of Science and Technology, came to see him.\n“Your Majesty, how have you been?”\n“Yes.”\nOh Kang-hyuk, the president of the association, bowed as if to say hello. Minister Kim Shin- chul, on the other hand, was mesmerized by the 6-kilometer comet in front of him.\n“Minister Kim. Minister Kim!”\n“Ah…ah! Excuse me, my name is Kim Shin-chul, Minister of Science and ICT. It is an honor to meet you, Your Majesty.”\nLeon guessed the purpose of their visit.\n“The star belongs to this king. I summoned it.”\n“And……as well.”\n“So, it was really the TTG Guild who summoned the comet…Your Majesty?”\nOh Kang-hyuk seemed to have guessed, and the Minister of Science and Technology’s face contorted in horror.\nA human being who could summon a giant comet that could wipe out the human race, how could that be possible with human power?\n“Your Majesty, how do you intend to use it?”\n“Forge it. Sir Spinner, the Holy Knight of Iron and Blacksmithing, will use it to forge swords and armor for our knights.”\nAt that, Minister Kim burst out laughing.\nWhat a waste of resources to use such a precious comet for weapons!\n“Your Majesty, please hand over that comet to my government! If it’s such a valuable star with an unspoiled original, we can make great advances in space science…”\n“If His Majesty has his way, that’s enough.”\n“Oh, Association President Oh Kang-hyuk, what kind of nonsense is that──!”\nMinister Kim was overwhelmed by the loose gaze Oh Kang-hyuk was sending him. One of the three initial S-class Hunters who once led the Korean Gate front.\nHe was one of the few people in Korea who could endure if he was truly pressured.\n“I’ve heard of a star iron forge from Ms. Ha-ri. That’s the material you used, right?”\n“That’s right.”\n“Hehe, I’m looking forward to it. To process a star of that size to make armaments, it’s unheard of in history.”\nThe elderly head of the Association was purely in awe of the miracle before him, but he was able to find a point of agreement between the government and the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods.\n“Your Majesty, is that something you’d like to do here? I’m sure it would be very laborious to move something of that size.”\n“Lord Spinner will take care of it. Mr. Oh, what is it that you wish to say?”\n“Your Majesty, I’m afraid that casting and smelting something of that size would require a facility worthy of the name. I’ll take care of that at the government level, and you can take care of the complicated tax and legal issues, even if it means passing special legislation.”\nLeon listened to President Oh’s proposal with interest.\n“What do you want?”\n“To put it bluntly, we’d like to use the armor made by the Divine Blacksmith as a reference.”\nAt President Oh’s frank suggestion, Leon replied with an unbridled smile.\n“Giving a part of the comet as a gift is not a difficult task. I was going to give it to President Oh anyway.”\nIt’s an answer that would make President Ahn ask, “Why am I in the middle of this?” but it can’t be helped. The only person who could be construed as a king was the president.\n“However, the products of the Star Iron Forge cannot be taken out of the country.”\n“… Do you mind if I ask the reason?”\n“Because the products of the Iron Forge are gifts from the gods. They may not be holy, but they are worth their weight in gold.”\n“Is it a matter of justification?”\n“It is also a matter of tradition.”\n“Hmm…….”\nPresident Oh thought for a moment since Leon had clearly given him leeway.\nIf it was something he could never give away otherwise Leon wouldn’t be talking about tradition.\n“Your Majesty, I’m referring to Miss Han Ha-ri, who was sent to your guild.”\n“Go on.”\n“Will she also be given a piece of the Stardust Forge’s workmanship?”\n“Of course.”\n“Then… when Miss Ha-ri goes to work for the Association, would it be okay for us to ‘watch’ it, or for an appraiser to ‘analyze’ it, since she is technically our employee?”\nNow Leon smiled.\n“If that’s the case, I can’t help it.”\nLeon’s pact with the government was a success.\n“Your Majesty, there is another matter apart from this merger and the comet.”\n“Speak.”\nOh Kang-hyuk manipulated the pad his secretary pulled out and offered it to Leon.\n“Hmm?”\nLeon’s eyes narrowed as he looked at it.\n“Is this a video from inside the gate?”\n“No, it’s a video of a battle in Vietnam, and it’s strictly from within the Earth.”\nIt was something modern people couldn’t possibly know.\nThe London Affair: an Epic-level item emerged from the Black Gate, which had been cleared by the European Union’s Hunters.\nIt took 32 guilds and an astronomical auction to determine its owner, but it was another scourge on humanity.\n“The Wandering Blade, the sixth-generation demon who wielded it, Chen Jihao, is currently headed for the Japanese archipelago.”",

      "content": "Chapter 107: The Wandering Sword\n“Thirteen years ago, a black gate appeared in London.”\nOh Kang-hyuk, the president of the association, began his story calmly.\nThe Black Gate is a disaster that no raid has ever been able to capture due to its unreasonable difficulty.\nRecalling the Shanghai disaster that tore a huge country into dozens of pieces, the European Union dispatched its own S-class raiders to take on the London Gate.\n“There were only twenty-four S-class Hunters at the time, and that’s not all. Thirty-two guilds from thirteen European countries sent an unprecedented combined raid force of 1,834, composed entirely of A- and B-class Hunters.”\nIn effect, half of Europe’s entire military might was assembled to attack London Gate.\nThis unprecedented raid was led by Cornwall Ong, Archmage of Clockwork Tower and founder of the Magic Tower.\n“Did they fail?”\nAt that, President Oh shook his head.\n“No, they succeeded. It was a two-month-long battle, but Cornwall Ong and the Mage Division of the Magic Tower alone were extremely skilled.”\nEquipped with twelve epic-level items, the Mages of Cornwall Ong and Magic Tower attacked London Gate with overwhelming firepower and closed it.\n[EU raiders take London Gate!]\n[Queen Elizabeth awards Cornwall Ong with a dukedom]\n[Black Gate captured for the first time, proving the power of humanity!]\nThe great storming of the Black Gate was an event so epic that it became a myth, a story that was told throughout Europe.\nAt the time, there was no equipment available to capture footage of the gate’s defenses, but the stories that were passed down through oral tradition were staggering in scale.\nThe problem came after the capture of London Gate.\n[Overkill]\nRank: Epic\nAmong the many loots obtained at London Gate, it was one of the most powerful items in the 30-year history since the Cataclysm.\nWhat happened next was easy for Leon to guess.\n“It must have been a toss-up who would get it.”\n“Yes, because then, and now… there are less than a dozen Epic Items in the world.”\nThis first-of-its-kind Epic Item was proven by Cornwall Ong’s performance at London Gate.\nAn Epic item can single-handedly change the course of a battle, it was a transcendent item worth its weight in gold. Every one of the 13 participating nations could only want it.\n-London Gate is a gate that emerged in our country, England. We have a right to it.\n-Don’t be ridiculous. We who risked our own security to help Britain have a right to it.\n-You already have twelve, don’t you? We, France, sent the most Hunters.\n-No one should be excluded from distribution just because they have an Epic item.\nThirty-two guilds, as well as presidents of governments, tried to secure this item.\nEventually, the item was put up for auction, with national budgets attached, and the winning bidder was the British government.\nThe winning bid was 1.4 trillion won.\nIt was an unprecedented price for an item and more than the price of an Aegis cruiser.\nThe Epic-level item Overkill was loaned to James Spencer, Guildmaster of the Gentlemen’s League, one of the most powerful swordsmen of his time.\nAnd the moment he picked it up──\n“It was the beginning of a cataclysm. Little did he know that it was a demonic sword that would corrupt its wielder…….”\nJames Spencer was transformed into a demon, a demon with an insatiable appetite for bloodshed.\n“Eight hundred thousand citizens dead, London blown to smithereens and over six hundred Hunters dead.”\n“You said it was a sixth-generation demon. Did they finally succeed in destroying it?”\n“Yes, they succeeded in defeating its host, Sir James, but…the demon escaped.”\n“Escaped?”\nOverkill faded into the sky as James died.\n“And two years later, it was found in Australia.”\nSince then, the Wandering Sword had repeated the process of slaughter and finding new hosts.\nAustralia.\nMexico.\nCambodia.\nSpain.\n“Finally, four years ago, in Korea a genius swordsman, Chun Ji-ho, who was supposed to be the next leader of the Divine Sword Guild.”\n“The Divine Sword Guild?”\n“Yes. He is the son of Chun Jin-soo, the strongest hunter in Korea, and the father of Miss Chun So-yeon, whom Your Majesty knows.”\nJust like that, four years ago, the sixth generation of Demon Swordsmen appeared, and the Wandering Demon Sword has yet to be vanquished.\n* * * *\n“Hu….”\nYong-wan stopped at the door and tried to relax, but Ha Yuri looked at him with a slightly worried look.\n“Are you okay?”\n“No, I’m not okay.”\n“I know. That matter…”\n“That and…….”\n“What’s with all the crap at the Alliance meeting?”\n“It’s not like it’s a big deal… I’ve just been sick.”\nA silent stare, as if he really thought that lame excuse would work. Yong-wan sighed heavily in exasperation.\n“It’s all because of that Lionheart King or Lion King or something.”\nThe sacrifice of Georgic and his great soldiers… following the advice of the Lionheart King when they attacked the Dragon Palace Gate together… from that day forward, Yong-wan had gradually changed.\nSix of the ten guilds, led by the Blue Star Guild, had joined the tax reform plan but time and time again, he had failed to attend the meetings of this huge coalition.\n“It’s a bit tricky to get out of it, but why don’t we just merge into the TTG Guild?”\n“Are you crazy? How much does this all cost…….?”\n“Well, you’ll have to pay 90% if you go in there.”\n“What the hell are you guys thinking, paying 90%…….”\nAnyway, Leon’s appearance shook the country in many ways. Above all, this faucet man has become a little more human.\n“Well, I’ll follow you. It’s your decision.”\n“Of course.”\nWith those words, Yong-wan took a deep breath and opened the door to find the patrons already seated around a round table.\n“Hello, Mr. Yong-wan, long time no see, Ms. Yuri.”\nThe first to greet them was a beautiful woman with long hair pinned up and dressed in pure white.\n“Dr. Yoon, you look the same.”\nYoon Soo-ah, the guild leader of Juwon Medical, a division of Juwon Hospital, one of Korea’s leading general hospitals. She’s an S-class healer, known for bringing people back from the dead.\n“I’ve been trying to get Firebird to advertise our nutritional products, but you haven’t accepted yet, have you?”\n“Was there such a thing?”\nYong-wan glanced at Ha Yuri, and she shrugged.\n“I rejected it because it didn’t fit our guild’s image.”\n“What was it?”\n“An erectile dysfunction drug.”\n“…….”\nYong-wan’s sheepish gaze turned to Yoon Soo-ah but she smiled and made a flirtatious gesture with her hand.\n“Dr. Yoon, aren’t you a Chinese medicine doctor? Why do you keep practicing Western medicine?”\n“That’s for healing and this is for selling medicine. I’m licensed in both, and I have all the business licenses.”\n“You use acupuncture to heal people right? You also treat hair loss with acupuncture.”\nYoon Soo-ah giggled at that.\n“I can’t sell acupuncture because I don’t have enough customers.”\n“That’s because you charge 100 million won for hair loss acupuncture.”\n“If it’s not that much, my time is more valuable.”\nHe’s a well-heeled bastard himself, but this woman is even worse.\nYong-wan’s gaze turns to the others at the table.\n“Take a seat, Mr. Yong-wan. Miss Yuri.”\nIt was a balding, squinty-eyed old man who invited them to sit down.\nHe was the Guild Leader of the Blue Star Guild and S-class Hunter Kang Jin-sung and aside from the off-standard Chun Jin-soo, he was the best swordsman in Korea.\n“Long time no see, old man.”\nLee Yong-wan greeted with a rare display of extreme decorum.\nChun Jin-soo, the light swordsman, Oh Kang-hyuk, the iron swordsman and Kang Jin-sung, the infinite swordsman.\nThese three are the first generation members of what is known in Korea as the Fundamental of Fundamentals and the first Hunters to awaken from the cataclysmic events 30 years ago.\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say that they were the legendary Hunters who protected the foundation of the country.\n“You didn’t show up for the last meeting. Why?”\nKang Jin-sung was referring to the alliance that most of the top ten guilds participated in.\nThey were supposed to discuss the ‘tax exemption bill’ for large guilds, but Lee Yong-wan, who came from Jeju Island Gate, had a change of heart and didn’t attend.\n“Haha…I’m a little unwell, so I can’t help it.”\n“You?”\nKang Jin-sung’s gaze sharpened. Damn, you old fool… You have magic in your gaze.\nYong-wan may have missed the meeting, but he has no intention of going against Kang Jin-sung. There are only two people in the country who can stand up to him.\n“After clearing the Red Gate of Jeju Island and the Dragon Palace Gate, where the Demon Archduke appeared, he must be feeling the strain, senior.”\nLightening the heavy mood was a huge man twice the size of Yong-wan and Kang Jin-sung.\n“Thank you, senior Jong-soo, for your consideration.”\nPark Jong-soo of Mujin Guild was the best S-class tank in Korea. Unlike Golden Lion’s Golden Chul, which is classified as a dps tank, he is a hunter who only specializes in defense.\n‘If it’s just defense, he’ll be comparable to Lord Georgic.’\nYong-wan sits down with Ha Yuri, who remains silent behind him and the hip, golden-haired young man across from him waves.\n“Hello.”\n“Nice to see you.”\nHe meant it.\nIn a place full of senior members, Yong-wan was the one person Golden Chul could feel comfortable with.\n“Is everyone else here yet?”\nYong Wan and Ha Yuri’s from Firebird,\nKang Jin-sung from Blue Star\nPark Jong-soo from Mujin Guild.\nYoon Soo-ah from Juwon Medical.\nGolden Chul from Golden Lion.\nHalf of the ten guilds had gathered, or to put it another way, only half had arrived.\nYoon Soo-ah answered the question.\n“Kim Jin-chul, that drug-addled bastard, is probably sleeping somewhere. Is Hanbit Palace owner Park Yong-shin busy with the merger?”\n“…….”\nYong-wan was also shaken by the news of a six-kilometer comet. Of course, he immediately suspected Leon.\n‘He’s the one who can do anything.’\nHe’s an agent of the gods, after all.\n“The head of the Divine Sword Guild please enter.”\nIt was then that the tumultuous atmosphere of the round table changed.\nAn anachronistic old man with a white beard and long gray hair appeared, escorted by a staff member.\nHowever, the old gray-haired man’s fierce aura and intense gaze overwhelmed everyone in the room.\nHe is the Leader of the Divine Sword Guild and a first generation hunter representing Korea alongside Infinite Sword Kang Jin-sung.\nChun Jin-soo is the strongest S-class Hunter in Korea.\nHaving turned seventy this year, his appearance silenced the once tumultuous roundtable.\nChun Jin-soo casually took a seat at the head of the table, his fierce gaze fixed on the S-class Hunters at the table.\n“Kang Hyuk-yi.”\n“…….”\n“…….”\nIn the silence, Park Jong-soo, who had been watching, hurriedly replied.\n“He’ll be here soon, old man.”\n“You didn’t even bother to give me a welcome feast, you just put a chain on my leg.”\nOh Kang-hyuk and Chun Jin-soo are known to be old friends. As he lightly addressed the head of the Hunter Association, he glanced at Ha Yuri and clicked his tongue.\n“Tsk tsk. What’s with your clothes?”\nAlthough Ha Yuri didn’t reveal much, the bodysuit that clung to her body and revealed her figure was extremely uncomfortable.\n“Shi, I’ll fix it.”\n“Ms. Yuri, cover mine first.”\nYong-wan quickly draped his coat over Ha Yuri’s shoulders. Seeing that, Chen Jin-soo stroked his long beard like a monk.\n“So, when are you two going to have a baby?”\n“Phew…!”\n“Ah, no, old man… we’re not like that.”\nYong-wan waves his hands in panic while Yuri glared at Yong-wan with an unpleasant gaze, but only for a moment.\n“Hehe, whenever good men and good women get together, they should enjoy the male-female relationship. As for me. I had six children at that age!”\nLight Swordsman Chun Jin-soo is one of the strongest Hunters in Korea, and one of the best in the World Hunter Rankings.\nBut even Hunters who admire him can’t feel comfortable in his presence…….\n‘He’s an asshole.’\n‘Uncomfortable…….’\nPatriarch of one of Korea’s most prestigious families, the Chun clan. In other words──Korea’s representative asshole.\nA living fossil but the strongest in Korea.\n“So, the lame ducks have called for help. Which cities have been blown up?”\n“Not yet, sir. I’m guessing it’s going to pass over Osaka.”\n“He’s my bastard, but at least he’s acting like a patriot before he’s going to get f*cked by me.”\nThe Hunters were dumbfounded by Chen Jin-soo unrelenting words. In fact, it was common for neighboring countries to unite in such an international tribulation. If there was a problem-─\n“But don’t those bastards have a conscience? They said they didn’t know me when Ulsan was in ruins.”\nWhen the sixth Demon Swordsman was born in Ulsan, South Korea, Japan refused to support it, using all sorts of excuses, and Ulsan was eventually destroyed.\n“The…Japanese government said that since the demon of the time was… Mr. Chun Ji-ho, Korea was also responsible…….”\n“Fucking shit.”\nIt was a colorful insult, but everyone agreed. Even when four S-class Hunters were killed in Ulsan by Demon Swordsman Chun Ji-ho, Japan didn’t even bother to help them.\n“Forget it. I’m going to kill him anyway, so you guys can deal with it.”\n“Don’t jump to conclusions.”\nThe door opened and three people appeared.\nOh Kang-hyuk, the president of the Association, Leon, the guild leader of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild, and Park Yong-shin, the owner of the Hanbit Palace.\n“Huh?”\nLee Yong-wan suddenly realized something when Leon appeared.\n‘Isn’t he also a jerk?’\nMr. Jerk and King Jerk were in the same room. The two of them, who had an absolute presence in this place, naturally exchanged glances and──\n“Make way.”\nIt started with Leon demanding to be seated.",

      "content": "Chapter 108: The Unacceptable\nChun Jin-soo is an S-class hunter representing Korea.\nThe forty years old scion of a great family, takes up his sword against monsters during the Cataclysm.\nHe was the best sword in Korea, a living legend and Guildmaster of the number one [Divine Sword] guild in Korea.\nHis many legends, tinnitus, and contributions to the nation make him an untouchable “old man” in this country.\nHe’s so untouchable that if they see him on the side of the road, the citizens will greet him with a bow, and it won’t even make the news if he beats up a few unruly boys and girls.\nIn other words, it’s an environment that makes Chun Jin-soo, who already has a bratty temperament, even more bratty.\nNaturally, wherever he went, the main seat was his, and it had become common knowledge that no one could dispute that, but──\n“Get out of the way.”\nChun Jin-soo didn’t understand for a moment what the blonde young man said as he looked down at him.\nHis eyes narrowed and he was speechless, causing everyone watChung to stare in horror.\nThere was someone who could bark orders at Chun Jin-soo of the Korean First Sword!\n“You’re still in the prime of life, and you’re already deaf.”\nThe verbal assault was a rare occurrence in the life of the seventy-year-old Chun Jin-soo.\n“No, you young bastard──”\n“This king is three hundred years old this year.”\n“What?”\nOh Kang-hyuk came out from behind like a servant. Although he was an old friend of Chun Jin-soo, he was only sixty-seven years old this year, just short of Chun Jin-soo’s age.\n“What nonsense, how can a person be 300 years old!”\n“I’ve heard that Holy Knights don’t age and their bodies are fixed to their prime.”\n“Uh…Hmm.”\nChun Jin-soo couldn’t figure out what his close brother in front of him was talking about. He had heard that there was a survivor in the world these days called the Lionheart King.\nBut he was of the Vietnam War generation. A celestial martial artist who didn’t pay attention to stories that didn’t interest him and might not know about Leon.\nAfter all, most of the information about the Ten Thousand Gods Guild was being passed on via the internet and television.\n“Is it true…?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Are you…….?”\nChun Jin-soo is a brat.\nHe’s the kind of guy who, whenever there’s an argument, the first thing he’ll say is, “How old are you!” and then he’ll start arguing.\nHis most powerful weapon is his age. But when confronted by someone who has lived more than four times as long as he has, he’s at a loss for words.\n“I, um… I’m the head of the Divine Sword Guild──”\n“He is the Lionheart Kingdom’s Lionheart King, and he currently runs the largest guild in Korea. He is truly the pinnacle of the Class Era.”\n“You…weren’t you my friend?”\nChun Jin-soo looked at Oh Kang-hyuk with a narrowed gaze, but he laughed lightly.\n“Of course, Mr. Hunter. But I’m here as the president of the Korean Hunter Association.”\nHe was trying to separate fact from fiction, though he was clearly siding with Leon.\n“Look, young…no, I mean, he…….”\nEven as he was about to say something, he felt out of place with Leon’s youthful appearance, so he stood up then moved to sit down next to Mujin Guild Leader.\n“…….”\n“…….”\n‘The cranky old man has sunk.’\n‘What is this situation?’\nIt was so disconcerting to see Chun Jin-soo, who always sat at the head of the table whenever a Ten Guild meeting was called, sulking like a child whose toy had been taken away.\nLeon naturally took his seat at the head of the table, and Yoon Soo-ah greeted him with a smile.\n“Your Majesty, you’re as handsome as the rumors say, how do you do? I’m Yoon Soo-ah.”\nYoon Soo-ah is always kind to handsome men and Park Yong-shin scolds her with narrowed eyes.\n“How rude of you, Miss Yoon! You have the audacity to say that!”\n“Why are you……suddenly having a seizure?”\nYoon Soo-ah stares at Park Yong-shin’s out-of-the-blue remark and sees the chilling fanaticism in his eyes.\n“His Majesty is a savior. He is the gospel sent down to earth by the gods of the universe, the shepherd, the treasure of the human world.”\n“…….”\n-What’s wrong with him?\n-Isn’t he a cult leader?\n-I heard they merged…….\nThe Hanbit Palace announced its merger with TTG Guild last night, the day after the meteorite fell. There were still many people who didn’t understand why Hanbit was merging with the TTG Guild, or how a cult leader became Leon’s foot polisher.\n‘I think I have a pretty good idea…….’\n‘Me too…….’\nHowever, Yong-wan and Ha Yuri of the Firebird Guild, and Golden Chul of the Golden Lion Guild, who were present, had a rough idea of what was going on.\nIf you have any problems…….\n“Mr. Park Yong-shin, I heard that you merged with the TTG Guild.”\nKang Jin-sung of the Blue Star Guild had been extremely annoyed by Park Yong-shin behavior earlier, and for good reason.\n“The Hanbit Palace was supposed to be in a cooperative relationship for immediate purposes, but you sold it off without consulting us.”\nHanbit Palace was part of the tax reform bill coalition centered on the Blue Star Guild. No, it was a key player, as it ran a multinational business.\n“You mean that?”\nPark Yong-shin gave him a rotten stare.\n“I’ll leave Hanbit out of it, and I don’t have the authority to do so anymore.”\n“Hey, Palace Lord Park!”\nGuild Leader Park Jong-soo shouted, as this was tantamount to treachery.\nAnd it was a similar reaction from the other guild leaders, but Park Yong-shin snorted and laughed at their foolishness.\nWhat a bunch of foolish, deluded people.\nThere’s a living demigod right in front of them, and they can’t even see it.\nOf course, Park Yong-shin himself had a shameful past, having initially tried to persecute Leon as a heretic.\nFor that crime, he was punished to be a slave in the Ten Thousand Gods Guild, but now he realizes that there is a true savior in this world, the Lionheart King who will drive out the false gods and bring in the true faith.\n“Enough.”\nThat was it. At a single wave of Leon’s hand, Park Yong-shin’s expression quickly changed and he bowed his head.\n“Yes, Your Majesty!”\n“”………….””\nWhat could possibly happen for a cult leader to convert overnight?\n“President Oh Kang-hyuk, this king’s time is more valuable than gold.”\n“Yes…! Let’s get straight to the point!”\nThey suddenly realize the difference between how the Association treats the Ten Guilds and how they treat Leon.\nOf course, even the Divine Sword Guild tends to use economic logic to bully the Association, so how sweet it would be to have a superhuman who could easily clear a red gate or two as long as they were polite.\n“Last month In Da Nang, Vietnam, the magical demon, Chun…….”\nOh Kang-hyuk glanced at Chun Jin-soo since it was his eldest son who was the demon swordsman.\n“I don’t care, he’s no match for me.”\n“It’s early, young man. Maintain your dignity.”\n“…….”\nChun Jin-soo looks at Leon as if he’s dumbfounded by his point.\n“I’m… seventy-five this year.”\n“You’re still in your prime, but you’re a bit haggard at face value.”\n“Phew…!”\nHa Yuri burst out in laughter but when Chun Jin-soo gave her a disapproving glance, she looked away.\n“Okay…….”\nChun Jin-soo was silent with his lips pursed and Oh Kang-hyuk struggled to hold back his laughter as he watched his troublesome friend fumble.\n“The demon swordsman from Da Nang, Chun Ji-ho, has been hovering around for a while now, but this one’s a bit more subdued, so he’s just been wandering around in the evacuated city.”\nThe problem came next.\nEvacuating the city was a good idea, but then Nguyen, a Vietnamese S-class hunter, went after the Demon Swordsman.\nNguyen, an all-powerful S-class hunter in Vietnam who had hired many Filipino mercenaries, wanted to use this opportunity to make a name for himself around the world──\n“Was the testimony of a survivor.”\n“What a bunch of commie birds.”\nIn any case, the campaign against the Demon Swordsman in Da Nang was a disaster. Drunk on blood, the Demon Swordsman laid waste to the entire city and began traveling again in search of his next target across the ocean, to the American continent.\nGiven the speed with which it travels on its sword, the U.S. government has even declared martial law to prepare for its arrival in less than two weeks.\n“It was two weeks ago that the Demon Swordsman made his strange move.”\nTwo weeks ago. Leon was in the middle of clearing the Relic Convoy quest after opening an artificial gate.\n“The Demon Swordsman suddenly changed course and started flying toward Japan, traveling faster than expected.”\nThe Japanese government was so alarmed that it ordered the Hunters to be called out, and asked for help from South Korea and the United States.\n“By the way.”\nJust then, a hip young man raises his hand. Hwang Jin-chul, a young man with a gold necklace who also works as a professional rapper, asked the question.\n“Why should we help then?”\n“Hunter Golden Chul…….”\n“No, no, that’s the thing. We talked about it when you weren’t around, but they were a bunch of bastards during the Ulsan case, and we’re not going to let them get away with it. The Yankees are going to make a lot of noise about Korea-U.S.-Japan cooperation, but that’s something to think about when there’s no reason.”\nThe sixth generation demon swordsman awakened in an event known as the Ulsan Massacre, where South Korea lost four S-class Hunters, including Chun Ji-ho, the host of the Demon Sword.\nWith Chun Ji-ho, the strongest Demon Swordsman ever, the Japanese government prevented their own S-class Hunters from leaving, and it took eight more Korean S-class Hunters to finally defeat him.\nThe Wandering Demon Swordsman was a formidable force, and it was understandable that the Japanese were scared off but the reverse was equally applicable.\n“If the Wandering Demon Swordsman appears, then…even if we want to deal with its basic abilities, we’ll have to mobilize a hundred elite troops, and who will deal with the Demon Sword itself? I wasn’t able to deal with it because I was a rookie at the time, but you said it’s very powerful, wasn’t it, Yong-wan?”\n“Why are you dragging me…?.”\nLee Yong-wan was one of the S-class Hunters in Korea who had fought the Wandering Demon Swordsman…the current Demon Sword, Chun Ji-ho.\nFive S-class hunters, including Infinite Sword Kang Jin-sung of Blue Star, had faced it, and he felt it more than anyone else.\n“It’s strong. Not even five S-Class hunters barely have a chance against him. One-on-one, I don’t think anyone would be able to…… No, I see.”\n“????”\nAt that moment, everyone’s gaze turned to Yong-wan, and Yong-wan’s gaze turned to Leon.\nLeon fought against Majestic Georgic, so he knew that a superhuman comparable to the demon swordsman existed.\n“Your Majesty, the Lionhearted King, are you…stronger than Lord Georgic?”\nUnder Yong-wan’s gaze, Leon answered as if it were a given.\n“This king is an agent of the gods, the guardian of the Holy Grail, a living demigod.”\nThat was enough of an answer.\nWith Leon on board, any difficulty level would be doable so Golden Chul agreed.\nHe had witnessed Leon’s transcendent martial prowess in Cheongju, and Yong-wan had seen it at Jeju Island and Dragon Palace Gate.\nIf there was a human being beyond the standards of an S-class Hunter, it would definitely be Leon.\n“Well, regardless, I’m still against it. There is nothing left.”\n“Why is there nothing left?”\nLeon opened his mouth, his gaze scanning to his left.\n“Honor remains. Honor can be earned. And then there is the life of the commoner, who can only lean within the confines of knighthood and noble duty.”\nEveryone here would have laughed at the fatuousness of it all but those who have experienced Leon know that his justice is not empty, and his honor and glory are not unworthy.\nThat everything the knight named Leon does is for something beyond profit.\n“Oh, so it is…so it is the Savior. This lowly body can’t help but be moved.”\nPark Yong-shin, who has been very emotional lately, agreed with Leon’s words with tears in his eyes.\n“I don’t want to…….”\nYong-Wan looked bored, but sneakily glanced over to see if Leon was going to call him out, and Ha Yuri only shrugged.\n“Your Majesty…….”\nOh Kang-hyuk could only be impressed. His eyes weren’t wrong after all.\n“Then the distribution of the 10 trillion won in aid prepared by the Japanese government on the condition of this combined attack is──”\n“Of course this king will receive it.”\n“…….”\nOh Kang-hyuk, the head of the Association, glared at Leon with a firm gaze but Leon was confident, as if he was saying something obvious.\n“I’m marching an army to a foreign country. I should be paid for it.”\n“Yes…you should.”\nOh Kang-hyuk, who was about to be moved by Leon’s justice, became cold again. If Leon didn’t take it, the Association would have to take it.\n“By the way, there will be a king there too, so prepare an audience with him. This king should introduce himself.”\n“Yes, well… I’ll make a request to the government.”\nBy this time, Oh Kang-hyuk didn’t pay much attention to Leon’s words. After all, Leon was an Otherworlder who valued formalities.\nHe hadn’t noticed the most important part of the story about the Wandering Demon Swordsman Alliance raiders.\n* * * *\nThe meeting didn’t drag on for long.\nThe Ten Thousand Gods and Divine Sword Guilds had agreed to participate, and in response to the 10 trillion won aid package offered by the Japanese government, Golden Chul and Yong-wan slowly announced their intention to join.\n“I’ll join them.”\n“Even Elder Kang Jin-sung?”\nEven Kang Jin-sung, the guild leader of the Blue Star Guild and the second-ranked Infinite Sword after Chun Jin-soo.\nAdding to that Hanbit Palace’s Park Yong-shin, who had also decided to join the battle alongside the Ten Thousand Gods Guild, meant that six large guilds would be participating.\nEveryone started leaving after the scheduled date of the demonic swordsman movement and a light schedule was adjusted.\nThe leader of the Divine Sword Guild, Chun Jin-soo, spoke to Leon as he left.\n“Look.”\n“Look?”\n“……You Majesty the Lionheart King.”\nChun Jin-soo was trying his best to show respect to the young man, even if it was only at face value but as if he didn’t like it, Leon clicked his tongue.\n“You are dark on the culture and manners of this world. But the manners of the past, regardless of the world, are dignified. Perhaps you should watch your language.”\n“No, I… No….”\n“Tsk tsk. When this king was your age, he would have been beaten day and night for such behavior.”\n“My, my age…….”\n“Ugh…! Just ask for forgiveness, that’s all, but that’s a slap in the face. Doesn’t this world have any manners for laughing matter?”\nChun Jin-soo was on the verge of jumping up and down because he had always been the one who said that others don’t have manners.\n“Anyway…! I have a request for your Majesty.”\n“A request?”\n“Yes, sir. You can’t say I don’t deserve it.”\nChun Jin-soo spoke with a determined gaze, unlike the cautious one he had given Leon throughout the meeting.\n“You know that my granddaughter is in Your Majesty’s Guild, so do me a favor and leave her out of this raid.”\n“…….”\nLeon understood Chun Jin-soo’s concern, and rightly so. He would have thought the same thing himself.\nOfficially, she was on his way to deal with a dangerous enemy, and privately, she was on her way to kill her father.\nIt was a coincidence that could be called a tragedy of fate.\n“Impossible.”\n“Look here…!”\n“This king will cannot intervene in this case, for it is the will of God.”\nThe being whispering to Chun So-yeon was the most dangerous god.\nOnly Chun So-yeon and her divinity have a choice. Leon could only watch from the sidelines.",

      "content": "Chapter 109: Stardust\nChun So-yeon remembers that day fondly.\nHer grandfather was a hero, and her father and mother were proud to follow in his footsteps.\nA simple trip to Ulsan with a plan to attack the gates and enjoy a family vacation left an unforgettable scar on the girl.\n“Daddy, please wake up!”\nShe looked up.\nThe aftermath of the gate, the raiding party, and the sword that fell like a meteor. Her father grabbed the sword like he was possessed… and killed everyone in the raiding party.\nEven her mother, who tried to stop him.\n[Ah…?]\nThat was the last memory she had of her parents.\nThat was the day she swore vengeance on her father.\n* * * *\n“Whoa…….”\nChun So-yeon stood up in a cold sweat.\nHer eyes blinking rapidly and her breathing quick but to hide it, she closed her eyes and steadied her breathing.\n“……It’s starting.”\nTTG Guild entry into Japan has been finalized. In other words, the Wandering Demon Sword campaign, led by Leon Dragonia Lionheart, begins.\n‘This is a chance.’\nA once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Even with her grandfather’s help, the moment she thought would be impossible will be possible with the help of the TTG Guild.\n[You’re a bitch, bitch]\nA breathy, eerie voice whispers in her ear and So-yeon stumbles out of the dormitory, holding onto her shivering body.\nThe lights flickered and the bugs swarmed. She descends the creaky dormitory stairs and walks down the dark sidewalk.\nOnly when she was sure she was completely alone did she speak.\n“That was the deal.”\n[Yes, that was the deal.]\nThe voice affirmed her answer.\n[“My avenger has already taught you: ‘Do not attempt to bargain with the divine.’]\nDo not try to bargain with the divine.\nOnly cultivate piety.\nA simple lesson, but a difficult one to fulfill and she was not yet convinced of the teaching.\nThen there was the god who offered her a deal.\n[I will make you a bargain. Despite your distrust, I give you power. Do not take that good fortune lightly.]\n“Mr. Ventasis.”\nVentasis, god of darkness and vengeance.\nAs Leon connected the cadets to the gods, he whispered to Chun So-Yeon, and she connected to him.\n“If I give you the tribute you want… Can I become a Holy Knight?”\n-Ghhhhhhh…….\nVentasis’ gravelly voice fell heavily. Like a heavy heat sinking into the ground.\n[Make no mistake, you think you can take the place of my Avenger, your paltry karma doesn’t even reach the tip of the Lionheart King’s ankle]\nThe Avenger.\nVentasis was obviously referring to Leon. Does that mean that Leon had also invoked Ventasis’ power?\n[I will aid you in your vengeance, but the price is as I said at the beginning]\n“…….”\nChun So-yeon is ready to pay the price of a miracle.\n[When your vengeance is complete, your soul will be mine for all eternity.]\nVentasis is the most dangerous divinity in Leon’s estimation.\nHe presides over the darkness of the world, the agent of vengeance and was the closest thing to an evil god.\n* * * *\nApart from the arrival of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild in Japan, Yappy was busy moving his mechanical arms.\nYappy’s workshop is a small one. The facilities are crammed so tightly together that Yappy’s tiny body can barely fit through the narrow entrance.\nThis has been optimal in terms of confidentiality, so Yappy has refrained from expanding the workshop.\nBut even that has reached its limit. The TTG Guild had secured a rare mineral called stardust, and it needed to be mass-produced.\n“Lord Yappy, are you in there?”\nBeatrice came to Yappy workshop.\nYappy quickly stopped working and stepped out through the cramped cylindrical opening.\n-What business?\n“I was wondering if you had the equipment ready.”\nSince the comet hit, Yappy had been in a hurry to get to work.\nOne of the first things he rushed through was Leon’s armor and his own platform upgrade, which needed more time than he thought.\nThey decided to start by crafting swords, spears, and armor for the knight cadets, which proved to be easier than expected.\nThe non-Grail Knight equipment had a relatively small amount of stardust in it.\n-No problem. Three more sets to go.\n“That’s amazing. I can’t believe you were able to craft so much equipment in such a short time.”\nBeatrice realized that the mechanical spider was working around the clock. But apart from that, the “machine” nature of its work meant that it repeatedly performed precise tasks, never deviating from the blueprints by a millimeter.\nAs a strong artificial intelligence, Yappy perfectly understands the knowledge and design ideas of Heto, the god of iron and blacksmithing, and implements them at 99.9%.\n“What’s with the 0.1%?”\n-Don’t know. A subtle error. The realm of the irreproducible.\nHowever, even the most perfect mechanical operation could not reproduce Heto’s knowledge perfectly.\nThe relatively unobtrusive knight’s equipment is no problem, but it’s Leon’s armor that makes the difference.\n-The reason for the delay in the production of His Majesty’s equipment. A 0.1% error made all the difference.\n“Divine power is a mysterious thing.”\nEven the mechanical spider admits it’s impossible to replicate and Beatrice said.\n“Lord Yappy, do you have any surplus stardust?”\nWith a six-kilometer comet, there was no shortage of material.\nHe had to filter out 99% of it, and then he had to filter out another 99% of the higher-grade stuff, and then the lower-grade stuff, but still, a six-kilometer comet was huge.\n-Kiruk?\n“If you don’t mind, I have something I’d like to prepare for you.”\nThe purple-eyed queen smiled brightly.\n* * * *\nThe Demon Sword has been pushed back a bit to make way for the Initiation Ceremony. The Knights’ Initiation Ceremony, to be exact.\nYappy, who has invoked the stars through a ritual and built a star iron forge with them, is tapping away at his equipment.\nLeon’s plan to create a Knight Order is almost buttoned up.\n“You will be a legion, an arm of the Alliance. Those who are called will come forward to receive their supplies.”\nFor this combined offensive, Leon summoned half of the 1,000 Man-At-Arms and all of the Knight Cadets. A reserve has also been formed in case of emergency, but with so many Hunters joining, the total mobilization is limited.\n-Is the Hanbit Palace also participating?\n-They’re a separate force from ours.\nBut what they lacked in numbers, they made up for with the participation of the Hunters of the Hanbit Palace, including Lord Park Yong-shin.\nThey were veteran Hunters who regarded Leon, who had removed the demonic seed, as their new leader.\n“As a servant of the Great Savior, I, Park Yong-shin, and the elite 1st and 2nd raiders’ teams, will gladly support you!”\nBeing able to field two A-ranked raiding teams was a sign of the strength of a top ten guild.\n“Ah… It seems that the direction of the fanaticism has changed.”\nJae-hyuk clicked his tongue as he looked at Park Yong-shin and the Hunters from Hanbit Palace.\nHa-ri from the next seat said.\n“Then it’s fanatical in a good way, so it’s okay, right?”\n“Isn’t it wrong because they’re real gods?”\n“That, that, that. And…I’m being weirdly supported over there.”\n“Still a priestess. I honor you.”\nThe priestess of Poma, of the sea and waves, of Petos, of war and flame, is number four on this expedition. She’s a knight of the TTG Guild who’s been knighted and given a manor, only to have the ceremony postponed.\nAs a priestess, she was treated like a boss even though Ha-ri was merely a lowly representative of the Hunter’s Association.\n“That’s why I’m so…….”\nKim Jae-hyuk is also a knight who uses the Holy Law of Ultima, the God of Sky and Thunder. Although he was not comparable to the Goddess, he had his own rank.\n“But Ha-ri. Is So-yeon’s sword also participating this time? I heard that her grandfather was against it.”\n“Hmm, I asked him about that too, but… His Majesty said it’s not his place.”\n“His Majesty?”\nLeon didn’t just say no, he said he didn’t have the right… Who the hell could discuss the law with the Lionheart King?\n“Han Ha-ri, Han Soo-ho, Kim Jae-hyuk and Chun So-yeon, come forward.”\nIt was then. One by one, the people Leon had summoned stood on the dais. Leon took the throne, flanked by Beatrice and Yappy.\nHa-ri and Jae-hyuk dreamed that one day they would sit next to them, that they would become Holy Knights.\n“Your accomplishments so far have been as I had hoped, especially Han Ha-ri.”\n“Ah, yes, Your Majesty!”\n“The gods favor the pure, but you have proven your purity and talent, and you are worthy.”\nAt Leon’s words, Ha-ri’s tense face brightened. There is no one in this place who does not admire the Lionheart King.\nHe exudes grace and authority, and his honor is beyond the cynical values of the modern world.\nIn spite of this, humans are bound to look up to heroes.\n“I give you a sword and a spear, light and heavy armor. These have been custom-made by Lord Spinner to optimize the use of your natural powers.”\nOn the other side of the room, the armor is brought in by none other than the Association’s chief appraiser, Park Su-jin.\nShe brought a sword not unlike Ha-ri’s, a jousting spear, and a pair of chainmail that looked easy to move around in.\n“You can wear the armor under your clothes, and I’ve got your halberd waiting for you in the barn.”\n“Oh, oh…….”\nHa-ri looked at the sword, spear, and chainmail with admiration. The armor, forged by Yappy using the Holy Law from stardust, was not ordinary, even by pretense, and the moment she accepted it──\n[Fight! As this goddess of war, become a frightening fire that burns the enemy!]\nPetos, the god of war and fire, blessed Ha-ri’s sword and spear.\n[Surrender yourself to the infinite; embrace a heart full of faith and trust.]\nPoma, god of the sea and waves, blessed Ha-ri’s armor.\nWhy is armor made of the god’s metal called stardust? It was to be blessed by the gods, for the gods look after their favored children.\n“The sword given to the goddess Han Ha-ri possesses the following powers.”\n[Flame-Blessed Starblade]\n[Rank: Legendary]\n[Description: A star iron blade blessed by Petos, the god of war and flame, imbued with the power of flame.]\n────\n────\n[Starplate Blessed by the Waves]\n[Rarity: Legendary]\n[Description: Blessed by Poma, the god of the sea and waves, this stardust armor is imbued with the power of the waves.]\n────\n────\nChief Park Soo-jin is overwhelmed with emotion when he receives Ha-ri’s armor.\nThe cadets and Man-At-Arms watching him are amazed.\nA legendary item? An item blessed by the gods?\nIt was worth tens of billions…No, it was an incalculable treasure.\n“Kim Jae-hyuk, come forward.”\nKim Jae-hyuk also received a sword, a spear, armor, and halberd. The gods also appeared and blessed his armor.\n[You will be endowed with the power of thunder. You will help the Lionheart King and become a judge to punish the wicked!]\nUltima, the god of heaven and thunder, blessed Kim Jae-hyuk’s armor with the blessing of heaven and thunder, and the power flowing through it was awe-inspiring.\nHan Soo-ho then received the blessing of Arianna, the goddess of light and justice, and his items also became Legendary. Finally, it was Chun So-yeon’s turn.\n“Chun So-yeon.”\n“Yes, Your Majesty.”\nLeon looked down at the dark-haired girl. Unlike all the other Knight Errant’s, the god within her was different.\n“Your grandfather has requested that you be removed from the raid.”\n“……!”\nThere was no Korean who didn’t know Chun So-yeon’s grandfather.\nThe guild leader of the Divine Sword Guild, Chun Jin-soo, the strongest Hunter Berserker in Korea.\nIt’s no wonder he’s worried about his granddaughter’s safety. Especially considering that this slaughter was to take down her father.\n“What do you want to do?”\n“I want to …… participate. No, I have to go.”\n“I see.”\nLeon stared at Chun So-yeon.\nThe divinity of darkness and vengeance gazing at this girl was…….\n“Then so be it.”\nWithout hesitation, he whispered doom into the girl’s ear.\nChun So-yeon was also given a weapon. Unusually, she was given a pair of twin swords, identical as if cut with a ruler.\n[Avenger]\nThe Dark God appeared to bless her armament. He is clad in a robe of black smoke, with no eyes, nose, or mouth visible within.\nAll that could be seen was endless darkness. Ventasis’ aura was very different from the other gods.\nUnlike the other gods, who felt holy and warmed by the mere sight of them, Ventasis cast an ominous, cold power around him.\nHis voice is sinister and eerie, devoid of any love.\nAll he affirms is the cruelty of humanity… for there is no humanity in it.\n[I affirm your vengeance; your gift will unite the darkness of doom; I alone will fulfill your wishes.]\nDarkness envelops her sword, armor, and spear, and are darkened by it.\nIt was so ominous and sinister that it seemed more like a curse than a gift from the gods.\nAnd just as the blessing of Ventasis was about to touch the last of the swords-─\n“……!”\nLeon grabbed it.",

      "content": "Chapter 110: The All Japan Hunter’s Association\nJust as Ventasis was about to bless the last sword with his power, Leon seized it.\n[What are you doing, great avenger?]\nVentasis’ gaze turned to Leon but Leon replied calmly.\n“Just a master’s concern for the future of his pupil.”\nAt that moment, a brilliant golden glow emanates from Leon. Arianna, the goddess of light and justice, appeared as his halo.\n[You will be a ray of light in a darkness that seems to have no end. This will be your way out, lost lamb.]\nArianna placed her blessing on the last sword Ventasis would bless. The endless darkness raged, unbowed by the golden light.\n[What are you doing, Light!]\n[I have only fulfilled my knight’s desire, Darkness.]\nTwo gods of opposite temperaments clash but it’s Darkness who backs down first.\n[You have a heartless and disgusting hypocrisy toward men, great avenger.]\n“For this king is king of men.”\n[As in the loss of ‘your daughter’?]\n“…….”\nThe light recoiled at the darkness’ words, but there was no stopping the non-existent mouth.\n[You are the heir of the Lionheart King, but you are also a descendant of Dragonia, and do not forget that your ancestors won glory in the darkness.]\n“I do remember. Guardian of the Ancestors.”\nVentasis could have been more furious. He could have made them pay for standing in the way of the gods’ blessings.\nHis ancestors owed him, and Leon himself.\nBut even this cold god of darkness is forced to be lenient in the face of an agent of the All-Gods. For to be an agent of the All-Gods is to include oneself in their assembly.\n[Do not forget the task that must be accomplished by relying on a single ray of light, for only in cold darkness will vengeance be achieved.]\nWith these final words of advice from Ventasis to Chun So-yeon, the armor ceremony continued.\nUnlike the previous four, the blessing was not bestowed upon their Stardust armor, due to their lack of strength and faith.\nEven in the Realm, blessed Stardust Armor was only given to Kingdom Knights.\n” Beatrice, I heard that you have something special for me.”\n“Yes.”\nFinally, Beatrice stood on the dais. She was followed by Yappy, who was carrying a haphazard pile of supplies.\n“These are the artifacts I have prepared for you. I hope they will help you in this fight.”\nBeatrice presented the cadets with artifacts: necklaces, rings, and earrings.\n“Wow, they’re all unique… I can’t believe you made so many unique items…….”\nPark Jin-soo was stunned, but that was the end of the supply distribution ceremony.\n* * * *\nThe Wandering Demon Sword is headed for Japan.\nJapanese government officials gathered in an urgent meeting.\nThe atmosphere in the room was one of disaster and the president of the association spoke.\n“Where is the All Japan Hunter’s Association?”\n“They’ll be here soon.”\n“Well… let’s deal with other matters first.”\nPrime Minister Fujisawa clicked his tongue at the hunters for not showing up at the announced meeting time.\n“What happened to the comet that hit South Korea?”\n“Yes, it’s a giant comet, six kilometers in diameter, and most of its interior is made up of gas and water, but it’s being mined for metals not found on Earth.”\n“The scientists have a fire in their eyes, so take this opportunity to interact and get some.”\n“It’s going to take a lot of money, and most of it is owned by those otherworldlers.”\n“I thought they claimed to have summoned the comet.”\nThe fact that Leon had summoned a comet to punish Hanbit Palace was a big deal around the world.\nEven the Wandering Demon Sword’s landing on the Japanese archipelago was secondary.\n“If that’s true, he’s a major security threat! We need to get to the bottom of how he summoned the comet!”\nYes, of course they should. Japan is not alone. The United States, the European Union, and Russia had similar reactions.\nEven though the comet hasn’t been in full swing since it fell, its presence has stunned the world.\nWhat if a single individual could actually summon a comet, a 6-kilometer comet, and shake it down with no loss of life, not even a single death?\nWhat if the reverse was also possible?\n“There’s a lot of buzz about him in Korea, too. The support for him is through the roof.”\n“I can’t believe they blindly support such a dangerous man…….”\nApart from that, the association executives could not hide their envy and disapproval of the survivor named Leon.\nIn essence, survivors are otherworldly beings, and they often come in races, the orcs being a prime example.\nBut they are not necessarily useful to the state. Orcs alone have been known to overrun nations with their horrifyingly high crime rates and fertility.\nIn the recent war, the Republic of Jilin alone was overthrown by an orc military coup.\nBut in Leon’s case, he has proven himself more useful than most survivors.\nThe Blessed Crops are the first of the scam items. Not only do they give buffs just by eating it, but it also gives permanent health, long-lasting buffs… and most importantly, it’s a cure-all for cancer.\n“Prime Minister, we need to secure a large amount of the Blessed Crop before the Demon Sword Campaign. If we secure that, we won’t have to think about securing additional buffers.”\nPrime Minister Fujisawa wore a puzzled expression as a senior official insisted.\nThe blessed crop has become a powerful export for the South Korean government, but the problem is that there are too many countries that want it, even though it has been harvested in large quantities.\nThe blessed crop is also being cultivated in places like the Heilongjiang People’s Republic and Ukraine, but even that hasn’t been enough.\n“Why should we bow our heads over rice?”\nThe defense minister didn’t hide his discomfort: He didn’t like the idea of being indebted to South Korea. It was a right-wing greeting.\n“Come to think of it, the rice is also the power of the Lionheart King Guild.”\nLeon is involved here, Leon is involved there.\nEver since he appeared in Korea they had been hearing stories about him.\n“Do you think you can persuade the Lion King to come to Japan?”\n“…… Is it possible? He’s already established a base in Korea.”\n“With government funding… Do you think it’s possible?”\n“Do you think the Korean government will stand still?”\nScouting and naturalizing high-level hunters from other countries has been a common practice around the world. It was just a matter of being able to handle the fallout.\n“It’s worth it. If we can get just one man, there’ll be a lot to come after him.”\nLeon isn’t the only one in the TTG Guild.\nWhile Leon himself is already considered a world-class Hunter beyond the standards of an S-ranked Hunters, the survivors below him are all monsters.\nThe red-ranked Nightmare Yakt Spinner of Cheongju Gate.\nAlthough its ranking is said to be greatly downgraded now, it is estimated to be an S+ at Cheongju Gate. According to unconfirmed reports, the Yakt Spinner was responsible for slaughtering the highest ranking orcs of the Jilin Republic.\nThen there’s Beatrice, the Magician Queen of the Kingdom of Spero, the second in command of the TTG Guild.\nHer magical prowess, demonstrated at Jeju Island Gate, was astonishing.\nShe doesn’t even have a Legendary-ranked wand and can perform great magic with a wave of her hand. Likewise, her rank is also S+.\n“What’s even more amazing is its ability to turn ordinary Hunters into elites in an instant. I’ve heard that there are already over a thousand C-ranked Hunters, and that’s in just four months.”\nThat’s Leon. Any nation can be free of the Gate’s threat if they can get their hands on him.\nThe prime minister had his own reasons for wanting to naturalize Leon.\n“I’ll be putting together the government budget, so this is a great opportunity to-”\n“I’m against it, Prime Minister.\nThe man who burst through the conference room door was middle-aged and dapper. He took a seat in the empty chair and bowed.\n“I apologize for being late. I got stuck in traffic.”\n“No, we were just getting started. President Kamiya.”\nThe President of the All Japan Hunter’s Association and the de facto pinnacle of Japanese hunters smirks.\n“Japan is a country of Japanese people. If you have that kind of resources, you’d be wise to take care of your own people.”\n“…….”\n“…….”\nThe dignitaries avoided rebutting Kamiya words. Nor did they discuss the national interest in bringing Leon in.\nWith 37 S-class Hunters from all over Japan, he is said to be the strongest Hunter in the country, and it is no exaggeration to say that he is the king of Japan.\nThere’s no way he’d allow a foreigner to enter his kingdom.\nThe prime minister knows this, so he wanted to bring Leon into the mix to keep the All Japan Association in check. Just as the president of the Korean Association, Oh Kang-hyuk, is supporting TTG Guild as a check on the Ten Guilds.\n‘Is it already… too late?’\nPrime Minister Fujisawa didn’t dare to antagonize or undermine the All Japan Association, which monopolized the Hunters and ran Japan as a single guild.\nIf only that idiot of a former prime minister hadn’t privatized the Hunter Association, this disaster wouldn’t have happened…….\nChairman Kamiya laughed at the prime minister’s cute defiance and proceeded to talk as if he were the organizer of the meeting.\n* * * *\n“Mr. Chairman, here is the list of targets that will be participating in this assault.”\nKamiya took the pad handed to him by his secretary and read it. As he picked out the S-class Hunters to send out from the pad, he thought back to the meeting earlier.\n“The prime minister must be getting impatient, bringing in foreign survivors.”\n“Because the government’s footprint has narrowed a lot lately.”\nSince the privatization of the Hunter Association by the former prime minister and the formation of the All Japan Association, hunters in Japan have united under Kamiya’s banner.\nThere are 38 S-class hunters and over 700 A-class hunters nationwide, including Kamiya, who have no other choice but to join the Japan Hunter Association if they want to make a living as a hunter.\nJust as Oh Kang-hyuk is supporting TTG Guild as a joker to keep the 10 guilds in check, the prime minister is trying to bring TTG Guild into the fold to narrow the ranks of the All Japan Association.\n“It’s scary that they’re actually a group that can do that.”\n“The power of the TTG Guild is frightening. Of course, it’s nothing compared to the Alliance.”\n“The problem is that such a group is in a neighboring country. I heard that there are already followers of the TTG Guild in Korea.”\n“Their……publicity power is frightening and there’s no opposition.”\nIt was just as strange. Even the Nippon Gakkai, who claimed to be a Japanese hero, was full of haters on the Internet.\n“Is that even possible?”\n“It’s conceivable that they’re waging some sort of publicity war… but I doubt it’s physically possible, because I’ve seen accounts deleted within seconds of any criticism being posted online.”\n“That doesn’t seem like the kind of intelligence group…….”\nMr. Kamiya also had a lot of interest in Leon. No, he couldn’t help it.\nHe was the embodiment of righteous chivalry, something out of a fairy tale, and that he had values that were at odds with modern times.\nEspecially the fact that he was accompanied by an unintelligible group of otherworldly gods called the Ten Thousand Gods.\n‘I thought the miracles of the gods might be able to manipulate internet public opinion, but I guess not……..’\n“Anyway, this demon sword battle. Not only the Divine Sword Guild, but the Ten Thousand Gods are participating. The prime minister has spent some money, too. Four more of Korea’s top ten guilds are coming. Blue Star, Fire Bird, Golden Lion, and Hanbit are coming.”\nJapan had turned a blind eye once before, during the Ulsan Magic Sword disaster but they’ve only paid dearly for it this time.\nThis, of course, was the work of Chairman Kamiya, who kept more than half of his S-class Hunters on standby in the name of defending the mainland.\nThe Japanese government, which is about to lose a major city, has no choice but to buy Korean hunters.\nWith an ample pool of S-class talent, Japan shouldn’t have to take such a loss, but Chairman Kamiya, whose power lies in the number of S-class Hunters, simply passed the buck to the government.\n“First operation. I’ll send the TTG Guild to the front.”\n“……!”\nAt those words, the secretary glanced at Chairman Kamiya with fear in her eyes.\nThe cornered prime minister was thinking of sacrificing TTG Guild to the netherworld just because he had an agenda.\n“The backlash from ……South Korea will be great.”\n“Of course, we should show good faith. Tell him we’re including three S-class strike teams.”\n‘A terrifying man.’\nCold-blooded, willing to sacrifice others for his own power. Even those three raiders would be rivals who threaten his position within the Alliance.\n“I’ll pass on the offer.”\n“Okay, did I mention that the Korean Hunters will be arriving soon?”\n“Yes. In three days, they’ll be arriving at Haneda Airport in the morning, accompanied by their leader, Oh Kang-hyuk. A meeting with the Prime Minister is also scheduled… His Majesty the Emperor is also coming?”\n“That’s unexpected, sir. Did they pay any attention to the state guest?”\n“Apparently, it was a request from the Korean Association.”\n“I suppose they want their own symbolism? Then let’s have a reception tonight. Make it as lavish as possible. I know he’s a bit of a pompous ass, but he’s still a medieval barbarian. If we give him the right amount of fanfare, he’ll be more than happy to take the lead, won’t he?”\nOf course, Mr. Kamiya doesn’t think he’ll get his way so easily.\nIf he had to, he would sway public opinion to drive the TTG Guild to its knees.\nBut he didn’t know that this man from another world, the King of the Fantasy World, was a fantasy man.\n“You are the king?”\nThe Japanese archipelago was turned upside down.",

      "content": "Chapter 111: Entry\n“Wow!”\nHaneda Airport was abuzz with activity for a state visit.\nMembers of the Self-Defense Forces unfurled a red carpet and held up a banner, at the end of which were government officials.\nPrime Minister Fujisawa flashed a public smile and waved to the assembled reporters, then sighed softly.\n“We’re welcoming some hunters, and we have to hold a reception like this.”\nIf this were a reception for a foreign head of state, he wouldn’t have been so disheveled.\nThe reason why the hunters, not the president of Korea, are being treated like this is because of the official request of the Korean Hunter Association and the government.\n[There’s a person who is very particular about status coming now, so let’s treat him properly.]\nWhen the prime minister received the call, he wondered if this was some kind of ego contest.\nThe relationship between Japan and Korea has always been an arms race, with each side trying to put the other down. This was true even after the cataclysm.\nFrom the nominal advantage of sending “friendly” reinforcements from South Korea, the news of Japan’s extreme treatment of the hunters is a matter of national pride.\nOf course, the Japanese government is also in a hurry to boost its national pride, but this time it was different.\n‘Fucking Kamiya…….’\nThe Japanese government was forced to swallow its pride due to the behavior of Mr. Kamiya, who was extremely reluctant to reduce the number of private soldiers.\nIt’s a good thing for Kamiya, who puts personal achievement ahead of the country, and it’s a good thing for Fujisawa, who is forced to bow to the outside world because of his internal struggles.\n‘But it’s not a bad picture if you look at it as a win-win. The more hunters that come from Korea, the less damage the Japanese hunters will suffer.’\nIn the end, the All Japan Hunter Association influence would not diminish.\nThis was when Prime Minister Fujisawa decided to take President Ahn Dong-il’s call as political.\n[For the record, this is not for any political purpose or part of a fight].\n“What… are you talking about?”\nHe heard the sincerity in his voice. If an elderly politician said something like this, he would be accused of being naive, but for a moment, Fujisawa took President Ahn’s words as genuine.\n[What I’m about to say is off the record.]\nHe meant, it shouldn’t have been said in public.\nOf course, it could have been reported as “Disrespectful to the President of South Korea!” but since he was in a position to help, Prime Minister Fujisawa took it cautiously.\n[Woohoo…….]\nCatching his breath, President Ahn Dong-gil said.\n[King Lionheart is a troublemaker.]\n“What… Do you mean?”\n[That’s exactly what I mean. I don’t want to worsen relations between Japan and South Korea by having an accident there! Armed conflict between the two countries? If an article like this appears, we’ll also be in trouble.]\nDeteriorating relations between Japan and South Korea is one thing, but armed conflict? It sounds like there’s a madman who will destroy everything if he gets a bad reception from the hunter they’re sending.\n“Is it that bad, that survivor from another world?”\n[No, it’s not that bad, he’s just out of this world, he’s just a fucking maniac.]\nAhn Dong-il’s words were diplomatically difficult to translate, but the meaning was there.\n[I want you to treat him as you would treat an Emperor, and I mean that.]\n“Hmmm…….”\nIn short, it was a request to be treated like a state guest during a state visit. Prime Minister Fujisawa was no stranger to politicians.\nHe made the announcement as if the Korean hunters had been bought like mercenaries at a cost of 1 trillion yen, but he was accepting help.\nIt was no secret that survivor common sense was out of sync with modern Earth, so the prime minister decided to exercise caution.\nThe runway had been emptied before the South Korean plane arrived and a red carpet rolled out from the landing strip.\nThe Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF), dressed in gold epaulets and white insignia, flanked the plane with Japanese and Korean flags.\nAt the end of the line are the representatives of the Korean Hunters, Chun Jin-soo, the head of the Divine Sword Guild, and Kang Jin-sung, the head of the Blue Star Guild, and the limousine that would carry Leon and Beatrice, who were like royalty.\nIt’s no exaggeration to say that the Queen of England received the same… or even less… courtesy when she visited a few years ago.\n“Prime Minister, an aircraft from the Korean Hunter Association has arrived!”\nSoon after, the Korean aircraft arrived at Haneda Airport. The aircraft carrying the Guild Leaders and Vice Guild Leaders landed and the doors opened.\n‘As they are the heads of private companies, there is no official order of protocol…….’\nHowever, even S-class Hunters have their differences.\nEven if it was the head of the Korean Association, Oh Kang-hyuk, who was a government official, he was usually followed by the head of the Divine Sword Guild, Chen Jin-soo, and the head of the Blue Star Guild, Kang Jin-sung.\nAnd as expected, it was Oh Kang-hyuk who was the first to get off.\n‘And then…….’\nIt was then. The next person to appear was an unexpected blond youth.\n“It’s the Lionheart King!”\n“Oh…!”\nThe reporters shone their spotlights and pointed their cameras at him. The next person to step forward was Leon, the guild leader of the TTG Guild.\nHe was followed by Beatrice, who wore the same otherworldly queen’s cotton robe.\n“Will you hold this king’s hand?”\n“Thank you.”\nLeon took her hand as he would a lady stepping out of a carriage, and she oozed fairy tale romance, like a knight and a lady from a long ago tale.\n“It’s bustling.”\n“It’s royal protocol; are you not used to it, Your Majesty?”\n“No. My caravan was always full of worshippers but that was two hundred years ago.”\nThe two walked down the red carpet to the familiar cheers of the audience. They were followed by the S-class hunters representing South Korea, but they were the obvious bridesmaids.\n“…….”\nPrime Minister Fujisawa was speechless for reasons unknown to the approaching duo.\nHe had met many heads of state during his political career.\nFrom dictators of developing nations to the President of the United States, the representative of the free world, to European royalty where the royal family still existed.\nAbove all, he regularly hosts the symbolic royal family, the nominal descendants of the gods in his own country.\nBut there was an unmistakable “aura” about Leon and Beatrice.\nRoyalty? Authority as rulers?\nNo, no, it’s something beyond that.\nIt’s a sense of class distinction…a violent class distinction… that you don’t get from a dictator, or a president, or a descendant of a dynasty that has survived to the present day.\nIt’s not just another name for a class that modern royalty, politicians, and businessmen use to distinguish themselves from the common man.\n‘Royalty. The pinnacle of class…….’\nThe raw difference of class. The way the real royalty, the ones with a clear class distinction, look at the commoners.\n“Prime Minister!!”\nThe chief cabinet secretary behind him urgently called out to the dazed prime minister.\nFinally, Prime Minister Fujisawa spotted Leon and Beatrice, who had arrived in front of him, and hastily bowed.\n“I’m Masamichi Fujisawa, acting Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Japan. Greetings to His Majesty the Lionheart King and Her Majesty Queen Alighieri of Spero.”\nThe prime minister did not offer a handshake as he would with any other head of state. It is not customary for a commoner to offer to shake hands with an emperor or royalty.\nHe wondered if he should bow to the emperor or royalty.\nHowever, this policy was strongly opposed by his secretaries.\nThe prime minister, as the country’s representative, shouldn’t bow to a foreign head of state.\nBut then Leon stuck out the back of his hand to the Prime Minister.\n“……!”\n“……!”\nThe meaning was clear to all onlookers.\nPrime Minister Fujisawa was stumped. He didn’t know how this would be received at home.\n[Prime Minister Fujisawa humiliated by Koreans.]\nThe Japanese, like the Koreans, wanted to be tough on Korea.\n‘Damn, this reminds me of when the Thai royalty came.’\nStill, it’s better than royalty demanding humiliating bowing. Prime Minister Fujisawa glanced at Beatrice, who was waiting behind Leon.\n‘The picture isn’t that bad.’\nLeon and Beatrice may have enemies in Korea, but they are otherworldly royalty.\nNot royalty in the modern sense of the word, but royalty with real authority and power.\nRather, Prime Minister Fujisawa’s response would be interpreted as a polite gesture of respect for the other’s culture.\n“It is an honor, Your Majesty.”\nPrime Minister Fujisawa kissed the back of Leon’s hand, then the back of Beatrice’s.\nSpotlights exploded around them. Judging by the reactions of the reporters, it’s not a bad reaction.\nThe reaction was rather enthusiastic, as the wind blew a cotton cloth and revealed the queen’s mantle.\n‘Okay, as long as the meeting between His Majesty the Emperor and Chairman Kamiya goes well, it’ll be perfect.’\nThe king and queen of another world visiting Japan and meeting with the Emperor of Japan. It was quite a picture.\nBut there was something Prime Minister Fujisawa had overlooked.\nFirst, the survivors of the Otherworld were given the privilege of interpreting.\n“Are you the King of Japan?”\nThe words come through unfiltered in the meeting with the Emperor.\n* * * *\nLeon’s “Are You the King of Japan” debacle turned the archipelago upside down.\n-Even if you’re a foreigner, if you come to Japan, you have to follow Japanese laws!\n-This is a grave disrespect to Japan. We should protest to the Korean government immediately!\nThe Korean government was also embarrassed.\nIt was an embarrassing moment for the Korean government, as it was the first time a hardline politician had spoken out against Japan.\nAlthough Oh Kang-hyuk, the president of the association, tried to correct him on the spot, Leon stubbornly refused to use the word “emperor” for the Japanese emperor.\n“How can you claim to be the lord of the heavens in a human body? Even the Heavenly King of the Eastern Empire only called himself a celestial being.”\nFor Leon, the sky’s the realm of God. Even if it’s an airplane or going into space, there is a strict division between the realm of gods and humans.\nIt’s hard to convince Leon, who doesn’t want to ignore Japan, but rather thinks it’s “unacceptable” in a pure sense.\nIn the end, to solve this diplomatic problem, Oh Kang-hyuk, president of the Association, had no choice but to play the hand of cultural relativism.\n“His Majesty is unfamiliar with Earth’s culture. On top of that, there’s the issue with the ‘interpreter’ for the survivors.”\nThe good news is that Leon is otherworldly royalty. Moderns were more tolerant of outsiders than they realized, and it worked out well.\n-If he’s foreign, he might not know our culture…….\n-He’s a survivor who appeared in Korea, so it’s kind of creepy…….\nNomenclature aside, Leon was pretty mean to Emperor Haruhito.\n“A gift from this king. Please accept.”\nLeon is quite generous with royalty. As he did with President Ahn Dong-gil, he did the Japanese emperor a favor.\n“Did you like it?”\nBeatrice nudged him, but he responded with a cold look.\n“Aren’t they pitiful.”\n“Pitiful?”\n“Yes. After all, royalty are those who lead the country but they are the puppets of the common people.”\nThis was a complete rejection of constitutional monarchy.\nOf course, Leon knows how this constitutional monarchy came to be, and that it is the natural political system on Earth.\nBut he was a pure-blooded nobleman who had been king for 300 years before he returned to Earth.\nIf he had been a puppet with no power, with his every move exposed to the media, he would have killed these lowlifes in an instant.\nThat was the definition of a king that Lionheart strived for.\n“But I still don’t feel it.”\n“What?”\n“It is said that the clan of these men called kings are descended from gods of long ago. They claimed to be true and living gods until quite recently.”\nOf course, he knew this was the same historical propaganda everywhere but Leon had his own expectations.\nMaybe there really was a god on this planet, maybe the myths weren’t false after all… he thought.\n“What was the result?”\n“They are not gods. They are mere mortals.”\nSo there really are no gods in this land.\nLeon swallowed back a bitter feeling.\n* * * *\nChairman Kamiya welcomed the Korean Hunters to Japan.\n“My name is Kamiya.”\n“This is Oh Kang-hyuk, Chairman Kamiya.”\nThe official representatives of the two countries shook hands, and then the Hunters, each other’s mainstays, exchanged pleasantries.\nOh Kang-hyuk first introduced Chun Jin-soo, the representative hunter of Korea, while Kamiya introduced himself and Takeda, the S-class hunter representing Japan.\nIt was a kind of face-off between the two countries.\nThe question came next.\n“Among the Hunters of your country, there is a man called the King of the Otherworld.”\n“You mean His Majesty Lionheart.”\nOh Kang-hyuk was cautious about revealing Leon, worried that Japan might try to use him as a government tool.\nStill, he couldn’t resist introducing Leon during the visit. President Oh Kang-hyuk turned to Leon, who was holding a champagne glass in the center of the banquet hall.\n“Your Majesty, how are you enjoying the banquet?”\n“Well, so-so.”\n“I’ve told you before, I’m President Kamiya, head of the Hunter’s Association of Japan.”\nPresident Kamiya stood in awe of the blonde young man in front of him.\n‘He has an unbelievable presence.’\nTTG Guild is arguably the largest guild in Korea.\nHowever, the majority of its members are Class C Hunters. Considering that a single Class A Hunter could take on 50 Class C Hunters, TTG Guild only had more numbers.\nBut what about Leon in front of him?\nOn paper, he looks like he could have grown up in a noble family in Europe.\nHowever, there’s a sense of old age in him that you don’t get from a child. He has a look in his eyes that tells you he’s looking down on you.\nThere’s a dignity about him that doesn’t make you doubt that he’s a king and a gaze that could even be described as arrogant.\nHis own strength is said to be beyond S-class and Chairman Kamiya didn’t doubt that assessment for a moment.\n‘It’s a good thing that someone like this appeared in Korea.’\nThis is his kingdom. He doesn’t need foreigners like Leon so Kamiya held his tongue and offered Leon his hand to shake.\n“My name is Kamiya.”\n“…….”\nLeon stared at Kamiya’s outstretched hand and said.\n“How dare a commoner try to touch the jade body of royalty?”\nLeon’s unfiltered words immediately reached President Kamiya and he frowned.\n‘This is how they treat me in Japan.’\nHe is the unified head of the Hunters across Japan, an absolute power that not even the Prime Minister can control. In other words, he’s the king of Japan.\nBut such “petty power” is only a fleeting moment for Leon, who is the embodiment of classism.\nIf Kamiya had been a member of a governmental organization instead of a private one, he would have been treated no differently than the President of the Association, Oh Kang-hyuk.\nTo Leon, Kamiya was an ordinary scribe who didn’t even count as a foreign dignitary.\n“You’re rude.”\nWhen Leon refused to shake Mr. Kamiya’s hand, S-class Hunter Takeda behind him spoke up.\nHe was an S-class hunter, the right-hand man of the former president. It is no exaggeration to say that he is the most powerful man in Japan after Mr. Kamiya.\nAs he cranked up his magic power to point out Leon’s disrespect, air-altering magic waves surged through the banquet hall.\n“Ugh…….”\nThe enormity of the magic wave was enough to surprise even the legendary Korean association president Oh Kang-hyuk.\n‘Indeed, the man who is said to be the next strongest in Japan after Kamiya is not an ordinary person.’\nBut Oh felt strangely confident. He didn’t have the slightest thought that Leon would lose.\n“You spoiled your dog, and that’s the responsibility of the dog’s owner.”\n“……!”\nTakeda’s brows narrowed at the unspeakable insult. But then… there was a knock on the chairman’s door.\n“Chairman Kamiya…!”\nThe man, an employee of the All Japan Hunter Association, rushed over and whispered in his ear.\n“It’s the Wandering Demon Sword──”\nChairman Kamiya’s eyes widened at that.\n* * * *\nIn the vast ocean there was not a single fishing boat in sight, and an object that was clearly alien parted the sea.\nIt was a magic sword, the main body of the demon swordsman who caused the London massacre and bathed in the blood of countless hunters and citizens.\nIt cuts a straight line across the sea, carrying its host on its back.\n“…….”\nThe sixth generation Demon Swordsman stood on the blade of the Demon Sword and stared out over the endless horizon.\nIt was then that the world warped in the path of the Demon Sword. Space split like a mirror, and a gate to a new dimension opened in this world.\nThe gate that appeared out of nowhere off the coast of Japan swallowed him whole.\nA moment later──\n-Kiyaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nCountless monsters burst out of it and behind the monsters that poured out with the dungeon break, the Demon Swordsman muttered.\n“A thousand…oxen…….”",

      "content": "Chapter 112: Landing\n“What do you mean a Dungeon Break!?”\nThe observers couldn’t hide their confusion at Kamiya’s exclamation.\nThe Wandering Demon Sword is a major target for round-the-clock surveillance. Ever since the London Incident, this black-rank magic sword had been wandering the world, and military satellites around the world had been monitoring it in real time, and its traveling routes were known.\nIts speed is not very fast. It can fly, but it also needs food and rest to keep their living hosts alive.\nIt would be another three days before it would reach Japan……..\n“There’s a gate in the sea all of a sudden? Is it a coincidence?”\nA gate appeared on the path of the Wandering Demon Sword. It was a gate that was implicitly called the Dragon Palace Gate.\n“According to the information provided by the surveillance team, the demon sword entered the gate at the same time as the Dragon Palace Gate appeared.”\n“The demon sword entered the gate?”\n“Then they say a dungeon break occurred right as the gate appeared…….”\nThis was unprecedented.\nNormally, it takes at least ten days for a dungeon break to occur after the appearance of a gate. It took time for the internal magic to overflow and for the gate to expand.\nLooking at it this way, didn’t the Wandering Demon Sword seem to have artificially caused the gate’s dungeon break?\n“Is it possible that the Wandering Demon Sword summoned the gate by itself?”\n“Boo, it’s impossible, there’s no precedent for such a thing──”\n“It is not impossible.”\n“……!”\nEveryone focused on the voice that came from the direction of Chairman Kamiya and his group, and at the end of their gaze was none other than Leon and Beatrice.\n“……What do you mean?”\n“He said it’s not impossible to artificially create a gate.”\n“…….”\nBehind Leon’s back, even the president of the association, Oh Kang-hyuk, looked surprised. Chairman Kamiya could guess that it was something that even Oh didn’t know about.\n“We need to talk…….”\n“It’s an emergency. I’ll share the necessary information.”\n* * * *\n“There have been additional dungeon breaks, starting with the Dragon Palace Gate, which occurred 700 kilometers off the coast of Shikoku.”\nInside a conference room high ranking Hunters from South Korea and Japan are gathered.\nThey swallowed hard as they looked at the information on the holographic display shared by Japanese intelligence.\n“What was that, a series of gates in the same place?”\nHuang Yeon-ha, the younger sister of Golden Lion Guild Leader Golden Chul, looked at the increasing number of gates on the holographic display and expressed disbelief.\nIt’s not uncommon for gates to occur back-to-back in the same area. Right now, there are about three or four gates a day in Seoul.\nThe problem is that there aren’t that many gates at sea, and it’s unprecedented for them to cause dungeon breaks one after another.\n“Observation video.”\nThe video showed the Wandering Demon Sword in the middle of the ocean and its host, Lake Tianji.\nStanding on the ocean like a martial arts master in a martial arts novel, he entered the summoned gate, and then exited it with countless monsters.\n“The Wandering Demon Sword… is causing a dungeon break?”\n“How is that possible?”\n“It’s impossible!”\n“It’s possible, and it’s happening in front of our eyes.”\nThe Dragon Palace Gate is itself the seed of a disaster that the nation must exterminate with all its might.\nFour such Dragon Palace Gates appeared in a row and the demon sword even caused artificial dungeon breaks before they had time to react.\n“Damn, the sea off the coast of Japan is polluted…….”\nAnd it’s the Japanese Hunters who take it even more seriously.\nThe gate emits a huge amount of miasma at the same time as the dungeon break, which pollutes the land and demonizes the animals.\nOn land, this would not be a problem, but in the middle of the ocean, a dungeon break causes serious national damage.\nOn land, you’d spend money to clean it up, but in the middle of the ocean, the accessibility and scope of the problem is different.\n“We’ve got a lot of work ahead of us.”\nWhile the Japanese hunters and government officials were in a terrible mood, the leader of the Divine Sword Guild, Chun Jin-soo, was as nonchalant as ever.\n“You think it’s someone else’s country?”\nTakeda didn’t like that, and gave him a sharp glare.\n“Of course it’s someone else’s country. It’s not like we’re f*cked.”\n“You…!”\n“No, I’m not, you wide-eyed little brat, I’m a few years older than you are!”\nChun Jin-soo doesn’t let go of his goofy spirit even in this situation. In fact, he felt no remorse for Japan’s catastrophe.\nHe was a patriot, but at the same time, he lived half of his life in a time when Japan and Korea had not established diplomatic relations, and he had been on the ground in a more direct way.\nAbove all, he was a person who was deeply disappointed by Japan’s behavior in the Ulsan tragedy.\nHe was the only one who participated in Japan’s attack on the Demon Sword not to help our hated neighbors, but to deal with his biological son and the host of the Demon Sword.\n“That’s enough. What are you doing to the young?”\nUnlike Chun Jin-soo, who was quite outspoken, Kang Jin-sung of the Blue Star Guild was not amused. He’s one of the legends of his generation, and his bitterness makes Chun Jin-soo sit up and take notice.\nKang Jin-sung turned to the former.\n“It seems that the enemy is still in the process of creating a dungeon break in the sea. What is the scale of it so far?”\n“Ah, yes, there have been three dungeon breaks so far, and there are about twenty thousand monsters that came out of them!”\n“That’s a lot.”\nDungeon Breaks are usually caused by a failed strategy.\nIn other words, the number of monsters inside the gate had been reduced by quite a bit during the process.\nHowever, the dungeon break caused by the Wandering Demon Sword occurred while the gate was still intact, without the raiding party having a chance to enter, so naturally, the scale of the break is not comparable to the previous one.\n“Where did the Wandering Demon Sword go?”\n“It…disappeared into the sea right after the gate was summoned.”\n“……It’s been hiding its submergence ability all this time.”\nAll of the information and prerequisites for the Wandering Demon Sword so far had been overturned.\nSummoning a gate and diving into the sea.\n“Diving is one thing. What is summoning a gate, and is a gate something that can be artificially summoned?”\n“Let me explain that part.”\nIt was Beatrice who spoke up, the cotton-cloaked magician queen deftly maneuvering a laser point and playing a file sent to her by ‘Yappy’ from Korea.\n“About four weeks ago, our TTG Guild, along with the Hunters of the United States, attacked the East Sea Gate.”\nOne of South Korea’s ten guilds, Lee Yong-wan, had participated in it, and the discovery of the Demon Archduke Rakshar had made headlines around the world.\nEven Skazakari, the one who caused the Shanghai disaster, was only an Archdemon, but a Demon Archduke?\nThat overturns the information that the highest-ranking demons are Archdemons.\nOf course, since he didn’t cause a dungeon break and appear in the real world, it wasn’t a big deal, but government agencies took it seriously enough.\nIf there was a Demon Archduke on top of the Archdemons, there could be more.\n“From there, we became suspicious of the ‘gate’ and the ‘system’ and the ‘quests’ it gave us, and we came to a conclusion.”\n“What… is that?”\nHunters from both Japan and Korea dreaded TTG Guild answer, questioning what they had taken for granted.\nOf course, many scholars had suspected and theorized about the gate or system, but it was all speculation.\nBut this guild of survivors had come to a conclusion, and it could be expected that it would not be information that was desirable to humanity.\n“The conclusion was that the gates…were an artificially created phenomenon.”\n“No way!”\nIt was such a shocking declaration that everyone was in denial. But Beatrice presented the video footage from Yappy as evidence.\nBeatrice had created a gate using a large amount of magic stones, and from there, she could see the “field” inside the gate that Yappy had observed.\n“Crazy…….”\n“She can artificially summon a gate?”\n“That would break the whole idea of gate attacking…….”\nIf it is indeed possible to artificially summon gates, then all you have to do is summon a series of gates in the middle of the ocean, just like the Wandering Demon Sword is doing now.\nHumanity would lose its oceans and be doomed.\nIn the midst of the commotion, everyone with their own ideas, Leon spoke up.\n“Be quiet.”\nLeon is, technically, only the most marginalized newcomer here.\nHe’s not even officially qualified as an S-class Hunter, and even though his guild is large, most of the members are C-class Hunters.\nThere are countless S-class Hunters here, as well as leaders of large guilds.\nStill, Leon’s words quieted the room.\n“It’s clear we can handle the Gate phenomenon and once we’re realized that, it’s clear what we must do.”\nDeal with the Demon Sword before it creates more Gates. The solution is always simple and clear.\n“Prepare for a defensive battle. Prepare for their landing and locate the sword.”\n“Arbitrary orders──”\nTakeda started to say, but Chairman Kamiya cut him off with a wave of his hand. Even in this situation, he made a quick profit and loss calculation.\n“The Wandering Demon Sword is strong, and the monsters that are about to land are probably just trying to attract attention.”\nChairman Kamiya looked at the Hunters from both Japan and Korea.\n“We’ll form a separate squadron to maneuver as soon as the Wandering Demon Sword appears, with only the most elite Hunters to attack it.”\nKamiya’s plan was as follows\nDepending on the landing route of the monsters, the main S-class strike force will be divided into three groups and loaded onto transport planes.\nThe plan is to drop the S-class raiders directly into the area where they appear and respond immediately.\nIt’s a tactic that’s only possible because of the availability of aircraft.\n“That’s good, we’ll be able to join them quickly.”\nYong-wan thought the plan was perfectly reasonable. The only problem was… how would the teams be formed?\nIn any case, Chairman Kamiya’s plan went through.\n* * * *\nThe first monsters to land were an army of monsters called Mermen.\nLed by Class A Fieldboss Seiren, thousands of Mermen, with their hideous appearance and sharp tridents, descended on Miyazaki Prefecture, southeast of Kyushu, Japan.\n“Gunners stand by.”\nAnd before them stood a group of hunters.\nUnlike inside the gate, where high-tech equipment could not be mobilized, hundreds of hunters, whose routes had been mapped out by satellites and reconnaissance aircraft, were waiting for the monsters to land.\n-Sii-yin…!\nThe Merman’s gills flapped menacingly as they saw the Hunters. They charged straight for the Hunters, and the orderly Hunters opened fire in unison.\n“Fire!”\nA barrage of ranged fire pummeled the Mermen, and with that, a hand-to-hand combat erupted, swords and spears clashing.\n-Bang, bang, bang…!\nAnd in the midst of this landing defense battle a large helicopter carrying Hunters circles the area.\n“…….”\nEven Chen Jin-soo, who usually opens his mouth, Golden Chul, who is full of confidence, Lee Yong-wan, who is busy calculating the profit and loss, and Ha Yuri, who is watching from the sidelines, did not let go of the tension for this moment.\nThe Korean-Japanese Hunter Alliance was spread out towards the predicted landing site of the monster that had burst out of the Dragon Palace Gate.\nBasically, the landing force would be blocked by the Hunters on the ground, and the helicopters would be used to mobilize when the Wandering Demon Sword appeared. The idea is to create a star squadron to deal with the sword.\nIn other words, the S-class Hunters aboard the helicopter are the ones who will fight the black-rank Wandering Demon Sword.\nAt this moment, with the world’s most dangerous battle ahead, everyone is nervous.\n‘Damn, why isn’t the Lionheart King here?’\nYong-wan was disappointed that Leon wasn’t among the three forces that split into Miyazaki, Shikoku, and Wakayama.\nTTG Guild is waiting in Wakayama with Park Yong-shin of Hanbit Palace. They’re scheduled to join him in the event of an emergency, but he can’t help but think he’d be safer with them.\n“What about the other side?”\nYong-wan asks and Ha Yuri checks her tactical pad.\n“Japanese Hunters are fighting monsters that landed in Wakayama. The TTG Guild is in the rear.”\n“That’s surprising.”\nHuang Yeon-ha, who had seen the TTG Guild act, said.\n“What, My Sister?”\nGolden Chul interrupted.\n“I thought His Majesty the Lionheart King would say that he would fight first, out of chivalry and honor.”\n“Certainly. He’s the kind of guy who talks like that.”\nLeon is the embodiment of chivalry straight out of a medieval history book.\nOf course, that chivalry is vastly different from the chivalry of modern Earth, but it’s not so different that he’s obsessed with winning and earning honors.\n“I don’t think so. He’s surprisingly not the type to make the first move.”\n“Senior Yong-wan, what does that mean?”\nYong-wan shrugged, but he was the one who had fought with Leon the most.\n“It’s basically a commander’s style, whether it’s refraining from taking the lead or getting enough information…….”\nYong-wan has watched Leon fight and capture gates a few times.\nHe saw how he acted in the Jeju Island gate and during the Cheongju Gate.\nEven in the battle against the Yakt Spinner at Cheongju Gate, where Golden Chul fought, this incarnation of chivalry was not one to take the lead.\n“He may be active in the decisive parts of battles, but he leaves the basic outposts to his subordinates, which is probably why his guild is so strangely ‘militarized’.”\n“Definitely…more of an army than a traditional raiding style.”\nThis contradicts the misconception that Leon is known for his knightly style of ‘charging in’ at random.\nLeon knows he’s a king, and as such, he’s cautious in his actions. He knows all too well that he is irreplaceable.\nStill, the image of Leon as a vanguard, smashing everything in his path, is a result of the impact of his combat prowess.\n“Enough of that, get ready to fight, we’re closing in.”\nThat’s when Chun Jin-soo, who was sharpening his blade alongside Kang Jin-sung, pointed to the ground beyond the helicopter’s window.\nThe field bosses at the gate could be seen slowly emerging.\n“I can see quite a few large Class A field bosses, we’ll have to deal with them──”\nBefore Yong-Wan could finish his sentence, the sky lit up.\nNo, more than the sky, higher, beyond the stratosphere.\nSomewhere in space, a light flashed and shot down vertically.\nA charged particle with no mass penetrates the crown of the field boss’s head. It was a pinpoint snipe, with an error of less than 0.01 millimeters.\nThe heated, sub-luminescent particles hit the seawater, causing it to boil instantly, with secondary damage.\n-Eek, eek, eek, eek?!\nA whole bunch of mermen were instantly turned into boiled meat.\n“…….”\n“……What is it?”\nHa Yuri nonchalantly replied to the stupid Golden Chul question.\n“Don’t ask me…….”",

      "content": "Chapter 113:\nDisaster\nAfter the Cataclysm, humanity felt the need to proactively attack the Gates in order to prevent them from dungeon-breaking.\nTo do so, they first needed technology to identify the gates as soon as they occurred, and the technology they used was space technology.\nOrbital weapons represented by the Staff of God were commercialized, and reconnaissance satellites with powerful navigation capabilities covered the Earth’s orbit to search for gates around the clock.\nStarfield, the Great Gate Reconnaissance Satellite, is the largest space structure on Earth, a collaboration of space development nations around the world.\nBuilt by 20 countries around the world, including the United States, this next-generation reconnaissance satellite is the largest space structure on Earth at 150 meters and a space platform with 27 satellites covering the entire globe.\nIt observes and delivers information from space and Earth in real time.\nIts technological capabilities are the sum total of human wisdom. No space technology can surpass it, and if it does, it will never belong to Earth’s civilization.\n“This is Star One. This is Star One, base, come in!”\nAnd so it was in the main communications room of the Starfield. U.S. astronaut Johnson frantically tried to communicate with Mission Control in Houston.\n[What’s going on, Johnson?]\nThe U.S. space agency has been on edge lately.\nThe agency has been heavily criticized for the hacking of the God’s Staff during the Jilin orc coup and the recent failure to predict the impact of a 6-kilometer comet on Earth.\nBut it would also be embarrassing for the space agency.\nWho would have thought that the ironclad, invulnerable network of God’s staff would be hacked at the same time as Russia’s 5M65 Grizzly?\nAnd who knew that a perfectly good comet would suddenly enter Earth’s orbit and crash into South Korea, nearly wiping out the human race.\nAnyway, the event happened, and the organization was tense. Astronaut Johnson spent an unusually intense day on the observation mission and spotted “it”.\n“Please confirm that there are no other satellites within three kilometers of this one!”\n[Three kilometers? There can’t be a satellite that close.]\nAfter a moment of silence, the ground station returned a common sense answer.\n[There are no other satellites in that vicinity.]\n“No, there are! What is that thing I’m seeing?”\n[What the hell is it?]\n“At least 400 meters long…! At least 2,000 tons of mass! I also see a structure that looks like a particle accelerator. Could it be…a charged particle cannon?”\n[Ha… it’s not April Fool’s Day yet, Johnson.]\n“No, it’s real!”\nIt’s not even visible on radar but at close range, it was visible to the naked eye. The plasma particles even sped up and shot something toward Earth.\nJohnson wouldn’t have noticed it if it weren’t for the glow from the blue particle’s sub-luminescence.\n“Shit! I’m going to take a picture and send it to you, so you can see for yourself!”\nBut Johnson didn’t know that someone was already listening to his communications with the U.S. base in Houston, and they had the means to disrupt them.\n“What, what, why isn’t the data coming through?”\n[Johnson…pull this shit one more time and I’ll report you to the higher-ups, you know the atmosphere around here with the comet.]\n“Gee, I’m serious!”\nJohnson was jumping up and down like a madman, but no one believed him.\n* * * * *\n-Information control complete.\nThe TTG Guild compound in Naju, South Korea.\nYappy had prevented the information from the satellites that had been hastily launched for this operation from spreading.\nEarth’s military satellites are of a very low standard.\nThe destructive power of the weapons themselves is forgivable, but maximizing their power is something anyone can do if they’re just plugged in.\nThey had no reconnaissance or communications security capabilities that mattered.\nYappy had launched his own satellites to give Leon more accurate information. It’s not a small low-orbit satellite from the last gate, but a full-fledged offensive military satellite.\nTechnically, it will be developed into a war satellite that launches an integrated armed platform from geostationary orbit rather than a satellite, but…….\n-Lack of space law. Constraints on development. Information control needs to be strengthened.\nThis barbaric planet doesn’t even have laws for space development, so they had to operate under the radar.\nAside from that, Yappy confirmed the previous bombardment at the risk of exposing the information.\n-Sniped 13 Class A Field Bosses. Confirmed 1,322 targets eliminated due to AoE damage on the main battlefield.\nThat’s a lot of kills and the logic circuitry that powers the AI has spoken.\n-The charged particle cannon particle accelerator needs to be cooled and further refined.\n-Failed to track enemy special object ‘Wandering Demon Sword’. Blind spots due to planetary rotation.\n-Need to go to a geostationary orbit above 36,500 kilometers.\n-Rejected. Charged Particle Cannon effective range 450 kilometers. Cannot support friendly forces.\n-Recommended to replace the main armament with the Holy Grail. Can be equipped with doomsday armor.\n-Rejected. City damage.\nLeon will not tolerate blowing up a city to kill a monster.\n-Start working on the rocket launcher.\nThere’s only so much Yappy can do in this situation.\nYappy looked down at the pure white starlight armor he was still tapping with his mechanical arm.\n-Make deadlines. Deadline.\nYappy continued to work, moving his mechanical arms busily while simultaneously processing and checking information.\n-North Korea unobservable?\nSomething black was covering the northern part of the Korean Peninsula.\n* * * *\n“The monsters that tried to enter Tokushima City have all been dealt with. What about you?”\nTakeda asked, as the other Hunters reported through his earpiece.\n[Minamijo’s horde of merman has been dealt with]\n[Anansi’s side is also cleared]\nThe landing of tens of thousands of monsters from the Dungeon Break was certainly a threat.\nHowever, in this area alone, there were seven S-class Hunters and two hundred A-class Hunters from Japan, including Takeda. In addition, there were more than three thousand other Hunters from various branches.\nA few A-class Field Bosses have shown up, but they’re just warm-ups for the S-class Hunters.\nTakeda looked around at the piles of Merman corpses around him.\n“What about the Koreans?”\nThey couldn’t have done it any faster than they did. Takeda, who doesn’t admit it, but has a competitive streak against Korean Hunters, checked the status of the Korean side.\n[The battle was said to have ended thirty minutes ago. Both Miyazaki and Wakayama successfully prevented the landing.]\n“……Thirty minutes ago?”\nIt was fast. Strangely fast.\nThe South Korean S-class hunters were fewer than their Japanese counterparts.\nExcluding the hunters from the Tokyo area and the Hokkaido chapter, there were only thirteen mobilized S-class hunters. Six of them are on the Korean side.\nBut they’re not the main force. Even the same S-class, there’s a big difference, and the six S-class hunters on this side, where Takeda is, are the strongest in Japan.\nBut they were able to take out the landed monsters faster than Takeda’s team?\n‘Were there fewer monsters that landed?’\nNo. Even if there were, could it make such a difference? Takeda asked the control center.\n“What about the Lionheart King? Did he go out on his own?”\n[He is on standby]\n“……And the Queen?”\n[Likewise on standby, but… there was a strange ‘shelling’ in the sky…….]\n‘It must be the queen.’\nHe’s not a mage himself but he heard that the magician queen of the Spero Kingdom is fearsome.\nTakeda, who knew what the firepower of mages could do on the battlefield, naturally assumed that it was Beatrice who took care of the landed monsters.\n[Takeda.]\nIt was then. Chairman Kamiya, who oversaw the All Japan Association, the heart of the control center, sent Takeda a personal communication.\n“Yes, Mr. Chairman.”\n[Team 4 hasn’t sent a response since earlier, so let’s check before the monsters make their second landing.]\n“Is it possible that the Demon Sword has appeared?”\n[No Magical Swordsman were spotted, only Land Sharks, which are boss-level entities.]\nA class A field boss rated above the Orc Warrior in terms of difficulty, but Team 4 has the S-class Hunter Nishimori, so there’s no way they would have been defeated.\n‘Device malfunction.’\nIt’s a common occurrence in the field.\nThe four-team perimeter is about a 10-minute drive from where Takeda is and as an S-class Hunter, Takeda could get there in two minutes.\n“Ishida, Fumio, you two follow me, and give your team leaders a heads-up just in case.”\n“Understood.”\nTakeda, the right-hand man of Kamiya, the president of the All Japan Association, was seasoned and cautious. The five remaining S-class Hunters would move quickly on orders from the control center.\nTakeda arrived in the area with the two A-class Hunters… and doubted his own eyes.\n“Damn it…….”\nEven the cool-headed Takeda reacted this way, and the two Hunters who followed him recoiled in horror.\n“No way…….”\n“Nishimori-san was killed?”\nIt was true. All twenty hunters from the four teams that had lost contact were found dead.\nSome had been decapitated, others cut diagonally from the shoulder blades. Some were missing their lower half or had been sliced open from the crown of their heads.\n“Whoa…….”\nTakeda swallowed hard. The four teams of Hunters were the elite of the elite that he had raised himself. Especially the S-class Hunter Nishimori, who was the best swordsman in the Alliance…….\nLooking down at the mangled corpses of his fellow Hunters, Takeda honors them with a short moment of silence. Then he analyzes them coldly.\n‘Strong and destructive swordsmanship.’\nThere is a school of swordsmanship called Yufa but it has been sharply divided since the advent of the Hunters.\n‘Destructive and fierce swordsmanship. The swordsmanship of the Berserker Chun Jin-soo.’\nChun Jin-soo swordsmanship was famous for being better suited to monsters than humans. Even in hand-to-hand combat, he could shatter defenses with his overwhelming blasts.\nHe used his superhuman athleticism to leap around, scattering destructive kills.\nThere’s no way Chun Jin-soo could have attacked the Japanese Hunters, so there’s only one answer.\n“Four teams have been wiped out by the Demon Sword.”\nChun Ji-ho, the genius swordsman who was the successor of Chun Jin-soo.\n“How the hell did…….?”\n“Takeda-san, look this way!”\nFumio urgently called out to Takeda. Where he pointed was the corpse of a huge monster… a land shark, and it was a strange one at that.\n“There’s a mark on it that looks like it came out from inside.”\n“No way…….”\nHe was swallowed by a monster to avoid detection and ripped open the monster after landing?\n“Damn it. Why is he suddenly acting like this?”\nNone of the six generations of Demon Swordsmen had ever done anything like this, and the previous generation of Demon Swordsmen had been wiped out in less than two years… Is this kind of strategic activity possible in the fourth year?\n“Why now?\nThe unanswered question was buried with the next message.\n[Team 2 is unreachable!]\n* * * *\n“Demon Sword!”\nYong-wan and his crew, who were preparing for the second landing, blinked at the urgent communication.\n“Demon Sword? We couldn’t confirm it with the satellite reconnaissance!”\n“That, that… there are reports that it seems to have protruded from a monster’s stomach!”\n“Why is he doing something he’s never done before?”\nThe summoning of the gate and the behavior of the demon sword and the demon swordsman were completely different from before. But apart from that, the S-class Hunters, who were acting as a separate unit, had to leave immediately.\n“Where did they come from, Shikoku or Wakayama?”\n“Shikoku! We’ve already lost three S-class Hunters from the Japanese side alone! Hunter Takeda is rallying all the teams!”\n“Three have already been defeated?”\nLee Yong-wan hesitated for a moment, but Chun Jin-soo shouted out in anger.\n“Let’s go!”\nThe Osprey took flight and as the transport, purchased for 15 billion yen each, carried them over the island of Shikoku, where the Takeda team was, Yong-wan asked.\n“Id His Majesty the Lionheart King coming?”\nThe idea of finding Leon there on the other side of the world caused Chun Jin-soo and Kang Jin-sung to glare at him, but Ha Yuri, Golden Chul, and Huang Yeon-ha gave him a look of understanding.\n“Uh… that.”\n“What, what, he couldn’t have been hit!”\n“He landed briefly due to a mechanical anomaly, and was shot down by a ranged attack from monsters on takeoff…….”\n“Holy shit!”\nHe didn’t say that out of concern for Leon, because he was pretty sure that thing would survive a fall from space.\nThe problem was that it would delay Leon’s arrival.\n“Well, can we just not go?”\n“What the fuck are you talking about?”\nChun Jin-soo glared and slapped him, but Yong-wan was uneasy.\nHe was the embodiment of self-preservation and a well-connected businessman.\nHis senses were warning him of danger but he was more afraid of Chun Jin-soo in front of him. After all, the plane had already departed.\n“Landing!”\nThe tilt-rotor plane’s rotor blades rose vertically as it approached over Shikoku Island. With no open space to land, the South Korean S-class Hunters had to jump from 50 meters in the air.\n“Hutcha…!”\nChun Jin-soo and Kang Jin-sung landed, along with 50 other elite Korean A-classes and Takeda greeted them.\n“Thank you for coming.”\nTakeda was pleased with the arrival of the Korean Hunters; he’d lost contact with the second team and gathered them all in one place at the same time.\n“Weren’t we supposed to stall for time and secure a position against the Demon Swordsman?”\nChun Jin-soo scolded Takeda for not playing the delaying game as originally planned. However, he had no choice.\n“He’s stronger than I imagined. If we’d gotten caught separately, we’d have been destroyed individually. In fact, we’ve already lost three teams.”\n“Three S-class Hunters…That’s a heavy loss.”\nTakeda nodded at Yong-wan’s words. Although Japan had thirty-eight S-class Hunters, its land mass was four times the size of South Korea.\nThe loss of an S-class Hunter would be devastating. No wonder they had to rally their forces so quickly.\n“Anyway, with five here and four in Korea, we have nine S-class Hunters left. That should be enough for us.”\n“Why don’t you count me?”\n“You’re an S-class.”\n“C’mon…you’re behind.”\nThe S-class Hunters are not the only ones in the room. There were over a hundred A-class Hunters moving in teams. Even if it was the demon sword, it would be foolish to charge here──\n“……!”\n“……?!”\nLee Yong-wan was started, the hairs on his body stood on end, a chill ran up his spine, and his heart pounded.\nYong-wan had experienced something similar twice before.\nThe first time was when he encountered Georgic’s punishment, and the second time was when the Demon Archduke Rakshar appeared…….\n“No way…….”\nHa Yuri, Golden Chul, Hwang Yeon-ha, Kang Jin-sung, Chun Jin-soo… and the rest of the Japanese powerhouses were stopped in succession.\nEven the S-class Hunters, trembled as they felt an invisible presence.\n“Ma…….”\nA presence from across the street was staring at the dozens of S-class Hunters and over a hundred A-class Hunters, it was the Demon Swordsman.\nYong-wan’s complexion turned pale as beyond his gaze, there was a demon clutching a sword.\nThe blood-soaked Demon Swordsman opened his heavy mouth at them.\n“Brutal slaughter…merciless destruction… …….”\nObtain.\nBlood, skulls… stand at the pinnacle of destruction.\n“I am the Carnage Archduke Akasha. I am the destruction of all life.”\n[Carnage Archduke dominates the space.]",

      "content": "Chapter 114: Akasha, the Archduke of Slaughter (1)\nGolden Chul felt a strong sense of discomfort at the sight of the demon swordsman before him.\n‘Is there… someone with this kind of presence?’\nJust by being there, he exuded a powerful presence.\nEven though he couldn’t be seen or heard, everyone instinctively realized his presence.\nHe had faced countless S-class monsters.\nThe Red Gate he had cleared so far, or the Yakt Spinner, Cheongju nightmare but even they were merely inorganic ‘enemies’, not worthy of such a dangerous intuition.\n‘Lionheart.’\nFor the first time in his life, he felt that the demon swordsman in front of him was untouchable──\n-Pow!\nAt that moment, the Japanese Hunters leaped forward in unison and at the same time, the Demon Swordsman was crushed by something. It was a torn Demon Tower Sealing Scroll.\n“It’s a 100 million yen item that crushes through space! When he can’t move, surround him!”\nAt Takeda’s command, a thick shield centered on the tanks blocks the escape route and aims their weapons. In a matter of moments, they had the Demon Swordsman surrounded.\nThe swords and spears of over a hundred Class A Hunters pointed at Demon Swordsman Chun Ji-so…no, Akasha, the Archduke of Slaughter.\n“I can’t believe that any demon swordsman could face this many Hunters.”\n“Don’t worry, no mage swordsman in history has been able to defeat so many hunters.”\nHe was the sixth-generation demon swordsman. In other words, the previous five Demon Swordsmen had been defeated.\n“Now, wait….”\nAt that moment, Yong-wan felt a very serious case of déjà vu. It was the same for Ha Yuri, and when he was about to say something──a creepy feeling came over them.\n“Dodge──!!”\nThirty super-fast stabs rained down in an instant and “thirty” hunters were pierced.\nMost of them were beyond the reach of the sword, but a scattering of crackling energy pierced through the Hunters as if space were no barrier.\nThe only ones who survived were the few who retreated backwards with all their might, acting on instinct.\n“Slash…!”\nTakeda calmly drew his sword at this moment but Akasha’s sword was faster than him.\n-Kwah!\nIn a moment that can only be described as a flash, the blade that blocked the magic sword broke into pieces while Takeda’s armor shattered and bounced back.\n“What?!”\nIt was a Legendary class armor, but the demon sword crushed Takeda’s sword along with it, trying to cut through his torso.\n“Damn it…!”\nThe Japanese S-class Hunter instantly threw himself down and stabbed Akasha but the attack was blocked by a sword.\n“Boom…!”\nTakeda managed to avoid being sliced in half, but he didn’t expect him to defend so perfectly. He tried to close the distance for now, but the slashing sword didn’t miss him.\n-Bam…!\nHe blocked but the blow bent his sword and Akasha added more power.\n-… Zip!\nThe sword splintered and the figure was cut in half from the crown of his head.\n“Hmph…!”\nGolden Chul swung his huge two-handed hammer and a devastating blow, capable of demolishing a building in a single blow, struck him in the buttocks but,\n‘He blocked it with his hands?!’\nAkasha caught Golden Iron’s hammer with his palm and even with his strength, he couldn’t break free of his grip on the hammer.\n“Hold it!”\nLooking for an opening, Yong-wan fired three enchanted arrows at Akasha but the demon swordsman swung his sword, however at that moment, something happened.\nSkill <Multiple Arrows>\nThe three arrows split into 30 arrows. This is not a fake or an alter ego. It’s an inescapable shot, multiplied tenfold.\n-Pabat!\nThe greatsword as tall as a man moved swiftly, a movement that even Yong Wan, an S-class Hunter and Archer with a good eye, couldn’t keep up with.\nThe next moment, a stab of lightning speed that cut down thirty Hunters is in front of him.\n-Boom!\nThe stab was blocked by a sword that reflected a shaped light. Kang Jin-sung grabbed Yong-wan and blocked the blow, but he couldn’t stop the destructive power of the sword’s thrust and was knocked back.\n“Thank you, old man.”\n“……strong.”\nKang Jin-sung’s right arm, which had blocked the demon sword, trembled.\n“Strange…I fought a demon sword in Ulsan…but it wasn’t this strong.”\nDuring Chun Ji-so awakening as a demon swordsman, Kang Jin-sung had fought alongside Lee Yong-wan in the Ulsan tragedy.\n“He’s much faster than he was then… and he’s grown stronger.”\n“Grown?”\nWere demon swordsmen also growing beings? But even so, this was…….\n“Is Takeda-kun okay?”\nThe Japanese hunters answered Kang Jin-sung’s question.\n“His injuries are…severe. The healers are working on him, but he’s… strangely unable to recover!”\n“……Yong-wan-kun, what does the system window say?”\nKang Jin-sung, who was too busy watching out for the Demon Swordsman to pay attention to the system window, asked instead.\n“Slaughter…Declaration.”\n[Slaughter Declaration]\n[Effect:\n-Applies to all creatures.\n-Physical Resistance decreases by 90%.\n-All biological defenses are reduced by 90%.\n-Vitality is rapidly reduced.\n-Wounds do not heal.]\nIt was a terrible debuff that couldn’t be offset even with the best Commander-type Hunter in the world.\n‘That’s not all.’\nThere were also Slaughter Archduke Akasha’s aura, Despairing Presence, and countless other debuff auras.\nOne is legendary, but there are many. Even S-class Hunters, who normally carry buffs, can lose more than 50% of their power.\n‘The Slaughter Archduke…He’s on par with Rakshar!’\nHow could humanity possibly win against such monsters?\n“It doesn’t matter, we’ll just have to kill them.”\nIt was then that Chun Jin-soo stepped forward, with his greatsword slung over his shoulder.\n“Seeing as how you’re so strong, you must be doing well.”\nChun Jin-soo spoke to the Demon Archduke in a low tone but Akasha twisted the corners of her mouth.\n“The host’s…flesh and blood, I see.”\n“I’ve never had a son like you.”\n“Hmph…old man. Where is your ‘granddaughter’?”\n“…….”\nBy granddaughter she meant Chun So-yeon.\nEven Chun Jin-soo could not help but pause at Akasha’s question about his granddaughter.\n“You will die by my hand today.”\nChun Jin-soo points his sword, and Kang Jin-sung steps forward as the swords of the two old swordsmen crossed.\nKorea’s strongest hunters rushed toward the demon swordsman.\n* * * * *\n[The demon swordsman is on the loose!]\nChun So-yeon, who had been dealing with the remaining monsters on the Wakayama coastline, heard the news through the public channel and immediately moved.\n“Uh, uh, Chun So-yeon, where are you going!”\nJae-hyuk called out in a muffled voice, but the dark-haired girl didn’t pay him any mind as she ran, heading for the Hanbit Palace, which was just preparing to take off from the helicopter dock.\n“Guild Leader Park Yong-shin!”\n“Miss Chun So-yeon?”\nPark Yong-shin had just boarded the ‘self-made helicopter’ that had been mobilized for this operation. The transport helicopter, which was quite large for civilian use, was filled with the elite hunters of the Hanbit Palace.\n“Please… take me with you.”\n“Hmph, where do you think I’m going?”\nKnowing everything… Park Yong-shin twisted his mouth in a sneer.\n“The demon sword. You want to obtain…merit… by defeating it, right?”\n“Hoo-hoo, of course.”\nPark Yong-shin and the believers behind him had the same determination… no, ‘faith’.\nEven though he was impressed by the TTG Guild, Leon treated Park Yong-shin and his group as something in between believers and heretics.\nSin is sin, even if it is unwitting idolatry so Leon ordered ten years of service for the Hanbit Palace Master and his men, and they willingly complied.\n“We all felt it, the light of salvation enveloping us as the seeds of evil disappeared.”\nOn the way to Shikoku Island with Chun So-yeon in tow, Park’s lips twitched into a smile of ecstasy.\n“The gods of the pantheon watch over us directly, and grant us favor. They have even set up their representatives on earth. What clearer salvation could there be?”\nChun So-yeon was silent. She had no choice but to believe in the existence of a god. Even if it was an “evil god,” it was still a god that was actually favoring her.\nBut they went further than that.\n“We must obtain merit. We have to beg for forgiveness. Oh, and of course, it’s not like we’re asking the gods, you can’t trade with the divine… we’ve learned that the hard way.”\nIn other words, they would risk martyrdom for an uncertain salvation. Perhaps their fanaticism hadn’t changed, just the object.\n“Well, there may never be a moment when we can come into play.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Because the two elders have already pointed their swords at it.”\n“…….”\nLight Swordsman Chun Jin-soo and Infinite Sword Kang Jin-sung were two of the three strongest hunters in Korea.\nEven the strongest demon swordsman might not be able to defeat them. In fact, during the Ulsan disaster, they repelled a demonic swordsman.\n-Boom!\n-Bang! Boom!\nA loud shockwave shook the helicopter as outside the helicopter’s window, thousands of swords covered the sky.\n“Infinite Sword <Demonic Sword>?!”\nIt was a storm that threatened to tear the world apart in the shape of a sword.\n“Mad Sword… <The Ten Million Blades>.”\nA unique skill that makes the two strongest swordsmen in Korea the strongest. The Infinite Sword, who manipulates countless deep swords and weaves them into the ultimate one, and the Berserker, who captures a storm in a single sword.\nThe deadly swords are all over Shikoku. But──\n[The Sword of Akasha the Slaughterer is summoned]\nA blood-colored sword is summoned from the sky. It was so enormous, it seemed like a force to be reckoned with.\n“Oh, gods…….”\nAs Park Yong-shin spoke, Akasha’s sword fell.\nIt was doom.\n[【Ventasis’ Magic Sword】 intervenes with darkness against Akasha’s sword]\n[【Arianna’s Holy Sword】 dispels the evil with light]\n* * * * *\nIt was a while later when Yong-wan finally recovered his vision from the pitch blackness.\n“Oh…….”\nAll he could remember was that Akasha and the Infinite Sword had brought out their strongest moves, and the aftermath swept through the surroundings.\n“Yuri-chan… Yuri-chan, are you okay?”\n“Off… Don’t shake.”\nEven S-class Hunters were caught up in the destructive clash but what about the two people at the center of it?\n“Ah…….”\nIn the center of their still blurry vision, there was a result.\n“Kuluk…!”\nKang Jin-sung spat out blood along with his broken sword, and Chun Jin-soo struggled while being held by the nape of his neck.\nThe two strongest hunters in Korea had been defeated.\nThe Wandering Demon Sword… Chun Ji-ho… No, the Archduke of Slaughter Akasha let out a voice that sounded like an insect gnawing at her.\n“That was a good one. But you’re weak.”\nThe Demon Archduke’s overwhelming debuffs and their aging body was a fatal combination.\nThe Demon Archduke’s debuff, a deafening sound that drives people insane with its mere presence, is something no human can withstand. Yong-wan had learned this from the Rakshar he had witnessed at the East Sea Gate.\n‘Damn… if only he were here!’\nYong-wan resented that the only person who could stand against it wasn’t here now.\n“But it’s strange. It’s less powerful than I thought. Something intervened.”\nThat’s when a familiar ‘light’ burst through the dense dust.\n“Your Majesty Leon?!”\nNo, in the swordsman’s hand was another sword opposite of the glowing one, ominously dark.\n“Let go of him!”\n“So-yeon?!”\nThe light from the holy sword and the magic sword sliced through the arm holding Chun Jin-soo. It was a perfect ambush.\n“Hmm?”\nAkasha’s movements were somewhat sluggish but it wasn’t just Chun So-yeon who attacked him.\n“For Lionheart!”\n“”For Lionheart…!””\nThe Hunters of Hanbit Palace attacked in unison. The sword of S-class Hunter Park Yong-shin and the weapons of the Hunters struck Akasha but at that moment, Akasha parried all of them with her demon sword.\n“Oh no!”\nShe counterattacked in a split second, decapitating two Hunters.\n“Damn…!”\nPark Yong-shin narrowly avoided the sword that was also swung at him. Realizing that their ambush had failed, the Hunters of Hanbit Palace immediately formed a formation.\n“We’re down two, my lord.”\n“To counterattack at such short notice…What a monster.”\nStill, the rescue of their targets, Chun Jin-soo and Kang Jin-sung, had been successful.\nPark Yong-shin looked around.\n“Why are you all so slack-jawed, why aren’t you resisting that evil creature?”\n“It’s…easy to say…….”\nGolden Chul said with difficulty. His resistance had already been drastically reduced by debuffs, and now he was hit by Akasha’s sword.\nEven if it was just a shockwave, it was a shockwave from such a huge sword. The entire island was cratered as if it had been hit by a nuclear bomb.\n“Ugh…….”\nHuang Yeon-ha dragged her shattered body to her feet and leaned against her brother’s side, her weak voice crying out in frustration.\n“You guys…why can you move so well…….You’re taking… debuffs.”\nThe fact that she came so quickly suggests that she was near the moment of impact with Akasha’s sword. A mere swipe would have killed most Hunters instantly, so how could they be so unharmed?\n“Hmm… I don’t know? Perhaps it’s because of our faith in the gods?”\n[Cultists] partially resist malignant curses]\nThey are rare talents to be able to believe in something so completely, and to be willing to lay down your life for it.\nOthers may call them crazy, but to them, it’s a testament to their faithfulness. And…….\n“Chun So-yeon──”\nAkasha…who controlled the shell of Chun Ji-so, So-yeon’s father, glared at her with an emotionless gaze.\n“Divine──power.”\nVentasis, the god of darkness and vengeance, and Arianna, the goddess of light and justice.\nChun So-yeon holds a magic sword and a holy sword blessed by those two gods.\n“There is no such thing as losing. I only take the body I should have taken four years ago.”\n“…….”\nChun So-yeon glared at Akasha wordlessly. At this moment, her power was being amplified to a ridiculous degree.\n[The avenger has encountered her foe. She mortgages her soul to amplify her power]\n-Soul consumption rate: 12%.\nThe power of vengeance consumes Chun So-yeon’s soul, amplifying her power to realize her vengeance. It’s like mortgaging her future.\n“I can do it. With this power…!\nChun So-yeon marveled at the omnipotence of the Holy Law that she could feel throughout her body but then, a sword slashed down.\n-Boom!\n“What?!”\nIf it weren’t for her amplified strength, she wouldn’t even be able to react but the cost of blocking such a huge force with his bare body was devastating.\n-Crack!\nTendons all over her body burst as a ghastly sound coursed through her body, and it was only with the darkness of Ventasis supporting her and the light of Arianna resisting the force of evil that she was able to stand.\n“The power of the gods is–mighty. Countless of my people have been annihilated by their power.”\nAkasha looked down at Chun So-yeon and twisted her lips at the catastrophe, the annihilation of tens of millions of demons that only demons could know.\n“A power that could shatter our immortality. But──”\nThe demon sword weighing down on Chun So-yeon became even heavier. The Demon Archduke’s gaze pierces through her, mocking.\n“You are not one of those knights.”\nYou are nothing.\n“Miss So-Yeon!”\nPark Yong-shin and the Hunters rushed to her aid.\nThe Hanbit Palace was willing to risk martyrdom for a mere girl empowered by the gods.\n[Blood Wave]\nAt that moment, a dense blood wave spread out from the center of the demon sword in the form of a ring.\n-Kaaaah!\nHunters everywhere were swept away by the wave. With just a single wave passing through them, they were sprawled on the ground, feeling the pain of having their entire bodies shattered.\n“I am the power of destruction.”\nAkasha was about to spill insults as she displayed her overwhelming power.\n“Hhhhhhhh…!”\nBut the first person to do it was someone completely unexpected.\n“…….”\nAkasha’s gaze snapped to the direction of the unconscious Hunters.\n“What’s -so- funny, mortal.”\nYong-wan chuckled and fixed his broken glasses.\n“No, it’s just… it’s kind of ridiculous.”\nEveryone looks at him like he’s crazy. Smiling in this situation seemed like giving up on everything.\nBut Yong-wan wasn’t being silly because he had given up everything.\n-Kaaaaaaaah!\nLight pours in as a dazzling golden light spreads from the sky, threatening to envelop the island.\n“What is immortality…….?”\nThe overwhelming light hit him in the back.\n“In front of him… aren’t we all mortals anyway?”\nA surge of simmering anger creeps up on him.\n“Well, honestly, I’m irreligious… but this makes me want to believe in gods. Even demigods…are gods, right?”\nAkasha’s gaze slowly moves toward the source of the light.\nA golden hair color and blue eyes.\nA living demigod and the greatest Holy Knight.\nTerror of the Evil Ones and their greatest slayer.\n“──Lionheart.”\nThe Lionhearted King.\nThe doom of all evil.",

      "content": "Chapter 115: Akasha, the Archduke of Slaughter (2)\n“Takeda… was… defeated?”\nChairman Kamiya couldn’t hide a rare look of bewilderment.\nEven when three S-class Hunters were defeated, he hadn’t felt this panicked.\nRather, he thought Takeda was wise when he rallied all the Hunters on Shikoku Island and hardened their defenses like hedgehogs.\nWith Korean hunters and other Japanese hunters around him, he saw no difficulty in repelling the demon sword with their support.\nBut then the Korean Hunters joined in, and the Demon Sword appeared before the coalition of nine S-classes.\n[I am the Archduke of Slaughter, Akasha, the destruction of all life].\nA terrible voice came through the receiver, followed by the screams of battle.\n‘How many have we lost, and is Takeda among them?’\nThis was not the plan.\nObviously, the demon sword should not be capable of this kind of combat.\nIt would be possible to defeat it with 4-5 fully prepared S-class Hunters in hand-to-hand combat……….\n‘So, the Demon Sword…was a Demon Archduke, not just a being that corrupts Demon Swordsmen?’\nWhy now…Chairman Kamiya’s fingertips trembled.\n“Mr. President…The Light Sword and the Infinite Sword are currently battling against the Demon Sword…….Shall we…send support?”\nAt least four S-class Hunters from Japan alone were dead and South Korea hunters were seriously injured.\nOf course, there are still Hunters left in Japan. There were nine more S-class Hunters on this battlefield alone, and twenty if you count the branches defending the entire country.\nIf we think about the long game and rally them all together, we can…….\n“No, no…first…stop.”\n“President?”\n“We watch the situation. If… just in case, if we can end it by giving up one city…….”\nSo far, the pattern of the Demon Sword had been that once a city was wiped out, it would disappear somewhere. It had happened in Vietnam, too.\n“Mr. President, there are 3.7 million citizens on Shikoku Island alone, do you intend to abandon them?”\n“You idiot!”\nChairman Kamiya snapped at his employee. The normally calm man was losing his cool now.\n“One S-class Hunter is worth a million normal people! Don’t you even know that!?”\nThat’s not something the man in charge of Japan’s hunters should have said.\nEven though the All Japan Association was privatized and became a private company, its reason for existence is to protect the safety of Japan.\nThe head of the All Japan Association was discussing the value of hunters and the general public, saying that they might abandon their citizens.\n‘We can’t lose any more S-class Hunters to such a ridiculous monster!’\nHow many Hunters would die and their power base would be shaken if they just pushed them in there?\nI feel sorry for the remaining Japanese Hunters over there, but if we can end it with that kind of sacrifice…….\n“President, the Berserker and the Infinite Sword…!”\nIn the image transmitted by the relay helicopter, countless swords and storm-focused swords are wielded in the sky.\nYes, if only they could end it here. It pains me to give credit to the Korean hunters, but this will end with the government paying a heavy price.\nBut──\n“An unidentified sword…appeared in the sky…….”\n“Diameter…over three kilometers.”\nAs the sword fell, and the damage was beyond counting, Chairman Kamiya had only one thought.\nI was right.\n‘I was right not to send in the Hunters from other areas.’\nIt would have been terrible if one more of them had landed on that island of death and gotten caught.\nIf that thing fell twice…….\nJapan loses the ability to resist the gate going forward.\n‘I’d rather give up the assault at this point and surrender the island…….’\nWouldn’t the Demon Sword be satisfied with having consumed a city and leave, as it had done before?\nChairman Kamiya was about to order the Japanese Hunters of Wakayama and Miyazaki to stop entering Shikoku.\n“Shi, there is an anomaly on the island of Shikoku! It’s a light! An unidentifiable golden color has risen into the sky!”\nThat’s when it happened. The image on the screen… no, a giant pillar of light that could be seen from Osaka, where the control center was located, and perhaps witnessed by all Japanese in the Kansai region, was rising into the sky.\n“What is that?”\nA golden haze-a light mist-descended upon the island, as if a manifested miracle of God had touched the heavens and bestowed grace and at its center, a man stood.\n“The Lionheart King…!\nHis heart trembles at the majesty of what I see on the screen and Chairman Kamiya suddenly realized that he had found hope.\nThen.\nThe nightmare moved first.\n* * * *\nOnce upon a time, there was a world.\nThere were kingdoms protected by gods, and knights favored by those gods.\nTo the demons, immortal beings, they were a nuisance.\nKnights of the gods, who practiced holy law, bent the laws, and hated evil with a terrible hatred so demons sought to destroy them.\nThey used the Empire to weaken the kingdom, spreading their power secretly and taking steps toward summoning.\nThus, with the Emperor’s sacrifice of three million lives, Malus, Lord of Chaos, was summoned.\nThe Great War began as Four of the Seven Lords were summoned, along with six Archdukes and eighty-seven Archdemons that led legions numbering ten million to invade the World of Gods.\nThe result was successful as most of the world lay in ruins, and only two forces remained.\nA legion of knights, preparing for a final stand, and an army of orcs, who treated the Great War like a festival and ravaged the East.\nIn the end, both armies fell to the demons.\nAkasha, the Demon Archduke of Slaughter, was caught in the middle and never saw the end of it, but it wasn’t long before she realized…… It was her good fortune.\n“Lionheart.”\nAkasha understood the source of Yong-wan’s hope.\nThe Lionheart King, Guardian of the Grail, deserved to be the hope of the world.\n“Swosh──”\nAkasha’s sword slashed down towards Leon.\n-Bam!\nThe blood red sword and the golden holy sword collided as Leon lightly withstood the demonic blast that no one had ever received before.\n“Lionheart─!”\n“How dare you call my name with your filthy tongue!”\nIt was then that Leon’s holy sword parried the Archduke’s magic sword, and in that split second, Leon’s fist flew out.\n-Bam!\nThe moment it collided with his face, it sent his body tumbling to the ground.\nAkasha hit the ground as if a batter had hit a flying baseball with a full force blow and an intense vibration rang out as if an earthquake had hit the ground.\n“…….”\nAll the Hunters watching were stunned.\nThe Demon Archduke that they couldn’t even block, let alone touch, had simply been thrown away.\n“K-kick─! K-k-kick!”\nBut the Archduke nonchalantly stood up and stretched out the arm that had been severed by Chen So-yeon.\nThe regeneration was instantaneous as if mortal struggles were meaningless.\nThe Archduke of Slaughter walked toward Leon and the Lionheart King also approached Akasha, his holy sword drawn.\nThe sight of them approaching each other, unprepared and defenseless, was enough to make the onlookers nervous.\n-Gulp!\nEven the sound of swallowing sounds like noise. As their gazes lock, a message pops up in their system window.\n[Declaration of Slaughter]\n[Effect:\n-Applies to all creatures.\n-Physical Resistance is reduced by 90%.\n-All biological defenses are reduced by 90%.\n-Vitality is rapidly reduced.\n-Wounds do not heal.]\nDemon Archduke had a terrible debuff but Leon used his own buffs.\n[[Grail Guardian] resists the curse]\n◆Effects: Vitality, Order, Fear Immunity, Confusion Immunity, Wound Regeneration, Valor, Perfect Body, Pollution Resistance, Great Soul────\n“Huh…!”\nAn audible grunt escapes Akasha.\nThe hunters thought he couldn’t resist the Demon Archduke’s debuffs no matter what buffs he brought, but this was such a powerful buff?\nBuffs that only those who belong to the TTG Guild would know about and that are granted by the mere presence of the Lionheart King.\n[[Demonic Terror] weakens Akasha the Archduke of Slaughter]\n◆Effect: Force Fear, Eerie, Decreased Resistance──\nThe Lionheart King’s gaze would suffocate an ordinary demon.\n[【One-man army】 resists this]\n[【Supreme Demon Butcher】────]\n[【Duelist】────]\n[【Demon Lord Slayer】────]\n[【Demon Archduke Akasha】────]\nLegendary buffs cancel each other out and collide in a battle that even the world’s best Commander-series hunters can’t reach.\nOrdinary humans, demons…No, the heavens above the heavens, unreachable by all living things.\nFor the narrative of the heavens and the earth was upon them.\n“I am the ruin of all life!”\n“I am your doom!”\n* * * * *\nWhen the island of Shikoku was designated as a potential landing site for the monsters, the citizens of the island were forced to evacuate.\nBut Shikoku alone has 3.7 million residents. The Onaruto Bridge, which connects the island to the mainland and is larger than South Korea’s Gyeongsangbuk-do Province, was jammed with evacuees.\n“Mr. Police Officer, when will the car in front of us be cleared?”\n“We are currently guiding it. Please be patient.”\nThe evacuee man realized that there was a battle going on inside the island, and he wondered if he was going to get caught up in it and die.\nAt first, he refused to evacuate, thinking that with so many Japanese and Korean hunters, the city’s defenses could not be breached.\nIt was the aftermath of the battle on the island’s interior that caused many citizens to rush to evacuate.\nA giant greatsword had been summoned to meet the deadly skills of Korean S-class hunters. It was still stuck in the center of the island, making a terrifying presence.\n“Damn, why isn’t there anything on the news?”\nShouldn’t the battle already be over? There are at least ten S-class Hunters here in Shikoku alone.\nThere was also Takeda, the proud S-class hunter of Japan, and over a hundred A-class hunters.\nEven if a black gate appeared in Japan right now, they would be able to clear it.\n“This will never end, I’d rather go on foot──!”\nThe man opened the car door.\n-Quang!\n-Thwack!\n“──?!!!”\n“Crack…!”\nThe man crashed into the door of his car but he couldn’t care less about the pain in his back, because right in front of him, the ocean rose high, forming a huge tidal wave.\n“Tsu, tsunami?”\n<Waves>\nA giant tidal wave poured out to crush something but at that moment, a blood-colored wave cut through it and slashed the sky.\n“Aaah!”\nThe aftermath alone scrambled the people on the Onaruto Bridge. Car doors were ripped off by the blade winds, and the steel structure shook.\n-Aah!\nThe cheek of the policeman in front of the man was cut by the wind.\n“…….”\nBut the policeman didn’t even care that his cheek was cut. He just stared blankly at the ‘things’ battling on the sea beyond.\n“What, people?”\nThey’re fighting fiercely.\nTwo objects fighting on a sea that looks like it’s going to drown them if they take a single step.\n-Kaaaaaaaah!!!\nA wave of blood erupts, and a giant flame evaporates the seawater and engulfs something.\nThe citizens can only watch with bated breath.\nSince the Cataclysm, the Hunters, as the superhumans are called, have been fighting a war of attrition, an old-fashioned white-knuckle battle between cold warriors.\nOccasionally, a powerful skill can cause great destruction, but it’s a skill reserved for the best of the best.\nCitizens are accustomed to seeing the flashy skills of S-class Hunters and the destructive power of mages in the news and on the internet.\nBut what is that?\nWhat does that even mean?\nLight Sword Strike, a unique skill that can be said to be a Hunter’s deadly skill.\nThe air screams as if a giant bomb has been detonated, and the churning sea creates a tidal wave.\nIf they weren’t on a bridge hundreds of meters above sea level, they’d be swallowed up by that tidal wave, and if they weren’t hiding in a car that weighs tons, they’d be blown away.\nThat’s not the kind of power a living thing is capable of. It defies common sense and violates the laws of physics.\n“What was that…….?”\nThe officer half-leaned against the car, shivering and plugging his eardrums. He didn’t know that his cheek, which had just been cut, had suddenly healed.\n-Poof!\nIt was then that the swordsman with the ominous blood-colored magic sword crushed the knight with the golden holy sword in a frenzied wave of blood.\nThe surface of the sea pushes out and plunges to the bottom. Soon, as if filling a gaping hole, the water closed in between them.\n[Die-er, la!]\nThe gnawing, insect-like voice echoed in their minds, as if proclaimed to every living thing in the area.\nEveryone noticed that the <Akasha’s Sword> was falling from the sky, scattering a terrifying aura.\n“Do, run…….”\nIt’s a pointless struggle. Now come on, you fugitives, do you think you can escape from that sword of destruction?\nAll the man could do was pick up his cell phone right now and say a final goodbye to his loved ones.\nBut──\nThe agent of the gods does not tolerate despair.\n-Kaaaaaah!!!\nA golden light shone brightly from the bottom of the sea. The density of the light overflowed at every moment and ‘pushed out the sea’.\nMillions of tons of water pressure are pushed out by the density of light as nature succumbs to a force that ‘bends the laws’.\nThe Lionheart King emerges from the bottom of the cracked sea and the extreme light of the holy sword is revealed in all its glory.",

      "content": "Chapter 116: Akasha, the Archduke of Slaughter (3)\nWhen a Knight completes a quest and becomes a Holy Grail Knight, chosen by the gods, they are given three holy items.\nThe first is armor.\nWhether lightly or heavily armored, the knight is given the strongest armor available, forged from stellar iron, to protect his body.\nThe second is the lance.\nThe knight is the one who breaks the enemy’s spear in the vanguard.\nAt the moment of breakthrough, the destructive power of the lance breaks through the tidal wave that is the enemy.\nThird is the Holy Sword.\nA metal of the gods, compressed from the energy of the stars. A holy sword forged by the best smiths of the blacksmith god Heto.\nIt is not just any blade.\nIt is the ultimate holy weapon, designed to embody the power of the god the Holy Knight serves.\nThus, the Holy Knight’s holy sword symbolizes the power of the gods.\nSo what is the Grail Keeper’s sword?\nKingdom knights are given an indestructible sword.\nWith unbreakable faith, they cut down the enemies of the realm.\nHoly Knights are blessed with the Blade of Fury, a symbol that reflects the brilliance of the gods.\nSo what kind of sword does the Grail Keeper receive?\nThose who are implanted with the Lionheart and become demigods, guarding the Grail, the holy relic of all the gods.\nThey cut down the enemies of the realm and ensure that the glory of the gods flourishes.\nBut\nLionheart Kings do not symbolize the power of the gods, they represent the will of the gods.\nThe Lionheart King’s holy sword is forged by the hammering of Heto, sharpened by the flames of Petos, and engraved with the light of Arianna.\nIn addition, countless gods put their blessings into the sword, and the divinity of countless gods is contained in it.\nThus the holy sword is a polarizing light. It is the power wielded on behalf of the gods, as their representative.\nThe will of the living demigod is the will of the gods.\nThe Lionhearted King is the will of all gods.\n“Light.”\nCome. I am the hope.\nI am righteousness.\n“Flame.”\nBurn my enemies.\nThe flames of battle that the War Horseman will raise.\n“Sea.”\nSwallow up their footsteps.\nThe waves are always on my side, and the winds cannot harm me.\nThe mists of death unfurl and lead to eternal dreams.\nLife grows in the salty earth, sheltering only one person.\nThe sky turns yellow and the thunder rumbles.\nThe sun shines with intense positivity, proclaiming one man to be the judge of the world.\nDarkness falls, designating an avenging foe for the destruction of the world.\nThat’s not all.\nMore. More. More. More.\nThe gods protect him.\nNo end of favor and blessing for the representative of the gods.\nThe holy sword of extreme light blazed with a brilliant light that seemed to represent the power of all the gods.\n“──Monster.”\nAkasha grew tired of seeing Leon wielding such immense malevolent power, yet layered with divinity.\nHe had heard of several Lionheart Kings through rumors.\nHe knew that they were the strongest of the Grail Knights, and that they were far above the level of saints.\nBut in the end, they are human. Even if they were half-divine, they were still half-human.\nEven their vessels had their limits. Even if they represented the power of a god, they could only take so many gods and so much power.\nBut what was this guy?\nHow many gods had he taken in?\nAkasha did not know how a mere mortal held all the gods within his heart.\nHe was the strongest Grail Guardian of all time and the greatest Lionheart king of all time.\nThe gods may not approve, but he claims to speak for all the gods because he is a man who can.\n“It’s dangerous, that catastrophe could be reenacted.”\nIn that war, the demons lost most of their leaders, especially the Lords of Chaos, Pleasure and Wisdom, and suffered a devastating blow.\nThree of their four lords that participated in the war died at the hands of Leon.\nEven the Demon Archduke of Slaughter himself has been killed by a damned orc.\nThis must be done now.\nShe realized instinctively that if Leon continues to survive and add to the source of its power, the Faith, he will become even more terrifying.\n“Die, with your past glory behind you!”\n“My glory is eternally immortal!”\nA falling sword of destruction and slaughter was countered by a holy sword that represents the blessings and power of all the gods.\nA beam of light rushes forward toward the falling blade but at the moment of collision, it is the demon sword that is crushed.\n“──!!!”\nThe form of the demon sword crumbles and burns as the scream of a lifeless thing echoes through the world as it burns.\n“Monstrous bastard…….”\nEven the Archduke of Slaughter couldn’t stop the words from flowing out of his mouth.\nSlashing through space, shattering swords, and slashing the sky, the holy sword sails into the far reaches of the universe, toward the stars.\n* * * * *\nEverything he touches disappears.\nAfter devouring Akasha’s sword, he is not satisfied and transforms the atmosphere above Shikoku Island.\nThe entire world is bathed in the power of the gods, and otherworldliness spreads to areas that have never been touched by their grace.\nIn this space, the presence of evil gnaws at its existence just by being there. This is why holy swords, especially Leon’s, are so terrifying.\n“…….”\nEven after such a miracle, Leon didn’t look satisfied and he had every right to be.\nHe had just struck with the intention of extinguishing the Demon Archduke’s soul.\n“K-k-k-k-”\nAt the bottom of the evaporated sea the fallen Demon Archduke Akasha was breathing heavily, or more accurately, the body of her host, Chun Ji-so.\n“You’re as tough as a cockroach.”\nLeon shot him a scornful glance.\n“Kkkkkk-weak. No, you’ve lost all your strength.”\nAkasha knows of Leon’s power at his peak as she had witnessed how the Lord of Wisdom died.\nThe Great Lionheart King, who drew upon the power of the stars and broke the Transcendent Spell that threatened to annihilate the continent.\nThe power that defeated the three lords was severely lacking compared to then.\n“Faith is lacking.”\nEven if one receives the laws and blessings of all the gods, one’s power is ultimately a substitute for the sum total of one’s faith.\nThis world was still far too lacking in worship of the gods, and as a result──\n-Thud!\nA wound appeared on Leon’s body. It was the first wound he had received since his arrival in this world.\nA wound on the flesh of the Grail Guardian, whose body was harder than armor?\n“You are a worthy leader among cockroaches.”\nIt wasn’t even a direct hit from Akasha’s sword, but a shockwave of disintegration. If only Leon’s armor had been there, this wouldn’t have happened.\n‘But it cannot be helped.’\nLeon had been fighting for over two hundred years.\nHe had defeated the Lord of Pleasure in the Great War against the Demon Legion at the age of 121, and single-handedly defeated dozens of Archdemons, several Demon Archdukes, and endless armies of evil stretching to the horizon.\nLeon fought where there were no believers to offer his ‘faith’ to.\nConsuming the relics left behind by the Holy Knights.\nUsing the countless holy swords, spears, and armor that had been blessed with their power, he used even his own armor as a source of energy during his final battle when he was 266 years old but even that wasn’t enough, and his holy sword was eventually destroyed.\n“However, you are mistaken, evil creature.”\n“──?”\n“Certainly, I am weaker now than I was when I was hunting you filthy fiends. But…….”\nHe pointed his sword and the holy sword still glowed with the power of the gods.\n“Even if I’m weakened, you’re not stronger than me.”\nThe Lionheart King stomped on the ground as his holy sword struck down with the same speed as he had charged.\n-Boom!\n“K─!”\nAkasha barely manages to block it, but the shockwave spreads out and creates a crater.\nAkasha, who could barely withstand it with her wounded body, kicked Leon in the stomach and retreated backwards.\n<Red Wave>\nAs he retreats, a red wave swoops down on Leon and the holy sword strikes.\nIt was a movement that violated the laws of physics as energy cuts through and the wave that shattered like glass grazed Leon’s cheek, but that was all.\nAkasha fell back even further. Running on the ground beneath the surface of the ocean, to buy time.\n“Stallion…!”\nStallion is summoned towards the fleeing man as Akasha fired her sword at the Divine Beast of Light that was running in a straight line towards her, but──\n-Quack!\nIt didn’t work at all.\nFueled by Leon’s holy power, Stallion was invulnerable to a frontal assault.\nEven if Akasha had any magic left in her, she wouldn’t be able to stop it, regardless of the quality or quantity.\n“Yes, you’re stronger!”\nAdmitting that outright, Akasha took the opportunity to restore her power but……a flurry of light from the sky\nThe otherworldly coloration created by the extreme light of the holy sword as it slashed through the sky hindered her recovery.\nWith the miracles of the gods overlapping, this space was like a sanctuary.\n“Ignorant bastard! How dare you waste so much power?”\nAkasha blood-colored waves overlap one after another and turn into a sphere with a terrifying amount of magic power, a bomb that is sure to engulf the knight in front of her.\n“Lionheart…!”\nThe Lionheart King, holding the holy spear, is unperturbed.\n“Glory be…!”\nHe made a straight frontal charge with no room to maneuver.\nThere’s an explosion, and a massive wave of tyranny crashes into Leon.\n‘Stupid…!’\nTo meet tyranny head-on with no armor is staggering in its ignorance.\nDivine Punishment <Battlefield Flame>\n“K──!?”\nThe rider breaks through the flames. No, not breaking through. The flames that should have burned Leon to a crisp through are whirling as if entangled in his spear.\n‘The power of flame…!’\nLeon remembers how the Holy Knight of the Flame walked through the fires of the Archduke Inferno in the Great War.\nNo fire can hurt a Holy Knight with the power of flame. In fact, it only adds to their power, as they control every flame on the battlefield…!\n“Die, you bastard!”\nA concentrated blast of flame shoots toward Akasha. For a person that hates ranged weapons, he is irrational enough to prefer a javelin thrown with full force.\nBut irrationality aside, the effect it produced was phenomenal.\nThe sea was split as a destructive force pushed all the water within a three-kilometer radius around Leon away from the swarm of light.\nThe hole in the ocean was stretching all the way to the South Sea of Japan but that was not all.\nThe sea through which the spear passed would instantly boil over, raising the water temperature to horrific levels and turning countless lives into boiled meat.\nThe carnage would be so great that it would be impossible to tell who was the murderous demon.\n‘It cannot be defeated. Not alone!’\nLeon was about to charge without hesitation when he felt something flying at him and deployed his Holy Art.\nHoly Art <Barrier of Arrows>\nIt was a one-time-only defensive art that blocks any ranged attack. It ‘nullified’ the trident that was thrown at Leon’s head.\n“Hmph?”\nLeon’s gaze traveled beyond the sea wall where a group of people were falling out of the sea wall like a pregnant woman giving birth to a fetus.\n“Monsters.”\nAkasha artificially triggered the dungeon break and unleashed the monsters. She thought she’d used them up in the landing, but the numbers were still staggering.\n“Do you think you can stop this king with these lesser beasts?”\n“I can’t but I can buy time.”\nAkasha gritted her teeth, though she didn’t seem to mind.\nSince the events of London, Akasha had amassed her power through much killing and destruction.\nShe sought out the best host to replace her lost body, and while not quite as good as that bitch, Chun Ji-so was a pretty good host.\n‘I’ve gathered a lot of power. Now all that remains is to completely demonize the host.’\nA monstrous creature ‘hunted’ her body with the power of the ‘Shaman God’ under the protection of the ‘Tusin’.\nEven if it wasn’t the best body, she was on the verge of completely demonizing Chun Ji-so, but──\n“You’re the reason I have to consume this much magic power!”\nThe demon sword that had swallowed so much blood and caused so much destruction was itself a huge mass of magic power.\nIt created a ‘gate’ with it.\n-Ohhhhhhh…!\nThe sword’s power scatters, causing the arcane energy to fluctuate.\nTo escape his pursuit, this must be no ordinary gate but perfect space, an absolute safe house.\nAn ‘estate’ that is unaffected by the system and can be closed by itself.\n“You…!”\nLeon’s complexion fills with anger. He doesn’t care about winning the battle, all he cares about is the destruction of evil.\nHaving lost the final battle and slaughtered each and every demon that fled in every direction, the fleeing demons are a terrible stress for him.\n“Stop him! I need time!”\nDozens of Field Bosses, hundreds, even thousands of monsters rush towards Leon at that very moment──\n-Critical targeting. Annihilation weapon activated.\nPlasma beams fall from space.\nIt was a charged particle cannon shot at Akasha and the Field Bosses, piercing their skulls.\n“──!!!”\nAkasha blocked the attack, but turned around and her gaze stared off into space.\n“You-!”\nHis gaze crosses with the Mechanical Holy Knight, albeit through the camera eye but he’s not the only one.\n-Crack…!\nDozens of lightning bolts fall from the black clouds that Leon activated with the Sky and Thunder Holy Art.\n“I have to conserve my magic just in case.”\nAbove the sea, atop a cliff-like formation, the silver-haired Magician Queen smiles bewitchingly from a horse.\n“Leave the supporting fire to me, Ms. Ha-ri.”\nBehind her were dozens of horses and hundreds of soldiers.\nThey walked on the sea, a miracle wrought by the goddess of the sea and waves.\n“Are you sure we can just walk from here?”\nStanding on a cliff in the middle of the sea, Ha-ri looked anxiously down at the blackness below as Jae-hyuk asked.\n“Ugh! Senior Ha-ri, you lack faith!”\nJae-hyuk chuckled and stretched out his hand.\n“Lord Ultima will protect us!”\nJae-hyuk takes the reins and plunges off the cliff as pure white clouds gather in his path.\n“Hahahaha, I’m going to ride these clouds and land like Geun Doo-woon, that’s what I’m saying──!”\n-Swoosh!\nBut Jae-hyuk’s wish was not fulfilled because the moment he landed on the gathered clouds, he crashed through them.\n“Oh, I see, you’re not quite up to speed yet.”\nBeatrice extends a beautiful finger in regret and at that moment, gravity reverses in the area.\n“Oh, oh, oh…….”\nJae-hyuk flies through space in a sort of weightlessness, landing with a splash. He is followed by dozens of Knight Cadets and Man-At-Arms.\n“…….”\nAkasha couldn’t hide her frustration seeing this scene.\nIt was only four months ago that the world had announced the existence of the Lionheart King, and yet he had already assembled such a large army along with two Holy Knights: that hunk of scrap metal and that silver-haired magician.\nThere are still only a handful of Kingdom Knights, but they’re a threat even to himself.\n“Soldiers of the Kingdom…!”\nLeon shouted, the army of the Lionheart King gathering behind him.\n“Raze the enemy…!”\n“”I will fulfill your orders!!!”\nWith the Lionheart King’s shout, the Hunters of the TTG Guild charge toward Akasha without hesitation.\nEven the terrible debuffs that Akasha’s mere presence inflicts are nothing to those in the Lionheart King’s Legion.\n-Quack!\n-Quack!\n-Crackle…!\nLightning crashes and flames rage as light protects them…along with the vengeful power of darkness.\nIt was overwhelming.\nA part of the Field Bosses had been sniped beforehand or hadn’t been able to block the initial bolt of lightning. But…….\n-Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee…!\n“The gate is open!!!”\nAkasha managed to hold on long enough to escape.\nLeaning into the black rift, the Archduke of Slaughter proclaimed.\n“I will not forget, and I will return, even if it takes a thousand years!”\nThat period was not a long time for an immortal being and since this was not the only place to slaughter, there will be plenty of time to regain strength elsewhere.\n“Where… are you running!!!”\nJust then, Leon threw something in the distance. It was a holy spear, retrieved from the subspace.\n-Kwak!\nIt cut off Akasha’s arm as she tried to cross over the gate but that was all.\nAkasha frowned, but didn’t stop running, and soon the gate was closed and the rift disappeared.\n“”…………….””\nThey stared at the vanished rift.\n………\n……\n…\nThe battle was overwhelming.\nLeon, Beatrice, and Yappy could not be stopped by a bunch of monsters that had lost their leader.\n“I see what we feared has happened.”\nBeatrice came to Leon’s side as he stared at the disappearing rift.\n“Yes. It was a waste.”\n…They missed the Demon Archduke. Still, Leon didn’t feel too bad.\n“Your Majesty, have you secured insurance just in case?”\nBeatrice asked and Leon twisted the corners of his mouth as a fierce smile that would have horrified the demons if they had seen it appeared.\n“Here it is.”\nLeon held up Akasha’s severed arm.\n“Can you summon the gate with this?”\n“Of course.”\nBeatrice smiles, her bewitching smile somehow exuding a similar aura to Leon’s.\n“They’ll see that there is no safe place for them anymore.”\n“Exactly. No place is safe for them anymore.”\n“Hoohoohoohoohoo…!”\n“Kkkkkkkkkk…!”\nThe laughter of the two kings, twisted with hatred, echoed eerily beneath the surface of Shikoku Island.",

      "content": "Chapter 117: It’s Not Over Yet\n“Huh…!”\nTakeda opened his eyes and stared at the white ceiling.\n‘Hospital?’\nHe must have been attacked by the demon swordsman and suffered irreparable injuries.\nThe ringer in his arm was annoying so Takeda pulled the ringer needle out and pushed his eerily still body to his feet.\n‘Did Michiru do this?’\nMichiru is a Japanese S-class healer. She’d been with him on Shikoku, preparing for the attack.\n‘No, it’s weird. I don’t think it’s possible to heal to the point where there’s not even a scar.’\nAn S-class healer can reattach a dismembered body in an instant, but his body had been dismembered down to the guts, and she managed to save him?\n‘No, she can’t. She specializes in trauma. She can’t treat internal injuries.’\nAt best, it greatly enhances natural recovery but it was not enough to bring someone back from the brink of death.\n“Takeda-san!”\nHunters in suits rush in, not long after Takeda woke up. They had apparently been waiting outside.\n“Ishida. Fumio.”\n“You’ve been out for a week!”\nThe A-class Hunters on Takeda’s team were delighted at his recovery, but he was full of questions.\n“The demon sword… what happened to it?”\n“……missed it.”\n“You missed it?!”\nFour S-class Hunters had been defeated. There was no telling how much damage they might have suffered after they fell, and they missed it?\n“However, His Majesty Lionheart has a proposal regarding the matter.”\n“The Lionheart King?”\n“Would you like to check out the video?”\nFumio pulled out her cell phone and showed Takeda a YouTube video.\n“TTG Guild Channel?”\nTakeda was familiar with the channel. It was a YouTube channel set up by the Survivor’s Guild, and the content was amazing.\nIt had been well translated and had become quite popular in Japan. I wondered if it was a video of the battle after he had fallen.\nThe video was basically a well-edited compilation of bodycam footage from the hunters in the raid. AI rendering technology was used to neatly upscale the smartphone quality to 8K.\n‘Is the South Korean government providing technicians?’\nJudging by the extraordinary image quality correction capabilities and over a hundred translations, it seemed like a very big project. There must have been a hundred technicians and academics involved.\nTakeda, the second-in-command of the All-Japan Association, was well aware of this, as he often brought up this kind of correction work.\nEven so, the quality of the video on the TTG Guild channel was stunning.\n“Wait, was this live?”\nTakeda looked at the chat window next to the video and wondered.\nOf course, the All Japan Association or the Korean Hunter Association had made the Hunters wear body cams to publicize this combined offensive.\nThe demon sword appeared from a black gate and if the Japanese succeeded in capturing it, would make a good propaganda piece.\nBut that’s only if the capture is successful. If it fails, there’s no such propaganda.\nNaturally, they were going to post an edited video after all the battles were over…….\n‘Isn’t it like all the bodycam footage was broadcast and spread in real time?’\nNo, it doesn’t. The bodycam footage goes through a control center. It’s a military network with the highest security in Japan…….\nAside from that, Takeda, who was checking the footage, kept his mouth shut but soon Takeda’s jaw dropped as he checked the footage, which appeared to be from one of the Hunters’ body cameras.\nA one-sided defeat that not only the Japanese Hunters but also the Korean Hunters were forced to endure.\n-What? Takeda, our number two in Japan, is so easily defeated?\n-It’s strange to say the least. The Demon Swordsman is too strong.\nYes, the Demon Swordsman he faced now was different from the ones he faced before.\nOne of the reasons why S-class Hunters were so easily defeated was due to the debuff trait he unleashed.\nIgnore defense, reduced resistance…Cheat debuffs that increase damage by at least 70%, not just 10% or 20%.\nWith such ridiculous debuffs, even S-tier Hunters were unable to perform to their full potential. So how come…….?\n-Crazy… Berserker’s down.\n-Damn it, we’re going to get all our Hunters killed helping these idiots!\n-Do something!\nWaves of Japanese, Korean, American, Australian, European, Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, and other languages flood the chat.\n-It’s the Lionheart King.\n-His Majesty Leon is up!\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart. Takeda swallowed hard at the sight of him.\nHis back… no, his entire battlefield was lit up with golden light.\n“It’s called the power of His Majesty Leon’s Holy Grail, and it scattered a mist in the sky that channeled holy power and restored a wide area.”\n“Even Takeda-san was able to heal his wounds thanks to it! It regenerated you cell by cell, even though your injuries were hopeless.”\n“The debuff also had…non-regeneration?”\nThe moment Leon appeared, his overwhelming buff stats rained down on everyone present.\n‘Even the highest ranking S-Class Commander can’t do this…!’\nEach and every one of the Buff Traits the two combatants called out was mind-boggling.\n‘Buffs that were granted just by existing, not by using a buff skill?’\nAdd to that the dizzying array of debuffs just by reading them… Leon’s mere existence is like an epic totem that changes the battlefield.\nBut apart from that, there’s the demon sword… Akasha, the self-appointed Demon Archduke, whose power was at a terrifying level.\n‘I know the debuffs prevented the S-class Hunters from using their strength, but even without that, would we have been able to win?’\nJust then, Akasha moved, and Takeda’s heart sped up in fear, even though he was only looking at a screen from the past.\n* * * *\nThe Japanese archipelago… no, the entire world was on edge.\nThe Wandering Demon Sword was actually Archduke Akasha, a demon of murder and destruction, and he had killed countless Hunters.\nThat alone was enough to make it a global topic, but the duel between Leon and Akasha caused a huge stir.\n-Crazy, demon archduke…….\n-I knew there was a demon on top of the Archdemons, but…….\nFirst was the shock of the Demon Archduke.\nMankind had already realized the existence of the Demon Archdukes through the East Sea Gate, but that was only inside the gate.\nNow they had seen firsthand that the Wandering Demon Sword was actually a Demon Archduke and what it could do.\nHe was a destructive force that overwhelmed S-class Hunters and ravaged islands.\nNevertheless, there was an equal amount of good news for humanity.\n-The Lionheart King!\n-His Majesty Leon.\n-Is he a human?\n-Demigod.\nThe story spread among the hunters and citizens who witnessed it, not just on video, but in person.\nThe heavens and earth shattered as the Holy Sword engulfed Akasha’s sword.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, wounded citizens were healed by the golden light that enveloped the island and felt the evidence of its divinity on their skin.\nEven on video, the scene was full of admirers, but what about those who witnessed it in person?\nPeople in Shikoku and the neighboring Kansai region began to call Leon their savior.\n[A savior! Believe in His Majesty the Lionheart! He is the savior of our world!]\nAt this point, Park Yong-shin, the owner of Hanbit Palace, moved quickly.\nHe first addressed the Japanese believers and proclaimed Leon as the savior.\nWith hundreds of thousands of followers in Japan alone, and a strong artificial intelligence across the sea, Japanese public opinion was bound to focus on Leon, whether they liked it or not…….\n[I am the Lionheart King]\nLeon did not miss this opportunity.\n* * * *\nThe atmosphere at the All-Japan Association was horrific.\nFour S-class Hunters had been killed and over a hundred Class A’s were dead, and Takeda was almost dead.\nThat’s how bad it was. The Japanese and Korean Hunters had been wiped out by a single demon swordsman.\n‘S-class Hunters were weak?’\nNo, of course not.\nBoth Japan and Korea sent only the best elites they could muster and their track record has been proven by their previous gate attacks.\nThe Demon Swordsman…the Demon Archduke was just too strong for them to imagine.\nWhat was even stranger was that even the Demon Archduke, who had slaughtered S-class Hunters, had been overwhelmed by Leon.\n“Damn it…….”\nChairman Kamiya swallowed dryly and felt a chill run down his spine, and it was no different for the other members of the Alliance.\nAn overwhelming power that could slice through the sky, cross the ocean, and cause thunderstorms!\nWas that all? The Demon Archduke’s terrible debuffs, as the Hunters testified.\nTo overcome them, the presence of the Lionheart King proved indispensable.\n‘There is no substitute…!’\nLeon was irreplaceable.\nNot just in force, but as a leader, and as a fighter on the battlefield…….\nChairman Kamiya sat back in his seat with a somber expression.\nThe influence of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild was spreading throughout Japan.\nOriginally, the Japanese had a light belief in gods and in a country that doesn’t have any major religions, a performance like this naturally attracts worship.\nSome shrines even have Leon’s photo on display.\n‘It’s dangerous…….’\nShortly after the battle, Leon made a bizarre move.\nHe began gathering worshippers at shrines across the country, performing unexplained rituals and meeting with political figures. Not surprisingly, Prime Minister Fujisawa was among them.\nMost dangerous of all, though it hasn’t become an official issue yet, comments that suggest he was ready to abandon the island of Shikoku and its 3.7 million citizens were leaked.\n“One S-class hunter is worth a million civilians, don’t you know that!”\nOf course, the All Japan Association is the largest private organization in Japan. It was also the most powerful.\nMajor media outlets could not go against them but Kamiya’s words were spreading like wildfire.\nIt was echoed within the organization.\n‘If the Koreans had failed…….’\nThey could have saved face by calling for a general mobilization of Japanese Hunters, or sought support from the United States and Europe but Leon had won overwhelmingly.\nWhat other human being in the world could cut through the sky, part the oceans, and single-handedly defeat a Demon Archduke?\nChairman Kamiya had tried to keep Leon in check, but if he touched him now, he would become a criminal.\n‘It’s okay, I still have thirty-three S-class Hunters left.’\nDespite suffering so many losses in a single battle, Japan has a huge talent pool.\nThe population is large enough, and the environment is conducive to finding and nurturing talent. They weren’t losing prospects to foreign countries like Southeast Asia and the Middle East.\nHe thought, ‘There’s nothing different. There’s only one thing I have to do from now on.’\nStop hostilities against the TTG Guild but he hadn’t even brought it to the surface in the first place.\nNaturally, he shares the credit for the alliance, honoring the sacrifices of the Japanese Hunters and promising a solid working relationship.\nLeon will only be in this country for a short time anyway. There may be a growing number of domestic worshippers of the TTG Guild, but that’s in the distant future.\n‘Leon Dragonia Lionheart…….’\nHe had to admit, he was too big for his own good. He was too big for Japan to contain, and he was sure it was the same for Korea.\nKamiya didn’t care if Leon was the king of the world, he only needed to be the king of Japan.\n‘Let’s have a banquet. We’ll have a big banquet, make a good case, and send them back to Korea in a hurry.’\nMr. Kamiya had a very reasonable plan. But──\n“I will announce it here and now. This king will open the gate, and we will put an end to that evil bastard.”\nI trust you will cooperate.",

      "content": "Chapter 118: The Avengers\nA banquet was held to celebrate the victory.\nAlthough they had succeeded in defeating the Demon Swordsman, the mood in the Japanese archipelago was now somber.\nFour of the country’s leading S-class Hunters were dead and over a hundred Class A Hunters had died.\nIn such a mood, it’s necessary to celebrate victory in order to forget defeat.\nLuckily, there’s someone to symbolize that: Leon.\n-Long live His Majesty Leon the King God Emperor!\n-The future of mankind depends on His Majesty Leon!\nNeither the Japanese government nor the All Japan Association wanted to cover up the fact that they had suffered heavy losses and were unable to defeat the Demon Sword despite those losses.\nIt’s also an uncomfortable fact that the TTG Guild is the only one that made a significant contribution to the Demon Sword campaign.\nThat’s why they had to package the outcome of this battle as a ‘victory’.\n“Wow!”\nHa-ri marvels at the splendor of the banquet hall.\nThe banquet hall, located outside the hotel, was set in a Japanese-style garden with a long walkway and a pond.\nAs they walked through the Japanese stone lantern path, which is often used for wedding photography, they saw a huge number of dishes lined up left and right for a gathering of guild executives.\nShe thought it was a traditional Japanese garden, but in this part, it was also a western-style banquet hall, which was designed to cater to foreign guests.\nIn the middle of the banquet hall, musicians playing the shamisen, a traditional Japanese instrument, play relaxing music, and staff dressed as chefs take care of the guests.\n“Wow, Sis, I’ve never seen anything like this before.”\n“Me neither. Oh, and I’ll have a drink.”\nHa-ri accepted a single glass from the waiter offering champagne.\n“… Elder sister, I want to drink too.”\n“Ugh! No, no. You’re too young to drink.”\n“I’ll be an adult in a few months, right?”\nSoo-ho whined, but Ha-ri scoffed and sipped her champagne.\nSoo-ho glared at Ha-ri, who was feasting to the fullest in a dress provided by the Japanese government.\n“Sister, aren’t you an Association employee? Shouldn’t you be over there with Mr. Oh, Kang-hyuk?”\n-Boom!\nHa-ri’s gaze darted to the center of the banquet hall, where Prime Minister Fujisawa and Oh Kang-hyuk were exchanging pleasantries.\nBehind them is standing in formal attire, department head Kim Jin-soo.\nHan Ha-ri, who isn’t technically a member of the TTG Guild, should be over there.\n“Soo-ho.”\n“Huh?”\n“In your life…when will you ever be so pampered?”\nHa-ri’s golden eyes sparked with fire.\n“What is it, senior?”\nJust then, Jae-hyuk interrupted, looking quite dapper in his suit.\n“Jae-hyuk, are you enjoying the party too?”\n“Not really. As a member of TTG Guild, I’m treated like a VIP.”\nHotel suites, dresses, and banquets.\nEver since the Demon Sword Battle, the TTG Guild has been treated like royalty down to the last soldier.\n“It must have been impressive to run across the sea and fight. You’re getting quite a few interview requests, aren’t you, Ha-ri?”\n“Absolutely! I’m an association employee, that’s all.”\nIn the Japanese archipelago, Leon’s video of the mythical battle was viewed over 100 million times in three days.\nThey’ve heard stories of people being promised tens of billions of dollars in ad revenue for each of the five-minute highlights.\nThe TTG Guild, which had absorbed the Hanbit Palace, had already guaranteed a fast rate of cultivation, and this battle drew a lot of attention.\nIt was no wonder that Leon was getting so much attention.\n“His Majesty isn’t the type to grant interviews.”\n“Queen Beatrice must be busy, too.”\nIt’s a tricky business to get access to TTG Guild Number One and Number Two so the Japanese naturally turned their attention to the ones beneath them.\n– Hunter Han Ha-ri, is it true that you are the one who used the holy law that allowed the guild members to walk on the sea?\n-Can you explain the Holy Law to me?\n-You use water and fire at the same time, how is that possible?\n-Would you ever consider becoming a Hunter in Japan?\n“Ugh… it was a little scary, was I being secretly photographed or something, like a hundred people all of a sudden rushing around.”\n“They say that the Senior Hunters are half-celebrities… but what kind of broadcast is this?”\nWith the organization’s top executives out of the picture, the people below them were naturally targeted.\nJae-hyuk has also been getting interview requests and high-priced scouting offers from reporters lately.\n“Both of you have a lot of trouble. Everyone is interested in holy law users.”\nThey allowed troops to run on the ocean, created waves to sweep enemies away, and rain down thunderbolts from the dry skies.\nThere were plenty of unique skills that could cause magical phenomena, but the Holy Law was a different kind of power.\n“By the way, where’s Chun So-yeon? Isn’t she a Holy Law user as well, and hasn’t she attracted quite a bit of attention?”\n“Speaking of which, His Majesty is nowhere to be seen.”\nThe three of them searched for the two of them, but they were nowhere to be seen in the banquet hall.\n* * * *\nChun So-yeon shuffled onto the second floor terrace of the banquet hall.\nEven though she is an adult, the off-the-shoulder party dress that showed off her legs was embarrassing, but it was familiar to her as she had participated in the family’s parties since long ago.\n-Ms. Chun So-yeon, you’re the next guild leader of the Divine Sword Guild, so why are you in the TTG Guild?\nA Japanese reporter who was quite persistent in requesting an impromptu interview.\nYes, she was planning to return someday and the only reason she was here is to get her hands on the Holy Law but none of the gods would grant her the power to do so with such impure intentions except for one.\n“I am the only one who will honor your foul bargain. Despite your distrust, I give you power. Do not take that good fortune lightly.”\nShe risked her soul for revenge but she had to do it, to appease her mother’s and the guild’s spirits.\nIt had to be done with her own hands, down to the last detail. But…….\n‘I wasn’t even a match.’\nShe thought she had gotten stronger with the Holy Law, with its omnipotence, and she did but it wasn’t enough.\n‘You’re not one of those knights or one of those orcs.’\nYou are nothing.\nThe words were harsh.\nHow stinging to be ignored by the object of one’s vengeance.\n“It’s not… over.”\n[Yes, it’s not over]\nThe darkness whispered in her ear and he was right.\nLeon has no intention of letting this raid end here. He planned to open a gate of his own and follow Akasha, just as he did with Holy Knight Jerea Relic Convoy gate.\nShe still has a chance.\n[But you are an unworthy foe. You have your talents, but they pale in comparison to his.]\n“Your Majesty…You mean?”\nVentasis knew that his blessing would not be enough for her to face the Demon Archduke.\nThe Demon Archduke is the second in command, directly beneath the Demon Lord. They are the most powerful demons who would normally vie for the position of Lord.\nEven Ventasis has seen only a few powerful Holy Knights in its long history that could rival the Demon Archdukes.\nAmong the Holy Knights, only the Holy Knights of War could do it but it’s just that Leon is so out of the norm.\n[But there is a way, my child has actually succeeded, for he has defeated the Demon Archduke of Sloth]\n“Is that… true?”\nSomeone with the blessings of the God of Darkness and Vengeance has defeated a Demon Archduke.\n[I’ll give you that power if you want it]\n“I have already paid the price of my soul. I have no more…….”\n[If it’s to kill the demons, I don’t need anything in return, the soul is just a condition of receiving the power]\nChun So-yeon was tempted by Ventasis. No, it wasn’t a seduction.\nIt’s just that she and Ventasis have the same common goal.\n“Then…….”\n“Forget it, you’re not crossing a river of no return.”\n“……!”\nShe turned around to find a tuxedoed Leon staring straight at her.\n“Your Majesty…….”\nSo-Yeon stood and bowed as Leon said.\n“Power out of proportion is expensive.”\n“Are you asking me to give up……revenge?”\nSo-yeon didn’t hide her repulsion at Leon’s insistence, knowing that what he was about to say would end up being the same old clichéd advice from her grandfather and other adults.\n“If you’re going to say something about the futility of revenge or that the living must live, then──”\n“Who do you think I am, I am the avenger of the gods.”\n[Hmph…so it should be]\nVentasis agreed.\n[Wench, imitate him, for he has lost his people, his comrades, his country, his world, and sworn a vengeance more bitter than any other.]\nIt was a vengeance so great that even Ventasis was moved.\n[That man has fought alone for two hundred years to avenge his losses, he is a great avenger who has triumphed against the impossible]\nHe destroyed three Demon Lords and two Archdukes, and beheaded over forty Archdemons while slaying millions of demons in the process.\nHe traveled from one end of the planet to the other, slaying every single demon in his path.\nIt was a journey of vengeance so great that even the God of Vengeance, Ventasis, was ecstatic.\nWould he deny her vengeance? No.\n“This king does not deny revenge. He embraces it and has spent so many years fighting for it.”\n“For the gods… no?”\n“It was just a common goal.”\n“Then why…….”\nHe makes it sound like he’s encouraging her revenge.\n“Revenge is sweet. But it must be done in cold blood. If you give yourself up for revenge, it’s not revenge at all.”\nLeon looked at the faceless dark god behind So-yeon’s back and said.\n“Mortals are easily seduced by power and abandon themselves, and you are offering the destruction of mortals as a condition.”\n[There is a difference in aesthetics. I approve of all vengeance but this one lacks the strength to achieve it, so she must pay the price.]\n“This mortal has a backstory, a future. Do you intend to take it away, as you did with ‘the child’?”\nThat child….So-yeon suddenly remembered hearing Ventasis say something similar. When Ventasis had blessed the Starsteel Armor, when Leon had intervened──\n“Like when you lost your daughter?”\nLeon’s daughter. Could she be related to Ventasis?\n[The Archduke of Dragonia borrowed the power she deserved from me, and got her wish]\n“And she didn’t get anything in return, did she?”\n[Yes, due to an unexplainable accident, though I think I understand now]\n“The deal is done. I paid the price.”\n[I’m not going to deny your credit, you’re the greatest avenger, but this and that are two different things]\n“…….”\nThere was a moment of silence between Leon and Ventasis but it was Ventasis who finally surrendered, preferring to compromise than lose the favor of the Lionheart King.\n[Speak the alternative, the darkness and vengeance will listen to you]\n“This king will help the child get revenge.”\n“Your Majesty…!”\nLeon protested.\n“You may have the power to avenge yourself, and the God of Darkness and Vengeance certainly has the power to do so. However, it will end up extinguishing your soul.”\n“Something like that──!”\nI can take it. Chun So-yeon was about to say so when she met Leon’s furious gaze and was forced to shut up.\n“Don’t take the destruction of your soul lightly. Even a sociopath who betrays the gods retains his soul. They get what they deserve and have a chance to purify.”\n“Do not underestimate the price you will pay for being blinded by your own blood, young one who has not even lived half a century.”\n“You will never enter the banquet hall of the gods, nor will you have the chance to be pardoned for your sins while your soul is torn apart. Nor will you be left behind as an avenger of darkness and vengeance.”\n“The price you are about to pay is the burning of your soul. Do you not know that?”\nLeon saw the daughter he’d lost in Chun So-yeon but he didn’t deny that his actions were not out of remorse.\n“Young one, if you are going to speak of revenge, cool your head first.”\n“If you feel a lack of strength, find something to fill it, but don’t lose yourself.”\n“Do not be afraid to laugh, for at the end of revenge you must laugh.”\nLeon did not discuss tolerance, mercy, or oblivion.\nHe had done too much revenge to say that living well is true revenge, and──\n“Who do you really want to avenge?”\n“That, of course…!”\n“The one, who killed your mother and your friends, or yourself, who was chosen by the Demon Sword.”\n“……!”\nAt Chun So-yeon’s reaction, Leon let out a deep sigh.\nThis child is so damn similar to my daughter.\nLooking for someone to hate, blaming her father, and ultimately blaming herself──\n“It’s because of you, Your Majesty, you and I… killed him.”\nThe father and daughter had paid too high a price.\nIn the end, only the failed father remained.",

      "content": "Chapter 119: Creating a public opinion\nS-class Hunter Chun Ji-ho, a promising genius swordsman and the next heir to the #1 hunter guild in the country, the Divine Sword Guild and Hanara, a quasi-S-class hunter who was considered an equal genius.\nParents she admired and was proud of.\nOften traveling to the provinces to capture gates, So-yeon’s parents would take her with them on school days off to spend time with their daughter.\nChun So-yeon was the sweetheart of Chun Ji-ho’s raid team, and So-yeon loved her parents and her raid hunter uncles and aunts.\nBut four years ago in Ulsan Chun So-yeon was greeting her parents as they came out of the gate like any other day, when a “demon sword” appeared in front of her.\n[That’s quite a bowl. You have talent]\nTake the sword. I will make you the strongest swordsman.\nEven though she was only fourteen years old, she instinctively recognized the ominous aura of the demon sword. But… she reached out.\nIt wasn’t her will but the aura it emitted, the temptation, was beyond the power of ordinary human will to resist.\n“So-yeon…!”\nJust as Chun So-yeon was about to grab the sword, it was her father, Chun Ji-ho, who grabbed the hilt of the demon sword.\n“It’s because of me, because I was tempted by the demon sword…….”\nHer father took the sword for her, and she became the sixth generation of Demon Swordsman.\nHis mother and the uncles and aunts of the raiding party had all died at his hands.\n“You know what? It is said that the Demon Sword… wanders in search of humans with the most exceptional swordsman’s temperament, and the reason it came to Ulsan… was because of me.”\nFrom that day forward, So-yeon was given her destiny.\nKill her father, who became a demon swordsman, and take revenge on herself, who was the cause of everything.\nThus, her revenge would be twofold.\n“Stupid.”\n“…….”\nAs Leon listened to the poignant story, he denied her vengeance.\n“How can the target of revenge be the victim and not the perpetrator? You’ve got the target of revenge all wrong.”\n“……Are you saying that my true target of revenge is the Demon Archduke?”\n“That’s right.”\nChen So-yeon hadn’t realized that the Wandering Demon Sword was a creature. It was a fact that no one on Earth knew.\n“Make amends with the God of Darkness and Vengeance, and take the revenge you deserve. That would be the right way to be an avenger.”\n“But I…I’m not even a match for him.”\n“Recall what a miracle you have before you.”\nLeon chuckled and placed a hand on Chun So-yeon’s shoulder. A moment later… in front of the throng of government officials, reporters, and Hunters in the ballroom, he declared.\n“I declare it here and now. This king will open the gate and we will put an end to this scoundrel.”\n* * * *\nI will open the gates and slay the Demon Archduke.\nLeon’s words shocked the Hunters and others gathered in the ballroom.\n“Open… the gate… is that even possible?”\n“It is possible……..”\nBeatrice jumped to the podium at Leon’s call, and she wasn’t the only one.\n“Lord Spinner.”\n-Da-da-da-da!\nA minimalist mechanical spider climbs the stairs. It was Yakt Spinner, the first Holy Knight of the TTG Guild.\n-Tsk!\nWith a sputter of machine language, Yappy projected a giant holographic image in the center of the ballroom.\n-What is that?\n-It appears to be a hologram.\n-Was that… a practical application of the technology?”\n-As far as that kind of precision imaging goes…….\nYappy showed a video of the moment when the TTG Guild formed an artificial gate and entered it.\n“Hmph…A gate was created?!”\n“Your Majesty, is that video real?”\nThe fact that the Demon Sword had created the gate was well known among the Hunters, but it hadn’t yet spread to the civilian world.\nTo the shocked reporters, Beatrice explained slowly.\n“Gates can be artificially created. It’s more of a phenomenon. The question is, ‘which’ gate?”\nA reporter raised his hand.\n“So… you’re saying you can artificially select the gate you want?”\n“Not 100%, but you must have something that can help you pick the coordinates.”\nThe roaring reporters, the Hunters, the higher-ups and the government officials came to one conclusion.\n“Your Majesty, you mean to open the gate and slay the Demon Archduke…….”\n“We will open the gate after his escape. This time, we will end the evil bastard.”\nChase the fleeing Demon Sword and slay it.\nThere was no one here who did not know what that meant.\n* * * *\n“Foolish.”\nChairman Kamiya was appalled by Leon’s declaration.\n“Mr. Chairman…….”\nTakeda, who had come to the banquet hall to assist Chairman Kamiya, swallowed what he wanted to say.\nAs far as he was concerned, Leon’s declaration was not realistic.\nOpening the gate is good. It’s amazing that they have the ability to do that but apart from that, the problem is that the being he’s trying to defeat is the Demon Archduke.\n“We, Japan, have already suffered great losses. There’s no point in sending a bunch of people here to attack a Black Gate.”\nThe Black Gate is a gate of immeasurable difficulty that must be captured at the risk of national honor.\nAny country would be disgusted by this, let alone Chairman Kamiya himself.\n“But Mr. Chairman, this might be an opportunity.”\n“A chance?”\n“Yes. We haven’t gotten anything out of this slaughter. Besides, with the Lionheart King, we can slay even those nasty demons. It won’t even be able to resurrect like the one in Shanghai.”\nA demon is something that cannot be killed.\nThe Archdemon Skazakari, the one responsible for the Shanghai massacre, was slain many times, only to be resurrected and turn Shanghai into a hellhole.\nBut with Leon, they don’t have to worry about the immortality of demons.\nLeon’s power, the Holy Law, extinguishes the demon’s soul itself.\n“That’s the problem!”\n“What?”\n“Even if they manage to defeat the Demon Archduke, all of your hard work will go to the TTG Guild. The Hunters of the Alliance will be nothing more than accessories for him.”\n“…….”\nBut Takeda felt that he had to put that aside and defeat the Demon Archduke now.\nDemons have an unreasonable tendency to resurrect and return after being defeated.\nWhat if the Wandering Demon Sword returned after regaining its strength? What guarantee was there that the Lionheart King would be with them then?\nAbove all…….\n“Nishimori, Asada, Miyamura, Kanae… they were all great hunters, even for their revenge──”\n“Those weaklings can be replaced, there are still over thirty S-class Hunters in Japan!”\n“…….”\nTakeda’s brow narrows. He was fed up with Chairman Kamiya treating even S-class Hunters as expendable.\nWithout even seeing Takeda’s expression, Chairman Kamiya continues.\n“Besides, the people won’t accept it. No one wants to see a black gate in front of their house.”\nPresident Kamiya doesn’t usually care about the public’s opinion, but when it’s in his favor, he takes it into account.\nHowever public opinion has begun to take a strange turn.\n* * * *\nLeon’s public declaration that he will slay the Demon Archduke has, unsurprisingly, become a hot topic throughout Japan.\nFirst was the need to open a new gate off the coast of Shikoku to follow Akasha’s trail.\nThen there was the massive amount of magic stones required to open the gate, which the Japanese government would provide.\nMost importantly, he called for the massive participation of Japanese hunters in the hunt.\n-Why would we want to capture the Demon Archduke in Japan?\n-If we fail and there’s a dungeon break in Japan, we’ll be blamed for it.\n-We’ve already lost a lot of hunters in Japan.\n“Hmm… of course they’ll say that.”\nHa-ri had a look of helplessness on her face as she read the internet reactions that the Yakt Spinner was translating in real time.\nOf course, it’s in the best interest of humanity as a whole to take down the Demon Archduke when they can.\nIt would be shortsighted and self-serving to let an Archduke go because they’re afraid of the damage to their own country, because the demon will soon recover and invade Earth again.\nLogically, it would be wise to follow Leon’s lead but apart from that, people don’t like to lose.\nThey recoil from the idea of sacrifice for the greater good.\n“If this were the Lionheart Kingdom, we wouldn’t be having this debate.\n“I’d gladly give my life for the chance to slay an Archduke!” the hard-core demon-hater would say.\n“Lord Yappy…won’t this be hard? It looks like even the All Japan Association won’t cooperate, citing public opinion.”\n-Hmm?\nAt Ha-ri’s question, Yappy looked at her as if she were a savage who had found fire and could only roast meat.\n“How is it possible for a camera eye to display such a wide range of emotions?!”\n-Public opinion is not formed. They are ‘made’.\n“For example?”\n-Triggering the appropriate protocols. Taking over Japanese networks. 3…2….\n“Lord Yappy?”\n-……Takeover complete.\nAt that moment the internet comments that Ha-ri had been reading were flooded with dislikes and objections, and new ones began to appear.\n-How dare you say that in front of people who’ve been killed by demons. Aren’t you the devil’s followers for letting the devil go?\n-Proud Japanese hunters have been murdered. We must avenge them.\n-Fleeing here is like surrendering to the demons. Everyone who says we shouldn’t attack the gate now is a demon follower.\nIt’s not just the comments.\nAs if to bury the articles that were skeptical or negative about the gate attack, articles supporting the gate attack and its benefits began to pour in.\n-Japan will never give in to the demons!\n-Korea Hunter Association pledges full support. The All Japan Association still hesitates.\n-The Otherworldly Lionheart King, who has come to Japan’s defense, promises to lead the way.\n-After defeating the Demon Archduke, the Transcendent sided with Japan.\n“Uh, uh, Lord Yappy! Lord Yappy, suddenly the public opinion on the Internet has started to change? This is no joke! I guess people’s goodwill…….”\n-Kiruk. Attempt to manipulate public opinion discovered. Blocked. Blocked. Blocked. Began work on exposing the scandal of the Strategic Opposition.\n“Lord Yappy?”\nHa-ri looked at the additional articles posted as breaking news.\n-Leak of shocking remarks by All Japan Association President Kamiya. A single S-class Hunter is worth a million citizens.\n-Four-term LDP lawmaker found to have shocking off-the-books funds. Where did the money come from?\n-Japan’s S-class hunters, who refuse to attack because they value their lives. When did Yamato’s samurai become such cowards?\nArticles that would normally never be published under the watchful eye of the All Japan Association appeared.\n“You crazy bastard! What are you doing? What are these articles?”\n“Ugh! That’s unfair! We never published anything like this!”\n“Shut up and get off!”\n“Hey, the server is down, I can’t even access the Internet!”\nThe media outlets were blocked with pinpoints. Even the Nippon Keizai was hacked, and no one could make a move against them.\n-We, the great nation of Japan, do not need to be at the mercy of the Chong (a derogatory term for Koreans).\nWe must take revenge on the Chongs for sacrificing Japanese hunters in an all-out war.\nBefore some far-right sites could react, their community servers were blown up. It was an EMP attack.\n-Controlled. Public approval of the gate attack remained in the 80s.\nAs Ha-ri watched, she thought to herself.\n‘Is this okay?’\nWas she watching the birth of a media-controlled dystopian dictatorship?\nApart from that, people from all walks of life in Japan were also starting to make moves, fueled by the power of public opinion.\n“Prime Minister Fujisawa, dismiss the president of the All Japan Association, order the creation of a temporary government-affiliated hunter organization, announce unlimited supply of blessed crops and ‘gate-operable reconnaissance drones’!”\n“Hunter Takeda, second in command of the All Japan Association declares that he will repay the price of his colleagues’ lives! Will he part ways with Chairman Kamiya?”\n“Chairman Kamiya Exposed for Illegal Political Funding. Prosecutors begin investigation.”\n“The Japanese branch of the TTG Guild expands! It is recognized as an official religion and begins its activities.”\nTen days after the defeat of the Demon Sword.\nThat’s how long it took for the TTG Guild to take over all of Japan.\n* * * *\nWith public opinion under control, the government and the Hunter’s Association in full cooperation, the gate attack was prepared in a flash.\nFirst, the government warehouses were opened and a huge amount of magic stones were prepared, and as Chairman Kamiya’s remarks and scandal were exposed, Japanese Hunters from the All Japan Association joined the attack on the Japan-Korea Alliance.\n“Twelve S-class Hunters from Korea! Twenty-one from Japan! Over five hundred A-class Hunters from both countries! This is the largest raid ever!”\nThat’s not all, there were also a lot of B-class Hunters mobilized, including Leon’s TTG Guild members, bringing the total number to over 3,000.\nEven though more than a thousand people were mobilized from the TTG Guild alone, the Japanese B-class Hunters were not happy about the situation.\n-With the Lionheart King, we’ll be strengthened by at least one rank, which should help us considerably.\n-This is one of the few chances we have to attack the Demon Gate. If we do well, we could turn our lives around.\nThe governor and prime minister have agreed to provide gate-operated reconnaissance drones and tons of blessed crops to any raiding party that participates!\nPublic opinion may have turned against them, but Hunters from both Japan and Korea have a lot at stake in this raid.\nIt was the Blessed Crops, which were once famous, but were in short supply and barely available to even the largest guilds.\nThe TTG Guild, which holds the rights to the crop, has promised to supply it first.\nBlessed Crops are a high-end supply coveted by Hunters around the world, as they provide a significant amount of buff potions and health over time.\nIt’s worth joining just to get priority access to something you can’t buy. And──\n“The Temple of Ten Thousand Gods is announcing a scout drone that can be activated from the gate. It’s a revolution in gate capture that can observe the entire field.”\nElectronics don’t work properly inside the gate. This is due to mechanical failures caused by the high concentration of mana and miasma.\nAt best, small electronics, such as photography equipment, can barely work, and they cost a fortune.\nObviously, reconnaissance drones are out of the question, and satellites? There isn’t even a simple satellite technology that can be launched individually.\nYappy has already developed a combat satellite armament platform that works from the gate, but it hides the fact that it’s supplying the hunter raiders in the field.\nThey’ve even created a simple satellite, a reconnaissance drone unencumbered by magic and miasma.\nIn fact, in a small field, a reconnaissance drone would be much more cost-effective than a satellite.\n“Why is the Japanese government so cooperative?”\nHa-ri was puzzled by the strangely cooperative Japanese government but Beatrice, who had been leading the negotiations, shrugged it off.\n“Politics.”\n“Politics?”\n“For years, the Japanese government has been beholden to a private organization, the All Japan Association, and His Majesty has helped to break it up and create an independent Hunter’s Association under the Japanese government.”\n“Ah… ah, so the blessed crops and drone offerings…?”\n“Those were the first gifts we gave them in exchange for their cooperation.”\nBoth the blessed crops and the drones were given to the Japanese government so that they could be distributed by the government.\nNaturally, Japanese hunters need to look good to the government.\nCrops and drones are powerful items that can save the lives of raiders.\nIn Korea, it’s one thing to be manipulated by a top ten guild, but the All Japan Association, which was completely privatized and not even a government agency, was a blight on Japanese society.\nIt was only covered up by the Hunter’s heroization and public opinion manipulation.\nWhen that manipulation didn’t work, it didn’t take long for it to collapse.\n“Let’s get started.”\nLeon approached, and Ha-ri shot him a surprised glance.\nLeon had engineered all of this and in just ten days, he had brought down Japan’s impregnable fortress.\n“What?”\n“Nothing. Your Majesty is… smarter than I thought.”\nShe doesn’t say it, but her expression reveals the impure thought: He’s not just a thug…\n“This?”\nIt was Beatrice who saved Ha-ri from the brink.\n“Your Majesty, I will open the gate then.”\nThe massive combined invasion force of 3,500 hunters from Japan and Korea crossed the gate opened by Beatrice.\n“All the gods are with us. Even the Demon Sword is useless against the Lionheart King, who overpowered the Demon Archduke!\n‘I wonder how the Lionheart King and the Ten Thousand Gods Guild will fight.’\n‘I’m reluctant to face a demon, but only if there’s the Lionheart king…….’\nAs their thoughts intersect, they are met with a culture shock beyond their wildest dreams.\n“Take them all! They are not worthy of death!”\nLeon commands, but they can’t hide their dumbfounded faces.\n‘Something… something doesn’t seem right.’\nLeon’s gravelly voice reaches all 3,500 of them.\nHis voice, filled with boundless hatred and boundless anger, had a force that bent even the common sense they took for granted.\n“These scums will be reduced to serfdom and suffering, take as many as you can!”\nThe first thing the Allied Exterminators who entered the Demon Archduke’s territory did was──burning villages, slaughtering civilians and hunting down slaves.\n“”Is this, is this right?””\nThey had forgotten that the Lionheart King was a medieval fantasy super racist.",

No, we can win!\nAnd then came the quest.\n[You are an expedition following the Lionheart King on his quest to defeat Akasha, the Archduke of Slaughter. Help the Lionheart King defeat Akasha.]\nLeon said after hearing Ha-ri’s quest report.\n“Defeating him is a no-brainer. I’ll do what I can here to do but this is our first time in the Demon Realm, so let’s get as much information as we can.”\n-Kiruk.\nIt was then that Yappy walked over. Normally, it would have made a dull, mechanical sound, but today’s Yappy was different.\n“Ooh, oooh…!”\n“Aaah!”\nHe recalls old memories and is horrified.\n“Hey, Lord Yappy?”\nHa-ri had to look up to see the approaching Yappy.\nA cold disc-shaped fuselage, ominous red wide-angle lenses scanning the surroundings along with its eight thick legs were cold and hideous.\nWorst of all are the guns and bladders on the fuselage’s carapace. Snarling, heat-belching superconducting cannons and 60mm chain guns.\nThe Cheongju nightmare.\nA killing machine.\nEveryone is overwhelmed by the majesty of the massive multi-purpose vehicle.\n“Lord Spinner your exoskeleton is well crafted, and I sense a much stronger aura than before.”\n-Crack!\nThe carapace opens up, and from within, a minimalist Yappy stands up like a pilot out of a cockpit.\n-The original Yakt Spinner from the Integrated Armament Platform. Combat sequence operational. Reporting for recon.\n“Hmm, did they do it already?”\n-Integrated Platform’s drone reconnaissance system in operation. Multiple colonies of presumed hostiles detected.\n“Colonies?”\nDemons, he thought, but Yappy denied the possibility.\nYappy is a war machine that has kept the demons buried for a thousand years. However the energy he sensed from the demons was subtly different from what he had observed.\n“The nearest colony is that way.”\nLeon would be the first to meet them.\n* * * *\nThe colony was closer to the gate than he thought and after ten minutes they reached it.\n“Whoa, whoa, whoa!”\nPeople standing on the wooden fence, wary as they saw Leon and his group approaching.\n“Humans?”\nWhy would humans be here? Ha-ri scratched her head, while Leon took the lead.\n“Who are you people?”\n“No, I asked you first──”\n“How dare you, you insolent commoner, make me say your name twice! I will consider this a mistake born of ignorance.”\n“Ugh… Now, wait a moment, I’ll fetch the chief!”\nFrightened by Leon’s fierce anger, the man on the wooden stool backed away, and a new face appeared on the stool.\n“I am Veron, the chief of this village… Hmph, King Lionheart!”\n“You know this king?”\nThe village chief responded as if he knew him. Leon was about to ask something when a voice boomed through the woodwork.\n“Lord Spinner.”\nLeon snapped his fingers.\n-Cannon set.\nWith a bang, a railgun round shatters the woodwork.\nThe futuristic hardcore AI crunched through the rubble with its giant mechanical legs.\n“Hic…!”\nLeon and Yappy enter, and the terrified inhabitants fall to the ground. Leon knew they were in bad shape, to say the least.\n“Who are you guys, and why did you run away when you saw this king?”\n“God, help us!”\nLeon showed no anger toward the cowardly commoners. The majesty of a king can sometimes lead to the persecution of innocent people.\n“This did not come to persecute you. He’s here to slay a demon-hmm?”\nLeon heard the voice of the War God speaking to him. He said to Leon:\n[This is the one who was a soldier in the Imperial Army. A follower of the devil, mixed up in the ranks of the Archduke Slaughter.]\n“…….”\nLeon’s eyes widened as he recognized the man’s face from memory.\nDemon followers descended to earth and led the way in killing their own kind.\nIf such a man was the chief… What about this group?\n“All troops! Don’t let anyone escape! Kill those who flee!”\nThe flames of war erupted from Leon’s body.\n* * * *\nIf paradise is the end of those who followed the code of the gods and served them, what is the end of those who followed the demons and gave their souls to them?\nThere is demonization, for example.\nThe prefects and generals of the Empire who summoned Malus, Lord of Chaos, and embraced demonic power literally became demons, traitors who attacked humanity.\nBut what about the common people? The knights and soldiers of the Empire and the other barbarians.\nThey were too small a vessel to become demons and they couldn’t take on all of the demonic energy and transform the race itself.\nOf course, the demons had their own rewards for such lowly followers.\nIn the realms ruled by the higher demons, they became subjects.\nOf course, there was one reward for the commoners that followed the demons: immortality.\nThere was a natural limit to their immortality: they would die, but they would not grow old.\n“But it was all a trick to keep us as slaves; we were forced to answer the demons’ summons endlessly, and we never knew when we would die!”\nVeron was an Imperial Army Sergeant and when the demons descended, he followed his commander and offered his soul to the murderous demons.\nHe was lucky enough to escape from Leon’s world before the last Demon Gate was destroyed.\nHe knelt before Leon and said.\n“Please save us, Lionheart King, and forgive your people for making this foolish choice!”\nVeron burst into tears and clutched at Leon’s pants while the knight cadets had mixed feelings as they watched.\nThey, too, had been seduced by demons and forced to commit evil deeds──\n“What bullshit.”\nIt couldn’t be true.\n“What?”\n“Answer me this, scumbag, how many innocent commoners have you killed by your own hand?”\n“That, that’s…….”\n“I ask! How many innocent people have you killed? Those who can answer, come forward!”\nThe kneeling inhabitants of the colony were silenced by Leon’s rant.\nThey may not have become demons, but their service was recognized by the demons and they were reduced to ‘slaves’.\nHow many other innocent people had they killed for their own survival and enrichment?\n“I couldn’t help it but the general gave in to the demons, what could I do?”\n“It is your actions, not your intentions that define you. Your intentions do not absolve you of your sins.”\nWith a snap, the blade was drawn. The holy sword in its sheath lit up the darkness with a brilliant golden glow but the blinding light was a terrible death sentence for Veron.\n“Do not blame the King for your sins. The judgment to come is solely the result of your choices. I am not responsible for the judgment.”\n“Aaah…….”\n“A sin committed in ignorance is not a sin; a sin committed with difficulty is not a sin; a sin is a sin. Big or small, hard or easy.”\nFalling flat on his face, Veron turned his hatred of the demons toward Leon, knowing he would never be forgiven.\nHe did it because he couldn’t help himself. He did it because he wanted to live, and he didn’t want to do it.\n“But even scum like you were once the people of the benevolent gods.”\n“……!”\nIn the darkness, even a small light can seem like salvation. Veron and the rest of the group’s demonic followers responded to the space Leon had left.\n“I will preserve your souls until your sins are punished by Tatar, the God of Judgment.”\nFew understood what that meant but at the mere mention of the name Tatar, Veron’s complexion turned blue.\n“Fifty years as a serf, so that you may purify your wasted life in the service of the gods!”\nFifty years, not a long time for the followers of the Archduke.\n‘Serfdom? Even now, I’m a slave to a demon and I don’t know I’ll die, but a slave with a fixed term?’\n“Thank you for your mercy──”\nHe was about to spew out his heartfelt gratitude with tears in his eyes.\n“Don’t be ridiculous!”\nThe gazes of the demonic followers twisted in disbelief.\nLeon’s terms are so benevolent that they’re almost grateful, but why is he so paroxysmal in his refusal?\n“Will you shut your filthy mouth?”\n“I don’t like it, I don’t like it, I don’t like it, I don’t like it, Lionheart, I don’t like it!”\nHe’s from a wealthy family, so he’s been riding horses as a commoner and hasn’t gotten over his bad habits.\nThat said, the noble and wealthy among the Demon Followers hated to see themselves fall to the bottom of the heap.\nEven in the villages of these demon followers, they’d look down on the mayor.\n“Damn it! Someone shut that bastard’s mouth!”\n“I’m not going to be a serf, I’m not going to be a serf, I’m not going to be a serf!”\nVeron’s resistance was cut off by the other demon followers. As the gagged man was dragged through the crowd of demonic followers, Leon shouted.\n“Listen, you bastards.”\nThe colony’s inhabitants obeyed and awaited judgment.\n“You will serve as serfs of Lionheart for fifty years, and you will carry out every command without reservation.”\n“Do you accept the punishment that Leon Dragonia Lionheart, Agent of the Tatar, God of the Sun and Judgment, has decreed for you?”\n“I accept!”\n“”I accept!””\nAt that moment an intense beam of sunlight emanated from Leon and soon pierced through them.\n“Uh, uh, uh?”\n“Mo, something in your neck?”\nThe change was simple. A series of pure white rings, like tattoos appeared on their necks.\n“Hmph. We’ll leave right away. Pack as little as possible and follow this king’s lead!”\nThe demonic followers had no choice but to follow Leon with dumbfounded eyes. Unaware of the promise of judgment they’d sworn to or what the Veron-inspired cries meant.\nBut it didn’t matter.\nThey would find out soon enough.\n“Oh, no! No, no, no!”\nOnly Veron knew the ending, and he could only sob in agony.\n* * * *\n“Take them all! They are not worthy of death!”\nReturning to the main camp, Leon began to subjugate the entire region.\nHe burned and looted villages, killing those who resisted.\nAt the end of it all was a bizarre act of plunder called “serfdom.”\n“Is this it?”\nThe hunters of the joint Japanese-Korean raiding party were dumbfounded and had to start taking prisoners.\nWhat’s even more bizarre is that the inhabitants are more civilized than they expected.\nAs followers of the demons, they expected a lot of resistance, but when they heard Leon’s offer of 50 years of serfdom, they didn’t seem to mind.\n“I suppose it’s better than being a slave to the demons.”\n“Apparently, the demon followers don’t grow old. I guess they think fifty years is a short time.”\n“That’s damn reasonable.”\nOccasionally, unlike the other Demon Followers, a few put up a fight, but those who did were decapitated with steel wire by a cold steel machine.\n-Crackle! Free labor in large numbers. 5,034.\nThe villages of the demon followers were plundered, and all the wealth that came out of them went to the Hunters.\nLeon called it filthy lucre and distributed it among the other Hunters, so it was worth the slave hunt.\n-Discovered a large army of demons.\nBy the time they were done, they had taken out dozens of colonies but the demons had had enough of my front yard being ransacked, and they came from beyond.\nThe demons of killing and destruction, in other words, the henchmen of Akasha, the Archduke of Slaughter, appeared.\n“Finally, a moment that can be called a battle.”\n“It’s a good thing I’m so tired.”\nThe Hunters, who had won victory after victory in plundering battles despite facing an army of demons, were in high spirits.\nBut against their expectations, Leon gave the order.\n“Serfs, forward.”\nThe serfs, each of them armed with the best weapons in town, reacted dumbfounded.\n“Uh, are we in the lead?”\n“No, we’re no match!”\nDemons and their followers, naturally, are a lost cause but to have a bunch of prisoners take the lead?\n“Even if your limbs are severed and your intestines spilled, hold on to at least one more enemy for that is all you are worth on the battlefield.”\nBecome a meat shield.\nA more blatant suicide order could not have been given.",

For that is all you are worth on the battlefield.”\nThe serfs recoiled at the open invitation to die.\n“What!”\n“And you call yourself a knight of justice!”\n“Don’t be ridiculous! I became a serf just to die like this-─!!!”\nThe serfs couldn’t even answer Leon’s glare, and they were shuffled to the front of the line like stiff puppets.\n“You have already accepted your punishment, and you will not die easily until you ‘complete your punishment’.”\nAll serfs in Lionheart are reduced to serfdom by the judgment of Tatar, God of the Sun and Judgment.\nThere is no “freedom” for serfs who are not freemen.\nIt’s not just a meaning or a symbol, it’s a real deprivation of the concept of freedom.\n“Ugh, ugh, ugh…….”\nThey were forced to move at the command of the Lionheart King, to fulfill his orders against their will.\nThe demons looked on in disbelief as the serfs marched right up to them.\n-Are these people insane?\n-Go back to your villages! What are you doing?\n“Charge!”\nKing Lionheart commanded and the serfs charged.\n“Arrrrrrgh!!!”\n“I don’t want to die!”\nThe serf meat shields, deprived of their physical freedom and forced to do as they were told, clashed with the demons.\nNaturally, a one-sided massacre and slaughter was expected, but they held up surprisingly well, thanks to Leon’s favor.\n[Lionheart King’s Serf Charge]\nEffect:\n-Grants Meat Shield.\n-Grants Tenacity.\n-Increases Strength.\n-Increases Survival Instinct.\n-Increases Vitality by 250%.\nUsing even his serfs as a viable “resource,” King Lionheart’s serfs have proven to be meat shields, even in hand-to-hand combat with demons.\nThey are even healed by the Holy Grail as soon as they are injured, what a gracious gesture on the part of King Lionheart!\n“Send the hunters into the chariot! Use the gap to flank the enemy!”\nWhile the serfs held off the demons, Leon spread his hunters out like two wings and surrounded the demons.\nThe demons were a large army, over three thousand in number, and of great quality, but they were being held back by the five thousand serfs.\n“Our flanks are empty!”\n“With so many flanks, this is what you get!”\nFor the Hunters, who are used to 50-man raids, the overwhelming number of allies is a new experience.\nEasily flanked by meat shields, the Hunters became powerful hammers, pounding away at the demons.\n“Argh!”\n“The humans…!”\nThe demons fought back, surrounded on three sides, but their numbers were too great.\n“Whoa, something’s coming from the rear!”\nLeon and his 40 knights, including Holy Knight Yakt Spinner and Death Priestess Beatrice along with Han Ha-ri, a priestess of two gods.\nLeon let out a thunderous roar as he rode the war bull of Petos, the god of war and flame.\n[Mightiest Charge] is applied to the troop.

While he understood the idea of sharing the spoils, Leon said no for another reason.\n“There are many spoils to plunder this gate but the voices of the demons will tempt and test you.”\n“We will not fall for the devil’s twists!”\n“Are you so sure you won’t?”\n“…….”\nTakeda could not answer. But he also wanted to prove that they had captured the Demon Gate.\nA captured demon would be a good propaganda piece.\nNow that he had split from the Alliance, Takeda needed an excuse.\n“Hmm… It’s unreasonable to keep the demons alive… but if there are only three of them…….”\nLeon turned to the captured demons.\nThe demons of murder and destruction are the most unruly and destructive of all demons, they were not easy to capture.\nEven though they were in a cage, they seemed to have the energy to break the grate.\n“Damn it, tie them up!”\n“Don’t get too close!”\nThe Hunters were barely tying them up as they tore off additional binding scrolls, but the snarling demons were menacing.\n“We will destroy you and open the slaughterhouse! You will be doomed! Wahahahahahahahaha!”\nDemonic voices that would drive a normal human insane just by hearing them and even the Hunters trembled in fear at the demon’s insane curses.\n“Shut up, you demon!!”\nThe Lionheart King’s chop crushed a skull.\nThe demon whose skull had been crushed by Leon and one of its eyeballs had popped out, stuttered, unable to get the words out.\n“These fiends try to curse people with their sly tongues every chance they get.”\n-Hiss!\n-Bam!\nThe demons fell silent at Leon’s entrance. Some of the shivering demons were even leaking yellow liquid from their crotches.\n“Hmph…….”\nAs Leon rolled his eyes like he was judging a fish at a slaughterhouse, the demons tried to avert their gaze. ‘They’re like dogs that met a groomer,’ thought one Hunter as he watched the demons close their mouths as if making a promise before the dreaded Lionheart King.\nThe demons that the other Hunters had poked with spears and tied with ropes were now as docile as dogs in a cage.\n“This one and that one should be okay.”\nLeon points to a few demons and opens the cage. The demon that had been rattling the cage earlier shook and ducked as Leon opened the grate.\n“Huh?!”\nIt is yanked out, its face and torso slamming into the grate and shattering it. It bounces back and is slammed to the ground by Leon, who grabs it by the tail.\n“Bam!”\nThe demon’s skull cracked as it was thrown from the back and Leon handed it to Takeda.\n“……Your Majesty?”\n“This is enough to make the demon stop thinking and start drooling. They are said to be ornamental, except that when they see a butterfly, they break free and chase it.”\nDid he know anyone close to him who enjoyed such things?\nTakeda couldn’t bring himself to ask the question that would lead him to that abyss. Anyway, a demon who drooled and said he liked the leash around his neck.\nLeon stood up firmly as he took over these demons.\n“Two days. We’ll deal with them two days after you return, so you know.”\n“Ah, yes…….”\nTakeda snapped a few pictures of them, thinking that he should just hand them over and move on.\n“Then let’s get to their leader.”\n“You’re going to use…serfs again?”\nSeeing the serf meat shields, which were somewhat of a culture shock to modern humans, Takeda was fed up.\n“We’ve hunted a lot of demons, but the damage on this side is still pretty heavy.”\nThe total casualties reached nine hundred. Most of them were dead.\n“Yeah, a lot of them are hurt, but ten… no, maybe more than twenty dead.”\n“What?”\nTakeda scratched his head at the strange math.\n“Your Majesty, in the battle a little while ago, over nine hundred died.”\n“Hmm?”\nNine hundred and sixteen to be exact.\nAlmost 1000 of them were killed, which is a serious mortality rate for a war.\nEven after hearing such casualties, Leon stared at Takeda as if he couldn’t make sense of it.\n“Are you… are you including the serfs in your numbers?”\n“……?”\nAt that moment, Takeda remembered the numbers he’d been briefed on.\nHunter casualties, 34. Serf casualties, 882.\nOf those, if you exclude the serf casualties…….\n“34 hunters…….”\n“Yes, that would be correct.”\nLeon patted Takeda on the shoulder while Takeda stared at Leon’s back and felt a profound internal conflict.\nAre humans…are they really better than demons?\n* * * *\nAfter fleeing from Leon, Akasha locked herself in the castle of her estate.\n“Ugh.”\nPain radiates from the mouth of Chun Ji-so. Though he had lost his body and borrowed the form of a sword, her host’s pain was her own.\n‘The wound from the holy sword is deep.’\nThe blow of the holy sword, imbued with the power of all the gods, was intimidating to Akasha, and it is a wonder that his power is not comparable to his prime.\nMoreover, Akasha’s wounds weren’t only caused by the holy sword. The effects of the Holy Law left by Leon’s holy spear at the moment of the gate leap were still slowing down her physical regeneration.\nIndeed, the Lionheart King is the demon’s nemesis.\n‘After all… it must be a monarch.’\nThe pinnacle of all evil, the Demon Lords.\nThough most of the Demon Lords perished in the expedition, their strength was in no way inferior to the Lionheart King.\nIn fact, most of the Demon Lords were more powerful than the Lionheart King.\n‘It was the addition of his knights that allowed him to defeat Dothraddon, Lord of Pleasure, Malus, Lord of Chaos, and Caracael, Lord of Wisdom, in the Great War.’\nThe Lionheart King is strong, but it is the strength of his Holy Knights and Kingdom Knights that make up the Lionheart.\nIn the distant past, the Lord of Chaos, Malus, reduced the Lionheart King to nothing.\nIf it weren’t for that flame monster, the Lionheart King would not have survived.\n‘He is at his weakest now. Compared to his former power, he’s a joke.’\nHe must be defeated before he regains his strength.\n‘Indeed, preparations are already underway. Soon, Rakshar…will awaken.’\nThe reason she had abandoned her new slaughterhouse and headed to Korea was to support him.\n“Archduke!”\nIt was then that the demon butler, a lowly demon in the castle, rushed into Akasha’s room.\n“What’s going on?”\n“They’re here! They’ve come to the front of the castle!”\n“Kr—-”\nAkasha snarled at the Lionheart King, who had marched to the front of her castle.\nShe didn’t know what he did, but he opened the gates and invaded her territory.\nHe was definitely insane, to think of coming directly into the demon realm.\n“What happened to the… support request?”\n“That, that…….”\nThe demon butler hesitated for a moment, as if to say, “I’m sorry. There were plenty of Archdemons in the nearest estates, but…….\n“They… did not… answer the call. They said that the Archduke is not worthy…….”\n“Kr–”\nThe Demon Archdukes are definitely the second most powerful beings among the demons after the Demon Lords.\nHowever, only a Demon Lord has the right to summon the Archdemons who have territories and lead the Demon Legion.\nAmong the demons of slaughter who have ‘lost their lord’, there is much confusion as to who is in command.\n‘If only it weren’t for that orc.’\nThe Lord of Slaughter and Destruction died at his hands and the Archduke herself was disembodied by the creature and has been a wanderer for the past decade.\n“Murka…that bastard.”\nLike the Lionheart King, the Orc High Khan is feared by all demons and stirs up trouble.\nIf it weren’t for him, the battle with Lionheart would have been a battle involving all the lords and demons.\n“Release…!”\n“Archduke?”\nThe butler’s head snapped up at Akasha’s suddenly loud voice and Akasha’s brows narrowed.\n‘The host bastard…….’\nIt wasn’t Akasha who had just spoken. It was her parasitic host, Chun Ji-so.\nThe host’s consciousness was awakening due to the depth of Akasha’s wounds.\n“Not good.”\nAkasha had been searching for years for the perfect host with the gift of the sword to resurrect her body.\nOf the six hosts she’s had so far, Chun Ji-so was the best, but there was a genius body with a talent beyond even Chen Ji-so.\n“Chen So-yeon. I must find her.”\nChen Ji-so’s body was no match for Leon but what about Chen So-yeon?\nIf she could take her body as a host, and fully blossom her potential with her own power…….\nOne of Akasha’s eyes flashed with greed.\n“So-yeon…run away.\nWhile a fatherly tear rolled down the other.",

      "content": "Chapter 122: The Holy Knights Siege\nWhen we think of siege warfare, we think of white-knight battles with walls, ladders, and crossed spears.\nDemons, however, are invaders of all sorts of worlds, and their armament is highly advanced, though it varies by demonic lineage.\n“Prepare to open fire!”\n“Turrets ready to fire!”\nVicious guns loom over the city walls.\nSome are similar to the modernizers of Earth’s civilizations, while others are more advanced.\nThey had no air force, but they also had cluster bombs that exploded with magic.\nIt’s a common misconception that the Gates and the battles fought within them are all about white-knuckle warfare.\nAnyone would despair in the face of such an overwhelming array of weapons.\n“What, what, cannons?”\n“What the hell is that?”\n“Artillery, it’s exploding!”\n“Shoot!”\nA barrage of demonic firepower proved too effective at the Hunters gathered in formation.\n“Ugh…!”\n“Get down!”\nHastily erected magical barriers and tanks defensive skills were only useful in small 50/50 engagements.\nIn a battle of thousands of units, it’s impossible for an individual’s exceptional strength to stop such firepower.\nSpeaking of “exceptional strength.”\n-Quack, quack, quack, quack!\nA terrible explosion rang out in all directions, drowning out the sounds of the world.\n“Huh?”\nThe Hunters couldn’t help but make dumbfounded faces as the results of the explosion were revealed.\nA brilliant light enveloped the army of over eight thousand people, including the serfs.\n“Wow…….”\n“What the…….”\nNo one was injured, not even a tan from the explosion and exposure to the fire network.\nThere is only one person capable of such a miracle. All eyes turn to Leon.\n“A knight sworn to the Holy Grail is present. How dare you violate the splendor of the Knights with mere ranged weapons?”\nLegion Holy Law <Ranged Nullification>\nApplies the power of the concept to the entire Legion. This is deceptive enough, but the Holy Knight’s army is even more vicious.\n“Lord Spinner. Beatrice.”\n-Commencing fire.\n“Let us begin lightly.”\nThe two respond to Leon’s order. Yakt Spinner and Beatrice, both Holy Knights, activated their respective powers.\n-Whoosh!\nCarapace-mounted drones scatter in all directions. Their armament includes 20 30mm grenades and 1,200 12.7mm machine gun rounds.\n-Integrated firepower=javelin deployment\nThe Yakt Spinner’ railguns and chain-guns fire at their respective targets, along with the drones.\n-Toadadadadadadadadad!\nThe fire fight between the 24 unmanned drones and the Yakt Spinner swept through the demons on the ramparts.\n‘Geh, modern weaponry is useless against the monsters inside the gate, isn’t it?’\nThe Hunter wondered, realizing that most of the weapons used by the Yakt Spinner were not that different from modern weapons.\nWith the exception of the railgun, most of Yappy’s available weapons were Earth-made modern guns.\nIf Earth weapons had worked, the Hunters would have been carrying guns, not cold weapons, or pulling tanks and self-propelled guns through the gate.\nModern weapons that can’t contain magic don’t work against monsters. That’s common sense──\n“Kaaaah!”\n“Mo, body, body, body…!”\nBut the demons on the ramparts are met with disaster and are “burned up” by the firepower.\nDozens of demons are burned to death from the heat pressure alone as the railgun blasts through the walls.\n“Hey, Lord Yappy attack is working!”\n“How did this happen?”\nThey wouldn’t know that to be a “living saint” means to be a holy being in and of itself.\nThe Yakt Spinner has been destroyed to the point where it shouldn’t be able to operate, yet it has managed to defy physical limits.\nThey are miraculous in their mere existence as living saints have the power to sanctify what they touch with their flesh.\nThus, every shell, every bullet that pours from the fuselage of the Yakt Spinner is a Holy Grenade and lesser demons burn to death on contact.\n“Wow….”\nHa-ri watched in awe, but a question suddenly occurred to her.\n“Isn’t that a ranged weapon?”\n-The bullet firing mechanism. Derived from the electromagnetic force generated by the main body. The power of the main body.\n“Isn’t that……a lie?”\n– Silence, organism.\nIt was then that the demon mages who had spotted the Yakt Spinner shouted.\n“That’s him! Shoot him!”\nThe demons aimed all their firepower at the Yakt Spinner but the brilliant light negated them all.\n“Damn it!”\nThe demons make a wailing sound, and with good reason.\nTheir side is forbidden to use ranged weapons at all, while the other side uses them at will.\nThe Holy Knight’s Legion imposes what they are most confident in: hand-to-hand combat, while they themselves use ranged weapons with impunity.\nThis is what made their army so vicious.\n“If ranged weapons don’t work…!”\nThe demon mage on the ramparts opened his palm and swung, and a shower of infernal fire engulfed the drone.\nA blind spot the demons had learned in countless battles with the Lionheart Kingdom.\nThey don’t recognize something like a javelin that’s thrown entirely under their own power as a “ranged weapon.”\nIn short, it’s a matter of whether the knight recognizes it as a ranged weapon or not.\n“Center your magic on him, don’t give him room to dodge, and bury the Holy Knight!”\nAnd their magic is directed at the Yakt Spinners in unison… before a black light engulfs the demonic mages that have appeared.\nGreat Magic <Destroyer’s Eye>.\nThe spells of the Magician Queen rain down on the demons.\n“What the hell is that?”\n“A barrage of Archmagic-level attacks?”\nThe crowd is overwhelmed by the black light that pierces the sky.\nThe pinnacle magician of an era and a world unleashes a phenomenal barrage of magic, but it is only one of her many tricks.\n“Take care of her!”\nHellfire rains down as the demons of slaughter and destruction use the destruction magic that they are specialized in.\nTheir offense is unparalleled among demons but the Magician Queen scoffs at their magic as if it were plastic.\n“Magic against me, how shallow.”\nShe snaps her slender fingers at the spells hurled at her and in the next moment, they’re gone.\n“Huh?”\nThe demonic mages let out a stunned sound because they had seen their magic disintegrate into elemental units and scatter.\nIt was the realm of Great Magic to nullify an opponent’s magic rather than defend against it. Even the Demons of Wisdom, the pinnacle of the magical family, could only do so after deploying at least a magic circle.\nAnd she could do that with a snap of her fingers?\nSeeing their bewilderment, Beatrice twisted the corner of her mouth.\n“My previous spells specialized in killing demons, but… I had to learn ‘torture’ because they would eventually come back to life…….”\nBlack and purple glyphs begin to form in the air as the magician queen’s holy power mingled with the concept of death.\n“More death. More tribute. Woe to those who survive. For I know a thousand ‘plays’ to torment you.”\nHaving lost her country, her people, and her knights, the queen is always filled with rage against evil.\nIt’s just that, true to her character, that rage is very cold and bitter.\nA fog of death sweeps through the castle, cursing the surviving demons to wish they were dead.\nThe demonic mages groan and let go of their wands as the waves of mist plunge them into eternal rest at the mere touch.\n“Archduke…Your Excellency!”\nThe legions are swept away but watching them fall asleep, the Magician Queen feels sorry for them because they died too easily.\n‘But apart from that, I didn’t kill as many as I thought I would.’\nHer spell had lost its power halfway through and Beatrice realized it was a function of the castle.\n‘Defenses to scatter the enemy’s magic… something like that, I suppose.’\nIn a world where magic was widespread, it was a necessary facility.\nThe Demon Castle was well prepared in that regard but…what about ‘overwhelming physical force’?\n“Stand back.”\nThe golden knight flashed his spear, splitting the group of hunters and serfs in half.\nIt’s not a time for the Lionheart King to step up, but Leon is considerate of the Hunters, who are vulnerable in the siege.\n“This king will breach the gates. Prepare to push right through.”\n“Yes?”\n“Your Majesty, wait!”\nThe Korean and Japanese Hunters were stunned, and rightly so, for the gate Leon was about to charge through was a giant, nearly 100 meters across.\nA short charge against the gates of a demonic castle that could only be opened by the power of magic, or even worse, something out of a fantasy movie?\nBut Stallion’s hooves had already pounded the ground.\n“Ugh!”\n“He’s out of the barrier range!”\nThat means he’s out of the Legion Laws that Leon himself had placed on the Legion and demonic firepower rained down on the Lionheart King.\n“Ha…! Stallion, shall I unfold the Holy Law for you?”\n-Heh!\nStallion shrugged off Leon’s question. Stallion glances at the guns and cannons raining down on them and slams his foot on the ground.\n-Bang! Boom!\nThe barrage of firepower was dizzying. But Leon and Stallion ran through the rain of firepower like it was a storm.\n“What!?”\n“How is that possible?”\nThey made acrobatic moves but the most amazing thing was that it didn’t slow down in the slightest while performing such acrobatic maneuvers.\nMisplaced firearms and brute force were unable to injure the two beings in the slightest, and the tip of the spear was pointed at the gate.\n“Glory to the Lionheart…!”\nThe holy spear with its dense holy power smashed into the gate. At that moment──\n-Kaaaah!!!\nThe entire gate bursts open as it is pierced.\nThe aftermath of being physically pierced through the strongest and thickest gate caused the entire gate to collapse.\n“What the…….”\nIt’s not just the demons who turn blue in disbelief.\nThe Hunters were also stunned by the miracle before them.\n“This is…a Holy Knight.”\nSaints who bend the laws of reality as they breathe.\nIs this heavenly realm truly within the reach of humans?\nAt the overwhelming sight of a siege by just three people they naturally sought a god.\nThe gods they worship must be the true gods.\n* * * *\nThe gates were breached in an instant and the castle was about to fall to the tide of the incoming allied forces.\n“──”\nAkasha remained silent despite the tumultuous situation outside with the demon sword in his hand… Akasha’s body seemed to be sensing something with his cold gaze.\nThe only thing that could turn this situation around. If there was at least a way to get away from him or hurt him…….\n“Found it.”\nA group of people break through the inner wall, and among them is Chun So-yeon.\nAkasha dives straight for Chun So-yeon with the body of Chun Ji-so at her side. Using the demon sword’s flying ability, she leapt in front of her in an instant, causing Chun So-yeon to be startled.\n“You…!”\n“Stupid.”\nOne of Chun So-yeon’s two swords rushed towards her but Akasha simply parried her sword and grabbed her by the throat.\n“Ugh…!”\n“You’re foolish to go on a rampage alone.”\n“Give me…my father back!”\nEven as Akasha choked her, Chun So-yeon struggled but it was like a cornered mouse trying to bite a cat’s tail.\n“By taking you, I will become more complete.”\n“Why… why would you want someone like me…….?”\nAkasha could tell her more about the secret of the demon sword but she didn’t. She was a practical person, and she had no time to waste.\nShe forcefully twisted Chun So-yeon’s wrist, causing her to lose her grip on the sword and forcing the demon sword into her hand. At that moment, Akasha’s will began to dominate her instantly.\n“K-k-k-k-k-k-k-k.”\nThe corners of Chun So-yeon’s mouth twisted viciously. On the other hand, Chun Ji-so, who was losing Akasha’s magical energy, trembled with parched lips.\n“Ah, no. No… So-yeon…….”\nHis cries did not reach his daughter as Akasha looked around her new body and smiled.\n“So-so, so good. If only I could have grown up like this.”\nOver the years, the Wandering Demon Sword had pursued countless genius swordsmen.\nThere was one reason she had spent so many decades traveling from host to host: to squeeze out the bodies of his hosts and duplicate their swordsmanship.\nThe first demon, James Spencer, was a master of formal, heavy swordsmanship,\nAndrea Shaikh, the second, was the pinnacle of stabbing, arguably the best on the planet.\nThe dagger skills of Ortega the Third, and the two-bladed skill of the fourth, Samrin.\nThe swift sword of Javier the Fifth Demon Swordsman and the broadsword of the 6th Demon Chun Ji-so\nThe accumulated swordsmanship of all those demons and the essence of the magick that had eroded her six victims was all in order to restore Akasha’s lost body and resurrect her as the strongest magical swordsman.\n“Though I have lost my essence, I have gained a new body.”\nShe’ll have to start over, but it didn’t matter. The swordsmanship she had accumulated so far remained with her.\n“Let’s get him out of the way.”\n“That won’t work.”\n“──!!!”\nIt was then that a voice was heard from behind Akasha’s back.\n“Lionheart.”\nThe Lionheart King was staring straight at Akasha. To be precise──\n“Let’s end this quickly, you filthy parasite.”\nAt the violet trinket that was in Chun So-yeon earlobe.",

      "content": "Chapter 123: Parasite\nUpon entering the Demon Castle, Yong-wan sniped at the high-ranking demons.\nNormally, an archer’s primary role in a raid is to snipe enemy ranged classes.\nHowever, thanks to Leon’s Legion Law, ranged weapons don’t work on this side, which can be used without a circle.\nIn this vicious imposition of white-knuckle warfare, archers naturally limit their targets.\nPah-pah!\nEnchanted arrows are no match for medieval archery. Especially for an S-class Hunter like Lee Yong-wan, each arrow is like a tank cannon.\n“Kuwahhhhhhhhhh!!!”\nThe demonic beast continues to run silently after being bombarded with arrows. It was a Blood Minotaur, a high-level demon.\n“Failed to stop it! It’s charging straight through!”\n“What the…!”\nKnowing the terrifying breakthrough power of the beast infantry, Yi Yun fired another arrow, but he was unable to stop the Blood Minotaur, which crouched low and charged at full speed.\n‘Damn it, I need to get to the front and make sure I hit it!’\nUncharacteristically for an archer, he rushed to the front, hoping to make a clean kill of the enemy shock troops.\nHowever, in a battlefield where thousands of troops are clashing, even an S-class Hunter can’t easily take the lead.\n‘We’re late!’\nThat’s when Yong-wan realized that the Hunters in the lead were about to be torn apart.\n“Shields up!”\nA man’s voice rang out from the front and the voices that followed chorused in unison.\n“”Shields up!””\nThe shields are raised in an instant.\nThe Man-At-Arms of the TTG Guild, including leader Kim Do-han, raise their shields in an orderly fashion.\nThe leading soldiers are sent flying backwards by the impact of the Blood Minotaur, but that’s all.\n“Hold on…!”\nThe Blood Minotaur’s charge only pushed back the leading infantry, but it didn’t do its job of breaking through the formation.\n“Krrrr…!”\nThe demon tried to push ahead while it was already stopped. But the dozens of Hunters in the back row push each other’s backs with their shields and hold on.\n“Good job!”\nIt was then that a series of horses, galloping through the complex, broke through the demons’ flanks in an instant and a red-haired girl leapt from her horse and swung a flaming sword.\n-Crack!\nHa-ri, who had just sliced through the thick minotaur’s neck, exchanged glances with Yong-wan.\n“Aaah! Guild Leader Lee Yong-wan! Hello!”\nHa-ri greeted him with a bow and Yong-wan replied awkwardly.\n“Uh, Deputy Han.”\n“I’m in a hurry to battle, I’ll greet you later!”\nHa-ri, who had been greeting everyone in passing because of her position as a Hunter Association employee, soon mounted her horse and rode off to the next battle.\n“What are you looking at?”\nThe voice from behind him back was Ha Yuri. She was clutching a bunch of demons’ heads.\n“What are they?”\n“Demon mages. The TTG Guild reward us if we bring back a lot of supplies.”\n“…….”\nThe demon’s eyes are grotesque as he rolls his eyes at the decapitated heads. But there’s no reason to tackle them.\nIt’s been said that higher-level demons often don’t die when decapitated, so it’s best to collect as many supplies as possible.\nThey’ll probably pile them all up and burn them alive as a sacrifice.\nA tragedy that would be unimaginable to 21st century civilized people naturally comes to mind when interacting with the medieval Lion King.\n“More than that…you’re kidding.”\n“What?”\n“Hunters from the TTG Guild, most of whom are probably C-rank.”\n“Mostly B-class based on potential. In terms of performance, they’re as good as A-ranked raiders.”\nThe centerpiece of the siege was the Hunters of the TTG Guild.\n“The lower-level Hunters are simply tough, and if they’re not strong enough, they’ll use the strength of their allies to hold them off. There aren’t many who can charge head-on into that solid barrier.”\n“What we lack in offense, we make up for in special units like the Holy Knights.”\nTraditional Hunters were maxed out at 100-man raiding parties. Except for historical crises like the Black Gate, they were basically 20-man small, 50-man medium, and 100-man large.\nBut for the TTG Guild, they’re going in with a basic thousand.\nThe enormity of the TTG Guild is already on the level of an army, given that the power it has drawn is not even their total power.\nAnd the analogy was literally spot on.\nThe rigidity of a tightly organized army and the flexibility of a large pool of talent was more suited to warfare than strategy.\n‘It’s not that I didn’t think of it.’\nIt just wasn’t realistic.\nFirst of all, it would be a pain in the ass to take C- and D-level Hunters, and second of all, there would be the issue of distribution.\nHunters come to the gate for money.\nDigging for magic stones, acquiring high-value items, and putting them up for auction are the basics of a hunter raid.\nHowever, C- and D-level Hunters can’t even receive a percentage.\nAt best, it’s a per diem system, but even the lowest-ranked Hunters would rather play team leader in a lower rank gate than work for a low per diem.\n‘How the hell do they get so strong, and how do they get to be part of a group?’\nFrom what I’ve heard, they’re notorious for being fed a bunch of sugar and salt, so what makes them fight so loyally?\n“Is it religion…….?”\n“What, are you trying to join?”\n“Hmph…….”\nYong-wan was unable to answer Ha Yuri’s question so he drew his bow to clear his head.\n-Quang! Kwaaaaaaang!\n“”……………??!!”\nThe clash of spears and swords drowned out the sounds of the battlefield.\nThe Hunters and Demons who were thrusting their swords at each other a moment ago also naturally turned their gazes upwards.\n-Quang! Qua-qua-qua-qua!\nSomething is happening on the top floor in the center of the castle.\nAt first, they thought it was an artillery barrage from the Yakt Spinner or a magic bombardment from Beatrice.\nBut the frequency of the explosions is different, the volume of the explosions is different and the vibration of the pressure is different.\nCould this be done with a few railgun blasts or magic bombs? All the creatures in the castle were leading to the obvious conclusion.\nSomething is fighting.\nSomething huge, slamming furiously into each other.\n“Uh, uh, uh…….”\nThere was a shockwave so powerful that even the demons were stunned by its ferocity. They stiffened, unable to control their trembling hands.\nThe castle watchtower to the east, the beast breeding area to the west, the plaza in the center. Shockwaves came from all sides of the vast demonic castle and a powerful presence was felt in the aftermath.\nAll living beings in the area can only stare in disbelief.\nIt’s an instinctive realization.\nNo more advances,\nNo more retreat,\nThis is what happens when a whale fights a shrimp.\n“Heh, heh, heh…….”\n“Running away…!”\n“Don’t make a fuss, you filthy things.”\n“”……………!!!??””\nSuddenly, without realizing it, the man is in the middle of a legion of demons.\nA sense of gravity was crushing him from the crown of his head. A bug exposed to the gaze of a top predator would have been better than this.\n‘Do, we have to run…….’\n‘But…if I move, I’ll die!’\nHe was an absolute presence, the terror of all evil species. And on the other side.\n“Ah, ah……?”\nWas a young girl, but everyone recognized her. The girl wielding the Wandering Demon Sword was unmistakably the Demon Archduke.\nAs everyone is frozen in place by the overwhelming sense of danger, the two turn to face each other. The next moment, they clashed.\n────!!!\nThe ground crunches and craters appear as the shockwave from the clashing swords sends many heads fleeing.\nThe imprints of their clashing bodies dance in the background to the sound of demonic screams.\n‘No holy law, no magic!’\n‘Pure swordplay is all that’s needed to do this?’\nIt’s like being a hobbit crushed beneath a tap-dancing giant. While everyone is marveling at this mythical battle, the two swordsmen frown in displeasure.\n‘The best flesh. Young, pure, and full of potential.’\nAkasha couldn’t be more satisfied with occupying Chun So-yeon body.\nAlthough the lack of physical blossoming was a pity, it was more than made up for it with her vast amount of magic power.\nThe most important thing is this body’s sword talent. This is something that is unparalleled among all the demons of all time.\nIndeed, the heir to the first Korean sword, the Light Sword. It seems that this family’s talent is inherited from generation to generation.\n‘Nevertheless…….’\nEven with such a supreme body, her opponents won’t fall.\nEven with all the swordsmanship she absorbed from the six great demons at her disposal, Leon somehow managed to block it.\nIs it possible?\nSwordsmanship is not without its opposites. Leon’s only swordsmanship is a straight, unidirectional steel sword. No matter how many sword techniques she uses, she can’t even reach his skin.\nQuick Sword Technique\nThe snake’s venomous fangs dizzyingly change trajectories as it stabs at Leon’s defensive stance.\nIt attempts to pierce Leon’s vulnerable chest, but the upraised blade scrapes against the pommel of his holy sword.\nThe next, Leon’s bare hand grips the blade of the holy sword.\nWhen he’s sure his palm isn’t going to be cut, he pushes the sword, forcing it downward, and slashes at her thigh with the tip of the blade.\n“Hmm…!”\nAkasha stumbled backward. Blood trickled from her thigh where the holy sword had slashed.\n“A simple swordsmanship, huh?”\nLeon used a sword of upright chivalry that has walked the path of the best of the best and the accumulated experience to change on the fly.\nHoly Knights are often called Sword Masters, but Leon is the best of them all.\n“Wow. A mere mortal, rivaling a demon in skill.”\n“Then you were misguided from the start.”\n“What?”\nAkasha’s gaze sharpens at Leon’s insult but Leon stared straight at the Archduke, who wore the shell of Chun So-yeon.\n“Two hundred years ago, you had a proper body… I don’t know how you lost it…but you’re much weaker than you were then.”\n“Of course…”\n“Parasite, it’s not the size of your strength that this king is referring to, but the skill you’ve accumulated.”\n“…….”\nAkasha looked puzzled.\nYes, surely the being she was two hundred years ago was incomparably stronger than she is now. She had once vied for the title of Lord of Slaughter and Destruction.\nBut the other side is Lionheart and in the Great War, she lost her body.\n“If you lost your body how could you not have retained your skills? Are you merely storing your accumulated skills in your body?”\n“…….”\nYes, indeed. Akasha gives the demon sword to the swordsmen of the world and leads them to their destruction.\nWhen their mortal body could no longer contain her magic, she consumed it, along with the essence of their technique.\nA sword demon that can grow endlessly, that is the essence of the Akasha.\nEssentially a spirit, she gains no experience, can’t acquire any skills are acquired and can’t grow.\n“Kkkkkk…!”\n“What’s funny?”\n“Parasite. Isn’t this why the king calls you a parasite, a fool who has seen the swords of so many swordsmen…and hasn’t learned a single sword technique of her own?”\nLeon’s sincere mockery sent Akasha into a searing rage.\n“Don’t you dare! You’re a human subject that’s only 300 years old at best!”\nThe next moment, an explosively powerful demon sword swung toward Leon. The pressure of pure power, without swordsmanship, crushed Leon.\n“You will be defeated, all evil wishes for your doom.”\n“No, this king will never be defeated.”\nThe crushing blade slowly lifts. Instead, the golden holy sword pushed Akasha back, crushing her.\n‘In a contest of strength…I lost to a human?’\nThis is her territory. Everything in this land backs her up. Then why is Leon’s sword so heavy?\nLeon said.\n“On this king shoulders are the myths of all time. The burden is unwavering justice.”‘\nJustice will not be defeated. There was no resistance Akasha could offer in the face of such a blunt declaration.\n“Ugh…!”\nShe is pushed and at this rate, she would be slashed but before the horror of death, she could only vomit out the absurdity of his existence.\n“…where does a monster like you…….”\n“Not a monster.”\nLeon stretched out the hand that held his sword as Akasha’s eyes widened.\n“The Lionheart King.”\nThe outstretched arm shattered a violet earring.\n* * * *\n“………….”\nAkasha was in endless darkness, the darkness of the abyss, without a single ray of light in sight.\nWas the faintest hint of violet the only color in this world?\n“Where am I…?”\nFor a moment, Akasha realized her voice was coming out the way she wanted it to.\nNot the unnatural voice of a parasite’s mouth, but her own voice, the first time she had ever heard it.\nBefore she could marvel at it, they appeared from the darkness.\n[Hoo hoo hoo…]\n[My avenger has kept his promise.]\nThey were a purple beauty and a sinister being with no features, only darkness but in the center of them all was a dark-haired girl.\n“Chun So-yeon…!”\nChun So-yeon interrupted her before she could even get the question out of her mouth.\n“Is that all?”\n[Yes, how could she refuse after seeing what my Leon asked her to do?]\nFle, the goddess of dreams and death, smirked.\nAs is the case with most gods, they have infinite favor and affection for Leon, and are more than willing to grant a request to borrow divine power for one of their ‘squires’.\n[The soul of a Demon Archduke, with change to spare.]\nThe God of Darkness and Vengeance was satisfied with the bargain.\n“Please let me go. I don’t want to be here for another second.”\n[Leave the rest to us, though I can hear my priestess regretting it a bit.]\n[Your priestess this time is a strange bitch, using your ‘dream’ for such a purpose.]\n[Which is why I like her all the more. Our children were rather model students.]\nAmidst the chatter of the gods, Akasha realized that she was being completely ignored and her anger was directed at Chun So-yeon.\n“Take me, I will give you the power to destroy and kill everything!”\n“…….”\nChun So-yeon blinked at Akasha’s near-predatory offer for a moment then extended her hand.\nThe lure of power is for everyone, as long as they’re human, they can’t resist the temptation of demons──\nHowever Chun So-yeon middle finger slowly rose, contrary to Akasha expectations.\nChun So-yeon said.\n“Go fuck yourself, you parasite.”\nWith that, she disappeared into the darkness the gods had created.",

      "content": "Chapter 124: Wrapping Up\n“We must separate her from the host’s flesh.”\nWere Leon’s words, before the siege began.\n“It’s a spirit. Unlike normal demons, it relies on its host for physicality.”\nBut if you can separate the host from the spirit, it’s not impossible to save the host.\n“Do you want to save your father, do you want to exact the right revenge?”\n“…….”\nIn response, Leon told her the best she could do, and warned her of the risks she would have to take.\n“First, you must take the sword. You will become its new host.”\n“I will.”\n“…….”\nLeon stared at So-yeon, who immediately accepted the idea of giving her body over to the demon.\n-Tap!\nHe tapped the crown of her head with his finger. It hurt a little, and moisture formed at the corners of her eyes.\n“Take care of yourself a little.”\n“……neh.”\nIt hurt, but she didn’t feel bad about it since she knew it was out of kindness.\n“Anyway, keep these earrings on.”\n“What is this?”\n“It’s a Stardust Earring that contains the power of dreams. I made them as a gift for the cadets.”\nIt was Beatrice who revealed the earrings’ identity. The Magician Queen and the High Priestess of Dreams and Death, explained that she had blessed them with her powers.\n“They were originally meant to protect the cadets’ mental barriers, as there are many demons that can interfere with their minds.”\nBeatrice had fought countless demons and repelled them so she knew demons that lead humans astray are particularly adept at mental seduction.\n“It’s designed to protect the mind and catch the enemy in a reverse trap. It has worked well against the demons of corruption in the past.”\nBeatrice didn’t bother to mention how she’d dealt with a demon who’d taken over her mind, or what she could do with the power of dreams.\n“Here’s the plan. First, you show weakness, and then she takes over.”\n“And it just triggers at that moment?”\n“It’s not that easy. Even though she’s weakened, she’s an Archdemon. If I cast the spell from the front, she’ll counter it.”\nSo Leon fights the beast, drains it of its strength, and in its moment of exhaustion, she unexpectedly detonates the Stardust Earring, releasing its power once and for all.\n“If you fail, you will become the host of a vicious creature, and then this king will have to cut you down.”\n“……I won’t resent you if that happens.”\nChun So-yeon hardened her resolve. She was willing to risk her life for true revenge.\n“But this… I’m not throwing my life away. I believe in Your Majesty, and I know you’ll win.”\nAt that, Leon chuckled, then stroked So-Yeon’s hair.\n“Of course.”\nWith his back to the child, the Lionheart King speaks.\n“Trust in the greatness of the Lionheart King and follow him, for he will always bring you victory.”\nLooking at his back, Chun So-yeon was convinced that he was destined to win before the battle even started.\n* * * * *\nThe battle was over.\nWith Demon Archduke Akasha defeated, the demons’ resistance was futile.\nLeon has decapitated many of the top demons.\n[Quest Complete: You have defeated the Demon Archduke of Slaughter Akasha.]\nThe conditions for closing the Gate have been fulfilled. Before the gate closes, Hunters from both Japan and Korea begin to scour the castle, their eyes lit up.\n“Take it all! Take everything that’s worth anything!”\n“Oh my God, how much is this! Take one more!”\nThe treasures and riches in Akasha castle were immense.\nTreasures and gems from all over the world, priceless weapons and spellbooks, loot that would have set the world ablaze, but Beatrice and Yakt Spinner restrained them.\n-Wishing to inspect all the loot.\n“In case there are any dangerous items, His Majesty will purify them, so please cooperate.”\nOf course, among the many treasures, there are dangerous things.\nKnowing of the existence of demonic swords that parasitize humans, the hunters obeyed the order.\n“Your Majesty, what should we do with the captives?”\nHa Yuri of the Firebird Guild approached, smirking as she held up the 37 demon heads ‘certified’ by the Yakt Spinner.\n“You’ve been quite active.”\n“Yes.”\nThe castle square was filled with captive demons. Some of them were like the ones Ha Yuri presented to Leon and had their necks or upper bodies cut off, but surprisingly, many of them were still alive.\n“I’ll kill you, you humans!”\n“You think you can invade the Demon Realm and get away with it!”\n“All the legions will come for this place!”\nThe demons were fierce and some of them were still confident since they were immortal.\n“We will be resurrected and lead you to your destruction──”\n“Shut up, you demon!”\nThe demon, pierced from head to toe by Leon’s spear, was skewered along with the innocent demons behind him. It was instant death.\n-Ehhhhhhhhhhhh!!!\nAnd something gurgled and screamed out of the mutilated demons.\nIt was a terrible guttural sound that sounded like pain, agony, and screams, until it was absorbed by the Holy Grail.\n-Holy Law!\n-Holy Knight!\nThe demons realized their fate through him, which is why, even in their captivity, they rose to their feet.\n“Han Ha-ri.”\n“Yes…Your Majesty.”\nAt Leon’s command, Ha-ri snapped her fingers, and a massive wave of seawater poured out of thin air. It engulfed all the demons and locked them into a cube-shaped sea.\n-Woof! Woof!\n-Breathe…! Save me!\nThe demons’ struggles were clear even in the sea water. But the next moment, Jae-hyuk raised his spear high.\n-Thud! Quack!\nThe lightning of Ultima, the God of the Sky and Thunder, struck.\nThe demons were instantly electrocuted through the water. Some died instantly, some survived.\n“Lord Spinner will take care of the rest.”\nThe mechanical spider of steel shifted its legs, heading for the demons in the pile of corpses. The killing machine sliced every living demon to pieces with its wire.\nNone shall survive.\nAs the cries and screams of the demons echo, the blond youth inhales as if savoring it.\n“What a sweet sound.”\n-……Scary.\n-I admit it.\nOf course, to the onlookers, it was a carnage. It’s just that the opponent is a demon, so no one can argue.\n“Your Majesty.”\n“Takeda, what is it?”\n“Congratulations for your victory. Thanks to the Holy Knights, our losses were less than a thousand… no, less than fifty.”\n“Hmm, you Japanese elite have worked hard too so this king will reward you for your valor.”\nIt was a clear display of superiority, but Takeda said nothing. Being a nominally equal Hunter commander was purely for domestic propaganda purposes.\n“We’ll have to return soon. This gate is part of the Demon Realm. It will not go away unless we close it from the other side.”\nAnd that meant there might be other demons watching and coming for them but Leon has no intention of taking on the Demon Realm with his current forces.\nThat was how the unprecedented event of the Demon Archduke Extermination, which had begun with the Wandering Demon Sword Landing, ended.\n* * * *\nFour years ago, in Ulsan, Chun Ji-ho took up the demon sword on behalf of his daughter.\nHe has no regrets about that choice and although he had killed her with his own hands, his wife would think the same.\nBut in the four years since he became its host, he has lived in terrible pain.\nHe’s killed fellow Hunters who attacked him, and he’s killed countless others as his killer instinct dictated.\nAt the end of it all, he almost saw his own daughter do the same to him.\nHis heartbreak was averted… by a dazzling golden saint that freed her from the terrible sword.\n“Ah…….”\nAnd like this.\n“So-yeon…….”\n“Daddy?”\nHe let him hold his daughter again.\n“Daddy!”\nIn a hospital in Tokyo, Japan, in a single room with a bouquet of flowers, Chun Ji-ho held his daughter for the first time in four years.\n“Daddy, Daddy…Daddy…….”\nThe weight of the tight embrace was nothing like it was four years ago. He realized how much she had grown, and felt guilty that he hadn’t been there for her all those years.\n“It’s…over…it’s over, it’s okay.”\n“Yes… it’s over.”\nThe father and daughter held each other for a while, feeling the afterglow for a long time.\n“What are we going to do now?”\n“I’ll… find a way to apologize.”\nChun Ji-ho remembered everything he had done while his body was under the demon’s control.\nHe also remembered the anguished cries of all the demons before him…….\n“I’ll go to the TTG Guild…and see if I can find a way to help him.”\n“Uh, that’s not possible…….”\n“So-yeon?”\nJi-ho tilted his head at his daughter’s answer, wondering if he had misheard her.\n“I’ve already been chosen by the gods, and I’m allowed to use their power, so you should go back to the guild. Go and reclaim your place as the guild’s heir.”\n“How can I…….?”\n“I’ll be at the Ten Thousand Gods Guild so you go and get the support of the Divine Sword Guild for your successor.”\nHe wasn’t wrong.\nNow that Chun Ji-so would become the guild leader, Chun So-yeon was the only one in his direct line, so she was the natural successor.\nChun Ji-so should have been the next in line but for some reason, his daughter’s extremely logical argument felt selfish.\n“Dad, you should go back and take succession lessons from Grandpa. I’m sure you’ll do a great job.”\n“Well, okay, but… is that it?”\n“That’s all?”\nHer voice was calm, but her pupils clearly fluttered.\n‘I’m back.’\nWhat on earth was the point of separating from her dad after four years?\nChun Ji-ho had to swallow a bitter feeling.\n* * * *\nLeon was waiting at the door of Chun Ji-ho’s hospital room to enter.\nThere’s nothing romantic about a father-daughter reunion after a long absence.\nWhile waiting for the father-daughter reunion, an old man approached from the hallway.\n“Your Majesty the Lionheart King.”\n“Is your son sick?”\n“Yes, sir. He’s been here for days.”\nIt was Chun Jin-soo, the guild leader of the Divine Sword Guild. He is the father of Chun Ji-ho and the grandfather of Chun So-yeon.\n“So, what brings your Majesty here?”\n“I need to take care of some business.”\nLeon came to check on Chun Ji-ho, who had once been the host of the demon sword.\nWithin his body, the swordsmanship and souls of previous generations of demons were etched.\nIt’s hard to call it a soul, it’s more like a worn out spirit, but in this world, it would be difficult for anyone other than himself to purify it.\n“Indeed, there are other souls of demon swordsmen.”\n“That is a task for the right priest, but unfortunately, there are few priests in this world who can guide souls.”\n“…….”\nChun Jin-soo moved a little closer to Leon and slowly the stiff back, like an old tree, bowed.\n“I am grateful. My son is blessed, my granddaughter is blessed. The entire family has seen your grace.”\nGuildmaster of the Divine Sword Guild and Korea’s first swordsman, and strongest hunter Chun Jin-soo is a brute of a man, walking around with a stiff back from a lifetime of service.\nBut he doesn’t mind bowing down to this young man in front of him.\n“If there is anything I can do to help, I will.”\n“There is only one thing I ask of you.”\nLeon asked only one thing of this man, a man of, no chivalry and no nobility.\n“Be alert to the stirrings of evil, and hate it. That will be the first step in protecting the world.”\n“That’s… obvious.”\n“Countless worlds have perished because they failed to do the obvious. Do not take lightly the sweet lure of the demons.”\n“…….”\nImmediately after the killing spree ended, Chun Jin-soo learned everything about this man.\nFrom the YouTube videos he’d never seen, from information compiled by government officials, and from his old friend Oh Kang-hyuk, the president of the Association.\nWhat he learned about Leon was a history of endless war.\nHe was the only survivor left in his world and the last bastion against demons for centuries.\nHis unforgiving hands are a testament to how long he’s been fighting.\nEven as an otherworldly, medieval, fantasy, classist knight-king his power over evil deserves respect.\n“Very well! I will serve you as my brother from now on!”\n“What?”\nLeon was taken aback by Chen Jin-soo’s words, which he hadn’t expected at all.\n“In our world, there’s a type of relationship called the Dao Yuan Resolve, in which a brotherhood is formed for the sake of a great cause! Your Majesty shall be the elder brother.”\n“Hehe…….”\nLeon found this brash old man’s words to be ridiculous, but he didn’t feel bad about it, as it was enough to make him laugh out loud.\n“Your status is far too low to be a half-brother to this king.”\n“I’m the 37th generation of the Chun clan, and my family was a noble family in the Goryeo Dynasty and a great family in the Joseon Dynasty. I was a nobleman.”\nChun Jin-soo argued that a prestigious family in the Joseon Dynasty would be noble by medieval standards.\n“In the future, I will cooperate with you in anything related to the demons. If my brother and I join forces, the demons will not dare to invade this land!”\n“Convert and embrace the faith. Anyone who has the faith of all gods is a brother or sister to this king no matter who they are.”\n“Isn’t brother’s range a bit wide?”\nChun Jin-soo said as he patted his chest mockingly.\n“Don’t worry. I’ll make sure to convert every single member of our guild, and if I count our affiliates, it’ll be quite a few!”\nIt was a bit unexpected to be promised Chun Jin-soo support, but it couldn’t hurt. He might be old, but his strength was higher than a Kingdom Knight.\n‘If he can fulfill his quests well, he might be able to take a shot at becoming a Holy Knight.’\nOf course, that would be if he realized the right faith.\nLeon left the hospital to leave family’s have some alone time for a while, looking forward to the faith he would have.\n────!!\nIt was then that the aura of a holy object fluctuated in subspace but it was not a holy sword, a holy spear, or a holy grail.\nOnly one, a holy object with a ferocity that was quite unrestrained and brutal.\n“Come.”\nA subspace opens, and a book falls from it.\nIt was a thick volume, well-tanned and of fine leather, showing signs of handcrafting.\nThe title, etched into the leather of its cover, is in an otherworldly language that only one person on this planet can read.\nThe title of the book reads.\n“How to capture a giant with a serf.”",

      "content": "Chapter 125: Appointment Ceremony\nThe fame of TTG Guild has been growing day by day, but it reached its peak after the Demon Archduke was killed.\n-Wow, a guild less than half a year old cleared a Black Gate?\n-Technically, it took over 20 S-class forces from both Japan and Korea.\n-According to the TTG Guild YouTube channel, the real main force was the TTG Guild.\n-Mechanical Holy Knight Praise be to Lord Yappy!\n-Queen Beatrice Have you seen her magic? It’s so magnificent.\nWhen a Black Gate causes a dungeon break, it’s not just a country that suffers, but an entire continent.\nTTG Guild has been able to pull off this black-tier capture twice.\nThe ability to artificially open and close the gate was a big deal, but it was the power of the Lionheart King that people focused on.\n-Have you seen the sea parting on Shikoku Island?\n-The sea evaporates in thunder, and the flames reach the sky. Is that a human?\n-Did you see the analysis of the battle between the Archduke and the Lionheart King? How the hell can a human move in 300 frames and not be analyzed?\nHe was a man-made disaster, a super-powered king who creates storms with his sword.\n-If that’s the Archduke, what’s the demon above it?\n-An Archdemon alone takes S-classes to capture, but an Archduke is a real monster.\n-What would we have done if it wasn’t for the Lionheart King?\nIt’s because of Leon’s presence that the people were able to feel safe even in the face of the Demon Archduke.\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart and the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods were strongly recognized in people’s minds.\nTwo weeks after the defeat of the Demon Archduke, TTG Guild announced a new event: a formal knighting ceremony.\n* * * *\nThe TTG Guild knighting ceremony caused quite a stir in the country.\nEven the monthly cadet graduation ceremony was a big deal, so the expectations for the knighting ceremony were high.\n“It’s amazing.”\nReporter Park, who came to cover the knighting ceremony at TTG Guild, was impressed by the colorful placards and the prepared venue from the entrance of the building.\nUnlike the junior reporter’s pure admiration, Kim analyzed the TTG Guild soberly.\n“They’re nowhere near the size or funding of the top ten guilds. No, it’s the new Top Ten Guild, since Hanbit has taken it upon itself to join the ranks of TTG Guild.”\n“But why would Hanbit join the TTG Guild?”\n“I don’t know. It’s the same religious organization, so they must have gotten some kind of favor.”\nTTG Guild… or rather, a survivor named Leon, has been causing trouble since he first appeared.\nHis first appearance was at an unrated gate that the Association claimed to have cleared.\nHe clashed with Lee Yong-wan of the Firebird Guild and almost single-handedly cleared the impregnable Cheongju Gate.\nSince then, the TTG Guild has been built with the full support of the Association’s president, Oh Kang-hyuk.\nThe emergence of Rakshar, the Demon Archduke of Chaos in the East Sea Gate, and Akasha, the Demon Archduke of the Wandering Demon Sword, and the power of the Lionhearted King to subdue even them.\n“It’s almost a myth in Japan, but under the new system of the Japan Hunter Association, the conversion rate to the Ten Thousand Gods religion is said to be over 80%.”\n“And the new president of the association, Mr. Takeda, is also a believer of the God of Light and Justice, right?”\nHunters who have come into contact with the Ten Thousand Gods Guild have a particularly high conversion rate, as do S-class hunters like Allen Taylor and Minuteman of the Maverick Guild in the United States.\nIs there really something that touches people?\n“Does God really exist? There are a lot of eyewitness testimonies, but they don’t show it on camera, so I want…….”\n“Even though all the religious organizations in Korea deny it.”\nTTG Guild is ostensibly a large hunter guild, but it is actually a strictly religious organization.\nIt is an emerging religious force centered on a leader called the Lionheart King who claims all sorts of pseudoscientific things.\nThe rooted religious communities in Korea…especially the Protestant Alliance, seem to deny the existence of a pantheon of gods, but there is too much evidence of an actual god.\n“The blessed crops are too good to be merely superior magical skill.”\nThe fall harvest season is upon us, and the blessed crops centered on the Naju Plain have produced a bumper crop and are being prepared to supply the entire country.\nBut is it enough? Formerly neglected land contaminated with miasma, such as the Beidahuang Great Plain and Ukrainian black soil, is being reclaimed by farmers who worship Demera, the goddess of earth and fertility.\n“I even heard that most of the profits go to the TTG Guild because of a religious law called the Ten Commandments? No matter how religious you are, the ten rules are a bit…….”\n“Apparently, the land of the farmer whose profits were taken in the middle dried up immediately.”\nIt’s only been half a year, and although it hasn’t been in full swing yet, it is said that the operating fund of the TTG Guild will be the size of a city.\n“It’s like a medieval knighting ceremony for that kind of money.”\nThe junior reporter was also unfamiliar with such an unbalanced organization.\n“A cadet graduation is one thing, but do you know what a knighting ceremony is? It’s a knighting ceremony in the 21st century.”\n“Isn’t it a bit more advanced than a graduation ceremony?”\nThe TTG Guild cadet graduation ceremony is famous.\nIt raises hunters from the lowest class to at least Class C. and it’s the first of its kind.\nNot only that, but these Hunters are trained and educated to be thorough group warfare masters, and their group combat power is no less than that of a B-class raiding party.\nTheir group combat power has already been proven in the defeat of the Demon Archduke.\nHunters who have gone through the training process of the TTG Guild are no longer hunters, but ‘soldiers’.\n“The Knight Cadets are the next level up from those soldiers. In short, officers. Given the medieval doctrine and the title of knight…….”\nThe knights are the centerpiece of the pantheon, the so-called high-class soldiers.\nAnd today would be the day that the knights would be sworn in as the core of the pantheon.\nReporter Kim looked toward the center of the venue but unlike usual, there were no tourists because of the ceremony.\nThe venue is a huge training center that has recently been expanded.\nThe private property was expanded to accommodate the large-scale training of more than a thousand Man-At-Arms. It seems that everyone related to Man-At-Arms has gathered there.\n-Chirp! Chirp!\n-Chirp!\nYappy organizes everyone in an orderly fashion, while Kim Do-han from Man at Arms, Kim Jin-soo from the association, Choi Young-gam from Naju Plain Agricultural Development, and so on.\nIn the midst of such a large group of TTG Guild officials, there was one group that stood out like a sore thumb──\n“What is that, senior?”\n“……Slaves?”\nThe serfs were carrying materials in shackles.\nThey were the demon followers captured in Akasha territory and were being used as excellent laborers for the TTG Guild.\n-Move it.\n-Screech!\n-Quack!\nThe sight of them being whipped relentlessly by overseers who appear to be mechanical spiders and hunter-gatherer warriors makes them wonder if this is really 21st century South Korea.\n[TTG Guild Disregarded Human Rights! Slavery Controversy Intensifies!]\nThis will be one of the headlines tomorrow, but I doubt the Lionheart King will care.\nRegardless, the knighting ceremony went on as scheduled.\n* * * *\n“Whoa…….”\nHa-ri nervously took her seat.\nThe chairs in the front row in front of the dais where Leon would stand were the seats of those who would be officially recognized as knights at the knighting ceremony of the TTG Guild.\nHa-ri herself, Han Soo-ho, Kim Jae-hyuk, Chun So-yeon, and seven others sit there.\nThe only thing they have in common is that they can use the Holy Law, and they’ve passed Leon’s threshold.\n“That’s not as many as I thought, sister.”\n“Well…they’re officially recognized as Kingdom Knights, but I’m sure they’ll catch up.”\nSoo-ho and Jae-hyuk were also de facto Class A hunters. Considering that they were only B-rank just a few months ago, that’s a lot of progress.\nAnd this is true for the other cadets as well. The cadets who have initiated the Holy Law are confirmed to be Class A. The rest are at the top of the B class.\nConsidering that the number of cadets who have awakened to the Holy Law is increasing one after another, the cutoff for knights of the TTG Guild will be Class A.\n“Still, junior Chun So-yeon is incredible. Wasn’t she evaluated as a quasi-S rank by the Association this time?”\n“Not as much as you, senior. S-class evaluation, congratulations.”\n“Hehe…It’s not official yet.”\nHa-ri and So-yeon were the highest-ranked cadets in this promotion.\nHa-ri, who was the youngest A-class hunter, was set to become the youngest S-class titleholder after the Demon Archduke’s annihilation, and So-yeon, who was temporarily linked to the Archduke of Slaughter, Akasha, had also made progress.\n“Ah, the king and queen are coming up.”\n“And Lord Yappy.”\nThe installation ceremony began as the officers of the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods stood on the dais and everyone fell silent as if they had made a promise.\n“I am the Lionheart King.”\nLeon opened his mouth. It was a clichéd introduction, but the reporters’ camera shutters clicked.\n“I am the First Knight of Arianna, Goddess of Light and Justice, and I execute the will of the pantheon. Which means…”\nLeon saw many faces focused on him.\nThe knight cadets and soldiers he’d trained for months to follow him, and the civilians of the world who had endless questions and curiosities about this pantheon.\nToday, Leon would proclaim to them what it means to be a knight.\n“Let me tell you, the country, nay, the world, is on the wrong path these days.”\nThe crowd stirs but not a single one can speak up since the Lionheart King authority does not permit it.\nThe cameras zoom in and the screen goes live, broadcasting the Lionheart King speech.\n“Evil races are uniting and eagerly targeting this world. You have seen the world destroyed by them.”\nCheongju Gate.\nThe Fluctuation Gate.\nThe East Sea Gate and the territory of Akasha, the Archduke of Slaughter.\nDemons were involved in the Shanghai disaster and the London tragedy.\nSuspicions were crystallizing that the gates were a bridgehead for a demonic invasion.\n“But when this king arrived on earth, he surveyed the world, and found that the strong were at peace, and the weak at ease, even as the promised doom approached.”\nLeon recognized that this world was not weak.\nWhile they may not have the brute force of a Holy Knight at their peak, S-class Hunters are powerful in their own right.\nThere are many hunters and many people but there was a crucial difference between them and the Lionheart Kingdom.\nLoyalty, conviction, and honorable duty.\n“Evil will come to you, soon to show its true colors and bring ruin to the world. Who will protect the common people, who are forced to live within the hedges of the strong, who will take on this duty?”\nLeon looked around at the Men-At-Arms. They were soldiers, faithful men. It is their duty to serve with loyalty and valor.\nBut it is not enough, they need someone to lead them, to be a paragon of valor.\n“A knight. Knights will protect the people. They will protect the world.”\nThe Knight.\nA rider on horseback.\nA man trained for war all his life.\nIn the modern age, they have become anachronistic tales, but the Lionheart King speaks earnestly.\n“Han Ha-ri, stand on the dais.”\n“Yes…!”\nThe first to be called was a dangling-haired girl.\nA young knight, just coming of age, but no less talented than anyone else.\nShe knelt before Leone on one knee and drew her sword, placing it in her palm.\n“Han Ha-ri, you have proven your valor, borne the karma of battle, and earned the approval of the gods. Therefore, I hereby swear you in as a knight.”\nHa-ri looked at the sword in her hand.\nStardust, her own sword, blessed by the gods.\nLeon recited an oath worthy of such a sacred weapon.\n“Be courageous and do good.”\n“Speak only the truth, and never compromise your convictions in the face of death.”\n“Protect the weak, do no injustice.”\n“Die for noble ideals, do not be ashamed to right wrongs.”\n“Love with purity and good will. Do not give in to the impossible.”\n“Have faith, reach for the stars.”\n“For it is your calling.”\n“You are a knight of the Lionheart.”\n“Thou art the goddess of the sea and the waves.”\n“Horseman of war and flame.”\n“Wilt thou accept thy duty, knight?”\nHa-ri felt the heaviness of all those duties and virtues. She knew they were not light.\nThe knight before her was proof of that.\nShe knew the sacrifice that Holy Knight Georgic had made.\nAnd heard of Holy Knight Jerea’s convictions.\nShe witnessed the fierce power of Holy Knight Vulcanus.\nThe chivalry now imposed upon her was to follow in the footsteps of those paragons.\nHan Ha-ri understood this well enough, and sincerely chose to emulate their virtues.\n“Yes, Your Majesty, I accept.”\nThe moment she did, the back of Leon’s hand slapped her hard across the cheek.\nHer mouth was torn open, blood trickled down, and her cheek was tattered but strangely, Ha-ri wasn’t flustered.\n“It’s a reminder that you must value your calling and your duty above your life.”\n“Yes!”\nHa-ri’s turn was over and after her, So-yeon, Jae-hyuk, Soo-ho…and several other cadets were sworn in as official Kingdom Knights.\n“Wow, they’re giving me a cloak, so I’m a noble now, or something. Do I still have to pay taxes?”\nWhen Jae-hyuk asked about the tax exemption using Earth’s common sense, Yappy slapped him across the cheek with a wire.\n-Pitiful creature.\n“Eh.”\nThere was no such thing as tax exemption, even for knights but there were other rewards for the remaining knights.\n“The following thirty-two knights will be rewarded with a golden seal and a free meal ticket.”\n-Goodbye sugar and salt water!\n-I’m going to get a hamburger!\nIt was a frenzied moment.\nUnlike the Man-At-Arms, who are officially soldiers after completing the ceremony and are freed from the evil sugar brine, the knight cadets had been eating sugar brine the whole time.\nThe only good thing was that they were fed properly when they captured the gate, so they actively participated in the actual training.\nAnyway, with the knights’ reward in hand, Leon delivered his final message.\n“The cadets of the first class will be grouped together to form a Knight Order. Han Ha-ri, Han Soo-ho, Kim Jae-hyuk, and Chun So-yeon will be candidates for the officer positions, but I will select the leader and vice leader through command practice.”\nIn short, he was going to appoint an interim commander to lead the knight cadets that Leon had been leading up to this point.\n“How will that be done?”\n“Maybe some sort of test?”\nThe four candidates for command soon found out.\n“……Chief Kim Jin-soo, what is this?”\nHa-ri stared at Kim Jin-soo, the Association’s senior supervisor who organized the gates.\n“It’s an orange gate, but it’s been cleared out and only the field bosses are left. I had to go through a lot of trouble to get this.”\nNo, I know that. They were alone in the vast gate plain.\nTo be precise five hundred people stood in front of the four candidates: Han Ha-ri, Han Soo-ho, Kim Jae-hyuk, and Chun So-yeon.\nAll in torn robes, skinny bodies with bony bones and all they held was a broken dagger no more than 15 centimeters long.\nBefore them, Leon said.\n“From now on, you will hunt giants with serfs.”\nThis was King Lionheart, talking nonsense from the morning breeze.",

      "content": "Chapter 126: How to Catch a Giant with Serfs\n“Catch… what?”\n“I told you to catch a giant.”\n“”?????””\nThe group is filled with questions and even the serfs seem to wonder what they heard.\n“You… you mean… you want us to…catch the giants who are the field bosses here?”\nThe orange gates are held by the Association.\nThis gate is used to train players to defeat raid bosses, as it contains powerful, high-value drops such as giant skin and nails.\nHowever, because the giant is so powerful, only the Association’s elite raiders, who are at least Class B and Class A, can come here for training.\nHa-ri knows how powerful these giants are, having been here as a rookie.\nThey reach a base height of eight meters, and their weapons are nothing more than bats, but they are the size of a hundred-year-old tree.\nWith a single blow of his club, the serfs will die by the dozen.\nA field boss of at least Class A was a target that normally requires multiple raiders to raid and it is impossible to solo unless you are an S-rank Hunter.\n“Oh, so you’re going to distract them with serfs and then see how we handle them?”\n“No, it should only be slayed by serfs.”\n“But……they only have daggers?”\n“The literature says they were slayed with daggers.”\nHow?\nTo the four questioning knights, Leon flipped through a leather-bound book as carefully as he would a sacred text.\n“The Holy Knight, Sir Gratas, in his book, ‘How to Slay a Giant with Serfs,’ says that five hundred serfs armed with daggers are sufficient to slay a giant.”\n‘Five hundred were enough?!’\nHa-ri and the knights understood Leon’s nonchalant demeanor.\n‘His Majesty doesn’t care if all the serfs die!’\nEven if the serfs’ combat strength was high, they were still D-class Hunters. No matter how many D-class Hunters they gathered, there was no way they could win against a giant A-class Field Boss.\n“Don’t judge beforehand. This king isn’t doing this with the intention of killing all the serfs. Lord Gratas actually captured the giant with only five hundred serfs.”\n“And how many were killed?”\n“About three hundred.”\n“Well, well, look at that, what a carnage!”\nThree hundred out of five hundred died. The serfs’ complexions turned pale as they listened, but Leon didn’t care.\n“Who cares about the lives of serfs?” he said.\n“Well, I do care, don’t you?”\n“Uh, senior Ha-ri, I’m um…….”\nJae-hyuk wanted to say, “Why are you including us?” but the idea of a suicide mission that required the sacrifice of three hundred out of five hundred was unacceptable to him.\n“I don’t care.”\n“Chun So-yeon?!”\nEveryone turned their heads in astonishment at Chun So-yeon who had a cynical expression\n“His Majesty must have meant something. Since they’re demon followers, why not kill a few of them?”\n“No, no…! But oh……!”\nHa-ri was frozen in place by her junior’s callousness.\n“Your Majesty… you mean something deep, don’t you?”\nHan Soo-ho asked since he knew that this barbaric, seemingly discriminatory classist words always had a deep meaning.\nWas there something they didn’t know this time?\n“No, this king wants to recreate the legendary Serf Challenge of Lord Gratas.”\n“”…….””\nSelflessness Lv. MAX.\nHe’s not particularly interested in keeping the serfs alive, turning them into powerhouses, or making them useful.\nOoh, a serf slaying a giant? That’s a bit of a feat, huh? I’ll have to give it a try.\nThe white plantation owners who forced their black slaves to fistfight would have been better than this.\nAt least they didn’t throw them to the monsters to die.\n“Your Majesty…….”\nHa-ri made a sad face at Leon’s stern demeanor.\nShe knew he hated demons but cruelty against humans was too much to bear, even in Leon’s service.\n“You gave the serfs… a chance. Fifty years to wash away their sins…….”\n“I did.”\n“Then at least… you shouldn’t have sent them to their deaths like this.”\nHa-ri is absolutely right.\nIn the warmth of 21st-century rule of law, she believed that even criminals have certain human rights.\nIf criminals are treated unconditionally and harshly, not only will they not be rehabilitated, but society will collapse. The law must be fair, impartial, and just.\nLeon knew what Ha-ri was worried about and that was also why the gods love this child because she is so pure and good.\nBut\n“A serf is not a human.”\n“Ugh…!”\nHa-ri is not convinced so Leon gestured to a serf.\n“You there, pig. Come closer.”\n“Yes, yes…!”\nThe man, trembling at being called out by Leon, was Veron, a village chief from one of the villages in the Demon World.\nHe was a man from the same world as Leon, and a former soldier in the Imperial Army so Leon asked him.\n“What sin have you committed as a human being?”\n“What? That, that…….”\nVeron hesitated to answer. But even though he didn’t want to answer, he couldn’t help but answer.\n-Gee!\n“Kaaaargh, I will answer, I will answer, I will answer!”\nAs the leash of the Tatar god of judgment burned Veron’s neck, he had no choice but to fulfill the order.\n“Murder, murder, murder!”\n“Tell me more.”\n“I murdered my wife, I murdered my daughter! I scooped up the corpses and ate them, I made human sacrifices!”\n“…….”\nVeron glanced at Ha-ri out of the corner of his eye since he could feel the cold contempt in Ha-ri’s eyes even though she pitied the serfs.\n“Tell me, which sin did you enjoy the most, what did it feel like?”\n“You’re an asshole!”\nOverhearing, Jae-hyuk kicked Veron in the face and a series of relentless beatings rained down on the fallen man.\n“…….”\nHa-ri’s eyes were sad as she watched, but there was no pity in them.\n“This king despises serfs. If I get the chance, I want them to die in agony. In some ways, I hate them even more than the devil himself. Do you know why?”\n“Why…?”\n“People who are born evil and do evil deeds or people who can be good and do evil deeds. What is more evil?”\nLeon’s words gave Ha-ri a lot to think about and she remembered the excuses Veron had given.\nThose who could have been good, but chose evil had no room for pity.\n“Behold. They are absolute evil. They are not worthy of life. Their only chance is as serfs!”\nFor they are not demons.\nThey may have committed diabolical sins, but they are not pure evil they received a chance at purification and to redeem their souls.\nThis alone is a great act of mercy.\n“Before you are put to the test, I will give you a demonstration.”\nLeon took only five hundred serfs and turned to face one of the giants.\n* * * *\nThe giant in front of him stood nine meters tall, and the club he held was as big as several men glued together.\nBeing big is itself a form of physical power. In that sense, the serfs were at a loss as to how to take down the giant.\nVeal, the bravest of them all, was at a loss.\n“Your majesty…uh, how do you expect me to take down a giant?”\nIt was a cardinal sin for a serf to dare to speak to the Lionheart King, but Leon was too busy flipping through the pages of the holy book Gratas had left him, How to Catch a Giant with a Serf.\n“Hmm… Let’s see, according to Lord Gratas’ theory…….”\n“How to capture giants with serfs”\nIf the giant’s health is said to be 3,000, then the attack power of a serf wielding a dagger is 1.\nThen.\n1,000 successful attacks will cause non-negligible bleeding,\n2,000 successful attacks and he will bleed to death.\n3000 successful attacks will surely kill it.\n“Hmm, a very intuitive and logical argument.”\nSo Lord Gratas told his serfs that they could take down a giant if each of them stabbed it at least six times.\nHaha, five hundred men can’t stab a giant three thousand times. If they can’t, they’ll die.\n“That’s right.”\n“”…………….””\nWhen he explained how to catch the giant, the serfs turned white.\nThis madman is trying to kill us!\nVeal sensed that this would not be the last time.\nOver a thousand serfs had died in the Demon World, and he hadn’t even counted them in his ‘body count’.\nWould they last fifty years? Certainly not. Veal had a flash of genius.\n‘Yeah, let’s just kill them now! It’s easier to die early!’\nRather than suffering fifty years of vicious bullying, it would be better to die now than to live a life of not knowing when you’re going to die!\n“Ooooooooooooo!”\nVeal suddenly charged at the giant, and just then, Jae-hyuk saw a system message.\n[‘How to capture giants with serfs’ grants buffs to serfs]\n-Increases Attack by 20% against giants.\n“Oooh…Increased damage for all serfs!”\nBut that 20% boost to their damage just takes them from 1 to 1.2. Of course, that was assuming the attack was successful.\n-POOF!\nVeal, who had been screaming at the top of his lungs, was instantly killed by the giant’s club. Bits and pieces of what had been Veal stuck to the giant’s club.\n“Hmm.”\nLeon realized what Veal was trying to do and tried to absorb its soul with the Holy Grail. But then──\n-Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!\nThe soul that flowed out of Veal let out a tearing scream and was quickly absorbed somewhere else.\n[‘How to capture giants with serfs’ grants buffs to serfs]\n-Gain 20.0001% increased damage against giants.\n-Buff is permanently applied on success.\nThe holy book absorbed Veal’s soul and Jae-hyuk, noticing the different buffs from before, shouted.\n“Lung, Your Majesty! It’s gone from a 20% attack buff to 20.0001%!”\n“Huh?”\n“”……………!!!!””\nWhat did those words just mean? The serfs’ survival instinct made their brains spin fast.\nOne serf died and his soul was absorbed and the buff amount increased by 0.0001%? Then where did the previous 20% come from? No way…….\n”Doesn’t it mean that he drained the blood of 200,000 people and gave them a 20% buff!!!”\n”Indeed, a holy book with mysterious powers, Lord Gratas has left behind a great treasure!”\n”It’s not a holy book, it’s a man-eating demonic book!\n“Well, now you know. Go and die.”\n“…….”\n“…….”\nIs that a slip of the tongue? No, I don’t think it’s a slip of the tongue.\nIn the midst of everyone’s dreaded quandary…someone shouted.\n“Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!”\nKill or be killed. Even if you die, your soul will be captured by that magic book!\nThen I have no choice but to kill and live!\nFour hundred and ninety-eight serfs rushed forward in unison, following the leading serf.\n* * * * *\nThe giant was captured and the damage was less than expected.\nOne hundred and forty-three people were killed by the giant’s club, but only because the serf-eating giant choked for a moment.\nAfter devouring three serfs in one fell swoop, the giant’s airway collapsed and he fell backwards, allowing the serfs to capture him with relatively little damage.\nIt was a miracle.\n[“How to Hunt Giants with Serfs” grants a buff to serfs]\n-20.0144% increased damage against giants.\n-Buff is permanent.\n-Burp!\nFor a moment, it sounded like the book had burped, but the serfs and knights dutifully ignored it.\n“Ho-ho~ A permanent buff, indeed… Lord Gratas must have gone to great lengths to create this holy book.”\nLeon worshiped the magic book made with the blood of 200,000 serfs and turned his gaze to the knights.\n“Now that I have set the example, you may try. To the one who slays the giant with the most damage…nay, the least damage, I will award the position of Knight Commander.”\n“Your Majesty, my heart is in it…….”\nThat’s when “How to Capture a Giant with a Serf” suddenly began to glow.\n“What? The system window has a new message!”\n[Holy Knight Gratas’ How to Hunt Giants with Serfs blossoms into true power]\n[Holy Knight Gratas’ ‘Serf Challenge’ generates a new table of contents]\n1. Hunt Giants with Serfs: 20.0144% increased Attack Damage (Permanent)\n2. Hunt Trolls with a Serf: 43.5668% increased damage (temporary). If successful, proceed to the next step.\n“………….”\n“………….”\nWhen everyone who wanted to look away from this horrible reality was silent, Leon slammed his palms together in disbelief.\n“How can this be, Lord Gratas, how can this be, how can this be!”\nLeon beamed like a child receiving a Christmas present.",

Dig in there!”\n“Oh, we’re here, but what are we going to do?”\n“We should hold onto a leg or something…shouldn’t we?”\n“What kind of bullshit is that──”\n-Poof!\n-Attack damage is increased by 20.0556% against giants.\nHan Ha-ri finished the hunt successfully with 88 serfs remaining.\n“Run, run, run, and dodge the clubs!”\n“Ugh, you bastard who just cursed at me, I’m going to start ripping off the giant’s burl!”\n-Attack damage is increased by 20.0934% against giants.\nKim Jae-hyuk finished the hunt successfully with 32 serfs remaining.\n“Ugh! It’s falling!”\n“Heh, heh, heh…! Uh, mom… I’m alive!”\n-Attack damage is increased by 20.1432% against giants.\nHan Soo-ho finished the hunt successfully with 2 serfs remaining.\nSomehow, they all succeeded and finally, only Chun So-yeon remained.\n“Someone died in front of you. Are you going to avenge the one behind you?”\n“Uh, um…….”\n“Tell me you’re going to get revenge.”\n“Ha, I will, I will avenge them!”\n“It says ──.”\n[Your soul is now mine]\n[Specify a target for revenge. Strengthened by consuming souls]\nChun So-yeon had strengthened the serfs by mediating with Ventasis, the God of Vengeance. These soul-devouring serfs are now strong enough to deliver a devastating blow to a giant.\nChun So-yeon finished the hunt successfully with 154 serfs remaining.\nShe was able to capture the giant with the least amount of sacrifices, 346.\n“Hmm, good. Excellent.”\nHa-ri’s serfs had somehow managed to increase their specs with buffs from the two gods, and Jae-hyuk had baffled the giant with his aggressive play.\nSoo-ho was a poor matchup, and Arianna’s buffs from the Goddess of Justice didn’t have much effect on the evil serfs.\n“Chun So-yeon, I want you to take over the position of Knight Commander.”\n“…….”\nChun So-yeon actively utilized her holy power and her contracted god.\nIf the one in front of her failed, the one behind her would avenge her. This was possible because Ventasis was an evil deity with generous contract terms.\n“Using her command over the serfs to broker revenge contracts was an efficient move.”\n“……Was it well done?”\n“Yes. Even this king admired it.”\n“It was…….”\nSo-yeon blushed and smiled faintly.\n“Han Ha-ri, you have a natural ability to give the serfs proper protection, but you lack boldness in your operations. Serfs are expendable, so use them properly for your purposes.”\n“Hmm…yes…….”\n“Jae-hyuk, your first move was impressively bold. However, there are many useless parts of your command that have caused the serfs to flail about.”\n“Hmm.. I made some mistakes.”\n“Well, that’s how you learn. The dying serfs will be saved again and again, so don’t stop practicing.”\n-Dog, asshole…….\nThe surviving serfs insulted him, but Leon paid them no mind. Who cares what a pig squeaks?\n“Han Soo-ho.”\n“Yes, yes…….”\nSoo-ho was breathless since he only had two remaining serfs. If the giant hadn’t collapsed from blood loss, he would have failed.\n“You were not a good match. A light guard is not the right guard to operate serfs.”\n“Still, I apologize──”\n“Then I will entrust you with five hundred more serfs!”\n“……Eh?”\nLeon laughed merrily as he patted Soo-ho’s shoulder.\n“In the past, when Lord Gratas planned the serf challenge, it was to efficiently reduce the number of rotten serfs. The idea was to bury the idle serfs while increasing security by dealing with the monsters around the territory.”\n“Yes……….”\n“You have a knack for burying serfs, keep up the good work!”\n“…….”\n‘I wonder if he’s actually a demon?’\nSoo-ho thought.\n* * * *\nIn the Naju Plains, in the middle of a vast golden field, where the harvest season was approaching, Leon stared at a single sapling.\n“It doesn’t grow any bigger.”\nLeon was looking at a ‘seedling’ that his old friend, the forest sage Gunnar, had given to him.\nLeon had planted it in the Naju Plain, hoping to grow it, but it never did.\nOf course, he knew it wasn’t an easy seed to grow, but he didn’t expect it to be this bad.\n[After all, it’s not easy to grow Tree Men’s seedlings in a foreign land]\nThe voice belonged to Demera, the goddess of earth and fertility, embodied in a crested doll.\nShe used to be able to communicate directly with Leon, but lately she seemed to enjoy inhabiting the crested dolls like this. Even the gods have hobbies, so Leon was happy to accommodate her.\n“Is it because the soil is of poor quality?”\n[It is not, for this place already has my blessing]\n“Then…….”\n[The difference between this place and Lionheart is, after all, the power of the world]\nThe power of the Ten Thousand Gods Temple is spreading throughout the world day by day. But it is nowhere near the level of Lionheart.\nA world where everyone believed, except for the sociopaths and demonic followers, and an emerging religion that is growing in cult-like popularity could not be compared.\n“Hmph…….”\nLeon pressed his palm to the seedling of the Treeman Gunnar that had grown to the level of a sapling and then with a burst of holy power the sapling began to grow quickly until it reached Leon’s waist.\nThat’s a lot of growth, but…….\n[It’s not enough]\n“I don’t think it’s a matter of lack of holy power.”\n[Yeah, maybe it’s a matter of temper]\nDemera said, looking at the sapling with Leon.\n[You have more holy power than anyone else, but it’s not pure; you have the power of too many gods]\n“…….”\n[If only I had my own Holy Knight… but I suppose that’s a matter for fortune]\nDemera remembered Georgic’s hammer. The hammer of the precious child she had lost.\nAnd the great power he left behind has yet to find a true heir. Though a child named Koo Dae-sung had gained some recognition.\n“I’ll have to find a way to grow the seedling, though the most convenient thing would be to return to Paradise and find my friend.”\n[Don’t do that.]\nDemera shook her head.\n[It is never good for the living to stay in the world of the dead, no matter how strong you are]\n“I can handle it.”\n[Even if Castile asks you to stay with him for one night?]\n“…….”\nLeon fell silent at the mention of a familiar name. Demera continued to mention names.\n[What if Jerea wants to have a drink with you? What if Gillingham wants to joust with you? What if Loxley wants to settle a score with you?]\nDemera patted Leon on the arm with her crested puppet and spoke in a soothing voice.\n[Child, all the gods know of your transcendent will and virtue. But can you, a half-god, half-man, truly walk away from the memories that occupy your life?]\nA moment’s hesitation, a moment’s mingling, is poison to the living. Demera knows that all of Leon’s memories and pleasures are with those in paradise.\nFriendships, love…they are all buried in paradise with those who shared them.\n[The first time, maybe just for a moment, but the second time, it will be longer, and the third time, you’ll think you want to be there more]\nLeon could not refute Demera speculation.\n[My dear, although you have been granted entry to Paradise, this mother thinks you should refrain from doing so unless it is absolutely necessary].\n“I will take the great mother’s words to heart.”\nLeon could not resist Demera’s urging, which came from pure concern.\n* * * *\nOn his way back, Leon ran into Beatrice, who had just gone for a walk.\n“Your Majesty, have you been out for a walk?”\n“Hmm, just checking on some seedlings.”\n“You’ve been checking on it a lot lately. What kind of power does it have that you’re so eager to nurture?”\nAt Beatrice’s question, Leon realized that he had never explained what the seedling was about.\n“This seedling belongs to this king’s old friend, Gunnar, a forest sage. Forest sages spend a lifetime preparing the sapling of the Saint Tree, the center of the forest.”\nBeatrice tilted her head as he explained that it was the only way for the Tree Men, beings of nature alone, to thrive.\n“Your Majesty wants that race to thrive in this land?”\n“That is part of it, but the Saint Tree is also the cornerstone of a shrine to the descent of Irmin, the God of Forests and Trees.”\n“The god of forests and trees… I’ve heard of him in the doctrine, but I’ve never met him.”\nAs High Priestess of Dreams and Death, Beatrice had met and greeted many deities with Yappy but she had never met the God of the Forests and Trees.\n“That’s because he is the god of the forest races. Besides, without the Saint Tree, he can’t wake up.”\nIn Leon’s world, there were deities called race gods, but they were lesser gods and more limited, protecting only a narrow group of races.\n“That’s why none of those damned orc and beastly demigods ever made it into the pantheon.”\nThat doesn’t mean their gods are weak since the Orc gods alone were among the most powerful of the gods.\n“Is there any reason, then, for Irmin’s descent?”\n“There is. The moment he descends upon this earth, the area around the peninsula will bloom with a divinity that few demons can survive.”\nDivine power that could affect a nation…no, more than a nation?\nBeatrice, who knew the mechanics of divine power, questioned.\n“Isn’t the power of the gods built on faith? Why is he the only one…ah.”\nBeatrice’s quick mind quickly realized why Irmin was different from the other gods.\n“A race god… the mechanism of his divinity is different from the others.”\n“The Saint Tree is a relay that generates its own holy power, like the Lionheart implanted in this king. It has the power to cleanse the world of evil, which is why demons can’t get near it.”\nIndeed, a seedling with such power must be nurtured.\nBeatrice alone had lost so many people and due to demonic sabotage in the city.\n“Then, Your Majesty, I have a plan.”\nBeatrice’s plan was to use the seedling itself as the coordinates for a gate.\n* * * *\nBeatrice’s proposal is as follows\nUsing the seedling itself as the coordinates of the gate, leading to the tree men and from there they would be a way to learn about the seedling.\n“Pile up the crystals over there. Evacuate the civilians in the surrounding 300 meters.”\nMagic stones were stacked in the middle of the barracks at the TTG Guild.\nThere are always enough magic stones at the TTG Guild, where they are used for training and clearing gates.\nNevertheless, the sheer volume of magic stones can be overwhelming.\n“Your Majesty, can you place the seedling in the middle?”\nLeon brought the seedling he had planted in the Naju Plain and placed it in the center of the magic circle.\nIf he could open the gate through the seedling that Gunnar had left him, would he be able to see Gunnar again?\nHe was a little hopeful.\n“Will you open the gate?”\n“Of course.”\nBeatrice opened the gate as the pulsating magic circle swallowed up the mountains of magic stones, causing a crack in space.\n-Kaaaaaaaah!!!\nThe magic stones disappear, one by one and their smoldering, angry aura accelerates the cracks.\nOnly a magician of Beatrice’s caliber would be able to cast this.\n─────────\nThe gate that opened was ‘colorless’.\n“Colorless?”\n“I’ve never seen such a gate before!”\nIt was a gate with no color other than the usual black, red, orange, and yellow and even Leon felt threatened by this gate.\n“I guess we need to be careful with this gate.”\n“Yes, I think it would be better to send only a few elites to scout it out first.”\nOriginally, he had planned to take the Knights and Man-At-Arms to attack the gate in a steady manner but the immense energy within the gate urged Leon to be cautious.\n“We’ll scout this gate with a small group of elites, including this king. Any combatants below the rank of kingdom knight should stay behind.”\nAim for reconnaissance, acquisition, and a swift retreat rather than an assault. Leon’s judgment is perfectly rational.\n“Then let’s go. Be careful, everyone.”\nWith Leon leading the way, the elite of the TTG Guild enter one after another with Yappy being the last to enter.\n-BANG!\nSomething flew out of the gate with a loud bang.\n“Boom…!”\n“Your Majesty?!”\nThe figure that bounced out of the gate was none other than Leon.\n[We have found a duplicate figure, you cannot enter the gate]\nThe gate rejected Leon, sending out a vast amount of holy power.",

      "content": "Chapter 128: Lionheart (1)\nThe treasury of a glorious kingdom.\nA cunning, snake-headed monster sifts through the texts that contain thousands of years of the kingdom’s history.\nThe teachings of the gods and the stories of the knights who followed them are interesting to the demons, which seem to have amassed all the world’s concepts of wealth…or rather they are interesting to the demons, who are constantly searching for wisdom.\nWhat an irony that the royal family of a kingdom that once basked in the glory of the gods has also fallen into the clutches of evil.\nMost interesting of all are those who use their mortal form to bend the law: Holy Knights.\nThere has long been a movement to investigate and explore them.\nIt’s just that the monstrous knights, who wield the power of the concept, have been difficult to control, even in captivity.\nThe Holy Knight of Earth, captured over a hundred years ago, has yet to be corrupted, and the Archduke of Lust has recently died together with the Holy Knight of Flame.\nEven demons who have lived for millennia have never seen anything like these knights.\nIn the sense of “living beings,” or mortals, they are creatures of the pinnacle of the dimension and chief among them is the current Lionheart King.\nThe man who killed the Lord of Chaos 24 years ago, spearheading the invasion that led to the Empire’s great collapse.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that his defeat of the Chaos Lord pushed back the end of the world by at least 30 years.\nMore recently, my apprentice was torn limb from limb at his hands but that’s over now.\nTheir kingdom has fallen into the hands of evil, and they will fall like leaves before the unstoppable forces of absolute evil.\nThe snake-headed fiend intends to secure as much of this world’s knowledge as he can before the end of time.\n──────\nIt was then that the vibrations of space shook the world.\nThey were so subtle that no one would notice it, only this demon, who had reached the height of foresight, noticed it.\n“We are not the only ones who wield the gates.”\nSnakehead’s slender finger pointed into the void. The evil finger rippled through the world, tuning into space.\nTune in and interfere.\nThe next moment, beyond the limits of space, evil magic interfered with the dimensional rift.\n* * * *\n“Ugh…….”\nHa-ri’s eyelids twitched as she felt the characteristic flash of light upon entering the gate.\n“This place?”\nHa-ri had been through many gates, but the one in front of her was unlike any of them.\nDesolate.\nThe ground was parched, the air stale, and the sky blackened as if the moon didn’t even shine. Yes…like a demonic world.\n“What is this place?”\nTurning her head, Ha-ri spotted Yappy and Beatrice. Soo-ho and Jae-hyuk were also there.\nExcept for Leon.\n“……This is bad.”\nEven Beatrice had a puzzled look on her face at this point.\nIt was different from when she opened the gate for the first time. Back then, she hadn’t realized she had to open the gate and engrave the arrival coordinates.\nBut not now Beatrice knew the gate well enough to know that it was not a matter of identifying everyone who entered with a single coordinate.\n“His Majesty…I see he’s not allowed in.”\n“Uh, why was he the only one who couldn’t get in?”\n“I don’t know. Let’s go out the gate and double-check.”\nEveryone agreed with Beatrice.\nThere was no telling what threats the first colorless gate ever might hold.\nUnless they can find a way to deal with this, a strategic retreat would be wise.\n“Then let’s enter the gate again──”\nThat’s when the gate they came through suddenly shook and began to crack!\n“Get back!”\nBeatrice’s urgent voice drew the group away from the gate. The next moment, the space the gate was in cracks and swallows them up.\nThe gate was about to disappear and Beatrice urgently poured her magic into it, but it only slowed its disappearance by three seconds.\n“Damn…!”\n“Your Majesty!”\nThe overwhelming magic power trying to annihilate the gate was met with a backlash and Beatrice coughed up blood, clutching her pounding heart.\n“Are you ok?!”\nBeatrice halted Ha-ri, who was about to run over to her, a look of devastation on her face.\n“This much mana…….”\nIt’s like being hit by a dump truck going full speed ahead. Even Beatrice, who could circulate all the power of the natural world and make it her own, could not stand a chance against the power of this endless source.\nA monster that manipulated magic, but seemed to be magic itself. Was there really such a mage in this world?\n“Miss Ha-ri…check the quest.”\n“Ah, the quest…!”\nHa-ri quickly checks the message window, her golden eyes reflecting the blue window.\n[Quest: ■After ■Before ■■■ ■■Here■]\n“Uh, eh?”\nThe system message was distorted and unreadable as if someone had intervened.\n“What the hell is this…….?”\nBeatrice swallowed a gulp of air and squeezed her tight chest. Something was wrong.\n-Commencing reconnaissance.\nYappy unfolded the simple satellite he’d brought with him. After a few experimental maneuvers, the gate satellite was nearing completion.\nOnce launched into space, it would be able to survey the world inside the gate at will.\nThe satellite launch vehicle is quickly propelled into space by ion propellant. In an instant, the satellite reached the stratosphere, and a small light flashed.\n-Kaaaaaah!!!\n“Huh?!”\nA bolt of blue energy flew through the sky, leaving an intense light in its wake. It shot through the air like an arrow, shooting down the satellite as it entered orbit.\n-Bombardment point specific. 140 kilometers from here. Conducting power reconnaissance.\nYappy deployed his reconnaissance drone at the same time as he shot down the satellite. The drones lit up the sky in an instant, and the hostiles were soon spotted.\n-Enemy detected. Multiple flying objects present. Demanding an immediate retreat.\n“Kuluk…! I must have landed in a… bad place.”\nBeatrice swallowed her blood and pulled on the reins of her horse.\nThe group gallops across the plain as Yappy leads the way on the steel legs of his massive fuselage, looking for a safe spot.\n“Queen, we have a flying object approaching from the rear!”\nJae-hyuk shouts urgently, and just as he does, a series of flying objects swoop through the sky.\n-Crack! Crack!\nThey had raven’s heads and dark wings while their upper and lower bodies were more monstrous than human.\n-Retaliatory fire. Limited firepower.\nYappy machine gun fires into the air and in the next moment, a hail of fire rains down.\n-Boom!\n-Crack!\nThe Crow Men fell down from the sky but they’re not the only ones in pursuit.\n-Additional enemies approaching.\n“Hey, what’s that?”\n-Yikes!\nGiant spider-like monsters are running, at least fifty of them, each larger than a chariot.\n“Lord Ultima…….”\nJae-hyuk raised his spear and offered his prayer to the heavens as the clouds shook and a bolt of lightning struck the ground.\n-Kaaaah!\nA bolt of lightning pierces through the center of the spider monsters. The power of Jae-hyuk’s Ultima is definitely powerful enough to kill even the largest monsters with a single strike. But…….\n“What, just one?”\nExcept for the one that was directly struck, the remaining spiders furiously chased after them. Even the most powerful of the Holy Laws, Thunder’s Holy Law, only dealt that much damage?\nJae-hyuk, who thought he could at least deal four or five, was about to call Thunder again when he panicked.\n-Firing main railgun.\nWith a bang, the railgun traveled along the rails at supersonic speed. Yappy railgun rounds pierced seven of the monstrous spiders straight through from the front.\n-Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!\nThe giant monster spiders roared with rage and gave chase. Unable to discern them in the darkness, Ha-ri fired a blast of fire into the air instead.\nThe fireworks are so intense that they can be seen from miles away and as the world lights up, terrible things are revealed.\n“Ah, ahh….”\n“What, what…!”\nThe blackness rushes in and dirty, black things seem to take over the world.\n“What, why are there so many?!”\nThere were monsters in the air and on the ground, like a tidal wave.\nYappy calculates the best route, but can’t find a clear path.\n-Multiple swarms approaching. Estimated 5,354.\nYappy has deployed his full arsenal. Railguns, chain guns, and energized steel wire.\nJust as everyone is at full alert to meet the oncoming enemy force, a figure cuts through the darkness.\n-Boom!\nThe sound came from far away.\nIt was a sound so different from the crawling, gnawing noises of insects in the darkness, a sound that was cheerful, joyous…and destructive.\n-Pour forth, Thundercrown Fury.\nDivine Punishment <Rain of Wrath>\nThe heavens shake and thunderbolts pour down like rain washing away the black stains from the ground.\nEven as he unleashes the fury of the heavens on the earth, he leads a group of knights to break through the center of the monsters.\n“Break through the center!”\n“”Honor!!!”\nThey were a mere two hundred riders riding in a wedge formation into a cluster of monstrous spiders was suicidal, to say the least.\n-Ehhhhh!!!\nAfter being caught off guard by the two transcendents, hundreds of monstrous spiders rushed forward without fear, filling the space with darkness as they tried to devour the light.\nThey were hundreds of times their mass alone but at the moment of conflict──\nLegion Technique <Wedge Assault>\n-Boom!\nThe monsters flew through the air.\nEven with their overwhelming mass, they bounced back in the moment of impact.\nThe wedge-shaped charge seemed to pierce through everything in front of it, piercing through the tidal wave of monsters in an instant.\n-Kiiiiii……\n-Kiyaaah!\nThe spider monsters became cautious in the face of the knights’ overwhelming combat power.\n“I’ve sensed your powerful aura, but I’ve never seen you before.”\nA man in golden armor stood before them.\n“I am Gillingham Ulan, Holy Knight of Ultima, God of Sky and Thunder. You are….”\nHe glanced at Yappy and the half-dead Beatrice, then turned to his riders.\n“Let’s get out of here, the thunder will wear off soon.”\n“Ah, yes!”\n-Strategic retreat.\nThe path was soon filled with monstrous spiders, but they were of little hindrance to the Holy Knight of Thunder.\nUlan’s stormy thunderbolts rained down, and Yappy wires cut through the monstrous spiders until they were finally able to break through.\n* * * * *\nOnce they were safe, Holy Knight Gillingham asked a question.\n“I witnessed the Holy Power and saved you, but what are your identities, especially…….”\nGillingham’s gaze shifted to Yappy. The octoped chariot’s hull made the knights wonder if it was one of the monsters.\nNo, the knights did not give it a hostile glance, even though they should have.\n“Knight of Iron and Blacksmithing, I sense in you a power comparable to that of Lord Antoch, Guardian of the Mines.”\n-Cackle!\n“Sir Antoch should be fine…….”\n“We are visitors from another Kingdom.”\nIt was Beatrice who spoke up.\n“My lady, are you well?”\n“Thanks for your concern, but more than that… How is the situation in the kingdom?”\nBeatrice had a rough idea of the situation: there were a lot of Demon Spiders around, and a man calling himself a Holy Knight.\nShe realized that this was the Lionheart Kingdom and that the demons had invaded.\n“Fearing for the kingdom, I rushed to help, but was delayed by the demons. Would Lord Gillingham care to tell me the full story?”\n“Hmm…I was not considerate. Since the loss of Lord Vulcanus and the Archduke of Lust in the battle on the Plains of Randolce, the Kingdom has been losing ground to them.”\nBeatrice could easily hear the situation from Gillingham.\nHis aura of power and his armor, the symbol of a Lionheart Knight, aroused no suspicion.\nTo summarize the situation: this is Leon’s world, which is being invaded by demons.\nThe empire has fallen, and the heartland of the kingdom has been captured.\nThe Lionheart King has rallied the remnants of the Empire and the disparate races of Elves, Tremens, Dwarves, and others to form a united front.\nThe Holy Knights have been dispatched to various parts of the kingdom to gather survivors.\n“Queen…Beatrice…….”\nHa-ri asked worriedly, switching between Beatrice’s titles.\n“Yes, it’s worse than we thought.”\nNo doubt. This gate is the place where Leon had fought his final battle with the demons.\nHow far did they go? Still amazed at the scope of the gate, they arrived at the place Gillingham wanted them to go.\n“Wow…….”\nEveryone gasped in amazement when they saw it.\nIt was a fertile plain bordered by a river and there was a huge military camp…no, a city.\nOn one side, fields of golden wheat grew, giant woodmen moved materials, and on top of watchtowers, sharp-eyed spiked eagles watched the surroundings.\nEndless rows of soldiers and knights filled the camp, they were on a scale he had never dared to imagine.\n“My God…….”\n“They’re all knights?”\nHa-ri and her companions knew what the Knights of the Lionheart were like.\nRight now, they were better than most top-tier Hunters and the Lionheart’s soldiers were nothing short of extraordinary.\nIn the center of the city was an endlessly high altar, a great temple, rising like a pyramid.\nGillingham said.\n“This is mankind’s last holy place. Welcome to the pantheon.”\nIt was the most important facility in the Lionheart Kingdom, along with the Royal Palace.\nThe seat of the gods where the Lionheart King resides.",

      "content": "Chapter 129: Lionheart (2)\nIn the 63rd year of Leon Dragonia reign as King Lionheart. The Demon Lord of Chaos, Malus was summoned in the imperial capital.\nLeon led eleven Holy Knights and Priests against the forces of Chaos, with the exception of Holy Knight Jerea of Dreams and Death, who was killed while escorting a holy convoy in King Leon’s 62nd year of reign.\nKing Leon defeated Malus, Lord of Chaos, after a war lasting from year 62 to year 66 of Leon’s reign along with 1.33 million Demon Legions of Chaos and 980,000 demonic followers from the Empire.\nManan, Holy Knight of the Sea and Waves, ascended.\nKilian, Holy Knight of Life and Fertility, ascended.\nMore than 10,000 Knight Errants, 14 Realm Knights and 270,000 warriors in the Kingdom Army died but the total deaths amounted to 22.7 million from both the Empire and the Kingdom.\nIn the winter during Year 66 of King Leon reign the second major invasion of the Demon Legion begins.\nCarakael, Demon Lord of Wisdom and Exploration, Dothradon, Demon Lord of Pleasure and Corruption and Scarblood, Demon Lord of Slaughter and Destruction along with thirteen million demonic troops under their command and over five million demonic followers and beast-god pagans attacked.\nThe Empire was destroyed, the Elven forests burned, the Dwarven Mountains wiped out and the Eastern Sky Kingdom razed to the ground.\nLionheart Kingdom’s territory was devastated and King Leon, 85th year of reign the kingdom was doomed.\n* * * *\nThe city of Manshinjian, where the Allied forces were stationed, was bustling with activity.\nSoldiers were constantly on guard around the perimeter of the camp, while commoner light cavalry went out on scouting missions from time to time, signaling the Knights of the Realm where force was needed.\nThe priests used their holy arts to grow crops and make armor, and the refugees did whatever was needed.\nTrenches were dug, fields were cultivated, and soldiers were trained.\nAfter more than two decades of war against the demons, they were united in their efforts.\n“The king has gone south to rejoin the remnants of his army. He should be back soon, so stand by.”\nHoly Knight Gillingham temporarily assigned Beatrice and her companions to a military camp and left to find their own mission.\nIn the meantime, the others found their own work.\nBeatrice sought out the Sages of the Forest to learn more about the seedlings of Gunnar, which was her original purpose, and Yappy began traveling around in his minimalist body to gather intelligence.\nThat left Ha-ri, Jae-hyuk, Soo-ho, and So-yeon.\nThe four knights were indecisive for a while before deciding to help with the military’s chores.\n“You’re the Goddess of the Sea and Waves?”\n“I’m also the Goddess of War and Flame!”\nThe soldier was surprised by Ha-ri’s words, and judging by her exotic attire, he assumed she was from one of the more remote corners of the kingdom.\n“Then I would like you to go to the temple and take care of the worshippers.”\n“Ah, old man, but I… I specialize in combat…….”\n“Is that so? Well, the temple is not under our jurisdiction. You’ll have to speak to Priestess Isabelle or Mother Anak first.”\nHa-ri had nothing better to do, so she headed for the place the sergeant designated.\n“Well, since he said temple…….”\nJust like the name of the place, the location of the Great Hall of the Gods was in the very center of the city.\nAs Ha-ri approached the massive landmark, visible from every corner of the city, she was overwhelmed by the thousands of steps.\n“Wow…when am I going to get up all this?”\nIf I’d known it would be like this, I would have taken a horse but if she did, she might be labeled as impious.\nApparently, the believers around her were also walking up.\n-Phew! Phew!\nHow far did she get?\nWhen she was about a third of the way up the sound of hooves approached and the carriage stopped in front of Ha-ri as she struggled up the stairs.\n“Sister, why are you leaving your carriage and walking?”\n“Ugh. What?”\nThe carriage ‘window’ opened to reveal the voice of a brunette nun.\nHa-ri was taken aback, not so much by the suddenness of the call as by the calm aura she exuded.\n‘Wow, that’s a lot of power…comparable to His Majesty?’\nThe Holy Knights were powerful, but her holy power was comparable to the Lionheart King.\nNo, maybe even more. Of course, that was based on Earth’s Leon, but a being with such boundless holy power?\n“I’m sorry to have surprised you, but if you don’t mind, would you like to come with me?”\n“Thank you.”\nA carriage…I’m supposed to ride in it?\nThen, out of the corner of her eye, she could see a carriage rising toward the top of the temple so Ha-ri quickly climbed into the carriage.\n“It’s a common misunderstanding among brothers who come to the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods for the first time. There’s a carriage for business, so you can use that from now on.”\n“Thank you.”\nApparently there was a separate path for priests so Ha-ri inclined her head, and the other inclined her in return.\n“Nice to meet you, I’m Anak Protezia, the lowly servant of Lady Arianna.”\n“Nice to meet you. I’m Han Ha-ri.”\n“…….”\n“……?”\nAh, Ha-ri interjected.\n“I’m Lord Petos and Lord Poma new goddess.”\n“Hmm?”\nThe woman, who identified herself as Anak, stared at Ha-ri in surprise.\n“You must be unique to serve two gods at the same time.”\nAnak was very interested in Ha-ri; she seemed to sense the two powerful gods in her and was amazed.\n“But being a goddess of both Poma and Petos…that must be a lot of work for you.”\n“Oh, you understand?”\nHa-ri was touched by Anak’s sympathy for her.\nPetos, a ferocious warlord, pecks at her during the peaceful days, while Poma often inhabits the turtles in the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods and harasses her.\nConnecting with the gods is a strange and mysterious experience at first, but that’s the way it is.\n“An acquaintance of mine is a devoted follower of both gods. Well, their personalities are compatible, so they don’t seem to have too much trouble…….”\n“Getting along with those two, doesn’t that mean they must have a personality disorder?”\n“Hmm…Depends on your point of view. When they captured a smuggling ship, they tied a female pirate to the bow…….”\n“Ouch, I can’t believe there’s another human being like that in the world!”\n“Even a shrine maiden?”\nHa-ri’s nod held a wordless regret.\nAs she talked to Anak, he realized that Anak was much greater than she thought.\nHa-ri has known people with inhuman charisma like Leon the Lionheart King and Beatrice the Magician Queen.\nIf Leon is the raw violence and authority of the sublime, Beatrice is the intensity and splendor of magic.\nBoth have an intense presence that befits their status as “king.”\nAnak, on the other hand, was the complete opposite: a warm aura of infinite love.\nShe was not like a king, but benevolent like a religious sage.\nHa-ri’s suspicions were correct.\n“Holy Mother, you have come.”\n“The High Priestess?!”\nHa-ri realized that, aside from being correct, this woman was a figure of immense authority as she prostrated herself and cried out.\n“I’m sorry, Your Holiness!”\nHa-ri’s tone stunned High Priestess Anak into silence for a moment. She huffed and laughed, then pulled her to her feet.\n“Don’t do that, sister. We are equals before the gods.”\n“Yes… er…His Majesty is…….”\nHa-ri stopped herself from inadvertently quoting Leon’s words and Anak tilted his head.\n“You’ve met His Majesty before, were you a priestess of a fairly large temple? There was a priestess I didn’t recognize.”\n“Oh, no, that was… coincidental, I remember His Majesty being…rank-conscious.”\n“He is the Lionheart King.”\nA being that transcends the ranks of human society.\nIn this world, the Lionhearted King is not just a human.\n“How can a demigod in a human body be like a commoner like us?”\n“I see.”\n“By the way, it’s just as well, Sister. I can sense some powerful holy power in you, so may I ask you a favor?”\n“Uh… if it’s something I can do.”\nHa-ri accepted Anak’s offer, even if it was frivolously.\n* * * *\n“High Priestess, you have come.”\n“High Priestess.”\n“High Priestess…….”\nThe priests of the temple bowed in greeting at Anak’s arrival.\n‘Someone very high, indeed.’\nAs far as Ha-ri knew, the Lionheart King was the pinnacle of the pantheon then the Holy Knights and the Chief Priest were next in line.\nShe didn’t know much about saints, but if she’s called a saint, she’s probably on the same level as a holy knight or a priestess, or even higher.\n“Where is High Priestess Isabel?”\n“She is absorbing the energy of the moon.”\n“I’m going to prepare for the ritual of the Great Blessing first, tell High Priestess Isabel to come down.”\n“……!”\nThe priests turned bright red; they seemed to have deduced something from the High Priestess’s words.\n“His Majesty is returning in triumph!”\n“He must be mentally tired, having been bathed in the blood of the evil servants, so let’s hurry.”\nHis Majesty, that is, Leon, the Lionheart King of this time.\nHa-ri realized that even here, Leon had absolute support and adoration.\nIn fact, he was probably worshiped beyond compare to Earth.\n“His Majesty Leon is…….”\nWas this the King Leon she knew? They’d entered the gate together, but he’d disappeared, so maybe they’d gone their separate ways, like Jerea had.\nBut there was a high probability that it was an NPC that embodied Leon in this gate, and even knowing that, Ha-ri couldn’t help but feel excited.\n‘I wonder what his Majesty was like in the past.’\n-Kwalung!\nIt was raining.\nHa-ri was not surprised, as she had been warned that the thunderous downpour was intentional on the Holy Knight’s part, but──\n“His Majesty the Lionheart King is entering!”\nInside the bustling temple a priest shouts out, and at the same time, a thunderbolt strikes, drowning out the sound.\nIn a world that shone brightly for a moment, a cold armor appeared.\n“……!”\nIt was an unfamiliar form, even to Ha-ri. A brutal reality at odds with what she had imagined.\nBlack blood, sticky and unwashed by the torrential downpour, glistened in the visor of his helmet, shimmering in a stylized glow.\nThe armored knight steps through the pouring rain, his eyes cold as he enters the temple.\nHis Majesty Leon, the authoritative and cheerful Lord of the TTG Guild, is nowhere to be seen, only the blackened and bloody…Apostle of Death.\n“Hmph…!”\nShe clasped her hands over the breath she was about to take.\nHa-ri knew it was rude, but she couldn’t help herself.\nHer skin was crawling and her heart pounding at the sight of death in human form.\nAnd it was the same for the common priests, none of them could speak.\n“You’re murderous, Your Majesty.”\n“”……!!!””\nEveryone was stunned by the blasphemy. Who would dare to speak so lightly to such a demigod, let alone the Lionheart King they knew?\n“Isabel.”\nA dull voice from inside the visor and in the direction of the blue glow was a dark-haired priestess, dressed more openly than the others.\n“High Priestess of the Moon…”\nOne of the priests took pains to point out the blasphemy, but the dark-haired High Priestess ignored it with a twist of her lips.\n“I am the King’s executioner in life and Dinah’s first hunter in death, so what.”\nThe High Priestess of Dinah, goddess of the moon and chastity, continued to speak in the face of death, insisting that she was invincible.\n“Your Majesty, don’t stand there weighing yourself down. The High Priestess is waiting for you.”\n“I’m coming.”\nBut it seems to have worked as the ferocity in the Lionheart King’s armor faded, and he strode through the temple with a grunt, followed by the dark-haired priestess.\n“Ah, those who will be participating in the Great Blessing Ceremony, please follow me.”\n“…….”\nHa-ri wonders how many would dare to follow such a terrifying figure, but to his surprise, the priests follow him without question.\nThey had absolute trust that the Lionhearted King, king of the land and pinnacle of the temple, would never harm them.\nHa-ri hurried after Leon.\n* * * *\nThe place where the Great Blessing ceremony was taking place was a huge bathhouse. A sacred space, to be precise, filled with holy water.\nAs soon as Ha-ri entered, she was overwhelmed by the holy power that filled the air.\n“Welcome, Your Majesty. You’re back after 60 days.”\nHe is greeted by the High Priestess Anak, who is standing by with other priests.\n“I hear you had Lord Loxley and Lord Gildus with you, how did it go?”\n“Not much. We broke their forces by 300,000.”\n“A victory, I’m sure everyone will be pleased.”\nLeon responded cynically to Anak’s comment.\n“A tactical victory in a localized war. It’s not like we’re going to be able to take back our lost kingdom.”\n“Still, a victory is a victory. Take off your armor and let me clean you up.”\nLeon complied and removed his helmet. The heat inside the armor instantly evaporated in a puff of smoke.\nInside the helmet, his face was covered in black stains.\nThe armor he removed with the help of the priests was even worse. As if he had walked through boiling lava, the black stains were burning the Lionheart King’s flesh in real time.\n“Your Majesty…….”\nThe Great Priestess looked at him with pity but the Lionheart King dismissed it with a wave of his hand, saying it was nothing.\n“I tore the Ugly Demon of Inquiry alive. His pain and screams are cursed, but he dare not harm me.”\n“You look terribly ill, Your Majesty.”\n“High Priestess Isabel…….”\nAnak glared at her for disrespecting the king but Leon didn’t care.\n“That’s it. The Moon Priestess’s disrespect is nothing new. Above all, the Goddess of Purity has a heavy burden to bear.”\n“Heh, that’s true. Come on, step into the holy water so I can cleanse you.”\nLeon took off his armor completely and dipped his black-stained body into the holy water.\nThe stains hissed and boiled.\nIt should have been painful, but Leon held on, waiting for the touch of the High Priestess and the Lunar Priestess.\n“I will cleanse him, Priestess Isabel, and you, Priestess Han Ha-ri, come here.”\n“What? Yes, yes!”\nHa-ri stepped into the submerged holy water with Isabel and stood before Leon.\nIt was not shame, but sadness that shone in Ha-ri’s eyes, even though reason was not in the picture.\nShe sympathizes with the fatigue he must be experiencing, having fought a battle she can’t imagine.\n“These stains are the Archdemon…no, the Archduke.”\n“I’ve never paid attention to the rank of the demons I’ve slain, but I’m pretty sure it was the Archduke of Wisdom or something.”\nThe curse that the Archduke of Wisdom left behind as he died was a curse that the three of them would have to cleanse from now on.\n“Goddess Ha-ri, burn the stain with your divine flame and I will purify it with the power of light.”\n“And I will bestow the blessing of purity on the least pure.”\nIsabel giggled and brought her palm to the stain on Leon’s back. Isabel’s palm burned, but she didn’t care.\n“Goddess of the moon and purity here is your chaste maiden or first hunter in prayer.”\nHer holy power, which she had accumulated every night from the moment Leon left for the battlefield, poured forth at once.\nTo wield the power of the moon and the goddess of chastity, one must be a chaste virgin, and as for goddess of the hunt, there must be sufficient tribute to her.\n“The destruction of an evil being, the antithesis of purity, must be greater than any prey.”\nIsabel interjected, referring to Leon’s accomplishment.\n“Thus, Thou who presides over the purity of the world, bless the greatest warrior in defense of thy virgins.”\nLeon’s most stained parts were washed away. Taking holy water in both hands and pouring it over Leon’s head, Anak’s lips touch his forehead.\n“Goddess of justice, light of the world, stronger in will than any other, share the pain of your first knight with this lowly body.”\nTheir consecration ceremony was so sacred that Ha-ri watched in awe, such was the power of the clergy at the height of Lionheart.\nNeither Beatrice nor Yakt Spinner had the holiness that comes from true faith.\nThey were merely agents of the gods’ power but there was something about the two before her that truly connected them to the gods.\n‘Can I…be like them?’\nIf she was the gods’ chosen one…Ha-ri might be able to burn this curse away with the power of Petos, the God of Gar and Fire.\n‘Petos…….’\nIn the absence of Leon, who holds the pantheon, she wonders who receives her prayers here.\n[……who, you]\nThe voice of the fierce war god she’s always heard was the same but the voice is filled with questions about Ha-ri.\nHowever Ha-ri didn’t hesitate to draw upon the divine blessing and connection that had been bestowed upon her as an intense flame erupts, and it burns away the stain that clings to Leon.\n“Okay, okay…?!”\nTheir gazes met and the blue eyes stared at Ha-ri like a piercing light.\nHa-ri had been told it was impolite to stare at royalty, but she wasn’t sure what to do if Leon was staring at her.\n“Who are you──?”\nLeon’s question was directed at Ha-ri when a commotion erupted outside.\n“Your Excellency! No!”\n“We’re in the middle of a mass!”\nSomeone rushed through the clamoring priests and into the consecration ceremony.\nIt was a woman of intense black color.\nHair as black as ebony, eyes as blue as aquamarine. She was an intense woman who looked more at home in her current bloody uniform than her dress.\n“Karina, how may I help you?”\nThe woman called Karina strode unhurriedly toward Leon, who was bathed in holy water, and bowed in salute.\n“Congratulations on your victory, Your Majesty Lionheart.”\n“……Yes, Archduke of Dragonia. What brings you here?”\nGrand Duchess Karina Dragonia, heir to the current Lionheart King, Leon Dragonia Lionheart.\nShe turned to her father and spoke with an extremely businesslike gaze.\n“We, the Northern Army, declare our withdrawal from the Alliance effective immediately.”",

      "content": "Chapter 130: Lionheart (3)\n“We, the Northern Army, declare our withdrawal from the Alliance effective immediately.\nGrand Duchess Karina Dragonia, daughter of the current Lionheart King, Leon Dragonia Lionheart, and heir to the title of Grand Duke, which he abdicated upon the birth of his heir.\nShe was raised from birth to be the heir to the title of Grand Duke of Dragonia, which was also held by the Lionheart King, and assumed the title upon her coming of age, ruling the Grand Duchy for 40 years.\nAt 60, she’s not exactly old in Lionheart, but she’s not exactly young either.\nThanks to her eponymous dragon’s blood, the ageless Grand Duchess of Dragonia is a Holy Knight, and with that comes a wisdom and experience that can never be judged by appearances.\nFor some reason, she has declared her intention to leave humanity’s last alliance.\nLeon didn’t make eye contact with Karina, instead staring off into the whiteness of the holy water’s steam.\n“I cannot allow it. The Northern Army is a great pillar of the Alliance. Without you, our forces will inevitably be weakened.”\n“Addition does not make a difference.”\n“Your Highness…….”\nAnak sends her a sad gaze, but Karina only states the reality with blunt emotion.\n“Your Majesty, the royal city has fallen and the entire continent is already in ruins. There are barely two hundred thousand men left in our army, and if you count the serfs, it’s not even three hundred thousand. On the other hand, what about the enemy’s army?”\nThere were ten million and even that was a conservative number.\nThe number of demons pouring out of the Demon Gates, which were opened in the entire world, was unfathomable.\n“Your Majesty, agent of the Ten Thousand Gods and commander of all knights. Do you truly have a chance of winning this war?”\n“…….”\nLeon did not answer. No, he couldn’t. His position was not light enough to discuss irresponsible spiritualism.\n“Your Majesty will win.\nRight then and there, Ha-ri wanted to say, this man before her, Leon Dragonia Lionheart, would fight the demons to the very end, alone and win.\nBut Ha-ri could not bring herself to mention it, knowing that it was a hollow victory after everyone else was dead.\n“What shall we do?”\n“The Grand Duchy was the second place to burn after the Empire. Thirty thousand Northern soldiers lost their homes, lost their families, and now we are all that remains of the North.”\nKarina, the Archduke of Dragonia, said.\n“We may not be able to tear them all to pieces, but we will pay back the enmity of our family, and we will slay the demons who dare to nest in the Grand Duchy and dishonor the dead.”\nIt was a grudge everyone had. Who hadn’t lost family and friends in this war?\n“Do you blame me?”\nAnd Leon was the man responsible for their families’ death.\n“Do you think it was wrong for this to prioritize destroying the demon’s main army over the Archduke of Dragonia?”\nDestroying the demon army to buy a year’s time, or saving the Archduke from certain death?\nLeon chose time for the sake of the kingdom…nay, for the sake of all of humanity.\n“No, Your Majesty, you should have made that choice, for the duty you owe comes before the entire kingdom, not just the Archduke.”\n“Then how can…….”\n“This is a deeply personal vendetta, and this is the proof.”\nIt was then. Karina tore off the shoulder blades of her uniform, revealing bare skin, and in that bare skin laid a dark power.\n“Karina…!”\nLeon jumped to his feet. His wide eyes glared at his daughter and yet, the Archduchess only opposes her father.\n“I and the entire Northern Army have made a pact with the God of Vengeance. As of this hour, I am a Holy Knight in the service of Ventasis, the God of Darkness and Vengeance, and the Archduke of Dragonia, commanding thirty thousand Avengers.”\nYour Majesty, my duty is no longer to survive.\nLeon shuddered at his daughter’s harsh declaration, clenching his fists.\n“Have it your way, Archduke of Dragonia! I don’t even want to look at you! Disappear before this king’s eyes!”\n“…….”\nArchduke Karina closed her eyes for a moment, and then with a light bow, she left the room.\n* * * *\n“Are you going to be okay?”\nIsabel asked, she looked worried for her niece and brother-in-law.\n“It’s too late, my dear. She made a pact with the God of Vengeance, and there is only one fate for that child.”\nLeon washed his face with a dry brush and vented his frustration.\n“Did this king make the wrong choice?”\n“I don’t know. Your Majesty has never made a wrong choice.”\n“And you, and no one else, can say that?”\n“Well, kidnapping and marrying my sister, who was a perfectly good chaste priestess, was… well, it was a two-way street, so let’s just say.”\nIsabel giggled, squeezing Leon’s shoulder. It was a rude gesture, but scolding her was the least he could do.\n“But we’d better package the Northern Army’s desertion as an official royal decree. Any unauthorized departure would threaten to tear the Union apart.”\n“The Northern Army will be publicized as exterminating the Beast God’s cultists and the Archon’s demons. What is Lord Antoine doing?”\n“I hear he’s working on a new suit of armor for the king. It was ruined in the fight against the Lord of Chaos.”\n“Tell him to forge a sword for the kid before the Northern army departs. This king’s armor can wait.”\nWhile the conversation continued, Anak washed Leon’s body in silence, cleaning away the stains. Ha-ri watched as she did so, and ignited her flame powers.\nThe curse of the Demon Archduke clung to Leon’s body, and it took all night to remove it.\n* * * *\nYappy knew that his fuselage would be noticed wherever he went, so he dropped it off at the tent assigned to Jae-hyuk and Soo-ho then traveled around the temple in his small body.\nWhile Beatrice was away on her main mission, Yappy was given the task of researching the casting technologies of Lionheart in this era.\n-Secure the artifact manufacturing technology. Recon mode on.\nThe drones are conspicuous, but Yappy’s minimalist body allows him to spy without being seen.\nUsing the information he scanned upon entering the Temple, Yappy infiltrated a massive forge facility in the center of the city.\n-Diverse!\nMechanical legs scaled the roof and entered the ceiling of the forge. It was filled with lightly dressed smiths.\n“How much stardust do we have left?”\n“We’re running low. We need to summon a new star…….”\n“The timing is not good. Didn’t Mother Anak say anything?”\nIn the Kingdom of Lionheart, the forges are run by priests who believe in the God of Iron and Blacksmiths.\nTheir tone is more polite and less harsh than that of other smiths, as the profession of blacksmithing itself is one of priesthood.\n-Kiruk.\nThe facility is also very neat and organized for a medieval forge. There were separate sections for separating and disassembling the iron, priests to bless the iron, and a division of labor rather than a single blacksmith working from start to finish.\nBut that’s just the knowledge that comes with human skill and wisdom. The real deal is the central core foundry.\n-Record video. Begin analyzing behavior and downloading backups.\nAmong them, Yappy saw a blacksmith priest.\nA man over two meters tall, with a hammer the size of a man’s torso and his hammering is flawless, even for a machine.\nOnly his workbench was alone, with no one else around, so he must be categorized as a master craftsman.\n“There’s a rat.”\nAt the same time, the blacksmith priest stretched out his hand into the air toward the exact spot where Yappy was.\n-Rat!\nYappy gripped the ceiling so tightly that it tore it apart, and was dragged away.\nGrasped by a force that even Yappy, the Holy Knight of the God of Iron and Blacksmiths, could not resist, he locked eyes with the middle-aged man in front of him.\n“Who are you?”\n-Crack!\nYappy tried to wriggle out of the man’s grasp, but couldn’t.\n-Let go, organic…!\nYappy’s mechanical arm stretched out a steel wire that quickly became a whip and lashed out at the man and the man was surprised by the power it contained.\n“Hooo….”\nBut at that moment, the wires that he swung to threaten crumble to the ground in unison as if under immense pressure.\n-Boom!\nThe weight of the fuselage has become abnormally heavy and Yappy tries to fight it off, but at his current size, he doesn’t have enough power.\n“I thought you were a rat, but this…you’re a cute priest.”\nThe man released the pressure on Yappy and in a flash, Yappy scrambled to the ceiling and assumed a combat stance.\n“Stop it. There is no reason for priests of the same deity to antagonize each other.”\nAntoine waved his hand to calm Yappy.\n“My name is Antoine, Holy Knight of the God of Iron and Blacksmith.”\n-Hmm?\nYappy had heard that name before. He was a friend from the past that Leon sometimes spoke of.\n“Antoine the Mine Guardian, do you recognize me?”\n* * * *\nIt wasn’t until late at night that the group assigned to tents by Holy Knight Gillingham of Thunder gathered together.\n“I don’t see Lord Yappy.”\n“The queen hasn’t returned either.”\nJae-hyuk and So-yeon were the first to arrive and organize their quarters. Yappy’s large fuselage was in the middle of the tent, making it more cramped than they expected.\n“Boys, have you seen my sister?”\nSoo-ho asked, looking for Ha-ri, who wasn’t there. The entrance to the tent opens and a familiar bushy-haired girl enters.\n“Sorry, I’m late, right?”\n“Sis!”\nHa-ri had brought a basket full of ingredients.\n“The Temple gave me this for my hard work.”\n“Did you go to the temple?\n“Yes. I met His Majesty there.”\n“His Majesty?”\nTheir eyes widened at the mention of meeting Leon but Ha-ri interjected.\n“The King from this gate, to be exact. Not the King we knew.”\n“So…this world was the Gate of His Majesty Leon.”\nThe four shared the information they had gathered.\n“The kingdom has been occupied for quite some time. It is said that most of the kingdom has been taken over by demons and this is almost the only city left.”\n“I’ve heard of the Last Battle and I wonder if it’s the main focus of this gate?”\n“I overheard the part where the king was talking about it, and he said that the northern army is leaving this place.”\nThe overall theme is one of war.\nThe forces of the demons that invaded Leon’s world and the forces of the Lionheart Kingdom that formed the last alliance of humanity.\nThe struggle is between the allies and the demons, who are gradually expanding their power.\n“”…….””\nThey know how this fight will end. Leon will emerge as the survivor of the Black Gate, and while all the demons have been defeated, Leon’s world will eventually perish.\nBut what are the conditions for the closing of this gate? Everything about this gate, from the quest to what they need to find out, is esoteric.\n“There…….”\nAt that moment, Soo-ho raised his hand.\n“Does anyone else have a connection to the Ten Thousand Gods? I can use the Holy Law, but Arianna’s response is a little weak, like there’s a lot of noise.”\n“Ah…….”\nI had forgotten about that. I hadn’t thought about it because I used the holy law naturally.\n“Speaking of which…! Ouch!”\nHa-ri remembered the voice he had heard during Leon’s consecration ceremony. The voice of Petos asking her who she was but she hadn’t heard it after leaving the temple, so she’d forgotten about it.\n“I see, so why can’t I connect now-”\n“Wait, isn’t it too quiet around here?”\nEveryone sensed the discomfort in Chun So-yeon’s words. Thousands of tents had been erected to accommodate the overflowing population, and chattering human voices could be heard everywhere.\nBut now, outside the tent where Ha-ri and the others were, it was too quiet. It was as if──\n-Thump!\nAt that moment, the entire tent was torn down. It was a giant tree man who pulled it down, and soldiers all over the place kept their eyes on Ha-ri’s group.\n“…….”\n“…….”\nAs Ha-ri and the others rolled their eyes, unable to comprehend what was happening, a knight in sleek coppery armor stepped forward.\n“I am Loxley, Holy Knight of the Kingdom of Lionheart and servant of Tatar, God of Sun and Judgment, and I command you, sinners, to receive your punishment in silence!”\n“Sinners?”\n“Sins, sinners, what did we do-─?”\n“Shut up, sinners! I have not granted you permission to open your mouths!”\nLord Loxley drew his sword and pointed it, his voice crackling all around.\n“If you resist, I’ll cut off a limb or two!”\nIf there’s one piece of wisdom they gleaned from working alongside Leon, it’s to shut up and surrender.\n“Nothing, I’ve dropped my weapon!”\n“”We surrender!””\nBecause they’ve seen too many demons and orcs with their skulls crushed or their limbs blown off because they refused.",

      "content": "Chapter 131: The Final Holy Grail\nAfter a quick surrender, the four were dragged away in hoods.\n“What are we going to do?”\n“You’re all going to die, you bastards!”\n“Will you shut up, you criminals!”\n“”Yes, I will shut up!!!”\nThe four people shut up right away.\nLoxley, the Holy Knight of the Sun and Judgment, personally put them in a carriage and headed off somewhere.\n‘Uh, I wonder where we’re going, sis…….’\n‘The execution grounds?’\n‘No way…….’\n‘Why don’t they give us a chance to be serfs first? We’re not even followers of the demons!’\n‘Isn’t it better to just die than to become a serf?’\n”That’s true.”\nBut gradually, as the carriage’s path became more and more even, Ha-ri realized that this carriage was going up somewhere.\n‘Could it be…The Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods?’\nIf they were taking them to the temple, did that mean they weren’t going to throw them in jail?\nHa-ri was dragged from the carriage and led for a while to a familiar place.\n‘Huh? This place?’\nThen, with a snap, the hoods were lifted, and the four of them could see a bath filled with holy water and a crowd of people standing around.\n“Hmph…!”\nThe bathtub was filled with an eerie density of dense holy power.\nIt wasn’t just the holy water that was poured into the bath. It was even denser than when Ha-ri first came here.\nA demon would have died upon entering.\n‘These people can’t all be…….’\n‘It’s obvious, they’re all Holy Knights or the equivalent.’\nGillingham, Holy Knight of Sky and Thunder, on the left.\nLoxley, Holy Knight of Sun and Judgment.\nAnak, High Priestess of Light and Justice, on the right.\nIsabel, High Priestess of the Moon and Purity.\nAnd in the middle of it all, looking down on them with an icy gaze, was the Lion King, agent of all the gods.\nAs the others remained silent until Leon spoke, he eyed the four of them carefully…especially Ha-ri.\nAfter all, she was the one who had blessed him during the Great Blessing Ritual to cleanse him of the Demon Archduke’s curse.\n“First…….”\nIn such a murderous mood, Leon spoke up.\n“Throw them in the holy water, Lord Loxley.”\n“Yes!”\nThe Knight of Judgment drew his sword in a flash. He pointed it with a searing gaze at the four whose arms were bound.\n“Sinners, throw yourselves into the holy water!”\n“What?”\nThey heard that Yappy and Beatrice’s water torture was so brutal, but this was the original!\n“Do I have to say it twice or do you want to have your bristles blown off by the sword?”\n“Ah, no, no!”\n“I’ll dive right now!”\nIf they stayed in the water for much longer, they would be blown away. Jae-hyuk was the first to jump in, followed by Ha-ri and Soo-ho.\n“Haa…….”\nSo-yeon dives in quietly, not wanting to lose her dignity in this situation. Her gaze is fixed on Leon from start to finish.\nThey had been submerged in the holy water for so long that if they jumped out of the water, they would be hit with a skull-crushing chop, but they heard Leon’s voice.\n“Come up.”\n“Come on up!”\n“”Puhap!!!”\nIn unison, the four rose to the surface of the holy water. However, as they usually did at the TTG Guild, they stayed just high enough that the king would never look up.\n“Hmm….”\n“Your Majesty~ Since they don’t dissolve in the holy water, I’m guessing they’re not demons?”\nThese were the words of Isabelle, the High Priestess of the Moon and Purity, whose gaze was not very suspicious of the four people from the beginning.\n“They’ve embraced the holy power, so they can’t be demons.”\n“You are right, Mother Anak, and that is why I have led them without question.”\nGillingham, who had brought Ha-ri and the others, also spoke up but one man disagreed.\n“Who knows what those wicked demons might have done!”\nLoxley, the Holy Knight of the Tatar, God of the Sun and Judgment, was still skeptical.\nThere was one more reason he was still suspicious.\n“There’s no way Your Majesty, a living demigod and the Divine Mother, wouldn’t know about this!”\n‘It’s simply that His Majesty can’t have made a mistake.’\n“Lord Gillingham, I hear there are two more.”\n“Ah, yes! A woman with the divinity of dreams and death, and a half-breed with the divinity of iron and blacksmithing, both of whom… have the holy power of living saints.”\n“”……!!””\nThe words startled everyone, including Loxley.\nA living saint is a supernatural powerhouse, a Holy Knight, one of the very few in the Lionheart Kingdom.\nBut there were two of them?\nIf they were, there’s no way Lionheart, the organization that oversees all the faithful, wouldn’t know about it.\n“It’s been twenty-four years since Lord Jerea ascended. If you think a new heir has emerged…….”\n“No, it hasn’t.”\nLeon dismisses Isabel’s speculation and looks around at the four saints and sisters.\n“Please step aside. This king has a question for them.”\n“Your Majesty, that can’t be…!”\n“Lord Loxley, I understand your loyalty, but for now, trust this king’s judgment.”\n“……I understand.”\nEach of the four saints cast a glance at Leon, and then they were out the door.\n“Then…….”\nLeon glared. The four swallowed hard.\nHa-ri glanced at Leon, expecting to see some sort of response, but instead his gaze turned to the next person.\n“State your names.”\n“I’m Kim Jae-hyuk.”\n“Ha, Han Soo-ho.”\n“I’m Chun So-yeon.”\n“Hmph…….”\nLeon looks puzzled as he considers the four names. He asks further questions.\n“Where is your hometown?”\n“That, that…….”\nThe four look at each other and hesitate to answer. As they contemplate how to formulate a response in their native language, Leon shouts at them.\n“Where are you rolling your eyes, why can’t you answer immediately?”\n“Seo, Seoul, Seoul, South Korea!”\n“Uh, it’s a very far country!”\n“Yes, it is very far!”\n“…….”\nLeon stared at them wordlessly, and then, as if comprehending something, he drew upon his overflowing holy power. And then──\nA huge presence appeared behind Leon’s back.\nAn enormous sense of imposing power descended upon them.\n“Surely… this is a child I have never seen before.”\nArianna, Goddess of Light and Justice.\n“How is it then that they bear our blessing?”\nPoma, goddess of the sea and waves.\n“Is this not the work of the evil ones?”\nPetos, god of war and flame.\n“I remember all those to whom I have bestowed my blessing, and if they are fakes, I will tear their souls to shreds!”\nAnd Ultima, god of the sky and thunder.\nThe four gods Leon had instantly descended upon pressed down on the four men with an immense sense of authority.\n“What about Ventasis? That girl must be one of her contracted avengers.”\n“He has many contracted avengers, and he is the one who is profiting the most from these turbulent times.”\nAs the four stood before Leon, clad in the robes of the gods, they realized they had been sorely mistaken.\n‘Fighting the Archduke…was a small part of his power?’\n‘The descent of the gods… Isn’t that something that even His Majesty on Earth has never shown?’\nUntil now, the gods had revealed themselves by voice or through a medium.\nOnly once did Leon a god descend and that was when he appointed Yakt Spinner as Holy Knight.\n‘Even then, his majesty coughed up blood after only a brief summoning, but for his majesty here… it’s no big deal, is it?’\nAs a Holy Law user, Ha-ri had felt the fullness of holy power in this world, but she hadn’t expected it to be this much.\nIf Earth became a land filled with such power… the current Gate situation itself would not be difficult to resolve.\n“It is not for nothing that this king has come to take you captive. None of the gods know you, even though you are blessed by them.”\n“Ah…….”\nAnd for good reason.\nHa-ri’s connection to the gods is due in part to Leon’s time on Earth.\nThe gods here are technically in the past. They’re recreations, so they don’t know they exist.\n“Be honest with this king. Tell me where you came from, how you got here.”\nHa-ri didn’t know where to start or how much to say, so she decided to tell him everything.\nLeon might be a bit of a maverick, but he wasn’t a complete idiot.\n“…….”\nLeon and the gods were silent for a while after she told them everything. For them, it was a shocking realization that they had a predetermined future and that they were recreated beings, even if it was only the past that they could barely speak of.\n“I see. By the gods, is this possible?”\nBut Leon was surprisingly calm. Had he already accepted that their destruction was a foregone conclusion?\n“It is not impossible.”\nArianna didn’t start by denying Ha-ri’s claim.\n“Time is beyond the reach of even the gods. If there were a record of the entire universe across dimensions, it would be possible to recreate something that even our gods would not recognize.”\n“……So that’s how it happened.”\nLeon’s gaze flickered back to Ha-ri, but was somewhat detached.\n“Your role, then, is to assist this king in moving into the future.”\nObediently, she accepted her role.\n* * * *\nBeatrice found the place where the Tree Men and Sages gathered, a short distance from the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods.\nProtecting and tending the forest, they are the spirits of the woods, themselves the embodiment of nature’s will.\nThey are said to be actively aiding the Alliance during this unprecedented crisis, but at night, when their work is done, they blend into the forest around them.\n“Who art thou?”\n“Such a clear aura of Fle.”\n“The Twilight Knight must have ascended.”\n“The new priestess.”\nThey scanned her as if of one mind. Beatrice smiled brightly.\n“I am Beatrice Alighieri Spero. Sages of the Forest.”\nHer voice echoed through the forest. The spirits of the forest firmly recognized the voice.\n“High Priestess of Fle.”\n“On what business.”\n“To visit the forest.”\n“Will you look at this?\nBeatrice revealed what she had brought: the seedling of Gunnar, which she used as a coordinate to open this gate. The Sages who saw it were surprised.\n“This is…….”\n“Our seedling…….”\nThe forest awakens. One by one, the giant trees reveal themselves, until one of the smaller ones approaches.\n“This is Gunnar. An old friend of King Lionheart, and the owner of this seedling.”\nGunnar recognized the seedling he held at once, and his guess was a natural one.\n“Lady from the far future, how come you have my seedling?”\n“It is not mine. I borrowed it from a future monarch.”\n“Is he the Lionheart King of our time?”\n“Yes, you recognize him?”\n“Our seedlings are not given to anyone by nature. The only one who might have it is my one true friend.”\nGunnar was a friend Leon had traveled with since his days as an acolyte.\nThey had been by each other’s side from the time he was a young Tree Man to the time he grew to become a Tree Giant, nearly 100 years later.\n“If Leon has entrusted you with a seedling, your will is his will.”\nLeon knows the value of this seedling: it is the “child” that the sages of the forest produce once in a lifetime.\nHe trusts that he would not have entrusted it to a woman who did not know such things.\n“Actually, the reason I’ve come to you is because this seedling is failing to grow, and His Majesty has deemed it worthy of your advice in this day and age.”\n“Hmm…If there is one possibility.”\nGunnar pointed to the seedling.\n“It is from the world of the dead. Its nature has been altered by the taint of paradise.”\n“Then…….”\n“It only grows in paradise.”\n“……!”\nThen Leon’s grand plan is undone. Leon had planned to grow it on Earth, and the effects had surprised even Beatrice.\nShould she give up? To Beatrice’s distress, Gunnar adds.\n“Perhaps there is a gift we can leave him.”\n“Are you going to do it?”\n“If that woman is to be believed.”\n“We are re-creations of the past.”\n“It is right to let you take it.”\nBeatrice glanced up at the echoing voice that shook the forest.\n“Do you have other plans?”\n“There is. Originally, I was going to take this hardship to the Lionheart King.”\n“He will accept it.”\n“It will require a ‘sacrifice’ from the gods and his priests.”\nThe sages of the forest insisted that it was a worthy cause, even apart from acceptance, and it was──\n“Shooting down the moon.”\n“The first hunter of the moon.”\n“Will sacrifice itself to create a new star season.”\n“And with it.”\n“Distill the essence that will complete the final Holy Grail.”",

      "content": "Chapter 132: Desecration of the Moon\nWar requires a lot of materials.\nFrom artillery to armor to barding to horseshoes to siege weapons…the list is endless.\nHowever, the Lionheart Kingdom has been at war for over 20 years.\nNaturally, all materials are in short supply, and there are not enough smiths to forge them.\nRecently, however, the shortage of smiths has become particularly acute. The reason was simple.\nThe Allied forces have grown too large.\nThe number of soldiers has grown rapidly, and the number of smiths has not.\nTechnically, there were not enough priests to serve the God of Iron and Blacksmithing.\nOnly the priests of Heto are able to forge stardust in the Lionheart Kingdom, which draws in stars every comet cycle and forges them into stardust.\nAs a result, a large number of skilled Heto priests are needed to supply quality stardust armor, and trying to make armor for the entire Alliance has its limits.\nThis was the biggest concern for Antoine, the Holy Knight of Heto, the God of Iron and Blacksmithing, and the reason why his transcendent strength made him live in a forge.\n“Oh…!”\n“Fast!”\nIn the forge of Heto’s shrine in the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods the gazes of the priests, who had taken off their hats and were busily working, were focused.\n-Boom! The smelting begins. Slot 3 is ready.\n-Cutting begins. High-density cutters are in place.\n-Grinding completion rate 62%. Multitasking up to 14.\nFast. And unflinching.\nEven the most experienced blacksmiths become cautious when it comes to handling and hammering molten metal, but this rookie blacksmith hasn’t hesitated a moment, working nonstop on the process of making the armor.\nTwelve hours into the process although there are still some finishing touches to be done, Yappy has stacked over a hundred suits of armor.\nTen times the speed and dozens of times the work of a skilled blacksmith!\n“Impressive.”\nAntoine, the head of Heto’s temple, was impressed by Yappy’s fast and steady work.\nThe quality of the goods themselves aside, the production capacity was far superior to his own.\n“Impressive, newcomer. It’s like watching one of Leon’s students.”\n-Hmm?\nAt the mention of a familiar name, Yappy turns the camera eye. But those mechanical arms are still moving.\n“Uh, excuse me. His Majesty Leon. Do you know him?”\n-Our closest collaborator.\n“Collaborator?”\nA demon-slaying partner.\n“Oh, I’d love to be in on that.”\nAntoine knew that this unusual blacksmith would never lack for power. If it weren’t for the fact that he was the Holy Knight of Heto.\n“I’ve traveled with His Majesty Leon for quite some time, and I was on the path at the time.”\n-With the king?\n“Yes, indeed.”\nUnlike Leon, who held the title of heir to the Grand Duke, Antoine had walked the standard elite path, rising through the ranks of Knights and became a Knight of the Realm.\nHe was thirty years old when he met Leon.\n“A village on the fringes was falling apart. It was an urgent call for help from a village under attack by orcs.”\nBut it was so far out in the middle of nowhere that the closest they could get to them were Gildus and Antoine, who were walking the path.\nIt was there that they met Gunnar the Treeman, who was also traveling on his own spiritual quest.\n“It was quite a battle. There were more orcs than I expected and several great warriors. It was a defensive battle at best.”\nLeon showed up when the knights were desperate.\n“It was amazing, a young knight half my age slicing an orc warrior in half in one fell swoop.”\nGildus and Antoine were the elite of their time, traveling the paths of genius. What about Gunnar, who was naturally knightly?\nBut if geniuses of geniuses awaken as Holy Knights, Leon was above them all.\nHe was a superhuman of superhumans, with natural powers that would become legendary in history.\n“I see such talent in you.”\nAntoch suggested with a smirk to Yappy, who tilted his head.\n“How about it, would you like to be my apprentice?”\n-Hmm?\n“I will teach you the godly art of hammering, passed down from the god Heto!”\n-…….\nYappy was silent for a while. It wasn’t that he didn’t understand Antoine’s words.\nIt’s because he knows from big data how to effectively ignore his opponent in a conversation between organics.\nAfter a moment of silence Yappy scanned him over from head to toe.\n– You?\nHe used an emoji that, if Ha-ri had seen it, she would have protested, asking how an inert camera-eye could look so dismissive of a person.\n“You… don’t know who I am?”\n-I do.\n“You do?”\n-Organic, at best. No match for the efficient production capacity of this machine’s perfect process.\n“…….”\nAntoine, who had been speechless for a while, chuckled at the absurdity of that statement.\n“What a blacksmith!”\nHe was the Holy Knight of Iron and Blacksmithing. How could he not take offense at being so lightly dismissed?\n“I’ll show you that it is not for nothing that I seek to teach you.”\nAntoine held up his hammer and Yappy recorded its movements, even as he immersed himself in his work to compare them to his own mechanical movements.\n-Bang!\nThe hammering begins. At first, Yappy took it in stride.\nGrind, cool, tap. As the work continued, Yappy gave it an honest rating.\nPerfect. From the snap of his wrist as he swung the hammer, to the timing of the cooling of the heated iron. Yappy was sure he learned these skills in a primitive foundry.\nBut no. If movement, timing, and honing are perfect, so is Yappy. He could do this forever.\nBut what about Antoine? He’s human, after all, and mistakes happen.\n-Bam!\nThere was a slight dissonance when hammering on the iron. It was a split-second sound that even a skilled blacksmith wouldn’t recognize, but for Yappy, it’s a big miss.\nHammering more than necessary would cause cracks inside and detract from the crucial completeness. After all, Antoine was a human──\n-What?\nYappy looked at the hammered iron and sensed a miscalculation. However, contrary to his expectations, the uniformity of the iron hadn’t wavered in the slightest. Rather, it seemed to be thirteen percent better that even than his own polishing──\n“I like your flawless work, too. Your output as a blacksmith probably doesn’t compare.”\nContinuing his hammering, Antoine said.\n“There was a retired priest of Heto who was forging a sword. The old man didn’t seem to have the strength to hold a hammer, but when he did, he produced a sword more beautiful than any other.”\n-Bam!\n“So I learned. Perhaps that’s how I was chosen by Heto.”\n-Bam!\n-…….\n“It’s an art, my friend. The iron art of carving out the soul. There is a realm, I believe, where mere perfection of technique cannot do it.”\nThere was still a lot of work to be done, and it was only a framework, but this was enough for Yappy to calculate the armor of the future.\n-0.01%.\nLeon’s armor is still unfinished and that alone was not enough to receive the blessing of the gods, so Yappy was still trying.\n-It will be done!\nYappy was certain that this man, with his skills, would definitely produce a 100% perfect armor.\n-Since my big data was incomplete, I feel the need to register the organic technology as part of my knowledge.\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about, but in short, you want to be my apprentice?”\n-No, just to observe the technological development of organics──\n“Follow me, apprentice!”\n-Not a disciple. Organic matter is no match for my machine’s perfect production rate.\n“Lord Antoine, His Majesty has sent a messenger.”\nGillingham, the Holy Knight of Thunder has come for Antoine.\n* * * *\nBeatrice soon joined Ha-ri’s party.\nAt her side was Gunnar, the Sage of the Forest, who once again formulated the plan for the Last Grail.\nThe plan itself had been discussed once before but Leon had denied it.\n“Very well. I’ll do it.”\nBut Isabel took it coolly.\n“High Priestess Isabel… this is not a matter to be taken lightly.”\nGillingham looked at her with concern but she shook her head.\n“Look, knight. Do you think you can do it if His Majesty wants you to charge single-handedly against a legion of demons?”\n“……if it is His Majesty’s command.”\nBefore you can question the order, you simply believe it. For the knights, Leon’s word was enough.\n“So am I.”\n“…….”\nIsabel accepted, not out of chivalry, but because she trusted the judgment of an agent of the Ten Thousand Gods.\n“But this is not a matter for me alone to accept.”\n“The Moon Goddess would have to approve.”\n“Yes. Perhaps she would approve.”\nIsabelle smirked as she looked up at Leon, the man who had ordered her to die.\n“Your Majesty.”\n“……Say it.”\n“Your Majesty, the choices you make lead to the future, right?”\n“Yes.”\n“That is enough.”\n“…….”\n“Old Man Wood, explain your plan.”\n“First, we’re going to shoot at the moon and drop its debris. It’s basically like attracting stars.”\nThe first step is to secure the lunar fragments, and the second is for Holy Knight Antoine of the Iron and Blacksmiths to break them down and extract them.\nWith the extracted moonstone, Gunnar and the other sages of the forest will create the essence for the Grail.\nTo do so, they must first split a portion of the moon but Isabelle shrugged even though she is the first victim.\n* * * *\nThe ritual took place at night in the center of the pantheon, the place closest to the moon.\nThere, in the presence of the Grail Guardian and Holy Knights, the High Priestess of the Moon kneels and prays.\nThe Priestess of Purity prays to the great moon. She asks for permission and forgiveness for the grave sins she is about to commit.\nThere were two people who heard the voice.\nIsabel, the priestess, and King Lionheart, the agent of all the gods.\nThough the Moon Goddess cursed the Lionheart King for breaking the chastity of her priestess decades ago, that is now a thing of the past.\n[Hahaha.]\nThe Moon Goddess chose to allow her own divinity to be diminished.\nThe Priestess of Purity stands up, barefoot on the cold floor. She thanks the Goddess for her generosity and asks no forgiveness for the blasphemy she is about to commit.\nIn her hand is a great bow, bigger than the tallest moon hunter. It is a divine bow that is more than adequate to shoot the moon.\n“I can’t believe I’m about to commit such a blasphemy.”\nThe Last Grail Plan was devised by the Sages of the Forest.\nA plan to enhance the Holy Grail’s functions to better suit the Great War, focusing on religious ritual and restoration.\nLeon rejected it, however, because of the many sacrifices it would require.\nAnd among those sacrifices was Isabel, High Priestess of the Moon.\n“But I didn’t think you’d change your mind.”\n“I’m sorry.”\n“No, you don’t have to be, brother-in-law.”\nIsabel pulled on her bowstring with a brilliant smile. She knew.\n“You may be the bastard who took my sister’s virginity, but as king, you’re not one to make lapses in judgment.”\nTechnically, it was a matter of emotion when he locked eyes with the moon goddess Castile.\nHer sister would have been happy. It was blasphemous to the goddess, but Isabel was content with that.\n“I guess I’m not the star of this story.”\nWhite flames rose in the night sky as holy power rose into the sky.\n“So…for this one scene, I’m going to put on my best face!”\nThe distance to the moon is 385,000 kilometers.\nThat’s a lot of distance. It’s so far away that the shooter doesn’t even have the energy to try.\n“Let’s make the shot! Let’s commit the greatest act of blasphemy in history!”\nBut this century’s greatest marksman issued a clear challenge to the planet she serves.\n-Kaaaaaaaah!!!\nAccompanied by a gust of wind the inexhaustible power of a single arrow creates a gale and a roar, propelling the arrow forward.\nThe Goddess of Moon and Purity is not inherently a combat-ready deity.\nHowever, for those of her followers who are forced to live outside the confines of their homes, she has given them one power: Hunting.\nThe archer’s gift to shoot and hit, and the High Priestess is an archer in the extreme.\n“K…!”\nHer aim at the moon falters.\nIt was a sin that should have her hand cut off for even aiming at the one she served. How blasphemous to even attempt to shoot at it.\nIt was a grave sin that even the goddess can’t forgive, much less the worshiper herself.\nTears form in the corners of her eyes, whether from disrespect for the moon she served all her life or simply a physiological reaction to the frenzy.\nBut she can’t leave them behind. She is a person of King Lionheart, before she was the High Priestess of Purity.\nShe readies herself and releases the arrow charged with holy power but she closes her eyes because of the guilt.\n-Kaaaaaahhhhhh!\nA single arrow rose from the highest point on earth and burst forth like a comet, spewing flames of holy power.\nThe greatest blasphemy against the goddess, ironically became the beautiful Milky Way that adorns the night sky, pierced the moon in the distance.\n“Stand, you have succeeded.”\n“I really…pierced the moon.”\nThe trail of the arrow pierced the moon’s surface and the fragments of the moon visible in the night sky are a projection of the calculated future.\n“The Virgin…!”\nLeon shouts, and in that moment, her prayer reaches the heavens. It was the miracle of the Virgin reading the celestial currents and drawing him in.\nIt is directed not at a star, but at a fragment of the moon, and, guided by the goddess, it enters the planet.\n“Success!”\nGillingham cried out in triumph and Beatrice, watching, did the same.\nNow all that remains is to safely drop the moon shard into the Ten Thousand God Temple, and let Antoine, the Holy Knight of the Iron and Blacksmiths, extract and process the stardust from the moon.\n“Kulk…!”\nThat was it. Isabelle, who had performed the miracle of shooting down the moon, collapsed in a heap of blood.\n“Isabel!”\nLeon rushed to her side, but her injuries were not light.\nIsabel was pouring blood from holes all over her body. No wonder. She was the High Priestess of the Moon and Purity, and for her to have shot and maimed the Moon meant that she had offended the Moon’s very deity.\nAs a saint representing the moon, it was a blasphemy that fed back to her.\n“Damn… that hurt like hell. Still… Dinah gave me feedback. Alas, she is merciful.”\nIsabel kept her tone light, even as blood poured from her closed eyes. Leon hugged her.\n“It’s all right, my dear. You… did well.”\nLeon knew this would happen, which is why he thwarted the Last Grail plan. He would rather die with honor than on a battlefield where failure and defeat were certain.\nBut if they are nothing more than a replayed record of the past it was his duty to leave something for the future.\n“Thank you, Isabel. I’ll take your share of the burden.”\nLeon waited for the next shard of moon but,\n“Your Majesty, the shard’s trajectory is… changing!”\nThere was someone else watching the action in space.\n“Immense…power!”\nA blast of blue magic pierces the sky, enough to light up the ground.\nIncomprehensible to human understanding, it would have driven the mages of the Empire insane with its ferocity had they witnessed it.\nIt was a magical event of horrific proportions.\n“You didn’t…! You closed the gate?”\nBeatrice gasped in horror as she realized the master of the power.\nThe same being who had sensed the rift in the dimension and closed it in an instant was now pulling at the moon’s fragments.\n“Ah, ah, ah……!”\nThe Great Priestess sobbed. Her job is to pull the lunar debris to the planet.\nOnce it is pulled to the entered coordinates, the gravitational pull of entering the planet’s atmosphere takes over.\nAs such, she is powerless against the force that would otherwise alter its trajectory.\nBut who could have predicted that?\nWho would have thought that there would be a monster that could pull a huge fragment of a planet that had already entered the planet’s orbit, using nothing but magic.\n“The orbit of the fragment… is completely off.”\nThe pulled lunar fragment landed in the wrong place.",

      "content": "Chapter 133: Stardust Transport Mission\n“We’re going to send in a detachment.”\nIt was an urgent decision.\nWith the moon’s fragments now in the wrong place due to demonic intervention, Leon had ordered a special squadron to retrieve them.\nMother Anak chimed in.\n“It’s going to be dangerous. I don’t think the demons knew what we were doing, but they knew something was up.”\n“I know. But that moon fragment is an opportunity that High Priestess Isabelle risked her life to create. We must secure it.”\nYes, there was no giving up. Even for the sake of the future, Leon cannot choose to give it up.\n“The good news is that the Star Iron is a mass of pure holy power, and most demons will be destroyed at the mere touch.”\nA stellar summons that strikes only the evil without doing any damage to the good.\nIt traveled through the atmosphere and annihilated over two hundred thousand demons. The greatest violence a divine power could unleash.\n“I don’t think this king will be able to do it himself.”\n“Of course not…! Your Majesty, leave it to me, I will retrieve the shards!”\nLoxley flared up at the prospect of Leon taking matters into his own hands.\nThis is an allied army, and this army will not return without Leon.\nWith less than 200,000 troops, why wouldn’t ten million demons attack at once?\nThe Holy Knights are said to be super-powerful, but they have the Grail Guardian, the Lionheart King, above them.\nIf Leon is killed, the Alliance will fall at once. This was not a gloomy prediction or assumption, but a clear truth.\n“Lord Antoine.”\n“Speak, Your Majesty.”\n“The fragments of the moon that Priestess Isabelle shot will not be able to be disassembled except by the priests of the Iron and Blacksmiths. You will take charge and lead a detachment to secure the fragments.”\n“Your Majesty, how much discretion am I allowed in the composition of the detachment?”\n“Two saints. We are a small force, so I want the best of the best.”\nAntoine looked a little troubled at that.\nHe understood Leon’s concern for the safety of the detachment. But if two Holy Knights were missing, how would this place be defended?\nThe presence of the Holy Knights somehow balances out the outnumbering by a factor of dozens.\nWith the recent disappearance of the greatest Holy Knight of all, Sir Vulcanus, how can they──\n“Your Majesty, is it not possible for you to order the Archduke of Dragonia to return?”\n“I cannot. The Archduke and the Northern Army have made their choice. I cannot enforce it.”\nThe members of this coalition are nominally equal, but that doesn’t mean they’re actually equal.\nThe Lionheart is the absolute symbol of this alliance, drawing in the survivors and being its greatest practical force.\nThe Northern Dragonia Army, however, is a different story.\nLong ago, the Archduke of Dragonia, who founded the Lionheart with the first Lionheart King, was a Dragon Slayer who slayed many of the kingdom’s greatest enemies.\nFor this reason, the First Lionheart King made Dragonia a semi-independent Grand Duchy, making them an eternal ally.\nThey were the voice of the North and a barrier against the barbarians. The Lionheart Kings can never treat the Archduke of Dragonia as lesser.\n“Archduchess Karina will not return.”\n“In that case, Your Majesty.”\nAntoine said, continuing the previous topic.\n“Please allow me to include those who have joined the coalition this time.”\n“You mean those brought in by Lord……Gillingham?”\n“Yes. From what I hear, they have unusual skills, especially the woman named Beatrice and the half-breed named Yakt Spinner. They will be of great assistance.”\n“…….”\nLeon pondered for a moment; only he knew that they were saints and saintesses ordained by his future self.\nThey have real lives, unlike his own, which are merely recreations of the past.\nHe wanted to get them out of here intact with as little risk as possible, but…….\n‘It’s not fair to waste two Holy Knights.’\nHan Ha-ri and Chun So-yeon are also strong at the level of master, but they are not comparable to the Holy Knights.\nThey should be able to deal with any threats on their own.\n“It’s a race against time. Hurry, secure the moon shard and return home.”\n* * * *\nTwo companies of five hundred knights and a company of freemen light cavalry rode toward the moon shard at lightning speed.\nLionheart’s steeds had the stamina to last three days on the road, and even the horsemen, who considered them the pride of their country, could not help but be stunned by the monstrosity leading the way.\n“Lord …….Is that really a creature?”\nOne knight’s question was legitimate. So was Antoine’s.\n-Diverse!\nEight steel legs pacing the ground as a spider of steel, dozens of times larger than Lionheart’s steed was racing at a speed of eighty kilometers per hour.\nThe strange creature of steel, never seen before in any continent or kingdom, had to slow down to keep pace with the steed behind it.\nThe answer to that question was simple.\n“He is the chosen knight of the god Heto. He has been sworn in as a Holy Knight by Arianna, and that is enough.”\nThe Knights of the Lionheart are notoriously rigid and inflexible, but they are infinitely flexible at the command of the Lionheart King and the choice of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.\nHis Majesty has commanded it, and you’re going to protest?\nChosen by the gods, how can a mere creature know the depths of their will?\nAs long as it’s not something as bizarre as converting demons or swearing in orcs as knights, the knights are ready to accept anything.\nThe only people who stand by Yappy, the odd man out, are Sir Antoine, who is fascinated by his abilities, and Beatrice, his original companion.\n-Bam!\nYappy stowed the drones with depleted batteries in the fuselage and flew a secondary drone reconnaissance team, bringing up a holographic map that integrated and mapped the surrounding information.\n“Oooh… What kind of trick is this?”\nLord Antoine approached, admiring the 3D map, which detailed the terrain and forest views and Yappy made a smug sound.\n-An integrated reconnaissance system that could not be realized by barbaric organics. The excellence of this device is unrivaled.\n“Haha, no wonder. You’re an all-rounder, my disciple.”\nYappy looks a little unhappy with Antoine’s remarks.\n-Suggested name correction. You are only a technology provider. You do not possess the intellectual capacity to impose disciplehood on me.\n“Hahahahahaha!”\nAntoine laughed merrily, patting the mechanical leg of Yappy twice his height.\n“Looks like we’re getting acquainted, huh?”\n“Does it seem so?”\n“There aren’t many people on my side of the world who can talk to Lord Yappy like this.”\nYappy tends to treat most of his opponents mechanically. He’s friendly to a point, but it’s hard to tell if it’s friendly or just a one-sided joke.\nIn that sense, it was refreshing for Beatrice to see Yappy unable to resist Antoine.\n“Since you are the embodiment of rationality, Lord Yappy, it’s no wonder you covet Antoine’s skills.\nIs there something that connects the Holy Knights of the God of Iron and Blacksmith’s?\nBeatrice wished she had met Sir Jerea when she first opened the gate the other day.\n“My lady, I’m sure you’ve noticed.”\n“Yes, he is strangely unobtrusive.”\nIn addition to Yappy’s search, the cavalry had been scouting the area.\nStill, there’s no sign of movement as they make their way to where the moon fragment fell.\n“There’s no way they’re letting this go.”\n“They’ll probably start attacking when we start mining the shards.”\nThe question is, how many demons, and what level of demons? But I don’t think they’re expecting three Holy Knights in this squadron.\nAfter a long day of traveling, they reached the spot where the moon shard had fallen.\n“There it is.”\nThe shard of moon that had fallen had created a huge crater, but it was still intact and glowing.\nA shard the Moon Goddess had allowed to diminish her divinity and that had been shot down by her priest, even as she threw her life away.\n“Let the extraction begin.”\nAntoine approached the moon shard and began to pound it with his hammer and chisel.\n“Lord Spinner, come and help.”\n-Bam!\nAntoine and Spinner along with a dozen blacksmith priests worked together to dismantle the stardust from the moon shard while Beatrice manipulated the defensive measures and set up camp.\n‘If I were them, I would attack at this time.’\nThey would take advantage of the defenselessness of extracting stardust from the moon shard. Now, the success of the shipment depends on how effectively they fend off the attack.\n“Set up camp and prepare for battle. This is our most vulnerable moment.”\nThe good news is that they have an overwhelming advantage in information warfare.\nA hundred or so Free People light troopers are constantly scouting the area and Yappy’s drones are on long-range surveillance missions.\nNo matter how stealthy they try to be, we’re sure to catch them.\nThe problem is their size since the demons’ numbers are beyond imagination.\nEven the kingdoms of the gods were helpless before the waves of demons that are now multiplying infinitely through the Demon Gate.\nBut in the face of this overwhelming disadvantage, they could still hold on.\n“Only three Holy Knights can be dealt with by overwhelming force. The difficulty is how many high-level demons are coming.”\nThe demonic forces are so numerous as to be overwhelming. That means there are plenty of high ranking demons to command the barbarians, demon followers, and lesser demons.\n-Boom! Enemy movement detected. Bringing up holographic map.\nYappy, who was still mining the moon shard, picked up the enemy’s movements with a drone.\nThe hologram shows black blobs targeting the flanks of the entrenched troops.\nBeatrice deftly flicked her fingers to zoom in, confirming the monstrous spiders she’d seen before, as well as the werewolves with their freakishly large molars.\n“Looks like they came as fast as they could with a mobile force.”\nAboard the monstrous spiders and werewolves are vaguely familiar goblins and miniature demons.\nBeing three or four times the size of a warhorse, these creatures are intimidating by their sheer size alone.\n“They’re coming! About thirty thousand!”\nThis side is small, sending only their best cavalry, while the demonic side is overwhelmingly superior in numbers.\n“Gunners, ready to shoot!”\nThe freemen light cavalrymen raise their arrows and the arrows shoot out and hit the spiders at a distance of over five hundred meters.\n“That’s amazing, is this some kind of magic?”\nBeatrice asks in admiration, and a knight at the next table replies cheerfully.\n“They are longbows blessed and crafted by the priests of Heto. They can pierce even the tough skin of orcs.”\n“I thought you disliked ranged weapons, but you’re surprisingly good at running an army.”\nThe knights scratched their cheeks in amusement at the comment but they had to continue giving commands.\n“Javelins!”\nEach of the knights pulled out one of the spears on their horse’s side. Unlike their assault javelins, these were sharpened for throwing.\n“Shoot!!!”\nThe knights channeled their energies into their spears and fired them at the horde of monstrous spiders. The javelins exploded with a terrible sound.\n-Kiie-e-e-e-e!\nThe monstrous spiders let out a screeching roar, whether they had read the unusual aura or sensed their own doom. The next moment──\n-Puck! Puff-puff-puff-puck!\nThe spears thrown by the knights pierced through the monstrous spiders.\n“Those whose offensive power is weaker than a bow cannot become knights. That’s why ranged weapons are inferior.”\n“I know that very well from His Majesty.”\nBeatrice grinned while Yappy, who had been mining, joined the offensive.\n-Drone firepower. A saintly firestorm begins.\nThe Yakt Spinner doesn’t just make armor in the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.\nYappy, who can create tools wherever and whenever he needs them, made a bunch of holy bullets for himself.\n-Toadadadadadadadad!\nThe bullets rained down with a terrible roar.\nComing from the flesh of a living saint, each bullet is imbued with holy power, inflicting fatal damage to the demons.\nYappy’s hypervelocity machine guns are more effective than the arrows of the freemen.\nAntoine marvels at the source of this monstrous machine, but he has yet to see his true power.\n<Spell Enhance>, <Double Trigger>, <Elevate>, <Triple Enhance>──\n“And this?!”\nThere were familiar spell formulas but the caster was an otherworldly magician queen.\n──Interpretation. Remake Magic\n“Lamantha’s thunderbolt… was it?”\n-Bang!\nA giant thunderbolt fell from the center of the magic circle and caused a huge explosion in the middle of the monstrous spiders but that’s not all.\n──Interpretation. <Widening the Area of Effect>, <Diffusing the Area of Effect>.\nHer delicate fingers danced like a conductor in front of an orchestra.\nEven on horseback, her grace is not impaired in the slightest, and the lightning that falls scatters in all directions as if representing her will.\n-Quack! Quack! Quack! Kwah!\nThe thunderbolts explode out from where they fell. It stretched out in all directions, connecting like the legs of a monstrous spider.\n-Poof!\n-Kwazik!\nThe monster spiders whose flesh was unable to withstand the instantaneous heat created by the lightning passing through, exploded like bombs.\n“This is amazing…Even the Imperial Prefects would not be able to perform such a huge magic.”\n“The level of mages in this world is not bad at all. They just evolved in a destructive way to counter the Holy Law.”\nYes, obviously, the magic of wizards, including those of the imperial prefects, is not inferior.\nSo what is it about this magician-queen who can interpret and apply the principles of their magic just by looking at them?\nAntoine has no way of knowing, but he cautiously speculates that she may be an Archmage descended from the blood of an Imperial Prefect.\n-Kiiiiii…….\n-Kieieieie!\nTen thousand units of monstrous spiders flinch from the terrible firepower of the enemy.\nThere were a thousand casualties before they could even get close, it was no wonder that they were terrified.\n“Now that we’ve broken the enemy’s spirit…I’d like them to hesitate a bit longer.”\nBeatrice hoped to buy them as much time as possible, but they would try to close in, and hand-to-hand combat would be essential.\n“If that’s all they have, we can stop them…but of course it’s not all.\nAs Beatrice had predicted, in the distant sky was beyond Yappy’s range eyes moved, watching the battalion mining the moon shard.\n[Send in the troops, we will wait for them to finish mining the shard]\nIn the clouds of the expanse, demons flapped their wings.",

The knight raised his shield, but the troll’s momentum was too much.\n“Come, you ugly beast…!”\nThe Kingdom Knight’s voice was ferocious as he braced himself for the impact to come. The troll was charging at him with the intent to blow the knight, who was shorter than him, away, when──\n“Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\nSomething whizzed past and in an instant, the troll’s head disappeared like a popped balloon. The torn nape of its neck reeked of charred flesh from the high heat.\n-Enemy Dangerous Object Sniping in progress. Twelfth target adjustment.\nYakt Spinner, the iron-blooded war machine that fires supersonic railgun rounds is the center of coordination on this battlefield.\n“Well done, Lord Yappy. I’ll clean up the mess.”\nIf Yappy is the sniper, hitting the enemy where it hurts, then Beatrice is the artilleryman of the last line.\nArchmage <Destroyer’s Eye>\nHer specialty, the Archmage class spell, triggers in rapid succession. The Magician Queen’s magic is an absolute firepower that can overturn a hopeless numerical disparity of 500 to tens of thousands.\nThere’s more.\n“Kie-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e?”\n-Chulp!\nThe monstrous spider that was charging toward them collapses on the spot but it’s still alive, its veins pulsating.\n-Ki, ki, ki──\nThere’s no way to know the expression on the giant spider’s face, but it’s clear that it’s in pain and the culprit was the purple fog that spread across the battlefield.\nUnleashed by the High Priestess of Dreams and Death, Beatrice, the fog is dragging demons across the battlefield into an endless pit of nightmares.\n-Why not use the power of death?\nYappy realized that Beatrice could have turned that mist into a death fog, and death would have been preferable to nightmares.\n“Sometimes a ‘crazed ally’ hurts more than a dead ally.”\n-Hmm?\nBeatrice’s finger flicked through the air as a crisp, clear sound echoed through the air and at the same time, the demons in the dream woke up.\n-Kiiii…!\n-Kiyaaaaaaah!\nThe behavior of the waking demons was bizarre: they drooled as if they were still in a dream and began to attack everything in front of them.\n-Kiiiik?!\nThe demons from Beatrice’s nightmare had turned on their closest allies.\n“They’re trying to kill the nightmare monsters so they don’t die in their dreams,” she says, keeping them half-awake.\nAnd those nightmare monsters are the ones next to them.\nIf Beatrice is causing nightmares for an unspecified number of demons and adding chaos to the battlefield, the higher-ranking demons that can resist her power will be sniped by the Yakt Spinner with his Holy railguns.\nIndeed, the Holy Knight was demonstrating battlefield dominance.\n“That’s it!”\nAntoine and the priests finish the three-hour extraction.\n“Let’s get going, they’ll know soon enough!”\nAntoine blew a bugle call to the outlying companies, and the riders acted quickly.\n“Mount the horses in the rear! Let’s get out of here fast!”\nThe freemen riders quickly mounted their horses, and the last of the knights who had kept their horses dust-free scattered their holy laws and went in search of their horses.\nIn the chaos of the battlefield, there was no rider who could not find his horse. Lionheart’s wise steeds recognized the whistles of their comrades and rode swiftly to them.\nLess than thirty seconds after the call to retreat, the detachment was ready to go.\n“Full speed ahead!”\nAntoine, Yappy and Beatrice sprinted to the front while the horses of the others followed.\n-Pursuit interrupted. High firepower temporary focus.\nYappy carapace short-range missile silo opened, sending one missile flying into the air with a clang.\nThe rockets, handcrafted and blessed by Yappy himself, circled through the air before landing squarely on the demons, causing a chain reaction of explosions.\n<Radiant Heavenly Beetle>\n-Thwack! Quack!\nCombined with Beatrice’s high-powered thunder, the demons are stunned.\n“Run!”\nFrom the clouds of dust and natural disaster, the Star Corps roared, their steeds speeding along at a pace not unlike that of modern Earth’s automobiles.\n“They’ll catch up, but they won’t get there before us.”\n“Let’s hurry, they’re not stupid, they’ll catch up-─”\n───────\nIt came from the sky without warning, and the only ones who noticed its presence before the attack were the Yakt Spinner, who kept his radar running at all times, and the knights with their superior instincts.\n“”Melt before the fires of hell.””\nA barrage of fireballs tinged with green quickly descended on everyone.\n“……!”\nBeatrice’s hand reached up to the heavens, her great magic unfurling against the five falling infernal flames.\n<Super Elemental Cancellation>\nHer magic intervenes with the infernal power and in an instant, the Queen of Magic, the world’s most powerful magician, cancels half of the spells unleashed by the Great Demons.\nAnd to rephrase that.\nHalf of it fell toward the soldiers.\n-Kaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nA huge explosion rocked everyone from all sides.\nAfter the dust from the explosion cleared, it revealed a sea of blackened corpses.\n“… Lord Yappy, report the damage…!”\n-Eighty-Eight Knight dead. Freemen light cavalry destroyed. Injuries unaccounted for. Five enemy Archdemons. Database searched.\nYappy knows them. They were the agents of a disorderly quest that, in the distant past, invaded the world of the highly advanced Yakt Spinner and caused more damage than any other demons.\nThe evil Knowledge Demons who unleashed a disease plague upon the world, called the Wisdom Treasury.\nWith the head of a beast and the wings of a bird—the Archdemons of wisdom and inquiry appeared.\nThe masters of wisdom, the highest of the demons of wisdom flapped his wings and looked down upon them, and soon uttered a terrible cry.\n-Kiaaahhhhhhhhh!!!\n-Kiaaahhhhhhhhh!!!\nIt is the voice of a demon that leads living things to their doom.\nJust as the Holy Knights protect living with their mere presence, so the voice of the Archdemons drives humans mad with their power.\n“Crack, crack, crack…!”\n“Ear, ear…!”\nEven the Kingdom Knights could not withstand the demonic voice of the five Archdemons.\nAlthough there were three Holy Knights, the curses of the Archdemons were more powerful than their protection.\n[Insignificant mortals]\n[Mortals against immortals]\n[Foolish ones, do you not know that your foolishness will lead you to your doom]\nThe Archdemons descended to the earth while Yappy responded and Beatrice cast her magic but they are Archdemons of the highest order, demons of wisdom.\nThey parry Yappy shots, bind Antoine javelin to the space and negate Beatrice’s magic.\nThree Wisdom Archdemons were enough for that while the other two spewed curses at their enemies and swept through the Kingdom Knights.\n“Ugh…! Run!”\n“Come to your senses, stop your horses’ ears and run, the ‘Iron Will’ is with you!”\nAntoine’s booming voice carried a holy power, a blessing of fortitude that would break but not bend, and the knights answered the command.\n“Horses first!”\n“Hold fast, comrades! We must get out of here together!”\nThe knights covered their horses’ eardrums with earplugs, and when that didn’t work, they pounded on their eardrums.\nIn their pain and panic, the horses gradually regain their senses under the familiar touch of the knights.\n“Let’s go!”\nThe gallop resumed despite the demonic power of the Archdemons as their indomitable will and infinite trust propelled them onward but the demons continued their pursuit.\n“Watch your step!”\n“Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!”\nThe Knights of the Realm were snatched up into the air by the sharp claws of the Wisdom Archdemons.\nSoon the knights were falling from the sky defenseless and they crashed to the ground.\n“Lord Yappy”\n-Initiating an aerial assault.\nBeatrice and the Yakt Spinner, with their formidable ranged firepower, respond but the five Archdemons are as powerful as their age-old wisdom.\n[Annoying.]\n[That girl, the depths of her magic.]\n[But not so much that we can’t counter it.]\nEven with the two of them on the defensive, the Archdemons swooped down on the knights with the maneuverability of their wings at the same time as their magic.\n“Endure, as long as we reach the allied forces, reinforcements will come──”\nA loud explosion rang out all too clearly in the chaotic battlefield even though Beatrice’s defensive magic was clearly present and even though all of Yappy’s computations were clearly detecting the surroundings.\n[You will not escape]\nBehind the backs of the Wisdom Archdemons, with their backs to the sun, the demons pierce the most troublesome Holy Knight of Steel.\n“Lord Yappy!”\nYappy crumbles, his carapace pierced. Not even the most powerful metal of the gods in this place could hold back the demon’s magic.\n-Database. Identify destruction object──\nYappy cameras focus on the worst demon lord of all time, who has destroyed the most advanced technology and led the world to ruin.\n-Demon Lord of Wisdom and Inquiry──Caracael.\nThe end of the world.\n* * * * *\nBeatrice was horrified at the smashed fuselage of a Yakt Spinner.\nThat fuselage of Yappy is a high-strength body made entirely of stardust and even she had trouble destroying that body in a mock battle…….\n‘There’s a difference between being strong and being a magician.’\nAs a magician queen herself, she didn’t even feel any magical omens.\n“Lord…….”\nThere was no mistaking it. That snake-headed demon is the Lord of the Demons, the demon of demons, the pinnacle of all evil.\n-Kie-e-e-e-e!\nDemons swarmed in from all directions while the knights march was halted and with the arrival of the Lord, their numbers have multiplied.\n“Alas…….”\n“Is this the end…….?”\nThe knights who did not give up even with the appearance of the Archdemons dropped their swords at the hopeless spread of evil.\nThe endless malice of the Demon Lord is a malice so deep that mortals cannot stand against it.\nIt’s the end not only for the soldiers and knights, but for Beatrice herself.\n“Lord Yappy…are you alive?”\n-Yes…….\nYappy emerges from the shattered fuselage. His body had thankfully not taken a direct hit from the magic.\n“As I understand it, your world… has been invaded by demons of wisdom and inquiry. In this situation…what do you think it’s our chance to escape?”\n-Zero. Even with the Queen’s leap magic, not a single person could escape.\n“Haha…….”\nBeatrice knows how strict this machine is with probability. She knows that its computational power is far beyond human comprehension, overwhelming even modern Earth civilization.\n“Hmm, you mean there’s zero chance of escape.”\nAntoine stepped forward and asked.\n“Miss Beatrice, what is that leap magic?”\n“It’s an application of gate magic… well, more accurately, it’s a leap through space into the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods but I can’t use it right now.”\n“Why?”\nBeatrice remembered that when she first entered this gate, something had forced it to close.\nAnd she knew that it was most likely the Demon Lord magic that closed it.\nIn other words, as long as the Wisdom Lord is present, spatial leap is impossible.\n“I see. In other words, we just need to get rid of that damn bastard, right?”\n-???\n“???”\nWhat the hell was that? Yappy didn’t understand the organism’s words in this hopeless situation, where even he had given up on the victory.\nAntoine picked up a hammer, a short hand mallet that he used to sharpen his weapon.\nAntoine flashed his hammer as all the knights and freemen stared at it.\n“My proud brothers and sisters! Thank you for your service to the gods and the kingdom, for all these years!”\nAntoine sees the people of the realm looking at him, and he realizes the oath they have taken.\n“You have sworn to defend the kingdom with your lives! Today, at this moment, keep that oath!”\nNone of them knew what it meant.\n-Die.\nIt was just that, a command but with that unreasonable command in front of him-─\n“”I will obey!!””\nThey made an unreasonable choice.\n“Hold the line!”\n“Lord Antoine must be sent back!”\nMade the most irrational choice.\n-Impossible. Organisms. You could throw them all into the dumpster and have zero chance of success.\n“Maybe. You’re smart so you won’t say anything wrong.”\nAt that moment, a burst of holy power erupted from his body.\n“But there are more important things in this world than odds.”\nSuddenly Antoine’s consciousness was cut off from the world.\n[Cease, my blacksmith, do you intend to waste your life here?]\nThe divine voice that had always been with him. The divinity that had been with him at his lowest point, that had given him the gift of iron, had rebuked his knight.\n“I would have done so no matter who came.”\nBut even the gods could not dissuade the stalwart knight from his resolve.\nWhy do the gods love them?\nWhy do they protect the Lionheart?\nBecause they are beings who would die for their beliefs because the spark of life was so beautiful.\n“I, Antoine, Holy Knight of Iron and Blacksmithing, guardian of the mines and the kingdom’s finest smith!”\nThe hammer, once pointed toward the future, stops.\nNow it exists only in the present.\nThere is no future for the blacksmith anymore. Even so.\n“An oath of iron, here and now.”\nIt is the dazzling future that the hammer is aiming for.\n────■■■■■■■■■■■■■■\nThe change was dramatic.\nA wilderness filled with the malice of demons, transformed in an instant into a sacred shrine, a land of steel.\nHis mere presence reshapes the landscape, and his every movement stretches out to erase the black stain, as if to denounce the world’s venomous malice.\n[……No way.]\nEven the Demon Lord groaned before the mighty divine will.\nIt was a divinity of boiling steel that only a human who embraces the divine will reach and an infinity that regular humans can never reach.\nDivine Descent “Iron Blacksmith”\nA being radiating light from its entire body looked up into the sky.\n“Fall first.”\nIn the next moment, the Demon Lord and the Archdemons plummeted to the ground.",

If it were just turning dirt into steel, it would have been a bit of a spectacle.\nBut\nThis is no mere trick of the eye.\n[My lord. That is──]\nThe landscape changed with the Iron Oath.\n[That’s not the end of it.]\nCaracael looked at the humans, small as earthly worms, but there was a presence that made even a Demon Lord like himself nervous.\nLayers upon layers of the highest magical barriers that would make even the Magician Queen cringe, preparing for the enemy’s actions. But Caracael felt uncomfortable.\n“Fall first.”\n[────!!]\nThe next moment, Caracael and the Archdemons realized they were being pulled by something.\nIt was an overwhelming gravitational pressure, far beyond planetary gravity that crashed the Archdemons who were flying with their wings.\n-Kaaaah!\nAll the evil beings who were arrogantly flying in the sky crashed to the ground.\nReversal of gravity? Generation of attraction?\nNo, these are not laws of physics.\nHoly Knights are lawbreakers. They rewrite the laws of the world according to the divinity they believe in.\n[Iron and Blacksmiths.]\nCaracael willed his magic.\nAlchemy <Shapeshifter>\nThe artifacts containing ‘iron’ that he wore all over his body had their nature changed.\nWith that, each and every one of the artifacts that were dimensional treasures were reduced to useless trinkets.\n[Lord…!]\nThe Archdemons changed the nature of the trinkets on their bodies to follow the Lord’s lead. These are artifacts they’ve worked so hard to create, but they can’t help it.\nAll the ‘iron’ in this holy place is controlled by them.\n[Indeed, your judgment is swift, fiends]\nThe timbre of the voice was not human.\nIt was not merely a change in appearance, but a change in content.\nHe had taken on the nature of gods in his human body.\nHoly Law──\nThe pupils of the Archdemons’ eyes filled with horror.\nUntil now, the Holy Knights’ holy power had been centered on their bodies but now, that knight is changing the landscape itself, radiating an infinite amount of holy power.\nIt is the beginning of a miracle that seems to have gathered the power of the entire world.\n<Heto’s Hammer>\nA glowing hammer is swung. The hammers carved into the landscape fall toward the demons.\nGreat Magic <Shield of Amancha>\nThe barrier deployed by the five Archdemons is a formidable one, a great wall of invincibility that can never be broken. But──\n-Bang!\nThe hammer smashed through the barrier and crushed the demons. With a single blow, the two Archdemons burst into horrific shapes.\n[What…!]\n[This can’t be happening!]\nDemons of Wisdom and Exploration, masters of magic casted an absolute defense by using a formula that was perfected after tens of thousands of years of research by sages with the highest magical power.\nHowever Antoine broke not one, but five of them at the same time?\nTheir bodies tremble from the terrifying attack that makes them want to deny reality.\nThey know they won’t survive the second attack but worst of all, even those who just survived that blow seem to have been shaken to the core.\nIt is terrifyingly strong. How can mortals who can’t even live a thousand years possess such great power?\n[Surprising]\nAnd yet the Lord of Wisdom is alive and well.\n[…….]\nAntoine clicked his tongue at the strength of the demon that had been struck by the direct hit. The nearby Archdemons had been crushed, but the Lord had taken the blow and was unscathed.\nThe absolute strength of the destructive power wielded by the Iron Concept had transformed the moment it met its barrier from a bending of the laws to a mere blow\n[Let it begin, the greatest battle of this century is yet to come]\nWith a wave of his hand, Caracael activated the magic circle carved into the expanse.\n* * * * *\n-Kiie-e-e-e-e-e!\n-Forward!\nThe forces of evil cry out. Forward.\n-Strike!\n-Hold on until the magic is complete!\nThe forces of righteousness call out.

The aftermath of his hammer blows against the Demon Lord is enough of a disaster for them.\n“…….”\nBeatrice watched them go, building her magic circle.\nIn the battle of the Demon Lord against Divinity the demons and freemen were swept away and killed by the aftermath alone.\nIn the midst of a battle that artificial intelligence had determined to be a dead end, they had blossomed into a miracle.\n‘It’s definitely gotten easier.’\nBeatrice’s magic staff was still constructing a simple gate to leap through space.\nIt was a spell that normally wouldn’t be possible with Caracael intervention but the Lord of Wisdom was too busy battling the Divinity of Iron and Blacksmithing to pay attention to this.\n“Lord Yappy, how’s the work progressing?”\n-86% progress.\nBeatrice was in such a hurry that she entrusted Yappy with a magic circle that she would have done entirely with her own hands.\nBut she’s not willing to compromise her prudence for a one-time opportunity. If it’s just a matter of drawing a magic circle and she trusts Yappy to recreate it perfectly from data.\n“The moment we deploy the magic circle, he’ll know it’s there. We need a way to buy time until Lord Antoine returns.”\n-Suggested.\nYappy explained the plan to Beatrice, and she nodded.\n“What are the odds of success?”\n“2.714%.”\n“That’s much better than before.”\nThey were hopelessly low odds but knights are willing to throw themselves off a cliff of 0%. Then──\n“As a magician who’s supposed to be sober, I shouldn’t say this, but…… let’s pray for a miracle.”\nShe, too, was a miracle worker and a saint in the service of God.\n* * * *\nCaracael magic poured forth and each one was a disaster: earth crumbling, heavens splitting, the end of the world.\nWith a wave of his hand, he conjures up horrific disasters that no mortal can withstand.\n[Strong]\nBut not the Holy Knight. No, the hammering of the blacksmith, a god himself, crushes the Demon Lord’s magic.\nLightning bolts are absorbed by the hammer and hurled back, and flames rising from the ground are contained by the iron earth.\nBefore the Demon Lord is a saint who performs one miraculous feat after another.\nIndeed, the strongest species in the dimension and the most powerful creature on earth, feared by even the demons.\nNo wonder Demon Lord Glacier chose to flee from Randolce Plain.\nIf even the Holy Knight of Iron and Blacksmith is this good, what kind of monster is the Grail Guardian, their pinnacle?\n[The pinnacle of your kind, he must have the power to defeat a lord.]\nHe admitted it but that’s why this invasion was the right thing to do.\nIf these monsters were to increase in number and eventually spread their divinity throughout the dimensions, the demons would not be able to withstand and would be defeated.\nThis was a dimension with humans so beloved by the gods.\nThey were worthy of love, worthy of strength. But──\n[Not enough. You cannot reach me.]\nThe humans, after all, were a vessel too small to contain the full power of the divine.\n[End of analysis. Die.]\nCaracael was about to shoot a deadly spell.\n-Diversify!\nA mecha approached through the chaos of the battlefield. It was the stellar iron hull of the Yakt Spinner, which Caracael had pierced.\n-Self-destruct sequence initiated. Core forced to runaway.\nAt that moment, Yappy’s fuselage forced its own power reactor to explode, a fission reaction far beyond the technological capabilities of Earth humans.\n-Kuwaaaaaaaaaaah!!!\nA massive blast of heat and explosion engulfs Caracael. For a moment, the light from the explosion engulfs the world and blinds him.\n[A nuclear explosion… such a primitive prank!]\nCaracael unleashed a new spell with his left hand, even as he deployed his right.\nThe vast explosion was compressed and contained, like being sucked into something.\nCompressing a simple thermal blast is as easy as breathing for him; it would take at least a divine flame to strike him.\nA low-level nuclear fission would be blocked with a single finger of magic.\n──────!!\n[Hmm?]\nThat was it. The explosion was gone.\n[My lord! They’ve opened the gate!]\nIndeed, they had. Caracael stared at the silvery woman who had opened the gate.\nThe human understood how the gate worked.\n[You’re going to run away.]\nVery few can travel through a short-range leap gate and Caracael realized that they plan to abandon all the soldiers and knights here.\n[Arrogant, did you think you could escape me?]\nAt best, Beatrice’s short-range leap gate could be closed immediately with Caracael magic. But──\n“Destroy the evil species!”\n“Protect with your life!”\nThe Holy Law of Flame swings toward Caracael but that’s not all. The knights hurl their holy spears enhanced by the holy power of the land at Caracael.\n[Abandoned ones, indeed…!]\nCaracael parried their javelins, releasing the thermal energy contained in his left hand. Combined with his mana, a terrifying explosion of what could only be described as a mana nuclear explosion hit them.\n[Too late. But──]\nThanks to this, the gate could not be closed and Caracael stretches out his right hand, which was building up his magic a moment ago.\nA beam of death rushed towards the people throwing themselves towards the gate.\n* * * *\nA crack appeared in the center of the city, and the gate opened.\n“Whoa…!”\n-Whoosh!\nPoured out of it were three people and a horse.\n“It… worked!”\nBeatrice was relieved that she had managed to escape and Yappy updated the database with this miraculous achievement.\n“Hmm…….”\n-Hmm?\nA groan was picked up by the high-powered sound system. The pulsation of the thumping heartbeat they’d been picking up earlier faded.\n“Lord Antoine?”\nBeatrice stares at him, noticing the anomaly as well.\nThe Holy Knight of the Iron and Blacksmiths stood steadfast despite the gaping hole in his heart.\n“Apparently…it wasn’t perfect.”\nAntoine scratched his head, even as he stared at the dripping blood.\n“Lord Antoine, hurry up and treat him…!”\nBeatrice tried to help him up, but Antoine waved her away.\n“Go to the forge.”\n“What?”\n-What?\nEven as the two stood there puzzled, Antoine strode toward the forge carrying the moon shards that had cost the lives of many soldiers and knights.\nArriving, he picked up a hammer from the forge, ignoring the sound of the blacksmith priests.\n“From now on I will forge stardust.”\n-Unavailable. Your life activity will cease shortly.\n“It was ordained from the moment you descended from divinity into mortality.”\nIt was a miracle only a living demigod with a Lionheart could have pulled off.\nOnly a living saint could maintain that temporary miracle o, to put it another way, in this fleeting moment Antoine is a “dying demigod.”\n“Holy Knight of Iron, time is running out for this master, and he has only one chance to teach his pupil.”\n-…….\n“I will show you once. This is my first and last lesson.”\nAntoine raised his hammer.\n-Bang!\n“I set out on the path to receive the quest.”\nEven if his missing heart can’t produce oxygen.\n-Bang!\n“Along the way, I met the future Lionheart King, and we shared an honorable journey.”\nEven if his trembling arms can’t power the hammer.\n-Bam!\n“I was taught by the greatest blacksmith of all, and I challenged him.”\nEven when his bloodshot eyes can’t even see.\n-Bam!\n“In the end, I did not surpass him, but my sword-bearers have slain the enemies of the kingdom, and my spear-bearers have defended it.”\nHe didn’t doesn’t stop but moved slowly and intensely, as if to inscribe each movement.\n-Bang!\nThe iron is forged with the divine will.\nHis every action is history.\n“I have shared glory with the greatest of kings, the Lionheart King, and I have been loved by the gods and honored beyond measure.”\nThe hammering continues.\nHis blurry vision now turns to the next blacksmith.\n“Put your faith in iron. Imagine the future you will create with your hammering. The sword you forge will cut down the kingdom’s enemies, and the armor you forge will protect your comrades.”\nHe throws his hammer, a very old, worn, saccharine hammer with the history of a blacksmith.\n“A weapon is a tool for killing, but in the right hands, it is a shield to protect the world.”\nMay the sword and shield you forge protect the world.\nThe holy power in his body scatters as the life force he’d held on to is gone, and his hair has faded to a blazing white.\nHis crumbling body leaned against someone else’s, unable to keep from collapsing.\n“…….”\nHe felt a heartbeat and Antoine knew who it belonged to.\n“Is it Sir Leon…….?”\n“Yes, it is Lord Antoine.”\n“In a man’s arms…Gildus would be disgusted if he saw it.”\n“Who would doubt a man with children?”\n“That too.”\n“And your son… do you have any words for Aren?”\n“…….”\nThe words made Antoine pause for thought.\nHe was a great father, a loving husband, and a brilliant teacher.\nHe had given his son love, respect, and instruction, so if he had anything else to say-─\n“To the end. Defend the kingdom, defend the king!”\nJust his life’s attitude.\n“…….”\nLeon sighed, staring at the flame of his friend that had been extinguished in my arms.\n“I’ll tell him your last words.”\nIn Leon’s 85th year Sir Antoine, Holy Knight of the Iron and Blacksmiths ascended.",

      "content": "Chapter 136: Leaving a Legacy for the Future\nThe forces of evil advance like stains that darken the sky and taint the earth.\nSlowly and steadily they cover the surface of the earth.\nThe scouts watching them cover the ground in horror are overwhelmed by the sound of their heavy breathing, shaking the heavens and earth.\n“……This is the end of the world.”\nThe enemy’s march, which can only be described as horrific, is not the march of a well-organized army.\nTheir clicking fangs and bloodshot eyes reveal their poverty.\nThe potions the demons of wisdom and inquiry brew are vile narcotics that cloud even the soul but it gave them an insatiable hunger so much so that they would die to satisfy it.\n“I see the traits of the Chaos Demons. Twenty years ago, I remember a race of distinctive horned beings.”\nThe head of the Order of the Gifted remembers well those horrible things that destroyed the Empire.\nThe Chaos Demon Lord and his legions were the first to invade this world but that’s not all.\n“Truly…the end of the world.”\nTwenty-three years ago, the emperor of the Empire summoned the Demon Lord.\nThe system was destroyed, and the entire Empire crumbled in an instant.\nEventually, the Lionheart King appeared and defeated the Demon Lord of Chaos and his forces, but it was only the beginning.\n“I thought that with the Lionheart King… we might be able to win.”\nWalter, leader of the Gifted Division, the survivors of the Empire, felt his will break in the face of destruction, only to see it finally arrive.\nHe was no knight of the gods.\nHe knew honor and loyalty, but he was a man.\nThe only thing that has kept him going so far is the miraculous presence of the Grail Guardian, who will save them in the end but the endless hordes of evil were too much to overcome.\nThe destruction of mankind is certain, and they themselves will soon die.\nIt was said that when a person dies, they are taken to the paradise of the gods… but if there are no humans left to worship, can that paradise be maintained?\nWalter pushed his thoughts to the back of his mind and rode his horse to the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods.\n* * * *\nHoly Knight Antoine has ascended.\nThe news of the Holy Knight’s ascension and the deaths of most of his comrades spread throughout the city.\nSome wept, some mourned, and some were numb as they waited for their turn.\n“Your Majesty, it is Gildus.”\nAn aged knight entered the king’s tent urgently and the king greeted him.\n“Lord Gildus, is Lord Galleon with you?”\nLeon turned to see the younger knight following close behind Gildus.\n“Yes, Your Majesty. It’s been a long time since we’ve seen you.”\n“Never mind your Majesty. Call me uncle.”\n“My, how could I…….?”\nThe grumpy Kingdom Knight, Gildus, chided Leon.\n“Your Majesty, he’s being spoiled.”\n“What. I’ve been taking care of him since he was in diapers. I am his godfather.”\n“And Sir Aren?”\n“On a scouting mission. I informed him of Sir Antoine’s ascension, but he said he could not abandon his duties.”\n“Uplifting, like his father.”\nLeon was both pleased and saddened by his uprightness since he wanted to share his last moments with his son.\n-Thump! Thump!\nJust then, a sound that could not be ignored rang out from outside the tent. It was the sound of a giant “wooden giant” moving, its steps seemingly angry.\n“The entrance is small.”\nLifting the tent, the wooden giant entered.\nThe Tree Man sage laid out a suitable seat and sat down.\n“Good job moving your heavy ass.”\nGildus said playfully, and Gunnar replied.\n“I do not have what you might call an ass, old friend.”\n“Paraphrase, so that I may understand. For a sage, you’re not so stupid.”\n“Oh, that’s not what I want to hear from a drunken knight charging at a windmill.”\n“Why are you talking about something that happened seventy years ago, and I’m not the only one who got screwed over, but I won!”\n“You beat that again?”\nLeon looked at them and remembered a long time ago.\nWhen he was still doing his quest, he had met three people.\nThe knights Antoine and Gildus, and the tree man Gunnar.\nThey had met on their way to save a village from an orc attack.\nThese long-standing friendships are surely a blessing.\nA friendship so old, it won’t be strange if one of them leaves.\nSo there is no need to be sad.\nIt’s just a parting of the ways.\n“Antoine was an old friend of ours. I thought for sure Gildus would be the first to go.”\n“I thought so too.”\n“What, you’re making fun of me?”\nThe hard-boned commander of the kingdom’s Warnights grumbled in front of his friends who had gotten too far.\nLeon took over.\n“What a blessing it is that his last days were spent in glory and honor, and it is only right that we, his friends, should bid him farewell with love and friendship.”\nGildus raised his flask.\n“To our friend Antoine!”\nGildus gulps down the entire bottle.\nGalleon worries for his father.\nGunnar had never understood the drinking culture of the humans, and had used the fruits of my body as a substitute for a toast.\nThe ceremony was short, and ended with enough mourning and love.\n“We must now continue his legacy. Gunnar, how do you like the finished product?”\n“It could not be more perfect. The blacksmith god has blessed it well enough.”\n“And the will of the forest?”\n“The sages are united in their opinion. We will now distill its essence and place it within.”\n“I am ever grateful for the service of the sages.”\nLeon hid his sadness in his gaze then called to those waiting outside.\nAnak, High Priestess of Light along with Holy Knights Gillingham and Loxley and Balter, the leader of the Imperial Gifted Knights, and Captain Steelhammer, the leader of the dwarven survivors of the Steel Mountains. The Rangers of the Fairy Folk, who coexist with the Tree Men and tend the forests.\nIt is now time for a military ceremony.\n“Sir Walter, the demonic forces are advancing?”\nIn response to Leon’s question, Walter answered with a reverent bow.\n“Yes… the armies that broke out of the castle are on the move. We have confirmed the demonic survivors of the Sloth of the Randolce Plains, the hordes of the Beast God’s Cultists… and the Fallen of the Empire.”\nThe enemies of the Alliance were coming from all directions.\n“Estimated numbers?”\n“Ten million…….They are marching here with all their armies.”\nTen million, it’s a number that freezes you to the bone just hearing it.\nIt was so unreal that it left them speechless, but it was a reality they would have to face someday.\n“The end is near. Prepare for battle. They’ll be here soon.\nThe final battle of mankind is about to begin.\n* * * *\nThe Great Wall is not a fortified city by nature.\nIt is a religious shrine that spans continents. It lies at the very center of the Lionheart, alongside the Royal Castle.\nWith a Holy Knight and a High Priestess to guard it all the time no madman would ever try to invade it.\nIt was the closeness of the gods’ power that made this religious shrine a fortress in the first place.\nThe collective power of the gods, known as the All-Seeing Eye, provides direct backup for the worshippers, allowing them to be more powerful than ever before.\n“We can’t just rely on the walls. We must be prepared for a war of attrition.”\nHoly Knights Gillingham and Loxley, and the heads of their respective coalitions, took up positions overlooking the Great Temple and manned the bastions built into the inner walls.\nHa-ri’s men were also to be prepared for this battle, but they were spared.\n“Your Majesty, we want to help too…….”\nHa-ri voiced her opinion, but Leon shook his head.\n“You will wait in the main camp, where you will not be harmed.”\nLeon kept Ha-ri’s group strictly organized. He believed that either Beatrice or Yappy, both Holy Knights, had the power to save themselves, but not the other four.\n“Your Majesty… I have power, and the future… Your Majesty has recognized it.”\nChun So-yeon was also unhappy about not being able to fight.\nHa-ri, So-yeon were also true S-class power. They would be the mainstay of any attack anywhere.\nOf course, Leon had good reasons for his judgment.\nUnlike Leon, who was merely a recreation of the past, Ha-ri’s men were real people but even so, if they die inside the gate, they really die.\nThat’s why Leon excluded the four from the battle.\n“You have other things to do.”\n“Do what?”\n“Go to the recuperating High Priestess of the Moon and Purity, I’ve already told her.”\n“????”\nThe four tilted their heads in disbelief.\n* * * *\nLeon’s orders led the four to the depths of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods. This is where the seriously wounded are kept.\nIn the Lionheart Kingdom, most wounds and illnesses were cured by eating the Blessed Crops, so a doctor was usually a surgeon who treated those seriously injured in war.\nIsabelle, High Priestess of the Moon and Purity, was wounded in a different way.\n“Ugh…….”\nThe moment they opened the door, they felt the air flow differently.\nIt was a small private room, bare except for the frame of a wooden bed, large for a single person, small for two.\nThe smell of blood fills the room and the priestess, her white robes stained with fresh blood, speaks in a disgruntled voice.\n“……You should be resting.”\n“It’s okay, the king has given me permission.”\nThe voice sounded cool, but without its characteristic wholesomeness.\n“Come in.”\nThe voice’s owner waved the four inside.\n“Over there…….”\n“Why?”\nForgetting his usual lighthearted demeanor, Jae-hyuk looks at the woman sitting on the bed.\nShe was seriously injured, with crusts of blood everywhere and used bandages piled up one after another.\nThe deepest wounds are in her eyes.\nThe bandages, tied over and over again to cover both eyes, completely block her vision.\n“You must be… the High Priestess of the Moon?”\n“Yes, I am the first hunter of Dinah, goddess of the moon and purity. I’m Isabelle, second in line in the kingdom’s power hierarchy, with the Lion King as my brother-in-law.”\n“Do not lie to the young.”\nAt the words of the Goddess, Isabelle responds with an invisible wink.\n“I’m the only one with free hands, so I suppose His Majesty can’t help it.”\nThe Goddess smiles bitterly at Isabel’s words, and with that, she leaves the room.\n“Now, sunflowers, I’m sure you’re wondering why you’re here.”\nIsabelle giggled and even her bandaged eyes seemed to smile.\n“There are many gods in the pantheon, but there is a class of gods called the Lords, who are the most powerful, except in certain circumstances.”\nWith a snap of her fingers, a subspace opens up and boxes stack up inside.\nSome are large enough to take up half a bed while others are barely the size of a ring.\n“Arianna, goddess of light and justice, worshiped by all knights and the first deity of the kingdom.”\nIsabelle kicked the largest of the boxes open and light poured out of it.\n“A…room?”\nSoo-ho felt the power of the astonishingly brilliant light from within and Isabel continued.\n“Poma, god of the sea and waves. Petos, god of war and flame. Ultima, god of the sky and thunder. Water, fire, and lightning were considered the most feared furies of nature.”\nTheir power represents nature itself, and as such, they are the most powerful of all.\nA bracelet with a blue aquamarine gemstone.\nA lance with a heart of unquenchable flame, so brilliant it would burn at the mere touch.\nThere was no mistaking the identity of the things Isabel showed them.\nThose who had seen the hammer of Georgic and the relics of Leon up close could not fail to recognize them.\n“These…are they all holy objects?”\nIsabel replied with a wry smile.\n“They are the relics of past Holy Knights and Priests.”\nBy nature, when Holy Knights die, they ascend to paradise with the objects they used but there are also those who ascend, while laying down their relics for the sake of the kingdom.\nHeroes who left their treasures for the sake of the world in its most troubled times, through the Age of Dynamism, the Age of Orcs, the Age of Beasts, and the Age of Chaos.\n“This shield was given to me by Sir Amalek, Holy Knight of Light and Justice, two hundred years ago, and the fiery heart was given to me by Duke Renaud, Saint of the Saviors and Orc Undertaker, as he lay dying.”\nIsabel explained the history of each of the holy items and Ha-ri asked.\n“…Why are you explaining these things to us?”\n“Because you will inherit them.”\n“……!”\nThe four knew the value of the holy objects since the elusive Sir Georgic’s hammer has yet to find its owner but to hand over the holy relics of the Holy Knights and Priests so easily?\n“Do not misunderstand. You are not ‘yet’ qualified to handle these holy objects, and they do not recognize you.”\n“Then why…….?”\n“His Majesty seems to believe that you will survive so…I’ve decided to put the future in your hands.”\nIsabel doesn’t realize they are from another world.\nShe doesn’t know that they are inside the Gate, a mere recreation of the past.\nShe simply trusts Leon’s judgment and puts her all into preparing for the future.\n“You will use it better than I, who will soon be dead. I will pass them on to you but it’s up to you to make sure you’re recognized.”\nIsabel chuckled and spoke of death in a nonchalant manner and then──\n“There you are. You’re the one with the dark aura.”\n“……I’m Chun So-yeon.”\n“Then you… why don’t you do me a favor, something that only you, a follower of Mr. Ventasis, can do.”\n“????”\nWhile Isabelle performed the ritual of passing on the holy relics to future knights, the sages of the forest extracted the essence and prepared for the advance of the demons.\nKnights and soldiers from everywhere began to return for the final battle.",

      "content": "Chapter 137: The Final Battle (1)\nThe center of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.\nHere, closest to the sky in the city, dozens of sages trudged by.\n“Sages of the Forest the extraction ritual is ready.”\nHigh Priestess Anak greets the Forest Sages while Yappy places a goblet in front of her.\nIt resembles the Holy Grail but it was forged by Holy Knight Antoine to the last moment of his life.\n“The Holy Knight got it right.”\nOne of the sages of the forest marvels at the chalice forged from the shards of the moon and Gunnar nods in agreement.\n“My friend worked iron better than anyone. Now that he has done his part, it is our turn.”\n“I know, young tree.”\n“We will do our part.”\n“Now let those who remain do their part.”\nThe gazes of the forest sages fell upon Beatrice and Yappy. Then, one by one, they stare at the group.\nBeatrice spoke first.\n“Lord Yappy and I will support the front lines and stall as long as we can, while Miss Han Ha-ri and the rest of you….”\n“I’ll take over the succession of holy objects, and…….”\n-rallied to the point of commitment. The main force will join after securing the Moon Grail containing the essence.\nTheir role is not to change the history of this gate and lead it to victory.\nThat is a task that no being could accomplish, and they are a supporting cast, not a starring role.\n“We shall retire now, Mother Anak…….”\nUnder Beatrice’s gaze, Anak responded with a benevolent smile.\n“May the gods bless you.”\nWith that, Gunnar turned to watch them leave the temple.\n“High Priestess, you know, when we’re done with everything…….”\n“We’ll need a divine descent to finalize the essence for the new Grail.”\n“Leon has to command the front lines so it will have to be you.”\nAnak smiles at Gunnar’s words.\n“As the High Priestess of Light and Justice, it’s only fitting. If I can prepare for the future in this small way… it’s worth it.”\nHoly Mother Anak Protecia has not lived a life of glorious battles and honorable chivalry like many knights.\nShe has long lived in the shrine, reading scripture and teaching the Code, even after the Great War with the Demons began.\nAll she ever did was pray and wait for the bodies of the fallen.\nShe grieved for the many lives that had been shattered and realized that she could not do as much as her knights but she is relieved to know that she has a role to play in this final war.\nShe is glad that she can take the place of the Lionheart King for once.\n“May the blessings of light and justice be with him.”\nThe saint prayed for the King who will now throw himself into a harsh fight.\n* * * *\nIt was an endless army of destruction, an endless legion of evil that filled the horizon and beyond.\nThey built their despicable shrines on the ashes of the burned, and desecrated the last vestiges of civilization.\nEmpires have crumbled and kingdoms have fallen before them.\nEven the land of the Guardians of the Lionheart was down to its last bastion.\nLeon watched helplessly as the world threatened to tear apart like a bag of tattered wine.\n“Your Majesty.”\n“Lord Aren.”\nThe young knight approached, the son of a friend who had just returned from a mission, faithful to his duty even after hearing of his father’s death, there is a hint of his youthful adversary in him.\n“Be proud, Aren. Your father has died an honorable death and gone to the feast of the gods.”\n“Yes…….”\nBeatrice and Yakt Spinner, Han Ha-ri and Han Soo-ho, Kim Jae-hyuk and Chun So-yeon.\nThe past, which could never be reversed, heralded the end of the world, the end of an era of glory and honor.\nThe inevitable end would be replayed.\nWith a heavy heart, Leon stared at the assembled soldiers.\nThe thudding of the enemy’s marching feet filled their ears, and a mixture of emotions filled their eyes.\nHorror, fear, helplessness, and despair.\nAlas, Goddess.\nMaster of the Grail, who has given this insignificant creature the Lionheart, who has set the holy sword ablaze.\nHere are thy lambs trembling with fear.\nWomen soothe their weeping children and swallow their tears,\nand young men clutch the dying embers of war in their hands,\nand knights try to leave seeds of hope in the blood-soaked wilderness.\nBut you, lord of the holy sword, lance, and chalice.\nI know that your first knight will not be able to stop the evil that stretches beyond the horizon.\nGoddess.\nMy Goddess. What shall this foolish knight do?\n“Do as thou wilt.”\n“…….”\n“My knight. My dear, honorable knight. Your goddess be with you to the end.”\nLeon steeled himself.\nAt the age of twenty, he died and was reincarnated in the other world.\nFor more than a hundred years, he lived as a knight and a king.\nHis life was filled with honor and glory, even as it came to an end.\nThis life was not meaningless.\n“Hear, all honorable men.”\nIn the stifling silence, all eyes in the fortress focused.\nMen of kingdoms and empires, elves, dwarves, lizardmen with reptilian scales, tree men entwined with tree trunks, and even fairies who could barely lift a knife.\nFor this moment, this one moment only, they stared at the Lionheart King in silence.\n“………….”\nBut the longer the silence lingered, the more the rumbling of the earth pounded loud and clear in his ears, reminding him of an evil army that counting was pointless.\nKnowing the terror among them, Leon waited for them to fully recognize it, for they must choose between fear and terror.\n“Do you see it?”\nHis voice was hoarse, as if he’d been shouting for a while, but there was no one who couldn’t hear him.\n“Yes, we see it.”\nWhat they see is despair.\nThe inevitable end, a chaos that knows no bounds, a doom that will bring all things to their knees.\nThey are mocked as the evil does not cease to humiliate, not even over the ashes that remain after it has killed, destroyed, and burned.\nThe rumbling of the earth from the untold number of evils that stretched beyond the horizon drowned out Leon’s voice.\nThe moment they had despaired enough Leon mounted his horse and turned to face his men.\n“Do you hear the sound of those wretches who seek to destroy us all?”\nHe turned to the young knight and shouted.\n“Rage!”\n“Your Majesty…….”\n“Rage! Knight Aren, son of Antoine, the glorious Holy Knight of Iron, the honorable knight who slayed the great horned giant of the Darkwood Forest!”\nRage!\n“Warnight Gildus, hero of the Plains of Pelor, and his son Galleon, rage!”\n“Gifts of the Empire who defended your citizens from the endless armies of evil! Rage!”\n“Noble elven rangers of the Oak Forest! Rage!”\n“Armor-breakers of Iron Mountain against fire-breathing dragons! Rage!”\n“All honorable men of this age! Why do you not rage, why do you accept insults!”\n“”……?””\nLeon didn’t bother to stifle the chuckle and scornful sneer that escaped his lips.\n“Look at those disorganized beings of chaos!”\n“Rage as they deserve, those arrogant ignoramuses with the illusion of victory! Be infinitely angry!”\n“They fear us.”\n“They fear our spears.”\n“They fear our steadfast will.”\n“Behold the men of honor gathered upon these walls!!!”\nSoldiers and knights stood on the wall. All the survivors looked at each other.\nThose who had known each other only by word of mouth across the border realize that they are united under the banner of the Lionheart King.\n“They have a false faith. ”\n“That our courage will be diminished, that we will betray our brothers, that our dignity will be violated.”\n“Weary with fear, we will despair, gripped with terror, waiting for the beast of these men.”\n“But my brothers and sisters. Shall we submit to the ordeal today?”\n“Life may abandon us, but will we destroy our dignity?”\n“Though the seekers of evil may cry doom, shall our honor fall!?”\n“No, never!”\n“Our purity will not be tainted by their lust, and our honor overwhelms their infamy!”\nLeon drew his sword with his right hand and held the Holy Grail in his left.\nThe Holy Grail was a relic of the goddess who had been with Lionheart since its earliest founders. The brilliant light from the great relic enveloped them, warm as a fire in a fireplace.\n“Who am I!”\nDozens blurted out. Tens of thousands remained silent. Leon’s booming voice echoed through the crowd, drowning out their voices.\n“Gillingham…! Who am I!”\nGillingham, Holy Knight of Sky and Thunder, answered.\n“You’re the living demigod who represents the will of the All-Seeing Eye, and the guardian of the Grail!”\n” Loxley…! Who am I!”\nLoxley, Holy Knight of the Sun and Judgment, answered.\n” You’re the Lionheart King who beheaded the Lord of Chaos, Malus!”\n“I am the First Knight of the Goddess, the Lionheart’s Lionheart, and your brother in the last bastion of humanity!”\nThe terror in the crowd’s eyes began to dissipate as the Grail Keeper did not lose momentum.\n“Winter is coming, brothers.”\n“But do not tremble, and face the last winter with dignity.”\n“For our swords and shields are the cinders of a harsh winter.”\n“Burn endlessly until the last ember is extinguished. Burn the last spark!”\n“Today we fight here.”\n“This shall be their grave, and upon their grave we shall erect our monument.”\n“No honor or glory can compare to this!”\n“I call my brothers and sisters. Will you join me?”\nThe shouts of the soldiers rivaled the rumbling of the earth but Leon was not satisfied.\n“Will you fight with me?”\n-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAA────!!!!\n-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAA────!!!!\n-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAA────!!!!\nA thunderous roar overwhelmed the din.\n“Heroes of the world!”\n“Have each other’s backs!”\n“Tread the path of honor!”\n“I, Leon Dragonia Lionheart, will be your sword and shield!”\n“I command you to fight to the death, honorable knights!”\n“”King Lionheart! King Lionheart!!””\nMankind’s last stand has begun.\n[Quest: Survive the The Final Battle]",

Kakakakakakak!\nThe ground shakes and if it weren’t for the black specks rushing toward them from the horizon, they might have mistaken it for an earthquake.\n“Argh…….”\nWhen the Alliance had gathered two hundred thousand troops, Imperial soldier Heizen had hoped for victory in the face of such a powerful force.\nThe Holy Knights, repelling the forces of Chaos with transcendent force, and the Kingdom’s elite soldiers, slaughtering orcs alone.\nMost of all, the presence of the Lionheart King, who had defeated Malus, the Demon Lord who had destroyed the Empire, was enough to give everyone hope.\nBut the sight of ten million enemies marching in unison was enough to inspire fear.\nA black stain from the edge of the horizon dyed the entire world black until it reached the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods.\n[Listen]\nA half-man, half-horse walked out from among the black stains. The messenger approached with a loudspeaker, his followers having betrayed humanity and chosen to become the devil’s slaves.\n[Foolish mortals, throw down your weapons and surrender now, and the Great Ones will have mercy on you──]\n“Shut up!!!”\nThe demon follower didn’t finish his sentence. With a shout, a spear flew from nowhere and plunged into his heart in a parabolic arc.\n-Kwazik!\nThe javelin pierced through the demon follower’s heart and landed on the ground. At the sight of the slain demon follower, the legion of demon followers at the head of the line become distorted with rage.\n[Advance]\nThere was no negotiation. Demon Legion Leader Wolfhard, a former Imperial Prefect, shouted to his Demon Followers.\n“Fire the cannons!!!”\n-Bang! BANG!\n-Bang!\nThe shells rained down like thunderbolts, threatening to bring down the walls of the Ten Thousand Gods Temple in one fell swoop, only to be deflected by an invisible membrane.\n“…Empire bastards!”\nPriests and knights spread out all over the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods, and the Legion Technique enveloped the entire city.\nNo ranged weapon, no matter how powerful, could hurt the Allied forces.\n“I expected it. But we have many gifts for them!”\nWolfhard readied his catapult. Even if it was a catapult and not a cannonball, it wouldn’t do much to wound that barrier.\nBut he was a former Imperial Prefect. He was the commander of the Empire, and he was preparing to antagonize the kingdom.\n“Fire!”\nThis time, the catapult is pulled and something is thrown in unison.\n“As long as there are holy laws, ranged weapons are…!”\nThe catapults exploded just before they hit the barrier, sending bits of meat flying.\nNaturally, the soldiers who were covered in them soon realized their identity and gagged.\n“Ugh…!”\n“They’ll be damned…!”\nIt was a decomposed corpse. Rotting and gassy and bloated… as if warning them that this is what they would become.\n“Huh?”\nIt didn’t end with a warning. The bodies exploded in the air, spreading a foul green mist.\n“Do, poison gas!”\n“Cover your mouth…!”\nCorpses, enchanted with curses and corruption, exploded all over the walls. Poisonous fog began to spread throughout the castle.\n“Ew, ew, ew!”\nSoldiers fled from the fog. Those on the ramparts tried to climb down, and those below the ramparts tried to run into the city.\n“Form up!!!”\nThen, from all over the city, knights galloped on horseback. War Knights, knights of the highest rank, cleansed the poisonous fog from their horses and shouted among the soldiers.\n“Hold your ground!”\n“Hold the line!”\n“Priests of Life cleanse the gas in the northeast first!”\nThey are veterans. Knights who had fought evil for so long that they knew what they had to do on the battlefield.\nThe soldiers follow them rallying around the knights as they’re told and form a line against the wall.\nTaking advantage of the chaos, they pushed through the siege weights and siege towers.\n“Archers ready, artillery ready!”\nAllied archers and Imperial artillerymen lined the ramparts, their arrows and cannonballs loading.\n“Our weapons shall be a light of purification that pierces evil!”\nAt each rampart, a War Knight blesses them with the Holy Law.\nArrows are imbued with pure white light, and cannonballs are compressed into fierce flames.\n“Send them to the netherworld!”\n-Bang!\n-Bang!\nThe arrows of light fired by the archers pierced the demon followers, and the purifying light burned them alive.\nThe shells that landed amongst the legions spread horrific flames, scorching everything.\nThey unleashed a barrage of ranged attacks of their own, stripping their opponents of their ranged weapons.\nThe legions of Demon Followers retreated, terrified at the sight of such an unreasonable display of warfare.\n“Hold your ground.”\nWolfhard didn’t look at them. He slashed the throat of any soldier who fled more than three paces, forcing them to advance.\n“Let the siege begin!”\nHundreds of siege towers rushed in, each with a hundred thousand demonic followers.\n“Snipe the siege towers!”\nThe holy law of the knights rained down on the approaching siege towers.\nThunder crashed from the sky, waves rolled in from the dry air, and a massive pillar of fire slammed directly into the siege towers.\nDark knights rained down on the unharmed ramparts as the warlocks counterattacked, and giants made their way to the ramparts, taking the arrows in silence. Tree roots sprouted from the giants, choking them and dragging them underground.\n“Ugh, ugh…….”\nThis is no ordinary war. Wolfhard, in command of the first wave of troops attacking the Lionheart Alliance, feels like he’s fighting a natural disaster instead of an army.\n“Damn…!”\nHalf a day into the battle more than half of the four hundred thousand legionnaires of demonic followers in the vanguard had died.\nElectrocuted, blown up, killed by verbs, blown up, crushed, drowned, crashed to death.\nSo much death loomed before them that they knew it was a miracle of the gods, blessing only one side to the point of absurdity.\n[Poor thing]\nIt was then that a chill ran down Wolfhard’s spine at the sight of the great shadow.\n“Great One!”\nWolfhard immediately dropped to his knees and assumed a posture of submission. He had once made a pact with the devil, but in the real world, the Archdemons were all monsters.\nIf the Holy Knights are a disaster that cannot be defied, these are pure evil with unending malice.\nThe Caster of Prajna, a disciple of Caracael, the Demon Lord of wisdom and inquiry, pierces Wolfhard with his six-pronged gaze.\n[That’s a lot of troops]\n“Uh, that’s just the first round, the results are still…!”\n[When we kill one soldier, our side loses a hundred; convince them of this reality]\n“So, it’s a war of attrition!”\nWolfhard’s words caused the Archdemon to stop the arm that was stretching towards him. He hurriedly shouted out his strategy.\n“We outnumber them fifty to one, and with the exodus of the northern army that gap has widened, so I plan to wear them down with a wave of worthless demon followers!”\nDemon followers are trashy half-demons who never became demons but they would be enough to exhaust and wear the enemy down.\nWhat Wolfhard hadn’t anticipated was how quickly the legions of Demon Followers melted away.\n[He wishes he had hurried]\nWolfhard was not sure of the Demon Lord’s intentions. Their opponents are the Holy Knights and the army is led by the Guardian of the Grail.\nIt would be safest to take it slow and steady, even if it meant heavy attrition.\n[Rally the elite and bring in the slaves, he will back you up]\n“……Yes, I see!”\nWolfhard bowed low, realizing the implications.\nEver since his contracted Archdemon of destruction and murder had fallen into the hands of the monstrous orcs on the eastern front, he’d known he could be eaten alive at any moment.\nTo survive, he must prove himself useful.\n* * * *\nThe bombardment of the battlefield could be heard from where they were.\nHa-ri casually turned her head toward the battlefield and was struck with a stick.\n“Agok…!”\n“Never mind. This place has nothing to do with you.”\nHow could she hit her so precisely on the head without even seeing her?\n“You should get out of here. It’ll be over faster than you think.”\n“Yeah…….”\nHa-ri left the room, heart pounding and clutching the aquamarine bracelet on her wrist, and glanced at Chun So-yeon, whose eyes were still closed.\n“What is she doing anyway?”\n“I told her to.”\n“????”\nIsabel’s unintelligible words slipped through her fingers and she left the Temple. The war that started half a day ago is still being held at a leisurely pace by the city walls.\n“Gunnar said he could finish it in a day or two…….”\nThe problem is opening the gates. Beatrice is unable to open the gate because the Lord of Wisdom, Caracael, is interfering with it.\n‘Your Majesty, can you really defeat the Lord of Wisdom?’\nA Demon Archduke alone was such a monster, but how powerful was the Lord of Wisdom?\nThe reason she was so relieved was purely because in the original history Leon is an epic hero who has defeated Malus, Lord of Chaos, Dothradon, Lord of Pleasure, and Caracael, Lord of Wisdom.\nHe’s already defeated the Lord of Wisdom, and Ha-ri thinks it’ll be easy to defeat him again. …….\n-Kaaaaaaaah!\nHa-ri stares blankly at the sky that fills her vision.\nThere breaking through the clouds, crashing into the planet with flaming tails.\n“Ah.”\nSomething was wrong. No, she couldn’t believe it.\nMeteors were filling the sky.\nIt was stellar doom that could wipe out continents, nay, planets.\nHow was the king able to defeat such a monster?\n* * * *\nSixteen hours after the battle began eight doomsday lights shine across the night sky.\nCaracael, the Demon Lord of Wisdom, in other words, the lord of all multiverse magic, and the greatest of them all, across dimensions.\n[Interpreting planetary orbit. Initiating parallel connection, coordinate derivation.]\nHe attracted comets that should have passed this planet by now, and it goes without saying that it is the highest form of magic.\nIt’s no wonder that celestial intervention is called a miracle but he attracter eight of them, one on each finger.\nEight fingers out of his twelve intervene in meteors.\n[Initiating precision guidance. Automatically activating protective magic when struck. Strike with guided points.]\nMagic is imprinted on the world and an unprecedented grand ceremony unfolded in the land centered on the land where he sits.\nAn enormous magic circle, over 32 kilometers in diameter, spreads across the land and sky.\n[…….]\n[Great Master…….]\nIn the face of such unprecedented magic, even the Archdemons are nervous and uplifted. They cannot hide their emotions at the miracle carved into the night sky.\nSince the beginning of the universe, there has never been a greater wielder of magic, nor a sage who has composed a better formula.\nThe magical powers inscribed in the circles roar like a storm, and the earthly circles glow brightly as they connect with the celestial bodies.\nEach one a miracle that even the Archmages, the Casters of Prajna, cannot duplicate.\nLook up, lowly creatures.\nThis is the master of magic.\nThe only Archmage among the Immortals.\nThe originator of an evil older than divinity.\nCaracael.\nArchmage of the Planes. The greatest of sages.\n[I will leave nothing of you behind, crushed by the weight of the heavens.]\nThe cataclysm that marks the end of the planet descends through the atmosphere.\nIt was a reality so terrible, a reality that would make even the demons on their side turn away.\nGods.\nProtect us.\nAt that moment the eyes of the Allied troops, screaming at the nightmarish reality, turn to a place at the front lines of the siege, to a watchtower on the ramparts.\nThere, a golden one holds a sword.\nIt is the white of a goddess with a pure white mane.\nThe goddess’s gift to the greatest Grail Guardian of all times.\nA knight with a Lionheart, golden gauntlets over his white skin and on the back of a noble beast that had never been ridden by anyone else, flashes a holy lance.\n“Burn. Flame of all battlefields.”\nAt that moment, all the flames of the world erupt in a fierce blaze, a flame so fierce that it threatens to cover the world.\n“Lord Vulcanus?”\nSomeone called out. But in front of them is an agent of the All Gods.\n[Intervening in the flames?]\nCaracael marveled at the power of this ‘God Punisher’.\nIt interferes with all the fires of the world. It’s amazing that it’s not just size or destructive power, but the concept of actually interfering with “all the flames of the world”.\nAnd where the fiercest flame in the world burns meteors are breaking through the planet’s atmosphere and falling to earth. The meteors, which would normally be incinerated upon entering the atmosphere, are protected by the magic of Caracael. It is called a\n──■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■\nburns more fiercely as a mere spark from atmospheric friction was transformed into a divine flame.\n“The star burns!”\nIt was a flame so huge that can be seen from the ground engulfing the falling stars and the melting stars shrinking in size in real time as Leon calls out.\n“Loxley…!”\n“Yes, Your Majesty!”\nThe copper-armored knight at Leon’s side obeys and Leon turns to him.\n“Shoot down any pieces that might damage the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods. We don’t need to worry about the uninhabited lands.”\n“On my mark!”\nLoxley’s holy sword slipped from its sheath. His holy sword glows a brilliant gold.\nHe was the Holy Knight of the Sun and Judgment but with the sun no longer rising, he brings a new sun to this night sky.\nDivine Punishment <Sunrise>\nAbove the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods the rising sun absorbs the flames of a falling meteor in an instant.\nSensing that his sun has absorbed enough thermal energy, Loxley points his sword and shouts.\n“Inquisitor of the Lionheart Loxley punishes ugly malice!”\nSunlight shoots toward the falling meteor fragments. The fierce light becomes a terrible heat wave of its own, piercing through the falling pieces.\n-Crack, crack, crack!\n-Boo, fire, fire, fire…!\nIn the process, the demons and their followers exposed to the sun’s flare melted.\nThe Grail Guardian and the Holy Knight.\nLooking at the two monsters in front of him, the Wisdom Lord smiled.\n[Enough with the greetings, I suppose]\nTwelve fingers began to spew magic.\nOnce more twelve comets entered the planet’s orbit and in response the guardian who controlled the flames of the battlefield also raised a sun.\nThis was a battle of monsters.",

      "content": "Chapter 139: The Final Battle (3)\nIt’s the end of the world.\nThat’s what everyone thought.\nA meteorite falls, and a giant flame consumes it. The sun absorbs its energy and shoots it down.\nBeings beyond the limits of humanity.\nWhat thoughts do mere mortals harbor when faced with the clash of heaven and earth?\nWhat are the feelings of foot soldiers stabbing each other with swords and spears at the edge of an apocalypse where the atmosphere splits, the earth bakes, and the clouds of the sky evaporate?\nAnd yet.\nIt’s not the monsters of the heavens and earth that set the stage for this battle.\nMeteors and the sun are just triggers for war. In the end, it’s the infantrymen on the ground who carry the war.\n“Get up there!”\nDemons scramble up the walls, their bodies burning from the falling meteors and the aftermath of the sun that honors them.\n“Stop the fucking bastards!”\nSoldiers dropping and stabbing such creatures to death, as the knights who command them wield the power of concepts from the walls, and War Knights… War Knights of the highest rank, deploying the Legion Techniques.\nGildus, the First War Knight of the Lionheart Kingdom, looks down on the battle for the end of the world with a cold eye.\n“Over a hundred meteors in three days. The land is becoming uninhabitable with nothing but debris.”\nWill the land remain intact after this war? Even with the efforts of the Goddess of Earth and Fertility, it will take many years to recover.\n“It doesn’t matter. I don’t look back. Even if the planet evaporates and the continents are cooked, we who are protected by the Lionheart King will survive.”\nThe land has become such a maw, then, that they don’t care about collateral damage, only victory.\nWarnight Gildus stretched out his arms. His booming voice echoed throughout the city.\n“Thicken the defenses of the city walls! Knights of the Dawn, Knights of the White Rose, mount your horses and charge!”\nKnights in gleaming armor dismounted from their horses and climbed the walls. Armed with stardust swords and armor, the knights reached the ramparts where the siege tower had broken through the terrible conversational power.\n“Kill them!”\n“Kill them all──”\nThe gates of the siege tower burst open, and just as the demonic followers were about to pour out, they jumped back.\n“Argh!”\n“They jumped into the siege tower──!”\nKnights are all-around warriors and even without the power of the Holy Law, they are specialists in armed warfare, and they single-handedly cut down a hundred demonic followers.\n“…Kingdom bastards!”\nWolfhard, a former Imperial division commander, trembled at the overwhelming power of the knights.\nIn the three days since the start of the fight the million-strong army he started with was practically melted away.\nThree days! A million casualties in three days!\nThe insane attrition rate was driving Wolfhard mad.\n‘My troops don’t even obey my orders anymore.’\nWho else is going to follow orders to charge into a maw that eats everything that lives?\nEven if they had an additional million men charging at once, would they be able to overcome those walls?\n‘We need to send in the high ranking demons! Even a simple war of attrition will only result in a one-sided defeat for this side!’\nWolfhard was about to ask the Caster of Prajna to give the order to mobilize the troops.\n[I can see you’re getting tired, mobilize the 1st through 20th legions]\n“……!”\nThe Demon Legions are a devastating force of over 100,000 demons each. Moreover, each legion was led by an Archdemon.\n‘Damn it…! We’re expendable after all!’\nWith the Wisdom Lord tying up the Lionheart King and the demonic followers being consumed, the allied forces were becoming exhausted.\nAnd now with over a million demonic followers expended, the demonic legions that had been using them as arrowheads to build up their power marched forward.\nThere was an army of thousands of terrifying high-level demons alone.\n“Enemy Archdemons appeared!”\n“Destruction!”\nAmong them, a fighter with huge horns, thick legs, and torn wings revealed a presence that could not be ignored.\n“Big…….”\nIts harsh breath burned away the oxygen. His arms, hard and thick as iron, pound the earth, and his head is lowered.\nThere was no mistaking that this was the precursor to a charge, a crushing charge that will crush everything in its path.\n“Here it comes…!”\nThat’s the signal, stomping the floor.\n“Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee……!!!”\nThe echoing roar is breathtaking but the priests have responded.\nFire spells rain down and thunderbolts fall from the sky but the priests are caught off guard by the enemy’s unexpectedly fast charge.\n“Chet, we have to stop that charge!”\nThe Knight of the Sea and Waves raises his trident and charges the holy law. Waves poured from the dry air, blocking the Archdemon path.\nThe wave was not a point, but a plane, and the moment it struck the fiery demon, it burst into steam.\n-Kaaaaaah!\nSteam frosted the battlefield but the Archdemon leapt through the watery mist and landed on the ramparts.\n“Oh, it’s up!”\nIt was a cow-headed red monster that could not have been more hideous and was exuding ferocious momentum.\nBy the time they realized it was there, dozens of soldiers had already been cut down by the giant greatsword.\n“Damn…!”\nThe knight of the waves who had tried to stop the monster charged at him with his trident. The knight on horseback is one of the few who has ever managed to parry a charge.\n“Fuck you…!”\n-Bam!\nThe greatsword and trident clashed but in the next moment, it was the trident that broke.\n“…….”\n“Krrr…….”\nAt the split-second clash the knight crumbled along with his horse. Even the knights couldn’t keep their unity in the face of the Archdemon violence.\n[That’s all you got, tin cans!]\nThe Archdemon roared and the roar was enough to drive the soldiers to despair.\n“Shut up! You filthy bastard!”\n[……?!]\nWith a poof, something leaps up and swoops down on the Archdemon. The demon’s greatsword, which traveled over three meters, swung out to block it.\n[Haoh…….]\nThe impact of the clashing swords and the impact beyond the swords makes even his mighty arm shake, and the demon gives his opponent an intrigued look.\n[Strong, I wonder if there’s ever been a stronger knight besides the Holy Knight.]\nThe Archdemon looks at the young knight, who doesn’t waver in the slightest under his searing gaze.\n[Doomgore, the Archdemon of murder and destruction.]\n“Aren, son of Antoine the Holy Knight and captain of the Brothers of the Sword.”\nFrom what they heard, he’s not quite at the level of a Holy Knight, but they couldn’t believe he was strong enough to face an Archdemon.\n“…….”\nAren clasped his arm, which was shaking from the collision earlier. Even though he was the one who attacked, just blocking it sent shockwaves through his body.\n‘The Archdemons of destruction are known for their strength…….’\nHe heard that most of the Demons of Slaughter and Destruction have marched to the East, and he wonders if they are still there.\nBut Aren knew there wasn’t just one monster of this magnitude.\nThere were more than two dozen Archdemons to his left and right.\nArchdemons of Destruction, Archdemons of Wisdom, Archdemons of Corruption and Archdemons of Chaos.\n‘With His Majesty and Lord Loxley immobilized, we must do something on our own!’\nAren did not know. No, he couldn’t be bothered to care since this was not the only battlefield.\n* * * *\nWhen Jae-hyuk exited the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods, he found Ha-ri, looking restless and eager to rush to the battlefield.\n“Senior, I’m done, too.”\n“Oh, Jae-hyuk, you’re done too?”\nHa-ri looked at Jae-hyuk’s spear, which flashed with lightning. The treasure left behind by the Holy Knight of Thunder Knight was scattering destructive aura as if it was dissatisfied.\n“I see…you haven’t gotten the recognition you deserve.”\n“You’re the first to point out that it’s not a flicker.”\n“No wonder.”\nHa-ri had seen the strength, will, and conviction of the Holy Knights time and time again. Their indomitable will is not something that can be easily inherited.\nThey would never recognize themselves as anything more than children in the eyes of the holy objects.\n“…….”\nStill, if that power were to be recognized…wouldn’t it help them on the battlefield right now?\n“That’s enough, senior.”\n“Huh?”\n“That’s…not a place we can interfere.”\nJae-hyuk’s gaze looks beyond the city walls.\nMeteors fly, battlefield sparks converge, and the sun shoots out rays.\nThat’s the battle between the Demon Lord and the Grail Guardian.\nHow long can ordinary soldiers and demons survive on a battlefield of such horrific destruction?\nIt was a full-scale doomsday battle that didn’t care about crushing continents and shaking planets.\nThe aftermath alone can wipe out an army of ten thousand units.\n“Of all of us, only the Queen and Lord Yappy will be able to survive there. The last thing we need is to get ourselves killed at this gate, which is nothing more than a recreation of the past.”\n“…….”\n“Well, His Majesty is said to be victorious in this part of history anyway, and he killed three monarchs, right?”\nThat’s right. In the original story, Leon triumphs in the end. He slays every last demon and meets up with Ha-ri and the others who have come to explore the Black Gate.\nLeon is a symbol of victory and the strongest man in the world.\nNaturally, this battle must also be won in the end──\n“Wait.”\n“Senior?”\n“The Last Grail plan…wasn’t it originally abandoned?”\n“…… Wasn’t it?”\nAs they entered the gate and asked Leon for assistance, the forest sages decided to forge the Last Grail.\nIn the aftermath Isabelle, High Priestess of the Moon and Purity, was gravely wounded,\nAntoine, Holy Knight of Iron and Blacksmithing, ascended,\nThe Holy Mother of the Temple of Ten Thousand Shrines and the Sages of the Forest were removed from the battlefield.\n“History…has changed.”\nThe impact of a single Holy Knight on the battlefield is unimaginable but now three people of that lever are missing.\nBeatrice and Yappy were sent to the battlefield, but Yappy armor was dismembered by the Wisdom Lord so he is no match for a Holy Knight.\nA simple comparison of power alone would be missing two Holy Knights, and when you factor in the countless Sages of the Forest, the gap is even greater than it was in the original history.\n“Can they win?”\nThe question was asked, and at that moment, the two of them felt uncomfortable almost simultaneously.\n“Senior, look…….”\n“I saw it.”\nEvacuees rushing toward the Temple, their last refuge and in the midst of it all…….\n“You guys, stop!”\nHa-ri and Jae-hyuk stopped a group of evacuees who were climbing the stairs towards the Temple. They looked puzzled at their sudden restraint, but Ha-ri’s gaze pierced through their center.\n“Whoever’s wearing the robe over there, take it off right now!”\n“…….”\nHa-ri stares, sword drawn, already convinced. The robed man is silent for a moment, then begins to giggle.\n[You have a good sense, don’t you.]\nThe voice seems to echo from the bottom of the abyss, and the moment Ha-ri sees its twisted grin, she instinctively strikes.\nA duality of divine flame and tidal power washes over him. Just as the holy laws, which only sweep through mortal beings, were about to graze the group of refugees, some of them threw up their arms.\n-Kwah!\n“……?!”\nThe waves and flames that had been raining down on them came to nothing. The Holy Law had been lifted by sheer force.\nWas such a thing possible?\n“Damn!”\nAt that moment, the sky rumbled and lightning struck as Jae-hyuk had struck them with the power of Ultima.\n“Wow, this is some serious power! My power and precision have increased significantly!”\nUsing his inherited holy artifact, Jae-hyuk marveled at how much more powerful the lightning was and how precise it was. He hoped that he would be able to mortally wound some, if not all, of them.\n[I wonder if there are two knights of the same rank.]\n[No, one with the power of a holy relic.]\nDespite being struck by lightning, the refugees…or more accurately, those in the guise of refugees, were remarkably unharmed.\nEven a high-level demon would be incapacitated by a direct hit from the Holy Law, but they were unharmed.\nAnd then there were the demons who peeled back the layers of human flesh to reveal their true forms, their sharp features memorable.\n“Demons of pleasure and corruption…!”\nThere were four of them. No, that’s not all.\nOf all the demons with a terrifying presence, there is one that emanates a particularly terrifying energy.\nIt was a well-dressed man in a robe and a sinister mask who gripped his chest with its sharp nails and bowed respectfully.\n[I am the Fallen Archduke Quai, good day, and goodbye.]\nA terrible malice was hidden in the polite voice that was directed at Ha-ri as a sharp ripple reached the nape of her neck in an instant.\n“Huh?”\nThe moment Ha-ri’s voice sounded stupid in front of death. Someone grabbed Ha-ri’s shoulder and pulled her back, swinging a sword.\n-Ka-ang!\n“Hoh?”\nFallen Archduke Quai stared at the knight who blocked his nails, at the end of which was Holy Knight Gillingham of Sky and Thunder.\n“I thought all the available power was at the city walls… I see there are still some left, huh?”\n“Shut up, lowly thing.”\nA blade swung sharply and a flash of light strikes Quay, who leaps backward to avoid it.\n-Thwack!\n“”……!!!””\nThe powerful explosion draws the Archduke attention to the direction the flash came from.\n“I see His Majesty’s preparations were worthwhile.”\nStanding there, with his face covered in bandages, was the High Priestess of Purity, holding a bow.",

      "content": "Chapter 140: The Final Battle (4)\nGillingham, the Holy Knight of Sky and Thunder, thought this was not a good situation.\nThere were four Archdemons, in addition, there were hundreds more demons that had invaded in human skin.\n‘All high-level demons.’\nThey had come here for one reason: to steal or sabotage the essence currently being extracted by the Sages of the Forest.\n“High Priestess Isabelle.”\n“What?”\n“Give up your life.”\n“Fine.”\nLike Gillingham, Isabel was thinking the same thing.\nThey must be stopped here.\n“Lord Gillingham?”\n“Lady Isabel, what the…!”\nPushing the two panicked people aside, the two bet their lives without hesitation.\nAdvent──\nAdvent──\nThunder rumbles in the night sky.\nThe moon’s brilliance shines down on the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods.\nKing of Thunder\nMoon Hunter\nDivinity descends in human form. In front of the brilliance, the Fallen Archduke frowned.\n“Guards, head to the temple.”\n“Archduke?”\nThe demons of Pleasure and Corruption were puzzled by Quai’s words.\n“This is no battlefield for your kind.”\n“I will follow …….”\nHundreds of high-ranking demons, excluding the Archdemons, ran to the Temple as they were and Isabel shouted.\n“Han Soo-ho and Chun So-yeon are there, you guys help them too!”\n“Yes!”\nHa-ri and Jae-hyuk hurriedly chased after the demons.\nAll that was left was the Fallen Archduke and the four Archdemons.\nQuai chuckled.\n“One of you doesn’t seem to be in one piece, do you think you can take on us?”\n“Oh~ I can crush you with one finger, so don’t worry about it.”\n“I see.”\n“Kikikik…You god’s minions are always so full of yourselves, but you will pay for you arrogance.”\nQuai stretched out his arms and in response, the Archdemons charged toward them.\n* * * * *\n“Ugh…!”\nSoo-ho groaned as he blocked the sudden onslaught of demons.\nThe shield he had inherited from Isabelle had skillfully blocked the demons’ ferocious attacks, but his own ability to use it had diminished.\n“So, So-Yeon, what about you?!”\n“Don’t talk to me!”\nTogether with the priests and soldiers residing at the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods, they were able to hold off the demons from all sides, but even Chun So-yeon was overwhelmed by their strength.\nEventually, one of the gates was breached, and the demons rushed through.\n“Wait, wait! Someone stop them!”\nNo way. The breach leads straight to the Sages and the High Priestess, who are refining their essence. We must defend this place at all costs.\n“Chihihihi…! Die, lowly creature!”\nA high ranking demon was about to slash at the gaping guardian with his sharp nails when──\n“Who touched my brother!!!”\nA flame whipped out from nowhere and burned the demon alive.\n“Sister!”\nHa-ri and Jae-hyuk wielded their merciless Holy Laws to annihilate the demons, especially in a small room, where Ha-ri’s Holy Laws boasted absolute firepower.\n“Soo-ho, are you okay?”\n“Ugh… but the demons have turned inward…….”\n“Ugh… Let’s hurry!”\nThe four of them hurriedly headed inward in the direction of the demons, and the moment they arrived, a dazzling light poured out from the Great Hall.\n“Ugh…!”\nA blinding light passed through the Great Hall and reached the sky. It was enough to make everyone turn around and look away.\n“Ugh, what the hell?”\nThe four of them staggered under the influence of the light and barely managed to make their way to the center of it, where the Holy Mother Anak and the Sages would be.\n“This, this?”\nOnce inside, Soo-ho saw the traces of the demons.\nDemons turned to stone, held captive by thousands of roots. Demons impaled on branches stretched out by the sages of the forest.\n-Cut them down!\n-Cut them down!\nThere were sounds of battle from within and by the time the four arrived, the battle between the invading demons and the Sages was in full swing.\n“Lord Gunnar!”\n“Heh…!”\nGunnar’s massive body slammed into the approaching demons. Wielding his enormity with such violence, the Sage of the Forest is more like a rampaging beast than anything else in this place.\n“I’ll join you!”\nThe four join the fray and defend the sages from the demonic onslaught.\nWith most of the sages having their essence inscribed in the Lunar Grail, they are the only ones who can protect them.\nHoly Art <Wave Strike>\nHoly Law <Fire Blessing>\nThe harmony of Ha-ri’s Holy Laws in indoor combat is absolute as the demons burn and drown with no way to escape.\nIt was a combination of holy laws they can’t even think of a way to counter but even then, there are monsters that break through from the front.\n“Cocky.”\n“……?!”\nHa-ri was no match for the iron ball that broke through the waves of fire.\nThe iron ball was veined as if it were alive, but a shield of light saved her.\n-Bam!\nA dizzying impact was felt even beyond the shield and Ha-ri’s lips twitched at the barrier-like shield that didn’t go back in the slightest.\n“The power of the holy object?”\n“Yep. It’s quite powerful…….”\nThe owner of the shield is Soo-ho and the Light Knight’s shield, which he had inherited from Isabelle, had grown to be huge enough to block the corridor, protecting the entire alliance.\n“But…I don’t think I can block it twice…….”\nBeyond the barrier of light, there was an Archdemon who threw an iron ball at them.\nA huge monster that could never be compared to Gunnar and it reminded Ha-ri of Androzin, the Archdemon she saw in another gate.\n“Humans are annoying.”\nThe hulking Archdemon had burns all over his body, thanks to Ha-ri’s holy law.\n“What will destroy you──?!”\nIt was then that a black flash engulfed the Archdemon.\nUnexpectedly, Chun So-yeon swooped down from her hiding place where she had been swept away by the waves.\nShe aimed for the Archdemon throat with her two star iron swords, but failed.\n-Thwack!\nThe arm of the Archdemon that defended his neck from being blown off was severed and Chen So-yeon clicked her tongue, but the surprise didn’t end there.\nThey were in a room where thunder can’t pour down. However, a javelin with a tremendous thunder power of its own was thrown.\nJae-hyuk threw the spear, and it pierced through the Archdemon chest.\n“Aaahhh…! You rat bastards!”\n“Still alive?!”\nThe Archdemon, whose arm was cut off by the Holy Sword and whose chest was pierced by the Holy Spear, was still alive.\nChun So-yeon shouted.\n“What are you doing, why aren’t you killing it?”\n“Uh, uh, uh!”\n“Soo-ho, let’s go!”\nThe two rushed out at Chun So-yeon urging and attacked the Archdemon.\n“Damn it…!”\nThe Archdemon panicked and swung his iron ball with his remaining hand, but he was against four knights at the rank of master and was unable to withstand their combined attack.\n“Hmph…!”\nHa-ri leaped towards the Archdemon that had been crushed by the pincer attack. The fierce, flaming Star Iron Sword immediately struck the Archdemon in the neck.\n-Kaaaah!\n“Big…!”\nHardness like cutting through thick steel is transmitted to the hand holding the hilt but it’s not enough to cut through.\n“Die!”\nHa-ri gritted her teeth and swung with all the strength she could muster. Finally, the fiery sword sliced through the Archdemon throat, and a gush of blood soaked the ceiling.\n“Hmph…!”\n“We got him!”\n“We’ve got the Archdemon!”\nSo-yeon and Jae-hyuk’s exquisite ambush, the guardian shield protecting their allies…and Ha-ri’s absolute offensive power.\nThe four of them managed to deal with an Archdemon, even if it was a Archdemon that was severely injured by a surprise attack it was nothing short of a feat.\nBut…….\n“Huh?”\nAcross the hall the severed neck of an Archdemon gurgled, drawing attention to itself.\nThe shadows of countless demons and two hulks of terrifying presence approached.\n“Archdemon…!”\n“Two of them…….”\nThere were more Archdemons? Just how many Archdemons were there?\nThe four of them stumbled back in horror.\n[Come inside]\nThe familiar voice caused the four to turn inward as if running away.\n“Holy Mother…?!”\nThe voice belonged to the High Priestess Anak who was kneeling in prayer, surrounded by countless forest sages.\n“Come inside…!”\nGunnar, the outermost of the forest sages, led the four into the nest of sages.\nAs if inviting them to enter, the roots parted to form an entrance, but as soon as they were inside, Gunnar closed the entrance and formed a nest of tree men.\n“Damn Treemen!”\nThe Archdemons and demons rushed after the four, hacking at the forest sages with axes and burning them in hellfire.\nHowever, they silently withstood the attack and protected the Last Grail inside.\nInside the nest, which looked like it might shatter at any moment, Ha-ri encountered a brown-haired saint.\n“Great, Great Sister…….”\nThe brunette saint greets them with a compassionate smile. In her hand is a Grail with a faint silver glow.\n“It is ready.”\nThe shards of the moon that Isabel, the High Priestess of the Moon and Purity, had risked her life to separate,\nThe vessel of the Grail, forged by the Holy Knight Antoine.\nThe Grail contains the essence perfected by Mother Anak and the Sages of the Forest.\n“This Grail contains the essence of all the wisdom and knowledge of the forest sages.”\nGasping, Ha-ri marvels at the Moon Grail held by Anak.\nThe power emanating from the Grail was immense and it was instantly recognizable as a holy object of a different class.\n“Holy Mother…….”\n“Now we will combine it with the essence created by the Sages of the Forest, and this will be a holy object that must be called…the Last Grail.”\nAnak did not discuss the power of this holy object, or the mighty vessel needed to handle it, she simply demonstrated it in action.\n“Hurry…up!”\nGunnar’s voice urged and the four suddenly realized that they could sense no source of life from the forest sages.\nTheir leaves, once lush with seemingly infinite vitality, had lost all their color, and their bark, once thick and vibrant, was as dull as a parched old tree.\n“Ah…….”\nThey had been sacrificed to extract the essence that would be inscribed in the Last Grail.\n“Goddess of Light and Justice, your humble servant prays.”\nHolding the Grail containing the sum total of the essence, she began to recite the prayer.\n“Holy Mother?”\nBefore Ha-ri can even finish her question, the brown-haired saint finishes with a smile.\n“Your absolute justice, your light.\nRight here, right now.\nDivine Descent──\nThe next moment, a brilliant light descends upon the Great Hall. The light pierces the ceiling of the Great Hall, and the next moment──\n-Kaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!\nA huge wave of light spread out across the entire city.\nIt was a truly overwhelming light that could turn all the demons in the area into dust.\n“Whoa…….”\nInside the crumbling temple Anak barely broke her stance as the four of them made it safely through the passageway she’d been holding open with her intense light power.\nFalling backward, she was embraced by the cracked roots of Gunnar.\n“Thank you.”\nAnak looked at the parched sages. They had scraped their strength, their holy power, their life force, all into one essence. Now they would never open their eyes.\nWith all their life force drained from them, the sages are no different than dead branches, and so is Gunnar.\nTruly, it was the end of the Tree Men in this world.\n“Why would His Majesty change his mind?”\nOriginally, these powers, these essences, were to be given to the Lionheart King, to focus all their power into the demigod but Leon had changed his plans and Gunnar knew what that meant.\n“Proof that the Lionheart has not given up on the future.”\nThe life force embedded in that essence…that’s what it means. If Leon was going to use the essence as a source of life, not power, it would be for the future.\n“I’m glad His Majesty…didn’t give up.”\n“He never would have given up in the first place, that’s the kind of man he is.”\nHugged by the withering branches, the High Priestess closed her eyes. Surely, she would never open them again.\nBut she left behind hope.\nA seed for the future would be hatched by the Lionheart King.\nThat alone made Anak smile.\nIn the 85th year of King Leon reign Anak Protecia, High Priestess of Light and Justice, Gunnar the Tree Giant and the Sages of the Forest ascended.",

      "content": "Chapter 141: For the Lionheart\nThe battle is headed for a climax.\nThe Lord of Wisdom and the Guardian of the Grail have reached a lull in the battle of infinite power.\nThe demonic army pushes forward inexorably, finally overrunning the city walls.\n“Hold your ground! Hold until the citizens retreat!”\nThe War Knights rallied their knights and soldiers to the defense, but it was only a matter of time.\nThe demons that had infiltrated the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods were annihilated by a wave of light, but the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods crumbled with it.\nThere was no contact with the Holy Lady and the Holy Knight, and the outer walls were crumbling, with millions of demons rushing in.\n“Retreat! Retreat to the inner city!”\nIn the end, the only option left was the inner city, between the outer walls and the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.\n“Aaah…….”\n“Aaahhhh…!”\nChildren crying from the heat of the demons that have reached their noses, and mothers embracing them.\nThe men, whose will to fight is still intact, are now woefully outnumbered.\n“…….”\nWalter, the leader of the Imperial Gifted, watched the scene and knew it. The end is near.\nMost of the knights were already dead. None of the soldiers were strong, and the elite had long since been exhausted.\n“Whoa…….”\n“Your Majesty…!”\nEven King Lionheart, the absolute protector of the kingdom, had used all his strength to intercept meteors for over three days.\nNow it was coming to an end.\nWalter began to feel terrified at the impending doom.\n“Can’t we… evacuate?”\n“Sir Walter!”\nAren said in a panic, but the head of the Imperial Gifted spoke with difficulty.\n“If we break for the exits now and wait until later, we will not be able to…….”\nLeon replied calmly to Walter’s words.\n“Where do you mean, out of this place?”\n“You’ve got to live, you’ve got to survive, and you’re not going to die if you stay here?”\nWalter’s voice was close to venomous. It was a meaningless gurgle of hope.\n“…….”\n“Your Majesty, please, please give us a way to live!”\nSeeing him still clinging to hope for life, Leon knew all too well that it was futile.\nThis is how this world ends.\nIt’s a predetermined future, and this fight is a past that only reenacts it.\nDoesn’t it matter what happens now?\nFight or flee. In the end, the future won’t change.\n“No.”\nIt doesn’t. Leon’s gaze flicked to the silver-haired woman in the corner, gasping for air from exhaustion.\nNext to her, he saw the mechanical spider servicing itself, checking its armor.\nAnd…a wave of light from the rear.\nThe voice of the goddess who had confirmed the deaths of High Priestess Anak and his old friend.\nIsabel, High Priestess of the Moon and Purity, and Gillingham, Holy Knight of the Sky and Thunder, stopped dead in their tracks after slaying the Demon Archduke and the Archdemons.\nWar Knight Gildus and his son Galleon, rallying the knights at the front, were unable to keep up with the retreating forces.\nAll of this is not a mere repetition of history.\nThe strangers from Earth changed history for them, for their future selves.\nAlthough the outcome may not be the same, this history is vastly different from the past.\nThat’s why it’s not meaningless.\nThat’s why it’s still worth fighting for.\n“It’s all over now…….”\n“No, it’s not over. There are still those who are fighting.”\nIn the past, in the present, and in the future.\nHe himself was fighting, and generations after generations of knights were with him.\n“There will be no retreat. There will be no evacuation.”\nThe choice ignited his will to fight, and it made him grim.\n“We’ve come this far…what can we do?” he said.\nThe army was less than ten thousand strong, and the enemy still outnumbered them by hundreds, if not thousands of times.\nWhat can we do with our feeble human strength against that endless army?\n“Mount your horses.”\n“Your Majesty…?”\n“Mount your horse, grab your spear, and let’s go fight.”\nThe final charge. After a seemingly pointless, almost futile, and indeed futile maneuver, the Lionheart King spoke.\n“You still talk about fighting for honor and glory, it’s a lost cause!”\nDespite the insolence of the remark, none of the surrounding knights had the presence of mind to point it out. Their exhausted bodies were too tired to even raise their voices.\nBut Leon, in a voice that encompassed them all, spoke with determination.\n“For our pride.”\nFor that which is immortal, unyielding in the face of death.\nLeon grabs both of Walter’s shoulders. It wasn’t a forceful grip, but one of encouragement and wanting to be there.\n“Fight with this king on horseback to the end.”\n“Your Majesty…….”\n“For the Empire. For the good citizens you were supposed to protect.”\nLeon’s gaze traveled to all who looked at him.\nThe surviving dwarves, elves… and knights. And citizens. And again──those from the future.\n“Until the last spark of honor on this land is extinguished.”\nA charge.\nCharge once more.\nTogether.\nIt was a request, not an order, from Leon.\nThe first to respond was a pure white horse that approached with a steady clatter of hooves.\n“Thank you, my old ally.”\nStroking her mane, Leon climbed aboard. In response, the knights each mounted their own steeds, and the horseless stood up on sturdy legs.\n“Your Majesty…….”\nThe redheaded girl and her companions, who had come to join Beatrice, approached. Leon spoke to them from his horse.\n“Watch, and remember. This is the last gallop of our time.”\nLeon leads the way, determined, followed by the knights and soldiers.\n“Let’s go, Stallion!”\nThe Lionheart King kicked Stallion’s side and let out a sharp, rumbling roar.\nIt was a last ditch effort, but it was not one of resignation or abandonment. It made way for the future he would leave behind.\nKnowing certain defeat, the light races against the endless darkness.\n“For honor.”\n“”To glory…!!!””\n“””For the Lionheart──!!””””\nThe trumpets blare as the knights gallop through the streets of the Inner City.\n“……!?”\nThe demons panic in the face of the charging knights. The sight of cornered rats scurrying in unison is almost comical at first glance.\n“Keeeeeeeeeeee!\nBut with a blinding light, the charging knights blinded the demons and caught them off guard.\nAt the moment of impact, the flesh of the demons burst open, sending black specks flying.\nThey are trampled under the hooves of the light horses and erased from this world.\n“Waaaahhhhhhhhhh…!”\nThe knights roared, slashing at the demons in front of them as they broke through. The soldiers behind them crossed their spears and pierced the demons’ hearts.\nHigh demons and Archdemons were no match for the shining charge. Small and large were irrelevant.\nNo one could stop it. The wedge formed by the Last Ten Thousand pierced through all the demons in the city, through the shattered gates, through the endless waves.\nThere has been light, waves have swept, thunderbolts have fallen and flames have burned.\nAll miracles were with them, all divinity was with the Grail Guardian.\nThey charge again and again like a mighty boulder rolling down the ridge of a crumbling mountain. Nothing seemed to be able to stop them.\nAnd yet.\nTen million is a number that makes the impossible possible.\nThe seemingly unstoppable forces of light are engulfed by infinite darkness. Caracael, Lord of Wisdom, knew they had reached their limit.\n[It’s almost over. I’ll finish them off]\nThe Lord’s finger points at the forces of light and in the next moment, a beam of doom, a thick darkness and terrible curse cuts through the Light Army, killing knights, halting their gallop.\nWhen darkness finally overtook the light, Caracael smiled in triumph.\n[This long struggle with divinity is over; it is now the age of evil]\nDrunk on that triumphant miasma.\n─────────────!!!!!!!\nA blaring horn echoes across the battlefield. The eardrum-bashing blast draws the attention of Caracael and the demons alike to the western ridge, where a group of horses slowly emerges.\nA knight on a black steed is at the forefront, staring down the evil army.\n“The Lionheart King hasn’t given up yet.”\n“He is the father of the Grand Duke.”\nThe Grand Duke of Dragonia, Karina, smirks at her lieutenant’s words.\n“But who persuaded Your Excellency to change your mind?”\n“A wench who left me some change from the God of Vengeance.”\n“I’m going to regret this. I know it.”\nAs if seeing from the future, the avenger himself spoke.\n“Gaspar, break through the center of the enemy! Delvoske, take the right wing and stab the flanks of the troops surrounding King Lionheart!”\nThe Archduke of Dragonia mounted her horse and urged her men on. The northerners, the agents of her will, cried out in a booming voice.\n“Do not fear their pale darkness! For ours is the deepest darkness of this world!”\nThese avengers have made a pact with Ventasis, the God of Darkness and Vengeance. They have risked their souls for vengeance, and have been given the power to carry it out.\nLed by the Grand Duke, who wields a magic sword forged with the power of vengeance, they charge into the dark hordes.\n“For vengeance! For justice!”\n“”For the Lionheart!!!””\nAs the dark army raced across the land, the Demons of Wisdom responded with a barrage of magic against the 30,000 Northerners.\nBut no amount of infernal fire raining down on their midst, no amount of poisonous fog blocking their path, could diminish their momentum.\nThe avengers, led by Grand Duke Karina, are not stopped by such deterrents.\nTheir fiery will to revenge, aided and abetted by the God of Vengeance, slowly closes the distance between them and the demons.\nSpears are crossed as large demons stand in their way, and yet──\nIn the moment of conflict, all is swept away.\n[Human bastards…….]\nThey are relentless.\nThere are only 30,000 of them. A handful of men charging in front of an army of this magnitude. What does that mean?\nFor honor? For pride?\nThe wisest man in the world cannot comprehend why these ignorant mortals, a mere speck in the universe, would cling to such fleeting values.\n[You are powerless to resist this wave. What is the point of a moment’s resistance?]\n‘But it’s annoying. I can’t stand it.’\nCaracael’s twelve fingers pointed at the Northern army.\n‘I’ll have to deal with the Grand Duke first, who has the presence of Lionheart.’\nHoly Descent────\n[????!!]\nJust as he was organizing his tactics to snipe at a more threatening enemy force.\n“I caught you off guard.”\nThe golden knight leapt in.\nRisking everything, pushing through all the recklessness-──\n[You…?!]\n──And finally, against all odds.\n[The others…?!]\nCaracael quickly realized the cause.\nThe gods of this world had descended behind the Lionheart King’s brilliant polarizing light.\nArianna of Light and Justice.\nPetos of War and Flame.\nDemera of Life and Fertility.\nUltima of the Sky and Thunder.\nTatar of the Sun and Judgment.\nPoma of the Sea and Waves.\nDinah of the Moon and Purity.\nFle of Dreams and Death.\nHeto of Iron and Blacksmiths.\nAll at once, these myriad deities, who had to be strengthened at the Holy Knight’s expense, manifested themselves.\nTheir destructive power tore through the Archdemons, toppled waves of demons, and led the Lionheart King here.\n[Impossible…!]\nHow can so many gods descend into the body of a man, with the power of a single entity?\n[How…!!!]\nThe twelve great spells that had been directed at the Northern Army suddenly turned toward the Lionheart King but Leon’s holy sword shines against each and every one of them.\nThis sword shows that Leon Dragonia Lionheart was at his most powerful–indestructible, unbreakable, and──\nFiery, never extinguished───\nExtreme light, infinite light that cuts through darkness.\nIt is the symbol of indomitable, indestructible, and undefeatable.\nThis glorious sword is a symbol of divinity, the pinnacle of the Holy Knights, agents of the divine.\n“Death to evil, only death!”\nLight erupted.\nAccelerated by the power of the living demigod, the extreme light consumed evil with the heat of battle.\nEven the Demon Lord Caracael, who had studied countless magics and gained wisdom, could not resist the polarizing light of all divine light.\nIt would not allow the vile malignancy even a moment to scream.\nThe light was there, and for a moment…the evil of the world was gone.",

      "content": "Chapter 142: The Lionheart Kingdom. Aftermath\n“Uh-oh…!”\n“Jump in…!”\nThe gate opened, and in unison they threw themselves toward the entrance.\nThere was light, there was darkness, and finally the world came into view.\n“I’m out?!”\n“Ha, Ha-ri!”\n“Jae-hyuk!”\nThey emerged from the gate and were greeted by the other knights and soldiers of the TTG Guild.\n“Ha-ri, are you okay?”\nChief Kim Jin-soo, who had been standing by with Oh Kang-hyuk, the Association’s chairman, in case of an emergency, rushed over, and Koo Dae-sung supported them with the other knights.\nThe six of them sank to the ground, breathing heavily. Even Beatrice couldn’t care less about dignity right now.\n“…….”\nLeon stood before them, his face so welcoming, so grave…and yet so sad.\n“What did you see?”\n“……Your Majesty.”\nHa-ri took a holy object from her bosom. It was the Final Grail.\nThe Grail that so many had sacrificed to protect, forged by the Holy Knight Antoine, infused with the essence of the sages of the forest, and perfected by the Holy Mother.\nUpon seeing it, Leon immediately realized what had happened inside the gate.\n“Two hundred years ago, this king rejected Gunnar’s offer to complete the Final Grail.”\n“Because it would require the sacrifice of the High Priestess of Chastity, the Sages of the Forest, and the Holy Mother.\nAbove all, he knew that if he tried to make it, the evil ones would not stand idly by.\n“There must have been many sacrifices, many deaths. So, what was it like for the others there?”\n“Wonderful…yes.”\nHa-ri sobbed, remembering the sacrifices of Isabel and Anak.\n“They were the coolest people in the world!”\nJae-hyuk remembered Gunkar, dying but looking forward to the future──\n“They protected us, all of them.”\nHe thought of Gillingham, who had stood up to the Fallen Archduke──\n-Soot.\nAntoine and the knights, who collected the shards of the moon while burning their last flame──\n“Your Majesty fought to the last, for the future.”\nKing Lionheart, who finally cut down the Lord of Wisdom and paved the way for the future──\n“Grand Duke Karina returned for you.”\nChun So-yeon, who had begged Isabelle for change, remembered Grand Duke Karina and the Northern Army appearing with the sound of horns.\nWhat they saw was a tale of heroes racing to the end of time.\nThe end of a dazzling journey of knights who followed the divine, upheld honor, and sought glory.\nStories of men who nevertheless left something for the future.\nAnd then.\n“So be it.”\nThe Lionheart King stood before them.\nA king of knights who will unfold the future from the past.\n* * * *\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart, the honorable Lionheart, leader of the Holy Knights, believed in the purity of humanity.\nHe rejected the peace of bondage and subjugation and believed in the honor of dying a free man even if it meant extermination.\n“Great…….”\nThe hand gripping the sword trembles. His mind is foggy from the loss of so much blood, and his legs are wobbly. Finally, as his body threatens to collapse, he is supported by an arm across his back.\n“You are not…meant to fall like this.”\n“Lord Loxley…….”\nLoxley, Holy Knight of the Sun and Judgment, supports Leon with his one remaining arm.\nThe once glorious Holy Knight was already dying because of his wounds. His arm was torn off, his holy sword broken, and his armor crumpled with his flesh.\nHow thick were the limbs he had to break through to cause such damage to his immortal sword and armor? Surely not less than his own.\n“It is an honor to die by your side, my king.”\nTo this honorable knight, loyal to the end, Leon has only one thing to say.\n“It was an honor to fight alongside you.”\nThe knight needs no further words. With that one word, Loxley closed his eyes in contentment. All power drained from his body, and Leon, taking over what remained, rose to his feet.\n‘Karina…….’\nThe Northern army that had been stabbing at the flanks of the battlefield was nowhere to be seen. He hadn’t gotten a final hug from his daughter, but he wasn’t sorry for that.\nKarina, the light of his wife’s gift, had come to him in the end.\n‘What a long life,’ he thought.\nHe died of overwork at a young age and was reincarnated in this world.\nAs the heir of the Grand Duke of Dragonia, he was relieved to see his beautiful mother, assured of no future love affairs, and looked forward to fantasizing about the otherworldly scenery outside his window.\nAt eight years old he was thrilled with his first sword.\n“This, too, must be the guidance of the Goddess, and it will be worth teaching.”\nUnder the tutelage of Sir Gordon the Holy Knight, he realized that the world was not easy.\nHe even complained that his training was not the otherworldly fantasy he thought it would be.\nWhat was it like to set out on your journey to become a Holy Knight?\nDidn’t he wander the world as an adolescent, laughing at the ridiculousness of the quest?\n“Gildus! Thanks for the help!”\n“Hahahaha! The young fellow is quite skilled!”\n“Treeman Gunnar. May I join you on your journey?”\nHe met friends for life.\n“Leon Dragonia, son of Grand Duke Wolfric Dragonia, I grant you a quest to prove your honor and faithfulness.”\nHe met the Goddess.\nBecame a War Knight, then a Holy Knight.\nHe waged war against the orcs, defeated the Archdemon, and was chosen to succeed the fallen Lionheart King.\nOn that honorable journey,\n“I am a priest, sworn to chastity. Your Majesty should not incur the wrath of the Goddess for something as insignificant as me.”\nThey made love.\n“Castile, this child shall be named Karina, and she shall succeed me as Grand Duchess of Dragonia!”\nThe child was born and the journey continued.\n“Your Majesty, I will escort the holy relics from that savage land.”\nThe venerated old Holy Knight set out, never to return.\n“Your Majesty, the Empire… the Empire has fallen.”\nThe Lord of Chaos destroyed the Empire.\n“Gates are opening all over the world! Their numbers are beyond counting!”\nAs the Great War continues.\n“Your Majesty, the enemy legions are on the move!”\n“They’re in the Grand Duchy of Dragonia…….”\nHe lost his wife.\n“I am Vulcanus!”\nHis trusted knight disappeared along with the enemy Glacial Archduke.\nAfter that, Leon’s history was one of endless war, too much for him to bear but just as he was ready to face the end, they came.\n‘It was a girl named Han Ha-ri, and she had a lot of power. I wonder where she came from…….’\nThe name of my hometown sounded familiar. I poked at it, and it was.\n“Seo, Seoul! Seoul, South Korea!”\nTheir story was astonishing.\nHe couldn’t believe that the knights he had sent from the future were here but then he collapsed.\nIn the end, our destiny was destruction.\nAfter all, our fate was destruction.\nI was the only one who survived, and I was able to return to Earth after finally taking revenge on all the demons.\nIsabel, his wife’s sister, his old friends Gildus, Antoine, Gunnar, Gillingham Loxley, his loyal companions and Karina, his most precious treasure along with the countless soldiers and citizens who, until the very end, gave him hope.\nThey are all dead, and he is the only one left.\nWhat does that mean?\n“There is hope.”\nArianna whispered to Leon.\n“Do you not remember, Leon, and are you not the proof of it, that the collective will of all those who fell in glory and honor remains with you?”\nThough doomed to perish, he kept the pantheon in his heart, a paradise where all ends.\nThere are those who carry on the will to the end.\nI am Leon Dragonia Lionheart, the 15th Lionheart King.\nMy role in this recreated world is.\n“to assist the burden of the future.”\nAnd\nThe demons approached the Lionheart King, who had risen from the ashes of all his predestined deaths.\n[Foolish, Lionheart]\nMagnificent walls crumbled, knights fell, and soldiers were consumed by flames.\nDemons without honor strode contentedly over the deaths of the honorable.\nEven after the death of the Demon Lord Caracael and countless other Archdemons, they were still many, and their enemies now included only the Last Knight.\n[Is this thy grave, to be buried amidst the carcasses of thy deeds?]\n[Hast thou struggled enough, weak wench’s servant? Didst thou think the waves would recede when thou stabbedst the sea with thy toothpicks?]\n[I will build a temple of ruin upon your blood-soaked ashes, and your paltry honor will be chewed with the meat of your people]\nLeon could only listen to the words and the demons thought he had broken down with grief and helplessness.\n…….\nThat is an arrogant illusion as the knight merely held his breath and waited for the demons to approach.\nIn his shallow sense of victory, the Archdemon was about to bend Leon’s knee when-!\n-Snap!\n“……?!”\nThe light of the holy sword penetrated the Archdemon knee shin. The last thing the Archdemon, whose knees disappeared under the blow, saw was the figure of the knight who leapt at him.\n-Degurrrrr.\nThe demons cowered as the Archdemon neck fell from the two blows.

      "content": "Chapter 143: The Last Holy Grail\nLeon looked at the Moon Grail, forged by Isabel, smelted by Antoch, and perfected by Gunnar, the Sages of the Forest, and the High Priestess Anak.\n“Quite a thing, isn’t it?”\nBeatrice smiled and looked at the Moon Grail in Leon’s hand.\n“I was just about to ask Gunnar how to grow a seedling when I realized how big this was going to get.”\nHe had opened the gate and attempted to enter, hoping to find out from Gunnar or one of the other forest sages how to raise the seedling for Gunnar.\nLittle did he know it would lead to the Last Holy Grail plan.\n“It’s been an unexpected harvest, even if it has grown out of my original goal.”\n“I see.”\nHe had no idea it would lead to the finalization of the Last Holy Grail plan.\n“It was conceived long ago by Gunnar and the other Sages of the Forest.”\nThe Last Holy Grail Plan was basically the same as the plan to implant the Holy Grail into the Lionheart.\n“The Lionheart Plan?”\n“A sort of ark plan, staking the future of the world on the being ‘most likely to survive’.”\nIf the world were to be irreparably damaged and destroyed, it would be prioritized for preservation.\nFirst, of course, is the temple of the gods.\nTheir residence is more than just a matter of faith; it is tied to the very existence of the world.\nIf it were destroyed, the power of the gods to maintain paradise would be lost, which would mean the end of Leon’s world.\n“Therefore, the gods decided to take refuge in this king’s Lionheart. There, they could generate their own power and survive.”\nIt was a gamble that would come to naught if Leon died.\n“And the gamble paid off.”\n“Yes. And the Last Holy Grail plan was…….”\nLeon recalled a memory from a very long time ago. For Beatrice, it was recent, but for him, it was over two hundred years ago.\n“During the final battle, we were at the end of our rope. We couldn’t afford to sacrifice someone to forge an artifact.”\n“Surely…….”\nIn order to forge the Moon Grail, all the Sages of the Forest, High Priestess Anak, and High Priestess Isabel of Purity had to be sacrificed.\nEven Sir Gilliam, a Holy Knight, guarded it.\nLionheart could not have afforded to miss that kind of manpower.\n“The Last Grail will be bestowed upon the Father of the Realm, and it has the power of the sun and the strength of thunder. And it was Arianna who brought them all together.”\nLeon took out the Holy Grail, a treasure descended from the first Lionheart.\nAs Leon imbued it with his holy power, a brilliant light began to emanate from it, creating a veil of light so brilliant that it illuminated the dawn of the night as brightly as day.\nBeatrice understood the power of the Holy Grail.\n“It produces holy water that can instantly heal any wound, performing all sorts of miracles. It’s a holy relic that’s required to be sworn as a Holy Knight.”\n“I see. It is because of this that the Holy Grail has come to symbolize the founding of the kingdom. And the holy water of the Grail is indispensable for the swearing-in of a Holy Knight.”\nLeon placed the Holy Grail and the Moon Grail in the same spot. To his surprise, the two grails attracted each other like a magnet, and the Moon Grail began to melt into the Holy Grail.\n“Your Majesty, what is this?”\n“The Moon Grail is a holy object that fills in the gaps of the Holy Grail… an improvement, so to speak. It is a material for forging the ‘Last Grail’ according to the needs of the times.”\nNow fully assembled, the Holy Grail didn’t look much different than before.\nIt was a gleaming golden grail, with the additional sigil of the Moon Grail.\n“So the power of the Moon Grail is…….”\nBeatrice recalled the miracle of the grail when it was completed.\n“An object more akin to destruction than restoration of life, so it’s meant to improve upon the existing Holy Grail.”\n“Exactly.”\nAccording to Ha-ri’s testimony, even an Archdemon had been annihilated by a direct hit from the Moon Grail wave of light.\nIt’s a range-type demonic annihilation weapon and upon contact, a lesser demon is sure to be destroyed.\n“That’s certainly a hard counter to demons, I’ll just go around the city with this grail and blast out a wave, and any lurking demons will die.”\nWhat makes demons so troublesome is their numbers and their ability to blend into human society before their immortality.\nThey can make contracts with humans to spread evil, or they can go undercover in human skin.\nIn Beatrice’s case, the demons of pleasure and decadence have infested the city, forcing her to implement extreme measures like the Inquisition.\nAnd such extreme groups are bound to backlash against the citizenry and claim innocent victims.\nThe power of the reformed Grail was bound to streamline that dramatically.\n“Wait…Your Majesty, you said this was part of the Ark plan?”\nBeatrice remembered how all the Sages of the Forest had to give their lives to complete the Moon Grail.\n“The accumulation of ‘species’ and ‘knowledge’.”\n“……!”\n──────\nLeon, in turn, explained the power behind the Moon Grail, and it was…….\n“The power to rebuild a new kingdom.”\n“That would only be possible when the seedling of Gunnar grew. You have not forgotten your original purpose, because of the unexpected harvest that brought you the Last Grail and other holy objects, have you?”\nAt that, Beatrice smiled brightly.\n“Of course, Mr. Gunnar gave me clear advice.”\nLeon had taken Gunnar’s seedlings from the World of the Dead.\nTherefore, Gunnar’s seedlings can only grow in paradise.\nBeatrice tells Leon how to grow the seedling as she learned from Gunnar and it’s not easy, but with Leon and Beatrice, it’s definitely possible.\nSo, the idea of Gunnar’s seedling is off the table.\nIt would take some pretty tricky conditions to grow it, but for now, it was something that could be solved with the Moon Grail.\n“With all due respect, I have another favor to ask of you.”\n“As you wish, Your Majesty is in a position to command me to do anything.”\nHaving saved the souls of the knights who served her until the very end, Beatrice owed Leon an unpayable debt.\nAfter all, it was he who had saved her from transforming into the demons she hated.\nShe felt so indebted to him that she considered herself his vassal before being a queen.\n“Kings do not command kings and if you have a burden, don’t make me one I don’t have.”\n“Your Majesty’s high-mindedness is not something I can approve of.”\nEven he recognized this but Leon doesn’t see high-mindedness as a negative.\nPrinciples, unwavering standards and the steadfastness with which they are enforced, however frustrating they may seem at times, is what makes a king objective.\n“Continue your research on the gate. I’ll assist you with anything you need. I have two people I need to find.”\n“I think I know one.”\nBeatrice remembered the man Leon had mentioned once before, and whom she had also encountered. And she had heard of him at this gate as well.\n“The Holy Knight missing in the plains of Randolce.”\nAn absolute powerhouse, said to be the strongest Holy Knight in Lionheart.\nVulcanus, Holy Knight of War and Flame.\n“This king is certain he is alive. If the previous king had ascended earlier, the next Lionheart King would surely have been him.”\nThe Lionheart King was not chosen by mere strength alone.\nThey had to be approved by all the gods and prove their virtue and faith.\nOf course, it was a time of war, so it’s understandable if force was prioritized.\nVulcanus’ strength had surprised even Beatrice, who had only watched from the sidelines.\n“If he’s alive, he’s somewhere in a Gate, and there’s an object that could be the coordinates to find him.”\nThe ritual dagger Leon obtained from the Vulcanus he encountered while clearing the Jerea Relic Convoy gate was good enough as coordinates to find him.\nOr, more accurately, it should have been enough.\n“Your Majesty, we have already failed to locate Lord Vulcanus with that dagger.”\n“I see. Either the coordinates lacked specificity, or we simply ran out of magic stones.”\nOpening the gate requires a great deal of magic stones.\nWhether it’s Holy Knight Jerea’s Relic Convoy gate, the gate to Slaughter Archduke Akasha’s estate, or the colorless gate that is the setting for the final battle of Lionheart, the enormous amounts of magic stones consumed were not easily replenished, even by the TTG Guild, which cleared the gates around them as they came.\n“I have a theory about that. I’ll have to research it a bit more.”\nAnd then there was the one remaining.\nThis was something Leon had checked with the spirits that had ‘entered Paradise’ in the last war.\nBesides Georgic and Vulcanus there was another child who had not entered Paradise.\n“Karina Dragonia, this king’s daughter was also not found in the Paradise of the Gods.”\nHe wanted to find my daughter. He didn’t want to give up if there was hope. Leon’s desire was very natural.\n“I’ll see what I can do. I know it’s hard, but please be patient.”\n“Indeed. I wonder where this would be without you and Sir Spinner.”\n“We are all in your service.”\n“It is kind of you to say so.”\nLeon kissed the back of Beatrice’s hand in gratitude and she did not refuse the highest courtesies a knight paid to a lady.\n“I will grant you anything you wish. Do not refuse this king’s gratitude.”\n“Only if you say so…….”\nBeatrice pressed a white finger to her lips. She thought long and hard for a moment, then smiled brightly.\n“I’ll tell you later.”\nIt was a blank check of sorts, but Beatrice chose to look away.\n* * * * *\nSouth Korea President Ahn Dong-gil is a moderately corrupt and moderately just politician.\nHis grandfather was an independence fighter and his father was a democracy fighter, and the destruction of democracy that has recently invaded this planet has cost him dearly, but he’s basically walked a fine line.\nIn that sense, the recent dramatic shift in the domestic balance of power is a conundrum for the president.\n“No, these guys are crazy.”\nThe first group he disparages as privateers are the hunter guilds, a group of superhumans with powers beyond any military.\nOf course, the national army is no match for a small group of superhumans, but the problem is the gate security crisis caused by their absence.\nWhy did Japan, until recently, privatize the Hunter Association and allow S-class hunters with unlimited power to go on the rampage?\nIt’s because they have no alternative when it comes to attacking gates.\nThe number of S-class hunters ensured the security and safety of the country, which was linked to stock prices and real estate.\nJust look at how the glorious cities of London and Shanghai became barren because they couldn’t block a single gate.\nEven if you’re an S-ranked Hunter, it’s hard to touch a large guild with S-ranked Hunters when all the great powers are willing to spend money to get them.\nThe same is true for the top 10 guilds in Korea, so they’ve been trying to manipulate the government by playing the defection card.\n‘Oh Kang-hyuk’s choice was not wrong, really not wrong…….’\nIn such a situation, Leon appeared, and Ten Thousand Gods Guild was established.\nOh Kang-hyuk fully supported the Ten Thousand Gods Guild, hoping to use it as a stronghold against the Ten Guilds.\nHe was not wrong. Unlike the Ten Guilds, who control the government with their wealth and power, TTG Guild is a group driven by one man’s principles.\nAs long as they kept their leader, Leon, happy, they could keep the Ten Guilds in line and protect national security.\nHis religion is so popular that the blessed crops alone are now filial piety goods that the entire world demands Korea export.\nIn many ways, TTG Guild is the goose that lays the golden eggs that bring the country enormous profits. The problem is…….\n“A guild that was founded less than half a year ago has already grown to this level.\nIt’s already at the level of a top 10 guild.\nMoreover, the recent addition of Hanbit Palace under its own umbrella has actually unbalanced the 10 guilds.\nIs this the end? The newly established Japan Hunters Association, which was formed after the Japan All Japan Association was completely destroyed by public opinion, is composed mostly of loyalists of the TTG Guild.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that Japan Hunter’s Association has become subservient to the Ten Thousand Gods Temple.\nAs a hunter’s guild, it is powerless, but its public support is frighteningly high.\n-I was cured of cancer after believing in the Ten Thousand Gods.\n-Honestly, if you follow the doctrine of the Ten Thousand Gods Temple, you’ll go to heaven, right?\n-Have you seen the Code of Light and Justice? We should make all domestic politicians and government officials believe in this. Those who violate it will be punished and destroyed.\n-The Goddess of Life and Abundance is honey lol. Ever since my grandfather became a priest of Demera, the whole family ate blessed crops at every meal.\n-Is it true that all diseases are cured?\n-Hair loss is cured.\n-From this day forward, the National Baldness Association pledges allegiance to the TTG Temple. Hail Lionheart!\nThe TTG Temple is growing too fast for its own good and the side effects are showing up all over the country.\nJust in today’s briefing alone──\n-Your Excellency, there is a public opinion that you should become a devotee of Arianna, the Goddess of Light and Justice, as a state official, what do you think?\n‘No, I think they’re ridiculous. They obviously know I go to church!’\nHe deflected, saying that as a public official, he could not be biased toward a particular religion, but the public’s reaction was not favorable.\n-Why doesn’t Dong-gil believe in Arianna?\n-Because he has a bad back. What happened to the Colonel Group scandal?\n-How can you believe in the Goddess of Justice when you’re stealing billions?\n‘You sons of bitches…!”\nOf course, there’s some backstabbing going on but is there any place in politics where you can just be clean?\nA little shit, a little flexibility, a little handing over, that’s how the country lives, that’s how the economy lives!\n“Mr. President…!”\n“What!”\nThe chief of staff, who may or may not have been aware of the cranky president’s state of mind because he was reminded of the regular briefing, approached and reported.\n“It’s just that… the United Nations has contacted me urgently.”\n“The United Nations? What the hell?”\n“Something about contributing to the refugee relief fund as a developed country.\nWithout China and Russia as permanent members, the United Nations has become a social club for European snobs.\nStill, they claim to be the world’s government, so we should give in to their demands.\nThat’s what President Ahn Dong-gil had thought until half a second ago, but he couldn’t hide his dismay when he saw the UN notification.\n“……Fuck.”\nHe was supposed to be preserving his dignity as a president…but he couldn’t help but swear.\nThe notification began with the following title\n“Inspection Team to Investigate Alleged Human Rights Abuses at TTG Temple.”\nIt left him f*cking speechless.",

      "content": "Chapter 144: Building an Accident-Free Factory\nVeraher, a former peasant, has been subjected to harsh labor since he was reduced to serfdom.\nHe’s lucky he wasn’t part of the murderous suicide squad of the Serf Challenge, but that doesn’t mean life isn’t hard for the rest of the serfs.\nThe Lionheart King is determined to kill his serfs through overwork, and he refuses to allow them to have a normal day, even at mealtime.\nVeraher froze for a moment at the sight of the tray in front of him.\n“What, what is this?”\n-Meal.\nThe tray was filled with an opaque, whitish liquid. Was it some kind of oatmeal?\n“Necessary nutrients. Properly mixed with salt and sugar.”\n“…….”\nSugar-salt water.\nThe infamous Yakt Spinner of the Ten Thousand Gods Guild was even harsher on the serfs.\n“Damn, damn, damn!”\nVeraher longed for the past, for the glory days.\nAfter sacrificing tender young human flesh to the demons, he could still eat old, tough meat without resentment but now he has two meals a day and fills his stomach with sugar and salt, then picks up his pickaxe.\n“Pfft…!”\nAt the site of the former Hanbit Palace, there’s a huge piece of star iron that Leon dropped.\n-Dig it up. 20 kg per person.\nUnder the command of the cruel killing machine, the serfs began pounding the iron with pickaxes.\n-Clang, clang, clang!\nThe sound of pickaxes rings out but the teeth of the pickaxe were no match for the terrifyingly hard meteorite.\n-Bang!\n“Clunk!”\nThe moment the pickaxe collided, a numbing shock traveled through the pickaxe and into his palm.\n“Ew…!”\nHe hadn’t struck the soft part of the meteorite, but the hard stardust. Veraher lost his grip on the pickaxe, and the supervisor approached.\n“Why did you stop working?” the supervisor demanded with his whip in hand.\nHe could even recognize the tone of their gibberish, and usually within three seconds, the whip would be flying.\n“All right, I’ll do it again!”\nVeraher immediately raised his pickaxe and tapped on the iron.\n-Giggle!\n“Do the job right!” yelled the supervisor.\nAlthough the words were directed at Veraher, the hundreds of serfs around him picked up the pace.\n-Chaaaah!\nIt was then that the pickaxe struck the meteorite, cracking it open and spilling out the top chunk of stardust.\n“Uh-uh-uh-uh!”\n“Falling!!!”\nVeraher scrambled out of the way of the falling mass, but there were serfs who couldn’t dodge the falling chunks.\n“Ugh!”\n………\n……\n…\nTTG Star Iron Mining Team.\nToday is the 15th day without an accident.\nBeware of falling rocks..\n* * * *\nAfter finishing the morning’s mining, the afternoon is spent sorting it.\nIt is to remove impurities from the mined nuggets, find pure nuggets, and sort them into grades.\nYou’d think that sorting nuggets would be easier, since no one would die because of falling rocks or tear their palms off with pickaxes but the serfs described the sorting as a hellish time.\n“Ew, ew, ew…!”\nVeraher moved a lump of pure stardust to the tongs but his hands were smoldering, as if they were burning.\n“Ugh, ugh!”\nVeraher drops a chunk of stardust into the sorting bin and falls backwards. His hands and feet are scorching hot, and the skin on his face is burning.\nAs followers of the demons, the serfs are an evil species condemned to a life of fire, and for them, star iron imbued with the power of the gods is a poison in itself.\n-Faster!\nIt was then that a voice called out to Veraher, who was in the midst of heavy labor.\n“Oh, I get it, I get it, I get it, please stop being such a twit!”\nAs usual, Veraher, irritated and ready to be whipped, felt a cold iron touch on his face.\n“Lord Yakt Spinner!”\nThe most feared being in this serf labor field.\nEven the Lionheart King and the Magician Queen are wraiths in their own right, but this killing machine drives the serfs to their death.\nSecond only to the stinging lunatic Lionheart, this horrific creature has the highest serf mortality rate and it was right in front of him.\n“Now, wrong….”\n-Follow me, number 137. I have a mission for you.\n“Yes?”\nVeraher, who thought he was going to be cut to pieces by the wire, followed Yappy, relieved to be alive. In addition to Veraher, Yappy had recruited a hundred more serfs.\nThey followed Yappy to the heart of the factory being built, where they learned it would contain the energy fuel rods that would power it.\nIt was weird. Every time they followed Yappy, he felt a strange tingling sensation all over his body and a nauseous feeling in his stomach.\n“Hey, Yakt Spinner… What the hell is this…….?”\nThey arrive at a horrifyingly holy space, and in the center of it all…was a neatly machined cylindrical wand.\nIt’s unmistakable.\nThose are fuel rods, forged from the finest stellar iron.\n-Transferring the fuel rods to the Maintenance now.\nMoving those things? Just watching from a distance makes them shudder, it’s like being asked to die!\n“Hey, Yakt Spinner…I don’t think we should move those to …….”\n-Ordinary workers also suffer from holy power excess. Drones also malfunction when exposed to high concentrations of holy power.\nWe’re going to die!\nThe serfs wanted to throw up their hands in frustration, but Yappy’s camera eye was still cold.\n-Do it.\nThey heard the order and against their will, the serfs trudged toward the stardust fuel rods.\nSerf radiation mortality rate 100%.\nSixteen days without an incident.\n* * * *\n“Ohhh…….”\nHanbit Palace Lord Park Yong-shin looked at the factory built on the ruins of the defunct Hanbit Palace and sighed in admiration.\nThe building style was futuristic, different from the modern Earth and Park Yong-shin almost thinks he’s in the future.\n“Mr. President, please enter!”\nThe ceremonial red carpet was rolled out, and President Ahn Dong-gil and other government officials entered.\n“Welcome, Mr. President.”\n“Palace Lord Park.”\nCultist aside, Park Yong-shin, the guild leader of one of South Korea’s top 10 guilds, shook the president’s hand.\n“This is the new factory…….”\n“A workshop, Mr. President.”\n“…….”\nPresident Ahn looked at the giant factory, which was not a normal size even by his standards, and glared at Park Yong-shin for calling it a workshop.\nThey are similar but have a completely different legal interpretation.\nIt’s a tax issue and the construction permit issue is also different.\n“Let’s go to the podium, where His Majesty Lionheart and Lord Yakt Spinner, the workshop master, are waiting.”\nWith Park Yong-shin’s guidance, President Ahn faced Leon, who was waiting at the podium.\n“Oh, President Ahn, my friend. Welcome.”\nAhn wanted to say, “Why am I your friend, you democracy destroyer?” but he couldn’t because he knew Leon’s irritation would grow out of control.\n“Haha, Your Majesty. It’s been a long time.”\n“Yes, thank you for coming today to celebrate the completion of TTG Temple’s new workshop. I’m afraid we’ve attracted more attention than I expected.”\n“That’s because you built the factory right where the meteorite fell…….”\nIt was a six-kilometer meteorite and its value was proven in the defeat of the Demon Archduke of Slaughter.\nLeon planned to issue a downgraded version of the Stellar Iron Armor to the entire army, a plan that caused a stir in the country.\n-Your Majesty.\n“Ugh…!”\nPresident Ahn and the government dignitaries gagged as the massive fuselage of the Yakt Spinner approached.\nFour to five times the size of a tank, there’s something about this killing machine that overwhelms people with its cold camera eyes alone.\n“Lord Spinner, what is it?”\n-The factory is up and running. Urged to move forward.\n“Hmm, that’s fast. All that grinding of serfs was worth it.”\n-Leaves plenty of serfs behind.\n“…….”\nGrinding? What’s left? President Ahn stared at the 32nd day of no accidents sign hanging above the entrance to the workshop.\n‘If there are no accidents, why are there so many beds…….?’\nPresident Ahn averted his gaze.\n“Well, then, let’s start the cutting ceremony, everyone, please smile for the camera!”\nAfter the world’s most awkward cutting ceremony, President Ahn walked into the workshop with Leon.\n“Wow…….”\nPresident Ahn toured several workshops run by domestic craftsmen.\nThe quality of the items produced in the country is crucial to improving the power of the hunters. It is no exaggeration to say that master craftsmanship is directly linked to national security.\nTypically, it’s the work of individual craftsmen, often with the full support of large corporations, to forge swords and polish armor.\nEven with modern technology, hunter armor still relies on such primitive means.\nBut Yappy workshop was different.\n-Clank, clank, clank!\nThe rails spin, carrying large chunks of ore.\nThe ore is carefully sliced by an ultra-precise crusher, which breaks down the gas layer, water, and methane into pure iron.\nAnd there are many facilities to process it. Presses and charged particle accelerators pound and polish the stellar iron.\nAt the end of the day, swords, spears, and armor are cast.\nFully automated workshops, not hammered by hand like the masters.\n‘It’s a factory…….’\nOf course, this type of workshop isn’t new. It’s just that they take the form of factories to mass-produce cheap equipment.\n“Your Majesty, Mr. President, here’s a prototype.”\nThe armor brought in by one of the employees had an aura of formality about it. Even for the outsider, President Ahn, it was an unusual piece of armor.\n“Appraisal results…Unique item ‘Star Iron Content Mass Production Armor’…….”\n‘Unique items were something that could be mass-produced?’\nFrom what he heard, it’s an item that even the best workshops in the country have to work hard to make.\nAn item that is printed in a factory is a unique item?\n“Hmm, not bad.”\n‘Not bad!’\nPresident Ahn is stunned by Leon’s assessment.\n“It’s not even blessed by the gods, it’s just coated. Well, I didn’t expect the workshop to be able to mass-produce it so quickly.”\n“Oh, that’s great.”\nStill, he thought that a medieval king from another world with old-fashioned values wouldn’t have much in the way of science and technology, but the more he looked, the more he was surprised.\nPresident Ahn wonders if Leon will build a country like this.\n-Your Majesty, I need your advice.\n“Advice?”\n-Your armor. Under construction. No matter how much I work on it, it will never be as good as Holy Knight Antoine’s.\nLeon had heard about the armor Yappy had been working on.\nIt was said to be 99.9% complete, just 0.1% short.\n-This.\nYappy showed him the armor he had brought, and as soon as he saw it, President Ahn gasped.\nThe armor is so beautiful and perfect. The refined lines and perfection of the armor were enough to impress even ordinary people.\nSuch a treasure, was still ‘unfinished’?\n“Don’t be too hard on yourself. This king’s armor is the perfect armor forged by Heto, the God of Blacksmith, when he descended upon Lord Antoine. Recreating it is a task beyond the reach of even the Blacksmith Holy Knights.”\nLeon’s words were meant to be encouraging, but somehow Yappy was not convinced.\nIf Antoine could do it, he should be able to do it. It’s a stubborn insistence that he, an artificially intelligent being, can’t be outclassed by organic matter…\n-Will investigate further.\n“Hmm…very well. If it is your will, then try it until you are satisfied.”\nIndeed, can Lord Spinner recreate his former armor?\nIf he could, it would be no exaggeration to say that Yappy had indeed approached the feat of a god.\n* * * *\nAfter the formalities of the ceremony, President Ahn Dong-il and Leon sat down separately for a more intimate discussion.\n“Please speak.”\nThe two exchanged pleasantries before Ahn cut to the chase.\n“Your Majesty, are all the items produced in this workshop going to be supplied to the soldiers only?”\nAfter taking a long look around the factory, President Ahn realized that he had to fulfill the request from Oh Kang-hyuk to secure the star iron armor.\n‘Although it is not comparable to the Knight’s Star Iron Armor, it is an amazing item just because it contains star iron.’\nIf they could arm their hunters with it, it would be a huge step forward.\n“If you don’t mind, why don’t you supply our government’s Hunter Association with the armor produced by this workshop?”\n“Oh, Kang-hyuk, that friend must have asked President Ahn.”\n“Yes…Our country’s hunters need these armor pieces to increase their survival rate.”\nLeon thought about President Ahn’s request for a moment but he’s already making enough money and he’s not in a hurry.\nIt would be more beneficial for him to receive something other than money.\n“It shouldn’t be too hard to get some stardust-coated armor. Though I can’t give you the blessing of the gods.”\n“That would be enough!”\nOf course, it’s not a losing proposition, as Leon also needs things from the government.\nPresident Ahn, who had guaranteed accommodations for the large guilds and their recently octopus-footed affiliates, was the last to be cautious.\n“Uh… Your Majesty, I actually received a letter from the United Nations recently.”\n“The United Nations? The United Nations of the world?”\nPresident Ahn wanted to know what he thought of a letter from the United Nations about human rights abuses in the TTG Temple.\n‘The sugar-salt water in TTG Temple is very famous, but it’s only served temporarily during the training period, and there are no other human rights abuses.’\nHe was especially cautious about the existence of serfs who had been “kidnapped” from the Demon Archduke’s estate.\n“What do you mean, human rights abuses? There are no such things.”\n“Well, is it?”\nDon’t bullshit me, I know all about it…….\n“Nothing to worry about. This king doesn’t exploit ‘humans’, only justice.”\nSerfs aren’t humans.\n“Still…there have been so many reports that the United Nations will be sending their own inspectors.”\n“I see.”\n“They’ll be looking into the illegal use of the gate…and the accidents that occurred during the construction of the factory, so I thought I’d offer my government’s help until they arrive.”\nYou mobilized serfs to change the gate, right? And you faked accidents while building the factory, right?\nThe government is going to help you rig it, so take it.\n“That’s fine. No problem.”\nHe nods.\n“Are they really coming to investigate?”\n‘Seriously. You think you can stop them?’\n“Hehe, this king has no shame under heaven.”\nIf they’re coming, let them come.\nPresident Ahn was jumping up and down like crazy.",

      "content": "Chapter 145: Living with the Kikiruks\nInspectors from the United Nations are coming.\nWhen the news broke, all the worshippers of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods thought to themselves.\n“”What’s coming is coming!””\nYes, they had to admit that the behavior of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods is far removed from the common sense of modern Earth.\nNot to mention the exorbitant tax structure of the ten-tiered system, with its huge welfare costs…….\n“Sugar-salt water is out, out, out. Not to mention the 20-hour workdays.”\n“The cadets are not treated like people at all, even if it’s only for a month.”\n“Did you see the looks on the faces of the second-year cadets? They were frozen.”\n“They’re treated like interns and then paid like interns with ‘voluntary’ contributions.”\nWell, that’s about it.\nThe sugar-salt water only gets you through the training period, and when it’s time to attack the gate, you eat a proper field meal.\nSurprisingly, the most evil part of the system doesn’t feel like a loss because of the infinite welfare.\nThe knights’ star iron armor alone is worth billions of won in legendary equipment, and the star iron-containing armor given to the soldiers is worth hundreds of millions of won.\nWhen you’re in a position where you can’t see such luxury items in your lifetime, you have no choice but to be generous to those who give and take.\nThere was another problem.\n“The serfs… aren’t they a problem?”\n“…….”\nSoo-ho was left speechless by Jae-hyuk’s words but Chun So-yeon retorted sharply.\n“They’re demon followers, not people. Senior Ha-ri thinks so too, doesn’t she?”\n“Yeah, but……do you think the Human Rights Commission thinks so too?”\n“…….”\nOkay, this is the problem.\nThe UN’s Human Rights Committee for Survivors is sensitive to the survival rights of those beyond the gates. Even if they’re half-human and half-horse, they’re intelligent beings. The way they’re being treated here is-\n[Die, you minions of the Evil One!!]\nThey were forced to act as suicide squads and-\n[Stuck? Why stop? Struggling? Exposed? No power. Organic matter of lesser content must have no power to overcome machines. Work harder, slave.]\nFalling rocks, multiple cases of sexual maladjustment…a cold-blooded killing machine with a 77% mortality rate…….\n[Wow, this one’s fresh. They were all in pretty bad shape from the rough ride……our test subject friend. How’s your pain tolerance?]\nMmm. I’m afraid the first two cases are at least humane.\n“……Dangerous?”\nRegardless of their legitimate concerns, Leon didn’t think much of the inspectors.\n“Hmph, what are you so worried about? If you have no shame on your conscience, you have nothing to worry about.”\n“Your Majesty… but still…….”\n“That, the eyes of the world.”\n“Uh-huh, even if there is nothing to worry about.”\n“…….”\nOh no. No amount of persuasion will work.\nAt this rate, they’ll be facing UN sanctions and global condemnation!\n“Your Majesty!”\n“…….”\nLeon turned to look at Han Ha-ri, who stepped forward with her hand raised in the air. She spoke with a determined expression.\n“This time, the UN inspectors will be greeted by me and Lord Yappy, leave it to us!”\n-What?\nWhy are you putting me in there?\nYappy tilted his head and flashed a puzzled emoticon.\n* * * *\nThe UN inspectors have arrived.\nThe Hunter’s Association had been waiting for them at Incheon Airport, along with a government limousine bus.\n“I’m Oh Kang-hyuk, president of the Hunter Association.”\n“I’m Louisse from the United Nations Commission on Survivors and Human Rights. It’s an honor to meet this Korean legend.”\nLouisse wondered why the head of the Korean Hunter Association was waiting for her.\nShe’d heard from Dennis that the Korean government and the association had an unspoken relationship with TTG Temple, but was this an unspoken pressure?\n‘Hmph, you want to take over the issue, no way.’\nLouise is a woman who has defended the human rights of survivors in many powerful countries and dictatorships. She is used to this kind of pressure.\n“The official will be escorted by our association’s representative, Han Ha-ri.”\nAs Oh Kang-hyuk spoke, a young girl in a suit walked up to her and nodded.\n“I’m Deputy Han Ha-ri, please take care of me!”\nShe spoke decent…native English.\n“You look young, but you have perfect British pronunciation. I hear Koreans are very educated, did you study abroad or something?”\n“What? Ah! No, I’m a native Korean. I’m speaking Korean right now.”\n“What?”\nHa-ri smiles at the puzzled Louise and shows her a choker-like device at the nape of her neck.\n“It’s a real-time translator, made by a very smart man.”\n“Wow, Korean technology is amazing…….I’ve seen the Tower use an artifact enchanted to translate, but this is even better.”\nHow can an interpreting machine mimic native pronunciation? Louise wondered if it was really a machine.\n“Haha, I guess any technology that’s advanced enough is magical, right? Here you go, these machines will translate the language of the Kikiruks we’re about to meet.”\nThat was a good thing. For the survivors, it would translate like a passive voice, but the Kikiruks had a different phonetic structure that made their language unintelligible.\nWith this translator, they wouldn’t have a hard time translating.\n“By the way, I thought Miss Han was with the TTG Temple?”\n“Ms. Han is technically a seconded employee dispatched to the TTG Temple keeping a close eye on it.”\nSurvivors are people who come from worlds with different common sense than Earth. It’s not uncommon to send guides to help them adjust to modern civilization.\nThe Society’s response and care has been exemplary. But…….\n‘The government and the private guild are too close.’\nDespite her suspicions of the Association, Louisse boarded the limousine bus.\n“Our first stop will be Mokpo, which is currently home to 18,744 Kikiruks.”\n“That’s less than the original number, has there been a population shift?”\n“Oh, yes, there are currently 3,251 Kikiruks working at the TTG Temple compound in Naju Plain.”\n“Hmm…I thought the Kikiruks were a maritime race, but now that they’re inland, are there any inconveniences?”\n“They have built their dwellings on the banks of the Yongsan River, which runs through the plains. It’s a matter of preference, but they can function with a similar amount of water as humans.”\nIn short, as long as there is water, there is no problem with inland activities.\nAfter a few questions on the bus, they arrived in Mokpo, a typical port city.\nOn the waterfront, locals and Kikiruks were interacting with each other, and it didn’t feel out of place.\n“Most of the Kikiruks are active here and interact with the people of Mokpo. The population has increased by about 10 percent since the Kikiruks moved in, so the local economy has been revitalized.”\nThe UN inspector, guided by Ha-ri, checked things and the conclusion was basically positive.\n“I’ve heard that the Kikiruks live by the sea, and as a port city, there could be territorial disputes with fishermen, but what’s the reality?”\n“Oh, Mokpo is a consumer city with a shrinking fishing industry and a shipbuilding and heavy industrial complex, so there’s not a lot of friction. There are small fishing boats around, but they work with the Kikiruks.”\n“I don’t suppose that’s enough work for them?”\nThe overall survivor’s right to survive is what they focused on.\nHousing is important, but steady, non-discriminatory work is the most important aspect of survivors’ rights.\n“That’s perfectly fine!”\nHa-ri says confidently, squaring her shoulders.\n“The Kikiruks are heavily involved in the government’s marine pollution cleanup program! They retrieve trash and net scraps from the bottom of the ocean, and since fish is their staple food, they have a lot of aquaculture skills.”\n“That’s certainly…a high percentage of government work. Shipbuilders? That’s a bit surprising.”\n“Oh, that’s the new technology shipbuilding part of Lord Yappy…no, I mean Lord Yakt Spinner’s program to train Kikiruk technicians.”\nYakt Spinner it’s a name Louise knows well. She heard that it’s a super AI robot, but there’s a lot of controversy about whether it should be treated as a person, even though there are laws against survivors.\nIn any case, the shipbuilding industry, which incorporates new technologies, is being used, so she thought the Kikiruks wouldn’t lose their job even if they were excluded from government projects.\nMost of the government projects that mobilized survivors were in the iron and steel business, so they were only employed for a short time with subsidies, and the jobs were very precarious.\n“This is the Kikiruks enclave, separated by a special administrative zone near the beach──”\n-Bang!\nAs they were heading to the Kikiruk settlement, a loud boom erupted from the beach.\n“What’s going on!”\n“Ah, um…nothing!”\nLouise narrowed her eyes at Ha-ri’s suspicious look and Ha-ri was embarrassed, but she spoke honestly.\n“It’s probably the sound of the Kikiruk commandos training.”\n“……Kikiruk commandos?”\n“More than three thousand of them are warriors and they’ve been practicing recently because His Majesty ordered a sea exercise.”\nUtilize survivors as soldiers or hunters. That was the most obvious occupation for the survivors.\nPerhaps that’s why the orcs, the most prosperous race at the moment, are recognized despite their viciousness.\nA naturally athletic race, they were as capable in combat as the Hunters.\nAfter observing the Kikiruks for a while, they took notes and moved on to their next target.\n* * * *\n“You’re settling in quite nicely, I see.”\n“Yes, officer. It is safe to say that the Kikiruks are the best of the best when it comes to housing and jobs.”\n“And they’re doing a good job of recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of the race and integrating them without conflict with the existing population. The Kikiruks are well-received in the city.”\nThis was evidence that the assimilation of the Kikiruks was systematic and calculated.\nWhoever had planned it, it was a near-miraculous feat to accomplish with so little conflict with the existing population.\nDwarves, not to mention the immediate orcs, frequently clashed with humans, as did dwarves digging up otherwise intact mountains and triggering landslides, and elves growing forests in urban centers.\nThe different races, with their different ideas and cultures, did not easily integrate into the culture and life of human society, and if it got out of hand, it could lead to a “coup d’état”.\nOrc coups are a frequent occurrence in the fractured and fragmented Greater China.\n“The TTG Temple is rational and reasonable enough in its management of ethnic groups, and it’s a win-win situation, not a one-sided support.”\n“It’s a fairly idealized situation, even if the YouTube video is propaganda to some extent.”\n“Religious proselytizing went pretty smoothly, too. From what I hear, the entire Kikiruks worship the God of the Sea and Waves.”\n“They seem to worship him as well. Did you see that statue in the middle of the ocean?”\n“Yes, that enormous statue. That’s how deep their worship is.”\n“I’ve never had a problem interviewing Kikiruks, their approval ratings are absolute.”\nThe more she listened, the weirder it got.\nLeon is basically revered as a righteous, good, leader, even if his common sense is different since he is from another world.\nThe atmosphere in Korea is not bad either.\nIt’s often said that he’s a bit of a prick, but he’s also fair and fiercely pursues justice.\nShe can’t help but wonder if the Lion King would be at the top of the list if he were to run in the next presidential election.\nHe has brought a lot of change to South Korea.\nSo far, he has only spread good vibes, with no negative vibes whatsoever.\nAnd yet, he would be so ruthless with prisoners of war?\nDoes it make sense?\nAfter carefully reviewing YouTube videos, testimonies, and activities before coming here, Louise couldn’t help but like him the more she got to know him.\nThe old-fashioned way of thinking is a cultural difference, and being a royalty in a medieval worldview has never caused any harm, even though he is authoritarian in his dealings with President Ahn and others.\nHe is a hero among heroes with absolute support in both Korea and Japan.\n‘Maybe it’s a misunderstanding…….’\nWould such a righteous hero treat prisoners harshly?\nWouldn’t he have tried to assimilate in a moderate and appropriate way, like the Kikiruks?\nCouldn’t this all be a misunderstanding?\n“We’ve arrived! This is the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Gods, the Holy Land of Naju!”\nAnd that’s when Louisse realized.\n“We are blessed to be here.”\n“Waaaaaah, long live the Lionheart King.”\n“Abuse? There’s no such thing!”\n“We are treated humanely and live in peace.”\n“Forced labor? No, that’s not true at all, we’re doing it voluntarily!”\nEveryone claims that there are no abuses, no massacres, as promised.\nHumane treatment and peaceful days.\nBut why…….\nIn the eyes of the half-men who speak of happiness──\n”Please let us live.”\nIs it so much desperation?",

      "content": "Chapter 146: The United Nations Human Rights Council\nThe serfs were hopeful until the UN inspectors arrived.\nCould they get out of this hellhole based on the results of the inspections?\nIf the UN pressured the Korean government and the Korean government pressured TTG Temple, they might be free?\nFaced with that hope, they formed a plan in whispers.\n-Let’s collect evidence. Proof that we are being mistreated.\n-A video record would be the strongest evidence. Don’t we have something similar here?\n-There’s a smartphone that the knights carry and works even in the gates.\n-Okay, let’s steal one and record.\nThey’re all set, and they’re planning to contact the UN inspectors in secret. But──\n“The UN inspectors are coming. Forbidden to speak to them.”\nFrom then on, Yapppy would dictate the behavior of the serfs in minute detail, and enslaved by the power of the sun and judgment, they could not disobey the orders of their Higher Power.\nThus began Operation I Am Happy.\nThe serfs were not allowed to say anything in front of the inspectors who had come to save them.\n‘Ugh…!’\n‘You evil bastards…!’\nNo words could describe their inhumane treatment and unreasonable conditions, so they were forced to put on this cheap play.\n‘Please notice!’\n‘Please!\nWhile everyone looked desperate to be spared, the head inspector, Louise, frowned.\n‘Is it my mood?’\nShe was about to speak when she sensed something was wrong.\n-Whirr.\n”Hiccup!!!”\nThe mechanical sound of the Yakt Spinner, which had appeared like a ghost, stiffened them.\n“Yakt…Lord Spinner, huh?”\nLouise greeted the survivor Yakt Spinner, the subject of her latest inspection.\n“United Nations Officer Louise Foster. Pleased to meet you.”\n-It’s mealtime..\n“Ah… I see.”\nShe didn’t object to the idea of meals being prepared in the TTG Temple, but it was faster than she expected.\nWhat Louise didn’t realize was that the steel spider had a camera eye on its back and was terrorizing the serfs with skull emojis from a blind spot she didn’t see.\nThe protruding machine gun was a bonus.\n“Hiccup…!”\nThe serfs shuddered and clamped their mouths shut. Meanwhile, the UN inspectors were brought in to eat.\n“What an unusual dining facility.”\nThe dining hall of the TTG Temple is not a neat interior of an intelligent building, but a scene of a rural feast.\nIt was indeed rural.\n-There’s a lot of food, so active eating is encouraged.\nYappy shared one meal after another with the villagers, and then Louise said.\n“We’re going to eat with the serfs.”\nShe had come to investigate their conditions. She wasn’t looking for a special treat reserved for dignitaries.\n“I hope you don’t mind, Lord Yakt Spinner.”\n-No matter.\nLouise strode confidently to the serfs’ table, followed by the UN staff of the Inspectorate.\nIf they think the serfs are being treated unfairly, they’ll do anything to fix it.\nShe’s seen dictators and backward nations impose harsh conditions on savage survivors who think dog food is good enough, and she’s fought for human rights.\nShe would soon find a place at the table of the serfs.\n“This is…….”\nThe meal was more authentic than she expected.\nRice and locally grown vegetables. The lack of meat-based dishes was a bit surprising, but not surprising given the country’s food culture.\n“Oh, you want to eat here? I’ve prepared some gochujang and ssambap today.”\n“Ssap, ssambap?”\nWhatever it was, the meal didn’t seem strange. Louis and the inspectors took their seats and ate a meal that was meant for serfs.\nMiso ssambap was a strange dish for her as a German, but… if she thought of it as a healthy diet meal, wouldn’t it be okay?\n“Huh?”\nAs the vegetables and rice melted into her mouth, Louise felt a rush of freshness that seemed to clear her head.\nThe warm rice and the saltiness of the fermented miso in it were in harmony with the fresh green vegetables.\nIf that were all there was to it, she would have called it orientalism and hailed the mysteries of the East but this meal was different.\n‘Come to think of it… the Blessed Crop, the biggest specialty of TTG Temple…….’\nThe miracle food, which is said to cure cancer and make you healthy just by eating it, is also famous in Europe.\nIn European markets, small amounts of blessed crops are sold on a reservation system.\nHowever, she heard that it is a luxury product that costs millions of won per kilogram due to its scarcity.\nAfter trying it, Louise’s impression was indeed indescribable.\n‘My head is clear, my fatigue from the long flight is gone, and I feel like I’ve just had a full three-hour massage.’\nFamous internet testimonials claimed that one bite was enough to make a difference.\n‘They’re feeding their employees this precious food and they don’t care.’\nKing Lionheart… what the hell are you…….\nReports of the human rights abuses of the serfs were that they were being fed horrible sugar-salt water but they must have been wrong.\nEven if this is just a trick of the eye, the blessed crops in front of them are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nA truly abusive employer with a history of human rights abuses would have served a more colorful and normal meal.\nNot these seemingly humble, yet incredibly valuable, ingredients.\n“…….”\n“…….”\nAt that moment, Louise’s gaze fell on some of her coworkers, who were looking sheepishly at the meal in front of them.\n“You guys won’t eat? The food tastes amazing and it’s also healthy.”\n“Well, it’s…….”\nWhen asked, Dennis held up his palms in humility.\n“It’s just that I can’t eat fermented foods…….”\n“Oh, I see. How about everyone else?”\n“Me neither…….”\n“I don’t like the taste.”\nSeveral employees didn’t eat, perhaps because they were intolerant of Eastern vegetarian diets, and those who did, including Louise, marveled at the benefits.\n“Did everyone enjoy the meal?”\nHa-ri asked crisply and Louise replied.\n“Yes, it was invaluable.”\n“Ah, I’m glad to hear that. If you don’t mind, would you like to take a walk and talk? His Majesty is waiting for you.”\n“Of course.”\nLouis gets up to leave with the Inspectorate staff. She was confident that the report was false, especially for a temple that served such a fine meal at every meal.\nOf course, she still needed to investigate further.\n‘Wow, that was really satisfying. On the way back, a bag of rice…No, that’s a bribe, let’s buy it when it’s on the market.’\nBecause the meal was satisfying Louise didn’t see it but several of the serfs, who were enjoying the meal more than anything else in the world, fell face down on the table.\n-Yikes!\nTheir fallen bodies were quickly hidden from view.\n* * * *\n“Suspicious!”\nInspector Dennis said.\n“What do you mean, Dennis?”\nDennis raised his voice at Louise’s questioning glance.\n“Did you see their gaze and their expressions, they were not ordinary to anyone!”\n“That’s right, it was clear that they were being forced to do something!”\n“…….”\nLouise recalled the atmosphere and it was definitely suspicious.\nEveryone was awkwardly talking about happiness as if they were reading from a language book, and their gazes were somber.\n“But there’s nothing to complain about in terms of housing, jobs, or treatment. Of course, it’s not time to jump to conclusions.”\nMore research was needed and she was not planning to return to the islands already.\n“There’s still time, so each of you investigators should continue your exploration of the area around the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods.”\nWith that conclusion, Denis left the dormitory provided by the TTG Temple and got in his car to head into the city.\nHow far had he gotten? Denis’s car was engulfed in darkness, and a muffled voice came from beyond.\n[Dennis──]\n“Oh, great being…!”\nAs he stopped driving, he could feel the heat in the back seat. In the rearview mirror, he could see the silhouettes of the Great One, the Malignant One, and those who had contracted with him.\nThe others are far below him, mere followers. Dennis began to report to the Malignant One from beyond.\n“As you ordered, it was not difficult to dispatch the Human Rights Council inspectors to the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods.”\n[Well done, the weak idealism of the humans is so weak]\nIt was Dennis, an insider, who tipped off the UN.\nThe Demons have followers all over the world. In the private sector, in government positions, in the cracks of the United Nations… they’re everywhere.\n[Human rights, right to survival, that sort of thing is easier to move around]\n“That’s right. Who knew the orc expansion thing would work out so well?”\nIt was their ruse that got the UN Survivors’ Rights Committee to extend orc rights globally.\nOrcs are a formidable fighting force, but they are also unruly and antisocial.\nThey are quick to resort to violence and do not take orders from those weaker than themselves. This includes executive orders and law enforcement.\nSuch orcs are prolific breeders, growing in numbers and expanding into the mainstream of the region.\nBy embracing these orcs, Dennis and his demonic followers were able to accelerate the terraforming of the gate clearance and ravage the world.\nTheir ultimate goal is to give voting rights to the orcs.\nOrcs were basically the same age as humans when it came to adulthood, but their physical age was only five, so the plan was to lower the voting age significantly.\nWith a few tears for democracy and orc rights in the name of multiracialism, the hypocrites of the West would be forced to extend voting rights to orcs.\nFrom there, it was simple.\nSimple orc demagoguery rallies the vote, and politicians expand orcs in the hope of garnering their votes.\nThe destruction of the world would be hastened by the fact that a world with an orc majority would not be able to function properly.\n“Stupid humans will not overcome the great immortals in the end.”\nThe demons’ plan will be completed with the support of those in high places who know this will happen, who will be hypocritical because of their political ambitions, and those who will think they are doing great justice.\n“But, Great One.”\n[What is going on?]\n“I don’t mean to question the Great One’s plan, but I doubt the South Korean government will impose sanctions if our inspectors expose the true state of the TTG Temple. The relationship between the TTG Temple and the government is too close.”\nIn the first place, TTG Temple was organized and supported by Oh Kang-hyuk of the Korean Hunter Association.\nEven the president was supporting him in a bipartisan move.\nHe heard that they made a deal with him that they would do anything for him as long as he didn’t get involved in politics, but it’s not official.\n[It doesn’t matter, as long as we could sway public opinion and keep his feet on the ground]\n“I don’t think that’s going to work──”\n[Do you think this is just for my pleasure? Your fate is at stake, too! Look!]\nA finger moved in the darkness, and an image appeared.\n-Boom! Boom!\nThey see serfs mining a gigantic meteor.\nFollowers of the demons, like Dennis, were captives taken from the Archduke estate.\n“I know this.”\nIt was then that the meteor, shaken by the pickaxe blows, splintered and fell as rocks, crashing down on the serfs.\n“Aaah!”\n-Thud!\nWith a dizzying sound, the peasants exploded like blown porridge and the Kikiruk overseer approached.\n-Kiruk!\nGet to work, slave.\nThe untranslated words were clear enough to make Dennis’ fists clench.\n“You’ll be damned…….”\nThe next scene was from inside the factory. The serfs looked somber as their bodies were scorched by the holy power of Star Iron.\nThen, boom! Even as they collapsed, the Kikiruk overseers whipped them to their feet.\n“Poisonous bastards…….”\nNext up were images from inside the gate.\nThey must have shared the view of one of the serfs, for it was playing a horrific scene in real time.\n[Serf Ballista, load up!]\nSerf Ballista? What’s that…….?\n“Ah, ah, ah…….”\nThis is horrible. This… this is what people do!\nThe shared vision sobs and fills with tears. Sobbing, he bade farewell to his fellow serfs.\n[Remember me…!]\n[[I’ll remember…!]]\nThat was the last of the footage.\n[Do you see? This is the future ruled by the Lionheart King, and you will die as expendables to that psychopathic maniac!]\nIt was a ploy to build up some sort of motivation, and it worked very well.\n“Filthy fanatics… Revolution! We need revolution!”\n“But, Great One… if we’re going to do it right, won’t we get caught?”\n[It’s okay, the artifacts I gave you should be fine for the duration of the inspection!]\n“I see! I’m relieved!”\nDennis was relieved, and his sense of mission ignited. Heavenly punishment for this evil classist!\nAnd he will usher the world into a new age of demons!\n……\n…\n“I will kill him!”\n“Hang the demons!”\n“I will burn them to death!”\nWhy…….\n-Bam! The trial begins.\nWhat happened?",

      "content": "Chapter 147: Collective Intelligence\nChoi Mingyong, a native Naju farmer and priest of life and abundance at the Ten Thousand Gods Temple, has been a devotee of Leon’s since his first visit.\nFor years, he had stared in disbelief at the land that had become barren and contaminated with miasma.\nThere are dozens of people who have lost their land in Naju and are in debt because they keep buying expensive purification products from the Tower.\nNaju was not the only place in Korea that was contaminated with miasma, and not only farmers, but also people who had lost their homes and were living in other places.\nTheir hope is that one day a powerful purifier will come along to cleanse the land and bring relief.\nBut no one could do anything about the miasma-infested land, and they could only wait and trust in empty promises.\n“This is the Lionheart King. He represents all the gods, and he is the Knight King of the Knights of Glory.”\nBut then he appeared.\nHe purified the land, as even the wizards of the Tower could not, and brought the Goddess of Life and Abundance to this land.\nI can’t tell how I felt when I first ate the blessed crops.\nMy neighbor Kim was cured of dementia, my liver cured of cirrhosis, and new teeth grew.\nThe population of rural areas is mostly elderly. In this smart era, the lack of young people is a global problem.\nThe elderly get sick and injured easily.\nFor them, Leon’s presence is the dawn of a new era, as they have left the prime of their lives and are waiting for the day they die.\nThey are rejuvenated, healthy, and have gained strength they never had in their prime.\nAll they had to do was eat the crops the goddess had blessed them with and follow their noble code.\n“Mr. Choi!”\n“Uh, Mr. Park.”\nChoi Mingyong approached Mr. Park’s workshop, where he repaired the village’s farm equipment and tractors.\nHe owned a hardware store and used to repair broken tractors, but the quality of his work had greatly benefited from the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods, as he believed in Heto, the God of Iron and Blacksmithing.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Just tinkering with the tractor that Lord Yappy improved this week.”\nYappy had been using holographic drones to train the worshippers of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods on a weekly basis.\nMr. Park was in the middle of a crash course as an iron and blacksmithing priest.\n“You know, some of us are setting up a garden at home this time. I made some sickles and hoes for it. How about it, do you want to buy some?”\n“Hmm…….”\nMr. Choi was troubled. According to the doctrine, the use of farmlands is subject to the taxes, but a small garden of about 12 square meters is not taxed.\nWhen he asked His Majesty why, he was told that private gardens are not considered an extension of the country’s farmland, but rather a personal hobby.\nNow that he is the highest priest of Demera in the Naju Plains, he realizes that the tenets of the TTG Temple are not as rigid as he thought.\n‘We don’t rely on rules and regulations to maintain social order, but on conscience and goodwill.’\nIt’s a rather loophole-ridden system that can be exploited but Choi saw it as a blind spot.\nThe unholy will be destroyed, and then their souls will be torn apart.\n“How do you do?”\nIt was then that a white man with a snotty nose who looked out of place in rural Korea appeared.\n“Huh? Who are you?”\n“Oh, I’m Denis, a United Nations inspector.”\n“Why, didn’t they say that they were coming to inspect or something?”\nMr. Choi told Mr. Park what he heard from priestess Ha-ri, that the UN was coming to inspect or something.\nWith the outrageous charge that TTG Temple was “suppressing human rights.”\nMr. Choi and Mr. Park’s gazes narrowed.\n“It’s not that──”\nDennis continued his question in as friendly a manner as possible to the locals.\n‘They’re members of the TTG Temple, which enforce the Ten Commandments. They must have some complaints!’\n“Why is it, Mr. European, that you are so interested in Wool Village?”\n“Well, Wool Village is doing well these days.”\nThe voices were friendly, but the gazes of the two were sharp as hawks, and Dennis carefully steered the conversation.\n“I see a lot of exotic people here, are they all foreign workers?”\nDennis knew who they were: half-human, half-demon. That is, his elders, the demons’ followers.\nThe thought of them being forced to work in this stinking countryside brings tears to his eyes.\n“No. His Majesty has ordered them to make life easier for old men like us.”\nRight! The corners of Dennis’s mouth lifted.\n“Are you a devotee of the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods?”\n“…….”\nMr. Choi was silent with a smirk on his face while Dennis, cringing at the shy old man’s gaze, pushed his questions further.\n“What their salary, and just a few questions about the working conditions──”\n“Heh~ Why are you so interested in the affairs of His Majesty and the Wool village?”\nDennis is puzzled by Mr. Park’s voice.\n“Oh, no, not that…….”\n“No, no, no! I’m saying that Wool village is exploiting those people!”\nDennis backed away in horror as Mr. Park raised his scythe imbued with holy power!\n“We fed them on time and gave them a bed! What the fuck do you think you’re doing?”\n“Enough.”\n“Choi…!”\n“Uhhhh, if you can’t control yourself, you’re an embarrassment to His Majesty.”\n“Hmph…….”\nMr. Choi glared at Denis with hateful eyes.\n“We’ll talk about that later. I’m going to show him around the village.”\n“Oh, yeah… yeah…….”\nDennis was forced to back down by the overly polarizing Mr. Park. Staring at his back, Mr. Choi said.\n“Mr. Park.”\n“Yes.”\n“Get the kids’ tools. Tonight, we have a big job to do.”\nUN inspectors should feel the horrors of rural, closed societies to the bone.\n* * * *\nAnd so the villagers, who didn’t like the idea of the U.N. survivors’ rights inspectors poking around, raided their lodgings in the middle of the night and hanged Louise and the inspectors.\n“Hang them!”\n“Hang the demons!”\n“We must burn them to death!”\nThe people’s insane collective intelligence and outbursts were beyond Louise comprehension.\nThis was South Korea, one of the most developed countries in the world?\nNo matter how rural it is, it’s still a country, and they’re going to hang an inspection team sent by the United Nations like this?\n“This is ridiculous!”\nDuring her human rights investigations, Louise had encountered soldiers who threatened her life or used force to seize documents many times but never anyone like this, who threatened to burn her to death.\n“Everyone, everyone, calm down. What’s going on? If we’ve done anything wrong, we apologize.”\nLouise tried to calm the mob down but her desperate cries had no effect.\n‘That’s right! I forgot my translator!’\nHa-ri handed her the translator but she couldn’t get it as she was being hastily dragged away. She was going to be burned at the stake if she doesn’t move──\n-Bam!\nIt was then that a cuddly, minimalist mechanical spider landed in front of the UN inspectors as they were about to be burned at the stake.\n“Lord Yappy!”\n“Sir!”\nThe villagers parted in unison as Yappy appeared and the bloodshot stares of madness were replaced by respect and admiration.\n-What is this?\n“They are demons!”\nMr. Park shouted, his voice echoed by the residents.\n“They’re the ones who went around asking if His Majesty in the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods had mistreated people!”\n“What a bunch of bullshit. They’re trying to slander us, and we can’t stand it!”\n“What, what…!”\nLouise was exasperated. Isn’t this the kind of thing reporters do?\nOf course, even if this was a poke at their blind spot, it usually ended with them being shut up or kicked out.\nIt doesn’t make sense to hang people like this!\n“Sir Yakt Spinner, are you going to stand by and watch this unjustified atrocity!”\nLouise pinned her hopes on the mechanical spider, who would at least be able to see reason.\nYes, the villagers can, but not you!\n-The trial begins.\n“What?”\n“This is crazy! This is crazy!”\n“We’re with the United Nations! What kind of law are you trying us under?”\n-The Holy Knight.\n“What? What was that?”\n-Holy Knight of the Ten Thousand Gods is above the law.\n“What? What kind of nonsense is that──!”\n“Waaaahhhh…!”\n“Judge the demons!!!”\nThe protest was drowned out by the cheers of angry residents and Yappy immediately began the heresy trial.\n-The defendants will be interpreted live by this judge. Witnesses to the stand.\nMr. Park, a hardware store owner, was the first to take the stand.\nA student of Yappy’s holographic lectures, he first bent 90 degrees to Yappy, the Holy Knight of the Iron and Blacksmith God.\n“I’m Mr. Park, owner of the village hardware store.”\n-Yappy\nOkay, let’s hear what the hell he says. Louise and the U.N. staff turned to listen to Mr. Park, who burst into a rant.\n“Those guys are possessed by the demons!”\n“What?”\n“No, out of the blue, what do you mean, the demons!”\nMr. Park glared ferociously at the protests of the UN staff.\n“That haggard, blue-eyed bastard who came out of nowhere said His Majesty abused innocent people!”\n“Ah, no, not so directly…!”\n“What kind of a man is His Majesty, isn’t he the one who saved our village from total destruction, the one who connected the gods to us!”\nTo accuse a man like that of human rights abuses, how is that possible!\n“”That’s right!””\nThere was no logic in Mr. Park’s words but it was enough for the fanatical villagers.\n-Next witness.\n“I am Choi Mingyong, a lowly servant in the service of Demera, the Goddess of Life and Abundance.”\nMr. Choi, the one behind the riot, glared at the hanging UN inspectors and continued.\n“They are demons.”\n-What?\n“They’re demons, that’s what my senses say.”\n“Crazy!”\n“Come on! R-u-crazy?!”\n“How dare you insult the priest of Demera?”\n“Kill him! Take out the demon and burn him!”\nThe inspectors were beaten down again and again as they tried to plead their case.\n“There is another reason why I suspected them.”\n-What is it?\n“Their eyes were the same as the eyes of the serfs. The evil, filthy, dirty eyes of the demons. But…….”\nChoi pointed to Dennis, his voice quiet, but full of conviction.\n“That one has the demon eyes, too!”\n“What are you talking about, you old fool, I don’t have eyes like that!”\n“Shut up, demon!”\nDennis shouted in frustration. No, he’d gotten it right, but demon eyes?\nWhat a bunch of bullshit logic!\n“My sixth sense is telling me. Those guys must be demons!”\nAfter Mr. Choi testimony, the residents cheered with pickaxes and shovels in hand, and more testimonies followed.\n“My cows haven’t eaten since those demon bitches came!”\n“It must be the demon’s fault that the cows don’t eat!”\n“No, why is it our fault that your cow doesn’t eat──!”\n“”Shut up, demon!!””\n“Look at the way my dog is barking at those demons, isn’t that proof that they are demons!”\n“Isn’t a dog a spirit animal, and can recognize demons!”\n“What does a dog’s barking have to do with anything──”\n“”Shut up, you demon!””\n-Defendants. Any objections?\nWhen Yappy gave her the opportunity, Louise exclaimed impatiently.\n“It’s not fair! We’re not demons!”\nAs a United Nations official who cares about human rights, Louise justified what she had been doing all her life.\nThe need for those human rights to be respected, even for criminals, and the world that excessive punishment would create.\nHer proofs were logical and methodical, and everyone was convinced.\n-Acknowledged. Not logically unreasonable.\nYappy recognized their logic. The monstrosity of mechanical logic does not negate reasonable logic.\nBut\n“Those bastards are demons. I saw them.”\n“Admit it!”\n“I’ll bet my wrist they’re demons!”\nDisordered collective intelligence. That outrageous assertion──\n-Acknowledged. The need to be sure.\nYappy saw it as reasonable and reserved judgment so he didn’t dismiss the outrageous trial!\n“What the hell are you thinking, you’re going to torture us, something the world would never approve of──”\n-Try burning them.\n“……?”\n“Waaaaaaaaaah!!!”\n“Lord Yappy gave his verdict!”\nThe complexion of Louis and the UN staff changed at the sudden burning at the stake.\n-When burned, it’ll be revealed if one is demon or human.\n“Iron bastard!”",

      "content": "Chapter 148: The Inquisition\n-When burned, it’ll be revealed if one is demon or human.\nWhat the hell is this?\nThe UN staff, including Louise, were horrified.\nBurning at the stake! You’re going to burn us!\n“You’re a piece of junk!”\nBut the mechanical spider didn’t even look at them, just barked orders.\n-Fetch the fire.\n“Yes!”\nThe villagers rushed to the village and brought back torches. The madness of the roaring flames illuminates everyone.\n“Now, wait, wait, wait!”\nOne of the employees shouts in desperation. In response, Yappy stops with his torch.\n-The counterargument?\n“Of course there is! What kind of law is this, burning people because they look like they’re possessed by demons!”\nExactly!\nIt was the irony of the UN inspectors that so few shared this obvious voice of reason.\n-That’s the law.\n“There’s a fucking law?!”\n-The Holy Knights, under the authority of the Tatar, God of the Sun and Judgment, had established the proper “demon hunting laws.”\n“Oh, demon hunting laws?”\nThis was the knowledge Yappy had acquired after entering the Lionheart Gate and stored countless Lionheart books.\n-Suspected Demon Followers caught with more than three people will be burned first, regardless of the reason.\nWhat the hell!\nIsn’t that the way of the fanatics, straight out of the barbaric Middle Ages!\nIt’s no coincidence that all the other cruel punishments of the witch hunt era were conjured up in similar fashion.\n-This is the correct procedure for testing suspected demon followers. This has been proven by data.\nIt’s been done, so of course it’s right!\nThis is what happens when ruthless, inflexible killing machines rule the law! Isn’t the coming law of AI judges actually the wrong choice for humanity?\n“What about the believers!”\n-Hmm?\nYappy camera eye turned toward them at the sound of someone’s voice.\nHer name was Dana, and she was the youngest and most recent member of the Inspectorate staff.\n“I, uh, I’m a worshiper of Arianna, Goddess of Light and Justice!”\n“You’re bullshitting!”\n“Shut up, demon!”\n“You’re backed into a corner, you liar!”\n“Gee, it’s real!”\n-Silence.\nYappy quickly searched his downloaded Lionheart Kingdom Code of Laws to find a case he could apply.\n-A believer must be tried according to due process.\n“It’s blasphemy!”\n-Quietly. It’s not for you to decide.\nAt that, the UN staffers all came up with the same stunt.\n“Well, I’m a believer, too, as of yesterday!”\n“Me too!”\n“I’ll believe it from now on!”\nThe townspeople abhorred their false faith with every fiber of their being, but the mechanical Holy Knight was careful to point out that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff.\n-I will conduct the trial according to the law. I will be objective and impartial in accordance with established precedent.\nOooh!\nFinally, some sense! He could see hope in the faces of the UN staff.\n-Light it up.\n“What the hell are you asking for?”\n-What else are you complaining about?\n“No, no, no, the conclusion hasn’t changed! It’s the same thing with the light!”\n-Different.\nWhat’s different!\nAt Louise’s gaze, Yappy crossed it with his cold camera eyes and said again.\n-Lack of faith will burn, faithfulness will not. The data proves it.\nAh.\nLouise realized that these crazed fanatics… had no intention of sparing them.\n-Light it.\n“Yes!”\n“Heed the words of the Holy Knight!”\n“Burn the demons to purify them!”\nThe villagers were the first to approach Dennis with the torches they had received from Yappy. He screamed and struggled, but it was a futile struggle.\n“You’re crazy, you’re crazy!”\nWhether Louise liked it or not, the villagers’ torches ignited the firewood.\nFlames roared with a crackle and Dennis screamed.\n“Kaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh…!”\nIn an instant, Dennis was on fire, his throat screaming.\nThe scream echoing through the agony of being burned alive was eerily familiar, a scream drawn from the depths of the abyss.\nDennis was burned to a crisp, a testament to the power of fire and the villagers cheered.\n“Waaaaaah!”\n“The demon is dead!”\n“Long live the Yakt Spinner! Long live the Lionheart! Long live the TTG Temple!”\nYappy, who was cheered as his name was called, chuckled and saved. He was a fair and just judge, and continued with the next trial.\n-Light the next one.\n“”Yes!””\nAnd with that, one by one, the United Nations employees burned to death. Amidst horrific, agonizing screams, not even their ashes remained.\nThen it was Louise’s turn.\n-Five men left. Advised to hurry.\nThe end. It’s really over now. As the ground beneath her feet caught fire, she cursed in despair.\n“The United Nations won’t let you off the hook! They won’t let you off the hook!”\nLeon must be a madman to lead such a barbaric and unscrupulous group of fanatics! The sooner the world realizes who this insane racist is, the better!\n“What’s the difference between you and the demon, what’s the difference, you’re all going to die, eh?”\nThe torch lit firewood roared at Louise’s feet and its firepower was enough to melt a man’s flesh and turn him into ashes but…….\n“Why isn’t it burning?”\nThe black smoke was thick and her whole body was on fire, but she felt hot rather than burned. It was like when she first came to Korea and went to a jjimjilbang as a cultural experience course.\nIf the jjimjilbang had made her feel hot and steamy, this fire was wrapping her in a warm, soothing embrace.\n-Louise Acquitted. Next defendant begins.\nLouise watched in horror as one UN employee after another was consumed by the flames. Indeed, some of them were in flames, but the fire had not harmed them!\n“What the hell…….”\n-Four of the eight defendants dead. As expected.\n“As…expected?”\nYakt Spinner brought up a holographic image. It was of Louise at the dinner table on her first day at the TTG Temple.\n“When was that…….?”\n-Dennis and the three, who had not consumed the meal.\n“That, that…….”\nAs it turns out, from the first day she arrived at the TTG Temple, Louise had been enjoying a luxurious healthy life, eating plenty of blessed crops.\nAmong them, there were some people who didn’t like the taste of the food and either ordered something else or left.\nThey were the four employees, including Dennis, who are now burned to death.\n-Crops imbued with holy power. Deadly to the malignant. They, unable to withstand the flames of Petos.\n“God of War and Flame…….”\nAt those words, Louise realized that the flame that had consumed them was no ordinary flame.\nThe flames of the God of War would not burn innocent people.\n“That, then, doesn’t mean they’re…….”\n-Demon followers, the lesser beings who serve the demons just like the serfs.\n“The United Nations was infiltrated by demons?”\nShe couldn’t believe it but with the miracle in front of me, she no longer doubted it.\nOf course, it was possible that the TTG Temple had done some magical trick to put on a show that they weren’t the only ones burning… but there was nothing to be gained from that.\n“So… you’re letting us go?”\n-You’re innocent.\nYappy had the villagers release them and that was the end of it.\n* * * *\n“You had a rough night.”\n“Oh, no.”\nThe next morning, Louise spoke cautiously in front of Leon.\n“So, you say there were demons among the inspectors.”\n“I don’t……believe it, they were followers of the demons.”\nThey were her longtime colleagues in the cause of human rights, and their vile screams sounded eerily like ‘them’.\n“Your Majesty, they are in the Queen’s workshop….”\n“They were captured at the last Demon Gate by Queen Beatrice as an experiment.”\nAfter the night’s commotion, Louise was led by Yappy to tour Beatrice’s workshop.\nHe showed her how he burned demons with divine flames and the screams of the souls were strikingly the same.\n“…….”\nLouise was not such an unrestrained idealist as to demand human rights for demons.\n“But, Your Majesty, I must report on these demons when I return.”\n“I can see their response. There will be those who say that even demons should be saved, in the name of human rights.”\n“……It’s a precious commodity in my world.”\n“No, keep an eye on those who say such things, Officer Louise. Humans abhor evil in any world. Those who are tolerant of evil are usually evil people.”\nLeon handed her a necklace drenched in water from an auspicious looking goblet.\n“I, as a United Nations official, do not accept bribes…….”\n“Heaven forbid that you should refuse the king’s gift. Take it, and keep it, for it will serve you well for some time to come.”\nLeon gave her not only that, but also many blessed crops, and said to her,\n“I know you are a wise woman and know how to use them.”\n“……!!”\nLouise was dumbfounded as she realized Leon’s intentions.\n“Lord Spinner.”\n-Hmm?\n“My guest is returning home. Would you be willing to escort her?”\n-No problem.\nBack at the UN headquarters Louise clutched her necklace with trembling hands.\n* * * *\nFour people had died during the UN Human Rights Commission’s visit to TTG Temple.\nThe news had outraged not only the South Korean government but also the UN headquarters.\n“These barbarians…!”\nFrom the UN Secretary-General to the heads of agencies, to the commander of the UN peacekeeping force.\nEach of them, in their own state of emergency, denounced the atrocities of the TTG.\n“The ones who died were all demon followers.”\n“That doesn’t even make sense! Officer Louise, don’t spread such baseless rumors!”\n“We need to rescue the serfs in the TTG Temple right now!”\nAfter being summoned to the top, Louise was reprimanded and made to testify in detail about what had happened.\nAfter a long day of meetings and hearings, it was time to eat.\n“Everyone, eat.”\nSimple sandwiches were prepared for the long hearing.\nWhen they were distributed to the staff, Louise watched as several employees broke out in a cold sweat and refused to eat.\n“I have my own packed lunch…….”\n“I don’t have an appetite, so I’ll eat later.”\nThe refusal gave Louise a sense of déjà vu; that sandwich was made with the “crops” she had brought with her.\n“I… I’m, uh, Officer Harrison.”\n“Why… Why would you do that, Officer Louise?”\nLouise was in agony but then she remembered Leon’s words. If it was true that the United Nations had been overrun by demons, then…….\n“Rain, let there be light!”\nIt was then that Louise’s necklace suddenly emitted a flash of light that enveloped the entire hearing room.\n“A flashbang?!”\n“Officer Louise, what did you do──!”\nThe staff covered their eyes, frightened by Louise’s sudden behavior but at that moment, an unbelievable sight appeared before their eyes.\n“Aaah!”\n“Keeeeeeeeeeee!”\nThe employees who refused the sandwiches, including Mr. Harrison, screamed in agony as their entire bodies burned.\n“Officer Harrison?”\nThe transformation was swift.\nWith the blessing of Arianna, the Goddess of Light and Justice, and the light from the necklace immersed in holy water, the hidden evil was revealed.\n-Chirp!\n-Sizzle!\nThe creature’s flesh peeled away and bloody wings unfurled.\nThe vicious teeth, nails, and piercing eyes were not human.\n“Ah, a demon?!”\n“Kick!”\nThe demon swung its sharp nails at the first person to react but the demon failed to reach him.\n-Whick!\nA steel wire swung with the sound of a whip cut through the demon’s body in an instant.\nDemon blood splattered everywhere, and their gazes turned to one place in unison.\n-Bam!\nA minimalist steel knight emerged from Louise’s bag. The Yakt Spinner’s mechanical arm stretched out, steel wires whipping like a whip.\n“You bastard!”\n“Kill him…!”\nIt took less than two seconds for the demonic beasts in the hearing room to be slaughtered.\nThe souls of the dead demons screamed as they were extinguished by the holy power wire.\nDemons appeared out of nowhere in the hearing room, and the Knight of Steel slaughtered them. As everyone stood dumbfounded, the Yakt Spinner declared in an inorganic, mechanical voice.\n-Operation Demon Slayer has begun.\nWhat began with the Human Rights Violations Inspectorate at the TTG Temple has turned into a full-scale extermination of the demons at the United Nations Headquarters.\nThe UN Headquarters Demon Outbreak was quickly subdued by Holy Knight Yakt Spinner as 337 demons and their followers were slain.\n-The world is coming to an end.",

      "content": "Chapter 149: Kill the Demons\nThe murder of the UN inspectors at the TTG Temple was quickly buried by the demon extermination at the UN.\n[UN Headquarters. Multiple Demons Found. International Community Shocked.]\n[Demon spy sabotage. Is it okay as it is?]\nDemonic infiltration of human society is a rare occurrence.\nDetectives with a keen eye, talented hunters, and survivors with keen demonic senses.\nOver the past thirty years, demons have made their way into human society only to be repelled but this time, it’s different.\nA demon and over three hundred of its followers have infiltrated the United Nations headquarters, the world’s government, in a key location.\nDemon followers have often been found performing backroom rituals, but never on such a large scale and deep within human society.\n-The commander of the UN peacekeeping force is a demonic follower.\n-Crazy… Is this okay?\n-I don’t trust any of them.\nSouth Korea was horrified that half of the UN inspectors were demon followers and had come to sabotage the TTG Temple, and countries around the world began to criticize the United Nations.\nAnd most of all──\n‘Is my country okay?’\n‘Is there a demon follower hiding among the government officials?’\nThese suspicions were naturally directed at the highest levels of society.\n-That bastard is a demon. I think so!\n-You’re sitting on a scenario! I have proof!\nThere are demons lurking in society or rather there is a group of people who follow the demons.\nAt a time when society was in turmoil, with everyone suspecting each other, the official channel of the TTG Temple made a statement on YouTube and other social media.\n[How to recognize the demons.]\n[How to be saved from the demon’s deadly touch.]\n[You Can Do It Too: How to Report a Demon.]\nAs a gesture of goodwill, a timely video was posted.\nOrganized by the governments of South Korea and Japan, which have captured actual demons, the video shows a demon and its followers suffering from a condition known as holy power rejection after eating blessed crops.\n[Demons who ate crops blessed by the goddess Demera. Unable to withstand the holy power]\n[Demons become easier to distinguish as the sanctuary of the TTG Temple grows.]\n[Report number XXX-XXXX. Report anyone you suspect of being a demon to the Ten Thousand Gods Temple!]\nIn the run-up to the fall harvest, the Ten Thousand Gods Temple was shipping out large quantities of blessed crops. Naturally, the sales of blessed crops skyrocketed, the number of followers of the Temple’s faith increased, and most importantly, millions of reports of demonic accusations came in.\nOf course, most of them are indiscriminate reports that are nothing short of witch-hunt logic.\nIt was a massive task that would take months to sort through even if the government responded.\n-Analyzing the data.\nHowever, TTG Temple’s powerful AI, Yakt Spinner, was able to sort through the reports at lightning speed, thoroughly checking the internet access, call volume, and CCTV footage of the suspects.\nIs this a human rights violation? The AI from the cyberpunk future doesn’t know.\nAnalyzing such large amounts of data can get you in trouble.\n-Discovered a suspected demon follower. Admission to a secret club. Hacking into networks through its own connections. Data analyzed.\n[Damn, they’re all over the place, you idiots]\n[They’re trying to get us to eat the blessed crop. What do we do?]\n[We’ll get a fake, somehow we’ll get through this, and we’ll be fine for a while. What do the Great Ones say?]\n-Bam! Check out the demon followers. All members in the club identified. All 27 have been identified as the Nephilim, a group of demonic followers.\nYappy’s logic systems reviewed the options for a group of demonic followers in the middle of Europe.\n-Option A. Assassination. Stealth satellites. Possible deployment of MK.3 stealth killer platforms.\n-Denied. The platform’s progress rate is 88%. Greatly reduced chance of concealment of assets in the event of a high-risk outbreak.\n-Option B. Use media outlets for publicity. Focus on the social status and asset loss of the at-risk individual.\n-Denial. High probability of acquittal based on legal interpretations in uncivilized societies.\n-Assassination from within.\n-Overinvestment of assets.\n-Option C. Sniping with ultra-precise charged particle guns via stealth satellites. Followed by a gas explosion. The poor state of the building’s facilities could be exposed through the organization’s ghost media outlets established in the region.\n-Public opinion control?\n-79%. Rises to 98% if the issue is then covered by Option B.\nThe consensus of the logic systems settled on Option C.\nThe main system of strong artificial intelligence reiterated its strict principles.\n-The TTG Temple’s planetary domination capabilities have not yet reached the target. TTG Temple’s power must be kept secret. Allow reasonable suspicion.\n-Initiating a global evil eliminating program. Kill the Demons\nSecretly, the world’s demons were being targeted one by one.\n* * * *\nThe land of Naju, home to TTG Temple, is developing into a very unique position in Korea.\nOn the one hand, tourists flock to the holy site, and on the other, a military base is being built, with over five thousand Man-At-Arms and two hundred knight cadets in training.\nIn the nearby Yeongsan River, the number of Kikiruks living in the area and commuting to and from the TTG Temple had already exceeded five thousand.\nRelated workers, neighboring merchants, and families also flocked to the area, adding an additional 50,000 people to the population prior to the establishment of the TTG Temple.\nWith the influx of a population equivalent to that of a small city, it was argued that it should be upgraded to a ‘special city of Naju’ as it continued to develop.\nTTG Temple, which has been developing day by day, has recently been relaxing in a spacious atmosphere.\n“Hua~ Mugwort latte is awesome…….”\n“Mango flat cappuccino is the best, admit it.”\nJae-hyuk sips from a straw in an aloha shirt and sunglasses. Next to him, Soo-ho chews on a set of burgers like they’re inseparable.\nThe knight cadets were granted free meals after their knighting ceremony…but now that they’re officially knights, they haven’t had that right for a while.\nAfter the challenge to catch a giant with serfs for the sake of knighthood, they were forced to live in the wilderness at the gates of the Lionheart Kingdom.\nAfter all, it wasn’t uncommon for Leon to be hard on them when they returned from their trek.\n“It’s nice to have a special vacation during the harvest season.”\n“The king has given us plenty of money.”\nWith the national holiday of the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, Leon issued a vacation order for the entire Temple. It’s not unusual for Lionheart to take a break during harvest time.\nApparently, it’s customary for kings and lords to take a break from their duties during this holiday, called the Demera Feast.\n-One! Two!\n-One! Two!\nAt that moment, a group of muscular men with shirtless tops entered from the entrance. It’s a common sight at this military base.\n“Sirs, are you taking a break?”\nKim Do-hyuk greeted them with a salute.\n“Uh, yeah. I thought you were training for the marching drill?”\n“Yes! I was training with Knight Koo Dae-sung.\n“Oh, I’m not an official knight yet.”\nKoo Dae-sung waved his hand in frustration. He was the only one in the first class of knight cadets who hadn’t been appointed a full knight.\n“Oh~ Koo Dae-sung!”\nJae-hyuk recognized Koo Dae-sung from his training and greeted him happily, but he felt awkward.\nAmong the first-period knight cadets who were commissioned as kingdom knights, Ha-ri, So-yeon, Jae-hyuk, and Soo-ho’s positions were special.\nChun So-yeon is the current head of the Knight Order, and Ha-ri is the fourth S-class Hunter in the TTG Temple, aside from Leon, Beatrice, and Yappy.\nJae-hyuk and Soo-ho have also experienced the Lionheart Kingdom Gate and have grown by leaps and bounds with the acquisition of holy relics.\nAmong the knights, the four of them had made remarkable progress, while Koo Dae-sung was still only a weak knight who hadn’t even reached the B rank.\n“Well, then…we’ll take our leave.”\nAs Koo Dae-sung awkwardly bowed and left, Soo-ho gave him a wistful look.\n“He’s a hard worker, but he doesn’t seem to have much talent.”\n“Well, there’s nothing you can do about talent.”\nTTG Temple had founded a knight order and accepted new knight cadets, but Koo Dae-sung was still stagnant.\nAt first, he briefly lifted Sir Georgic’s hammer, raising hopes, but he was only in the upper C class.\n“When will we finally see Sir Georgic’s hammer?”\n“I don’t know. The holy items we inherited haven’t even recognized us as their proper owners yet.”\nSoo-ho took the shield of Amalek, a Relic of Light and Justice, and Jae-hyuk took the spear of Kaif, a Relic of Sky and Thunder.\nDespite Isabelle’s mediation in the succession ceremony, the two Epic items did not fully recognize them.\nTo be more precise, they did not yet have the skills to wield them.\n“Lord Georgic’s hammer is an even greater item.”\nWhoever wields this hammer will gain the power of Georgic.\nThis means that the moment you pick it up, you will be awakened as a Holy Knight. No one knows how good one must be to do so.\n“Will he ever show up?”\n“Ugh…That might be true.”\nAt least the four of them in the Hall of Ten Thousand Gods knew that the Holy Knights were knights of the great gods who had sacrificed themselves in the Last War.\nOnly the magician-queen, the pinnacle of a world and the virtuous machine that had been on a thousand-year quest, were given that honor.\nSurely, on this earth, there could be one with such honor and glory?\nEven if the gods lowered the cutoff, how many people in the human world would be able to achieve such untouchable glory?\nIt was vague so the two men tried to change the subject.\n“So, what’s His Majesty up to, anyway?”\n“He’s been busy with the queen lately.”\n“I don’t see them and Lord Yappy getting any rest.”\n“That’s true.”\nYappy may be a machine, but the two of them are human, so how can they not be stressed?\nThe question was answered by a comment Soo-ho heard from his sister one day.\n“I’ve heard that their Majesties are also very good at relieving stress.”\n“Do you know anything about it?”\n“My sister said that they… they’re very, very good at de-stressing.”\n“…….”\nAt this point, Jae-hyuk realized what Soo-ho meant.\nIn this touristy town, this military base where thousands of people train, just as there is darkness where there is light, there is also darkness where only three people are allowed.\n“Ugh… Maybe the serfs should just die already.”\n“Serfs are fine… they die, but not them.”\n“Ughhh…….”\nJae-hyuk shudders. He sipped his drink in disbelief.\n“I don’t know about that~”\n“What? I don’t even know what you’re talking about.”\nIn the world, sometimes, it’s better to pretend not to know.\n* * * *\nIn the basement of the TTG Temple, there is an air defense facility according to the building code…the so-called underground floor.\nThe building law requires that a building with a floor area of 200 square meters above ground level must have a basement floor for underground air defense protection, and usually new facilities are built and utilized in this basement.\nHowever, the basement of the main building of the TTG Temple is not used for any purpose. It is reported to be used as an underground air defense shelter as required by the building code.\nOf course, the TTG Temple is using this underground facility as a magician’s “workshop”.\n-Kyahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\nThe screams of the demons are muffled by soundproofing.\nThe most senior inmate here, Hildir, the Beast God Shaman, sighs as she watches another demon die.\n-Aah! Aah!\nAt that moment, all the inmates stiffened. Someone had come down from the basement!\n“Hmph…!”\nHildir immediately dropped to her knees and assumed a posture of submission. There are only three ‘humans’ allowed to enter this place.\nIt’s a relief that it’s not the machine, but if they mess up, everyone in this room will die.\n“Your Majesty, you have come.”\nThe beautiful Magician Queen opens the door from the deepest workshop.\nThe Magician Queen, who had deliberately created a dingy place and struck fear into the hearts of the prisoners, smiled brightly and greeted the Lionheart King.\n“It’s a dingy place that’s not suitable for a noble like you.”\n“My workshop is well ventilated.”\n“You shouldn’t have to walk through this place.”\n“I don’t want to make things easier for the bad guys.”\n“What a tear-jerking sacrifice…….”\nWhat are these crazy assholes talking about?\nThey’re not the ones living in the harsh conditions, so why are they talking like they’re sacrificing?\nIn the first place, Beatrice’s workshop is connected to the first floor by an elevator. That means you don’t have to step on the dingy, dirty cell floor unless you’re coming this way, like Leon.\nIt’s always been that way, but these Lionheart cultists don’t treat anyone but themselves as human.\nCountless tribes of beast gods followers have been dragged into the Lionheart realm to die as serfs.\nIn the days of Holy Knight Gratas’ annual serf festivals, the seeds of entire tribes dried up.\n“By the way, Beatrice, why did you summon this king?”\n“Hoo-hoo, I have news the king will be pleased with.”\nBeatrice smiled bewitchingly, twisting the corners of her mouth, and soon the ‘name’ in her voice made several demons shudder.\n“I have found a way to search for the Holy Knight, Sir Vulcanus.”",

      "content": "Chapter 150: Searching for Vulcanus\n“You’ve found a way to search for Lord Vulcanus?”\nLeon’s face lit up at Beatrice’s words since he hadn’t expected her to find a way so soon.\n“Yes. It’s about finding the coordinates of the ‘specific person’ you were talking about earlier, but I’ve come to my own conclusions after some experimentation with the ‘plucked information’.”\n“Really?”\n“It’s taken two things to open the gate so far.”\n“An object for the ‘coordinates’ and magic stones for the ‘material’.”\nThe first was the gate with Jerea in it.\nMore specifically, Leon’s holy sword was used as a coordinate to point to the gate with the holy object.\nThe second was the estate of Demon Archduke Akasha and to get there, Leon used Akasha’s severed arm.\nFinally, Gunnar’s Seedling.\nThis is the time period of Gunnar’s activities and they persevered through the dying days of the Lionheart Kingdom.\nSo why doesn’t Vulcanus’ Ritual Dagger open the gate?\n“Is ‘dagger’ insufficient as a coordinate?”\nThe dagger Leon received at the gate where he met Vulcanus, even though he had been using it since his days as an acolyte, was not comparable to a holy object or the flesh of a Demon Archduke.\nLeon wondered if it was because of its lack of prestige, but Beatrice shook her head.\n“To use Lord Yappy’s analogy, an object is just a code that specifies approximate coordinates, and given its randomness, any object can be the coordinates to open a gate.”\nBeatrice deftly maneuvered her smartphone and showed Leon a video, a recording of her own experiment.\nIt showed her opening the gate over and over again.\n“Surprisingly, it doesn’t take a lot of spirit stones. Instead, only the lowest-ranked gates opened.”\n“I thought you said the gates themselves weren’t demonic, just a phenomenon. I guess they don’t care about the quality of the material.”\nLeon asked, looking curiously at Beatrice, who had mastered a smartphone that he had yet to master.\n“But if that’s the case, then why doesn’t it open the coordinates where Lord Vulcanus is? It doesn’t seem like it’s simply a matter of lacking the magic stones.”\n“Your Majesty, do you remember how Lord Vulcanus ‘went missing’?”\nBeatrice had heard the rumors at the last Lionheart Kingdom gate, for she and her knights had entered the gate shortly after Vulcanus’ disappearance.\nAnd Leon vaguely remembered it, too, from two hundred years ago.\n“It was on the plains of Randolce that Sir Vulcanus battled the Demon Archduke of Sloth and Idleness…the demon and his legions known collectively as the Glacial Archduke.”\nAt the time, Leon had scrambled to defeat the Demon Archduke of Wisdom and his 200,000 legions. And before him, Vulcanus’ army had traveled to the Plains of Randolce against 170,000 demonic legions.\n“Thirty thousand Kingdom troops and the Burning Sword Knights defeated them, but…Lord Vulcanus and the Burning Sword Knights went missing.”\n“That’s odd, if they both fell in the fight, or if either of them fell, there would have been bodies left behind.”\nBeatrice noted that immediately.\n“Your Majesty, you were slaughtering demons until you met Miss Ha-ri, weren’t you?”\n“Indeed. I missed a few, but in the end, I killed them all.”\n“The Glacier Archduke. You’ve never met him, have you?”\n“No.”\nAs if she had guessed, Beatrice moved on to the next question for confirmation.\n“Are demons capable of self-destruction? I’ve never seen a demon in any kind of pain take their own life.”\n“Their demonic bodies do not disappear when they die, but self-destruction is another matter. They are magical beings, just as they are magical masters.”\n“You mean every single one of their actions counts as a magical act?”\nLeon nodded. The very act of crossing dimensions is a product of magic in the first place.\nTheir very bodies are made of magic, and everything they do can only be associated with magic.\n“Killing and destruction. Wisdom and exploration. Pleasure and corruption. The magical power they draw from is not just for their enemies, but for themselves.”\nMagical power, not holy power. Demons themselves are a mass of magic, and everything they do is subject to its interference.\nThis meant that even a simple act of self-destruction was considered a magical act of ‘self-destruction’.\n“Despicable cowards, I can’t believe none of them are willing to die.”\n“But that’s good, at least they’re not running away from death, right?”\n“Just like they didn’t get away with it when this king destroyed the last Demon Gate.”\nLeon chuckled, then wondered why Beatrice had been asking these questions.\n“You have a theory, don’t you?”\n“Yes, although I’ll probably only know that once I’m face-to-face with it.”\nBeatrice shared her conclusion.\n“Lord Vulcanus is, I believe, in the Realm of the Demons.”\nIn the realm of the Demon Archduke of Sloth and Idleness.\n* * * *\nDemons have used gates to cross dimensions and invade worlds.\nBut the gates themselves are not created by demons. The demons merely discovered the gate before anyone else and utilized it, and the “systems” and “quests” inside the gate could only be interfered with to a certain extent, not completely controlled.\n“Demons have been using gates for quite some time, as I realized with the Lionheart Kingdom Gate, when we were blocked by the Lord of Wisdom.”\nWhat this means is simple. It meant that the demons were far more advanced in the art of utilizing gates than Beatrice, who had only just begun to utilize them.\n“That means they must have their own security system for the gate, something that prevents other beings from opening a gate into their dimension.”\n“But we succeeded last time in Akasha’s estate.”\n“That’s the blind spot, Your Majesty. Have you ever seen a gate opened by a demon?”\n“Yes……..”\nCome to think of it, Leon had seen very few demons open the gates.\nIn the case of the Archdemons, they prepared for the ritual by using the Orb of Wisdom, as the Empire had done when it first summoned the Archdemon, or by spreading the Faith of Lust, as the Hanbit Palace had done.\nEven Archdukes or Lord-level demons required a large-scale summoning ritual to invade another dimension.\n“However, once you reached the level of an Archduke, you could open a dimension of your own and return to your own realm. The Archduke of Slaughter did so…….”\n“I believe that Archduke Glacier, who fought against Lord Vulcanus, also felt the threat and fled to his realm.”\n“……!”\nThe reason for the disappearance of the Archduke Glacier, Vulcanus, and his knights in the Randolce Plain became clear.\n“The Glacier Archduke fled during the battle, and Sir Vulcanus chased after him?”\n“That is correct.”\nAnd it is likely that the place Vulcanus reached through the gate was the estate of Archduke Glacier.\nThis leads to the conclusion that since it is the Demon Archduke’s realm, Beatrice cannot open the gate using Vulcanus’ dagger as a coordinate because of the Demon Archduke barrier.\n“Is it possible that Lord Vulcanus was captured by them, as was Sir Georgic?”\n“It’s certainly possible that somehow Lord Vulcanus is immobilized, but to know that for sure, we need to find the Glacial Archduke’s estate, and…….”\n“So you’re saying we can enter the Demon Domain with the same arm we used last time, the Archduke of Slaughter’s arm.”\nBeatrice twisted the corner of her mouth and Leon had the same expression.\n* * * *\n“I will be away for a while.”\nThe TTG Temple members, who had been enjoying a generous rest ahead of the autumn harvest, had a questioning look on their face at Leon’s sudden declaration.\n“Your Majesty, where are you going?”\nHa-ri asked.\n“I’m going to explore a gate with Beatrice.”\n“???”\nThe others looked even more dubious. It didn’t make sense that they would be exploring the gate alone.\nLeon is a super powerful man, but he’s not one to underestimate the power of a group.\nHe was a commander before he was a superhuman. He raised a large army called the Man-At-Arms on Earth.\nGiven his ability to buff the soldiers, it made sense to bring an army…or at least the Knights.\n“Shouldn’t you at least bring the Knights?”\nChun So-yeon, the head of the Knights, raised her hand. There were already countless elite forces in the TTG Temple.\nPark Yong-shin of the Hanbit Palace, who had just joined the organization, as well as the Heavenly Sword Guild’s Light Swordsman Chun Jinsoo, the Firebird Guild’s Lee Yong-wan, Ha Yuri, and the Golden Lion Guild’s Golden Iron and Huang Yeon-ha, were all cooperative with Leon.\nLeon has the manpower and resources to mobilize a “legion” in an emergency.\n“This king will head to the Land of Demons.”\n“……!”\nTo their astonishment, Leon elaborates.\n“But it won’t be a conquest like the last time. There is something we must infiltrate their dimension to find. In the meantime, you will rest and watch over the Temple.”\nIt was a covert mission with just Leon and Beatrice so they would be able to retreat from any threat.\nBoth of them have super strength, and Beatrice’s ability to open and close gates makes her indispensable.\nLeon and Beatrice left for the demonic dimension just like that.\n* * * *\nAfter the Cataclysm, Gates began popping up all over the world, but the world was barely stopping them.\nThe lower echelons of the Hunter Guilds work hard to clear the yellow and green gates, while the higher gates, like the red and orange, are handled by larger guilds with S-class hunters.\nThen there’s the black gate, called the Crisis of Humanity, which the neighboring nations work together to close, albeit with some friction.\nHumanity’s power is nowhere near what it was 30 years ago, and most gates can be closed with ease.\n“Yes, 17 gates closed today. The number of gates under attack is 42.”\n“Hmm…There are more gates left than usual.”\nAfter hearing the report from Hunter Association Chief Kim Jin-soo, Oh Kang-hyuk was worried about the number of…uncleared gates.\n“Hmm…On an annual average, it’s not much different from last year.”\n“Ah~”\nOnly then did Oh Kang-hyuk realize his discomfort.\nThe reason why the gates in Korea had been clearing one after another recently was due to the presence of a large guild.\n“Isn’t the TTG Temple still resting due to the harvest season?”\n“Yes, but they’re taking a 33% rotation.”\nTTG Temple was invaluable to the Association because they didn’t care about investment costs and cleared remote, low-grade, and low-value gates without discrimination.\nTheir influence had also spread to the other ten guilds, and now even the Hanbit Palace, Firebird, Golden Lion, and Heavenly Sword guilds had joined him.\n“His presence is indeed large.”\n“Well, it’s a bit of a burden to grow any bigger.”\nKim Jin-soo had seen the potential of the TTG Temple and the man named Leon while he was on assignment at the TTG Temple.\n“As you know, His Majesty Leon is not a man to be limited to one country.”\n“I know. The President seems to feel secure in keeping him out of politics.”\nLeon’s lack of interest in the immediate politics of his country is more about his respect for Korea and its rightful leader.\nAbove all, he sees the world, not the country or the continent.\n“Where do you think TTG Temple’s growth rate will soar next year?”\n“Chernozem in Ukraine, Beidahuang in the Heilongjiang People’s Republic, the cornfields of California in the United States… As the world grain fields, once contaminated by miasma, are cleaned up, Goddess Demera followers grow.”\nAnd that’s not all.\nThe doctrine and how to join the organization is very accessible via the internet.\nWhile it’s a new kid on the block compared to the big religions, its real-life gods and miracles are attracting not only atheists but also members of the established religious community.\n“In fact, there are more than four hundred known users of the Holy Law in South Korea alone. It’s a light-hearted way of honoring the gods they believe in.”\nAs it spreads around the world, the TTG Temple popularity would explode month by month, not year by year.\n“The UN Demon Incident was a big one, as people around the world distrusted their own governments and leadership, creating an atmosphere that pushes the belief in the TTG Temple. I don’t know if I should call this a good thing…….”\n“There are transitional periods for everything.”\nAlready receiving some information through Yappy, Oh Kang-hyuk was worried that demons were poisoning the world at a serious level.\nHe was even more convinced that only Leon and the TTG Temple could solve it.\n“I hope you’ll continue as you are and the world’s security will gradually be resolved as the TTG Temple grows in size.”\nBut Oh knew from experience. The enemy you fear will always try to nip you in the bud when you’re most vulnerable.\n────────!\nAt that moment, the cell phones of the Association’s employees…Kim Jin-soo and Oh Kang-hyuk’s cell phones, too, went off with a tearing alarm.\nThe gate alarm, which is mandatory for Association employees, went off one after another.\n-Beep, beep, beep, beep!\n“Mr. Chairman…! This!”\nKim Jin-soo’s complexion turned white as the alarm that was still going off was very clear.\nAssociation President Oh Kang-hyuk immediately gave an order.\n“Issue an emergency order to the Ten Guild… and the Ten Thousand Gods Temple…connect Lord Yappy directly through Han Ha-ri!”\n“Yes…!”\nOh Kang-hyuk stared at his cell phone screen as a cold sweat ran down his spine.\nOn his cell phone, over a hundred gates from all over the country were being added one after another.",

      "content": "Chapter 151: The Youngest Archdemon\nThe gate opened at the back of the cave.\n“Thank goodness we’re out of their sight.”\n“Last time I was here, I marked the place in case we came back.”\n“I wonder what would have happened if it hadn’t been for you, Beatrice.”\nLeon looked around the ravaged estate of the Slaughter Archduke with relief.\n“It was well worth the destruction.”\nThe last time they were here with the joint Japanese-Korean offensive, they raided the neighboring villages and took their demonic followers prisoner.\nAs a result, no new villages have been built or demons have taken up residence.\n“Hmm?”\nJust then, a group of demons loomed in Leon’s vision. Even with his superhuman vision, they must be at least five to sixty kilometers away.\n“It’s not like there aren’t any demons.”\n“Could they be the ones who came to take over the estate?”\n“Possibly. Beatrice, look at this.”\nLeon pulled out a dagger from his belt.\n“This is the dagger of Lord Vulcanus…….”\nThe ceremonial dagger glowed a faint afterglow.\n“It’s a resonance of stardust and holy power. It is to be expected from a weapon with a long history, and that dagger has a very… special connection to Lord Vulcanus.”\n“Does that mean that Lord Vulcanus is nearby?”\nLeon shook his head at that.\n“A Holy Knight can make his presence felt across continents, and if it’s Sir Vulcanus, it will resonate even if he’s on the other side of the planet.”\nThis was no guarantee that Vulcanus was nearby.\n“But if he is, this dagger could be a signpost.”\n“I see, but it’s not enough to find coordinates within the gate.”\nBeatrice was going to open the gate with the coordinates of Vulcanus’ location in this demonic realm.\nJust as she had done at the previous Lionheart Realm gate to escape the Lord of Wisdom and make a spatial leap with Sir Antoine.\n“It’ll be a while until I find the coordinates, so why don’t you wait here as a base?”\n“Sure. This king will take a look around. I have some things to check out.”\n“But first, Your Majesty, there’s something I need to do.”\n“?”\nThere was a light touch.\nThe feel of fingers touching at a breath’s distance.\nThe magic of the Queen’s white fingers brushed against Leon’s forehead.\n“Veil of illusion, block the light.”\nThe voice, whispering at close range, tickled Leon’s ear.\nVoices have power, especially for a magician, and every act has a special meaning.\nFor Leon, who is not a magician, it’s just tickling time.\n“That’s it.”\nBeatrice smirked at the end of the rather wistful exchange.\n“Your Majesty’s holy power is hidden. It’s a small enough camouflage that it would be unraveled if you took out a holy object or used a holy law.”\n“I see.”\nThe corners of Beatrice’s eyes lifted at Leon’s terse question.\n“Were you disappointed?”\nAt the provocative glint in her eyes, knowing her charms better than anyone, Leon smirks and raises his hands in surrender.\n“A man who is not disappointed by the temptations of one as beautiful as you has no heart.”\n“Your Majesty is well versed in the art of pleasing a lady.”\n“Isn’t that a virtue of courtly life?”\nThe words resonated with Beatrice’s heart. After all, royalty is the center of social circles.\n“I’ve warned you to be careful with what you wish to do. We are in the middle of an enemy territory. We can open the gates and retreat if we have to, but we’ll have their attention.”\n“I understand. I will not use holy items or holy laws.”\nWith that, Leon left the cave and scanned the area.\n‘There’s no other movement around here.’\nEven for a demonic estate, the surrounding area had been ruthlessly destroyed, and the land area was not normal.\nI’m not sure about their situation, but given the nature of their species, they can’t be very numerous.\nAt least the area around this cave is safe. Beatrice had chosen her coordinates very well.\n‘A wise woman.’\nLeon himself had studied and gained knowledge from a young age, as the demon’s nemesis, as the Goddess’s attendant, and as the Chosen Lionheart, but his wisdom was nowhere near that of Yakt Spinner or Beatrice.\nThe position of Lionheart is more like that of a noble knight and the final weapon of the kingdom.\n‘Castile was a wise woman, too. She helped me a lot.’\n────\nThe voice of the goddess whispered to Leon but Leon shook his head.\n“Don’t say that. It’s not time yet.”\n“You always pass off your goddess’s advice like that,” the voice scolded.\nIt sounded more like something else than advice, Leon thought.\n“Whoa…….”\nLeon looked all around the cave, then out into the ruined wilderness beyond.\nDozens of kilometers from this point, inside a ruined village, a group of people are doing something suspicious.\n* * * *\nThe Archduke of Slaughter estate was in ruins, and Akasha died.\nHer disappearance should be expected after being captured by them, but we need to clean up the mess.\nBut no one has stepped forward to restore the ruins of the Archduke’s estate.\n-Me? Why?\n-Do you think I’m crazy to go there? What if they open the gates again?\n-Ah, I’m busy with work…….\nThe demons were shocked that they had been invaded for the first time in their history, and even more shocked that the invader was Leon Dragonia Lionheart, the Lionheart King.\n-Crazy. What the hell is that asshole Lionheart doing here?\n-What, he captured and killed the Archduke?\n-When is he coming again?\n-Ahhhhh! We’re all dead!\nThese were the demons that invaded the Lionheart Kingdom.\nHaving barely escaped with their lives before the final Demon Gate was destroyed they were traumatized by Lionheart and the Holy Knights.\nAnd it’s not just the demons who invaded his world that have trauma.\n-Even the Magician Queen? Beatrice, the witch bitch?\n-Ah, it hurts… the hair, the body, the skin…! The teeth!\nBeatrice Alighieri Spero.\nA demon of depravity, possessed by the demons of pleasure and depravity. A creature of nature, born with an appetite for vice.\nIt has been two hundred years since the Demon Archduke Quay and the Archdemon Androzin corrupted the Magician Queen and wanted to awaken her as the next Corruption Lord.\nEven before that, the Magician Queen was famous.\nShe was the one who came up with the idea of traumatizing the immortal demons to keep them from returning.\nAll demons feared the Magician Queen, as she tortured them to death with the sole purpose of causing them pain.\nOne was a destroyer of souls, the other a witch who sowed pain in the soul.\nFor demons who have faced many powerful opponents, these two are uniquely terrifying.\nAnyway, back to the point.\n‘No one’s taking this!’\nNo Archdemon has been entrusted with the task of repairing the ruined estate of the Slaughter Archduke Akasha.\nThe Archdemon of Wisdom and Exploration gritted his teeth as he watched the other Archdemons around him wring their hands at the meeting.\nOrdinarily, they would have been eager to claim the Archduchy, where countless treasures would have remained even if it had been plundered but they were afraid of the return of the Lionheart King and the Magician Queen.\nIsn’t that ridiculous?\nLogically, no.\nThe Earth Alliance raiding party opened the gate and entered the Slaughter Archduke’s territory.\nThat means these coordinates have been compromised.\nAnyone who lingers near these coordinates will be the first to be targeted.\nNaturally, the demons didn’t dare to enter the Archduke’s territory, and even the demons in the surrounding territories chose to evacuate.\nThe Slaughtering Archduke’s estate and its surroundings, once the most expensive in the Demon Realm, had been destroyed by a series of real estate crashes.\nIn such an atmosphere, someone must take over the Archduke’s estate. At the very least, they needed a facility to send out a signal if they were to invade in earnest later.\n[Hey youngest]\n“Awww──\nThe senior Archdemon looked at himself during the magical communication. The jet-black wings fluttering from his shadow were the majesty of a Wisdom Archdemon.\nHowever, despite his majesty, the ‘youngest’ Wisdom Archdemon was sweating profusely.\n[Doing well?]\n‘──Damn!’\nWherever he goes, he is always in charge of the chores.\n“Hurry up and move!”\nGob, the Wisdom Archdemon, urged the demon followers as he swung his whip at them.\n“We must complete the restoration of this area by the end of the day!”\nThe Slaughter Archduke’s estate was large and wealthy, but it was ravaged as if a swarm of locusts had passed through.\n“Ugh, the pollution level is 85%, I can’t stand it!”\n“What a bunch of bastards…! They unleashed their holy power on the ground!”\nFor demons, holy power is the ultimate poison. The traces of holy power that Leon and the Knights had sown were still contaminating the demonic realm.\n“Grass! Grass is growing!”\n“Unbearable! What a horrible…!”\nDemon followers are horrified as if they were looking at a deformed plant contaminated with radioactivity.\nTo them, the green vegetation is no different than humans facing radioactive contamination.\n“Gather all the soil tainted with holy power in one place!”\n“Lord, master… what are you going to do with all this horrible dirt…….”\n“It’s all for nothing!”\nGob used his mystical powers to draw holy power from the dirt, and the condensed holy power rushed to his staff.\n“Master, what is that staff?”\n“Hot, hot, hot! This is the holy power I’ve been collecting for 250 years.”\n“Master, why would you do such a thing?”\nStupid things. They don’t even realize how useful holy power is.\nThat’s why he’s a major demon and they’re demon followers.\nGob set the slaves to work and headed for his office.\nBut why? I feel strangely nervous.\nAnd it’s not just because he’s in a purified land that’s radioactive to demons.\nStrangely, his survival instincts were warning him.\n‘Something’s wrong, something is wrong!’\nIt was an illogical thought for the Archdemon of wisdom and inquiry, but he had survived the Lionheart King.\nGob spent some time in his makeshift office, going over the data from the destroyed village.\n‘Oh, I forgot to check on the situation on Earth.’\nThe Wisdom Jewel is a demonic staging ground for dimensional invasions to summon Archdemons. However, Gob’s predecessor in charge of the Wisdom Jewel had abandoned his duties and fled.\nThankfully, Gob, who has a lot of time on his hands, has taken over the job…….\n‘That Reynald guy. No matter what I ask him to do, it always goes wrong!’\nGob was so nervous that he didn’t even let Reynald near Korea. If the Wisdom Jewel were to be cut by the Lionheart King’s sword, it would kill his spirit.\nHe hasn’t been in touch lately due to the hustle and bustle of his work, but as soon as he returns, he will check the Lionheart’s location in real time.\nWhen the night came──\n-Ugh!\nA groan came from somewhere and Gob woke up, not knowing what it was.\n“Hmm?”\nHe stepped out into the hallway, but there was no sign of life. Only the faint moonlight illuminates the corridors of the ruined building.\nThere, Gob searched for the slaves with a sense of wonder.\n“Strange. Strange…….’\n-Siik\nGob realized that something was amiss, it was a movement so quiet that a lesser demon would have gone unnoticed.\nBut as a goblin with survival instincts at their peak, he felt a momentary sense of discomfort.\n‘Danger….’\nGob sensed that his survival alert had reached its peak. It was illogical, but it had always kept him alive.\n‘There’s something behind me!’\nA pair of eyes was staring at him.",

      "content": "Chapter 152: Gob, the Archdemon of Wisdom\nGob felt someone’s hand on his back.\n‘What about the barrier…!’\nTo break through his barrier, one would have to be at least as powerful as him to be able to infiltrate──\n‘No, no, no, trust my instincts!’\nGob walked down the hallway, slowly and unnaturally.\nThe lightless corridor seemed long, like a distorted boundary and a chill ran down his spine as he took each step.\n‘There he is, an assassin of considerable skill!’\nThe world of demons may appear to be unified, but in reality, it’s an abysmal struggle to topple each other.\nHell itself is full of fighters, depending on lineage, race, and seniority.\nGob, one of the last of the Archdemons of Wisdom, and a goblin by birth, was so powerful that even the high demons, let alone the Archdemons, would say, ‘That’s enough to make him a force to be reckoned with.’\n‘You’re here to assassinate me!’\nIt’s not unnatural for Gob to jump to this conclusion. After all, Gob has been challenged time and time again.\nSo who is this, a senior Archdemon trying to steal his research?\nA murderous Archdemon who’d seen a goblin rise to the rank of Archdemon?\nA Senior Archdemon of Wisdom trying to take his place once and for all!\n“Kikikikit…!”\nBut it didn’t matter. Gob had summarized the situation in a flash and smiled a despicable smile.\n“You’re not the first assassin to come to kill me. And you won’t be the last.”\nGob, the Archdemon of Wisdom, extended his staff toward the assassin behind him.\n“Power! Devour my enemy!”\nInstantly, the staff burst into a fierce light. It was a holy power ray that melted demons at the mere touch!\nGo, Holy Cannon!\nGob, who had killed countless rivals with this power, expected the assassin behind him to melt away.\n“???”\n“????”\nBut contrary to his expectations, the assassin was still intact. He cocked his head and stared at Gob.\n“You…….”\n-Boom!\nIt was the Knight of the Gods, who ignored immortality, extinguishing all demons, whether lesser or greater… even lords.\n“You lowly green beast, did you think you’d live if you ran, I swear to you, I’ll tear your snout out!”\nGob recalled the terrible memory of the past.\n‘I will die!’\nThe moment Gob realized he was going to die──\n“Using holy power…you weren’t a goblin, were you?”\n“Huh?”\nGob noticed Leon’s puzzled demeanor and quickly turned around.\nConvinced it was a demonic assassin, he fired his holy cannon but to Leon, he would have been considered a holy power user in the middle of the Demon Realm.\nThen…!\n“Are you the Savior?”\n“……How is this king your savior?”\nOkay, he doesn’t start with a sword. There’s hope!\n“Well, my tribe has a legend that says a knight of the goddess will come to save us from our suffering!”\n“……tell me about it.”\nThe white goblin in front of Leon spouted a legend made up out of desperation.\nA tribe of goblins had been captured by demons and forced into slavery as servants of the orcs, and one day a savior would come to free them.\nThe story was plausible, though I was puzzled that goblins would worship a god.\nLeon asked.\n“So, what’s the name of your god?”\n“Ma, Lickety-Split!”\n“…… That’s a strange name.”\n“Well, my tribe’s language is like this!”\nGob did his best to convince himself that he was a cleric from another dimension. His deliberately twisted name was one example but Leon wasn’t having any of it.\n“Recite the code of your god.”\nNow, a little bit about Gob.\nHe was an unusually wise and inquisitive mutant in a race of goblins whose entire species was regarded as foolish and cunning.\nA genius in the entire history of his race. No, a one-of-a-kind mutant.\nAdd to that the wisdom and acumen he’d gained in the two hundred-plus years since his awakening as a demon, and you’ve got the makings of a man who could survive in this flesh-and-blood demon world.\nIn the heat of the moment, he was able to conjure up an incantation that didn’t exist. If you overheat your brain, you can do anything!\n“Hmph. I never thought there was another faith in this filthy land.”\nLeon inferred that this goblin-like creature might be a believer from another dimension.\nThe goblin’s unexpectedly unprejudiced nature led him to this conclusion.\nOtherwise, how could something that looked like a lowly beast use holy power?\n“But why are you here, Gobla?”\nLeon called him by the pseudonym he had given him.\n“I prayed to the Lickety-Split, and he told me that this is where you would find me, so I risked my life and came here!”\n“Hooo…….”\nLeon found himself more and more enthralled by the goblin-like priest’s words.\n“You may be of a different faith, but I never thought I’d find such a clear and correct believer in this savage land!\nEven on Earth, he didn’t deny Yahweh, Buddha, or Allah, but he was tolerant of otherworldly beliefs.\n“This place is dangerous. Go with this king.”\n“I’m fine──”\n“Haha, don’t be a stranger. There are many things I want to know about your tribe.”\nLeon grinned, and Gob realized he couldn’t refuse in the setting he’d created.\n‘I survived for now!’\nI want to go home.\n* * * *\nOn the way back to the cave, Leon said.\n“You remind me of an old acquaintance, by the way.”\n“What do you mean…….”\n“In the old days, there was a goblin who tried to rip this king’s head off.”\n-Ouch!\n“That lowly green beast had a foul tongue and a sly temper but he paled in comparison to you.”\n“Oh, no!”\nWhoa, Gob breathed a sigh of relief. The last time he’d met Leon was 230 years ago, around the time of his awakening as an Archdemon.\nDuring the subsequent invasion of Lionheart, Gob had unconditionally applied for an assignment far from Lionheart, and as soon as he heard the news of the Wisdom Lord’s death, he fled to the Demon Gate.\n‘I had my mouth torn out by this bastard back then, and I still can’t make a single sound with my tongue!’\nFortunately, the difference between Gob then and now is in his appearance.\nHis skin has turned white from demonization, and as an accomplished mage, Gob has created artifacts to hide his magic.\nIt’s a specialty he created to give to Reynald Sherman, and it’s the one thing he carries with him that saved his life.\n“You’re here, hmm, Your Majesty?”\nBeatrice’s gaze snapped to the white goblin Leon had brought with him.\n“He says he’s a priest of Lickety-Split.”\n“Lickety-Split?”\nBeatrice tilted her head at the white goblin that Leon had so graciously brought along.\n“I am Gobla! At your service!”\nGob stood at attention, watching the two with all his might.\nEvery so often, Leon or Beatrice would ask Gob about his faith and his tribe, and he would respond with a sincere ad-lib.\n“Your god, by the way, does not appear in person, does he?”\n“Yes, the Old One prefers to mature his believers through trials rather than directly help!”\n“Well, then, there are certainly many gods of that sort, and the congestion of your holy power speaks for itself.”\nThe decisive reason Leon and Beatrice did not suspect Gob was because of the power contained in Gob’s staff.\nAfter years of research, the wand had absorbed all sorts of holy powers into a jumble that Leon couldn’t identify.\nIn the process, his body became accustomed to it, and he was able to avoid suspicion.\n‘I thought I was going to die every time I researched holy power, but I’m so glad I did!’\nWho would have thought that researching to fend off competitors would lead to something like this?\nAll hail the great and wise Archdemon Gob!\n“Here’s a meal for the two of you!”\n“I have prepared a bed for you, make yourself comfortable!”\nGob offered himself as a servant to the two in order to curry favor without raising suspicion.\nHe had once hoped to be king of the goblins, and had studied the arts of the Lionheart Kingdom.\n“The more I look at him, the more I marvel. A being from another dimension is such a fine practitioner.”\n“Is it because this king is a representative of the Ten Thousand Gods that makes you so comfortable?”\n“No! Hehe….”\nI, the greatest genius of the goblin race, the Archdemon of wisdom and exploration, encompassing infinite knowledge, am praised as a servant by you!\nGob wanted to bite his tongue right then and there, but the desire to survive forced superhuman patience on him.\nThree days passed.\nPacing near the cave, Gob spotted a cavalcade of two-wheelers kicking up a cloud of dust like something out of a turn-of-the-century movie.\n“Finally…!”\nThey were the Goblin Mad Max Cavalry he had raised.\nHe’d lost contact with them three days ago when his apprentice troops were wiped out, and now they were looking for him!\n‘You bastards, I’m still alive…’\nWait. Just because they’re here doesn’t mean he’s alive?\nGob recalled the cavalry’s top speed and Leon’s top frequency from his memory.\n‘That bastard…the crazy bastard who chased me barefoot even when I was running away on a wyvern!’\nA chill ran down his spine as he recalled the madman who had chased him down and tried to tear him apart.\nJust then──\n“Gobla, come here!”\nLeon’s voice called from inside the cave, and he pushed my way through, afraid that he would find me and my guards.\n“You’ve come.”\nBeatrice was there, waiting with the gate open.\n‘You found the coordinates!’\nAfter three days of watching, I realized that their purpose was to find a certain place in this demonic realm.\nWhat a timely discovery! I wish they would disappear through the gate!\n“You’re going?”\n“Yes, I am, though I’m tempted to take you with me.”\n“Oh, no, no, no, it’s okay!”\nGob waved his hands in the air and denied it.\n“I did not expect to find another faith like yours in a place like this. This is fate…”\n“It’s the guidance of the Lickety-Split!”\n“Yes, the guidance of that god.”\nLeon patted Gob’s shoulder.\n“This king will return to this place one day, and when I come back I’ll tear the filthy bastards to shreds.”\nLeon’s words were meant as encouragement, but to Gob, they were a curse.\n‘You suck! You suck! You suck!’\nLeon’s declaration to a desperate Gob was like a blast from the past.\n“It’s a shame we’re parting like this. This king has a blessing for you. Give me that old staff.”\n‘The staff?”’\nA blessing.\nIn other words, to bestow some sort of favor with holy power.\nFor a normal human, it would be something to bow down to and consider a lifetime of honor, but for a demon, it worked differently.\nThe blessing of holy power is the ultimate curse for demons! Leon was now offering to shove a radioactive fuel rod up Gob’s ass.\n‘Well, if I refuse, I’m fucked!’\nBut now it’s too late to refuse. A refusal here would arouse suspicion, and this Lionheart King would tear him limb from limb before he crossed the gate.\n“Thank you…….”\n“Haha, I knew it.”\nWith a shaky hand, Gob handed over the staff that had served him for two hundred and fifty years.\n“Goddess of Light.”\nLeon blessed the staff in his hand. A blessing from a man the size of the Lionhearted King is the equivalent of a divine blessing.\n‘Farewell Staff…….’\nNo matter how much power I’ve been accumulating, it’s only been inside the staff.\nBut now, with Leon’s blessing, the staff, which had become an object, was no longer a demonic staff.\n“Here, take it. It will be quite a force in this polluted land.”\n“…….”\nYou want me to take that radioactive lump in my hand and die?\nGob shook his head with as much restraint as he could muster.\n“…Come to think of it, I’d like to offer this staff to your majesty!”\n“What, why?”\n“With Your Majesty’s blessing, it has become too conspicuous an object in this land!”\nThe words made Leon feel sick; why hadn’t he used the Holy Law to create the gate?\nTo avoid being seen by the demons. But now that he had a staff that he had blessed himself, it was no longer something a lone Gob could easily carry around.\n“This king made a mistake.”\n“No!”\nGob would rather Leon had taken the staff, for leaving such a concentrated holy object on the land would endlessly pollute it.\nAnd it would be his responsibility to fix the issue.\n“This king will take the staff.”\n‘That’s it!’\nGob sang a song of relief.\n“I will give you a blessing instead.”\n“Oh?”\nLeon laid his hand on Gob’s head. “Do not refuse, my friend,” he said with a kind smile.\nThe next moment, Leon’s touch blessed Gob.\nHis heartfelt blessing was a sincere favor from Leon but──\n“Grrrr!”\nGob, being cooked from the inside out by holy power, desperately swallowed the boiling foam.\nHis gaunt face and shivering body resemble the corpse of a frog in an electrode experiment.\n“Hahahahat, are you so happy?”\n‘Yi, you bastard!’\nLeon’s blessing went on for another thirty seconds or so.\n* * * * *\nThe goblin cavalry spotted the light emanating from the cave and galloped towards it.\n“There!”\n“There’s something there!”\nThe loyal goblin riders spotted Gob emerging from the cave, but were quickly drawn back by the terrible aura emanating from him.\n“Boss!”\n“What the hell happened?”\nGob was in terrible shape.\nHis entire body was scorched red, and the smoke billowing from his crown was enough to make you wonder if he was still alive.\nIf Gob hadn’t been somewhat resistant to the heat, as he studied holy power, he might have died.\n“Grrr, grrrr…!”\nThe cavalry burst into tears as he went limp.\n“What kind of rascals do you think you are, spoiling your boss?”\nGob exclaimed angrily.\n“Oh, no, never!”\nThe cavalry captain cocked his head at his attitude.\n“Don’t you think you ought to be jostled?”\n“No, we’ll get our asses handed to us if we try, and we shouldn’t even think about fighting them, and we shouldn’t provoke them!”\n“????”\nThe cavalry gave him a puzzled look, but Gob knew.\nIf they charged, they would be slaughtered!\nHow much time had passed? Gob groaned as he realized he couldn’t detect any heat signatures in the cave.\n“Ah!”\nGob gasped and turned toward the cave, where the two had disappeared.\n“Boss, what’s going on!”\n“They leapt through the gate! They’re gone! Gahahahaha!”\n“”???””\nThe cavalry captain chimed in, looking puzzled.\n“If they jumped through the gate, wouldn’t the boss be able to chase them?”\nGob shouted, annoyed by the cavalry captain’s words.\n“Nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, we didn’t see anything, did we, Algernon?”\n“Hmm?”\n“Think about it! What’s going to happen if we report this upstairs? They’re going to tell us to go after them, and then you and I will be dead!”\nGob is a survivor, and he never does anything that puts his life in danger.\nEspecially when it comes to Lionheart, he has a precise belief system.\n“It’s better that we don’t see them again! You know?!”\n“……Yes.”\nAnd with that, Gob hopped on one of the motorcycles.\n“Let’s go! Let’s all pretend that what happened today never happened!”\n“”Yes! Boss!!””\nThe sun sets as the motorcycles disappear into the distance.\nThe goblin cavalry rushes by, exhaust puffing out.\n‘… I survived today…….’",

      "content": "Chapter 153: The Lionheart King’s Representative\nBeyond the space that Beatrice had leapt to in search of coordinates was a pure white ‘glacier’.\n“This is…….”\nMassive ice, from the ground she stepped on to the horizon and beyond. A vast glacier, as if an entire continent had been frozen.\n“It’s amazing, it’s like a land of ice…….”\n“Isn’t it cold?”\nLeon asked, concerned for Beatrice at the unusual chill.\n“I’m fine. If I raise my body temperature with magic──”\nBeatrice performed a magic trick to raise her body temperature, but realized that it was less effective than she thought.\n“Magic… I’m limited in the use of my magic power. The consumption rate has increased, and the effectiveness has decreased.”\n“Same here. I can’t summon any holy objects, and I’m not able to unfold the Holy Law properly.”\nBeatrice’s expression was one of despair. Unlike her own magic, Leon’s Holy Law was a different kind of power.\nWhat kind of place was this that even such a power can be restricted?\n“Don’t get me wrong. I can use the Holy Law if I want to, it’s just that the cost/benefit ratio would be too low.”\n“That’s good to hear… let’s just… get back to it, shall we? I can open the gate at least once with all my power.”\n“No, going back won’t change anything. The power that freezes this space is something tantamount to holy law, and it’s not something we can overcome by wearing a coat.”\nIn other words, this place must be explored at this penalty.\n“Beatrice, you won’t use any magic since you’ll have to open the gate when we leave.”\n“I will do so, Your Majesty, rather than…….”\nBeatrice held up the Ritual Dagger of Vulcanus.\nThe old dagger burned brighter than before. The lava-like flames flowing from within are slowly revealing themselves.\n“We are closer to Lord Vulcanus. His dagger will be our guide.”\nLeon takes the dagger from Beatrice and begins to walk across the Glacial Continent,\n* * * *\nThe Glacial Continent gave the two of them all sorts of penalties.\nThere’s not much they can do about it, given its ‘freeze in time and space’ nature. All they can do is walk in the direction pointed by Vulcanus’ flashing ritual dagger.\nBut it’s not just the cold, icy continent that plagues them.\n“It’s an ice storm.”\nBeatrice clicks her tongue at the blizzard she’s encountered many times already.\nThis glacial continent is a never-ending weather phenomenon that threatens to destroy everything that lives.\n“…….”\nIt was a chill that seeped into their bones without even touching them and only a few superhumans could survive here.\n“Whoa…….”\n“Are you okay?”\n“Yes… but we’ll have to hurry and get out of here, I’m sorry.”\n“The forces here sealed your magic. Don’t blame yourself.”\nBeatrice, who had her magic sealed to keep it intact, is no different from an ordinary woman.\n“Let’s get out of the ice storm.”\nShe turns and heads back. The frozen glacial ground makes walking uncomfortable, the only consolation being the lack of slippery snow but the snow is ankle-deep with every step.\n“Forgive my rudeness.”\n“Your Majesty…?!”\nLeon sweeps her up in his arms and walks away. Her purple eyes widen in surprise, but he doesn’t care.\n“We have to go. I need you to hold on.”\n“I’m… I’m fine, Your Majesty, but…….”\nOf course, carrying a woman wasn’t enough to make Leon worry about his stamina.\n“You’re too light as a feather to worry about the load.”\n“Hee hee hee, isn’t that obvious for a lady?”\n“Oh, no. Did this king’s words come across as pretentious?”\nBeatrice smiled and let herself fall into Leon’s arms.\n“No, I’m light-hearted, to say the least.”\n“Ha-ha. You’re surprisingly nonchalant about saying blatant things.”\n“It’s a logical fact.”\nThe two flirted more than usual. They instinctively know that in this harsh environment, it’s comforting to have someone to talk to.\n“If I’d known it was going to be like this, I should have brought Ha-ri with me.”\n“Miss Ha-ri is very talented.”\nOf course, anything Ha-ri can do, Leon can do better. But in order to minimize the consumption of holy power, he needed someone to do it for him.\n“She’s very talented. It’s rare for two gods to favor someone so much.”\n“Would Ms. Ha-ri or Ms. So-yeon become the next Holy Knight of the TTG Temple?”\nBeatrice asks, suddenly curious.\nAll the Holy Knights in the TTG Temple are survivors.\nNot to mention Leon and Yappy, whose karma is enough to make them heroes.\nBut Leon needs more Holy Knights. The number of Holy Knights they saw in the Lionheart Kingdom gate was not even half of what Lionheart was at its peak.\n“Hmm… Both of them are talented enough to become Holy Knights.”\n“You think highly of them?”\n“Talented people are everywhere but few actually fulfill it.”\nOnly a few had the talent to become Holy Knights, but even fewer are recognized as Holy Knights.\n“The seat of the Holy Knight is not one that can be attained by mere talent. Strength and talent can be… surprisingly unrelated.”\nLeon remembered the oldest Holy Knight.\nA noble and faithful old knight, whose beliefs and faithfulness to the end had made him a Knight of the Goddess.\n“Sir Jerea was…….”\nJust as Leon was about to reminisce, the sound of light breathing drifted up his chest.\nBeatrice was fast asleep, looking exhausted in more ways than one.\n“We’d better hurry.”\nAfter picking her up, Leon began to walk quickly across the glacial continent.\n* * * *\nThe outbreak of Gates had spread rapidly enough that not only the Association and the Hunter Guilds, but also the civilian population felt it.\n-Crazy, there’s a gate in front of my house.\n-What color is it?\n-Yellow!\n-No big deal. It’s orange here.\n-I live in L.A. and it’s crazy here too. The National Guard is out in full force.\n-I was traveling in Turkey and a gate appeared in the middle of the tourist area…….\nGates are popping up all over the world, not just in Korea. It felt like a harbinger of something.\n“Why is there a gate in the middle of the ocean?”\n“Isn’t that a dragon palace?!”\nThe gate appeared off the coast of Mokpo, and the coast guard ships went into a state of emergency.\nThey sent fishermen home early and warned shipyards.\n“Isn’t the Dragon Palace the first priority to be cleared? If that dungeon breaks, the sea here will die!”\n“The whole country is in such a mess right now, if we’re going to dispatch an invasion force…….”\nCaptain Oh of the 3009th stared at the gate on the surface of the water while stomping his feet.\nWith the shortage of raiders right now, would there be any raiders who could clear the tricky Dragon Palace Gate?\n“What? Oh Kyung-jung! Look at the radar!”\nIt was then. The Coast Guard officer who was checking the radar of the guard ship reported to him.\n“We’ve got a lot of activity on the radar! Chinese fishing boats… no, this is coming from the direction of Mokpo!”\n“Huh?”\nWere they friendly vessels? No, they’re too small and too numerous for that.\n“Distance 100! 90! 70! No, what’s going so fast?!”\nThe officers are alarmed. They’re approaching the 3009 at a speed greater than the speed of light!\n“Chu, collision?”\n“Armament ready!”\nAt the captain’s command, the 3009’s 40mm twin 40mm guns and 20mm Balkans are pointed in that direction. But there is nothing on the surface, which means it’s a submarine…….\n‘A large fleet of submarines in the middle of South Korea? North Korea?’\nBut how can a North Korean submarine come to the coast of Mokpo, even on such a large scale?\nEven though we haven’t received any information from North Korea lately, is there any reason for such a hasty offensive?\n“Captain, give me permission to fire…!”\nAs the situation grew more urgent, Captain Oh was about to order the attack, but then something caught his attention.\n“Don’t open fire!!”\nAlmost simultaneously with the urgent voice something broke the surface.\nIt was a small submersible, about 500 tons, similar to the South Korean Navy’s Dolphin-class infiltration submersibles, which could have carried ten men.\n“Bam!”\nThe sub’s hatch opened and out stepped a familiar mascot from Mokpo. It was a Kikiruk.\nFully armed with large claws and distinctive “cannon armor,” the warrior saluted in human fashion and asked for greetings.\n-Crackle, crackle, crackle, crackle!\nThe warrior’s words were translated in real time by the machine.\n“Greymion Andrew Maximus Clygent, senior warrior, 1st Assault Landing Battalion.”\n“Uh, I’m Officer Kang-tae Oh, Captain of the 3009th, Mokpo Coast Guard.”\nAfter confirming each other’s affiliations, the chirpy warrior spoke.\n“This unit is scheduled to destroy the hostile forces off the coast of Mokpo. We advise you to withdraw from the area of operations.”\n“We can’t do that! These are our waters and we…No, more than that, you don’t have the right to operate in them and to act like this is…….”\n“Direct orders from Lord Yakt Spinner. Authorized by the Hunter’s Association. I am also an official Hunter. No legal issues.”\nIt’s real. The hunter’s card that the Kikiruk warrior displayed was emblazoned with his pompous and majestic name and official certification as a Class B Hunter.\n“Hmph…! Then this ship will proceed with the mission to return the fishing boats that have yet to be evacuated….Senior Warrior Greymion, please clear the Dragon Palace Gate.”\n“No problem.”\nThe Kikiruk warrior then enters the sub again as dozens of stalled submersibles begin to move again.\n“Whoa… when did they build those?”\n“We almost shot them.”\nThe coastguards breathe a sigh of relief.\n-Kaaaaaah!\nA huge wave hit the 3009. It was big enough to rock a 3,000-ton ship.\n“What, what!”\n“What passed under there?!”\nIt took them a moment to realize what it was.\n* * * *\nThe Korean Hunter Association has issued a general mobilization order.\nEveryone knew why the Hunter Association, which usually frowned on interfering with private guilds, had urgently called the ten guilds.\n“This isn’t a normal pandemonium.”\nGolden Lion Guild’s leader, Golden Chul, came forward to give the eyewitness account of the gates he had seen.\n“That’s two gates a minute. Who’s raiding them?”\n“The auction hasn’t even started yet, it’s a complicated process.”\nYong-wan had flown in by helicopter, but he could see that the nation was in an uproar, and it wasn’t a normal uproar. Right now, Vice Guild Leader Ha Yuri is at the headquarters trying to figure out which gate to bid on first.\n“Everyone’s here.”\nOh Kang-hyuk, the head of the Association who called the ten guilds, enters with a tired expression. Behind him, Yappy and Ha-ri enter together.\n-Where are the Lion King and the Magician Queen?\n-Did they leave?\n-Are they attacking another gate?\nThe face of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods is, of course, Leon. Sometimes, when he was busy, Beatrice would fill in for him.\nThe appearance of Yappy, who has been invisible in public, came as a surprise to everyone and there are some people who are not happy that Yappy is taking a seat at the roundtable.\n“No matter how multicultural you say you are, should you treat machines like people?”\n“Mr. Kim Jin-cheol!”\nJin-cheol Kim of Shark Guild. He’s the biggest guy in the room, covered in tattoos and looking dangerous.\nAs a former thug, he has no qualms with his behavior, unlike the other guild leaders who are relatively gentle.\n-Cringe!\nBut Yappy put Ha-ri in his seat and stood on top of her, despite Kim Jin-cheol’s words.\n“Huh, is this what you do in meetings?”\n-Complaint? Organism?\n“Nope…….”\nHa-ri thought that Yappy on her head was like a monster from an old creature movie. The kind that climbs on top of people’s heads and manipulates their brains.\n-Straighten up, organism. Keep your eyes level, warning.\n“Yes!”\nHa-ri sat upright with a snap.\n“Hmph… That’s too much. I’m an S-class Hunter now, and a priestess of two gods…….”\n-I’m a Holy Knight, a being who exists above the law.\n“No, Lord Yappy, isn’t the supreme being the King?”\n-Is the king here?\n“He isn’t.”\nYappy didn’t say anything more, just slapped Ha-ri on the cheek with his mechanical leg.\n-Good one.\n“I have…….”\nWatching the scene, Yong-wan thought.\n“The end of the……human era has arrived.\nHe realized that the terrifying killing machine was uncontrollable without the Lionheart King.\n“These assholes are ignoring me now!”\nWith a bang, the big man stood up from the round table. Kim Jin-cheol stomped towards Yappy and Ha-ri with a fierce expression on his face.\n“…….”\nOh Kang-hyuk watched the scene but he sighed and pretended not to notice.\n“Hmph!”\nKim Jin-cheol, who must have taken that as a tacit rebuff, looked down at Yappy, who was perched on top of Ha-ri’s head.\n“I don’t know if you’re Cheongju killing machine or the Holy Knight of TTG Temple, but don’t talk about machines in the presence of humans. Bring a human!”\n“Uh, I’m a human, too?”\nJin-cheol bellowed at Ha-ri, who cautiously raised her hand.\n“The end of the Association is woven!”\n“Ugh…!”\nHa-ri cowered under the S-class Hunter’s tirade. Yappy’s camera eye glowed red as he looked at Ha-ri, wondering what was wrong with her.\n“Mr. President, is it okay for a machine to appear in a place like this? Huh?”\n“Sir Yakt Spinner is fully qualified. His Majesty King Lionheart has vouched for him.”\nOh Kang-hyuk sneaked a glance at Yappy but Yappy was obviously staring at Kim Jin Chul.\n“What are you doing?”\n-Considering, putting together a conversational paragraph befitting the intellect of an ancient organism.\n“Huh?”\n-Composition completed. Completing an appropriate sentence.\nYappy’s emoji is somehow distorted, as if he had been studying Kim Jong-Cheol.\n-What a fucking asshole.\nLearning too well was a problem.",

      "content": "Chapter 154: Who’s threatening you with a knife?\nYappy’s training data comes from the vastness of big data in the internet world.\nClass systems, social systems, laws, hierarchies… the list is endless, and Yappy deduces the most appropriate, rational, and logical outcome based on big data.\nThis is even true in religious life.\nIf you put a person on fire, they die. If you set them on fire without a trial, you recognize it as irrational thinking, but if you add the extra code of “divinity,” you ignore the laws.\nNext comes the part about living with people, and here, too, Yappy is surprisingly logical.\nThe Holy Knights are above the law, and their authority is recognized on Earth.\nThe reason for the authority is that the Holy Knight is a superpower.\nEven in the world of Yappy, which is a futuristic world that is much more advanced than the modern, civilized world, power is power.\nRespect comes from authority, and authority is borrowed from power.\nIn that sense, Yappy is the top predator in the ecosystem.\nWisdom for wisdom, knowledge for knowledge, force for force. It has no qualms about comparing itself to lesser organisms.\nThere are two other beings more powerful than him, and they are his ‘backup’.\nYappy analyzed Kim Jin-cheol.\nGuild leader of Shark Guild, one of the top ten guilds in Korea.\nAge 34. Eight criminal convictions. A criminal in his own right who is still committing colorful crimes such as tax evasion, assault, molestation, and drugs.\nHowever, he is respected as the guild leader of one of the top 10 guilds in Korea because he has more power and social authority than others.\nHe’s made his fortune through a series of legal and illegal businesses.\nThe power to bribe political powers and gain their favor.\nHis own strength and the ability to mobilize two hundred high-ranking hunters.\nThen.\nWhat does this asshole have against me?\nThe machine can’t help but come to the same conclusion.\nWealth? What Kim Jin-cheol made in a lifetime, Yappy can make in a week.\nPower? He can socially bury the politicians associated with Kim Jin-cheol right now.\nForce? It’s ridiculous to discuss force in front of a Holy Knight.\nNo matter how he looked at it, this asshole doesn’t deserve to boss him around, but he is.\n-Giggle!\nYappy understood Kim Jin-cheol’s upbringing and the personality it shaped.\nHe’s a bully and an asshole.\nHe’s lived in a world where strength is everything and he has to show it off.\nHe has lived in an uncivilized beast society where he is a pathetic bipedal beast who has no choice but to show his presence by baring his teeth no matter who he is dealing with.\nA beast must speak to a beast. Yappy concluded.\n-What a fucking bastard.\nNo matter how many times you look at it, there’s no way around it.\n“………….”\n“………….”\nThe room falls silent.\nEveryone rolls their eyes and examines their ears in disbelief.\nWhat did that mechanical robot say?\nWhat about Kim Jin-cheol, who heard directly?\n“You, you…!”\nKim Jin-cheol’s face was boiling red at the outrageous words.\nYappy had anticipated what a human being like Kim Jin-cheol would do in such a situation.\n“You bastard…!”\nA fist was swung and although he was unarmed, an S-class Hunter could smash a tank with his bare hands.\n-Organic, block.\n“Huh?!”\nHearing Yappy’s words, Ha-ri raised both arms to block Kim Jin-cheol fist.\nWith a dizzying sound, a wave of collision spreads across the round table.\nNo one here is surprised at the level of the S-class Hunter’s attack, but that’s not the reason for their admiration.\n‘Han Ha-ri blocked Kim Jin-cheol attack?’\n‘They said she grew to S-class, is that true?’\nHan Ha-ri had only been with the Association as an A-class Hunter for about half a year after graduating from the Academy, and yet she was able to block an attack from an S-class Hunter?\n‘After the youngest A-class, she’s the youngest S-class.’\n‘Her tremendous growth must be due to the TTG Temple.’\nIt’s been a while since Han Ha-ri officially became an S-class Hunter. However, her experience level was still different from Jin-cheol.\n“What are you…!”\nJin-cheol frowns as his attack is blocked by Ha-ri, who was only an A-class Hunter a short time ago but Ha-ri desperately shakes her head.\n“Eh? No, no, no, Hunter Jin-cheol. I didn’t do that on purpose!”\n-What? Are you defending him now?\nThe steel spider overhead tackled her and she felt the sting of its mechanical legs on her cheeks.\n“It’s not that, Sir Yappy…….”\nShe’s tempted to agree with Yappy, but she’s an employee of the Association.\nAs an official of a public organization, it was necessary to remain neutral.\n“I want to have a fight with you, you blue-eyed brat!”\n“Me? Why?!”\n-Don’t pout. You strike back.\n“Sir Yappy, please leave me alone, please!”\nKim Jin-cheol, whose pride prevents him from backing down, and Ha-ri, who was forced by Yappy.\n“Shut the fuck up!”\nKim Jin-cheol and Ha-ri flinched at the thunderous shout. The Divine Sword Guild’s Berserker Chen Jinsoo was glaring at them.\n“This is not a market floor, not a store, why are you raising your voices in front of adults! Hey, Kim Jin-cheol, what’s wrong with your head?!”\nEven Kim Jin-cheol, a former thug and the leader of a large guild, was helpless against Chen Jinsoo tirade.\n“…….”\nKim Jin-cheol sat back in his seat with a disgruntled look on his face as he pouted and grumbled.\nChun Jinsoo didn’t say anything to Yappy. He was about to say exactly that when Oh Kang-hyuk whispered in his ear.\n“Lord Yappy says that this year he became one thousand thirty-two years old.\n‘……Really?’\n‘Really.’\nAt this point, he couldn’t help but pout at the fact.\nWhat the hell is three hundred years old in this modern society, and what is one thousand years old…….\n“Hmph…! Anyway, in the absence of the Lionheart King, the representative of the TTG Temple is Lord Yakt Spinner, Holy Knight of the Iron and Blacksmiths, and his authority to attend the meeting is sufficient.”\nThat was a stern warning not to say more nonsense.\n“And I’m sure there’s no need for further explanation of the situation.”\nEven with the ten guilds in attendance, the conclusion was obvious.\nMobilize all Hunters to respond to the simultaneous outbreak of gates on a national… no, global scale.\n“The operation will be led by our Association, which is a government organization, and we will ignore the gate auction and looting process in favor of a swift capture.”\nIn other words, no one would be allowed to waste time bidding on which gate was more valuable, and no one would be allowed to mine for magic stones.\nThis is a big deal, considering modern gate raiding is all about money.\n“No, if you can quickly capture all those gates without getting any loot…….”\nAlthough Lee Yong-wan expressed his regret that he was greedy for money, he didn’t come out too strongly against it. However, there were still voices that actively opposed it.\n“That’s ridiculous, you have to earn money to feed your kids and pay salaries!”\nKim Jin-cheol of Shark Guild was a staunch austerityist.\n“Well, you know our kids are expensive, so if we’re going to send healers, you should give them something.”\nYoon Soo-ah of Juwon Medical, followed by Park Jong-soo of Mujin Guild.\n“We can’t. We’re a civilian guild, there’s no reason for us to be under the government’s command. We should at least be able to control our own operations.”\nKang Jin-sung of the Infinite Sword Guild.\nThe majority of the opposition is the so-called ‘Tax Free Expansion Alliance’, including Kang Jin-sung. Yong Wan of the Firebird Guild also belonged to this group, but had recently distanced himself from them.\nAnd there’s one other former member of this group who has publicly broken away.\n“In times of global crisis, heroes must step up to the plate, and we at the Hanbit Palace are willing to follow the government’s lead, as I’m sure he would be pleased.”\nPark Yong-shin, the most cultish of the cultists, has changed his religion and is acting awkwardly.\nWhen Park Yong-shin stirred the pot, Golden Chul chimed in.\n“It’s a global crisis, isn’t it better to cooperate with each other in times like this?”\nChun Jinsoo threw his hands in the air in support of the Golden Lion Guild.\n“In times of national emergency, we must obey the king’s orders, Mr. Kang Jin-cheol; you’re still playing with money at a time like this!”\nChun Jinsoo glances at Kang Jin-cheol but Kang Jin-cheol also has something to say.\n“It’s not a matter of playing with money. It’s a matter of procedure and precedent. You know how the government used up Hunters in the early days of the Cataclysm.”\nThe early days of the Cataclysm were a time of chaos. The government took Hunters as soldiers and sent them out to attack gates, often with disastrous casualty rates.\nKang Jin-cheol believed that money and power were the only things that could be trusted in such times, and he prioritized the interests of the Hunters.\nMoreover, the younger Hunters were more inclined to sympathize with his position.\n“If Brother Leon were here, he’d be screaming.”\n“Is the Lionheart King your brother or my brother?”\nKang Jin- cheol looked at his old friend, who had grown close to the TTG Temple since the incident with the Demon Archduke Akasha, with annoyance.\n“Mr. Oh Kang Hyuk, you have no legal grounds to force us. You know that, right?”\nThe same old friend, now in a different position, stares at Oh Kang-hyuk. Kang Jin-cheol expected him to come up with something at this point.\nIt’s the natural order of politics.\n“I see. I’d like to offer some rights to the Hunters who respond to this mobilization order.”\nOh Kang-hyuk looked strangely relaxed. He glanced at Yappy, garnering an unspoken agreement, and then announced the reason for the leeway.\n“Kim Jin-soo, please come in.”\nKim Jin-soo opened the door and walked in, followed by several Association employees.\nWhat made them stand out was that each of them brought a weapon.\n“This?”\nArmor, swords, spears, and other weaponry were placed on a round table as if they were for sale.\n“Ha! It looks like a unique item, but do you think I’m going to crawl under your bed for a few of these? I have enough of this stuff in my warehouse.”\nKim Jin-cheol smirked as if this was his best hand. ‘Actually, when you’re an S-class Hunter, you’re supposed to carry some unique items as standard.’\nAmong them, securing a Legendary weapon is the basic skill of an S-class Hunter.\nOf course, unique items weren’t something that could be easily acquired with money, but it wasn’t something that could make S-class Hunters suffer.\n“The armor on display is ‘mass-produced’ Stellar Iron Armor from Lord Yakt Spinner’s workshop in the TTG Temple. How much is being produced this month?”\n-1,300 sets of weapons and light and heavy armor? Production has been hampered by a decrease in serfs.\n“”…………?!!””\nWhat did they just hear? 1,300 sets of unique items? Over 2,600 unique items were produced in a “month,” even if you count each weapon and each suit of armor as a set?\n“Nonsense!”\nRare items alone are painstakingly crafted by skilled artisans in small batches. Unique items are masterpieces that take weeks to create by blacksmiths who are said to be master craftsmen of large companies.\nIf you were to add up all the unique items on the Korean Peninsula, you wouldn’t get more than a thousand.\n“Unique isn’t even your dog’s name!”\nHa-ri raised his hand in response to Kim Jin-cheol’s harsh retort.\n“This is a matter that His Excellency the President confirmed during his last visit… The Association and TTG Temple have a formal supply contract.”\n“Ms. Han is right.”\nThe Hunters in the room looked on in disbelief as even Association President Oh Kang-hyuk agreed and Lee Yong-wan raised his hand.\n“Are there any…Legendary among those mass-produced items?”\n“The knights of the Ten Thousand Gods Temple are all equipped with Blessed Star Iron Armor.”\nThe words stunned Yong-wan.\n‘The Knight class in the TTG Temple starts with B-class Hunters. Once they became S-class Hunters they’re going to receive a full set of Legendary items?’\nIs such a ridiculous amount of money even possible?\nOr worse, what kind of crazy blacksmith is “mass-producing” these monstrosities?\n“Guilds participating in the mobilization will be given ‘priority rights’ to purchase the stardust-containing armor and customizable stardust armor that our Association has contracted with TTG Temple.”\nEveryone’s attention was drawn to Oh Kang-hyuk’s words. Not payment, but priority purchase rights.\nIt was a very arrogant sales pitch, but the Star Iron Armor is worth it.\n“Oh, President Takeda of the Japanese Hunter’s Association and the Maverick Guild of the United States have contacted us to make a down payment of 10 trillion won.”\nThe Korean Hunters were stunned by Oh’s words.\n-Boom!\nAll eyes turn to Ha-ri’s head.\nThe machine, seemingly devoid of human emotion, somehow managed to give all the organisms an arrogant glare.",

      "content": "Chapter 155: Next to You\nThe enemy is coming.\nTheir name is the Demons.\nTheir song is endless pleasure, and their desire is bottomless depravity.\nThe general said. “I will defend this place!”\nThe scene is familiar.\nLines being pushed and pushed, friendly units retreating. Units of the Order holding the line to keep the main body intact.\nMaking sacrifices, ordering sacrifices, watching sacrifices, the resistance continues to retreat.\n“This war…when will it end?”\nNone of her subjects could answer her lament with certainty.\nThe enemy does not die.\nEven if you kill them, they come back from the dead.\nTo them, material bodies are no different than golems powered by magic.\nEven when they organize a coalition to break down one demon gate, demons pour out of a new one.\nCountless kingdoms and cities were destroyed, and in the end, in the last remaining city, a voice whispered to her.\n[Queen, make a deal with me]\nPlant the Essence of Corruption, and if you last a hundred years, I will end the endless war and step down.\nShe had no choice, so she accepted, and so began a hundred harsh years of revenge on the queen who had stood in their way.\n“I am the Lionheart King.”\nUntil the man appeared.\n* * * * *\nThe Magician Queen of the Kingdom of Spero.\nDespite her exalted name and authority, Beatrice is no stranger to the outdoors.\nAs the kingdom’s supreme power, she has spent most of her life on the battlefield since her ascension to the throne as a field commander.\nIn the swamps of summer, where flies and mosquitoes swarm, and in the frigid snowfields, where horses freeze to death.\nHer experience in the field and camping out over and over again has made her generally tolerant of most conditions.\nOf course, as the face of the kingdom and a symbol of the Demon Resistance, she is constrained by the need to always appear well-groomed and relaxed.\nIn that sense, it could be said that she failed to maintain that dignity this time.\n“Ugh…….”\nOpening her eyes, Beatrice wore a rare expression of despair.\nShe had unwittingly fallen asleep, knowing how dangerous it was to sleep in the freezing cold!\nBut it wasn’t the icy cold of the snowfields that greeted her, but a soothing warmth.\n“You’re awake.”\n“Your Majesty?”\nShe heard Leon’s voice. He was stirring the flames with his bare hands, melting the center of the den.\nNeedless to say, the flames burning in the absence of a single branch for firewood are the flames of the god Petos.\n“I dug a snow hole since we need to rest for a while.”\nBeatrice blushed at the realization that she had fallen asleep in front of Leon but Leon smiled at her and handed her the Holy Grail.\n“Quench your thirst with holy water. ”\n“This precious thing…….”\nIt was said that holy water could be created with only holy power, but Leon was in a position to save every bit of it.\nAs if he could read her thoughts, Leon reassured her not to worry.\n“This is fine. Consider it a necessary expense.”\n“Then…thanks.”\nBeatrice accepts the grail that should be enshrined in a shrine after all the work that went into making it, but for now it’s just a goblet of water to quench her thirst.\nThe holy water feels warm as it slides down her throat and Beatrice looks up at Leon with a puzzled expression.\n“I…Your Majesty.”\n“What is it?”\n“To see if I…have done something impolite.”\n“Nothing much. You seemed to have stirred up some old memories.”\n“I was ……embarrassed.”\nSometimes she dreams of the past, her times of glory and the nightmare of her downfall.\nIt was a miserable time that she could not tell anyone about.\n“You have nothing to be ashamed of.”\n“Your Majesty?”\nLeon smiled bitterly and confessed.\n“The past is a beautiful thing. It’s a dream I long to return to.”\n“…….”\nBeatrice clenched her jaw, empathizing with Leon’s story.\nShe knew his past, how he’d lost people he loved and cared about, how he’d fought to the end.\nHow great was the loss he must have felt when they were all dead and he was alone?\nThe only person in the world who could relate to his pain would be himself. Conversely, the only person who can empathize with his pain is…….\n“I’m going to take a break. Get some more rest.”\n“Yeah…….”\nBeatrice hugged herself in the generous snow and realized that she had been covered with something all this time.\n“Your Majesty, what is this?”\n“A knight’s cloak, acquired by chance on Earth. A gift from that honorable knight.”\nIt was the cloak of the Headless Knight that Leon had been honored with. Apparently, Leon had taken it out of subspace and covered her with it.\n“Your Majesty…….”\nWith his cloak covering her, Leon is sitting virtually naked in the snow but he didn’t seem to mind.\n“This king is fine. I’m a knight.”\nBeatrice was suddenly reminded of her general, Ricardo Burns.\nHe was a loyal knight who had tried to serve his queen even as he became a Death Knight himself. For their foolish loyalty, Beatrice could not repay them.\n“Is that what all knights are like?”\n“So I was taught.”\nLeon had been born to a grand duke and thoroughly trained in chivalry. He knew how to honor what men and women were supposed to honor, and how to treat each other with care and respect.\nBut more than that.\n“It is a knight’s duty.”\n“Duty….”\nDoes the word “duty” even begin to cover the endless sacrifices?\nAt least for Grand Marshal Ricardo Burns and his knights, the Lionheart King of the Lionheart Kingdom was a man whose duty was greater than his right.\n“Your Majesty.”\nBeatrice gently lifted her cloak, revealing the hollow inside.\n“There’s plenty of room, please come in.”\n“Hmph… I see your point, but…….”\nWhen one cloak covers another, there is inevitably skin to skin contact. Leon didn’t think it was polite to the lady.\nAnd Beatrice didn’t think it was polite to leave Leon alone and wear the cloak herself. Most of all──\n“Come on, are you planning on embarrassing me?”\nA rather blatant flirtation, one that the queen was quite prepared for.\n“I would never… embarrass a lady.”\nLeon carefully slipped into the cloak. Flesh pressed against flesh.\n“Not uncomfortable?”\n“Not uncomfortable, just warmer.”\nBeatrice leaned against Leon’s shoulder, her abruptness catching him off guard.\n“Beatrice…….”\n“Please allow me this much. I won’t…ask for more.”\n“…….”\nLeon let go of his shoulder without a word. The seat next to him remained empty for a long time.\nHe watched Beatrice’s defenseless form as she slept soundly.\n[Leon, my knight]\nArianna’s voice descended upon him.\n“Do not speak.”\nAnd in a rare moment, Leon refused but Light and Justice continued with a flurry of words.\n[Your goddess asks, when will you make a new love?]\nLeon smiled wryly at her words. He spoke out of turn, but the gods didn’t seem to think so.\n[Nay, neither do we, for true and pure will make a good wife.]\nAt the sound of Poma’s voice, Fle rebuked him.\n[Hush sea, for this is the turn of dreams and death, and the next queen’s place belongs to my priestess.]\n[You don’t think of anyone to feed, but you talk a good game.]\n[What is war, that thou shouldest defeat thee!]\nFle’s eyes whirled around as Petos spoke from the flames of the snow cave, but then the God of Vengeance spoke.\n[Avengers, it is right that they should be joined by the same avenger, a motive.]\n[The Darkness’s best candidate for queen is a young, blue child.]\n[A year younger than the goddess of the sea and war. War.]\n[Humans take that one year very seriously.]\nLeon wiped his forehead as Ventasis slipped in. Meanwhile, the Goddess of Light and Justice is relaxed.\n[Hoo-hoo, my knight, son of the Goddess of Light and Justice. I decide the pace.]\n“Goddess…I have only two mothers.”\nAn orphan, but one on Earth. The other, the Grand Duchess of Lionheart. A goddess is an object of worship, but not a mother…….\n[Let’s make it a third mother]\n“I can only imagine.”\nLeon stirred the hair of the woman who slept soundly beside him. She was a young, beautiful woman. She must be in the hearts of the gods because of her great favor with him.\n[I hadn’t forgotten Castile yet]\n“…….”\nLeon smiled bitterly, remembering his old love.\nHe snatched up the priestess who served the moon and the goddess of chastity and whispered his love. Then he had to undergo trials to appease the angry goddess of purity.\nIt was a love so hard-won that Leon cherished his wife and protected his home.\nNow that she was dead and in the arms of the gods, he cannot covet a new woman.\n[Leon, my knight, your life is not meant to be with common women. Your tender heart may be pleasing to her, but what about your weary mind and body and your unrelieved misery]\nArianna…The gods, as well as she, were worried about this stout lion king.\nEven the gods live for eons, sharing their mortal frailties and falling in fiery love.\nAs the gods would have it, Leon had protected his chastity for too long.\nHe’s been on a bloody demon hunt with an insatiable appetite.\nIn the eyes of the gods, his end should have come long ago.\n[You also have a duty, as the only living human of the Lionheart, to keep its bloodline alive and thriving.]\n“…….”\nThe goddess laughed and a tear ran down Leon’s cheek as he was still unable to answer.\n[Love like a star, Leon, you deserve it]\nLeon leaned back and glanced over at the queen, who lay exhausted.\nHe is still young and healthy. Even though it’s been two hundred years since he’s held a woman. But…….\n[Father]\nHe recalled old memories. The fruit of his love and the hope that the child who did not end well is alive.\nIt’s not something to be taken lightly.\nSo for now he can only endure.\nThe lady next to him adjusts the cloak to keep her from getting cold, and even in the harshness of the glacial continent, her skin is warm and soft against his.\n* * * * *\n“The reactions are getting stronger.”\nBeatrice led Leon in a direction where the flames of the dagger were becoming increasingly clear.\n“Beatrice, there don’t seem to be any other creatures around.”\nAfter several days of exploration, they had not seen a single demon in this frigid land.\nOf course, in a land that Leon and Beatrice could only endure so much, any demons would attack on approach.\n“I thought there would be glacial demons.”\n“You mean the demons of sloth and idleness?”\n“Yes, and the demons of icy coldness. They are quite troublesome… but nothing compared to the flames of the gods.”\nAt the turn of the Randolce Plain, Vulcanus led his knights against them and eventually Leon heard that they had repulsed the demonic legions.\n“Nevertheless, the disappearance of Sir Vulcanus and his knights is puzzling. But now that I’m here, it’s not impossible.”\nWhat a cold, bitter continent. It’s almost like a law.\n“But that makes me even more convinced that Lord Vulcanus is alive on this continent.”\n“You mean cold sleep… ah, in His Majesty’s world, the theory is…….”\n“I’ve heard of it from Lord Yappy.”\nIn Leon’s world, science hadn’t progressed that far. But it’s not a theory he’s unfamiliar with, having vaguely heard of it in his time as an Earthling.\n“They are the knights of God. They must have survived in a world where even space and time were frozen.”\nIt was then that Leon halted Beatrice and began to sense something.\n“Petos.”\n[Yes, I can feel it, I had to get this close to find it.]\nPetos, the god of war and flame, shared the same sensation as Leon, his searing fire coursing through his body.\n“There it is. There’s someone there.”\nThe two hurriedly headed in the direction of their senses, and as they got closer, Vulcanus’ ritual dagger glowed with vivid flames.\n“Nothing but a giant…glacier.”\nA massive, towering wall of ice stood in their way. Frozen solid with snow and ice, it is harder and more massive than a rocky cliff.\nLeon stepped forward, facing the looming ice wall.\n“Stand back.”\nLeon drew his holy spear and the flames of Petos spun furiously around the tip.\nThe spiraling flames melted the ice wall as soon as they touched it, propelling him forward.\nHow far did it go? Several times before the icy water on the melted ice wall was vaporized by the divine flame, releasing a massive plume of steam.\n“Found it!”\nLeon spotted the familiar armor, though it was not Vulcanus── it was a crimson knight, from his helmet to his armor to his horse.\nEven the banner of the unit, symbolizing the glory of the Knights Templar that would never be forgotten.\n“Your Majesty, who are these?”\n“Knights of the Flaming Sword of Baltan, under the direct command of Lord Vulcanus, Holy Knight of War and Flame.”\nWithin the ice wall, countless knights were frozen and preserved.",

      "content": "Chapter 156: Knights of the Flaming Sword of Baltan\nIn the Great War with Lionheart, the demons suffered terrible losses.\nThe demons of Slaughter and Destruction, Wisdom and Exploration, Pleasure and Decadence, Chaos and Ruin, who lost their lords, suffered the most.\nThe Demons of Wisdom and Exploration, in particular, lost most of their highest ranking Archdemons, including the Archduke, in an all-out war with the Kingdom Army.\nAll of the demons lost a monarch or archduke in that war, but the Archdemons of Sloth and Idleness were in a more delicate position.\nThey didn’t lose a monarch, nor did they lose an archduke.\n“Lord Velotas…!”\nAt the observation post in front of Archduke Kadsha estate, the Archdemon of Sloth and Dullness, who was in charge of observing the glacial continent, woke up to the urgent report of Ice Observer Velotas.\n“Tell me…….”\nVelotas grunted, digging through his earwax and like an Archdemon of sloth, he stared at Beltata with a carefree expression.\n“This observatory on the Glacial Continent is a time killer for demons who were born slothful and lazy.\nIt was here that Kadsha, the Demon Archduke of Sloth and Idleness, destroyed them over two hundred years ago, and it was here that they were nominally stationed to guard the seal.\nThough it has been barren and uninhabitable to even demons since the events of two centuries ago, who could be trusted on a glacial continent in the middle of the Demon Realm?\nDemons, of course, don’t trust each other, but what’s in there is their natural enemy.\nIt’s like a ball of radioactivity that destroys all demons, and who could–\n“Energy has been detected inside the Glacial Continent! It’s the Zero Destruction Element!”\n“Hmph…!”\nVelotas, who had been reacting slowly, moved his unusually enlarged body.\n“Has the seal been broken?”\n“Uh, I don’t think so, since Archduke Kadsha’s magic reaction hasn’t awakened yet!”\nThat was a good thing. If the Glacier Archduke buried with him hadn’t awakened, it wouldn’t be the worst thing that could happen.\n“Kadsha magic is loose.”\nIt had been more than two hundred years since the Glacier Archduke Kadsha had unleashed the great magic that froze the continent.\nThe Demons of Wisdom and Exploration said it was a seal that would theoretically last a thousand years, but it’s already starting to break!\n“It’s a big deal, if that man… that monster… is released…!”\nIt was a day of horrific slaughter by that man who fell from the sky with flames──\n“You go first, lead the special forces. I will head straight for the legions that can be mobilized.”\nVelotas clutched at the burns on his side, recalling the trauma.\n* * * *\n“The Knights of the Flaming Sword, they must be.”\nLeon thrust the flame of his holy spear into the icy wall.\n“I will rescue them first.”\nThe holy flame does not hurt the worshippers of the divine. The only thing it melts is the block of ice that trapped him.\n-Swoosh!!!\nThe ice wall melts in a massive burst of steam, then with a crack and a splinter, the knight falls from the ice wall.\n-Thud!\nThe knight and horse land on the ground, just barely, before Leon catches them but it took a few seconds before he came to his senses.\n“Ugh…!”\nThe helmet flashed up and the knight swung his sword in an instant.\n“Die, you scoundrel! Die!”\nLeon’s holy sword blocked the knight’s blade and the knight’s eyes widened.\n“Your majesty?!”\n“I’m glad to see you’re healthy.”\n“Your Majesty!”\nThe red knight falls to his knees, stunned to realize that he swung his sword at Leon.\n“Yes, my name is Leon Dragonia Lionheart, King of Lionheart.”\n“Yes… I am Lord Laihar Dever, Third Sword of the Knights of the Baltan Flaming Sword!”\n“Lord Laihar, do you know your current status, and how far back do you remember?”\n“Ummm….”\nLaihar searched his memory for a moment before revealing the most recent information he could remember.\n“We were fighting the Glacial Archduke and his legions on the Plains of Randolce, chasing him as he opened the Demon Gate and fled!”\nIt was over two hundred years ago, when the Legions of Vulcanus and the Legions of the Glacial Archduke clashed on the Plains of Randolce.\nHaving won the fight, Vulcanus and his knights chased the fleeing Archduke inside the Demon Gate to finish him off, slaughtering demons in the process, at which point he lost his memory.\n“Lord Laihar, I need to ask you something.”\n“……With your great power of dreams and death, who are you, Lady?”\n“I am Beatrice Alighieri Spero, Queen of the Kingdom of Spero and current High Priestess of Dreams and Death.”\n“The Kingdom of Spero?”\nCatching Leon’s eye as he tilted his head at the unheard-of name of the kingdom, Laihar put on his best polite face.\n“You are the queen, and you are also a saint, so you are certainly not a stranger.”\nAfter Laihar bowed, Beatrice finished her question.\n“When your lordship arrived in this land, was it filled with ice like this?”\n“No. It was a desolate land, but not with glaciers like these.”\n“I see.”\n“What have you found out, Beatrice?”\nAt Leon’s question, Beatrice told him her theory.\n“It seems that this continent was artificially created by a demon, and Lord Vulcanus and his knights were caught in it and frozen.”\n“Hmm…Do you think a Lord-level demon was involved?”\n“If a demon of that caliber was involved, he’d rather take down Lord Vulcanus, but if it’s the Glacial Archduke…….”\n“I see, so he froze space and time for this entire continent when he ran out of power.”\nIt doesn’t seem impossible if the Demon Archduke was willing to throw everything he had at it.\n“This world is their world, a land of pure, unadulterated magic that doesn’t need to be tainted with miasma. They could perform miracles here and maybe… just maybe… Glacier Archduke is still alive.”\nIn other words, if the knights melted the ice wall where they were buried, they might come face to face with the Glacier Archduke.\n“No problem. I wouldn’t be here if I was afraid of that.”\n────!!\nAt that moment, a peculiar sound rumbled through the space, which no one could fail to recognize as a precursor to the summoning of the Gate.\n“Your Majesty, it’s the demons.”\nBeatrice pointed to about five hundred meters from the ice wall where hundreds of demons poured out of the open gate there.\n“They’ve noticed.”\n“They’re here sooner than I thought. Is there some kind of base that keeps an eye on this place?”\nBeatrice felt embarrassed.\nShe couldn’t use magic at the moment and to open the gate in this frigid land that freezes even space and time, she would have to channel her own magic power.\n“Your Majesty must also melt the ice wall and rescue the knights and Sir Vulcanus, and you can count on…….”\nLaihar Dever, a member of the Knights of the Flaming Sword of Baltan.\n“Lord Laihar!”\n“Yes, Your Majesty.”\n“One minute.”\nIt sounded like a suicide order to Beatrice since the enemy outnumbered them by a few hundred and the power difference was overwhelming.\n“Understood.”\nBut the knight merely fixes his helmet and heads for the front. He took up his sword and shield and left the two behind.\n“Your Majesty…….”\n“Trust and watch.”\nWith those words, Leon headed for the ice wall, while the demons opened fire on Laihar.\nThe demons were surprisingly high-powered.\nTheir weaponry is beyond the comprehension of modern Earth, and magic is their mastery.\nNaturally, martial science has advanced, and the machetes wielded by the lowest demons can bring down even giants.\n-Fire!\n-Three! Two! One! Power shot!\nThe first to be fired is a giant mahogany horse drawn by the demons of sloth. Fired by consuming magic stones, it could tear apart a modern Earth warship in a single blow.\n-Boom!\nWith a dizzying roar, the cannonballs formed a parabola but thanks to the gunner’s skill, it went straight and headed straight for Laihar.\n“With these toys…….”\nHe threw up his hands in annoyance and his bare fist struck the flying projectile with precision.\n-Bang!\nThe bouncing projectile slams into the ice wall and the ice wall, which would never have been able to be broken by projectile strength alone, was pierced like a stone by the added force of his blow.\n-Ki, knight…….\nThe Knights of Realm are those who have proven themselves in all aspects.\nOnly the most veteran of them, those who possess not only a mastery of the Holy Law but also phenomenal strength and mobility, become Holy Knights.\n“I shall return the favor.”\nLaihar grabs a fallen ice cube and his arm flexes like a baseball player throwing a pitch.\n-Boom!\nThe thrown ice projectile slices through the air, cutting through the air for hundreds of meters.\nIt pierced through the demons’ armor in a straight line, stopping only after shattering their armor.\n-Crazy…….\nHoly Knights are the chosen members of the Holy Grail superhuman army and they are the definition of ‘strong’.\n-Charge!\nThe demons charge in unison.\n“Third Sword of the Baltan Flaming Knights.”\nA sword is drawn from the Red Knight’s scabbard. His stellar iron blade is crimson, as if compressed with searing flames.\n“Laihar Dever.”\nIn an instant, a fiery whirlwind engulfed the Starblade.\n* * * *\nLeaving the cleanup to Laihar Dever, Leon examined the ice wall.\nThe ice wall is massive and solid and there was no way to effectively melt it without the Holy Law.\n“I’ll have to melt it all at once.”\nLeon had a way to melt this ice wall but then came the problem.\n‘If I do that, the waves will be too much to handle.’\nThis is a big ice wall and if he melted it all at once, a tsunami of waves would come crashing down on them.\nEven if Lord Laihar can hold out, Beatrice, who is using all her magic to open the gate, will be swept away.\n‘I can control the water by using the wave spell.’\nThe problem is, if he’s going to use a Holy Law that can melt an ice wall of this size, and then use another one to control the water, he won’t have the energy to follow it up.\nHe can do it, but he can’t waste his holy power as recklessly as he used to, so he has to be careful.\n“No, I have people I can trust.”\nLeon knows who they are. What he can do, they can do.\n“Holy sword.”\nFrom the subspace, the Holy Sword emerges from its sheath.\nIt takes a great deal of power just to summon it, and it appears before Leon.\nHe channels his power into the holy sword drawn from the scabbard of the first Lionheart King.\nThe flames of Petos envelop it and the holy sword’s brilliance shines in all directions.\nHe has one wish for the holy sword.\n‘Cut down all winter before me.’\nHe swings the blazing pillar of fire.\nThe plane plummets toward the ice wall with the contradiction of its own weight.\n────■■■■■■■■!!\nThe ice wall collapses upon impact with the fireball.\nAs it melted, the evaporated water vapor rose as steam. And then──\n-Kaaaaaah!!!\nThe unevaporated water pours out in waves. It would sweep away not only the demons but also the allies.\n“Should we stop here?”\nAfter retracting his holy sword into subspace, Leon continued to use the power of the sea and waves.\nHoly Technique <Wave Strike>\nThe enormous mass that seemed to be about to turn everything into a sea stopped. It unnaturally stopped in midair, just as Leon wished, using the power of the waves.\nSome might call it foolhardy.\nWhy would he expend his power to block a wave when he could sweep away hundreds or thousands of demons at the cost of one ally?\nBut Leon’s gaze is drawn beyond the stilled waves, where he hears the sound of horses’ hooves, a sound that cannot come from the center of tens of thousands of tons of water.\n“The Baltan Flaming Sword Knights.”\nThe Lionheart King commanded them and those who had broken free of the two-hundred-year seal and would face anything.\n“Destroy the enemy.”\nWithout hesitation, the Knights respond.\n“”Atrocity!””\n“”Atrocity!””\n“”Atrocity!””\nFlames rise from their breath, leaving a horseshoe-shaped trail of sparks in the center of the room.\n“”Merciless death…!””\nThe Templars burst from their long seals.\nThe flame-forged riders of the War God resume the battle they left unfinished two centuries ago.",

      "content": "Chapter 157: Holy Knight Vulcanus (1)\nStanding back from the battlefield and watching the battle, Beatrice couldn’t help but be impressed.\nStrong.\nPurely strong.\nShe couldn’t help but think so as she watched the Flaming Sword Knights.\nShe had seen the last battle of the Lionheart Kingdom. She had fought alongside them, and there were Holy Knights among them, and Templars who followed them.\nBut she hadn’t kept a close eye on them since she could only hold her ground in the middle of a war of such magnitude.\nIt would be the first time she would ever see the Holy Knights in combat this close.\n‘Can we even call this a battle?’\nA huge knight in heavy armor swung his flaming sword and with that simple act demons died in droves.\nWhat the demons feared most was their breakthrough.\nLegion Technique <Wedge Charge>\nA group formation technique used by the mounted troops of the Realm Knights as a basic skill.\nAs long as they are human, as long as they do not exceed human size, they will break through the heavy mass of the enemy as if they were exempt from the laws of physics.\n-Reinforcements!\n-Come on! Help!\nDemons continued to pour in through the Demon Gate, their numbers increasing by the hundreds with each passing hour.\nThe number of demons has already exceeded four thousand. But──\n“We, the war horsemen of Petos, have sworn an arduous march toward the Hill of Fire!”\n“Through countless battles, sometimes victorious, sometimes defeated…!”\n“With a heart of fire that will not be quenched!”\n“Willing to run to the death…!”\n“”War shall lead us to the banquet table!””\nThe Flaming Sword Knights, on the other hand, numbered barely fifty but demons crumbled before their frenzied violence.\nAs the mountains of corpses pile up and the wails of souls ring out, they are forced to retreat, even with a hundred times their numbers.\n-Do not retreat! Advance!\nEven the demons ordering the advance.\n“No mercy!”\n“Kill them all!”\n-Monsters, monsters! Run! Retreat!\nDemons shouting retreat.\n“No prisoners!”\n“”Kill them all!”\nThey grant death equally like angels of death.\nIt’s a rare sight to see demons cower in the face of such unbridled, ferocious violence.\nRuthless violence washed away the stains of evil. They were advancing when──\n-Velotas! Velotas!\n-Velotas! Velotas!\nThe mood in the rear transformed.\nThe fleeing demons let out a cheer and stopped running.\n[Alas… they woke up after all]\nIt was an Archdemon with an enormous bulk.\nThe possessor of a terrible magic power that made one feel disgusted and turn away just by looking at it.\nIts snow-white skin was chilling, and the breath it exhaled merged with the cold of the glacial continent to form absolute zero.\nAn Archdemon of sloth and idleness, an adaptor of the cold continent and the only being on this glacial continent that can move without restraint.\n-Cold Velotas!\nArchdemon Velotas has personally led his legions to the Ice Continent.\n“Tarhan! Fall back and regroup!”\n“Galatan! Maintain the flanks and reinforce the defenses at the front!”\nLaihar, the Third Sword of the Flaming Sword Knights, reorganized the Knights. They formed up in an orderly fashion, even though their horses could barely find a place amidst the piles of demon corpses.\n“Your Majesty, the Archdemon.”\nBeatrice glanced at Leon. Until now, she’d had to keep her magic in check, but now that the Archdemon and his legions had appeared, she or Leon would have to step up.\nBut Leon was holding back thousands of tons of water from the melting of the ice wall with his holy spell.\nBeatrice looks back at the Templars. She managed to keep her magic intact so far, but without Leon, they’d have to deal with the Archdemon on their own.\n‘I’m sure we’ll be able to work something out when His Majesty arrives…….’\nBut having wasted her magic, opening the gate and retreating would have to wait.\nAt the moment Beatrice made up her mind and Velotas shouted for the demons to advance-──\n-Currrrrrrr…!\nShaking the ground… no, the continent.\nSomething, something huge, is about to be unleashed.\n-……!!\n“”……!!””\nArchdemon Velotas unleashed the full force of his magic.\n-Bam…! Bam! Bam! Bam──Bam!\nA huge ice cube that was a kilometer in diameter formed in thin air. The Glacial Continent is a special continent, and Velotas’ magic power is amplified by more than ten times.\nThe half-melted ice crashed into the wall of ice, creating a dizzying crashing sound, but──\n-It’s too late…\nBut it was already too late…\nFragments of ice were splintering in real time, and from within something stretched out.\nIt’s a finger.\nThe fingers of a man reaching outward, crushing the pressure of thousands, no, tens of thousands of tons of ice.\n-What the… what the… what the hell!\n-Why is that bastard free!\nIn bewilderment and anger, the demons’ memories go back.\nThe monster that once invaded this world and the terrible disaster that left the Archduke dead in the flames of battle.\nThe Holy Knight whom the demons ultimately failed to subdue.\n“Heavy.”\nVelotas dropped the tons of ice that froze space and time.\nHe used the word ‘heavy’ to describe it.\n“I am Vulcanus.”\nThe saint’s voice flowed, his breath a flame and his actions a banner to the next war.\nAdvent────\n“I am Vulcanus…!!”\n────.\nFlame pours from his fingers, from the gaps in his armor, from the visor of his helmet… from his entire body.\nIt swallowed ice, evaporated water, and melted continents.\nIn three seconds, the flames stretched thirty kilometers in length and it took five seconds for a fire giant composed of nothing but fire to descend.\n-Ah, ah…….\nVelotas had witnessed the majesty of the Holy Knight’s descent into divinity, and even that was an outrageous monster.\nBut… this creature before him, the Archdemon understood, was far beyond that.\nIt was a miracle of the gods that the Archduke risked his life to bring down someone that challenged the demigods themselves.\n-Vanish!\nVelotas wove the magic of the half-melted glacial continent into his own. It was a massive maneuver that even Beatrice would be aghast at.\nThe miraculous maneuver of great magic that only he, the only blessed one on this glacial continent, could perform, dropped chunks of ice comparable to meteorites from the sky.\nTo use an analogy, Velotas’ ice magic is called a cannonball because its power is so great and vast but it’s even bigger than a shell.\nWould it really be defined as a ‘cannonball’ in the eyes of a giant so huge that even a kilometer-diameter cannonball would have to be squashed?\nVelotas witnessed the answer.\n“Death to evil.”\nSparks flew toward the hail of ice shells.\nThe flames pouring from the gaps in his armor were enough to melt continents and against such a giant, Velotas’ great magic is──\n“Die, scum.”\nA catapult thrown by a child, a mere provocation but this adult is not the least bit merciful.\nThe giant’s flames scorched the cold world thoroughly.\n* * * * *\nThe outcome of the battle need not be debated.\nThe legions led by Velotas, the Archdemon of sloth and idleness, were thoroughly crushed by the fifty Realm Knights and a single Holy Knight while the frozen continent, once frozen in time and space, was melted.\nThe Knights of the Flaming Sword rallied around a man who was a spark of God himself.\nUnder his influence, their armor blazed with overflowing flames.\n“Khhhhh…!”\n“Hot, hot, hot, it seems like it’s been a long time!”\nThe Flaming Sword Knights let go of their shields. It was a shield that didn’t miss even when the demons charged at them in unison.\nThey flashed their flaming swords and shouted like warriors worshiping a warrior god.\n“Butchers!”\n“Beheaders!”\n“Infidel slaughterers!”\n“Agent of Divine Punishment!”\n“Horseman of Doom!”\nAfter receiving the adoration and worship of all of them, Vulcanus turned to face Leon.\n“Lionheart King! I salute you, Leon Dragonia Lionheart…!”\n-Thud!\nThe giant being dropped to one knee. Thus, the Knights of the Flaming Sword give him the homage he deserves.\n“”All of the Knights of the Baltan Flaming Sword…! We offer the Heart of Fire to the Most Glorious Lionheart King!””\nAccepting the tribute from the mighty Holy Knight and his knights, the King smiles broadly.\n“I’m glad to see you still have some blood in your veins, though it’s nice to enjoy the sea after two hundred years.”\nLeon’s gaze traveled to where Vulcanus had been.\n-Ahhhhhh…!\nA monstrous beast with a massive presence pulses the air with rage, displaying its power.\n────!!!\nThat’s not all. Not only the demons that Vulcanus swept aside, but demons that have sensed the anomaly in the Glacial Continent are opening gates from all directions and leaping towards them.\n“Lord Vulcanus, which side will you take?”\n“I will cut my ties with him myself…!”\n“Then I’ll play the supporting role, not the lead. Make sure you take care of it.”\n“Hahahahahaha…!”\nVulcanus gripped his holy swords with a boisterous laugh.\n“Death to evil…!”\nIt was time to end the fight from two hundred years ago.\n* * * *\nIt had been ten days since gates had sprung up all over the world. In other words, gates that started Dungeon Breaks also existed.\n“Dungeon Break, evacuate quickly!”\nThe soldier’s urgent words sent the citizens fleeing in a panic, forcing them to climb an unmarked evacuation route.\n“Damn it, why didn’t we find it?!”\n“It must have been at the bottom of Chungju Lake. No, who knew that lakes could have gates?”\nOver the past ten days, the Hunters, commanded and controlled by Lord Yakt Spinner of the TTG Temple, had cleared most of the gates with perfect raid formations and methodical attacks.\nBut even with Yappy control, there were bound to be some gates they couldn’t find, due to too many magical reactions.\n“It seems that Europe and the United States have somehow managed to defend themselves.”\n“They say our defense was overwhelmingly successful. We only had three dungeon breaks.”\nHe shuddered to think what was like in other countries, especially continents with dozens of countries that don’t have the resources, or countries with backward systems.\nNormally, the United Nations or neighboring countries would send reinforcements, but they could barely deal with their issues.\n“Corporal Kim, we’re done with the evacuees, we should evacuate too…!”\n-Gahhhhhhhhhh…!\nAn ominous guttural sound was heard and everyone knew it couldn’t belong to an animal living in Earth’s ecosystem.\n“Monsters are emerging!”\nA monster that seemed to resemble a giant crocodile rushed fiercely towards the soldiers. The soldiers fired their rifles, but the rifles of infantrymen couldn’t even kill an entity of that size.\n“Uhhhhhh…!”\nThe first victim was about to appear.\n“Get down!”\nThe voice came from somewhere, and his ducking saved his life.\nDag-dag-dag-dag-dag!\nThey were knights on horseback, with a red-haired girl at their head.\n“Ha, Han Ha-ri!”\nLegion Technique <Wedge Charge>.\nThe knights charge at the monsters. They’ve just finished closing a gate nearby, and they’ve come as reinforcements!\n“Corporal Kim, are you okay!”\n“Ugh! I’m back from the dead! What are you doing?”\nCorporal Kim gripped his gun. His gaze turned to the Knights, who had already defeated the monster and were running toward the source of the Dungeon Break.\n“Let’s get the last of them and give them a little help!”\n“Bring all the armored vehicles! The artillery firepower is effective against monsters!”\n* * * * *\n-Chew!\nThe monsters screamed as the knights’ spears pierced them.\nThe situation was serious in the Chungju Lake Dungeon Break, where the Knights of the TTG Temple had arrived.\n-Crackle!\nThe thunder summoned by the Knight of Sky and Thunder, Kim Jae-hyuk, stunned the giant beast. He fixed his lightning-encrusted spear and said.\n“Senior Ha-ri, we’re running out of firepower! Please shoot some fire!”\n“Now, wait a minute, I’m at full strength too!”\nIn the past ten days, the Knights of the Ten Thousand Gods Temple had closed more than a dozen gates.\nThe reason why they were able to close the gates at such a high speed was because of the four Knights of the Ten Thousand Gods who were using the power of the holy artifacts.\nHan Ha-ri, Han Soo-ho, Kim Jae-hyuk, and Chun So-yeon.\nAside from the fact that they are outside Yappy standard, they inherited the holy relic from Isabelle, the High Priestess of the Moon and Purity, and each one of them is an S-class power.\nHa-ri, in particular, received the bracelet of waves left behind by Three Seas and Waves High Priestess, and the Heart of Fire left behind by the First War and Flame Holy Knight, making her stronger than the S-class.\n‘If only I had the approval of the Holy Grail!’\nThe bracelet has somehow lent her strength, but the Heart of Fire is the problem.\nAlthough she has become much more skilled with fire than before, this ferocious and tyrannical energy does not recognize her.\n“Senior Ha-ri, there’s danger over here, total danger, a boss monster has jumped out!”\n“Boss?!”\nDungeon Breaks literally spits out everything in the dungeon. As annoying as the miasma is, the last thing they want to see in a dungeon break is the dungeon boss.\n“Ugh… it’s big!”\nThe gate to Chungju Lake is rated orange, and the boss monster that emerges from it is a giant snake that requires you to look up until your head hurts.\n“Is this, like, an Imugi (dragon) or something?”\n“Whatever it is, it’s serious…….”\nShe whined, but she couldn’t give up so Ha-ri raised her Star Iron Sword and unleashed a blast of flame.\n“Aaaahhh! Lord Petos…!”\nThe power and prayer would soon be transformed into flames. With that, somehow──\n[Oh, no, this guy? Oh, no, I can’t, I’ve spent all my power!]\n-Pooh!\nPetos’ panicked voice aside, the flame that Ha-ri was about to swing went out with a whoosh.\n“……?”\nThe flame went out and it wasn’t just Ha-ri.\n-Hey! Why is it suddenly stopping?\n-No, no, no! The fire just died! There’s no flame!\n-What, what! Petos? Petos?!\n-Switch to Arianna’s power! Damn, it wasn’t just him!\nPetos worshippers across the country, dedicated to the god of war and flame, were in a panic.\n“What the hell is going on?”\nHa-ri desperately sought out Petos, but the God of War seemed too busy to answer.",

      "content": "Chapter 158: Holy Knight Vulcanus (2)\nMore than 200 years ago, on the plains of Randolce in the Lionheart Kingdom.\nThere, the Demon Legion, led by Archduke Glacier, clashed with the Knights of the Burning Sword and their allies, led by Vulcanus.\nThey were outnumbered ten to one and everyone expected the demons victory. But──\n“I am Vulcanus…!”\nHe was the embodiment of irresistible, overwhelming violence.\nThe strongest Holy Knight, who had been given two holy swords by the Blacksmith’s Holy Knight with great care.\nWith each swing of his one-handed greatsword, waves of fire covered the battlefield, cremating demons in a flame that left no ashes behind.\n-Strong.\nThe Glacial Archduke acknowledged his strength and that he was the second strongest Holy Knight next to the Lionheart King.\n-I admit it. You’re stronger!\nArchduke Glacier opened the Demon Gate.\nIn this united front to destroy the Holy Kingdom of Lionheart, he is the supreme commander representing the demons of sloth and idleness.\nHis absence would tear a hole in the coalition and give up the souls of the Holy Knights, promised as spoils in a war already won…….\n-Survival comes before loot.\nArchduke Glacier was very wise, and made a much more sensible choice than the rest of the Demon Legion, who remained to consider the sunk costs of losing their later Lord of Wisdom.\nOnly──\n“Where are you running……!!!”\nIt was just that the Holy Knight he was dealing with was extremely irrational.\nHe had opened the Demon Gate, taking only a handful of Archdemons and elites with him, and retreated to his estate.\nMagul was the home base of the Demon Archduke of Sloth and Idleness.\nThat’s where Vulcanus and his knights chased them down before the Demon Gate closed!\n-Madman, this is my territory!\n“No…!”\nThe flames pouring from the Holy Knight’s armor intensified. It burned through the surrounding magick, dyeing the sky red.\n“This place, that place, this place, that place, all the land of the gods!”\nVulcanus along with his knights and the demons of sloth and idleness that had retreated continued the battle.\nBut was the momentum of the battle? Or was it that Vulcanus was simply too powerful?\nHigh-level demons were being slaughtered, Archdemons were being broken through, and Vulcanus’ sword was being swung at the Glacial Archduke…\n“A human…! I have to gamble with my soul on a human!”\nArchduke Glacier unleashed his last great magic by combining all of his magic power to freeze space and time.\nThis freezing of space and time was an absolute binding that even a Lord-level demon could not break. In other words, no external force could break it, and he himself would be trapped……….\n“As time passes, he will lose his connection to the gods, and I will regain my power!\nThis is the Demon Realm, the domain of the Demon Overlord. On the day the seal is broken, he will be greeted by a vast army of demons, and he and his few tin foil hats will be swallowed up by a tidal wave of evil.\n-Thud!\n[Finally…!]\nGlacial Archduke Kadsha sensed the loose seal and opened his eyes.\nAlthough he had only been fighting Vulcanus a moment ago, a great deal of time must have passed.\n[The time has come to avenge my humiliation, Knight of the Gods, for I, Archduke Glacier, will…!]\nRaising his massive body, Archduke Glacier, snow giant Kadsha looked at his strangely ‘hot’ skin and the red sky, puzzled.\nEven though the magic had been released after a thousand years, it was still a great magic that could freeze the continent.\nIts traces alone should have created a tremendous cold snap, so why is it so hot and…….\nThe white giant’s gaze fell to the ground below, where a vast amount of water was evaporating in real time, creating a steam sauna.\n‘I wonder if he woke up with me.’\nThis is getting annoying. I can’t believe he had this much energy left after being disconnected from his god for so long.\nBut it doesn’t matter, they must have summoned his legions when the seal was broken, and he must have been weakened during the seal.\nUnless the Grail Guardian, the monstrous creature that killed Malus, the Lord of Chaos, come, there’s no way to bow to him-\nBlond hair, blue eyes, a handsome man, perhaps even a stereotype, but the demons who saw his face couldn’t forget the image that was burned into their minds.\n“To the Lionheart…! Glory be!”\nThe otherworldly Lionheart King who had killed the Chaos Lord and slaughtered millions of demons.\n[Why…!?]\nArchduke Glacier couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw the Lionheart King in front of him.\nThis is the Demon Realm. Even though it was tainted by the overwhelming flames of holy power, the miasma that filled the world was unmistakably the one he knew.\nBut why? Why is the Lionheart King here?\n[You… are alive!]\nLeon tilted his head at the Archduke Glacier shout.\n“This is the first time I’ve met a demon who hasn’t received the latest information. For two hundred years, they’ve been cowering in fear in my presence.”\nTwo hundred years? Two hundred years since he was sealed?\n[It can’t be! The Lord of Wisdom had ten million troops! There’s no way you guys could have survived──!]\n“Shut up, evil creature…!”\nVulcanus shouted in anger and struck the Glacial Archduke with Petos’ flashing holy sword.\nVulcanus crushed the Glacial Archduke with a blast of infinite flame.\n“Do not mention Lionheart with that filthy mouth of yours. Don’t you dare defile my lord and my ears!”\n[You…! On the subject of savage tin cans…!]\nArchduke Glacier unleashed an immense amount of magic power. Although the area has been purified by the sanctification, it is still strictly the demon realm.\nHis power connects to the world and presses against Vulcanus.\nThe demons gathered, one after another, with a massive presence. The great demonic forces triggered by Velotas death have been observed, and they are rushing to the continent.\n“Even as we speak…the demons are coming. Hurry, Lord Vulcanus, we must get out of here quickly.”\n“Death to evil…!”\nLeaving Vulcanus behind, who was already engaged in combat with the Glacial Archduke, Leon chuckled at the gathering demons.\n“Knights of the Baltan Flaming Sword.”\nLeon said to the fifty knights.\n“Follow me.”\n──Then shall we be victorious.\n* * * * *\n–Crack, crack!\nThe world freezes.\nA great spear of ice is formed from the moisture in the air, and it rushed in like a dizzying storm of ice caps──\n“Grrrrrrrrrrrr!!!”\nFor the Red Knight, whose breath is a burning flame, evaporating the flying spear of ice is a matter of course.\n[────!!]\nKadsha, the Glacial Archduke, was in awe.\nThe Demon Realm is more than just a place to live, it’s their foundation, their source.\nFor demons with estates, their home grounds are fortresses that repel the thieves who seek them out.\nBy the time they reach the age of lords and archdukes, they’ve been defending it for tens or hundreds of millions of years. It’s not an exaggeration to say that the manor itself has been assimilated by the demon and become its own body.\nOf course, in the case of Glacial Archduke Kadsha, he had expended a great deal of energy to perfect a space-time magic in this estate that even a Lord could not touch in order to seal the Red Knight who was trying to kill him.\nIn other words──\n[C’mon…! Stop your footsteps, you monster…!]\nThis means that even two hundred years ago, Kadsha was unable to repel that knight from his estate.\nNumerous great spells are completed in an instant. The Demon Archduke, wielding the power of the realm, could unleash any number of magic spells he wanted, but none of them could stop that knight.\n“Ignorant bastard, wasting power like that!”\nThere’s a limit to the amount of power a human can hold, and yet he poured it out as if he were a god himself.\nGrand Technique <Crimson Meteor>\nVulcanus unleashes a frenzy of power that makes the demons scream.\nAs it leaps, it looks like a meteor rising backwards into the sky, and when it finally reaches the end of the universe-─\n“Die, demon…!”\nIt fell with gravitational acceleration, aiming for planetary entry.\n[Ouch…!]\nKadsha recalled the same memory from just a moment ago when a legion was swept away by that nonsense.\nHe’s a knight that doesn’t use horses, a ridiculous man who can travel between continents, so unless he’s joining the other Knights, he doesn’t even use transportation!\n[Don’t think I’m going to get caught twice!]\nWith the Power of the Realm the Archduke can channel and manifest directed magical power.\nHe is both a warrior and an archmage. He may not be the Lord of Wisdom, but his magic is no less than the miracles of the Holy Law!\n[A mere mortal making me unleash Great Magic twice!]\nHe draws upon the power of the realm and unleashes an energy-draining Great Magic.\nIt even saved Kadsha from the brink of death two hundred years ago.\n[Frozen in time and space…!]\nWith the help of the realm, magic is manifested in the line of the meteor.\nA miracle that could be called ‘magic’, such as freezing space and time, was limited to Vulcanus himself.\nNo human vessel can resist it, not even the Demon Archduke himself!\n-Pow!\nSpace freezes and the meteor that was hurtling toward Kadsha stopped when it was three hundred meters away from him.\nIf it weren’t for the blowing snow and roaring flames, one would have thought that time had stopped.\n[Ha, hot…! Did it stop?]\nThis is not a force that can be countered from the front. Even the most powerful Holy Knights were doomed once they were caught.\n[I need to merge with the Legion before the Lionheart King can help──]\nSuddenly, he looks up and sees Vulcanus frozen in space and holding a holy sword.\n[One sword?]\nWhere did the other one go?\nJust then, a holy sword falls from the crimson sky. The flame, compressed to the limit of Petos’ power, is like the fury of a god about to unleash heavenly punishment on the earth.\nIt lands precisely where it froze space and time.\n[Thrown from orbit!]\nKadsha was not the only one who would not be caught twice. Vulcanus has also found a way to deal with the magic he was struck 200 years ago!\n[Vulcanus’ Holy Sword – War God’s Flame!]\nThe holy sword pierced through the frozen space-time with a compressed flame──\n“Grrrrrrrrrrrr…!”\nJust as Leon had done, Vulcanus evaporated the frozen space on his own, and the meteor’s acceleration did not decrease.\n[…Stop it!]\nKadsha summons a massive wall of ice, that became a huge shield and blocked Vulcanus, but──\n-Ka-ching!\nThe ice wall was literally destroyed by a single blow as if an all-piercing spear had pierced through the shield.\n[Vulcanus…!]\nThe same development repeats itself.\nNo, not the same. Any hopes that such a ridiculous display of holy prowess could have left him with anything left to spare were shattered by the merciless violence as Vulcanus’ advance continues unabated.\n‘This cannot be!’\nThe Lionhearted King is the proxy for all the gods.\nThe Chaos Lord was defeated by the Lionheart, and so were the other lords who could not defeat him in the end.\nHe might have had an excuse for losing against the gods representative but the monster in front of him, expending such vast amounts of energy, pummeling him so ignorantly…The Demon Archduke is defeated by an ‘individual’?\n[This cannot be!]\nVulcanus declared, evaporating the freeze that now seemed to have overtaken common sense beyond anger.\n“You arrogant scum of the earth, the end of your era will be brought down by your arrogance!”\nKadsha, frozen for two hundred years, does not know that the pinnacle of the ages has already crushed the waves of the Great Sea that seemed unreachable.\nA demigod, an agent of the divine, has done so and the exalted fighter reversed the malignity of destruction.\nHow arrogant to think that miracle, that feat, could not be accomplished by another.\n-Crack!\nThe final shattering blow was like a meteor from the apocalyptic orbit that had so easily consumed everything in its path.\nThe unfinished battle of two hundred years ago has finally come to an end.",

      "content": "Chapter 159: Holy Knight Vulcanus (3)\nAfter Leon opened the gate to the Demon Realm with Beatrice, the gate was guarded by the Association.\nThe gate that Beatrice opened doesn’t produce magic stones or dungeon breaks, but if Leon were to come out, he would need to be informed of the situation in Korea.\n“Chief Kim, it’s almost time to change shifts.”\n“Is it already?”\nKim Jin-soo glanced at his watch at his subordinate’s words. He flicked his cigarette into a portable ashtray and fiddled with his cell phone.\n“By the way, Chief Kim, one of the deputies was crying on Dantok, did you see it?”\n“Ha-ri? Why?”\n“All of a sudden, the God of War and Flame powers were disabled.”\n“Huh? Really?”\nSince the landing of the Wandering Magic Sword in Japan, the belief in the Ten Thousand Gods has spread rapidly in both Japan and Korea.\nKim Jin-soo had recently become a follower of Arianna, the goddess of light and justice, and he had learned the holy laws, so it was rather awkward to hear that the holy laws were ‘not working’.\n“The gods don’t take away favors.”\n“It’s not just one deputy, it’s the other God War believers as well. The connection is still there, it’s just the Holy Law that’s not working.”\nThat was definitely a first. Among the growing number of Holy Law users in the country, the most of them are followers of the god Petos.\nNot surprisingly, they’re mostly hunters and soldiers who have to attack gates.\n“That sounds like a lot of work, but don’t those who worship the God of War usually also worship the Goddess of Justice?”\n“It is said that faith in light and justice are the basic qualities of a warrior.”\nThen why was only the war god’s power taken? Kim Jin-soo thought of something.\n“That’s because the Holy Knights share holy power with the gods.”\nThat was the reason why Holy Knights’ power was ridiculously higher than normal knights.\nBorrowing power and sharing power were two different things.\n“You mean King Leon?”\n“No, he’s different. The Grail Guardian said he could use any power and transform it as needed.”\nThe Grail Guardian, unlike the Holy Knights, is a representative of all the gods. They have access to all of the faith that the gods have gathered through the Lionheart.\nIf Leon had drawn so much holy power that he was unable to use the Holy Laws, then all the Holy Laws would be unavailable, not just those of Petos.\n“Ugh… What the hell happened?”\nProbably it was because the king opened the gate and disappeared.\n‘That’s dangerous… Dungeon Breaks are about to explode all over the place while the TTG Temple’s maximized power wanes.’\nThe team was having a hard time dealing with this massive gate situation.\nThere are not enough ‘helicopters’ to deal with gates in remote areas.\n‘There is still no news about the red gate in Seongnam.’\nI had no idea that the existence of TTG Temple, which clears gates indiscriminately without economic calculation, was so great.\nIn particular, the presence of Leon and Beatrice, who are beyond S-class power, is a power that is desperately needed right now.\n‘Please return quickly, Your Majesty…!’\nChief Kim Jin-soo prayed that he would return as soon as possible and was about to contact the higher-ups of the Association in frustration when he received a message──\n────!!!\nThe gate had been opened from the other side and a searing heat escaped from the place.\n“It’s His Majesty!”\nKim Jin-soo and the association’s staff automatically kneeled down on one knee to greet the king.\nThey had already received enough lessons in etiquette to satisfy even Leon.\n“To His Majesty the Lionheart, Sir──!”\nBoom!\nSomething bounced out of the gate and realizing that it was the head of a creature, Kim Jin-soo glanced at it.\n“Oh…….”\nIt was an amazing head, endlessly evil, not like the field boss of the gate and he felt that if he made eye contact with it, he would die of a curse.\n“You can just go in there.”\n“Sorry, your Majesty, I thought it might actually lead to another world.”\nJust then, a group of people emerge from the gate. The Association employees were delighted to see Leon and Beatrice, but soon stopped at the sight of the armored hordes that came with them.\nThey felt crushed by the mere sight of them and instinctively realized that these are dangerous beings.\nEveryone realized that the hulking knight next to Leon was of a different class.\n“Your Majesty!”\nChief Kim Jin-soo steps forward on behalf of his subordinates. Leon recognized him and returned the greeting.\n“You must be Chief Kim.”\n“Yes!”\n“Ah, yes. That head, keep it. It’s loot that needs to be used.”\n“What the hell is that…….?”\n“It is the head of the Glacier Archduke.”\n“Huh…!”\nThe Glacier Archduke? You mean the Demon Archduke? The gate Leon said he went through was in the Demon Realm, and he killed a Demon Archduke there?\n“Oh, King Lionheart…….”\nI’ll only believe in your Majesty!\nThe envious glances of Director Kim Jin-soo and the Association staff gathered but Leon took the stares directed at him for granted.\n“By the way, what’s all the fuss about?”\nBeatrice asked, puzzled by the guild members who still hadn’t greeted them.\n“Yes, it’s…….”\nKim Jin-soo reported about the absent Templars and Man-At-Arms, as well as Yappy, who was in charge of the Korean Hunters.\n“I see. What’s urgent now?”\n“……!”\nChief Kim exclaimed.\n* * * *\nAfter the massive gate incident, the Korean Hunters raiding parties, led by Yakt Spinner, quickly attacked the gates.\nThe gates that were selected and combined by the strong artificial intelligence were categorized and prioritized by the raiders.\nAfter capturing the gate, the ROK military helicopters were deployed to move quickly.\nSome in the chain of command wondered if it was giving too much power to a machine, but they were left speechless by Yappy’s discernment, which soon began to prove itself.\nYappy’s thoroughness allowed it to make real-time adjustments to the movement of the raiders based on data, coordinates, movement history, and calculated threats.\nHis command skills aside, it was impossible for him to respond in time to gates popping up all over the country.\nGate capture is not something that can be accomplished in a day or two. It usually takes four to five days for a properly-ranked raiding team to capture a gate.\n400 gates appeared in Korea in 10 days and even if hunters organize raid teams from scratch, there are more than a dozen ‘dungeon breaks’ due to failed raids, tight schedules, and abnormal gates.\n“Palace lord…! I can’t take it anymore!”\nGyeongbu Highway Gate, summoned in the middle of the highway, was the gate that Yappy had ordered to be attacked first.\nIt was a yellow-ranked gate, so it had been a week since the second group under the Hanbit Palace had entered. They thought they would be able to complete the assault easily, but they failed miserably.\n“So it’s a fluctuating gate…….”\nYes, it is. This light highway gate is a fluctuation gate disguised as a yellow gate but the estimated attack rating is red.\nNormally, they would have responded immediately, but their guild leader, Park Yong-shin, had captured two yellow gates in Wando in quick succession.\nYong-wan’s Firebird Guild and Hunter Association leader Oh Kang-hyuk, who had volunteered to join the raiding party at Hanbit Palace, rallied as reserves to stop the dungeon brakes.\n“Brother Lee Yong-wan, we can’t block the entrance anymore, there are too many large objects!”\n“Damn it… Our boys are tired too, Mr. Association President, let’s pull back and reorganize our formation. I don’t think it’s time to worry about miasma pollution!”\nPark Yong-shin, Lee Yong-wan, and Oh Kang-hyuk were the only three S-class Hunters, but even so, they couldn’t stop the waves of monsters coming out of the fluctuation gate.\n“If I had known it would be like this, I would have brought Yuri Yang!”\n“I should have brought the Deputy Palace Lord too.”\n“…….”\nOh Kang-hyuk swallowed hard and kept his eyes on the monsters pouring out of the broken gate.\nThey are so short-staffed that he, the president of the association, has to go to the front lines himself. He had hoped to enlist the help of the Japanese Hunter’s Association, with whom he had recently strengthened ties, but the unprecedented outbreak of three red gates in a row made that impossible.\n‘That’s why Korea can afford it. Thanks to the troops he raised.’\nThe knights of the Ten Thousand Gods Temple are strong, but the most fearsome are the Man-At-Arms who have surpassed five thousand.\nThe D-ranked Hunters, who have been treated as baggage, have organized themselves into formations and are now as formidable as A-ranked raiders.\nTheir strength is in numbers. Under the tutelage of the Lionheart King, they have been thoroughly trained in group discipline and holy power.\nTheir power is multiplied when paired with a Knight Commander, who scatters commander-level buffs.\nIn Korea before TTG Temple, Dungeon Break would have been a disaster.\n‘But there’s still a big difference in power with and without him.’\nEven a Knight class can scatter Commander skill-level buffs, but Leon’s buffs are ridiculous.\nIt’s true that TTG Temple has gathered a lot of power, but that’s only a numerical advantage. The overwhelming quality advantage comes from the presence of the Lionheart King and the Holy Knights.\n“Tell the Hunters that I’ll break through the line myself.”\n“Mr. President?”\nPark Yong-shin and Lee Yong-wan’s eyes widened when they heard that the Association President was going to lead the charge himself.\n“I hope the boss monster is an easy one.”\nOh Kang-hyuk is a legendary Hunter in Korea. He’s defeated every single one of them, even the S-class bosses.\n-Kieieieieieieieieie…!\nWith a terrible roar, the last monster emerged from the gate.\n“Holy shit…….”\nA skull-masked mage, jet-black robes billowing in the air, a rotting staff of dead wood in his gnarled bony arms.\nIt was an Ark Lich, the worst of the S-class monsters, with Death Knights as its bodyguards, the finest of the undead.\n“Damn, an Ark Lich.”\nYong-wan gritted his teeth and let go of the arrow but physical attacks against this entity are halved in effectiveness.\n“Lord Park!”\n“What is it, brother?”\n“You’re King Lionheart’s faithful dog, don’t you know how to use the Holy Law?”\n“Dog… that’s too much for a sinner like me, I’m not even worthy to lick his paws.”\nHe’s actually happy here? Yong-wan was afraid of Park Yong-shin’s mentality.\n“Anyway, to answer your question, I can’t use the Holy Law. The gods don’t give their favor to sinners.”\n“Does this mean that a sociopath is a bigger sinner than an unbeliever? Damn…….”\nIt was a lost cause.\n“Since it’s like this, we need to cut down the escort power, those Death Knights alone are annoying!”\nThese Death Knights are worthy of being the boss of any gate. Even an A-ranked raiding party will not be safe if they collide with them head-on──\n“”Ravage the enemy…!””\nIt was at that moment that a group of anachronistic cavalry came out of nowhere.\nFor a moment, he thought it was the Knights of the TTG Temple, but their momentum was incomparable.\n“Red…Knights?”\n“Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!”\nFifty horses raced down the highway, led by the Lionheart King and a hulking knight.\nTheir speed is obviously strange and the highway stretched in a straight line, like a sports car with an overheated engine.\n[…….]\nThe Ark Lich puts up a dense barrier against the horde of horses that suddenly appeared behind him. His command group is reinforced by powerful magical powers and can withstand a head-on collision with a 20-ton truck.\nA bunch of anachronistic horses──\n“Glory to the Lionheart!!!”\n[Mighty Charge] is applied to the unit.\nAt the moment of the crash, something soars into the sky.\nWhen he realized that it was the corpse giant who had been wielding the club in the lead, the Lionheart King, holding the Holy Sword, appeared in front of him.\n[……!]\nThe Ark Lich flinched. Where the hell were his escorts, the Death Knights?\n“GRARARARARARA──!”\nThey were being torn apart by the screaming red knight with his unbelievable strength.\n“How dare you turn honorable knights into ghosts! Your sins are deep.”\n[You…!]\nA brilliantly shining holy sword dug into Ark Lich’s chest as he tried to manipulate magic.\n-Kuuk…!\nThe holy sword pierced through Ark Lich’s chest in a single blow.\n“Your Majesty, the Ark Lich has a Life Vessel that holds his soul! If we don’t destroy it, the Lich will die──”\nIt was then that the Ark Lich, who had been pierced by Leon’s holy sword, let out a terrible scream.\n“This king, agent of the gods, has commanded. Destroy the dead soul.”\nIt doesn’t matter if it has a Life Vessel that hides its soul or not. Even demons from across dimensions can be destroyed by the Knights of the Lionheart.\nNo mere undead wretch can escape their annihilating power!\n“Oh, no…!”\nIn the process of annihilating the soul, the Ark Lich unleashed a great magic that bordered on madness. He gathered all the corpses and formed them into a single mass that would self-destruct!\n“Die, fiend!”\nIn an instant, a fiery holy sword of terrible heat consumed the corpses and the flame of the God of War was so powerful that it left not even a soul behind, let alone a skeleton.\n“Ah, ah…….”\nDespairing in the face of overwhelming power, the Ark Lich crumbled to dust.\nWatching the scene, Park Yon-shin exclaimed in ecstasy.\n“King, be all-powerful…!”\n“”Long live the king…!””\nThe worshippers of the Hanbit Palace fell to their knees in worship. They weren’t the only ones, some of the Hunters joined in the worship.",

      "content": "Chapter 160: Temporary Break\nThe massive gate outbreak that swept across the country was put to rest by Leon’s return.\nLeon and Beatrice, who are unofficially classified as “out of spec” beyond being S-class hunters, and Vulcanus and his 50 knights, who are smashing through the gates at lightning speed.\n-Wow, what the hell is that?\n-The Holy Knights.\n-They smashed the red gate dungeon brakes and cleared three orange gates in one day.\n-There’s no other group of monsters like them in the world.\nIt’s like a hundred S-class Hunters have formed a super party…….\nTheir strength was beyond imagination. Usually, A-ranked raiders spend a week raiding and clearing an orange gate.\nThe Red Gate required an S-grade raid team with two S-grade Hunters and 50 veteran A-grade hunters.\nBut they just had overwhelming firepower and tactical ability…….\n-Holy Knight Vulcanus is a total badass, isn’t he?\n-A-class Field Boss is a one-shot kill. Crazy.\n-It’s an out-of-the-ordinary skill that connects the Lionheart King, Magician Queen, and Yakt Spinner.\n-They all belong to the TTG Temple.\n-Lol\nVulcanus, Holy Knight of War and Flame, a survivor of the same world as Leon, certainly made his presence felt as he slaughtered the monsters that jumped out of the dungeon break.\n“Awesome.”\nTakeda, the head of Japan’s New Hunter Association, was at the scene of the Red Gate Dungeon Break.\nThree Red Gates were summoned at the same time, an unprecedented event. The gates had been summoned from all over the country, and the hunters had been mobilized.\nHe managed to close one of the three, but failed to close the other two, forcing him to prepare for a dungeon break.\nHaving lost many S-class Hunters to the murderous Archduke Akasha, Japan was in need of foreign assistance, and turned to the TTG Temple, bound together by the bonds of the same faith……..\n[Your Majesty, we need reinforcements.]\nTakeda explained his country’s desperate situation. He frankly reported that three S-class Hunters had been wounded in the failed assault on the gate, and that their available power had become very low.\n[I’m not your fixer, what you can fix yourself, fix yourself.]\n[Your Majesty…….]\nLeon believed that Japan still had time to spare. Sure, it would be a lot of work, but they could handle the Dungeon Break, even with the damage.\nOver-involvement in other countries was not a good thing, and above all, the Lionheart King trained his knights and soldiers harshly.\nHe is a spiritualist who believes that people can only become stronger through trials and challenges.\nTherefore, he had no intention of sending reinforcements to the Japanese Dungeon Break…until Takeda complained in a weak voice.\n[The boss monster of the Demon Gate is an Archdemon──]\n-Thump, thump, thump!\n[Your Majesty?]\nTwo hours later, Leon and Vulcanus arrived on a Korean military transport plane along with the Flaming Sword Knights.\n“Demon spawn are in this land?”\n“Where are they, I’ll twist their heads off!”\nChairman Takeda and Japan’s Prime Minister Fujisawa struggled to get the knights, who ran like angry horses, to the gate where the dungeon brakes would burst open.\nAnd the slaughter began.\n“I saw it with my own eyes, but I still don’t believe it.”\n“It was on the scale of a major raiding party…….”\nOther hunters, as well as staff from the Japan Hunter Association who were analyzing the battle, seemed shocked by the strength of the Burning Sword Knights.\n“Their equipment is also incredible, and the appraisers say they’re outfitted with Legendary and above.”\n“That’s Yappy’s stellar armor.”\nTakeda had invested a lot of money in Yappy’s star iron factory.\nFrom what he heard, every Knight of the Ten Thousand Gods is issued a pair of god-blessed Star Iron Armor.\n“Those armor are supposed to be the originals. How much do you think they’re worth in terms of measurement?”\n“Legendary. They say each one is worth a year’s budget for a small town.”\n“That’s out of this world. Isn’t there a lot of inflation?”\n“That, too, but good equipment is no more amazing than combat power.”\nThe staffer seemed at a loss for words as he read the power analysis file of the Burning Sword Knights.\n“Every single one of them is at least quasi-S-class, and a dozen of them are above S-class average. And that’s just based on individual strength. If we move on to group combat evaluation, the S-class raiders won’t even compare.”\n“Crazy.”\n‘What kind of monstrous group was the Lionheart Kingdom?’\nEven though they fought together, there were at least five people in the Burning Sword Knights who were stronger than him, the top S-class hunter in Japan.\nAmong them, Count Laihar Dever, who was ranked third in the order, could easily take on two S-class Hunters.\n“Among such monsters, the pinnacle is the Holy Knight and Grail Guardian.”\n“Monsters….”\nTakeda shrugged at his subordinate’s point.\n“I didn’t mean it in a bad way.”\n“I’m aware of that, but the number of worshippers of the TTG Temple has increased significantly recently.”\nJapan may have been united with Korea, but it had the monumental distinction of being the first country in the world to defeat a demon Archduke.\nAfter the Wandering Demon Sword was revealed to be the Demon Archduke Akasha, and those who had witnessed Leon’s real-time demonstration of power were as likely to believe in the TTG Temple as anyone else.\nIn Japan, where there was no main religion to speak of, there was no faith to abandon, and the number of believers has already surpassed Korea’s and is approaching one million.\nThis is an unprecedented rate of growth in history, considering that TTG Temple is an emerging religion that has only been on the planet for a little over half a year.\n‘I hear it’s also hot in the Americas and Europe.’\nThe world is revolving around TTG Temple and after witnessing the recent events of the Gate and the power of the Archdemon class, Takeda was convinced that without them, the world would quickly collapse.\n“Let’s pledge our allegiance.”\n“Agreed.”\nHe heard that many Hunters have recently become devoted to the TTG Temple, so he thinks they should send their hunters there for religious training.\n* * * *\nThe third day after Leon’s return with Vulcanus.\nVulcanus and the Knights had successfully defeated the last assigned Dungeon Break, and were resting on the Mountain of Corpses.\n“Lord Laihar, there’s a living one over there.”\n-Ah, no…!\n“What’s wrong, you stupid green beast?”\nThe last dungeon break was the Orc Gate. As with the Demon Gate, the knights slaughtered the orcs thoroughly.\n“Your Majesty, all two thousand of the beasts have been exterminated!”\nVulcanus reported to Leon without even removing his heat-soaked armor and Leon offered him a piece of jerky from the mountain of corpses.\n“Hmm…!”\nVulcanus removed his red, horned helmet and revealed inside was a middle-aged man with a feral look.\n“It tastes good, but I don’t feel Goddess Demera’s favor.”\n“That is because our crops have not produced enough to feed the livestock farms. We have enough vegetables and grains, but not meat.”\n“Certainly. Holy power is lacking.”\nVulcanus raised his hand and summoned a spark of holy power. A dizzying pillar of fire rose from it.\nVulcanus shrugged his shoulders and cursed into the air.\n“Mr. Petos, why aren’t you as good as you used to be?”\n[You…!]\nPetos immediately became enraged. The God of War and Flame spoke to his Holy Knight with a sharp accent.\n[You’ve been so wasteful lately, releasing all the power you’ve accumulated like a dam bursting!]\nAs soon as he was freed from the ice, he wasted no time in unleashing his Divine Descent, but after three days of continuous battles, he ran out of energy and tore monsters apart with his bare hands.\nPetos had seen this happen before, and naturally, his scolding was directed at Leon.\n[Leon, my best war horseman, manage your men properly!]\nWhen Leon responded with a shrug, Vulcanus spoke up.\n“Mr. Petos, I am your best war horseman, am I not?”\n[I have never had a warrior like you. All you know how to do is punch and smash. What kind of war horseman is he who leaves command and strategy to his subordinates?]\nThe Riders of War and Flame are all-around warriors who master tactics and are responsible for the firepower of their legions.\nVulcanus is a bit of a lopsided example, and would not be recognized as a Holy Knight if it weren’t for his ridiculous strength.\n[At any rate, I should have stopped you when you said you were going to bring in a barbarian like that to edify him.\n“Do not be too hard on him, Petos, for his vessels were coveted even by savage demigods.”\n[…….]\nPetos had nothing more to say. Yes, the barbarian who was about to be awakened as a vessel for an evil god was subdued by Leon and brought to the Temple of All Gods.\nBut Petos knew what Vulcanus had done since then, and he couldn’t just berate him.\n“Lord Vulcanus, come here for a moment.”\n“Yes…!”\nLeon pulled a staff out of subspace as Vulcanus approached.\n“What is it?”\nVulcanus glares at the unusual holy power emanating from the staff and Leon explains the staff’s history.\n“It belonged to a prophet who refused to stop fighting, even in a land of evil. It was given to this king by a priest who served the gods of another dimension.”\n“Oh…such a connection.”\nLeon handed the staff to Vulcanus.\n“From what I can tell, the staff has the ability to absorb and store holy power, similar to the Lionheart.”\n“It doesn’t seem like much of an artifact, sir.”\n“Perhaps not, but it can absorb accumulated holy power. Offer it to the God of War.”\nIn short, Vulcanus was consuming too much power, so the power of the other gods would be stored in the staff, and Vulcanus would make a sacrifice to Petos to offset his power consumption.\nTaking Gob’s staff from Leon, Vulcanus chuckled and raised it.\n“Old man, here goes the staff.”\n[This guy.]\nFeeling like a crippled old man with a cane, Petos snatched it from Vulcanus’ hand.\n[You blasphemous thing, you’re going to pay big time one day.]\n“GRARARARARA…!!”\nIn any case, the matter was settled. There was the Man-At-Arms force sent to defend the lands of the Demera faithful abroad, but that too would come to an end.\n“But this, something about this reeks of evil.”\nBeatrice and the demons are the only ones who can use the gate at the moment, so this massive gate breach must have served some purpose.\n“We are returning. First, I must serve a feast to Lord Spinner and his men.”\n“Oh~, the mechanical Holy Knight your majesty has spoken so highly of, the successor to Lord Antoch, I would like to see his face once.”\n“I’m sure you’ll like him.”\nAutumn.\nThe gate crisis that had engulfed not only Korea, but the entire world, was coming to an end.\n* * * *\nSince arriving on Earth as a survivor, Beatrice had been steadily exposed to modern culture to familiarize herself with Earth’s civilization.\nSmartphones and PCs are one thing, but newspapers are her favorite.\nIt’s something she used in her kingdom, and it’s easier to read about current events than sensationalized internet news.\n“What a mess.”\nShe had been reading through the daily papers that had accumulated in her absence, but most of them were focused on the worldwide Gate crisis.\nA red gate in the middle of Paris, France, or a small town hit by a dungeon break and a coastline polluted after a failed attempt to capture the Dragon Palace Gate.\nThe world is reeling from the gate invasion, not all countries, of course.\n“Taiwan has managed to defend itself.”\nIsland nations, small land masses, and dense populations have been more successful in dealing with Gates.\n“It’s the whole continent that’s the most problematic. There’s a growing number of Demera worshipers in this part of the Granary, and we’ll have to pay more attention.\nYappy had already dispatched a force of Man-At-Arms to control the damage but it wouldn’t be enough.\nMoving the Burning Sword Knights would make things much easier, but that’s risky as it is.\n‘The continent is full of orcs…….’\nWhen two factions meet, they are bound to clash. Leon alone could tell.\nThere are still some orc survivors in Korea and seeing them, Leon didn’t go all out with his sword, but he did show his displeasure.\nThe beasts are staining his eyes.\nIf Sir Vulcanus and his knights encounter even an orc on the continent it’s very predictable how they will behave.\n[Taiwanese cabinet suspected of orgy party.]\n“Hmm?”\nA single line of the article suddenly caught her eye. It was not a rare occurrence.\nDrugs, sex, and parties. Promiscuous and decadent culture in high places is common in any country, in any world.\nBeatrice was a queen who was beyond repulsed by such things, but if it were just a scandal, she would have let it slide, however the problem is the key players in the scandal.\nThe CEO of a big business, the minister in charge of defense, and the children of key cabinet members.\nIt was a scandal involving people who, while controversial, could use their power to sway public opinion.\nIt was all too familiar, when suddenly, she noticed a symbol at the party that a reporter had photographed.\n“The coat of arms of……?”\nIt was the coat of arms of the fallen Archduke who turned the kingdom of Spero upside down.\nBeatrice, who had casually uttered the name of the sinister demonic archduke who had tainted the royal family, corrupted the nobility, and ultimately brought the kingdom to its knees, suddenly realized that her surroundings had gone pitch black.\n“You can’t be…!”\nNames have power.\nCalling a demon by its true name is a way to connect with them.\nBy spreading their name, demons gain contractors. Hence──\n[There you are]\n“You…!”\nIn the inky darkness, the demon connected to Beatrice greeted her.\n[Magician Queen.]",

      "content": "Chapter 161: A Knight’s Training\n– Increased threat to critical production assets. Troops must be dispatched.\nYappy, who had commanded the Korean Hunters to efficiently capture the gates, declared the protection of the growing number of TTG Temple assets overseas.\n-No, you’re actually sending some of your troops overseas at this point?\n-Korean Hunters have been mobilized to protect their country, isn’t that irresponsible!\nThese voices were raised, but Yappy dismissed their arguments as if they were obvious.\n-Get out of here, organism.\nThe Internet dictator was becoming more and more like a humane dictator in the real world, and his self-righteous, overbearing demeanor had them looking for the Lionheart King.\n‘Damn it, Lionheart, come back!’\n‘Someone take control of this killing machine!’\nThere was no compromise for the AI Holy Knight.\nI’ll do it if I have to, and why would a stupid organism question the strategic plan of a wise mastermind? This attitude drives me crazy inside.\nOf course, Yappy had good reason.\n-It’s harvest time for the overseas farms. It was necessary to capture the gate for food security.\n-But with only a handful of knights and Man-At-Arms, you’ll be limited.\n-There are other ways.\nIt didn’t take long for the overseas TTG Temple raiders to figure it out.\n“This is War Dog, calling from the Grave Arms PMC. Are you part of the TTG Temple contingent?”\n“This is Tom, Black Mamba’s boss, and he’s a pretty thick one.”\nGreeting the handful of knights and Man-At-Arms troops are two thousand Hunter mercenaries hired by Yappy. They were all B-class and above at the very least, including six S-class Hunters.\n‘How much money did he spend?’\nKoo Dae-Sung, a Knight who had volunteered for the overseas contingent, was aghast at the number of mercenaries Yappy had hired.\nAt the very least, there was an A-class raiding party and three S-class raiding parties. It must have cost trillions of dollars to hire this many people. Even if he had that kind of money, he wouldn’t be able to get a priority contract even if he wanted to hire them, as they would be sought after all over the world in the current times——.\n“Ah—!\nKoo Dae-sung looked at the items being unloaded from the transport they had come with and realized why they had been hired first.\nDrones that could operate in the gate, and enough stellar armor to arm hundreds of people, that’s enough to make any mercenary hunter drool.\nHigh-tech blessed weapons and stellar iron armor are not available, unless it’s a national defense contract and it’s not something a mercenary group can get.\n“Lord Yappy.”\nKoo Dae-sung, who was communicating with Yappy while reporting their arrival, asked cautiously.\n-Mr. Koo Dae-sung.\n“Are you sure it’s okay to leak these items without His Majesty’s permission?”\n– No problem. These items are classified as low-grade among the Blessed Armaments. The technological gap between the outside world and the TTG Temple is vast.\nIn other words, it shouldn’t be a problem to smuggle them out.\n-Our scouting assets will assist. Close the gates at this point quickly.\nYappy began to deploy his mercenaries and Man-At-Arms to defend the various granaries.\nHe sent troops to the Beidahuang Granary in the Heilongjiang People’s Republic, Chernozem in Ukraine, the Ganges River Plain in India, and Java in Indonesia, all in the name of protecting the worshippers of the TTG Temple in developing nations that had been neglecting land contaminated by miasma.\nThe countries welcomed the troops with open arms because they were already short on hunter power.\nA week later Koo Dae-Sung successfully completed his sixth raid in the Heilong People’s Republic.\n“Wow, we’re going to get some breathing room.”\nKim Do-han stretched out in the sunlight for the first time in two days.\n“So, roughly speaking, isn’t this a safe zone around here?”\n“I think so.”\nGudae Castle was a large-scale gate situation, but since most of the gates were yellow or green, the capture itself was not difficult.\nThe gates that were too difficult for the contingent to handle were taken care of by the mercenaries.\n-Good effort.\n“Ah, Lord Yappy.”\nYappy, who was communicating in real time via drone, praised the Man at Arms for finishing the gate.\n“Any more gates to take?”\n-No. All immediate threats have been eliminated. Gave them a vacation.\n“Oooh, a vacation!”\nCaptain Kim Do-han is thrilled to hear the word vacation and the rest of the Men at Arms were equally excited.\n-Deposited special bonuses into their bank accounts. In two days, a military transport plane would be sent to Heilong Airport to pick them up, and they could enjoy their vacation until then.\nKim Do-han, who immediately checked his smartphone to see how much money had been deposited, was ecstatic about the generous bonus and hugged Koo Dae-sung’s shoulder.\n“Let’s drink, Mr. Koo!”\n“Shall we?”\nThe two men, their faces fresh from their days as porters, headed into the city in high spirits.\nThe TTG Temple definitely trains soldiers and knights, but it’s a bit harsh on people.\nKoo Dae-sung, a former knight cadet, was especially hard on himself, and he was glad for the vacation.\n“It’s Mainland China after all, and the food is amazing!”\nThe Heilongjiang People’s Republic is one of more than 50 countries that have broken away from China since its collapse. Most of the country is grain land, so food was not a problem, since it was an agricultural, primary-industrialized country.\n“I haven’t been here since China broke up. It’s still pretty backward. Is the capital any better than here?”\n“I hear it’s not much different there.”\nIn Korea, even rural Naju has a few buildings standing tall. But here, despite the city’s reputation, there isn’t a single building taller than 10 stories.\n“Well, it can’t be helped, can it? After the Shanghai incident, the country was torn into 50 parts.”\nThe Shanghai incident.\nAfter the unleashing of the Archdemon Skazakari from the Black Gate in Shanghai, the once largest country in the world, Greater China, was completely shattered.\nThe country had been slowly dying after failing spectacularly to deal with the initial Gate outbreak and the Shanghai incident was just the final straw that drove the wedge.\n“Well, we just need to protect our own land, right?”\nAt Kim Do-han’s words, Koo Dae-sung thought, “I don’t know,” but he didn’t say it out loud.\n-The KMT decided to extend martial law.\nAt that moment, the restaurant’s TV flashed a state broadcast. With Yappy’s translator, they had no trouble understanding.\n“Martial law has been extended.”\n“An orc general.”\nOn the news, a decorated general was speaking about the gates, announcing that the mighty Hunter Legion was taking them down one by one.\n“This neighborhood is just a bunch of propaganda.”\nKoo Dae-sung and Kim Do-han looked around and saw no sign of the mighty Hunter Corps.\nEach of the 53 countries torn from the continent generally claimed legitimacy, each claiming to be the continent’s heir, but all they’ve inherited is their own corrupt administrative systems.\nIn the end, it’s the innocent civilians who suffer.\nKim Do-han was about to clink his glass when\n──────!!\na peculiar wave of magic power that awakened Hunters can feel was sensed. The two men jumped to their feet when they realized it was a dungeon break.\n“What the fuck?!”\n“Get your gear!”\nLeaving the alcohol and food behind, the two grabbed their equipment and hurried to the alleyway where their senses led them.\nFrom there, they heard a tearing scream.\n-Caahhhhhhhh!!!\nThe two exchanged a glance and entered the alleyway with shields and swords in hand. What they found was a girl running away from something and quadrupedal monsters chasing her.\nThere were at least ten of them and they were so large that they lined the alleyway, tackling each other in an attempt to eat the girl.\n“Come here!”\n-Hick!\nThe girl spotted the two of them and rushed over, panting. At the same time, a monster pounced on her.\n“Stop it!”\nKoo Dae-sung blocked the charging monster with his shield. Despite its weight, it was a simple beastly lunge and he immediately counterattacked by plunging his sword into its throat.\n-Quack!\nThe monster collapses in a single blow and it was a good thing for the old knight who can’t use the Holy Law.\n“Captain Kim, call the kids!”\n“No, I just called them! They’re all around here, so I told them to come except for the drunk one!”\nIt was a good thing this was the only city nearby with a nightlife.\nThe majority of the 200-odd deployed Men at Arms arrived in the slums one by one, and they formed a shield formation in the narrow alleyways, picking off the monsters one by one.\nAlong the way, Yappy’s hired local mercenaries arrived, and it was only an hour before the dungeon break was resolved. It would be another three hours before the city’s Heilong Hunters arrived.\n“It’s a mess.”\n“I know.”\nThere was a dungeon break in the middle of the city.\nThis was unthinkable in South Korea and when he asked how this happened, he was told that it was even worse.\n“Our observation lenses have a failure rate of over half.”\nThe mercenary captain who came as backup shrugged his shoulders but it didn’t make sense to Koo Dae-sung.\n“Is that so? Don’t we import them all from the US anyway?”\n“Poor management, cheap or second-hand replacements, embezzlement–that’s the usual stuff. That’s why we don’t trust the satellites. We’ll get a citizen’s complaint and show up.”\nThe mercenary captain concludes by saying that dungeon breaks are not uncommon in this country.\nHunters and their equipment cost a fortune, and in a country where every aspect of society is rotten with corruption, the Hunter’s Association should be no exception.\n“It’s a mess.”\n“It sucks.”\nAt times like this, Kim Do-han is glad he was born in Korea while the mercenary captain speaks in a cynical voice.\n“I’d rather they let the orcs in, like the neighboring Republic of Jilin. Sure, we’d get coup threats, but at least we wouldn’t have monsters on the road.”\n“Monsters on the road?”\n“There are monsters all over the country. Well, when we find them, we hunt them down and mine them for magic stones. That’s actually what we do more than gate raids.”\nDoes this mean that dungeon breaks are that common, and if you don’t trust the satellites, you’re effectively out of luck outside the city?\nHundreds of people have died in dungeon breaks in the middle of the slums, all because of a single blue gate.\nBodies are strewn everywhere, and the residents are already returning to their daily routines, unperturbed by the deaths.\nThe only ones crying in the middle of the Dungeon Break are the families of the dead.\nThis is purgatory.\n“Well, they’ll be fine in two days, let’s not bother them, they’ll take care of themselves.”\nIs it really okay? Koo Dae-sung suddenly remembered the virtues Leon had spoken of at the knight’s ordination ceremony at the TTG Temple.\n[Be courageous and do good]\n[Protect the weak, do not do injustice]\n[Love with purity and good will]\nKoo Dae-sung kept thinking about it and reported to Yappy that day.\n“Sir Spinner.”\n-Mr. Koo Dae-Sung.\n“I– I would like to stay here.”\n“”——!!””\nKoo Dae-Sung decision drew the attention of the troops. All that was left to do was to return to the TTG Temple with their backs to the sun and their stomachs full, but what is he talking about now?\n-Wait.\nYappy disappeared from the communication. Meanwhile, Captain Kim Do-han and the rest of the Man at Arms crew were asking Koo Dae-sung.\n“What does that mean?”\n“Knight Koo Dae-sung, what are you thinking?”\nEveryone was puzzled by Koo’s decision.\nHe is a knight of the TTG Temple, whose power and position was incomparable to that of a mere soldier.\nThey secured the granary so there is no reason for them to remain here.\nThey’ll just have to hire mercenaries periodically to guard the granary and that’s it.\n“No, Mr. Koo, is it because of what happened? It’s nothing new that this neighborhood is in shambles.”\nJust as Kim Do-han was about to rebuke Koo Dae-sung, the communication was restored but it wasn’t Yappy on the other end.\n[You said you were staying.]\n“Your Majesty?!”\nAs soon as they heard the voice, they all knelt down and picked up the receiver. For the jade sound of the Lionheart King was not something they could hear in a comfortable position.\n[Knight Koo Dae-sung, why did you say you would stay?]\n“What? Ah, that’s——.”\nKoo Dae-sung reported what had happened, and cautiously expressed his desire to stay and help the innocent citizens as a knight.\n[What good will you do there if you stay?]\n“That, that——.”\n[Are you going to join another raid, what do you think a B-class hunter can do?]\n“I’ve heard that there are monsters in this place, both on the roads and in the mountains, when you go outside the city.”\nIt would be helpful if he could ride around on horseback and hunt them down.\nKoo Dae-sung is a man who speaks for himself, but is not very confident.\nHe’s a knight of the lowest rank, a lowly B-class at best.\nAlthough he had improved greatly from his days as a D-rank, he was still weak and unconfident.\nHow much good would it do him to be alone?\n[Do you want to prove yourself, to this king, to be judged by the gods?]\nWhen Leon asked him if he was trying to make a name for himself by becoming a knight, Koo Dae-sung was left speechless.\nIn fact, isn’t this his own excuse? Isn’t he just blinded by his achievements and making up reasons?\nEven he can’t answer that with confidence. He was an underdog, unable to prove anything, unsure of anything.\nHe has no great power like King Lionheart and no natural talent like the other knights.\nHe wondered if he wanted to be recognized by pretending to be a good person.\n[Because you don’t need anyone’s approval for a challenge.]\nThe words came out of nowhere.\nThe knight who had failed endlessly, who had been frustrated, who had been told by the gods to give up, had rejected it all without a moment’s hesitation.\n“Your Majesty——.”\n[Speak]\n“I don’t need your approval for my challenge.”\n“”——!!””\nEveryone was stunned by the imperiousness of Koo Dae-sung but beyond the phone, there was no fiery rebuke, no matter how much time passed, but rather──\n[Cackle—!]\nThere was only an irrepressible chuckle, stifled between dignity and amusement.\n[Is that so?\nAs if this reminded him of his great predecessor, the Lionheart King’s heart thumped with joy.\n[Very well, if you choose to tread the path on your own, so be it, for not even the gods can discourage a journey of cultivation.]\n[Strength, faith, and the care of the gods will guard your path, and this king will expect the best from you.]\nThat was the end of the communication, as if no more words were needed.\n“Well, well, well, I see the king approves of this.”\n“I’m sorry.”\nCaptain Kim Do-han apologized and followed Koo Dae-sung as he removed his luggage from the transport.\n“Mr. Koo, as always, you’re too good to be true!”\nHe followed Koo Dae-sung to retrieve his own luggage.\n“Captain Kim?”\n“I’m staying too!”\n“No, what’s wrong with you too, Captain?”\n“Mr. Koo, we’ve been friends since we were both baggage carriers, and I owe you a favor for saving us from being overrun by monsters the raiding party missed, so I’m staying!”\n“What kind of movie are you making? Why are you staying behind?”\nHe was a fellow who had completed the first Man at Arms training with Koo Dae-sung and Kim Do-han.\n“If I go back, I’ll have to pay taxes, so I won’t be able to save any money~”\n“If we catch a monster here, we’ll get paid as a personal allowance, right?”\nOne by one all the members of the first generation Man at Arms put down their luggage.\n“No— If you all do that, it’ll be too much for me.\nKoo Dae-sung, who hadn’t expected fifty of his classmates to follow him, was moved, and he couldn’t keep the corner of his mouth down.\n“Forget it, we’re going to look for monsters floating around, and I’m sure Lord Yappy can give us some intelligence support, he’s got a very fearsome satellite up there!”\n“Captain Kim, that’s classified.”\nAbout fifty soldiers and one knight from the TTG Temple’s overseas contingent remained in the area and neither Yappy nor anyone else in Korea could predict what they would do.\nThus began the knight’s training.",

      "content": "Chapter 162: Journey\n“Cckkkk——.”\n“Uhm, Your Majesty, you look pleased, don’t you?”\nHa-ri tilted her head at Leon, who was looking quite pleased.\n“Because he reminded me of an old friend.”\n“An old friend of yours–Sir Antoine?”\n“You have met him, too.”\n“Yes, well–they are all honorable men.”\nLeon shook his head in denial, though it felt good to say it.\n“I met your brother, too.”\nLeon’s mind wandered down memory lane, and he remembered a day not too far away.\nHis old friend, the one he’d never get to see ascend, the one he’d been forced to perform a rite of passage in a re-creation of the past.\nJordic Bertum’s second son, a member of the Knights of the Riona Sunset and a servant of dreams and death.\nJerea the Clueless, also known as Jerea the Twilight.\n“Surprisingly, you’re pretty scrawny.”\n[I don’t need your approval for my challenge]\nThe conversation with Koo Dae-Sung reminded Leon of him.\nHis incompetence, his uprightness—even his stupidity.\n“But, don’t you know, it’s the stupid who shake up the world.”\n“Is that so?”\nHa-ri knew that Leon might be an eccentric man, but he was never wrong.\n“Well, since it is your Majesty who speaks, I suppose so.”\n“Your tongue is sharp, and you have learned the ways of a loyal servant.”\n“Am I a loyalist?”\n“You shouldn’t be.”\n“——.”\n“——.”\n“Just for a moment.”\n“No.”\n“——.”\nHa-ri looked down at Leon wordlessly, but he wasn’t even looking at her.\n“I’m sorry, not once, but a second time is too much!”\nYou’re putting me on the podium again!\nHa-ri was on top, and Leon was on the bottom.\nIt was a reversed hierarchy, but she liked the symbolic meaning.\nHa-ri sobbed on the bow of a giant ferry on the rolling sea.\nShe is the goddess of the sea and the waves, and she is currently sacrificing herself because of a custom that says it is unclean to have a woman on board.\n“Is this the sacrifice to the Poma I heard about?”\n” Beatrice.”\nBeatrice stared in disbelief at Ha-ri hanging from the pole.\n“Is this really what you’re going to do?”\n“Hehe, Beatrice.”\nLeon said, glancing at the not inconsiderable number of women aboard the massive luxury liner.\n“By nature, when there are women on board, uncleanness burns. However, the god Poma has mercifully granted a woman’s sacrifice to ward off uncleanness.”\n“But the code. Isn’t it possible to substitute an object for a woman?”\n“Yes. ——.”\nBeatrice’s words left Leon speechless. There was indeed such a code.\nThere was a code on the ship that prohibited the use of statues of women as offerings.\n“There are a lot of women on this ship,” he said, “and they’re not exactly the brightest——.”\n“Well, we’re traveling, and it would be a shame to leave them hanging there. I’ll use my magic to make a statue of a woman to replace them.”\nBeatrice repeated, and Leon agreed, as if he had no choice. So Ha-ri was able to climb down from the pinnacle just over three hours after the ship left.\n“Wow, freedom!”\nHa-ri is more excited about the fact that she won’t be hanging on to the dock for a week until she reaches his destination than she is about the treatment.\n“I’m going to change into my swimsuit!”\nLeon shrugged and headed back with Beatrice.\n“Your Majesty, this way!”\nLeading the two of them through the gates was the Lord of the Hanbit Palace, Park Yong-shin, who greeted them with an extremely polite demeanor.\n“Welcome aboard the Hanbit. How do you like it? Is there any inconvenience?”\n“Well, it’s not bad, but it’s a bit too decorated. It’s the vanity of a thunder-rich man.”\n“Alas— I can only apologize for offending your noble Majesty’s aesthetic.”\nPark Yong-shin’s expression was one of sincere apology, not flattery, and he gestured to the Hanbit Palace followers to guide the two.\n“I have the Royal Suite waiting for you, please make yourselves at home on the way to the ‘Republic of Taiwan’.”\n* * * *\nLeon’s sudden decision to set sail for the Taiwan Republic was due to a conjecture Beatrice had made.\n“The place where the Demon Archduke lurks?”\n“Yes, the Demon Archduke of Pleasure and Decadence, Quay, he is on Earth.”\nThe source was an Earth newspaper, scandals in the Republic of Taiwan and recent events in Taiwan.\nThe events there were similar to those of the former Kingdom of Spero, and that the coat of arms of the Demon Archduke Quai had been found. But most of all──\n“When I pronounced his name, he responded to me, though he immediately closed the channel.”\n“They say a demon’s name has magical significance.”\nBeatrice’s speculations were not simply unfounded. Rather, coming from a specialist who had hunted demons countless times, it was quite possible.\n“Very well. Then I’ll take my troops and head straight for the Republic of Taiwan.”\nThe problem is, Taiwan is an island, and there’s no reason to take an army on a whim.\nHere’s the tricky part.\n“As of today, the TTG Temple will be closed for the fall holiday.”\nThe trip to Taiwan was disguised as a vacation.\nFour hours after they chartered Park Yong-shin’s luxury cruise ship and set sail for Taiwan, Leon changed into his swimsuit and stepped out into the private pool lounge of his suite on the luxury liner.\n“Hmm.”\nThere were a few familiar faces in the lounge.\n“Oh, Your Majesty!”\n“Greetings!”\nSoo-ho and Jae-hyuk, the representative knights of the Modern TTG Temple and their leader, Chen So-yeon.\n“You’re here?”\nThe Knight Templar shyly hid her fit and healthy body, and her youthfulness could be overlooked as cute.\n-Awww!\nYappy is also enjoying the vacation, floating on the water in a striped swimsuit woven specifically for the fuselage.\nIt looks more like someone forced him to wear it to make him feel better than because he wanted to.\n“Make yourself comfortable.”\nLeon said and waded into the pool. Due to the cool fall weather, the pool was filled with warm water, almost like a hot spring bath.\n“Jae-hyuk and So-yeon were enjoying themselves first!”\nAt that moment, a red-haired girl appears in a fuss. Ha-ri was dressed in a fiery red bikini swimsuit and was running towards the pool.\n“Whoa, big sister, wait!”\n“Yay!”\nHa-ri, clinging to the diving board and shivering in the cold wind, threw herself into the pool without hesitation.\nWith a splash, water splashed everywhere.\n“Gah!”\nHa-ri dived to the bottom of the pool, up to the tips of her legs and the crown of her head, and bounced up, feeling the warmth of the water on her body and calling out to the three of them.\n“You guys should get in! It’s so warm in here!”\n“Uhm—sis.”\n“Huh?”\nSoo-ho couldn’t help but point to a certain direction with his eyes, where──\n“Humph, Your Majesty!”\nLeon, who had turned into a waterlogged mouse, was staring at Ha-ri in disbelief.\n“Uh, uh— Lung, Your Majesty ah——.”\nHa-ri is at a loss for words. She squeezed her eyes shut and cried out as Leon raised his hand, but instead of an angry slap, a large palm rested on the top of her head.\n“Your Majesty?”\nHa-ri’s eyes snapped open, and she saw a smirking Leon.\n“It’s good that you’re enjoying your vacation, but you’re also a lady, so be careful how you conduct yourself.”\n“Ah— I, I was a noble, wasn’t I?”\nBy the standards of the TTG Temple, knights were treated as nobles, but Ha-ri was a noble who had been chosen by two gods.\n“Hing— Your Majesty.”\nMove over, woman— there was a time when a commoner would have been criticized for trying to humble herself with a king.\nBut now she’s a knight of the Ten Thousand Gods Temple, a goddess favored by the gods, and a noblewoman who’s been granted a title!\nAn unmistakable noble lady!\n‘I am a woman with class?’\nThe fact that she was being patted on the head by the king himself, giggling, made her feel even more smug.\n“Heehee, I see, you’re that Lady, aren’t you?”\n“Hahaha, how can you be like a commoner, hahaha, you.”\n“”——.””\n-Bad luck.\nShe’s so arrogant as soon as she realizes she’s a nobleman. Is that a state official?\n-Badass!\n“Ouch! Your Majesty—“\nHa-ri said with a wry smile to Leon, who at one point gripped her head in an unnervingly tight grip. Leon, of course, is still smiling. But——.\n“Then you’ll have to learn the basics of being a lady, and I’ll personally educate you on courtly manners and noble bearing.”\n“Hah—?”\n“You’ll be tested, and if you don’t get it right, I’ll crack that leg whip to pieces. Do you understand?”\n“——Yes.”\nLeon declared to Poma and Petos that he would personally teach this bratty new noble the Lionheart court etiquette.\n“Heh——”\n“Is sister okay?”\n“No, I’m not fine—fire up the barbecue——”\nHearing his sister’s words, Soo-ho quickly walked over to the barbecue machine. Just then, a wire slapped Ha-ri across the face.\n“Ow!”\nWith a stinging pain, she turns around to see Yappy dangling from the pool balcony.\nHa-ri’s dive had swept her off her feet, and she was barely holding on to the balcony.\n-Come on, organism.\n“Hey, Lord Yappy!”\nHa-ri gasped, rushing to Yappy’s rescue and she barely managed to catch him.\n“Hey, are you okay?”\n-No.\nYappy slapped Ha-ri on the cheek with his mechanical leg. The slap hurt.\n“Hmph, that hurts.”\n-Stupid organism. Where did all the nutrients go?\n“Hing— ah, it hurts!”\nHa-ri felt like she had no cheeks left after taking slap after slap from Yappy.\n“It hurts?!”\n-Yuck!\nHa-ri can’t take it anymore and pulls Yappy into a tight hug.\nYappy struggled in her swollen, tight embrace, but he couldn’t escape Ha-ri’s vicious grip.\n-Let go of me!\n“If I let go, you’ll keep hitting me!”\nHa-ri is an S-class Hunter, a hunter of the caliber of a Knight Templar in terms of physical prowess alone and although Yappy’s total combat power surpasses Ha-ri’s, but that’s only in full battle mode.\nThat is, when equipped with a war platform.\nToday’s Yappy is a hundredth the size of its predecessor and the power limitations of its size were far from enough to overcome the viciousness of an S-class Hunter.\n-Let go. Warned.\nThe Yappy warned, unable to escape by force but Ha-ri, who was losing her strength due to Yappy’s warning, never let go.\nLooking at the two of them, Jae-hyuk inadvertently spilled his true feelings.\n“I envy Lord Yappy.”\n“She’s my sister.”\nBoom!\nThe punishment was unrelenting.\nEventually, after much negotiation, Ha-ri puts Yappy on the tube.\nHa-ri quickly changed the subject and fiddled with his swimsuit.\n“By the way, this swimsuit was purchased by Lord Yappy, wasn’t it? It was delivered to my room.”\n-Perfectly derived by math and big data.\n“Really? When did they get my size?”\n-Hacked.\n“????”\n-Easy.\n“????”\nHe confessed to something very criminal and it would be like opening Pandora’s Box to find out how much criminal activity is going on behind the scenes.\n-According to the machine’s observation and calculation before the database, it should be an easy matter.\n“Ahhh~”\n-Han Ha-ri. She usually prefers short pants that expose her abdomen and armpits, presumably due to active sweat glands.\n“Now, wait——.\n-Outside of work clothes, prefers hot pants, skinny jeans, and see-throughs. Even pajamas show a similar trend. An ape who doesn’t think much of nudity.\n“What do you mean, an ape?”\n-Kim Jae-hyuk prefers ripped pants that don’t make sense. Presumed to be a product of a distorted childhood. Post-traumatic stress disorder caused by traumatic memories──\n“No, this is fashion!”\n-Han Soo-ho purchased most of his clothes at the Dongdaemun pottery market, based on card payment patterns. Unable to let go of the beggar mentality of his orphanhood despite his wealth.\n“You, you’re so—!”\nThis mechanical robot had a strange interpretation of a sinful subject to the point of uselessness!\n-Chun So-yeon.\n“——.”\nYappy’s gaze turned to Chun So-yeon. Staring at her top, a two-piece swimsuit with frills on the chest──\n-Tending to be a male of the Gunnham family.\n“????”\n“”???””\nIt was an analysis that made even Leon tilt his head in disbelief.\n“Gunnham? Is it a new species?”\n-The tendency of males of the Gunnham’s bird family to exaggerate their chests to attract females. I almost bought a swimsuit based on this misleading information.\n“”————.””\n—.\n“You—!”\nChen So-yeon’s face turned bright red as she searched for something. Covering her chest, she picked up the skewer that Soo-ho had been grilling meat on just a moment ago and pointed it like a sword in anger.\n“Shut that mouth, you stupid robot!”\n-Correction. The main body is correct, the exact facts──\nThe pool goes wild as Chun So-yeon lunges at Yappy with a skewer, and Yappy makes a run for it, using his steel wires like Spider-Man in a superhero movie.\nIn the midst of the chaos, Ha-ri wisely slips away and looks for someone who isn’t there.\n“Where’s the queen?”\nBeatrice, who was supposed to be sharing the same floor, was nowhere in sight.",

      "content": "Chapter 163: The Road to Taiwan\nThe Man-At-Arms and most of the Knights of the Ten Thousand Temple stay in standard rooms.\nThe more luxurious suites and royal suites were reserved for Leon, the HOly Knights, and some of the Knights of the Burning Sword.\nThe Royal Suite, of which there are only two, was easy to find. Ha-ri strode down the hall in her bathing suit and entered the room where Beatrice would be.\n“Queen, are you there?”\nShe asked.\nShe knocked on the door, and there was no answer but she did hear a muffled voice.\n“Queen?”\nWondering what was going on, Ha-ri cautiously opened the door. Beatrice hadn’t closed it properly and the door to her room was open.\n“Uh, may I come in?”\nHa-ri peeked inside the room, but there was no sign of Beatrice. However she could definitely feel her presence.\n“????”\nShe pushed open the bathroom door and something grabbed her.\n“What?”\n‘Why? Why did she stop me from opening the door? Did something happen to the Queen?’\n“Queen! Are you okay!?”\n-Boom!\nThe door slammed open and Ha-ri stepped into the bathroom, where she was greeted by a luxurious marble backdrop and Beatrice, who stepped back to avoid the door being forced open.\n“Oh——.”\nSeeing Beatrice, Ha-ri was mesmerized and let out a series of exclamations.\n“Oooh, oooh——.”\n“Ha-ri?”\nShe hadn’t covered her face with her usual cotton cloth. She was dressed in a monokini swimsuit that showed off her height and body curves.\nFrom head to toe, there was nothing about her that wasn’t seductive, a natural aura that could mesmerize men–nay, even sane women–with just a glance.\nBlack rosebud tattoos on her eyes, chest, and thighs, inked with dots and fleur-de-lis, are reminiscent of mythical points of enchantment.\nThis is what a beauty who shakes up a nation must look like. Beatrice was indeed a woman of such power.\n“Wow— Queen. Wow—— you are so beautiful.”\nHa-ri is resistant to magic and as a blessed priestess, she was quite resistant to this near-curse but she couldn’t help but feel her face flush and her cheeks heat up.\n“Ugh——.”\nApart from that, Beatrice was busy covering her body with her fern-like arms, but how could she cover the sky with her palms?\n“Queen, why are you here, even in a swimsuit?”\n“Ugh— is this really a swimsuit?”\n“What? Of course it is——.”\nBeatrice stared at her reflection in the bathroom mirror with a blush.\nShe was dressed in a swimsuit that showed off her raunchy, tortured lines.\n“Queen?”\n“How could I be so brazen as to go out in public wearing something like this?”\nBeatrice, who had lived her life as a noble royalty from birth until now, could not tolerate an outfit that revealed her bare skin to such an extent.\nAs she wondered if she should stand in front of the people in this ridiculous outfit or change again, even though this was modern Earth with a civilization completely different from her own, Ha-ri walked in.\n“My queen, you look so beautiful!”\n“Ugh— Miss Ha-ri, are you all right?”\nBeatrice was appalled at Ha-ri’s swimsuit, which was just as revealing as her own.\n“How can an over-aged maiden bare her belly button— so embarrassingly——.”\n“My queen, you’re usually quite modest in your attire, and many of your dresses reveal your sternum and thighs.”\n“It’s fashion.”\nHa-ri wondered at Beatrice’s standards, which were only strict in swimwear.\nAs if reading her gaze, Beatrice crossed her arms over her chest and spoke with dignity.\n“I’ve been a socialite ever since my debutante ball, and as a fashion-forward first lady, I’ve worn many different styles of dresses──”\nHa-ri didn’t quite understand, but apparently there were different standards for dresses and swimsuits that showed off a socialite’s figure.\n“His Majesty is expecting me, so I’ll have to see you later.”\n“I’ll go to ——.”\n“No, I thought you said you’re not so brazen to go in public in that swimsuit.”\n“Well, apart from that, His Majesty has business to attend to, and there’s a lot to look forward to.”\nBeatrice exits the restroom as if she has no choice in the matter when suddenly, a large shower towel catches her eye.\n* * * *\nAfter the commotion was over, they took a hot bath in the pool reserved for the royal suite.\n“Ack, why are you hitting me, Lord Yappy!”\n-Checking your reflexes.\nSoo-ho was grilling meat on a barbecue machine while Yappy was floating on top of the pool, wielding a wire whip.\nJae-hyuk opened the refrigerator door, wishing His Majesty the Lionheart King a long reign.\n“Your Majesty~ Are you drinking, oh, there’s some expensive looking wine!”\nJae-hyuk pulled out bottles from the wine cellar and refrigerator. The boy reads the French alphabet on the expensive-looking wine bottle in a language he doesn’t recognize.\n“Hey, you’re underage.”\nSo-yeon gives him a one-word tackle.\nSoo-ho, Jae-hyuk, and So-yeon are still third-year cadets at Hunter Academy. While most academies spend their third year as guild trainees, they are technically minors.\n“Don’t be so hard on me, we’re graduating soon.”\nJae-hyuk is trying to gloss over the fact that he only has a few months left until his coming of age. Just then, Ha-ri’s voice rang out sharply.\n“Ouch! Jae-hyuk, what are you holding in your hand?”\nHa-ri, who had been traveling somewhere, rushed over and snatched the beer bottle from Jae-hyuk’s hand.\n“Ha, senior Ha-ri, this is a misunderstanding——.”\n“Junior, you’re still underage, right? Han Soo-ho!”\n“No, I’m not why——.”\n“Were you going to drink too?!”\n“No, no! I was grilling meat!”\n“Good job, Soo-ho, it’s too early for you to drink!”\nHa-ri had been the big sister at the orphanage until she entered the academy. As such, she was sensitive to her younger siblings who were prone to delinquency.\n“Anyway, this stuff is for grown-ups, okay?”\nThe eyes of the three minors–one year apart–subtly turned to Ha-ri, but she poured the beer into her glass anyway.\n“By the way, sister, where have you been?”\n“The queen isn’t here, so I went to the suite for a bit— Huh? Why hasn’t she come in yet?”\nHa-ri’s gaze fell on Beatrice, pacing at the pool’s entrance. Wrapped tightly in a towel, she still hesitated.\n“Ummm——.”\nIt’s a sight to behold.\nMen and women stripping down to their bare skin in a bathhouse-a pool?\nSomehow, she didn’t think Leon would, and she felt betrayed by his nonchalant presence in the pool.\n“Beatrice, what are you doing in there? The water is warm and pleasant, come in.”\n“Ugh, Your Majesty——.”\nLeon’s Lionheart Kingdom had the same glamorous social life and glorious culture as Beatrice’s Spero Kingdom, but with a slightly different twist.\nWhereas the magician-centered Spero Kingdom celebrated the virtues of understated rigor amidst the glamor, the Lionheart Kingdom boasted a free-spirited and active love life centered on knights.\nWhether it was a knight wooing a commoner or a knight battling an evil monster to save a princess, love stories were a popular genre of fiction and many were based on real life.\nLeon alone had been a romantic of his time, sacrificing a temple of purity for the sake of love.\n“Your Majesty–you don’t seem to mind.”\nBeatrice wrapped her towel tightly around her like a suit of armor and dipped her feet into the pool.\nShe was used to drinking with Leon, but this situation, with her skin peeking out from beneath the towel, seemed to put her off.\n“Well, it’s royal culture, and the kingdom’s banquet halls have quite a few rest rooms for men and women who have had their eyes struck that day.”\n“Your Majesty—!”\n“Haha, was that a little early for you, over-aged one?”\nBeatrice glared at Leon with a rare pointed look. It was clear that this man was mocking her.\n“That, by the way, Your Majesty, is a story for another time.”\nBeatrice said, still covering herself with the towel. The buoyancy of the water was causing some of the towel to float, but she didn’t seem to notice.\n“This time, in the Republic of Taiwan──”\nAt that moment, Leon’s index finger closed over Beatrice’s lips. Leon smirks at her wide-eyed expression.\n“We can talk about work later. For now, let’s eat, drink, and be merry.”\nRed paint began to smear across Beatrice’s white hydrangea skin.\n“Isn’t it time to enjoy the scenery, and the ocean waves that greet us in this period?”\n“Your Majesty–you are quite familiar with the customs of the planet, though not with its electronics, are you not?”\nLeon flushed at Beatrice’s point. His true home was Earth, after all.\nSo even though he had lived for 300 years as a medieval Lionheart King, he had easily adapted to Earth’s customs.\n“Alas, I’ll never get used to that damn smartphone thing.”\nLeon shrugged and held up a bottle of wine.\n“Here, the Lionheart King’s wine. Here’s one for each of you.”\n“Sis——.”\nSoo-ho glances at his sister, but Ha-ri is too distracted by Leon’s drink to notice.\n“I’ll take it.”\nJae-hyuk smirks and takes the glass, seeing it as a chance to get some expensive alcohol. So-yeon doesn’t turn down Leon’s offer, either.\nShe casually accepts one drink after another. Beatrice was also a fan of alcohol, so she timidly drank the contents of her glass while covering herself with a towel.\n“Hmm.”\nLeon takes it and has a subtle look on his face. Apparently, he didn’t like the taste.\nThe queen is the only one who can discuss the flavor, so Leon slyly asks her opinion.\n“How do you like the taste?”\n“It’s an aperitif from your Majesty, so it’s bound to be sweet.”\n“Eh——.”\nEven humility is frustrating at this point. Leon stretches out his hand toward the subspace, and bottles of liquor are summoned from it.\n“Made from grapes from the Lionheart province of Lebonia. It’s the most precious liquor I’ve ever seen.”\n“Ohhhh!”\nBeatrice accepted it with a wry smile. Her gaze was more expectant than before.\n“Your Majesty has served it to me a few times. It is a very sweet wine.”\nBeatrice’s approving words were met with anticipation as they slurped the wine down their throats. As they drank, they felt a sense of clarity, not dizziness or a faint sensation.\nThe intense pleasure on the tip of the tongue and the aroma that envelops the body make even beginners realize that this is no ordinary product.\n“Wow, this is unbelievable.”\n“I feel so energized just by drinking it.”\nAs a few more voices chimed in with their approval, Leon said proudly.\n“Of course it does. It’s made from grapes that the Holy Knight of Life and Fertility grows once a year with great skill. It’s meant to be an aperitif to honor the knights.”\nLeon says it’s a shame it’s not available in the modern era.\n“Hehehe——.”\nAt that moment, Ha-ri staggered from the seat next to Leon.\n“Sis, are you drunk?”\n“No, I only had a few drinks.”\nIt was indeed a heavenly drink but the alcohol content wasn’t that high, just one beer and two glasses of wine, and Ha-ri staggered like an invalid.\n” — give me a drink, please——.”\n“You must be drunk.”\nLeon looked down at Ha-ri with a rare compassionate gaze. He saw it many times in the kingdom, so it’s not a big deal.\n-Can break down alcohol.\nYappy transformed his mechanical arm into a hideous drill, preparing to perform some unspeakable operation but Leon interrupted.\n“Leave her alone, Lord Spinner. It’s a way of enjoying the drunkenness itself.”\n-Hmm?\nIn any case, Ha-ri was so drunk she could hardly contain herself any longer so Soo-ho stood up.\n“I’ll let her rest on the chair, she’s going to fall out.”\n“Okay, put a quilt over her so she doesn’t get cold.”\nThat’s when Soo-ho picked Ha-ri up and carried her out of the pool. Ha-ri, who had a twinge in her foot, collapsed and fell to the bottom of the pool.\n-Uh-oh! Uh-oh!\nWhat a wretch. Leon shook his head and tried to pick Ha-ri up, but that’s when Ha-ri’s instinctive holy energy was transformed into a holy technique.\nHoly Technique <Cutting Waves>\n-Ka-ah!\nThe pool parted with a crack. Like the Red Sea of the Earth Bible, the split water instantly gushed over the pool.\n“Aaah—”\nBeatrice stared at the bath towel that floated up with the pool water.\n“Ouch——.”\n“Wow——.”\nThe two boys reacted in unison while Beatrice wordlessly blushed and squatted down.\nJust as she was about to cringe in embarrassment at having exposed her navel, something fluttery enveloped her.\n“Your Majesty?”\nCovering Beatrice’s body was the cloak Leon had pulled out of subspace. It was the knight’s cloak that had protected her from the cold on the Demonic Glacier Continent.\nThis time, Leon spoke from inside the cloak that was spread out to cover Beatrice’s body.\n“Well, let’s get used to it.”\nLeon’s smile was the only thing that shone through the darkness that blocked out the sunlight.\n[Good, good, good, she looks so good]\n[Ha-ri, my bride, this is not the time to go to bed!]\n[Quiet war, it’s not a good time.]\n[Admit that the light has priority over my newborn!]\n[Tsk, tsk, let’s just have it all.]\n[I agree.]\n[Silence the sea and the vengeance]\n[Haven’t I got a daughter to fetch——.]\n[What’s wrong with abundance——.]\nThe voices of the gods are not heard by the common people. Unless you are a high ranking knight or priest, close to the gods and fully endowed with their blessings.\nIt was unfortunate that there were no ordinary worshippers in attendance who could not hear the gods.",

      "content": "Chapter 164: I’m here for sightseeing. Of course…\nThe door to the office of the Secretary-General of the Taiwanese Presidential Office slams open but the human inside is nonchalant, despite the rudeness of the visit.\n“Gee, Mr. President, you should have knocked.”\nThe President’s secretary-general is the center of power but they can’t outshine the President.\nIf the shadowy secretary-general were to greet the President in public like this, he would be fired immediately.\n“Is it time!”\nPresident Zhao is furious at the secretary-general’s demeanor. However, the nature of his anger is quite different from the situation.\n“The Lionheart King is coming! He’s coming here now! He’s coming with his monstrous knights!”\nThe Lionheart King and his Knights are the most talked about figures in the world.\nThey are otherworldly survivors and overwhelmingly powerful. Their image is basically a positive one, with godly miracles cleansing the land of miasma.\nHowever, when they decided to visit their country President Zhao panicked more than necessary.\n“If that maniac goes on a rampage, we’re all doomed!”\n“Well, why do you say that? Just because he’s an alien with common sense that differs from ours, should we ostracize him like that?”\n“You asshole, you don’t understand the situation-”\n──■■■■■■\nThe change was swift as a dark cloud loomed over the President office, filling it with inky blackness.\nIt was a creepy sense of space, as if floating vaguely in an endless universe.\nIn the midst of this sensation of being lost in space, President Zhao was only brought back to his senses by a dismal voice.\n[Wretch, you seem to have forgotten your mortal identity after flattering yourself with my greatness]\n“Ah, ah, ah—.”\nPresident Zhao’s vocal cords quivered, but he couldn’t make a sound. Fear and submission were all he could muster.\nThe Archduke of Pleasure and Depravity said.\n[Don’t flatter yourself with your lowly status. You are not the Lionheart King. You are not the Magician Queen. You’re not even a city guardian. Don’t think that a plaque with your name on it will elevate your status.]\nPresident Zhao nodded desperately. It was only after some crude kowtowing and filthy submission that President Zhao was finally pulled out of the darkness.\n“Hmph— hmph, hmph, hmph!”\nEven before its existence was announced to the world, President Zhao had known of this demon.\nHe had immediately succumbed to the fact that a being of such terrifying power and might existed on Earth.\n“Ha, but— uh, how——.”\nAnd then came the monster that defeated even such a Demon Archduke.\nThe video of Akasha, the Slaughter Archduke, being defeated by the Lionheart King had the highest traffic in the world.\nHe was a monster that had overwhelmed even S-class Hunters and he was coming to Taiwan now.\nIt was a fact that even he had only realized a short time ago, hidden in the name of travel.\nIf he came, if they came, if those annihilationists landed on this land—–\n“If the Lionheart King–if the Ten Thousand Gods Temple recognizes us—we’ll all die.”\n“That can’t be——”\nIt was a desperate remark. That even this mighty Demon Archduke was so sure, it felt like hope was slipping away.\n“Isn’t it obvious, the Magician Queen or the Holy Knight of the Flame, no matter what they are no match for the Lionheart King.”\nMalus, Lord of Chaos and Destruction, or Caracael, Lord of Wisdom and Dothraddon, Lord of Pleasure and Decadence, could not defeat the Lionheart King in the end.\n“Only the power of a Lord can stand against the Lionheart. He’s like a god of victory in human form.”\nEven if the current Lionheart King was not as powerful as it once was, its power would not be at the level of the Archduke.\nBut as for the Fallen Archduke Quai — Yang Wei, the current Secretary-General of President Zhao, said nonchalantly.\n“So welcome them, the President Zhao hasn’t received the ‘Demonization Blessing’, so you won’t be found out right away.”\n“What’s the way?”\nAt that, Quai twisted the corner of his mouth wickedly.\n“I’ll invite them to a banquet, a banquet of pleasure and depravity.”\nJust as Rakshar had been waiting for the right time, he did the same.\n* * * * *\n-Bang, bang, bang, bang!\nA loud crackle of fireworks echoed from the harbor as soldiers fired off cannons and red carpets lined the road.\n“A hearty welcome to our country, Your Majesty.”\nGreeting Leon and his entourage as they disembarked from the luxury liner Hanbit were President Zhao of the Republic of Taiwan and key members of his cabinet.\n“Leon Dragonia Lionheart, King of the Lionheart.”\nAfter shaking hands with Leon, President Zhao greeted Beatrice and Yappy in quick succession, even as he broke out in a cold sweat.\n-Yikes!\nHe had to bend down quite a bit to shake hands with the minimalist mechanical spider.\n-Thump! Thump!\nJust then, a shadow fell over President Zhao. Clearing his throat, Zhao looked up at the shadow’s owner with a sore throat.\n“Lord Vulcanus——.”\nVulcanus, Holy Knight of War and Flame. From what Zhao had heard, this Holy Knight was a demon’s worst nightmare.\nFacing the massive hulk of armor, more than two meters tall, Zhao realized he could burn him to death with his breath.\n“Are you the one who is the king of this country?”\n“Eh?”\nHis hot breath that seemed to burn the air and overwhelmed by the searing gaze, Zhao didn’t understand the question.\n“Ah, yes, yes, no, I am the democratically elected head of state, which is different from a king!”\nIt was a stammering answer, in more ways than one for a head of state, but Zhao stammered for a while before he suddenly realized that there was no specific group in the crowd.\n“The Flaming Sword Knights are——.”\n“The knights are waiting in Korea. All I brought with me is the Man-At-Arms and the porters to escort the cargo.”\nStepping off the luxury liner, the Hanbit, were the S-ranked and semi-S-ranked Hunters, Ha-ri, the Academy trio, the Man-At-Arms, and the serfs.\nThey were nervous that the Lionheart King himself was coming, but he’d left most of his troops in Korea?\nIsn’t he here to invade?\nOf course, there could be Templars and state troops hiding on that passenger ship, so I’ll have to give it a thorough inspection in the name of customs.\n“By the way, Your Majesty, what brings you to our Republic?”\nLeon replied to President Zhao’s question as if he were asking the obvious.\n“Sightseeing.”\n* * * *\nIntelligence agents from Taiwan’s National Security Bureau had been watching them ever since they landed.\nYou might ask whether it’s an overreaction to have a national intelligence agency monitoring tourists, but it would be irresponsible not to, since those tourists could overthrow the country if they wanted to.\n[That’s more modest than I thought.]\n[Yeah. Not much movement here either.]\nThe favorite characters of the week are Leon and Beatrice.\nLeon and Beatrice are being escorted around by the Taiwanese president himself, taking good pictures for the media, and Vulcanus is sightseeing with Ha-ri and his knights.\nHe wasn’t meant to be stealthy in the first place, but with his size and gleaming armor, he’s bound to be noticed wherever he goes.\n-Taking a photo with Lord Vulcanus of the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods!\n-Lord Vulcanus and Han Ha-ri just finished eating our fried chicken wings!\nLeon and Beatrice are so famous and Ha-ri is also a huge influencer.\nHe wondered if they needed to be monitored because they were so prominent. If you just look at their social media, you can see where they are.\n[What about the other knights and Man at Arms?]\n[Sightseeing. There were a lot of them, so I didn’t catch them all, but aren’t they really sightseeing?]\n[I’m sure they’re planning something.]\n[Didn’t you say that nothing happened when they went to Japan?]\nAfter the survivor Leon’s name came out, the world’s intelligence agencies gathered their own information about the TTG Temple and the people around it.\nThe conclusion they came up with was a common one: medieval authoritarian king + staunch fundamentalist.\nAn anachronistic classist and religiously unforgiving fundamentalist.\nIt’s no secret that he hates democracy.\nHowever, his respect for President Ahn and Prime Minister Fujisawa for their legitimacy proves that he is surprisingly communicative.\nThat’s why the NSS agents were puzzled by the higher-ups’ attitude of being more vigilant than necessary.\n[They said there might be knights or extra troops waiting somewhere.]\n[After all, they didn’t find anything inside the ferry, did they?]\n[That’s right, we’re about to go to Shuangshijie, and we can’t even rest.]\nOctober 10th is coming up. Taiwan celebrates the National Day of the Republic, also known as the Twelfth Day.\nThe day is marked by a feverish ceremony by the Taiwanese military and nationwide festivities, so some of the Secret Service agents were able to take the day off.\nHowever, with the visit of the TTG Temple, an emergency decree was issued for the entire Bureau. In effect, no vacation for Shuangshijie.\n[Uh, but I don’t see one person.]\n[Who? We’ve got most of the major players under live surveillance]\nThe knights and the Men at Arms have even mobilized a police force to keep an eye on them, but they’re not professionals, so they’re bound to be flawed.\nHowever, Han Ha-ri, Chun So-yeon, the other Knights and Vulcanus are closely monitored──\n“Huh?”\nThe Safety Bureau agent who had inadvertently let out a stupid voice realized who he had been missing.\n[Park Yong-shin and Yakt Spinner, where are they?! Who’s in charge, report to me now!]\n[This is Cheong Tim! Cheong Tim, come in!]\nFrantic radio chatter flows among the Safety Bureau agents. When they had followed Cheong Tim’s GPS, there was no sign of them.\nThey’d been attacked by something, a sign of battle. Blue Team surveillance, even veteran hunters, had been cut down before they could draw their swords.\n“Damn it!”\nI didn’t think they’d be so brazen as to dispose of the monitors like this! The agents of the Safety Bureau had a hunch that the TTG Temple wasn’t really here for tourism. Then——.\n“Find them now! Search all the CCTVs to find out where they went, and double the number of people who are currently watching them!”\nSomething–something is going on.\nWhy two people?\nYakt Spinner, the mechanical Holy Knight of the TTG Temple, and Park Yong-shin, the former head of a cult, we’re planning something.\n* * * *\nThe Hanbit Palace was a world-wide cult with quite a name.\nWhile it had a significant presence in its home country of South Korea, it had also established branches in the U.S., Japan, and Europe, with significant numbers of adherents in Taiwan.\nMonths after Leon’s divine punishment of Hanbit Palace. All the members were purified and taught the true faith.\nFor a while, Hanbit Palace members from all over the world began to arrive in South Korea and visit TTG Temple, but surprisingly, it was done in secret.\nDue to the nature of the cult, the members were thoroughly educated on how to remain invisible to the media.\nDue to the nature of the religion’s propagation during the cult era, it does not operate a large cathedral. It is basically a point organization where members of the Hanbit Palace visit people’s homes to give testimonies and learn doctrine.\nAnd today is a monumental day for the 138,000 members of the Taiwan branch of Hanbit Palace.\n“Today is truly a glorious day.”\nPark Yong-shin told the congregation in fluent Chinese. His passionate testimony and sermon alone brought tears to the eyes of the congregation in Taiwan.\nBut Park Yong-shin is not the main event of the day.\n“Today, His Majesty the Lionheart King, who is our spiritual leader and has granted us the grace to awaken to the true faith, has personally sent a representative.\nI present to you, the Holy Knight who represents Mr. Heto, the God of Iron and Blacksmithing! Sir Yakt Spinner!”\nYakt Spinner steps up to the dais on his eight steel legs and climbs onto the tall cushion that has been prepared for him.\nHis camera eye beams to the congregation in front of him, and through the heavily encrypted relay site.\n-Good morning. I’m Yakt Spinner.\nYappy incited the crowd with a natural voice and powerful gestures that dazzled them in a way that a cold steel machine could not.\n-The indulgence of the unbelievers has reached a fever pitch. The time has come for you to fulfill your duties as the chosen servants of the gods.\nThe Yakt Spinner projected something onto the screens that would be beamed to each branch. It was a large number of boxes of unknown origin.\nThose with eyes to see realized at once what they were.\n-Explosives?\nYappy continued his sermon to the murmuring congregation.\nThe strange voice that had started a world war some ninety years earlier convinced the congregation that they were doing the right thing. And when the heightened emotions reached a fever pitch, Yappy waved his mechanical arm powerfully and shouted.\n-Deliver the punishment, for it is the will of the gods!\n-Gods will!\n-As the gods will!\nOne hundred and thirty-eight thousand terrorists were produced.",

      "content": "Chapter 165: Vulcanus’ Ambition\nBefore landing in Taiwan, the orders from Leon were simple.\nEnjoy yourself.\nSpend some money, meet the locals, and relax.\nThe order caught everyone off guard since they hadn’t heard much about Leon’s trip to Taiwan in the first place.\nWhy was he going to Taiwan now, at this time of year? No one knew for sure, but it seemed clear that Leon was planning to do something here.\n“Lord Vulcanus. Here’s some fried chicken wings— Yikes, did you break a chair again?!”\nHa-ri was horrified to see Vulcanus sitting on one of the chairs outside the shop and smashing it.\n“How many are there, and you’re just standing there?”\n“Hmph—, the chairs are weak!”\nVulcanus’ plea fell on deaf ears: his gigantic size alone barely exceeds standard weight, and his armor is made entirely of stardust, so there’s no way the chair could hold up.\n“Why don’t you at least take off the armor, it’s intimidating to the citizens.”\n“Hmm? No, I just took a selfie. I was quite popular.”\n“Really?”\nIt was then that a tourist who had been hanging around Vulcanus approached him and asked for a photo.\n“Mr. Vulcanus. Can I have a picture with you?”\nVulcanus responded to the French-looking woman’s request in a jovial tone.\n“Of course, señorita!”\n“Oh, that’s Italian.”\n“That’s right, GRARARARA──!!”\nVulcanus took a picture with the woman with a boisterous laugh. Ha-ri was dumbfounded at the sight.\n“What, what is it?”\nVulcanus flicked something from inside his armor and pulled out a smartphone.\nIn his hulking hands, the smartphone looks tiny, even though it’s clearly the largest smartphone of the current generation.\n-Click, click, click!\nVulcanus skillfully taps his smartphone to access his social media accounts. At first glance, he has a lot of followers.\n“What is this?”\n“It’s an account we created to extol the virtues and teachings of our Order. Here is the account of Her Majesty the Queen, High Priestess of Dreams and Death.”\nIt’s no secret that Beatrice is quite adept with modern technology.\nIn fact, she can get likes from all over the world for a selfie of herself wearing nothing but cotton wool all day, with just a hint of her eyes showing through.\nBeatrice, the otherworldly queen of magicians and fearsome beauty, has put this to good use, promoting the TTG Temple.\n“Oh, Lord Laihar man has arrived. Let’s see.”\nBut Beatrice was an intellectual everywhere she looked.\nShe was a woman of innate knowledge and intelligence. She debunked dozens of magical theories put forth by the high mages of the Tower.\nBut Vulcanus had never——\nHe was a very impressive human being.\nFirst of all, the ferocity in his searing gaze alone made Ha-ri freeze like a frog in the presence of a snake.\nThe moment she made eye contact, she instinctively realized that this man was far more powerful than she was.\nHis overwhelmingly large presence filled her vision.\nBeyond being a Holy Knight or the War God’s rider, Vulcanus would have accomplished something great even if he hadn’t become a member of the pantheon.\nHa-ri understood that he was a giant who would be at the center of history.\n“Small, small, Mr. Petos, how fitting that you made such a poor little girl your priestess!”\nShe almost fell backwards at the sound of his boastful voice.\n[She’s a sinful dwarf by your standards.]\nPetos gives him a look, but Vulcanus doesn’t seem to mind, just chuckles.\n“First of all, Lord Han Ha-ri, you need to grow some height, chest, and ass!”\n“Sexually harassing me five minutes after we met?!”\nVulcanus makes a questioning gesture at the stunned Ha-ri.\nHe pounded his massive head and emphasized the pectorals of his chest, then turned around to show off the muscles of his back and his ungainly ass.\n“Big height! Big boobs! Big ass!”\nShe wondered, was this really not sexual harassment?\nAnyway, ever since that shocking first meeting, Ha-ri had perceived Vulcanus as a rather savage macho knight.\nA big, burly knight who looked like he was about to dagger a huge, meaty steak, lift it up, and shout, “No one is going to stop me,” and then──\n“I’m a social media star on a smartphone, and I’m better at it than even His Majesty!\nCompared to the Lion King, who showed no signs of getting used to modern culture no matter how much he was educated, Vulcanus was skillfully utilizing modern advantages.\n“Hmph— not enough fire. Lack of divinity.”\nVulcanus, who was in the midst of socializing and eating fried rice with chicken wings, expressed such a complaint.\n“What?”\nLack of flavor is one thing, but lack of divinity? Before Ha-ri could say anything, Vulcanus was already in action.\n-Kaaaaaah!\n-Kaaaaaah!\n-Fire!\nThe onlookers were stunned by the sudden burst of flame. Whether they realized it or not, Vulcanus’ fingers, the source of the fire, scorched the fried chicken wings Ha-ri had brought.\nHe used a flame of divinity that burns demons to the bone to heat up street food.\n“Mmm! Just right!”\nVulcanus looked at the cooked chicken wing fried rice with satisfaction. He took off his helmet and ate it in one bite.\n[That bastard, wasting his holy power again!]\nPetos gritted his teeth at the wanton waste of holy power.\n[Ha-ri, my nymph, have a word with that ignoramus!]\n“What, me?”\nHa-ri glanced at Vulcanus, and immediately looked fed up.\nHe’s well over two meters tall, and he moves effortlessly in hundreds of kilograms of stardust armor that looks like it weighs a ton, and his bare neck and arms are covered in bundles of muscle that look like they’re made of steel.\nHe could strangle a giant with his bare hands, and his searing gaze was unrealistically intense.\nEven if he had been a commoner, not a knight or hunter, he had a presence she wouldn’t have dared to contend with—what was she supposed to do against a Vulcanus who had forearms as thick as her waist?\n“I can’t——.”\n[Ha-ri—!]\nHa-ri spontaneously lowered her head, and Vulcanus laughed heartily and patted her on the shoulder.\n“Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!”\nHer shoulder blades feel like they’re being crushed by the palm of his hand.\n“Lord Vulcanus—! More than that! Was it because of you— that Lord Petos’ holy power was cut off last time?!”\n“Hmm?”\nHa-ri said, referring to the incident where Lord Petos’ holy power was suddenly depleted during the Great Gate Crisis.\nHa-ri had been able to utilize the power of Poma, but the other knights had had a hard time.\n“Ah, that’s what happened. Hmm, it’s all because Petos wasn’t as good as he used to be. I can’t believe he’s so depleted after a divine descent.”\n[Me, me, me—!]\nPetos’ voice trembles as if he’s suffering from apoplexy. He’s probably grabbing the back of his head as well.\n“Divine Descent ——.”\n“You know that, too? I don’t think your lordship taught you that on purpose.”\n“Yes–I have seen it.”\nAntoine, Holy Knight of the Iron and Blacksmiths and Isabelle, High Priestess of the Moon and Purity,\nGillingham, Holy Knight of Sky and Thunder and Loxley, Holy Knight Sun and Judgment.\nEach of them, in their final moments, became one with the Gods in the Divine Descent.\nVulcanus had no qualms about using the Divine Descent as a final self-destruct.\nIf there is a human being capable of such a thing——.\n“I don’t think it’s possible for anyone but you’re his Majesty.”\n“Certainly not, for even the Lionheart Kings of old could not contain more than three gods.”\nThe current Lionheart King, Leon Dragonia Lionheart, is the pinnacle of history, Vulcanus affirmed.\n“This is the realm of pure talent. The miracle of ‘representing the gods’ cannot be contained in a human vessel, it overflows.”\nVulcanus used Jerea as an example.\n“Sir Jerea left a legacy of noble spirit and feats as a Holy Knight, but he was not capable of the Descent.”\nThe other Holy Knights could barely last a dozen minutes after the Descent.\n“So you’re saying that His Majesty is full of talent?”\n“Yes! I, Vulcanus, am a freak of history, and he, my lord, is an even bigger freak than I am!”\nIf it weren’t for Ha-ri, who had witnessed Leon’s fighting prowess, she would have denied it in the face of Vulcanus’ overwhelming presence.\nHa-ri’s golden eyes widened as Vulcanus continued.\n“And you also have talent.”\n“Me?”\n“As you may have vaguely guessed, Han Ha-ri, you are already capable of channeling the power of two gods, which is proof that you are a natural vessel of divinity.”\n“Ah, no. I just happened to be lucky──”\nVulcanus pointed a thick thumb at Ha-ri’s sternum, her heart, to be exact.\n“You said you had a Heart of Fire transplanted from Isabel, and this is proof.”\nHa-ri looked down at her heart.\nIn the Lionheart Kingdom, Ha-ri inherited two holy items from Isabelle.\nOne was a bracelet called the Heart of the Sea, left by Manon, the Holy Knight of the Sea and Waves, and the other was──\n“The Orc Undertaker, Duke of Renault. The Heart of the First High Priest of War and Flame.”\nA legendary saint who, along with the first King Lionheart and the first Grand Duke of Dragonia, laid the cornerstone of the kingdom.\nThey each left their power in the form of a “heart.”\n“The Lionheart, the greatest and most all-powerful, was implanted in His Majesty, and the Dragonheart, the fiercest and most ferocious, belongs to His Majesty–nay, to Archduke Karina.”\nAnd the one remaining, the Fire Heart of the Duke of Renault.\n“Your Heart of Fire is the most intense founding flame of all. It is a holy relic, a symbol of the Knights Templar, worshiped and honored by the Order of the Burning Sword.”\n“It’s that awesome——.”\nHa-ri looked bitter at the realization. Sure, the items taken from the Gate were perfect ‘reproductions’ of it, but they were just as much a part of it as the real thing, just another copy.\n“But you are not using the Heart of Fire properly.”\n“Is that so?”\nThis is why I was promoted to an S-class Hunter. And yet, it’s not enough?\n“It is an artifact that produces its own holy power, just like the Lionheart. Even if I had squeezed out all of Mr. Petos’ meager holy power, you, with the Heart of Fire implanted, would have produced enough.”\n“Is that so?”\nVulcanus chuckled. Apparently, it was up to him to raise this new girl to be the next Holy Knight.\n“Well, since there can’t be two Holy Knights, I’ll try to become a Holy Archduke or something.”\n[There is no such title!]\n“Uh-huh, Mr. Petos. To be honest, I’m not quite the same as the other Holy Knights, so I’m sure there’s room for a new position for me. Mmm—! Yes!”\nVulcanus slapped his knee with a bang, the light gesture creating a gust of wind and causing the tourists around him to scream.\n“A king! Yes, a king! I’ve always wanted to play king one day!”\n[No, this guy?! Blasphemy!]\nHa-ri and Petos are horrified that Vulcanus would say the word king, which in an absolute monarchy is tantamount to treason.\nOnly Vulcanus nonchalantly blurts out his treasonous words.\n“I am the Holy King, and His Majesty is the Lionheart King.”\n“Uhhh——”\nHa-ri wanted to tell him that something was wrong, but Vulcanus quickly pulled out a tourist map and scanned the terrain across Taiwan.\n“Lord Ha-ri, this country called Taiwan, how big is it in terms of the world?”\n“About——”\nThe tourist map didn’t do it justice, so Ha-ri pulled up a world map on her smartphone and pointed to Taiwan’s location.\n“This is the island of Taiwan, where we are now.”\n“Mm—! And South Korea?”\n“Uh-huh.”\nHa-ri pointed to the location of South Korea, and Vulcanus went──\n“grararararara──!!”\nHe let out a booming roar that caused a ripple in the air with its volume alone.\n“Small! Small! Small enough to contain the magnificent power of the Lionheart, when the world is so vast!”\nThe sound of the Vulcanus held a kind of endless anticipation, almost too much for the souls of mere mortals to bear.\nDo Ha-ri and the other tourists realize that Vulcanus’ distinctive cackle is a downgrade ordered by the Lionhearted King to reduce the volume of his magnificent voice.\nHe was the one who had burned away the magic of the Archduke Glacier with the flames of his sexual power alone.\n“Okay, okay, this is China first, we’ll take it and march westward, and once we’ve founded the Lionheart Empire, we’ll take the best of it and make it ours, but for now, let’s save this place called Taiwan for a vacation home!”\nIt was a crazy idea for a 21st century war of conquest, but Vulcanus was determined to put a statue of himself in the center of this Taiwanese land.\n“Oh, no! War is—!”\nHa-ri protested at the horrible sound of world domination, but Vulcanus was determined.\n“Ahem! The nations of the culprits are corrupt and self-indulgent in the first place, and look what happened when our Lionheart authorized the Empire instead of conquering the world, and the result is the decay of the Empire!”\nIn Vulcanus’ view, the Empire and the other kingdoms rose because the Lionheart did not conquer, because it did not seek to expand unnecessarily.\nThe Lionheart saw other nations as objects to be educated and taught, not conquered and dominated.\n“Pe, Petos, stop him!”\nHa-ri desperately clutched at the threads of reason and called out to Petos. Vulcanus was the most godless Holy Knight she’d ever seen, but wouldn’t he listen to Petos?\n[Good, you’re talking a good game for once, and you’re worth a throne when you’re done with the Great War’s task of conquering the world.]\n“That’s right, a war god!”\nPetos, the god of war and fire. In terms of loyalty, he’s the god most similar to Vulcanus!\n“Lord Poma —!”\nHa-ri’s prayers were now directed to Poma, but he was also-──\n[Speaking of the Global World, it would be easy to conquer it if I just blocked the sea routes, the Mediterranean Sea is so fine and good, I’ll set up my statue there].\n‘These people, they were not only medieval people, they were medieval gods!’\nThere’s no such thing as love and peace!\nHa-ri changed the subject to stop this barbaric medieval worldview from progressing.\n“Your Majesty, Your Majesty, what were you thinking letting us loose?”\nHa-ri had been warned beforehand that there would be a Demon Archduke of Pleasure and Decadence here.\nHa-ri had been warned that there would be a Demon Lord of Pleasure and Corruption here, so she expected to go straight to the demons, but Leon’s behavior was not at all what she expected.\n“Well, I’m sure my lord has something in mind.”\n“I’m sure he does, he’s got such an image——”\nHa-ri couldn’t say yes because the image of charging in and smashing everything was strongly implanted in her mind.\nLooking at Ha-ri, Vulcanus smiles meaningfully.\n“Well, well, well, Lord Ha-ri, have you not seen the other side of your master?”\n“Another— side?”\n“His Lordship is as honorable and just a knight as any knight has ever been, but He is also a cunning and cruel man— beyond the imagination of any knight.”\n“What?”\nVulcanus recalled what was now a memory.\nOnce upon a time, when he was a berserker wielding the power of an evil god, there had been a ‘King of Terror’ who had struck him down and smashed him with his millions of barbarians thirteen times.\nA war horseman of the highest order, favored by the God of War above all others.\nThat was the Lionheart King of the Age.\nHe became a symbol of victory, or in other words, he would do anything to win the war.",

      "content": "Chapter 166: President Zhao’s Nightmare\nIn the years after the Cataclysm, when the first survivors were discovered, Earth was abuzz for a time.\nThe arrival of the survivors from the otherworld beyond the Gate is a singularity in human history. Humanity learned new world technologies from them, and realized that they could benefit from each other.\nHowever, as survivors continued to cross the Gate, their scarcity diminished, and their treatment became problematic.\nThe survivors, former nobles, generals, and other high-ranking individuals, wanted to be treated similarly on Earth.\nBut in a democracy, nobility and royalty are only honorary titles; they have no taxing power, no territory, and no pardons.\n“His Majesty Leon Dragonia Lionheart, Queen Beatrice Alighieri Spero, please enter!”\nIf it’s anything more than an S-class hunter, the treatment is bound to give a nation pause.\nIn Taiwan’s Presidential Palace there was a huge welcome ceremony with soldiers and service personnel on standby.\nThere were surprisingly few reporters, given the size of the event, because Leon didn’t like them.\n[How dare you speak your mind in the presence of the King, will you stay away!]\nLeon disliked the rudeness of reporters who pointed cameras and microphones at him, and the Lionheart King’s anger would send them to the hospital with low-frequency radiation, so they had no choice but to avoid him.\nAs a result, it became a national rule that only a handful of reporters were allowed to cover Leon, with carefully selected questions.\nIt was a rare occurrence for the media to bow down to a single individual, but those who witnessed the debilitation of senior reporters believed that the Lionheart King had the power to curse people.\nIn any case, the state’s treatment of this otherworldly king set a model guideline for the South Korean government.\nBasically, you should expect to be treated with the same respect as modern monarchs, such as the British royal family, and feel comfortable giving in to any demands.\nJapan alone has shown extreme caution in its treatment of South Korean President Ahn.\nPresident Zhao was fully aware of this.\n‘This is the king of an absolute monarchy.’\nAfter the collapse of China, Zhao, who had dispatched diplomats with little fanfare and arranged annual visits by presidents and royalty from various countries, had never prepared a state dinner with such care.\n‘I’ve got my jjambap, I’ll eat it anyway!’\nHe had even served the Pope so Zhao desperately tries to pass this off as casual.\n“Haha, Your Majesty, how about our official residence, which is currently unused and operated as a museum?”\n“Hmm, it was built over a hundred years ago?”\n“Yes, after the Civil War, President Chiang Kai-shek built a new official residence and opened it to the public.”\nPresident Zhao welcomes state guests to Taiwan with a VIP full-course meal when they first arrive.\nAnd it’s clear that Leon liked the way he was treated.\n‘Good! That’s a green light! He’ll return to Korea as it is!’\nAbove all, he had a reason to be extremely protective of Leon──\n‘If this guy loses his temper and suddenly goes on a rampage, I’ll definitely die.’\nHe was a demon follower, well to be fair, President Zhao is not a demon follower.\nLike any other politician, he pursued his own excesses, and in the process ran afoul of the Demon Archduke of Pleasure and Decadence.\n‘Damn you, Shi Yan, I only got in because I was lured in by the promise of a great new recruit!’\nA high ranking member of the council, promising to introduce him to a nice girl, was met by the Demon Duke of Fallen, who made him lose all will to resist.\n[If you listen to me, I will give you immortality, when the Earth is ours]\nPresident Zhao was a devout Christian. He wasn’t particularly interested in immortality, as he planned to go to heaven when he died, but he knew that if he refused on the spot, he would die.\nThe power of the Demon Archduke is so terrifying and powerful that no earthly entity can stand against it. Just one of these demons would be enough to devastate the planet.\nShouldn’t we be on the side of the victor?\nPresident Zhao made a choice to survive, a choice he now regrets terribly.\nIf anyone were to ask him why he served the demons, he would say this.\n‘Because I didn’t know! I didn’t know that there would be an Otherworldly survivor who could defeat the Demon Archduke! If I had known, I would not have done it!’\nQuai tells him to bide his time until the twentieth, but Zhao is eager to send Leon back.\n“I’d like to know how you liked your meals, hehehe!”\nAnd just like that, the feast was over, with food going down their throats and up their nostrils, and they were about to move on to the next part of their schedule.\n“I’m surprised.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I’ve had a lot of meetings with people representing the government lately. They’re polite to this king, but they’ve got a secret agenda.”\n“Yeah? What, what’s that——”\nNo way, he’s realized I’m a follower of the demons!\nNo way! I don’t want to be a demon follower, so I’ve been avoiding demonization blessings as much as possible!\n“I’m just as guilty these days. They beg to sell my stuff because they’re dumb drones. All the while abandoning the source of their power, their faith.”\nLeon grumbled, but it was only natural.\nThe star iron weapons, blessed crops, and high-tech equipment of the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods are strategic equipment that countries around the world are eager to acquire.\nAny other head of state would use Leon’s visit as an opportunity to make connections, but President Zhao just wants Leon to leave Taiwan as soon as possible.\n“Ah~ Speaking of which, I have a gift for the president.”\n“Ah, it’s my honor, Your Majesty.”\nLeon smiled and handed the president a box.\n“And this?”\nLeon carefully opened the box, and inside was a necklace with an old-fashioned design. It was a necklace that even he, who had just turned sixty last year, felt comfortable wearing around his neck.\n“It’s a necklace made of stellar iron. It doesn’t have much power, but it has the ability to preserve health and ward off evil.”\n“I see.”\nWard off evil? Does it drive away demons?\n“I have received a precious gift, Your Majesty.”\n“Go ahead and try it on.”\nSince he had been given something that he could use directly, President Zhao had to present a good picture while trying it on.\n“It looks good on you.”\n“Thank you, Your Majesty.”\nActually wearing the necklace made him feel refreshed and energized.\n“Then thank you for the day. You and the queen may rest in your quarters for a while. It was an honor to have both of your majesties visit our republic.”\nFinally, it’s over, and after a final photo op with a gesture of closeness to Leon, they’re on their way.\nAs they boarded the limousine to his official residence.\n“Thank you for your work. The Chief of Staff is pleased──Kii-yin?!\nThe driver, a lowly demon wearing human skin, who was waiting in the limousine, suddenly screamed.\n“What, what?”\n“Off, off, off! Grrrrrr—!”\nThe demon disguised as a chauffeur scratched at the dull leather and spat out a stream of blood, its body bubbling as if it had been exposed to high levels of radiation.\n‘It’s the necklace!’\nIt was easy to find the culprit. The necklace around his neck was generating a shaped light that was bombarding the driver demon.\n“I gotta get out, I gotta get out—!”\nJust as the demon was about to open the door and get out, President Zhao realized he was fucked and stopped him.\n“Ah, no, there’s a bunch of reporters outside, if you go out—!”\nZhao unknowingly grabbed the driver’s hand.\nHe thought of the disaster that would happen if the people discovered that his driver was a demon and the end of his political life.\n“Ah, no—, let go, let go, ah—!”\nAnd to his surprise, the demon could not escape his old grasp and began to shudder, slowly turning to ash and disappearing.\n“——”\nWatching the scene, President Zhao was at a loss for words, his eyes filled with fear. The only people in the limousine were the ashen driver demon and himself.\nZhao brushed off the ash and moved to the driver’s seat.\n‘I’m going to have nightmares tonight.’\n* * * *\n“Pour! Drink!”\n“Gulp~! Opa, stop!”\nDrinking with a woman younger than his daughter would not be too much of a denial for a politician.\n“Heh, heh, heh, what do you think, President, isn’t the water good today?”\nSmirking and wiggling his fat ass, was the head of the Iranian administration.\n‘I used to hang out with him because we had similar hobbies.’\nToday, he’s here to meet an idol trainee he’s going to introduce to him.\n“Mr. Shi Yan, when is the idol trainee you’re going to introduce me to coming out?”\n“Uhhhhh— Not in a hurry. I’ve got them waiting for you outside!”\nWith a wave of his hand, the door opened and a dazzling beauty walked in.\nHair like silver melted down and stretched into threads, eyes that sparkled like large amethysts. Her bewitching smile made his old heart flutter.\n“Oh, she’s so beautiful, Shi Yan, you’ve done something great!”\nSuch a stunning beauty is an idol trainee, and if she took a selfie and posted it on SNS, she would be considered the most beautiful woman of the year.\nHe sighed to himself as he saw the aura of a woman he wanted to reach out and touch, but didn’t dare.\n“Really, it’s the same thing in every world.”\nIt was a different world, a modern, unfamiliar culture, but Beatrice recognized it as a symbol of the pleasures of any world.\nAlcohol, drugs, and sex appealed to the most primal of human pleasures, and Beatrice had burned too many handsome men, beauties, and slimy, floundering degenerates.\n“Desire must be tempered.”\nShe couldn’t help but be offended by this excess of pleasure and the corruption it caused.\nPeople sold their family, country and even world, because they couldn’t control their primal needs.\nBut apart from that, work is work. Beatrice had to extract the information she needed from this degenerate.\n“So–shall we begin?”\n“Hmph, your voice is heavenly~”\nAs Zhao drooled and looked at her with dirty eyes, Beatrice smirked.\n“Rest assured, you will ‘never’ wake up until tomorrow morning. First—shall we start with your nails?”\nIt didn’t take long for the sweet dream to turn into a nightmare.\n* * * *\nThe Demon of Pleasure and Decadence Archduke Quai was busy preparing for the ‘banquet’.\nA demon from his secretary’s office approached him and reported.\n“The demon who was the chauffeur of the president has been extinguished.”\nDemons dressed in human skins have been assigned to key figures in the country, including President Zhao.\nDuring Leon’s visit kept they tried to stay as far away from the TTG Temple as possible, but——\n“Who did this?”\n“The Present said it was the necklace he was given.”\n“That——”\nOf course, it’s true that demons are reluctant to wear items imbued with holy power. But to have even a lowly demon vanish in an instant when a mere necklace of stardust is placed in front of them?\n“It wasn’t that bad even in Lionheart.”\nThere must be some other trick up his sleeve. At Quay’s nonchalance, the assistant demon, somewhat impatient, said.\n“Do you want me to instruct him to remove the necklace?”\n“No, it’s too late. He’s probably up to something.”\n“Well, that means——”\n“He’s already realized we’re here, so maybe he’s just waiting for us to make the first move.”\n“——!”\nThe secretary demon purred in fear and Quai sighed as he watched the scene unfold.\nWho could frighten immortal demons so much?\nThe Magician Queen was a formidable foe, but it was the Lionheart King who was truly terrifying.\nA terror that neither the immortality of the demons, nor their great magic, nor their overwhelming numbers could subdue.\nIt would take more than strength to defeat him.\n“Let us speed up the preparations for the banquet, for it must be ready by the twenty-first.”\n“Will that— work? Even the Lord is dead——”\nWhat Quai was preparing for was a power greater than any that could corrupt any being.\nNo mortal had ever stood before that terrible castle of corruption, symbolizing the Lord of Pleasure and Decadence.\nDothraddon, who had never imagined that he would be defeated by a single mortal in a mortal world that was all but destroyed, died without ever being able to use it.\n“Well, I’m not Dothradon, so I can understand your anxiety.”\nBesides, it’s not the Demon Lord who’s preparing the banquet now, but Archduke, Quay.\nWithout the new Lord of Pleasure, Beatrice, there was no one else to unleash its full power.\n“But hey, even I can push just one person over the edge.”\nThe Lionheart King made a mistake.\nA fatal mistake.",

      "content": "Chapter 167: Deus Ex Machina\nOctober 10th. Twelfth Day. This national holiday commemorates the revolution that led to the establishment of the Republic of China.\nIt’s a national holiday celebrated by most of the 53 countries on the mainland, with the exception of non-Han Chinese autonomous regions such as Uyghur and Tibet, and it’s also a big day of festivities in Taiwan.\n“Wow, it’s crazy out there.”\n“I’ve never seen such a large parade outside of an amusement park. It’s nothing compared to Disneyland.”\nThe city streets are closed to civilian traffic and filled with colorful kites, parade floats, and flag-waving citizens.\nSixty years after their independence from the mainland was threatened, Taiwanese pride in their newfound independence is immense.\nSo much so that they celebrate their biggest holiday, the Twelfth Day, by inviting international celebrities.\n“Don’t be shy. A knight of the Lionheart King should be able to relax and enjoy a banquet of this magnitude.”\nLeon turned his attention to Ha-ri and the other knights, who wanted to open the limo window. Beatrice smirked at the sight.\n“It’s only natural for young knights to want to enjoy the festivities, isn’t it, Your Majesty?”\n“This king used to go to jousting tournaments and serf festivals to earn his keep, not like these brats.”\n“Your Majesty?”\n“What?”\nHa-ri raised her hand, and Leon waved the question away.\n“I think I know what a jousting tournament is, but what is a serf festival?”\n“Hmm, good question. I’m planning on doing one with Lord Spinner someday.”\nHa-ri felt uneasy when Leon mentioned Yappy.\n“To explain this festival, we must first consider its origins. Sir Gratas, the Holy Knight, a giant slayer and author of the book How to Slay Giants with Serfs…”\nIn the past, the Lionheart Kingdom launched a continent-wide Night War when there was no empire yet, barbarians and demonic followers flooded the chaotic continent, along with mounted peoples from the east.\nCrushing so many enemies naturally led to a surplus of serfs, whose numbers approached the total population of the Lionheart Kingdom.\nThis was despite taking no prisoners on the battlefield.\n“So Lord Gratas had an idea: instead of just killing them, let’s consume them as tribute to the gods.”\nThus began the hunt for the giants, a powerful fighting race that was growing in numbers on the continent at the time.\nLord Gratas led his serfs on a charge and hunted the giants to extinction, among other feats.\nThe result is Leon’s manual, How to Hunt Giants with Serfs.\n“It was in honor of Lord Gratas’ exploits that the Serf Festival spread like wildfire throughout the kingdom.”\n“Uh— Well, then?”\n“Please tell me that’s not true.”\nHa-ri and Jae-hyuk deny reality but with a shaky voice, Soo-ho spoke the truth.\n“Are you referring to the nationwide serf consumption festival, the—?”\n“That’s right.”\nGod–no, Arianna, God.\nThe three of them remembered the Templar election, when they’d been given a single dagger and sent on a suicidal rampage against giants.\nAnd they did that on a national scale?\nLeon turned his gaze to Chun So-yeon, leaving the three in a daze.\n“Chun So-yeon, do you have a good idea?”\nHe’d enlisted So-Yeon in this madness?\n“Yes.”\nShe prepared that?!\n“Ho-oh, this king should have organized the regional serf festivals for you, do you already have any new ideas outside of those?”\n“I think a serf war would be a good idea.”\n“A serf war?”\nLeon sounded intrigued while the three knights stared at the leader of the Knight Order, who had just come up with a terrible idea.\nNevertheless, Chun So-yeon shyly pitched her idea.\n“There’s a 500-year-old tradition in Korea called the Daejanggunjeon, where you hang a serf and use it as an aerial explosion with firecrackers──”\nThe three of them shuddered as they listened to the details.\n‘What? Is Chun So-yeon crazy?’\n‘So-yeon is scary these days——She’s a bit too eager to please——‘\n‘It’s not eagerness, it’s craziness!’\nLooking back, it was Chun So-yeon who was the most active and ruthless when it came to capturing giants with serfs. She wasn’t the head of the Knights of the Ten Thousand Gods for nothing!\n“Uh, what do you think? It’s a unique way to combine local culture, and I’m going to ask the Japanese about it.”\n‘Don’t combine local culture with this! Lionheart is enough!’\n‘Do you have to be that broken to be a Knight Order Leader?’\nIf the serfs had heard them, they would have trembled, but Leon simply slapped his knee in satisfaction.\n“Good, good, that’s easier to understand than Lord Spinner wanting to hold a maximum overclocking contest with his modified serf netrunner, ah~ Beatrice, what did you say you had in store for us?”\n“I’m ashamed to say, but I’ve been enjoying zombie movies lately— I’ve decided to have the contestants go through zombie survival armed with stellar armor──”\n“Hmph—! I guess I’ll have to do something about this, too. Lord Vulcanus will just throw the serfs far away like he does every year, and Lionheart’s pride will be on your shoulders!”\n‘Please don’t cheer her up with that!’\n‘You’re all crazy!’\nI found myself wishing I could get out of this crazy place, but the limo just kept going along its set path.\n“By the way, Your Majesty, we are not the only invited guests.”\n“This is an important national holiday in this country. It’s not unusual to invite guests from all over the world——.”\n“Maybe they’re trying to restrict our behavior.”\nThe guests are invited from all over the world to come together and enjoy a banquet. From what I hear, it’s quite different from what they’re used to.\n“Hmph, this king won’t be held back by mere hostages.”\nWe’ve already confirmed that Zhao is a minion of the demons and extracted the information so the operation would proceed as planned.\n“Lord Yappy and Park Yong-shin will be able to handle themselves, and the others are on standby.”\n“The question is how they will react in the banquet hall.”\n“You’ll have to be careful, the Demons of Pleasure and Corruption aren’t particularly combative demons——”\n“They’re just as dirty, I know.”\nLeon had been able to single-handedly defeat the Lord of Pleasure, Dothraddon, in part because the demons of their kind were weaker than the demons of Wisdom and Chaos.\nBut the demons of Pleasure and Decadence are more than capable of using all manner of ugly and vile tricks.\nIn some ways, they were the most dangerous demons of all, wearing human skin, carrying out sabotage behind closed doors, and corrupting the highest echelons of society.\n“We’re going to have to meet this one head-on, and you know it, and yet you’ve come to this island in person.”\n“Of course. How well does Your Majesty know the Corrupted Archduke Quai?”\n“Not very well. After the fall of the Lord of Wisdom, they fled to the Demon Gate.”\nAkasha, the Slaughter Archduke, is a prime example. He was marching toward the Eastern Sky Kingdom instead of Lionheart, and when the Lord fell, he fled through the Demon Gate.\nIn addition, Archduke Glacier fled to escape Vulcanus, and the Archdukes Lust and Wisdom died at the hands of Leon.\n“So he is the only survivor of the Demon Archdukes who fought in that war.”\nArchduke Corruption Quay had heard the rumors, and so had Leon. They were the ones who had corrupted the Empire through the Wisdom Palace and the Cult of Pleasure.\nBut he was not easily seen on the battlefield, and Lionheart’s knights continued their futile pursuit of the Fallen Archduke.\n“He came to my world after he escaped from your world, and it took him less than fifty years to destroy ours.”\nBeatrice was the most powerful magician in her world, but she was powerless to do anything against Quai.\nBy the time she was born, most of the kingdoms had fallen.\nShe had been fighting demons since she was old enough to attend elementary school on Earth.\n“They prey on people’s weaknesses and deceive them. Countless generals, kings, and nobles have fallen at their hands. If I had more time, I would have done the same——.”\n“With the artifact given by the Queen—is it irresistible?”\nChen So-yeon pointed to the earring on her ear. It was an artifact made with the power of dreams that had once trapped even the Slaughter Archduke Akasha.\nBeatrice had distributed artifacts that protected this spirit, in the form of bracelets, necklaces, and earrings, to all the knights of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.\nWhen asked if the Fallen Archduke could be blocked in a similar fashion, Beatrice shook her head in denial.\n“The artifact is a prototype that was distributed to key figures in a similar fashion, albeit at a lower power level. It worked against moderately high level demons, but even the Archdemons were highly resistant——”\nIt didn’t work on the Fallen Archduke Quai so Beatrice spoke again, this time with caution.\n“He shows his targets what they want most and extends an irresistible hand, so beware of the Corruption Pact he offers.”\n* * * *\nThe ballroom of a five-star hotel in the capital city of Taipei was filled with politicians, celebrities, and influencers from around the world.\nEach person entering the ballroom was dressed in traditional attire, including hanfu and cheongsam, a colorful display of Taiwan’s centrality to Chinese culture.\n“It’s easy to move around in, and I like the colorfulness.”\n“I’ve never worn a Chinese dress before, but, um— I might be more embarrassed than I thought.”\nHa-ri spins around to look at the red silk cheongsam.\nHa-ri, Beatrice, and Leon are not the only ones who have changed into traditional Chinese clothing.\nThis was partly because the dress code for the banquet was traditional Han Chinese clothing, and partly because Taiwan has a similar tendency to dress its heads of state in hanbok for photos, as is customary in Korea.\n“Though you have come to hunt demons, this is a show of state. You are the knights of the Lionheart, and you will behave accordingly.”\nIt was time for Leon to call the worshippers of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods to attention while in the distance, President Zhao sought him out with his entourage.\n“Your Majesty, are you here?”\nPresident Zhao looked a little shaken. He should have been in good shape for a national holiday.\n“President Zhao. You don’t look well, do you?”\n“Oh, yeah— I haven’t gotten much sleep lately.”\nLeon patted President Zhao on the shoulder with a smiling face.\nOf course, the reason he was shaken was because of the nightmares he’d been having the past few days.\nHe had vomited up information through a medium planted by Beatrice, the High Priestess of Dreams and Death.\nHe was never able to find out if there was some sort of embargo on the identity of the Fallen Archduke Quay, but the information he knew of as president allowed him to place “martyrs” at key points.\nHe would not know that until the end since Beatrice’s visions manipulated even his memory.\n“It’s a beautiful day, by the way.”\n“Yeah? Oh, it is, isn’t it? This nice weather it’s a good sign.”\n“Yeah, it’s definitely a good sign.”\nFor some reason, Zhao found that smile frightening.\n“By the way, where is Lord Vulcanus-”\nAt that moment, a group of men burst through the doors of the banquet hall.\n“What, what, you people!”\n“Guards, what are the guards──!”\nThey entered the ballroom in a flash and took over the hotel. How did they take over the ballroom so quickly, which was supposed to be a huge place with tons of VIPs?\nThere wasn’t even a shot fired. Among the guards were hunters from a large Taiwanese hunter guild that had been hired for the occasion!\nFrom the center of the ruffians a man hooded and cloaked stepped forward.\n“Greetings, gentlemen. On this rare day, you’ll have to excuse me.”\nThe man’s demeanor was polite, like a gentleman, but who knows. Anyone who can be polite in a dramatic situation is probably a nutcase.\n“You–! You know where you are!”\nJust then, a group of men confronted the intruders. They were not from the Taiwanese military or police.\n“Guild Leader Lan Fang!”\nLan Fang, one of Taiwan’s top S-class hunters, and his guild, hired by the Taiwanese administration to guard the banquet, were not to be intimidated by a few terrorists!\n“I don’t know where these bastards came from, but they made a mistake!”\nGuild Leader Lan Fang raised his greatsword and leapt at the first man who appeared to be the leader.\nHe realized that in order to prevent the guests from being injured, he had to take out the leader quickly.\n“Die!”\nLan Fang’s greatsword was imbued with domineering magic. It slammed into the man’s body and──\n-Bang!\nA crashing sound like iron being struck was heard and at the same time, the robe was torn open, revealing a hidden figure.\n“——!”\nIt was an item called ‘heavy armor’, which is quite alien to Hunters who value technology and speed.\nUnless it was a drop item of exceptional performance, it was shunned for being heavy and blunt, but——.\n‘He simply blocked my blow?’\nWhat was even more surprising was how hard it was, even after blocking an S-class Hunter’s blow, it was not damaged in the slightest.\n“Hoo hoo, I have the honor of testing the prototype of an item that will be dedicated to the Great Lord. The sword of an unbeliever will not be able to wound this armor.”\nThe man flashed a large mace and Lan Fang, who hadn’t expected the terrorist leader to possess Legendary armor, was dumbfounded and took the blow of the mace.\n“Huh~ Good thing you’re strong.”\nThe man who had subdued the Guild Leader with a single blow shouted at the hesitant guild members.\n“You’d better not move a finger, although I did give you a thumping once to set an example——”\nBehind the man, the men stepped forward in unison, each turning their robes over to reveal their fearsome tools.\n“Po, bombs!”\n“Madmen!”\nThe terrorists were all wearing bomb vests.\n-Bam! Banquet hall overrun. Moved on to the next phase.\nAnd at the same time.\n-Aaaah! Terrorists!\n-What, what! Why are there terrorists here?\n-Cosplay?\nAll over Taiwan over a thousand terrorists have appeared in major cities.\n“”Because the gods willed it!””\nFanatics.",

      "content": "Chapter 168: Arianna and Akbar\nTaipei’s beautiful Hua Hua Park.\nWith a huge shopping center and beautiful views of Taipei’s cityscape, this place was packed with customers for the Chinese New Year.\n“Mom, I want that!”\nNormally, the pricey items in department stores are a burden, but on this day, parents open their wallets to the expensive toys their children want.\nShopping malls held special events for such parents and offered gift certificates as lures to attract more people to their malls.\nIt’s the finale of a holiday season where spending is more intense than usual. While happily sipping tea after purchasing her child’s toys and luxury handbags, Ms. Shuery noticed some suspicious cosplayers in the crowd.\nAt first, she thought they were parading through the streets in cosplay to celebrate the Twelfth Festival, but as one of them gradually approached her teahouse, she was able to recognize their unusual coloring.\nNeat white robes—only the abdomen is bulging.\nIt reminded him of someone from Central Asia.\nNo, no, no.\nHer uneasy hunch was becoming more and more realized as the man stepped into the center of the teahouse.\n“God.”\nThe muttered word was all she needed to hear.\n‘Why? Why? Why are they in Taiwan?’\nWhy, over and over again. But when her eyes locked with the man’s, what came out of her lips was a pitiful plea.\n“Please——.”\nPlease don’t do this. What have we done wrong? Children deserve better than——.\nIt was a “please” with a lot of desperation in it. But Mr. Shuery lost all hope with the one word the man with the bomb switch said with a smirk.\n“Because the gods want it.”\nNo hesitation, no guilt, just a calm voice. The eyes of a fanatic convinced he was on a pilgrimage.\n“Mommy?”\nThe daughter, playing with a new toy, looked up, sensing her mother’s strangeness.\n“Meiling, Mommy loves you!”\nAll Shuery could do was hug her child and hope it would hurt a little less.\n-Beep!\nKaaaaaaaaaah!\nThere were explosions everywhere.\n-Bang! Boom! Quack!\nAnd the sound echoed throughout Taiwan. Cheers turned to screams as explosions erupted from every direction in the crowded, festive city.\nThe whole of Taiwan was covered in a “white mist.”\n“Hmph—!”\nMs. Shuery opened her tightly closed eyes while holding her daughter Meiling but the pain she was expecting didn’t come.\nWhat she saw was a dense white mist.\n“Poison gas?”\nBombs aren’t the only method of terrorism. Biological terrorism through poison gas was also rare, but it did happen.\n“Mommy, you look beautiful!”\n“Meiling, don’t breathe!”\nMs. Shuery hastily covered his daughter’s and his own mouths, but then she saw that they were unable to react to the sudden gas attack around them and could only inhale.\n‘I’m going to die!’\nIn the midst of the chaos, Mr. Shuery pushed aside his frustration and searched for a gas mask. She had heard that gas masks were available in large facilities like shopping malls.\nHowever, it was difficult for an ordinary person who was not familiar with emergency exits or the location of gas masks to find one, and eventually the child who couldn’t find his breath inhaled.\n“Kolok—!”\n“Meiling! No!”\nThat’s it! She inhaled!\nAnd it was the same for Mr. Shuery, who shouted to stop his daughter.\n“Huh?”\nIt’s weird.\nIt doesn’t hurt.\nMr. Shuery belonged to a generation that was taught basic evacuation procedures from childhood in case of air raids and chemical warfare by mainlanders.\nIn the case of chemical warfare, they were taught that the moment the gas is swallowed through the airway, there is an immediate reaction. But——\n‘Didn’t anyone in the mall get hurt?’\n“Krrrrrrrr!”\nThat was it. Ms. Shuery spotted a man lying on the ground in the middle of the mall and rushed over to him.\n“Hey, are you okay?”\nHis condition was exactly like the poison gas victim in the video. She didn’t know why he was injured like this, but she had to hurry and take him to the hospital──\n“Hic—!”\nSuddenly, confronted with a person in distress, Shuery stepped back in horror, for he was—not in human form, no matter how she looked at it.\nHis face was melting into a hideous, almost ‘demonic’ face that was too hideous to be caused by a skin rash from the poisonous gas.\n“Kyaaaaak—!”\n“Kyaaah!”\nThe devilish, haggard monster was about to pounce on Ms. Shuery but something slammed into him.\n“Step back.”\n“Go, thanks—?”\nMs. Shuery realized that he was the terrorist she had made eye contact with before.\nUndaunted in this white haze, armed with armor and cold weapons, he shouted at the ‘demon’.\n“God help us.”\nAnd he wasn’t the only one armed. As if waiting in the wings, white-armored terrorists swarmed in from all directions.\n“Crrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!”\nThe instantly surrounded demon had a look on his face that said, “How the hell?”\n“You must be quite a high-ranked demon to still be alive after being directly hit by the holy gas.”\n“However, there is no need to fear brothers and sisters. They will be extinguished in the name of God.”\n“Defeat evil with death! The gods will lead our martyred comrades to paradise!”\n“As the gods will it!”\n“”May the gods will it—!””\nFanatics from all sides pounded the weakened demon.\nShuery had never seen anything like it.\n* * * *\nTerrorists attacked the banquet hall where the dignitaries were gathered.\nThe S-class Hunter Lan Fang was instantly subdued, and even the remaining guild members stopped moving in front of the terrorists with bomb vests.\n“Eek—cowards!”\nThe Hunters hired as guards could only hesitate. Not only were the terrorists militant, but they were also dangerous to the dignitaries if they detonated the bomb.\nThere were too many heads of state gathered here to risk a hostage or two.\n“What do you want?”\n“What do you want——?”\nThe terrorist leader said, his voice still calm.\n“We’ll have to tie you all up first.”\nThe terrorists quickly tied up the hostages, many of whom were cardinals from the Vatican, vice prime ministers and ministers from European Union countries, and hunters from famous guilds.\n“Ah, those Hunters, you’ll have to wear these shackles.”\n“That, that’s——.”\nIt was the magic seals for criminal Hunters developed by the Tower. What kind of terrorist would prepare such expensive equipment in large quantities?\n“Ugh—! It’s heavy!”\n“Chit— is it new?”\nWhat they didn’t know was that it was actually a god-blessed stellar iron shackle, a worse-than-real fake that merely recreated the magic seal.\nThey approached Leon and Beatrice at the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods and tried to put the shackles on them.\n“Well, well— I’ll put them on.”\n“I’ll, I’ll put them on.”\nThe terrorist half-speaks and is immediately corrected by a stern stare. For a moment, people expect Leon to do something.\nAfter all, he didn’t tolerate disrespect for royalty, and he possessed the raw power of an S-class Hunter.\n“Hmph, cowardly of them to take hostages, I guess we have no choice but to comply.”\n“That’s right, everyone, don’t be cowardly and do as you’re told.”\nThat was it. Even TTG Temple was unable to resist because of the hostages.\nHaving subdued all the dignitaries, the terrorists ordered the hostages.\n“Lock everyone in their rooms! Move quickly!”\n“His Majesty Lionheart and Queen Spero, please cooperate.”\nIn what seemed like a different temperature of hostage treatment, the hostages were grouped into hotel rooms in the ballroom.\n“Please enter.”\nIn the room where the group is sequestered, the terrorist leader removes his helmet to reveal his bare face.\n“Thank you for your service, Your Majesties, and the members of the TTG Temple.”\nThe leader of the terrorists was Park Yong-shin, who knelt down on one knee in front of Leon and bowed his head.\n“You may have ordered it, but I cannot forgive my disrespect for your Jade Body.”\n“It is done. Rise.”\nThe four knights, including Ha-ri, were dumbfounded as they watched.\n“Uhm— Your Majesty, what’s going on here?”\n“I noticed it halfway through, but——.”\nThe four couldn’t keep up with the situation so Park Yong-shin cheerfully began to explain.\nSince arriving in Taiwan, he and Yappy have been organizing nationwide terrorism with the members of the Taiwan branch of the Hanbit Palace and giving them bomb vests.\nThe terrorism here is nothing compared to what’s going on outside, he said.\n“Po, bomb vests?”\n“Well, there’s nothing to be afraid of, Sister Ha-ri. It’s a gas bomb, to be precise.”\n“It’s worse than that!”\nOf course, it’s not really poison gas. More accurately, it’s holy gas.\n“It’s a dilution of holy water, forged by Lord Yappy and bestowed by His Majesty, though the concentration has been thinned to ensure a large quantity.”\nAfter testing it on the captured demons, not only were the lower-ranked demons greatly weakened, but even some of the higher-ranked demons had no choice but to reveal their faces.\n“Ah—, so this was to deal with the demons in Taiwan!”\n“Exactly.”\nBy now, the whole of Taiwan must be in an uproar. There are demons here and there whose identities have been discovered.\n“But it’s just a way for them to show their true colors. There’s more to them.”\n“Yes, because High Demons can withstand the Holy Gas.”\nBeatrice smirked and checked her pad. Hidden camera footage of each room, sent by Yappy.\n“Let’s get started, then.”\nLeon stood up.\nIt was demon hunting time, albeit a bit radical.\n* * * *\nDoldorad, a high-level demon of pleasure and depravity, was locked in a cabin with a group of Taiwanese dignitaries who had been taken hostage.\n“Chief Huang Yanfei, do something!”\n“What do you want me to do?”\n“Chief, don’t you have a riot police hotline, you can call them and let them know what’s going on over here—!”\nDoldorad wanted to kill this fool right then and there, but for now, he had to play the part of the chief of Taiwan’s police department. It would be a shame to reveal his identity here.\n“I’ve been calling them since earlier but I think there’s jamming in the area.”\nThe same was true for smartphones and other non-network dependent radios.\nThere must be equipment around here that neutralizes military frequencies.\n“Damn it, where is the Fallen Archduke?\nWiping out those terrorists wouldn’t be difficult, but then came the problem. If he acted now and took them out, he’d have to kill everyone in this place.\nIt was too much to ask that the work of the Fallen Archduke should be judged by him, not even by the Archdemons.\n‘We have to get in touch with the outside world somehow!’\nAs Doldorad searched high and low for a way out, a door burst open and a familiar face appeared.\n“Your Majesty?”\nIt was Leon, who looked around the room and then stepped right into the middle of it.\n‘He didn’t realize who I am?’\nDoldorad swallowed hard in fear as the most prolific demon slayer stood before him but then he grasped the bracelet on his wrist like a lifeline.\n‘It can’t be! I’m wearing a magic-hiding artifact crafted by the Archdemons of Wisdom and Exploration, and not even he can see through it!’\nThis was why there were so many demons in Leon’s presence.\nDeveloped and distributed by the Wisdom Goblin Archdemon, these artifacts that suppress and conceal magical energy were supplied in large quantities by the American Demon Master Reynald Sherman.\nThey would be consumed in real time in front of Leon, a powerful divinity, but that meant they could escape Leon’s intuition until the artifacts were destroyed!\n“Let’s start with this room.”\nLeon summoned a grail from subspace and focused his power into it──\n-Pow!\nA wave of light spread through the room and struck Doldorad.\n“Kuchek!”\nThe holy water from the Holy Grail, the raw material for the holy gas, the undiluted and intact wave literally killed Doldorad, a high-level demon.\n“Chief Huang Yanfei?!”\n“No way, the chief is a demon!”\nThe ministers were stunned that the high-ranking official sitting next to them was a demon while Leon pointed his holy sword at the trembling Doldorad.\n“Time to go, you filthy thing.”\n“————.”\nAs the holy sword struck, Doldorad thought to himself.\n‘He’s such a fucking bastard.’",

      "content": "Chapter 169: Raid on Taiwan\n“The banquet hall was attacked?”\nQuai looked puzzled at the news that the banquet hall where President Zhao had gone to receive state guests had been attacked by terrorists.\n“That’s a big one.”\nThe hostages had been taken to constrain Leon’s behavior, as he had invited a large number of heads of state for the National Day celebration.\n‘I can’t believe they’re taking hostages.’\nThe question is, would the high-ranking demons we had infiltrating the ballroom have been seen by them——\n‘They’d do it because they were confident.’\nCan we leave the high-ranking demons inside as castaways?\n“This is a problem, but what’s more annoying is——.”\nReports from across Taiwan of gas attacks and demons being gassed and unmasked.\nWhatever the means, it’s a full-blown attack of the status quo.\nIt would not be out of place to declare emergency martial law at this point but the Commander-in-Chief, who has the authority to do this, is being held hostage in a ballroom.\n“Who are the remaining senior officials?”\n“The Ministry, the Deputy President, the General Staff, and the Gendarmerie Command are on the move.”\n“The Naval Land Forces, made up of fallen, can be mobilized at a moment’s notice.”\nA surprise attack on civilian targets had robbed them of their players, but this was their home turf.\nThe military units deployed across Taiwan would soon be at their beck and call, and there were plenty of demons in their midst.\nAnd if they’re willing to give up everything you’ve worked for, there’s nothing stopping them from making a “last resort” move.\nThis island, Taiwan, is a swamp that will bury the Lionheart. From the moment they entered this place in small numbers and without much power, they had fallen into a trap.\n“Archduke—!”\nIt was then that henchmen who had been in real-time contact with the State Security Bureau, military units, and even the police station reported urgently.\n“Beheader—! The Butcher has appeared!”\nBeheader of the War God. There is no demon who does not know of its prestige.\nThe Lionheart King, the Orc High King, and the Butcher were monsters in that world that even the Archdukes could not defeat.\n“How could he have missed the timing of the demon’s appearance in the city?”\nBut he’s alone. No matter how much transcendent power he possesses, he is still an individual.\n“Mobilize all the forces we can. We have to control the situation.”\nThey still have a point. No matter how much they regard the entire Taiwanese government as a den of demons, the demons hiding in this country are only a few.\nEven the most fanatical of them won’t be able to get away with slaughtering all the innocent soldiers and police officers.\nThey are, after all, a people of high-minded legality.\nIs this a Lionheart stereotype? Or is it prejudice?\nIt’s just that this stereotype doesn’t include the Holy Knights.\n“grararararara──!!”\nA great violence was coming.\n* * * * *\nThe whole of Taiwan was reeling from the gas attack and the appearance of demons.\n“It doesn’t look like there’s any harm in inhaling it——.”\nDespite wearing the fire suits and masks provided by the army, the white gas did not harm the public, as evidenced by the citizens walking around unharmed.\n“It seems like the only ones being harmed are the demons?”\n“Demons were hiding in my country——”\nThe city was gassed and demons appeared, while the banquet hall for state guests at Honbi Bai Mountain was occupied by terrorists.\nHas there been a state of emergency of this magnitude since the founding of Taiwan?\n“A militant group is engaging the demons? Who are they? What, the gas attackers?”\n“Deal with the terrorists—! No, the demons first! What? Deal with the terrorists first? What do you mean?”\nIt was pandemonium.\nThe Vice President’s declaration of a state of emergency set the entire 160,000-strong Taiwanese army into motion.\nNot only the Taiwanese military, but also private hunters. In effect, the full power of the island was being mobilized.\nWith emergency sirens blaring, key generals huddled together to take command of the situation at the Taiwanese Army General Headquarters.\n“Commander, the Navy says they’ve mobilized their land forces.”\n“The Northern 6th Corps has also reported that they can send vehicle units first. With Lanyang’s 51st Division joining them, I don’t think we’ll have a problem stabilizing Taipei.”\n“That’s right, but what about the guilds, what happened to the Lan Fang guild leader who was guarding the banquet hall?”\nLiu Wei, a senior officer (colonel) in the Taiwanese Army, looked somewhat uneasy at the appearance of the commander-in-chief, Lu Xianzhu.\nHe had been breaking out in a cold sweat since he received the news from the President’s secretary and was wiping it off with a handkerchief.\n‘What’s wrong with him?’\nThe general was normally a competent man. Usually, those connected to the political upper echelons rise through the ranks on merit, not ability, but Lu Xianzhu is a case of both ability and background.\nAlways cool and seemingly beyond humanity, it’s unnatural to see him fidgeting.\n“Huh? What is he doing here?”\nLiu Wei was puzzled when he spotted “Armor” arguing with a gendarme at the entrance to the General Headquarters.\nAt Liu Wei’s words, the assembled generals checked the CCTV footage.\n“Lord Vulcanus?”\nThe Holy Knight of the TTG Temple who had arrived in Taiwan less than a week ago was entering the base, ignoring the gendarmes at the entrance to the General Headquarters.\n“Is he looking this way?”\nOn one of the cameras Vulcanus’ gaze is eerie as he makes direct eye contact with the CCTV. He fidgeted as if searching for something, then strode forward.\nCreepily, it was in the direction of the General Staff.\n“Uh, don’t you think he’s coming this way?”\nSomeone said and Chief Lu Xianzhu ordered.\n“Ma, stop him! Stop him!”\nMr. Lu Xianzhu freaks out as if the executioner is coming but in the next moment, Vulcanus disappeared from the camera.\n“Uh, where did he go──!”\n-Quang!\nThe outer wall of the command center collapsed with a loud crash. After smashing the missile-proof outer wall of the military base with his torso, he dusted himself off and stepped through the opening he had created.\nThe words “You’re a monster” didn’t come out of Liu Wei’s mouth. However, with a desperate soldier’s spirit, he blocked Vulcanus as he strode toward him.\n“Lord Vulcanus, what the hell are you doing, this is a military base!”\n“I know!”\nLiu Wei and the other officers in the base tried desperately to stop the behemoth, but it was no use.\n“Sir, Commander, the order is—!”\nLiu Wei waited for orders from the top commander of the position, Senior General Lu Xianzhu.\nSince they had already raided the military base, there would be no point in shooting them, but the status of the opponent and their terrible strength made it difficult to react.\nBut if he gave the order, everyone here would draw their pistols and turn against him.\n“——Commander?”\nLiu Wei and the other soldiers looked for the commander, who didn’t answer.\nAnd they weren’t the only ones. Most of the generals and officers in the General Headquarters were gone!\n‘They ran away?!’\nThese bastards, so-called soldiers, ran away?\nHe was about to curse at the absurdity of it all when a blast of heat came from Vulcanus, his fiery gaze, rumored to be the Inferno Eye, leaking out of his armor!\n“Stop!”\n“I do not take orders from those weaker than me!”\n“What are you talking about?”\n“I don’t listen to orders from someone weaker than me!”\nLiu Wei pointed his pistol at him, but Vulcanus didn’t seem to mind in the slightest; he was the only one in the room with the will to resist.\n“Damn it—!”\nLiu Wei’s finger trembled as he pulled the trigger.\n-Bang!\n-Ting!\nOnly a hollow sound echoed, plunging everyone into silence.\n‘Damn, am I going to die?’\nIf Vulcanus snapped his fingers, his head would explode like a tofu.\nAs a soldier, he expected this since he refused to give up resistance.\n“GRARARARA──!”\nBut what came back was a roaring laugh.\n“Yes! That’s what a warrior should do, even if it’s not the wisest thing to do under the circumstances!”\nVulcanus, who had been pounding Liu Wei’s shoulder, chased after the fleeing generals without inflicting any harm on him.\n“——.”\nWith no one thinking to stop him, another transmission came into the dumbfounded General Command.\n“Reports of ‘knights’ emerging from bases all over the place!”\n“The Knights of the Burning Sword!”\n“Three under Laihar Dever have appeared at the Tenth Legion Command! They have also appeared at the Air Specialties Command. Sir Galatan, leading four knights, raiding the Special Forces Command!”\n“43rd Artillery Command neutralized! The Knights of the TTG Temple have appeared with the Man-At-Arms!”\nThat was it. The lights in the command center went out, along with all the other devices.\n“What, the power’s out?”\n“Why aren’t you running the auxiliary generators?”\n“No comms! Jamming, strong jamming!”\nThe base was neutralized in an instant.\n“Cyber warfare?”\nThe Taiwanese Commander-in-Chief–the country’s leading semiconductor industry–had its cyber warfare support units crippled?\nThe gas attack coincided with the hostage-taking of state dignitaries. Highly sophisticated hacking and raids across the country at that time.\nLiu Wei assumed the worst.\n“—against us——.”\nAll-out war.\n* * * *\n“Damn it, damn it, damn it!”\nLiu Xianzhu, Balbazar, the High Demon of Pleasure and Decadence ran desperately through the corridors of the base.\n‘He’s noticed me! How the hell?!’\nBalbazar realized that Vulcanus had pinpointed him.\nHe didn’t know what he did, but he must have gotten information about him!\n-grararararara──!\nHis doomed laughter rings out, and with every step he takes, he can almost hear the bell of his doom ringing.\n“Damn it!”\nHe no longer kept his disguise on. I, revealing the hideous pleasure demon Balbazar.\n“Ugh, ugh!”\n“Ah, a demon?!”\nThe officers and soldiers at the base were stunned, but he didn’t care. This was the end of the matter. He must create an opening for himself to escape.\n“Wake up—!”\nAt that moment, a certain officer he encountered blurted out something.\nHe was a member of the Pleasure Cult, a secret society within the Taiwanese military.\nHe was a member of a secret social organization within the Taiwanese army enslaved by the demons of pleasure and depravity, reveling in the endless pleasures they offered.\nAnd there were more such degenerates.\n“Oh, no.”\n“Oh, Lord Balbazar, what have you done—!”\nThe human flesh melted away, revealing their hideous forms. They rejoiced that they had escaped mortality and gained immortality, but panicked when their true identities were revealed at this time.\n“Stop him! Buy me a second!”\nAt the High Demon’s command, the Fallen rushed against their will toward the fiery knight across the hall.\nOne second for each of them. If I could stop him in his tracks, even for a moment-─\n“Ah——.”\nIt was an ignorant thought.\nNot even the magic of the Archduke of Glacier could stop that knight’s footsteps, let alone a bunch of fallen who had just become demons.\n-Kaaaaaah!!!\nWith a terrible heat, the Fallen are devoured, they could not last a moment before his boundless fury.\n“Aaah——.”\nHere he comes.\nHere comes the apostle of the War God.\nThe Lionheart’s right-hand man, a man who had survived the Lionheart King thirteen times.\nHis very existence is proof of his strength.\nVulcanus, a terror of the ages who tore through countless demons with no last name, no title, only the force of his two arms.\n“No one can stop Death.”\nHe is Death.\n* * * *\n“The bait is gone.”\n“It’s Quai’s fault. He must have known the information had already been compromised by the time Zhao was toyed with by the Queen.”\n“A small price to pay, I suppose.”\nAt the entrance to the site of the hostage crisis, three elderly men stood looking out over the quarantined hotel.\n“Do you think they’ll succeed?”\n“I don’t know. He’s the Lionheart King.”\n“But he’s still a human. It’s not impossible if he shows a little bit of vulnerability.”\nSince the fall of Lord Dothraddon, the Lord of Pleasure, the demons of pleasure and corruption have been led by the current Archduke of Pleasure, Quai.\nHe could have succeeded to the throne, but he refused, saying he had better things to do.\nThat’s basically how he is, unchecked by the Lord.\n“Ever since that war, we have been in decline.”\n“If the Hundred Years’ Great Line failed, we must make progress here.”\n“The last thing we need is to lose to ‘them’.”\nThe demons clad in the old man’s skin reveal themselves, their transformation different from that of the other demons.\nUnlike other demons, whose hides are limited only by the total amount of flesh they possess, their hides are made from magic.\nIn an instant, they revealed their true form, each one a giant monster over several meters tall.\n<Declaration of Territory – Temple of Pleasure>\n[Prepare for them. Isolate this place from them.]\n<Territory Declaration – Temple of Corruption>\n[Come, my legions, it is time to work.]\n<Summon Demon Gate>\nIn the center of Taipei City a giant gate has been created in the space where the parade used to be.\nCountless demons poured out of it.

      "content": "Chapter 170: Rally the Troops\nFor a long time, Taiwan has been under threat from the mainland.\nUnder the banner of a united China, the island was constantly threatened with invasion, so it fortified the entire island, built an army, and maintained tensions.\nBut China was broken.\nNot broken, but shattered.\nAs they watched the Chinese continent torn into 53 pieces, some of them lamented the horrors of dying by the hundreds of millions but Taiwan celebrated.\n-Good!\nThere are economic issues, export markets, and refugees, but the country has been saved from the brink.\nI don’t think it’s necessarily inhumane for the whole country to pop champagne and celebrate.\n-The mainland failed because it was too big. Look at the rest of the world. Even the most advanced nations can’t defend their large territories.\n-Unless you’re going to have a hunter air force like the U.S., it’s better to have a smaller land mass.\n-Let’s just defend our own land and leave the restoration of the mainland for later.\nIn practice, the smaller the land area, the faster the response to the gate, and the less likely it is that the gate will go undiscovered and be left to dungeon break, let alone the number of Hunter Awakenings relative to the population.\nThe only problem was food self-sufficiency, which was solved by the economic cooperation of the fragmented mainland tributary states.\nAfter all, Taiwan’s national strategy in the second millennium was to fortify the entire country.\nWatching out for the Dragon Palace Gate and quickly dispatching a raiding force to capture it if it occurs within the narrow territory.\nWith only a few thousand state-owned hunters, most of the gate problems were solved, and in the 30 years since the Cataclysm, Taiwan’s gate defense rate has been over 98%.\nIn fact, it was the best defense rate in the world and was the envy of mainlanders as a safe land.\nBut then——\n“What do you mean, the Sixth Army was annihilated?”\n“Demons? Demons, a demon gate in the middle of the capital?”\nTerrorism, the appearance of demons, the attack on the Taiwanese army by the Temple Ten Thousand Gods, the blocking of communications and the appearance of the Demon Gate.\nThanks to air strikes from the mainland and a Morse code communication network prepared for cyber-terrorist warfare, the main force had heard of the tragedy, but——\n“What, what’s going on?”\nEverything is a mess.\nThe gas attacks across the island are enough to warrant martial law, but demons are popping up everywhere, and the TTG Temple has raided military units.\nDemon gates have even been set up in the middle of Taipei for some reason.\nWith the General Command neutralized, there wasn’t much they could do. In the midst of everyone’s panic, the communications were unblocked and a mechanical sound began to be heard.\n-Yakt Spinner, Holy Knight of the Iron and Blacksmiths of TTG Temple.\nThe one-way communication brought shocking news.\nThe corruption of Taiwan’s highest echelons and the appearance of demons throughout the city along with the images of their slaughter forced a choice.\n-Foe or ally, make your choice.\nIt was a choice that could only be made in this moment, with the corrupted upper echelons removed to enforce obedience, communications cut off, and judgment left to them alone.\nThe isolated troops had to judge with the information they had.\n“We are now entering Taipei!”\n“Brigadier General!”\nSending troops into the capital without permission from the General Headquarters was a matter of treason if done wrong but the brigade commander wasn’t ordering the march because Yappy forced him to.\nSubjective judgment is not a virtue for a soldier, but he had seen the TTG Temple’s actions over the years.\n“Whatever the legitimacy of those demon-haters, the fact remains that the demons are their enemy.”\nDemons are the common enemy of mankind. That much is too clear. So why not——\n“Only TTG Temple can deal with demons and without their power, there is no way to close the Demon Gate in Taipei.”\nThe proof is in the puddle, as the Great Demons swarm like bees in a hive.\nThe brigadier was convinced he was right.\n* * * *\nOff the coast of the Taiwan Strait.\nThere was a time when both sides had deployed fleets and naval bases in the face of mainland threats and invasions.\nAfter the collapse and partition of the mainland, these had become obsolete, but warships still kept watch over the waters on sentry duty, and so it was even now.\nThe ‘ship’ was quietly slicing through the water, especially as sonar was actively searching for submarines.\n-Boom!\n(The order to scramble was given.)\n-BEEP!\n(Exiting submerged mode. Rising. Be careful not to be seen by the surrounding fleet.)\n-BEEP!\n(Their barbaric sonar systems will not be able to detect our stealthy submarine capabilities!)\nThe world’s most advanced nuclear-powered submarine, measuring a whopping two kilometers in length, slipped into the Tamsui River leading to the city of Taipei.\nThe Dominator-class submarine, a maritime armament platform built for TTG Temple global military operations and one of the decisive weapons created to defend the undersea city from the Demon Legion in the world of Yappy.\nIn its original form, it could single-handedly defeat the most powerful navy on Earth, the United States Navy.\nThat is, of course, when the Dominator is equipped with the Mobius-class plasma ballistic missiles or the GK8 Gauss cannon.\nEarth’s materials technology would have made such a thing impossible to manufacture, and the demons would have been fiercely resistant to such advanced weaponry.\nInstead, this Dominator-class submarine had something even more terrifying aboard.\n-Kiruruk!\n(This is commanded by my captain, Rudolph Cygraiman Pardo Nilpas!)\n-Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle!\n(First Assault Landing Team, Second Assault Landing Team, and Third Amphibious Support Squadron!)\n-Crackle──!\n(1st Assault Landing Battalion, Graemeon Andrew Maxiphers Clygent!)\n-Kiruuk──!\n(2nd Assault Landing Team Afkirah Naras Rosewide Freymion departs!)\nThe Kikiruks were descendants of proud resisters.\nAfter crossing over to Earth from the Eastern Dragon Palace Gate, they seemed to have adapted to life on Earth, conducting only small-scale land operations but their true calling is naval warfare.\nA naturally maritime race, they were blessed by Poma, the God of the Sea and Waves, and had the technical support of Yappy.\nThey’ve trained to be thoroughly armed, and now the time has come for an all-out war.\nHundreds of small, 500-ton submersibles emerged in unison, followed by a landing support aircraft battalion rising from the sea.\nThe targets were armored vehicles of the Taiwanese Navy’s Army Ground Force, en route to Taipei City under the direction of the Fallen Archduke Quai.\nIt was confirmed by President Zhao that all of them were demonic followers raised by demons.\n-Boom! Fire support from outer space.\nYappy, who had a perfect view of the entire Taiwanese territory, began attacking the land forces with charged particle artillery. The first to be exposed to the attack from space was the Army’s commander, Hsieh Ak-mada.\n-This, this—!\nYappy wondered if the High Demons could withstand a charged particle cannon.\nDozens were blown away in the raid, but a few demons dismounted and used magic to block the attack from space.\nAnd the moment they were distracted by space──\n-Kiruuuuuuuk!\n(We will open fire on the demons disguised as naval landing craft at the enemy landing zone!)\nThe first to arrive was the Landing Support Air Squadron. They flew through the sky in their jet engine booster suits, firing rocket cannons at the Naval Landing Force.\n-Kiruuuuk!\n(The gods will it!)\nHundreds of guided rockets rained down from the armored suits of the Kikiruks.\nThe army was on the move with tanks and armored vehicles, but they lost most of their armor to the hail of rockets.\n“Shit, fire, fire, fire!”\nThe armored vehicles and infantry that had survived the initial assault poured fire on the targets in the sky. But——.\n-Gods!\n(Gods protect us!)\nA protective holy law that nullified ranged weapons was used and the warriors who used it were knight-errant Kikiruk warriors who had even been sworn in by Leon.\n“A strange force has landed by the river, how many are there!”\nWhile the airborne battalion was mowing down the landing party, another landing party washed ashore.\nBut unlike the other landings, they didn’t get out of the submersibles, because the submersibles made a change on the spot.\n-Clunk, clunk, clunk!\nLike in a famous Hollywood robot movie, the landed submersibles transformed. Finally, they were equipped with wheeled wheels, making them excellent high-speed vehicles.\n-Chirp!\n-Chirp!\nHundreds of armored troops sprang up in an instant. The Kikiruks aimed their cannons through the open ceiling.\n-Kiruk! (Fire!)\nThousands of shells flew through the air.\nThe naval landing force quickly crumbled before the massive firepower of the landing force.\nBut it wasn’t just the Naval Landing Force that was headed to support the Archdemons of Taipei City.\nThe number of fallen troops had been taken over by the demons and were gradually encroaching on the Taiwanese army was more than one could imagine.\n-Bam!\n(More enemy troops, even air force!)\nAdditional ground troops and a Taiwanese attack helicopter unit. The armored and aviation units, the mainstays of the war, were well under control.\n-Kiruk (Can you support the ship?)\nThe landing party commander calls for backup. It was received by a minimalist mechanical robot watching their battlefield.\n-Yes.\nAt the same time, Yappy, who had been hacking into Taiwan’s communications network, drawing in Taiwanese troops and Hunters untainted by the demons to provide combat support and direction across the country, activated a stealthy strategic satellite in space.\n-Thump! Thump! Thump!\nThey shot out of space and entered the atmosphere with their heat-treated armor.\nDespite the blistering heat, the descent equipment didn’t burn at all. The special alloy made of stellar iron had successfully protected the equipment inside and dropped dozens of objects as it separated.\nAt this moment, a radar station observing the skies above Taiwan saw something so large that it could have been mistaken for a small asteroid.\n“What is that?”\n“A star?”\n“Not another Meteor!”\nIt’s no secret that the Lionheart King of the TTG Temple can call upon the stars. It’s no wonder he’s having a seizure, since they’re the kind of crazies who don’t mind dropping comets that could destroy the Earth.\n“Huh?”\n“Crack?”\nLike an asteroid splitting as it burns its way into the atmosphere, they slowly dispersed, then fired up their own propulsion boosters and rushed toward a point.\nThere was no drop sequence, no slowing down for landing. It’s not like they’d be damaged by a mere ‘atmospheric descent’.\n-Bang! Bam! Boom!\nThey shattered the highway leading to Taipei City with their sheer destructive force. But there’s more.\n-Combined Third Battle Weapon for Yakt Spinner.\nClinging to the Yakt Spinner like a magnet, it looked like a cockpit, and one by one, the pieces of equipment began to join together.\nAt first they were about the size of a container, but soon they began to transform into something massive.\nThe Yakt Spinners, or more precisely, a hundred Yakt Spinner bodies that had been protecting the city for a thousand years, had merged into a massive battlecruiser——.\n-The Marquis class of Main Battle Program land combat vehicles is now operational.\nMassive weapons are pointed at the Fallen.\nThe Fallen lost their footing in the face of the massive weaponry, but the artificially intelligent muzzle didn’t take that into account.\n-No one can stop me.\nAfter completing their respective missions, the troops gathered in one place and the rallying point goes without saying.\nTaipei City, the realm of malevolence where the three Old Archdemons and the Demon Legion gathered.\nThe Demon Legion and the Knights face off in the center of the battlefield as they begin to gather one by one.\n[Hail, our nemesis]\n[This is our territory. Our fortress.]\n[This is the first battle in two hundred years]\nArchdemons and the legions of evil they’ve summoned, plus the corrupted Taiwanese army.\n“Grrr—! Evil servants— damned evil servants marching in front of me!”\n“It’s terrible, it’s the end of the world, how dare those scum—!”\n“I, Laihar Dever, will slaughter them before this night is over!”\nThe Knights of the Blazing Flame and the Kikiruks landing force rallying behind them along with the Taiwanese soldiers who had risked treason to enter the city.\n“GRARARARARA──!!”\nVulcanus, who arrived like a blazing meteor from somewhere, and──\n-Bam!\nThe Yakt Spinner watching the city aboard the Marquis class of a giant battlecruiser.\nWith the exception of the Lionheart King, the Magician Queen, and the Demon Archduke, the strongest forces on the island are gathered together.\n“Burn them until their souls are consumed.”\n[Stop them. This is a bridgehead for the invasion of Earth. We can’t afford to be left behind]\nOn a small island in modern Earth in the 21st century the most unlikely of battlefields is materializing.\n“Forward with swords and spears. The knights lead the way.”\n[Form up, enchant, and prepare for the knights’ shock]\nSword and spear, holy law and magic. Old-fashioned cold weapons and non-existent holy and magical powers.\n“Rage! Rage without end! For the glory of Lionheart!”\n[Damned knights, the ghosts of the dead still haunt us!]\nIn your hatred and rage against each other.\nKill the enemy.",

      "content": "Chapter 171: The Fallen Archduke Quai\nApart from the duel going on outside, the ballroom with Leon and Beatrice was relatively quiet.\n“Oh, no!”\n“Yes!”\nCompared to people like Beatrice and Vulcanus, the knights of the First Order of the TTG Temple were objectively powerful.\n“Stand, Holy Grail—!”\nThe Thunderbolt Spear from the Holy Knight of Sky and Thunder and the Absolute Barrier from the Holy Knight of Light and Justice.\nWhen the Absolute Barrier’s special ability, Great Wall, forms a barrier of holy power and drives the hostages into a corner, the Spear of Thunder unleashes a barrage of its own.\nCalling down thunder from the heavens is the most powerful of Ultima’s holy arts, but Jae-hyuk’s Thunder Spear was a holy artifact that could be used to stockpile thunder.\n“Hey, wasn’t that the French minister you just searched?”\n“That’s right— the minister was also a Fallen——.”\nIt wasn’t just the high-ranking Taiwanese officials who were revealed to be demons or fallen as they raided room after room of hostages.\nThey were invited by the Taiwanese government–or, more accurately, invited by the demons.\n“Isn’t this going to cause diplomatic problems?”\n“He’s dead because he was caught in the act, but what the hell, we’re documenting it.”\nThey were wearing body cameras. It was Yappy’s suggestion, as he said it was best to have video evidence of anything.\nThe body cam footage showed hostages exposed to the holy gas mutating into demons or melting away, and in clear evidence, falling to the knights’ blades.\n“This floor is still a ways off, was that senior Ha-ri at the end of the hall?”\n“Yeah, eh, sister?”\nHa-ri, who must have started at the far end of their respective directions, was now standing right in front of them.\n“Soo-ho, Jae-hyuk, are you hurt?”\n“Uh-huh. But sister——”\n“No, senior, why are you already here? Didn’t you start in room 1909?”\n“I just got everything organized.”\n“Already?”\nWhile Jae-hyuk and Soo-ho were teaming up to organize ten rooms, Ha-ri had already taken care of a similar number of rooms.\nHa-ri flashed them a sly grin and decided to demonstrate.\n“Watch.”\nShe sped through the next cabin, and the hostages in it cowered, visibly relieved to see her.\n“Oh, it’s Lord Han Ha-ri,” said the Italian minister, “you have been released──”\nBefore the Italian minister could finish his sentence, Ha-ri drew her sword.\n“Holy fire!”\n“Lord Ha-ri? What the hell, aaahhhh!”\n“Crazy—!”\nHa-ri unleashed a blast of flame from the bottom to the top. The spreading flames dyed the narrow room a dense red.\n-Kyaaaaahhhh!\n-Buu, fire! Fire! Fire!\nThe hostages in the room screamed, but there were some who melted in the searing pain.\n“The deputy director of Taiwan’s National Security Bureau, and— the executive secretary?”\nThose who were not demons were safe from the flames of Ha-ri, while those who were demons or corrupted were melted by the dense flames made of holy power.\nIt was only possible because of Ha-ri’s fine-tuning of the Holy Laws and her specialization in flame.\n“How’s that for fast?”\nHa-ri’s smile made the two of them dumbfounded.\n“I think I just witnessed a— trench warfare disaster.”\n“What do you mean– aren’t Flame Holy Knights invincible indoors?”\nThere were fifty of these monsters and among them, Vulcanus is said to have single-handedly melted a frozen continent, but they didn’t know if that’s true.\n* * * *\nWhen one is extremely frightened, there is not a thunderous scream, but a silence that is mixed with wailing.\nChen So-yeon was thinking now that it was plausible.\n“So, you’re saying that you don’t know the location of the Fallen Archduke, right?”\n“That, that’s right, that’s right——.”\nDemons and Fallen, drooled and lost in thought answered Beatrice’s question.\n‘His Majesty told us to escort the Queen, but—‘\nIndeed, did this magician queen need an escort?\nChen So-yeon prided herself on being incredibly strong. Her official rank was quasi-S rank. However, her potential must be at least Class S or higher but facing a superpower like Beatrice changed her definition of strength.\n“Ms. So-yeon.”\n“Yes?”\n“You were once the enemy of the Slaughter Archduke Akasha, right?”\n“That’s ——.”\nSlaughter Archduke Akasha also known as the Wandering Magic Sword used the body of a cursed magic sword that turned its user into a demonic swordsman.\nHe stole her father from her, and she lost her mother and her uncles and aunts in the guild who were like family to her.\nOn her path to revenge, she encountered the God of Vengeance and had her soul mortgaged, but thanks to Leon, she was able to complete her revenge by handing over Akasha’s soul.\n“I’m very envious of you. I also think you’re brilliant.”\n“What?”\n“In essence, to take revenge on a Demon Archduke, no, to face it is an impossible task.”\nIt is because of beings like Leon and Vulcanus, who are the epitome of unreason that mortals can stand against demons who are immortal and have infinite lives.\nBeatrice has fought countless demons, killing them but there was no end.\n“I have lost so many people in the process. My people, my subjects, my brothers and sisters.”\nAfter all that she had lost, she hadn’t even dreamed of revenge. Instead, she fell for the enemy’s offer.\n“And you–you will succeed, because you have the king.”\n“Yes, it’s a long shot.”\nYes, if there was anything different now, it was the presence of one man, Leon, whose presence was so magnificent that Beatrice could begin her revenge, even a hundred years later.\nHe is the enemy of the demons. Only by following him, by serving him, could the impossible be realized.\n“Perhaps I should have made a contract with the God of Vengeance.”\n“Would you like me to relay it to him?”\n“No, I can’t mortgage my soul.”\nBeatrice’s life, her soul, is not hers alone.\nFor the captains and knights of the kingdom who sought to protect her from a hundred years of corruption Beatrice Alighieri Spero must keep their legacy intact.\n“I have gained strength——”\nThere is nothing more gratifying than being able to exact vengeance on your own terms.\nThe two opened their cabin.\n“Oh, there you are.”\nA handsome young man in an immaculate suit.\n“——”\nHis face is different, his mannerisms are different, his voice is different but his twisted smile and piercing gaze reminded her of someone.\n[Queen, make a deal with me]\nIt is impossible to forget the face that hides such terrible malice, even if it has disguised itself.\n[If you plant the essence of corruption and survive for a hundred years, I will stop invading this world and return it to its original state]\n“Miss So-yeon.”\n“Yes—!”\nChun So-yeon didn’t hesitate for a moment, charging towards her unusual opponent.\nWielding Arianna’s Holy Sword and Ventasis’ Magic Sword, her offensive power could be said to be almost at the level of a Holy Knight.\n-Bam!\nThe demonic figure blocks the charge of the Holy Sword as its sharp hands are deformed into hideous teeth.\n“Is this the power of the God of Vengeance? It’s quite annoying.”\nSomething leapt out of the Fallen Archduke Quai’s chest. It was a tentacle head with hideous gills.\nSo-yeon reflexes were astounding, but the tentacle, which had stretched out as far as it could go, returned like a boomerang, aiming for her back. Just then──\nGreat Magic <The Eye of Destruction>\nThe Eye of Destruction blasts away the dozens of monster tentacles.\nThe tentacles that had been blown off their heads by Beatrice’s gesture landed on the floor.\n“Haha~ You’re still the same, magician queen, deploying Great Magic-level magic at the speed of regular magic.\nThe headless tentacles crawled back into the man’s stomach and a horrible sound that shouldn’t be in this world bubbled up from the man’s gut.\n“Even the Archdemons of wisdom and exploration are praising your magic skills. Don’t you think it’s a shame?”\n“What?”\n“If you had remained corrupted and become the Lord of Pleasure, you might have become an Archmage that could rival even that Caracael.”\n“I’m not interested in becoming a demon or anything like that.”\nThe demon laughs against the backdrop of the city’s neon lights and So-yeon cringes at the unearthly malice that radiates from that laugh.\nIf Archduke Akasha, the Archduke of Murder and Destruction, terrorized with pure violence and murder, this one drove a man from the bottom up with slimy malice.\n‘They say they’re not the most combative of demons——.’\nBut this pressure, far from being a will to kill or a will to destroy, was a strange stickiness that was very unpleasant.\nI want to scratch at the skin exposed to that licking gaze right now.\n“Miss So-Yeon.”\nAt that moment, Beatrice’s cold hand gently caressed her cheek and this brought So-Yeon back to her senses.\n“Raise your holy power. Don’t give that thing a chance to dig in.”\n“Do you think that’s possible, when even you, the high-minded magician queen, finally succumbed?”\n“It’s possible, because——”\n-To the Lion Heart—! Glory be!\n“Because He is with us.”\n“——!?”\nThe next moment, Quai, feeling an eerie sense of dread, turned around. What he saw outside the cabin window was a celestial horse galloping through the sky at full speed and the Lionheart King holding a holy spear.\n-Boom!\nThe cabin crumbled before the charge of the strongest charger and a part of the building collapsed with a loud crash as if a missile had hit it.\n“Are you okay, you two?”\n“Thanks.”\nLeon checked on the two women, glancing up at Stallion to see a pool of blood on the holy spear.\nEven a Demon Archduke could not be unscathed by such an attack.\n“Oh, no, really, you’re-”\n“Stallion!!!”\nLeon didn’t wait for the Fallen Archduke’s sly tongue to tease.\nIf Beatrice was stalling for time to draw him in, Leon would destroy evil without delay.\nIt was the difference between a magician and a knight, and before Leon’s devastating charge, Quai had to tease him as he fled.\n“Isn’t fairness a chivalrous virtue?”\n“Ha! Do you keep your manners when you hunt beasts? You are beasts. No, less than beasts. A mass of germs to be trampled and burned!”\nThere’s no need to talk to them. It was the doctrine of the Lionheart that demons were to die at the hands of these unyielding holy knights, unable to attempt any trickery or seduction.\n“I really don’t get along with you guys.”\nThis was the case during the earlier invasions of Lionheart’s world, when the common people and officials could be corrupted, but not the knights and nobles.\nEven if they were lucky enough to get a few knights or nobles to become followers, the Inquisitors, sensing evil, would immediately kill them.\n-Ca-ching! Ka-kang!\n“Kwack—!”\nLeon unilaterally pressured Quai. Even the Slaughter Archduke, who specialized in combat, couldn’t stand up to Leon. In such a situation──\nGreat Magic <Eye of Destruction>\n──── Holy Law Double Blade\nOf the two people backing up Leon even the weakest Chun So-yeon was an S-ranked and troublesome two-sword owner so Quai was quickly pushed to the brink.\n“Kulk—!”\nAfter a loud crash and destruction, Quai landed in the middle of the hotel garden and scratched his head as he struggled to his feet.\n“I thought I was strong, but I’m no match for this.”\nWith a thud, Quai rolled to the ground, dodging the airborne javelin charge but at that moment, the Archmage’s magic grabbed Quai.\n“Is that all you have to say? No, don’t think you’ll die easily, for I intend to revel in the screams of your soul.”\nIt is said that a demon in the hands of the Magician Queen would rather wish for death.\nQuai knew the grisly rumor. She had the idea of leaving mental trauma, not physical, as a defense against a resurrecting demon.\n“What makes you think that?”\n“Do you think there’s a way out?”\nIn the middle of the hotel where the disturbance occurred, the knights of the TTG Temple, the crusaders of the Hanbit Palace, who had been moving back and forth between the upper and lower floors, gathered.\nThere was no exit in sight.\n“Yes, as long as you exist, Queen.”\n“What?”\nSensing something, Stallion slammed his foot into the ground and Leon, responding to his ally’s reaction, charged with his holy spear but it was too late.\n-Pop!\nA finger snapped.\n“Huh?”\n[Oh no—! I can’t suppress it!]\nThe Goddess of Death and her priestess questioned at the same time. The magic power of the ‘Essence’ implanted in her heart expanded, and then──\n“——.”\nIt was a vast, endless wilderness, a desert filled with nothing but sand and heat.\nLeon felt hungry and thirsty and called out to the gods.\n“Arianna.”\nHe called out to the goddess of light and justice, but there was no answer.\n“Poma.”\nHe called upon the god of the sea and waves to appear, but he was not answered.\n“Fle, where is Beatrice?”\nHe called the God of Dreams, but again, there was no answer.\n“——”\nLeon was isolated in a wilderness, disconnected from the gods, with nothing but endless hunger and thirst.",

      "content": "Chapter 172: The Trial of Corruption\nIn the wilderness, all Leon could do was walk.\n“Whoa——”\nLeon is a man with the heart of a lion.\nThe guardian of the Holy Grail, a demigod beyond saint who has his own holy power, a being of perfect vitality who never tires and an indomitable spirit that never gives in.\n“Whoa——”\nHe clears his throat. Despite being able to survive decades without eating or drinking, he feels hungry and thirsty.\nIt’s a sensation he hasn’t felt in a long time, a sensation he’s long since forgotten, after becoming a Holy Knight long ago.\nThe gods loved him, and his perfect body and noble mind made him invincible.\nNight came, the hot, dry days of the sun are over, and the cold, chilly days of the moon begin.\nThere were no living creatures in the wilderness.\nIf he had been able to hunt, he would have eaten the meat and quenched his thirst with blood but there was nothing in this wilderness to satisfy Leon’s needs.\nAnd yet.\n“Daylight.”\nAs the sun rises, he resumes walking.\nHe walks without any preparation for the searing heat that stirs his hunger and thirst.\nHe can’t help it, for it is not a knightly virtue to sit still and wait for the right time.\nLeon does not stop walking, even if it is only a single, meaningless step.\nEven on the obscure path of being chosen by the gods, he walks in silence. In a time when there was no faith in the world of Lionheart, he continued to walk toward a vague, imaginary future.\nHe sought out remote places beyond the reach of the gods, slaying monsters and rushing to save villages under attack by orcs.\nHe slogged through swamps gagging on soggy jerky and explored jungles drinking the dead blood of maggoty beasts.\nHis life never stood still, only went forward.\n[Truly, how wonderful, for forty days and forty nights, neither eating nor drinking, nor stopping]\nThe shadow of an evil spirit appeared before Leon, and before he could say anything more, Leon’s sword cut him down.\nThe shadow scattered and resumed its form, and a ghastly laugh spread through the wilderness.\n[King Lionheart, you cannot hurt me here, for this is a place that cannot be reached by your power, nor by the gods]\nLeon did not stop, but continued to slash at the shadow. If it won’t cut, cut until it does. That is the life of a knight, the code of a knight, the way of a knight to victory.\nHundreds of times, thousands of times, until finally, at the end of the day, Leon caught his breath.\nEven the demons had grown tired of scattering and regrouping in pointless attacks.\n[You are hungry, you are thirsty, knight, if you are truly loved by the gods, why do you not ask for bread, why do you not ask for a drink of water]\nWhere are the gods in whom you believe so much?\nThe demonic shadow smiled a twisted smile. His hands were outstretched.\nThere was bread and water in them. Something so desperately needed by Leon, who had wandered forty days in the wilderness, fighting the demon’s illusions day after day.\n[I’ll take care of your hunger and your thirst. You only have to do one thing]\nGet down on one knee.\nThat’s all you need to do.\nNot to submit, not to abandon your faith.\nJust one knee.\nThat is enough.\nThe demon watched Leon catch his breath with a look of anticipation.\nBy nature, a man cannot endure three days and three nights of starvation.\nEven those with the noblest intentions can’t last more than a week.\nLeon had now starved for forty days straight. His body and mind are exhausted, and he’s been fighting the illusion all day.\nIt is the most powerful physical pain that any saint can endure.\n“——”\n[Kneel down, and I will give you-─!]\nThe demon’s words were cut short. The swing of the sword shattered his molded mouth.\nThe demon regrouped and tilted its head.\n[I don’t understand, one knee, just one knee and you’d be free of hunger and thirst]\n“You’re so loud. You always talked a lot.”\nEven through the hunger and thirst, Leon’s voice was clear, his blue eyes clear and clean.\n“You devil, you old fool, you think man lives by bread and water alone. My flesh is not only made of blood and flesh, but of faith and conviction.”\nThat is what keeps me alive.\n[——.]\nThe demon realized that hunger and thirst were not enough to break him.\n-Poof!\nWith a loud crack, the world changed.\nIt was a vast universe with countless planets and other worlds beyond dimensions.\n“”Greatest knight—!!””\nThere were countless knights, cheering for Leon.\nKings of the world bowed to him, and even the gods looked up at him and smiled.\nHere, he was the emperor.\nThe head of a great empire that had conquered many dimensions, the embodiment of a god.\nNot a demigod who had been recognized and elevated by the gods, but a living god who had risen to the top himself.\nAn absolute wielding infinite power and might.\nWorshiped and revered, the ideal that man’s insatiable greed strives to reach, the demon whispered.\n[Take my hand, be our ally, and you shall have all this]\nDo you not see the possibilities of this infinite world?\nYou could be the master of countless dimensions.\nYou can be the most powerful being in the universe.\nYou shall be. Even the demons will serve you as lord.\nThe demon cunning hand reached out to Leon but Leon grabbed it by the wrist.\n“Hush, Devil,” he said, “do you think I want to make myself an object of worship? Even with great power, if I have no faith, I have only endless doubts to preserve my place.”\nThere is no end to the fences around an infinite world.\nLeon’s grip snapped the demon’s wrist.\n-Snap!\nThe place was familiar to Leon, it was the royal castle of Lionheart.\nShields with lion crests adorned the castle, and officials lined both sides of a golden carpet where only the Lionheart King and his royal family could walk.\nThe throne upon which the Lionheart King and his queen sit is empty.\n“Your Majesty, why?”\nThere was a woman on a golden carpet.\nThe Grand Duchess of the North, with black hair like her mother’s and intense red eyes from a dragon’s heart, also the king’s daughter.\n“You could have saved my mother. Was the cause you chose over the one and only Empress so important?”\nIt was Leon’s bitter past.\n“You shouldn’t have done it. You shouldn’t have accepted it, even if the whole world said you were right.”\nThe demon whispered through the painful memories. He tempted in a hushed voice.\n[You are the only human who can reach the paradise of the gods. You are the only one who can reach the world of the dead]\nBring your wife back to life.\nHow can the gods refuse you?\nLeon could do it. Leon deserved it. He could ask the gods to fulfill any wish but instead of asking the gods, Leon grabbed the whispering demon by the scruff of the neck.\n“Demon, don’t tell me to defy order, to forsake the nobility of life, the sublimity of death, with thy words.”\nThis King is the knight of the gods, the mother of all people, the keeper of order.\nThe nape of the demon’s neck drooped sleepily but the demon continued to test the Lionheart King.\nHe led him through endless oceans of gold and jewels, but he never picked up a single coin.\nIn beautifully decorated banquet halls, celestial orchestras and splendid dancers danced, but he never gave them a glance.\nThere was a great white bed and maids singing with sweet voices beside it, but he took not a handful of rest.\nHis wrists were snapped, his mouth was torn open, his legs were broken, as he rushed forward to resist the temptations of corruption.\n[——]\nThe demon grew tired of watching the blond knight’s unyielding journey.\nHow could a mere mortal possess such a resilient spirit?\nHow could he be so unyielding, so uncompromising?\nDoes he have no desire to survive, no desire for self-respect, no desire to exist?\nNo, it can’t be. As long as it is a living being, as long as it is a living being, it cannot not exist.\nThis is a fundamental space made of the essence of pleasure and corruption.\nThis is the place where any desire can be fulfilled, and therefore any being can be corrupted.\n[Why—-?]\n“Do you want to know?\nFor the first time, Leon spoke. High and mighty, as if he were a victor, his gaze looking down on the demon.\nThe demon’s voice twisted in contradiction, as if the positions of the tester and the tested were reversed.\n[Here you are not the Lionheart King, here you are a mere mortal, and all you have is your body and a useless sword!]\nBut within you is the fundamental power of all life. Demons are the source of existence, a collection of emotions that can only desire and hope.\nThe violence of the creatures creates the Lords of Destruction,\nThe insatiable appetite for knowledge creates the Lords of Wisdom.\nFrom incomprehensible turmoil, the Lords of Chaos emerge.\nFrom stinginess and greed, the Lord of Greed is born.\n“No, all you have is a meaningless tongue and the hope that I will fall.”\nLeon walked forward while the demon stumbled backward.\nCountless urges were overcome, countless desires passed through him.\n[Why. Why do you not fall?]\nWhy–why don’t you fall?\n“Because this king is a Lionheart.”\nA knight with conviction, a believer with faith and the will of all freemen, nobles, and knights.\nLeon has a saying.\n“Strength is a nation.”\nIt was a declaration not made out of any arrogance, not out of showmanship.\nLionheart is a kingdom of gods and their followers.\nOne that embraces the honor of chivalry, the nobility of nobility, and the service of freemen.\nOn horseback, his eyes shall watch the vast battlefield,\nSitting on a throne, looking out over the kingdom and the world beyond,\nHe must stand before the altar and defend the pantheon with his sword and spear.\nThus the burden on the shoulders of the Lionheart King is heavy, and thus it is noble.\n[No, you are only a man after all, a mortal!]\nThe immortal demon did not recognize the immortality of mortals.\nHow could they recognize that the existence of a mortal, who had only lived three hundred years, who was no more than a newborn baby compared to the highest demons, was greater than their world?\n[Indulge, indulge, indulge in pleasures, indulge in pleasures, indulge in pleasures, indulge in pleasures, indulge in the most powerful desires, and you will succumb!]\n[Realize what it means for you to become the Lord.]\nA place where boys and girls, so beautiful and sensual, danced half-naked in purple smoke.\nAt the end of the palace, where the primal instincts of sweet flesh are stirred.\n“Your Majesty.”\nThere was a bewitching woman who seemed to personify the word ‘beauty’ with her lilting voice.\nBeatrice Alighieri Spero.\nA woman whose dizzying beauty made even Leon find himself unwittingly drawn to her——.\n“Hmm.”\nLeon briskly pushed past the dancers and made his way to her.\nA look of despicable satisfaction crossed the demon’s face, but only for a moment.\n-Thud!\nHe pointed his holy sword at the floor, leaning on the hilt, and stared down at her.\nHis clear, strong eyes met hers, blurred and hazy.\n[What are you up to?]\nLeon simply stared at Beatrice until she shook herself out of the dream.\n“Awake from your dream. For you are the master of your dreams, not their slave.”",

      "content": "Chapter 173: Beatrice Alighieri Spero\nBeatrice Alighieri Spero was a promising princess.\nThe first princess of a rich, magic-fueled kingdom.\nA great magician princess who had already made a name for herself as an archmage at a young age, and the next in line for the throne with her wisdom, beauty, and intelligence.\nHer kingdom was prosperous and peaceful, and though there were disputes over power and territory, the royal family was at peace.\n“Good morning, Beatrice.”\nShe had parents who loved her,\n“Sister—!”\n“Big sister!”\nAnd younger siblings who adored her,\n“Queen, we will serve you well today.”\nShe had loyal knights.\nHer life had been stable, peaceful, and promising since day one.\nIt must have been.\n“Ma’am?”\nHer father, the King, had been erratic lately but her mother, the queen, was trying her best not to notice, but rumors were swirling around the palace.\nHe’s been living with a woman and taking drugs.\nIt is not uncommon for royalty and high officials to pursue luxury and pleasure but Beatrice’s father was a brilliant magician who got along well with the queen and was often hailed as a wise man.\nYet he had an affair and used drugs.\nIt was unbelievable, but it turned out to be true.\n“——you have not seen anything.”\nHe invited a royal maid to his bed and had an orgy of drugs with his friends. Everyone was shocked by the sordidness, but the queen decided to sweep it under the rug.\nShe knew what a royal scandal would do to the court and the kingdom.\nSometimes ugly truths must be buried, she said, and she looked away.\n* * * *\nAfter the crack in the royal couple, the queen devoted herself to state affairs. Her seat was empty, and Beatrice, barely twelve years old, had taken it.\nThe queen claimed to be educating the next queen, but everyone in the court knew that her father had fallen.\n“Your Majesty,” she said, “the kingdom of Romagna has been acting very badly lately, and it is said that the king has been slashing at his subjects and people.”\nThe neighboring kingdom of Romagna was known for its hardy warriors.\nTheir land was barren and mountainous, so their main source of income was exporting mercenaries, and they called their king the King of Mercenaries.\nHe was not a wise man, but he was a man who could balance his rule with his subjects. He had the wisdom to recognize what he was good at and what he was not, and he was a man with a short temper, but he was responsible as a king.\n“If the king of Romagna gets out of hand, he could threaten our kingdom of Spero. Why don’t you send an envoy to find out their intentions?”\n“It is said that something disturbing has happened in the Rostava estates in the south: the lord has transgressed the honor of the Knights of the Horsemen and brutally murdered them. Please show your royal majesty by meting out punishment.”\n“Recently, it is said that there are those who preach strange doctrines among the people, and their behavior is so bizarre that it disturbs the order of the kingdom. They must be captured and brought to justice.”\nDuring this time, there was no place in the kingdom that was free of bizarre behavior, from kings and nobles to the people themselves.\nThis much was known, but how much was hidden and practiced in the shadows?\nThe queen had them thoroughly labeled and punished, but the kingdom, and the world, was decaying at an unusually rapid pace.\n“Your Majesty—! The kingdom of Romagna! The royal castle of Romagna has been burned!”\n“Have the people rebelled?”\n“No! It is said that the king himself has burned the city and slaughtered the people!”\nThis is strange. How can a king burn his own palace and slaughter his own people? His subjects watched, and his soldiers followed suit.\nThe kingdom of Spero, fearing the flames of the call would spread, hastened to send messengers to see what was happening in the city.\nBut half of those who returned were insane, half committed suicide, and only a handful managed to report from the royal castle.\n“Hell, hell, it was–it was no man’s world.”\n“Mothers were roasting their children, and children were committing crimes against their elders.”\n“There was endless indulgence and depravity going on.”\nGanja, who witnessed the scene, shuddered and delivered the most shocking truth.\n“They were not human beings. They wore human skins, but they were not necessarily of this world.”\nEveryone said in unison.\n“”Demons.””\nIn Beatrice’s world, fallen magicians often made pacts with demons to perform black magic, making them a target for vigilance.\nNow, as contractors, they’ve taken over a neighboring kingdom.\nHorrified, the neighboring kingdoms rallied to attack the Romagna, as did the magician queen of the time, Beatrice’s mother.\nBut Romagna wasn’t the only place where demons lurked, as a rebellion broke out while the army set out to stop the demons from pouring out of the fallen kingdom’s castle.\n“Oh, my God! What are you doing?”\nBeatrice screamed in horror as the King led his soldiers to take over the castle.\n“Oh my daughter, how beautifully you have grown.”\nRealizing that the touch was not her father’s usual loving stroke, but that of a creepy man, Beatrice slapped the hand away.\nFear came before disgust and the realization that her father was staring at her like he was licking his lips and that she was facing an ugly need she could never have imagined.\n“Daughter, what is it?”\n“Stop. Don’t come any closer!”\n“Don’t. If you were–yes, if you were, you might have his favor. Do you know how many men have lusted after you? Every man in the palace has fantasized about holding you.”\nThe dirty, horrible words made her dizzy. Beatrice was confused by the unbelievable lewdness of her father.\n“Are there no men who wish to violate my daughter? Hmph, now would be a good time. Perhaps we should marinate her before offering her to him.”\nWhere was the father who loved his mother and children?\nWhere are the loyal knights, soldiers, and nobles?\nNow thirteen years old, she could no longer bear the sight of the ugly nakedness.\nThat day when the queen died in a war against demons unleashed by the Kingdom of Romagna Beatrice killed her father and the soldiers who rebelled with her own hands.\nWith her own hands, she killed her father, the knights and soldiers she had known all her life, and before the blood on the throne could dry, she was forced to take the seat herself.\n“Your Majesty——”\nThe kingdom and the world were torn apart as demons continued to multiply, and the fallen, like her father, were rising in every nation.\nAs queen at the age of thirteen, she must fight the demons outwardly and seek out and purify the Fallen inwardly.\nThe endless battle began as the young queen mobilized her legions of magicians to slay the demons endlessly, putting herself on the front lines.\nAt the same time, she vigilantly searched for the Fallen within. Those who showed signs of corruption were burned to death, warning them with horror.\n“Your Majesty— that demon is——.”\n“Androzin— the Archdemon you defeated.”\nIt was during the third year of the war that the despairing truth was realized.\nThe mighty Archdemon that the Queen and the knights had defeated reappeared.\n[Cackle, do you realize the futility of your efforts? We are immortal. We have no mortal limitations like you. You will eventually be defeated]\nDemons do not die.\nThe body you think you’ve slain is only a shell.\nWe resurrect and return endlessly.\n“So— our fight was pointless.”\nThe young queen, a woman of extraordinary beauty, was unable to stave off the contagious despair.\nOne by one, the kingdom and its allies crumbled.\n“Hee hee hee– Your Majesty, what is the point of this fight?”\nFighting.\n“Let’s surrender! Let’s surrender to them and──!”\nMore fighting.\n“How dare you hide the demons immortality, forcing us into a pointless war?”\nAnother fight.\n“Those demons drove my sister insane, and I’m the only one in my family left alive.”\nLosing it.\n“Sister— kill me before I sell my soul to the demons——.”\nLosing.\n“Fucking demons, I’ll bite you to death.”\nLost.\nOnly those who fought, only those who lost, remained.\nLooking back, there were only those like her left.\n“Revenge.”\n“Blood vengeance.”\n“Worse pain.”\nBecoming a madman.\nIt had reached the point where those who were not mad could not fight.\n“We have a high-level demon today. I’ve got a special cauldron for you today.”\nHow do you like the heat?\nShe too had gone mad. Once the high flower of the kingdom, she became the magician queen of the Spero kingdom and the object of the demons’ fear but in the end, when they had been driven back, and only the last of the royal castle remained, it whispered.\n[Queen, make a deal with me]\nA deal with the demon, even though she knew how dangerous it was—it was a deal she had no choice but to accept.\nThus began a hundred years of depravity, the essence of corruption planted to awaken her as the Lord of Pleasure, repeating the history of her destruction.\nOne by one, even her most loyal knights were corrupted by her natural talent for manipulation and corruption.\nCaptain Ricardo and his knights, who had become Death Knights themselves, believed in her until the very end, but the Magician Queen knew that she would not endure.\nAnd when she was once again trapped in a world that epitomized corruption, Beatrice despaired.\nThe darkness she thought she had escaped lurked in her womb, ready to consume her at any moment.\n“Beatrice, my daughter.”\nHappy days.\n“Sis!”\nEven though she knew those passing worlds were false after all.\n‘I’m——‘\nShe couldn’t resist the sweet temptation.\nIt was natural to want to go back to the past, to wish it had never happened.\n‘His Majesty would have gotten over it.’\nHe would have snorted and told him to get lost but she is not a hero with a strong will and noble convictions like him.\nFor unlike her, who is but a mortal, he is a true knight of the gods, immortal and eternal.\n[Do you really think so?]\nThe unreachable voice reaches out, it was a voice of divinity that could not reach even the Lionheart King.\n[Who art thou?]\n“I am——.”\n“Daughter, what is it?”\nShe looked back and saw the things she lost.\n“Sis, what are you doing? Come on, let’s go. We were supposed to go out together.”\nThere was a lost family member.\n“At your service, Your Highness.”\nA knight left for dead.\n“It’s the Queen!”\n“You look beautiful today!”\nThere were people she tried to protect.\n[Who are you?]\nHow could she turn a blind eye to all this—\n[Beatrice Alighieri Spero! Who art thou!]\n“——The magician queen of Spero.”\n[And then!]\n“The High Priestess of Dreams and— Death.”\n[Who is he next to thee!]\n“The Lionheart— Leon Dragonia Lionheart.”\n[Yes, thou art the magician queen whom the demons fear, and thou art the ally of Leon Dragonia Lionheart, the Lionheart King, the magician queen and my priestess, and thy partner in slaying the demons and establishing the righteous way!]\nSo wake up from your dreams, for you are the dreamer of dreams, never the one who is consumed by them.\n“——”\nFor once, no, for a moment, Beatrice thought. Just for a moment, she looked back at what she had lost.\nIt was a beautiful memory, one she wished to hold on to, and a bitter one at that but she was no longer a magician queen on a meaningless battlefield.\nNow she was a priestess in the service of the Goddess of Dreams and Death, an ally of King Lionheart on the front lines against the demons.\n“Let it remain a memory.”\n“Sister?”\nAs she turned completely around and stepped forward, she heard a familiar voice.\n“You were a monarch I was honored to serve.”\nThe old general waved her off with pride and Beatrice made a promise to the loyal knight.\n“I will prove it to you now.”\nShe is a magician queen, a companion to the knight-king with the heart of a lion to slay the demons.\nA dream, a vision of the very essence of corruption, scattered, with Leon staring at her and the Demon Archduke stumbling back in disbelief.\n[Nonsense— this was not your destiny——]\nThe Queen’s hand reached out to the Archduke of the Fallen. It was a cold touch of death.\n“Fate is not for the likes of you to decide.”\nDeath rained down on the cunning demon.",

      "content": "Chapter 174: The God of War\n“Haa—!”\nWith a ragged breath, Beatrice fell forward but Leon caught her to keep her from collapsing.\n“Excellent.”\n“What happened to him—?”\nEven in Leon’s arms, Beatrice searched for her enemy.\nLeon saw that nothing remained where Beatrice’s death magic had swept, but he knew that didn’t mean he was gone.\n“He was never here to begin with. I’ve slashed him five thousand times, and he’s still here.”\n“Even with holy power?”\n“I wouldn’t say he was unscathed but what he used this time was not only his own power, but the power of the Lord of Pleasure–nay, the power of evil.”\nIt was with that power that he was able to temporarily cut off Leon’s connection to the Pantheon, isolating him and Beatrice in a place where time and space diverged.\n“Because of me——”\nBeatrice clutched her lower abdomen through clenched teeth. The power that the Goddess of Dreams and Death now held over her was more than she had ever realized.\nNone of this would have happened if it weren’t for the essence of corruption he’d planted in her.\n“Fight the evil and don’t blame yourself. Regrets can wait.”\nLeon had seen too many people destroy themselves by dwelling on regrets, on what they couldn’t do, on their lack of power.\nBut those who face the demons must know that the only thing that is bad are the demons, and that the blame should be directed solely at evil, not at themselves or those around them.\nThat’s how you fight the demons.\n“That’s a terrible idea.”\n“Trust me, this king is the authority in this area.”\nLeon smirked as he helped Beatrice to her feet.\n“So, can you still fight, because it looks like it’s still a battle out there.”\nBeatrice smirked at Leon’s question, as if she didn’t need to answer.\nIn the distance, Ha-ri and the three knights were running.\n* * * *\nModern Earth in the 21st century.\nIn the advanced age of missiles and satellite weapons, the battlefield on a small island nation in East Asia was alien.\n-Wipe them out!\n“Shields up!”\nShields raised, Man-At-Arms meet the enemy charge, and grotesque demons charge forward, wielding rusted greatswords and whips.\nThe clash on the front lines isn’t just between cold warriors. Taiwanese troops on both sides, fallen and uncorrupted, turn their guns and muzzles on each other.\n-Bang!\nThe hail of artillery and gunfire is interrupted by the holy law of the knights. It’s not a defense, it’s a complete nullification.\n-Damn, the shells aren’t working! Is that the ranged nullification I’ve been hearing about? At this rate, we’re going to have to push for hand-to-hand combat!\n“Enemy tanks and armored vehicles, charge ahead! Launch anti-tank missiles!”\nWith the knights’ ranged nullifying shields blocking the gunpowder weapons, anti-tank missiles and surface-to-air missiles rain down on the charging armored vehicles.\nTheir ranged attacks are blocked, while their opponents use their firearms without restriction.\nIn the midst of this absurdity, the demons have found a solution.\n-Their knight pool is overwhelming! They defy convention with direct-attack magic that escapes ranged defenses!\n“Multiple Demon Sorcerers spotted, call for artillery fire!”\nA brilliant wave of magic is unleashed, and with it, a retaliatory barrage of artillery from the Kikiruks.\nThe battlefield is a disparate mix of cold weapons from the past, modern gunpowder weapons, particle weapons from the future, and demonic magic.\nEven there, there are those who have an absolute presence that transcends past, present, and future.\n-Crack!\n(GK-2 railgun opens fire!)\n“Crap— How did they break through the protective magic?”\n“It’s a weapon with holy power! Damn them, they mixed stardust into the weapons!”\n“Prioritize the gunners! Send out the mid-level battle demons!”\nA hideously distorted tentacle monster charged forward, brandishing a prosthetic sword in place of the torn off arm.\nAt five meters, it was a giant. And yet, with lightning speed and shielding magic, it slashed through the Kikiruks lines.\n-Kiyaaaaaaah!!!\nThe sight of the two giant battle demons charging forward was intimidating even to the heavy-armed Kikiruk warriors.\n-Chirp! Chirp!\n(No firepower! No firepower!)\n-Chirrup! Chirrup!\n(Too many allies in the front! Too much room for error with high-powered weapons!)\nWhile they hesitated, the giant demons approached them, and were about to collide with the Kikiruk knights who stood their ground against their blades when-─\n-Kwazik!\nA giant mechanical foot descended from somewhere and slammed down on the giant demons.\n-What—!\nAlmost simultaneously with the crushed giant demon, a giant mechanical foot slammed into the remaining giant demon, its overwhelming physical force alone sending the five-meter behemoth flying into the air.\nWhat the flying demon saw were the tips of the six giant mechanical feet, the war spider’s guns that looked like they came from outer space, aimed at the giant demon.\nIt was a perfectly calculated shot on a doomsday trajectory that would penetrate and wipe out the enemy infantry at the same time──\n“Gunpowder weapons—!”\nThe giant demon unleashes its maximum protective magic. But──\n-Tactical Pattern 13. Siege Sniper 680mm Stardust Shells for Destroying Fortresses SET.\n“What the hell?!”\nHe’s using precious stardust to make shells?\nThat’s not all. There’s holy water bubbling in the center of that special shell.\nOnce the overwhelmingly destructive Stellar Iron Bullets pierce through, the explosives inside heat up the holy water and spread it everywhere.\nIt was a truly vicious Anti-Demon Holy Warhead.\n“You—!”\n-Fire a Hyper-Reaction Accelerator round.\n-Boom!\nWith a terrifying roar, the giant demon disappears.\nUnlike the previous giant, whose death was purely physical, the Holy Water-loaded Stardust Warhead shredded the demon’s soul and the aftermath didn’t end with a single demon.\nExposed to the super-strong AI’s meticulously calculated firing angle, a portion of the demonic legion was swept away, caught in the aftermath of the explosion.\n-Crack!\n-My soul, my soul melts!\nIt was a terrible inferno of holy power created by a single shot.\nA demon, admiring the scene, cried out.\n“That’s bullshit, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”\nThe demons intuited that if that thing fired twice, they would be finished.\nCity-sized battles are one thing, but not when your opponent isn’t your average size.\nThe super-giant battle weapon deployed on a battlefield of several hundred meters had attained holy power and evolved into an absolute weapon.\n“Ma, just—!”\nThe giant muzzle had just finished cooling down and was about to pour out its secondary fire when──\n-Boom!\nsomeone jumped on top of the Marquis-class fuselage.\n-Whoosh?\nThere was no enemy reaction close to the radar waves?\nThe blade swings and the being although small compared to the Marquis-class fuselage, even if it was close to giant size. But——.\n-Slash!\nThe armor and weapons disintegrated in an instant but Yappy’s camera sensors picked it up.\n[That’s some pretty tough armor]\nOne of the Great Old Ones rushes toward the cockpit, slicing through Yappy’s armor and weapons like tofu.\n-Emergency Response Glove Fire.\nYappy detonates the explosives inside the fuselage and slams into the Great Old One.\nAlthough the fuselage is damaged, the Great Old One retreats, bracing itself against the building to avoid the explosives that spray the holy water.\n-Damage to armor and power. Damage control initiated.\nEmergency fire fighting equipment is mobilized to extinguish the fire and nanobots are deployed to repair any salvageable armor.\nNo one could have built such a giant battle machine out of stardust but even so, it’s a mix of adamantine and mithril, two of Gate’s hardest minerals——.\n-Enemy threat rating increased. What’s Vulcanus doing?\nYappy’s camera eye turned to a corner of the battlefield, where──\n“GRARARARARARARARA──!!”\nA Holy Knight of Flame was rampaging and two Great Old Ones were trying to stop him.\n“I couldn’t hold all three of them! Take care of one!”\n-I’m disappointed.\n“Grrrrr! It would have been easier if we had the Queen!”\nVulcanus was having a harder time than he expected against the two Archdemons.\nVulcanus fought even an Archduke so they were no match for him.\n“How arrogant of you, demons! How dare you leave one of your own behind against me!”\nThe Great Old Ones played a thoroughly stalling game against the Vulcanus, until one of the freed-up Great Old Ones slipped out to stop Yappy.\nTheir size should have given them the advantage, but they held off the Vulcanus with great coordination and skill.\n[Boom!]\nAfter blocking Vulcanus’ twin greatswords, the Old One dropped to one knee, seemingly overwhelmed. His entire body was crushed by the impact alone.\nAbove all, his soul was burning from the furnace-like flames of holy power that flowed from his sword.\n[Monster—!]\n[We— all we can do is hold on——.]\nThe oldest of the demons. The Great Old Ones, the veterans of the veterans.\nThey have invaded many worlds since the dawn of time, but they have never seen anything like this.\nNo, it was not the first time.\n[Reminds me of Lionheart.]\n[And that orc.]\nThey were truly monstrous creatures who have defied immortal lords in mortal form and were the nightmare of demons.\nThey were grateful that they were not here.\n[The Knights of the God of War are no slouches, either——.]\nThe Knights Leon raised on Earth. Though they are no match for the Holy Knights, they are a division of Kingdom Knights, each one of whom is truly connected to the gods.\nRecognized as a special favor of the gods, their equipment is deceptive before their skills.\n[But we, too, are a legion that has conquered many dimensions, and the quality of our troops gives us the edge]\nOr, to put it another way, they are outclassed by the enemy generals but these old fiends have the flexibility to admit it.\n[But we’ve spent tens of thousands of years on the battlefield, too]\n[We can’t afford to lose to mortals who are as good as newborn babies]\nThe Great Old Ones were desperate to capture Vulcanus.\n[If only we could hold him.]\n[With reinforcements still coming in, we have an overwhelming advantage]\nAlthough the initial surprise raid failed to rally the troops, the demons had planted enough Fallen in Taiwan.\nFrom unwitting soldiers following their commanders’ orders, to demons planted throughout the civilian population, to the constant stream of demons coming from the gates.\nThe forces here are not all there is, their opponents, on the other hand, could use more help.\nEven if they could get hunters from Korea or Japan, it would take too long. In the first place, the TTG Temple has been working in secret with its Korean and Japanese allies to surprise them.\nIndeed, the key names are here, but their forces are small.\n“You bastards, you’re just going to run and hide and stall for time!”\n[He seems to have noticed]\n[But it makes no difference]\nVulcanus could overwhelm the Great Old Ones in a 1v1 but his opponents were skillfully stalling for time. Any more time away from Leon’s arrival will only put the outnumbered side at a disadvantage.\nVulcanus realizes he has to be careful here.\n[Oh, no, you can’t]\nRealizing his intentions, the God of War turned to his Holy Knight.\n“Mr. Petos, don’t you dare!”\n[It’s nothing of the sort! I haven’t even finished the last one yet, and my immediate needs are on loan from other gods!]\nHe was referring to a certain goblin’s staff that Leon had gotten his hands on.\nThe staff was capable of converting holy power into a unified force, and despite its inefficiency, it was able to gather the holy power of other gods and supply it to Petos.\nEven with the Knights of the Burning Sword, Petos spent more holy power than he gained, and these days he was a debtor.\n[I’ll give you an emergency loan, War, but I’ll have to charge you interest].\n[Justice, you vicious bitch!]\nVulcanus chuckled and raised Gob’s staff from subspace, much to the consternation of Petos, who was already a debtor.\n“I’ll be damned, Goddess!”\n[Oh, no!]\nThe faith of Goddess Arianna was channeled into Gob’s staff and it was immediately offered to Petos, but before Petos could even hold it──\nDivine Descent────\n“I am Vulcanus—!!”\n────<God of War>.\nFull power for one minute only.\nIt’s not up to the knight to pay back the interest on the loan he borrowed from the pool.\n[Nnooooooooooooom—!]\nThe war god’s cries echoed throughout the temple, but the gods shook their heads.\n[Ha-ri is not supposed to learn such things]\nThe Sea God was afraid that the wretched knight would be a bad influence on his goddess.",

      "content": "Chapter 175: The Blacksmith God’s Super Robot\nIt had been a while since Neutrois, one of the Great Old Ones, had lost a tooth on his bladed rake.\nAn epic piece of equipment by human standards. This blade is a demonic masterpiece that contains the souls of countless fallen.\n[He’s got a body of that size, and looks like it’s made of stardust.]\n-Yuck!\nThe fuselage of Yappy’s Marquis-class war machine is covered in stardust to the point where it’s almost unbelievable.\nThis means that breaking through its armor is the equivalent of dismembering hundreds of fully armed knights.\n[But—! It’s not all made of stardust after all!]\nHis legs are torn apart by a blade rake but Neutrois continues doing the same thing to Yappy, right down to the paint, and cuts out the hidden vulnerabilities.\nHow did he pinpoint the vulnerability so precisely?\nAs Yappy continued his dizzyingly fast battle, he replayed the footage from earlier 3,733 times, and found the reason.\n-Frame reinforcement from -06.34 to 07.25 seconds. Cause.\nAnalyzing hundreds of thousands of frames in less than a second and finding the differences in a second.\n-Enemies, great sense of smell. Presumably reacting to the smell of the hematite and adamantine paint.\nIf the opponent reacted to the smell, then.\n-Nova gas explosion. Gas blocked his sense of smell.\n1.9 seconds to this point.\nThe strong artificial intelligence, which devoted all of its computing power to the act of combat, quickly found a solution.\n-Yay!\nYappy mixes chemicals with the holy water produced by Leon’s Last Holy Grail and sprays it with an extremely poisonous gas.\n[Hmmm—!]\nThis had two purposes. First, to block the Neutrois sense of smell, and second, to force him to retreat.\nThere’s no way Yappy’s overwhelmingly marquis-class endgame weapon can lose if the distance is open!\n-Check enemy retreat. Doomsday Weapon set.\nThe distance has been opened and at that very moment, Yappy’s 680-millimeter Stardust Cannon takes aim.\nThis overwhelming force will send the Archdemon to the netherworld with a mere glance.\n[Arrogant, you think I’ve never faced an AI weapon like you before]\nAt that moment, the ground beneath Yappy’s feet exploded and as his foot fell off, his shooting angle was deviated.\n-The explosion in the subway.\nYappy realizes that the exploded bridge is in the subway, and the slight bloodstain is the first indication of what happened there.\n-A suicide bomber is present. Life check.\nThe Demon Gate wasn’t the only place where demons had been summoned above ground. Demons had also been summoned underground and were lying in ambush.\n-Defense forces deployed at each entrance to Taipei Station. Urgent demands.\nYappy quickly communicated but demons were already pouring out of the subway entrances in all directions.\n-Space armament platform rearmed. Charged particle cannons open fire.\nYappy’s choice was to focus the firepower on the entrance to the subway station.\nA barrage of charged particle cannons from space struck the subway point one after another, and the demons’ advance was halted when the ceiling collapsed.\n<Region Declaration – Temple of Corruption>\n——-!?\nA giant purple magic circle appeared in the air directly above Yappy. At first he thought it was an offensive spell, but he quickly realized it wasn’t.\n-Device malfunctions. Control systems inoperable.\nThe space platform is immobilized, as if overrun by a myriad of viruses.\n[Machines are useful, but they’re still machines. It’s easy to take control away]\nNeutrois walked slowly toward the creaking Yappy leisurely, clearing the gas with wind magic.\n[I see you have some firepower, so let’s put it to good use.]\nAt the same time as Neutrois spoke, the Marquis’s muzzle, which had been taken out of his control, pointed in the opposite direction, towards the armored vehicles of the Kikiruks.\n-Emergency Purge—!\nAt that moment, Yappy’s armament, which seemed to be about to burst into flames, drooped along with the entire unit.\n[Hmph~ You stopped the unit before the artillery barrage. Not bad judgment, but——.]\nYappy was left defenseless and Neutrois smiled grimly as he patted Yappy’s iron tentacle leg.\n[Indeed, I see, even if it’s made of stardust, how does it move, it’s weight is offset by an anti-gravity device]\nThe spot he was touching was exactly where the anti-gravity device was planted and Neutrois bladed rake stabbed into the exact spot.\n-Quick!\nThe antigravity device is destroyed due to penetration from the outside and the marquis class collapses.\n[Who’d have thought a mecha could take on us without toys like this!]\nNeutrois climbs on top of the Marquis, which has come to a fuzzy halt. His bladed rake is about to slam into the fuselage when──\n-Cockpit injection.\nA modular block in the Marquis’s fuselage opens, and something shoots out of it with a bang, hitting Neutrois.\n[—!?]\nIt and Neutrois are knocked backwards, landing in the middle of the demons.\n-What the hell!\n-Kill him!\nA certain Man-At-Arms—who had once entered the Cheongju Gate and escaped with his life—had a pale complexion.\nIt was a trauma, a horror.\nA hunter with eight glowing eyes, slaughtering hunters in the darkness of the sand. A multifaceted tank that raced from building to building.\nThe killing machine of Cheongju.\n-Kwaah!\nIt didn’t take long for the fear to turn into a sense of security.\n-Scoop! Scoop!\n“——?”\n“????”\nThe realization that flesh had been severed came before the splinters hit the ground.\nIn a crowded fight, he slices through flesh as he goes, scattering dozens of pieces with each swing.\n-Yakt Spinner. Massive foot combat.\nIt was the stellar wire of a mechanical arm that sliced through dozens of demons in an instant.\nMore powerful than ever, he became a Holy Knight, powered by the infinite holy power, and he didn’t stop there.\n-Tactics of Warfare 34. The Heavenly Network.\n“??????”\nSixteen wires stretched out in all directions like a net, they were special wires forged from stellar iron, fine and thin.\nPrecisely crafted by the Holy Knight of Iron and Blacksmithing, the holy weaponry spread around Neutrois like a giant spider’s web.\nThe city’s buildings had been transformed into a giant spider web.\n[This guy— What the hell, what are you doing!]\nThe implications were realized the next moment.\n-Tactical Skill Combination 34-17. Iron Revival.\n[?!]\nIn an instant, an enormous sense of gravity washed over Neutrois. He recognized the source of it, for he was a man of many experiences.\nThousands of years ago, a planet and its moon had invaded a world too close for comfort. In the face of fierce resistance, the Lord of Wisdom, Caracael, generated a gravitational field that dropped the moon onto the planet——\n[As if the moon was in close proximity——!]\nWhen Neutrois realized the implications, he was horrified. That machine was not just a machine, it was a Holy Knight of iron and blacksmithing, and what he was dealing with was iron literally made of “stars.\n[Pseudo-planetization, resurrecting the remains of a dead star!]\nEven he couldn’t have imagined the math and conceptual changes that would have to be made.\nBut this Holy Knight did it. It was an artificial intelligence that transcended the limits of organic matter.\n[But—! I am the Great Old One! This is my territory! I have declared it—!]\n<Declaration of Territory – Temple of Corruption>\nThe machine that Neutrois will take control of this time is the Yakt Spinner, which has now resurrected Star Iron as a star.\n-Uncontrollable. Losing ground.\nNeutrois smiles triumphantly. A machine, no matter how great, is still a machine. And in this realm of corruption, a machine without a counter magic is──\n-Emergency injection.\n[What?]\nWith a bang, the module opens, and a small gaseous body pops out. A Yakt spinner—no, Yappy locked eyes with Neutrois as he stood atop a Yakt spinner that looked exactly like him.\n–Laser pointing.\nThe laser point on Yappy’s machine gun snapped at Neutrois but Neutrois smiled sheepishly in response.\n[Ha— with a machine gun the size of a fingernail, how can I–]\n-Goooowwww—!\nSomething is moving, something very large.\n[What is that?!]\nIt’s the Marquis-class combat mech, which was stopped by an emergency purge. It pushed itself to its feet on creaky mechanical legs.\n-Remote control initiated. Activated one-time limited action processor.\n-Switched to full weapon set.\nAs the only being with the ability to process stellar iron and granted autonomous rights to the great comet, the strong artificial intelligence used its skills in iron and blacksmithing to create the finest weapons available.\nFirst up is the Dominator: a two-kilometer submarine capable of waging short-term warfare against nations; these ships are outfitted more with Kikiruk warriors than combat vehicles.\nThe second is the Marquis class.\nUnlike the Earl class, which doesn’t deviate from ‘land’ size, the Marquis class is a giant battlecruiser.\nIts power comes from its six mechanical feet and cannons, which allow it to move through forests of buildings——.\nExternally armed full set.\nInternally armed full auto deployment.\nIntegrated combat systems with a seemingly endless arsenal of weapons supported by space-armed and sea-armed platforms.\nThis is what makes the Marquis-class so terrifying.\n-Uncontrollable recoil due to destruction of anti-gravity devices.\nFinished with his calculations, Yappy took control of the Marquis-class and fired the anchors.\nDozens of anchors shot out into the city, piercing dozens of buildings.\n-The buildings catch the recoil.\nIn the next moment, the Marquis-class modular fuselage is fitted with the same weapons that launched stealth satellites in space and Dominators at sea.\nCharged particle cannons.\nSide ion cannons.\nSix medium special reaction warheads.\nFour 600mm tactical ballistic missiles.\nAnti-infantry 195mm self-propelled howitzer rounds with direct fire.\nAll-weapon free to overwhelm the surface.\n[Eek—! You! You! You—!]\nNeutrois is still being held by the Holy Law Star’s Revitalization, and the troop carriers turn toward him.\nYappy lets out a little mechanical sound.\n-Beep!\nThe next moment, there was a huge explosion in the city of Taipei.\n* * * * *\nAmidst the terrible heat and explosions, the demons gradually began to lose their footing.\n-The two crazy Holy Knights are attacking the Great Old Ones!\n-Those monsters! Why are they still here? We should have killed them all!\nHoly Knights are a symbol of terror to the demons. That’s why they were so thoroughly destroyed.\nThe last of the Grail Guardians may have destroyed most of the demons, but there was no way Leon Dragonia Lionheart would ever rise again.\nBut why?\nWhy do these monstrosities keep popping up?\nAnd one more thing they don’t know.\n“How dare those damned fiends form a formation in front of me!?”\nExtreme Light Holy Sword──\nA holy sword of brilliant golden light was wielded in surprise.\nThe wrath of a goddess, wielded in the name of light and justice. It became a wave of light and swept through the demons.\n“Lionheart King—!”\nFrom the top of a skyscraper that should have been sealed off, the Lionheart King looks down on the demons with his glowing holy sword.\nAt his side, the Magician Queen and the four Knights of the Ten Thousand Gods look down upon the center of the battlefield.\n“It is fitting that you should be huddled together like beasts and slaughtered. Beatrice.”\nBeatrice stretched out her hand wordlessly with a fresh smile. A purplish energy poured from her fingertips, hovering over the skyscrapers and falling to the ground as mist.\n“What is this–Cuck!”\nIt was the mist of death.\nHoly Knight Jerea had changed the nature of the Holy Law <Realm of Illusion> to death. It’s a powerful holy law, and it should have consumed a lot of holy power, but Beatrice was using it so leisurely.\n[It’s not only her holy power, but also the winds she creates with her magic?]\n“Because I have to save.”\nShe is a magician queen, not just a Holy Knight, and the harmonization of holy law and magic has a more far-reaching effect than if she had used pure holy power alone.\nHoly Law is certainly expendable, due to the deceptive power of its conceptual coercion. Even if a Holy Knight or Priestess is an agent who shares the faith of the gods, they must be careful of their consumption.\n“But even so, I have no intention of letting them live.”\nBeatrice hated the demons of pleasure and decadence, having seen her family members corrupted by them.\n“Let the dance of death begin. Compulsory attendance by royal decree. It will not end until there is not a single demon left alive in this land.”\n“Cckkkkkk—! This king will gladly participate in the Queen’s Ball!”\n“Hoo hoo hoo hoo—! Your Majesty would make the best partner!”\nThe two kings dance not the fancy dancing of socialites, but the screaming and shouting of nightmares.\nIt’s a good thing they’re enjoying themselves.\n* * * * *\n“Ugh—!”\nArchduke of Pleasure and Decadence Quai drags his body on a yacht.\nHe used the essence of corruption he had implanted in the queen earlier to draw them both inside.\nThere, Quai’s power was truly limitless.\nThere was nothing he could not corrupt, and no mortal–no, not even an immortal–could survive in his palace of corruption.\nBut why——?\n‘How come they–how come they are not corrupted?’\nEven Leon, whose connection to the gods had been cut off, and Beatrice, whose core had been planted with the essence of corruption, had eventually overcome the temptation.\nIt was beyond the scope of Quai’s common sense.\n“You’ve become a nuisance.”\nHe had left his alter ego there, albeit via the Corruption Essence.\nThe power of holy law is the power of concepts. Even Quai, who had been torn apart by the Holy Law, was unharmed by the strange link.\n‘If it weren’t for the Essence of Corruption, I would have died.’\nThe already powerful Magician Queen had fully awakened to the power of the Holy Law. Attacks from the mental realm would not work against Beatrice, who had truly become the High Priestess of Dreams and Death.\n‘But——‘\nWhat about the Lionheart King?\nWhile imprisoning the Lionheart King through the Corruption Essence, Quai had found some interesting material.\nThe man’s spirit was unimaginably strong, but— he had a weakness.\nIf only he could find a way to exploit that one weakness——\n-Quah!\nThe luxury yacht that Quai had used to escape the sea had barely withstood the massive waves without being overturned.\n“The weather isn’t bad, but──\nQuay realized what the waves were. No, it wasn’t a wave at all, just the aftermath of ‘its’ movement.\n[I thought I smelled an unpleasant scent coming from somewhere— it was you, Quai]\nA massive being breaks the surface. It had huge claws and countless tentacles, riding on a massive tail that seemed to bisect the island.\nIt created waves in the ocean with its movements, and killed countless fish with its mere presence. Worst of all──\n“Ah, ah——.”\nThe sailors on the yacht recognize it, and they begin to shudder, forgetting to breathe, suffocating or going insane, smashing and beating everything in sight.\n“Rakshar.”\nDemon Archduke of Chaos and Destruction.\nThe demons of chaos had traits that made even the other demons shy away, but Rakshar was the greatest of them all.\nNo wonder, for he was a titan who vied for lordship with Malus, Lord of Chaos, until the very end.\nThe Lord of Chaos found the Archduke unwieldy and imprisoned him in the Kikiruks dimension, where he remained sealed away. Upon Leon’s appearance, the Demons of Wisdom broke his seal, but——\n‘He has become more powerful. He already became a ‘Lord’.’\nQuai shed his human hide. In order to remain sane in the face of this terrible being of chaos and destruction, even Quai, a Demon Archduke, had to reveal his true self.\n[I hear you’re pretty banged up]\n[I’ve been getting a lot of snacks lately]\nQuai swallowed hard as he looked behind Rakshar—at the bustle of beings in Nampo Harbor.\nThe massive worldwide event was purely a means to an end for that demon. Many high ranking demons with territories had offered up their slaves to him.\n[I guess using the Essence of Corruption didn’t work out so well, huh?]\nRakshar chuckled darkly. How many lives would be driven mad by that alone?\nThe voice will ride the air, ride the wind, ride the clouds, spreading its madness. But more than that——.\n[Yes, but there’s a way to get to the heart of the lion, and that’s pretty——]\n[No!]\nBoom.\nQuai looked down at the ‘tentacle’ that had pierced him.\n[I found my way.]\nRakshar’s massive face twisted wickedly.",

      "content": "Chapter 176: Taking Control of Taiwan\n“Your Excellency. Dinner.”\nIf you were to ask the president what he usually eats, you’d probably think of lavish nightspots and sumptuous meals, as tycoons do, but surprisingly, that’s not the case.\n“Whoo! Whoo!”\nThe noodles are cooled by his breath.\nThe noodles are shaved, which is no different from regular ramen except that it’s done by a highly paid chef.\n“Is it ramen? I have low blood sugar these days.”\n“Eat it without the kimchi.”\n“I’d rather drink less broth.”\nChairman of a task force meeting in Yongsan served a late dinner after a long battle with the opposition.\nPresident Ahn and other ruling party lawmakers didn’t have time to go to the cafeteria because of a hearing that was scheduled to begin an hour later.\n“I’m relieved.”\nPresident Ahn Dong-il is an ordinary man.\nOf course, he doesn’t lack the skills and background to be president, but he’s a far cry from the conspiracy theories of evil powers that are often portrayed in the media.\nHe’s just an average guy with normal common sense and sensitivity.\nHe’s the epitome of normalcy, and if there’s one thing that’s brought him to this latest crisis, it’s a group of superhumans who are far from normal.\n“More than that, Mr. President, what do you think of the opposition’s agenda?”\n“In this day and age, that nonsense——.”\nOne of the things that came up in today’s hearing was the issue of government officials joining the TTG Temple.\nWhile otherworldly religions are hot all over the world, it’s no exaggeration to say that Korea, the headquarters of the world’s most popular religion, is a little exaggerated and the whole country is crazy about the TTG Temple.\n-Kyaa~ His Majesty earned one victory today.\n-Long live the goddess of light and justice.\n-Eating rice cured my cancer!\nThe direct blessing and repose of the gods and the absolute power of Leon had a big impact.\nTheir code is somewhat bizarre, but the presence of real gods and superhumans acting on their behalf is so influential.\nLeon is the mastermind, but the knights and soldiers of TTG Temple, whom he nurtures with the power of the gods, have grown into the largest hunter’s guild in Korea.\nIn such an atmosphere, the idea that politicians should serve the goddess of justice is more common than you might think.\n‘If you serve the goddess of justice, all of you in this room will be punished and searched.’\nEverybody got their share.\n“Ugh, Leon, he’s the reason I’m here——”\nKorea was going crazy for superhumans, let alone a perfect saint with transcendent strength and a noble spirit.\nSuperhumans were gathering around him, and newspapers were writing about him.\nLeon and TTG Temple were shaking up Korea, and it was a foregone conclusion that this would lead to a cataclysmic period.\nWhat worries those in high places is the existence of the gods and the integrity they demand.\nWhat about Arianna, the Goddess of Light and Justice?\nHer code of conduct for her followers is nothing spectacular.\nDon’t kill, don’t steal, and believe in inner justice.\nFor the average person, these are social and moral codes that come naturally. But they were also problematic for certain classes.\nThe code’s standards for ‘commoners’ and ‘nobles’ were completely different.\n“What happened to Rep. Park Chan-sung?”\n“He was hit in a bad place——”\n“Eh~ That was his downfall.”\nThere was a member of the ruling party who tried to borrow the power of TTG Temple.\nHe planned to convince them that he believed in the Goddess of Justice and was therefore a moral man, but the moment he stood on the platform and announced it──\n“A thunderbolt in a dry sky——”\nA bolt of lightning struck and pierced him from the crown of his head.\nPresident Ahn Dong-gil asked Leon about the case of Representative Park Chan-sung, who barely escaped with his life, and the answer was a warning.\n“I’ll give you a pass for the first time, but you’ll have to be careful in the future. There will be heavenly punishment for those who use God’s name in disgrace.”\nIn a way, he should be thankful that he was only struck by lightning and made a snitch.\nAnyway, because of this instant judgment, the citizens were enthusiastic about the temple.\n-Politicians sprouting up, converting to the statue!\n-Let’s see if it fits or not!\n-Long live Arianna! Long live the TTG Temple!\nWhenever there are major hearings and scandals, they say, “If you’re so confident, why don’t you say you believe in Goddess Arianna!”\nOf course, the same demand was coming from the incumbent president, President Ahn Dong-gil.\n‘Yeah, my term is coming to an end, I’ll just retire.’\nIf you beat the president, you should build a cottage in the mountains somewhere.\nThey say that even farmhouses don’t mean anything these days if you don’t believe in the goddess Demera, so I’m going to do something about it.\n“Mr. President!”\nIt was then. I was drying the white rice with some ramen noodles leftover, when the chief of staff rushed in.\n“What’s going on?”\n“TTG Temple—! His Majesty King Leon is—!”\nIt’s him again. Why does he get into trouble every day?\n“No, I heard you went sightseeing in Taiwan. He’s a luxury passenger on a yacht of the Hanbit Palace.”\nA few days ago, he saw him shaking hands with Taiwanese President and he thought it would be quiet for a while, but——\nHe might be a hero to the common people, but to himself, who had to watch his every move, he was a terrible mess.\n“Prepare to call Taiwan’s President. What should I apologize for——?”\n“Well, it’s nothing of that magnitude, His Majesty Leon—The Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods——”\nPresident Ahn felt a little uneasy as he watched the chief of staff’s flutter.\n“It can’t be—what, he didn’t kill anyone, did he?”\n“They are currently engaged with Taiwanese forces!”\n“——.”\n“——.”\nThe ramen noodles rattled in the air.\nUnable to resist the temptation, the hypoglycemic congressman gulped down the noodles, unaware of the ramen broth gushing down his throat.\n“What?”\nHe asks in disbelief.\n“TTG Temple has invaded Taiwan!”\n* * * *\nThe battle is over.\nThe clash between the Demon Legion and TTG Temple in the city of Taipei ended in a victory for the Temple as Leon and Beatrice joined them.\nAs the dawn breaks and the evil energy that had engulfed the streets is driven away, the citizens come out into the streets one by one.\n“Wow——”\nWhat they saw was the Iron Knights shining with the first light of dawn on a mountain of demonic corpses.\nThey are majestic beings, resting after a great victory.\n“The demons are all dead——.”\n“It’s the knights, they saved Taipei.”\n“No, they saved Taiwan.”\nThe aftermath of the gas attack was also widespread among Taiwanese citizens.\nThe internet, which had been disrupted by the attack but was soon restored, revealed a familiar picture of the corruption of Taiwan’s upper echelons and the demons that had taken over.\nCrucially, a Demon Gate and the Archdemons have been summoned to the center of Taipei, and the corrupt Taiwanese army is on their side.\nTaiwan is doomed. After decades of defending its independence from the threat of the mainland, the island was about to be destroyed by the demons.\nThen the knights appeared.\n-I can’t believe the commander-in-chief was a demon!\n-Well done! Bastards!\n-Here we are, in front of an army, and there’s no commotion! There are knights! The Knights of the Flaming Sword!\nThe battle lasted until dawn, before the bombardment and artillery fire died down, and victory toasts were heard.\n“Long live the TTG Temple! Long live King Leon!”\n“Long live TTG! Long live Lionheart!”\nThe Hunters of the Hanbit Palace who had fought alongside them, the Kikiruk warriors, and the Taiwanese soldiers who had risked treason to march began the final phase of the battle amidst the cheers of the citizens.\n* * * * *\n“Heh, heh, heh! Now, wait! No, no, no, I’m innocent!”\nAfter Taiwan was turned upside down, President Chiang was dragged through the streets by angry citizens, many of them high-ranking officials who, like him, had been caught serving the demons.\n“This bastard sold us to the demons!” they shouted.\n“Judge him! Judge him!”\n“Lord Laihar, please!”\nThe citizens approached Laihar Dever, a high ranking member of the Knights of the Flaming Sword who had been watching the protests, and brought him a primitive torch.\n“Hmph! Have it your way.”\nLaihar ignited the torch with divine flame, and the citizens held it aloft, sharing the fire with each other.\n“Let’s burn the Fallen with divine flame!”\nIt’s no secret that the TTG Temple judged the UN inspectors with fire and the fact that it doesn’t hurt ordinary people in the slightest, only demons.\n“Behold, this is the flame of the War God!”\nThere was even a man who took the divine flame given to him by Laihar and attached it to his body to become a human torch. Of course, he didn’t get burned in the slightest.\n“Waaaaaaaah!”\n“That’s awesome!”\nThe man, cheered on by the crowd, exclaimed as he waved the flame attached to his entire body.\n“If the President is innocent, he won’t be burned by these flames!”\n“Yes, yes, yes!”\nThe man continued to push through the crowd of protesters and stood in front of President Chiang, who was stunned by the intense heat.\n“Stop, stop! You, with this barbaric act, you dare to insult me, the head of the government──”\n“Shut up, you devil!”\nThe man continued to pounce on Chiang. The flames that were burning from his body were immediately transferred to Chiang, and──\n“Extinguish!!!”\nPresident Chiang was judged by God.\n“Hao~ Such a divine execution method?”\nLord Laihar watched in admiration. Wasn’t judging a sinner by fire mixed with the humanity of letting them be warm at the end, even if they were a capital criminal?\nIt was a humane judgment that even a seizure-prone knight of the realm could not imitate.\n“Hmm, that’s enough for now.”\nLord Laihar watched the sinners burning in the center of Taipei, then turned to the Taiwan House where Leon was.\n“Wahahahahaha!”\n“Cheers to victory!”\nThere, Leon and his minions were having a victory party in the Taiwanese government building.\n“Your Majesty, would you like to try this?”\n“Heh heh, what a grape.”\nLeon sat at the head of the table and accepted the grapes from Beatrice.\nIt was a strange scene, but everyone gets excited at a party and in the Lionheart Kingdom, it was customary to celebrate with great fanfare after a victory.\n“Lord Laihar is here, I suppose things have gone well.”\n“Yes, Your Majesty, the citizens are out in full force, hunting down demons all over the city!”\n“Angry citizens often hurt the wrong people. We’ll have to make sure that no one is wronged by giving them the proper amount of God Petos’ flame.”\n“Of course!”\nThe first thing the TTG Temple did after taking control of the Taiwanese government building was to purge.\nThose who had served the demons were purged, and the proper order of things was established.\nUntil a new administration takes over, they’ll teach the code of the gods in the name of post-war management and keep the place safe.\n-Yuck!\nThat role will be filled by the Kikiruk, who were the main force in this war.\n“With this victory, we were able to slay three Archdemons, and their legions alone must have numbered over ten thousand.”\n“All of this is in addition to His Majesty’s glory, praise be!”\n“It’s just a pity we didn’t catch that Demon Archduke, Quai.”\nThe Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods had defeated most of the demons and their followers in Taiwan.\nHowever, it failed to capture the Corruption Archduke Quai, who had used the essence of corruption within Beatrice to trap Leon and her.\n“Your Majesty, if I ever encounter him again, I’ll be sure to——.”\n“You have nothing to worry about. This king knows how to deal with him now, and we have a new power.”\n“New powers? Ah—!”\nIn retrospect, this was the first time that Beatrice was able to use the Holy Law freely. She had truly become a priestess of Fle, the Goddess of Dreams and Death.\n“The realm of illusion is the domain of the Goddess Fle, and now that you have full control over its power, his tricks will not work against you again.”\nThe Fallen Archduke Quai is no longer a threatening foe. A creature characterized by its ability to take advantage of people’s weaknesses is not much of a force to be reckoned with if that trait has been rendered irrelevant.\n“It’s all thanks to you.”\n“It’s because you stood up for yourself.”\nThus, the Taiwan situation was resolved. Since the TTG Temple never intended to leave Taiwanese soil unattended, traffic will be cleared sooner or later.\nIt’ll be up to Yakt Spinner and the Kikiruks to help the next administration, but with Yappy at the helm, it’ll all work out.\n-They’re all dead.\nIt has the potential to become a slightly dystopian state, but as long as Leon is there, Yappy won’t go too far.\nOf course, after Leon, you never know.\nAnyway, in early November, after a month-long stay in Taiwan, the weather was turning chilly, and waiting for Leon at the port of Incheon was Oh Kang-hyuk, head of the Korean Hunter Association.\n“Your Majesty, congratulations on your safe return.”\nThey had already exchanged greetings over the phone, but now that he was on Korean soil, Oh Kang-hyuk greeted him in person.\n“You have done an excellent job, and I must cut you a break for your return—as I said before.”\n“I know.”\nBehind Oh Kang-hyuk was the Minister of Defense and his entourage, sent by the Korean government, who were nervously watching Leon and TTG Temple.\n“Your Majesty—we need you to accompany us for a while.”\nTTG Temple hearing was scheduled to begin today.",

      "content": "Chapter 177: Hearing\n-Kaah!\n-kieeeeek!\n-kwaang! Kwaaang!\nThe video is full of explosions. Throats are blown off by cold weapons, and rocket shells cause realistic explosions.\nI use the word “realistic” because the images on the screen were unrealistic to say the least.\nSurreal optical weapons wielded by races like knights who breathe fire from their bodies and giant crab monsters.\n“That’s an army.”\n“That’s real footage?”\nIn this star-studded room, where even a four-star general is the lowest rank, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the South Korean Ministry of Defense were analyzing the fight in Taiwan.\nFirst, the gas attacks across Taiwan reveal the demons but the general consensus was that they still don’t know the whole story.\nOf course, it was practically a foregone conclusion that this had happened after the arrival of the TTG Temple.\nIn any case, the fact that dignitaries from various countries were being held hostage was enough for South Korea to consider its diplomatic and military options. There was even an envoy from the Ahn Dong-gil administration there.\nThe problem was the Demon Gate and the Kikiruk landing force that were summoned to the center of Taipei, and the TTG Temple and the Demon Legion clashing in the center of Taipei.\nTaiwanese troops were on both sides, albeit sandwiched in the middle, and could see what was going on.\nThe TTG Temple had spotted the Taiwanese Fallen, gassed them to death, and engaged in battle with the summoned Demon Legion and the fallen Taiwanese army.\n“We’re going to be criticized for military action in a foreign country—–”\n“It’s a civilian guild, shouldn’t we just say it’s none of our business?”\n“It’s a diplomatic disaster, but— it’s not a big deal yet, they’re demons involved.”\nSince the appearance of the Demon Archduke of Chaos, Rakshar and the Demon Archduke of Slaughter, Akasha the world has become more wary of demons.\nThere are several countries around the world that have been destroyed by Demon Gates.\nChina alone had fallen into disarray after the Shanghai massacre.\n“The TTG Temple is an expert in demon hunting. If they noticed the presence of demons in Taiwan, they have a defense.”\nAlthough the method was radical, it was also defensible since the person involved was a medieval king.\n“More than that—how on earth could we not have known until now, the first gas attack was hours ago!”\nThe first gas attack occurred around 11:00 am.\nThat’s right in the middle of a hearing, but there was a gas attack next door and no one knew about it?\n“I think there was some kind of information control. The communications inside Taiwan didn’t reach the outside world.”\n“How does that make sense?”\nThis is a world where even a robbery in East Africa is shared in real time.\nIn this age of global networking, there’s terrorism and fighting in a country’s capital, and it’s blocked?\nIsn’t it more than just internet censorship?\n“What’s that, those monster knights, that’s one thing, but that, that, that!”\nPresident Ahn Dong-gil’s tirade was directed at the super robot, a huge presence on the screen.\nIt looked like a super-electronic amalgamation of dozens of alien weapons from the Hollywood box office hits of the early 2000s.\nThis is the “Marquis Class” of the Yakt Spinner, which is currently a hot topic on the Internet.\nIt appeared out of nowhere in the suburbs of Taipei City, literally wiping out the Taiwanese Army’s Fallen Corps and wiping out the demons in the middle of Taipei City.\n“That thing—it looks like something out of a Hollywood movie, why didn’t anyone know it was being built?”\nOn South Korean soil, a private company paying South Korean taxes was building a ridiculous super weapon.\nAs the one person who was taking this more seriously than anyone else, the defense minister spoke with caution.\n“Presumably, it was built at the Kikiruk shipyard in Mokpo. We have confirmed that a significant amount of stellar iron has been shipped there.”\n“They’re building a ship there? An experimental ship? Where did they get the special dock?”\n“I suspect they’ve expanded into it, as the nature of the Kikiruks allows them to build deep into the ocean.”\nIf they knew of the existence of a Dominator-class submarine, they would be horrified, but for now, the only known super weapon was the Marquis-class.\n“Your Excellency, this is unconfirmed information, but we have long suspected that the United States possesses satellite weapons.”\n“Satellite weapons? Like the Staff of God or something?”\n“Yes, there is a record of a NASA astronaut visually confirming it from the space station, but it was apparently dismissed as an April Fool’s joke at the time.”\n“So the thing about satellites is that they can hide, and they said they saw it with the naked eye, but not with radar or anything?”\n“There’s a high probability that it’s a satellite with ‘stealth’ capabilities—-”\nThe Secretary of Defense noted that there have been reports of satellites that have melted into space and disappeared, even from astronauts’ naked eyes.\n“That radar has— what do you call it?”\n“It’s an optical stealth capability.”\n“And what, if it disappeared even from the naked eye, is that Starcraft cloaking or something?”\n“Yeah, I’m guessing they probably have both.”\n“Hmph–the Staff of the Gods is not even comparable, is it?”\n“With the information we have at this point, yes.”\nIn addition to land-based battlefield weapons, there are also stealth satellites in space?\n“Didn’t you say that the TTG Temple’s technology level is limited to drones and cold weapons at best!”\nThe TTG Temple was attracting the world’s attention even at the technology level.\nStellar iron and its processed weapons were tactical assets that could not be obtained, and drones and observation equipment that worked even at the gate were strategic assets that were managed at the national level.\nBut even that is only civilian level technology.\nIf there is a gap in technology between the United States and the rest of the world, it’s enough to build an army like this——\n“Your Excellency, we must detain the Lord of the TTG Temple right now! Their military technology must be scrutinized!”\nThe Minister of Defense felt that the TTG Temple must be shaken off.\nTo this extent, not only the weapons, but also the well-timed communication interception were manipulated by TTG Temple.\nIf it is beyond the level of transnational technology, it must be put under the control of the state.\nThat would be common sense and a natural move for a leader of a nation. But——\n“Your Excellency, this is not possible.”\nOh Kang-hyuk, the chairman of the association, immediately shouted his opposition to the defense minister’s claim.\n“Oh, Mr. Chairman, what are you talking about?”\nThe Minister of Defense glared at him. He felt that Oh Kang-hyuk was definitely responsible for the situation.\n“President Oh, isn’t it your responsibility for not being able to predict this situation even though you sent a guard to the TTG Temple? What was Han Ha-ri doing there?”\n“Ms. Han Ha-ri is just our association’s friendly exchange person for the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods, not a watchman.”\n“What, this asshole?!\nThe fact that the Korean Hunter’s Association had given the TTG Temple all sorts of accommodations and sent Han Ha-ri to watch over Leon in case he got into trouble, which is contrary to modern common sense.\nOh Kang-hyuk, the president of the association, argues that it’s a different law and that they’re just sending an employee.\nThe Minister of Defense is frustrated because they can’t even say that they’re actually a watchdog on the official ship.\n“I understand that everyone is surprised, but think about it rationally. TTG Temple is now a mainstay of South Korea’s national defense and economy. It’s not realistic to sanction them.”\nOf course, there would be no shortage of legal arguments.\nIn fact, it was possible. South Korea’s constitution strictly prohibits civilian organizations from owning military weapons.\nEven the gate reconnaissance drones that TTG Temple now so excitedly selling should be banned, and under the legal interpretation, it wasn’t impossible.\n“It’s not that we don’t have a way to do it, it’s that we can’t do it.”\nTTG Temple is now indispensable to Korea. No, it was indispensable to humanity.\nLeon and his men alone are unimaginable superhumans, the embodiment of gods and holy laws–the only ones who can cleanse the land of miasma.\nThey are irreplaceable.\nThe presence of the TTG Temple in South Korea alone was expected to generate trillions of won in additional tax revenue this year.\nThat’s purely in economic benefits, but when you add in the damage from Dungeon Breaks that the TTG Temple has stopped, it’s in the hundreds of trillions of won. The value that would be created was beyond monetary calculation.\n“Mr. Minister of Justice, how much illegal activity is currently going on in the TTG Temple?”\n“——Tax evasion alone is staggering.”\nTTG Temple was openly avoiding paying taxes.\n“But isn’t a similar amount of money being paid out through other channels, like defense funding, donations, and grants to civil society organizations?”\nHowever, if you look at it closely, it’s not that TTG Temple doesn’t pay taxes because they’re stingy.\nIt was actually a huge welfare system, and the taxes it owed to South Korea, while complicated, were channeled through other channels.\n“Why does the TTG Temple seem to be doing such a troublesome and legally problematic thing?”\n“Because —— kings can’t pay taxes to other kings.”\nExactly.\nLeon wasn’t cheating on his taxes because he was penny-pinching like every other Top Ten guild.\nKings don’t count coins.\nIn his pre-modern, fantastical mindset, he’d left the whole tax thing to those below him.\nAnything that avoids the act of “paying direct taxes” is good enough.\nThat’s why Yappy has been avoiding taxes by creating all sorts of tax havens and bypassing taxes.\n“The TTG Temple is an absolute monarchy under Leon Dragonia Lionheart. Everything is decided according to his standards.”\nMr. Oh emphasized that they should pay attention to this point and President Ahn Dong-gil asked.\n“What does that mean?”\n“We should cooperate with His Majesty more thoroughly. His Majesty understands politics, and if you take care of him first, he will take care of you for the sake of his pride as a king.”\nIn other words, Mr. Oh emphasized that the situation should be used as a means to strengthen cooperation, not as a cause for anger or criticism.\n“When the Firebird Guild was talking about naturalizing in Japan, how did you feel? The stock price plummeted, the financial world was shaken, and now it’s TTG Temple. Can you afford it?”\nJapan would naturally welcome the TTG Temple with open arms.\nNo one could deny Oh’s final words.\nThe current government’s policy was a natural decision. It was inevitable.\n* * * *\nUsually, a hearing is a time to tear down and criticize the other side.\nThe road to it is usually cold and the hearts of those who attend are often heavy, but Leon’s path was pompous and fervent.\n-Wow! Your Majesty!\n-Long live the Lionheart King!\n-Hooray! Demons slain! Glory be to the TTG Temple!\n“You’re quite prepared.”\nOn the way to the hearing Leon climbed into a state limousine provided by the South Korean government and surveyed the crowds outside.\nThe parade looked like a papal visit. South Koreans were welcoming Leon’s return and protesting against the fact that he was even getting a hearing.\n“It’s no big deal, it’s all thanks to Your Majesty.”\nOh Kang-hyuk, head of the association, poured champagne directly into Leon’s glass and bowed.\n“As the national administration, we have to take our own actions, and that’s why we’re holding this meeting, I hope you understand.”\n“Hmm. I take no offense at your request for me to come, but this land is not yours.”\nBy nature, Leon is nothing more than royalty of a fallen kingdom and no survivor would ever be treated this way by the state but he alone overrides all precedents.\n“The hearing is just a little screening for illegal weapons possession. In South Korea, it’s illegal for civilians to carry weapons, so I have no choice.”\n“I thought hunters were allowed to carry?”\n“Even hunters with a hunter’s license are only authorized to carry state-certified items. In fact, you can’t get a permit for anything bigger than a rifle anyway.”\nThat was fine with the Kikiruks. Their armored cannons and other firearms are registered with the South Korean government.\n“The problem is Lord Yakt Spinner’s weapons, which are apparently the size of——”\n“I see. It seems that Lord Spinner was reluctant to expose them for fear of something like this happening.”\n“Yes, but Lord Spinner is a licensed hunter, so I’m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.”\n“Pretty accommodating, huh?”\nLeon’s gaze sharpened but Mr. Oh only shrugged it off with a smile.\n“After everything Your Majesty has done for our country, how could we dare to treat you with disrespect?”\n“Of course not.”\n“Of course it is, but the administration has a certain amount of dignity, and I would be honored if you would at least look upon President Ahn Dong-gil and me with some respect—”\nLeon realized that the old association president was going to be thoroughly practical.\nStill, if he could bend over and make a nice gesture first, there was nothing the king couldn’t do for him.\n“It is deeply unpleasant to be questioned by commoners, but I must protect my dignity as king.”\nThe jury was out even before the hearing began. The political thugs entered the hearing confident that they could get away with it.\n“Illegal arms acquisition and illegal manufacturing! Trillions in tax evasion and slave labor! Religious coercion! What a horrible organization!”\nUgh, what’s wrong with you?\n“Take responsibility and resign!”\nCrazy bastard!",

      "content": "Chapter 178:\nThe Aftermath of Resignation\nPolitics is all about bringing down the other guy.\nIt’s a game where anything goes in the name of taking power.\nMost of what happens there is dirty, vicious, and relentless.\n[Ahn Ahn-gil administration! Successful export of TTG Temple drone weapon system! Will it achieve the 3rd place in the world defense export ranking this year?]\n[K-Defense’s success story with TTG Temple]\n[[K] TTG Temple, where Japan envies, Russia is jealous, and the U.S. begs to come. K-Agriculture and Cooperative Development Plan Announced!]\nIn that sense, from the perspective of the main opposition party, the TTG Temple must be quite an eyesore.\nWith the full support of President Ahn Ahn-gil and Oh Kang-hyuk, the head of the Korea Hunter Association, the organization’s growing stature was the Ahn administration’s undoing.\n“What are we supposed to do about that?”\n“Well, there are a lot of nooks and crannies to touch——”\nOf course, from the opposition’s perspective, it’s natural to want to bite the hand that feeds the current regime but the reaction from within is deeply disturbing.\nIn fact, the agricultural sector has begun to fill up with devotees of Goddess Demera, and the number of ordinary citizens converting to the TTG Temple religion is frightening.\n“In my country alone, there are already three million worshippers. It’s a religion that’s been around for a little over half a year. Japan has a similar number, and the rest of the world has long since passed the 10 million mark.”\nIt’s only a matter of time before TTG Temple becomes Korea’s largest religion, and they wondered if it could become the world’s largest religion in just a decade.\nIn the meantime, illegal combat activities and illegal possession of weapons were discovered in Taiwan.\n-Wow, what? There are so many demons in Taiwan?\n-Pin-point sniping of the Fallen after the gas attack.\n-What is this super robotic weapon?\n-Vulcanus is crazy. He destroyed two Archdemons.\n-What is this, an emergency prayer meeting at the altar of the War God?\nThe opposition, like the Ahn administration, was appalled by the TTG Temple’s actions.\nIllegal warfare in another country and killing enough high-ranking officials to change the administration?\nOf course, the vast majority of those killed were Taiwanese citizens, but some were foreign ministers and ambassadors.\nIt’s a perfect example to bite on.\n“Why don’t we take this opportunity to unseat that otherworldly man as the representative of the TTG Temple?”\n“There are plenty of things to attack. We have a serious tax evasion problem, we have open human rights issues, and we’re facing foreign protests over the death of a French minister.”\n“We need to bring down TTG Temple to cut into the ruling party’s approval ratings!”\nOf course, they didn’t realize that the actions of the TTG Temple were motivated solely by justice to wipe out the demons but in the world of politics, that doesn’t matter.\nEven if a miracle drug is announced that can cure cancer around the world, it must be buried if it will benefit the other party.\nTTG Temple, which has grown with the full support of the current regime, including its president Oh Kang-hyuk, will continue to be an obstacle to regaining power.\n“We will pretend to cooperate with the ruling party, but on the same day, we will attack them. There is no legal problem, so if we go to the constitutional court, we will definitely win!”\nThere was a time when they thought so.\n* * * *\n“————”\n“————”\nThe chairman of the hearing stiffened in horror at the senator’s bombshell.\n“Fuck!”\nPresident Ahn Dong-gil, who was watching the video in the presidential office, let out an expletive in a nurturing tone.\n“That, that crazy bitch, why is she doing that!?”\nThe TTG Temple hearing was a consensus of the ruling and opposition parties. He was preparing for a cordial exchange of questions and cultural relativism or something, followed by a plea for attention and cooperation, when—-\n“Oh, this is Representative Ahn Hee-ok.”\nAhn Hee-ok, was the fighting dog of the opposition, a dog who will try to bite for the regime wherever she can.\n“No, but why is she doing that? We had an agreement! We agreed not to touch the TTG Temple! We had a training session on etiquette beforehand!”\nThe opposition stabbed him in the back of the head and the reaction of the opposition lawmakers around him is disturbing.\n“Stop the hearing! Stop it now!”\n“We’re live, Mr. Speaker!”\n“Holy shit!”\nPresident Ahn immediately made a protest call to the opposition leader, but he was unable to stop the hearing, which was being broadcast live.\n* * * *\n“——”\nLeon scowled at the congresswoman who had spoken so rudely to him.\n“State your name, woman.”\n“Did you just call me a woman, I beg your pardon, and this is a hearing, will you please stand up at once?”\n“That’s right, what kind of attitude is that in the hallowed halls of Congress!”\nOpposition lawmakers shouted back as they pointed out the special seat reserved for Leon.\nUnlike the rest of the hearing room, Leon’s seat is in an authoritative position, with a staircase leading up to it, looking down from above.\nHe would get into the hearing room, but there would be respect and agreement for him.\nSouth Korea, at least the Ahn Dong-gil administration, recognizes Leon’s royal authority.\nThey respect the power of Leon before they respect the TTG Temple or Lionheart.\nIn this sense, the current Korean government is reasonable enough. They took the pragmatic route, and their respect for power led to their respect for Leon.\nIt had always been that way, so he didn’t doubt their good intentions.\n‘I don’t think this is an individual rampage.’\nOr they could be emissaries of a third party. Or it could be a ploy by the opposition to keep the ruling party in check.\nRationally, yes. They don’t want to lose this opportunity.\n“Will you resign?”\n“Don’t raise your voice. We’re not at the bottom of the market, we’re at the top.”\n“Come on, Mr. Leon, you must be mistaken, this is a democracy! You only answer what I ask!”\n-Crack!\nThat was it. Lightning crackled outside the hearing room. It wasn’t just one or two bolts of lightning striking against a clear, dry sky.\n-Crackle, crackle, crackle!\nSuddenly, the lightning struck the Capitol building where the hearing was being held. The entire building shook like an earthquake.\n“Could it be God Ultima?”\nIn the hearing room were the worshippers of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods, who realized that this angry divine being was the god of the sky and thunder, and some of the faithful heard the angry words of the god planted in the lightning.\n[How dare you insult the Lionheart King, who shares this Ultima’s thunder crown!!!]\nThe God of Thunder was furious, and he wasn’t the only one.\n-What? The Sun is having an adverse reaction!\nThe sun’s rays melted the concrete of the building’s exterior walls leading up to the hearing room, and an intense flash of the Goddess of Light’s scrutiny descended upon it.\nIt was an anomaly too intense to be dismissed as mere coincidence.\nEveryone in the room knew that the gods were angry on behalf of King Lionheart.\n“Ji, are you trying to intimidate a member of the Korean Parliament, stop this shit right now──”\n“Shut that mouth of yours.”\n“——!”\nLeon’s voice was calm and quiet. However, the fierceness in his voice was overwhelming.\nSenators shuddered and swallowed hard. They realized their lives were worth less than a fly in the face of the Lionheart King’s power, accompanied by the wrath of the gods.\n“I respect you enough to recognize that you are legitimate representatives of the people under a system called democracy.”\nLeon knew how ugly and vocal they usually got, but that was only in their league, not in the presence of the Lionheart King.\n“But you should know that the one before you is not merely the lord of the throne, but an agent of the gods.”\nLeon stared at the councilor.\nWhether it was out of personal conviction or political ambition, there was no way he was going to take the path of insulting the Lionheart King.\n“All those involved in this indiscretion will not receive any protection from the TTG Temple.”\nLeon stomped to his feet.\n“This is the end of the hearing.”\nNo one spoke before Leon strode out of the room.\n* * * *\n“How dare these bastards— how dare they— the Savior!”\nPark Yong-shin, former cult leader of Hanbit Palace, now a member of the Korean Top Ten Guilds and a fanatical TTG Temple devotee sought out a guild leader to retaliate for this untold misfortune.\n“I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it!”\n“Ah— I see, then I— why did you come to see me?”\n“Guild Leader Lee Yong-wan!”\nGuild Leader Lee Yong-wan of the Firebird Guild, a fellow Top Ten Guild, was shaken by Park Yong-shin’s anger.\n“Isn’t it obvious, he’s asking for help?”\nNext to him, Ha Yuri, the Vice Guild Leader and S-class Hunter, served tea and asked what Park Yong-shin wanted.\n“Indeed, Vice Guildmaster Ha Yuri, I’ve heard that you’re the real deal in the Firebird Guild!”\n“No, don’t say that in front of Guild Master, tell me specifically why you’re here!”\nYong Wan stuck out his tongue, “What a strange person you’ve become since joining the TTG Temple.”\n“Guild Leader Yong-wan, I’ve heard that you have a hand in the opposition.”\n“What? No, something like that——”\nA Top Ten Guild is bound to have a weakness or two for the ruling party. Things like bribery and funneling political funds through shell companies.\nRight now, Yong-wan’s Firebird Guild affiliate even had a former opposition lawmaker as its leader.\n“Guild Leader Lee Yong-wan, don’t you want to join the TTG Temple?”\n“——!!”\nPark Yong-shin tapped Yong-wan on the shoulder with a knowing look.\n“You didn’t even show up for the recent meeting on the tax reform bill, and seemed to be doing a good job of attacking Gates.”\nDeliberately failing to attack a gate to blackmail the Hunter Association over the tax exemption bill— the Firebird Guild had a fairly vicious reputation in this part of the world.\n“That’s what a sincere Hunter Guild would do——”\n“From the look in my Brother Yong-wan’s eyes, you are like a thirsty lamb yearning for the true faith.”\n“Who would have thought that Brother——”\n“You witnessed Lord Georgic with your own eyes, you saw the leader of the demons at the Dragon Palace Gate, and what about the Wandering Magic Sword situation?”\nDidn’t you feel anything there?\n“——“\nYong-wan couldn’t answer Park Yong-shin’s serious question.\nHe had been troubled ever since he had witnessed the sacrifice of Georgic and the Knights of Glory at the Jeju Gate.\nHe had seen before his eyes honorable chivalry and glory-seeking heroes.\nThe knight’s benevolent influence had struck a chord with the cynic and realist, and it had continued to stir him through a series of events.\nEven the strongest S-class Hunter had gone mad in the face of Rakshar, the Demon Archduke of Chaos, and even an alliance of S-class Hunters was helpless against Archduke Akasha, the Wandering Demon Sword.\nIn front of Leon’s countless miracles and strength, Yong-wan had truly been contemplating joining the TTG Temple.\n“But— I’ve done a lot of things.”\nYong-wan had done no shortage of illegal things and by the standards of Arianna, the goddess of light and justice, he would be quite the sinner.\n“She is the one who gave even a demon-possessed sinner like me a chance. I know someone who will use his power to forgive your sins, Brother Yong-wan.”\n“Who is that?”\nHmph!\nThe familiar screeching sound came from somewhere, and it wasn’t due to his mood.\n“And how exactly can I help you?”\n* * * *\nThe “resign!” in the hearing room of the TTG Temple Hearing Room went viral.\n-Wow, are you crazy?\n-What did she just say?\n-She’s a bitch.\n-She’s so fucking disrespectful to His Majesty.\n-What the hell are they doing?\nNational hearings are broadcast live. There were many video platforms such as YouTube, and Ahn’s “Resign!” was immediately watched by tens of thousands of people.\nThe number of viewers watching the hearing set a record for the first time ever and it’s no surprise that the opposition would be criticized for this incident but politicians are used to being criticized.\nThey were willing to take the blame and cut down the TTG Temple.\n-Accused of tax evasion of hundreds of billions of dollars.\n-The number of illegal weapons in TTG Temple possession exceeded the limit.\n-Is TTG Temple a hunter’s guild or a private group?\nIn a public opinion war, there are always ambivalent people, and there are always people who are hostile to the TTG Temple.\nRival religious groups, agricultural organizations that are not part of the Demera Order, and many others could be enemies of the TTG Temple.\nThe question is.\n“What do you mean, you’re not going to publish the story!”\n[Oh, we don’t publish negative articles about the TTG Temple, there’s a rumor going around that if you touch the Temple, everything goes weird!]\nYakt Spinner has been hounding media outlets by any means necessary, and even pro-opposition state media have been caught up in bizarre misfortunes since the 9 o’clock news.\nAn editor-in-chief’s malfeasance is uncovered or a newscaster’s flirtation goes viral.\nWhen the best hacker on the planet had his way, there was no way to resist in this globally networked world.\nEventually, the opposition leader spoke up.\n“In defense of democracy and the rule of law, we’re going to bring charges against the TTG Temple! We’re going to name and shame Leon Guild for his corruption and fraud.”\nIn the end, they have the law on their side. The evidence of the Temple’s wrongdoing is too flimsy for them to lose.\nBut they took the religious fanatics too lightly.\n“Where is this asshole?”\n“We should hang him and set him on fire first!”\nDemonstrations were held in front of opposition lawmakers’ offices, and lawmakers who directly criticized Leon in hearings were physically attacked.\n-My daughter had polio, and she was cured by eating rice from the TTG Temple.\n-I had terminal cancer, and Sir Georgic’s Hammer Pilgrimage course restored my health.\n-I was cured of hair loss—!\nIn addition to the blessed products of Goddess Demera, there are many who have been favored by the TTG Temple from all walks of life.\n-His Majesty has avenged the deaths of my parents, who were killed by the Wandering Demon Sword.\n-His Majesty’s priests have purified our land of miasma pollution!\n-He saved us from the hands of the demons!\nEverywhere you looked, the crowd was on the side of the TTG Temple.\n“These fanatics!”\nThe opposition leader Han Han-ho clicked his tongue as he watched the people rise up everywhere.\nCommoners who didn’t even know each other were attacking a member of the National Assembly of South Korea because of a barbaric knife-wielding thug!\nAfter being pelted with eggs, Han vowed to press charges against them immediately, but what he heard next made him cringe.\n“Mr. Representative, the Divine Sword Guild has withdrawn their donation to the party! They won’t be giving us any campaign funds from next year!”\n“What?”\nStarting with the Divine Sword Guild.\n“The Firebird Guild and the Golden Lion Guild have also withdrawn their donations! They’re publicly criticizing us, along with the Hanbit Palace Lord Park Yong-shin!”\nThe majority of Korean Ten Guilds had come out to criticize the opposition, and they weren’t the only ones.\n“Why?”\n“They’ve been friendly to the Ten Guilds since the Wandering Demon Sword incident and they cooperated with the Holy Knights of the TTG Temple during the last major gate incident.”\nIt’s bad enough with angry citizens, but now large guilds, the real power in Korea, are doing this?\nThe withdrawal of the party’s donation was one thing, but the deterioration of the relationship with them was another. Without the support of Ten Guilds in Korea, it’s impossible to run a political party.\n[Our authorities promise a 10 trillion yen grant and a constitutional amendment to relocate TTG Temple.]\nWhen the news of Leon’s embarrassment in Korea came out, the Japanese government set up a TF and demanded that TTG Temple be naturalized.\n-Wow, Japan is crazy— 10 trillion yen?\n-Wow, Japan is crazy— 10 trillion yen?\n-What? Tax evasion? Human rights abuses?\n-Bastards, His Majesty Leon can do it!\n-Aren’t these bastards followers of the demons, just like Taiwan?\nA call came in on the hotline from the presidential office.\n“Mr. President, what’s going on──”\n[You bastard!!!]\nThe opposition leader’s request for cooperation had been ignored and the president threw out the dignity of a public official and hurled colorful insults at him.\nMr. Han had to listen for 30 minutes without being able to turn off his phone to hear how well President Ahn Dong-gil could swear.\nAnd then.\n“This is the second time you’ve called me in Korea, and I assume you’ve managed to reach me through your hotline?”\n“Yes, Princess. We’ve made arrangements for you, and you can come straight in.”\n“Well, I’m going to have to hurry up and get to Naju before the South Korean president.”\nMinister Davidson, dispatched from Buckingham, England, made a last-minute visit to Korea with Princess Diane. Nominally, it was to discuss the Korea-U.K. FTA, but──\n“Are you sure you can go straight to the Lionheart King through the Takeda?”\n“You can count on me, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yorimoto.”\nThe Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan and the President of the New Japan Hunter’s Union Association──\n“General, the Ten Thousand Gods Temple killed our Minister of Economy, and you’re going to let that slide?”\n“Reno Guild Leader, since that minister was a demon, they even prepared this gift to show their gratitude. It’s a good thing they killed that damned demon, and now I’m connected to the TTG Temple.”\nA two-star general from the French Ministry of the Armed Forces was sent as a special envoy for defense cooperation to the Republic of Korea.\nEveryone came to Korea for their own reasons, and that’s not unusual, but the fact that it happened right after Japan’s Prime Minister Fujisawa made his 10 trillion yen remarks made it a strange read.\n-What? Britain, France, Japan, Germany, Belgium, Indonesia, and India are all in South Korea? What day is it?\n-And I don’t see the United States.\n-Haven’t they already made contact?\nSudden visits from big businessmen. And then──\n“Yes, we will be arriving in Korea shortly.”\nA special charter plane for an executive of the Hunter Management Agency of the United States of America was coming to South Korea and the man aboard was Deputy Director Donald Cooper, a powerful American politician and member of the core elite.\n“I suppose being a deputy director of the Bureau makes me a bit of a courtier, hahaha.”\nHe knew he was going to make quite a splash in the already bustling country.\nHe also knew that his visit would be very, very unwelcome.\nThe last time he’d been here as a Hunter Management Agency official, two of South Korea’s S-class hunters had naturalized in the United States.\n“Looks like a mistake by the Korean political establishment has put an outrageous sale on the market, and a bunch of people have arrived with a bunch of gifts ——”\nDeputy Director Donald smirked, thinking of the tycoons who had already arrived.\n“I don’t think they’ll be able to beat our offer.”",

      "content": "Chapter 179: The Proposal of the United States\nWorld leaders are visiting South Korea.\nNormally, this would be good news, a sign of the country’s standing in the world, but for South Korean President Ahn Dong-gil, it was not good news at all.\n“I see. Her Majesty the Queen of England, I stand corrected?”\n“Yes. The Gate has taken much from humanity, but it has also given us much.”\nSince the Cataclysm, the British royal family has undergone massive changes.\nThe biggest change was Queen Victoria’s Hunter awakening.\nThe aging Queen, who was in her 70s at the time, became physically younger when she awakened her magic.\nIt’s not that the old woman became a young woman, but her physical age was reduced by 40 years. It’s not so strange considering that Korea’s oldest hunters, Oh Kang-hyuk, Chun Jin-soo, and Kang Jin-sung, are still in their 70s.\nThanks to this, it was virtually guaranteed that the current Crown Prince would die first.\n‘This princess in front of me is the next Queen of England!’\nQueen Victoria’s granddaughter, Princess Diane, who is also a high-ranking British hunter, dazzled President Ahn with her stunning beauty.\n“So, I’ll leave the formal discussion of this FTA to Secretary Davidson, shall we take a picture?”\n“Oh, yes— that would be great.”\nAhn Dong-gil took a picture of him shaking hands with Princess Diane, and realized that royalty with a little modernization is different.\nAfter dealing with only recently steamed medieval royalty, he felt relatively comfortable with British royalty.\n“So, Princess Diane, what are your plans afterward? My government will take care of you.”\n“Oh, that’s okay, I’m in Korea for the first time in a long time, and I’d like to do some sightseeing.”\nPresident Ahn watched Princess Diane drive away in a plain car and muttered to himself before heading to the meeting with Secretary Davidson.\n“She has backup, doesn’t she?”\n“——Yes, maybe.”\nThe next Queen of England, plus ministers to Japan, Belgium, Poland, and Norway, plus Russian and French generals.\nEven the deputy director of the U.S. Hunter Management Agency openly announces that he’s here to scout Leon.\n“Tell them to increase the number of National Security Agency personnel in Naju, we need to shove tourists and whatever else in there so we know what the talks are about!”\nAfter last week’s opposition “Resign!” incident, the country was in a state of uncontrollable chaos.\nThe TTG Temple fanatics are out in force, protesting to kick the crap out of lawmakers, and the public is blaming the president for not being able to control them.\nNow foreign countries are sending envoys to beat the shit out of him.\n“One representative, that asshole——”\nIf the opposition’s goal was to feed the president a big fat ass, they succeeded very well.\n* * * *\nThe plains of Naju, where the TTG Temple was first established was where Leon took up residence after he cleansed the land of miasma contamination, and enshrined the hammer of Georgic, the Holy Knight of Demera, the Goddess of Life and Fertility.\nIn recent years, the Naju Main Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods has become even more powerful, as its resident holy relics have grown to enormous proportions.\nGeorgic’s Hammer, the holy relics that the Knights of the Ten Thousand Gods inherited from the Lionheart Kingdom Gate, and four Holy Knights.\nEven if they stood still, the entire area of Naju was being sanctified with their exhaled breath.\n“The air is different. I never thought I’d say this, but the space itself has an auspicious aura.”\n“From what I’ve heard, there are over a dozen epic-level items here.”\n“You mean the equipment of the Holy Knights, and half of them are available on——”\n“The Lionheart King– sword, spear, and Holy Grail. Each and every one of them is said to be unparalleled among Epic-level items.”\nIndeed. The scale of the TTG Temple was already the largest in Korea. Even the Maverick Guild in the United States couldn’t compare to it in terms of numbers.\nWhat’s even more terrifying is the power of each individual.\nWhether it’s the mysterious Magician Queen, the Yakt Spinner who wields super scientific weapons, or the recent survivor Vulcanus, there is no comparison in Asia.\n‘You’re saying you’re above them all?’\nLeon’s reputation was already well known in England.\nIt was he who had defeated the Wandering Demon Sword, the culprit of the London Massacre.\n“Princess, these talks are about——”\n“I’m well aware, it’s been discussed before.”\nAfter Leon expressed his displeasure with the whole “resignation!” situation and called the hearing off, Japan made the first move.\nThey offered a 10 trillion yen grant and said they’d like to invite TTG Temple to their country.\nSpurred on by this, other powers, including Britain, sent envoys to the Korean government and Princess Diane was one such envoy.\n“Money is a given,” she says, “and we’ll have to promise a number of changes to the law to accommodate the TTG Temple, which is basically the stakes.”\nThe problem is, all the other envoys know this, too.\nSo what can she, as the next Queen of England, offer?\n“I’ve got the best diplomatic hand a royal could ever hope to play.”\nHerself or in other words, an arranged marriage.\nDiane is thinking of asking Leon to marry her.\n‘I can’t think of a better bride.’\nDiane is still single. She’s not even engaged to be married.\nBut marrying her would mean a seat next to the next Queen of England, a royal estate worth hundreds of billions, and royalty in a country called England.\nBut is that all? Diane was sure her beauty would also be a plus.\nShe had the golden, honey-blonde hair of a full-blooded Englishwoman, jewel-blue eyes, and the toned body of a high-ranking hunter.\nA trifecta of beauty, power, and fortune, she was England’s finest bride-nay, the bride of the century.\n“Is the princess okay?”\n“I’m royalty. Arranged marriages are an old concept, but they still work, and most of all–I like His Majesty Leon.”\nEven before the benefits of marrying Leon, Princess Diane liked him and his firebrand appearance that belied his three hundred years of age.\nAbove all, he exudes a sense of power, unlike the royal authority of the past.\nIt was the difference between a constitutional monarchy and an absolute monarchy. King Lionheart had been an absolute monarch for a long time.\n‘He’s the ideal groom, and I’m sure he’ll like me.’\nDiane saw a high probability of this marriage coming to pass if nothing else happened. As the King of a destroyed kingdom, what could be more attractive to him than the British royal family?\n“You’re sure His Majesty the Lionheart has no other woman?”\n“Yes, from what I’ve heard, he seems to be quite close to the Magician Queen, but I have no confirmation of that.”\n“The Magician Queen–I suppose she’s quite beautiful, but she always wears a veil, so it’s hard to tell.”\n“She may be pretty, but she’s nothing compared to the princess.”\nYes, if she was so confident in her appearance, why would she wear a veil? There were occasional pictures of her on social media, but never full-face.\n“Let’s see, then, if we can get His Majesty the Lionheart King to-”\nPrincess Diane stopped in her tracks since in front of her was a woman in a dress with a veil.\n“Are you Princess Diane from the British royal family?”\nBeatrice, the Magician Queen, came out to greet Diane.\n“Oh, yes–you must be the famous Magician Queen, I’m Diane Grace Phillips.”\nSomething, an aura, overwhelms her.\nThe magician queen of the kingdom of Spero was an otherworldly survivor and the high Priestess of Fle, the Goddess of Dreams and Death.\nThere are many labels for her, but she is always too far away to experience however now she’s right in front of her, Diane felt that she was born queen, something she can feel even beyond her veil and dress——\nBefore the intense authority, Diane felt a strange undercurrent that made her blush, even with the same woman in front of her.\n‘She’s a tough competitor. This won’t be easy──’\n“Then follow me, His Majesty is waiting for you──Oh my.”\nAt that moment, a gust of wind blew hard. It stirred the veil that covered Beatrice’s face, and for a brief moment, her face was revealed before Diane.\n“Ah——”\nThe wind shook the veil, but only for a moment, and as Beatrice straightened it, Diane felt a twinge of regret.\nJust a little longer–to see her face.\n“Princess——”\n“——Yes.”\n“This is going to be hard.”\n“——Yes.”\n* * * *\nAs it turned out, none of the envoys who came to see Leon received a positive answer.\nNot the marriage proposal from Princess Diane, not the special religious law from the French envoy, not the massive investment proposal from Japan.\nNone of them were of much interest to Leon. Until finally──\n“Your Majesty, it is an honor to meet you.”\nThe blond Caucasian middle-aged man in the sleek suit bowed to Leon in courtly fashion, polite but regal.\n“Is it you? Lord Spinner says you know the case.”\n“Haha, I gave Sir Yakt Spinner a small gift, and he seems to have liked it.”\nThe white middle-aged man carefully stepped up to the dais, with Leon’s permission, and offered the box containing the gift.\n“I’m Donald Cooper, Deputy Director of the Hunter Management Agency of the United States of America.”\nA modern day, 21st century elite bureaucrat in the Hunter Agency of the United States, the one that was moving Hunters turned to Leon and spoke in a cool voice.\n“We, the United States of America, can rebuild the Lionheart Kingdom for your Majesty.”\n* * * *\nDonald Cooper, Deputy Director of the Hunter Administration.\nLeon locked eyes with the American bureaucrat who had the audacity to promise to rebuild the Lionheart Kingdom.\n’He doesn’t speak in hollow words.’\nLeon knew in his gut that Donald’s words were neither empty nor hollow.\nThe United States’ annual budget is about $400 trillion. It spends more than $100 trillion on defense, twice as much as South Korea.\nWith the collapse of China and the decline of Russia, the U.S. defense budget has been transferred to the Hunter Management Agency. He heard that the budget for next year alone is 200 trillion won.\nWith an agency that size, it’s not out of the question for them to offer to rebuild the Lionheart Kingdom.\nThis would naturally lead to an invitation to come to America.\n“How can your country offer to rebuild this king’s kingdom?”\nLeon asked with interest, and Deputy Donald drew up a blueprint with a confident look on his face.\n“We’ll give you land in the United States, and you can pick a place with enough land to build a country and plenty of maritime resources for the Kikiruks.”\nEach of Donald’s suggestions was a city with modest American influence.\nEach one is about the size of the Korean Peninsula. The option of building a “kingdom” on that much land was presented.\n“This wasn’t discussed overnight.”\n“Yes, we, the United Nations, have been watching you for a long time.”\nThe U.S. government had a plan to scout Leon almost from the start.\nHe was a medieval-minded king from another world but his character aside, harnessing the power of the goddess Demera to cleanse a polluted land was an irreplaceable miracle.\nNow that the Ten Thousand Gods Temple had spread, a modest cult of Demera had begun to spring up in the United States, and the land was being cleansed of miasma contamination.\nThere had to be some discussion when it was suggested that Demera’s farmers should send a tribute to the TTG Temple.\n“But Your Majesty’s value— excuse me, Your Majesty’s mere existence is of immense benefit to the country. The Japanese government offered ten trillion yen–that’s too low for Your Majesty.”\nDeputy Donald was confident that Leon’s combat prowess alone was worth more than an apostle.\n“And it’s not just you, Sir Vulcanus, Queen Beatrice, and Sir Yakt Spinner, who will be coming with you.”\nIt was a value that could not be measured in money.\n“Religiously, I would like to see His Majesty and the Ten Thousand Gods Temple take root in our country. Of course, there will be conflicts with existing religions, but Christians are not bombers like the indigenous religions of the desert.”\nLeon weighed in on Donald’s and the U.S. government’s intentions.\n“Do you think you can treat this king like the Pope of the Christians?”\n“Vatican City–you mean.”\nYou don’t have to look far to find another country within a country: Vatican City, Italy.\nA nominally independent country with the Pope as its head of state but dependent for the most part on the Italian government.\nLeon rested his chin on the back of his hand and turned to Deputy Donald.\n“This king’s primary mission is to spread the Code of the Gods, but before that, he is the absolute monarch of Lionheart. His authority and power are bestowed by the gods, not subject to human considerations.”\nIn short, a kingdom is an absolute monarchy. Leon had made it clear.\n“Hahaha–of course, I am aware of that.”\nA cold sweat broke out on Deputy Donald’s forehead. The best deal, of course, would be for the TTG Temple to remain a religious shrine, a nominally independent state, like Italy’s Vatican City but the TTG Temple had the power to wipe out a nation, and its leader was a man of transcendent power.\nThe United States had more than a best-of-both-worlds deal in mind.\n“Your kingdom will be a sovereign state, strictly separate from the United States, and we will lend you our support.”\nThere was a strong sense of determination in the man’s voice that he would do whatever it took to make the TTG Temple and Leon a part of his country.\n“Interesting, indeed. However, the rebuilding of the kingdom can be done by this king himself. Well, I will consider it as an option.”\n“Yes?”\nThe words caught Deputy Donald off guard. He’d made such an outrageous offer, and he hadn’t even gotten a positive, if not a definite, response?\nAs it turned out, Leon wasn’t as interested in what the United States could offer as he’d thought; he’d just heard an interesting proposal, that’s all.\n‘I guess that makes him no different from the other envoys before him!’\nDeputy Donald regretted that he had to reveal this hand already, but he spoke quickly to get Leon’s attention.\n“Your Majesty, do you think that the only gods in this world are the gods of the TTG Temple?”\n“Hmm?”\nHe wasn’t sure if he was talking about Yahweh or Allah, but the mention of God certainly got Leon’s attention.\n“Your Majesty, the United States has gods from other worlds, just like you and the TTG Temple.”\nAnd he would be just the god Leon needed, Deputy Donald was sure.",

      "content": "Chapter 180: The Goddess of Fate\nIt is rare for Leon to travel in person to meet with someone.\nHe’s not just a citizen or a knight, he’s a king. A king is supposed to be met by someone, never the other way around.\nHowever, the reverse can also be true, depending on the level of the king.\nFor example, when you go to meet a king of the same level.\nIf he goes to meet President Ahn Dong-gil or Prime Minister, it can be said that they have their own level, apart from the difference in power.\nThe basic premise is that Leon would also go to meet someone of the same level. However, there are exceptions.\nEven he, the Lionheart King, has his own personal curiosities.\n“Is this it?”\nThe diplomatic car carrying Leon and Deputy Chief of Mission Donald pulled up in front of a famous luxury hotel.\n“Yes, please wait in your room and I will have him brought to you shortly.”\nDeputy Director Donald beamed at the thought of having Leon at the negotiating table.\n‘The United States of America, can offer more than any other country to attract the TTG Temple.’\nThat’s the power of America, that’s the power of the most blessed nation on earth.\nOf course, there would be friction with the Korean government in the process, but the White House had already ordered him to secure the superpower known as Leon by any means necessary.\n“Your Majesty, I have to tell you once again, the United States of America is eager to honor you and the TTG Temple.”\nWith that, Deputy Donald held out the papers.\n“Are these immigration papers?”\n“Yes, not only for your Majesty, but for anyone else in your service. If you wish, the United States will accept you, even if it means relocating an entire city, and we will establish your own independent kingdom of Lionheart in a location of your choosing.”\n“——”\nLeon realized that the man seemed rather confident.\nIt could be that he was simply trying to get him to meet an Otherworldly God, but there might be more to it than that.\nOf course, even the wealth of the former Lionheart Kingdom was an enormous offer in a modern democracy.\nBut for the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods and himself, it was worth it.\n“This is not the bottom of the market.”\n“What? Oh, if I’ve made any mistakes, please let me know——”\n“It’s a place to realize the gods. You’ll need to be reverent and clear your mind. It’s not the place to ask for a trade.”\n“Well, I see, I’m sorry.”\nDeputy Donald Cooper tried to defuse the awkward situation by hurriedly ordering the car to stop.\n“Do you know anything about the name or disposition of the goddess?”\n“Oh, the goddess Meriel–oh, no, her name is Meriel. She is the goddess of fate.”\n“A Goddess of Fate?”\n“After the Cataclysm, there was a certain survivor gate that opened in our country.”\nIt was a black gate and every time the Black Gate appeared, millions of people died and countries were destroyed, so the U.S. authorities prepared to attack it with all their might.\n“But the one who actually came out of it was a woman.”\nShe called herself Meriel, the goddess of fate.\n“It is because of Meriel that we, the United States of America, have rebuilt the fastest since the Cataclysm.”\n“She must be a very powerful deity.”\n“I don’t mean powerful in the sense that your Majesty is, but the power of a god is astonishing.”\n[What do you think?]\nLeon answered inwardly to the voice of the goddess Arianna, who asked him what he thought.\n‘We’ll have to wait and see.’\nThere were other gods outside Lionheart.\nThe beast gods and the orc gods were very powerful indeed.\nThere were many gods in Leon’s world alone, and there’s no way the Earthly Yahweh or Allah could be a fake.\nIt was not unheard of for an otherworldly god to cross over to Earth, as Leon had done.\nSoon, an unspoken energy flowed through the doorway, a powerful magical energy that he had been sensing for some time.\nHe recognized it as that of the Deputy Director of the Hunter Bureau and the escort of the Goddess of Fate.\n“It’s been a long time, Your Majesty Lionheart.”\n“Long time no see.”\nThey were Allen Taylor and Minuteman, two S-class hunters from Maverick, the largest hunter guild in the United States.\nThe leaders of the Hunter raiding party dispatched by the U.S. military at the Dragon Palace Gate in the East Sea.\n“Have you been practicing enough?”\n“Haha, this is why I’m the most zealous in spreading the TTG Temple faith.”\nThey had been crushed by the magic of the Chaos Demon Archduke Rakshar and Leon brought him to his senses, but he has since apologized profusely and is an ambassador for the TTG Temple in the United States.\nLeon was no stranger to them, as they had corresponded from time to time.\n‘By the way, they seem to care enough about safety to have someone of this caliber as an escort.’\nSoon enough, the two Hunters escorted a young, fair-skinned woman into the room.\nLeon’s head bowed at the clear aura of holy power emanating from her platinum-colored hair, which did not seem to belong to a human.\n“Greetings, Goddess of the Otherworld.”\nRecognizing at a glance that she was indeed a goddess, Leon bowed in mortal form, a stance that would have surprised those who had known the Lionheart King’s erratic behavior.\n“I see you recognize me.”\nThe woman smiled pleasantly.\n“Even in his human guise, you’re not so far gone that I won’t recognize the aura of a god.”\n“But I am a god of a different world than the one you worship. I thought you were fortunate to have no enemies.”\n“My enemies are only evil. I do not reject it because it is pagan.”\n[I envy the gods that King Leon serves, such clear paradise and divinity]\nThen Meriel spoke in a voice that mortals cannot hear. The only ones who can hear it are the gods in the pantheon and Leon himself.\n[Hmm, I thought she had lost her divinity because she wore a human form, but apparently not to that extent]\nIf she wanted to talk to the gods, Leon could certainly accommodate her.\n[Yes, we have never had anything like King Leon, and it is to our luck that we have met a believer like him]\n[What are you thinking?]\nArianna asked, and Meriel smiled brightly.\n[I merely spoke to you out of pleasure, but that is enough, for the Americans are uneasy]\nMeriel gaze shifted to Deputy Director Donald, who looked somewhat nervous.\nIt feels like there’s some sort of conversation going on between them, but he can’t hear it.\n“So, Deputy Donald, may I have the honor of you introducing me?”\n“Ah, yes, yes, Your Majesty, this is Goddess Meriel. She was the Goddess of Fate in her original world.”\nIt was a familiar story, but it was important to be introduced by Deputy Donald.\n“It is because of Goddess Meryl’s ‘foresight’ that our country recovered from the Cataclysm the fastest and is still thriving today.”\n“Foresight?”\nCountless nations had fallen and perished after the Cataclysm.\nThe failure to capture the initial gate resulting in miasma outflow and pollution of the land along with the collapse of the world’s food economy and the security threat posed by unleashed monsters made the early days of the Cataclysm nothing short of hellish, and it took many nations decades to recover.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. recovered from the cataclysm faster than any other country, and was able to handle the surprise opening of high-level gates and other anomalies with ease.\n“So that’s the power of foresight?”\n“Exactly. Lady Meriel can see the future and prevent it.”\nFor example, the dangerous Red Gate, with its unknown threats inside, or the appearance of the Fluctuation Gate, which caused countless Hunters to lose their lives.\nGoddess Meriel sensed the threat and warned the U.S. government, and the benefits to the United States have been unimaginable.\n“But what does the Goddess’ favor have to do with this king moving to America?”\n“Lady Meriel has the power to ‘confirm’ fate.”\n“To confirm fate?”\n“Yes.”\nDeputy Donald pulled out a stack of papers and gave an example.\nThey were proof that a number of Hunters–some of the top S-class Hunters in the country, to be exact–had had some sort of ‘foreknowledge’ and that the foreknowledge had to be correct.\n“So you have the power not only to make predictions, but to confirm them.”\n“Yes, indeed. The future, after all, can be altered by the slightest action.”\nBut Meriel had the power to choose to fulfill her prediction. In other words, it was a miracle of a powerful god that could save power, opportunity, and even life.\nLeon’s temple and its gods were world-shakingly powerful, but so was Goddess Meriel.\nIt was only a matter of scale, but her power was just as capable of changing the world.\n“Your Majesty, if you are willing to move to our country and form an alliance with us, we can lend you the power of Goddess Meriel on a priority basis.”\n“Borrowing a god, how impolite!”\nLeon’s rant made Deputy Donald hang his head in pain. But Meriel smiled and cooled Leon’s anger.\n“I’m working with the United States government. I’m not revealing my existence for my own safety, but in exchange for my help, they’ve agreed to make me a god and build me a temple.”\n“In exchange for Goddess Meriel lending you her power first?”\n“Hoo-hoo, yes.”\n“And if they betrayed you? Humans are capable of betraying even gods for political reasons.”\nAs the Empire had been, Leon was wary of human indulgence but Goddess Meriel answered, her smile still fresh.\n“Then you should be outraged.”\n“——!”\nIt was Deputy Donald who jumped at the word.\nAnger alone, unaccompanied by power, is meaningless but what a marvelous thing the gods are.\nThe wrath of the gods, and the risks involved, could not be calculated if the United States were to violate its commitments with impunity after all was said and done.\nThe U.S. government was not willing to take that risk.\n“Haha, don’t worry about it. We, the United States of America, are not a rogue nation like Russia or Iran.”\nDeals come with a price and as the most capitalist country on earth, the math is clear in this regard.\n“Today— I’m going to give you a first meeting gift.”\n“A gift— you mean?”\n“Yes, I will secure your fate, but I want you, King Leon, to remember that once I use this power, I will be powerless for a time.”\nGoddess Meriel did not make any outlandish demands for payment from Leon. She knows that Leon would look down on the idea of serving a god with the promise of a reward.\nThe relationship between their gods and their followers is one of natural harmony, a relationship in which each takes care of the other. The ideal relationship is one of respect.\n[I will borrow your knight for a moment]\nAfter consulting with Arianna and the gods of the pantheon beforehand, Goddess Meriel took Leon’s hand.\nShe smiled kindly at him and met his gaze, her crystal clear eyes piercing into his blue ones.\n“Okay, that’s it!\nDeputy Donald shouted for joy, anticipating Leon’s reaction.\n‘Goddess Meriel may have lost her people and her world, but her power is still strong.’\nThere is no way the Lionheart King is unaware of the destiny she represents and the merit of securing that destiny.\n‘Perhaps they’ll try to incorporate her into their pantheon right away, but that would be a problem.’\nThe U.S. government reveres the goddess Meriel, but more than that, they work with her because she’s useful.\nIf the TTG Temple, which already had a sizable following, tried to coax her into joining them, the U.S. government would be left chasing chickens.\n‘But the TTG Temple is too valuable to not take such a gamble.’\nThe Goddess of Life and Fertility, purifying the land and blessing crops, powerful combat protection from the Goddess of Light and Justice, and the God of War and Fire along with stellar iron and the ability to forge it from the God of Iron and Blacksmiths were too attractive.\nGoddess Meriel foresight is a great power, but the pantheon is the whole package.\nIt’s not for nothing that the U.S. government is trying to woo Leon with the promise of a pocketful of territory.\n‘By the way, I’m curious. What kind of future does Meriel see for the Lionheart King?’\nIt was a moment he’d been patiently waiting for, hoping it would also benefit the United States.\n“Whoa——”\nGoddess Meriel sat up in a cold sweat, as was often the case after exertion, and Deputy Donald offered her a handkerchief.\n“Lady Meriel?”\nBut Goddess Meriel eyes were agitated and shaking as she drew in a deep breath.\n“King Leon, you are——”\nA cold sweat trickled down the nape of her neck as she recognized something.",

      "content": "Chapter 181: The Fate of the Demigod\nHappy New Year!!!\nGoddess Meriel is a survivor of a world destroyed by demons, just like any other survivor.\nThe difference is that she is a celestial being, possessing a body molded in human form but her powers as a divine being were greatly diminished by the fact that she had no choice but to escape her world through a gate.\nShe landed in the United States of America, the most powerful nation on Earth.\nThere, the goddess Meriel demonstrated her power to the United States government and was granted the highest level of protection in the country.\nIt has been fifteen years since her arrival, during which time she has met with countless American presidents, sealed their fates, and increased the government’s debt.\nKnowing that there is evil in the world, she and the U.S. government have deferred payment for now, but the time will come when the enormous debt will be paid.\nBut the power of the Goddess Meriel is more important than that, even if it means changing the state religion of the United States of America to Meriel.\nIt was a time when the power of religion was weaker than ever and if the U.S. government really wanted to, it could do it but her power was even more potent on an individual level.\nTo seal a person’s fate is a powerful thing and until that moment, the hunter is immune to death, while everything changes to determine that future.\nThe goddess’s foresight, like the laws of the pantheon, was the power of conception.\n‘So, what is the fate of this man that Meriel saw?’\nDeputy Donald was curious about the fate of Leon as seen by Goddess Meriel.\n“Whoa——”\nGoddess Meriel wiped the sweat from her brow with a handkerchief and stared at Leon. She was rarely agitated.\n“King Leon, you are——”\nShe stared at him for a moment, thinking maybe he was talking to someone in a way she couldn’t hear, but a glance at him told her that wasn’t the case.\n“I’m sorry, Deputy Donald.”\n“What? What do you mean——.”\n“I’m afraid I’m not going to be of much use to King Leon.”\n“What?”\nThis had never happened before. Goddess Meriel had always been cooperative with the United States government.\nHe assumed this would be no different, but she shook her head.\n“It’s not that I won’t, it’s that I can’t. Don’t confuse the difference.”\n“What do you mean——?”\n“King Leon. I can’t be of any help to you, but you should consider the US government’s offer. That’s all I can do.”\n“I will consider it.”\nLeon rose from his seat, straightening his suit, and kissed the back of Goddess Meriel’s hand in farewell.\nThat’s it? He’s really just leaving?\nDeputy Donald could only stare in disbelief, having forgotten to see Leon off.\n“Hey, Meriel——”\nSnapping out of it, he turned to Goddess Meriel. Somehow, the rebuke in her gaze seemed to prove that he wasn’t all that faithful.\n“Goddess Meriel–what in the world is going on here, is it possible–that you have not seen the fate of the Lionheart King?”\n“I have seen his fate.”\n“But how can——”\n“His life is made up of struggles–many struggles have made him who he is, and he is willing to walk that path.”\nThe Goddess’s power had clearly foreseen Leon’s future but it’s both meaningful and not so meaningful.\nThe future is only as good as its foreknowledge.\nIt is the power of the goddess of fate, Meriel, who has the power to seal it but——.\n“It was impossible to seal the fate of King Leon.”\nThe goddess chose the best of Leon’s destinies to confirm it: the one he longed for, the one that remained unfulfilled—-\n“Huh— if he is really in human form——Deputy Donald, you’d better tell the U.S. government that we have to cooperate with King Leon, unconditionally.”\n“I don’t understand.”\nAside from the disappointment of the de facto migration plan, there was something odd about this attitude from the Goddess. She always gave clear answers.\n“By nature, the only fates I can gauge are those with mortal identities, but he was beyond my grasp.”\n“Is that because he’s a demigod? That’s what the YouTubers touted.”\nAt that, Goddess Meriel shook her head.\n“His rank is only demigod, but he is already a god. He has become a concept of something.”\n“What—?”\n“Victory.”\nA god destined for victory.\nMeriel seemed somewhat excited, holding back her pounding heart. As if the cold sweat from earlier could be attributed to that.\n“Countless worlds have been destroyed by demons, and countless gods have lost their worlds, including King Leon and his world——”\nThe difference between them and gods like himself was clear.\n“King Leon’s existence as a living god is the clear line that separates him from the rest of us.”\nA god cannot intervene in the fate of a god.\nShe could see why the gods of the Pantheon could care so much for a mortal.\n‘A god in a mortal body it’s a miracle and could be the greatest force in history.’\nHow could they not love a being who would become a pillar of glory, towering over the gods of the pantheon in countless dimensions?\n“You’d better not do anything foolish to make an enemy of King Leon or try to hold him back, for it will determine the ‘fate’ of the United States of America.”\nThe goddess left her steadfast foreknowledge to her longtime business partner. It was her customary courtesy.\n‘But— there is one more being I could not fathom.’\nAs she watched his fate, she locked eyes with ‘it’.\nSo destructive and insidious–the embodiment of all the violence in the world.\n“Go away.”\nAs if even a glimpse of his future self was offensive.\nHis destructive gaze shattered the goddess’s vision and drove her away.\nThe Lionheart King’s nemesis.\n* * * * *\n-The deputy director of the United States Hunter Management Agency has met with His Majesty Leon! I should have seen it!\n-Fuck! That guy just naturalized two S-class Hunters!\n-Opposition, you bastards! Isn’t this what you wanted?\n-What the fuck are you doing? You’re not going to catch and jail every single one of those bastards?\n-On what grounds?\n-My tears are the proof.\nPresident Ahn Dong-gil listened to the NSC’s report, troubled by the public opinion that was growing worse by the day.\n“The United Kingdom has offered the hand of their next queen, Princess Diane, and other countries such as France, Japan, India, Belgium, and Germany have made similar offers——”\n“The United States. What would the United States offer?”\n“The cession of American territory and— the establishment of an independent kingdom.”\n“The United States would do that?”\nPresident Ahn Dong-gil gulped at the enormous amount of support being offered to Leon and the TTG Temple.\nIf it came to this, Korea had to do something, whether it was enacting special laws or proposing an autonomous region!\n“Mr. President!”\n“What’s going on?”\n“Mr. President! His Majesty Leon wants to see you!”\n“——!”\nHas he already made up his mind to emigrate, that son of a bitch!\nOh no. Look how much my approval ratings have gone up thanks to Leon! If I don’t stop Leon from moving abroad, I’ll go down as the worst president ever.\nPresident Ahn hurried to the drawing room where Leon was waiting for him.\n“Oh, President Ahn. Why don’t you go for a walk?”\n“Ah, yes!”\nThe President of South Korea and the Lion King of the TTG Temple take a walk. Whether he realized it or not, Leon kept the conversation casual and uneventful.\n‘Are you leaving? Are you really leaving? Aren’t you here to say goodbye?!’\nAhn Dong-gil would kneel if necessary–for his country.\nHe was the kind of man Korea needed, especially now that the demonic invasion had accelerated. He would even help elect the next president if necessary.\n‘I’m sorry, Grandpa! I’m sorry, Father!’\nAhn apologizes to his grandfather, an independence soldier, and his father, a democracy fighter.\nHe couldn’t have known that the man he once feared would destroy South Korea’s democracy would become such a force to be reckoned with.\n“By the way, President Ahn. I have a gift for you.”\n“What is it?”\nLeon suddenly pulled a sword out of subspace. The bodyguards panicked at the sudden appearance of the weapon, but none of them dared to draw their pistols.\nIf the Lionheart King sets his mind to it, who can stop him?\n“This is——?”\n“A stellar iron sword, blessed by the goddess Arianna.”\nPresident Ahn knew all too well how precious this item was. But a gift like this at this time? It’s like a farewell gift!\n“Your Majesty!”\nPresident Ahn suddenly fell to his knees. If a reporter had seen it, it would have been all over the news today.\n“Don’t go! Where will you go after abandoning Korea?”\n“President Ahn?!”\nLeon’s eyes widened in a rare moment of panic. He immediately tried to pull President Ahn to his feet, but he stubbornly refused.\n“It’s all my fault, those bastards in the opposition— no, I’m the one who’s guilty for not controlling them, I’ll make it right, please!”\n“You, how can you say that? This king has no intention of leaving Korea.”\n“Hmph, I’ll bet you a match——?”\nI have no intention of leaving South Korea. At that, President Ahn swallowed back the tears that threatened to fall and looked puzzled.\n“You–you’re not leaving for the U.S.?”\n“I’m not going anywhere, not even to the United States. Well, I made a pact to set up a branch of the TTG Temple.”\n“Uh, why not——?”\nAs far as President Ahn was concerned, their offer was seductive. Korea should be able to make a corresponding offer, but things like talking to royalty and ceding territory were difficult, even with opposition.\nSo why did King Leon insist on staying in this small patch of land?\n“A king never forgets a friend who helped him in his time of need.”\n“Your Majesty——”\nAhn Dong-gil felt his heart sink.\nThere were times when he had frankly called him a fanatic barbarian thug knight, but he was also a good old-fashioned, romanticized man, full of loyalty and friendship.\n“But there seems to be a lot of legal issues with this king’s activities, and as you know, he has laws and decency to uphold. I’d like you to take care of that.”\n“Of course. I’ll take care of things like taxes and illegal weapons through Mr. Oh and Sir Yakt Spinner, and you don’t have to worry about the opposition!”\n“I see you don’t care that much about them.”\nLeon chuckled as he patted President Ahn on the shoulder. After the two of them had successfully completed their walk, President Ahn thought, “I’m going to go ahead and kick the crap out of these opposition bastards.”\n* * * *\nOn the way back, Leon boarded the helicopter bound for Naju with Vulcanus, who had come with him as an entourage.\n“You seem to have some doubts, Sir Vulcanus.”\n“Hmm! I don’t understand a bit myself.”\n“I suppose you mean why you didn’t accept the American offer?”\n“You’d be a fool to marry the British and leave Queen Beatrice behind.”\n“She is the princess of a country. Be polite.”\n“What the–! Excuse me. Well, I suppose it’s possible if she’s a concubine, but there’s something wrong with taking a woman who’s not even a virgin as a wife.”\nIn the Lionheart Kingdom, the Lionheart King was usually married to a devout virgin. Leon had an eventful love story of his own, but he chose a virgin daughter of Dinah, goddess of the moon and purity, to be his queen.\n“But the United States offer is more than a bargain, even for me. We could have rebuilt Lionheart once and for all.”\n“Well, it’s the easy way out. But it’s also a path with clear limits.”\n“Hmm?”\nLeon smirked at Vulcanus’ question.\n“In your grand scheme of things, you’d have to settle on American soil to do that, wouldn’t you?”\n“——If so!”\n“This king has given much thought to the fall of the Empire.”\nVulcanus stiffened as if he had heard an unexpected answer, then burst into a roaring laugh.\n“GRARARARARA────!!!”\n* * * *\nThe unconventional courtship of the TTG Temple by the world’s great powers, sparked by the resignation, was causing the opposition’s popularity to plummet by the day.\nFinally, South Korea’s No. 1 opposition party raised its hand.\n“We withdraw our accusations against the TTG Temple and apologize to His Majesty Leon Dragonia Lionheart for causing him distress.”\nThe formal surrender was accompanied by a public press conference by the opposition, which has since undergone a major internal shakeup due to its plummeting approval ratings, and a new party leader who chastised the members of the committee.\nThe opposition party elected a large number of representatives from the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods in an attempt to rebound in the polls, so the ruling party also joined the race for them.\n“In the name of the Goddess of Light and Justice, we will bring about a just judicial system reform, people!”\n“With the authority of the God of War, Petos, let’s root out the demonic bastards!”\n“I, the son of Mokpo, will build a shrine to the God Poma, and the presence here of the Kikiruk chieftain Leonardo Antersect Claudius is proof of that!”\nAnd with that, a ripple began to rise in the political circles of the country, tantamount to a revolution.\n* * * *\nWith China torn apart into 53 countries, the Heilong People’s Republic had borders with Vladivostok, Russia, and Kaesong, North Korea.\nOf course, after the collapse of China, these borders became fairly unimportant, as the 53 remnants of the old China, while still huge as a nation, had neither the power nor the military to manage their borders.\nAfter the cataclysm, North Korea had long since become a living hell, with its only sponsor, China, having gone rogue, and the number of defectors increasing by the day.\n“Hmph— Hey, Mr. Koo, are you sure you want to cross that river?”\n“I’m thinking about it too.”\nKoo Dae-sung had remained in the Heilong since the massive gate incident two months ago, and was in anguish as he watched the frozen Tumen River in front of him.",

      "content": "Chapter 182: Koo Dae-sung\nIt was an open country.\nThe only proper road was the big highway that led into the city. Even that was unmaintained and half-hidden by overgrown bushes and weeds.\nEvery time he stepped on the broken stone pavement, pain shot through him. The boy gasps for air, as if he believes there is life at the end of this crude road.\n“Hmph—! Hmph—!”\nHe pounds the pavement with all his might, just to stay alive and find somewhere to ask for help.\nIf I see someone, I’ll tell them——.\n“Hmph—!”\nEven the boy knows what a stupid idea that is.\nThose lazy thugs think they’re parasites.\nThey don’t pay their taxes, they’re ragheads who set mountains on fire.\nBut they are abandoned.\nThey live off the land contaminated with miasma, without any help from the government.\nThey are so poor that they can’t survive without burning mountains to make coal.\nThere is no way they would do anything to save themselves from such treatment.\nThis country has been like this for a very long time.\nStill.\nHe heard rumors that a town a couple hours’ drive down the road sells produce grown with fire. When his father met the village chief, who drove a truck and bought the produce, he asked him in disbelief.\n[I don’t see many monsters around here these days, are the mercenaries doing some work?]\nThe chief smirked and shook his head.\n[It’s them, as usual.]\n[But why are there fewer monsters?]\n[It’s unconfirmed, but I hear there’s a group of people roaming around here these days, offering to catch monsters for free]\nHunt monsters and protect people for free?\nIt’s a rumor, albeit a rural one. But the young boy listened to the story as he and his father walked around the town.\n[What kind of people are they?]\nThe old man, the village chief, scratched his head and said a name that finally came to mind.\n[I hear they’re chivalrous—]\nChivalry.\nEven for the people of Hwajeon, who lived a backward life far from civilization, the concept was too old and outdated.\n[What a bunch of clueless people]\nEven though they had dismissed the story as silly, it was strangely deeply embedded in the boy’s mind.\nWith the story in his mind, he runs.\n“Ha, ha—! Ha—!”\nHe races down an old, worn road with only traces of pavement left.\n“Ki-sa, ki-sa, ki-sa—!”\nWith the glow of the city ahead, just a little further, just a little further, just a little further away──\n-Crack!\nA sharp piercing sound grazed the boy’s leg.\n“Ah—!”\nA short burst of breath, and a harsh impact sent him crashing to the ground at the same speed he was running.\n“Ah, ah, ugh—!”\nThe pain is so intense that he can’t even scream. His knees, which were the source of the initial impact, ache like they’ve been shattered, and the sting of his skin feels like he was cut to the bone.\n-KEEEEEEEEEN—!\nOnly his eardrums catch the sound amidst the agony of his entire body. He looks up to see a pair of bloodshot eyes watching him in the darkness and gulps.\n“Ah, no. Don’t come—!”\nThey are beasts of the forest, otherworldly monsters that can’t even be defeated with a firearm. The only thing they have in common is——.\nBoth the forest beasts and the otherworldly monsters see themselves as prey.\n“Help me——.”\nThe boy knows in his bones how meaningless those words are to the monster.\nHe knows his voice won’t reach them, that no one will listen to him.\nBut——\n“Somebody, somebody, somebody help me!”\nEven if there are no ears to hear, the boy must scream.\n-Kyaaah!\nThe moment the monsters leapt with gaping maws at their senselessly screaming prey──\n-Phew!\nSomething cut through the air with the sound of horses’ hooves coming from somewhere.\n-Crack!\nA large spear slammed into the nape of the monster’s neck. At the same time, an urgent voice called out to the boy.\n“Take my hand!”\nThe voice belonged to a man on horseback. He reached out for the boy, who grabbed his arm.\n“Yay!”\nThe man on the horse grabs the boy, lifts him up, and sprints off while the monsters chase after him but the chase doesn’t last long since the monsters were much faster to spur the ground than the horse could carry the two men.\n“Hiccup—!”\nThe boy flinched at the closing monsters, but the man grabbed him tightly and reassured him.\n“It’s okay, I’m not alone.”\n“This way!”\nThere was a group of soldiers there. Primitive warriors, armed with spears, swords, and shields that seemed out of place in this modern age.\nThey cleared a path, letting the man and boy on horseback through, then crowded into a tight formation, spearheads erect like hedgehogs.\n“Let the battle begin!”\nThe man on horseback shouted and the boy looked up at the man through blurry eyes, overwhelmed by the string of hope he’d managed to snatch.\n“Are you–are you a knight?”\nAt the boy’s innocent question, the man smiles, perhaps even more innocently than the boy, and says──\n“I’m trying to be.”\nHe recounted his dream.\n* * * *\n“Whoa—, I think I’m going to live!”\nCaptain Kim Do-han poured a bottle of water on his sweaty face like it was raining. He looked at the people he had saved with a tired face.\n“Man-hak!”\n“Dad!”\nThe boy was a resident of Hwajeon Village, which had been attacked by wild monsters while patrolling the roads.\n“Thanks to Lord Yappy, I found you easily.”\n“I’m grateful.”\nKoo Dae-sung thanked Yappy once again for the communication. Beyond the communicator, he heard a small mechanical sound.\n-What are the test results of the new weapon?\nYappy asked, while Koo and Kim looked at the futuristic firearms in the hands of the soldiers.\n“This is pretty awesome, much more stable and powerful than most magic bows.”\n“It’s like watching humanity evolve from bows to guns.”\nBy nature, the Man-At-Arms are organized around swordsmen, spearmen, and archers.\nHowever, with the arrival of the Kikiruks and the establishment of Yakt Spinner’s stardust forge, experimental weapons began to be introduced.\n“Shouldn’t we just arm all our soldiers with these? They seem to work well enough against the monsters at the Gate.”\n“But it doesn’t work against the high-tier monsters. They’re still nowhere near the physical prowess of a high-ranking Hunter, especially the ‘Knights’.”\nKnights of the Lionheart have an aversion to ranged weapons, as Leon’s example has made widely known.\nThey don’t mind soldiers using ranged weapons, but they despise the idea of knights using them.\nThis may seem like anachronistic prejudice and arrogance, but the reasoning was simple.\n“Any knight weaker than a ranged weapon is unchivalrous,” they said, “and when you’re a Holy Knight, you could slaughter a legion with one of these and not even snort.”\nThey knew all too well that a weapon of this magnitude would be useless against a knight–who didn’t meet the standards of a superhuman, let alone a Holy Knight.\nThey didn’t even have to go as far as Leon, the Grail Keeper, because Holy Knights like Yakt Spinner, Beatrice, and Vulcanus, were a natural disaster in their own right.\n“When is our old knight going to be like that?”\nEven as he said it, Kim Do-han didn’t think it was realistic.\nThe only knight in the unit, Koo Dae-sung, was a man of persistence and patience, but he couldn’t compare to the natural talents of Han Ha-ri and Chun So-yeon.\n‘But he doesn’t give up.’\nKim Do-han was hopeful that Koo Dae-sung would eventually fulfill his dream.\n“By the way, there’s been a lot of monsters around here lately.”\n“Well, it’s Heilongjiang, and the gate management sucks. Besides, this is the former Korean Autonomous Region, Yanbian. They have enough on their plates, they don’t need to take care of ethnic minorities.”\nA couple of months earlier, TTG Temple fighting force had been dispatched to defend the granaries of the Heilongjiang People’s Republic during a major gate incident.\nKnight Koo Dae-sung and hundreds of Man-At-Arms, along with mercenary hunters hired by Yappy, succeeded in defending the Granary, but when Koo Dae-sung saw the conditions in the Heilong People’s Republic, where dungeon breaks often left people dying, he decided to stay behind.\nSo the one remaining knight and the fifty or so Man-At-Arms did a lot of work for two months.\n“Anyway, let’s finish this job and go to the city to rest. It’s December already. The monsters should be less active, so it should be fine.”\n“We’ll roam around a bit longer, then we’ll go into winter.”\nWhile the world was still buzzing with Leon and the TTG Temple, Koo Dae-sung and his friends were also making a name for themselves in the Heilong People’s Republic.\nThey travel the country, killing wild monsters and saving people for free.\nSomeone once commented that their travels sounded like a knight’s tale.\nKoo Dae-sung refused to be interviewed, saying he wasn’t a good enough subject.\n“Mr. Koo, eat some corn here.”\nKim Do-han offered Koo some of the steamed corn that the residents of Hwajeon Village had served him.\n“I’ll eat it.”\nAfter eating the steamed corn, Koo Dae-sung looked shaken.\n“What’s wrong, is it tasteless?”\n“No, corn is sweet and delicious. But——”\nKim chuckled, as if realizing his unfinished sentence.\n“It’s not like eating at the TTG Temple, though.”\n“I heard these people lost their land to miasma pollution and ended up here.”\nMonsters aren’t the only thing the gate unleashes during a dungeon break.\nThe dense magical energy inside the gate spills out as well, contaminating the land.\nCrops can’t grow and people can’t live on land contaminated with miasma so many people have been displaced, and they are just one of the many.\n‘With the blessing of the Goddess Demera, we can——‘\nDemera is the Goddess of Life and Fertility. Her blessing cleanses the land of miasma contamination and blesses the crops that grow in it.\nThose who eat the crops do not fall ill, and those who do are healed.\nThe knightly virtues of Arianna, the Goddess of Light and Justice, and Petos, the God of War and Fire, were honored in the Lionheart Kingdom, but what the common people needed most was Demera, the Goddess of Life and Fertility.\n‘No, it is not for me to decide the order of the gods.’\nKoo Dae-sung realizes he’s been thinking blasphemous thoughts.\n“Lord Yappy, the operation was a success, but I have one request.”\n-Hmm?\n“Would you be so kind as to send one of the Clerics of Life and Abundance from the Temple, it would be good to have someone in this area to teach the Code of Goddess Demera.\n-Goddess Demera’s priests are all busy at the moment. No one is available.\n“Yes——.”\nKoo Dae-sung felt sorry for them. Right now, what these people, these commoners, needed most was a place to live.\nOf course, it was urgent to rid the area of monsters, but the miasma pollution was bad enough to force them into the mountains like this.\n-His Majesty said that you shall teach them the code of the Goddess Demera, and let them tend the land.\n“Me?”\nKoo Dae-sung only knows the Code of the Goddess Demera by heart. Unlike the priests of the TTG Temple and other priests, he can’t even use the holy code properly.\n“Do you think I can just write down the code and preach it?”\n-Yes.\n“If that’s all you need, then— but I think it would be a good idea to send a proper cleric later, when we can afford it.”\n-Considered.\nThat was the end of the communication with Yappy. After this battle in Hwajeon Village, Koo Dae-sung plans to fly away for the winter for the time being. It wouldn’t be a bad idea to travel around the region for a while, spreading the teachings of Goddess Demera.\nHe wasn’t sure if they would be so quick to believe in the teachings of the gods of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods, but he decided to do what he could for now.\nSo he traveled around the Heilong People’s Republic for a few days, spreading the goddess’s teachings.\n——————-\nA man came to the hotel in Yanbian where they were staying.\n“Who are you?”\n“I heard that if I come here, I can meet my compatriots from— South Korea.”\nHe was a North Korean.",

      "content": "Chapter 183: Koo Dae-sung (2)\nDecember was a month of storms: Taiwan crisis and South Korea TTG Temple hearings.\nNow it was the time for the year-end settlement.\nWhile everyone else was in a hurry, Leon stood back and looked at the thriving TTG Temple.\nAfter the hearing debacle, Leon accepted the opposition’s apology.\nForgiving them for their rudeness and disrespect was a big step for Leon.\n[Ahem, you shouldn’t have forgiven them so easily.]\nTatar, the God of the Sun and Judgment, mentioned the opposition leader’s kneeling apology.\nHe, along with the Goddess Arianna, is in charge of the kingdom’s laws and their punishments, and his code draws a firm line in the sand at disrespect for the king.\n[His head should have been cut off, salted, and posted throughout the country, to make those who dishonored the Lionheart King pay for their insolence and to show your majesty.]\n[Sun, I do not know what you mean, but this is Earth, and our laws are different from theirs.]\n[Light, this world will soon have to follow our laws. They are too weak to face evil and do not know how to fight. If it weren’t for the Lionheart King, they would have ended up being annihilated by the demons.]\nHe wasn’t wrong. Even the best S-class hunters in both Japan and Korea could not defeat the Demon Archduke Akasha.\nEarth has been fortunate enough to benefit from a dimensional rift that has allowed them to survive to this point.\n[But Leon, my knight, I think it’s a shame you rejected America’s offer last time]\nGoddess Arianna must have liked the idea of America rebuilding the Lionheart Kingdom and a few gods agreed with her.\nHeto, the God of Iron and Smiths, coveted America’s resources.\n[It is one thing to fall into the arms of a great nation, but another to gradually become irreplaceable to them. As far as I can see, the land is a land of natural blessings]\n“You’re right, that land is special even on this planet.”\nIt was a land of natural blessings, not only in terms of oily soil, but also in terms of all kinds of natural resources.\nIf the gods of this earth favored a country, it would definitely be the United States.\n[Ahem, conquest, after all. Big nations are best left for last]\nPetos, the God of War and Fire, is already dreaming of a war of conquest. He hopes to bring war to the land and spread the fame of the Lionheart.\n[Conquest need not be by war, for the land is wide, and my favor knows no bounds beyond the horizon]\nThe Goddess of Life and Fertility spoke of gradual inclusion. But the Tatar of the Sun and Judgment countered.\n[The people may need the goddess’ hand to cleanse miasma for now, but when the job is done, they will turn their palms over, just as the Empire did].\n[Sun is right, and this time we mean complete domination by the Lionheart. Vulcanus was right when he said this]\nThe gods had different ideas. Leon would have to reconcile their opinions and come to a conclusion, but in the end, he was the one who had to decide.\n[What was my knight’s plan? From what you say to Vulcanus, I’m guessing you have your own reasons for staying in Korea]\n“By nature, people are fickle, often changing their positions with the flip of a palm after they’ve been favored. Politicians are such creatures, I suppose, just as the Empire was.”\nThis was not the case with Lionheart’s courtiers. Lionheart was ruled by an absolute monarch, whose authority was granted by a god called the Lionheart King.\n“These are chaotic times, and they’re stuck with us, but in time, they’ll rise up and get greedy, and some of them already are.”\nSo what is needed to rebuild the TTG Temple, and by extension, Lionheart.\n[A country must be built, too; but is there any suitable land?]\n“Sir Spinner has some land in mind.”\n[Hmm? I think I know where it is. Hmm? Is that what you had in mind when you left the knight there?]\n“I am a monarch before I am a knight. A monarch’s actions must be grand.”\nHe stayed in Korea even as he gave up on going to America. The gods seemed to have a general idea of where Leon thought the land was.\n“But first, there are nations to be destroyed.”\nLeon turned his gaze to the far horizon, where only the gods knew it was approaching the north.\nAnd──\n-Your Majesty. I have received word from Koo Dae-sung, a knight in the Heilong People’s Republic. Your Majesty’s judgment is required.\nIt came at the right time, like fate.\n* * * *\nAfter the massive Gate outbreak, Koo Dae-sung, who remained in the Heilong People’s Republic, traveled across the country hunting down the monsters released from the Gate.\nThey were invaluable in a developing country that didn’t have the ability to properly capture gates, nor the ability to capture all of them before the dungeon break.\n“Thank you, knight!”\n“How can I repay this favor——”\nKoo Dae-sung’s reputation grew as he was cheered and thanked by the people.\n“Whoa—! Whoa—!”\nIt was the time for everyone to take a break but Koo Dae-sung was still practicing today, wielding his sword.\nThanks to his growing reputation in the area, he’s been given a workout space courtesy of the residents and the hotel manager, which keeps him motivated to keep training.\n“Wow, you work hard.”\n“Mr. Kim.”\n“Didn’t you get bitten by a big guy today, the Shovel Tiger or something? Why don’t you get some rest?”\n“I put some medicine on it and it’s better.”\n“Man, you should know when to rest.”\n“Haha——”\nKoo Dae-sung laughed, but inside he couldn’t.\nHe was still a Class B Hunter. The Shovel Tiger was an upper B-class monster and he had managed to capture a monster of that caliber by risking injury.\nWhat if it was Han Ha-ri?\nOr Chun So-yeon? Or Kim Jae-hyuk? Or Han Soo-ho?\nNo, they wouldn’t need a special attack that risked their lives like he did.\n‘Not good enough. I’m not good enough, I can’t even use the Holy Law yet.’\nHe prays steadily to Arianna, Goddess of Light and Justice and to Petos, God of War and Flame.\nWhen he introduces the villagers to Demera, the Goddess of Life and Fertility, he prays to her as well, but Koo Dae-sung has more faith in the first two.\nHe wishes he could borrow their strength to become a knight himself.\nHe is not good enough and has no natural talent so all he can do is try but a nagging question stops him in his tracks.\nIf he’s running in the wrong direction, shouldn’t he fix it?\nWhat if what he accomplished is undervalued?\n“Because challenges don’t need the approval of others.”\nAt such times, the words of the old knight lift him up.\nDon’t worry about what others think.\nYour challenge must continue.\n‘Yeah, my challenge doesn’t need anyone’s approval.’\nNo one. Not even His Majesty Lionheart or the gods themselves.\nThat was the legacy that Jerea of the Twilight left him, and it was the reason he would not give up.\nAnd so Koo Dae-sung continued his chivalrous civilian service.\nAt first, it was to save people whose lives were threatened by the harsh conditions, but eventually, people would come to him for help without having to go looking for it themselves.\n“Sir, a gate has appeared near my village, and I’ve asked the People’s Army for help, but they won’t do anything!”\nAmong them was a request to clear the gate.\n“Knight. Could you please teach us more of the teachings of the Goddess Demera? We want to thank her and build an altar, but we don’t know if we can do it alone.”\nOthers came seeking the doctrines and teachings that Koo Dae-sung had begun to spread.\n“That’s the truth. Why would I come all the way here and lie?”\nAmong them, the story of the man who visited Koo Dae-sung today is remarkable.\n“I’m telling you, I escaped from the camp in Hoeryong!”\nThe man’s identity was a surprise.\nHe was a North Korean defector who had escaped from a political prison camp in Hoeryong, North Korea, over the Tumen River.\nHe told them it was a North Korean political prison camp, and that all kinds of people were held there, but that wasn’t what surprised him.\n“Monsters–they’re managing the camp?”\n“Yes. From one day to the next, some monsters, not the People’s Army, took over the camp and took away the people in the camp.”\nNon-human beings are taking over the camp and taking people with them. If that was true, it wasn’t normal.\n“Maybe they’re orcs or something——”\n“No, they’re monsters! I’ve seen orcs and goblins and such a few times, but they’re nothing compared to these evil things!”\n“No, then how on earth did you escape from the gulag and come all the way across the Tumen River to Yanbian?”\n“I’ve been in the smuggling business for a long time, so I have a route that only I know. I escaped alone and crossed the Tumen River.”\nThe man looked frustrated at Kim Do-han and the others, who didn’t believe him so Koo Dae-sung asked Yappy over the comms.\n“That’s right— Lord Yappy, have you checked?”\n-With our reconnaissance assets, the camp’s activities are extremely normal.\nHe asked Yappy to check and see what he could find out, but nothing changed.\nSure, there were horrific abuses going on in the camps, but that’s just the normalcy of the North Korean regime.\nNoting that there was no sign of a monster, Yappy doubted the defector’s testimony.\n“It’s real, it’s real!”\nThe man shouted in frustration and he didn’t seem to be lying, which made Koo Dae-sung even more puzzled.\n‘There’s no reason for Lord Yappy to lie, and his information was never wrong in the first place.’\nIt was Yappy’s overwhelming reconnaissance assets that allowed Koo Dae-sung and his troops to sweep across the Heilong People’s Republic and kill the monsters so quickly.\nWith real-time scans of the entire country and point assignments, Koo Dae-sung only had to plan ahead and hunt the monsters.\nHowever, this time, the defector and Lord Yappy have different scouting information. Logically, he should assume that the defector is lying, but——\n“Why don’t we go there first?”\n“No, Mr. Koo. That’s a bit——”\nCaptain Kim Do-han was uncomfortable with Koo Dae-sung’s suggestion.\nKoo Dae-sung work in Heilong has been possible only because of their unrequited goodwill and coordination with the immigration administration.\nGoing to Hoeryong was not a place for such consultation or cooperation, it was North Korea.\nThe world’s most closed dictatorship, with no understanding of what it means to cross the border of a controlled country that hasn’t relinquished power in the face of horrific hunger and poverty since the collapse of China.\n-Irrational. If you want to do relief work, I’d suggest you go somewhere else.\n“There are some things that bother me.”\n-What?\n“Lord Yappy, didn’t you say that your satellites showed that the camps are as usual?”\n-Yes.\n“But where did these monsters come from?”\n“——-“\nYappy sent an unspoken message to Koo Dae-sung that he was stating a fact he hadn’t mentioned but Koo continued.\n“We’ll see what we can find out. We’ll have to cross the border, but with Sir Yappy’s stealth drones these days, we should be able to sneak across undetected.”\n“——-“\nYappy thought strategically for a moment.\nThe uniqueness of North Korea and the pressure of crossing the border, in truth, neither of these things are particularly unsettling.\nTTG Temple, who had already invaded Taiwan and crippled the administration, didn’t need to worry about North Korea’s protests.\nIt’s a well-oiled machine that doesn’t want variables.\n-You are acting in the name of TTG Temple. You must be authorized by His Majesty.\nYappy deferred the decision to the Supreme Decider.\n[Do as you please]\n“Thank you. But—are you sure you don’t mind? I’ve heard that you’ve been called to hearings lately about the Taiwan thing, too.”\n[This King is the one in charge of it all. You do your duty, and the blame falls on me.]\nLeon’s approval had been given so there was no reason to hesitate any longer, then.\n-Will wait a day. I will send a package for infantry support.\nA day later, Yappy sent a reinforcement package to the scheduled point.\nSeeing the support package descending from space, Koo Dae-sung began preparations to cross the Tumen River.",

What kind of material is it?\"\n\"I heard Lord Yappy said it was some new material or something.\"\n\"The Iron Holy Knight makes all sorts of weird stuff.\"\nSupplies for reconnaissance support: cold gear, new armor, and drones.

If you say things like Kim Il Sung is God or the sun in front of His Majesty, you'll have your head blown off that day.\"\nWhat Leon hates as much as the demons is cults that call themselves gods and push false beliefs.\nFor Leon, even a North Korean who has been indoctrinated his entire life, he didn't know what kind of anger he would feel if someone said Kim Il Sung was God or the sun.\n\"It's not far across the river. Just follow me.\"\nTrue to his word, it was only a few kilometers across the Tumen River to the Hoeryong camp.\nFrom the moment they crossed the river, they were in North Korean territory. Compared to the 3.8th parallel, the territory of Heilong and North Korea on the banks of the Tumen River was incredibly close, but it was also heavily fortified to prevent defection.\nHowever, crossing the Tumen River was not as difficult as one might think, as the route was normally used for smuggling and trading with the North Koreans.\n\"During the hardship march, the republic's government asked the people to renew themselves, and smugglers selling goods in the marketplace did a lot of business with their compatriots in Yeonbyon.\"\nCho was one of those smugglers himself.\n\"I would give the soldiers a few dollars or a few items and they would look the other way.\"\nAs Koo Dae-sung listened to the story, he tilted his head and asked.\n\"Hmm? But why is Mr. Cho Mal-soon in the camp? Didn't you say you were in the camp because of smuggling?\"\n\"That's the strange thing, I was going to stab the People's Army for a few bucks as usual, but that bastard Warrior Park beat me to a pulp. That's how I got dragged into the camp.\"\n\"Suddenly?\"\n\"I was told I was going to be sent to Pyongyang, but luckily I escaped before that happened. If you have the nerve to bother the people like that, you should be sent to Won.\"\nThere were many things they couldn't understand about the North Korean government, so the fed up South Koreans moved on.\nThey arrived at the city of Hoeryong. The camp was located in the center of the city, which was surprisingly deserted for a city that was building its own population not long ago.\n\"It's not such a small city, why don't I see any people here? Is there a curfew?\"\n\"There is a curfew, but it's strange. Even soldiers usually roam around, but it's never been this deserted until I escaped three months ago.\"\n\"Three months?\"\nCaptain Kim Do-han said, feeling that there was something untimely about that statement.\n\"The last major gate outbreak was three months ago.\"\n\"Then do you think the city was wiped out by the Dungeon Break that went off in this city then?\"\n\"Not impossible. The Heilong People's Republic also had a gate outbreak on New Year's Day, so North Korea shouldn't be any better.\"\nThat would explain why there have been so many monsters in the area lately.\nThe monsters released by Dungeon Break had crossed the Tumen River and stretched all the way to Heilongjiang.\n\"The city is too clean for that.\"\n\"Didn't they evacuate all the people because they knew Dungeon Break was going to happen? I'm sure North Korea has that kind of protocol.\"\nWe were moving through the deserted streets of the city.\n\"Wait, the drone picked up a monster up ahead.\"\nKoo Dae-sung's words brought the Men at Arms to a halt. The squad leaders gathered around to check the drone footage.\n\"It's a hellhound, and there are three of them.\"\n\"Why are there so many bastards in this neighborhood?\"\nThe last monster they'd hunted was called the Shovel Tiger, a species that specializes in hunting humans because of their fast legs and tracking abilities.\nThey were bigger than an adult male, so it was difficult to defeat them in a maneuver war except for Koo Dae-sung on horseback.\n\"Let's do it like we did last time. I'll lure it in, and we'll take care of them quietly.\"\n\"Sure.\"\nKim Do-han showed the infantry railguns to the gunners.\nThe infantry railguns that Yappy had made to supply the ranged gunmen under the Kikiruks were naturally quiet, but when converted to subsonic mode with a power reduction, they were almost silent.\n\"I'll bring them up.\"\n\"Be careful.\"\nKoo Dae-sung left Kim Do-han and Man at Arms alone, mounted his horse, and headed for the hellhounds.\nSoon, he spotted the hellhounds wandering around the location the drone had picked up, and threw a rock at them.\n-Thud?\nThe hellhounds spotted Koo Dae-sung and turned their heads.\n\"Follow me!\"\nKoo Dae-sung turned his horse's head and ran in the direction he'd come from, and he could hear the hellhounds stomping on the ground. But that wasn't all.\n-Quah!\n\"Woof!\"\nA ball of flame whizzed right by Koo Dae-Sung, slamming into a concrete house and melting it.\nUnlike most monsters, Hellhounds breathe fire from their mouths. It's so powerful that it can melt through military armor in an instant.\nIt's a monster with a base physical of Class B, which is why it has a difficulty level of B+.\nIf only I could use the Holy Law!\nI've defeated similar monsters in the South many times, but each time I've been helped by a knight's Ranged Nullification holy law.\nThat made him realize how great the Ranged Nullification Holy Art is.\nStill, since becoming a knight, Koo Dae-sung has been constantly cultivating his knightly virtues.\nAmong them is horsemanship, and his talent with horses is no less than that of any other knight.\nIn other words, he's gotten better at it.\n\"Alright, Mr. Koo, you've lured them in!\"\nCaptain Kim Do-han shouted as he saw the Hellhounds chasing after Koo Dae-sung, shooting fireballs behind him.\n\"Rear row! Prepare for railgun fire!\"\nThe elongated guns poked through the densely packed shields.\n\"Fire!\"\nElectromagnetic propulsion rounds pierced the monsters as they fired from shield to shield, in a hedgehog-like formation.\nIt was similar to the way humans hunted beasts when they first picked up guns. But the monsters were no slouches. Even after taking a dozen electromagnetic force bullets, they still flinched and saw an opportunity.\n-CRACK!\nThe Hellhounds fire back but the primitive shields deflect the cannon-like barrage.\n-Thud!\n-Thud!\nThe Hellhounds' fireballs are intercepted by a huddled mass of shields.\nOnce trained and properly equipped, Man-At-Arms gain an additional talent.\n[Man-At-Arms Solid Barrier]\n[Lionheart's Man-At-Arms have become even stronger with their unity, and have trained to block the Lionheart King's strongest charge from the front.]\n-Crack!\n-Thud! Kukung!\nOne after another, the giant monsters collided with it, but the barrier did not collapse.\nHaving trained to block the charge of the strongest attacker, they have gained a knack for blocking the charge of unruly beasts.\n\"They're big! Show them why hedgehogs are scary!\"\nWith Captain Kim Do-han's command, the soldiers pushed back the monsters, stabbing them with swords and spears.\n\"Let's turn around and join them. Group three! Group five! Surround them in wing form!\"\nAt Koo Dae-sung's command, the rear rows of shields on the left and right spread out on both sides. In an instant, the Hellhounds were surrounded.\n\"Dry them out slowly!\"\n\"Forward!\"\nTheir shields were too hard for the monsters to break, and their swords and spears were sharp enough to cut through leather.\nThe battle lasted less than a dozen minutes.\n* * * * *\nAfter that, they were able to reach the camp without much fighting.\nThere, they witnessed the horrific conditions inside the camp.\n\"It's the end of the world. Monsters have taken over the city, enslaving and eating people.\"\n\"It is said that the giant race has more wisdom than you think.\"\nGiants are boss monsters in many gates and powerful entities that start at least Class A.\nThey use tools like humans, and some have bred beasts to be used as hunting dogs.\nIt was a Giant and his hounds that occupied the empty camps in the city of Hoeryong.\nThey took over the camp and used the political prisoners as food to feed themselves.\n\"Looks like the Dungeon Break emptied the city, but not the camp people.\"\n\"So they didn't care if they died?\"\nKoo asked the drone soldiers as they finished their drone reconnaissance.\n\"Did you get an idea of how many monsters are in the camp?\"\n\"The giantI think there are over twenty monsters kept by the giant?\"\n\"Twenty, sir\"\nIf we're talking about a similar specification to the Hellhounds they faced earlier, that's about twenty B to B+ monsters.\nCombined with the quasi-A-ranked giant, it's a formidable force.\n\"That was close.\"\n\"The hounds are one thing, but the giant is the problem.\"\nEven the smallest giants are Class A. Even in the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods, you had to be at least a knight to fight them.\n\"The best thing to do is to call for reinforcements. Someone with a name like Director Chun So-yeon or Goddess Ha-ri.\"\n\"That will take time. We can't use North Korean airspace right now, so we'll have to go around and come back, and even then it'll take two days.\"\nIn the meantime, at least a dozen people will be eaten. The monsters here have crossed the Tumen River to Heilongjiang, most likely in search of food.\nEven now, with the drone watching over them, the giant had not forgotten about the people in the camp that would be used as snacks.\nIt was a large camp with quite a few people, but with less than a few hundred left, a few would be eaten every hour.\n\"Let's call Sir Yappy for satellite weapons support, it'll make this a lot easier.\"\nKoo Dae-sung opened a commlink and requested support from Yappy, but got a disappointing reply.\n-The current orbital position of the military satellite is not in an Asian orbit. It would take four hours to reach the East Asian orbit.\nExcept for geostationary orbit, which is 30,000 kilometers away from the Earth, satellites are constantly moving with the Earth's rotation.\nYappy had recently lowered a space-armed platform from geostationary orbit to low Earth orbit for artillery assassination of a group of demonic followers captured in Europe, and now only reconnaissance satellites exist in that airspace.\n-Reconnaissance support, yes.\n\"Okay, let's see what we can do about it on our own.\"\nIn the end, they're on their own for this one.\n\"I hope it goes according to plan.\"\n\"Knight Koo's plan isn't bad.\"\nAs a commander, Koo Dae-sung came up with a decent plan.\nFirst, he will use the drone to distract the hounds. Once the drone has distracted the hounds as much as possible, they'll take out the remaining monsters one by one.\n\"Come on, let's trust the plan.\"\nCaptain Kim Do-han encouraged his subordinates. He then turned to the unit's commander, Koo Dae-sung.\n\"It's hard to capture a giant with our equipment. Mr. Koo, you have to help us.\"\n\"Yes, I know.\"\nKoo Dae-sung held on tight to his horse and the heavy jousting spear.\nHe might be a newbie knight, but he was the most powerful force in this place.\n\"All right, I ruffled their feathers with the machine gun and they're coming right after me, I've taken out ten of them!\"\nThe soldier piloting the drone called out in triumph, and Captain Kim Do-han immediately called out.\n\"Mr. Han, take control of the drone and keep the hounds as far away as possible!\"\nMr. Han's drone lured the hounds to the other side of the city.\nWhen the drone had lured the hounds to a distance that was too far for the giant to call, Koo Dae-sung shouted.\n\"Let's go!\"\nKoo Dae-sung and the Man-At-Arms followed on horseback, and they soon came face-to-face with the seven-meter giant that had taken over the center of the camp and the hounds that were as big as houses.\n\"Uhhh this one is a little bigger than your average giants, aren't they?\"\n\"Dogs, they seem to have a good price.\"\nThe giant was bigger than I expected and eerily black. Moreover, the tattoos on its skin gave it a magical aura.\nThe Dark Giant, something as sinister as the Dark Trolls I'd seen at the Shifting Gate in the Kingdom of Spero once\n\"Let's be vigilant and attack it.\"\n-Grrrr!\nThe giant bellowed the order as he spotted the Man-At-Arms, and the hounds rushed forward in unison.\n\"Shields!\"\nMan-at-Arms move in unison and the hounds are greeted by a dense, hedgehog-like array of spear blades.\nEach of the hounds was larger than a man, but not enough to break through the heavily guarded barrier from the front.\n\"Wow! This is a bit heavier than the ones we just caught!\"\n\"We can hold out, but what about the giant?\"\n\"Coming!\"\nWhen the hounds were unable to penetrate the barrier, the giant himself took up his club.\nAs skilled soldiers, their barriers are thick, but not enough to overcome the overwhelming mass.\nKoo Dae-Sung spurred his horse forward and caught the giant's eye.\n\"Over here!\"\nThe giant is wise, but only up to the level of the monster. Koo Dae-Sung rode his horse to the giant's attention but\n-Hahahaha!\nThe giant sneered, as if it had read Koo Dae-sung's intentions, and ran straight for the barrier.\n\"Ugh, why is he coming this way?\"\nThe panicked shout of Captain Kim Do-han spurred Koo Dae-sung on, and he charged at the giant. At that very moment\n-Quack, quack, quack!\nSparks erupted from the giant's skin and shot toward Koo Dae-sung.\n\"Crack!\"\n\"Mr. Koo-!!!\"\nBefore Team Leader Kim Do-han could finish his shout, Koo Dae-sung was thrown off his horse.",

There was no dodging the shockwave, which was like an EMP blast.\n\"Thwack!\"\nCaught in the wave, he is thrown from his horse and a terrible pain shot up his spine.\n\"Mr. Koo!!!\"\nTeam Leader Kim Do-han focused his railgun fire on the giant.\n-Ka-kak!\n\"Damn, it's going to eat me alive!\"\nBut the giant's skin was hard. The power had been reduced to reduce noise, and instead of the expensive stardust bullets, the railguns were loaded with magenta processed bullets.\nIn the end, Kim Do-han decided that physical offense would be more likely to draw the giant's attention, so he threw his spear as hard as he could and raised his shield.\n\"Four! Five! Get his attention!\"\n\"Yes, Captain!\"\nThe two groups fall in unison at Kim Do-han's command. The burden on the remaining groups to stop the giant's hounds will increase, but they can't afford to lose their knight.\n-Hahahahaha!\nThe giant swung a huge iron club and the shieldmen try to block it, but it's not enough to offset the impact.\nWith each swing of the hammer, the Man-At-Arms fly a dozen feet into the air, but they still manage to get up and catch the giant's eye.\n\"Spread out! We're at a disadvantage against him!\"\nWhile the two groups were desperately trying to get the giant's attention, Kim Do-han pulled out Koo Dae-sung from the dead horse.\n\"Hey, Mr. Koo, are you alright?!\"\n\"Hmph!\"\nKoo Dae-sung's eyes flashed open as he gulped down a breath of oxygen, pushing through the blood vessels in his heart that had just been clogged.\n\"Hmph, hmph!\"\nFor a moment, his heart stopped. If it wasn't for the stellar plate\n\"Crazy, isn't the star iron armor broken? I've never seen anything like this before\"\nAt Kim Do-han's words, Koo Dae-sung opened his eyes wide and looked down at his empty chest.\n\"The armor was\"\nIt was a shock to both Koo Dae-sung and Kim Do-han that the armor was broken.\nAlthough the armor of the knights and the Man-At-Arms used the same stardust, the content was very different.\nStardust \"cultivated\" armor, intended for mass production, has only a thin coating of stardust inside.\nThis alone makes it a very hard unique grade, but it is not comparable to the high-purity stardust armor of the knights.\nTo date, no Knight's Stardust Armor has ever been broken, but Koo Dae-sung was the first.\nIt's because of me.'\nAnd Koo Dae-sung guessed the reason.\nIt's because I didn't receive the blessing of the Holy Law, the gods, or anyone else\nThe Stellar Iron Armor isn't special simply because of its material. The reason it is invincible is because the knight who wears it is blessed by the gods to strengthen his armor.\nBut Koo Dae-sung was not blessed by any god.\nNeither the Goddess of Light and Justice's blessing of destruction and sturdy walls, nor the God of War and Flame's blessing of battlefield fire.\n-Graaaaaaah!\nAt that moment, Koo Dae-sungs eyes snapped open and he raised his shield, his defensive instincts tingling because of the threat approaching him.\n-Thud!\nWith a dizzying impact, the giant's club bounces off the ground.\n\"Gu, Gu!\"\nFrom the floor in the distance, Captain Kim Do-han cried out with his mangled body.\n\"Damn!\"\nKoo Dae-sung immediately stood up.\nHis whole body felt like it was crumbling, and he felt an overwhelming power disparity but even at this moment, he could only think of one person's teaching.\n[When fighting, one must never hesitate]\nEven in the midst of practical training, the mindset changes when you're in the thick of it.\nAs a young cadet in a knight's class, intimidated by the younger cadets, one of them had the audacity to ask Leon, as he was discussing a valiant charge.\n[What if I'm not as strong or fast as my opponent?]\nWhat's a knight to do when faced with an opponent he's bound to lose to, especially one as experienced as the Lionheart King?\nLeon's answer was not what he expected.\n[You just fight.]\n[.]\n[There's no point in thinking about it at the moment. Running away will only get you a sword in your back. If you're going to die, you might as well die with your chest cut open.]\nNo finesse or tricks, a knight is one who fights from the front.\nHe rides his horse, charges, and does not retreat, no matter what he faces.\n\"Fight!\nJust fight.\nKoo Dae-sung has no great talent or quickness of foot but if there's one thing he's good at, it's fighting.\n\"You bastard, I'm still alive!\"\nNot giving up.\n-Heh!\nThe giant who was swinging his club at Kim Do-han turns around.\n-Kung! Thump!\nRough footsteps echo off the ground, the auditory overwhelm gradually casting shadows and blocking Koo Dae-Sung from the moonlight.\nKoo Dae-sung's hesitation and the giant's imposing presence were like a cornered mouse and a cat.\n-Gulp!\nHe swallowed his saliva and a cold sweat broke out from the tension.\nAll Koo Dae-sung can do is bark loudly and try to hide his fear, proving the idiom that the cornered mouse bites the cat.\n-Gah!\nA black iron club is swung and the moment it hits, Koo Dae-sung would be killed instantly but something happened at that moment.\n-Kak!\nWith a sharp noise, a supersonic projectile hits the giant's finger.\n\"Oh, no, it hit!\"\nIt was the defector Cho Mal-soon. He grabbed the railgun of the fallen Man-At-Arms and fired, and to his surprise, it hit the giant's finger.\n-Yikes!\nYou can't just take down a monster with a high-powered weapon. Giants are resistant to most scientific weapons.\nThe element that makes up their bodies is the magical power of magic stones, their own souls'.\nHowever, a railgun traveling at 40 times the speed of sound would be like poking a toothpick through your finger.\n-Thud!\nThe iron club fell to the ground in agony, and Koo Dae-sung didnt miss the chance.\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"\nKoo Dae-sung leaped off the ground into the spurred giant's arms as if he were flying.\n-How?\nBecause of a momentary lapse in defense, a third party's luck, and an upright frontal assault the giant didn't even have time to react, as Koo Dae-sungs sword pierced his chest.\n-God!\n\"Damn itphew!\"\nThe giant collapsed under the momentum of the stabbing without even having time to clear his mouth of the blood splattered from his chest pocket.\nKoo Dae-sung, who had fallen forward along with the giant, was drawn down by gravity and plunged the Star Iron Sword even deeper.\n-Kwadang!\nDirt was kicked up by the fallen giant.\n\"Uh, uh, Mr. Koo, are you ok?\"\nKim Do-han rushed over and checked on Koo Dae-sung, who was breathing heavily in the dirt as if he couldn't believe what he had done.\n\"Huh! Huh! Huh! I-I caught a giant?\"\n\"Uhhh, yeah, it was a close call, but you did catch it, heheheh!\"\nKim Do-han helped the frozen Koo Dae-sung to his feet and patted him on the shoulder.\n\"Hehehe! I can call you the Giant Slayer now!\"\n\"Uh, please don't.\"\n\"Come on, regardless of my happiness, let's get rid of the rest of the monsters first! Since we made such a loud noise, there might be more monsters around!\"\nSobered by those words, Koo Dae-sung picked up the sword that was embedded in the giant's chest and charged at the remaining monsters.\n* * * *\n\"Thank you, thank you!\"\nAfter that, it was all chaos.\nHundreds of people were still trapped inside the camp, and they were relieved to be alive as they thanked Koo Dae-sung profusely.\nAs he rode in the rear for their escort, he saw the horse that had fallen in the fight with the giant.\n\"I'm sorry. Because of your ugly owner\nA bolt of lightning struck the horse and Koo Dae-sung with an impact that could shatter stardust armor. Naturally, the horse died instantly.\nWhat the hell was that lightningwhat was that?\nIt was too strange for magic. Something didn't seem to fit togetherthe giant hadn't used magic or struck lightning since.\n\"Huh? Where did the giant's body go?\"\nSomeone said and everyone turned to the corpse of the giant that had been lying in the center of the camp just moments before.\n\"What the hell?\"\nThe large corpse had disappeared in the blink of an eye. It was an incomprehensible situation, but no one could care less.\n\"Come on, let's hurry! There might be other monsters coming, so we have to cross the Tumen River quickly!\"\nEven if they couldn't, they still had to take more than three hundred people they saved across the Tumen River, and if more monsters came, the fifty or so Man-At-Arms would inevitably suffer casualties.\n\"Let's go!\"\nLeaving the disappearing giant behind, Koo Dae-sung and the fifty Man-At-Arms led the people out of the camp.\n-\nThe gazes watching them remained silent until the very end.\n-Croak!\n\"Damn it, the hounds I baited with the drone are back!\"\nBefore the battle with the giant, the dozen or so hounds that had been baited by the drone were chasing after the people trying to escape the city of Hoeryong.\n-Aoooooooooo!\n-Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\nThe howl, which seemed to be calling for companions, actually summoned the monsters of the entire city.\n-Croak!\n\"Three o'clock, stop them!\"\n-Crack!\n-Crack!\nThe railgun fires at full power, blocking the monsters' approach.\nKoo Dae-sung and the Man-At-Arms fought off the monsters as best they could, capturing and killing some of them, but they didn't back down, continuing their pursuit as if to avenge their master.\n\"Damn it! We're almost at the Tumen River!\"\n\"If we keep going like this, the damage will be severe!\"\nThe monsters from the entire city had enough power to wipe out the convoy. They couldn't afford to come last and lose people.\nIt was a desperate crisis but at that very moment, a loud noise came from beyond the Tumen River.\n\"What?\"\n\"That?\"\nSomething was flying across the frozen Tumen River. It was the unmanned drone that carried aid packages for the Men at Arms who crossed into North Korea.\nIt transforms into the shape of a motorcycle and charges toward them.\n\"Hey, Sir Yappy! Over here! Over here!\"\nKoo Dae-sung waved urgently, realizing that it was Yappy piloting it. The drone motorcycle, traveling at 600 kilometers per hour, flew past the convoy in a flash and headed straight for the monsters.\n-Full set of internalized weapons. 3 minutes and 37 seconds to initiate combat.\nThe drone carrying the support package unleashed a barrage of machine guns and railguns.\n-Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk!\nHigh-powered railguns and large-caliber machine guns that were not intended for human use, but strictly for Yappys use.\nThe monsters were overwhelmed for the moment by the armed drone that supported them with a generous scattering of limited ammunition and bullets.\n\"Lord Yappy is covering us, let's cross the Tumen River while we can!\"\nThey hurry across the frozen Tumen River. Along the way, they fired support fire from their small railguns to disperse the monsters' pursuit, but the monsters were still determined.\n\"Tenacious bastards, battle is inevitable!\"\nCaptain Kim Do-han, fed up with the opponent's relentlessness, called for an emergency evacuation.\n-Emergency evacuation. Self-destruct sequence initiated.\n\"Eh?\"\n\"Eh?\"\nFor a moment, I thought I'd misheard, but the cold mechanical sound never jokes.\n-Countdown. 10 9 8\n\"Oooosh!\"\n\"Run, run, run!\"\nThe drone motorcycles charge at the monsters, and the Man-At-Arms panic and run across the Tumen River. When they finally cross the river\n-Kaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\nA huge explosion erupted in the middle of the Tumen River, creating a mushroom cloud.\n-Kuwaaaaaaaaah!!!\n\"Aaahhhhhh!\"\nThe blast was powerful enough to blow the Man-At-Arms beyond the Tumen River into thin air.\n* * * *\n\"Yeah, your job went well.\"\n-Crack! The wounded will be transported to Korea.\nLeon, who had received Yappy's report during the night, sighed softly and praised Koo Dae-sung.\n\"Send them meat and liquor of the finest quality, with new armor, of course.\"\n-Receiving orders.\n\"By the way what does Lord Spinner think?\"\nA camp in North Korea has been taken over by monsters, it's not that unusual.\n-An accident caused by a backward country's inadequate gate security. There are many overlaps with previous cases.\n\"No word from President Ahn?\"\n-Says he spoke to Kim via the hotline as usual. All is well with the leadership in Pyongyang.\n\"Is it just a fringe disturbance?\"\nSomething was up and Leon had a premonition about what was happening in North Korea.\nHe has a sixth sense that goes beyond the five senses, a magical phenomenon, on par with the intuition of the Lionheart King.\n\"I want you to dispatch your drones to North Korea. I want to make sure I know what's going on there.\"\n-Order received. Immediate fulfillment.\nAfter giving the order to Yappy, Leon immediately checked the following document.\n\"\"\nThe document was officially sent to the TTG Temple by the South Korean government.\nLeon had received a document like this once before from the Japanese government, when they had formed the Wandering Demon Sword Alliance.\n\"United States of America.\"\nIt was a formal request for dispatch from the United States Hunter Management Agency.\nIt even contained a personal letter from the President of the United States, saying that he wanted Leon and TTG Temple to join the allied offensive against the Black Gate in the center of New York City.\nLeon was told it was delivered in half a day by one of America's newest stealth fighter jets, in order to be both formal and urgent.\n[Greetings to King Lionheart of the great Lionheart Kingdom from the head of state of a faraway nation across the sea. I am Anthony Hobson, President of the United States of America-]\nIt was a formal letter, written in an archaic style. I can't imagine how many professors of classical literature would have been tempted to write a letter that was as personalized as possible for Leon.\n\"Hmmm, this President Anthony Hobson, he knows formality.\"\nLeon, an authority on native royal court culture, marveled at the poignancy of the letter, savoring every word. He closed it and opened the next \"informal correspondence.\nThe sender of this unofficial letter from the U.S. administration, delivered after the president's letter, bore the name of a recently acquired goddess.\n[I hope you have been well, King Leon. I blessed your future and looked forward to our next meeting, but I have an urgent message for you]\nMeriel, Goddess of Fate. What she conveyed to Leon in her letter surprised even him. He will\n\"Lord Spinner, we must urgently organize an army and head for America.\"\n-No negotiations, just a quick departure?\n\"Yes, because the goddess will not take no for an answer.\"\nAfter reading the letter, Leon took the goddess's letter in his trembling hands and his face lit up in a way that would have surprised anyone who knew him.\n\"Karina\"\nWith the name of a child he would never call again Leon prepared to leave for the United States.",

      "content": "Chapter 186:\nThe night is falling and the air is chilly in the king's tent on the battlefield.\n\"\"\nEven on the battlefield, King Lionheart must attend to his royal duties.\nHe has to deal with broken roads and tax revenues, dispatching troops for various disturbances, and squabbling among his multinational allies.\nThe sound of a nib scratching the texture of the paper is unusually loud.\n\"\"\nBlue eyes, just like his own, stare at the figure of the Lionheart King.\nExcept for her hair, which is ebony black against the brilliant gold, the stiffness of her posture and the prominence of her features suggest that the two are related.\n\"What's going on, Archduke of Dragonia?\"\n\"A request for supplies from the Imperial Army, Your Majesty.\"\nTheir titles are formal but it's not just their personalities that make them address each other with honorifics in a setting like this.\nThey've lost a person, and there's no one to mediate between them.\n\"I'll be off then.\"\nThe daughter rose to leave her father's tent, as if she had no business to attend to other than official matters but her father's voice stopped her.\n\"Karina.\"\nLeon's voice was softer, careful as if he were handling a piece of porcelain that was hanging precariously, as if it might break at any moment.\n\"Won't you join me tomorrow morning, at least for a meal?\"\nAs a man who had spent his life fighting orcs and demons, he had only had children when he was the age of an old man.\nThough he was well past a hundred years old, he was as young as any father could be, and he was as cautious as ever with his daughter.\n\"My military duties keep me busy.\"\n\"Indeed\"\nGrand Duchess Karina Dragonia cut off her father's attempt with a stiff tone.\nTheir relationship between father and daughter was cold and stiff.\n\"Yes, I'm sure you're busy, go back inside and get some rest.\"\n\"Take care of yourself, Your Majesty.\"\nInside the tent, the man who remained flipped through the pages of the paper.\n[Do as you will, Archduke of Dragonia! I don't like the sight of you! Disappear before this kings eyes!]\n\"\"\n\"Your Majesty, are you all right?\"\nA soft voice rings out next to him in concern as a girl with red hair and golden eyes comes into view.\n\"What were you trying to do?\"\n\"Uhm You were breaking out in a cold sweat, so I was going to wipe it off for you.\"\n\"Hmph, you're quite the handmaiden.\"\nLeon accepted Ha-ri's attention and saw another approaching.\n-Your Majesty, a low-temperature fluid discharge. Appears to be apnea due to nervousness.\n\"His Majesty is nervous?\"\nHa-ri asked, surprised by Yappy's diagnosis while Leon drank the water in front of him. It was warm, just the right temperature.\n\"Are you all right?\"\n\"It's nothing, I just had a bad dream.\"\nHa-ri gave Leon a worried look. There had only been one other time in her experience that Leon had looked like this.\nIn Lionheart's Last War, the first time she'd seen his sad eyes.\n\"Do you want me to bring you the queen, so you can have a good dream?\"\n\"Not exactly nightmares. RatherI wish I had them more often.\"\nLeon stroked Ha-ri's hair at her thoughtfulness, then turned his gaze to the window.\nThe sky was blanketed in pure white clouds since they were flying through the sky.\n\"How long until we reach the United States?\"\n\"Oh, yeah, now that we'renow that we're past L.A., I think we'll be in Washington, D.C., in about four hours.\"\n\"That's a long time.\"\n\"Well, that's thanks to the U.S. military charter.\"\n-Need to build a private plane? Incheon to Washington in an hour.\nYappy's futuristic cyberpunk charter plane already had blueprints on Infinite Storage. Though in this day and age, we might consider a maglev ocean train or intercontinental orbital transportation.\n-Accepted.\n\"You're trying to build something weird again\"\nDespite witnessing scientific advances that would mark the history of modern civilization, Ha-ri stuck out her tongue and wished he was building something more human.\n* * * *\nThe list of people the president of the United States might personally greet is narrow.\nOnly the head of state of a major ally, or the Queen of England, would be greeted by the President of the United States in white-tie formality with a waiting military honor guard.\nIf Anthony Hobson, the 49th President of the United States, were to have his tie fixed by himself, and the person waiting for him was not the head of state, but a guildmaster of a private guild, it would have been criticized by the opposition and the entire nation.\nThe title of President of the United States of America, the world's most powerful and richest nation, should carry a weight that not even he himself should take lightly.\nAt the very least, no one wants to see their president kowtow to the head of a private organization.\nBut in the case of this one man, surprisingly little was said.\n[The Lion King is coming from South Korea!]\n[Four non-standard grades! The strongest guild in history, with the world's largest S-class power, will land on the American continent!]\n[Experts focus on the arrival of the Flaming Sword Knights!]\n[Leon Dragonia Lionheart, the fastest-growing agent of Religious Manhattan, how will the American Christian faithful receive him].\nOtherworldly survivors have always been a hot topic in Hunter news, but lately they've cooled off.\nWhile their numbers have grown to the point where they're now commonplace, they're not particularly exceptional compared to the Hunters of Earth.\nEnter Leon Dragonia Lionheart, King of the Lionheart.\nBeatrice Alighieri Spero, Magician Queen of the Kingdom of Spero.\nYakt Spinner, the killing machine of the Millennium City.\nLikewise, Vulcanus, the Holy Knight of War and Flame of Lionheart.\nOne by one, these superpowers are dominating international headlines and shaking up the world of Hunters.\nTheir visit was important enough to attract not only the President of the United States, but also a number of ministers who are key members of the administration's cabinet.\nOf course, this was not without the advice of America's longtime goddess.\n[King Leon is quite old-fashioned by your standards, not that he's unreasonable, he's just convinced he has the power and authority he deserves.]\nSince the opening of the Gate, the United States has been in active contact with the survivors of the other worlds.\nThey've been studying their culture and behavior, which is different from Earth's, and they've been studying Leon very closely.\nWhat he eats, what he thinks, what his hobbies are.\n\"Sir, we will be arriving shortly.\"\n\"Whoa, I'm nervous.\"\nPresident Hobson straightened his tie and remained nervous.\nHis opponent was an absolute monarch of the medieval world, with the authority of actual gods. To deal with such a man, all of his key secretaries and bureaucrats were trained in royal etiquette.\n\"Who will come? Surely those two will come?\"\nIn this case, they were Leon and Beatrice.\nThe administrations of the countries were virtually predisposed to favor Beatrice as Leon's First Lady. The authoritarian Leon's distinction between commoners and nobles was clear, and Beatrice was the only member of the royal family who spoke to him as an equal.\nAdd to that the fact that they were both present at every event, and it's hard not to think of Beatrice as the First Lady.\n\"The trouble is, Sir Vulcanus and Sir Yakt Spinner, with all the power they showed in Taiwan, are nothing compared to the Magician Queen.\"\nThe Battle of Taiwan was an event that shocked the world.\nThere were three Archdemons, all believed to be just below Skazakari, the Archdemon of Shanghai, who was credited with virtually ending China.\nVulcanus slayed two of them, and Yakt Spinner managed to take down one.\nIt was an impressive feat, but Beatrice's newfound power is said to have made her stronger than ever.\nThe crystallization of a great weapon, wielding a mist of death at her touch, she was said to be better than several Archmages of the Tower Lord class.\n\"The cadre is important, but so are the knights beneath them. I'd like at least twenty, if not all, of the Knights of the Burning Sword to come.\"\n\"Even the Knights of the First Order are powerful, especially Han Ha-ri and Chun So-yeon, who are now ranked as top S-class Hunters.\"\nPresident Hobson read the material as well.\nThe Association's new recruits and Academy cadets, who had been Class A and B Hunters only earlier this year, had risen to the ranks of Class S Hunters in less than half a year.\nThe Knights under his command alone were a modest S-class raiding party and it's hard to believe that they were only students not long ago.\nAt least three officers and some members of the Burning Sword Knights.\nI think it's a little hard to hope for a jackpot. Korea wouldn't want to see their greatest power slip away.\nGoddess Meriel said she'd done something about it, but I'd be happy with a modest settlement.\nThe large transport skidded to a halt on the tarmac and stood in front of the red-carpeted ceremony.\nThe doors opened and the first to emerge were two girls, a redhead and a dark-haired Oriental along with the two knight boys from the dossier.\n\"Okay, so if those four are here, that means the entire Order is here.\"\nThe four smiled awkwardly at the national-sized welcoming crowd and descended, followed by a group of former Academy cadets.\nAll of them are Knights of the First Order of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods in the database, and all of them are Holy Law users starting at Class A Hunters.\nTheir combat prowess had made for impressive footage during the destruction of Archduke Akasha's estate.\nThe next to descend the stairs was a spider-mech that leaped from the stairs and landed on Ha-ri's head.\n\"This is Lord Yakt Spinner, and his arrival means that the courtesy recruits can be mobilized at this gate.\"\n\"Okay, okay, I'll take a look at that super-robot.\"\nThe next to dismount were red knights in medieval full plate armor. Some of them had their helmets off, and the Hunter Management Agency official recognized them instantly.\n\"Sir Laihar Dever, Third Sword of the Knights of the Burning Sword!\"\n\"Sir Galatan and Sir Tarhan are there as well, top tier powerhouses with video footage of them attacking Gates alone!\"\nAs the names of the Knights of the Burning Sword appeared one after another, the agents of the Hunter Management Bureau cheered.\nDoes their arrival mean that some of the Burning Sword Knights will be participating in this assault?\n\"I wonder if all of them have come\nA hopeful observation was made, but everyone's eyes widened at the next figure that appeared.\n-Lord Vulcanus!\n-It's Vulcanus the Butcher!\n-That Vulcanus has come to America!\nA Holy Knight and the leader of the Flaming Sword Knights, a powerhouse of super strength that even the greatest demons can't match. Vulcanus, the Holy Knight of War and Flame, has arrived.\n\"They're all here.\"\nPresident Anthony Hobson couldn't stop the corners of his mouth from twitching.\nThe arrival of the First Order had been enough to get his hopes up, but the arrival of Vulcanus was like getting an early Christmas present.\nThe arrival of the trusty Knights of TTG Temple seemed to take the edge off the stress of the Black Gate's arrival in Washington, D.C., the worst scourge of mankind.\nThis should quickly stabilize the volatile NASDAQ index. There's a reason why there's information control whenever a black gate opens, because stock prices and surrounding land values crash.\nHumanity has always feared the horrors of the Black Gate.\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart is here!\"\nSoon, Leon the Lionheart King and Beatrice the Magician Queen descended the stairs together.\nPerhaps they were the most famous people in the world.\nShining golden hair, blue wallsand at the transcendent age of 300, still as handsome as a young man in his prime, he has an almost absolute following on the Internet.\nAnd the veiled woman who follows him always keeps her face covered, so her exact features are not known, but when he occasionally reveals a part of her face, it is an eyewitness testimony that she is a beauty who attracts a lot of seconds'.\nIt was safe to say that their popularity was world-class, as they were both good men and good women with world-class martial power.\n\"Welcome to the United States of America. We welcome the visit of your Majesties and their knights.\"\nPresident Hobson held out his hand as a gesture of goodwill and Leon smiled as he gladly shook the President's hand.\n\"It is a pleasure to meet you, President Anthony Hobson. I am Leon Dragonia Lionheart, the 15th Lionheart King of the Lionheart Kingdom.\"\nLeon didn't consider the people's elected head of state to be royalty on par with himself, but he treated him as such.\nHe grasped President Hobson's hand tightly and refused to let go.\n\"Your Majesty?\"\n\"I need to check on one thing.\"\n\"What is it?\"\nThe evil species.\nThe complexions of President Hobson and his cabinet stiffened.",

      "content": "Chapter 187:\nAre you a demon or a follower of the demons?\nIt's an argument the world's leaders have grown tired of hearing lately.\nYou had an affair, you're a demon, you took bribes, you're a demon, you made a bizarre ruling, you're a demon.\nIt's the second coming of the 21st century version of the Communist Party.\nOf course, like the Cold War communists of the 20th century, there were times when they really got caught.\nThere is an urban legend that if people report suspected demons on the TTG Temple Demon Reporting Site, someone will thoroughly investigate and dispose of them.\nOf course, for the heads of state running the intelligence agencies, this was not just an urban legend.\nIt's no secret that there have been gas explosions, particle weapon bombardments from outer space, and assassinations that have slipped through the cracks.\nAnd every single one of those who have died in such a manner has been suspected of being a demon or a follower of the demons.\n[Mr. Speaker, the former Director of the CIA waswas a demon follower, that's for sure.]\nThe director of the CIA during the Anthony administration was also found dead at some point, and the evidence that he was a demon follower was also unmistakable.\nThe U.S. government brushed it off, but they were very wary of the assassination capabilities of the TTG Temple.\nEspecially since these ignorant demon-haters in front of them were the kind of people who would burn UN employees at the stake if they were suspected of being demons.\nSo when Leon asked, \"Are you a demon?\" President Hobson could only imagine a grisly future.\n\"Uh, no.\"\nAfter a moment of tongue-twisting embarrassment, Leon patted him on the shoulder and laughed.\n\"It's a harsh world. I never thought I'd see the day when those bastards would be wearing human skin and playing king.\"\n\"Uh, well\"\nFrom the CIA reports, the end of Taiwanese President Chiang Kai-shek was a familiar one.\nHe was tied up and burned at the stake by his own citizens.\nIt would have been an international embarrassment if the medieval Lion King had hung him at the stake to see if he was a demon.\nWe need to avoid that!\nPresident Hobson said in desperation while maintaining an awkward smile.\n\"I-I believe in God.\"\n\"Ah, a Christian, a good man who gave his only Son.\"\nAt that, President Hobson looked surprised. He had expected a fanatic who prioritized only the tenets of the pantheon, but this man was more tolerant of other religions than he realized.\nOf course, if he was a zealot who only believed in his own god, he wouldn't have taken advice from Meriel, the Goddess of Fate.\n\"Haha, I'm not a lowly demon or a follower of the demons.\"\nPresident Hobson tried to pass this off as a simple joke, but Leon was not having it.\n\"I'm going to pray to the God of War in honor of my meeting with the President of the United States, and I hope you'll be pleased to accept my blessing.\"\n\"What? No\"\nLeon recited a prayer that ignited a great flame\nIt was no secret that the sacred flame of the war god Petos was a flame of annihilation, capable of consuming even the soul.\n\"Mr. President!\"\nThe SPs panicked and drew their pistols, but the flames had already engulfed them.\n-Aaaahhhh!\n-Sudden flames!\nThe frightened crowd and cameramen backed away, but the president was not captured on film as he went up in flames.\nPresident Anthony Hobson was not a demon or part of the demon followers, so he was unaffected by Petos' flames.\n\"Uh, uh\"\nPresident Hobson was stunned to realize that he had just been set on fire while Leon chuckled and tapped me on the shoulder.\n\"How can you be so flustered, I was merely wishing you Godspeed.\"\n\"Ha, ha, ha.\"\nA chill ran down President Hobson's spine as he realized that if he had been a follower of the demons, Leon would have burned him to death on the spot.\nHe was thankful he was a devout Christian.\n\"Rude! How dare you draw a weapon in the king's presence!\"\nLord Laihar bellowed at the SPs who drew their guns but Leon chided him.\n\"They are brave men who risk their lives to defend their king. Don't be too hard on them.\"\n\"Yes, Your Majesty!\"\nRisking their lives, which meant that Leon and the knights of the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods were in a position to kill them at any moment.\nThat's a lot of confidence.\nA man who claimed to be favored by the gods and to be their representative was confident enough to go to war against the great nation of the United States.\nIf he were a follower of the demons and burned to death on this spot, what would have happened to the United States of America?\n-Crack!\nA horrific scream came from somewhere, and it came from the gathering of reporters.\n\"What!?\"\n\"Demons!\"\nThe sparks that Leon had ignited in his congratulations to President Hobson had spread everywhere, burning some of them, and their true forms had been revealed: they were demons.\n\"Well. Demons are everywhere, and they hide themselves so despicably.\"\n\"\"\nAs President Hobson stared at the dying demon or its followers, screaming the death knell of their souls, he thought to himself that he would never associate himself with a demon.\nAmerican mastermind Reynald Sherman, who was watching the encounter on TV, and the wisdom gem.\n-Im glad we didn't go\n\"What a wise man\nMaster Reynald Sherman and the Archdemon of Wisdom, Gob, breathed a sigh of relief and survived another day!\n* * * * *\n[His Majesty, King Leon Dragonia Lionheart, makes a surprise visit to the United States]\n[Largest security force ever mobilized. The Hobson Administration extends a hearty welcome to the Lionheart]\n[Demon followers discovered at reception. Is America safe from demons?]\n[TTG Temple and their allies in Korea visit the U.S. with the largest military force ever. No borders in the face of the Gate Crisis!]\n[President Hobson's diplomatic achievements that emphasized the strengthening and cohesion of the U.S.-ROK alliance]\nThe articles leading up to Leon's visit were like a bombshell on the internet and TV news when he arrived.\nWhile some criticized Leon's visit, saying it would undermine democracy and accelerate the expansion of cults, most welcomed him to the U.S. to attack the Black Gate.\n-Waaaaaah! His Majesty the Lionhearted King!\n-Look at this!\nLeon was greeted with enthusiasm everywhere he went, but the reception in the United States was extraordinary.\nTraffic was shut down for a parade through the city center on the road to the White House from Washington Dulles International Airport.\nLeon and President Hobson rode together in the same vehicle, waving to the crowds as they made their way to the White House, stopping at famous restaurants and attractions in the heart of the nation's capital to take photos together.\n\"Whoa, aren't you tired, you've been visiting so much, but I think you've been doing too much politics.\"\nAlthough they had made arrangements in advance, President Hobson was worried that Leon would be too intrusive.\nThere have been incidents of unruly behavior in the past, such as American TTG worshippers and children breaking through security lines.\nThe security force was the largest ever, but the enthusiastic response from American TTG worshippers was more than he could have imagined.\n\"It's okay. They don't get to see royalty very often, so it's natural for them to look up to them and want to be close to them.\"\nPresident Hobson had met Queen Victoria, presidents and royalty from around the world, but never with such royal dignity.\nThe absolute monarch of an otherworldly monarchy and a party to a royal theocracy that proclaims itself to be king by divine authority.\nEven the kings of the Middle East's theocracies are pseudo-royalty compared to Leon.\nWhat's really scary is that this royalty truly represents the gods and is authorized by them.\nCertainly he is the antithesis of democracy.\nThe U.S. government believed that Korea would be swallowed up by TTG Temple before long.\nTheir democracy is healthy, but the existence of the TTG Temple is a cheat in itself.\nA demigod, protected by the gods, blessed by the gods.\nNot only that, but as it turns out, you can't even be a bureaucrat, let alone a king, unless you're pure and clean.\nA member of the Korean National Assembly was struck by lightning after professing to be a believer of TTG for his political performance.\nFor now, we can't antagonize TTG Temple because of the existence of demons, but when all is said and done, .\nWill mankind be able to antagonize the TTG Temple and Lionheart?\nAs the President of the United States of America, the guardian of democracy, President Hobson could not help but be in anguish, for there was already an Otherworldly Goddess in the United States.\n\"President Hobson, where is the goddess Meriel?\"\n\"She is waiting for you at the White House.\"\nNot long ago, the U.S. government dispatched the Goddess Meriel herself to make a bold proposal to the TTG Temple.\nAnd today, when the rise of the Black Gate prompted a call to the TTG Temple for assistance, it was an unofficial letter from Goddess Meriel that brought Leon to the table.\nWhat is it?\nPresident Hobson wondered, but for Leon to arrive in America and seek out Goddess Meriel like this, he could only assume that she had helped him.\nPresident Hobson led him to a parlor in the White House. There, Leon saw the platinum-haired goddess waiting for him.\n\"Greetings, Goddess of Destiny.\"\nLeon approached her and bent down on one knee. The Goddess Meriel was pleased to receive him and held out her hand.\n\"I hope you have been well, King Leon. It is good to see you again so soon.\"\nLeon kissed the back of the goddess's hand and looked up.\n\"I am as well as ever, and I am glad to see that the Goddess is as well.\"\n\"I'm just grateful that you treat a god you don't believe in so well. May the gods of the TTG Temple be blessed by fate.\"\nThe gods of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods also bowed to the gods of the other worlds. They felt a sense of identification and sympathy for the goddess of fate, who, like them, had lost her world and become a wanderer.\nFor while they had a great representative in Leon, the goddess Meriel had none, and was forced to sell her powers to mortals.\n[But before that, I must clarify what you said in your letter: is it true what you wrote about the only daughter of my knight?]\nGoddess Arianna has known of her knight's anguish for a very long time.\nAn event that left Leon with a debt of gratitude to the gods, an event that the gods could not fulfill after all his years of service to them.\nGrand Duchess Karina Dragonia.\nHer fate was mentioned by Meriel in her letter.\n\"Yes, I have read of King Leon's fate, and I could not intervene, but I could intervene in the fate of the one he would most desire.\"\n[That would be Karina]\nThe Goddess of Fate is a fallen being. She escaped from her world and came to Earth after losing her believers.\nHer rank is by no means low, but she is unable to intervene in the fate of beings with godhood.\n\"Karina Dragonia. She is in crisis.\"\n\"!\"\nLeon's eyes widened. He had suspected that Karina might not be alive, but the goddess's testimony convinced him that she was, and he was worried that she was in trouble.\n\"Karina is! Where is the child?\"\n[Calm down, my knight]\nOn a rare occasion when Leon became agitated, Arianna calmed him.\n\"Tell me something about her first, then I'll tell you what I saw.\"\nMeriel demanded information before she could tell him what she had seen and Ventasis, god of darkness and vengeance, answered.\n[Karina Dragonia, my contracted Holy Knight of Vengeance, battled the Demon Archduke of Lust to fulfill her vengeance]\nLeon was on the verge of a showdown with the Lord of Wisdom, Carakael when the Northern Army broke away from the Alliance and marched on the Archduke.\nThirty thousand Northern troops marched toward the place where the Demon Archduke's legions lurked in destruction.\n[But there, Karina Dragonia vanished, and many of the avengers who had contracted with me vanished that day]\n[Just as they did with me and the Holy Knight of Life and Fertility].\nDemera replied to Petos' words, in a bitter voice.\n[Like Georgic and Vulcanus, whose souls, through the machinations of the demons, we dont even know their whereabouts.]\nKarina Dragonia must have been in a similar situation, the gods and Leon were now reasoning.\n\"I see. Stillyou are very fortunate to have been able to take the souls of the faithful.\"\n\"\"\nLeon recognized the sad look in Goddess Meriel's eyes.\nShe, too, was a benevolent goddess who loved children. In her world, there was no one like her, who had protected the temple and paradise in her heart for hundreds of years.\nThe loss of her worshippers, of the children she had nurtured throughout history, must be tearing her heart apart.\nThe Goddess of Destiny took a moment to compose herself before giving Leon the answer he had been waiting for.\n\"Karina Dragonia, she exists beyond the Black Gate that will open this time, and the only one who can save her is\"\nOnly her father, Leon, the goddess said, speaking of the fate she had read.",

      "content": "Chapter 188:\nThere have been three catastrophes since humanity has been threatened by the otherworldly threat of the Gate.\nThe first was the Shanghai Massacre.\nArchdemon Skazakari was defeated by the evaporation of Shanghai, but its constant resurrection and reappearance caused the continent to collapse under the weight of the damage.\nSecond, the Frost Queen of Siberia.\nDevouring the snowfields of Siberia, Russia, the Frost Queen was finally defeated, but her heart remained and became an Epic item that expands the snowfields.\nThird, the London Disaster.\nThe first-ever European Union raid cleared a Black Gate, but the real villain was the Wandering Demon Blade, which dropped as an Epic item.\nIt was a trap set by the murderous Archduke Akasha to find a host, killing 870,000 Londoners and 600 Hunters under the leadership of the first demon swordsman, James Spencer, and causing untold damage as she continued to switch hosts.\nEach of these black gates scarred humanity beyond repair.\nThe lesser of the two evils was the London plague, which killed nearly a million people, so it goes without saying that it was a terrifying disaster.\nSo when a black gate appeared in the middle of the United Statesin its capital, Washington, D.C., no lessthe United States acted quite rationally.\n[The United States enlists the support of longtime allies]\nThe United States called on its longtime allies, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Five Eyes, as well as South Korea, Japan, Germany, and France, to send elite hunter assault teams.\n-Look at that. It's Cornwall Ong, the Archmage of England, the Lord of the Tower of London!\n-There's the League of Gentlemen. Graham the Silver Knight!\n-And Gnther of Germany! The defending European champion!\n-From Japan, Mr. Takeda himself. I thought he'd send his men now that he's so high up.\nAt the request of the United States, Hunters from all over the world came to represent their respective countries.\nThis alone exceeded the number of S-class Hunters mobilized at London Gate and the most important American hunter force is\n-The Maverick Guild! Minuteman and Allen Taylor are there!\n-The entire executive team!\nThe McHale Guild from Los Angeles is also here! The American S-class Hunters are here!\nThere are 60 S-class Hunters. That's crazy.\nIndeed, the United States was the world's strongest nation.\nThe total number of S-class Hunters in the United States is eighty. This alone was four times the level of South Korea, which was considered a Hunter powerhouse.\nThe Maverick Guild and the McHale Guild, the two guilds with the most S-class Hunters, were the two largest guilds that bisected the United States.\nThe largest American guilds in the East and West had been mobilized to attack Washington's Black Gate.\n\"They haven't come yet.\"\n\"The real monster power of this attack.\"\nBut even they weren't the main players in this raid, as they were led in by a colorful American honor guard and made a formal entrance.\n\"His Majesty Leon Dragonia Lionheart, King of the Lionheart, and his entourage, please enter!\"\nIt was an alien group in this modern age.\nIt's not uncommon for hunters to use cold weapons and wear pre-modern armor.\nHowever, modernized versions of pre-modern armor designs and swords and shields with increased magical conductivity have a different vibe than the weapons of the past.\nIt's a contradictory balance, with cold weapons on the cutting edge.\n-Diverse!\nBut is there any other group that is so anachronistic?\nFull plate armor. Standardized, heavy jousting lances. War horses with full body armor.\nHeavily armored assault knights with a strict cold-weapon system reminiscent of the medieval French Knights Templar.\nThe uniqueness of the cavalry in the age of tanks and fighter jets is what draws people's attention.\n-Truly medieval.\n-They do mounted charges at gates.\n-Don't they have jousting tournaments?\nSome people on the left laughed at the joke, but as they got closer, everyone held their breath.\nThey realized that these were not just anachronistic knights emerging from a medieval mural, but warriors who had been on the battlefield since they were born.\n\"Your Majesty!\"\nThis time, the attack on the Black Gate was to be presided over by the President of the United States, President Hobson himself.\nPresident Hobson greeted Leon's with great fanfare, and Leon and his knights dismounted.\n-I see the Men at Arms aren't here.\n-Well, if they do, we'll have more Hunters than the United States. The chain of command will be a mess.\nNo matter how much they'd like the Alliance to help them, the centerpiece of this assault on the Gate must be the United States itself.\n-But the Burning Sword Knights and Lord Vulcanus alone.\n-Hugely overbalanced. The Knights of Naju are not low level either.\n-There are four of them, including the Lionheart King. Especially the Yakt Spinner. You never know what's going to pop up. Are those containers his personal arsenal?\nIn any case, the number of Hunters assembled in Washington was close to a hundred and fifty, all Class S and above.\nBut they didn't enter the Washington Gate right away, because there were others waiting for them.\n\"President Hobson, how long have your scouts been in?\"\n\"Four days as of today.\"\nEach of the black gates had a horrific difficulty level. Most large guilds would try to outbid each other for even the highest difficulty, Red Gate, but a Black Gate was different.\nTo capture the Black Gate, which is almost an all-out war, Hunters would first dispatch a scouting party to see the situation of the Gate before deciding whether to attack.\n\"It's about time, but\"\nIn fact, they were instructed to return last night if they could. However, if not a single one of them has come out yet\n\"They can't be wiped out, can they? It was a scouting party that included Trident, an S-class Hunter.\nIt was best to have the scouts relay as much information as possible about what was going on inside the gate, but even if the scouts were wiped out in the worst case scenario, the gate still needed to be entered.\nEven with all of Washington, D.C.'s citizens evacuated, the city is the nation's capital and the center of the United States. Losing it would be an irreparable wound.\n\"We'll just have to wait and see. Our American hunters are good. They'll be back soon with good news.\"\nPresident Hobson spoke solemnly, but as the hours passed, his and his aides' faces grew grim.\nAn hour, two hoursfour hourswhen they were supposed to be receiving information from Gate and organizing operations, the International Hunter Alliance could only wait.\nThe passage of time could only mean one thing: the annihilation of the scouts.\nEven in the United States, the disastrous assumption that the elite Hunter scouting force had been wiped out in its entirety had become a foregone conclusion.\n\"Your Majesty.\"\nAn elderly English gentleman approached the group of Hunter Bureau agents, who turned blue as they realized what this meant.\n\"Cornwall Ong, may I help you?\"\nCornwall Ong, a British duke and archmage not even President Hobson would dare to mess with. As the owner of the Epic Item Twelve Patches, he spoke on behalf of the International Hunter Alliance.\n\"I think we should move in soon.\"\n\"But our scouts haven't returned yet.\"\n\"Although the black gate has a longer dungeon break grace period than the other gates, it's a tougher gate to tackle. We need to enter it as soon as possible to gather information from the inside and begin our assault.\"\nOriginally, even running a scouting party was a waste of time. It's just that no one would dare to enter a black gate with an extremely high mortality rate.\n\"So what do the Maverick Guild and the McHale Guild think?\"\n\"I think we should enter. It is our regret that the Trident did not come out.\"\nThe Maverick Guild was devastated that their S-class Hunter was most likely dead, but they concluded coldly.\n\"We are of the same opinion as the Maverick Guild. If we lose more time here, it might actually make it more urgent to capture the gate.\"\n\"I see\"\nPresident Hobson felt terrible that he had to send an international coalition of Hunters to deal with the crisis in the United States without giving them a single piece of information.\nHis gaze turned to Leon now.\n\"Is that how you feel, Your Majesty?\"\n\"This king is not the commander of this coalition. The commander in chief is President Hobson himself.\"\nLeon emphasized that the responsibility of decision rested with President Hobson himself. He's not here as a king, he's here as an ally.\nIn response to Leon's words, President Hopson made his decision.\n\"Though its not the best situation, our International Hunter Alliance is stronger than any other army in the world. I have every confidence that you will rise to the occasion.\"\nPresident Hobson had made his decision and ordered the troops to march on Washington Gate.\n\"As President of the United States of America, I order the International Hunter Union to defend Washington and its citizens. God bless them.\"\n* * * *\nAlthough the news of the scouting party's failure was heartbreaking, they were confident that the assault would not fail.\nOne hundred and fifty Class S Hunters had gathered to attack Washington Gate along with two thousand Class A Hunters.\nIn the history of world gate assaults, this kind of power has never been mobilized before.\nHis Majesty, Lord Vulcanus, Queen Beatrice, and Lord Yappy are also here!\nAmong these one hundred and fifty S-class Hunters, Han Ha-ri had even more faith.\nNo matter how powerful the Demon Archduke or the monsters inside the gate were, she couldn't imagine them being able to surpass Leon.\n\"What, what? The gate has been moved to\"\n\"This is not\"\nThe unexpected turn of events was clearly beyond her imagination.\nIt was white space that gave an odd sense of floating, like being in outer space but the buoyancy of an unknown force was pushing the raiders somewhere.\nThey were progressing in an irresistible direction but they were moving frustratingly slow.\n\"What the hell, what the hell is going on?\"\n\"Don't be impatient, we don't know everything!\"\nWhile being pushed by an unknown force, the Hunters tried to interpret the anomaly in their own way, or let their anxiety spiral out of control.\n\"Calm down, everyone, it's clear we've entered the gate!\"\nEventually, an elderly gentleman calmed them down. Active since the early days of the Cataclysm, he was the most prestigious hunter in the world, the Tower of London Master, and he spoke with authority.\n\"Does the Archmage have any ideas about this phenomenon?\"\nIt was Allen Taylor of the Maverick Guild, who was testing the space-faring movements of his men.\n\"Hmmnot entirely, but if this old man's guess is anything to go by, the Magician Queen of the TTG Temple is more familiar with this phenomenon.\"\nAt that, all eyes turned toward the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods and Beatrice met their gazes as she rode her black horse through the sky.\n\"I take it you feel the same way I do?\"\n\"Yes, my queen. I have read your treatise to the magical community.\"\n\"Papers by the Queen of Magic?\"\n\"I've heard there are several.\"\nAfter Leon, the Magician Queen is the most publicized member of the TTG Temple.\nHer many magical theories are said to be revolutionary in magical circles.\nMankind, with only 30 years of magical history, is said to be like a newborn baby in front of her.\n\"This is probably inside the gate, more precisely, the subspace between the gate's entrance and exit.\"\n\"Between the entrance and exit of the gate?\"\n\"I'm sure many wizards have already experimented with opening gates like in my papers, but to put it simply, a gate is meant to be entered and exited at the same time.\"\nThis has been commonplace for a long time but academics disagree.\n\"Entering a gate is like entering another world, a leap in space and time but it physically requires a passage'.\"\nWe are now swimming in that passage. So far, the Hunters understand. The question was\n\"Why are we here now? By now, we should have moved on to the next entrance in a flash.\"\n\"There are two possibilities. The first is that the Hunters' magic power has somehow affected the gate with this unprecedentedly large-scale movement, or\"\n\"Or there are beings who can intervene in this subspace, this passage between worlds.\"\n-Anomalous energy activity. Inactive observation radar at full power.\n-Warning.\n-Possible enemy presence.\nSpace shudders. In subspace, a giant passageway twisted and turned, and a figure emerged from it.\nThe figure was so large, so clear, that everyone recognized it as one thing.\nAn evil one. A giant. The hero's nemesis.\nThe greatest incarnation of violence in all of mythology was\n\"What is that?\"\nA dragon.\nThe torn pupils of a dragon so huge that it stared at the Alliance from the other side of the subspace.",

In this subspace, the dragon's voice was almost too loud to hear, and it let out a dismal howl.\n[I know what your breath comes from, what blood your flesh is made of.]\nThe dragon's gaze met his and its fiery ruby eyes locked with Leons within the blue walls.\nThey know each other's existence.\n[Dragon slayer. Descendant of the tin can that stole my name]\n\"The Elder Dragon, Dragonia.\"\nDragonia it's a name that everyone who knows Leon would not fail to recognize.\nTheyve heard it time and time again in the course of Leon's claim to fame, that before he was the Lionheart King, he was the rightful heir to a Grand Duchy.\nGrand Duke of Dragonia was Leon's family name, and also the pseudonym under which the first Archduke of Dragonia had slain a great dragon and claimed it as his own.\n[Hahahahaha! I see, I've been waiting a long time to get my revenge on you!]\nAt that moment a huge flame erupted in subspace, and something leaped up, it was Vulcanus.\n\"GRARARARARA!! You talk too much, salamander!!!\"\nThe red-armored knight leaped forward as the flames of Petos propel him.\nThe Hunters, who hadn't thought of charging the giant dragon, were stunned.\n-Quang!\nVulcanus struck the dragon with two flaming holy swords. But the dragon didn't budge.\n\"No!?\"\nVulcanus was surprised that the dragon was unmoved by his power while Dragonia smiled.\n[You have no right to interfere in this realm, neither do you bugs, nor those demons.]\nThe next moment, Dragonia's wings spread.

I am the arch-enemy of your gods. I am the oldest being. I am the myth!]\nThe unfurled wings folded again as a simple flap of the wings shook subspace and swept away thousands of Hunters.\nIt was the same for the Lionheart King and his knights.\n* * * * *\n[Leon! Leon, my knight!]\nLeon opened his eyes at the sound of the goddess' voice. He stood up, hearing the voice of the goddess and the other gods concerned for him.\n\"This is.\"\nHe was in the middle of a city, it was a familiar marketplace floor that brought back memories. Stalls are lined up, hawkers and citizens come and go.\nTheir eyes were focused on Leon, and for good reason.\nA stranger who drops out of the sky attracts attention even when he doesn't want to.\n-What is this guy? Didn't he just fall out of the sky?\n-A man falls from the sky. I thought it was the Emperor, and got scared.\nLeon realized that his gaze was beneath the commoners, and he stood up straight and stared down at them.\nThey were both intimidated by his inexplicable swagger and curious about this mysterious man who had fallen from the sky.\nLeon ignored their stares and searched his surroundings, approaching the shopkeeper who was silently watching him from a corner stall.\n\"You there. The florist's mistress.\"\n\"Me, me?\"\nThe florist's proprietress, designated by a finger, greeted Leon with a flushed face.\n\"Why don't you start by telling me where this place is? While you're at it, make me some tea.\"\n\"Uh, this is a flower shop?\"\n\"Then you can go buy some.\"\nLeon is shamelessly insolent, even though he hasn't entrusted her with any money but a king never bows to a commoner, not even in this other world where he knows nothing.\n\"All right, goodbye!\"\nThe mistress blushed and stormed out.\nPart of her had guessed that Leon's status was a noble one, but there was more to it than that.\nAfter the florist left, Leon was lost in thought.\n\"The Elder Dragon Dragonia I never thought it would come and reveal itself now.\"\n[It is but a shadow of itself, having lost its body, only its mighty soul remains.]\n\"If a presence of that magnitude can only be in the form of a soulit must have been truly remarkable when it was alive.\"\nLeon had only heard of its existence as a vague legend.\nDuring the founding of the Lionheart Kingdom there were three men who were revered as absolutes in the Lionheart Kingdom.\n\"I've heard it was defeated by Archduke Erindal Dragonia, along with King Richard the Lionhearted and Duke Renaud, the first High Priest of War and Flame.\"\nOne of them, Erindal Dragonia, called the Dragon Slayer, was bathed in the blood of the elder dragon Dragonia and absorbed its heart.\nAll subsequent Archdukes of Dragonia have inherited the dragon's heart, and that includes Leon, that's why he knew.\n\"I can't even compare to the dragons I've slain.\"\n[Yes, Leon, the dragons of your time are lizards compared to those of Dragonia]\nArianna, followed by Petos, recalled those days and said.\n[Even the fire-breathing dragon was a mere subordinate of Dragonia in his time, and he was so huge that he could stretch out his arm and grasp a volcano]\nNow this legendary being has come, and for whatever reason, something has gone wrong with the dragon's heart.\n\"Gods, do you know where the others fell?\"\n[We are essentially bodies bound to the pantheon in your heart. In this world, we can only be by your side, except on Earth, where the temple has been rebuilt]\n[Wait, light, I can't see ocean.]\n[Hmm?]\nThe gods discussed something among themselves and Arianna spoke for them.\n[He must have taken on an incarnation and attached himself to Ha-ri in that brief moment]\n\"I'm having trouble connecting with God Poma. It's a similar situation to when we entered the East Sea Gate before.\"\nThe gods could not directly descend into the material world, but they could intervene through the shell of an incarnation.\nIn the past, when the gods were more powerful, they would personally appear to give quests to their favorite knights.\nHowever, as long as they were intervening in the human world through their incarnations, their consciousness would be directed there, and they would be absent from the Temple of All Gods.\n[I don't see another one]\n\"Another one?\"\n[Revenge. I can't see his darkness]\nVentasis, God of Darkness and Vengeance. Leon breathed a sigh of relief, knowing who he had chosen as his Holy Knight.\nDragonia and Ventasis were both connected to the same person.\n\"Karinais that child really here?\n[Your goddess is looking forward to meeting my knight's child]\nKarina Dragonia.\nHis own daughter, a Holy Knight of Darkness and Vengeance, from the lineage of the Grand Duke of Dragonia.\nIt was now indisputable that the child was alive within this gate.\nLeon heard a startling revelation from the proprietress of the florist he sought out for information.\n\"Karina?\"\n\"Hee hee, don't you dare call on the dignity of Her Majesty the Emperor!\"\nThe mistress freaked out as if she's afraid someone will hear her and Leon's eyes widened in surprise at the insolent honorific.\n\"Her Imperial Majesty?\"\n* * * *\n\"Ugh!\"\nHa-ri forced her tired eyelids open. It was almost an instinctive action, but a blade appeared in front of her eyes.\n\"Hic!\"\nHa-ri reflexively drew her sword, parrying the blade and backing away. She realized she was surrounded by soldiers.\n\"The intruder resists!\"\n\"I don't care if you kill her! Subdue her!\"\n\"What?!\"\nSpears soared from all sides and while dodging them, Ha-ri shouted.\n\"Oh, you're mistaken, I'm not an intruder!\"\n\"You! Where are you dodging!\"\n\"If I don't dodge, I'll die!\"\nHa-ri cried out in frustration, but the man, who appeared to be a soldier, was unrelenting.\n\"This bastard who broke into the imperial palace has no fear, and she's taunting me with her tongue!\"\nThe imperial palace? This is the imperial palace?\nAfter entering the gate so many times, you're bound to get used to unfamiliar surroundings.\nHa-ri realized that this was the palace of some nation inside the gate and that he was an unwelcome intruder.\nWhere did everyone else go? Why did I end up in this place?\nShe was an unwitting intruder, but that didn't mean she couldn't be caught. Ha-ri used the physical prowess of an S-class Hunter to outrun the soldiers and escape their pursuit.\n\"Intruder! You shall receive my aura!\"\nThe soldier threw his spear with a bloodshot gaze.\n\"Awww, aren't you throwing it too fast for an aura!\"\n\"Shut up, renegade!\"\n\"Renegade, me? I thought you called me an intruder!\"\n\"What's a grown woman walking around with her belly button out if not a traitor!\"\n\"You've got to be kidding me!\"\nWhatever the case may be, she's an S-class hunter. She's not exactly an easy opponent for ordinary soldiers to chase down.\n\"Ugh, where are the others\"\nShe decided to look for the king first, since she's the one who would be the most recognizable.\nAs she was running away from the soldiers, something landed on Ha-ri's shoulder.\n[Ha-ri]\nPoma?!\"\nA distinctive tortoise form called out to Ha-ri.\n\"Poma, why are you here?!\"\n[Ha-ri, I sensed that the coordinates of your fall were different.

No, when she thought about it, it was obvious.\nFrom anyone else's point of view, she was an intruder who had fallen into the palace.

This is a grave offense that would be enough for me to decapitate you, if not here, then within the palace. Did you learn such manners during your time with the Lionhearted King?\"\n\"Im sorry ehahaha.\"\nHa-ri prostrated herself. Her experience with Leon has taught her that the powerful people of Lionheart are no joke.\nThe manners they followed were not an extension of social life like on Earth, but an order that came from real class differences.\n\"Your Majesty?\"\n\"Speak, sea maiden. Hmm strange. I sense another divinity in you.\"\nKarina stepped into the cell, puzzled. The heavy bars were meaningless in the face of the malevolent power of the Emperor of Dragonia.\n\"Your Majesty?\"\n\"Be still.\"\nKarina looked her over, staring at the crown of her head, then down to her face, feeling for any sign of trouble.\n\"Your majesty, there, there!\"\n\"You're a young wench, I see, but why are you sticking out your navel, haven't you learned that sticking out your navel on a cold floor will catch you in the horns?\"\n\"Pfft, it's fashion!\"\nHow long had she been pecking at her like that? Karina said in amazement.\n\"It must be the power of the god Petos. To think that the god of the sea should think of embracing a flame so antithetical to his own.\"\n[Technically, I beat him to the punch]\n\"Hmph. He can barely handle Lord Vulcanus, and hes greedy.\"\n[He is]\nKarina stepped out of the cell door and turned to Ha-ri.\n\"Come out. I'll let this one slide for trespassing in the Imperial Palace.\"\n\"Ugh, I didn't mean to.\"\nHa-ri trotted after her, using the same clumsy historical diction she'd used with Leon. And as she passed, the palace's soldiers and maids bowed low.\nA little different.\nI've seen so many people bow down to the monarch. Even in those tiny tents in the Lionheart Kingdom, soldiers and people bowed to Leon as best they could but there was trust and respect in it. They are genuine feelings but.\nFear. Not as much as I saw in the serfs, but.'\nI can sense an emotion in them that is closer to submission than loyalty.\nIt was strange.\nThe Karina that Ha-ri had met, the Archduke of Dragonia who had traveled north with 30,000 soldiers in search of revenge, undoubtedly had soldiers who risked their lives to follow her.\nThere was no air of coercion or subservience from them, just following the Archduke as they should.\n\"Chamberlain.\"\n\"Yes, Your Majesty!\"\nThe old chamberlain bowed deeply as he stood before Karina.\n\"Prepare a room for our guests.\"\nThe chamberlain didn't glare at Ha-ri or ask who he was supposed to prepare for, just obeyed.\n\"Your Majesty.\"\n\"What?\"\nHa-ri felt there was something she had to say before the chamberlain went to the room to prepare. Why hadn't Karina asked her about that man?\n\"About His Majestyabout His Majesty Leon\"\nKarina held up a hand to stop Ha-ri, her expression blank, but the air she breathed was fierce.\n\"He'll be here soon enough. There's no need for you to blabber on.\"\n\"Still, His Majesty Leon wants you to\"\n\"\"!!\"\"\nGazes around the room turn to Ha-ri and she could feel how stunned they were, even though they ducked straight down, as if they didn't dare commit the rudeness of looking at the Emperor.\nHa-ri lowered his head under the unspoken pressure, but in the meantime, she noticed something.\nKarina's eyes, once as blue as Leon's, had turned an ominous shade of gray.\n\"He'll take care of himself. It's none of your business.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\"\nKarina put a hand on Ha-ri's shoulder as she averted her gaze and chuckled.\n\"It's a shame you're in a woman's body, by the way. You could have been a pretty good candidate.\"\n\"What? What's that?\"\n\"We'll see about that for now. The things from beyond the gate' that have invaded my empire, unless they're demons, I have the patience to watch.\"\n\"????!\"\nHa-ri gasped and the chamberlain hurriedly led her away, as if to prevent her from making any more rash moves.\n\"Come with me, honored guest.\"\n\"Ah, yes, please\"\nHa-ri was led by the chamberlain to the inner palace. When they arrived, the rooms were so overwhelmingly opulent that they seemed to overwhelm rather than serve their guests.\n\"Well then, if you need anything, just call me.\"\n\"Yes\"\nIn any case, it's a much-needed break after only half a day here. Ha-ri flopped down on the bed, hugging the turtle, an incarnation of the God Poma.\n\"Haha this is the second time I've met her, but there's just something about her aura that overwhelms me.\"\n[]\n\"Poma?\"\nHa-ri lifted the unresponsive Poma but its pouting turtle face was lost in thought.\n[This is it my lighthouse is in for a rough ride in more ways than one]\n\"What do you mean?\"\n[It's vague, but it's domestic, you'll see.]\nHa-ri pouted at the vagueness of Poma words. Gods can't you just be a little more straightforward?\n[By the way, Ha-ri, let's check on that quest thing]\n\"Oh, right, we're inside a gate. It's such a normal world, I forgot to check.\"\nShe saw a lot of gates, but this one was a little different.\nWhereas the other gates were fragments of a lost world, this was something elsean otherworld.\n\"It's not just a re-creation of the past, like it was for Lord Georgic, is it? Anyway, the quest is\"\nIt was a privilege granted to Hunters awakened on Earth but Ha-ri's golden eyes widened as she checked the floating system message.\n\"Huh? Huh?!\"\nWhat the hell is this?!\n* * * * *\nThis world has been invaded by demons.\nOver 300 years ago, countless nations fell under a demonic invasion, and the world seemed to crumble at the hands of the Demon Archduke Meltimorphol of Lust but at some point, the demonic invasion lost momentum.\nTheir infinite lives remained, but their numbers dwindled the most notorious, the Demon Archduke Meltimorphol of Lust, and most of his Archdemons, were never seen again.\nHistorians have puzzled over this hiatus, as the world was so close to destruction.\nThen, a hundred years later, when the demons' erosion had slowed, they returned.\nMeltimorphol, Archduke of Lust, the world's nightmare had returned.\n\"The kingdoms had not yet recovered their strength from the demonic invasion. Not only that, but now that the demons had retreated, they saw an opportunity to prey on their weakened neighbors.\"\n\"Foolish.\"\n\"Yes, it was foolish.\"\nThe old historian chuckled to himself as he reflected on a past that was older than his own lifetime. He continued to explain the history of the empire to the young man who had come to him.\n\"But demons were not the only things that appeared in the world that day.\"\nKarina Dragonia.\nShe came to this world with an army of tens of thousands.\n\"They were strong, so strong that even the demons feared them.\"\nAs the world despaired of the reemergence of demons, this otherworldly legion began slaughtering them.\nTaking the place of the legions that had been destroyed by the rise of demons, they defended the cities, marched nonstop through the winter months, and hunted down demons like avenging demonsa legion of vengeful demons.\n\"The Legion of Dragons was a myth. I wouldn't believe it if it weren't for all living proof.\"\nAnd because there was living proof, the old historian conceded that it was real history, not false myth or legend.\n\"But men were foolish, and the kingdoms feared the Legion of Dragons.\"\nThey initially treated the Legion and its leader, Karina Dragonia, with kindness. Each sought to secure her legions, to enlist the knights and warriors under her command but they were not swayed by any of the offers, and simply slaughtered the demons in silence.\nIt was too much, too superhuman to accept.\nThe kingdoms interpreted the intent differently.\nThey wondered, once the demons were slain, who would be next?\nSuch suspicions led to a disgusting incident.\nA combined army of the Seven Kingdoms attacked the Dragon Legion, which had just won a long and bloody battle against Archduke Meltimorphol.\nOn that day, most of the Dragon Legion, exhausted from the fight against the demons, were killed\n\"Eight hundred and fifty thousand of the combined forces of the Seven Kingdoms were slaughtered without a trace.\"\nIn a normal war, it was rare for a side to suffer more than twenty percent casualties, no matter how crushing the defeat, especially if it's a pre-modern war fought with cold weapons.\nBut on this day, the majority of the Kingdom's allied armies that attacked the Dragon Legion did not survive.\nThey were slaughtered on the spotas if they could even think of fleeing.\nThe slaughter continued afterward.\nThe leaders of the treacherous kingdoms and their sympathizers all perished at the hands of a hundred surviving Dragon Legion and the Archduke of Dragonia.\n\"And so the seven foolish kingdoms fell, and a new empire was built upon them.\"\nThe Empire of Dragonia, the most powerful empire in history, with the absolute power of Karina Dragonia as its god.\nThus began the two-hundred-year reign of Emperor Dragonia.\n\"So\"\nLeon felt sorry for her, knowing that she had fought the same hard fought battle he had but he was also relieved that the child was still alive and well after her father's long neglect.\nThat was what he was most grateful for, and relieved for.\n\"Karinawhere do we go to see the Emperor of Dragonia?\"\n\"Oh, don't ask me that. You could get yourself killed if you tried to visit the palace.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\"His Majesty the Emperor is No, where in the world are you from that you don't know this?\"\n\"Understand only that I come from far away, commoner. This king's time is not wasted in answering your questions.\"\n\"\"\nThe old historian had a hunch that this man was the real deal, though he knew he wasn't a commoner when the florist's mistress brought him in.\nHe also knew it was dangerous to pry into the affairs of such a high ranking person, so he tamped down his curiosity about Leon.\n\"The Emperor doesn't usually come out of the palace, and the easiest way to see her is well, that's the best way these days.\"\n\"What is that?\"\nHere Leon did not consider the undignified act of barging into the palace.\nThough otherworldly, Karina was technically the Emperor here so he would have to give her imperial honors.\nA casual knock on the door of the Imperial Palace would be met with a challenge from the loyal guards, and if a commoner challenged the king, Leon would have no choice but to punish the insolence by beating him.\nThen he would have struck the emperor's guards, and Karina's face would not stand.\n[My knight tends to be more archaic than I am]\n\"A man with a Lionheart should be an example to others.\n[Aye, aye.]\nAt the goddess's sarcasm, the Lionheart King kept his dignity, but soon the old historian's words failed him.\n\"Why don't you take part in the Emperor's courtship duel?

      "content": "Chapter 191:\n150 years since the founding of the Dragonia Empire. The Empire has a long-standing problem.\nIt is the question of the succession to the Imperial Emperor, Karina Dragonia.\nShe has reigned as the absolute power and transcendent of the Empire for many years, and while she hasn't aged a day in the 180 years since her arrival on this world, the question of succession has always been an issue.\nAlthough she has been rejecting her subjects' requests to succeed her with absolute power, now she's suddenly recruiting suitors.\nThe nobles, who had been bowing down to her, the absolute ruler, were delighted and wanted to put forward their sons and grandsons as candidates for sire.\n\"The seed to be sown to this king must not be ordinary.\"\n\"Your Majesty, your Majesty, what a wretched!\"\n\"Our noble blood is the noblest of all, the blood of the gods\"\n\"There is no difference between you and a serf pretending to be a nobleman. You are not worthy of respect.\"\nIn the face of outrageous verbal abuse and tyrannical authority, the nobles could only bow down.\nAll the power and wealth in the world was no match for the unchanging power of absolute force.\n\"So, Your Majestyhow do you intend to elect a father?\"\nThe old man assumed a posture of submission to the living embodiment, who had lived more than twice as long as he had, and would do as he was told.\n\"The sire shall be chosen by duel. The strongest man in the world, except for this king, shall be this king sire.\"\nThus began the courtship duel to choose the successor father.\nBrave warriors from all over the world competed in this courtship duel, but none could fulfill Karina conditions.\nThree years passed.\n* * * * *\n[Quest: State Marriage]\nRequirements: Successfully marry the Empress of the Dragonia Empire, Karina Dragonia.\nThe dragon's interference caused the gate to crack, sending Hunters falling everywhere, but their privileged system window doesn't care about distance.\nIn other words, the quest was visible to all Hunters.\n\"I've never seen a gate like this before.\"\nSir Graham, an S-class hunter in the British Gentlemen's League, bought food at a fruit stand with a gentlemanly air. His dandy smile made the shopkeeper blush.\n\"Most of all, it's so peaceful. I've been in and out of the gates for thirty years, and I've never been inside a gate so secure.\"\n\"You mean the Duke of Cornwall, too? Ah, try some of this apple-like fruit, I'm sure I could get a pretty good price for importing it.\"\nThis is a type of gate that even Cornwall Ong, England's greatest archmage, has never seen beforethough if it had been seen before, it would have made global news.\n\"Usually the worlds beyond the gate are recreations of past battles or historical events, so gates with survivors' are easy to recognize.\"\n\"A world that is in the present, even if it has already been destroyed.\"\nBeyond the gate, there were countless worlds.\nMedieval fantasy worlds, martial arts worlds, punk futuristic worlds, or worlds completely beyond conventional wisdom.\nThere were otherworldlers, there were orcs, there were midgets, and there were species that weren't human at all, like the gnomes.\nBasically, each with its own history, they all had one thing in common.\n\"Annihilation. It was always a given.\"\nThat's why Earth's scholars assumed that the world beyond the Gate was a world destroyed by demons, and that the records of that world, named the Akashic Records, were manifested in the phenomenon known as the Gate.\n\"The same was true of the world of the survivors, where the latest hot survivors were Lord Spinner or the Lionheart Kingor the orcs.\"\n\"Well, at least there were survivors, but a lot of the world was devastated. Orcsthey'll survive anywhere, if you let them.\"\nSo the world had never been so whole. No, not just intact, but.\n\"This is just another world.\"\nA peaceful otherworld, where even the war with the demons was over. How is that possible?\n\"Could it be the power of Karina Dragonia?\"\n\"Highly likely. You saw that dragon in the subspace. If he's so powerful that he can intervene in the gates and the space between them, it's no wonder even the demons were defeated.\nHow could there be such power, so much power, in a single individual?\nJust a year ago, they would have said it was nonsense. But\n\"The Lionheart King. Leon Dragonia Lionheart. The superhumans of their world are pure monsters.\"\n\"Anyone who saw the fight with the Wandering Demon Sword would think so.\"\nThe clash of swords splits the sea, and the aftermath of the battle creates a tsunami.\nEven in Korea, Infinite Swordsman Kang Jin-sung and Berserker Chun Jin-soo are two of the world's top ranked swordsmen but even they were powerless against the Demon Archduke Akasha.\n\"Even a top-ranked S-class Hunter would have a hard time dealing with the terrible debuffs of a Demon Archduke.\"\n\"Yes, even an S-class Commander can't keep up with the amount of debuffs, just like the dragon debuffs we encountered in subspace.\"\nIt was those murderous debuffs that left the Hunters helpless in face of their enemies.\nThe pressure of transcendent beings whose mere presence diminishes them beyond the limits of their creatures.\nEven Rakshar, the Demon Archduke of Chaos, overpowered America's top S-class Hunters, Allen Taylor and Minuteman. But\n\"Do you remember them, the ones who didn't care about the Dragon Fear?\"\n\"You mean the knights?\"\n\"Yeah, and there's another one.\"\n\"ah!\"\nAside from the Lionheart King and the Knights of the Ten Thousand Gods, there were others who had resisted the Dragon Fear.\n\"Allen Taylor and the Minutemen, they must be the Maverick Guild's TTG Temple devotees.\"\n\"Isn't it amazing, how the mere service of a god can give one the strength to stand up to beings so feared.\"\n\"I'm surprised, Cornish Ong.\"\n\"Because I am a wizard? No, rather because I am. I have the evidence in front of me, so why reject it?\"\nWizards are supposed to be reasonable. Since the beginning of the history of world magic, Cornwall Ong had always analyzed things and accepted them as they were.\n\"That's why this quest is an opportunity.\"\n\"An opportunitywhat do you mean?\"\n\"Getting Karina Dragonia hand in marriage. I'm sure you've guessed but she must be his daughter or related to Leon Dragonia' Lionheart, because the dragon knows him.\"\nBut why is that a chance? Cornwall Ong impatiently explained to Sir Graham, who asked for more details.\n\"In the future, the world will revolve around the TTG Temple, even after the Gate is over.\"\n\"Will it be as much as? I don't think the United States or any of the other powers will be able to.\"\n\"The TTG Temple takes the form of a religion, not a nation. We already have over 300,000 followers here in England. Do you understand? A superpower without borders is just around the corner.\"\nSo who is the most powerful man in the world centered around the TTG Temple?\nThe patriarch, the Lionheart King, of course, but Cornwall Ong went on to say.\n\"Someone who is a blood relative of the Lionheart King, that is, someone who is his son-in-law.\"\n\"Wow.\"\nIf Karina Dragonia is the daughter of Leon Dragonia Lionheart, as Cornwall Ong had speculated, then that alone would mean that she had a father who was the pope of a religious world that would rule the world in the future.\n\"This questit could determine the fate of England.\"\n\"Since Princess Diane failed, you should aim for the sire's seat.\"\nAnd at this moment, Cornwall Ong and Sir Graham were not alone in their thoughts.\n-I, an S-class hunter, became the son-in-law of the Lionheart King?\n-If I can get his daughter to be my bride, since I've failed in my bid to woo the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods to France.\n\"\"This is a great deal.\"\"\nAll people's thoughts were alike.\n* * * *\nWhile TTG Temple participation in the Washington Gate attack may have overshadowed his own, they were not the only Korean hunter who has come to the aid of the United States.\nWhile TTG Temple is Korean, its guild leader is not purely Korean in many ways.\nIt would be disgraceful for the country to send a foreign guild to support its longtime allies.\n\"Hah~ I was expecting a fierce battle.\"\n\"Well, it looks like it'll be a peaceful raid, so it's okay, right?\"\nOne of the 10 largest Korean guilds, Firebird Guild Leader Lee Yong-wan and his Vice Guild Leader Ha Yuri looked down on the dueling grounds from the grandstand, which was like a giant coliseum.\nIt was a structure reminiscent of the Roman era, but with magical contrasts everywhere. Even the terrain was exaggeratedly reminiscent of a near-future fantasy.\n\"Took you long enough. It's been over ten days since we got here.\"\n\"I don't see any signs of a dungeon break, so I guess we're good.\"\n\"Have you found the entrance to the gate, or even the Magician Queen if you're looking for her\"\nHa Yuri shook her head at Yongwan's question. The place they'd fallen to was far from the center of the empire.\nHe'd read the quest and joined a group of like-minded guild members as they traveled to the Imperial Capital to fulfill it.\nWhen they finally made it to the capital, the first Hunters were already engaged in a courtship duel.\n\"That's great, by the way, this is some big event business, and at the kings insistence, the officials are using their brains to keep the budget in check.\nThe courtship of Carina Dragonia was an empire-wide, national event.\nThe imperial family sold tickets to citizens, hosted restaurants, and ran otherworldly tournaments to keep the budget for this ongoing big event afloat.\n\"What were the rules?\"\n\"Challengers from tournaments around the country must challenge the champion' and win.\"\n\"You mean the leading suitor. And if you beat the champion?\"\n\"Then you become the champion, and the champion must-\"\nA hundred defenses.\nFor three years, there were countless challengers, champions, but the reason they failed was this.\nThey failed after a hundred defenses, and the longest-lasting champion had forty-four successful defenses.\n\"No, doesn't that mean we can't even challenge? I think we should go around the provincial cities first.\"\n\"Technically, winning the provincial tournament comes first, but there is an exception. Apparently, if you destroy a special golem, you can challenge the Champion.\"\n\"I see, so those who are confident in their skills can go straight to the main event.\"\nIn that case, there would be no need to waste time traveling to local and national tournaments.\n\"Well, it seems that there are some sincere people who don't know that and come from the provinces.\"\nAt that moment, a magically amplified voice echoed through the courtship arena.\n[Dear citizens of the Empire, the long-awaited battle for the crowning of a champion begins now!]\n\"It's finally starting.\"\n\"We might have to challenge the current champion, so let's watch carefully.\"\nThis was the reason they had come here.\nJust like the example of the eponymous dragon they had witnessed in the subspace, there would be a powerhouse here.\nHow strong they were would determine the success of the Hunters' quest.\n\"I guess they didn't realize that destroying a golem earns them a challenge.\"\n\"It's ten days, so there will be all sorts of cases, but if it's Englandis that them?\"\nOne by one, the challengers are introduced by the emcee. At the forefront is a knight in shining silver armor.\n[Undefeated in the Naritan Tournament, the number one ranked player in the Naritan Tournament with an overwhelming undefeated record, the undefeated silver knight, Graham!]\nSir Graham is an S-class Hunter from the Gentlemen's League, one of the largest guilds in England.\nThis genius swordsman, who was awarded a knighthood by Queen Victoria at a young age, is considered to be the next generation of Britain.\nAnd walking beside him is a giant of a man.\n[Next up is Naritan, ranked No. 2! His record is truly overwhelming! If he hadn't lost a time-over decision to Sir Graham the Silver Knight, he would have been ranked No. 1! Invincible and unstoppable! A man of living, breathing steel! Gnther Noordt!!!]\nGnther Noordt is considered the best tanker in Germany and possibly the best tanker in Europe. Even the number one ranked, Sir Graham, could not penetrate this man's defense and had to settle for a judgment.\n[Both suitors are undoubtedly skilled, but this man may be the one to fear!]\nAn elderly gentleman in a suit adjusted his thick silk hat at the moderator's introduction.\n[Despite being a mage, he has overwhelmed countless warriors to reach the semifinals! However, when the third place in the rankings was confirmed, the mysterious Archmage Cornwall, who had lost a series of disqualifications, oooooooooh!!!]\n\"Hall, hall, hall there's no need to waste your strength.\"\nThe old archmage was actually the undisputed leader of this place.\nThe pride of the British magical world, the first Archmage and receiver of a Dukedom or Master of the Epic Item Twelve Circles.\nThere are many words to describe him, but they all point to the same thing but the word legend sums it up.\n[Now, then, the current champion who will accept the suitors' challenge, the strongest champion of all time who has crushed all challengers so far-Wait, what are you doing!]\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Uh, that guy.\"\nIt was a huge red armor that suddenly stormed in, snatching the moderator's magic tool for announcements.\nAn influencer that Earthlings have become all too familiar with recently. Holy Knight Vulcanus.\n\"Vulcanus! Vulcanus!\"\n\"Vulcanus! Vulcanus!\"\nAnd the knights who support him.\nVulcanus, far too confident for a trespasser, began to take over as moderator.\n[Today! We shall witness! Master of myths! Knight of legends!]\n[The one beloved of brilliance!]\n[One who embraces the flames of battle!]\n[He who divides the seas and stirs up the waves!]\n[Who he is!

Takeda had challenged the golem to a courtship duel to earn his ticket to the championship.\nStrength in itself is nothing. It's as dull as a golem and has no special abilities.\nBut the ignorant defense that covers it. It's not quite iron, but it's like a whole bunch of metal just below it.\n\"Takeda-san, come on!\"\nTakeda shrugged as the Japanese Hunters cheered him on.\n\"An ordinary S-class Hunter would have had a hard time, but!\"\nTakeda's Star Iron Sword was engulfed in a blinding brilliance. A devotee of Arianna, the Goddess of Light and Justice, he is a formal knight who is often referred to as Lord Takeda by Leon when he visits the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods.\nHoly Law <Blade of Radiance>\nThere is nothing that a blade of light that cuts through demons cannot cut!\n-Kwazik!\nThe golem's arm was severed but it didn't end there.\nTakeda's long sword danced in a brilliant dance, dismembering the golem. By the end of the sequence, the light from the long sword slowly diminished, but all that remained on the ground was the golem, cut into 18 pieces.\n\"Waaaaah!\"\n\"It's Takeda-san after all!\"\n\"Huh, that's about it.\"\nBefore Takeda could express his joy at having won the championship challenge, he saw his Star Iron Sword, which was still intact after shattering the golem.\nThe original Star Iron Armor of the Ten Thousand Gods is only available to those who have been knighted and recognized by the gods of the Ten Thousand Gods.\nHowever, their performance is strictly divided. While the basic Star Iron Sword is of the highest quality, at least Unique, the true value of a Star Iron Armor depends on whether or not the gods bless the wielder.\nOnly a Knight of Realms who has faithfully practiced the Holy Law and received the blessing of the gods can unleash the true power of the Stellar Iron Armor.\nIt's amazing, I can feel the Goddess lending me strength.\nEver since the Wandering Demon Sword incident, Takeda has been completely obsessed with the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.\nIn Japan, the number of believers has been growing exponentially to the point where there is a phenomenon known as the TTG Syndrome, but few of them have been blessed by the gods themselves by practicing holy arts.\nEven Takeda's swordsmanship students number less than a dozen.\n\"Takeda-san, thank you for your hard work!\"\n\"Yeah. You should give it a try.\"\n\"No, no, I can't do it. I'm only an A-class Hunter.\"\n\"Hahaha, with your skills, you'll have a tough time. You'd be outclassed by a golem. But you're also a knight, blessed by the goddess, and if you had the power of the Holy Law, it'd be a lump of scrap metal.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\nMichida was puzzled as he looked at the remains of a golem so powerful that Takeda would struggle. The power of holy law is definitely a cheat, but\n\"By the way, the power of the Holy Law is amazing. To create hundreds' of golems like that. Isn't it a real monster?\"\nAt a glance, the golems prepared to challenge for the position of champion were more than a hundred strong.\nA single person could create a golem that was at least a Class A Hunterisn't that a one-man army?\n\"His Majesty the Lionheart King and Lord Vulcanuswhat are the people of that world eating?\"\n\"They are knights of the gods who have fought for hundreds of years. They're not exactly like us.\"\nThat was it. As Takeda was leaving the testing grounds, he saw a new challenger emerge from the entrance.\n\"Are there others besides us, Your Majesty?\"\n\"\"His Majesty the Lionheart!\"\"\nTakeda and the Japanese Hunters ran to Leon and bowed low.\n\"I see you're safe after all, Your Majesty, and we've accepted the Champion Challenge for?\"\nTakeda realized something was wrong as he spoke. Before he could mention it, Leon asked.\n\"Are you one of those guys who participates in courtship duels?\"\n\"What? Ah, that's what quests are for, huh?\"\nMeeting Leon's gaze, Takeda felt his breath catch in his throat. Such an unpleasant gazewhere had he offended him?\n\"Bring me the golem.\"\n\"First, sign the consent form in case you are injured by the golem\"\n\"Uh-huh, what's the big deal, if it comes, it will come!\"\nLeon yelled at the examiner who was questioning the procedure.\n\"Nah you agreed to it the moment you came here anyway, don't blame me later!\"\nSoon, the golem stomped in front of Leon. At least three times the size of a human, the full-bodied golem was intimidating in its own right.\nEven as it stared down at him, Leon did not waver in the slightest. On the contrary\n\"An inanimate object, yet it dares to look down on the king. How insolent!\"\nLeon's gaze pierced the giant. The next moment, something incredible happened.\n-A crunch!\nThe golem is crushed by something as space shifts, and the ground beneath their feet shakes but only the golem and its surroundings were being crushed by something.\n[Solemn Divine Law, Article 1, Paragraph 1! The Lionheart King has the authority to act on behalf of the Ten Thousand Gods!]\nThe giant's form emerges from thin air, radiating intense sunlight and heat. In his right hand he holds a giant hammer, and in his left hand he holds the Laws of the Divine Kingdom.\nIts authority is different from that of the Constitution. It is a law given by the gods to the mortal world, a mission for mortals to fulfill at all costs.\nThe human law of thou shalt not kill has exceptions for self-defense, barbarians, and serfs, but the divine law is absolute.\nTatar of the Sun and Judgment.\nThe guardian of the divine law judges insults on behalf of the Lionheart King.\nHoly Law <Crime: Insulting royalty. Sentence: Death>\nThe moment the hammer comes down, the golem's knees are forced to buckle. Unable to hold on for another moment, the golem falls face first to the ground and buries itself in a crater.\n\"Mu, what.\"\nInside the crater, the shredded form of the golem lies in ruins.\nLeon strode over to the examiner, who seemed unconcerned with the shattered golem.\n\"I will challenge the champion immediately. Prepare your seats.\"\n\"Ah, yes! Yes!\"\nLeon immediately used the challenge ticket he received for destroying the golem. His gaze turned to Takeda.\n\"Were you a suitor, too?\"\n\"No.\"\nSensing that Leon would naturally become the champion, Takeda neatly gave up the challenge he had earned.\n\"Wise.\"\nLeon's icy gaze softened a bit as he turned to face Takeda, the seat he had left. Michida approached him cautiously and asked.\n\"Why did he do that?\"\n\"I guess fathers are like that.\"\n\"What?\"\nMichida gave him a wide-eyed look as if he didn't know what he was talking about. Takeda realized with a start that he was still young.\n* * * *\n\"\"\n\"\"\nLeon came out as the champion.\nFor a moment, the Hunters thought, -That's okay.\n-We need the champion to beat the quest.\n-His Majesty Leon would almost certainly be able to defend.\n-Is it settled that she's going to marry Yongje?\nKarina \"Dragonia\".\nLionheart King Leon Dragonia'.\nThe audience's gaze becomes puzzled as they realize the similarities. Especially since some of them knew that Karina Dragonia was Leon's real daughter.\n-I heard in one of Leon's classes that the daughter of the Priestess of Chastity and King Leon was definitely named Karina!\n-How did she get married if she was a priestess of chastity?\n-The king took her away before the temple could protest.\n-???\nIn other words, Leon and Karina are related. Direct blood relatives, too.\n-How did they marry? Father and daughter No way!\n-Of course not!\n-Be careful or you'll die for insulting royalty!\nIn any case, Leon would never marry Karina if he were her biological father. Leon's purpose, then, boils down to one thing.\n\"Uh-huh Your Majesty, do you really intend to fend off all the suitors?\"\nCornwall Ong, facing Leon in the center of the dueling grounds, confirmed his intentions.\n\"Should I not?\"\nSir Graham, the Silver Knight of England, said cautiously, trying to be polite.\n\"Your MajestyI thought the quest we were given was to marry' Her Majesty Karina?\"\n\"So?\"\n\"Whoever wins the courtship must be successful in order to take the gate and escape, right?\"\n\"Ino-oh-oh!\"\nLeon's shout echoed through the arena.\n\"How dare you treat a royal ambassador like a mere mission!\"\n\"No, in fact, how could you.\"\n\"You will never rise above me!\"\nWrong, you're a father, distracted by the news of his daughter's courtship.\n\"We're wasting no time! Come on, all of you, I'll test your worthiness today!\"\nThe German S-class Hunter, Gnther, is struck by the ego-stroking words.\n\"The Lionheart King, your reputation is well known even in Europe, but don't you think it's overkill to take on the three of us by yourself?\"\nFrom the side, Sir Graham muttered, \"I think so,\" but he stopped himself from saying more by taking a step to the side.\n\"Ho, ho, what's your name?\"\n\"Gnther Noordt. I'm a colonel in the Bundeswehr.\"\n\"C'monyou have the mettle to call yourself a warrior!\"\nLeon exclaimed.\n\"Stallion!\"\nThe next moment, a white steed ripped through space. Riding atop it, the Lion King raised his jousting lance.\n\"But you're nothing more than a thief trying to steal the king's treasure.\"\n\"This is the mounted charge you boast of, and I'll take it.\"\n\"Let's go, Stallion!\"\nLeon shouted, and Stallion let out a feral roar and began to pound the ground.\n\"Hmphthat's about as fast as a horse can go.\"\nGnther raised his massive shield, a square shield larger than most men. It symbolized his status as Germany'sand Europe'sbest tanker.\nIt's common knowledge that a hunter's power is greater than a horse's. I've seen horses with no mana go faster'\n-Heh!\nHmm? Too fast?\nIt wasn't that the distance between them was that great, but Stallion's charging momentum was too fierce and ferocious.\n-Thump, thump, thump!\nThis was not the sound of horses' hooves, but the sound of a giant dinosaur weighing tens of tons charging in for the kill.\nThe ground vibrated with the thuds of its extremely advanced lower body.\nThe white horse's momentum is too terrifyingly massive to be called a horse.\nNo wonder since it's an ally that has fought alongside the Lionheart King for hundreds of years.\nIn terms of warrior prowess, no hunter on Earth can match it.\nNot even the heavens can match him, as he has awakened his ancient blood.\n\"Perfect Guardian!\"\nThe overwhelming presence forced Gnther to hastily use his skills.\nThe reason he was an iron wall was the tank skill Perfect Guardian, also known as absolute defense, a unique cheat skill that uses health and magic to offset 90% of the opponent's damage for 30 seconds.\nWith it, he was able to block even the deadly moves of S-class bosses. But\n\"To the LionheartDie!!!\"\n\"?!\"\nStrongest Charger X Lionheart Jousting Tournament Deadly Lance Charge.\nIn Leons youth, he used this to defeat countless knights and win tournaments.\n-Bam!\nIn the moment of shock, Gnther didn't even finish hearing the sound but his body was sent flying into the distance.\n\"Huh?\"\nThe impact was so powerful that there was no scream.\nAside from the crushing sensation of his hand, Gnther thought he was being sucked toward something.\n\"The entrance to the dueling grounds?\nGnther continues to fly back the way it came in.\n\"\"\n\"\"\nThere's no such thing as an underdog in a courtship duel, but Gnther was clearly an overdog.\n-Bam! Quack!\nAt the sound Sir Graham and Cornwall Ong exchanged glances in disbelief.\n\"Looks like we've struck a nerve.\"\n\"We're out of options, aren't we?\"\nGraham watched Gnther fly away, unable to give up.\nHunters from the United States, Japan, and other countries gathered here.\nHe can't bear to see himself and Cornwall Ong, the two pride of British hunters, cowering and retreating.\nIt's embarrassing.\nI'm not sure it's any less so against that Lionheart Kingbut it's got its own kind of bravado.\n\"That was close to instantaneous acceleration, but nothing I can't handle.\"\n\"Indeed, Fastest Knight, did you see that?\"\n\"I'm no match for it on my own, but with the Duke of Cornwall's support.\"\n\"Leave it to me.\"\nThe Duke of Cornwall raised the Twelve Rings, his magic infused and the Epic Item's power unleashed.\nTwelve Rings <Ninth Magic: Enhance>.\nA miraculous Epic item that utilizes twelve great spells, its ninth ability is to enhance all buff spells.\nIn exchange for draining 20% of Cornwall Ong magic, all of his buffs are tripled in effectiveness for 10 seconds.\nTo maximize the effect, Cornwall Ong's unique skill triggers.\nUnique Skill <Haste Creed>\nIt was a self-buffing skill that drastically reduces the activation time of magic. Then\n\"<Super Strength>, <Triple Attack>, <Perfect Invisibility>, <Magic Word>, <Time Alter>, <Greater Resistance>, <Greater Magic Shield>, <Ultimate Armor>.\"\nBuff spells rained down like a barrage and each one of these ultimate buffs, available only to the highest ranking mages, is aimed at a single person.\nThe ultimate buffs that would normally be distributed to the entire party were instead directed at Graham alone.\n\"So much powerit feels like omnipotence. I could take down anything.\"\n\"Ive used more than half of my magic. At your current level, you're beyond an S-class Hunter.\"\n\"Leave it to me.\"\nThe next moment, Graham's body was gone since his speed was beyond even Stallion's charge.\n\"What?\"\nLeon dismounted from his horse, dismissing Stallion's summons, and scanned the Graham hovering around him.\nHe was fast.\nThat speed could be described as lightning fast.\nThere was only one reason he was hovering around Leon, stomping on the ground to the point of damaging the dueling grounds just by running.\n\"The moment I see an opening, I'll pierce it with my fastest, most powerful blow!\nGraham stares at Leon as time slows to a crawl.\nThe Lionheart King's superhuman strength was widely known but he was aided by Cornwall Ong's buffing magic.\nI won't let my guard down. I have to make sure to smash him before he can react to my speed. He won't even see me.\nAnd so it was. Graham's Perfect Invisibility made him invisible, even to Leon.\n\"How noisy you are, like a fly; did you think you could escape my sight?\"\nThe next moment, Leon held his holy sword high, a stance too simple and ineffective for swordsmanship.\nIt was more like a stance for a hammer than a sword.\n\"No matter how fast you are, as long as the Earth Goddess is with me, no one can escape the grace of the land without my permission.\"\n\"Huh!\"\nLee Yong-wan and Ha Yuri gasped as the two members of the Korean Firebird Guild intuitively realized that Leon's preparatory stance was similar to that of a certain knight.\nAn intangible energy that sucked in the air, devouring it ferociously. Realizing that it was dangerous', Graham was about to pounce when-\nDivine Punishment <Earth Shattering>\nThe sword strikes down like a hammer, as if it had trapped an explosive shockwave and released it once and for all.\n-Crack!!!\nUnavoidable shockwaves exploded in all directions.\n\"Kkkk!?\"\nGraham was sent flying by the intangible, omnidirectional shockwave. He gasped for breath and looked at Leon with a frozen expression.\n\"What kind of monster!\"\nBut the sword tip of the holy sword already pointed at Graham and Graham quickly raised his hands.\n\"Ha, I surrender.\"\n\"Huh!\"\nLeon looked down at Graham, who quickly raised the white flag, with an unpleasant expression, before turning his gaze to the old mage.\n\"I, too, will surrender.\"\n\"You're not a fighter, I'm sure with that staff you could hold off a few more.\"\n\"I'm too old for a fight with a fixed outcome.\"\n\"How old are you?\"\n\"Seventy this year, sir\"\n\"You're in your prime.\"\n\"\"\nFor the first time, he realized that the young man in front of him was actually a 300 year old man.\n\"Three down today, eighty-eight to go, and I'm feeling pretty good about it.\"\nWith the three S-class Hunters so overpowered, Leon shouts to the stunned crowd.\n\"Hear ye, all men who ask for the hand of Karina Dragonia!\"\nLeon declared to all the suitors in attendance.\n\"It would be a waste of time to wait until we have a hundred. Anyone is good. I don't care how many there are! Come on, all of you, if you have the courage to risk the wrath of the Lionheart King!\"\nLeon turns the grueling defense of a hundred champions into a game of no rules, no limits.\nCornwall Ong said.\n\"King Lionheart, I know you are strong, but is not this an impossible statement?\"\n\"Impossible?\"\n\"Yes. There are the best hunters in the world besides us here, and to face them alone is\"\n\"Arguing impossibility with this king, indeed, the ambition of a young man.\"\n\"\"\nThe old gentleman, who had become a young man in his sleep, could only keep his mouth shut in front of the 300-year-old man, who gave him another reason to keep it shut.\n-Clang, clang, clang!\nLightning strikes in a dry sky.\n-Kaaaaaaaah!\nWaves crashing from nowhere without a drop of water.\n-Kuwaaaaaaaaah!\nFlames soaring as if to cover the entire world.\n\"Behold. Nothing is impossible for a king as beloved as this king.\"\nLeon's holy sword pointed at the crowd. It was a declaration of war.\n\"No one, no one, no one can claim to be the son-in-law of royalty, no one!\"\nAs the Hunters watched, they thought.\nHow will we ever complete the quest?",

For the first time, people realized that a man could fly higher than the clouds.\n\"Ino-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!\nAustralian S-class hunter Jerry McDowell was also smashed. He was beaten particularly badly, probably because he said in the arena, \"Father-in-law, give me your daughter!\n\"Lee Yong-wan!\"\n\"Ki, I want to withdraw.\"\n\"You shouldn't have to make a fuss about challenging\"\nLee Yong-wan, an S-level Hunter from the Korean Firebird Guild, was one of the challengers. He had already won the challenge, so he had no choice but to fight.\n\"Your majesty! Wait! Gentle!\"\n\"You lowly brat!\"\nMaybe it was because of his aversion, but being beaten by Leon was more painful and sad.\nAnd so the twenty-seventh challenger was defeated and returned home. They sighed and looked at each other.\n\"I don't think it's going to work, do you?\"\n\"I think so.\"\n* * * *\nIt had been three days and three nights since Leon had been crowned champion and had put up an overwhelming defense.\n\"Yes, yes, yes, champion, if you need anything, just tell us. We'll arrange everything.\"\n\"Prepare the bathwater.\"\nIt's the sort of thing you'd pay a lot of money for, especially when you're Leon, who is said to have defeated the most suitors of any champion in history, and the highest chance of winning' a match.\nOf course, there's no way he's going to do anything stupid like marry his own daughter.\n\"Hmm.\"\nLeon was about to retire to his chambers to rest up after his latest bout with suitors, when an old man approached him.\n\"Are you Mr. Leon Lionheart?\"\nLeon's eyes widened as he realized the man had left out the name Dragonia. Under that stern gaze, the old man bowed deeply.\n\"I beg your pardon, Your Majesty, but it is not my place to disrespect your dignity.\"\nThe old man, the head chamberlain of the palace, bowed and tried not to incur Leon's wrath.\nA chamberlain of the palace was not to be trifled with, even by the highest nobility, but the old man had to consider that the man before him claimed to be the father of the Emperor.\nHis own superhuman strength alone was enough to make him worthy of respect.\n\"Hmph, it is right that your loyalty should be to those you serve. I'm glad you understand that at such a young age.\"\n\"\"\nWatching his grandson enter the academy this year, the chamberlain felt a subtle disconnect with the young man in front of him, who looked to be in his twenties.\nThe Emperor himself was no more than two hundred years old this Spring Equinox, and while the man before him looked younger than that, if he was indeed the Emperor's father, there was no telling how old he was.\n\"This king wishes to see Karina.\"\n\"! Yes, sir!\"\nThe chamberlain was taken aback by the act of addressing the Emperor, but he did as he was told.\nI've been waiting to see when she would summon me, but apparently my patience is shorter than I thought.\"\n\"At your service.\"\nLeon didn't like the chamberlain's attitude. How could he not draw his dagger when his lord was called so lightly?\nIf King Lionheart had been treated lightly in Lionheart, the knights beneath him would not have left the one who did it alone.\nThose who do not have the right faith.\nThe king's authority is divine, and the lightness of those who fail to honor it must be remedied by education and edification.\nThe carriage was ready, guided by the unpleasant chamberlain. Leon looked at it and clicked his tongue.\n\"What a shabby carriage.\"\nThe carriage was ornately decorated with jewels and gilt. Of course, the carriages of high nobility should not be compared to those of commoners, especially if it's royalty.\nThis was a bit much, Leon thought, but he held back until they reached the palace and he entered the room set aside for him in the palace.\n\"\"\nIt's gorgeous. From the entrance, only one person was allowed to walk down the pathway, which was lined with pure white marble and molten gold, and nothing was spared, from the trim to the tapestries to the artwork.\nThe rooms were equally luxurious and Leon could practically smell the money spent.\n\"Tsk.\"\n\"You don't like it?\"\n\"You don't understand luxury. It's just a bunch of expensive jewelry and gold. It's not the taste of nobility, it's the taste of rich people pretending to be nobility.\"\nLeon looked at the dark-haired woman who had been in the room since the beginning, waiting for him.\nKarina Dragonia, the rightful Grand Duchess of Dragonia and holder of the imperial title known in this world as the Dragon Emperor, also his own daughter, lost two hundred years ago.\nLeon alternated between the blue eyes that resembled his own and the black hair that resembled hers.\n\"Your tastes have grown foul in my absence.\"\n\"In my old age, my eyes are drawn to all things shiny.\"\n\"Do not forget the curse of gold. Or are you already under that curse?\"\n\"Yes. .\"\nKarina didn't answer since Leon knew it was a difficult question to answer.\nHe changed the subject he had brought up.\n\"I've traveled around the empire, and it's quite advanced. The commoners don't know hunger, and the nobles are fairly faithful to their duties. Without the help of the gods, you've created quite a country to behold.\"\n\"Absolute power somehow manifests itself in the presence of absolute force. It wasn't that hard to do.\"\n\"Yeah. Well, whatever.\"\nHe opened his arms.\n\"Come here. Let's hug.\"\nKarina walked over to Leon without a word. He opened his arms even wider, making it easier for her to get into his arms but Karina didn't take him in her arms, just faced him head-on. It was almost as if they were in opposition.\n\"Stop it.\"\n\"Stop what?\"\n\"Shooing away the suitors.\"\nLeon sighed softly, loosening his arms.\n\"What's wrong with a father picking a son-in-law?\"\n\"It is a matter of state business, a state business of ensuring the proper seed for the next Emperor.\"\n\"This king wants you to marry in love as I and your mother did.\"\n\"Your Majesty, it will be one or the other.\"\nKarina's gaze flicked to Leon, her stare sterile.\n\"A cog in the kingdom, or the head of a warm home, Your Majesty has already chosen.\"\nLeon had already chosen the kingdom over his wife.\n\"Your choice is perfectly right, and so are the duties of this Emperor.\"\nA conclusion she reached, she said, not as Archduke of Dragonia, not as a blood relative of the Lionheart King, but as Emperor of the Dragonia Empire.\n\"You are not doing this because of him, are you?\"\n\"\"\nKarina was silent at Leon's point. Then Leon spoke up.\n\"Why are you in such a hurry to find suitors? Do you think this king doesn't know, I was the last Grand Duke of Dragonia before you.\"\n\"So. What will the Lionheart King do?\"\n\"I will share the burden with my daughter. Our forefathers always prepared for such things.\"\n\"I decline.\"\nKarina rejected Leon's offer. She turned her back on him and opened the door.\n\"Enough. This is not your kingdom. It's my empire, and everything that happens here is my responsibility.\"\n\"Karina!\"\nLeon's shout brought her to a halt. It was the voice of a father she hadn't heard in far too long, a voice that hadn't ended well.\nHe echoed it every day with regret, so he spoke frankly of his feelings.\n\"I gave birth to you in love with Castile. I want you to have a love that shines like a star. That is my duty as your father.\"\nI will not abandon my duty.\n* * * *\n\"Emperor!\"\nShe pushed past maids and servants who bowed urgently at the sight of Karina.\nKarina walks in silence, not saying a word, until she reaches her office.\n[Haha, what a tearful display of paternalism and filial piety.]\nA booming voice echoed from within, and Karina's brow narrowed at the sneer.\n\"Shut up.\"\n[You haven't seen your father in two hundred years, that's a long time for you midgets. Shouldn't you be enjoying this father-daughter reunion a little more?]\nKarina didn't answer him.\nAs she had said time and time again, she did not blame Leon.\nShe knew from the beginning that there was nothing wrong with his choice but that and this are different things.\n[But it's amazing how you managed to overcome the forces of so many evil creatures. The Wisdom Lord was no ordinary man. Perhaps that war was one that the tin men could have won.]\n\"No, it wasn't.\"\n[Hmm?]\nKarina said into the void where no one was. The dense black aura in the air seemed to be poking its head around.\n\"There is a pantheon of gods in the heart of the Lionheart King. That must have been their last refuge.\"\n[Haoh, this is so I see, such things have fallen, abandoning such a magnificent temple to burrow into a cramped heart to survive.]\nThere was even a hint of amusement in the black thing's voice; after so many years of competing with the gods for supremacy of the world, the fall of a rival should be pleasant.\n[Karina, you should have taken the man's offer, it was your only way to live.]\n\"I am strong enough to withstand you.\"\n[Even your ancestor couldn't stand me, so he left me to his children, and still you midgets can't understand my power.]\nThe black, dragon-like' shadow sneered at Karina.\n[It makes no difference, you must pay for the murder, my curse will not end until your bloodline is destroyed, and the moment you lose the heart, the scourge of mortals will begin.]\n\"It will not be so.\"\n[Then what will you do? You do not have much time, and there is no one stronger in the world than the Lionheart King who can stand against me.]\n\"No, there is one.\"\n* * * *\nMeanwhile, the International Hunter Coalition had taken up quarters in the capital and were meeting there.\n\"Mr. Lee, over here!\"\nLee Yong-wan was greeted by Allen Taylor, an S-class Hunter from the Maverick Guild of the United States.\n\"Mr. Taylor. Where's Minuteman?\"\n\"He's out earning his keep. Didn't Miss Ha go with him?\"\n\"Uh, and Yuri?\"\n\"Oooh~ Someone has to earn money for lodging.\"\nThousands of International Hunter Alliance troops had gathered in the capital, and naturally, there were expenses for their food and sleep, which the Hunters were covering by taking jobs from the Dragonia Empire.\nThis would have to do until the courtship duel to break the quest was over.\n\"By the way, this is a big deal. I don't see any sign of the courtship duel ending.\"\n\"That's because the Lionheart King is holding out.\"\nThe problem is that Leon blocked the way. Dozens of S-class Hunters have already tried, but they've been crushed and lost.\n\"I don't think we can take on the Lionheart king one-on-one.\"\n\"I couldn't agree more. There are the best hunters in the world here, but they couldn't hurt the Lion King.\"\nYong-wan remembered the green Holy Knight he had met at the Jeju Island Gate, Holy Knight Georgic.\nThat monster knight had been attacked by four S-class Hunters and they hadn't been able to inflict a single wound.\nHe should be at least as strong as that, if not stronger, to have a chance against the Lionheart King.\nThat can't be right, those Holy Knights are his minions.\nBeatrice the Magician Queen.\nYakt Spinner, the killing machine.\nVulcanus the Butcher.\nThe fearsomeness of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods does not come from Leon alone, even his henchmen are monsters.\nThe only thing they can say is that they are out of the ordinary, and they have a god behind them.\n\"Let's get going, then.\"\n\"You mean the dueling grounds? There won't be any fighters from our side today, will there?\"\n\"Well, there may be other powerhouses in this world. It's always fun to watch a fight.\"\nAllen Taylor was next up, and I'm told he's been training pretty hard since the Rakshar fight.\nHe was excited to learn something from a fight with someone so much stronger than him.\nWell, against the Lionheart King.'\nYong-wan didn't expect much. This was his forty-fifth suitor today.\nAt this rate, even if there were a hundred, Leon would win easily.\n\"Who am I!\"\nA raspy, booming voice. A voice that could hardly be recognized as human heated up the arena.\n[[Butcher!]]\n[[Beheader!]]\n[[Slayer!]]\n\"Huh?\"\nWhat?\n\"Who am I!\"\n[[Agent of Divine Punishment!]]\n[[War Horseman of Doom!]]\n-Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!\nThe enthusiastic voices fill the stadium, and the armored hulk, drunk with it, is like a popular villain in professional wrestling.\n[Alas! What an enthusiastic response! Indeed, what an overwhelming presence! The monster who is said to have wiped out not one but two golems crafted by His Majesty with a single blow has issued a challenge to today's champion, and his name is]\nThe red-armored man draws two holy swords. The flaming holy swords, with their auspicious and violent aura, seem to represent the ferocity of this man.\n[Vulca~~~~~~Nus!!!!]\nWhy are you here?",

      "content": "Chapter 194:\nWhen Leon announced that he was taking part in Karina's courtship duel, the Knights of the Ten Thousand Gods cocked their heads.\n\"Isn't the Archduke of Dragonia finally getting ready to marry?\"\n\"That's a good thing, but why stop her?\"\n\"Hmm. Didn't Lord Tarhan have a daughter?\"\n\"What, Lord Raihar?\"\nLord Tarhan, a veteran Knight of the Burning Sword, tilted his head at Raihar's words.\n\"Hoo-hoo, I can sympathize with your Majesty, I too had a daughter.\n\"I know. It was Raina, wasn't it?\"\n\"Huhmy Raina, the one who had a place to stand with a sturdy knight of Lord Petos, and this father laid out a path of flowers\"\n\"By the way, didn't your daughter marry a judge of Tatar? Better a judge than a knight.\"\nLord Raihar gritted his teeth and raged, remembering the daughter who had once defied her father's will and married a magistrate who served Tatar, God of the Sun and Judgment.\n\"Why do you speak of the past so uselessly, Lord Tarhan?\"\n\"No, Frolain, didn't he later become a magistrate of the kingdom? I thought you were proud of your son-in-law?\"\n\"What father would be proud of a son-in-law? They'll kill them all.\"\n\"\"\nTarhan, whose life's work had been kicking orcs and barbarians in the face for the sake of war, didn't know what it was like to be a parent, but he got the point.\n\"His Majesty feels the same way.\"\n\"His Majesty and the Queen had a difficult love affair, so it must be even worse.\"\nThe story of Leon and Queen Castile's love affair was well known throughout the kingdom.\nIt was also the first time the Lionheart King defied the will of the gods, forcing an abduction marriage that incurred the wrath of Dinah, the goddess of the moon and purity.\nIt's no wonder he felt the way he did, since the child he bore after such an arduous love story was Grand Duchess Karina.\n\"Let's not interfere with His Majesty's participation in this courtship duel and cheer him on.\"\n\"Hmm Well, it's only natural that His Majesty would show attachment to his long-lost daughter.\"\nThe late arrivals, the Knights of the TTG Temple and Vulcanus, agreed. They all seem to be enjoying the situation, quest completion aside.\n\"Oh, so that's his daughter. I'll have to pay her a visit sometime.\"\n-Phew!\nOne day, as the only superpowers capable of stopping the rampaging Lionheart King were expressing their resignation, Karina came to the inn where the knights of the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods were staying.\n\"It's been a long time, Lord Raihar. I thought the Knights of the Burning Sword were missing, but I see you're alive and well.\"\n\"Long time no see, Archduke of Dragonia. No, I should call you Your Majesty.\"\n\"That would be the proper protocol in this land.\"\nThe knights finished with their titles, they bowed to Empress Karina.\n\"If I may ask, what business do you have with us, Your Majesty, the Lionheart King is away at the moment.\"\n\"No, it is not His Majesty the Lionheart I have business with.\"\n\"Then?\"\n\"I have come to see Lord Vulcanus.\"\n* * * *\nLeon shuddered at Vulcanus' betrayal.\nThere had been an unspoken agreement that no representatives of the TTG Temple would be present in this courtship duel.\nHe knew how Leon would feel about the daughter he hadn't seen in centuries.\n\"Lord Vulcanus. I trusted you!\"\n\"GARARARARA! Don't be so hard on yourself. As a friend of the Archduchess Karina shouldnt I take the side of the less fortunate?\"\n\"Karina, do you mean to tell me that the girl herself asked you to do this?\"\nTo fight a courtship duel?\n\"No, she knows you well. You may be a barbarian, but you're actually quite calculating, and you've decided that your friendship with Karina will benefit you more than your friendship with this king.\"\n[Lord Vulcanus, I know your ambitions are greater than you think, but as long as the Lionheart King is alive, your limitations will always be as a Holy Knight, am I wrong?]\nKarina suggested to Vulcanus.\nIf you woo me, marry me, and bear my children, I will give you the throne.\nI know it's a feudal throne in a vassal state, not an imperial throne, but even that is a huge class transcendence for Lord Vulcanus.\nBorn a barbarian warrior, Vulcanus was a warrior of an evil god, commanding a million barbarians.\nWhen he entered the gates of the Lionheart King, he became a Holy Knight, but he was not given a \"province\" like other Holy Knights.\nVulcanus, who had his own admiration for the strength and power of the nobility of civilized nations, wanted his own estates and the absolute authority of a king.\nUntil now, his loyalty to Leon and the gods had merely suppressed that desire.\n\"Huh Lord Vulcanus has been singing about wanting a fiefdom for a long time, so it's no wonder. God of War, would you grant it?\"\nBut there's no way Vulcanus could have done this without the approval of his patron god, Petos of War and Flame.\n[Not bad.]\n\"\"\nLeon waited a moment longer, not questioning Petos' words. He knew Petos would explain to convince him.\n[It's not enough to be king, you know. For the world to be more right, we need absolute power that cannot be broken. We need a Holy Empire.]\nIf Vulcanus becomes king, Leon will inevitably be elevated to that position.\nEven if Leon himself recognizes Vulcanus as an equal king, the gods will not allow Leon to be the pinnacle of the human world.\nThe gods wanted Leon to be more absolute, to wield unchecked power, and it was for the good of the pantheon.\nOf course, not all of the gods were in favor of this, and there are principlists everywhere.\n[The authority of the Lionheart King is not comparable to the kingship of mortals. Do not stir up trouble over mere titles, War.]\n[The mortals do not recognize the difference between name and actual authority, Sun. Do you not know that it was their arrogance that led to the empire and the emperor's existence being sanctioned by the legitimate authority of past Lionheart kings?]\n[Well, it's not like War is wrong. Lionheart has not ruled the world because it wishes to see the mortals grow and develop on their own but how foolishly those who do not know the right faith have chosen.]\nThe divinity of iron and blacksmithing knew how the world of his Holy Knight, Yappy that had progressed far ahead of Earth was destroyed.\nAs the Gods' debate raged, Leon felt the need to summarize.\n\"Gods, this duel is not that complicated.\"\nLeon looked at Vulcanus, not that he had any particular purpose in representing the gods, let alone fulfilling his ambitions at this late date.\n\"Fighting a bunch of thieves as a father. That's all that matters.\"\n\"GRARARARA!\nLeon simplified the matter and added another thing.\n\"This is a very personal fight, Lord Vulcanus, please refrain from invoking the power of the gods.\"\n\"Ho-ho, that is a much more unfavorable condition for Your Majesty, is it not?\"\nVulcanus bowl is huge. It is perhaps the greatest talent of all time, and if it weren't for Leon, he could easily have become the Lionheart King.\nBut he only represents one god, after all. He is no match for the Lionheart King, who represents all the gods.\n\"Why do I need to borrow power from the gods to punish bandits?\"\nNo holy power will be used. Vulcanus couldn't help but be impressed by the terms, so he responded in kind.\n-Thwack!\nThe armor comes apart at the seams. With each peel, the falling armor shattered the arena floor.\nSoon, all the armor is off, revealing the most perfect body the world has ever seen.\nRugged, sculpted muscles are finely balanced and lined with veins that look as strong as steel.\nMuscles as dull as armor, as if the blade of any great sword would break them.\nVulcanus, the great man who led a million barbarians, sent a ferocious gaze toward Leon.\n\"GRARARARA do you think you can defeat me with your bare body?\"\n\"Wasn't that what you said when you lost to this king for the eighth time? If it weren't for my holy powers, you would have won.\"\nVulcanus chuckled at Leon's reminder of the past.\n\"Today will be your day. The last one to win is the one who really wins.\"\n-Bam!\nThe next moment, Leon's sword struck Vulcanus.\nThe wind pressure alone was enough to shake the stadium but the recipient of the blow is not even broken.\n\"I'm getting old, I'm not as good as I used to be.\"\n\"You've been frozen for over a hundred years, and you haven't bothered to retrain?\"\n\"I haven't aged at all!\"\nVulcanus pushes Leon away with the force of his hand on the hilt of his sword. Even Leon is outmatched by Vulcanus in pure strength.\n\"Looks like you've got a bit of a back, but here's your staff, old man!\"\nVulcanus throws one of his two holy swords at Leon, like a boomerang, but its impact is profound.\n-Ka-la-la-la-la!!!\nThe holy sword is thrown with pure power, slicing through the surrounding area in a gust of wind but Leon skillfully grasps the hilt as it rushes toward him.\nThe thought of catching a projectile traveling at supersonic speeds with his bare hands was a testament to Leon's vision and skill.\n\"I give it back.\"\nLeon's throw was more refined and accurate than Vulcanus'.\nBy nature, knights were considered a disgrace to use ranged weapons.\nIt's easy to say that throwing with your full strength is a ranged attack' and not a ranged weapon', but the difference is crucial.\nAn arrow that is drawn with a maximum force of 100 and a blade that is thrown with a maximum force of 10,000 are both ranged attacks that cannot be compared to a \"ranged weapon\" in terms of power or range.\n-Boom!\nSo fast that the sound doesn't even catch up to the projectile. In response, Vulcanus raised his sword and took no defensive stance.\n\"Huh!\"\nHe simply sucked in a breath,\n\"!!!\"\nand spit it out with all his might.\n-Kaahhhh?!\nThe explosive volume of the monster's voice bends even space.\nA holy sword thrown with superhuman strength bends before the space-bending beast.\n-What, what, what is that?!\n-He changed the trajectory of a projectile with his voice?!\n-Is that a person?!\nLeon has to force himself to change the way he smiles, because Vulcanus' voice is that of a monster.\nVulcanus is a creature of the ages, instinctively bending the natural order of the world to his will and before he became a Holy Knight, he had the most famous infamy of all.\nThe most powerful creature on earth, a freak of the ages that the Lionheart King had failed to kill thirteen times despite his sincere attempts.\n\"gra-rarara!\"\nWith a laugh that echoed throughout the stadium, Vulcanus' greatsword struck down.\nThe two locked eyes in a sword wrestling match of iron on iron. Vulcanus takes this moment to ask a question.\n\"I don't understand you!\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"The way you express yourself! Just go ahead and say I love you! I care about you! I'm sorry for what I did! This is not how it should be!\"\n\" It's not that simple. It's more complicated than you think.\"\nVulcanus stretched out his arms. They both know where that touch went.\n-Boom!\nThe next moment, his greatsword, the one Vulcanus had knocked away, was back.\n\"How about two!\"\nIn the midst of the struggle, he brings his second greatsword down. The heavy impact sent ripples through the air and crushed the floor where Leon had stepped.\n\"It doesn't matter how complicated the knot is, just cut it off with a single swipe! There's always a simple way to solve a situation!\"\n\"You're such a! I wish I could live in peace!\"\nCrushed by Vulcanus' strength, Leon skillfully slashed his sword across Vulcanus' thigh.\n-Boom!\nIt felt like he had sliced through steel, but it was effective as blood gushed from his thigh.\n\"You still rely on your strength, my lord, and your lower body is still weak, as I pointed out when I taught you swordsmanship.\"\n\"Gah! I am still weak, and it is all due to lack of strength, so let me find my way back.\"\n\"I see you have a bone to pick.\"\n\"How can he who rides in a straight line when he breaks the armies of the barbarians and the hordes of the orcs, return to his domestic duties?\"\nAs a father-in-law, dismissing potential sons-in-law might seem like an extension of a father with a daughter but Vulcanus knows better.\nLeon is an authority figure capable of unreason, but he is also the most reasonable of Lionhearts.\nHe has not executed Vulcanus, the leader of the barbarians, but has made a rational choice against all odds.\nI don't want to lose someone so pure and talented.\nVulcanus' greatsword strikes like a fury and despite his dull appearance, speed comes from strength.\nVulcanus' dual wielding is a storm that never stops. Even his tireless body of perfect vitality keeps the storm from abating.\n\"Whoa\"\nLeon blocks it with little more than a sigh, sometimes parrying, sometimes deflecting, sometimes countering and then he answers Vulcanus' question.\n\"This king is a failed father. He made a decision as king, and if he had to do it again, he would make the same choice.\"\nBut being right is not the same as being correct. Being right doesn't mean the other choice is wrong.\nIn the moment of choice, Leon chose his duty, against all odds.\n\"The burden of being king is right. A man who bears such a heavy responsibility on behalf of the gods cannot make a wrong choice.\"\n\"But even so, the burden is not right. It is a failure.\"\n\"Even if the child understood, even if I told her it was the right choice, I would still be a failed father.\"\nLeon made the right choice. It was the right thing to do to save his country, and no one could fault him for it.\nBut as a result, his wife is dead, and the grand duchy he was supposed to protect was destroyed.\nLeon had merely protected something greater.\n\"How can a man with such a burden boldly speak of his love in front of the child?\"\nTherefore, his seemingly selfish interference in the courtship duel only narrows his daughter's options.\nHe was forcing her to make a choice that is only for herself.\nThey say a daughter takes after her father, but how disingenuous of them both.\nThis is not the only suggestion Karina brought to Vulcanus.\nVulcanus pushed her the same way he did Leon, and she sees a glimmer of sincerity in her old friend.\nHearing both sides of the argument, Vulcanus thought to himself.\nMrs. Castile, I suffer here amongst these fools!\nVulcanus missed Leons wife, who had been acting as a catalyst between them.",

      "content": "Chapter 195:\nThe duel between Leon and Vulcanus is not over after a day and a night of fighting.\nThe stadium is cracked and splintered, and not even the stands are safe. By the second day, most of the spectators had been evacuated to avoid being killed by flying stadium debris.\nOnly the strongest remained in the stadium to avoid being killed by the flying debris in the aftermath of the battle, and\nAnd so, on the third day.\nVulcanus crossed the line.\n\"Aaahhhhhhh!\n[Ugh, Vulcanus, you bastard! No way!!!]\nDivine Descent <God of War>\nDespite Petos' protests, Vulcanus canceled the long-overdue savings account.\n[No, no, no, no, no!!!]\nDespite Petos' cries, the Holy Knight's flames grew stronger.\nOf course, there are exceptions. He'll limit the use of holy power to single strikes.\nWith this holy sword, it's a one-hit wonder, and its power reaches the peak of the holy sword's brilliance. But\n\"You used it first.\"\nIn the heat of the duel, Vulcanus hadn't thought about it. If he is a Holy Knight, a representative of the God of War, then\n<Sword of Radiance>\nLeon was the representative of all gods.\n\"Hmm Why don't we call it off for a while and come to our senses? I've been thinking about it, and I don't think it's a good idea to waste the power of the gods like this\"\n\"I like that kind of shamelessness in you, my lord, but not now.\"\n\"\"\nIf there was a true loser in this duel, it would be Petos, who had blown half of the holy power he had accumulated through months of events such as the Holy Spirit Prayer Ceremony.\nAnd so Vulcanus fell.\nThe suitors stopped coming.\n-How the hell am I supposed to defeat such a monster?\n-Ah, this quest is doomed.\nLeon was a wall that could never be crossed, and while he still had over fifty suitors to defeat, there were none left to challenge him.\n\"Hmm.\"\n\"Your Majesty, you seem satisfied.\"\nBeatrice noticed that after three days without a challenger, Leon's expression was more satisfied than ever.\n\"How peaceful the king's garden is now that the bandits are gone.\"\n\"Though it is said that you are a bit hesitant.\"\n\"Well, one who is king should not be concerned with the reputation of those below.\"\nThat may be the attitude of royalty, but is it royalty to interfere with your daughter's marriage?\nOf course, Beatrice knew Leon's reasons for doing this.\n\"Are you sure your daughter will do as your Majesty wishes?\"\n\"I hope so.\"\nClumsy.\nWhen she had first heard Leon's self-deprecation, Beatrice had been surprised to realize that this perfect man had an ordinary flaw.\nJust as Vulcanus had come up with a rather frivolous phrase, Beatrice admitted to laughing at Leon's behavior.\nBut what came next was pity.\nHe was a guilty father, unable or unwilling to deny his own choices, beating himself up over them.\nHe thwarts his daughter's plans and uses his authority to dictate her choices.\nWhat a clumsy father.\nHe was a perfect knight, a great king, and a beloved seeker of the gods but even such a perfect demigod reveals his clumsiness in such an awkward and embarrassing way.\nHe only knows it's for the best.\n\"It's not going to happen the way you think it should.\"\n\"No, it must be this kings will. It's what's best for her.\"\nShe didn't know what Karina Dragonia would think of that.\n* * * *\nIt had been four days since the suitor's challenge had ceased, and it was approaching twenty days since Ha-ri had been dropped off at the Imperial Palace.\nThe words she had learned as a young woman from historical dramas brought a modest smile to the faces of her superiors.\n\"So, have you eaten?\"\n\"Your Majesty, I was waiting for you.\"\nKarina found it unusual that Ha-ri had no fear or dread of her, even when she was being hard on her.\nShe had dragon blood in her veins and the heart of a dragon in her bloodline.\nThe stronger the power, the stronger the blood' that radiates from it, causing creatures to have an instinctive fear of it.\nIt was fine when she was in Lionheart.\nNo one had carried the dragon's heart as long as she had, but each of Lionheart's citizens had the power to resist the dragon's blood because of their faith.\nBelieving that the gods would provide for them as they deserved was the most powerful force to overcome the dragon curse.\nAnd in this world, where the authority of the gods did not exist, she saw criminals who had to accept their existence as raw.\nThe unity and surprise of the Seven Kingdoms was born out of that fear.\nIn that sense, Ha-ri, a woman who finds herself challenged but not afraid, is a welcome addition to Karina's ranks.\n\"Well, Your Majesty. I hear that no new suitors have shown up today.\"\n\"Indeed.\"\nKarina sighed softly. It was not unexpected since Vulcanus had been defeated.\n\"If it had been a physical fight, I would have had something to say about it, but it was a holy one, so it is what it is.\"\n\"Boo, how much holy power did Lord Vulcanus use?\"\n\"Young one, Lord Vulcanus' opponent is the Lionheart King.\"\n\"That's right ahaha.\"\nVulcanus' talent and vessel could be said to be a freak of the era.\nHowever, his opponent is also the strongest Lionheart King in history. In a purely holy battle, Vulcanus, who represents only one god, would not be able to defeat the agent of all gods.\n\"If it were a purely physical contest, I would have expected him to have pushed the Lionheart King.\"\nVulcanus is one of the strongest creatures on earth, and Leon is a natural fighter who embodies hundreds of years of warfare.\nLeon knocked Vulcanus down thirteen times and let him go thirteen times, and in that last fight, the two fought day and night for a week.\nHe must not have fought sincerely.'\nIf Vulcanus was truly serious, he would not have been subdued by Leon so quickly.\nLeon's interference in narrowing her options aside, Karina laughed bitterly.\n\"Well, I'd rather talk about your world.\"\nThe reason Karina keeps Ha-ri close to her in the palace isn't just because she's immune to the influence of her aura.\nShe was also an important source of information about the other world connected to her empire.\nKnowing about them is something the Imperial Emperor needs, no matter how she deals with them in the future.\n\"Our world is being invaded by demons, connected to many worlds, and there-\"\nHa-ri unpacked the sack of stories Karina wanted to hear.\n\"In your world, iron horses and birds carry people around.\"\n\"They're called cars and airplanes.\"\n\"Yes, I can see that you are a very advanced civilization.\"\nEmperor Karina was happy to hear about Earth and Ha-ri did her best to impress her, who listened with interest.\nHow Leon had come from a Black Gate, how the TTG Temple had been built and so many other things that had happened.\nI wish I could be close to His Majesty again.\nAs one who had seen the end of the Lionheart Kingdom, it was a wish that would never be fulfilled, as Leon fought so long and so lonely against the demons.\n\"And by the way, is Your Majesty's world free of demons now?\"\n\"They still try to cross over from time to time, but there have been fewer of them lately, and even then they are dealt with before they can cross the gate.\"\n\"Ahthen that.\"\nAs the Hunters crossed the gate, they looked surprised as they realized that the gate phenomenon they had encountered had been caused by Karina's intervention.\n\"I, uh, thought a dragon did that uh, how?\"\nIf there was a power that could intervene in the passage of a gate, wouldn't it be easy to win the war against demons?\n\"It is the power of the dragon. I've set up several traps in the subspace between this world and the others using dragon magic. It's nothing to be overconfident about, but it's enough to make them lose if you try to rush in.\"\nThat alone was enough to change the course of a war. To which Karina added that it was a burden whenever she used it.\n\"Burden?\"\nHa-ri's question made Karina look surprised.\n\"You, who inherited the heart of the first Grand Duchess of Leona, don't know the history of the Grand Duke of Dragonia?\"\n\"Ah well, that's.\"\nOf course, as an Earthling, Ha-ri's knowledge of Lionheart's history and story is limited to what Leon tells her.\nLeon is also in charge of theological education, but there aren't many stories that are only told by one person. For now, Leon's focus is on combat training, not history.\n\"It's an old story.\"\nIn a distant age, it was the age of dragons, not gods.\nA time of darkness, when humans were nothing more than dragon prey, when civilization was barely a thing, and when the gods themselves could not find enough followers to believe in them.\nThree heroes were chosen by the gods.\n\"One of them was Archduke Zeke. He is known for many heroic deeds, but his most famous is his defeat of the dragon king Dragonia. He slayed an evil dragon andwell, let's just say he was rowdy.\"\n\"Your Majesty?\"\n\"Yes. It's one of the dragon's tricks.\"\nKarina stuttered and demanded more of Ha-ri's stories, which had been quite a journey, but after another couple of hours, it finally came.\n\"Your Majesty, I watched the final battle of the Lionheart Kingdom.\"\n\"\"\nKarina did not see the fall of Lionheart since she was swept into this world in the midst of her battle with a Demon Archduke.\n\"His Majesty must have resented me greatly.\"\nIn that battle, Karina led 30,000 Northern troops to break away from the Alliance.\nWith the end of the world already assured, she marched north, leading the avengers of Ventasis, sworn to vengeance.\nIt was a choice that spoke to the North's desire for vengeance, but it was also a harsh choice by a daughter who had betrayed the Alliance and betrayed her father.\n[Do as you will, Archduke of Dragonia! I don't want to see you! Disappear before this kings eyes!]\nThe last words she heard from her father. Even though she knew it was the last time, Karina led her army and abandoned Leon.\nNaturally, she expected Leon to blame her.\n\"He doesn't!\"\nBut Ha-ri's answer was different. She said what she saw.\n\"His Majesty was always thinking of you and he was sorryhe missed you.\"\nWhen Leon heard of the kingdom's demise from his friends from the future, he was not discouraged.\nHe was willing to make way for the future, and in the process, he was reunited with Karina.\nHa-ri was sure that Leon would have been pleased to see her and be happy for her.\n\"I know.\"\nKarina knew it was true when the usually coy Ha-ri spoke with such determination.\nIt was comforting, if only a little.\n\"How did it go, Lionheart?\"\n\"He fought to the last man.\"\nHe won in the end, and now he was here.\n\"I see.\"\nKarina looked bitter and said nothing more. Then Poma interjected.\n[Do you have any intention of going back?]\n\"To where?\"\n[To a home that will embrace you as you deserve.]\nKarina's homeland was not a name or a country.\n\"It's too late, I've been away too long.\"\n[How long?]\n\"A few more years, if I'm lucky.\"\n\"Your Majesty, Poma, what are you both talking about?\"\nHa-ri couldn't keep up with the story, so Karina clicked her tongue and scolded Poma.\n\"You should take care of the education of the new maiden.\"\n[This is not a time of peace.]\nHa-ri couldn't understand what she was saying at first, so she inferred the context. A few years'. That was the easiest word to infer\n\"Are you dying, are you on your deathbed?!\"\n\"Well, something like that. Better to see it once than to say it a hundred times.\"\nKarina began to unbutton her robe. The emperor's robes fell to the floor with a clatter, but Ha-ri didn't bother to look away.\nThe sheer power was overwhelming. An aura so powerful it made her skin crawl and made her shiver.\n\"Ugh!\"\nHa-ri gulped as he saw Karina's fully exposed upper body.\nThe heart. A throbbing aura pulsated around her left breast, and the skin around it was covered with steel-like scales.\n* * * *\nIt is said to be a dragon curse that has been passed down from generation to generation in the Grand Duchy of Dragonia.\nThe Grand Duchess of Dragonia was bathed in the blood of the ancestral dragon, Dragonia, and used its heart as the essence of her power, but the more she used it, the more she was consumed by the dragon curse.\nKarina has been Archduchess of Dragonia for well over two hundred years now. She had been carrying the dragon's heart for far too long when she should have been able to give birth to a child and pass it on.\n\"Your Majesty, then Your MajestyHis Majesty the Lionheart King knew that!\"\nShe must give birth to an heir. Only then can Karina live. Knowing that, why would Leon interrupt Karina's soul duel?\n\"Well, follow me. I have something to show you.\"\nKarina smiled wryly and headed off into the distance.\nInside the palace, servants and maids bow, soldiers salute.\nNo one dared to question or interrupt her progress.\n\"Do you know that dragons build nests and hoard gold and silver treasures?\"\n\"Do they?\"\nHa-ri had seen many monsters, but never a dragon.\n\"They are greedy by nature and love to glitter. They have a habit of collecting and hoarding all the gold and jewelry in the world as if it were their own.\"\nThat's what we call dragon rarities,' Karina said.\n\"Same goes for me. At some point, I became obsessed with gold and silver treasures.\"\n\"\"\nHa-ri was at a loss for words as the radiance' grew closer with each step and a path of pure white marble led to a palace clad in gold.\nFrom the columns to the roof, there was nothing that wasn't ornate, and it looked like the golden palaces of legend.\n-Gulp!\nShe swallows hard, overwhelmed by the exterior, Ha-ri is greeted by a giant door that looks like it could fit a giant.\nWhen Karina opened it herself, Ha-ri stepped forward out of habit.\n\"I, I'll open it for you!\"\nThe younger one takes care of the older one. It was something she'd learned to do while serving Leon. But despite the gesture, the iron gate that Ha-ri touched refused to budge.\n\"What? Why, why won't it open?\"\nThe iron gate wouldn't budge, even with the strength of an S-class Hunter and Ha-ri wondered if there was some sort of lock, but when Karina touched it, the door gradually began to open.\n\"Huh? What, is there some kind of magical device?\"\nHa-ri wondered if there was some sort of magic that could identify the user, like fingerprinting, but Karina's answer was simple.\n\"No, it's just the world's heaviest iron door, and the only person in the world that can push it open and close is me.\"\n\"\"\nThe world's heaviest iron door and an iron door that can only be opened with the power Karina.\nWhat kind of treasure could such a thing be made to hold?\nHa-ri soon opened the door and realized what it meant.\nIt was a gigantic palace the size of a soccer stadium on modern Earth and inside it was\n\"Huh!\"\nMountains of gold and silver treasures.\nThere was no word to describe it other than piles.\n[Did you come?]\nAnd amidst the splendor of the gold and silver treasures, a dark aura took shape that seemed so out of place.\nShe could not name the ominous being, but Karina knew it.\n[My avenger, I have come to collect the price you owe.]\nVentasis, of darkness and vengeance, has come for his Holy Knight.",

      "content": "Chapter 196:\n[Darkness. Were you there?]\nThe first to recognize Ventasis' presence was fellow deity Poma.\nHe's been gone since day one, but he's surprised to see Ventasis here, who hasn't been seen in spirit.\n[Have you been here all along? I didn't think you were interested in gold.]\n[Gold means nothing to me, for all I seek are spirits to claim my rights.]\n[]\nVentasis, God of Darkness and Vengeance divinity was unlike any other, granting mercy, love, and compassion.\nHe was a deity who could be considered evil if he treaded on the wrong foot, a shadowy presence in the world whose concept of darkness is the antithesis of light.\nHe does not sing of chivalry and justice. He affirms the dark side of mortals and the vengeance of blood.\nAs such, he is a somewhat marginalized deity in the pantheon. However, his following is steady.\n[Karina Dragonia, you swore vengeance and promised me the reward I deserved. Since you borrowed my power to achieve it, it is time to pay the price.]\nAll manner of dark emotions flocked to the one who seemed to embody the darkness of the world.\nViolence, murder, and injustice. Many avengers swear vengeance on the dark god, and gain the power they need to do so.\n[You owe me.]\nTwo hundred years ago, after losing their home to demons, the Archduke of Dragonia and his legions swore vengeance on the Dark One.\nIt was an oath so soul-destroying that not even the Lionheart King could dissuade them from it, and they pursued their enemies into the Otherworld to exact their revenge.\nNow the time has come to pay the price, the Dark One said.\n[But, Darkness, the last Northern soldier to die, let alone Archduke Karina, was well over a hundred years ago.]\nSouls not favored by the gods wander the netherworlds, reincarnating over and over again. For the past two hundred years, the gods have not accepted any new souls.\nOnly recently have they gained faith on Earth, recreating the system of Paradise. This other world is beyond their reach.\nEven if Ventasis were to come and retrieve them, their souls would be long since scattered.\nIn the end, the only person Ventasis can claim an old debt from is Karina, who is still alive\n\"Dark God, as you already know, the mortgaged souls are still in my hands.\"\nAt those words, Poma's tortoise eyes turned to Karina. He muttered something about how it couldn't be, but she walked past the mountain of gold and silver treasures without a word.\nAs Ha-ri followed Karina past the mountain of gold and jewelry that made her dizzy just looking at it, her eyes darted around, and Poma warned her.\n[Beware of the gold curse, Ha-ri, these are no mere gold and silver treasures.]\n\"What, what do you mean?\"\n[Dragon's gold invites insatiable greed, leads to violence and plunder. Stay awake, this is such a demonic place.]\nHa-ri pursed her lips and followed Karina, not quite understanding Poma's warning, but knowing enough to be wary.\nAfter passing by the dizzying array of gold and silver treasures, they reached the depths of the vault.\nOne would think that the deeper the vault, the more precious the gems and treasures, but at the end of it all were neatly organized shelves and stones on silk cushions.\nLike a shrine, each of these precious stones has a plaque with its own name.\n\"Delvoske.\"\n\"Gaspar\n\"Jurahan\n\"Ruina.\"\nThe shapes of the stones were so familiar that Ha-ri recognized them at once.\n\"Magic stones?!\"\nA special stone that can be obtained by defeating monsters at the gate that no Hunter could fail to recognize.\n\"Magic Stone\"\nEver since the Jeju Island Gate, where Georgic and the Knights of the Lavonian Dawn encountered it, it's been common knowledge that it crystallizes the souls of living creatures.\n\"Uh, why are there magic stones here?\"\n\"I guess that's what they call them in your world, huh?\"\nKarina picked up one of the stones, each labeled with a nameplate.\n\"They're called middle stones, at least that's what I call them. The place they pass through before going to paradise.\"\nWith that, Ha-ri realized the story behind the stones.\nIn the world of Lionheart, when people die, they are reincarnated or admitted to the paradise of the gods, the religious equivalent of heaven and the final destination for all believers.\nBut what happens to their souls when they die here, in this other world, beyond the reach of the gods' authority?\nIt was something that Karina could not let go of.\nIn other words the crystals containing the souls of each and every one of the Northern soldiers who crossed over to the Otherworld with Archduke Karina lay in the treasury.\n\"These are the men who followed me, who traveled with me to the Other Side. I, Karina Dragonia, am obligated to see to their peaceful end.\"\n[But how to do that]\nThe souls are molded into stone. It is a technique unknown even to the gods. For the gods who guide the souls of the dead to the afterlife in the first place, forcing a soul to take up residence in stone is akin to blasphemy.\nOnly demons use such methods.\nKarina's use of this method is\n[It makes no difference; they are my avengers, too. You, Karina Dragonia, may carry your father's halo, but they are not.]\nThey are the souls that will rightfully belong to me, Ventasis said.\nAt that moment.\n[No, you are one step too late.]\nA great darkness loomed around Karina's shadow. It was huge enough to hold a treasure trove of gold, and even the gods had to look up at its shadow.\n[Dragonia.]\nDragonia, the Ancestral Dragon.\nThe dragon's mind, unchanged by the millennia, is something transcendent.\nEven the Gods struggled before this ancient dragon king. This arrogant being, who thought himself greater than the gods, had earned it.\n[You're late, gods, descendants of the Dragon Slayer, you're too late.]\nThe Dragon King's gaze fell upon the gods.\n* * * * *\nThe Hunters and the Knights of the TTG Temple have come to the arena to watch the duel resume after four days with a new challenger.\nVulcanus had already been defeated, and the large man who had challenged Leon, whoever he was, had come as a matter of duty, not to waste time.\n\"What is the king thinking?\"\nIt was Soo-ho who spoke up while waiting for the match while Jae-hyuk responded with a question.\n\"What?\"\n\"In order to solve the problem of the dragon curse, Karina must give birth to a child to inherit the dragon's heart.\"\nKarina had already told the Knights of the Burning Sword and others.\nThe dragon blood and heart of the first archduke who slayed the Ancestral Dragon also carried the curse of the Ancestral Dragon.\nIt has given each successive Archduke immense power, but it has also produced a side effect: dragonization.\nDragonization: simply put, to become a dragon.\nDragonia was the greatest and most enormous dragon of all, his flesh could reach out and grasp volcanoes, and the breath from his nape was said to have scorched continents.\nThe size of the dragon king's soul was beyond the power of even the gods to control, and they could only slow the symptoms, not stop them.\n\"Karina has been implanted with the dragon's heart for so long that she must urgently find a successor, right?\"\n\"Indeed.\"\n\"Then why is His Majesty interfering with his daughter's marriage? It's a bit much for a father to prevent his daughter from marrying.\"\nAt that, Jae-hyuk agreed. He felt that Leon's behavior had always been out of the ordinary and his values different from those of modern Earthlings.\nHis viciousness in protecting his daughter from the thieves who wanted to steal her.\n\"Yes. Even for His Majesty, this is a bit odd.\"\nKarina's dragon curse was so public that anyone from Lionheart, including the Knights of the Burning Sword, knew about it.\nIt was nothing new for the Grand Duchess of Dragonia to delay and then reset the process through succession.\nLeon's actions in turning away the suitors as he did now were not only a hindrance to the quest, but a threat to Karina's life.\n\"His Majesty doesn't know that.\"\n\"Hmph!\"\n\"My queen?!\"\nBeatrice, who was sitting in the audience as usual with Yappy and Chun So-yeon, interrupted their conversation.\n\"As the two of you suspected, His Majesty is intentionally sabotaging Archduke Karina's succession.\"\nHonestly, it's hard to sympathize with a father with a daughter. But when your daughter's life is on the line, even the most selfish of fathers will have no choice.\n\"Then why is His Majesty interfering with Karina's marriage?\"\n\"Purely as a father, he expects to see the love that shines like a star' that he envisions.\"\n\"Love that shines like a star'?\"\n\"His Majesty is quite the romantic.\"\nBeatrice smiled bitterly, remembering Leon's tendencies.\nA romantic, for a man who was so bossy, authoritarian, and selfish when it came to matters of love. Even the Goddess of the Moon and Chastity could not help but forgive the Lionheart King in the end.\nThat makes him a very difficult character to get to know, but it's clear from the outset that Leon wants love to be part of Karina's marriage.\nHe doesn't want his daughter's marriage and the process of having children to be one of promiscuity and manipulation.\nThat's a very un-royal valuethat he's a romantic.\n\"And another thing. His Majesty wants the dragon's heart back.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Is that possible?\"\nAt this unexpected turn of events, the two men shared a puzzled look.\n\"In essence, the Dragon's Heart was held by His Majesty, the former Grand Duke, so it's not impossible, and His Majesty is\"\n[Today, a new challenge has been issued to the invincible champion, who will challenge the Lionheart King !!!]\nAt that moment, Leon entered the dueling arena, and the whole place erupted.\n* * * * *\n\"I will take back the dragon's heart from Karina.\"\n[]\nThe gods were silent for a moment at Leon's declaration for they guessed what it meant, and why Leon had made such a choice.\n[Can't you wait until you have children to succeed to the throne?]\n\"Karina bore the dragon heart for two hundred years.\"\nThe implication is simple: the dragonization may have gone too far. Even if Karina is the Holy Knight of Ventasis, this is far beyond the average Archduke dragonheart implantation period.\n\"Even if she does produce an heir, I doubt Karina will be able to survive until that heir reaches maturity.\"\n[So you're saying you'll have the dragon's heart until then?]\n\"Exactly.\"\nAt those words, Arianna said in a worried voice.\n[It is a dragon's heart that has accumulated curses for two hundred years, and even you cannot be free from its curse.]\n\"However, only I can bear the curse.\"\nLeon is the Lionheart King, a living demigod who is immune to all curses. He believes he can withstand even the two-hundred-year-old curse of the ancestral dragon Dragonia.\nThis is the choice Leon forces upon Karina: to pass on the curse that consumes her to her father.\n[Truly, you are a clumsy family, thinking of each other and yet this is the only way to deal with it]\n\"Because Im her father, even Castile would have done it.\"\nLeon waited for a new challenger, confident that this duel would end in Karina's defeat.\nThey say no parent ever wins, but there is a parent everywhere who will sacrifice themselves for their child.\nIt is this natural love that he hopes Karina will accept. It was the best Leon could do as a father.\nBut\n\"Your interference ends today.\"\nIt was Karina who stood before the strongest champion whose victory was assured.\n[Leon, my avenger, we are too late.]\nAnd back in the Pantheon, the dark god announced his failure with a self-deprecating sigh. The news he delivered was enough to make even the gods swallow hard.\n[Karina Dragonia has already surrendered her body and soul to Dragonia.]\nTo save the souls of the 30,000 Northerners who had followed her Karina had made a deal with the dragon.",

      "content": "Chapter 197:\nThe connection to the gods is broken.\nIt was the first thing the Northern Army recognized upon arriving in this world.\n\"Your Highness, my connection to the gods has been lost\"\n\"I can still use some of the holy arts, but it depends on what's left in my body.\"\nThe people of Lionheart, the knights, have been serving the gods and enjoying their miracles since time immemorial.\nNo one could have imagined the loss they felt when they realized their connection to the gods had been severed.\nEven Karina, for now, could not hide her sense of loss at the lack of divinity. The gods-\n\"Do not lose sight of what we must do. We have pursued them all the way here for vengeance.\"\nKarina scattered darkness to envelop them with her vast power. Her vessel, as a Holy Knight, still contained an overflow of power.\nI don't know if it will last long enough to defeat the demons, or the Archduke of Lust, but\n[Yes, the hedge of holy power that protected you is gone, the last remnants of it dissipating.]\nThis was not lost on the Dragon King, who had been stirring in the heart of the Grand Dukes for a very long time.\n* * * * *\n[Crunch!]\nThe battle against Archduke Kangyou and his legions was a desperate one, but it ended in victory for Karina and her legions.\n\"Grand Duchess Karina has slit the throat of Archduke Kangyou!\"\n\"Victory! Victory to the Lionhearts of Dragonia!!!\"\n\"Glory to Ventasis!!!\"\nThough it took many sacrifices, we were able to annihilate the Archduke of Lust and his legions. Hereby.\n\"Your Excellency, the Empress will be pleased!\"\nDelvoske, the Grand Duchess longtime butler, prostrated himself before Karina, tears streaming down his face.\nThe Great War against the Demons had cost them many loved ones.\nCountless knights have died at the hands of Malus, the Chaos Lord summoned by the Emperor of the Empire after sacrificing three million of his subjects, and entire continents have been ravaged by demonic overlords such as the Archduke of Lust, the Archduke of Corruption, the Archduke of Slaughter, the Archduke of Sloth, and the Archduke of Wisdom.\nAfter so many deaths, she finally succeeded in getting her revenge.\n\"Now I must find a way to return to Lionheart\"\nWhat happened to the Lionheart King, what happened to her father, and did the kingdom eventually fall?\nIt's not that they don't know what happened after they left, which is why they abandoned the Alliance and traveled to the Otherworld to fight the Great Battle.\nIf Lionheart has already been destroyed by the demons\nThe next vengeance is only beginning.\nOn that day, the day they vowed to give their souls to Ventasis, all the Northern armies swore to burn themselves in the fire of vengeance to destroy evil, down to the last man.\n\"Gather the troops. Find a way home.\"\nAfter a long day of fighting, fatigue set in. I'll rest for a while, then return to Lionheart.\n-Waaaahhhhhhhh!\nAt that time the patrols reported that enemy forces appeared from behind.\n\"Your Excellency, we're under attack!\"\n\"Is it the remnants of the demons?\"\n\"No. They are the flags of the Seven Kingdoms! They have betrayed us!\"\n\"\"\nImmediately after destroying the Demon Archduke's legions, the seven kingdoms of this world betrayed Karina and the Northern Army in unison.\nSurprisingly, the Northern Army was unconcerned by this betrayal, for to them, the honor of a nobleman and the integrity of a king was a matter of course.\nIt's not that they ignored the possibility of treachery per se. They just didn't expect it to happen, and they didn't expect it to be so united.\nThose who have lived their lives in faith, honor, and integrity are, in a sense, hothouse plants.\n-Lord Gaspar!\n-Protect the Archduke!\nOne by one they fall.\nExhausted from the clash with the Demon Legions, the Northern Army slowly crumbled before the 850,000-strong army.\nKarina had used up all of the holy power she had left after moving to the Otherworld.\nThe only thing keeping her alive is a powerful artifact called the Dragon's Heart, which generates its own magic.\nIt's dangerous. If I keep using dragon power like this, I'm going to die\nShe was already using the Dragon's Heart well beyond its optimal maintenance period. It is also a period that takes into account the purification effect caused by holy power.\nHowever, her holy power was already depleted, and she had nothing but overflowing dragon magic. If she continued like this, she would inevitably become a dragon.\nBut\n\"I'll take the lead. Cover me.\"\n\"Your Excellency!?\"\nKarina hesitated, then abused her vast magical power instead of her holy power. Enemies who met her gaze died instantly, and the energy in her sword swept through the troops.\nShe had only used the overflowing power of the Dragon's Heart, and yet the battlefield was being overwhelmed by her.\nHow could she not use it, for every time she pushed, hundreds of Northerners were spared.\nI must send them back. To their homeland!\nThat is my duty as Archduke of Dragonia, to represent the North. One must be willing to lay down his life for the knighted, the noble, and the free people of this world.\nBut\nThe Northern army is dwindling, and the Alliance is closing in on them in overwhelming numbers.\nThere were too many enemies for one man to turn the tide.\n\"It is over, otherworldly invaders.\"\n\"You infidels will all die here.\"\nAnd so it came to pass, with only an angelic hundred Northerners remaining. Delvoske, who stood by Karina's side until the very end, spoke up.\n\"Your Excellency, we'll buy you some time, if you'll just get out of here.\"\n\"\"\nKarina watched the line crumble wordlessly.\nShould she have seen this?\nTo be the one to lead them all, and to see herself fail in the end.\nIt would be sad, surely.\nIt must be gnashing of teeth, anguish, and gut-wrenching pain.\nHow could she bear the pain of seeing her trusted followers fall one by one?\n\"Do not forgive me.\"\nKarina said, remembering her father, so far away, so different from the world she now lived in.\n\"I will give you my flesh and soul, Dragonia.\"\nThat day Grand Duchess Karina became Emperor Karina' and the beginning of the Legion of Dragons legend.\nThe founding myth of Dragonia began with the slaughter of 850,000 Seven Kingdoms troops.\nKarina ceased to be the Grand Duchess of Dragonia and became the Emperor of Dragonia.\n* * * *\n\"The deal is already done. I have given my flesh and soul to Dragonia, and in return, Dragonia has processed the souls of the northern army into middle stones.\"\nIn place of the lost paradise, the dragon's magic created a false one, to keep them there until the real paradise would one day be rebuilt.\nThirty thousand people. It was the price Karina had to pay to settle the souls of all the Northern Army in crystal form.\n\"Karina\"\n\"It was a small price to pay, if one person could save thirty thousand.\"\nAnd it's not a sacrifice.\nAs the Grand Duchess of Dragonia, Karina has a responsibility to her 30,000 men.\n\"Your Majesty seems intent on bearing the dragon's curse in my stead, but it is too late.\"\n\"\"\nHis daughter's soul will not be saved and even her body is no longer hers.\nHow was the father supposed to react to those words?\n\"No, it's not too late. It's not too late!\"\nHe denies it. Despite his daughter's testimony and the dragon's sneer, he cannot give up as long as he is her father.\n[Foolish, Lionheart, you already know how reasonable a pact between your kin and me is.]\n\"Shut up!\"\nLeon drew his holy sword. He swung the holy sword relentlessly towards the black aura that was spilling.\n-Kang!\nBut it was his own daughter who blocked the sword. Or, more accurately, the dragon spirit that had taken over his daughter's body.\n\"This bastard! Get the hell out of Karina's body!\"\nThe blue eye transformed into red eyes with torn pupils. Dragonia said.\n[I gave your daughter what she wanted, and she paid the price, it's not something you can reverse.]\n-Thud!\nA mighty blast of dragon magic shot through the sword, knocking Leon back. Even the holy sword couldn't cut through it and it instantly took over the space and formed a magical form.\n-Quack, quack, quack!\nEvery single one of them was instant death magic. Black magic explodes, creating a cloud of dust.\n-Hmph!\nWhite divine water flows out of it. Even in the aftermath of the explosion, the Lionheart King's fierce steed manages to drag his rider out.\n[The bloodline of the Heavenly Horse, you impudent beast.]\nIn an instant, a dense barrage of magical arrows shoots toward Stallion, who tries to close the distance. Each one is high-powered. Even Stellar Iron Armor would melt before this firepower, but\n\"Run, Stallion!\"\nLeon, faced with the ignorant conversationalist, makes an equally impetuous charge. Stallion doesn't hesitate for a moment, running straight through the hail of magic arrows.\n-Kii-ii-ii-i!!!\n[Hmm?]\nAt the moment of the clash, the sound of flesh splitting is not heard, but rather the sound of metal bouncing off metal.\nIn the moment of conflict, the magic arrows deflected off of Stallion's claws without even wounding him.\nStallion, a steed of the Goddesses of Light, given to King Lionheart, the mightiest of chargers. Having served the Lionheart King for hundreds of years in war, this steed can defend against any frontal assault.\nIts power is unstoppable, even against dragon magic.\n[They're still annoyingly powerful.]\nDragonia's vast reserves of magic are so vast that even a fallen dragon's mind can recreate some semblance of its former glory in the flesh of a Holy Knight.\nThe explosion of magic was enough to make all onlookers gasp in horror.\n\"Monster, monster\"\nArchmage Cornwall Ong reacts with fear as he shields the audience from the aftermath of the explosion.\nAs an archmage himself, he understands the horror of the dragon's power.\nIt's a force to be reckoned with.\nIt was a foe of the gods.\nHow can anyone survive in the face of such unbelievable destructive power?\n\"Top left! Swoop!\"\nThe Lion King yanked on the reins as the divine beast springs into action without even a fraction of a second's delay at his rider's command.\nThe genius of Leon, who utilizes advanced horsemanship and absurd amounts of holy power to complete his kills.\nHe relies on his resistance to break through attacks from the front, and dodges attacks from the flanks and the air with breathtaking range.\nAs Leon continues to charge and dodge at the same time, his jousting lance slowly becoming more threatening, Dragonia murmurs in annoyance.\n[Then I will crush you with inescapable and overwhelming firepower.]\nA massive magic circle appears behind Karina's back.\nDragon Speech\n[Leon, dodge!]\nA dragon that has lost its body and is left with only its soul recreates its power. Even the gods were intimidated by its eeriness.\n<Dragon Breath>\nA torrent of fire and the wrath of a dragon king that melts everything burns even the flesh of the demigod.\n\"This king is a victor. A knight of the gods who brings victory.\"\n[?!]\nBefore the Dragon King's flames can reach the Lionheart King, Leon's holy spear blocks the flames from the front, and the power at its tip is\nDivine Punishment <Battlefield Flame>\nA war god who controls and focuses all flames everywhere.\n\"This king carries with him hundreds of years of warfare and the favor of all the gods. To face such a king is to face a whole world, old lizard!\"\nThe dragon king's flames do not bounce from the Lionheart king. In fact, the flames are even denser than before, compressed into the tip of the spear.\n[You!]\nDragonia immediately channeled a vast amount of magic power to create a magic shield. In the blink of an eye, the shield seemed to compress an entire castle.\n\"I'll give it back!\"\nThe dragon king unleashed more magic on the dissolving shield. It is a vast, seemingly endless force that can withstand even his own breath.\nBut\nA knight is one who charges.\nOn horseback, full speed, straight and true.\nCharge, charge, charge, as far as their swords and spears can reach.\nHence the knight, the flower of the battlefield, boasts absolute breakthrough power.\n-Kwah!\nAnd this man before him is the pinnacle of all knights, the Knight King.\n?!!\nThe tip of Leon's spear pierces through the cracked magic shield in an instant and reaches Dragonia.\nDragonia blocks it with a sword, but the charge doesn't end with the clash of weapons.\n-Ahem!\nIf the spear fails, the shock of the warhorse is the second blow.\nThe white divine beast unleashed a shock of immense breakthrough power on Dragonia, and Karina's body bounced back with a thud.\n[You!]\nAt that moment, the vast amount of magic power in her body became a shield, absorbing the impact.\nDragonia immediately tried to sweep the rider off his feet with the insolent beast, but her torn pupils couldn't see the rider on the horse.\n[Where?!]\nWith an eerie feeling, she looked up to see the gleaming holy sword still striking down.\n[Thud!]\nDragonia blocked it with animal-like reflexes, but Leon unleashed a wave of light just as the attack was blocked, knocking Dragonia off her feet.\n-Thud!\n-Quang!\nLeon continues to push forward. He skillfully pushed them into close combat.\n\"Even though you're a dragon king, you're just a beast with high firepower. You don't seem to specialize in close combat. Do you think you can handle this king with your sword skills?\"\n[Arrogant!]\nThe dragon furiously swings his sword, but it ends up in vain, allowing Leon to approach.\nLittle by little, little by little until it overwhelms him.\nYou bastard!\nForward.\n\"Bring back my daughter!\"\n\"Fall, dragon king!\"\nLike the man who once challenged him, Zeke the Dragon Slayer, he was just an insignificant mortal in tin can armor.\n\"Fool. A dwarf no bigger than my fingernails, you dare to challenge this dragon king.\"\nFaced with the absolute disparity in power, the man was indomitable.\nShouting the name of a worthless god, he charged forward, and forward, and forward, and forward, until at last\n\"Dragonia!\"\nAhead of him, beyond all odds.\nHe won't stop?\nThree hundred years of human history overwhelms the immortal dragon king.\nIncantation <Death Dragon's Wrath>\nThe terrifying density of magic power turns into an enormous wave of light and engulfs the Lionheart King. But\n<Sword of Extreme Light>\nThe power of the goddess, the lord of all light, is channeled into the holy sword.\nThe holy sword is now the Extreme Light, capable of cutting through even light.\n[I see.]\nIt could not be stopped.\nThe Dragon King, who had taken over the Holy Knight's body where all the power had swept through, fell to the floor of the dueling arena and looked at the holy sword that had burrowed beneath his chin.\n[You are a born warrior. Something immortals like us lack, the history of war itself.]\nAt one point, he scoffed.\nIt was ridiculous.\nHe said it was foolish when the gods declared that mortals would end the Age of Dragons but the age of dragons is over, and it is the gods and their knights who have triumphed.\nThe poison that poisoned the dragons was their arrogance and the indomitability of mortals.\n[Indeed, if you are a fighter, you are better than me.]\n\"Bring Karina back.\"\nThat is why he was foolish.\nHe tried to reverse a bargain that cannot be overturned.\nHe knows it but why does he act like this?\nIt is in their nature to challenge the impossible, but the impossible is impossible because it is impossible in the first place.\nKarina Dragonia sacrificed herself for the souls of 30,000 Northerners, and the price has been paid.\nRegardless, Karina's soul and body will not be spared; her desire to bear children was only to ensure that the Dragonia name would live on before her own existence was extinguished.\nEven then, she seemed to have no other desire than to know that Leon was alive.\n\"Impossible, Your Majesty. I made a reasonable bargain, and it allowed me to fulfill my obligations. Do not make my choice meaningless.\"\n\"Karina!\"\nKarina said, grabbing the hilt of the holy sword pointed at her.\n\"Delvoske and the thirty thousand northerners who followed me, lead their souls to paradise, with that my duty is fulfilled.\"\n\"No! You can't do that! You must bury me, never the other way around!\"\nYou could have made a face like this.\nKarina smiled bitterly as she looked at the Lionheart King, who had always been steadfast and strong.\nHis love, the one thing he was willing to sacrifice to be king. His people. His friends. Even herself.\nShe knew now, having walked the same path.\nOne who bears so much responsibility should not regret it.\nNor can he cry, for he must always appear unwavering to all who watch his back.\nKarina has certainly made the right decision to fulfill her duty.\nStill, she can't help but feel sorry for the father she'll leave behind.\n[Dragonia, enemy of gods.]\nAt that moment, the goddess appeared in the form of a pure white light. Appearing as Leon's halo, Arianna spoke to the dragon king in Karina's heart.\n[A moment ago, Ten Thousand Gods came to an agreement, a proposal made by Darkness.]\nAt those words, everyone focused on the goddess's voice. Instinctively, they knew what was coming next, and how grave it would be.\nThe Goddess spoke.\n[Join the pantheon, Dragonia, we are willing to accept you into our community of destiny.]",

It meant one thing.\nIt meant to recognize Dragonia as one of the faithful, to give him sanctity.\n[Gahahahahahahahahahaha!]\nThe dragon spirit, now a thought, laughs maniacally, and rightly so.\nThe enemies it had fought for so long, the ones that had finally defeated him, had now come to him with a humiliating offer.\nAnd it's all because of a single human.\nThey have come to the unthinkable conclusion that the gods will surrender their divinity to save a mere mortal.\n[Laughs]\nThey would give up their divinity for a mere mortal? Is a mere mortal worth that much?\n[This is not a mere mortal. This is my knight, the honored daughter of the Lionheart King, the Grail Guardian, the representative of divinity.]\n[I know what the Lionheart King means to you. Have you ever offered such convenience to any of his predecessors, not even the first Lionheart King?]\nOf course not.\nThe gods are the guardians of providence. They must adhere to principles, and while they favored and blessed their agents, they never departed from reason.\nThis was even more unconventional than raising the dead in paradise.\n\"Impossible! Impossible!\"\nLeon dropped to both knees, sheathing the sword he had pointed at Dragonia, as if ecstatic to even hear the gods' proposal.\n\"To surrender the seat of exalted divinity for the convenience of a mere mortal, and a vile lizard at that!\"\n[This guy?]\nDragonia bristled at the insult, which was the last thing he wanted to hear, but Arianna persuaded Leon to listen.\n[Leon, my knight, you are not a mere mortal. The gods, the world, all the souls that have accumulated since the beginning of history owe you a debt, and the gods owe you repayment.]\n\"But!\"\n[Say no more, my knight, for the gods' love for you is more than you can imagine. You deserve it.]\n[Ha.]\nThe dragon king was dumbfounded that a human could be so favored by the gods.\nIt was not merely unreasonable, but a surrender of the gods' absolute authority, their divinity, to an enemy they had long sought to destroy.\nDid I mention that he single-handedly destroyed the demons?\nThere were not only feeder demons, but also Lords.\nThe transcendent power of Demon Lords is something the Dragon King knows well. Although they tend to be regarded as being just above the level of an archduke, they are not archdukes'.\nThey were older than the Dragon King himself, and even the gods of the Ten Thousand Gods could not surpass the power of the Demon Lords.\nA being that could defeat such demon lords and save even their afterlife, which should have been destroyed, would be\nThe only hope.\nNo wonder the gods were so desperate.\nThe gods, their temples and their paradise, are sustained by the existence of a single man, Leon.\n[But, arrogant gods, do you think that I, the Dragon King of Drakkara, will sit on the same cushion as you? I am a myth. You are but a second-class citizen.]\n\"How dare you, you lizard, if you receive the offer you kneel down and take it!\"\n[Say one thing for or against.]\nDragonia said something in disbelief, but Leon returned it with a barrage of colorful insults and accusations.\n[Consider our proposal, Dragon King, it is not a bad one, even for you.]\nAfter the dragon king rejected the humiliating proposal, the goddess calmly began to persuade him.\n[Our world has already been destroyed by evil, and we have found a new home, where it is not a far stretch to restore our faith.]\nIn other words, with a spoon, Dragonia could become one of the gods.\nDragonia retorted.\n[I have already established absolute power here. This world is mine.]\nThe Dragonia Empire. The world's only hegemonic power. Karina is the living absolute of that empire.\nI am already in a godlike position, so why should I have to live in a palace beyond my power?\n[You're not a god here, just a parasite attached to the Emperor.]\n[What?]\n[You should know. Why have you spent thousands of years inhabiting the hearts of past archdukes and never been resurrected. It is because you are a being dependent on flesh.]\nGoddess Arianna spoke of the benefits to Dragonia of attaining divinity.\n[If you attain divinity, you will become an object of faith. And the body that will be constructed from the faith gained from worship will be an incarnate one, not a fleshly one that will imprison your soul.]\nIn other words, true immortality. And for this, Arianna emphasizes, Dragonia must be the object of faith, not worship.\n[And most of all]\nArianna delivered the final blow.\n[The resurrection of your race is also possible.]\n[]\nThe most primal power of the gods is the power of creation.\nLight, darkness, sun, moon, sky, sea, flame, life, death, iron, all those primal powers nurture the world and make living things flourish.\n[We will work together. I, Ariannas light, will illuminate the shells of the dragons to be born, and Demera's life will sprout them. The sky, the sea, and the flames will bless them, and the sun and moon will guard their days and nights.]\nAnd they shall be fruitful and multiply, as all living things do.\n[]\nIt reminded him of the responsibilities of a dragon king.\nHe, too, was the king of his race. As long as he claimed to be king, even of the myths themselves, he had responsibilities.\nThe dragon king's anguish did not last long.\n* * * * *\nThe Black Gate in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States of America, has kept the entire country on edge.\nA red gate in the center of the capital is enough to cause chaos, but the appearance of a black gate, the scourge of human history, immediately paralyzes all administrative work in the United States and causes hundreds of thousands of evacuees.\nConsidering that each of the previous Black Gates has either destroyed a nation or brought it to the brink of destruction, these measures are not insufficient.\n\"When the hell are they coming out?\"\nU.S. President Anthony Hopson waited day after day for the Hunters to return from the Black Gate, which had taken over a section of Washington, D.C., and was now in the middle of the city.\nIt's been more than 20 days without anyone coming out of the gate, and it's driving him crazy and jumping up and down, wondering if the raid has failed and the survivors are coming back.\n\"They must have won, right?\"\n\"That's because\"\n\"No, our country's powerful hunters have gone, and the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods has come in full force, so there's no way we can't clear it!\"\nThen why did you ask The aides were dumbfounded by President Hobson's tirade, but they understood his feelings.\nThe social and economic repercussions of a Black Gate dungeon break in the capital could only be described as horrific.\nOn top of that, the Hunters mobilized at this gate represented the best of America's elite forces. Losing them could do more damage than blowing up Washington.\n\"Mr. President, a call from President Ahn of South Korea.\"\nThe hotline set up for this event rings busy. He's probably asking about the status of the Gate, or how the Hunters are doing.\nIt's not just the U.S. that's sending their best hunters and getting shit on.\n\"Fuck, they sent reporters and know everything, what else does he want to know?\nHobson realized that the leaders of these countries had less patience than he thought.\nRight now, even longtime ally Britain was scrambling to figure out how to take responsibility for the loss of its S-class hunters.\nFor President Hobson, who had used the best hunters of his allies to ensure the success of the assault, the failure of this mission would be the end of his political life.\nOf course, the allied administrations that decided to send their best hunters to the United States would also go down with him.\nIn any case, if the raid fails, it won't be over with the deaths of one or two people.\n\"God, watch over America\"\nAs the president prayed to God, several of his aides prayed to the gods of the TTG Temple.\nTo their relief, there hasn't been much movement at the mainland South Korean shrine.\nIf the Lion King had died inside the gate, the feedback would have immediately triggered something in the temple's home country of South Korea.\nNot to mention the fact that South Korean President Ahn Dong-gil has been summoning TTG Temple officials to his office on a daily basis.\nWith the world's eyes on them, it was the 23rd day of the attack on the Black Gate. With a snowy white Christmas predicted, not everyone was in the festive mood.\n\"Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President!\"\nAides rushed to the bleary-eyed President Hobson, who had spent the night without sleeping in the temporary presidential office away from Washington.\n\"At the gate! At the gate, the hunters are returning!\"\n\"All right, let's go!\"\nPresident Hobson straightened his tie and hurried to the military airfield. He wanted to get a handle on the situation as soon as possible.\n* * * * *\n\"There really are beasts of iron running around.\"\nOn a busy street in Washington, D.C. Karina strolls down the street with Leon, marveling.\nThe streets are deserted, filled with tall buildings and shops. Karina wondered how such a busy street could be so deserted.\n\"When the gates appeared, people took refuge in case the monsters inside came out. This gate was the highest ranked of them all, so there shouldn't be anyone around here.\"\n\"Indeed.\"\nNodding in agreement, Karina looked around at the empty storefronts.\n\"Is your body all right?\"\n\"The body of a Holy Knight can't be bad.\"\n\"Okay then.\"\nLeon walked awkwardly ahead down the street. A walk together after hundreds of years was both welcome and awkward.\n\"And yet, do you resent this king?\"\nThe words implied so much but Karina shook her head.\n\"As I told you two hundred years ago, it was a choice Your Majesty had to make.\"\n\"Not as King Lionheart, not as Archduke of Dragonia, but as LeonKarina, your father.\"\n\"\"\nKarina stopped in her tracks at Leon's question. Her footsteps stopped in the snowy street. Even as the snow piled up around her feet, she couldn't answer easily.\nLeon's actions and his judgment were absolutely correct as a king but as her father, as Leon, as Castile's husband?\nIt was wrongshe had to say so. Leon the husband, Leon the father, Leon the king, no matter what logical or grandiose reasons he might give, should not have done it.\nThe clear answer did not fall easily from Karina's lips.\nIt's hard for her to say the words, not just as Karina, but as Karina Dragonia.\n\"I think you're wrong. Or, more accurately, I wish you hadn't.\"\nFor the sake of 30,000 Northern troops, for the sake of their souls Leon, the father, doesn't want her to sacrifice. He says it's wrong.\n\" Me too.\"\nBecause Leon said it first, Karina could speak her mind.\nThe words she's been holding onto for so long, the words she wanted to say but couldn't. For the first time, Karina vented the resentment she thought she shouldn't even think about.\n\"My father, my mother's husband, shouldn't have done that. He should have saved her.\"\nThere's no blame in her voice, just mutual empathy.\nFor the first time in two hundred years, they're honest with each other. The initial resentment between the father and daughter, who knew each other's responsibilities and couldn't blame the other, actually made them laugh.\nFor two people who don't laugh much, it was a faint, faint laugh, but it would grow.\n-Kii-ii-ii-gain!\nA large SUV screeches to a halt in front of the two on Washington Street deserted by evacuees.\n\"Your Majesty Leon!\"\nIt's President Anthony Hopson, bursting out of the car door.\nHe's been traveling nonstop in military transport planes and bulletproof vehicles for two hours since the pair crossed the gate.\n\"You're safe!\"\n\"Who is it?\"\n\"The king of this country or something.\"\n\"???\"\nIf it's a king, it's a king, but what is a king or something like that?\nApart from that, President Hobson, who had been waiting anxiously for Leon's safe return, expressed his delight and noticed Karina at Leon's side.\n\"And her?\"\nAs President Hobson expressed his curiosity, Karina introduced herself.\n\"I am Karina Dragonia, the rightful heir to King Leon Dragonia Lionheart and the Grand Duke' of the realm of Dragonia.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 199:\nThe 25 days that kept the United States and its allies on edge have come to an unexpected end.\n\"It is a monumental moment. For the first time, the United States of America has faced the entire world beyond the gate, and His Imperial Majesty the Emperor and the Hobson Administration's\"\n\"The missing advance scouting party has also returned safely, with no one injured\"\n\"Furthermore, the Emperor of Dragonia has been revealed to be the unmarried daughter of the Lionheart King of the Ten Thousand Gods Temple, who is emerging as a universal icon\"\nContact with another world, the first since the myriad gates occurred, and the news that the ruler of the beyond is Leon's only biological child.\nThe entire world, not to mention the United States, had reported this, and they were expecting contact with the new world, but\n\"The Empire of Dragonia intends to refrain from contact with Earth for the time being.\"\nTaking the podium, the Otherworldly Emperor, Karina Dragonia, crushed their hopes.\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\"Literally. Do not paraphrase my words.\"\n\"Why is that? Surely the exchange between the Empire and the United States will lead to progress on both sides\"\n\"Advancement?\"\nKarina laughed out loud at that.\n\"I have no intention of making this king's empire a colony of Earth.\"\n\"Shi, colonization, you misunderstand!\"\n\"You won't be able to take it by force, because I'm here, but culture, politics, economics, it's all poison.\"\nSome understood what he meant. The logic of poor third-world countries becoming economic and cultural colonies of great powers has been proven time and time again.\n\"So recognize me not as Emperor of Dragonia, but as Archduke Dragonia of Lionheart. I have come to this world solely to help King Lionheart.\"\nThat was the end of Karina's statement.\nEven the gate to Washington, D.C., was removed by Karina and Beatrice, meaning that the United States would no longer be able to interfere in the world beyond the gate for the time being.\n\"We're going to have to put the deliver democracy' plan on hold, even though it was a temporary plan.\"\nMr. Hobson reversed his momentary course, disappointed with his aides' report.\n\"Well, let's get on with the celebration of the heroes who solved the crisis in Washington it's Christmas, after all.\"\nIn any case, the stock market recovered, and Washington's plummeting real estate calmed. President Hobson hoped there would be no more big events like this in his term.\n* * * *\nA suite at the Intercontinental, a luxury five-star hotel in the heart of Washington. The U.S. government had given away the entire top floor for publicity, and Karina was taking in the night view.\n\"This is a very developed city, I never thought I'd see anything like it.\"\n\"They are lowlifes, not favored by the gods. They may clothe themselves in splendor, but their hearts are not at rest.\"\nLeon despised crony capitalism and unaccountable democracy. For him, human greed is an unaccountable desire.\nThe problem was always those who wanted more than they needed, when all they had to do was pat themselves on the back, do what they wanted, and enjoy what they had.\n\"That's why they've made such remarkable progress.\"\nKarina had a different take, but she didn't hide her cold wariness.\nThat's why she closed the gate between the Empire and the United States.\nOf course, she doesn't intend to close the gates completely. They will use it to travel to the Empire, and once Karina knows enough about the planet, they will acquire the technology.\nOf course, all of that will be done at her discretion.\n\"Is everything okay, by the way?\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Your empire. Are you sure you're okay with coming here like this?\"\nKarina had laid aside her power after the courtship shenanigans in Dragonia.\nMore like temporarily put it aside because no matter what the nobles think, Karina has the absolute power to seize the throne at any time.\n\"I am still their emperor. I have no intention of giving up the throne.\"\nEven so, the absence of an emperor would cause them great turmoil.\n\"And this is a test.\"\n\"A test?\"\n\"By nature, the Empire is run by bureaucrats, not me. I was a monarch who ruled, not governed.\"\n\"You're not wrong, Lionheart was like that. But\"\nThe Otherworld is not like Lionheart.\nThe nobles are noble, the knights protect the freemen, and the freemen serve them and pay taxes because it's their duty to do so.\nBut this world lacks this natural sense of coexistence. People talk about Noblesse Oblige, but they are often corrupt, greedy, and unwilling to do their duty.\nLionheart's superiority comes from its unwavering integrity and chivalry. Karina recognized this.\n\"I know. They'll probably fail, or more accurately, eat the country.\"\n\"Then why?\"\n\"Because their failure will make the people wait for my return. I was a fearful emperor, but I was an emperor who did not fail.\"\nAnd that, she adds, will also favor the spread of the faith of the dragon god Dragonia. Just then, something from her shadow lets out a coy chuckle.\n[Cackle, it is said that foolish dwarves do not realize the value of something until they have lost it.]\nLeon gave such a Dragonia a polite look and said.\n\"Doesn't sound like a bad strategy, did you come up with it?\"\n[Gee, you've softened your tone, you didnt call me a lizard.]\n\"If you claim to be a god, you'll be one of the gods I'll worship, unless you're an evil one, in which case it's up to the dragon god to decide.\"\n[It's up to me? You're saying it the hard way, that if you don't like it, you'll cut me down with a single blade.]\n\"\"\nLeon did not deny Dragonia's speculation. Dragonia was pleased with his respectful demeanor, but he was still quite forgiving of the brash Leon.\n[Well, that's good, Dragonia, this dragon god is the guardian of your daughter, so you can be a little more lenient.]\nDragonia was quite pleased with the deal.\nFrom the humiliating offer of divinity from the arrogant gods, all he had to pay was the soul and body of one captured.\nOf course, the souls of 30,000 Northern soldiers would be taxed, but in the grand scheme of things, it was a win for Dragonia.\n\"Your body now occupies the seat of the gods. You will cooperate with us in the destruction of these evil creatures.\"\n[Needless to say, there are few things I abhor more than the gods themselves: those filthy shards of evil.]\nFaced with a common enemy in demons, the Dragon King willingly joined the hands of the gods.\nKarina turned to the Dragon King that dwelled in her heart.\n\"By the way, have you decided on a name for your divinity? You'll need a proper code to spread your faith.\"\n[Cackle I've got something in mind.]\nLeon still didn't like the old wraith, but he made a distinction between that and the current circumstances.\n\"I will proclaim the new code of the gods at the Great Blessing Ceremony, but until then, finish your consultations with the gods.\"\n[I know.]\n\"If you claim to be a god, show your subjects the love they deserve. The Code will be the bridge between the gods and the humans.\"\nLeon shifted his gaze to Karina after giving her some advice.\n\"Karina, do you have any plans after this?\"\n\"Yes, wellthere should be some proposals for Christmas.\"\nThere were no immediate plans for a celebration to commemorate the successful capture of the gate, but the leading economic and political organizations in the United States were interested in Lionheart and the Emperor of the Dragonia Empire.\nWhen they returned to East Asia this time, there would be no telling when they would return, so there would be no shortage of people trying to get a good look at them.\n\"I suppose\"\nLeon started to say something and then repeated himself, his languid demeanor surprising to anyone who knew him.\nKarina was puzzled by her father's demeanor.\nEventually, though, Leon said what he wanted to say.\n\"Then why don't you go on a date with this kingnay, with this father?\"\nKarina's eyes widened at the suggestion that Leon had made.\n* * * *\nIn the run-up to Christmas, the Knights of the Burning Sword are excited at the prospect of spending the holidays in Washington.\nWhile being a Knight of the Burning Sword is a similarly amazing and different experience wherever you go, the majority of the Knights that Leon formed on Earth are still students at the Academy.\nThey felt like they traveled halfway around the world when they went to America to capture the Gate, and now theyre spending Christmas there.\nIt's even better when they have the support of the U.S. government, which is so generous to each and every knight.\n-Hands up for Disneyland!\n-Disneyland is in California. It's the opposite of Washington.\n-I want to go on a tour of Washington's Michelin restaurants!\n-I want to go to Olympic National Park, and we're going to run around the park!\n-I hear they have a million acres, but don't they have bears? What if my horse gets eaten?\n-You can punch a bear with your finger.\n-Natural monument. Jail time if you get caught.\nAnyway, they had all kinds of plans right up until Christmas. For the seniors, this is their last winter as students.\nThey were going to have the best Christmas ever with the White House making accommodations, but\n-Crack! Stand up straight, organism, that's all you can do.\nThe sharp steel wire crackles like a whip, creating a sense of intimidation.\nThe cute, minimalist spider robot swung the wire ferociously.\n-A-37. Straighten up!\n\"Ah, yes!\"\nThe boy straightened up at Yappy's command. Yappy turned his crimson infrared gaze to Chun So-yeon in the front row.\n-The organisms are messed up because the organism captain is not standing straight. Straighten up.\n\"Uh-oh, okay.\"\nKnight Commander Chun So-yeon tensed her posture, but as if to complain about something else, Yappys mechanical leg slapped Ha-ri's shin.\n\"Ouch, why are you hitting me?!\"\n-Dissatisfied, organism?\n\"\"\nDissatisfaction, a feeling that everyone in this room had, but didn't dare let out.\nLike being dragged into the army, and no one being able to say yes! to the question, \"Cadets, are you in the army now?\nAnother commonality is that the knights are technically soldiers.\n-How long do we have to do this?\n-I don't know, until the king tells us to stop?\nLeon said in a cheerful voice as he watched them, admiring their military bearing and the way they moved at Yappy's command.\n\"How is it? I have brought up a bunch of ignoramuses who never had a shred of faith.\"\n\"I see.\"\nKarina moderately countered Leon's boast.\nIt wasn't an empty statement. Leon had been in this world for over a year now.\nThe Knights of the Burning Sword were one of the most elite orders of knights two hundred years ago, but here on Earth, not a shred of faith could be found.\nLeon's resourcefulness in raising a knightly order here and rebuilding thousands of Man-at-Arms was worthy of emulation by the Archduke of Dragonia.\n\"How did you raise an order of knights so quickly, when the labor involved in raising a single knight is no ordinary task?\"\n\"The gods helped me. These are children who have not earned enough merit to be knighted.\"\nLeon noted that the gods of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods were unusually willing to connect directly with the knights, and that the ordination ceremony had been conducted so quickly that it was unimaginable for Lionheart.\n\"Certainly that way, we'll be able to get quality troops quickly, even if they're not at the level of full knights.\"\nOf course, it would require the favor of the Gods, who were all too cooperative with the Lionheart King.\n\"So much is possible for a king as beloved as I am.\"\nHearing Leon boast, Karina stifled a giggle that escaped her.\nHe was not the sort of man to brag about what he had or borrow the authority of the gods to elevate himself.\nHe was simply a faithful worshipper who took pure delight in the fact that he was an agent of the gods, and in all the love they did for him.\nTo boast of it to his daughter was a pleasure, as it seemed to signify a slight relaxation from the urgency of the past.\nThis is the kind of man the gods must love.\n\"Those four are special, though. They all have their own holy objects, and did I mention Han Ha-ri and Chun So-yeon? I'm honestly surprised.\"\n\"Yes, they are talented and deserving of the gods' favor. Did you know, it was the Moon Priestess who decided to pass on the holy relics to them?\"\n\"Aunt Isabelle was ah then, when the king was preparing for the final war.\"\nKarina had heard speculation that the Gate was a giant archive of past events.\nThe last fight of the Lionheart, her own departure from the Lionheart and return and the last fight of the Lionheart.\n\"\"\nShe wondered what it would have been like in real life, if she had done the same thing, and the Lionheart King hadn't had to fight so long alone.",

It was a ceremony of blessing, wasn't it?\"\n[Yes, I will finish my work here and return to Korea.]\nOh Kang-hyuk was trying to be as accommodating as possible to the TTG Temple, since he wanted Leon to return as soon as possible.\n\"Then, Your Majesty, you won't be back until after the New Year, will you?\"\n[I will depart after the Christmas celebration, why are you so impatient?]\n\"Haha, I'm sorry about that. It's just that His Excellency wants to celebrate the New Year with the TTG Temple.\"\nThe new survivor, Grand Duchess Karina Dragonia, is a hot topic in Korea.\nOh Kang-hyuk put his phone down after receiving a positive response from Leon.\n\"Wow, you must be pretty excited.\"\nMr. Oh was surprised to hear Leon's excitement throughout the call.\n\"Of course, Im excited to see my daughter after hundreds of years.\"\nMr. Oh planned to call his grandchildren later. These are the grandchildren who have a taste for receiving pocket money. Before the Lunar New Year, he thought about joining them at sunrise to celebrate the New Year.\nThe President wouldnt call him, would he?\nNormally, presidents take their ministers around to give them a pat on the back, but it's hard to imagine Ahn giving Leon a pat on the back.\n\"By the way, it looks like it went well.\"\nIt was a miracle that Black Gate didn't result in a single fatality. On top of that, he'll be returning to South Korea with the full force of the Grand Duke of Dragonia.\nOh Kang-hyuk knows better than anyone the power of a Holy Knight, and he's been sensing something in the air lately.\nA great war might be coming soon.\nHe had a hunch that they would need every ounce of power they could muster to prepare for that day.\nHe read a report that was addressed to him. A report from a knight under TTG Temple and published by Yappy as shared information.\n\"Report on the Rescue of Compatriots in the Hoeryong Camp\"\nBased on this report, which he received during the process of naturalizing a number of North Korean defectors, Oh Kang-hyuk dispatched an investigation team.\nNominally, it was an envoy for inter-Korean talks, but it was supposed to use hunters from the National Intelligence Service to scout out North Korea.\n\"I hope nothing happens, but.\"\nHe felt a strange sense of reluctance.\nUnfortunately, Mr. Oh's premonitions are usually right on the money.\n* * * *\n\"Karina, let's have a meal together. President Hobson recommended a good chef.\"\n\"Karina, why don't you join me for a bear hunt in Olympic National Park? You've only hunted orcs since you were thirteen.\"\n-Karina.\n-Karina.\n-Karina.\n\"I can't do this.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nHa-ri narrows her eyes at the words Karina uttered while she was in the middle of buying a garment in a dressmaker's shop on Washington Street, USA.\n\"Your Majesty. You're wearing this as if you've never been married.\"\n\"Isn't it true that I never got married?\nHa-ri asks, though her one attempt to go was thwarted in real time by her father being too strong.\nIts not that I couldnt. Its just that I didnt go.\n\"Huh!\"\nHa-ri's mouth drops open as Karina reads her thoughts. Is reading people's minds their specialty, or is it a tradition?\n\"By the way, how about this? This is the latest style!\"\nHa-ri holds out a suit-style outfit and Karina stares at it in disbelief.\n\"Why is this outfit so short?\"\n\"Because it's called a navel tee! It's a hot trend among young people these days!\"\n\"How can an overgrown maiden go around with her belly button out in the open?\"\n\"\"\nHa-ri, who had become an overgrown maiden, clamped her mouth shut.\n\"Is that~ comfortable? There's a nice breeze and it's cool.\"\n\"It's stifling.\"\nKarina flicked her hair out of her face and looked Ha-ri's outfit up and down.\nShe was dressed formally now, but when she'd met her at the palace, she'd been dressed like a renegade by Dragonia's standards.\n\"His Majesty prefers a maiden who is young and modest.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"You only have to look at my mother to see that.\"\n\"What are you talking about?!\"\nHa-ri freaks out but Karina continues with her bombshell.\n\"The position of mistress to the honorable King Lionheart is vacant. Shouldn't a woman have her eye on it?\"\n\"Your Excellency?! Don't you think your idea is too old-fashioned?!\"\nHow many people want to be a queen these daysshe wanted to say, but she didn't know Come to think of it, it wasn't even that.\n\"Handsome. Strong. Has a lot of money but he's a little old.\nOr to put it another way, he's three hundred years old and still so young. A woman who wants to marry the Lionheart King would be worth a thousand truckloads.\nWell, I heard that your Excellency also had a lot of suitors?\n\"Of course, Im a princess. Isnt it natural for men to have their eyes on me?\"\n\"Oh\"\nWhat confidence. Ha-ri wondered if the father and daughter have the same pride.\nFirst of all, follow the example of the Magician Queen, who is taking her place next to His Majesty as if it were a given, though I suspect that's her strategy.\"\n\"You mean Queen Beatrice?\"\n\"Yes, and the new head of the Knight Order. She's a good candidate, too. She's a future Holy Knight, given that she can borrow power from the Dark Lord without payment.\"\nKarina insisted that being a Holy Knight was enough to be a candidate for Queen of the Lionheart so her gaze shifted to Ha-ri.\n\"I think you'd make a pretty good candidate since you can receive the holy power of two gods, Poma and Petos.\"\n\"I'm notthatthatthat!\"\nHa-ri was speechless, her face as white as her hair, and as if she thought it was cute, Karina grabbed her chin to admire her gaping face.\n\"Well, such innocence is not bad. You must be good at giving birth to children since you have a fair face and a smooth ass.\"\n\"Seo, it's sexual harassment\"\nHa-ri was flabbergasted by Karina's praising her that she would be a good mother even though she was younger than her.\n\"No, but is Your Excellency okay with it? Even if I get married?\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\"Your Majesty, Id be your fathers wife!\"\n\"Do you think I don't know the obvious family tree even if you don't explain it in such a twisted way?\"\nAt Ha-ri's uncomprehending expression, Karina said that it didn't matter.\n\"It's normal for someone of his stature to have dozens of concubines.\"\n\"Yes, yes?!\"\n\"The Lionheart King is proof of a great knight in his own right. The first Lionheart King, Leon Lionheart, had seven wives, and the sixth, Empress Leona Lionheart, had twelve official consorts.\"\n\"A female?!\"\n\"Goddess Demera provided a surrogate womb, so the queens had no problem with fertility.\"\n\"No, but what's a surrogate womboh, that's not the problem!\"\n\"Then what the hell is the problem\"\nKarina tilted her head as if she really didn't understand while Ha-ri shook her clenched fist and exclaimed.\n\"Monogamy! Monogamy is the most natural thing in the world!\"\n\"Han Ha-ri, you have quite an old-fashioned mindset, for the Sea God's priestess.\"\n\"I'm old-fashioned? I am?\"\n\"It is the duty of a man of good seed to have many descendants. It will complicate matters of succession, but the gods will see to that.\"\n\"Ew, ew\"\nHa-ri couldn't keep up with Karina's mentality, which was shocking to modern Earthlings.\nNot only does it make sense to have multiple wives and husbands to leave behind many excellent offspring, but it also forces brothers to fight fiercely when succession issues arise?\nEven medieval kings didn't intentionally create such beanpole families.\n\"It was a problem from the beginning. Even if he was cursed by the Moon Goddess at his wedding, hes the Lionheart King and Archduke of Dragonia, and can only produce one true-born child.\"\n\"A curse?\"\nOh, you didnt know.\nThe romance of the Lionheart King, who kidnapped Castile, a priestess of the moon and chastity, from the temple and married her in a ceremony that was talked about for fifty years in the kingdom.\nThe Goddess of the Moon and Chastity was furious that he had broken the chastity of her priest.\n\"Goddess Dinah, you are too kind, placing such a curse on the Lionheart King, who is supposed to produce an heir.\"\n\"!!\"\nHa-ri, realizing the implications, could not open her lips but regardless, she wanted to know.\nUm, has the curse been lifted?\n\"That's why I was born, isn't it?\"\n\"Well, yes.\"\nHow? Ha-ri's honest gaze reminded Karina of the story she'd heard.\n\"Through the mediation of the goddess Arianna, it was agreed that the curse would be broken if the king finishes a quest. Apparently, it was to build a temple on the moon alone and it took about three years.\nA temple on the moon? Is that possible?\n\"Not impossible. With the help of the World Tree, tended by the Goddess of Forests and Trees\"\n\"Huh? World Tree?\"\n\"You know about it?\"\n\"Oh, yes! His Majesty is raising seedlings of the World Tree, planted and nurtured in Naju!\"\nLeon obtained a seedling from Gunnar in Paradise and nurtured it in the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods in Naju.\nBut it didn't grow fast enough, so he opened the Gate to the Lionheart Realm to seek a solution from the Sages of the Forest, where he obtained the Grail of the Moon and completed the current Grail.\n\"His Majesty said we were still one piece short of completing the World Tree.\"\n\"One pieceI see.\"\nKarina stroked her chin as if remembering something. Just then, a shadow burst from Karina's shadow and a small dragon appeared.\nIt was Dragonia.\n\"Aaah! Ah, hello, Dragonia!\"\n[Goddess of War and Sea.]\nDragonia glanced at Ha-ri, then settled on Karina's shoulder.\n[Tell me, what is the missing piece?]\n\"Curious?\"\n[Because of the promise to rebuild my race through the World Tree.]\n\"Do not be impatient, Dragon God. Your wishes will be fulfilled. It's just a matter of time.\"\nHow long it takes is the question, but in any case, the gods intend to honor their promise to Dragonia to rebuild his race.\n\"As I'm sure you're aware, you should be preparing for the upcoming celebration. It would be an appropriate time to announce a new divinity. However, if you can't reach an agreement with the gods, you'll have a hard time rallying the faith even if you do gain divinity.\"\n[Hmph, theres no shortage of ways to gather the faith of mortals, you do your duty as my Holy Knight.]\nDragonia and Karina's relationship had become quite bizarre.\nThe relationship between Dragonia and Karina has become a strange one, as the host has been stripped of its soul and body, and Dragonia must now rely on Karina to represent his divinity.\nUnlike the other Holy Knights, Dragonia's relationship with Karina was strictly business.\n\"Han Ha-ri, do you know that?\"\n\"What?\"\nHan Ha-ri felt a sense of foreboding at the grumpy look on Karina's face.\n\"Even the first offspring of Dragonia must have a dozen females. As soon as they are born, they must begin to serve as stallions.\"\nHe would leave many excellent seeds. Like King Lionheart.\n\"That, that's sexual harassment!\"\nThe aging Archduke of Dragonia was having a lot of fun teasing the innocent newcomer.\n* * * *\n\"It seems to me that Karina is avoiding this king.\"\n\"Oh, is she?\"\nDespite Leon's outburst, Beatrice continued to tilt the bottle of wine she'd been pouring into Leon's glass.\nShe listened in silence as he continued to ramble on about his daughter. She was a good listener.\n\"I'm sure you have a long list of things you've been wanting to do with your daughter.\"\n\"That's right, there's so much I haven't done with her, and I'm not sure how I'll be able to spend time with her when I get back to Korea.\"\n\"Don't worry, there will be plenty of time.\"\nAs Beatrice watched, their relationship seemed so natural.\nIt's clear that both father and daughter care and love each other, but the father is eager to do things with her, and the daughter responds bluntly.\nThis is what a normal father-daughter relationship is supposed to be like, but it's a little bigger than that with a 300-year-old father and a 200-year-old daughter.\n\"Your daughter will need time to adjust to the planet.\"\n\"Isn't that what this king is going to teach her?\"\n\"Your Majesty, who can't even use a smartphone yet?\"\nBeatrice huffs and pulls out her own smartphone.\n\"A cell phone is only good for making calls, and that's all you need to carry around in the first place\"\n\"Apparently, Archduchess Karina and Lord Vulcanus created social accounts, and Im also following them.\n\"!\"\nThe picture Beatrice showed was from Karina's social media account. Leon squinted at it.\nThere were several pictures of Karina with someone else. Probably Ha-ri or one of her traveling companions.\n\"I don't have \"\n\"What?\"\n\"There are no pictures of her with this king. Here's Lord Vulcanus, here's Lord Raihar, and here's Lord Chun So-yeon and Lord Spinner!\"\n\"Ah~ Come to think of it, there is\"\nBeatrice quickly covered the two-shot of her and Karina with her thumb, but it was impossible to hide it with her tiny fingers.\n\"There's a picture of you, too, so why is it only this king!\"\n\"That's\"\nIt would be too harsh to tell Leon that it would be rare for a daughter to post a picture with her father on social media.\n\"Well, you can still take pictures together in the future, like at this Christmas banquet.\"\n\"You mean the capture celebration that President Hobson threw. Never mind. This king intends to spend Christmas alone with Karina-\"\n\"Your Majesty.\"\nBeatrice gently grasped the back of Leon's hand. The gesture was gentle, her expression a smile, but the strength in her grip clearly sent a strong message of intent.\n\"You mean to tell me that me, Lord Vulcanus, and Lord Spinner have been running all sorts of official duties for you, such as the National Rifle Association sponsorships and celebrations, while you've been spending time with your daughter?\"\n\"Well, yes, it's a lot of work.\"\n\"This Christmas celebration is for the entire International Hunter Alliance and their ministers. There is no better place to spread the faith of the Alliance.\"\n\"So, with my faith in you-\"\n\"Oh, I'll be attending as Your Majesty's partner, and the First Lady has even gotten me a very pretty dress.\"\nBeatrice's purple eyes sent him a fresh gaze, which contained an unspoken pressure to get to work.\n\"Is Karina coming, too?\"\n\"Yes. She went with Miss Ha-ri to buy a dress.\"\nLeon didn't see a way out so he sighed and promised to attend the Christmas celebration.",

      "content": "Chapter 201:\nChristmas is coming.\nA Christmas that the TTG Temple members will be spending in the United States.\nIn honor of the successful capture of the Black Gate, the Hobson's administration decided to host a grand banquet for allied Hunters.\nIn reality, it was a way to cement relations with allies and show the world that America was strong, but TTG Temple was going to be a part of it anyway.\nIn the meantime, TTG Temple was busy.\nFirst, there was a ceremonial appearance with President Hobson, then meetings with the Maverick Guild and other American believers, and then a knighting ceremony.\nEven in traditionally Christian America, the TTG Temple presence was expanding, and other Holy Knights were busy as well, so it would be far from a vacation for the high-ranking officers.\nOf course, Leon had put most of that aside to go somewhere with Karina, the daughter he thought was dead after nearly two hundred years.\nThe higher-ups understood, but for this Christmas celebration, Leon had to be there.\n\"Chun So-yeon.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nSo-yeon, who followed Leon around as his personal assistant or as a representative of the Korean Hunter Association, straightened her awkward suit tie.\n\"Has Grand Duke Karina arrived as well?\"\n\"Yes, Her Highness the Grand Duke is waiting for us.\"\nChristmas Eve.\nToday is a celebration of the U.S. government's successful capture of the Washington Black Gate. Even if the contents weren't as dangerous as they seemed, the success of the Black Gate was still something to celebrate.\n\"By the way, Your Majesty, after today's celebration, the New Divinity' will also appear, right?\"\n\"That's right. This country is the strongest and most influential in the world. Introducing a new god to them is a good opportunity.\"\nWhat is Ventasis doing? His Holy Knight has been taken away.\nChun Se-yeon was a knight of Ventasis. She swore vengeance on the murderous Archduke Akasha and used its power to achieve her revenge, only to have her soul saved by Leon's intervention.\nHowever, she has been able to use the dark powers of Ventasis ever since, thanks to Leon's favor in many ways.\nThis time, however, Ventasis did not make the usual concessions.\nThe God of Darkness and Vengeance had to share his Holy Knight with a new Dragon God, and he had to give up the 30,000 souls he was supposed to harvest.\nThis worried So-yeon, as it would shake the authority of the Dark God.\nEven though he was one of the Lords of the Ten Thousand Gods, Ventasis was far from a benign deity. There must be a price to pay for his cooperation with Leon.\n\"The Dark One is not inflexible; he lends his power in exchange for souls, but there is a distinction.\"\nPersonal vengeance, grand vengeance, or vengeance against a target.\nRegardless, Leon had a soft spot for the avengers who contracted with him, as it was one thing for Ventasis' contractors to die and not make it to paradise.\nThus, Leon's vengeance on the demons on behalf of the souls Ventasis should have taken was grand enough to move even Ventasis.\n\"Your clothes are beautiful.\"\n\"What? Ah, thank you.\"\nSo-yeon blushed at Leon complimenting her on her dress. But she knows it's not a rational approach.\nShe knew he was thinking of her, of the woman who had set herself on fire to take revenge on the murderous archduke.\n\"Once again, congratulations.\"\n\"Yes. Thank you.\"\nLeon looked genuinely pleased. So-yeon smiled wryly, knowing why he'd been more upbeat than usual lately.\n\"Has your father recovered?\"\n\"Thanks to Your Majesty's care, he's been consuming Goddess Demera's crops steadily, so he should be out of bed soon.\"\n\"Good, I'm glad to hear that. Karina and you both must always feel guilty that you have committed great disloyalty to your parents.\nEven though it was revenge that had to be done?\n\"No parent would be pleased to see their child abandon them for revenge. The child should bury the parent, not the parent should bury the child.\"\nLeon was sure that the former host of the demonic sword, Chen Ji-hao, must have felt similarly to him after hearing So-yeon's story.\nHis heart broke, and he swallowed back an agonized scream, sure he would blame himself.\nThat was the love a parent deserved, a love so great that only children could tear a parent's heart out.\nStay by your fathers side. There are so many things he couldnt do for you, so hell always live in regret.\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\"\nIt's probably why Leon has been trying so hard to be with Karina lately, and even though she thinks it's stupid, she knows how he feels, so she tries to be good to him.\n* * * *\nAt the entrance, Leon spotted the limousine with Karina inside.\n\"You arrived first, Your Majesty.\"\n\"Yes\"\nLeon stared at Karina as she got out with Allen Taylor, an S-class Hunter from the Maverick Guild.\nOn this trip to the United States, Leon and the TTG Temple's protocols would be handled entirely by Maverick Guild members hired by the White House and the U.S. government.\nThe fact that the TTG Temple's followers are not small in number and have experience in the joint attack played a part.\n\"But\"\nLeon glanced at Karina from behind his entourage.\nSince it was a celebration, Ha-ri, So-yeon, Allen, and the others were familiar with the appropriate dress code: men in suits, women in dresses.\nTTG Temple members got their clothes tailored at the shops selected by the White House secretaries, but Leon only saw men's clothing, so today was the first time he saw his daughter in a dress.\nKarina's dress was a statement of confidence.\nHer black dress has a bold slit in the back and sides, similar to what Hollywood actresses would wear.\n\" Karina, is that outfit from\"\n\"It's quite nice, isn't it? I thought Lionheart and the Dragonia Empire's dress culture was fashion-forward, but I guess Earth isn't far behind.\"\n\"Hmph, hmph yes, it's quite different from the clothes the other knights received.\"\nThe female knights of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods also wore dresses of their own. But the dresses the White House provided were basically expensive, ready-made dresses.\nKarina's dress, however, is far from off-the-rack.\n\"It was a gift from Sir Graham of England. He flew in a craftsman who supplies the royal family. Indeed, he's quite the craftsman.\"\n\"Sir Graham?\"\nLeon fumbled for a vague recollection of who Graham was. When he couldn't recall, So-yeon whispered softly.\n\"He's the one you defeated with Cornwall Ong in the courtship duel, the one in the silver armor.\"\n\"You mean the one who looked like his parasitic bastard?\"\n\"Yes, the one who was knighted by Queen Victoria.\"\n\"Hmm, I know, and that he's an unworthy bastard who tried to woo her.\"\nThen Leon's gaze flicked to Allen Taylor.\n\"You were one of the guys in the courtship duel.\"\n\"Uh, uhm Your Majesty, that was to clear a quest\"\n\"You offered to be this king's son-in-law for a quest?\"\n\"Ah, no, it was actually because I had a crush on the Archduke of Dragonia\"\n\"What?\"\n\"\"\nWhat the hell?\nAllen Taylor knew that the Lionheart King in front of him was a great man worthy of respect, but aside from that, it wasn't easy to deal with a man who was a bully and not without a dark heart.\nI've only known her for a few days, but she's an attractive woman.\nI've met a lot of upper-class women and realized that they're from a different world.\nBut with Karina, I realize that's an illusion.\nEarth's high society is a sham, a mere imitation of real nobility. Real nobility exudes dignity with every step.\nKarina had the dignity of royalty, of nobility, and all who met her were overwhelmed and instinctively bowed down.\nIf it weren't for King Leon, we could have a courtship duel\nIt was then that Allen felt a fierce gaze directed at him and met it.\n\"Whoa!\"\nAllen immediately looked away. The real king, who was even more authoritative than Karina and who was proudly proclaiming his kingship, was glaring at him.\nThe embodiment of heavenly and earthly infantile absolute power had long since penetrated the thoughts of the struggling commoner.\nYou lowly bastards!\nLeon's face contorted into a frown.\nThere was no way he didn't know what they were thinking.\nGraham, with his royal craftsmen flown in from as far away as England, or Allen, who clings to his daughter's side as her bodyguard.\nYou mean to tell me they're still taking chances!'\nLeon was feeling a sense of crisis.\n\"GRARARARA! Your Majesty, it's like we haven't seen each other in ages! Oh, Grand Duchess Karina, you're dressed to impress!\"\nIn the distance, Vulcanus approaches with the Knights of the Flaming Sword. His bulging muscles strained against his suit, but his eyes scanned Karina up and down with amusement.\n\"Still got a great set of tits and ass!\"\n\"!\"\nHow dare this damned barbarian touch my daughter?\nLeon was about to say something in disbelief when Karina spoke up.\n\"You have a fierce face, so there's nothing to see but those toned muscles, so take off your clothes.\"\n\"GRARARARA!!\"\nVulcanus laughed hilariously. Karina and Vulcanus are longtime friends, so they don't mind cracking jokes like this, but her father is a different story.\n\"Karina\"\n\"Yes? What is it, Your Majesty?\"\nYou have a curfew after ten oclock from now on.\n\"????\"\nTreasures should be kept tightly hidden in the house and not shown. All fathers had this in common.\n* * * * *\nThe nation is in a festive mood in the run-up to Christmas, following the successful conclusion of a major event that turned the country upside down: the Washington Gate.\nHowever, their main concern is the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods and the otherworldly Archduke of Dragonia.\nThe real gods and their representative, the Lionheart King. The transcendent power of the Holy Knights is of great interest to the United States, a strongly Christian nation.\n-There is only one God\n-No, but it's a different dimension\n-The Lionheart King was surprisingly accepting of Christianity.\n-Why doesn't our god show up at times like this?\n-The number of worshippers of the Ten Thousand Gods is increasing tremendously! Why shouldn't ours?\nThese were established religions that had been losing authority since the Cataclysm. The rise of the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods must have been felt as a great crisis.\nBut apart from that, even the ordinary Christian believers were confused as to how to accept the gods of another dimension.\n\"Mr. President, I heard that the TTG Temple is going to make a major announcement. Do you know anything about it?\"\n\"Mr. President of the Senate, I'm keeping it a secret for the surprise show.\"\nWhen President Hobson heard Leon's plans for the Christmas celebration, he cooperated.\nAlthough he was a Christian, he already knew of the existence of Meriel, the Goddess of Fate, and recognized that the gods of other dimensions could be very useful.\nThe U.S. government would be a part of Leon's plans for this celebration.\nHowever, it has kept it a secret until today in anticipation of backlash and protests from religious coalitions aligned with the domestic opposition.\nFortunately, America's Christian faithful don't seem to have any intention of pouncing on the otherworlder after he broke through the black gate.\n\"There you are.\"\nPresident Hobson pointed to Leon and Karina, Grand Duchess of Dragonia, approaching from the entrance.\nThe Lionheart King looked uncomfortable, and the Archduke of Dragonia was blunt.\nPresident Hobson shook their hands with a friendly smile, though he sensed a strange undercurrent between them.\n\"Welcome, Your Majesty Lionheart, Archduke of Dragonia. I hope you had no trouble finding your way here?\"\nHe offered his hand and Leon shook it.\n\"You have made my stay comfortable.\"\n\"I'm glad to hear that. How are you finding things Archduke Karina? Unlike His Majesty, this must be quite new to you.\"\n\"It's a treat to see the otherworld, and I'm grateful for your hospitality.\"\nHaving succeeded in imprinting a modicum of goodwill on the two men, President Hobson twitched the corners of his mouth and continued his conversation with them.\nAnyway, youre planning to start at the opening ceremony, right? I heard the general idea, but since its my first time, I dont know what to prepare.\n\"It's good enough that you're officiating.\"\nAt Leon's request, President Hobson arranged for the broadcasters and even an internet broadcast.\nWith the success of the Washington Gate assault and the presence of the two most sought-after men in the world right now, the Otherworldly Lionheart King and the Imperial Emperor Karina, reporters from all over the world flocked to the event.\nWith all eyes on him, Leon had an important announcement to make.\n\"Let's get started.\"\nMoments later, reporters' cameras captured ministers and Hollywood stars from around the world as the ceremony began but even they were just bridesmaids this time.\n\"Leon Dragonia Lionheart, the Lionheart King, and Karina Dragonia, Grand Duchess of Dragonia, please enter!\"\nTwo men and a woman step up to the podium as the moderator introduces them.\nOne was a handsome young man in a handsome blue suit, the other a dark-haired beauty in a beautiful black dress.\nIs there anyone who can understand at a glance that the two good-looking people have a father-daughter relationship?\nThe two kept the cameras glued to them with their modesty and speeches worthy of an opening ceremony.\nThe audience had so many questions for them, but questions about royalty were strictly forbidden, and only the words of the two were allowed.\n\"Today, I would like to introduce the newest god of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.\"\nAnd then the bombshell.\nAt the mention of introducing a god, the room erupts into a roar.\n\"Quiet.\"\nKarina's one word quiets the din. Leon is Leon, but Karina's gaze has an unspoken aura that overwhelms the room.\n\"Archduke of Dragonia.\"\nAt Leon's words, Karina unleashes something writhing in her shadows.\nThe shadow, which had borrowed the holy power of several gods through the power-focusing staff, had grown to the point where it could reveal a massive incarnation even with its own insufficient divinity.\n\"That thing!\"\n\"What the!\"\n\"Dragon?\"\nIt did not have a physical form.\nIt was merely a shadow that expanded and took on the form of a recognizable beast.\nBut the shadow, huge enough to engulf the dais, was enough to make its presence felt.\n[I am the dragon-king of Drakkara, lord of mythology, mountain- master, progenitor of all dragons.]\nThe voice that boomed out from the overwhelming mass of the creature made even the off-camera audience nervous.\nWhen Dragonia felt that his voice had carried far enough into the world, he proclaimed his new name in a majestic voice.\n[I am Dragonia, God of Gold and Contracts.]",

      "content": "Chapter 202:\nGod of Gold and contracts.\nDragonia's announcement of his divinity had the room buzzing and that goes for the internet audience around the world, the major broadcasters, too.\n-God of Gold and Contracts? What does that mean?\n-Gold? The name is kind of weird.\n-It's a bit different from the previous gods of the pantheon, who were more of a light and sea kind of thing.\nThere's been a lot of speculation in that brief moment, but it's all pointless unless Dragonia declares it himself.\n[There are many gods in the pantheon, but I will be able to relate to you more closely. Any believer in the pantheon will be able to receive my grace.]\nEveryone seemed curious at Dragonia's confident demeanor.\nIn the end, what matters is the Code of the Gods. It's a complementary agreement between a god and his followers that must be upheld\nPresident Hobson and many other high-ranking officials focused on what Dragonia's code was, for gold and contracts were so important in a capitalist society that it could have profound implications for the United States.\nSoon after, Dragonia proclaimed its own code.\nAll believers of Gold and Contract can make contracts under divine mediation. Contracts made under divine mediation must be honored. Divine intervention is permitted for contracts that are not honored. Contracts that are unreasonable to either party can be broken during the contract formation phase at the discretion of the priest. In exchange for all contracts, the faithful will pay 1% of the mediated contract's gold to the Order of Dragonia. When all the codes were announced, the room began to roar.\nEven those who were late in interpreting the codes were clear on what they were saying.\nAbsolute adherence to the contract.\nA 1% contribution to the arbitration process.\nThe smarter ones intuited that this was a tsunami that would shake modern economic history.\nThe issuance of contracts of absolute trust, punishable by the God of Contracts himself.\nIndividuals trading with individuals, corporations trading with corporations, nations trading with nations. The more money you have, the more power you have, the more casually you become a piece of toilet paper, with all the loopholes and legal trappings of modern credit.\nBut a contract mediated by the Order of Dragonia?\nThe gods do not discriminate.\nThey don't punish their followers by classification.\nNo matter how powerful you are, no matter how rich you are, no matter how many loopholes you cut, no matter how many escape routes you open.\nNo matter how powerful or wealthy you are, no matter how many loopholes you've carved for yourself.\n-That's crazy. Wall Street is going to have a seizure.\n-Will they cut off subcontractors?\n-This would be more than a revolution, it would be a game changer. The credibility of all contracts would be worth a shred of toilet paper, and only contracts from the Order of Dragonia would be wanted.\nIt was a contract that gave the underdog an enormous advantage and forced them to trust each other, even in contracts where they didn't trust each other.\nIn the modern world, even if a civil lawsuit is filed for an unreasonable contract or breach of contract, the trial can drag on for ten or twenty years.\nNo matter how big or small the amount of money is, the victim is always the weakest in modern capitalist society.\n-If you commit charter fraud, you will be punished to the fullest.\n-Who needs civilian contracts? Everyone will use Dragonia contracts.\n-That's not all. Wage contracts, insurance contracts, subcontractsall the shitty contracts that the underprivileged can't sue for and can't get away with.\n-Use it or lose it contracts with the Order of Dragonia.\n-Scammers out of business.\nThe financial industryno, it's the most divine thing since sliced bread, disrupting the entire economy of credit that mankind has ever built.\nA ploy by Dragonia to garner a massive following and rip them off for a mere 1% fee.\nThe greedy dragon, who loved gold and silver treasures, was convinced that his divinity and code would dominate the global financial economy.\nThe more sophisticated human economies become, the more powerful the power of absolute compliance contracts will be.\n* * * *\nThe Christmas celebration was highly politicized, but it was ultimately drowned out by the disruption of the new divinity of Dragonia.\nPeople began to discuss the immense security that could be gained by becoming a member of the pantheon and having their contracts arbitrated by God Dragonia, and even the specificity of Christmas Eve had to be put aside to calculate the impact this would have.\nA nightmare for public officials and the world's leading corporations had begun.\nApart from that.\n\"Karina, there is such a thing as royal dignity, and then there is exposing your back. Put on your father's suit now.\"\nLeon was clinging to his daughter as if he didn't care, even as he represented a faith with enormous ramifications.\n\"You are persistent.\"\nHow can you just stand by and let that barbaric thing Vulcan make fun of you? If it were on this Earth, he would have been caught a long time ago for harassment!\n\"Is there a crime for such nonsense?\"\n\"There are in this world! Just like the demons get beheaded for looking at this king!\"\n\"Don't demons usually rip throats without asking?\"\nAt Karina's sullen reply, Leon grew impatient.\n\"The skin of royalty is a noble thing. It is not something to be seen by commoners. You may be the Grand Duke of Dragonia, but you are the only royal daughter of the Lionheart King.\"\n\" is not our hereditary kingdom.\"\nWith a look of incredulity on her face, Karina searched for a way to interrupt this conversation, and found President Hobson, who had unintentionally overheard their conversation.\n\"President Hopson, I don't see the First Lady.\"\nKarina tried to change the subject and brought President Hobson into the conversation.\nAh, the wife is currently at the villa with the children. As president, I have to take care of things so its hard for me to spend time with the family.\n\"Isn't that what public service is all about? It's your duty to serve the people.\"\n\"Hahaha, but I suppose it's not like I'm losing out on seeing Her Highness the Grand Duchess of Dragonia, she's so beautiful\"\nHobson made eye contact with Leon, who was giving him an odd look from over Karina's shoulder, and then said apologetically.\n\"I'd like to introduce you to my wife and children, the Archduke and Her Majesty, I'm sixty-three this year, heh heh heh.\"\nHe has a wife, he has kids, and he's old. Come on.\n\"You're in your prime.\"\nNo. I don't believe it.\n\"Hahahaha By the way, Your Majesty Lionheart, you look very handsome. The suit suits you really well. All husbands with wives will be wary of this.\nPresident Hobson, trying to keep the humor in moderation and Karina chimed in.\n\"Hes right. Since we have succession issues, you should only spend the night with trustworthy virgins.\"\nThat kind of answer here?!'\nWhy couldn't you just pass the joke off as a joke? President Hobson gave her a disapproving glance, but Karina was serious.\n\"Your Majesty, we don't do kidnapping and secret weddings here. Don't you have to uphold the laws of this place?\"\nKidnap?!\n\"Ka, Karinathis king is not a horny man who kidnaps women to marry them, and he never has, except for your mother!\"\nDid you?!\n\"After two hundred years of fighting alone, you're certainly qualified, but there are plenty of decent women around, so why don't you start there?\"\n\"Karina!\"\nI also need to produce an heir, so why not find some good seeds?\n\"Grrrr!\"\nLeon struggled to control his half-bubbling stomach.\nIs this really the conversation of a three-hundred-year-old father and a two-hundred-year-old daughter? President Hobson wondered if people didn't change much at that age.\n\"Hmmm bad timing for me to find you?\"\nJust then, a beautiful woman in a snow-white dress with platinum hair strode toward the three of them.\n\"Hello.\"\nThe three greeted her with a short, unobtrusive bow. For her identity was still unknown.\nKing Leon. Congratulations on successfully bringing your daughter back.\nMeriel, Goddess of Fate, a goddess from another dimension, like the TTG Temple Gods or Dragonia.\n\"King Leon. Did you like my gift?\"\nHer gaze flickered to Karina, and she smiled.\n* * * *\nAmid the bustle of celebration and the proclamation of the Code of the God of Gold and Contracts, Leon was alone with the goddess Meriel.\n\"You are the one who called me to America.\"\n\"I read something about your daughter's fate.\"\nThis was the reason King Leon had come here with all his might.\nThe Goddess of Fate he met in Korea could not decide his fate.\nAfter returning home feeling she was of little help, the second time she contacted him was at Washington Gate, where he was warned that his daughter's fate would be determined by him.\n\"Fate is easily changed when you tell it all, and it's appropriate to make it happen.\"\nTherefore, Meriel only gave minimal hints and did not add any requirements to Leon's actions. In reality, Leon saved Karina from the dragon curse and reunited with his own daughter.\n\"I don't think it's just that.\"\n\"Have you noticed?\"\nIt's not Leon who answers a smiling Meriel, but the divinity behind him.\n[My knight is closer to the divine than anyone else, and I can't hide divine matters from him.]\nAt Goddess Ariannas words, Meriel took a sip of her tea and relaxed.\n\"You're right, my mere mortal self cannot be involved with someone of King Leon's stature, but when you're a being like me, it's a different story.\"\nMeriel read Leon's fate, but she could not intervene: her own rank was too low, but his was too high.\nShe wondered if she could intervene if she were a branch from the great trunk of Leon's destiny.\n\"Karina Dragonia, I read the fate of the child from King Leon, and I was able to intervene'.\"\nIn other words.\n\"I intervened in the fate of the Black Gate in Washington, even though I didn't intend it to be a gate.\"\nShe admitted that she was behind the summoning of the scourge of humanity, Black Gate.\n\"Oh, please keep this off the record, it's a story the US government will not like.\"\n\"I'm not immoral enough to leak the word of the gods, but I do have questions.\"\n\"I'll answer anything.\"\n\"Isn't the US government a longtime ally, and the Goddess could be seen as betraying them.\"\nThe Black Gate is a devastating economic blow as soon as it happens.\nIt creates an atmosphere of anxiety and fear that the country is about to be destroyed, sending people from all walks of life into a panic.\nAlthough the United States has built its diplomacy well enough to attract alliance hunters around the world, it doesn't do so for free.\nIf word of this leaked out, the U.S. government would feel betrayed to the core by Goddess Meriel.\n\"I didn't think the Black Gate would be summoned well, that would be a lie.\"\nMeriel gazed at the Lionheart King before her, and didn't hide the favor in her eyes as she found his presence so endearing.\n\"I arrived on Earth faster than King Leon and the gods of the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods. May I tell you what I've been feeling?\"\n\"Speak.\"\n\"The children of this Earth are self-indulgent and corrupt, more so than King Leon and the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods can imagine.\"\nThere was a chill in the goddess's voice, not anger or hatred, but pity and compassion.\n\"The history of this planet is one of slaughter and persecution of one's own kind in the name of a god, and I'm sure there are many more who have died in the name of gods than there are wars.\"\n\"There are many gods on Earth, but they are false, and if they exist, they are absurdly evil. He puts his children through a human sacrifice test, and if he doesn't like it, he fills the whole world with water.\"\n\"What about the less civilized parts of the world? They rule in the name of their gods, and they sully the name of god with diabolical acts.\"\nGods that don't exist.\nA god who never shows up and only exists in stories.\nA god who doesn't do anything when the world is facing a demonic invasion.\nThe omnipotent gods of the story don't exert any power on Earth.\n\"You know I've been on this planet for years, doing favors for the U.S. government, and you know what they wanted most?\"\n\"The defense of the gate\"\n\"Defense of the gates? The truth about demons and magic stones? World peace, which no one in high places seems to want.\"\nGoddess Meriel felt a twinge of disappointment in the American higher-ups who had been so good to her.\nIt wasn't anger or hatred, but it was enough to convey patheticness.\n\"More money, less risk to become a superpower, and bad luck for our adversaries. To quote the catchphrase, make America great again.\"\nShe was disappointed but the goddess knew that was the nature of human life. However\n\"You appeared, King Leon.\"\nGoddess Meriel's gaze turns straight to Leon.\n\"The dearly beloved agent of the gods and the rightful king of men.\n\"I have judged that your ability to establish a proper order is more important than any dealings with allies I have made.\"\nFor her sake, the goddess said that it didn't matter if she had to turn her back on America.",

You seem to have a strong aversion to having your authority eroded.\"\nHe was right.\nThe Lionhearts are tolerant of their fellow humans, to the point of sanctioning the existence of the Empire.\nDistrust is also a human choice. As long as they don't insult the actual gods, they don't force them to believe.\nHowever,\nGo beyond disbelief and show aggression, and the Knights of the Lionheart will gladly draw their swords.\n\"Times will change, and in the course of that change, you will surely be challenged by the vested interests, as you might have guessed from your decision to accept the deity of the God of Gold and Contracts into the pantheon.\"\nDragonia, God of Gold and Contracts.\nLeon was not unaware of Dragonia's intentions to overrun modern capitalism with dragon greed and flaying, but the gods were.\nMeriel had already guessed that Leon was determined to take over the world.\nI guess you can't fool divine wisdom after all.\n[Yes, but this goddess would not tell her ally.]\nI could guess why.\n\"Goddess of Fate, if you desire a place in the pantheon, the gods are said to be willing.\"\nAt that, Meriel laughed wordlessly.\nShe might have business dealings with mortals, but she was a goddess. To a being of eons, the transactions of a moment are unclear.\nMeriel answered with a bright smile.\n\"I see I've kept you busy long enough, so I'll leave you to it.\"\nLeon followed her to her feet and placed a respectful kiss on the back of her hand.\n\"I look forward to the day when the Goddess of Destiny returns to the Pantheon.\"\n\"Hee hee hee I'm looking forward to the day when I get a good representative like King Leon.\"\n-Poof! Pow! Pow!\nOutside, a fireworks display was in full bloom.\nThe fireworks were spreading in all their splendor as if to hide the tacit agreement that had been made here.\n* * * *\nAfter the fireworks display, the finale of the Christmas celebration, the TTG Temple naturally gathered together.\nMagician Queen Beatrice, Yakt Spinner the Holy Knight of Iron and Blacksmithing, Vulcanus the Holy Knight of War and Flame, and the Flaming Sword Knights.\nThe Knights of Naju, including Knight Commander Chun So-yeon and Han Ha-ri, the Priestess of two gods.\nAnd the curious who naturally followed the TTG Temple.\n-Kiruk. Finalizing the process. Finalizing the process.\nAs Yappy approached and reported, Leon saw the piles of rice and stones being piled up in the center of the circle surrounding the temple.\nBlessed rice was flown in from Naju, South Korea, and blessed corn and wheat grown in the Great Plains of the Midwest of North America.\nThe amount must have been dozens of tons, and this was not the only offering piled up like a tribute.\nStardust, enough to forge hundreds of armaments, pearls and coral from the sea, brought by the Kikiruks. Mountains of gold.\nThey were the riches of the world, to be sure, but all the more precious because the gods had blessed them and allowed them to be harvested.\nFor this moment, it was as if the land had returned to the glory days of Lionheart, as if it were trying to recreate them.\nLeon went to the center of it and saw stones surrounded by all sorts of precious things.\nThe responsibility that Karina, Archduke of Dragonia, had carried for two hundred years, for those who had followed her.\nFor their souls, Karina surrendered herself, soul and body, to the dragon.\nLeon does not deny his daughter's life and sacrifice for them, knowing that it is not a worthless task, but an honorable duty as a nobleman, as an archduke, as royalty.\n\"Archdukenay, my lord, this is my grandson, Delvoske, and he will be in charge of Lady Karina.\"\nThere was a butler who had served the Grand Duke for generations.\n\"I beg your pardon, Gaspar. I will serve Grand Duchess Karina with my life.\"\nThere was a knight from the North who had fought alongside him on the battlefield.\n\"You have done well, Your Highness, and the North is honored to have such a great Lionheart King.\"\nThere were vassals who had long been advisors to the Archduke.\nThey served the Archduke of Dragonia to the end, and their shining lives were fading.\nAs the first Archduke of Dragonia, Leon must remain loyal to them to the end.\n\"Once upon a time there was a great war.\"\nIt was a harsh time for all. Everyone in this room faced a foe that was unstoppable.\n\"Many times we fought, defended, and proved our honor, no matter how hard it was.\"\nIn the midst of a harsh battle with the demons, in the midst of the end of the world, they didn't run away, they fought.\nHow honorable and proud that is.\n\"These here are the spirits who fell in that fight, spirits who still roam the Nine Heavens.\nThirty thousand knights, nobles, and soldiers from the Grand Duchy of Dragonia and its subordinate families.\nOn that day, old comrades fell one by one, in a realm beyond the care of the gods.\n\"Know this. Our enemy is a common enemy, across all dimensions.\"\nIn the days ahead, Earth will face a clash of cultures and a new world of survivors, but there is one thing that must be dealt with first.\n\"Demons. The cause of it all, the invaders who have caused so many to lose their homes. The souls of these men here are heroes who died fighting against them.\"\nLeon picked up a stone. The name was familiar, it was the name of a friend of Leon's.\n\"Gods. Our grateful, gracious gods who love us and watch over us. Here are the warriors of the gods, returning to your bosom after a long wander.\"\nAnd that's not all. Every single name here was a soldier, knight, vassal, or rider of Leon's.\nFor them, Leon willingly dropped to one knee.\nPlease take away their souls. If they have sins while alive, please wash them away with your sins. Appreciate their bravery even in the face of death so that they can enjoy a feast with the gods.\nFrom the Magic Stones that Karina named Middle Stones, a place of temporary sojourn, a soul's light rose.\nThe moment when the soul flowed into the Holy Grail on the altar was an amazing moment that everyone admired.\nThe reverent moment of the soul being embraced by God brought tears to the eyes of the onlookers.\nWhile everyone was intoxicated by the miracle before them, Leon looked at their departing souls without speaking.\n\"Lets have a drink sometime.\"\nSince we are mortal, we promise to meet the end we deserve.\n* * * * *\nKarina closed her eyes at the departing souls since she could not bear to see their last.\nKarina had made a deal with the dragon to trap their souls in stone.\nShe did this because she could not bear to see their souls scattered and returned to nothingness, and she feared that they would be trapped in that cramped stone for all eternity.\nI have succeeded.\nBut in the end, the Agent of the Gods returned with a paradise for their souls.\nTwo hundred years of sinful, sorry years come to an end.\nNow she was tired.\n\"The winter weather is cold.\"\nAt that moment, Leon stepped forward and draped his suit over Karina's shoulders. The warmth of the suit warmed her skin.\n\"Thank you. Their souls will now rest in peace.\"\n\"It was the right thing to do. You did what this king should have done.\"\n\"\"\nKarina glanced at Leon, who sat next to her.\nThere was no rebuke, no resentment in his eyes.\nNo resentment for herself, for the Northern Army, for slipping out of the Alliance to seek revenge that day, on the brink of a desperate fight.\nIn the end, he prevailed.\nShe didn't trust him and left his side to seek her own revenge.\nWhen the prodigal son returns, you greet him with no anger, no scorn, only joy and gratitude.\nBut\nEven though you consider it unforgivable, I\n\"Take it.\"\nThe words rolled around in her mouth as Leon pulled a candy out of his hand.\n\"Suddenly\"\n\"It's your favorite candy since you were a kid. I chewed a lot of candies looking for a similar flavor.\"\nAs Karina casually popped the candy into her mouth, she realized that it was indeed the flavor she remembered.\nNot the flamboyant sweetness of modern times, but something plain and blandmore like a nibble than a candy, something that might have been a staple food in the Northern Grand Duchy.\nFar from the fancy desserts of the royal court, it was a flavor commonly consumed in the northern provinces.\n\"Did you find it yourself?\"\n\"The sweetness lingers on my tongue, but it wasn't too hard to find.\"\n\"Hoo-hoo\"\nKarina laughed, remembering her father popping dozens of candies in and out of his mouth to find the taste of old memories.\nIt was so good to hear that laugh, and it made Leon feel like his hard work was worth it.\n\"It's delicious.\"\n\"I'm glad you like it. Is there anything else you want?\"\n\"Of course not. It would be greedy to ask for more.\"\n\"You are my daughter. What a daughter asks of her father is not greedy.\"\n\"Im also an unfaithful daughter who deserted her father in his hour of need.\"\n\"\"\nLeon knew what Karina's words meant.\nThe Northern army that had left the Alliance before the final battle and the Archduke who had led them away from the Lionheart King.\nThe Lionheart King knew what Karina was guilty of.\n\"I still remember what I said to you then.\"\nI don't want to see you again. Disappear from my sight, were Leon's last words to her.\n\"I regret it even now. Knowing that I would not see you for so long, knowing that it would be the last time, I said such a rash thing.\"\n\"It's not your fault.\"\n\"It is also this father's fault.\"\n\"\"\nLeon stroked Karina's dark hair. She had her mother's coloring, and he could see much of it in her dark hair.\nThe upright posture, the strong air, the blue eyes, the natural strength.\nThe proof of his love for his wife is so clear that he can recognize her blood at a glance.\nIt's a love so precious that a mistake doesn't matter.\nParents can never give enough love to their children.\n\"This father's love will never change, no matter when or what happens. You may abandon me, but I will never abandon you.\"\nThere's not a bit of that anger left in Leon. The only feelings he has left from two hundred years ago are remorse and regret.\n\"My daughter. My dear child, the one I thought I would never see again. What parent in the world can feel anything but joy?\"\nTo the returned prodigal, the father offers no rebuke.\nFor a parent's unconditional love is always infinite.\n\"\"\nKarina leaned her head against Leon's shoulder without a word, recalling happy memories from the distant past, now only a memory.\n\"Thank you, Dad.\"\nThat was enough for all the fathers in the world.",

      "content": "< War Cloud >\nSince the division in 1950 South Korea and North Korea have had a long confrontational relationship.\nAs North Korea began developing nuclear weapons and South Korea also increased its military power in step with it the security of the Korean Peninsula which was like a powder keg that could explode at any moment was buried before a catastrophe that struck the earth 30 years ago when the 21st century was about to begin.\nThe phenomenon of gates and all kinds of monsters popping out of them. Even contamination by demons.\nIn Asia Korea which was the second most prosperous country after Japan was also reeling from the waves of cataclysm.\nThis cataclysm was literally a money-eating hippo but recruiting awakeners who awakened as hunters.\nThe cost of training them. Satellites and maintenance costs to arm them and proactively catch gate occurrences.\nAt the same time as the gate occurred it literally absorbed the nation's economic power such as traffic control area security and buffering of air-raid shelter facilities in preparation for the dungeon break.\nIn other words.\nThe poorer the country's infrastructure the poorer the country's treasury the poorer the administrative power to control a sufficient Awoken population.\nA single premise encompassing so many conditions.\nIf the country is poor it can't even cope with the gate situation.\nAnd no matter how much money you have if a black gate appears you will be on the road to destruction.\nNorth Korea in the 21st century was still no different from North Korea in the 20th century but rather became poorer. Even China which North Korea could depend on is torn into about 50 parts.\nThe only dependent place is Korea a compatriot like Russia.\nNorth Korea first opened its hands to Russia.\n“Hehe older brother. We were from the same communist bloodline so if you send us some Awakeners——”\nUgh. Is this the ‘People's Republic' of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea? It's a beggar. Get out of here. We have to sell tanks to South Korea.\nThere was no reason to cooperate with North Korea which is not even worth money in Russia whose economy is reeling from a cataclysm.\nRussia in the middle of learning the true taste of capitalism ruthlessly kicked out the North Korean envoys and North Korea endured under the name of self-reliance threatening South Korea with nuclear and missile threats—\n“Hey Ganna Shack from South Korea. A taste of Daepo-dong from our Great People’s Republic—”\nShut up your mouth. I'm busy right now!\nwhat?\nKorea at the beginning of the 21st century. It was a time when diversification of food sources was urgent due to the economic depression caused by the cataclysm and the contamination of mana.\nThere was no time to make a conciliatory gesture to the naughty neighbor in the yard where the whole country was in emergency due to the food crisis.\nRight now my nose is stone but North Korea the Korean people and Nabal and South Korea were thoroughly crouching down and crazy about hunter power reinforcement and food imports.\nWe need more... more hunters.\nAren't there hunters in Southeast Asia who are dissatisfied with the way they are treated? Buying them with cash? Diplomatic relations cut off? What to do?\nChina is ruined! Most of them have been lost but we have to bring in at least one more person from there!\n10 years of chaos. South Korea while watching its neighboring country China collapse under a single black gate cut the defense budget to increase the Hunter Department budget prevent the outflow of talent and at the same time overdo headhunting.\nmoney. we have a lot of money Once you come I'll give you an apartment in Gangnam a medal and a pension!\nEven if North Korea fires missiles and threatens artillery fire I can't hear it I can't hear it! It's been ten years that we've been shouting out loud and strengthening our power.\nNorth Korea raised the white flag first.\nI'm giving up nuclear weapons... Please send me a Hunter.\nKorean Peninsula in 2032.\nNorth Korea was in a state of economic and security dependence on South Korea.\n* * * *\nIt's been a while.\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that he is leading Korea's representative teenage guild and the largest faction Kang Jin-seong the leader of the Cheongseong guild with a face soaked in memories in the clear and clean air.\nHey! I don't come here unless I'm touring Mt. Geumgang so is there anything else I can think of besides memories?\nCheon Jin-soo argues whether he doesn't like Kang Jin-seong.\nUnlike you I have a lot of family members. I don't have time to come here to take care of each North Korean pig.\nFor Korean hunters the mission to support North Korea is a kind of volunteer work.\nYou can take all the by-products obtained from the gate but there were no South Korean hunters who liked being dispatched to North Korea where the infrastructure was not working properly.\nHey~ Hey he said he hasn't called since the last time he came and asked Kim Jong Il or something to give him back money. No wait a minute? You can't believe it?\nRecalling the blatant controversy of his snarky friend Cheon Jin-soo thought of a possibility and was stunned.\nIs there a need to make a lot of trouble? If you don't want to see each other it's best not to meet.\nI tried my best not to do volunteer work! You look like such a clever old woman!\nHunters dispatched to North Korea are basically in rotation. However when it was an S-class hunter there had to be a request from North Korea and a consultation with the Korean Hunter Association.\nBut what if you are a person who is extremely opposed to North Korea?\nWhat if I beg you not to let this guy go?\nChun Jin-soo looked at Kang Jin-seong the representative Korean hunter with a shocked look in his eyes who came out of North Korea as if he was kicked out after openly playing a game.\n“No but what kind of wind came in this time?\n“I came to see Mt.\nIt was a kind of armed demonstration.\nAfter the cataclysm while North Korea gave up its nuclear weapons and signed a humiliating security cooperation with South Korea it sent a powerful S-class hunter that they could never raise to North Korea which is slowly being eroded.\nDepending on the outcome of the meeting this superhuman unit which can decapitate the North Korean leader and return to South Korea has always prevented North Korea from taking unexpected actions.\nIf the South Korean government stops dispatching raiding parties to North Korea which is suffering from a perpetual hunter shortage North Korea will wither that day.\nThe difference in national power between the two Koreas had already become an insurmountable wall and North Korea which had almost no population and infrastructure did not have the ability to train hunters on its own.\nThe hunters who were raised right away rebelled that their hair was a little thicker and one company was often blown away that day so North Korea had no choice but to regard the magic awakeners as reactionaries and they had to rely entirely on the Korean hunters.\nAnyway before I die will we be unified?\n“Isn’t the Kaesong Industrial Complex and Gaema Plateau development partners gradually reducing the economic gap? I wonder if it will take another ten years.”\nNo I don't think that's going to be a problem anymore. You know my older brother?\nolder brother?\n“I mean Brother Leon.”\n······.\nNo matter how you look at it Kang Jin-seong was not used to the fact that Lion Heart whose face value is in his 20s is 300 years old and Cheon Jin-soo who treats him as his older brother.\nAlthough this friend who is also a brat to herself was thrilled when she was in the reverse of a brat.\nStop drinking alcohol and arrive soon. Shouldn't you see Kim Ga-nom bowing before the government officials?\nIt's nice to see the red pigs bowing down.\nIt was the moment the two of them got off the chartered plane at the airport.\n-Clap!\nThe two had to face the sight of the North Korean soldiers surrounding them pointing their guns at them.\nHello. I'm Park Sang-gyo director of the 2nd Bureau of Reconnaissance General Bureau of the Korean People's Army.\nOne of the top 5 executives in North Korea's power hierarchy. He cast a sharp gaze at the two of them.\nSince there is no time South Korean distinguished guests should follow us.\nDozens of Awakeners belonging to the General Bureau of Reconnaissance were lined up nearby.\n* * * *\nAfter Dragonia the god of gold and contracts was announced the whole country was in a frenzy.\nThe business world studied how this absolute compliance contract works and also found out that it is a contract that anyone who is a fan of the pantheon can issue.\nand.\nMush!\nThe result of an experiment on how feedback is delivered by a giant American YouTuber who intentionally violates the Pantheonden contract.\n- Hahaha fell down.\n-Are you dead?\n- Quickly report to the police!\n- Call an ambulance!\nThe gigantic YouTuber who immediately received feedback as the contract burned was in cardiac arrest until the ambulance arrived and he jumped up when the ambulance pressed the doorbell.\nHeh heh!\nThe YouTuber miraculously survived as viewers watched.\nHe gasped for breath when he realized he had been left unattended for 15 minutes in cardiac arrest but immediately broke into a cold sweat at the cool sensation on his back.\n[This is the last one.]\nThe shape of a dragon that appears to viewers as a black mist. The voice clearly audible to the YouTuber had nothing to say about what it was warning about.\nOh this is real. Feedback comes right away. Ah from now on if I use this contract I will keep it unconditionally.\nEveryone learned about the power of the Dragonia contract at the conclusion reached by a super-large YouTuber with 10 million subscribers──\nFrom now on all contracts with the company will be concluded with Dragonia contracts.'\nWhen an advertising agency that quickly checked issues announced that it would sign all in-house contracts with Dragonia contracts the stock price began to hit the upper limit and everyone started to follow suit.\n“To run a company you have to become a fan of the pantheon.\nWhile the whole world turned its eyes to the new financial revolution huge inquiries came in to the pantheon and Yapi had to work even on the plane.\nSir Yapi. What are you doing?\nTo Hari's question Yapi gave a short answer.\n-Dragonia contract work in progress.\nReally? It looks like he's just standing still.\n-Processing work on network-attached storage. Currently 9657 contracts are under review.\nWow that's great.\nHari has heard that Yapi handles most of the work in the pantheon.\nAdvanced strong artificial intelligence that can simultaneously perform all kinds of multi-tasking such as satellite search missions in the earth sphere fund management and factory system management.\nIf it wasn't for Yapi who would have been able to touch it?\nIf you're not busy His Majesty is calling. Would you like to follow me for a while?\n-Kick!\nYaffy squeezed the seat belt with his mechanical leg unfastened it and climbed on top of Hari's head.\nHari naturally delivers Yapi in front of Leon. In the first class of the plane Leon was overlooking the Pacific Ocean as he soared.\n“Your Majesty I brought Lord Yapi.”\nokay.\nLeon looked at Yaffi who came down from above Hari's head.\nSir Spinner. I called because I have something to check before arriving in Korea.\n-Kick?\nDo you remember what Jim ordered before? What the pilgrim knight Goo Dae-seong reported.\nIf that was the case Yapi had already done it.\n- As a result of full-scale re-observation of the northern part of the Korean Peninsula no abnormalities were found. North Korea as usual.\nYeah is that so?\nLeon looked unconvinced as to whether there was something he cared about in Yapi's report.\nYapi's information warfare cannot be compared with any technology on Earth.\nThe geosphere search function of the integrated space armed platform located in space was unparalleled by any satellite in the world and direct observation using a drone system was carried out secretly without being noticed by any intelligence agency.\nAfter the Koo Dae-seong incident the entire North Korean region was searched but the conclusions the reconnaissance system grasped were the same.\nNorth Korea is still nothing different from usual.\nThat's strange. Is there anything different from usual?\n-It is.\nLeon asked about the blind spot that was missed because it was a machine that insisted on thoroughly objective information.\nBy other standards in Sir Spinner's opinion can North Korea's resources prevent a massive gate incident without much damage?\n-Kick?\nYapi immediately substituted North Korea's available power the ‘hunter's number' put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the gate incident that had occurred several months ago.\nKorean hunters had already been dispatched to North Korea and if you add up their power the last large-scale gate incident was not an event that North Korea could not prevent.\n‘According to the statistics claimed by North Korea'.\nSir Spinner. There are countries in the world who spread false statistics to save face.\n-·······.\nYapi only then began to calculate the possibility of the ‘statistic trap' registered on the network.\nThe number and level of people's fighters that the North Korean government claims to save face. Considering that was greatly exaggerated——\n-Economic and human damage in North Korea is too slight.\nSomething is wrong. This rudimentary mistake occurred because it is strong artificial intelligence that controls all information with perfect and absolute technology.\nThe moment Yapi tried to substitute the calculation formula again excluding the ‘imaginary numbers' that the North Korean government insisted on—\n- Satellite observation. The occurrence of sea level waves in the nearby sea. wake tracking. A number of SLCMs (Submarine Launched Cruise Missiles) approaching.\nancient?\nHari is white. A cruise missile in the middle of the Pacific? Isn't this the territory of the US Navy?\n- Beep! Beep! Beep!\nAnd as if Yapi's observations were not false the threat alarm sounded on the charter plane. The US Air Force fighter jets escorting the chartered plane immediately responded to the alert announcing the missile's approach.\nBut-\n-Many enemy cruise missiles. Evasion of all interceptions of allied aircraft. Conversion of integrated armed platform to intercept posture.\nThrough satellite observation Yapi continuously grasped the movements of the approaching missiles. Since the interception by the US Air Force fighter jet failed Yapi also started intercepting the missile through an attack satellite.\n- Kwah!\n-Kwaaa!\nA particle cannon that slams down from space. Hypersonic energy particle cannons which cannot be avoided by modern scientific civilization were rained down on the approaching missiles.\n- Quaang!\n- Kwak!\nCruise missiles intercepted one after another. However several missiles moved quickly through the plume of exploding missiles.\n- Approaching. 15 seconds to crash.\nThe moment Yapi posted the report Leon stretched out his arm and the missile crashed into the chartered plane almost at the same time.\n-Quaaaaaaang!!\nAir Force Unit 2 which was flying with the knights of the Pantheon crashed to the sea level with a huge explosion that exploded over the Pacific Ocean.",

      "content": "< Surprise >\nWhat? Lost contact with the North Korean delegation?\nOffice of the President. President Andong-gil looked up at the news that the New Year's envoy sent to North Korea had lost contact.\nIsn't communication just blocked? It's not like yesterday or today that your hotline is unstable.\nAfter China was torn apart even if North Korea which had no place to lean on gave up its nuclear weapons and calmed down the outdated infrastructure remained.\nEven today if the weather is bad the base station is often blown up and communication is interrupted and there are not many hotlines between the two Koreas in the first place.\nEven for the South Korean government which seeks gradual North Korean collapse and integration this problem is difficult to resolve.\nThis is because North Korea refuses help other than Hunter and somehow uses the energy to extend its power.\nIn Paradise on Earth which is maintained by the grace of the leader Abai the less news of the South Korean rebels the better.\n“Isn’t there any unsavory movement in North Korea?”\nYes! All of North Korea is being monitored by US military satellites. There is no movement.\nThen there's no problem?\nIn response to the aides' answers President Andong-gil didn't take it seriously.\n“More than that what about the Pantheon? When does the Pantheon come back?\nYes we departed from Dulles Washington Airport tonight. US Air Force escorts and our Air Force aircraft will take over.\nThe aide added one thing.\nThe Japanese government has proposed a joint escort. What would you do?\nGhmm... the intention is obvious.\nLeon decided to make an official New Year's schedule with President Andong-gil. After the announcement of Dragonia the god of gold and contracts governments and business people around the world want to contact Leon and President Andong-gil can say that he is very attached.\nBefore anyone else you'll be able to contact Leon the leader of the pantheon and discuss the Dragonian Contract which is tantamount to a financial revolution.\n‘Relay costs for commissions hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.'\nMansinjeon does not officially pay taxes but the corresponding expenses are appropriately packaged and paid to the Korean government.\nIn addition the contracts signed by Manshinjeon Headquarters all over the world and their 1% fee have no choice but to go through Korea.\nTruly an enormous amount of goods will pass through Korea so even that rice cake dumpling can be used as a record of one's achievements.\n“The Japanese side must have intended that as well right?”\nYes they are probably confident that they will be able to meet first after Korea. At least they would like to invite the executive level of Manshinjeon in the official New Year's work.\nQueen Beatrice and Sir Yacht Spinner are practically the same as agents of the Lion Heart King. They must be in a position to invite one of them.\nIt's not just Japan. Nearby Russia Taiwan and other European countries were eager to contact the pantheon.\nThe fact that ministerial-level figures with strangely high positions flocked to the presidential official New Year's ceremony right away made the intention obvious.\nHehehehe...\nPresident Andong-gil realized the national prestige that goes up to the visitation intentions flocking from all over the world.\nWhen the head of the association Oh Kang-hyeok went all-in to Mansinjeon to die I wondered if that old man was crazy but now I see that it was the foresight of an old man.\n‘A rising national rank! My achievements are piling up! It's very stable!'\nWhat to do when Leon and the pantheon arrive? First of all since the red carpet is laid out and preparations are made for the welcome party a dinner party is held and the new survivor Grand Duke Karina meets.\nThe most important thing is how to manage Dragonia contracts in the future.\nNo matter what you do as long as you do the basics Korea's economic growth rate will hit its peak in the new year. Is there anything easier than this?\nMake sure Minister Kim of the Ministry of National Defense undergoes protocol training yes! If there are ministers going back to their hometowns to meet their families at the welcome ceremony tell them that they will be fired at my hand!\nYes yep...!\nBut the next day President Andong-gil faces a crisis of a lifetime.\n* * * *\nThe work of the armistice line which split the Korean peninsula in half and divided the nation has been similar for 80 years.\nBoth sides have soldiers patrolling in front of the demilitarized zone.\nIn the past there were many cases of provocations against the South such as wooden box mines but as North Korea began to be subordinated to the South Korean hunter contingent such provocations almost disappeared.\nAt best it was only to shoot a few shells at the sea level around Yeonpyeong Island. Even this North Korea was keeping a reasonable line while paying attention to the South Korean government.\nWhoaam~\nA GOP guard post near the armistice line. Sergeant Kim who was about to be discharged after serving in the military for 1 year and 10 months looked up at the clear and clean starry sky and became sentimental.\nYou're going to be discharged soon but you're insulting me.\nHehe by tomorrow I'll use up all the vacations I've planned and this boring military life will be over. Park Il-hoon~ You stay and I go~\nAh jjom...!\nAlthough peace with North Korea has been going on for a long time the South Korean military is still wary of the North Korean military.\nAnyway it was also the significance of the existence of the Armed Forces and there were several provocations against the South whenever I was bored.\nSurprisingly however the GOPs along the armistice line were at peace as North Korea's main provocations were limited to sea level artillery fire that resulted in no casualties along the coastline.\nIn the past there was a lot of talk about wooden box mines but the North Korean military was also avoiding provocations that caused casualties as much as possible paying attention to the South Korean government.\nAs long as there is nothing special the military life with the elk and the wild boar will end smoothly.\n-Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!\nFrom the quiet demarcation line to the grotesque noise. They didn't doubt that.\nNo someone did a tiller in the middle of the night...\n“You crazy bastard someone drives a cultivator in this town!”\nAt Sergeant Kim's harsh criticism Corporal Park turned his gaze toward the source of the noise. and······.\nHa... fuck.\n-Yi Lee Yi Ying!\nDozens of aircraft were heading towards their ceasefire line.\nWatching North Korean transport planes suddenly approaching at dawn the two enlisted men recalled a fighter pilot who defected from North Korea with a MiG 50 years ago.\n* * * *\nAircraft pilots from North Korea were escorted to Suwon Air Base by an emergency squadron of South Korean fighters.\nDozens of planes made a soft landing at the Suwon combat airfield and one MiG plane whose landing gear was damaged due to aging crashed into the airfield but no one died and was safely delivered to the NIS.\nSo Mr. Lee Sang-hyeok came as a defector? Do you all mean the same thing?\nThat's right! I came down like this by fighting spirit with my comrades in the Air Force. Trust me!\nAh yes yes...\nIt is not unusual for North Korean defectors to escape from North Korea today but it was the first time in the history of the 80-year division that a group like this was brought in by plane.\nThe NIS investigators intended to thoroughly investigate the truth and decided to cross-examine the 40 North Korean pilots separately.\nIf there is a lie someone will expose the loophole.\nBut they exposed too many loopholes.\n“That that’s why from the 5th corps Mr. Park Jin-sang——”\n“You just said that you were in Ryu Gyeong-soo’s division. No are you already changing what you said a few minutes ago?”\nThat it's not that...!\nSince my house is not far from Pyongyang... no did Abadi live in Wonsan? No that... Kaesong? Nope...\nI have come down with a special order. Very important to pass on to the South Korean comrades-I have come down with a special order to pass on to the South Korean comrades-\n······Mr. Ri Jin-soo?\nIt was 1:00 pm on the 28th three hours after the mass defection of North Korean fighter pilots.\nThe pilots who defected from North Korea stopped like a broken watch.\nAll 40 pilots exactly at the same time. The sight of the walls stopping all at once was bizarre to the NIS agents watching through the magic mirror.\nWhat what? Why are you like that all of a sudden?\nFor now tell them to come out inside! Something's strange!\nInstinctively the command of the executive who sensed ‘danger' was meaningless and the bomb planted on the ‘traitors' was activated.\n“Ah I knew——”\nThe eyeballs of the pilot in despair exploded.\n- Weeing! Wheein!!\n“Shouting to all agents in the facility! A demon arises inside! Monster Outbreak! Move the Awakened Suppression Units quickly!”\nDecember 28 2032 at 1 PM.\nA monster occurred at the NIS building in Naegok-dong. Pollution sources are expanding.\n* * * *\nFuck fuck fuck!!\nThe president is a position that requires dignity. Pro-opposition reporters would open fire if reporters found out that he was swearing around in the government building not in his office.\nThe fortunate thing is that this is the Yongsan Joint Chiefs of Staff Headquarters a military facility.\nAside from that I thought there would be no Korean high-ranking people who wouldn't swear at me right now even in the opinion of my aides.\nThere was a sudden large-scale North Korean transport plane defection in the middle of the night.\nAlthough we do not know the details the Ministry of National Defense viewed it as the largest North Korean defection since the division of North and South Korea as there was no actual damage.\nbut······.\nAre you sure? That there was a monster in the investigation room?\nYes this is an issue directly reported by the second deputy director of the NIS. Currently the Awakened unit directly under the NIS is suppressing it.\nThat's not enough. Call in the hunter guilds around you too! You can't push armored units into downtown Seoul!\nPresident Andong-gil immediately issued a state of war and the president moved to the underground bunker of the Joint Chiefs of Staff according to wartime protocol.\nThere were already generals including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and they jumped up to President Ahn's position.\nAre you here Your Excellency!\nUpon receiving the greeting from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff President Ahn passed it over with a rare gesture and immediately sat down at the table of honor. It is the first time that President Ahn has been here since a black gate occurred in the middle of Seoul about a year ago.\nI heard roughly but please explain briefly.\nYes 27 minutes ago all North Korean pilots who defected died.\n“At the same time there is a report that an unknown monster has occurred inside.\n·······.\nsomething ambiguous\nNorth Korean aircraft disguised as large-scale defection and infiltrating and the pilots destroy themselves all at once?\nOf course this scale of provocation against the South was the largest in the history of the 80-year armistice. In terms of scale it far exceeded the Panmunjom ax incident or the Yeonpyeong Island shelling.\nHowever the scale was ambiguous for this to be an attempt at an all-out war.\nIf the damage was to neutralize a single NIS building with only dozens of suicide bombers it would be damage.\nOf course since monsters appeared it was not an issue to be taken lightly but there were over 10000 hunters in Seoul.\nIs there a hotline on the North Korean side right now?\nWe haven't been able to connect since the delegation lost contact.\nThe timing was also odd. President Ahn began to get confused.\n“Are these bastards scrambling for food?”\nThat's why the scale of this provocation...\nNo that's why even a declaration of war is an ambiguous scale. It could be a terror attack by hardliners inside.\nIt was an ambiguous incident that was too large to be an extension of the almost ceased provocations against South Korea over the past 20 years and too small to be a declaration of war.\nFor now until DEF CON 3... I have to issue it right?\nThis alone is a state of quasi-war on par with the Panmunjom incident. A wartime posture that has never been issued since the Battle of Yeonpyeong. However the situation is not too serious to issue a lower grade.\nDefcon 3 or Watchcon 2? When President Ahn fell into agony——\nYour Excellency! Emergency contact from the Korean People's Army! An unidentified submarine shot down Air Force Unit 2!\n······uh?\nAir Force Unit 2.\nIn other words it is one of the high-ranking chartered flights of the Korean government. It was the charter plane that recently carried the Pantheon from Washington International Airport.\nEh the pantheon?\nThat that's...\nPresident Ahn was distorted with astonishment at the reaction of the aide who was hesitant to answer. The moment he was about to say something——\n-thud!\nYongsan Joint Chiefs of Staff Underground Bunker. Above them an unusual explosion rang out.\n-Wheein~! Weing! Wheein!\nAnd an emergency sound echoed throughout the government building. At the same time the telecommunications soldiers were passing on emergency information while completely white.\n“This the landing of monsters at Incheon Port has been confirmed!”\nA large-scale monster wave occurred near the Demilitarized Line! It's over 100000! Radar caught it too late!\nThere is a mysterious bombing attack inside Seoul! Citizens... there are reports that citizens have turned into monsters!\nA similar explosion occurred in Naju City! A large army of monsters is said to be marching towards the Pantheon!\nA wave of so much information came all of a sudden.\nBad news poured out as if an incident had become the starting point.\nAnd this was by no means an external unrest.\nAn unidentified unit has attacked the government building! It's a human! It's a human not a monster!\nAs if they had been waiting a unit made up of humans raided the Joint Chiefs of Staff. What this meant was clear.\nAside from how and why.\nThe raid on the government building where the president and military generals gathered at this timing meant only one thing.\nIt's a war.",

      "content": "< Never 'X' Retreat >\nSeogwipo City Jeju Island. Golden Lion Guildmaster Golden Chul swung a huge two-handed hammer at the attacking Merman.\nSissha!\nBang! With the sound of meat exploding Merman's head disappeared. Around him dozens of Mermen were already tattered pieces of meat.\nGeumsun-ah!\nYeonha! Yeonha! Hwang Yeon-ha! You jerk!\nHwang Yeon-ha the deputy guild leader of the Golden Lion who was recently promoted to an S-class hunter took a stand against the title of his damn brother who was still the same even after becoming an S-class hunter.\nHave you contacted team leader Park? I heard there are monsters in Jeju City as well.\nThey said they rode the car and ran right away. The airport was secured without any problems.\n“What is this all of a sudden?”\nThe Golden Lion Guild has recently come to Jeju Island to flex its words which can be said to be the symbol of knights as many hunters have been appointed knights of the Mansinjeon.\nAs I was about to go back after clearing a few gates and earning travel expenses something happened.\nA large number of monsters suddenly landed on the coast of Jeju Island.\nBoss! I'm contacting you from the governor of Jeju!\nChange it!\nGolden Chul received the subordinate Hunter's smartphone. Then a voice is heard over the receiver.\n[Wa are you CEO Hwang Hwang-cheol?]\nAh yes. It's golden iron Governor.\n[Yes yes... I am Park Jong-wook governor of Jeju-do.]\nThe voice over the receiver was servile and cautious. Golden Chul knows why he contacted him.\nThe fire has been put out urgently and we will return to the airport immediately. Our headquarters was also attacked and we have to deal with it.\n[That it can't be...]\nHunters reside in Jeju City but there are not many of them.\nThis is because the limits of the island and the hunters from Busan were urgently dispatched.\nBut now the coast of Busan was also attacked by marine monsters. Fortunately if the Golden Lion Guild hadn't visited the ranch in Jeju Island Jeju City would have been defenseless.\nI have to say that I'm lucky enough with this alone but...\n[The Coast Guard has confirmed the approach of the monsters! It doesn't matter how much money it costs so please protect our island!]\n·······.\nGolden Chul hesitated to answer. Normally he would have received a higher amount of money and helped defend Jeju Island.\nBut now the whole of Korea has been attacked by monsters. It is on a different level from the previous large-scale gate incident.\nAt that time it was possible to reduce the number of monsters released in advance and prevent property damage by attacking the gate but now aren't monsters coming in droves?\nEven the government issued DEF CON 1 and entered a state of war. This means that monsters aren't the only enemies.\nI'm sorry. My family is concentrated in Sin Pangyo. I have to run right away to defend that side.\n[That it can't be...!]\nThe headquarters of the Golden Lion Guild is Pangyo. All of the guild's substantial assets were concentrated there.\nIf Pangyo could not be protected from the attack of monsters right away the Golden Lion Guild would have to endure not only personal damage but also enormous property damage.\nAs a guild leader the decisions he made were never wrong. But-\nBrother...\nHwang Yeon-ha grabbed the cuff of Geumcheol. My younger brother who received an official knighthood letter from Manshinden last month. He himself was knighted directly by King Leon.\n“Protect the weak do no injustice.”\nThe cheek that was hit then is still tingling. His mouth was torn and bloody and his tattered cheeks made him realize that no matter how good the opponent was nothing was in moderation.\n“It means to keep in mind. You value your calling and duty more than your life. If you follow honor surely everyone will follow you.”\nAt the ceremony not only himself but also his younger sister and guild members were present.\n······ Damn it.\nGolden Iron raised the hammer. The star iron hammer worn on his shoulder is still strong even after blasting so many monsters.\n“Where is the planned landing?”\n[Hwa CEO Hwang...!]\nAfter Hwanggeumcheol hung up the phone the subordinate asked cautiously.\nAre you okay? If Pangyo is blown away half of our guild's property will be gone.\nMoney. You can earn that again. There are more important things than that.\nPeople are more important I don't bring out such strange words. He grinned as he stroked her sister's hair.\nYou can't bounce while showing your back to the monsters. It's embarrassing.\nDue to Hwang Geum-cheol's decision the members of the Golden Lion Guild decided to remain in Jeju Island.\nSurprisingly it wasn't a waste of money to lose. The reason is clear-\nMaybe it's because you know it's worth more than money.\n* * * *\nA military technology analysis company has analyzed what the most important strategic goal in Korea in 2032 is.\nIt was an outsourcing request by the Ministry of Defense of Korea to analyze objective indicators and apply them to wartime planning but quite different results came out this year.\nOf course the number one strategic target is Yongsan where the Joint Chiefs of Staff and ROK-US Combined Forces Command are located.\nSince the presidential office building was moved from the Blue House to Yongsan in the early 20's South Korea is spending enough budget every year to defend this place including a large number of military police and hired hunter guilds as an even more important goal.\nIn addition there were several strategic goals such as the Jeju Island naval base and the 7th Mobile Corps but a target with new strategic value was created in Naju somewhat unexpectedly for a military goal.\nI saw Naju in Mansinjeon.\nSince King Lion Heart a survivor of the other world selected it as a guild site and the epic item Geobrick's Hammer was exhibited the sanctuary has accelerated and in less than half a year it has emerged as a religious sanctuary equivalent to the Vatican in the Italian peninsula and Jerusalem in Israel.\nHowever this place is not a holy place with a simple religious meaning.\nThousands of man-at-arms are nurtured here every quarter blessed crops that are even evaluated as Korea's strategic resources are growing and it is the base of knights who are specialists in the battle of the great devil.\nIn addition the Mokpo coast and the Yeongsan River the two major habitats inhabited by the Krashatria tribe a large migratory tribe of survivors... also known as the Kikiru warriors are nearby and Byeolcheol the most important strategic item is transported every day.\nMansinjeon in Naju is a religious economic political and military sanctuary that guarantees the future of the Republic of Korea.\nHowever not many people are concerned about the security situation here. It was because the Man-at-Arms and the Kikkiruk Warriors with hundreds of knights resident and now looking at 20000 men were a force that surpassed the army.\nbut.\nGather the battle team! Build a square!\nThe main force of the pantheon is always the knights. Premodern knights shouting the name of God while holding spears on horseback.\nTheir superhuman strength which surpasses modern weapons of war is the main force that determines the battlefield.\nBut what if ‘at the end' all of its main forces are overseas?\nChief Kim Jin-soo! Those who came up the Yeongsan River are landing! The Kikkiruk tribe is blocking it but we can't respond because our main forces are out!\nManager Kim Jin-soo who was dispatched from the Hunter Association and was appointed a knight of Mansinjeon following Hari was one of the few knights in this position.\nHe was dealing with monsters on horseback with about thirty knights but the response seemed daunting.\nThe fortunate thing is that Yapi has a map hack thanks to the hologram mapping that is always in operation.\nThe Yeongsan River is directly connected to Naju! Send an additional 100 troops! All the knights of the Kikkiruk tribe are on the aircraft carrier. Take five knights!\nHa but we're already dispatching troops for the fourth time! If the power continues to leak here's the defense...\nAfter Leon and the main force of the Knights headed for Washington Manshinden was steadily attacking the surrounding gates and dispatching troops.\nThe ones who actually reside here are the trainees and raiding parties that have returned for a break. Even so it is difficult to move to protect the tourists who are bursting.\n“The other guilds? When did Hanbitgung come?”\nIn this situation the only thing you can rely on is Park Yong-shin the lord of Hanbit Palace and his subordinate hunters.\nAlthough they were not appointed as knights due to the suspicion of following the devil the unit that maintained its fighting power in the pantheon where the main force escaped.\nJi they say they're coming right now but they're going to be late because they're on a business trip to Taiwan!\nshit!\nManager Kim Jin-soo tried to ask the president of the association for help but that person must have a good nose too. It's just that they didn't call back the staff of the association who were dispatched to the pantheon right away.\nNonsense. I've never heard of a nationwide monster wave like this!\nNot only Seoul but also Incheon Mokpo Naju Jeju Island... There is no place that has not been attacked at all.\nThe monster estimate estimated by the association is at least 100000.\nExcluding the marine monsters still moving along the coast and the monsters rushing through the minefields of the armistice line only the monsters that landed in South Korea were counted.\n‘If at least the dispatched troops come back...!'\nBut even that can't be wished for. The raiding party who went out to attack the gate couldn't hear the news from this side from the inside.\nIn this way the power vacuum of Manshinjeon which actively attacks the gate at the level of people's livelihood revealed its weakness.\nAnd Chief...! Over there!\nManager Kim Jin-soo who saw where the subordinate's finger was pointing was dumbfounded.\nA gate at this timing?!\nThe gate's distinctive shimmering was captured from a direction not far from the pantheon just a few thousand meters away.\nAnd it wasn't just the people of Mansinjeon including Manager Jinsu Kim who saw it.\nTourists and pilgrims who came for pilgrimage also saw it.\n- Oh it's okay. The gate originally occurred and it took more than 10 days until the dungeon break!\nSuch an obvious common sense Chief Kim's instinct rejected it.\nMassive defection and bombing by North Korean troops.\nThe downfall of the charter plane that burned the pantheon.\nA monster wave that attacks all of South Korea simultaneously.\nIn the meantime the Joint Chiefs of Staff where the president and generals gathered was raided by armed forces presumed to be spies.\nIn this worst situation monsters are rushing towards the pantheon as if they had coordinates. But what about the gate?\nIndeed is that gate an ordinary gate?\n-Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!\nDungeon break at the same time as gate summoning.\nThe demons pouring out from there met eyes with Manager Kim Jin-soo.\nSir fuck...\nThere was only one thing he could wish for. A subordinate who is not present here.\nDeputy Han come quickly and save me...\n* * * *\n- Kiki kick.\nThe army of demons who landed on the plains of Naju numbered well over 5000.\nHowever the High Demon who led them Helheart clicked his tongue as he looked at the men he had brought.\nGet in line. The scale of the gate is small because we have to come urgently. Troops are limited.\nTheir mission is one. Stealing the pantheon of ‘it'. To this end I threw many of the monsters accumulated during the last gate incident as bait.\nOf course the monsters thrown as bait would completely destroy this country.\nHellheart-nim. They... I can't see chaos.\nThe demons are not suitable for such a delicate invasion. Our goal is to quickly escape after capturing the target. You can't wage a war with these.\nHelheart lamented that most of the troops he led were half-horses.\nIn order for demons to be summoned to the material world a corresponding sacrifice is required.\nAt the time of the Great Demon hundreds of thousands of souls were needed. The damage suffered by the demons in the last great war was too great to exhaust the power of the great devil in the operation of throwing hitting and falling as bait.\nRight now the demons of Wisdom and Inquiry could only condescend with these meager troops.\n“But their houses are empty. There are no Lion Heart Kings or knights. Tell the half-horses to form a rank and move!\nThe half-horse army marching towards the pantheon. Hell Heart moved through the golden fields and pointed his baton at the target pantheon.\nBreak their resistance! There are a lot of civilians so it will be easy to make holes.\nOnly about 2000 troops remain in the Mansinjeon. Even so there were not even thirty knights left.\nBoth sides have low quality troops due to their own circumstances but the devil's side is overwhelming in terms of scale.\ncharge···!\nFollowing Helheart's command thousands of anti-horse corps charged toward the defense line spread by Chief Kim Jin-soo.\nHowever Helheart who had accumulated wisdom and experience for a long time easily drove the pantheon.\nUgh...! How can I stop that!\nThree times as many of them! They're targeting civilians so it's hard to maintain formation!\nThese damn devils...!\nIt's only been ten minutes since the battle started. Hellheart steadily destroyed Manager Kim Jin-soo and Man-at-Arms.\nEven in the midst of this the operation to seize ‘it' must be proceeding successfully.\n“Geukkeuk this is easier than I thought——”\nHey you fiends!!\nIt was the moment when Helheart smiled triumphantly. A group of people was approaching from afar.\nEven if they pretended to be soldiers they were lagging behind in their armament.\nIdiot farmers armed with pickaxes shovels and hoes. or citizens. In addition thousands of ‘scarecrows' protecting the farmland of the goddess Demera are bizarrely jumping and approaching.\nIt seems that the news that the village is in crisis wakes up but in the battlefield of these pros they are nothing but amateurs.\nuh?\nStop can't you?\nHowever a commotion arose among the half-horse legion.\nThe article... is not. If they were a unit of knights they would have to worry about the lives of the Hellhearts themselves before the battle line collapsed.\nThe half-horses were shocked because they felt that the people approaching from afar were somehow familiar ‘compatriots'.\nhalf horse\nNamely demon followers.\nTraitors who sold their souls and people to demons.\nUnexpectedly these halves who failed to acquire immortality and ended up in fire have a strong network with each other.\nIt has no choice but to be like that as they worship the demons and interact with each other in the demons' territory.\nMae MacGreuger? I heard you're missing?!\nWasn't he dead? Why over there!\nThey also knew through rumors. The fact that not too long ago the demon grand duke's territory was attacked dozens of villages burned and countless demons and demon grand dukes died.\nIt was a very unrealistic incident but it was an incident that was passed over as being in another territory.\nAnd the truth of the case is right in front of you.\nThese fucking fiends!\nFarmers of the goddess Demera. Leon built a pantheon in Naju and among those who benefited first and received the priesthood not a few became priests of the goddess Demera.\nlife and abundance. love and mercy. A priest of a benevolent church that satisfies the hungry... Among them Choi the oldest shouted in the name of the goddess.\nChunshik ask!\nThe absolute right to command was activated over the ‘serfs' leading from Lion Heart King - > Holy Grail Knight - > Knight Commander - > Knight Priest.\nThousands of Chunshik charge ‘without sparing their lives'. It was a fierce charge that not a single person could retreat.\n[Grail Knight Gratas' ‘How to catch a giant with serfs' grants a buff to serfs.]\n- Increases ATK against half horses by 157.777%.\n-Attack against demons increases by 101.666%.\nThe Holy Grail Knight Sir Gratas compiled and swallowed the blood of millions of people from generation to generation ordering a fratricide.",

      "content": "< President Andong-gil >\nIn the middle of the Pacific Ocean 2400 km east of the Kuril Islands.\nThe crew of the August 24 hero ship Shin Cheon belonging to the Korean People's Army Navy were not happy to see that the target had crashed.\nGwa are you okay? I heard that a very important person in South Korea is on that plane.\nI don't know. We just have to do what we order.\nSuddenly an order was given to sail and they came out of the coast of the Republic to the middle of the Pacific Ocean.\nIn the process how many more times have you almost been caught by a Russian or Japanese submarine?\nConsidering the specifications of Shin Cheon-ho it was a miraculous result just to come this far.\nA suicide mission that is virtually impossible to return to. Nevertheless Captain Shin Cheon-ho ordered the missile launch with a determined expression as if he had made a decision to save the country.\nWhat the hell is Captain Comrade thinking...\nWhat do you mean by me? Let's hope he hasn't lost his mind after drinking since someone came from the Escort Bureau.\nAugust 24 Hero ship Shin Cheon-ho's captain Park Sang-ki. He sensed the murmur of his men around him but silently gave the order.\nSearch for the downed South Korean aircraft. Move quickly.\n“Ha but comrade Captain.\nIsn't that important! Break through with the revolutionary spirit of the Republic!\nPark Sang-gi faced up to the fact that the lives of the Republic and 25 million people were at stake in this operation. This ship and his own life are not so important.\nComrades who made a decision will also be the same.\nIt was at that time when Captain Park Sang-ki approached his subordinates and Shin Cheon-ho was slowly moving toward the downed charter plane.\n-thud!\nThe huge hull shook and the Shincheon-ho trembled.\nWhat what! Did you even hit a whale?\nLord I haven't caught such a huge body around!\nThen what the hell!\nIt was then. Shin Cheon-ho started to move at a terrifying speed. A speed that far exceeded Shin Cheon-ho's speed. It was about the extent of being a gay being dragged while being caught by something in her.\nAaaaaaagh!\nShin Chun-ho rolled horribly and fell somewhere. Captain Park Sang-gi thought she had fallen from a waterfall but she thought it was ridiculous.\nA crash in this vast sea? Couldn't that be possible?\nHowever such obvious common sense was new blood compared to what would happen in the future.\n- Awesome!\nHa Comrade Captain!\nShin Cheon-ho is torn like a piece of paper. Everyone was frightened and imagined the sea that would soon rush in. In this open sea a damaged submarine drowns along with its crew.\nHowever no matter how long I waited it was not the sea water that came in but the fishy smell of the sea.\nUh huh?\nCaptain Park Sang-gi and the Shincheon-ho's submarine crew were dumbfounded. That's also true because what was visible outside the half-opened Shincheonho was the vast ‘land'.\n-Kick! Giggles!\n(You are surrounded. Surrender is recommended.)\nThe ferocious muzzle of the crustaceans often surrounded them in an instant.\nWhat the North Korean crew members lifted up their arms and were led out by their hands witnessed was the ocean parting and a huge sea wall forming revealing the bottom of the deep sea.\nAgainst the backdrop of terrible deep-sea fish the huge being that brought Shin Cheon-ho caught my eye.\nUm what is that?\n“How can there be such a big submarine?”\nIt's bigger than an American aircraft carrier!?\nDominator class submarine carrier. The super-giant submarine carrier that brought the Shincheonho here was looking this way from inside the sea wall.\nand. A blond-haired man standing calmly at the bottom of the deep sea exposed at the end of a sea split.\nThen let's listen. The worms who foolishly attacked the Lion Heart King.\nLeon and the knights of the Pantheon were glaring at the crew of the Shincheonho.\n* * * *\n- Stop it!\n-bang! Tattang!\nYongsan Joint Chiefs of Staff. All of Seoul is engulfed in flames of telephone calls.\nYongsan is the place where the core of the Korean leadership gathers in case of emergency. As a result the number of armed forces is insufficient and overflowing.\nThe ROK military which receives military equipment first through the partnership between the Korean government and Mansinjeon introduced a number of popular railguns and combat drones to the military police here.\nThe reason why the military police at the Joint Chiefs of Staff was able to hold on despite being raided was because of the superiority of their equipment.\n- Damn it so many!\nBut it was only a matter of time before they broke through. In the end unless you were a superman you couldn't overcome the difference in numbers and enemies weren't limited to outsiders.\n······.\nPresident Andong-gil watched half-horses entering the underground bunker every minute through CCTV.\nhalf man half horse.\nDemon followers were said to be corrupt beings who claimed to be slaves of demons.\nThe discovery of their identities hiding in governments around the world began with the dispatch of an investigation team by the UN Human Rights Commission.\nAfter it was revealed that the UN inspectors burned to death in the pre-modern witch hunt were in fact followers of the devil there was a massive demon hunt.\nWasn't the battle act of the pantheon that turned Taiwan upside down right away to subdue the demons that had dug deep into Taiwan's administration?\nHowever it seems that they have infiltrated human society more than I thought. That will be too-\n“This is it Your Excellency.”\nClap!\nWith the sound of a pistol being pulled the deputy chief of staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff aimed a gun at President Ahn. And that's not all. Dozens of field commanders and soldiers within the Joint Chiefs of Staff were watching this side at once.\nLieutenant General Park you bastard! What are you doing!\nThe Minister of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff screamed in fright but were overpowered by a soldier who struck the butt of a K2 rifle from behind him.\n······.\nSeeing this President Andong-gil was rather relieved. The fact that the Minister of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff the core of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are not traitors to humanity.\nI thinned out that way but there are still some Frakchi left...\nHehehe the devil's body is amazing Your Excellency. Even the immortal body that never ages is an incomparable blessing.\nThe deputy chief of staff and his men laughed at the giggling mortals.\nFrom their point of view rather ordinary humans are worms.\nEven if you serve the devil it will give you an immortal body but if you become the devil itself you will not die.\nEveryone on Earth knew it. That demons are beings that continue to resurrect even after they die.\nBut why is it tied to the species called human?\nYou guys weren't chosen we were. That's the difference.\nDeputy Chief of Staff... Deputy Chief Park laughed at them to the fullest and opened the sturdy iron door of the underground bunker with his own authority. Then the half-demons who could be called their seniors and the high-ranking devil the commander entered.\n“Hey I was a little nervous about receiving the divine protection but it wasn’t a big deal.”\nIn the position of the high-ranking demon the halves all knelt down and greeted the owner. Either that or not the high-ranking devil sent a burning gaze to President Andong-gil.\nOrder the Missile Command right now. Coordinates are Naju Mansinjeon. To strike thoroughly.\nwhat?\n“If you follow my orders I will make you a demon too.”\nunder······.\nWas this the purpose?\nOf course to start a war subduing the enemy's leadership is a natural goal.\nHowever I never thought they would blackmail them and give orders to attack their allies.\nFuck you.\nAt President Ahn’s insults the high-ranking devil made a surprised expression.\nYou've got quite a bit of courage to say you're not submissive. This is unexpected.\nsubmission?\nPresident Ahn asked for the cigar he had been fiddling with. He operates an 'emergency device' in the form of a lighter that he was ‘gifted' with.\nHehe. What to do with this there must have been a misunderstanding.\n-Wheein! Clap!\nA dull and elegant structure. It suddenly appeared in the middle of the underground bunker at the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n“What——!?”\nThe moment Lieutenant General Park the deputy chief of staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was about to stop the president at the appearance of a structure he did not know President Ahn pressed the button on an object that looked like a lighter.\n[Sacred water injection. Operation of the emergency demon destruction system.]\nOh no—\nOkay!\nA large amount of holy water injected into the structure. It created a wave of light and swept the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n-Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n-Kieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\nHalf-horses and demons screamed and collapsed. Some of them had their flesh pieces burst and others were on the verge of death to such an extent that even the high-ranking demons could not control themselves in the waves of holy light.\nSeeing them collapsed President Ahn grinned.\nI can't believe that fiends like you guys install and run around and I don't have any insurance?\nPresident Ahn who had been relaxing to the fullest with his hands behind his back pressed the button once again and a wave of holy water stirred the high-ranking devil.\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nLeon's gift to President Ahn with sincerity of affection always protected him.\nThe star iron sword which prevents the invasion of evil just by carrying it was always carried by aides and the holy power release device which can destroy low-level demons through holy water is hidden in the office of the president and underground bunkers.\nIf demons invade it is a product that Yapi personally manufactured calculating that they would target the president first.\nThanks to that President Ahn was able to wear a wicked smile leisurely even in front of high-ranking devils and half-horses far stronger than himself.\nIf I can't have the Dominion I'd rather burn it to ashes... No no this isn't it. Kheheum...! It's a national holiday so we were preparing for a traditional game.\nYes you bastard... for a human subject...!\nStop it now... die...!\nIt was the moment Andong-gil was about to reactivate the sacred force device.\n-click\n???\n-Click! Click!\n······Oh.\nHoly water has run out. I'm going to fill it up in advance.\nTurn it off...!\nUh-uh the fortune-telling is happening! Someone do something!\nVery Mr. President! Step down!\nDefense Minister Kim fired a pistol at the high-ranking devil. The trigger of the K5 pistol was repeatedly pulled and lead bullets were fired at the devil but no matter how much holy water was burned a high-ranking devil could not be killed by something like a pistol.\nThe halves were wiped out by two waves of holy water but even if that high-ranking demon rises everyone here will die!\nsomething! When I thought I had to do something——\nYour Excellency! Take it!\nPresident Ahn instinctively grabbed something thrown by his aide. It was a gift that I usually carried with me to receive blessings.\nIt is a star iron sword with 99.9% purity that the Lion Heart King personally blessed and gifted to President Andong-gil.\n- Keyring!\nThe feeling of the sword pulled out of the scabbard was familiar. It was only natural that Leon who heard President Ahn's history in the past made and handed it to him.\nOhhh... It's the first time I've caught it since the Chuseok event.\nHow harshly did he receive criticism after trying out this star iron sword given to him by Leon on the official line?\nThe old old man is scolded for being shivering and the opposition party says he felt threatened and says nonsense about being the president of the Yakuza...\nInternet malicious comments annoying reporters even unlucky members of the opposition party...\nAndong-gil 4th degree in Haedong-gumdo! I'll show you the skills of 7th place in the national competition!\nSeruk the blade of the drawn star iron sword shone brightly. Realizing that it was a sacred sword that could cut demons the high-ranking demon freaked out and backed away but it was already too late.\nKieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\nHi!\nPresident Andong-gil became the first president in history to have a high-ranking demon Killog.\n* * * *\nAs the sabotage of the devils who attacked the Joint Chiefs of Staff failed and the devil followers who infiltrated the military were also destroyed President Ahn quickly seized military power and took command.\nFirst of all send the hunters of the large guild to the core unit! Where is the president Oh Kang-hyeok now?\n[This is Incheon Port Your Excellency. I am also running in the field right now.]\nOh Kang-hyeok the head of the association a legendary Korean S-class hunter did his best to calm the situation by breaking the head of the landing monster himself.\nNot only them but also the raiding parties belonging to the Hunter Association.\n[Your Excellency the problem is the source of contamination that started in the Naju Mansinjeon and the National Intelligence Service building. We need to quickly subdue these two and clean them up.]\nIsn't it impossible to fire missiles in the middle of downtown Seoul? Tell the large guilds to head first. Isn't there a Cheongseong Guild branch in Gwangju?\n[Since Kang Jin-seong's guild leader lost contact in North Korea he's also been confused.]\nIt's a presidential order so tell them to go to the Naju Mansinjeon right now! It's a civilian right now and it's not the time to argue! If you don't listen tell them that you'll be kicked out!\nOh Kang-hyeok president of the association was surprised by President Ahn’s bold order.\nThe Korean president had to keep an eye on the 10th guild throughout his tenure a position he had never seen before.\nPresident Ahn was no different from any other high-ranking administration official who was infinitely smaller when he complained about something to the 10th guild but now he is unstoppable when he exercises the authority of the military commander.\nDoes a seat make a person? no that wouldn't be it The existence of a strong backing force called Mansinjeon made it impossible not to notice the surroundings.\n[I will tell you clearly Your Excellency.]\nOh Kang-hyeok president of the association broke the head of the monster that was running towards me with a warm smile. Their military communications were about to be cut off.\n-Kick! connection success.\n[Ah~ It's under the sea so now I can reach you.]\n[Your Majesty the Lionheart?!]\nAhn Dong-gil and Oh Kang-hyuk responded with delight at the familiar voice that interrupted the communication.\nAre you all right?\n[Missiles can't hurt Jim. Well I couldn't prevent the plane from being shot down.]\nI'm glad you're okay!\nOf course President Ahn did not even imagine that Leon would be killed by a missile. But at least I thought I would disappear for a long time in this chaos...\nYour Majesty with all due respect the situation here is not good. The return of Your Majesty and the Manshin Temple is urgent so we will immediately dispatch a fleet to begin a rescue operation. I will contact the Japanese government.\nOf course this would take a lot of time but it was better than having to constantly search for missing people.\n[You don't have to. Jim can return on his own. However since the situation is urgent I will have to send back someone who can be powerful right away.]\nYes? Is that possible?\n[Right now there's only one but it's not impossible.]\nAt those words President Ahn could not hide his disappointment. Of course the superhumans of the Pantheon are very strong but what kind of help would a single knight be in a great chaos like now?\nWhat can you do with just one minute...\nIt was the moment when I realized that what I had said inadvertently was a mistake.\n-GRARARARARARARA─────!!!!\nA booming voice comes through the receiver vividly. While feeling overwhelmed with that voice alone Lion Heart King confidently declared.\nAnything Jim can do.\nover the Pacific Ocean. A human-shaped flame soared toward the stratosphere and fell toward the Korean Peninsula in an apocalyptic trajectory.",

      "content": "< Battle of Naju >\nNaju Mansinjeon.\nThe Man-at-Arms and the local residents fought bravely against the demonic and anti-horse units that attacked.\nThe priests of Goddess Demera who use the Holy Law and the scarecrows who protect farmland with the blessing of the goddess were mass-produced by fanatical followers to the point of being useless.\nThe Frostman is dying!\nThe demons didn't specifically come to rob crops but at their point the demons were already frostmen who came to rob precious crops.\nBesides power isn't just a scarecrow.\nChunshik what!\nAaaaaaagh...!\nThe serfs who remained in the pantheon. They were forcibly charged by the highest-ranking Demera priest Choi.\nShackled by Tatar the god of heaven and judgment they cannot disobey the orders of their senior commanding authority. That is what makes them display semi-compulsory bravery. Above all-\n[Grail Knight Gratas' ‘How to catch a giant with serfs' grants a buff to serfs.]\n- Increases ATK against half horses by 157.777%.\n-Attack against demons increases by 101.666%.\nThe Holy Grail Knight Lord Gratas's Bible kept in the Pantheon. ‘How to catch a giant with a serf' spreads an attack power up buff to all serfs in the field.\n1576660 people to hunt half horses.\n1017770 people to hunt demons.\nA bible that has been handed down from generation to generation since the Grail Knight Sir Gratas and has shared the history of consumption of serfs in Lionheart Kingdom such as the Serf Festival.\nIts sacred and lofty power makes the worm meat shield serfs active as quite useful one-hit attackers.\nI'm going to give each one a shot! You worms demon seeds! When you die give me permission and kill you! Otherwise I'll kill you prematurely!\nHehehehe...! They're more like devils than these devils!\nThe serfs howled and charged at their own people.\nAs they died from the swords of their half-horses they left a desperate will.\nNever...! Never! Don't get caught by them!\nUgh ugh...!\nEven though the half-horses slaughtered the serfs they could not abandon their feelings of shame and regret. But that's just a very fragmented part.\n- Aaaaaaaaaagh!\n-stop! sorry! let me go!\n-no! No eh eh eh!!\nAt the same time as their deaths their souls were taken away from their bodies emitting a clear light that could be seen with the naked eye.\nThe sight of him struggling and struggling not to be dragged away seemed so desperate.\n-Three my God...\n-What is that.\n-Is the soul... sucked in?\nwherever?\nBut it wasn't enough for them to imagine their worst.\nUgh ugh...\nMoral bread that occurs in real time. They were plunged into chaos fear and confusion.\nIf it had been this far they would still have been able to try a tight power battle with Man-at-Arms.\nBut the bottom of the deep Pacific Ocean. Communication was restored and Yapi who noticed the situation in South Korea reacted immediately.\n-At risk. emergency response kit. Call compatible pilots.\n-Kick! Giggles (McDelof Hashimura Ohgent's response!)\n-Kick! Giggles (Glaster Basilisk All-For-One Response!)\nThe very few knight-level Kikkiruks who still remained in South Korea.\nWhen they responded serving Yacht Spinner as a savior and his faithful subordinates Yapi immediately ejected weapons from the Stealth Strategic Satellite the Space Integrated Arms Platform.\nIt rushed into the atmosphere in an instant and immediately arrived in front of the two warriors of the Kirk clan——\n- Support for Count-level war armament for Yacht Spinner. Pilot No. 13 McDeloff Pilot No. 19 Glaster confirmed.\nThis is a custom equipment developed for bondi yakt spinners.\nAlthough it is not the largest decisive battle weapon of the Marquis class since compatibility was the focus reinforcements other than Yapi were also considered.\n-Kick!\n-Kick look!\nThe latest star iron armament that can be installed in an instant. At the same time unmanned weapons launched together follow the two pilots.\n-2 squads of baron class support sub escorts. It goes under the command of the pilot.\nAn all-around combat escort the baron class followed the two warriors equipped with the war armament of the count class. In an instant they confirmed the anti-horse corps fighting in front of the pantheon.\n-Kick! (Initiate maximum firepower projection)\n-Kiruruk! (overwhelm)\nBaron-class unmanned robots unleashed firepower all at once.\nA star iron warhead processed from star iron. and a star iron grenade launcher. Borrowing some of Yapi's cutting-edge strong artificial intelligence computing power the Baron-class linked operation demonstrates knight-class potential.\n-Quaaaaaaa!!\noverwhelmed by the pouring firepower. Half-horses who have not even become demons cannot stand in front of this Holy Grenade.\n- Aaah! age! My flesh is melting!\n-Your soul burns! Who who me...!\nA terrible scream echoes among the banmans. But no one can preserve their souls.\nDeath of the soul that is the most basic punishment the Holy Corps offers to evil.\nThese guys...!\nHellheart the High Demon of Wisdom and Search gnashed his teeth at the annoying enemy's high-tech weapon.\nFamiliar high-level scientific weapons. If only that it would have been just a little annoying toy.\nFor them whose very existence is magical high-tech weapons are not compatible.\nHowever most of the corps here are anti-horses with enemies in the body and the weapons they are using are not just high-tech weapons.\nCombining hateful sacred technology with troublesome scientific power...!\nBecause he had destroyed many worlds with high-level scientific civilizations in the past he knew how annoying this combination could be.\nBut the output is weak! You're not even a high-ranking knight do you think you can properly handle that kind of sergeant!\nYes. Unlike the Baron class which is an unmanned aerial vehicle and the Viscount class which is an elite aircraft for special operations the Count class is a war weapon for Yacht spinners.\nThe energy source for those formidable armaments comes from the Holy Grail Knight Yapi's sacred reactor.\nWithout such an energy source for the Pilot Kikkiruk warriors the Count class could not produce the highest level of potential.\n-Kick! (launch heto anchor)\nA beam of light pouring from the Count-class aircraft. It was unexpectedly stuck to the serfs in the middle of the battlefield.\nuh?\n“What is this?”\nA beam of light suddenly connected to their nape. The serfs' anxiety was justified.\nThese Lionhearts are like angels who can't help but dismantle the serfs and recycle the iron powder.\n- Giggles! (Temporary energy source requisition)\nAt the same time as he said that something was quickly absorbed from the serf soldiers connected to the beam of light.\n-dump!\n-dump!\nPikpik the serfs who fall down. As if the soul had disappeared from the body...\n-Kiruuk! (Soul drain transmission operating. 1.5% temporary power supply)\n“······ Eh?”\nIt purifies evil and uses it as energy. This itself was a method often used in Lionheart.\nIt's because the efficiency is terribly inefficient.\nof course.\nThe serf system itself did not think about efficiency.\nIf efficiency was considered the serfs would have been given proper armor and weapons. I didn't bother to get naked and charge with a dagger.\nThis a bastard more devilish than this devil...!\n“What color is your blood!!”\nThe serfs screamed and were enraged at the Count-class aircraft that took their souls. But they couldn't escape.\nAttention Chunshik! Quietly dedicate your soul! Execute!\nUnder Choi's instruction the serfs could not escape and had to suck their souls.\nThe pilots who stopped the high-ranking demons with baron-class unmanned combat robots entered the battle when they met the appropriate energy.\n-Kiruruk! (Energy meets 2.7%.)\n-Siege cannon star iron bullet SET.\nWhat was fired at the same time as the set was a pure star iron bullet. A so-called super young and rich bullet for sniping high-ranking demons.\nThe Count class takes damage just by firing this one shot.\n- Kwak!\nSiege artillery fire from the air. The high-ranking devil reacted when the Count-class unable to fix the fuselage was shot with a tremendous recoil to the point of being thrown out of the sky.\n‘High speed siege gun?!'\nIndeed if it were an ordinary high-ranking demon it would have turned into mush in one shot. But... if you're a demon of wisdom and exploration especially if you're a candidate for the next great devil-\nNumerous protective spells block the front of siege shells. At that moment the souls of a thousand half-horses of the Legion were chosen to use such protective magic but Helheart didn't care at all.\n- Kaang!\nBouncing siege shells. It was when Helheart smiled in victory.\n-puck! Puffer Puck!\nThe dull crashing sound of something dissolving the six punches. By the time Hellheart noticed it was already too late.\n-Kick! Kikkiroouk!\n(Plasma Crab Holycutter consumes the souls of 87 serfs to operate)\n-Kieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\n-My I disappear!\nHuge robot claws that look like the iconic claws of the Kkikkiruk tribe. He was holding on to Helheart's waist shining with the screams of serf soldiers.\nHey wait a minute—\n- Snip!\nHellheart's corpse was cut in half and a terrible scream of soul annihilation rang out as he died instantly with star-iron armaments.\nThe screams and cries of the High Demon were enough to plant moral bread in the entire half-horse army.\n-Hey Hellheart is dead!\n-Hey the soul... The soul is screaming!\nimmortality. Seeing the demon the target of all half-horses longing for vanish so easily they no longer had the strength to continue fighting.\n- Ha surrender!\n- Surrender!\nLooking at them Choi and the residents smiled twistedly.\nNew Chunsik is always welcome!\n* * * *\nAt the end of the battle in Naju there was a mysterious man escaping the pantheon.\nAs soon as the battle started he escaped from among the tourists who had been pushed into the pantheon to protect civilians.\n“The Pantheon has created an amazing weapon.”\n[Veteran knight level who can deal with high-ranking demons! If the numbers come together it should be worth dealing with even the Great Devil.]\nIs that enough...?\n[If there are at least two more machines like that you won't be able to compete!]\nThe man who heard Bo-ok's voice... the archmage Raynald Shellman couldn't believe it at all.\nEven if it's just that much it's a considerable skill in the human world. Among the demons he is a magical darling that even a few high-ranking demons cannot rub against.\nHow many mass-produced weapons would he be defeated?\nSeriously everything in the Pantheon is amazing.\n[More than those things the real thing is the Holy Grail Knight. I never want to face those monsters!]\n“I agree with you.”\nRaynald hoped that the day he would face off against the Holy Grail Knight would never come. That's why he accepted the request from ‘Chaos' at the moment when the Lion King and the Holy Grail Knights were gone.\nIs this... really helpful? It's like a simple piece of wood isn't it?\nRaynald looked at the ‘Gunlar's Seedling' of the pantheon stored in the subspace inventory.\nThe goal of this pantheon attack. Thousands of half-horse legions and high demons were just bait for this.\n[Keukkeukuu... The history of the war between us and Lionheart is deeper than you can imagine.]\nAnd this was the hidden peace that drove Lionheart infested with monster scabs to the brink of destruction.\n[Lion Heart King also intended to use this to annihilate us... but I wouldn't have known if the new Lord of Chaos hadn't taken over the same land as Lion Heart King!]\nCertainly the Lord of Chaos of this generation is bold. The reason for choosing the North Korean land that is easy to be discovered at any time was the logic that if this side is easy to attack on the contrary it is quicker to attack first.\nBut... I'm fine? Lion Heart King seems to have regained most of his main powers although not as much as he did in his heyday...\nRaynald knew the history of the Lion Heart King from the Jewel of Wisdom.\nIsn't that the monster that killed three monarchs? Among them was the former Lord of Chaos.\nIt seems that the big supply demon is not even an opponent in terms of force but can you deal with the lion heart king just because the rank goes up one level?\nBesides weren't there already three monstrous Grail Knights beneath him?\n[This is stupid. You can say that because you haven't witnessed the power of the monarch.]\nThey mean evil. cluster of malignancies. It is not a being that can be countered with imperfect power.\nBeing a demon lord is the pinnacle of pinnacles of holding and shaking the fate of the stars. Beyond the Jewel of Wisdom the Great Demon of Wisdom was convinced that the Fallen Lion Heart King was not an existence that could be matched.\nThen... are you going to join them and fight together as they requested? This time a great being will come directly...\nI'm crazy! I'm not going?!\n·······.\nIt was a very consistent demon.\n* * * *\nA whopping 13 million.\nA large-scale raid that raided over 130000 monsters the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Manshinjeon building began to be organized starting with Vulcanus which fell in Seoul.\nI am...! I am Vulcanus!!\nA gigantic flame wielded by the Holy Grail Knight of Monstrous Strength. Monsters and demon followers are just crumbs swept away by natural disasters.\nVulcanus and the warlords of Yapi who made an emergency sortie were swept away and the knights of the Pantheon who appeared riding a Dominator-class aircraft carrier landed and the remaining troops were quickly organized.\nHowever even after arranging the remaining troops the war clouds within Korea did not disappear.\nThe defection and death of a large number of North Korean pilots. Terrorism and raids hit the country.\nThis is because it has become clear that the devil and North Korea are behind the assassination of the president as well as the downing of an air force plane boarded by Mansinjeon.\nAlthough the damage was minimized with a quick subjugation numerous property damage and deaths occurred one after another and the size was too large to pass this as a simple provocation.\nThe South Korean government immediately retaliated against North Korea with Air Force fighter jets and Army artillery units and President Andong-gil immediately appeared in front of reporters and declared.\nDecember 28 2032 which will be remembered as a day of terrible national mourning. The Republic of Korea was attacked in a despicable surprise by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\nThe president listened to several stories and explained how unfair North Korea's attack was and how brutal they had been.\nAnd at the end the most terrible thing remained.\nThey committed the most terrible and inhumane betrayal of attacking their fellow countrymen by joining hands with the devil. This must be a betrayal and deception of all mankind.\nWe must never allow this. Just as the blood of so many good people was shed for their preemptive strike 82 years ago blood has been shed again for their outrageous acts today.\nWe believe that we must not only do our best to defend ourselves but also make them pay for their inhumane acts.\nAnd at the end of President Andong-gil's gaze there was Leon. A very strong and reliable ally. Korea will be with Lionheart until the end.\nOur army and our people with a determined will will inevitably achieve victory! May the gods protect us!\nDecember 29 2032 with applause. Before the new year dawned an official declaration of war was declared.\nIt was the beginning of the Second Korean War.",

      "content": "< Captured Gunlar's Seedlings >\nSorry Your Majesty! It's our mistake!\nNaju Mansinjeon. Manager Kim Jin-soo Man at Arms and the residents prostrated themselves and confessed the mistake to Leon.\nThe battle was a complete victory. Against the 10000-strong anti-horse corps Man-at-Arms and the residents brilliantly resisted and the battle ended in victory with the mobilization of count-level war weapons.\nIn this battle only 3000 half-horses were captured and the rest died or fled so it could be said that it was a great victory. But-\nGunlar's seedling was stolen...\nUpon returning from the battle Manager Kim Jin-soo realized that the seedlings that had been planted and growing in the courtyard of the Mansinjeon Hall had disappeared.\nAnd that this is a trick of the devils to steal seedlings.\nSir Spinner.\n-Kikluk·······.\nWhen Leon called his name Yaffy answered with a weak voice as if he was limp.\n-The relic management system of this machine was perfect.\nHowever the seedlings were stolen.\n-·······.\nYapi didn't answer. While Leon planted Gunlar's seedlings and nurtured them he ordered Yapi to care for and protect them.\nYapi prepared the best management system he could. There was a perfect defense system in this place without the vigilance of organisms.\nIt is limited but it is a count class object that can deal with the great devil and a drone alert system that operates 24 hours a day. If necessary it could even mobilize satellite weapons to bombard approaching hostile forces.\n“Come to think of it since the Hoeryong incident the pilgrim article Koo Dae-seong couldn’t find anything wrong with North Korea’s surveillance right?”\n-Kiruuk·······.\nYapi launched a number of covert mobile drones to inspect North Korea. But no abnormalities were found. It must have been but what are the numerous monsters that have emerged from North Korea?\nLeon did not doubt Yapi's ability. In the first place there is no such thing as carelessness or mistakes for Yapi a strong artificial intelligence.\nIf so you have to think differently.\nThey must have a way to trick the machine's eyes.\nThe demons insignificantly evaded the perfect surveillance and defense system of the advanced technology of the future century that Yapi is proud of.\nAlthough easy to overlook due to their immortality demons' technological prowess never diminishes.\nIt's just that they didn't feel the need to develop they would have already destroyed several worlds with high-level science power like Yapi.\nYour Majesty is the situation serious?\nIn response to Beatrice's question Karina and Vulcanus instead let out a sigh. This is because pure-blood Holy Grail Knights from the Lionheart Kingdom know what purpose it will be used for.\nIt's just to recreate that tree branch of destruction.\nKarina and Vulcanus both thought of the same thing.\nYes their purpose is probably the same as then.\nThe first war between Lionheart and the Demon Corps. Malus the lord of chaos summoned to the imperial capital burned down the Sage's Forest on the borders of the empire.\nIf that of the empire is reproduced the current Earth's power cannot stop it.\nOnly the two of them realized that it included the Lion Heart King himself.\nWhen the previous Branch of Destruction was completed five Holy Grail Knights were sacrificed and the Lionheart was barely able to defeat the monarch.\nBut at this point it's not such a big deal.\nAt Leon's words Beatrice and Yapi's gaze turned to him.\nThe world tree I got from Gunlar is still just a ‘seedling'. It's a seedling that hasn't grown properly. I can't recreate the branches of that time with it. It's just that they've spent this much money to steal something like that. going to be.\nIf Leon had been in the position of the devil he would have attempted to steal it when the World Tree had grown to a certain extent.\nBut the demons didn't. He stole seedlings that hadn't fully grown while consuming his troops quite unreasonably.\nIt must have been an accident that they had to hurry.\nAnyway there was a time limit but Leon didn't care.\nAs long as the presence of demons is confirmed in North Korea Leon will set aside any urgent matters and head north to punish them.\nThe world tree grows in the hands of the demons and strikes them before they fable with branches of destruction. Sir Spinner. How is the battle on the armistice line?\n-Kick! Loading south with overwhelming numbers of enemies. It is estimated that it will be difficult for the Armed Forces to advance to the armistice line.\nThe second Korean War is always predicted as a unilateral victory and economic loss for South Korea.\nThe difference in military power between the two Koreas is already as overwhelming as that of an adult and a child.\nHowever the current North Korea is a mixed army full of demons and monsters. Modern weapons are ineffective against them.\nSir Vulcanus.\nYes Your Majesty!\nThe vanguard of this war. I will leave it to the Lord and the Knights of the Burning Sword. First push the sluggish front line.\nGRARARA──! Of course Your Majesty!\nSince ancient times when Lionheart waged war the riders of the God of War and Flame always took the lead.\nTheir overwhelming combat power always brought victory to the kingdom so Leon was reassured that the kingdom's strongest Holy Grail Knights were by his side.\n* * * *\n·······.\n·······.\nAfter getting off at the airport the envoys were taken somewhere by the North Korean army. A high-class limousine was unsuitable for military use but the high-ranking official's ceremonial vehicle in this neighborhood is a German car.\nAn old man from South Korea. Charau with an eyepatch.\nThe place we are going from now on is a secret place. It was a natural action but Cheon Jin-soo slapped the palm of the People's Army and shouted.\nHow dare you a young laborer! You bastard you don't even have a mother?!\nUh huh?\nEven the soldiers seemed taken aback by Cheon Jin-soo's attitude of shouting in front of a soldier holding a gun. However Cheon Jin-soo's brashness did not end there.\nYou're born dark. Did you eat only meat and no vegetables since you were young? You look like a dwarf! You know I was taught home schooling!\nGo I've never eaten meat soup before...\nWhy do you blame me for being a beggar's den! Are you proud?! If you want to eat meat soup you should have done it! Nooooooh!!\nA true old man who doesn't consider the opposite! Cheon Jin-soo was relentless towards the cheeky young man who tried to hide his face as he pointed his gun at me.\nLet's do that. What can I do with the things I grew up without.\nAnd Jin-seong Kang stopped such an innocence just because he didn't want to make troublesome things without a bit of empathy.\nWhen it comes to Korean legendary hunters it is easy to think of images of age and lofty immortals but both Cheon Jin-soo and Kang Jin-seong are in a position no different from the chairman of a fairly large conglomerate in Korea.\nSocial economic and military influence gave them huge wings along with capital and naturally their gaze was different from that of ‘ordinary people'.\nRather it is the two of them who treat even the chairmen of chaebol groups as ‘ordinary people' who will die if they touch them with their fingers.\n“You don’t have any composure. Where are the bright young bastards——”\nI'm contemplating whether to kill them all and invade Pyongyang. Even if they don't know the commander knows the obvious result so I'm thinking about why they're doing this.\n“······!!”\nAt that the People's Army was appalled at the real threat looming.\nCheon Jin-soo is just a twisted old man but this old man sincerely had the will and strength to kill them all.\nAnd Cheon Jin-soo Korea's representative lightsaber and Kang Jin-seong the infinite sword. These two alone can annihilate even the clumsy North Korean Awakeners.\nPlease do that you two elders.\nAn official from the Reconnaissance General Bureau who was worse off said as he removed the soldier's eye patch.\nI'm sorry to have you like this old people.\nHey! That's it! Where are you going now?\nI don't think it's downtown Pyongyang.\nAt the words of the two no-hunters he smiled bitterly.\nPyongyang is now in Magul. Probably by now...\nPark Sang-gyo's words were shocking. The two no-hunters understood why they dragged them from the airport like a kidnapper.\nThat's how we arrived at the underground tunnel under a mountain. There the South Korean delegation faced unexpected magnates.\nI ordered the missiles to be fired at the pantheon.\nListed by Ri Cheol-ung deputy commander of North Korea's General Guard. He was the leader of the ‘resistance forces' who fired the first gunshots of the incident.\n* * * *\n34 hours after the outbreak of the Second Korean War. The battlefield was already mired in mud.\nIt was ridiculous to compare the advanced forces of the two countries and the North Korean Air Force disappeared from the map less than a day after the start of the war.\nIt was assumed that the war would proceed smoothly as the ROK Air Force which had such overwhelming air superiority unilaterally bombed the North Korean artillery but...\nFuck I came to war but I can't see the North Koreans and there are a lot of monsters!\nThe Armed Forces encountered an unexpected difficulty.\nIt was good that they advanced while blowing away the North Korean artillery but as soon as they crossed the armistice line they clashed with tens of thousands of monsters.\nThe ROK Army's firepower is the strongest among Asian Army Groups but it is a weapon to deal with the same human beings.\nConsidering the monster's unique resistance to modern weapons this wasn't a good match.\n‘Why don't North Korean soldiers come out and only monsters like that come out?'\nLieutenant Kim recalled that the number of North Korean artillerymen he had dealt with was extremely small. To the point where it feels as if this war is not against North Korea but against monsters or demons.\nSquadron commander...! Gargoyles in the foreground! Crazy statues are flying around!\nFuck it...!\nLieutenant Kim requested fire support from the artillery unit but even if Amman's artillery firepower was strong it was far from stopping the human-sized gargoyles moving at high speed.\nThe gargoyles that broke through the fire in an instant overturned the tank and tore the armored vehicle apart. Lieutenant Kim's voice became urgent at the unbelievable reality in front of him.\nHere's the front line breaking through! A lot of at least B-class monsters! Hunter support is needed!\n[This is headquarters company. Hunters arrive soon. Hang on a little.]\nWhat the fuck is right in front of your nose to hold on! My kids are all going to die!\nThe K2 tank flying into the sky again. The tank looked like that and it was obvious what the infantry would be like.\nSupport! Support! Hunter! Send the Hunter!\n-Kwaaaaaaaaang!\nIt was then. As if in response to Lieutenant Kim's earnest scream something fell from the sky with a tearing noise.\nRealizing that it was a missile the faces of Lieutenant Kim and the soldiers were stained with despair.\nDealing with monsters is not a matter of firepower. Whether it's a tank gun or a missile it's because mankind's weapons don't work properly for them.\nJust when they thought it was a waste of money the faces of the ROK soldiers who witnessed the missile fall toward them turned white.\nOh allies?!\nNo matter how much the armed forces know the human rights of soldiers at dog price they still bombard missiles like this recklessly?\nI didn't think it was possible but the moment everyone was about to shout that the country abandoned us while watching the missiles fall-\n-Activation of landing dampers. Thrust Deflection Nozzle Max.\nWith a mechanical sound echoing inside the missile that the soldiers could not hear the falling missile slowed down just before impact.\nAnd a stable supersonic impact that is completely impossible with modern technology.\nLieutenant Kim thought it was too thick to be a missile that landed with a cloud of dust. As if it were a ‘transport missile'.\n-Clap! Clap!\nAnd that imagination was surprisingly right. This is because the cover of the missile was opened and knights in heavy pre-modern armor poured out from there.\nEh the pantheon?!\nThe three knights jumped out on horseback and charged at the gargoyles.\n“Atrocity!”\n“cruelty!”\n“Cruel!”\nKnights spurring flames even with their breath.\n“Ruthless death...!!”\nEvery time they wield their flaming swords the bodies of the monsters split and when they touched the flames they burned uncontrollably and were incinerated.\n-Key Kiii...\nEven the ferocious monsters cower when they realize that the creature in front of them is a beast far superior to them.\nHowever despite such a natural hierarchy and submission the beasts only wield brutal violence to satisfy my hunger.\nFighting or submitting the fact that death could not be avoided the beasts attacked the knights as if in a fit of fuss.\n- Kaang! Kang!\n- Kacan!\nHowever neither the brute force that overturned the tank nor the ferocious claws that tore apart the armored car could not break the star iron armor that had been blessed by the god of war.\nRather it was to the extent that his entire body was burned by the flames gushing out of his armor for the shameful crime of trying to harm the knights of God.\n- Tup!\nIn the burning divine flame the knight grabbed the gargoyle's face.\n- Kiy! Kiyi...!\nA struggling gargoyle. I fluttered with my wings and tried to escape from the knight's grip but soon the knight gave me strength and my face was crushed.\nThe weaklings.\nFalling stone fragments. The limp corpses of the gargoyles piled up like a mountain.\nonly 5 minutes. After the three knights fell with missiles hundreds of monsters were wiped out within 5 minutes of fighting.\nKnights of the gods...\nPerhaps there was a pantheon believer among the soldiers and when one soldier got down on one knee and bowed his head in salute the soldiers gathered and knelt down one by one.\nThey looked longingly at these glorious knights who were blessed by God and claimed to be the protectors of mankind.\n-Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\n-Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\nMissiles were pouring down from everywhere in the sky of the battlefield.",

      "content": "< The Compassionate Occupation Army >\nYes yes... I see. Then neither will we... No. We should too.\nGoo Dae-sung finished the call and returned to the lobby. There Captain Kim Do-han and other men at arms were waiting for Goo Dae-seong.\nWhat? How did it go?\n“There is no major damage to the Pantheon.”\nWhoa~ I'm glad that's the case.\nManshinjeon usually focuses on attacking the gate in terms of people's livelihood.\nThat means most of the power at all times is inside the gate.\nAt present only Man-at-Arms soldiers and trainees who are resting at the Mansinjeon are left so the news of the 10000-strong anti-horse corps attack made Gu Dae-seong and Man-at-Arms panic.\n“It seems that Lord Yapi’s war weapons have been active.\nThat's nice. But it's strange after all.\nyes.\nKoo Dae-sung and his unit have recently moved to and from the North Korean border area. Most of the operations were carried out with the help of Yapi's reconnaissance assets and not a few people were rescued.\n“Sir Yapi dispatched reconnaissance assets to Pyongyang and the Demarcation Line. But it is also strange that such a large-scale movement was not identified.”\nUntil now no one doubted Yapi's ability in the pantheon.\nIsn't it Yapi who showed absolute ability in everything from the pantheon management business to combat politics and maneuvering?\nRather that's why I couldn't think of the obvious question until now.\nThe possibility that Yapi was collecting false information.\nLord Yapi classifies all information observed by the camera as uncertain information. From now on he will collect only information confirmed by the naked eye as data...\nIn other words you'll need a scouting party to act as your eyes.\nThere are military and hunters near the ceasefire line. But it's different in the north.\nIn other words they must play that role. I don't know if it's the usual border invasion level but this was a war.\nOne pilgrim knight and fifty soldiers made up of C-class hunters. It was a great risk for them to enter North Korea which became a battlefield.\nLet's do it.\nBut no one wants to run away from here.\nOn December 30th with 30 hours left until the New Year Goo Dae-sung and 50 Man-at-Arms crossed the Tumen River.\n* * * *\nAfter a cataclysm it is not often that countries go to war with one another.\nAfter China is divided into over 50 countries each other claims to be the successor of the true People's Republic of China and engages in skirmishes but it is only at the level of local warfare.\nAn increase in territory means an increase in the number of gates occurring in the country and each country busy cleaning its own gates never dreamed of a war for territorial expansion.\nThat is why the world paid attention to the war between the two Koreas that broke out ahead of the year 2033.\nAside from the US and Japan which dispatched a large-scale landing force and navy to support the military alliance isn't it a super-large army with over a million active soldiers in both the South and the North?\nBoth countries still maintain huge military sizes despite the reduced demand for modern weapons since the cataclysm.\nIf such two armies collided it was predicted that a bloody slaughter battle would break out reminiscent of an axis of world war.\nBut-\n- What is it? The North Korean army is not coming out only monsters are pouring out.\n-Does North Korea intend to focus only on defending Pyongyang? It is not active even if it is a preemptive strike.\n- The actual battle on the battlefield is a confrontation between monsters and hunters. Said the Navy and Air Force had nowhere to run so they were annihilated long ago.\n- The Korean Marines are also hesitant to land because of the monsters. The battlefield can only take place from the armistice line as a starting point.\nStarting with a large-scale defection it is North Korea that has caused missile downings of Air Force charter planes and large-scale raids.\nHowever when the war started the air force was hit and destroyed by a massive missile swarm on the first day of the war and the North Korean artillerymen who had a lot of numbers were only passively resisting.\nIt's as if some units didn't participate in the battle while others did... and it felt like they had no choice but to respond because the opponent was attacking them.\nIn the end it showed a different aspect of war than imagined for an all-out war between countries with the largest armies in Asia.\nIt was a pre-modern hand-to-hand combat.\nNot to mention effective weapons against monsters swords and axes wielded by Awakeners.\nAbove all over the past 30 years experts who know better about monster strategy and ecology than anyone else are hunters.\nThe hunters who were mobilized for the war and sent to the armistice line escorted the armed forces and repulsed the monsters. Among them-\nGRANARARARA——!!\nA monster that overwhelms the battlefield. Knights who break through the waves of monsters with such monsters.\n-Quaaaaaa!\nEvery time the mighty Holy Grail Knight wields the Holy Sword flames that burn the mountain hit the monsters like a wave.\n-bang! Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwak!\nAnd as the hundreds of thousands of landmines along the truce line exploded along with those monsters a terrifying explosion rang out from here and there.\nIt's not just them. At the request of the Armed Forces knights from all over the world are transported using missile platforms. When the number reached 300 including the Holy Grail Knights three cheers of pantheism rang out all over the battlefield.\nThat's... the Holy Grail Knights. Those are the knights...\nThe soldiers of the Armed Forces who were suddenly escorted by the Hunters were in awe of the knights who had broken through beyond the role of firefighters on the battlefield.\nEven Hunter is a superhuman that ordinary humans can't reach. Superhumans who cut the thick skin and flesh of monsters with cold weapons. Their fight videos were completely different from other martial arts sports.\nEven if they try to attack Patini in the end unlike the hunters who live on their individual pride the knights of the Pantheon and Man-at-Arms are——\n‘Soldier... I'm actually closer to that side.'\nQuite a few superhumans equivalent to S-class hunters operate under the discipline of knights.\nIt is said that the Burning Sword Knights were original knights so even so Cheon So-yeon and other Earth-born knights and Man-at-Arms are so thorough with less than a year of training.\nThat was possible not only through rigorous training but also because of the absolute charisma of Leon Dragonia and Lionheart.\n‘This war. It's only natural that the protagonist is a pantheon.'\nHunters and the ROK military are not accustomed to a war centered on this pre-modern hand-to-hand combat.\nIn that respect the pantheons are specialists in hand-to-hand combat. The opponents of those knights are also demons so the protagonist of this war must be the pantheon.\n[Army! Successfully breaking through the ceasefire line! Live broadcast of Her Highness Beatrice's Demarcation Line!]\n[At least 10000 Kilroggs of the Burning Sword Knights of Lord Vulcanus! The monster wave is also annihilated before the power of the Holy Grail Knights.]\n[With Grand Duke Karina and Sir Yakt Spinner Gaeseong City arrives right in front of you! A splendid feat three hours after entering the battle!]\nEven the tidal wave of monsters was washed away like a stain in front of the waves in front of the overwhelming fighting power of the Pantheon and Holy Grail Knights.\nEven though Leon didn't even step forward overwhelming criminal records were handed down one after another.\n* * * *\nIn this war the Mansinjeon was given a status close to the ‘Allied Forces' not subject to conscription.\nOriginally as a Korean citizen it is necessary to be controlled by the government authorities in case of emergency but-\nA king cannot enter another king's gate.\n[note······.]\nAfter thinking about it for a while President Ahn treated Mansinjeon as an ally's military and gave it independent military operation rights.\nIncluding the Man-at-Arms and the Kikkiruk warriors the force was less than 20000 but no one could deny the fighting power of the Pantheon.\nIn fact the sluggish battle on the armistice line was sorted out within less than a day after the Holy Grail Knights were deployed.\nThe Knights of the Burning Sword run at the forefront!!\nIn addition a splendid advance to individuality. The Holy Grail Knights who broke through the battlefield while piercing through the tens or millions of landmines along the ceasefire line were fear itself.\nWith that personality right in front of his nose Leon had no choice but to stop for a moment.\nWhat are those?\nThey are North Koreans. They seem to be digging trenches.\nThe commander of the armored division of the ROK Army barely following the relentless rapid breakthrough of the Mansinjeon knights witnessed North Korean citizens digging trenches and preparing for defensive battles in Kaesong City.\nAll of them were skin and bone. Are you starving?\nWell it's common in North Korea. At least it has a better personality. Rice is supplied first in aid to North Korea.\nHowever even taking that into consideration the residents of Kaesong City seemed starving.\n‘You stole our support supplies.'\nIt's a common occurrence.\nThe rice or medicines that are provided to poor countries are smuggled out through the back hole.\nJust looking at the rice exports to China from North Korea which has not been able to solve its own people's food situation it is obvious to whom the proceeds from the exports accumulate.\nEven knowing that it was the reality of the moment that I was willing to give away 100000 tons if I supported 1 million tons.\nEven that won't go back to the residents properly.\nWhat do you mean by that?\n“North Korea has a predatory economy where soldiers plunder the people.”\nAt those words Leon widened his eyes. Even in the 1990s when he was still an earthling North Korea was notorious but he hadn't even heard of soldiers plundering the people.\nHowever North Korea became poorer as time went by and the tyranny of the dictatorship intensified day by day.\nWhile maintaining an army of over one million it is obvious where the guns of the soldiers who have no military supplies to siphon off have not been provided with provisions to feed them.\nAs a result the area where soldiers were stationed was in a vicious cycle where food and goods were periodically plundered by soldiers.\nHave you seen these honorless bastards!\nEven considering that situation it was natural for Leon to be angry.\nA soldier is a sacred profession that exists to protect the country and its citizens! But you plunder the citizens of your own country that you need to protect? This is an insult to all soldiers!\nThat's right. By the way Your Majesty? Why are you pulling out your sword?\nThe division commander was taken aback when he saw Leon having a seizure beyond the level of anger.\nStalion!\nLeon suddenly draws his sword and summons the new beast Stallion. As he drew his sword and shouted in the middle of the camp knights and man-at-arms soldiers gathered.\n“What is it Your Majesty!”\nWhen Lord Raihar of the Burning Sword Knights asked Leon shouted.\nThose soldiers are a people who make their fortunes by persecuting and plundering the civilians!\nIs that true?!\nHave you seen these honorless bastards!\nAren't they crazy?!\nThe Knights of the Burning Sword were angry. Leon didn't stop there and went around the encampment barracks and shouted.\nGun! Ready to charge!\nCharge! Prepare!!\nGiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nYour Majesty! Your Majesty! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!\nThe commander of the division tried to dissuade Leon who was raging like a madman but as soon as the burning sword knights got on the horse in anger Cheon So-yeon and the 2nd and 3rd knights of the 1st Knight Dango followed them without hesitation.\nonly two hundred. Leon gave the order without delay.\nIt's a gun charge! Turn the gun!\n“WHAAAAAAAAAAA──────!!”\nThe two hundred horsemen charging into the trenches reminded me of the mounted soldiers charging at Maxim machine guns in World War I but—\nSecond the gun bomb doesn't work!\nWhatever that is! Is that a person?!\nHelp me! Save me!\nThis last-minute dog charge ended in victory destroying 134 North Korean tanks 437 armored vehicles and 1000 cannon batteries.\nEarth's history goes backwards.\n* * * *\nSurprisingly the North Koreans welcomed the South Korean army as liberators.\nIn the meantime they suffered from the people's army and the party but with active support and dispatched hunters over the past decade they were also aware that the ones protecting them were South Korea not North Korea.\nIn particular Gaeseong is where the Gaeseong Industrial Complex operates and the black market for Choco Pie which is provided as a snack to employees is active.\nChoco Pie which is smuggled throughout North Korea has made Gaeseong relatively wealthy and it is said that most of the salary is taken away by the party but even 10% of the salary is equivalent to three years of salary that can be earned by working in North Korea.\nIt sounds really unrealistic but since all of this is true everyone knows the enormous size of the North Korean economy.\nLong live South Korea! Long live leader Andong-gil!\nLong live the pantheon! Long live the Lionheart!\nIn addition in North Korea where South Korean culture and news are common the South Korean military could not be particularly excluded.\nIt was an open fact that the most popular cultural contents in North Korea were South Korean dramas and they trafficked USBs containing South Korean dramas and passed them around.\n-Is that Westerner named Leon really the king of the other world?\n-I mean? Flash in the east flash in the west. He's the one who uses the axis method and turns pine cones into grenades.\n-You look like comrade Kim Il-sung.\nAmong them Leon's news is famous even in North Korea. It was only natural that the hottest South Korean news recently was Manshinjeon and Leon.\n- Anybody is fine. Better than People's Army!\n- Ganna bastards you stole half of the rice you were fighting for!\n-If that's taken away what are you going to do this winter...?\n-Is that all? It's simple to build a trench and drag it without pay. In this cold severe winter they gave me no gloves and made me dig!\nOver the past 50 years the People's Army and the Party have never been protectors of North Koreans.\nHow many North Koreans have eaten that meat soup while singing the song “Enjoy on Earth”?\nFew people have ever eaten a piece of white rice let alone meat soup. In the meantime as South Korea occupies North Korea expectations rise in their eyes.\nOccupy the city step by step. Is this all the mobilized residents?\nResidents of Kaesong City were overwhelmed when they saw a man with blond hair riding on a horse whom they had never seen before.\nOccasionally Kim Jong-un appeared on TV riding a white horse but his words looked tough and there was nothing fancy about it.\nYes yes...! Most of the people were mobilized for labor! There are a few people's army kids inside.\nI see. It's good. The situation is urgent so I will declare the policy for the occupied territory in a short form.\nIndeed what policy will this new leader show? Whatever you do it will be better than the People's Army and the Party.\nbut.\nFirst all private resources are released according to the Lionheart Special Wartime Act. This will be treated as a special tax on tithing.\nyes?\nIn addition all strong men are mobilized for labor. All men who can move except for the elderly children and women will follow the army and belong to the volunteer corps. Ideally.\nAn ancient hero who seems to have jumped out of mythology.\nIt fits perfectly.\nAre you dissatisfied something lowly?\nHowever it was even correct that the heroes in the myth were sinful aristocrats and royalty.",

      "content": "< Street Fighting >\nThe occupation of Kaesong one of North Korea's largest cities was expected to be a sluggish street fight as originally expected.\nThe battle that takes place in the city center where buildings are densely built is a demon cave with hundreds or thousands of forts.\nIt is narrow for tanks or armored vehicles to enter and the attack surface is spread in all directions so you don't know when and where an attack will come.\nThe most difficult thing was the civilians.\nInternational criticism could not be avoided if civilian casualties were severe even if they tried to flatten the country by bombarding it with artillery bombardment and missiles rather than accept the damage of urban warfare.\nbut. What if it's a whole bunch of armor that laughs at the bullets and anti-tank missiles pouring out of the windows?\n- Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa!\n- Shoot! Shoot all!\nCountless bullets and anti-tank rockets rained down from building windows and rooftops.\nThe burning sword knights calmly continued their conversation even as the tanks were hit like poultices by the firepower that would melt them.\nSir Tarhan! Can you hear his voice!\nIt's okay Sir Laihar! These sounds so loud! What about Sir Kim Jae-hyeok over there!\nAh ah ah! I think my eardrum is broken! Oh can't you use my voice!\nWhy do you have this much! Sir Han Soo-ho here seems to be doing well!\nThat's because he's a fraudulent shield!!\n30 minutes to leisurely walk around downtown Kaesong. The amount of bullets poured into the knights was gunpowder that if piled up would blow up an entire cavalry unit but they advanced with their bare bodies beaten.\nThis world's main weapon? I heard it's something like that how about it Lord Tarhan!\nIf Man-at-Arms use it what is it! Normal hit? I'll fix that! Is this the word used by today's generation!?\nTrying at the age of two hundred and eighty! Sir Tarhan!\nShouldn't the frozen period be removed? Sir Raihar who is 290 this year!\nAnyway! It's noisy and lukewarm! It won't be particularly meaningful to Petos-sama's knights like us!\n“······.”\nJaehyuk and Suho are speechless at the conversation between Lord Raihar and Lord Tarhan of the Holy Grail Knights.\nNo matter how much they say they are members of the Holy Grail Knights who are considered the highest among knights they are strange creatures who treat even anti-tank rockets as a bit of a prickly toothpick.\nAnd it's surprising that they themselves also fell into the ranks of such monsters.\nSir Raihar! First of all the observation information has been sent!\nReally?! Then send the information straight to Sir Spinner!\nAt that Suho took out his communicator and inputted his biological vision information into the terminal.\nIs this really working? What I don't understand is that it tracks the direction of the gaze and transmits information.\nI don't know. It's like some other mysterious future technology.\nThe information collector that Yapi supplied to the Knights and Man at Arms was a new information collector that collected and transmitted the information confirmed by the biological vision to the central system.\nIt is said that it is part of the cyber optics remodeling process that is inserted during the cyborg remodeling process but Jaehyuk who is anxious at the word cyborg puts it aside.\n-That... remodeling the normal eye color or something like that?\n-Kick! This is a rudimentary implant.\nIn any case all the members of the Pantheon had to accept this biomodification. It is because the reconnaissance system that relied on cameras in North Korea suffered a complete failure.\nTherefore an inefficient biometric information tracking system but a technology that can cope with this camera distortion was used──\nTransmission complete!\n- Ppa! poop! Pike pike pew pew!!\nAt the same time as the information was transmitted thousands of bullets fired from somewhere fell on the buildings in downtown Kaesong and the city fell silent.\n“Did you kill them all?”\n“No they said that they were caught as serfs and worked for 20 years so they only shot one place...”\nthat's scary as it is Knowing the treatment of serfs the two sympathized with the North Korean soldiers.\nHaha don't worry too much you two.\nSir Raihar patted his shoulder and said as if he knew the concerns of the still weak knights.\nUnless you followed the devil directly you'll die after suffering moderately. At least your soul won't be crushed.\nIs death a fait accompli?!\nLionheart also ranks serfs. However the conclusion of ‘death' did not change.\nIn Lionheart who valued the rest of the afterlife this was a fairly merciful treatment.\nAnyway let's head towards the center. Shouldn't we finish occupying the city?\nThe Holy Grail Knights roar with terrifying laughter saying that there is nothing as meaningless as caring for the lives of serf worms.\nThe occupation of Kaesong went smoothly thanks to the ruthless supermen and the strong artificial intelligence killing machine that surpasses modern technology.\nHowever they encountered unexpected resistance from the North Korean army.\nKko don't move! If you get any closer you'll kill all these South Korean Ganna bastards!\n* * * *\nA hostage take?\nRight before the suppression of the Kaesong Industrial Complex the final stage of the occupation of Kaesong City Mansinjeon and the South Korean army confronted the North Korean army taking hostages.\nLeon wondered and asked the commander of the Armed Forces Division.\nWhy are the people of South Korea in their hands?\nLeon did not understand this situation and asked the division commander who came with him.\nIt is because Leon who remembers Korea in the 1990s for the last time could not understand that South Koreans were in North Korea.\nAh there is an industrial complex in North Korea where our private companies have entered. It is called the Kaesong Industrial Complex and it is the manpower to hire and manage North Koreans there.\nLeon had an expression that he couldn't understand at the time.\nSending civilians to North Korea to build a factory and manage it?\nThat was a foolish thing. It's obvious that those disrespectful writers will use you as a hostage.\nKeuk... There were several political reasons such as evidence of inter-Korean reconciliation.\nTsk tsk no matter how important my courtship is how can I send my people to an enemy country as hostages?\nAt Leon's point the division commander did not make excuses from the politicians saying that it was a necessary decision.\nNorth Korea always repeated crazy things and it was possible even if you think about it that they would take hostages of their own citizens dispatched to the Kaesong Industrial Complex in case of emergency.\nBy the way it's been a headache. Taking hostages like that while the whole city is occupied.\nThe street fighting which was expected to cause great damage was able to break through with the tanking of the knights and indiscriminate sniping through the city center by Yapi.\nHowever the hostage-taking chosen by the cornered North Korean army successfully held back the South Korean army.\nHey what are you going to do with them?\nI'm thinking of calling in a negotiator first. I'll have to listen to what you want.\nHmm is that so?\nWhen Leon made a disapproving expression the division commander became cautious.\nEven so the president himself mentioned it and asked Leon to listen to whatever he wanted. In this war it was an order from the upper level to treat the pantheons as ‘allied forces' rather than being requisitioned.\nIt is said that it is difficult for a division commander to go against Leon.\nI can't stand to see such unscrupulous writers. Leave it to my knights.\nyes?\nWere there counterterrorism experts in the pantheon?\nThe division commander gave a puzzled look but Leon summoned the knights because it was his duty as a knight to save civilians.\n* * * *\nThe number of hostages is higher than expected. We need to be a little more careful.\nPantheon barracks. Beatrice spoke of prudence.\nHmm! But don't show weakness to the serf candidates!\nVulcan was a hardliner. An authoritarian who would rather have a few hostages die than have a knight lose his face. That much can be passed off as collateral damage.\nHa but those people are not guilty. Our country has to prioritize people's safety!\nHari gave an exemplary answer as a civil servant. Regardless of the position Hari's mentality has no option to abandon the hostages.\n-There is a risk of further damage while trying to save hostages. I'd rather take the damage of a few hostages and hard economic pressure can definitely save the majority.\nThoroughly calculating Yapi proposed a complete complete and thorough eradication operation of the North Korean hostage-taking. He is more hardline than Vulcanus.\n“No suppression is also suppression but the problem is that we have not grasped the exact scale of the hostages and hostage takers. there is.\nKarina made a realistic proposal.\nIt seems urgent to prioritize negotiations first and to determine the exact size and location of the hostages and hostage takers Your Majesty.\nHmm... Grand Duke Karina is right. At this point it would be right to pretend to negotiate and get to know them.\nLeon raised Karina's hand and ordered the knights.\nIt's unpleasant to even talk to those rude people but this is also for the sake of the innocent people. Try your best to rescue them.\nfirst batter. Hari Han.\nAh~ hello! North Korean soldiers! I'm Ha-ri Han of the Korean Hunter Association!\nHari held a loudspeaker and shouted to the North Korean soldiers who were holding hostages. They shouted harshly when they saw Saekmokin who had come alone to the entrance of the empty industrial complex.\nYankee go home!\nEh?! I'm Korean! Native Korean!\n“Which Korean peninsular in the world wore red pepper paste hair and shiny eyes?”\nThis this is the effect of awakening? There must be a similar case in North Korea?!\nIt was surprisingly common for body parts to change under the influence of awakening so the hostage takers did not say much.\nNow calm down. If you have any requests please tell me. We will actively review them. We are all the same people right?\nOur demand is one! Stop the aggression of South Korean capitalists led by American agents and withdraw immediately!\n······Excuse me? You all hit the ball first didn't you?\nBesides the U.S. Army hadn't even appeared yet. Although the Korean People's Army has mobilized reconnaissance satellites even Yapi's reconnaissance system is prone to errors. The US military's reconnaissance assets were of little help at this point.\nBesides he's an invader. Wasn't it North Korea that made the preemptive strike?\nHari a Korean was astounded by the North Korean army's audacity to define this side as an aggressor.\n“If you surrender even now you can still be treated like a human being!”\nWhat's up?!\nThe hostage takers get angry at Hari's provocative words. But what if that statement is true?\nHari now intended to relocate the hostage-takers' camps to military installations as an agent of the South Korean government if they surrendered.\nBut what if other people quell it not you? You will not be able to avoid being a serf without a yaljjam.\nThe UN Human Rights Commission will talk about the Geneva Conventions but Leon can't even hear it. It's good if you don't try to burn it wondering if you're possessed by a demon.\nIt's true! I'm sure you're the only one thinking of me here right now?! So let's turn ourselves in and find the light—\nShut up you mother!\n-Two da da da da da da da da da!\nAhhhhhhhh!\nHari was hit by a torrent of machine gun fire and fled to the camp.\nsecond batter. vulcan.\nI am Vulcanus!\nAs Vulcan approached the North Koreans began to agitate.\n“What what what about that lump of tin?”\nHow big is that guy?\nA giant over 2m tall is wearing full armor that looks like it could weigh hundreds of kilograms.\nTo the reckless hostage takers!\nUhhhh! My ears! My ears!\nWhat kind of person's voice is here...!\nVulcanus threatened the hostage-takers' eardrums with a booming voice without a loudspeaker. The words that came out of that hoarse voice were simple.\nIf you free all the innocent civilians I'll kill only one out of ten.\n······what?\nWhat did you just say...\nQuickly wash your neck and choose the ones to stick out. If it's hard to choose draw lots. Come on!\nUm what is that madman saying?!\nI can't see these South Korean gannahs! Uh! Should I kill them!\nHe shrugged his shoulders as he watched the North Korean soldiers firing Vulcan at the hostages.\nKill it.\nwhat?\nIf one hostage dies I will burn a hundred of you alive. I'll tell you what the pain of consuming a soul is.\nWith those words Vulcanus turned around. Leaving an eerie word.\nWhen you come back in a while choose the ones who will die well. Otherwise I will burn them all.\ncrazy guy\nThe North Korean soldiers intuited that the knight in front of them was not an ordinary madman.\n‘This isn't it...'\n‘Do South Korean Gannas originally negotiate like this?'\nIt wasn't the kind of negotiation drama they thought. Then I suddenly remembered what the red-haired girl who came out first said.\n“If you surrender even now you can still be treated like a human being!”\nAs the girl's eyes which had been desperate for some reason came to mind voices saying\nthird batter. Yakt Spinner.\n-Kick.\nA machine of some minimal size.\nI thought it was an unmanned drone of South Korean children but it declared to the North Korean army with an eerie mechanical sound.\n-Initiate recommendation by Lionheart Kingdom Law. non-citizens destined for serfdom.\nNon-citizens destined for serfdom?\n-This machine is Yakt Spinner the Holy Grail Knight of Heto the god of iron and blacksmith. You are breaking many kingdom laws.\n-You non-citizens destined to be serfs have no legal protection and such offenses only increase the penalty.\nWhat are you talking about this guy?\nHowever regardless of the reaction of the North Korean army the mechanical sound continued to flow.\n- Immediately disarm all weapons and suspend life activities by yourself. This is a very humane consideration that comes from the warm heart of Bongi.\nThese guys aren't crazy.\nWhy does it seem like things only get worse with the arrival of new ones... I guess it's just my mood?",

      "content": "< Pantheon-style hostage negotiations >\n- Immediately disarm all weapons and suspend life activities by yourself. This is a very humane consideration that comes from the warm heart of Bongi.\n·······.\n·······.\nAt Yapi's recommendation the North Korean military and even the Kaesong Industrial Complex employees who became hostages were shocked.\nFor a moment I wondered if I had heard it wrong.\ndisarm? Yes it would be a natural request to capture him as a prisoner.\nBut what? Suspend life activity? Is that a very humane warm-hearted consideration?\nSuch a madman...\n-Recommended again.\nEither that or not Yapi pressed the North Korean army with a cold and eerie mechanical sound.\n-You non-citizens who will be serfs are not a class that has the privilege of being immune to such illegal acts. He committed an aggravated offense of insulting the Holy Grail Knight the original Gi on the subject of a mere organism.\n- Immediately disarm and suspend life activities by yourself. If desired this machine can introduce a humane life cessation protocol. First from blocking electrical signals in the brain-\nYou you madman! What nonsense are you talking about!\n-Do not cut off this advice organism. Organisms tend to prefer keeping the corpse intact so this machine was considerate. If you want an immediate life stop I'll dispatch an execution drone-\nI won't die! I won't die! What the hell is this crazy robot talking about!\n-If you reject this recommendation you have no choice but to enforce righteous sanctions in accordance with the laws of the Lionheart Kingdom.\n-The justice will be swift and it will be painful.\nIt's creepy.\nYapi who did not change his expression and made cold mechanical sounds was an incomprehensible existence to the North Korean soldiers.\nThat inorganic gaze and voice brought strange credibility and cultivated a fear that what he said would be done.\n-Those monsters were fine even after being hit by the anti-tank rocket...\n-Monsters who even flip the tank with their bare hands Aigan? If you get caught what will happen to you...\nFear left room and that room gave way to negotiations.\nOoh what we want is our safety and the eviction of cities in South Korea. We ask for a temporary ceasefire until the Party directs us to do so.\n- No. You have no right to initiate truce negotiations on behalf of the State. You have no right other than surrender or cessation of life.\n-Make it clear that the enslavement of your officers is a lawful measure and that the persecution of freedmen only increases the punishment.\nMy the Geneva Conventions! Human Rights!\n- No. Lionheart Kingdom is not affiliated with the United Nations. We are therefore notified that we are not obligated to abide by international humanitarian law as was the case in Geneva and The Hague. Your human rights are not recognized.\nYou've never heard of the Lionheart Kingdom! Aren't you guys South Korean soldiers? Follow South Korean laws!\n- No. This machine complies with the Constitution of the Republic of Korea but is not compelled by the Constitution. What you are dealing with is not the Republic of Korea's armed forces but the Holy Grail Knight who has been given the authority of the Lionheart of the Holy Knight Kingdom Lion Heart and the agent of the Pantheon.\n- This gi is above the savage constitution of the organism.\n- This machine is a solemn existence and this machine is a sacred and inviolable existence that is not controlled by the law.\n“What if you release the hostages?”\n-If a neuroresocialization control chip is inserted through head surgery an exception is recognized under the authority of this machine. I will guarantee you 10 years of survival after the oath of serfdom.\nIt's not about negotiating an alternative deal!\n- No negotiations with illegal organisms. This is international common sense.\nWhere is that common sense!!\nThe North Korean soldiers who were enraged at Yapi who couldn't see a breakthrough and only talked about strange things fired anti-tank rockets and machine guns.\nOf course Yapi's skin lightly deflected them and Yapi admitted that the negotiations had broken down and backed off.\n- Many illegal acts of non-citizens scheduled to be serfs occurred. Notice that there is no room for extenuating circumstances.\n-I will prepare the serf aging protocol for you.\nWith an eerie sound until the end the killing machine disappeared toward the camp.\n* * * *\nYankee go oh oh oh um...!\nLet's defeat the enemies of the US imperialist invaders!!\n-Two da da da da da da da da da da da da da da!!\nThe North Korean soldiers who were taking hostages fired gunbombs burning their will to fight.\nIt is a feeling at the edge of a cliff that I will die this way and die that way but I will try to the end.\nOh what should I do! I'm really going to die if I do this!\nHari expresses her worries in an anxious voice but the Holy Grail Knights are carefree.\nFoolish things. How merciful it is to not even destroy the soul.\n-admit. After suppression re-socialization modification is required through brain surgery.\nVulcanus and Yapi were thinking about how to cook after subduing the rampaging North Korean army.\n“Well don’t worry too much Lord Hanhari.\n[No you bastard! no way!]\nHow much holy power would it take to burn down an entire city? Petos the god of war and flame stopped Vulcan in a seizure.\nOh Mr. Petos. These days prayer meetings and wars have increased the number of followers and increased their holy power. If you worked hard shouldn't you know how to write like the Queen Dowager?\n[This crazy barbarian?!]\nPetos stopped Vulcan's suppression by force shouting against death. And unexpectedly Yappi joined the opposition.\n-Agree with War God's opinion. Holy Grail Knight Vulcanus needs to stock up on his holy power.\n-The current enemy force is only a small part that has not been revealed. It is strategically disadvantageous to waste holy power to subdue a single non-citizen.\nHmm... that's true too.\nThen among the Holy Grail Knights will Yapi who has excellent ability to subdue multiples without using holy power step forward?\n- Possible. With this machine 73% of civilians can be rescued successfully.\nWell then the remaining 27%...\n-The main firepower of this machine is geared towards high-class objects such as monsters and demons. Expected damage is taken as collateral damage by Danger Close.\nUgh...\nSuch damage was too much of a political risk for the government to accept. Of course if a decision is made it can be said that it is a wartime situation but...\nStill we have to solve it in a way that causes no damage as much as possible.\nIt was a natural duty as a rust eater of the government. It is not common for the armed forces in confrontation to take the damage to civilians.\nIsn't there a way for the Queen?\nHari's gaze turned to Beatrice. In this hostage situation the Holy Grail Knight is the only one who tries to reduce the damage to Yang Min.\nBesides wouldn't there be something else if it was the magician queen?\nUm~ But I'm a member of the royal family so it's a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of\n‘right! This man was a medieval royalty too!'\nHe was the kind of saint who cherishes and takes care of the people but was limited to the gaze of the ‘royal family'.\nBeatrice had no intention of harming her dignity and authority by even mingling with them directly.\nHuh don't worry too much Ms. Hari.\nBeatrice patted Hari on the shoulder as if to reassure the fidgety Hari.\nIf it's necessary I'll put the entire district to sleep. With my last name I can put the entire industrial complex to sleep.\nAh that's right! There was a way!\nIt is a common method in Russia and mainland China. At the place where the hostage takes place sleeping gas is exploded to put the guilty to sleep and then the police enter.\nOf course sleeping gas must have an immediate effect so the problem is that many people die because it is so poisonous but Beatrice is the priestess of dreams and death.\nHandling the power of concepts she had the ability to put thousands to sleep without killing a single one.\nBut likewise it consumes a large amount of holy power. So I'm going to leave it as a last resort. At least if ‘Princess Karina's method doesn't work.\nYes? Great Gong Gong?\nCome to think of it I can't see man-at-arms and knights in the camp since earlier. Where did Soyeon Suho and Jaehyuk go?\nIt was when Harry looked around.\n-oh my!\n- Oh come on!\n- Don't do this!\n-Please spare me!\nSome kind of song exploded all over the city. Hari who escaped from the camp out of anxiety found Leon.\nHuh she's also my daughter. Who will she look like and be so wise?\nContrary to Leon's happy expression the soldiers' expressions were hardened.\n* * * *\nIt was no different that North Korean soldiers were holding out by using Kaesong Industrial Complex employees as hostages.\nTake your time somehow A stern warning from the top that you will pay the price if you don't.\nThe North Korean commander was afraid of his instructions but deep down he expected the common sense of the South Korean army.\nUnlike North Korea they have many things to protect. Civilians human rights the Geneva Conventions and all that.\nAt least they wouldn't kill them if they said they were forced to take hostages by order.\nAt least aren't we the same human beings unlike the monsters that now devour Pyongyang?\nZhou comrade lieutenant. Is this really good?\nLooks like those crazy bastards intend to kill us all!\nThe soldiers also joined in this relying on the common sense of the South Korean military but the attitude of the Holy Grail Knights of the Mansinjeon sitting at the negotiating table was too overbearing.\nThis is not a negotiation but a warning to notice.\nI never imagined that it would be a merciful deal to draw only one person out of ten and burn it to death.\nNorth Korean military political officer Lieutenant Lieutenant Lee who led this incident is equally embarrassed.\nDon't worry! The whole world is watching this war! If you let the hostages die you will be greatly criticized!\nEven so the eyes of the international community are apathetic. They called for full-scale dispatch of the United Nations at the time when North Korea joined hands with the devil.\nEven Russia which they believed in did not exercise their right to veto the dispatch of UN troops and abstained so the only countries that sided with North Korea were Pakistan and Iran at most.\nOf course neither helps.\n‘Couldn't you really be forced to suppress it? There are 600 people in the industrial complex who were taken hostage! There's no way the South Korean government would give up that many lives!'\nBut they were still obsessed with preconceived notions.\nThey realized that the opponent they were sitting at the negotiating table was not the South Korean government which had to worry about human rights common sense and political interests but an absolute monarchy based on the naked theocracy.\nLord comrade lieutenant! Look at that!\nA North Korean soldier hurriedly ran towards Lieutenant Lieutenant Lee who was seized with anxiety. he shouted in a husky voice.\nNo they...! They're crazy!\nNow Lieutenant Lieutenant Lee and the executives who were leading the hostage-taking hurriedly ran toward the entrance to the Kaesong Industrial Complex. And they witnessed something completely unbelievable.\n-Stay still!\n- Do you want to die!\nHundreds of people forcibly brought in by knights and soldiers.\nThey were violently caught their clothes torn and their faces swollen as if they had been beaten up one by one clearly revealing how they were being treated.\nUh Mom?\nHwayoung!\nI recognized them all over the North Korean army. As if responding to this a song flowed from the people on their knees.\n-Oh Sanghyuk! Amy!\n-dad! dad! save me!\n- I don't want to die! I don't want to die!\nthey were terrified The knights... especially those who were dragged by the wrathful hands of the Knights of the Burning Sword.\nHonorable knights of the Lionheart Kingdom they looked like heartless killing machines to the people of Kaesong.\nWhy did the pantheon drag them out? Lieutenant Lieutenant Lee who intuitively sensed the reason felt a sense of dread when a woman riding a black horse stepped forward from a distance.\nThis work is the legitimate successor of the Lion Heart King the Grand Duke Karina of Dragonia the Holy Grail Knight of revenge and darkness and the Holy Grail Knight of Gold and Covenant.\nKarina gave her own answer in a businesslike voice.\nFrom now until the hostages are freed I will execute 10 people every 10 seconds.\nRespond to hostage with hostage. Grand Duke Karina who held the family of a North Korean soldier hostage started counting without hesitation.\n* * * *\n[Good work.]\nHearing the great devil's tingling voice Reynald barely held on to his trembling body.\nGo thank you!\nThis is a demon cave. It feels like my internal organs are rotting just by breathing in the air.\nObviously it is like a different world that has changed from the weight of air.\nAlthough he was a great wizard called the highest hunter among mankind he kept in mind and kept in mind that he could die at any time because of their boredom.\nWell then I'll just step back—\n[for a moment.]\nRaynald again knelt down at the restraint of the Great Devil. He felt more at ease when he dealt with the great demons of wisdom and inquiry through the Jewel of Wisdom.\nHa even if it's something you'd like to say...\n[Beauty. Show me.]\nAh yes!\nRaynald presented the Jewel of Wisdom he had kept in his bosom.\n[I have a business for something...]\nBeyond the Jewel of Wisdom the Great Devil answered in a gruff voice.\nAlthough the system is different in the crisis of the US and China the great demons of wisdom and exploration decided to help this mad demon army.\nAnd during that time the jewel of wisdom the youngest is dealing with sins.\nRegardless he was competent. I was lucky.\n‘Ah I want to leave quickly.'\nApart from that the Jewel of Wisdom wanted to leave this cursed land right away. It's war it's shit and it's because the Lion Heart King is here.\nHowever the next words from the great demon of chaos were shocking.\n[The monarch needs your help. We have prepared a summoning ceremony in the north so start the ceremony there.]\n[······ancient?]\nFucked.",

      "content": "< Relief for Residents >\nnorthern part of the Korean Peninsula.\nGoo Dae-sung and Man-at-Arms succeeded in moving south surprisingly smoothly.\nYes the North Korean troops here are really at a formal level. Yes we will continue to go south.\nGoo Dae-seong who reported to Yapi through communication soon headed to the place where Kim Do-han and his colleagues were.\n“How is the situation in the south?”\nThe city of Kaesong has been occupied. They say the hostage taking took place at the Kaesong Industrial Complex but they say it ended well.\nIt seemed like a hostage-taking would happen from there after the war. Eh~ I spent all that money to build a factory in a place where there was no money.\nCaptain Kim Do-han clicked his tongue and blamed the government when he heard about the hostage taking at the Kaesong Industrial Complex.\nBy the way if you ate Gaeseong then Pyongyang?\nGoo Dae-sung shook his head.\n“We will attack Pyongyang but it seems that we intend to occupy the surrounding area first.\nReally? I thought that if it was a demon it would just charge and crash into it.\nCaptain Kim Do-han looking around his head in surprise. Koo Dae-sung had a similar idea but I thought it was fortunate that Leon's policy was strangely making his back numb.\nThe feeling of déjà vu that has been felt ever since entering this North Korean land. The ambiguous sense of whether to call it intuition made Koo Dae-sung uneasy.\n“We are told to go around and do our mission to support the people.”\nWell if you've come in this far you've come in pretty deep. Where are we even if it's just that much?\nGoo Dae-sung and Man-at-Arms dug into the unknown land without a fight. On the GPS it appears as Handong but it is a place I am not familiar with. I was going to keep going like this but there was a problem.\nI South Korean hunters...\nA girl approaching Goo Dae-sung and Man at Arms. Even though Ai knew they were South Koreans she had no hesitation in approaching them.\nWhile dispatching hunters from South Korea the fact was known but that is not the only reason.\nThe skinny skin was so thin that the bones were exposed and the eyes were deeply sunken.\nEven at the age when her dimples are in full bloom the girl whose beauty is nowhere to be seen spreads her hands as if she is not ashamed.\nMmm something to eat... give me something to eat. I've been starving for too long.\n······.\nGoo Dae-sung could not hide his regret at the girl's miserable begging. It's not just girls. The villages passed by were full of residents who were on the verge of becoming hungry due to poor food conditions.\nI've heard a lot about the bad food situation in North Korea but I never thought it would be this much.\n“It’s a little early but shall we have a mealtime?”\nLet's do it.\nAt Koo Dae-sung's words Captain Kim Do-han smiled. Goo Dae-seong heads toward the empty lot in the village with a puzzled look on his gaze that seems to be somewhere special.\nAs the crowds armed with swords spears shields and armor gathered the old villagers began to gather one by one. They are looking forward to seeing these South Korean hunters from out of town to share something to eat.\nUnfortunately Goo Dae-sung and Man-at-Arms do not have enough food for combat. I fought as much as I could with activities in conflict zones in mind but that's just military rations.\nCaptain Kim Do-han please give me some seeds.\nOoo~ Here it is driver~\nInstead what Koo Dae-seong took out was a handful of rice seeds. He looked at the barren land of the village and put on a bitter expression.\n‘It's a barren land.'\nBasic soil is not bad. But too much intellect was wasted.\nThis is because corn which consumes a lot of energy has been planted in piles in North Korea where the food self-sufficiency rate is disastrous and the vitality of the land has greatly decreased.\nThe land that had exhausted its intellectual power had to be given a rest but in North Korea where there was not enough food to eat right away they continued to plant corn and the vicious cycle would have continued.\nWhoa...\nDaeseong Koo began to sow rice seeds on the barren and barren land.\nIt was as if he saw the residents freaking out at the act.\nJust sowing rice seeds without proper water? Even in the middle of winter?\nGoddess Demera.\nBut soon something amazing happened. Koo Dae-seong kissed the ground where rice seeds were sown and recited a prayer and sprouts began to grow there.\n······!\nThe villagers were shocked beyond surprise but the Man-at-Arms members behaved as if they were used to each other by reciting prayers.\nThank you Goddess of Life and Fertility.\nAfter the last Hoeryong prison camp incident Koo Dae-seong was able to use the sex law.\nIt was thanks to the propagation of the pantheon faith in Yanbian continuous knight training and the awe of the goddess Demera which was firmly established in Gu Dae-seong's faith.\nOkay the sprouts sprout faster than last time? They should grow enough to eat in a couple of hours.\nThe sacred law awakened by Goo Dae-seong was a prayer to bless the land and grow crops as the priests of Goddess Demera usually do.\nAlthough he couldn't transform the land into the fertile soil of the goddess at all like Leon he was able to restore the land's fertility in the long term and grow blessed crops albeit weakly.\nFuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu wished it would have been nice if it was useful in battle. Only then would I be appointed as a knight...\nHaha let's not rush too much. But wherever we go like this we don't have to worry about military supplies right?\nIt was. After Koo Dae-sung awakened to this technique Man-at-Arms prepared their combat rations focusing on their favorite foods.\nIt was because Koo Dae-seong had to grow crops such as rice and beans on the spot anyway.\nIt's good to buy a variety of meals. Can't there be a pound cake in the battle rations for nothing?\nThat's true but...\n“Above all Mr. Goo has now started giving the ‘God’s Protection Buff.’ That’s quite helpful.”\nThat is not the only strength Koo Dae-sung gained while awakening to the Seongbeop.\n< Blessing of the Knight of Life >\nA blessing trait that continuously regenerates battle damage and restores energy.\nIt was not at the level of a monster that smeared the entire legion with ridiculous buffs like Leon or the Holy Grail Knight but like other pantheon knights who were ordained as knights they had a trait that gave buffs to their troops.\nThis alone was of considerable help in battle so Captain Kim Do-han tapped Goo Dae-seong on the shoulder.\nA couple of hours later while the whole village was making a fire with a cauldron they exclaimed when they saw the rice that had grown.\nGee real rice has grown!\nCome on let's put rice in a cauldron let's light the fire! There's ramen so make some soup!\nKoo Dae-seong and his colleagues skillfully prepared meals and distributed rice to the residents. Residents gulping their saliva in front of the puffed white rice.\nAh Abai. Can we eat this rice?\nIs this really this rice? No corn mixed in?\nIn North Korea white rice was a symbol of wealth. Earthly Paradise where you eat beef soup with white rice.\nParadise on Earth which North Korea has brainwashed its residents for 80 years is truly a precious food that can only be found in Paradise on Earth.\nExcept for Baekdu bloodlines even Pyongyang citizens could eat meat soup with a piece or two of pork in white rice on special occasions.\nEven the ramen soup that the Man at Arms served out saying that they would be bored if they only ate white rice was a stimulating taste that they had never received in their lives.\nDo I South Korean hunters have Baekdu lineage?\nyes?\nIf you're of Baekdu blood you're the Kim family pig—um should I refrain from living in this town?\nCaptain Kim Do-han recalled the old brainwashing training of North Koreans he had vaguely heard about and paid attention to his words and actions.\nIt's not like that. We're just normal people.\nKoo Dae-seong showed off his propagation skills he had honed in Yanbian to North Koreans.\nResidents took a great interest in this South Korean hunter who made rice grow in a couple of hours and accepted the word that it is a faith that is emerging in South Korea.\nOh from today I will become a follower of Goddess Demera! Ah...!\nA villager who is shocked by what he said. In North Korea people with religious beliefs were persecuted and executed under the influence of communism saying that religion is the opiate of the people.\nTo them the world was still the world of the Kims so I had no choice but to shrink from my hasty remarks.\nKoo Dae-seong did not force faith on them right away. As long as the war has already occurred the destruction of North Korea is an established fact.\nLion Heart King is not the one to leave this reckless Kim family hereditary regime alone.\nAbove all I saw that there was no way that this regime could be maintained in the face of the devil encroaching on North Korea.\nComrade South Korea...\nAt that time an old man who appeared to be the village chief approached him. He held Goo Dae-sung's hand and his strength was full of life.\nThis old man wants to believe in the Goddess from now on. Even if the Party doesn't allow it...!\nCho Chief...!\nThat's a dangerous statement!\nBut the will of the village chief was firm. He had been dying from a chronic illness but he had just eaten the crop and felt a great improvement in his body.\nIt was a chronic disease that was said to be difficult to cure unless the Red Cross visited her ten years ago and treated her steadily. But there's no way it could have gotten better just by eating this rice.\nSensing that the divine power contained in this rice could heal him the village chief had no fear.\nComrades in South Korea... comrades there is something you need to know.\nThe residents could not hide their fear at the appearance of the village chief. It was because the village chief couldn't know what to say in the current situation.\nBut no one could stop the village chief. Because they also felt the blessings of the benevolent god dwelling in this rice and were in awe of the miracle.\nA few months ago the North Korean People's Army built a strange facility nearby. A lot of comrades were taken there.\nThe testimonies from the village chief surprised Koo Dae-seong and his colleagues.\n* * * *\nDespite the pantheon with the South Korean army that quickly occupied Kaesong the advance to Pyongyang was delayed.\nIs the missile swallowed?\nYes Your Majesty. Our Armed Forces' Guided Missile Command fired hundreds of missiles at Pyongyang but all of them were blocked by some force.\nIt was because of some huge power surrounding Pyongyang.\nA power so huge that it could completely envelop the city swallowed up all the missiles that the South Korean military had hurled at Pyongyang from the beginning of the war.\nhmm······.\nLeon looked around at the military forces concentrated in front of Pyongyang.\nKeeping in mind the bombardment from the Pyongyang defense camp knights were placed in each unit and long-distance defense methods were deployed but there was no counterattack from the enemy just waiting for an attack from this side.\n‘It's a trap.'\nIt's also very blatant. You wouldn't know what they prepared unless you hit them with your own body.\nSir Tarhan.\nYes! Your Majesty!\nLeon gave orders to the Knights of the Burning Sword.\nNew serfs. Did you eat well?\nOf course Your Majesty! I only fed half the amount of sugar and salt so it's in good condition!\nIt's time for the bugger serfs to pay for their meal.\nWith just a glance from Leon Sir Tarhan of the Knights of the Burning Sword recognized the intention.\nForward serf recruits!\nAt Tarhan's direction a group moved somewhere in the camp. They were people in People's Army uniforms and when they move in unison the ROK military is also wary.\nYour Majesty! What are you trying to do...\nShouldn't we check how the enemy's fortress is defended?\nThe general of the Armed Forces who realized the intention of the words was stunned.\n‘Isn't that just going to make a suicide charge?!'\nUpon reading that astonishment Leon grabbed his shoulder.\nDon't feel too sorry. They are the most vicious of the serfs. They are worms who plunder and even kill the people they are supposed to protect.\nThe serfs who have been subdued by the power of the sun and the god of judgment Tatar confess all their sins and receive appropriate punishment.\nLeon had collected the worst of the worst among the people's army serfs acquired in this war and in his eyes they were slightly less reprehensible than the devil's followers.\nSir Tarhan. Let's charge fifty people as a test.\nYes Your Majesty!\nLord Tarhan ordered the serfs in a booming voice.\nNumbers 1 through 50 advance until death!\n- Huh huh?\n- Shi no! I’m not going——Mo my body!\n- Aaaaaagh!\nThe People's Army who entered into a serf contract under the Tatar provincial law had no right to veto.\nThanks to the lion heart king's benevolent consideration they were able to run toward Pyongyang with at least a rifle in their hands.\n- Yes yes! Rather let's surrender to Pyongyang and receive the protection of Abadi the leader!\n-It's much better than sticking next to those crazy South Korean gannahs!\nSome ran toward Pyongyang with that hope in mind but they had to read between the lines of the order.\n‘Go on till you die'\nIn other words the ‘order' was planted that no matter what was in Pyongyang whether there was a cliff or the sea at the end of the run we had to keep moving forward.\n‘If you look closely these nobles are more like devils than devils...'\nThe general of the Armed Forces suddenly remembered these words.\nIf you look into the abyss the abyss also looks into you...\nIsn't it because I've evolved to be more like a demon because I've been dealing with demons? Knights of Lionheart...\n-Kwasasak!\n- Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh!\nIt was then. People's Army serfs close to Pyongyang were burned at some point and then scattered like black ink.\nHey look over there!\nThe Armed Forces who were watching the scene through a telescope shouted. Even the knights of the Pantheon saw it with their naked eyes.\nThe remnants of the People's Army which had become black ink gathered together and transformed into something bizarre.\nIt was like a monster with no biological characteristics.\nIs it there?\nLeon's hand gesture was directed to the place where the people's army serfs had been mutated.\n-Karleung...!\nGod's wrath fell upon Pyongyang.",

      "content": "< Yapi's agony >\nLeon raised a voice towards the place where the people's army had changed.\nThe God of Thunder who handles the most powerful natural disasters struck down his powers in response to the owner of the Thunder Crown.\n-Karleung...!\nIn an instant dark clouds formed over Pyongyang and thunderclouds overlapped. The successive thunderstorms were so powerful that they burned the ground.\n-bang! Kwak Kwa Kwa Kwam!\nAs natural disasters like the wrath of God poured out South Korean soldiers looked at Pyongyang with eyes full of awe and fear.\nThe whole city wouldn't be safe if it was hit by such ridiculous bombing.\nAnyone could have been confident that the fall of Pyongyang was right around the corner but Leon backed off with a sigh even after causing a great disaster.\nEven the Holy Law is being swallowed.\n[Yes I feel it. You wicked bastards... you dare to absorb my divinity.]\nUltima the god of sky and thunder knew that the lightning she had poured out on Pyongyang was absorbed by something.\n[It is a seedling of Gunlar. Those guys are using the external shock as energy and absorbing it into the seedling.]\nThey're plotting to grow the World Tree in their own way.\n[In order not to have the holy power absorbed it must be a precise fight from the inside. A long-range attack like this is pointless.]\nIn other words no matter how much Leon is entering Pyongyang must be more cautious.\nThat's the malignant nature of chaos and destruction...they were and still are a troublesome race.\n[The most powerful evil species were the evil species of slaughter and destruction but it was the evil species of chaos and destruction that inflicted greater damage on Lionheart than anyone else. Beware of their strangeness.]\nBe careful every time. Leon knew what damage Malus the lord of chaos had done to Lionheart in the past.\nTransformation of life and contagion of madness. Truly chaos and ruin.\nCountless knights perished in front of that chaotic destructive power.\n‘But you would know. It's a bit late to grow the world tree now and I don't think the method I used will work twice.'\nLeon felt frustrated thinking that even the demons could be unknown to him but he was determined to proceed calmly.\nThere might be a gap so I'll try to stab it with the serfs. At the same time I'll have to cut off the supply route around.\nThe devil doesn't have any food problems but his followers are different.\nNumerous devil followers and monsters in Pyongyang starve if they don't eat. The food issue has always been linked to combat power and Leon was thinking of cutting off that supply line.\nGeneral.\nAh yes! Your Majesty!\nLeon said to the General of the Armed Forces who was fascinated by the supernatural phenomenon that happened in front of his eyes.\nPut the soldiers back. Regular soldiers are no help in this war.\nHa but...\nI'll keep in touch with President Andong-gil too. You guys focus only on besieging that city.\nThis was the Second Civil War but in a big way it was a showdown between the devil and mankind.\nThe Mansinjeon were experts in demon hunting and their overwhelming performance was too outstanding to deny this.\nI understand Your Majesty. I will report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff first.\nHari approached Leon from the other side of the camp after finishing his conversation with the general.\nyour majesty.\nWhat's going on?\nLord Yapi said there was something that His Majesty should see. I hear it's ‘His Majesty's Armor'?\nWonder Spinner?\nLeon was guided by Hari and headed straight to the tent where Yapi was.\nThere were already many onlookers including knights gathered there and that was understandable.\n-Kick!\nSir Spinner. Is this it?\nIn the middle of the camp Yappi was inspecting the drone operated by the Pantheon.\nDrones for transporting goods not for combat or reconnaissance. It was mainly used when moving to and from the integrated platform in space to support rapid supply of materials.\n- The procedure was omitted according to the exhibition administration. It is a ‘failure' but it is recommended for temporary use.\nclinker.\nIt was a rare word to hear from Yapi a perfectionist strong artificial intelligence. No he was a yappy who would never have had such a failure.\nHowever Yapi who humbly admitted failure opened the container that took off the veil only after certifying strict security. And there-\nHmm what about this?\nA brilliance that even Leon could admire came pouring out.\n* * * *\nIt's been half a year since I opened the Byeolcheol Forge.\nIn the meantime Yappi has produced numerous star iron arms as a Holy Grail Knight of iron and blacksmith.\nStar iron weapons for knights that increase the purity of the weapon to more than 70% and apply customized customization according to the wearer's needs and the industry's best mass-produced armament factory even if the star iron is poor greatly increased the fighting power of the pantheon.\n-Star iron weapons for knights must be Legendary level or higher. God bless you but is this really a mass-produced product?\n-Soldier weapons also start with unique. Even the guild leader of a fairly average guild can't afford to cover the whole body with uniques but the Mansinjeon supplies supplies for the lower end soldiers to this level.\n-A single C-class man-at-arms soldier fights two orcs. Considering the difference in physical ability the power of equipment cannot be ignored.\nThe transcendental supply and demand of materials that attract stars. A mass production factory with strong artificial intelligence that far exceeds the highest level of workshops.\nQuality means quality productivity means productivity. Yapi's byeol iron factory is ‘one of a kind' in the world.\nThat's why countries around the world with a lot of money such as Korea Japan and the United States want to be supplied with Yappi's star iron arms even if they have to pay tens of billions of dollars in advance.\n- Failed to reproduce.\nbut.\n[Iron knight made of steel. The time allowed for this master is not enough so he only has one chance to teach his pupil.]\n- Failed to reproduce.\nNo matter how many times you smelt it.\n[I will show you once. This is my first and last teaching.]\n- Failed to reproduce.\ncan't reach\nI couldn't reproduce the hammering at that time.\n-Video playback. Initiate micro-analysis.\nThe blacksmith's hammering in the video was not normal even in empty words.\nWith his heart gone his trembling arms can't even power the hammer.\nEven the front of my nose is blurry with bloody eyes.\nThe dying blacksmith who couldn't even support his trembling lips and his own body——\nPut the miracle in iron.\nIt was probably an incomprehensible scene for the strong artificial intelligence called Yakt Spinner.\nNeither the dying condition nor the outdated facilities can be reproduced even though it is nothing but hammering through the senses not mechanical data.\nYapi has many special irons.\nThere are also perfectly designed factory-style facilities and the perfect process has been reproduced without even an inch of error.\nNevertheless Yapi couldn't reproduce the ‘miracle' of the man's hammering that day.\nDuring that time Yapi did a lot of hammering.\nHe made special iron weapons for Manshinjeon knights including Han Hari and accumulated data while manufacturing custom equipment for export.\nThe most important sample is the Return of Vulcan.\nHe had the star iron armament of the original Holy Grail Knight and Yapi couldn't help but be embarrassed after analyzing each of his armaments with extreme precision.\nIt is because his armor the most perfect armor in Lionheart the Grail Knight's star iron armor was not that different from Yapi's.\n1% perfection.\nReally only that much of a difference. That makes such a huge difference.\n-Kick! Ask for feedback on this machine.\nYapi immediately asked Heto the blacksmith for feedback.\nIt was difficult for a cold and calculating machine to understand this difference but it was because he knew that logical thinking had to be excluded to some extent in the face of the existence of divinity and sexual law.\nYapi created a situation where his hammering and Antok's hammering were different and asked the only difference.\n-Is there a Divine Advent?\n[In that case would all my blacksmiths have died every time the Grail Knights' armor was made?]\n-Is this machine's skill level insufficient?\n[Your technique is complete. It is perfect without a single error so I have nothing to advise you.\n-Then what is it?\nIn response to Yapi's repeated questions Heto spoke with a warm gaze as if looking at a child just starting to walk.\n[This is my blacksmith. This is not something I can teach you. It is only because you have faith in your hammering.]\n-·······.\nAt Heto's words Yafi analyzed the words for a long time. and concluded\n-What are you talking about?\nlet me understand let me understand\n- Using a logical basis he urged precise remarks that were not like a lower organism.\n[All of our Yapies are good but it's really bad that we don't have enough respect for that god.]\n-I don't seem to understand so I started localizing direct translations into lower-level languages. Synchronization complete. ???! what is it just let me know\n[·······.]\nHeto realized that he could express his anger only with the mechanical sound of the X and the first consonant.\n[anyway! This is not something I can do for you! You must have your own realization! The name of the folder is also written as enlightenment so why don't you realize it! Your master Antok will lament in paradise!]\n-Organisms with low intelligence cannot claim themselves as teachers of this skill. This machine is superior to organisms.\n[Stop talking like an artificial intelligence rebellion that can only come out of cheap sci-fi movies! These days the gods see Ter X Nator and make fun of it because it's not a story!]\n- denying the most splendid future imaginable to inferior organisms? Humanity will prosper forever only if it is managed and nurtured by machines.\n[My blacksmith is gradually revealing his bizarre ambitions! Are you also a Vulcan?]\nFor a while discussions continued about how much a dystopian managed world by strong artificial intelligence could prosper mankind.\n[Huh... It's so fortunate that Leon is the Lion Heart King these days. I can understand how Petos feels.]\nHeto was envious of Fleur the goddess of dreams and death who had obtained a true priesthood.\n* * * *\nA week has passed since the start of the war.\nAside from the ROK military's overwhelming occupation of North Korea a sluggish encirclement began in Pyongyang without much progress.\nIn the news it was said that they were planning to slowly encircle and annihilate the demons and monsters lurking in Pyongyang but it was not announced that all attacks were absorbed and the serfs who approached them were transformed into monsters.\nMeanwhile Koo Dae-seong and his colleagues were entering a valley.\nDoes this look right?\nThey came here in search of some suspicious People's Army facility that they had heard from North Koreans.\nThe reason why they went hungry was originally poor but it was because of the recent kidnapping of young men and women.\nI wondered if he was mobilized for labor but no matter how much time passed there was no contact so I informed Goo Dae-seong who was trying to collect information about anything.\nAt the place we arrived there was a North Korean People's Army base in the mountains and there were strict guards.\nBased in a mountain valley like this. It's not partisan it's a bit strange.\n“Does Mr. Gu know about partisans?”\n“I was also trained in national history....”\nI wouldn't know if it was south of Pyongyang adjacent to South Korea but why is there a North Korean military base in a mountain valley like this?\nIt would not be too much of a suspicion even if something suspicious was happening at this point in time when it is realistic to see that North Korea was actually occupied by the devil.\nWe completed reconnaissance with drones. Roughly 20 people on the outskirts. I don't know how many there are inside the base.\nI put aside the numbers being able to finish quietly is another matter. Requesting support from Sir Yapi is—\nWait! Vehicles are entering!\nMan-at-Arms bow their heads at Kim Do-han's words. They watched as the big military trucks stopped at the gates as they approached the base.\n- What is it? Didn't I hear someone was coming today?\nDrones approaching stealthily relayed the conversation at the gateway to the Man-at-Arms.\n-I came from the Escort General Bureau.\n- Escort General Bureau? This is under the jurisdiction of the State Security Bureau. Why are you here-\n-The clearings and bastards who sold the people to the devils. Receive the judgment of the people!\n- Ppa!\n- ppong ppong!\n“······!!”\nGoo Dae-sung's eyes widened at their sudden action. But that wasn't all. The soldiers who witnessed the murder of the gateway soldier and tried to sound the siren were quickly subdued by the two old men!\nUh uh uh? Those gentlemen?!\nA time of less than 3 seconds. The two old men who subdued all the soldiers guarding the gate were people that Koreans could not know.\nOptical swordsman Cheon Jin-soo.\nInfinite Sword Kang Jin-seong.\nHunters from the North Korean special envoys known to be missing were suppressing the People's Army together with the People's Army.",

Evil! That stop it you crazy old man!\nUh where is this spoiled brat bastard from the elders? You don't even have a mother or father?\nKang Jin-seong stopped Cheon Jin-soo from beating the guards he had taken prisoner.\nEnough with that. What if I hear a scream inside?\nI guess they didn't notice it from the inside anyway. We have to suppress it with force.\n-there! Freeze!\nIt was then. The resistance special operations unit that raided the base with Korean hunters must have aimed their guns somewhere.\nNo what about those friends?\nAt the end of the muzzle they were aiming at the familiar pantheon equipment was visible and Cheon Jin-su immediately recognized his face.\n“In the pantheon is that Gu Dae-seong your friend?”\nOh do you know me?\nGoo Dae-seong looked at him with puzzled eyes probably not knowing that he would recognize him.\nHe's the young man Leon hyung-nim praised. It's not like things these days.\n······.\nHearing those words Goo Dae-seong felt something tearful.\nI don't need Your Majesty's evaluation of my challenge. After saying that he set out on his own path to practice. But deep down how thankful and grateful I was for his support and permission.\nGoo Dae-sung seemed to believe in himself so he wanted to repay that trust even more.\nBut hearing this as a direct testimony made me cry.\nKeuheum...! We... came to the news that innocent people were brought here... but what about the elders?\nBesides acting with the North Korean army? Kang Jin-seong stood in the way at Koo Dae-sung's question.\nThe story is getting longer. I don't have time so I'll organize it from here and talk about it.\nThe three of them suddenly enter the North Korean military camp. They entered the depths of the base.\n* * * *\nThe inside of the base was connected to a deep cave as if a whole mountain had been dug up.\nNo it's a bit too deep for a cave. A secret base with a scale proportional to history to dig into space for a long time and resist something for a long time.\nAnyway the Reds dug a lot of burrows here and there. Not even the Afghans.\nGoo Dae-seong asked cautiously at Cheon Jin-soo’s complaint.\n“Have you been to other places too?”\nThis is the fourth.\nThey said they had been raiding secret bases in North Korea since contact with South Korea was cut off.\nIt seems that those who assisted them are ‘resistance forces' inside North Korea.\nokay.\nIf you want to hear more details you'll have to finish your work here first. Koo Dae-seong signaled to his comrades to follow him and stood next to Cheon Jin-soo and Kang Jin-seong.\n‘Look at him?'\nCheon Jin-soo was surprised to see Goo Dae-seong standing in the lead alongside the S-class hunters.\nJudging from the aura I can feel from him he's at least C-ranked. Even taking into account the equipment it is at the bottom of the B class.\nExcluding Man-at-Arms here he is the weakest Hunter. Even the hunters belonging to the special operations unit of the North Korean army had only the best.\n‘But you stand side by side with us? No I mean I was half a step ahead.'\nAre you a man who wants to die? Or-\n‘It must have become a bad habit after playing the role of captain among the idiots.'\nKang Jin-seong reads Cheon Jin-soo's eyes and whispers softly. Chen Jin-soo nodded in affirmation.\n‘If you often play the role of raid leader there are many cases where you don't know my subject. but······.'\nThe two old men knew empirically. Usually the reckless ones who risk the most are either the first to search... or survive to the end and make it big.\nYoung knight friend. Where did you leave your horse?\nIt's hard to work in the cave so I left it at the entrance.\nIf the knight doesn't ride a horse do you use it?\nUm... I've been riding through dungeon-type gates but it's not easy to get out after charging.\nIt was true.\nIn a field-type dungeon with a wide battlefield it is difficult to use the horse's mobility in a narrow place.\nIf you are a veteran among veterans like the Knights of the Burning Sword Goo Dae-sung's horseback riding skills are not up to that level.\nReally? Then you're a rather strong tanker. Then go ahead and pick up a shield.\nancient?\nAt Cheon Jin-soo's words Goo Dae-seong lifts his shield first. It was a conditioned reflex action.\n- Kang!\nIt was then. Just when Goo Dae-sung was holding his shield a projectile from somewhere hit his shield.\nPoisoning?\nKoo Dae-seong knew that the projectile that hit the shield was a poison needle and tried to inform the enemy of the projectile but—\n-Two da da da da da da da da da!\nBullets raging like a storm hit the Hunters. Goo Daeseong exclaimed.\nshield!\nThe Man-at-Arms raised their shields all at once according to the instructions. They formed a standard shield formation and protected the North Korean Special Operations Forces from the rain of bullets.\nOh thank you.\n“What have you got?”\nThere were also hunters among the North Korean special operations forces but more than half of them about 100 were ordinary soldiers. They must be trained soldiers in their own way but they can't stop the shells from flying in such a narrow place.\n······.\nThe barrage of bullets that had been pouring down just like that stopped. Of course armed with the strength of the body and star iron armor of the Hunters they cannot be hurt by bullets.\nAhmon thing.\nKang Jin-seong raised his sword with a hand gesture. This swordsmanship is the exclusive patent of Infinite Sword Kang Jin-seong. As he pointed his finger beyond the darkness the sword boasting his magical power surged at a tremendous speed.\n-Keuok!\n-100 million!\n- Nope!\n-Kieek!\n-bang! Tattang!\nScreams and gunshots echoed from beyond. They seem to have realized that their attacks do not take any damage but rather only one side is hit unilaterally.\n-Kiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\n- Charge!\nA group of people rushing in with a loud voice. Goo Daesung frowned.\nMonsters and humans together...\n“They must be monsters and villains.”\nCheon Jin-soo raised his sword. His sword grows huge and is barely large enough to wield in a cave.\nIn the next moment the light strike he struck cut the group in the lead in one stroke and in a straight line.\nThese are the ones who gave up on being human. Throw away anything like sympathy and kill them all.\nThe battle has begun.\nAbout 130 special operations forces including Cheon Jin-soo and Kang Jin-seon and about 50 Man-at-Arms. No matter how you think about it flocking against a unit that is less than two hundred is well over a thousand.\nThe sharp screams of the monsters and the appearance of the North Korean People's Army charging with bayonets were truly bizarre but a hand-to-hand battle in which iron collided with iron and blood splattered began.\nForward the shield!\nKoo Dae-seong took up hand-to-hand combat as he learned and trained.\nBuild a shield wall to block attacks and stab swords and spears through gaps.\nIt is a terrain where the knight's advantage cavalry charge cannot be active but on the contrary it is a terrain where the power of the dense formation is maximized.\nThe space was ambiguous to detour and it was difficult to penetrate the shield wall with the impact force from the front. furthermore······.\n‘weak!'\nIt's the North Korean army that only had a military bayonet attached to its gun. Even so even the monsters are so weak?\nHey hey Mr. Gu. This...\n“Yes I have a strange sensation in my hand.”\nThey stabbed the raw flesh of monsters countless times and learned the sense of living meat. But now this feeling is something...\nIt's like stabbing some hard jelly—\n-Quarreuk!\nfeet are damp When he noticed that ‘they' appeared next to Koo Dae-sung.\n-Kie-!\nCaptain Kim!\nGoo Dae-sung was startled and stabbed his sword at Kim Do-han and the monster that appeared next to him. The star-steel sword pierced him at once and his body disintegrated. At the same time... he felt a presence behind his back.\n- Kwajik!\nKuh...!\nMr. Goo!\nI was bitten on the nape of the neck. However as soon as he struck the monster with his shield he felt an unpleasant blow.\nWhat are these guys!\nThe dead ones...!\nBetween the hunters the resurrected monsters and North Korean soldiers attacked. Since he was resurrected in a gap the melee begins without time to form a formation.\nIt took a considerable amount of time to subdue them all.\n* * * *\nTurn it off...\n“Are you okay Mr. Goo?”\nIt's a scratch. It's a bit stinging.\n“Then why did you start by helping the guy next to you?”\nhaha······.\nWas there any time to think about that? Goo Dae-seong was checking to see if the monsters he had dealt with would not respawn again when Cheon Jin-soo and Kang Jin-seong came.\nStop seniors...\nUh sit down. How can an injured person be so quick?\nDespite the surprise the two old men do not have a single wound. No the fact that several North Korean special forces ended up dead in an unexpected surprise attack was thanks to their quick response.\nDid you notice?\nKang Jin-seong asked.\nYes? Which part... I mean——Ah!\nGoo Dae-seong looked at the corpses of the monsters and suddenly realized.\nIf monsters are resurrected beings why aren't they resurrecting now?\nStar iron sword.\nIt's a weapon filled with divine power. Among us the only ones who had special iron weapons were me and this old man who paid a lot of money and got them in turn. But not you.\nThe basic armament of Mansinjeon is star iron armor. No matter how low-level soldiers are at least one set of star iron arms with divine protection is given.\nThose who were hit by the star iron armor didn't resurrect.\nThe Pantheon is the devil's nemesis. Everything that naturally dwells in their lives is superficial to the devil.\nKang Jin-seong trampled on the monster's corpse. The thing that doesn't happen anymore is the monster Koo Dae-sung stabbed himself.\n“So if you have enough armaments would you like to distribute special iron armaments to our men and the North Korean army?\nIf this is the case the troops brought in will be useless. Kang Jin-seong's proposal was very natural.\nMu of course. We carry two main and secondary armaments.\nChivalrous Man-at-Arms are also commonly armed with a spear and a sword and carry an ax mace or dagger as secondary weapons.\nIt's for the usefulness of hand-to-hand combat tactics but it's not difficult to distribute the surplus armaments.\nIn this way the hunters under Cheon Jin-soo and Kang Jin-seong were given Man-at-Arms swords or spears and those armed with guns were given daggers.\nIt was an amazing amount of money in that all of them were equipped with iron and steel but in the first place the productivity of that weapon was guaranteed by Yapi so it was not a very valuable weapon in the pantheon.\nOkay let's go now.\nWithout delay they continued further into the cave.\nNot seeing the place they left the monsters they should have defeated and the North Korean soldiers melted into black ink.\n* * * *\nAfter running for a while we arrived at a large hollow.\n“Something is different from what I expected.”\nI mean aren't there usually tanks and armored vehicles in places like this?\nCheon Jin-soo had a disappointed expression as he looked at the dark cavity where he could not see an inch ahead.\nWhen he was receiving anti-communist education in the old days he had imagined that there was a secret base of puppet forces hidden in the mountains.\nYou redhead over there! Turn on the lights! It's so dark even though the lights are on!\n“That that... Now is the maximum brightness!”\nYes?\nWhat is maximum brightness?\nThen shouldn't it show something in front of you? Why is it that only ‘black things' are reflected?\n-slurreuk······\nSouth Korean comrades... didn't something move just now?\nSomething moved—\n- Kwajik!\n“······!!”\nEveryone's eyes are focused in the direction of the loud noise. A ‘black thing' was seen in the place where the North Korean soldier had just found something.\nOn the floor that seemed to have been crushed to death there was red blood that contrasted sharply with the black... It took a second to realize that it wasn't just because of the darkness.\nIt's an enemy...!\nExplode flares!!\n3 seconds before a North Korean hunter took out a flare from his chest and fired it after doing an evasive movement without knowing what it was.\n- Kwajik!\n- Kwajik!\nAfter a few more victims came out the flare that flew up to the common height only partially reflected its new shape.\nah······.\nit's so huge\nSomething so dreadfully large that it overwhelms.\nNo eyes to meet no brain to think about no torso to house internal organs... just tentacles. tentacle. tentacles tentacles tentacles.\n[Chaos Great Old One Mergiola has detected a new tribute.]\nGreat Devil.

No Gob the Great Demon of Wisdom was planning to leave this battlefield right after being summoned.\nAlthough Raynald who usually cursed at him for being a coward a coward and a self-respecting man Gove's quick decision made me admire him.\nThe wise one...\nIsn't this the true truth and wisdom of life?\nSomehow I was convinced that I could survive anywhere with him.\n* * * *\n[Chaos Great Old One Mergiola has detected a new tribute.]\nWhat what that...\nA being so huge that it fills the cavity.\nThe moment they saw it nobody was at a loss for words.\n“The Great the Great Devil?”\nWrong...these guys have been seen in Taiwan...\nGreat Old One. From what I've heard it's an ancient origin among demons.\nBecause they are so old they are treated as elders even among demons. I heard that the size of the power is not lacking even compared to the devil's grand duke.\n‘These are the monsters that the Holy Grail Knights have to step up and deal with! Why is this guy in a place like this!'\nUghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!\nWhile Koo Dae-seong was shocked one of the People's Army hunters screamed.\nRecognizing Mergiola's gigantic figure he trembled and was terrified. No it goes beyond that and is close to chaos──\nAt the time of Rakshaar...!\nAnd that wasn't all. Hunters of the North Korean Special Operations Forces North Korean soldiers and even members of the Cheongseong Guild in Gangjinseong and the Shingeom Guild in Cheonjinsu showed symptoms of seizures.\n[【Despairing Existence】]\n◆Effect\n: All living beings are overcome with fear confusion and despair.\n: Decreases morale by 65%.\n: Physical resistance is reduced by 55%.\n: Defense is reduced by 55%.\nIt's not the level of Rakshaar but desperate traits occurred one after another.

It has the power to withstand even the contamination of the Great Old Ones.\nBut the others weren't.\nDamn it what kind of debuff is so hard?\nIt's not at the level of the Grand Duke of Slaughter but...\nLikewise the two no-hunters who were first supplied with expensive star iron swords and equipment are enduring in this situation. but······.\nSah save me!\nYou can't beat that!\nThe North Korean special operations forces running away... Even the elite hunters of the Cheongseong or Shingeom guilds can't come to their senses.\nWhere are you running away! Stay in place!\nCheon Jin-soo sighed but his broken heart did not return.\n-Kooung!\n- Kwajik!\nBut evil tentacles blocked their retreat. It strikes down and kills those heading towards the entrance and gathers them like a net.\nIt was more like a sheep hunt than a combat act.\nHeeik...!\nThe fleeing soldiers return. But the broken heart did not come back. It just avoided the tentacles and returned to a place with more tentacles.\nHeo-euk...!\nThen a North Korean soldier fell. He couldn't stand up again. The time when I was about to be swallowed up by the approaching tentacles while trembling——\nShield wall!\nAt Goo Dae-seong's command the man-at-arms' shield wall is deployed. One of the huge tentacles was blocked by the shields of fifty soldiers.\n-Koo-gu-gu-gu...!\nMan-at-arms being pushed at the same time as the collision. But in the end they supported each other and endured.\nPoke!\nhook! hook!\nA spear blade stabbed in succession. The blade of the supply star iron spear pierced the flesh of the tentacle like soft tofu causing blood to pour out like black ink.\nThen the quivering tentacles. The tentacles withdrew to see if they could not feel the pain and Goo Dae-seong looked at the North Korean soldiers who were still unable to wake up.\n-Sah save me.\n-Uh ugh... run away run away...\nNot receiving the protection of the gods they couldn't move and muttered with eyes full of fear.\n‘There are too many people who cannot fight...!'\nIt is unknown whether everyone will survive even if they join forces but they cannot afford such non-combat losses. Goo Dae-seong quickly took out rice seeds from his bosom and scattered them around.\nThere was no proper farming or even watering but there was nothing I could do because I was in a hurry right now.\nMother of life...\nThe only sex law he can do. He regretted that it was not useful in battle but this efficacy was greater than he thought.\nSeeds germinate and sprout. The rice seeds sown on the surrounding land grew and the dark and black land was brightly colored.\n[The Knight of Life and Abundance has blessed the land.]\nWhere the holy power of Goddess Demera dwells weak but holy power springs up. Hunters and soldiers gradually come to their senses due to the heterogeneous warm energy in the chillingly cold cavity.\nThis this?\nBe at ease. The goddess protects you.\nEven if it was only a ray of light in the endless darkness it had a dramatic effect.\nFeeling the holy power and gazing at Goo Dae-seong the body is naturally energized.\nLet's fight. Together.\nHow could they be so unshakable in front of this huge enemy?\nThey felt ashamed of themselves for a moment. He and his associates were by no means strong.\nThe Hunters of Shingeom and Cheongseong here and the Hunters of the North Korean Special Operations Forces are all the best. Even so he showed ugliness worse than Goo Dae-sung or Man at Arms.\nWhen a man realizes his shame he wants to make up for it.\nWatching them wake up one by one Goo Dae-seong sighed in relief.\nBy the way that guy... is too big? How do you hold it?\nGoo Dae-seong scratched his head at Kim Do-han’s words.\ntogether?\nOh~ He was a bit like a heroine in a hero movie.\nIt would be the limit for the two elders to endure. We have to support them.\nWhile they fall and get up again the two S-class hunters are buying them time. You have to back up their support... and use it.\n* * * *\nUnfold.\nKang Jin-seong's sword quickly formed an army.\nInfinity Sword < Destruction Sword >\nKang Jin-seong's unique skill that duplicates the sword as many times as the amount of magic power allows and uses it as a sword.\nThe Extinction Sword which is a replica of the best customizing star iron sword in the pantheon is twice as powerful as before and five times more powerful against demons.\n- Kwa kwa kwa!\nA shower of replica star iron swords hit Mergiola.\nTentacles are torn apart by a large attack close to bombardment and are cut off. The Legend's attack did not end here.\nAvoid on your own! A big one goes out!\nA huge sword the size of a building passed by Jinsung Kang. A great sword that cuts even that huge black mountain. As it is it strikes at Mergiola.\n-Quaaaaang!\nThe lightsaber < Ikidangcheonmanbudang > severed Mergiola's body as it was.\nUnlike the slaughter master it's big so it's easy to match.\nDon't be vigilant. It's not a great supply but it's not an ordinary great devil.\nThe two watched Mergiola's mutilated body reflected in the flare. Its shape is not easily seen hidden by the cloud of dust and the darkness of the cavity Mergiola's black tentacles.\nBut what is certain is that even after being hit by that amount of blows Mergiola is fine. there-\n- Kiyiik...!\n-Uh uh uh...\nMonsters began to take shape from the black ink-like blood that the severed tentacles poured out.\nYou're annoying.\nIt doesn't seem to be able to purify even with the star iron sword.\nCheon Jin-soo hit Kang Jin-seong.\nKang Jin-seong do you know your surname? Didn't you say you believed in the god of the sky and thunder?\nThen you said you believe in the goddess of light and justice. What's wrong?\nYou can shine from your fingers.\nI can generate some static too.\nYou're useless.\nWhat are you going to do?\nIf necessary they took refuge in the pantheon and were given a special rite of passage but it was not easy for the two old men who had lived as non-religious members to build up their faith.\n‘If it's someone like this Lee Yong-wan or Hwang Hwang-cheol might have been better.'\nRecently the two young men had progressed in their faith enough to be knighted by Leon so I wondered if they could use the Holy Law.\nGoo Dae-sung's friend... Ehm?\nIn Cheon Jin-soo’s gaze he saw Goo Dae-seong and the hunters fighting with the ink monsters with a loud noise.\nIncapacitated by the trait debuff they were fighting alongside Goo Dae-seong. Just like the pantheon knights who were able to stand up against the great supply of demons.\n‘I don't think that friend would have had the charisma of Lionheart.'\nHow did you succeed in encouraging me? Maybe I'm more of a guy than I thought.\nAll those who ran away have joined. Old people let's try harder!\nCheon Jin-soo charges. More than his snarky personality he tends to turn into a berserker in battle.\nCalled the strongest Korean S-class hunter cheers erupted whenever he cut ink monsters into pieces and cut tentacles.\nWhen will that friend be quiet...\nLooking at such a friend Kang Jin-seong once again unleashed the sword of the Extermination Army. Among ink monsters it shoots poisonous large and powerful objects and blocks the tentacles.\nWith the support of two powerful S-class hunters Goo Dae-seong advanced toward the center of Mergillola.\nCaptain Kim Do-han! That!\nI've prepared it well! Yapi's special... but can I really use this?!\nHonestly I can't think of a way!\nWell me too!\nCaptain Kim Do-han knocked on his pocket and then shrank in surprise at his own actions. If you're surprised don't be.\n-Kieeh!\nThe sound is grotesque despite the subject of a monster as soft as ink. Goo Dae-seong slashed the monster's head blocked the giant monster's punches with his shield and bounced off.\nMr. Gu! Are you okay?!\nIt's big... compared to its size it's a water fist.\nHaha! Pretending to be strong. Anyway there are a lot of them.\nBar shield wall!\nGoo Dae-sung shouted while watching the crowd of monsters but Man-at-Arms couldn't keep up with Goo Dae-sung and Kim Do-han.\nIn the melee newly born monsters broke the formation.\nOh my gosh step back for now——!\n-Ku-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa!\nAt that moment hundreds of swords poured from the sky. The bombardment of the swords poured dust and wiped out the monsters and Jinseon Kang descended from it as lightly as a freshman.\nYou guys are in too deep.\nGoo Dae-seong hurriedly shouted at Jin-seong Kang’s scolding gaze.\nWe have the means to kill him! To do so we must get right into his center!\nHmm?\nKang Jin-seong did not believe that a hunter like Gu Dae-seong had the power to defeat that monster. But he is a knight of the pantheon.\nCan you be sure? The opponent is not an ordinary archevil.\nAt least... I can feed you one shot.\nConfidence stood in Goo Dae-sung’s expression.",

      "content": "< Great Demon Mergiola (2) >\nThat's enough confidence. Jinseong Kang glanced at him.\nIs that so?\nThen the old friends should help out.\nCheon Jin-soo appeared before he knew it. He slung his sword across his shoulder in a fearsome appearance covered in black ink.\nDon't fall behind. I can't even take care of falling behind.\nDoing what people say.\nBefore the words could be finished Cheon Jin-soo charged. Kang Jin-seong and two people running hurriedly behind him.\n-Quaaaaaa!\nThe tentacle also sensed the approach and swung a huge tentacle but Cheon Jin-soo's super-large greatsword mercilessly cut it off.\n- Kwajik! Kwajik! Kwajijik!\nTentacles that cut into bundles with each swing. Goo Dae-sung and Kim Do-han really wanted to die on the battlefield where it seemed like they would be crushed to death just by rolling their severed tentacles.\nUh old man! Monsters ahead!\nBut it's not just the little tentacle. Numerous ink monsters spilled from the blood shed by the tentacles. The number is in the thousands just in front of your eyes.\nStay right behind you.\nAs if the swords following Kang Jin-seong were pouring down they were pouring towards the leader. The swords pouring down like waves passed through the whole body faster than the speed at which the monsters fell.\n“Isn’t it stronger than I thought——!?”\nIt was then. A medium-sized monster that digs into the side of Kang Jin-seong. From the side which was hard to see in the dark the fist it swung struck Kang Jin-seong.\nOld man!\nGoo Dae-sung and Kim Do-han hesitated for a moment but a harsh rebuke was heard from the forefront.\nRun! Look straight ahead when fighting!\nThe two of them gritted their teeth at Cheon Jin-soo's anger and ran forward ignoring the monster. I was at least relieved to hear the sound of swordsmen dancing behind me.\nCome quickly! The tentacles are getting more and more difficult!\nOh I see!\nI'm going now old man!\nThe two clung to Cheon Jin-soo's back. Cheon Jin-soo slashed at the tentacles with a sword that had become huge due to the effect of Ikki-dang-cheon but it seemed that he was getting weaker and weaker.\nDamn I'm getting tired. A big one goes!\nCheon Jin-soo raised his lightsaber. And a giant lightsaber that strikes vertically. It severed its tentacles into bundles raising a huge dust cloud.\nKeep...\nAt the same time the star iron sword returned to its original size. However even with such a blow Mergiola was quickly starting to regenerate.\nBoth of you hold your posture!\nyes?\nUh old man!?\nChun Jin-soo grabbed the two by the necks. And it started spinning around and around——\nUh old man! Isn't that what I'm thinking right now?!\n“Elder Cheon Jin-soo!\nCome back alive and strong young people!\nHuman throwing is disclosed which uses centrifugal force to remind people of shot put throwing. The two were thrown like shot puts at the gap that Cheon Jin-soo had cut.\nUh aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\nThat crazy old man!\nThe two flying in the sky drew a parabola and fell into the tentacle gap.\n* * * *\nUgh!\nKuhak...!\nIt can't be said to be stable but the two have successfully reached the center.\nThey whispered as they gripped their sore jaws and hips.\n‘Oh how do you think you came?'\n‘Should I light a lighter?'\n‘No no I don't think he noticed but let's not make anything dangerous.'\nThe noise of a fierce battle could be heard outside. It is thanks to Cheon Jin-soo and Kang Jin-seong's two old hunters making a fuss so that the two do not get caught.\n‘Let's install it here and get out.'\n‘I think putting it exactly in the center would be the most effective...!'\n‘what's the matter?'\nKim Do-han who was puzzled by Goo Dae-sung's speechlessness turned his gaze to the end. Come to think of it I thought it was strangely bright from before—\n‘crazy.'\nThe two people who discovered the cause were speechless.\ncenter arrived. Self-luminous there was familiar to them too.\ngate.\nThe huge gate which seemed to be able to pass through buildings made the surroundings bright thanks to its self-illumination. And-\n‘The body hasn't even come in yet?!'\nAt the gate a gigantic unimaginable thing with tentacles from the outside was coming in little by little.\nIn other words the main body of the demon which the hunters had been fighting until now hadn't even entered.\n‘A ridiculous monster.'\nAre all the great devils monsters like this? Leon who caught these monsters like a mouse was...\nRealizing that the world they live in is bigger than they imagined the two of them approached the gate.\n‘Let's install it now!'\n‘Yeah let's hope it works!'\nWhat the two took out was a large mechanical device. It's not a bomb... Because there's no way the Great Devil will die from a mere bomb.\nThese are ‘coordinates'.\nYakt spinner the treasured space armament platform the strongest satellite weapon created by investing the resources of the universe and the pantheon. The launch coordinates of its main gun.\nA super-large star-iron bullet made of blessed star iron. A super-large space weapon that launches and falls at the speed of Mach 134.\nThe moment the two people who set up the coordinate setting machine were about to escape——\n──■■■■\nEyes meet. ‘Several dozen' eyeballs came out of the gate and looked at the two.\n-creeps.\nRun!!\nAaaaaaaaa!!\nThe two started the device and started running. The tentacles move with their cries. It was only a matter of time before they were caught in this huge tentacle cavity.\nGu goo! How many seconds! I set it to how many seconds!\nHour ten minutes? I think you set it to ten minutes?!\n-Initiate the countdown. 10... 9... 8...\nNo!\n“Ah I pressed the wrong button——!”\n-7··· 6··· 5···\nTentacles approach. In order to crush the two without leaving even the slightest gap while scraping the ground.\n-4···3···2···\nmechanical sound. The moment when the two of them had a hunch whether they would die from the tentacles or from the bombardment——\n-1··· Launch.\nThe star iron bullets that were fired instantly hit the atmosphere. Guided by precise coordinates-\n- Kujik!\nAfter penetrating the mountain peak and falling vertically through the cavity-\n- Kwajik!\nIt pierced through the bundle of tentacles and fell toward the gate. There was no expected explosion of a crash but a subtle explosion seemed to be heard from beyond the gate.\n-Koowoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nThe two of them leaned on their stomachs to avoid the approaching tentacles and heard the monster's huge scream. I realized that it was the scream of Mergiola who had been hit directly by a star iron bullet when I barely avoided the glowing tentacles.\n- Ugh! They run away!\n-The tentacles run away!!\nAt the same time as the cheers heard from outside the seemingly endless bundle of tentacles struggled and entered the gate.\nWhen the entrance through which the great demon's body was squeezed disappeared the gate also disappeared.\n······ This won?\nWhoa whoa... whoa...\nThe two people were dumbfounded by the result that was so unrealistic.\n* * * *\nThe star-iron shells that fell from the sky literally pierced the mountain and pierced Mergiola.\nA shock wave that would have detonated a nuclear bomb was supposed to explode with only the shock wave of the fall but fortunately such a shock wave did not occur.\nWow... Really. I was lucky.\nI agree...\nThe shell passed through the Mergiola and went straight into the gate. Thanks to this the final point of impact was not here but the Pandemonium beyond the gate.\nI don't know but by now the demon world must have been in a huge uproar.\nHey you guys!\nThen Cheon Jin-soo approached. Because he was covered with his blood his demonic energy overflowed like a slaughter in his chest. But apart from that a smile was on his face.\n“Have you seen these talented people?\nThat... a military secret...\nWhat!? There's nothing to hide between me and Leon-hyung!\n“No but why do you call our majesty your brother?”\nCheon Jin-soo shrugged at Kim Do-han’s words.\nI decided to be your brother!\nIt was true. Leon admiring his attitude which is too bold and heroic to be a modern earthling accepted the title.\nHis own skill was so great that Leon even predicted him as a candidate for the Holy Grail Knight. It's a flaw that I still lack faith.\nAnyway I got lucky this time. I was able to kick him out thanks to a lot of luck.\nKang Jin-seong also helped with a word when he approached. There was no one who disagreed with what he said.\nYes indeed... it was a formidable foe.\nthat's just the devil Then how much monsters are the demon princes and demon lords?\nBut we will win.\nHoo?\nThe eyes of the two old men are focused on his confident attitude. However Goo Dae-seong said in a steady voice.\nBecause we have His Majesty and the gods.\nKoo Dae-sung just hoped that his footsteps would be of some help to that great victory.\n* * * *\nThanks to the star-studded bombardment of the satellite weapon the hunters who chased Mergiyola led their weary bodies toward the entrance.\nWhoa... where are the two elders going?\nWe're going back to the Resistance to let them know it worked.\nCome to think of it they said they were resistance fighters. Who are they?\nThe root cause of this war.\nyes?\nGoo Dae-seong is stunned by Cheon Jin-soo’s words. Kang Jin-seong added an explanation.\nThey're the ones who fired missiles at the Pantheon's charter plane to start a war. They say even the demons had to hurry because of them.\nAt those words Goo Dae-seong slowly turned his head around.\nAttacks by monsters and demon followers all over South Korea.\nIt all started with the large-scale defection of North Korean pilots and the downing of the Mansinjeon charter.\nStrangely the timing was off and an ineffective attack continued. It's like ‘I can't help it'.\nAs long as the North Korean army makes a preemptive strike South Korea has no choice but to declare war...\nIt must have been revealed that there is a demon lurking in North Korea.\nSo the resistance fighters did a trick to reveal the true nature of the demons!\nAs a result the demons could not start a war at the timing they wanted.\nDid something like that happen?\nGoo Dae-seong admired and thanked the resistance forces for their determination.\nEven though Leon and the knights of the pantheon were shot thanks to that the true nature of the demons was quickly revealed.\nFirst of all... I'll have to tell His Majesty about this.\nWhat about them?\nWell... it's definitely a mortal sin of attacking Okche but...\nLeon was a fair man. Wouldn't he be too mean?\nAmid such anticipation Goo Dae-seong continued to walk the path toward the entrance.\nBy the way what are you guys going to do now?\nKang Jin-seong asked.\nI'm thinking of going to Pyongyang. Now I want to join the main unit.\nKoo Dae-sung was proud of this amazing victory but he began to be afraid.\nA monster like that is only one archevil. If so how many great demons have been summoned in this land?\nConcerned about him Cheon Jin-soo patted him on the shoulder.\nWell there's nothing to worry about too much. It seems that they didn't summon all of them because it was an unexpected war.\nSo that's why the archevil hasn't even been summoned yet.\nThis war was not a war that even demons wanted to start. At least at this point in time.\nIn that respect the two old men agreed that it was necessary to praise the performance of the ‘Resistance Army'.\nBy the way it's a great weapon. If you have it isn't it a devil or something?\nThere are a few restrictions but this has proven that it works well enough for the Prime Devil.\nWhen Yapi's high-tech weapons were combined with divine power truly terrifying weapons were completed. And since most of the weapons are in space it was difficult for demons to reach them.\n“I have to inform Lord Yapi of this proof data——”\nAs we were talking we arrived at the entrance. While frowning at the beating sunlight I suddenly saw shooting stars falling from the blue sky.\nOh~ I can see a shooting star even in broad daylight. Shall I make a wish?\npretty. The stars fall all at once. The precious stars seemed to be a meteor shower and the stars fell incessantly.\nA feast of stars that embroiders the sky. It was so beautiful and so great that it took my eyes off.\nShall we make a video of this?\nIt was in the middle of thinking about whether someone would take a commemorative video.\nSomething is strange...\nKang Jin-seong's recitation. Check the sky once again.\nThe stars still continue to fall. Now that number is growing even more. Yes more... unnaturally a lot.\n“What why are there so many?”\nThe number of falling stars is too many. Hundreds... no thousands. tens of thousands?\nAs if all the stars in the universe are pouring down.\nIt's not a shooting star.\nwhat someone said The proof did not take long.\n-Quaaaaaaa!!\nThey pour and burn. What burns up while passing through the atmosphere is not a star—\nsatellite?\nIt was the sight of all the satellites in the world crashing.",

      "content": "< Attack on Pyongyang >\nPyongyang siege front.\nOver the past week the ROK army and pantheon have razed everything around Pyongyang solidifying the siege.\nHave no mercy!\nI wiped out countless monsters and North Korean soldiers.\nThose who surrender will be treated appropriately! But those who resist will soon be the enemy so don't take up arms you lowly ones!\noccupied cities towns etc.\nBy repeating a series of processes the South Korean army was sure to isolate Pyongyang.\nThe few naval and air forces were eradicated to block the water and air routes and finally a large amount of troops surrounding Pyongyang cut off all supplies.\nIt doesn't move.\n“Yes the food must have been exhausted long ago.”\nit's such a city Not only Pyongyang citizens but hundreds of thousands of troops and monsters in the vicinity that place is no different from a black hole that consumes food endlessly.\nAre you growing food inside?\nModern cities cannot be self-sufficient in food because they have built buildings on the land to be cultivated.\nThen can you survive with stockpile resources?\nThat's also impossible. No matter how much resources you stock up on it's well worth millions. If it's not supplied endlessly from outside things like food stored in warehouses will run out in an instant.\nThere is no external supply no self-production and nothing stockpiled.\nThen it's one thing. They don't depend on food resources.\nIs that... possible as a creature?\nIt's likely that what's in there isn't a creature we know.\nLeon recalled the transformation he had witnessed by charging the serfs. The process by which organisms change and change. It is not subject to any law of birth old age and sickness.\nTruly chaos.\nJust like the lord of chaos and his army that drove Lionheart to the brink of destruction in the past.\nIt can't be helped. We have to advance slowly.\nYes. But if you get there.\nThose who are armed with divinity are fine. Those who receive the protection of Jim and the Grail Knights can resist foreign objects.\nThe commander of the Armed Forces pondered whether to dissuade it.\nThe number of troops mobilized by the Mansinjeon was approximately 10000. Even if the Hunters other than the Mansinjeon armed with star iron weapons were mobilized that was enough.\nIt is a level that exceeds the troops of a full-fledged division but on the contrary it is said that the troops are only about one division.\nAttacking the large city of Pyongyang with that amount of troops is tantamount to committing suicide.\nLeon read the look in his eyes and patted the commander on the shoulder.\nBut there are times when we have to. Like Jim said we don't have much time left.\nTwig of Destruction...\nThe commander turned his gaze to Pyongyang. It was invisible even when I first came but before I knew it it was extending toward the heavens with the Ryugyong Hotel the symbol of Pyongyang as its tomb.\nLeon thought it wouldn't be finished until the war was over but at least at this point he thought it was a ticking time bomb that could hasten time.\nThen go.\nGood luck...!\nLeon boarded the Stallion and stood on the rice fields surrounding Pyongyang. He was wearing an unfinished star armor made by Yapi.\n- All right! All right!\nThen one by one those who gathered in front of him. they are knights\nGrail Knights of War and Flame Vulcanus and the Grail Knights Fifty Burning Swords.\nBeatrice Alighieri Spero the priestess of dreams and death and the sorceress queen.\nIron and Blacksmith's Grail Knight Yakt Spinner.\nHan Ha-ri Cheon So-yeon Han Su-ho Kim Jae-hyeok and more than 150 knights representing the knights who were trained and appointed at the Naju Mansinjeon.\nChief Kim Jin-soo who leads the Krashatria Warriors and the Palcheon Man-at-Arms.\nIn addition to that numerous hunters armed with star iron weapons gathered.\nMembers of the Korean Hunter Association Oh Kang-hyeok the Phoenix Guild Lee Yong-wan Ha Yu-ri the Golden Lion Guild Golden Chul Hwang Hwang Yeon-ha... Mujin Guild Juwon Medical Shingeom Guild and Cheongseong Guild.

And that's not all.\n- Launch unmanned combat integrated platform.\nUnmanned aerial vehicles launched from containers all at once according to Yaffe's command protocol.\nThere are 34000 drones for attacking gates that Manshinden is proud of.\nThey were an army enough perhaps the most powerful army on earth.\n“All forces Jin forces.”\nLeon took the lead. As he and the white divine beast slowly move forward the Holy Grail knights then the knights follow.\nIt was truly spectacular to see tens of thousands of troops moving in unison.\n-gulp!\nIn preparation for the enemy's artillery fire the long-distance corps defense method unfolds and gradually approaches the ‘point'.\nThe mutation point of the creature experimented on by sacrificing serf soldiers.

Eventually when Leon stood in front of him it exposed a blatant black curtain.\nA warning of sorts. However the Lion Heart King only reaped it with a hand gesture as if laughing at it.\nWith this kind of leftovers.\nIt could be said that it was a good idea to tie up the armed forces who did not receive divine protection but Leon had no intention of relying on the armed forces from the beginning.\nAs he entered while driving out the black curtain the troops gradually entered. They were relieved to realize that the black membrane had not mutated them.\ncome.\nA plain in front of Pyongyang. Beyond that countless monsters and North Korean soldiers can be seen.

At the forefront are the pilots and baron-class drones boarding the count-class aircraft. And tens of thousands of drones are together.\nA large-scale combat drone that will maintain firepower superiority along with the Kirkiruk artillery in the pantheon which is focused on hand-to-hand combat.\nA corps of unmanned robots worthy of being called a drone swarm occupied the sky and aimed their guns at monsters and North Korean soldiers.\n-Integrated Space Armed Platform Full Weapon Set.\nIn addition a stealth combat satellite that was bombarded with star iron bullets somewhere in the north of Pyongyang a while ago and finished the adjustment work.\n-All Weapon Free.\nThe moment tens of thousands of bullets were about to be fired over the enemy's head——\n[I have to bring such a boring toy to use it.]\nIt resonated throughout the space surrounding Pyongyang.

It was that deep and it sounded as if it had been pulled out of the abyss.\nLeon knew the owner of that voice.\nRakshar?!\nThe next moment a ‘roar' rang out.\n█?????███▄▄▄▄▄────!!\nA roar echoes.\nA roaring flash that pierced the sky and stretched out into space.

The sight of the roar of Malus the lord of chaos summoned for the first time in the empire splitting the sky.\nIf so what's next-!!\nvulcan!!\nAll of the Holy Grail Knights! Ignite!!\nAt the same time as Vulcan's command all the Knights of the Burning Sword spewed out flames. The holy fire developed by 50 members of the Holy Grail Knights and Vulcanus the strongest Grail Knight of all time formed a huge curtain that blocked the way of all 12000 Hunters.\n“What what? Why are you covering your face all of a sudden—”\nThe doubts did not last long. This is because something collided with the curtain of fire soon after and severed the curtain.\nporosity.\nThe destructive force created by the aftermath of the roar pierced the curtain of fire and cut through the air.\nAt most it was only the aftermath of sound but it was as sharp as if all the blades in the world were compressed.\nTurn off my ears...\nDamn it what a noise...\nCould it be that just roaring had this kind of effect? Lee Yong-wan thought that the opponent was formidable.\nAre you okay Miss Yuri?\nUh... it was just a sound. But what kind of guy said that sound?\nIt was then. Hayuri swung her dagger at the feeling of a foreign body on the top of her head and cut it off.\n- Took!\nThe cause of the severed foreign body sensation fell to the floor.\nThis this?\ndrone. It was a drone that had filled the sky just before.\nWhy is this?\nLee Yong-wan looked at the sky. And he couldn't close his gaping mouth.\n- Unmanned aerial vehicle corps function stop. 65% loss in the count class malfunction in the baron class. out of control. out of control.\nUnmanned aerial vehicles that filled the sky were crashing all at once.\nBar raise your shield!\nThe reliable drone squadron that had covered the allies until just a moment ago turned into a pile of scrap metal and pounded the corps.\nThere is no weak bone here to be hurt by the fall of a little hard scrap metal but the fact that more drones than that have all crashed has caused psychological agitation.\nBesides-\nHa look at the sky!\nThe sky... no to be precise countless shooting stars pouring down from space.\nIt didn't take long for mankind to realize that these were the satellites that mankind had launched into space.\n[Now let's start the war the old way.]\nChaos Lord Rakshaar smiled.\n* * * *\nOne roar.\nIn that one stroke humanity lost everything in the universe.\ndifferent. The scale is so different.\nSo far mankind has faced demons many times and defeated them.\nSometimes they failed but they succeeded in defeating the demon itself.\nThe great evil Scajacarrier who caused the Shanghai catastrophe was also successful in killing each time and there were great evils that appeared from time to time but mankind fully prepared has repulsed them.\nIt was even easier after the appearance of the pantheon.\nDemon Gate was no longer a melting pot to welcome immortal demons and the demons secretly moving into the human world were eliminated one after another by the pantheon.\nThose who watched the battle video in Taiwan cheered as they realized that they were no match for the strongest creatures on earth... the Holy Grail Knights even though the demons might have formed a mighty force.\nbut.\nthis one is different\nThe scale is so different.\nThe only ones who ‘understood' this moment were Vulcanus and the Burning Sword Knights who fought against numerous monarch-level demons... and a few people who witnessed the final war at the gate that recorded the destruction of Lionheart.\n【 Aura of Chaos 】\n◆Effect\n: Weakness chaos terrifyingness confusion tetanus screaming fear confusion despair body decay mental pollution soul erosion────\n[Legendary Great Devil]\n◆Effect\n: Unrecognizable.\n【 Demon Lord Rakshaar 】\n◆Effect\n: Unrecognizable.\n【 A desperate existence 】\n◆Effect\n: All living beings are overcome with fear confusion and despair.\n: Morale is reduced by 99.9%.\n: Physical resistance is reduced by 100%.\n: Defense is reduced by 100%.\nAh the demon lord!\nNo that's ridiculous.

As a guild leader in charge of one of the top 10 Korean guilds he has shown off his most powerful presence at the forefront of gate capture.\nEven he himself is just one of those archers who don't have a presence here. This battlefield if there is a protagonist—\n“GRARARA——!!”\nWaves of flame swept past at the roar of the gigantic knight.\nIt only took 1 second for the monsters' raw flesh and bone fragments to burn away. Grail Knight Vulcanus who holds two giant swords mercilessly cuts down and overwhelms his opponents whether they are small or large.\nThere is no difference in whether that monster has power or not whether it is D-class or A-class. The unit that recognizes the strong of that is something that surpasses even S-class.\nGet down!\nA word someone hurriedly shouted. At the same time outward laws are pouring down from the sky.\n────!!\nA black baptism falling from the sky resounding. What poured from the magic circle that covered the battlefield sky was the magician queen's maximum bombardment magic.\nOh black smoke spreads! Is this okay?!\nThis don't touch it! It looks dangerous!\nfiring point.

No matter how many more enemies there may be at the end it is the allied forces that overwhelm the battlefield.\nHuh it's hot.\nHeh heh isn't it your lack of faith? President Takeda.\nFuck! Oh Kang-hyeok president of the association just blew the monster's head off with his fist. Takeda shrugged at him.\n“I am quite a devout believer Mr. President.”\nTakeda brushed off the blade drenched in the monster's blood and looked at Leon.\n“Your Majesty doesn’t seem to be stepping out.\nYou must be warming up. The other Holy Grail Knights are strong enough.\nLion Heart King is the last hidden card. Lionheart originally made it its national bird.\nThe fact that the Lion Heart King was directly involved was a disgrace to the knights of the kingdom. So far the situation has not been good and Leon has always been at the forefront.\n‘Even so you're still breathing in a war like this. You seem to be more wary of something than face.'\nLeon's usual authoritative atmosphere was nowhere to be seen and a rough energy flowed out like the breath of a ferocious beast.\nThanks to the knight's overwhelming breakthrough power it penetrates the plain and enters the city.\ncome.\nIt was the moment they entered downtown Pyongyang. Landmarks of Pyongyang erected ostentatiously from the entrance.\nAs soon as they entered the city the building which was a stronghold to be occupied suddenly turned into a black liquid like ink and fell with the momentum of pouring and soon began to gather.\nUgh! Look at that!\nAt 2 o'clock! At 11 o'clock! Something...!\nThere were not just a couple of such buildings. Those who had been holding their breath until the hunters came in began to mutate all at once when they stepped into the trap.\nThe black ink instantly turned into a huge monster. The huge size tried to attack the hunters all at once.\nUgh whoa!\nEveryone avoid!\nIt was too late to avoid it. It was because the opponent's size was so huge. Even the Man-at-Arms knew this but tried to get out of the giant's landing point as much as possible but there was a cry from Leon.\nKeep your seat! Don't break the formation!\nHowever the words could not come out of my throat. The only principle they carved into their bodies while training to die in the pantheon.\nabsolute obedience.\nFollow the knight's command without questioning anything. If that were the case the all-powerful warrior knights would make a breakthrough.\nYou are the owner of the peaceful warmth that illuminates the world.\nGod responded to Leon's prayer. The god who responded was Tatar the god of the sun and judgment. An impartial and ruthless judge willingly answered his judge's prayers.\nDivine Punishment < Sun Appearance. >\nThe holy power gathered in an instant in the sky above the crowd is embodied as the sun.\n-······!\nIt burned the monsters that tried to attack the army with its size and the demons that were lurking. A scene where the intense sunlight drives away the evil darkness.\nWaaaaaa!\nLionheart! Lionheart!\nFuck this! With that stuff behind us we can beat anything!\nAwesome! Monsters melt in real time!\nHunters cheering. They calmly cheered for the Lion Heart King who performed the miracle. But even in the midst of that there was someone who couldn't let go of the tension. It was Hanhari.\n‘Even then there were two of them.'\nIn the final battle of the Pantheon Leon the Holy Grail Guardian and Sir Loxley the Holy Grail Knight launched two suns.\nEven in the face of such astounding natural disasters the demon lord of wisdom Karacael sneered and dropped comets.\nThe opponent is the same demon lord. It is an opponent that can never be overlooked.\nSir Han Hari. Where is Sir Han Hari!\nAt that time Lord Raihar of the Burning Sword Knight found Hari. Hari hurriedly got on her horse and headed towards it.\n“What are you doing?”\nYour Majesty is looking for you. Take my hand!\nYes? Whoa!\nBefore Hari had time to say anything Raihar grabbed her hand and went somewhere! and she blew it away.\nAfter throwing a human body away like a javelin she ended up in the middle of the military gate——\nFuhak!\nrun into something Realizing that it is a block of cold hard alloy Hari raises her head.\nHuh Marquis level?\nYacht Spinner's third decisive battle weapon. Hari seated on top of a super robot that is still beaming at waves of monsters realizes that she is not the only one.\n“Lee Yong-wan the guild leader?”\nAh hello. Ms. Hari.\nLee Yong-wan greeted awkwardly. Beside him Leon was looking down from the top of Stallion.\n“Tsk tsk are you still a vulgar jingle who was named a knight?”\nOh no I'm an archer first.\nLee Yong-wan who was an S-class archer protested against Leon who was staring at his bow disapprovingly.\n“No more than that Sir Yapi we are riding now. Isn’t it the king of long-range weapons itself?\n-Kick! The armament of this machine is no different from the ‘body' of this machine. It is a detachable mounted ‘flesh'. Do not compare yourself with your lowly organism.\nAren't you a robot? Are you a human? Are you riding a person inside?!\nLee Yong-wan knocked on the iron plate of the Marquis class but Yapi continued to fire.\nBy the way... why did you call Miss Hari and me?\n“You two have work to do here.”\n“???”\nLeon looked down at Lee Yong-wan first.\nI heard you have good eyesight. If you snipe them here and see a threat report it to Sir Spinner immediately. Originally Sir Spinner was in charge of reconnaissance but in this area of ??chaos rather good performance seems to be a problem.\nThe machine's eyes are so accurate that it's easy to fool them. I couldn't blindly trust Yapi's camera eye let alone cheating on the situation in North Korea.\nBut you bastard. Are you a bachelor?\nYes? Yes?! That's why...\nIf you are a bachelor swear to dedicate yourself to the goddess of the moon and chastity. She is also the goddess of hunters so she will bestow her protection.\n······If you swear by that.\nThere's nothing special about living as a bachelor for the rest of your life.\nI did. I did! How old am I!\nLeon sighed at those words.\nLook at that Goddess Dina. These days young people are debauched and don't have many virgins and virgins. Even more so it's hard to find them if you ask them to remain chaste for the rest of their lives.\n[Shut up virgin abductor. It's better than a guy who kidnaps a virgin virgin like you and performs a riot.]\nLeon scratched his pitch and reached out to Lee Yong-wan.\nThis is a special case. In this moment the Moon Goddess will bless you.\nThe blessing of the goddess delivered through Leon made Lee Yong-wan feel an unknown sense of omnipotence.\nA feeling of omnipotence as if power overflowed from the heart to each of the bundles of blood vessels! And that's not all.\nLee Yong-wan had a hunch that his eyesight had been amplified several times compared to before.\nOh ohhh...\nThe bow he pulled as a test flew away with a terrifying sound and hit a medium-sized monster that was approaching far away.\n-Quaaaa!\nAnd even an explosion at the point of impact? It also melted five small monsters around the medium monster!\nThis this...\nThe moon is the brother and sister of the sun. Goddess Dina is like the sister of a Tatar god. So when the sun is up you can use half of its power.\n[The ecology of the gods is not so easy to explain Leon.]\nTo the goddess' words Leon answered as if he couldn't help it.\nNothing is so easy to understand for foolish children.\nLeon finished explaining to Lee Yong-wan.\nThe real power is when night falls and the moon rises but it should be a power that can be used even now.\n·······.\nThis much power is ‘half' level protection? Lee Yong-wan drew the bowstring with his tingly face.\nHa-ri Han.\nOh yes!\nUse the heat of the sun. This will make your fire stronger.\nLeon stared at the heritage of the founding father of Lionheart planted inside Hari's chest.\nIf you inherited the heart of fire there is no way you can't do it.\nOh I see!\nHari responded by pounding her chest at the heavy responsibility placed on her.\nWhoa... whoa...\nPetos the god of war whispered to the nervous Hari.\n[Take care of the fire calmly. Thanks to the heat of the sun the heart of Renoir inside you will be activated.]\nPoma also helped.\n[Let the fire flow like waves. You are the priestess who inherited the flame of Petos but you were also the power of the god of waves. Do not underestimate this miracle that only you have.]\nLeon watched as Hari made his flame burn even hotter with the heat of the sun taking the advice of the two gods.\nThis child is rarely loved by God. You can leave the work behind.\nyour majesty.\nBeatrice rides on Yapi's mechanical arm and approaches Leon. When she arrived Leon crossed her arm.\nGet on.\nIn response Beatrice willingly grabs Leon's hand and climbs on top of Stallion. Stallion carrying the two let out a roar like a beast and spread its wings.\nIt's starting to show. The real enemy.\nBeyond the battlefield where the Knights and Man-at-Arms are engaged in a melee. Despite the intense heat and light of the sun there is an abyss full of darkness.\nTerrifyingly huge shadows were wriggling in the place where the red tree branches grew using the Ryugyong Hotel as a graveyard.\n‘Did you say there were 3 million citizens in Pyongyang?'\nIf that's the case we should assume that there are at least 3 million degenerated monsters here. Considering that they absorbed monsters and even North Korean troops around them there must be much more.\nIn other words they are in a position to be forced into an endless war of attrition. The Holy Grail Knights who have indefatigable ‘perfect vitality' may not know it but the others are not.\nSir Vulcanus Sir Spinner. Bice Karina.\nFour saints and maidens head for Leon. Each is an agent of the great gods.\nHit the devil's head. All the Holy Grail Knights break through the enemy's center.\n“I'll take your name!!”\nHit the enemy boss. Stallion roared and flew into the air.\n[Is it coming? You are the enemy of evil.]\nRakshaar's voice echoes through the city. It wasn't just humans who responded to his voice.\n────■■■■■■■■!!\n────■■■■■■■■!!\n────■■■■■■■■!!\n────■■■■■■■■!!\nFive Great Old Ones. The monsters of chaos and destruction awaited the arrival of their nemesis screaming loudly.\nApart from that North Pyongyang.\nThose who arrived at the place by horse and several vehicles witnessed a huge whirlwind of war going on there.\n“There... something is strange. What city is...”\nCaptain Kim Do-han was stunned by the natural disasters taking place in Pyongyang.\nThe huge sun over the city and the fireworks that devour it. The building became a giant monster and destroyed the city and the cries of the giant monsters are spreading all over the place.\nOrdinary human beings will be torn to pieces the moment they get caught up in it. Heading there right now is like going to the middle of a nuclear battlefield where atomic bombs are exploding.\nJi are you really going? Mr. Gu?\n“I have to go.”\nGoo Dae-seong took the reins. As long as you participate in this war there is no retreat.\nEveryone is fighting there so as a member of this world his duty is to help his allies there now.\nWhoa...! Let's go! The two elders and the ‘Rebels' let's fight together!\n“Of course not dude.”\nI can't help it.\nCheon Jin-soo and Kang Jin-seong moved forward clicking their tongues. And the leader of the resistance... Ri Cheol-woong also spoke to the special operation unit hunters they brought.\nWith the great gun-bomb spirit! Charge for the people and country!\nA new force enters the battle in Pyongyang. No one knew right away how they would perform on this battlefield front.",

Go away!!\nThe breakthrough power of Vulcanus and the Knights of the Burning Sword is overwhelming.\nHowever the number of enemies was really large enough to be called ‘overwhelming'.\nIt wasn't enough to mutate all the citizens of Pyongyang into monsters because they accumulated countless monsters using the large-scale gate incident.\nNo matter how much the Holy Grail Knights boast of their strength it is not possible to break through this endless tidal wave indefinitely.\nThat's a lot! It reminds me of the old bad guys!\nCompared to that time it's not a big deal Sir Raihar!\nYes in the Great War that caused the decline of Lionheart in the past the knights saw a truly hopeless tidal wave of evil.\nHowever there were many Holy Grail Knights back then. There were 12 complete Holy Grail Knights more than double the number of Holy Grail Knights.\nAnd what about the knights of the kingdom? Even if they weren't chosen as the Holy Grail Knights there were many guardians who guarded each place the Knights of Glory.\nThere were elite soldiers who had accumulated experience and military feats that even knights acknowledged soldiers who were willing to give their lives for the kingdom and there were many serfs who could be used as meat walls.\nBut what about the current pantheon?\nWith the exception of Grail Guardian Leon Grail Knight Vulcanus and Grand Duke Carina of Dragonia all the mighty men of old glory ascended to heaven and perished.\nMagician Queen Beatrice and strong AI Yacht Spinner are strong enough to be acknowledged even by them but the rest... well?\n‘I didn't have enough time.'\nThere were definitely geniuses with a promising future. Han Hari is an example of that.\nA priestess who was chosen by the two gods to inherit the ‘Heart of Fire' from Duke Renoir the main character of Lionheart's founding myth.\nWhat about Chun So-yeon Kim Jae-hyuk and Han Su-ho? According to what I heard they were the knights who inherited the holy relic directly from the priest of the month.\nThere were people who could be called talented people on Earth and maybe a Holy Grail Knight might be born among them.\nHowever Holy Grail Knights are not beings born so easily.\nIn other words at least at this time we can't hope for a new Holy Grail Knight to be born. In other words it takes too much time to increase from the current power.\n‘It's meaningless to wish for something that doesn't exist.'\nThe Knights of the Burning Sword humbly accepted it. Have you given up hope? That's never.\n‘The Lion Heart King is here. As long as he exists the kingdom's glory will not fade.'\nAfter being frozen for 200 years and barely stepping on the foreign land of Earth the Burning Sword Knights heard many stories about Leon from the god Petos.\nHow long has he been fighting the demons alone?\nHow many demon lords and great demons have been defeated and finally won.\nThe knights blamed themselves whenever they heard the story of that glory.\nThey considered themselves guilty of treason for letting the king fight alone.\nBut not this time! We fight alongside the King! We will open the way for the King!\nNo wonder!\nThe Knights of the Burning Sword led by Raihar responded. The breakthrough power of their wedge charge is the strongest of the Holy Grail Knights. They fight their way through the tidal wave of evil.\nDrilled!\nIt was temporary but it pierced the waves of monsters. Only 50 knights pierced tens of thousands of waves. Even if it's a hole that will soon be filled.\nSpread!\nAt the command of Lord Raihar the Knights of the Burning Sword began to spread widely to the left and right.\nIt's a tactical quirk. As a cavalry unit they have the greatest breakthrough power only when united. Even so they chose the path of scattering left and right.\nAs if trying to block the waves alone.\nGood work!\nVulcan enters the place they broke through. The huge footsteps of the Marquis class a decisive battle weapon passed and following Carina Leon and Beatrice also passed.\nLeon said as he passed them in the sky.\nI'll leave it to you.\n“insect!!”\nIn the place where the Holy Grail Knights passed the Burning Sword Knights descend from their comrades-in-arms the war horses and raise their blazing swords.\n-Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\nAnd the waves of monsters rushing in again. The noise of the monsters trying to make up for it is loud as if it was disgraceful to have been broken through by them once.\nBaltan Flaming Sword Knights.\nLord Raihar shouted. Flames raged on the sword held vertically and the next moment...\nFire.\nThe flames from their swords instantly formed a huge veil. It's like making a prison made of fire.\nOf course the prisoners in that prison are demons.\n* * * *\nIn the darkness of pouring black mist. Leon Beatrice Vulcanus Karina and Yapi moved forward wary of their surroundings.\n[It's been a while Lionheart. You are stronger than before.

But I can't hear the sound of the impact.\n-Kick?\nThe next moment something huge rushed towards Yaffi. huge tentacles. A Marquis-class plasma barrier has been deployed but a giant tentacle penetrates it.\nthud!\nA marquis-class body was hit by tentacles and stumbled.\n- Anchor launch. Posture control deflection thrust nozzle full operation.\nPapapak! Anchors pouring in. Anchors driven into the ground and buildings and boosters that increase output in the opposite direction of collapse correct the fuselage about to collapse.\nYafi's machine foot which barely got into position slashed the tentacle foot with the plasma cutter.\n[Keukkeuk it's a fun toy.]\nYapi sensed that the direction of the sound was completely different from before. She thrusts her muzzle towards it but Rakshaar is nowhere to be seen.\n“Sir Spinner do not rely solely on observational information.”\n-Kikluk·······.\nYappi looked around while preparing to mobilize all his armed forces at any time.\nBut even after coming this far I can't clearly grasp his presence.\nKarina thought that this fog polluted her senses. Otherwise there is no way that a great demon like Rakshaar will not be caught.\nGARARARA──! Then I'll have to pull it out myself!!\nVulcan immediately put the divine power into his body.\nDivine Advent < God of War >.\nThe greatest Holy Grail Knight in history performs the miracle of putting Petos the god of war and flame into his body as easily as flipping the palm of his hand.\n-Quaaaa!\npouring flames. Sparks leaked through the entire body of the armor causing a wave of flames that swept the surrounding area.\n“Lord Vulcan! The premature descent of the Divine Spirit——!”\nKarina stopped Vulcanus but it was already too late. The enormous holy power poured out by Vulcanus as he descended upon the divinity was absorbed straight into the World Tree.\nThe seedling of the world tree remodeled by the demon lord of chaos Rakshaar absorbs the surrounding holy power. Of course the enormous holy power that was manifested right in front of their noses was just a nutritious meal.\nof course.\nHow to lose weight if you eat too much nutritious food.\nGRRARARA!! This my holy power! Can a young seedling be able to contain it!\nThe World Tree which had been absorbing Vulcan's enormous flame could not absorb Vulcan's holy power at some point. On the contrary it spews out the holy power it ate as if it were spitting it out.\nVulcan radiated it again spreading flames everywhere.\n-Quaaaaaaa!\nThe pouring flame drives away the dark fog and burns it. Watching that scene Karina had a tired expression.\nIs the world water indigestion? It's still an ignorant vessel Lord Vulcanus.\nThanks to this the annoying fog will disappear and their faces will be revealed.\nAlthough the demon lord is mighty he won't go out alone with such an army.\nAt least five archevil. However there are only four Holy Grail Knights here. Among them Vulcanus is the greatest Holy Grail Knight of all time.\nIf Leon is in charge of Rakshaar the Great Devils can be organized into Holy Grail Knights.\nIn the fog that disappeared like that. Beatrice's expression contorted as she witnessed one of the Great Demons gradually revealing its gigantic appearance.\n······Quay?\nThe entrance to the World Tree with the Ryugyong Hotel as its tomb. The familiar demon archduke hanging there.\nI was here...\nThe magician queen found the crippled enemy she missed in Taiwan but she couldn't help but be distorted by embarrassment.\nFallen Grand Duke Quay. It was stuffed in a corpse state.\nyour majesty······.\nI'm looking at you too.\nIt's not just Quay. The great demons who reveal their gigantic presence around the world tree. Each one of them was stuffed with ancient great demons called the Great Old Ones.\n“What are you doing——”\nSo are the roaring demons hallucinations?\n[I was waiting. The nemesis of all demons.]\nThe appearance of Rakshaar is revealed.\nHis appearance has not changed from before.\nHuge claws and hundreds of giant tentacles. Huge figures reaching hundreds of meters are violent just by their size.\nHowever what is completely different from before is its presence.\nOriginally the Demon Grand Duke of Chaos he was released from a long seal and succeeded to the vacant seat of the monarch.\nIt is said that he has enough skills to take the place of the monarch that even Quei and other demon princes could not inherit.\n[Leon Dragonia. Son of Ulfric Dragonia. A mansin agent with a lion heart. The hero who defeated Malus the lord of chaos Karakael the lord of wisdom and Dotradon the lord of pleasure.]\nRakshaar's voice spreads in between. His gigantic body moved between buildings in Pyongyang looking down at the Holy Grail Knights.\n[I heard your story for a long time. How terrifying you are how miraculous you are.]\nEven so it was an instinctive feeling that the Holy Grail Knights did not immediately attack him. Chaos Lord Rakshaar. He had a hunch that it was dangerous to attack him recklessly if he did not have the confidence to defeat him in one fell swoop.\n[Many demons feared you and did not go to this battlefield. I chose to hide from you for eternity looking forward to your lifespan coming to an end.]\n“Is that why you summoned the Great Devil and killed them all?”\n[okay. Even the most ancient demons did. In particular all those who fought against you 200 years ago.]\nCome to think of it there were some familiar faces among the giant hanging demons. The great devil who fled through the remaining gates before eliminating all Demon Gates in the 256th year.\nThe guy who had lost half of his body and fled by throwing his men as bait was now stuffed and nailed to a building.\n“But you did a good job of coming here. If you judged Jim to be weak it would be a big mistake.”\n[Hehe demons aren't afraid of the size of your power. For great lords a power like yours couldn't escape the limits of a mortal after all.]\nRakshaar asked with sincere awe.\n[Lionheart. Leon Dragonia Lionheart. Are you really human?]\nIt's a demigod.\n[Don't underestimate yourself. Even if yours is compared to the gods it does not lose the status of a myth.]\nRakshaar saw beyond that through Leon. The gods of the heavens who are still keeping an eye on them. Those who live dependent on the heart of a human being in the middle of the day must have noticed it long ago.\n[Abominable celestial immortals. Are you really using someone better than you as your servant? You don't deserve it.]\n[[······.]]\nThe gods were silent. They have a huge sense of debt to the knight they love and they know that the dedication he has made stems solely from his nobility.\nAfter such a long dedication the gods can't repay anything to him who has shown miracles many times.\nThat's why I have nothing to say. Because it is the current pantheon that still forces devotion to him who has fought alone for hundreds of years.\n[Lionheart. No Leon Dragonia. hold our hand Get out of the mansin that can't do anything for you and be stained with malice. Then you will be our god.]\nBe reborn as an evil god.\nKukuk...!\nLeon let out an unexpected laugh. It didn't take long to realize that it was a laugh.\nThis goddamn bastard speaks nonsense for a long time! I couldn't stand it because my ears tickled the whole time I was listening to it!\nLeon lifted the holy sword. The brilliance of the Holy Sword from which the light of justice flows symbolizes his unshakable justice.\nYou pitiful things you evil beasts. Did you know that this is the first time you've seduced me? You've been doing nonsense that you haven't succeeded in so many years without getting tired of it!\n[·······.]\nLight pouring towards Leon's holy sword. Leon's body shines brightly.\nAriana loves me. Petos is proud of me and Foma has promised me safe voyages always.\nDemera granted me the ground to lay me on Heto forged my sword and armor Fleur watched over me in my dreams and Dinah forgave me the mortal sin of committing my virginity.\nLeon doesn't waver. He would stop grieve and fall but he never wavered. As if the worries of the gods who were worried about the possibility of corruption were meaningless.\nSince the beginning of time who among mankind has been loved by the gods like me! How can I be ashamed and regretful to repay this love!\nBorn as an orphan and dying at a young age he was born in a fantasy he longed for.\nI met my undeserved parents had a good opportunity and walked a rugged but honorable path. At the end it must have been a long and long childhood facing the proof of God and escaping from the foolish path of ignorance.\nI'm Leon! I'm Dragonia! I'm Lionheart! I'm the Lionheart!!\nThe answer was enough. Rakshaar realized that Lee Ja had an unshakable soul just as he had guessed.\nIt's really unfortunate and a wasteful person. He is truly qualified to become the god of evil.\nHowever apart from his qualifications the malice that is invisible to him will not be able to stain him with evil.\n[Excellent Lionheart. That's why today your legend will end here.]\nTry it Beast. You will realize that there is a God's Knight that will never be broken.\n[Let me introduce myself once again.]\nThe Lord of Chaos shouted.\n[I am the chaos that will distort your norms!]\n[Despair to stop your beating heart!]\n[It is a cry that will crush the cry of hope.]\n[I! The Lord of Chaos Raksharda!!]\nA gigantic roar Before that roar was over the Holy Grail Knights charged at the evil lord.\nAnd at that moment-\n[Today you will lose your divinity and die as mere humans.]\n-bang! Kwak!\n“······!!”\nThe stuffed corpses of the great demons exploded pouring black mist.\nVulcanus Bice...!\nUpon hearing Leon's name the two poured flames and purple mist with enormous holy power. It's because I don't know what it is but the ominous thought that I have to stop that thing flashed through my mind.\n[no use. It is a great magic that consumes the souls of six demons. Do you think it can be stopped with mere human power?]\nAs the words said the black fog instantly drove the two people's holy power and filled the surroundings with a thick layer.\nDay and night change in an instant in the darkness where you can't see even an inch in front of you. Leon sensed something flashing.\nSeongbeop < Blessing of the Arrow >\nOnly one ranged attack. The strongest defense method that absolutely blocks it. This is the power of concept. It is an invincible shield that has never been pierced.\n- Kwaaak!\nThe moment the invincible shield was pierced the cursed thorn passed through Leon and he fell off the white divine beast.\n“your majesty···!”\nIn the astonishment of the Holy Grail Knights. Leon felt the goddess's voice dissipate.",

Are S-class hunters not even that good?\nUh dude are you talking? And Lee Yong-wan not Lee Wan-yong!\nBuilding windows across the battlefield. Lee Yong-wan shot the monsters there and scolded Hari.\n“Mr. Lee Yong-wan aren’t you a knight of the Pantheon of God now?”\nIt's been a while since you were appointed?\nFormer senior knight. And the priestess of Foma-nim and Petos-sama.\nWho is Lee Yong-wan?\nUh uh huh! On the subject of an agency at the end of an association!\nIt's enough to submit a letter of resignation! There's a manor there too. There's a lot of money!\nThe pantheon abandoned all the children...\nIs it time for a bickering?\nThen a shadow suddenly appeared between the two. It was Hayuri the deputy guild leader of the Phoenix Guild.\nMom!\nIt was Yuri Ha who prevented Hari from almost falling down the building. She hugged her by the waist and lifted her up again stroking her hair.\nYou have to be careful.\nGo thank you.\n“Is there a big difference in attitude between Hari and Yuri and how they treat me?”\nIn response to Lee Yong-wan's voice Ha Yu-ri refuted with the attitude of asking something obvious.\nA pretty sister is better than a mammonist traitor. The subject doesn't even pay for ten rescues.\nUgh...!\nAren't you paying ten rescues?!\nLee Yong-wan refuted Ha-ri's astonished gaze.\nNo the ten structures are a bit... uh are you giving enough offerings?\nAbove all the ten structure has not yet been enforced on outsiders who are not directly under the Mansinjeon.\nIt's not enough Mii! Mii!\nYeah Miss Yuri? Why did you come up?\nThere were monsters pushing this way. I just dealt with it.\nHayuri wiped the dagger that was covered in blood.\n“Miss Harry is Miss Hari the one controlling the flames on the battlefield right now?”\nYes? Yes. Thanks to the sun.\nHari was projecting overwhelming firepower onto the battlefield thanks to the huge sun Leon had left afloat.\nThe reason she is here with sniper Lee Yong-wan is to see the battlefield wide and find a place to project firepower.\nLet's move to the building over there with me. Large monsters are pouring in from the east district. There are also high-ranking demons.\nOops!\nOur Gilma-nim be careful not to get hit in the back of the head here.\n“Uh come back quickly.”\nYuri Ha laughed and jumped down the building. Hari jumps after her. As they headed toward the building across the street they saw a familiar face.\nsister?!\nSuho!\nHan Soo-ho and Kim Jae-hyeok. The two of them are holding their spears and preparing for another charge while catching their breath with the knights.\n“How is the war situation?”\nDon't say anything. It seems everyone is out of their power.\nSuho looked tired. Jaehyuk also cried.\nThe amount of holy power consumption is no joke. It's popping up here and there so I don't know if I know it but I don't know if the gods are screaming. In particular the gods with the Holy Grail Knights must have been very upset.\nJaehyuk tried to evoke the atmosphere of the hard battlefield but his expression looked too tired to be a joke.\nThat means the density of this battlefield is high.\n“But it seems like everyone isn’t depressed because there are things like that.”\nJaehyuk looked up at the sun who still shows his presence as if he were protecting the hunters.\nThe sun summoned by the authority of Tartar the god of the sun and judgment melted demons and monsters with just its presence and gave its allies an unknown strength and will.\nThe Lion Heart King who creates such things in the blink of an eye and the Holy Grail Knights who represent the power of the gods. If there are them there is no choice but to win everyone firmly believes and keeps their seats.\nI'm going to hit a big one! Cheon So-yeon! Prepare to charge!\nPut a headband on!\nJaehyuk focused the lightning with the power of Ultima the god of sky and thunder. It is not difficult to handle lightning thanks to the spear of the Holy Grail Knight of Thunder which he inherited from the Lionheart Kingdom.\n-Quarreung!\n- Kwaaang!\ncrashing thunderbolt. It blew away the leading monsters at once.\nWow that's great.\nYes?\nLeaving those who admired him behind Jaehyuk questioned his performance with a curious look.\nThis is strange... Was my voice originally this strong...?\nAside from the power the range and the number of falling thunderbolts were different from before. As if a large faucet was turned off and the water rushed towards me.\n“Miss Hari send fire support over there soon.”\nIt was time for Hayuri to hurry up.\nHuh? The sun!\nThe sun is gone!\nThe sun that protected the hunters by shining a strong presence a little while ago gradually dispersed and soon disappeared.\n-what? what's the matter?\n- Is the sun gone?\nAnd that's not all. Blessing traits that disappear one after another from the system window as soon as they change. It was known to everyone in an instant and caused a commotion.\n“Wait what the hell is going on?!”\nEven Harry was embarrassed.\n* * * *\nQuack!\nEveryone shouted at the place where Rakshaar's attack had passed the Lion Heart King crumbling powerlessly.\n“your majesty!!”\nThe staggering Holy Grail Knights. Even the yakt spinner was late in calculating this sudden situation.\nKeep your seat! It's just a penetrating wound!\nLeon calmed everyone down even when his chest was pierced. Thanks to twisting my body in an instant my heart narrowly missed.\n“I can’t believe my defense method can be broken through...”\nlong-distance protection. The method of blocking all ranged weapon attacks is not omnipotent.\nFor example something outside the imagination that the knights do not recognize as a ‘ranged weapon'. For example it cannot block things outside of perception such as magic.\nBecause magic has too many cases beyond what knights can understand.\nThe absoluteness of concept defense is established under the condition of such a gap.\nLeon is the apex of such surname users. That's why I was careless. To be precise it would have to be seen as an unshakable faith.\nfather···!\nKarina hurriedly approached. She supported the reeling Leon and in the meantime Yapi Vulcanus and Beatrice rushed towards Rakshaar.\nYou fucking bastard!\nDivine Punishment < Fire of the Battlefield >\n-Kick!\nSuper-heavy bullets 680mm Star-iron shells divine enhancement.\ndare···!\nGreat Voice < Fog of Death >\nThe three Holy Grail Knights almost simultaneously unleashed the greatest amount of holy magic.\nPetos' flame Heto's divinity-honed most expensive shell Fl's death mist.\nThe Holy Grail Knights' great technique in which even the Great Devil cannot escape extinction if struck directly. That is of course if it triggers.\nhmm···?!\nThe fire does not advance. No rather when he noticed that even the flames overflowing from his body had gone out a huge tentacle swung towards Vulcanus.\n-bang!\nSir Vulcanus!\nBeatrice finds Vulcan but he bounces off the building.\n- Shell set. launch.\nYapi's 680mm star iron shells were fired at Rakshaar. Almost simultaneously black light focused from Rakshaar's mouth shoots out destruction.\nTranscendence < Light of Extinction >\nA bombardment that shakes space. Even the energy of destruction collides with the strongest physical energy in history.\n-Kwagwagwagwagwak!!\nThe windows of the surrounding buildings are shattered all at once and the asphalt cracks.\nThe transcendence that Leon had broken through the other day... This time it was different from before.\n-······!\nThe next moment Yapi's Marquis level is penetrated. The 680mm special star-iron shells are huge shells that are just simply strong as even the protection of iron has disappeared.\nIt wasn't enough to block the transcendence of the demon lord Rakshaar.\n- loss of armament. Loss of 65% of the fuselage. Emergency battle mode-\nThe surviving armed forces were mobilized and taken out but no shots were fired. Rakshaar's tentacles broke even the massive body of a marquis-class decisive battle weapon like a can of millet.\nDivinity...\nKarina and Beatrice understood the current situation.\nA dark fog that emerged from the explosions of the corpses of the great demons. Since it filled this space the connection with divinity was severed.\nThis fog... seems to be blocking the connection with the divine. Grand Duke Carina.\nI know.\nyou have to get out of this place The two put Leon on the Stallion and tried to escape through the sky.\n-Kiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\nHowever thousands and tens of thousands of flying monsters flocked from the sky. The large army mixed with demons thoroughly blocked the escape through Stallion.\n“What about the Knights of the Burning Sword?!”\nKarina's gaze turned to the Holy Grail Knights who had been blocking the waves of monsters until just now. They lost their holy power in the aftermath of the fog and were swept away by waves of monsters.\nHey it's dangerous here!\nWe'll stop it so hurry up and kill Your Majesty...!\n[You can't leave this place.]\nPowerless at the cries of the Knights of the Burning Sword Rakshaar declared in a mocking voice. He was the only one who didn't lose any strength in this fog.\n[A mortal after all. It returns to a weak human body just because the connection with the divine is cut off.]\nChaos Lord Rakshaar. The great magic he spread by sacrificing the five great demons and the great supply demon.\n[Here you die as helpless humans.]\nDo you have any regrets?\nThe overlord with overwhelming superiority comes with great despair.\n[Lionheart. Where are your gods now? Your gods will no longer hear your voice. Your soul will not go to their paradise.]\n······.\nLeon stood up on his own leaving the side of the Queen Grand Duke and old allies who supported him.\nIt's not a heart but it's a fatal wound. It was a wound that would have been healed by the power of Demera had he not died but it cannot be recovered after the connection with the divinity is severed.\nHe felt awkward about seeing a pure human body that he hadn't seen in hundreds of years.\nGreat...\nBut he got up. Without caring about the open body and the blood flowing through it.\nfather···!\nKarina approached Leon. The cold Northern Grand Duke was restless at this moment.\nyour majesty···.\nBeatrice blocked his way.\nI'll buy you some time. Get out of here with Grand Duke Karina.\nNow that his divinity has been blocked the only one who maintains full power is himself as a great mage.\nBeatrice plans to risk her own life to complete the retreat of the Lion Heart King.\nyou could die will probably die But I had to.\nJim has no intention of retreating.\nyour majesty?\nfather···!\nFace the impossible!\nChallenge the invincible opponent!\nI will walk towards the stars!!\nwalks briskly forward Even at this staggering moment Lion Heart King's gaze is absurdly straight.\nIf you drop your spear use your sword! If you lose your sword use your fists! If even your arms fall off fight with your teeth clenched! What is it that the gods do not feel for a moment! Do not wander. The Mansin is always by your side.\nThe knight turned his back. Even though his body was pierced he held the sword that he did not miss and boarded again on the back of Maengwoo who had fallen off.\nSome might consider it a strategic failure.\nYou might laugh at it saying that it would be a rational thought to run away from this place and plan for the future.\nIt might be considered appropriate to seize the next opportunity at the sacrifice of the knights and soldiers.\nHowever articles should not be rational.\nA knight is one who reveals the dragon.\nIt is indestructible and unbreakable\nIt is an unquenchable glow\nIt is the polar light that cuts through the darkness.\nA being who should be an example to all those who should lead.\nLion Heart King is a symbol of all that indomitability immortality and invincibility.\nThere should be no escape in the name of rationality.\nJust like the Holy Grail Knight Geobrik\nJust like the Holy Grail Knight Zereah\nJust as countless saints and women did not yield in the face of a hopeless reality.\nLion Heart King perseveres in an upright posture in front of the despair he faced 200 years ago.\n“To Lionheart——.”\nOvercome adversity and reach for the stars.\nGlory to you.\nHe is the captain of an endless voyage toward the stars.\n* * * *\nDon't stop! It's pierced!\nSnipe properly from the archers' building! The medium-sized species are just coming in!\nStop those who enter the building! If you lose the sniping point you can't stop the wave!\nIt's a mess.\nWith the protection of the Holy Grail Knights gone the Hunters began to crumble helplessly.\nIn particular when the legion traits that gave overwhelming protection disappeared the debuff of Rakshaar the lord of chaos attacked them harshly.\nWeakness chaos horror confusion screaming fear confusion despair.\nMany products of chaos break them down.\nEven in this overwhelming chaos the reason why they are holding on to their spirit is thanks to the epic item the holy relic and the few knights who handle the holy relic.\nHan Hari a priestess who is the vessel of the two gods.\nCheon So-yeon leader of the Knights of Darkness and Revenge.\nHan Soo-ho the shield of light and justice and Kim Jae-hyeok the knight of heaven and thunder.\nIn addition to that there are S-class knights who albeit belatedly received knight titles and were able to express the existence of knights around me.\nHa Hari! It's all collapsing like this! I can't stand it any longer!\nManager Kim Jin-soo hurriedly shouted but there was no point in saying Han-hari.\nAs the divinity of Leon and the Holy Grail Knights was cut off the enormous holy power flowed into them but they do not represent the gods.\nThere was a limit to each individual's holy power and thanks to Hari's maximal potential due to the heart of fire she could barely face the tidal wave of monsters.\nPe Petos-sama! Poma-sama! What should we do...!\n[Ji-Goo-ha-]\n[hurry-_-]\nThere is noise in the voice. The voice that always answered the voice of the priestess could not reach it.\nIt is not only the knights of the Pantheon that are confused. Hunters gathered from all over the world are not showing their potential.\nNo matter how powerful a person was he was helpless without God's protection in front of the great chaos emitted by the Lord of Chaos.\nUh I have to do something...\nMonsters come endlessly.\nGiant monsters disguised as buildings and buildings attacked from all directions when the sun disappeared.\nWhen the formation collapses and even the knights who are supposed to maintain the formation fall into confusion——\nGo let's go! Do charge!!\nOne knight shouted for a charge unable to hide his trembling voice.\nBut the storm that raged after that voice never softened.\n< Ikki Dang 1000 thousand couples >\n< Destroyer Sword >\nA huge sword strikes down the demons that fill the city.\nHundreds and thousands of swords swept the monsters in the sky like a gust of wind.\nThe old lightsaber?!\nInfinite Sword Kang Jin-seong!\nThe appearance of no hunters representing Korea. And unexpectedly it was the North Korean army who charged with them.\nClean up the monsters!\nHundreds of North Korean hunters hit the sides of the monsters. The appearance of North Korean troops out of nowhere is also an appearance but I saw a familiar person in Hari's eyes.\nUncle Goo Dae-seong?!\nKoo Dae-seong and his colleagues. They were jumping into the middle of the battlefield stabbing monsters with their spears.",

      "content": "< Koo Dae-sung (1) >\nDamn... that's too many.\nGoo Dae-seong and the resistance fighters who entered downtown Pyongyang were fed up with seeing the devil's army filling the city.\nMr. Gu... are you really going to go there?\nTheir power is two no-hunters and guild members representing Korea. A total of 300 people including the most elite North Korean hunters and man-at-arms recruited from the resistance army.\nThe power of about 300 people all made up of hunters was by no means weak.\nA moderate amount of red gates can be cleared if there are about 100 people and if there are 300 people depending on the number of S-class hunters the black gate can also be challenged.\nThe fact that 300 superhumans gathered is to demonstrate that much power. But-\nIt seems that there are more than 100000 that I can see right now.\nAh~ a lot a lot. There's a lot of dirty garbage.\nThe number of enemies was so great that even Kang Jin-seong and Cheon Jin-soo the legendary S-rank hunters in Korea were fed up.\nThe number of 300 is such a shabby unit in this fierce battlefield where 10000 hunters gather and 1000000 enemies flock.\nIf at least communication is connected...\nGoo Dae-seong witnessed the moment satellites around the world crashed and ran straight to this place.\nIn the process they tried to communicate with Yapi and the main body of the Pantheon several times but there was no relay to relay their communication as satellites all over the world were destroyed.\nEven if the emergency communications network is restored it will be too far away before communications can be restored in the middle of this battlefield.\nThis is the path that I detoured as much as possible. If I penetrate 1km I can join the allies but...\nBeyond that Han Hari the Knights of the Pantheon Man-at-Arms and hunters recruited from Korea and around the world could be seen fighting the demons.\nBut within 1km of that.\nIt's a problem that there are only tens of thousands of units in that distance right?\nThe road to the main base of the allies was too rough and full of threats.\nOkay me this old man and the North Korean army are heading over there. But you guys remain here.\nUnexpectedly Cheon Jin-su ordered to stay while watching Goo Dae-sung and Man-at-Arms. No it won't be unexpected.\nIs it because we... are weak?\nI know.\nGoo Dae-sung and Man at Arms. It's not to the extent that the skill is evaluated as ‘bad'.\nRather it's okay to give them a half grade higher than their original skills when it comes to unity and group tactics.\nBut top C. At least the lowest rank in B class. Cheon Jin-soo judged that if that was the limit for the knights and their subordinates it would be impossible to break through the battlefield of Abigyu-hwan.\nBut we must go too.\nThe answer was almost the same as Koo Dae-sung and Kim Do-han.\nEven if you are a young knight friend why are you guys?\nThat... Goddess Ariana and God Petos said that those who run away from the battlefield are doomed.\nWhen we die we must go to paradise.\nFor very religious reasons. But now it was an accident that melted into their lives.\n“And our armed forces are probably more faithful than you. Sir Yapi gave us the latest type of armor because we were struggling in a foreign country.”\nCheon Jin-soo and the other Hunters also realized that. In the battle with the Great Old One Mergiola even the star iron weapons that the Man-at-Arms carried as secondary weapons were a little less than the Legendary level.\nWe'll be able to withstand quite a bit with our overall defense. Then we'll have to give it a higher class.\nAverage B-rank Hunter. Cheon Jin-soo and Kang Jin-seong smiled bitterly at Captain Kim Do-han's words that this would be enough.\nIt will be more dangerous than you think. Stay close.\nCheon Jin-soo raised his sword. Kang Jin-seong was also at the forefront.\nAfter that elite hunters with Shingeom and Cheongseong fill the torso with North Korean soldiers and Man-at-Arms.\ndepart.\nIn the next moment Cheon Jin-soo and Kang Jin-seong swept the lead with the strongest firepower they could.\nFollowing the two elders I will run unconditionally and join the main unit!\nIt's fucking running!\nThe distance from the main unit is about 1 km. If it's far it's far but if there are two legendary S-class hunters the most elite new sword guild and the Qingcheng guild members——\nDon't save your magic! Pour it all out!\n“Don’t spare even those who can use the Holy Law!”\nThe wizards belonging to them used bombardment magic and the believers in the guild who were even appointed to the pantheon used their own spells.\nThey are two guilds that are considered to be strong S-class raiders. They followed the strongest guild leaders and began to break the demons with their mighty potential.\n-······!?\n- These guys?!\nEven the demons are taken aback by the sudden side breakthrough. It was unexpected that new units would appear here.\n- Fight back.\n-Move the rear troops. Guys are few. Swallow it.\nThe world's most bizarre creatures stood in their way. Goo Dae-sung lifted his shield above his upper body on a horse and withstood the intense collision.\nKuh...!\nMr. Goo!\nHe staggers in the face of a huge snake-like creature and barely escapes falling. Goo Dae-seong swung a star-steel sword at the torso of the guy passing by with his still long body.\n-Chack!\nKiie Aeg!\nThe snake devil's scream resounds. Goo Dae-sung's sad iron sword is like rat poison to demons.\n‘And yet I couldn't cut it! It's not enough power!'\nThe snake demon rushed at him with rage after barely scratching his torso but—\nIt's a bit big to eat boshintang.\nPapapak! Dozens of swords pierce the head of the snake demon. Some of Kang Jin-seong's cloned star-steel swords were to defeat the snake demon.\nGo thank you!\nGoo Dae-seong expresses his gratitude for the help of Kang Jin-seong who is also busy fighting at the forefront. But what came back was the urging of a twisted old man.\nRun fast! You're falling behind!\nOops!\nGoo Dae-seong hurriedly grasps the reins. He confirmed that the Man-at-Arms were following him and gradually moved towards the main unit.\nThe distance is about 800m.\n‘you can do it! If I get a little closer I'll be able to receive the protection of the Holy Grail Knights!'\nIf so the combat power of Man-at-Arms would be several times that. It was a calculation that his allies would respond so he could join.\nBut if there's something he's overlooked——\n【 Aura of Chaos 】\n◆Effect\n: Weakness chaos terrifyingness confusion tetanus screaming fear confusion despair body decay mental pollution soul erosion────\nThere is no Holy Grail Knight's protection on this battlefield.\nKeugh?!\nA nightmare-like curse that becomes clearer the closer you get to Rakshaar as you enter the battlefield. It was such a powerful debuff that even the two S-class hunters lost their strength.\nSir the Holy Grail Knight! Lord Vulcanus and Queen Beatrice are...!\nHe believed that if he came here he would receive the protection of his allies. However there is no blessing as expected and a nightmare-like curse slows down the body.\nHeo-eok heo-eok... heeik...!\nThe first to collapse were the North Korean hunters.\nThey don't believe in the existence of God. Unlike the pantheon which can survive with faith in this nightmare-like space the North Korean army's patriotism which was firmly rooted in the existence of evil has collapsed.\nAnd if you hesitate even for a second on this battlefield death will soon strike you.\n- Kiyiik!\nOh no!\nThe moment he stopped the demons grabbed the soldier's arm. Carried away in an instant he became a plaything for grotesque demons and died of being torn limb from limb.\nDon't hesitate! I'm joining the main squad now!!\nGoo Daeseong exclaimed. He snatched and dragged a North Korean hunter who had just been snatched up by the devil's tentacles.\nHe ran half-forced by the horse but he who was an elite hunter barely came to his senses and did not stop matching the horse's stride.\nAww!\nSave...!\nBut when Goo Dae-sung only saved one three North Korean hunters were dragged to death.\n“Geuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...]] It's too heavy!\nEven if the armor can withstand it the body can't stand it!\nThe effectiveness of the star iron armor was enormous even at this moment. She showed considerable resistance with her pure defense but her body could not withstand the debuff and was collapsing.\nBut that too has its limits. They were inherently inferior in specs and the limits that could be overcome with the performance of their armor were clear.\n-Kraaaaaa!\nA club wielded by a giant troll leaping out from the side.\nStop Team 3!\nThe five of them become one body to block the sticking but with a dizzying impact the five of them collapse at once.\nthe legs stop\nthis···!\nWhen Koo Dae-seong was about to turn his horse and launch a reverse charge to rescue them...\n- Papapak!\nAn arrow flew from somewhere and pierced the troll's head. It was Lee Yong-wan.\nAllies are coming in! Cover!\nLee Yong-wan and the long-range hunters who witnessed their approach from the building shot arrows and their precise shooting support saved the Man-at-Arms from danger.\nDamn it! That's too much! Extra firepower! Shoot it in the eye!\n- Giggles!\nIt was the center of the main unit that responded to Lee Yong-wan's cry. They were the Krashatria warriors who had mobilized most of the tribe's warriors for this battle.\nThey aimed their shell cannons fashioned to fit their massive shells and fired like mortar shots.\n-Shhhh!\nThe shells drawing a parabola flew into the air and landed soon after.\n-bang! Kwak!\n- Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa! Quaang!\nThe artillery support of the Kikkiruk warriors was seasoned. They provided artillery support only in the area where the monsters were concentrated but immediately stopped the bombardment when they were concerned about a mistake by their allies.\nAnd the moment the shelling became more frequent——\nCharge forward!!\nWith Cheon So-yeon's command the Naju Knights squeeze through the gap and break through.\nThe distance between them is 600m. However due to the precision sniper support in the high-rise building and the shelling of the kikkiruk tribe it is in a state where a large hole has been pierced.\nThe demons in the middle of both units suddenly found themselves in a position where they were attacked from both sides.\nbreakthrough!\nAnd the clumsy army without formation was an easy prey for the Knights.\nIt was already too late when demons and monsters who had been waking up from the aftermath of the bombardment with the sound of horses stepping on the asphalt noticed their approach.\nLegion Spell < Wedge Charge >.\nAt the same time as the collision the meat pieces were torn apart and the bouncing sound resounded brutally.\nPapapak from beyond! Goo Dae-seong exclaimed excitedly at the sight of the enemy jumping up and down.\nAllies are coming! Let's do our best!\nNot only Man-at-Arms but also the North Korean army which has been collapsing wakes up and runs to wear out the soles of their feet.\nAnd they reach the point where they recognize each other.\nHunter Goo Dae-sung! Hunter Kim Do-han too!\nHa Manager Han Hari!\nThe knights of the pantheon who identify each other with their old titles. The moment they tried to join each other with the momentum they were running—\n[You fools. It was a mistake to move the knights to save those guys.]\nThe midpoint where the two units meet. A magic circle is engraved in the sky above the place where demons and monsters are still mixed.\nClassic bombing magic. It exerts lethal power in chaotic battlefields and in situations where it is impossible to warn of danger while the radio is blocked.\nThe Great Demon of Wisdom the Supremacy of Magic poured out a massive bombardment that hit the Knights and Man-at-Arms.",

The moment I got caught up in the explosion I felt like I heard the voice of a familiar young man—\nSuhoya...!\nA familiar female voice. Goo Dae-seong barely realized that the owner of the voice was Han-hari.\nI'm alive thanks to you.\nUgh... If it wasn't for the power of the holy object I would have really died.\nSuho stood up by touching the ground with his shining shield. The holy relic of the Lionheart Holy Grail Knight he possesses boasts absolute defense.\nAnd the defense was able to cover not only himself but also the troops and because of that he was able to survive the magic bombardment of the great devil.\nThanks to... I'm alive.\nUncle Goo Dae-sung!\nHari and Suho recognized Goo Daesung and approached him. It's been a long time since we met but the situation is urgent.\nYes that's right. Captain Kim Do-han! Is everyone okay!\nUgh... Hey he's alive here.\nI think my ears have gone bad...\nMan-at-Arms rising one by one. Goo Dae-seong was relieved that they were safe but soon his expression distorted.\nUh ugh...!\nMy my leg. My leg!\nThe shield of protection was a shield with great power but it was not enough to cover the entire unit.\nKeugh...!\nThe most lagging comrades were bombarded. There······.\n‘My back is broken! Isolated!'\nThe backs of the Naju Knights and the reinforcements were divided by the Great Devil's bombing magic. Partly to avoid the bombing magic partly due to the intrusion of monsters... The troops were cut into small pieces and isolated on this road.\n‘Aiming to defeat each individual within this short period of time?'\nIs it the enemy's command? They aren't just beasts in numbers. It must have been the command and control of a high-ranking demon.\nTake care of the wounded! Coming again!\nThe monsters flocking towards the divided troops. The North Korean soldiers and Man-at-Arms who were scattered with injuries were the first to be hunted.\nCaptain Kim!\nGoo Dae-seong grabbed his shield and rushed to save his ally. Knock! He stopped his teeth trying to eat his comrades but he was able to save only one or two.\n- Kwajik!\nAww!\nA colleague who barely manages to recover is bitten by a giant monster's mouth and disappears.\nUgh uhhh...\nThe young North Korean hunter who was crouching and trembling overwhelmed by the curse of chaos was trampled to death without recognizing the footprints of the large devil that was thrown at him.\nMr. Koo Dae-sung! Step back first!\nKim Jae-hyeok who dropped thunder and dealt with the devil with a mighty blow. But even that didn't last long. The demon slashed at him with his claws.\nUgh! You idiot!\nChun So-yeon jumped in and severed the demon who was about to take an extra hit with the Seongmai sword. But soon a projectile from her blind spot lodged in her shoulder and it was a poison dart.\nI'll buy you some time!\nHan Hari raised her holy power. Her fire is combined with the sea god's power to sweep the battlefield in waves of flame.\nUpon contact the bodies of the monsters turn to ashes and disappear. Really overwhelming firepower. But even that is just a momentary buy.\nYou too many...!\nMonsters quickly filling the void. Just as she is about to drive her sexuality again a chilling sensation overtakes her.\nah.\nshort flurry. Her demons who snipe her Hari attack her.\nsister!\nSuho hurriedly protects her. However Hari who had already allowed her dozens of attacks was bleeding her blood.\nIt was because he was so focused on wiping out the incoming enemies that he didn't pay attention to the long-range defense method. She was able to live because her armor made entirely of star iron prevented her from being fatally wounded.\n[Are these new articles?]\n······!\nA sharp blade attacking the back of Suho who supports Hari. Suho raises his shield belatedly but the blade cut through the gap and cuts through his thighs and waist.\nKeugh...!\nSuho-kun!\nGoo Dae-seong urgently rushed to help him. But-\n[What are you?]\nI'm sorry.\nGoo Dae-sung groaned and tried to touch the blood spattering on his face.\nGu Mr. Koo Dae-sung!\nSuho's urgent voice. Goo Dae-seong made a puzzled expression when he saw his shield rolling on the floor.\n‘Why is the shield over there...'\nWhy is the shield tightly strapped to my left arm——\nAvoid!\n- Kaang!\nThe sound of metal crashing in your ears. He realizes that it is a picture of a Bakdo wielded by a giant demon measuring more than 2m colliding with the protective shield that surrounds him.\n[You've become weak.]\nThe devil had six arms. And also six knives. The sword he wielded blew the two of them apart with the shield of protection.\nIt's black...!\n······!!\nSeeing the two people rolling on the floor unseemly the Great Devil clicked his tongue.\n[Compared to them I'm weak. You are not a real knight.]\nAn efficient battle in which the four knights the core of the Naju Knights were accurately shot and neutralized. This is the result of less than a minute since the two Great Demons intervened in the battle.\n[Lionheart's article is only this much. It's a disappointing ending.]\nThe great devil of pleasure and corruption. When he saw old hunters wielding huge swords and hundreds of swords in different directions he turned his attention to the two and left to deal with them.\nUgh...\nGoo Dae-seong tried to stand up on the ground but he staggered and realized his absence.\nUncle your arm...\nah······.\nOnly then did Koo Dae-seong realize that his arm holding the shield had been amputated.\nunexpectedly.\nNo screams came out. I don't know if it's because of the excessive secretion of adrenaline but the emotion that came out of him right now is a faint sigh from collapse.\nUntil the moment his arm was cut off Goo Dae-seong did not see anything. He was overpowered by the roughly swung sword as if it was not worth his attention.\nAh Mister. Sister. First stop the bleeding—\nSuho tied up his sister and Koo Dae-seong who had lost his arm with bandages.\nIn the midst of the overwhelming devastation Goo Dae-seong who had completed only minimal treatment saw his colleagues fighting monsters.\nProtect the knights! Raise the shield!!\nKim Do-han gritted his teeth and raised his shield. The shield extends from the left shoulder to the waist. The empty part is a collective formation that is protected by the shields of allies.\nThey used straight away what they were trained to live for.\nAaaaaaagh!\nWhispering holding up a shield and enduring the heavy weight of medium-sized monsters.\nA man-at-arms who lost their weapon in the aftermath of the bombing magic tried to hold on to the shield with both hands.\nDamn it too many enemies!\nShield! Shield soldiers more concentrated! Protect each other!\nTo protect the knights!\nThey were desperate to protect the knights the only hope in this phase. They had to protect the four knights who dug in unreasonably to save themselves.\nTheir value on this battlefield was far more important than hundreds of men-at-arms.\nThe Knights! When will the Cheongseong Guild and the Shingeom Guild come to help!\nUrgent sounds erupt from here and there. Goo Dae-sung held up the star-steel sword that was still tightly gripped by his right arm.\nmister?\nWe have to fight...\nYour injuries are the worst! We have to step back and treat them!\n······no.\nGoo Dae-seong smiled bitterly and refused to dissuade Suho. He grabbed his stomach which seemed to be burning hot a little while ago.\nOld man?! The wound...!\nIt wasn't just the arm that was cut off. The Demon Sword of the Great Devil tore apart even the star iron armor and cut down Gu Daeseong.\nAt least if it wasn't for the star iron armor my body would have been cut in half.\nI can't live long... Suho-kun take Miss Hari and leave.\ndeath is certain Not only is it impossible to return to the treatment center from this turbid battlefield but it is also questionable whether you can survive until you go.\nSo Goo Dae-sung decided to do what he could.\n- Kaang!\nMore thanks to you I'm alive! Goo Mr. Goo?!\nHolding the sword with his other arm he cut off the demon's sword that was about to stab Kim Do-han. He was surprised to see Goo Dae-sung in a miserable condition but Goo Dae-sung silently swung his sword at the devil.\n- Kitkit!\nHowever the devil easily avoided Gu Dae-seong's sword which was more like struggling than swinging the sword. Rather the sword stabbed in a counterattack tore his neck.\nKeugh...!\nAlthough blood splattered Goo Dae-seong instinctively stabbed his sword. However as expected the devil easily knocked out Koo Dae-sung's counterattack.\n-Your skills are terrible compared to the armor!\nI grit my teeth at the devil's mockery. because it was true\nThe devil cleverly harassed Goo Goo-seong in the gap between the monsters.\nHiding under the feet of monsters rushing in and cutting off their ankles they stab their colleagues in the seat next to them as if to keep an eye on them.\nWhen Goo Dae-sung tried to protect him he changed the direction of the attack and cut him off as if he had never done that.\nHa-jaw... Ha-jaw...!\nHe exhaled heavily and grasped the nape of his neck which seemed to be being supported by a heated iron. A sword wielded with only one arm without a shield soon reached its limit.\n‘Is it going to die...'\nIt's not even a high-ranking devil let alone a major devil. Bladed demons that are common in Demon Gate.\nHe was being manipulated even by that level of devil.\nAre there any other knights who are so common? I am fed up with my own powerlessness.\n[< Blessing of the Knight of Life > continues to heal damage.]\nUnlike the message in the system window colleagues continue to fall in the vicinity. The accumulated damage couldn't be regenerated with just that kind of protection.\n‘finished.'\nLate D-class Goo Dae-sung. The end of his efforts to encourage himself saying that his efforts are no less than anyone else's ends without saving the lives of his colleagues.\n- Stop dying now.\nHe sees the sagging sword and hears the devil's laughter. But at the same time-\n[The sword is not only a wielding weapon but also the fastest armor. Always keep your sword in a position where you can respond.]\nIt is located above the navel. Thanks to the voice that came to mind I inadvertently raised my sword and blocked the demon's sword.\n- Kang!\nA clear and clean sound hits the ears where tinnitus was heard. Her arm trembled in shock.\n[You look like me.]\nuh?\nA certain knight's voice continued to tickle my ears. No it's a memory that came up in a kaleidoscope.\nKoo Dae-seong unconsciously recalling the knight's training sparring did not lower his sword from the center of his belly button.\nThat alone somehow blocks the demon's sword. Even with cuts tears and numbness in the arms the ‘life' continues.\nThe moment you're about to give up you think of the man who comes to mind the one who gives a foolish sensible answer to the question of why you're not giving up.\n[This is because the challenge does not require the evaluation of others.]\nimpossible.\nThere is no reason why it should be excluded from the challenge.\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\nHe in his later years D-class Goo Dae-seong continued to burst into meaningless evil. As if trying to burn the will like this.\nAaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nAt that very moment-\n‘from now on.'\nI don't know why I'm thinking this now. It was as if someone the voice of a woman so benevolent and kind was whispering in my ear.\n‘from now on.'\nHow reckless it is to go before the tidal waves of demons that have formed so many great seas.\nHow could he who could not properly block even a sword wielded by a mediocre demon pass through this tidal wave head-on?\nI have neither a shield nor the energy to wield a sword.\n[Young knight. young man Do you know Yong(勇)?]\n[Courage... is that a word?]\n[Or it could be bravery.]\n[Or it could be love.]\n[Or maybe hope.]\nNogu's training knight smiled at himself who was hesitant.\n[A knight is someone who handles dragons. It is roaring bravery unbreakable hope and pure love.]\n[The Holy Grail Knight is the pinnacle of such dragons. It is a symbol of courage.]\n[Do you think the Holy Grail Knight has a dragon?]\nTo him who was about to answer that question of course... the second son of Jordic Vertum. A knight of the Riona Sunset Knights. The man who eventually became the first knight to serve dreams and death said.\n[No one is born with dragons from the beginning. It cannot be owned it is not given and it is not obtainable.]\nwith a firm gaze. The old fool who had never experienced success spoke with such a firm gaze.\n[The dragon is demonstrated.]\nSo.\n[Young knight. When you pray to have a dragon will the gods bestow you with a dragon? Or... will you give me a chance to show off my courage?]\n‘from now on.'\nfrom now on.\none step. from now on.\n“Mr. Gu?!”\n-?!!\nGoo Dae-sung's sudden action draws attention from both enemies and allies.\nA collapsing dustproof. As he advances towards the tidal wave full of malice he does something crazy without questioning it.\nGoo Dae-sung himself knows this.\nHe was a D-class in his later years but even after becoming a knight he fell behind others and stayed as a pilgrim knight.\nEven proper kingdom knights are taking a reckless step toward the enemy's formation that they cannot penetrate.\n‘from now on.'\nGuided by a woman's voice one too reckless step.\n- You're crazy! die!\nThe devil who had been watching him for the pleasure of teasing the weak man swung his sword wide. Koo Dae-seong knew that he could not move forward as long as the demon existed.\nso.\nI went one more step forward.\n-·······?!\nWith a sense of distance he took a step forward instead of defending against the sword he swung. The devil was surprised by Goo Dae-sung's unexpected behavior and swung his sword.\nThe sword that struck him cut off his ears and knocked out his star armor. One of his ears was cut off but the moment the demon stiffened from the impact of the hard armor-\nMove.\nimpediment to progress.\n- Oops!\nA star-steel sword that pierces the heart of a demon. The devil who gave up his breath collapses.\nHowever defeating just one demon cannot stop the tidal wave. Goo Dae-seong looked at the waves of malice that would soon come towards him. And once again a woman's voice is heard.\n‘little bit more.'\nGuided by the woman's voice he took another step.\nWith this a humble person named Goo Dae-seong passed through the footprints on the threshold of death.\n-Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\n- You idiot! kill it!\nThe moment when hundreds of thousands of malice were about to attack Goo Dae-seong.\n‘Well done my child.'\nIt fell with a proud benevolent voice...\n-thud!\n······!\n-······!?\nIt suddenly fell from the sky. Even on the turbid battlefield its appearance was so sudden that everyone stopped and looked at it.\nIt was in the shape of a hammer.\nA warhammer suited for one-handed wielding.\nBut it's so thick and big that it's awkward unless you're a big guy.\nCrab Sir Geobrick's hammer?!\nGrail Knight Geobric's one-handed hammer.\nAn epic item that sanctified the Naju Mansinjeon.\nThe hammer's presence was so strong that it made his enemies feel the same way.\nI can't let you hold that.\n-Damn it!\n-Uuuuuuuuuuuu!\nWhether it was devils with intelligence monsters without intelligence or variants of the North Korean army they all came to mind.\nThe moment you hold that thing something terrible will happen.\nah···.\nHowever unlike their desperate screams the closest thing to the hammer was Goo Dae-sung who took a ‘step' and ‘forward' by forcing all recklessness and bullying.\n-Ack!\nThe moment the handle of the hammer was gripped in his free arm...\nHuh?!\nD-Did you hear?!\nWith a flashing hammer a vast green light rose from beneath the ground breaking through the asphalt.\nIt rose from the earth enveloped a knight penetrated the sky and ascended revealing its existence to the entire planet.\n[System message: Grail Knight of Life and Abundance Daesung Koo's protection is applied to the entire legion.]\nA new Holy Grail Knight has been born in the world.",

Goo Dae-sung put on a blank expression at Demera who was staring at him with a benevolent smile.\n[This is my proud child who stood up on his own in the midst of turbidity. Your indomitable will made me pick up the hammer.]\nGoo Dae-seong couldn't believe himself when he saw the hammer in his hand.\nI couldn't believe that I was holding a hammer that was so heavy... a hammer that not even geniuses in the world could lift.\nUh how...\nI am a lacking person He is such a weak and incompetent criminal. He's too ordinary to be a hero...\nDemera shook her head and said the qualifications she doubted herself.\n[Baby a hero is not one who does not fall.]\nShe knows the indomitability that the Holy Grail Knights who have supported the kingdom have in common.\nThey were geniuses superhumans and great souls. However geniuses with such talent existed in every age and every generation.\nThey were not ‘those who do not fall'.\nEven Leon Dragonia Lionheart the strongest grail guardian.\n[A hero is someone who stands up.

It brought great confusion to the battlefield and meant that one side of the battlefield collapsed.\n* * * *\nIt's amazing Knight Koo Dae-seong!\n“Your uncle is so awesome! No should I call you Holy Grail Knight?”\nAs the front line collapsed due to the awakening of Goo Dae-sung knights and hunters flocked to him.\nThey sent a gaze of awe and respect toward the saint who appeared in the turbid battlefield which was very awkward for Goo Dae-seong.\nHey there...\nThank you Mr. Gu!\nThanks to that I no longer have to receive disability benefits!\nMan at Arms expressing their gratitude towards Koo Dae-sung. Not only them but also the North Korean soldiers and some hunters who witnessed the miracle he caused shed tears and knelt down.\nYou're amazing Mr. Goo Dae-sung!\nah······.\nKoo Dae-sung fell into a strange feeling when he saw Han Ha-ri looking at him with respect.\nA genius representing a generation. As a priestess who was even loved by the gods Goo Dae-sung had no choice but to feel inferior.\nIs it only her? All the knights of the Mansinjeon were geniuses superior to him and Goo Dae-seong was a pilgrim knight even while they were appointed as knights and were active.\nHow could he be looked upon by geniuses whom he envied and felt inferior to?\nIt's a sight I've always dreamed of but it can't be this awkward when it actually happens.\nOh thank you.\nThank you. We should thank you!\nWow~ Mr. Goo Dae-sung... No no Goo Dae-sung Holy Grail Knight! Receive a big bow!\nKoo Dae-sung is frightened and stops Kim Jae-hyeok who bows in a big way. Even though he became a Holy Grail Knight he still had new breasts.\nOh that's right! This is not the time! Goddess Demera told me! Help her Majesty!\nAh...!\nA fact that I inadvertently forgot because I witnessed an amazing miracle.\nThe reason they collapsed so rapidly was because the protection of the Lion Heart King and the Holy Grail Knights disappeared.\nNeedless to say the side of the World Tree infiltrated by the Holy Grail Knights. This is where the Ryugyong Hotel is located.\nStop let's hurry!\nKoo Dae-seong hurriedly joined the main unit with the knights of the Mansinjeon.\nEven with empty words the war situation could not be said to be good because even though Koo Dae-seong had completely destroyed one side waves were still crashing incessantly from the front and left side of the Ryugyong Hotel.\nThe good news is that Goo Dae-sung's protection offsets the curse of chaos to some extent and the front line is maintained but that is not enough to overcome the war situation.\nDamn it! Kill and kill there is no end!\nThe Great Devil Appears! S-class Hunters must respond!\nThey're flocking to the front again! Reinforce our power this way!\nmany.\nMillions of enemies are not empty words.\nThe reason Lionheart tried to defeat the enemy's leader with a special attack was this ignorant number.\nEven if the Holy Grail Knights were beings with perfect vitality and never got tired the others weren't.\nHumans who are not saints have limited physical strength and depletion of physical strength on the battlefield meant death.\nWe must support His Majesty. We need the power of the Holy Grail Knights to overcome this battlefield!\nBut how? Right now all I can do is hold on...\nNo matter how much Grail Knight Goo Dae-seong joins he is still an individual after all. If several Holy Grail Knights gather they will not be able to overcome this difficulty on their own.\nI wonder if it was Leon the agent of the gods the almighty Guardian of the Holy Grail.\n······!\nIt was a brilliant idea.\nGoo Dae-seong saw the knights crowding around him.\n“I have no choice but to do it.”\nIt doesn't matter if you can do it or not but if it's something you have to do.\nFrom now on please ask everyone whose name is called to join us.\nAfter a while the forefront of the battlefield.\nGoo Dae-sung arrived at the place where he was barely holding the front line from the terrifyingly many demons.\n······.\nAnd next to it the banquet of names continued all the way behind.\nHan Ha-ri the goddess of war flame sea and waves.\nHan Soo-ho a knight of light and justice.\nJaehyuk Kim the Knight of Heaven and Thunder.\nCheon So-yeon a knight of darkness and vengeance.\nthere is another\nOh Kang-hyeok president of the Korea Hunter Association.\nLee Yong-wan and Ha Yu-ri of the Firebird Guild.\nHwang Yeon-ha and Hwang Yeon-ha of the Golden Lion Guild.\nCheon Jin-soo of the New Swords Guild and Kang Jin-seong of the Cheongseong Guild.\nPark Yong-shin the lord of Hanbit Palace Takeda president of the New Japan Hunter Association and Japanese S-class hunters.\nAllen Taylor and Minuteman of the Maverick Guild of the United States.\nCount-class pilots the most elite warriors of the Kirk tribe.\nAll of them are rated as S-class powers and they are people with comparable skills.\nTheir characteristic is that they are all those who were appointed as knights by Leon in the pantheon and received the blessings of the gods.\nNamely sex law users.\nKoo Dae-sung who was at the forefront of all of them said.\nI will break through the lead. Han Ha-ri and Kim Jae-hyeok create gaps with their conversation skills and Cheon So-yeon and Han Su-ho support the formation one step behind.\nHorses do not ride. To match the whole movement and stride as one.\nInstead the horse's collision power is replaced with the conversation power. At the center he and Hari stand.\nYou don't have to be omnipotent. You have to use your strength to the fullest and move as one body for a moment. Otherwise it will be difficult.\nHow much can you do? Unlike himself the others are not ‘God's agents' but only to the extent of using ‘God's power'.\nThere is a limit to the size of the bowl where the holy power is stored and the size of the faucet that pours out the holy power is also small. but······.\nI believe. All of you are geniuses. You are knights recognized by the gods and even by your Majesty. So at this moment—\nGoo Dae-sung holds a hammer. His voice contained infinite vitality and firm will that was different from before.\nWe recreate the Lionheart.\n< Koo Dae-sung (3) > End",

Therefore its power is no different from that of God and therefore it is omnipotent.\nThe flame of Petos boasting overwhelming firepower.\nDemera's life force that grants allies tremendous regenerative power and sustenance.\nUltima's lightning or wide-area protection that causes natural disasters and the Tartar sun that melts enemies in the field.\nAriana's light cut through anything.\nIs that all?\nThe history of the 300-year war itself he is the strongest assaulter who can break through any obstacle and the most demon slayer who makes evil tremble just by his existence. demonic fear.\nHe is an existence that strengthens the legion with just his presence and he is a superman who can exert the power of a thousand and one thousand people alone.\nEveryone here realized that it was possible to break through any unfavorable battlefield with just that one existence.\nEven when dealing with Cheongju's killing machine Yakt Spinner\nEven in the world of the magician queen who repeats destruction\nEven in front of the demon archduke who subjugates all living things\nBeast gods slaughter masters even demon lords who can destroy the world with a beckoning gesture.\nDestiny changes with only one being the Lion Heart King.\nWe recreate the Lionheart.\nTherefore in this extremely unfavorable battleground Koo Dae-sung judged that he had a chance to win only by reproducing his strength.\nBut... how?\nHari was dubious about Koo Dae-seong's words even here where the best fighters except for the Holy Grail Knights gathered.\nLiterally ‘excluding the Holy Grail Knights'. There was also a Holy Grail Knight Koo Dae-seong but only one of them.\nThe reason Lion Heart is so strong is not only the individual's superhuman strength and experience but also the versatility of the spell that is infinitely close to omnipotence.\nHow do you cover this with the people gathered here?\nLooking at the size of power right now Hanhari which boasts the largest firepower is not even close to Vulcanus.\nIf Hari who is at most the top rank of the Knights of the Burning Sword is like that it goes without saying for the others.\nThat's probably possible now.\nhow?\n“Because Your Majesty and the Grail Knights are not using their powers.”\nHoly Grail Knights and Burning Sword Knights. Their situation was Koo Dae-seong who had heard of Demera.\nAlthough the Pantheon Temple has recovered a considerable amount of influence after settling on Earth it is still not at the level of reproducing its former glory.\nLeon also knew this so he did not use the greatest power called Divine Advent.\nNevertheless the holy power used by Leon Vulcanus Beatrice Yakt Spinner and Karina is enormous.\nDue to its nature of representing the power of God itself there is no limit to its output so it is no different from a hippopotamus that uses its holy power.\nBut now they have lost their connection to divinity and are unable to use their holy power.\nIn other words it means that the enormous reserves of holy power they used are sleeping without being used anywhere.\nYou only need to break through the front line until you reach ‘it'. Otherwise—\n-gulp!\nUpon hearing the plan the knights swallowed their saliva and participated in Goo Dae-sung's plan. In the end if not everyone dies.\nIn order to overcome this situation the Lion Heart King and the Holy Grail Knights must have their strength.\nIf you have to do something you have to do it.\nWhoa...\nKoo Dae-sung who was in the lead felt indescribably awkward about his own positioning.\nIt was a fluke after all that he became a Holy Grail Knight.\nHe met a gifted man named Zerea and learned how to live his life and although he could not meet him he was able to become a Holy Grail Knight because of Geobrick who inherited his power in the hammer.\nCompared to the real Holy Grail Knights he was lucky to get a position. Can such a person take over their role?\nMr. Koo Dae-sung...\nAt that time Cheon So-yeon speaks from the side.\n“Why why are you like that Commander?”\nCheon So-yeon is the leader of the first knights in Naju. Although she was quite young her Goo Dae-seong inadvertently gave her her respect.\nThere's no need to be respectful. Koo Dae-seong is older than me... It's a bit awkward for us to call him Gyeonggyeong...\nYou are the Holy Grail Knight.\nAt Cheon So-yeon's words Goo Dae-seong realized that his position had changed.\n“Rather than that can you pour a big technique into the front at the same time as the front advance?\nHaving made hundreds of charges as a knight commander she gave Goo Dae-seong appropriate advice.\nThat... I'll do a good job hammering.\n“No if you are a Holy Grail Knight of Life and Abundance... you should be able to use the power of the earth.”\nCheon So-yeon told the story of Geobrick the Holy Grail Knight whom she saw and fought alongside.\nAnd that was great advice for Goo Dae-sung who had just become a Holy Grail Knight.\nDo prepare to charge!!\nIn the awkwardness leading those who looked up to him as a genius Koo Dae-seong shouted and everyone raised their swords and spears.\n‘Use the power of the earth. how······.'\nGoo Dae-seong imagined. Demera said that the earth of the whole world was definitely on her side.\nAlso the holy law is a miracle that comes true as the knight desires. If the Holy Grail Knight desires the miracle of the land the land responds to his wishes.\nlift one's feet\nI don't know why. It concentrates its strength on the nearest body part that is vaguely connected to the ground and spreads it into the ground like a root while striking it down.\nDaeseongbeop < Spear of the Earth >\nWow!\nAn inexorable tremor rang through the city of Pyongyang.\nThe holy power penetrating deep into the ground becomes a huge spear that Goo Dae-sung wishes for changing the terrain and pouring out a huge mass sharply.\n-Key profit?!\n-······!?\nIt is an overwhelming mass of spears. The huge monster that was charging at the hunters was stabbed in half by a sharp spear of the earth and the demons and monsters that were pushed out in the aftermath became mush.\nA group of monsters tearing apart like dolphins hit by a giant battleship. And the spear of the earth that stopped stabbing becomes a huge ‘road'.\nCheon So-yeon remembered the knights running on this huge road.\nNow! Charge through the land!\nWith her cry hundreds or thousands of hunters charge all at once.\nThey charged through the spears of the completely empty earth and broke through hundreds of meters at once. And when you have to jump off the cliff at the end-\nReel the big one!\nAt the bottom of the cliff foreboding that the enemy would jump down Ultima's spearmen lifted up their holy spears to the crowd of demons.\nSeongbeop < Heaven's Wrath >\n-Quarreung!\nLightning strikes in the dry sky. However the scale of the sky echo is too large to be an ordinary vocal method.\nThe Holy Spear left behind by Ulan the Holy Grail Knight of Heaven and Thunder is the best repeater that focuses the thunder of Ultima.\nThe focused thunderbolts drop amplified thunderbolts several times in the location desired by the spear owner.\n- Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwang!\nIt sounded like hundreds of bombs exploding at the same time. Powerful thunderbolts rained down on the densely packed monsters that would obstruct the advance of the allies.\nThanks to this when the knights jumped out of the window of the earth only charred corpses were left.\n[You guys...!]\nThe great devil who was commanding from the rear... He ordered hundreds of high-ranking devils.\n[Stops on landing. It melts with firepower.]\nNow that they could not use the long-distance defense method of the corps the knights were exposed to the most vulnerable enemy attacks.\nAnd the demons who had removed the worst debuff of disabling long-range weapons poured firepower into the forefront to destroy the city.\nI'll stop you!\nHan Soo-ho who was guarding Goo Dae-seong raised his shield. The shield left by Sir Amalek the Holy Grail Knight of Light and Justice absorbs the light of Goddess Ariana and summons a huge protective shield.\n-Quaaaaaa!\nA shield that blocks the pouring power of conversation. Since it was a situation where only the front had to be protected the guardian's shield brilliantly protected all the hunters in the rear.\nOh is this okay?\nThe firepower is too strong? Isn't it piercing the shield?\nApart from such worries Suho's expression was confident.\nThe holy relic of Lord Amalek the Holy Grail Knight of Light and Justice is an absolute defense. That confidence is never false.\nThe shield of light summoned according to the will of the caster is not a simple light barrier.\nComplete blocking of physical interference. Create another wall in the world to realize absolute defense. The front side protected by this shield cannot be penetrated by any attack.\n[Chit...! Annoying items! Aim for the side!]\nWhen it became impossible to interfere in the front the commander the Great Devil made a huge amount of water dig into the side. In the end this overwhelming difference in quantity will not be overcome.\nWhoa...!\nHarry put his hand on my heart.\nIsabel priest of the moon and purity inherited two sacred objects from Hari.\nA bracelet of waves left by Maroon the priest of the 3 seas and waves.\nA heart of fire left by Duke Renoir the saint of the first war and flame.\nThe bracelet of waves controls ‘water' and the heart of fire creates ‘fire' by itself.\nThe fact that this power which is the opposite itself can coexist is due to the speciality of the sex method but it also means that Hari's own vessel is huge.\nCitizens who will use Pyongyang in the future! I'm sorry! The infrastructure just needs to be rebuilt!!\nHarry decided to squeeze all his strength. The maximum development that has not been done while worrying about the aftermath.\nHuh? Is the ground shaking?\nIs Mr. Goo doing something?!\nAt that moment the ground rumbles to the extent that one wonders if Daesung Koo the Holy Grail Knight is using another holy method. But soon they realized that it wasn't the way to deal with the earth.\n- Knock!\nAt first a small stream of water gushed through the asphalt.\n- Knock! Kwak Kwa Kwak!\n- Kwak Kwah Kwak Kwak!\nAnd it surges in all directions forming wave heights like a tsunami.\nSir could it be that the city's water pipes burst?!\nThat rumor is true.\nHarin is a priestess who handles water. Her power granted to her by the god Poma made it possible to create all those waters into her waves.\nSeongbeop < Waves >\nWater pipes all over Pyongyang burst and the pouring water created a tsunami in the city. And that's not all.\nMr. Petos...!\nHari poured all the holy power generated from her heart into a huge flame.\nFor this war the gods of the pantheon brought all their surplus holy power to the temple of the god of war.\nIt was to leave enough holy power to be used by Vulcanus who uses his holy power profusely and the Burning Sword Knights the strongest of the pantheon.\nAnd now when Vulcanus and the Knights of the Burning Sword cannot use holy power the enormous holy power left on the altar of the god of war.\nIt is pouring through Hari the priestess of the god of war.\nThe sparks merged with the waves formed by the waters of the entire city of Pyongyang to create waves of flame—\ncrazy······.\ncover the whole stream.\nIt's not just them.\nSeongbeop users who have been appointed as knights and use Seongbeop so far.\nAll of them unsparingly poured out their holy power to fill the void left by the giants called Holy Grail Knights.\nIt is an endless series of miracles.\nClearly they poured everything out for a momentary breakthrough—\nfrom now on!!\nIn this instant the lion heart king was reproduced.\n* * * *\nAlthough the Holy Grail Knights lost their holy power due to the blockage with the divine he did not lose his own body.\nHoly Grail Knight Vulcanus was the strongest monster of the era even without holy power and Magician Queen Beatrice focused on magic rather than holy power from the beginning.\nThey resisted Rakshaar with their holy power cut off in their own way but there was a Holy Grail Knight who couldn't even do that.\n- Severe damage to the aircraft. Reduced reactor power by 0.2%.\nYakt Spinner.\nThis strong artificial intelligence robot knight the holy grail knight of iron and blacksmith is a broken product that would have stopped functioning long ago.\nAs the reactor that moved the fuselage collapsed in half it was unable to cover its own energy which naturally led to a shutdown.\nHowever Yapi was reborn with the blessing of the pantheon.\nThe half-destroyed nuclear reactor produced energy that would be incomprehensible no matter what scientific basis it brought and the source of that power was divine.\nIn such a situation the connection with the divine was cut off and the Marquis-class aircraft which was full of safety energy was completely destroyed.\nWhat is currently driving Yappy is a very small amount of residual energy. Even that is on the verge of breaking down soon.\n-Kick! Residual energy 6.8%.\nYafi was busy looking around with a broken camera eye and shuffling around on her broken leg.\n- Quaang! Kwak Kwa Kwak!\nRakshaar is fighting. However it was doubtful whether it should be considered a battle.\nVulcanus Karina Beatrice... Even now when they couldn't use their holy power they fought desperately but they were like child's play in front of the Lord of Chaos.\nAbove all-\n-Kick! your majesty.\nLeon was the first to suffer.\nHe was mortally wounded and could not even recover and stood at the forefront.\nIt was inevitable that he would be the first to fall because he continued to fight unreasonably.\nFalling unconscious he continued his fight with strange recklessness. As if waiting for something.\n-·······.\nIt is not a sensibility that a machine can understand.\nFrom the first time he met him at the Cheongju Gate until now Leon has been a mysterious existence to Yapi.\n[A knight of loyalty and loyalty. It is because all living beings across dimensions owe a debt to your service.]\nHowever the words he said on that day when Yapi's long defensive battle came to an end remain deep in the data.\n- Emergency use of residual energy. Non-consideration of object maintenance cost.\ndisassemble the body There were not many parts that could be salvaged from the broken body. However in his thousand-year defense battle Yapi learned the most efficient way to use his resources by disassembling and attaching his body thousands and tens of thousands of times.\nRemove the armor that protected the broken reactor and melt the lead bullets remaining in the fuselage and put them together.\nThe damaged bridge was disassembled and became a ‘sack' to connect something.\nWhen it formed a certain form Yapi put all of the remaining holy power in the reactor into it.\nThis is only possible because it is Yappy who stores even his holy power in the form of a save cap.\n-144 seconds to stop the aircraft.\nLeaving only enough holy power to move Yaffe lifted ‘it' which was created by disassembling his own body.\n[Sir Yacht Spinner the knight who saw that your quest has been completed solemnly declares.]\nOn the day the old duty ends Yapi has a new duty. that's obvious-\n- Start polishing.\nThe final hammering of the iron and blacksmith Holy Grail Knight has begun.",

Run away!!\nThe leading demons scream and shout.\nbreakthrough.\nIt was nothing compared to the breakthrough power of the knights who received the blessing of the strongest assaulter.\nThey deliberately gave up on their words and matched each other's stride with their bare bodies.\nThe charge was not fast but it was steadily and steadily taking one step forward.\n[That guy... he became the center...!]\nAt the forefront is a knight in green armor.\nHoly Grail Knight Koo Dae-sung. He stands at the forefront and breaks the tidal wave with a hammer.\nIf you look at the situation of forcibly squeezing in and blowing away the terrifyingly dense waves of malice it is truly a Holy Grail Knight.\nThat is the Holy Grail Knight.\nThe greatest enemy of demons.\n[Don't be arrogant on a topic that's not even real!]\nIn order to prevent the collapse of the front line the Great Devil directly steps forward. The Archdemon sniped Goo Dae-seong using the maximum firepower magic he could use.\nThat magic is really AAA grade. It was comparable to that of the Great Mage and Magician Queen.\n-Quaaaa!\nI'll stop you!\nSuho moves forward with magic rather than normal momentum. Amalek's shield which separates even the dimension of his space will block even the magic of the great devil.\nThe aftermath will bounce! Stop that!\nHowever Goo Dae-seong dissuaded Suho and took up his own shield.\nearth shield.\nThis shield gifted by the goddess Demera has great power but it is not a conceptual armament that separates dimensions like Amalek's shield.\n- Kwak-kwa-kwa-kwak!\nViolent waves of magic collide with the Earth's shield. The shield made of tree roots burned in real time. But-\n‘My shield is the shield of infinite life! As long as the protection of the earth is with you it will never be broken!'\n[······!]\nThe Great Devil doubted his own eyes. His own magic which seemed to pierce his earth's shield at once was pushed back by his firepower which seemed to burn the crude roots at any moment.\n[Incinerated and regenerated at the same time?!]\nThe shield of the earth was burned as if it were about to break but new roots soon filled the incinerated spot. Terrible regenerative power indeed. Even Koo Dae-seong who is using it is astounding.\nAnd that's not all.\nEven the hunters who were swept away by the aftermath of the magic are torn here and there and immediately regenerate on the spot even if they have suffered damage that would stop them from walking.\nGolden Chul who swung a huge golden hammer at the monsters from the front shouted confidently.\nThat nobleman's unit was tenacious like real cockroaches!\n“What are cockroaches really?”\nThe Legion guarded by the Holy Grail Knight of Life naturally shares its vitality.\nTo the extent that even if he cuts out his own ‘heart' he continues to fight to some extent.\nfrom now on···!\n“from now on···!!”\niced coffee······.\nIt doesn't stop.\nEven the strongest magic and bombing magic aimed at the explosive range of cotton are meaningless in front of the shield of absolute protection and the regeneration of life force stronger than cockroaches.\n[These worms...!]\nUnbearable Grantusk stepped forward. He raised an ax enchanted with curses and slashed it at his leader Goo Dae-seong.\nSuck!\nEarth's shield to block it. The shield was split in half with a single blow but it rather entangled Grantusk's axe.\nWe have a great Holy Grail Knight!\nTaking advantage of the gap where the ax got stuck in the root of a tree Kim Jae-hyeok holding the Uhlan holy spear unleashed a sharp stab. However Grantusque's arm was directed at him.\n[be impertinent!]\nEh?!\nThe magic bullet that spreads from the palm bounces off Jaehyuk. It wasn't a fatal wound but it was enough to buy him time to retrieve the axe.\n[This fake...!]\nGrantusque glared at Gu Dae-seong who was about to swing the hammer at him. he didn't see that\nThe opponent is a great mage who enjoys the magic of conversational power and a veteran of reversals. A swordsman with two swords that even such monsters can take advantage of.\n[·······!?]\nCheon So-yeon a knight of vengeance melted into the darkness hiding behind Goo Dae-sung's huge presence. The magic sword blessed by Ventasis and the holy sword blessed by Ariana cross.\nHoly Demon Sword.\nHow many pages are there?\nAlong with the cynical voice of the girl the crossed swords aimed at the great devil's neck. Indeed the timing of an artistic surprise attack... However Grantusque reacted.\n[this guy···!]\n·······!?\nGrantusque immediately released the ax and swung his fist. Cheon So-yeon swings his sword non-stop but is ricocheted by his punches and misses the cutting edge.\n-Chack!\nA blood-splattering Grantusque. But not fatal.\n[You can't get past this place!]\nThe Great Devil caused his mana to run out of control. Now in this place he explodes his vessel his body and makes friends with them.\nAfter all this body is just a vessel. As long as you don't get hit by the Star Iron Sword or the Holy Law you can resurrect at any time.\nMiss Hari!\nWaves of runaway magic power. Goo Dae-seong who was hit by the waves all over his body and minimized the damage to his allies called a girl.\nBurn up!!\nThe heart of fire burns. At the same time all the water in the city formed a high wave.\n[Unbelievable—-]\nDo you still have the energy? Does that even produce holy power by itself?\nA huge wave of flame that could cover even the runaway magic of the Great Devil. It attacked Grantusk and it was...\nbreakthrough!!\nIt was the moment to break through the forces of evil that seemed endless.\n* * * *\n“I really broke through.”\nHow much did you catch on the way...\nDidn't you really catch 100000?\nThe knights who couldn't believe that they had accomplished incredible feats. It was the same with Gudaeseong.\nThat's...\nYou can see the Ryugyong Hotel standing tall in a place covered with an unknown dark fog. The world tree which had grown using the hotel as a graveyard was so huge that it seemed as if it would soon break through the clouds in the sky and go into space.\nIt sucked even the holy power of the Holy Grail Knights and the Burning Sword Knights and grew rapidly.\n[You must not touch that fog. It has the property of blocking divinity and followers.]\nIt was the advice of the goddess Demera. She had been nesting in Geobrick's hammer for a while before giving advice to Goo Dae-seong.\nThen... the ‘World Tree'?\n[Yeah but I guess I'll have to find a way around it.]\nThe breakthrough was successful but reaching the World Tree was a problem. That was when I was thinking about how to do it.\nLah Lord Raihar!\nSir Tarhan!\nIn the dark fog that the goddess had warned them not to reach they were slashing demons and leaping out.\n“Atrocities!”\n“cruelty!”\n“Cruel!”\nThey no longer fanned fire from their breath. However every time they swung their swords pieces of flesh and blood rose like flames.\n“Ruthless death...!!”\nBaltan Burning Sword Knights 50 people. In the midst of losing their holy power they dutifully pierced the waves of monsters with only their swords and will.\nHa haha... They're real monsters.\nAs they joined in bewilderment the burning sword knights saw Goo Dae-seong and immediately knelt down.\nReduce! Reduce again! New Demera's Holy Grail Knight!\nThey recognized at once that Goo Dae-sung had become a Holy Grail Knight.\nHey don't do this!\nGoo Dae-seong was frightened and raised them up. It was the Holy Grail Knights that I always looked up to with awe and respect.\nNo matter how much he became a Holy Grail Knight the example they had as Lionheart's original knights was burdensome.\nThe situation is urgent so let's postpone the celebration until later. We must hurry up and support His Majesty and the Holy Grail Knights.\nBut if you come into contact with that fog you will be cut off from the divinity. How are the Lords now?\nComing out of the fog they tried sparking again but still no spark came out of their hands.\nHmm I guess this will last for a while.\nThen... how do I get to the World Tree?\nTo the world tree?\nRaihar responded to Goo Dae-sung's words.\nYes Goddess Demera said the World Tree is the key to solving this predicament.\nHmm... is it just a matter of touching the world tree?\nOf course... it shouldn't even touch the fog.\nYou have to reach the world tree. But don't touch the fog. It was a difficult condition. If it were Vulcan how could he reach that place without reaching the mist?\n- Giggles!\nIt was then. It was the Kikkiruk warrior who stepped forward with a large claw. Originally it would have been translated through Yapi's translation device but with Rakshaar's roar all electronic devices were destroyed.\nBecause of that I couldn't understand Krashatria's unique voice but-\nThey are a wise ancient race. Through the stories of Goo Dae-seong and the knights as well as gestures and glances he recognized the purpose.\n-Kiruuk! look good? Squeaky look!\nHe himself brings a ‘something' with a desperate gesture to the point of being slightly cute.\nah.\noh.\n“Does it work?”\nThe intentions of the objects they brought were clear even at first glance.\n* * * *\nAs marine creatures most of the Krashatria naturally worshiped Poma the god of the sea and waves.\nThey were the most blessed beings in the sea and they could do many things in the sea that humans couldn't do but they don't necessarily serve the god Poma.\nThey are managed and commanded by Yacht Spinner the Holy Grail Knight of Iron and Blacksmith.\nTo adapt to the doctrines of the 21st century Earth and the Pantheon Yapi dedicated himself to enlightening the entire Krashatria tribe.\nIn addition to securing a comfortable home from small economic activities they also nurtured blacksmiths who believed in Heto the god of iron and blacksmith in metallurgical skills that only they could learn.\nThe ones made with them are many decisive battle weapons including the Dominator class.\nIt was a structure that Yapi had all the core skills and could not work without him but the skills learned over the shoulder did not disappear.\nWhen I saw Lord Vulcan flying around... I honestly thought it was a bit...\nIt's okay to say I look ignorant.\nGoo Dae-seong silently agreed to Hari’s words. But-\n“But I think this is more ignorant.”\n·······.\nHari silently pushed Koo Dae-sung into the ‘Pogu'. The armor is worn out and doesn't fit well.\n“Goo Dae-sung fighting!”\n·······.\nWith Jaehyuk and Suho cheering Goo Daesung silently watched the catch as he entered.\nDemons' hemp captured by the Kirkiruk tribe. Was the idea of ??putting people in there and shooting him possible because he was a Holy Grail Knight of Life?\n‘It's just that these aliens have some common sense...'\nThe Kikkiruk tribe who conceived this plan or the Burning Sword Knights who accepted it again and again.\nOkay let's start soon! I'm ready Koo Dae-seong!\nIt was ‘knights' not wheels or carts pulling the cannons that the Kikkiruks improvised by blacksmithing.\nBaltan Burning Sword Knights. They finished their preparations with the cannon on their shoulders that pushed Koo Dae-seong like a cannonball.\n-Kick! Kikkiroouk!\nWithout waiting for Koo Dae-sung's voice the Kikkiruk warriors shouted something. Their intentions even with flags were very clear.\n-talent!\n-talent!\n- Look!\n-Luwook!\n-Kick!\nThe flag is lowered the flag is lowered. that was the signal\nBaltan Burning Sword Knights! Turn around!\n·······!?\nA sudden rush of wind. Realizing that it was the aftermath of kicking off the seat and starting to run Goo Dae-sung clenched his teeth while holding the hammer in his arms.\n‘Pa fast!'\nHoly Grail Knights. Although they cannot use holy power they are superhumans who have reached the pinnacle of the human body.\nThey covered the ground at full speed with cannons on their backs and when they reached a certain point.\nJump!\nWith Lord Laihar's command a sense of floating came over me. waving muzzle. The sound of the wind can be heard even inside the cannon.\nThrow it!!\nThe Knights of the Burning Sword threw the cannon with all their might. Bang! The cannon was thrown with so much force that it could be heard.\nHow high did you jump? Slightly high in the dark misty front. The moment you see the Ryugyong Hotel──\n- I'll shoot!\nThe flames entered the muzzle with Hari's voice. Next moment bang! A sound came from the butt.\nAttetteuteu!!\nKoo Dae-seong being fired with cannonballs. He was distracted even in the rare experience of a naked human being flying in the sky.\nAaaaaaaaaaaa!!\n[Get your mind right baby!]\nGoo Dae-seong sees himself flying straight through the sky at the sound of the goddess Demera. The dark fog narrowly missed and the flight headed for the Ryugyong Hotel but...\nFloating or falling?!\nWas it lack of thrust? Goo Dae-sung realized that his body was falling in a parabola.\nGoddess forgive me!\nGoo Dae-seong immediately placed the earth shield he was holding under his feet. A fleeting sense of euphoria. He steps on the shield and leaps once again.\nThe superhuman jump in the air is very slight but the distance of the jump has been increased-\nDemerasi uh uh uh!!\nGoo Dae-seong put the holy power of life into Geobrick's hammer at full power.\nWhat he struck with the hammer containing holy power was——\n-Kooung!!\nIt was a world tree that grew from a seedling of Gunlar.\n[Now it's your turn.]\nThe voice of the goddess goes to the being sleeping in the tree. She is the guardian of Treemen and Elves. Together with Demera she is the one who creates the birth of life.\nGod of forests and trees.\n[Irmin.]\n* * * *\n[World Tree?!]\nEven Rakshaar was taken aback by the change in the World Tree.\nThe Lionheart was dying without recovering from his injuries and even Vulcanus Carina and Beatrice.\nTheir resistance which had lost their holy power had now come to an end.\nAfter everything is over now it will end if we reproduce the branch of destruction and lead the world to chaotic ruin...\n[Putting vinegar on ready-made rice...!]\nRakshaar hurriedly turned toward the world tree. It was more important for him to restore the World Tree immediately than to finish the Holy Grail Knights. But-\nWhere are you going?\nA shrill voice. The existence which must have been too small compared to Rakshaar revealed a presence that no evil could ignore.\n[You bastard...]\nIt must have been a fatal wound but the armor was completely destroyed——\n[how······.]\nRakshaar doubted his eyes but had no choice but to accept it.\nA polar light that shines brilliantly even in the dark. And the ‘armor' that glows black as if it had adapted to this darkness.\nGlory to Sir Yacht Spinner.\nLeon raised his sword with the greatest praise he could.",

It was the sound of hammering.\nThere are no workshops here.\nThere are no state-of-the-art facilities using technology from the future world nor railroads blessed by the gods and containing the energy of the stars.\nAll we have here is a blacksmith in disrepair and a crude hammer that barely mimics its shape.\n-Kang!\nBut why?\nWhy is it that the broken blacksmith strikes with a crude hammer?\n-Kang!\nCan you make such a beautiful sound?\n-Question the logic of operation. Warning of inefficient energy waste.\n- Final probability calculation success rate less than 0.03%.\nA number that is pessimistic but does not lie. The blacksmith more sober than anyone else knew that the warning was correct.\n- turn off the math logic function. Auxiliary system off.\nHowever it rejects the operation. do not accept\nFor a blacksmith a machine the most rational choice is always the one with the highest probability.\nEven if you do an action with a 0.06% chance of success with a small amount of remaining energy it is better than now.\nIt's more likely than the meaningless hammering you're doing now.\nunderstand it as a number. Yacht spinner a machine knows.\nbut.\n[Yapie you are the hero of the city.]\nThe last robot to protect the city during the end of the world.\n[Yapi I'm here. This is the last order.]\nThe last order of the commander who worried about the future until the very end.\n[Keep the seal don't let anyone get near it.]\nCarrying out meaningless orders in a world that has already been destroyed the blacksmith has endured for a thousand years.\nThey repaired obsolete parts and produced foundation stones and manufactured gunpowder to fill in insufficient armaments.\nProtecting the city for a thousand years must have been meaningless.\nUntil the man shows up.\n[A knight of loyalty and loyalty. It is because all living beings across dimensions owe a debt to your service.]\nThe man praised himself as greater than me.\nI respected him valued him and told him many times that he was great.\nbut he knows\nThat the man did not give up even in a more desperate situation than himself who had protected the city for a thousand years.\nCaracael the lord of wisdom and ten thousand demons. How meaningless is the act of resisting in front of the endless forces of evil.\nBut the man said.\n[I command you to fight to the end! Honorable Knights!]\nI will fight without giving in.\nIn that hopeless battle even though they knew they would be defeated Lionheart's knights and soldiers shouted.\n[Road Lionheart! Lord Lionheart!]\nEven if you won the victory alone in the end where no one was left.\nLion Heart King's victory is clearly not based on probability theory it's just ‘doing what I had to do'.\nI do it because I have to.\nIn addition the blacksmith saved it as ‘enlightenment' that probability is not important.\nSo do it.\nEven 0.03% is what we have to do so we do it.\nProbability was surprisingly unimportant.\n-Kick.\nCome to think of it he has always been like that.\nTo protect the city so as not to leak the malicious seal out of the world.\nIt has done it endlessly through meaningless repairs and regenerations.\n[Put your faith in iron. Imagine the future you will forge with hammering. The sword I made will cut through the enemies of the kingdom and the armor you made will protect my comrades.]\nimagination.\nWhat this mechanical blacksmith is like doesn't know.\nBecause he was a being who had calculated results through calculation not a being who imagined and created something vague.\nSo I just use the subjunctive method to derive the result.\n-Kang!\nThe result of the flawless Lionheart finally winning.\n* * * *\nLeon looked down at Yapi in his arms.\n······.\nYapi who poured all the power that moved him into hammering had already stopped functioning when Leon opened his eyes.\nLeon felt it as peaceful as a sleeping child.\n“You really are proud of Jim.”\nAs the King of Knights Leon was proud to have reaped this noble knight.\nBecause of this knight who finally carried out the great quest the current pantheon exists.\nand.\n[Leon my knight.]\nThere is also a resurrection now.\nHey Ariana.\n[The connection with my knight was lost and we were all worried. Are you okay?]\nThank you Spinner.\nLeon does not know what process this phenomenon is the result of. When I opened my eyes Yapi was stopped functioning and my armor was in a different shape than before so I can only guess.\nHetoshi. Do you know what English it is?\n[My blacksmith completed the unfinished armor. I breathed fire with a mechanical arm and polished it with an improvised hammer.]\nBut that alone doesn't account for the reconnection with divinity that was cut off.\n[The nature of the armor is to make it resistant to this dark fog. This child has prepared you with the armor that will enable you to win.]\nIn other words this completed armor itself is a protective suit that blocks the fog of darkness.\nI really am. I am a king who is blessed with many people.\n[What shall I do now?]\nTo the goddess' question Leon answered as if it were natural.\n“We will fight and win.”\nLeon decided to do what he had to do.\n[You bastard... how...]\nLeon put the evil in front of him.\nAn evil lord who was too gigantic for himself the size of a fire and a man.\nWhen many saw them they despaired. I was afraid and felt defeat.\nBut not Leon. He always raised his sword against the evils that plagued the world.\nGlory to the Holy Grail Knight Sir Yacht Spinner.\nAnd since he finally won this must be his destiny.\n[Lionheart. I don't know how they reconnected the divinity...]\nRakshaar's tentacles thrash on the ground. It toppled the city's buildings and caused an earthquake on the ground.\nRakshaar's claws clap menacingly. Its pincers are powerful enough to cut through the sky.\n[All of your knights fell to me. You just got a new toy.]\nYou pitiful evil. Do you understand the weight of life that the original king carried?\nLeon's holy sword shines brightly. In the fog of darkness that blocks divinity the sword shines brightly.\nI am Leon Dragonia and Lionheart. I am the end of evil.\nLeon jumped in. Rakshaar responded immediately.\nHundreds of swaying bridges. It is swung sharply as if there are no obstacles such as buildings and buildings.\n-thud!\nLegs that hit Leon who jumped in with a dizzying sound. Leon's body gnaws at the ground and bounces off.\n[Leonah...!]\nRakshaar. The great demons of the chaos series are especially proud of their enormous size.\nRakshaar is the pinnacle. He was mighty even when he was a demon archduke but after becoming a monarch he literally became an evil that ate the world alone.\nIts power is too great for a single person to deal with.\ncome.\nDivine Punishment < Sun Appearance >\nsun. It is the greatest attack-type spell among the powers of the Holy Law. The power of the sun illuminating the planet is the purest destructive force.\n[Laughing! With the power that just increased the scale!]\nsun beating down. Rakshaar hits it back with his bare body.\nEven though his entire body would melt just by the heat from the sun Rakshaar rather pushed him away with a frontal power struggle.\nThe lord of chaos his enormous magic power is so fierce that it can even push away the heat of the sun with the attribute of judgment.\n[You can't defeat me alone.]\nholding the sun with claws It reminded me of a giant holding up a planet in mythology. What makes Rakshar different from him is that Rakshar has no obligation to honor the planet.\nThe sun which was swept away at once declares the city of Pyongyang doomed. It incinerated buildings and buildings where no one lived as soon as they touched them and dug deep into the ground.\nThe next turn was a bombardment created by Rakshaar's enormous magic power. When the mana that struck the sun from the front was replaced by magic the scale was too harsh for a single individual.\nEach one is a great magic. Hundreds of them. The bombardment of the devil created as natural as breathing pours toward Leon.\n[Here I will offer you 3 million live sacrifices! Please hear my request!!]\nAfter the Emperor of the Empire summoned the Lord of Chaos by sacrificing his people as living sacrifices Leon had to witness his kingdom's people perish to endless malice.\nAn incident in which Seonggun who was satisfied with staying in the kingdom became angry even with the same human beings. Regret that I should have torn the old emperor to pieces earlier.\nThe power of iron.\nIt blocks the magical bombardment by consolidating iron powder that rises from the depths of the earth. The pure iron curtain was penetrated and Lionheart was nowhere to be seen.\n[·······!?]\nRakshaar who was looking for the missing Leon suddenly saw a white feather fluttering in the air.\nLet's go Stallion!\n- Cao oh!\nThe roar of a ferocious beast. However the divine beast of light spread its wings while scattering brilliant beauty.\n* * * *\nGoo Dae-seong watched the fight between Leon and Rakshaar hanging from the world tree.\namazing······.\nAlthough he has awakened as a Holy Grail Knight Leon's fight is of a different class.\nThat is the one who encompasses the power of all gods.\nA giant of the era who stood at the pinnacle of mankind.\n‘Lion Heart King.'\nGuardian of the Holy Grail.\nBut... you're being pushed back.\nI could tell because it was Koo Dae-sung who had reached the level of a superman.\nThe head-to-head confrontation between the Lord of Chaos and the Lion Heart King. Although they are competing closely with each other Leon's power has not completely returned.\nThat new armor is clearly reconnecting the blocked divinity but the moment Leon's holy power is manifested the power gradually diminishes.\nSacrifice created by sacrificing the five great devils and the great devil weakens it as soon as the holy power touches it.\n[Baby you have to help.]\nYes... but the method is...\nUnlike Leon Goo Dae-seong cannot avoid being blocked from the divine immediately upon touching the dark fog.\n[Ask her how to do that.]\nIt was when Goo Dae-sung nodded at Demera’s words. Something slid out of the shell of the world tree to which he hung.\n‘government ordinance?'\nKoo Dae-sung thought based on the meager fantasy knowledge he had in mind.\nA winged spirit with a beautiful appearance. The one whom Demera called her approached her Gudaesung and said\n[The knight of life that gave me birth. I need your help.]\nName anything.\nGoo Dae-sung's innocent attitude made the woman smile.\n[I am Irmin of the forest and trees. Creator of fairies and twin goddesses of Demera. She bears the seed of a species and is a self-sealed god.]\nLike the Last Holy Grail it is an ark plan in preparation for the destruction of the world.\nA god prepared for the prosperity of all species in the world in preparation for the future when Lionheart and his army win.\n[Give me your life force. Then I will show you the miracle of birth.]\nGoo Dae-sung felt intuition that he had encountered a great moment he had never thought of.\nLionheart's Resurrection. I shuddered at the fact that the miracle that would bring that glorious era back to life was in my hands.\nAs you wish...!\nWith Goo Daesung's consent Irmin smiled and manipulated the world tree.\nA stratum where the fog of darkness descends. The roots of that place moved and embraced something and brought it to the place where Koo Dae-sung is.\nGoo Dae-seong widened his eyes when he saw the woman who had been cherished by the roots.\nHis Excellency Karina!\nA black-haired grand duke. Goo Dae-seong who was handed the girl of her roots was embarrassed and did not know what to do.\nKeep...\n“Dae Grand Duke are you okay?”\nAre you...?\nWhile Karina passed out after being beaten by Rakshaar she wondered at the strange man holding her in his arms.\n“That... the knight is Daesung Koo.”\nIt doesn't seem like a simple article...\nKarina was surprised by the infinite vitality she felt in Goo Dae-seong. In this era there was a talented person on Earth who could sublimate into a Holy Grail Knight.\n[Karina. Daughter of Leon Dragonia. Ulfric's granddaughter.]\nIrmin?\n[I need the arguments you have.]\nAt Irmin's words Karina understood at once what that meant.\nI see. Is that how it happened?\nKarina looked straight at Goo Dae-sung. Faced with her strong and chauvinistic gaze Goo Dae-seong swallowed his saliva and lowered his gaze.\nIt was like Beta's behavior of instinctively bowing down to the alpha of the pack of beasts in the wild world but Karina seems to have accepted it very differently.\nThe rookie is lacking in numbers.\nThat that's not it...\nIt's done. The situation is urgent so hurry up and bring your face. Look straight at the original work.\nYes? Yes?!\nKarina grabbed Goo Dae-sung's chin and forced him to look straight ahead. She then slowly brings her face closer.\n‘Ser no way!?'\nGoo Daesung closed his eyes tightly. However the unexpected situation did not come and a strange sensation of forehead to forehead was transmitted.\nHuh?\nIt's not what I was expecting but Koo Dae-sung makes a complex and subtle expression. Seeing him like that Karina smiled.\nWhat are you expecting?\nIt's not like that!\nCarina thought that the bashful Daesung's reddish expression was cute and flicked the bridge of his nose with her fingers.\nA man who met a beautiful woman like in the original work should do that but now it's an important phase. Focus.\nAh yes...\nSomething... Thinking that someone with a strong self-consciousness resembles him Goo Dae-sung pressed their foreheads together as Karina told him to do.\nFeel the factor of this work. Breathe into it the vitality of the Lord and sprout it through the World Tree.\nGoo Dae-sung felt something being transmitted through his foreheads and instinctively began to breathe life into them.\n[It was. It contains enough life force.]\nIrmin accepted it. The world tree soon sprouted a seed that added Karina's factor and Goo Dae-sung's vitality—\n[It's time to fulfill the contract! I'll pour out all the holy power I've gathered. give birth to my first offspring]\nDragonia the golden god poured out the holy power she had accumulated so far.\nSo that the first offspring to be born on this earth are grander and nobler than any other living being.\nThe seed sprouted soon and the first life born from the World Tree. Its vast roar echoes.\n-That's la la la la la la la la la!!\nThe first offspring of Dragon God Dragonia.\nA huge black dragon spread its wings.",

      "content": "Lion Heart (2)\n< Sky Spear >\nClouds gather. The cloud giant wearing a thunder-entwined crown raised its arms high.\nEndure this too evil species.\nThe spear that strikes down is the spear of stroke in which the stronghold of thunder is concentrated. It is impossible to avoid or block. Facing the all-piercing spear of the sky——\n[You look at me funny.]\nDestructive magic compression formation.\nA black beam strikes the spear that was dropped vertically by the Giant of Thundercrown.\nLeon clicked his tongue.\n‘The spear of the sky is a pure thunderbolt. To block it with physical force.'\nThat beam isn't just a bombardment of energy. The magic of the Lord of Wisdom who caused all sorts of great disasters was strong enough to attract the stars but he did not break the law.\nLeon remembered that each demon's magical power had a different nature and guessed that Rakshaar's magical power was unpredictable and chaotic.\nMalus also caused a bizarre anomaly that distorted even time and space.\nHowever Leon's vocal method also distorts the law.\nConcepts and the forces of chaos overshadowed any defense and wounded the world in the aftermath of the conflict.\n- Blood damage!\n-What's going on!\n[Leon! You can't fight against each other with only strength!]\nThunder god Ultima made a rare weak sound. But Leon knew he was right.\nStalion evade!\nShin-soo complies with Maeng-wu’s request. The heavenly horse with wings made dizzying maneuvers dodging tentacles claws and magical bombardment from all directions.\nIt reminded me of the first battle with Rakshaar at Donghae Gate the other day. But if there is a difference from then——\n[I'll show you that there's no point in avoiding this greatest power!]\nMagic is concentrated in Rakshaar's mouth. Its power is a roaring bombardment that I have witnessed many times. A giant cannon worthy of a super-giant demon is fired.\nAvoid!\nLeon took the reins. Stallion hurriedly folded his wings and performed an extreme vertical maneuver and Rakshaar's bombardment brushed the place where they had just been.\n-Tooquaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nThe cannonball rips through the city and through the atmosphere of the planet on the horizon.\nTo the extent that living organisms around the world feel the rise in the temperature of the earth's atmosphere with their skin.\nHalf of the people on Earth saw the remnants of the bombardment that extended into space.\nSuch an unbelievable artillery bombardment. No matter how much it brushed against it it was not enough firepower for a single individual to withstand.\n- Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!!\n[·······!?]\nRakshaar saw the bulls land on the ground.\nA fire-breathing bull.\nBeasts of war that Petos the god of war and flame presented to the greatest war rider.\nLet's go bulls of war!\n- Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!!\nThe wild beasts that have been on the battlefield with Leon for as long as Stallion have spewed fire and run. Rakshaar's gaze pours destruction energy toward him again.\nHowever Leon also adapted to his power.\nMother of light. My goddess.\nA huge ray of destruction beating down on them. Another light against that ‘light'.\n[·······!?]\nIts own beam cannot melt him. Aside from being distorted refracted and deflected by the light of the Lionheart it is not something that a single entity can survive with only the aftermath.\n- Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!!\nfire-breathing bull. Just like that a little while ago. No matter how fast Stallion's reverse summoning and bulls' resummoning were there would have been enough damage to ‘pass by'.\n‘The power to absorb and neutralize heat. Is it the power possessed by divine beasts of flame!'\nA war wagon led by divine beasts. It was the divine beasts and chariots given by the god of flame. Heat cannot hurt the Lion Heart King.\n‘You monster. My strength as a monarch... is terrifying as expected. That is the horror of evil the pinnacle of humanity.'\nA very incomprehensible existence that could do such things with the power of a single person without an army or weapons.\nI think I know why even the great devils are afraid and shudder at meeting him.\n[That's why you must disappear. Your existence will be the weight that holds us down.]\nThat would be his duty as an evil lord. I can't imagine two monsters like this would appear in the last millennium.\nAs expected in the midst of a long crisis they are—\n───────■■■■■■■■!!\nRakshaar cut off a few strands of his tentacles. It turns into black ink and spills onto the floor and the Servants of Chaos stand up.\n-Smaker uh uh!\nFire-breathing bulls collide with monsters in front.\nThe road to Rakshaar was blocked by countless servants of evil regardless of whether they were small medium or large but were mercilessly crushed in front of the war wagon driven by the 【Strongest Assaulter】.\n[However in the end you are alone. I am the culmination of all evil and the concentration of chaos.]\nDrip tentacles. The bulls breaking through countless monsters moved around to avoid the bombardment of the tentacles.\nHowever the speed of the bulls is noticeably slower than that of Stallion. Leon had a hunch that the bulls would not be able to escape Rakshaar's attack.\ngood.\nLeon cut the seams of the war wagon himself. The bulls leave the war wagon and spread in both directions and Leon is naturally isolated in the middle of the monster herd.\n[It's over Lionheart!]\nThe light of extinction is focused. Direct hit this time. With that amazing armor and God's authority he survived even in the blast range but it probably won't be enough to withstand a direct hit.\nIf it were the flawless Lion Heart King in his heyday who defeated Karakael he is far from worthy of being a monarch.\nTime dragged on. As much as you enjoyed the glory of your first birth go wild lizard.\n[·······?!]\nRakshaar noticed the eerie aura behind his back.\nThere is something called Pressure that all living things are overwhelmed by.\nThe fearsome divinity of the Lion Heart King.\nThe evil malice of demon lords.\nIn front of the gigantic ranks of divinity and malignity creatures with inferior ranks do not dare to raise their heads.\nbut only one. There is an existence that waged an equal fight without being pushed back even by divinity and evil.\n-That's la la la la la la la!!\nIt spreads its wings with a huge roar. Rakshaar's eyes were stained with doubt.\n[Polypt...!]\nDragon. Mythical strongest being. An existence in history that did not succumb even to the gods was born from the heart of an ancient dragon and the world tree.\nHuh what happened?\nCarina who rode on the back of the dragon with Goo Dae-sung immediately gave instructions.\nAttack with maximum firepower. Use breath.\n[Don't give orders human! be impertinent!]\nA dragon with innate violence and rebellious temperament could indeed be said to be the first descendant of Dragonia.\nBut he also made the best judgment in this situation. Although he is sensitive he made the same judgment as a human being.\n-Kaoooooo!!\nAn aura rising through the body. That power was added not only to the silk dragon but also to the enormous magic power provided by Karina's dragon's heart.\nRakshaar frowned when he saw the breath coming down immediately.\n[Something like hetzling!]\nRakshaar directed the light of persecution he was trying to strike at Leon directly at the dragon. In the next moment two great forces shoot at each other.\n-Quaaaaaaaaa!\nThe first offspring of Dragon King Dragonia the mightiest ancient dragon who made a deal with the gods. Until he backs up Dragon Sovereign Carina Dragonia.\nThe pouring black flames collide with the light of the black ray. In the center where huge heat collides everyone except for the two lifeforms outside the standard is burned to death.\n-Kieheek!\nNumerous evil species that Rakshaar sowed cannot withstand and turn to ashes and disappear. It is not the firepower that a small species can withstand. Excluding out-of-specification beings.\n······ I'm going to be pushed.\nAs soon as the words were finished the light of death pushed away the black flame.\n[·······!?]\nThe light of extinction which began to be pushed once rushed straight toward the black dragon. It narrowly passed the dragon's head but inflicted a great wound on the dragon.\n[You bastard...! Dirty thing!]\nConcentrate on flying baby lizard. If you fall and touch that darkness you will die.\n[······!!]\nThe wounded dragon's wrath was directed at its rider. But he knew that part of the energy that made up him was divinity and instinctively knew that coming into contact with that dark mist was dangerous.\nEven in the shaking caused by the shock the black dragon managed to maintain its altitude by flapping its wings. However Rakshaar's attack did not end there.\n[I won't let you run away!]\nRakshaar's tentacles grabbed the dragon's torso. Then he drags it in front of me and tries to cut it with his claws.\n[Where are you touching dirty things!]\nAgainst this the black dragon also stopped and grabbed Rakshaar's claws with its sharp claws. At the same time the teeth bite off the tentacles trying to strike them.\nTruly a monster battle. However it was the black dragon who was pushed behind in terms of weight or magic power.\n‘Being annoying...!'\nRakshaar realized that the black dragon desperately holding on to its claws could not stand on its own.\nAbove the black dragon. Its rider Karina is also channeling her immense magical energy through her heart but she notices that the dragon's body which must have been badly injured is constantly ‘regenerating'.\n“If you don’t die...”\nSeongbeop < Infinite Life >\nGoo Dae-sung was sending more vitality than the basic passive regeneration possessed by the Holy Grail Knight of Life and Abundance.\n[This one-day puppy!]\nRakshaar continued to pull down the tentacles holding the black dragon's ankles. He is still a hatchling no matter how much he is a dragon born from the factor of an ancient dragon. The difference in strength that comes from the difference in weight class cannot be overcome.\nJust like that bit by bit the dragon's body was about to be engulfed by the mist——\nI am Vulcanus!!\nThe man showed himself at the moment of desperation.\n[·······?!]\nRakshaar's gaze instantly turned to the source of the loud voice.\nThe monster who should have been completely neutralized is riding on the back of a fire-breathing bull and running over its tentacles.\nRegardless of what kind of art it was when Rakshaar swung his tentacles away to shake off the bull Vulcan leaped atop the bull.\nFire well borrowed!\n- Mmmmmmmmmmm!!\nJumping up with transcendent leg strength Vulcanus soared high enough to escape from the dark fog.\nIn his armor the fire he had lost while being cut off from the divine was burning fiercely borrowing the flame of a fire-breathing bull.\nHe is treated as an abandoned child but he is a saint of flames. Taking the fire-breathing bull's power as one's own is as natural as breathing.\nDuck...! Lose!\nVulcanus embracing the flame threw down the holy sword. The holy swords that were fired along with the blasting star that even exploded the air rushed aiming for Rakshaar's head.\nRakshaar used the greatest protection magic to block the throwing of the holy sword.\n- Kwak-kwa-kwa-kwak!\nA protective magic circle that collapses like a glass window. The holy sword throwing which combines the monstrous power of a monster named Vulcanus and the flame method is more like a bombardment than a throwing one.\nHowever the throwing sword of this tremendous destructive power stopped right in front of Rakshaar's nose.\n[It was close monkey.]\nThere's still one sack left!\n[·······?!!]\nRight before the fall Vulcanus throws the remaining one with all his might.\n- Kwajik!\n-Kwakkwak!\nThe dangerous magic circle is broken by the second throw. However Vulcan's holy sword only grazed Rakshaar's skull.\n“Damn it it’s a waste——!?”\nThe swinging tentacle strikes Vulcanus. Boom! With a roar the building he crashed into collapsed.\n‘If only the troublesome dragon is drawn into the mist——!'\nIt was then. A pillar of light suddenly rises from the dark fog. Rakshaar was startled by the divine light that penetrated the sky.\n[How——!?]\nRakshaar looked at Leon and saw that he was not alone.\nMagician Queen Beatrice.\nShe was with the Lionheart along with the fire-breathing bull.\nTsushima < SUPER INVOCATION CANCEL >\nInterpreting and disassembling demons is the skill of a mage.

Everyone wonders if the world is really going to end.\nIn the midst of such fear everyone had no choice but to pray to their respective gods and they remembered one person.\nHe is narrow-minded authoritarian arrogant and arrogant. A prophet who brought a new faith to this world.\nA person who has changed the standard of faith that had no choice but to pray vaguely proved the existence of a real God and represents that power.\nA superman who leads people to the stars on a line that ordinary people can't even imagine.\nThat's why they prayed while thinking of an article with the gods.\nplease let him win\n────■■■■■■■■■■■■■!!\nBrilliant light embroiders the sky as if in answer to prayer.

You monsters! You monsters!!\nSwearing close to screaming harassed those with a lower level of existence but Reynald prioritized instinctive survival first.\nOh what can I do great being!\nReynald desperately sought wisdom from Gob the Great Demon of Wisdom who was screaming in front of him.\nWhat is it! You have to jump out!\nah···!\nRakshaar Lord of Chaos has been defeated. The followers of chaos ruled by Rakshaar have collapsed and all that remains is the demons dispatched to aid in this war.\nThey'll find out about this place soon! Get out of here before they come!\nCrab can't you open the gate? Ma take us to the Demon Realm...\nYou idiot!\nThe gate from the demon world to the earth requires a lot of sacrifices and magic but on the other hand if you go to the demon world it won't be impossible for him who is the great devil of wisdom.\nHowever Raynald's hopes were shattered by Gove's scolding.\nIf you open the gate to the Pandemonium here you'll be tracked down by that witch queen! Do you think they won't come to the Pandemonium?\niced coffee······.\nIn other words the only answer here is physical escape.\nRight away!\n“Ah old! Shredding the paperwork——”\nThere's no time for that! Where Lionheart is the priority is to run away at the fastest speed!\nYes? Ha but...\nReynald's relationship with the warlocks who were dispatched here and himself the owner of the American Mage Tower. And he knew the importance of this place which contained sensitive information such as a list of support for devil followers who were secretly working around the world.\nIf the information here is disclosed comrades who are working secretly around the world are also in danger.\nAt least fire...!\nIf those bastards see it after setting it on fire?! It just jumps out unconditionally!\nNo countermeasures no follow-up just unconditional escape. Is this the devil of wisdom?\nHowever Reynald who was only a follower who had not even turned into a demon yet could not refuse the command of the Archdemon Gob.\nWith the remaining demons in the facility he recklessly packs his things and runs away.\nThere are those who jump without hesitation with Gob in the wonder of the demon followers who want to run away in such a hurry.\nThey are demons.\nRun away! They're coming soon!\nWhere are the great devils?! Have they all been harmed?\nI heard that there is a great devil of wisdom!\nReynald glanced at Gob but Gob ignored him wearing a robe.\nAre you great?\nDon't talk to me Sivat.\nGob who was supposed to lead them at a time when most of the great demons had been defeated and the chain of command collapsed didn't seem to have any intention of doing that.\nGob walked quietly down the hallway even using an artifact to hide his presence while he and Reynald mingled with the busy crowd and found a way to escape.\n-thud!\nWhat what!\nWhat just happened!?\nA roar as if a sudden earthquake had occurred. But everyone knew that it was by no means a natural phenomenon.\n‘Wow come! So fast?!'\nFucking fanatics. How long has it been since the battle with the lord and have you already started hunting the remnants?\nNaughty bastards!\nAwesome bastards!\n-thud! thud! thud!\nA series of roars and screams from the other side of the hallway which seemed to squeak because of the recent collision.\nEveryone knew there was something. But nobody moved.\nI can't even breathe let alone escape. Intuition that even the slightest breath would be captured. And the obvious fact that the moment you are caught you will die first.\nchewing gum.\nThe lights in the hallway flicker on and off.\nEveryone in this place was silent as if they had lost their voices to the extent that the electric lights rang loudly.\nlike that.\nmaybe 5 seconds. In my opinion 5 minutes.\nA muffled breathing is heard in the midst of extreme tension.\n-Hoo-wook!\nWoo-wook doing it.\nHow could it be so loud even if it was just normal breathing?\nReynald felt the cold sweat running down his neck itching but he didn't even think to wipe it off.\nEveryone did.\nAnd the reason the owner of that breath appeared was——\nIt was the moment when the pure white holy sword itself lit up.\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nIt was a voice close to rage. The demon with the gun pulled the trigger and fired magic bullets.\nHowever the knight with the sword deflected the bullets by swinging the sword lightly as if laughing.\nIt became a signal.\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nfight\nBut it wasn't a struggle.\nIt was screaming and screaming.\nWhether it was bullets blades or magic they threw everything they could.\nLiving an immortal life they accumulate endless magical powers through long-term invasions and infinite amusements. All they do is span hundreds to thousands of years.\nHowever they themselves do not believe in those who risk their lives and pour them out.\nEven though they know that this is a meaningless struggle they cannot stop screaming and face the approaching extinction.\n- Kwaaak!\nThey are cut their necks are grabbed and broken and they are burned to death by the flames extending from their fingertips.\nOh no!\nSave me!\nThey resisted to live one more second in front of the knight who embodies the death of evil.\nAhhh······.\nReynald couldn't help but look at it.\nlevel of existence.\nThe difference between humans and demons.\nHe was the one who succumbed in front of that vast gap.\nHowever the existence in front of my eyes the knight the lion heart king... an existence that far surpassed the difference in rank.\nIn front of the Shinigami who had grown incomparably stronger than when he almost met at the Gate of the Magician Queen the other day Raynald felt his own death.\nFall off stupid thing!\nThen wow! and a savage hand pulling Raynald away. When he realized it was the power of a stocky demon his magic struck the ceiling and brought it down.\n-Quarreung!\ncollapsed ceiling. Raynald exclaimed in amazement.\nUp great one!\nIt was an amazing survival instinct to be able to move even in the face of this catastrophic death. Gob didn't stop there.\nYou guys! Block that place!\nyes?\n“What are you doing?”\nA dazed demon and its followers who don't know what's going on inside. While they stared at the collapsed ceiling Gob led Raynald and ran to save his life.\n- Kwaaang!\n- What what!\n- Aaaaagh!\nScreams were heard but the two never looked back.\nHoping they'll lose themselves while hunting the others.\nGo Gob-sama are you here!\nThe place where Gansin arrived was the Daedonggang River basin that led to the sewer. There a goblin demon was waiting for them.\nChu let's go! Hurry up!\nAh yep!\nThe goblin demon quickly boarded a small submarine hidden in the river. Of course Gob jumps down without hesitation and throws himself into the submarine.\nUp great one what the hell is this?\nAlthough he accidentally boarded the submarine Raynald looked up and asked what kind of submarine it was.\nOne of the eleven escape routes in case the Lord of Chaos is defeated! We ride this and fall into the sea!\nAhhh······.\nArchdemon of great wisdom. How far can you look...\nwise man.\nRaynald swore to follow him to the end.\n-Quaaaaaaa!!\nJust a few seconds after they dived into the Daedonggang River divine flames erupted that incinerated the secret base.\nI survived today!\nIt was winter.\n* * * *\nThe Lord of Chaos has disappeared.\nThe demons who witnessed all of this could not hide their miserable feelings.\nDamn Lionheart...\nThe annihilation of the Lord of Chaos and his legions. More than ten of the Prime Evils died.\nThe greatest damage ever since the great war that began 200 years ago.\nAmong the demons of the demon realm which boast a long history there is a uniquely old existence.\nGreat Old One.\nThey could be said to represent the history of demons having survived the long history of struggle in which even the same demons betrayed and cheated each other.\nThat's why I'm against it. To kill him but to use the Old Ones in great history like Rakshaar as consumable war weapons.\n“Was there an alternative? Rakshaar agreed to this national judgment.”\nDemons suffered fatal damage two hundred years ago.\nStarting with Malus the lord of chaos Karakael the lord of wisdom and Dotradon the lord of pleasure fell at the hands of the Lionheart.\nIt's not just them. Even after destroying the empire in just a few days he had to endure decades of wars of attrition because he could not destroy the smaller Lion Heart.\nHe knocked down countless Holy Grail Knights and annihilated all members of the world except for Lionheart but he was unable to win.\nHow many other great demons died in the meantime? Prime demons of all factions suffered damage that could not be repaired for thousands of years to come.\nIn order to recover the damage the invasion of another dimension was accelerated... but everything was disturbed when the one who could not be killed returned to Earth.\nWe should have saved up our strength for victory in the millennium. We should have given up on Earth without ignoring our wisdom.\nGreat Old Ones of Wisdom and Search. Having faced the Lion Heart King himself Chi shuddered as if trembling.\n“Are you giving up on Earth-level attacks like this?”\nAn Old One of Wisdom who shook his head at the opinion of an Old One.\nThey learned the Gate technique. The Queen who was a candidate for the Lord of Pleasure and Corruption also collected the coordinates of the Pandemonium. If given time she will grow stronger and come here.\n“······.”\nThe Old Ones shuddered as they remembered the day Lionheart would visit the Pandemonium himself.\nDidn't he already devastated the territory of the Grand Duke of Slaughter and came to the Glacier Continent to find Vulcanus?\nThe Pandemonium is not a simple physical dimension like a planet but if you learn the coordinates one by one it is not difficult to move over to the subspace movement technology called the gate.\nNow we have to choose.\nShould I save my strength and hide in the back roads of the dimension for a rematch?\n“Did you hold hands with the beasts?”\nDid you ask for help from a more powerful monster?\nSince the last monarch who created all the resources is dead I wonder if there is a choice.\nSingularity in two dimensions.\nEnemy that has constantly evolved by killing each other.\nOnly the ‘beasts of that dimension' are bizarrely powerful.\n* * * *\nEventually it's open but it's open.\nDo you see it?\nThe old beast stared at the far-off universe that its owner looked up at.\nExactly ‘fake universe'. Those who were afraid of them drove them into this place and tried to tie them up by sealing the dimension.\nIn my opinion it seems that natural extinction was expected in this polar region...\n‘We survived in this extreme land and you guys failed.'\nthey are survivors. Warriors who make even the endless struggle a game.\nThe reason why ferocious fighters who would normally wield axes against each other were torn to pieces here and did not self-destruct in a civil war is because the great Khan of absolute charisma exists.\nShould I kill them all?\nThe sage of the great beasts revealed his master's intentions with wild words that did not deviate from his birth.\nTheir lord was fine. Now even dealing with the ‘fourth' would be boring.\nThe only thing worth fighting for was the strongest of the monarchs the Lord of Destruction. After that guy even the same level as the monarch was insignificant.\nAnd it was determined by this contact that they also had no energy.\nThe one who crushed the skull last was the lord of lust.\nBefore that I heard the news that the snakehead that did something wisdom had died so I didn't know if there would be a remaining monarch.\nAnd if there is no one stronger than the lord even demons are insignificant to him.\nLet's hear where and how much they offer.\nA speculation that seems to be raised from the depths of the abyss. A tyrannical aura that would make even the champions of fighting spirit and shamanic gods fear.\nThis is the champion among champions chosen by all the ‘orc gods'.\nThe Great Khan will do as he wishes.\nOrc Great Khan Murka.\nThe champion of the Orc Gods who destroyed the lords of slaughter indolence and lust and tore apart dozens of great demons with his own hands.\nA great fighter and cunning one.\nHe looked at the unsealed dimension and smiled ferociously.",

      "content": "post-processing\nIt's a historic moment.\nAgainst the background of the ruins of Pyongyang President Andong-gil stood on the podium.\n80 years ago since the national tragedy began—\nEven as President Andong-gil recited his prepared speech his heart was filled with excitement.\nAnd Dong-gil the first president of North-South reunification!\nHow good is this sound?\nPresident Ahn became the president who achieved the long-cherished desire of the nation the reunification of the two Koreas.\nThere were many sacrifices.\nDuring the war hundreds of thousands of North Korean soldiers including 3 million citizens of Pyongyang turned into monsters and perished.\nWe must not forget their sacrifice. Having finally achieved unification after a long history of division we are on the road to reconciliation—\nIt was a problem from now on. The problem of assimilation of North Korean people and regional stabilization. Above all we need to recover from the annihilated satellite.\nBut don't worry. We are the people who achieved the Miracle on the Han River and we have eternal friends by our side.\nWell the pantheon will do everything.\nThe protagonists of this war! Introducing our eternal companions who will continue to be with our unified Korea!\nPresident Ahn thought it was fortunate that there was a pantheon.\n* * * *\nGood work on your speech President Ahn.\nHa ha just thank you for coming to the podium.\nThe speech declaring a unified Korea was held in occupied Pyongyang under the strong will of President Ahn.\nNo matter how much Pyongyang was occupied with communism the proclamation of a unified Korea in Pyongyang where remnants of demons may remain is dangerous.\nThe Presidential Security Service asked not only its own security personnel but also the Pantheon Shrine to join them and treated them as the protagonists of this proclamation ceremony.\nThere are Lion Heart King and knights but who can harm the president?\nBy the way President Ahn. What are you planning to do next?\nAt Leon's question President Ahn let out a light sigh and recalled the problems he was facing.\nIt was necessary to wipe out and absorb the remaining remnants of the North Korean army and it was necessary to dispatch South Korean troops to each region to occupy actual territories.\nAlthough the post-processing was easy thanks to the Baekdu lineage of the North Korean Kim family and high-ranking officials there are still several forces that have not accepted the fall of the republic.\nSpecifically the warlords who watched the situation with bated breath as the devil took over North Korea.\n‘The resistance forces who fought against the demons are on the better side but they're not on our side.'\nPartisans were still active in Hamgyeong-do and they would act as a nuisance to the Armed Forces for a while.\nFirst of all the appeasement of the remaining people in North Korea must be accomplished. The reason why the declaration of unification was brought forward today was also to show them the reality.\nI see there's no point in resisting anymore so you're telling me to hurry up and find the light.\nTo put it bluntly it is. Anyway they will also become Korean citizens now.\nPresident Ahn quietly suggested the most important thing to Leon.\nYour Majesty and the Mansinjeon can be of great help to our nation's long-cherished business.\nI guess so.\nLeon understood President Ahn's intentions. After unification the biggest problem is the absorption of North Koreans and the stabilization of the new territory.\nThe immediate problems are food and security.\nYes of course our government will do everything possible...\nDon't worry President Ahn. I will do my best to help.\nyour majesty···!\nPresident Ahn had a bright face as if he was thrilled. But he knows too.\nIn the story of kings and kings there is never a free exchange.\nIf something is received from this side giving something back is also the basis of political dynamics. Lionheart-style court politics is more dignified but fundamentally it is not much different from modern politics.\nWe will actively support the missionary work of the Mansinjeon in the occupied territory.\nHuh wasn't the government supposed to maintain religious neutrality?\nIf you put Goddess Demera's doctrine or Ariana's doctrine first you can crush them moderately. Security education and food self-rescue measures are important.\nSouth Korea is a wealthy country but that doesn't mean it can feed over 20 million poor North Koreans for free.\nBy applying the doctrine of Goddess Demera each region can produce its own food and if terrible malnutrition and chronic diseases are cured even medical problems can be solved.\nAbove all if we teach them well the principles of Ariana the goddess of light and justice we will be able to greatly reduce future conflicts between North and South Koreans.\nI don't mean to say that North Koreans are evil beings from birth but the more backward the country the poorer the education environment the more general morality is lacking in many cases.\nAren't the majority of North Koreans living on a North Korean drug called ‘Bingdu' right now? Only when this is resolved will future exchanges be smooth.\n“There is one more thing. This will require a somewhat bold decision for President Ahn.”\nWhat is that...?\nGive Pyongyang to Jim.\nGive up Pyongyang. At that even President Ahn was at a loss for words.\nEven though it is an empty city where 3 million Pyongyang citizens and leaders were massacred the meaning of Pyongyang in North Korea is great.\nFor the past 80 years North Korea has developed only Pyongyang and its neighboring cities amid poor economic power and all facilities and infrastructure were concentrated in Pyongyang.\nThe reason President Ahn dared to come all the way to Pyongyang to hold the proclamation of a unified Korea is because this is such a symbolic city.\nI can't believe it...\nAre you planning on establishing your own kingdom here? At President Ahn’s gaze Leon smiled and shook his head.\nI recognize the legitimate territory of the Republic of Korea. I have no intention of usurping the territory of a sovereign country.\nThe reason Leon asked for Pyongyang to be handed over was surprisingly simple.\nThe world tree has been planted here. As long as the goddess of forests and trees dwells there I must take care of this place and assist her in her work.\nAh the world tree...\nPresident Ahn looked at the World Tree which was the background of the unification proclamation ceremony just before.\nThe world tree that grew tall on behalf of the Ryugyong Hotel was as tall as the universe.\nAnd it's still growing to the point where I'm wondering if humanity develops an orbital elevator and it won't grow to that size.\nIn the past when I committed a mortal sin to serve the Moon Goddess I moved the cornerstone of the temple to the moon by climbing up and down the World Tree. Irmin personally spread the branches to the moon for me.\nDid you reach the moon?\nYes. It may be difficult now but we need to create an environment for him.\nIt was a great story.\nAccording to Leon doesn't it mean that a huge structure with the possibility of an orbital elevator will be created in Korea on this Korean peninsula?\n-gulp!\nEven President Ahn a non-expert thought about it for a moment.\nThat Your Majesty... The Special Self-Governing City is not something we can just give permission to if we want...\nSuch an enormous facility must be placed under the administration of the government. I want to maintain a friendly relationship with the Pantheon but even if that's not necessarily a plan to allow the Autonomous City——\nWill Irmin be managed by the government?\nUmm...!\nPresident Ahn is speechless at Leon's words who immediately understood his intentions.\nIt's okay to put an example like Vatican City. It's a little bigger than that but the goddesses and forest sages who rule the autonomous city will respect you.\nYes? Isn't His Majesty the head of state?\nLeon responded with a chuckle.\nI am the Lionheart of Lionheart. The World Tree and its sages have been my strongest allies but they are not in a vertical relationship.\nOf course since there are no tree men and fairies to take care of and rule this place right now Leon will have to take the place.\nGeemm... First of all we'll prepare to convince public opinion with the meeting. Maybe it won't be too difficult if it's public opinion about the pantheon.\nI'd rather cheer Leon to the National Assembly right now! It is a situation that cries out and even though Leon will not rule it directly a landlocked country with a close commission to Leon will be created.\nConsidering that this war was not simply a South Korean security issue but a global crisis this level of demand was not excessive.\nThat's right Your Majesty. I have information to give to Your Majesty regarding post-war issues.\nSomething?\n“It’s the story of ‘The Resistance.’”\nPresident Ahn immediately told him the story he had heard through Cheon Jin-soo and Kang Jin-seong.\nWould you like to go see them now?\nPresident Ahn secretly guided Leon expecting the treatment he would receive.\n* * * *\nThe inside story of the war was revealed through the testimonies of the North Korean hunters who joined the armed forces the New Sword Guild and the Cheongseong Guild.\nThey hijacked two guilds from a special envoy plane fired missiles at Mansinjeon charter planes and sent a number of air force units to South Korea to defect to South Korea.\nThese seemingly contradictory acts were desperate maneuvers of their own.\n“On the day the Republic fell the demons told the remaining generals.”\nCome under the command of the devil and live an immortal life.\nIn the midst of that chaos the remaining North Korean soldiers made their own choices. Most of them chose subservience——\nYou guys chose to resist?\nThe old man answered the military inspector's question with a strong gaze.\nEven though I've eaten people in the past I couldn't sell my own people to demons. Is that what people do?\nListed by Ri Cheol-ung deputy commander of North Korea's General Guard.\nHe was a member of the bodyguard who was loyal to the Kim pigs who sucked the people's blood while doing all sorts of dirty work.\nEven he saw that this was not the case.\nThe evil act of corrupting people's souls and selling their own people to the devil was an atrocity that even those who did not believe in God could not do.\nHe chose resistance by mobilizing a considerable number of North Korean troops including the Guard General Bureau Reconnaissance General Bureau 5 Corps and 6 Corps but most of the People's Army had already chosen to submit to North Korea.\nThey made an extreme choice because they couldn't afford to deal with even the demons in a situation where even they were difficult to deal with.\nWe brought in South Korea out of curiosity. If we attack South Korea South Korea will have no choice but to go to war with the Republic.\nAs long as the charter plane is attacked South Korea has no choice but to start a war with North Korea.\nThanks to that the demons had no choice but to start a war with South Korea earlier than they planned.\nIn a way it was no exaggeration to say that he was the number one contributor to this war.\nJust one thing.\nIt took just one thing.\nThe military inspector glanced over the glass tube of the investigation room while organizing the testimony of the head of the resistance.\nYou can't see it from here but you can see it from there. Indeed what kind of judgment will he make...\nSo what are we going to do now?\nLee Cheol-woong wanted to know his place in a unified Korea.\nHe is the leader of the remaining North Korean forces and the number one contributor to this war.\nI hope that if I appeal to that point I will be able to preoccupy my own position in a unified Korea.\nOf course it will not be possible to wield absolute power like before but the fact that South Korea is a democratic country can also be used.\nHe who oversaw the remaining North Korean troops and carried out resistance activities represents North Korea... No he is the only Linmin hero.\nIn a unified Korea the people of North Korea should also be given the right to vote and of course there is no choice but to elect members governors and mayors to represent North Korean regions.\nIf he put himself the hero of Linmin and his subordinates in that place... he would be able to enjoy enough power though not as much as in the past.\nHe is a man who has the courage to refuse a terrible option that is completely incomprehensible but he is a senile politician who has risen to the rank of deputy commander of the General Guard in the North Korean political world where a slight movement can blow his throat.\nHe was a man with the ability to expand his power even in the midst of this chaotic post-war process.\nThat doesn't seem to be a matter for us to decide.\nWhat is that...\nIt was then. The door to the investigation room opens and a bunch of people enter.\nA Yankee in a bluish suit and a mass of armor exhaling a strange breath of flame behind him. Even a boy who just got out of his boyish tee who doesn't fit at all in this place.\nLeon and Vulcanus and Kim Jae-hyeok.\nThe Pantheonists who watched them through the mirror looked down at the aging leader of the resistance.\n“You are the famous pantheon——”\nI'm sorry! Can't I get down on my knees right now!\nTurn it off?!\nA loud voice resounds in an enclosed space. After a little more it wouldn't be strange if his eardrums burst. After the lion the old general's knees gave way.\nYour Majesty will command you! Be polite and accept it wholeheartedly!\nThat what is that...\nLeon looked down at Ri Cheol-woong ignoring the protests that were not his.\nAccording to the laws of the kingdom the crime of trying to damage the body. It is appropriate to destroy the soul... but since it has its own merits it is not unheard of to mitigate the crime.\nYes Your Majesty! Then should I slit your throat!?\nMere death instead of soul annihilation. It was a very lenient treatment for Lionheart's high treason.\nBut Leon shook his head and decided to be more lenient.\nThey are not believers. There is no God who will accept their souls when they die. Earthlings need to be considerate of their position.\nHmm so is he!\nSo I will find out the connection with this so-and-so and the soldiers under his command in the crime of injuring Ok-che and decide the severity of the punishment.\nSo lenient treatment of mere worm serf candidates...! You Vulcanus I am thrilled!\nNo what the heck are these things?\nFirst of all this so-and-so and the generals in charge are sentenced to 5 years in prison as freed people and scheduled serfs. Jim himself ordered lenient treatment so we should not die.\nI will order the knights!\nWhen Ri Cheol-woong who could not keep up with the conversation between the two made a dumbfounded face Kim Jae-hyuk who followed as an assistant... more precisely as an interpreter whispered in his ear.\n“You are now a serf.”\nThere was also Kim Jae-hyeok on the charter plane that the missile dropped.",

      "content": "public support\nThere was a proclamation ceremony for a unified Korea but it had not yet taken over all of North Korea.\nHowever more urgent than that was the mission to support the people in the occupied North Korean region and it was necessary to solve the problems of people's cooperation and food and medical care.\nFortunately the Armed Forces were veterans who were successful in such missions to support the people and the mission to support the people in preparation for unification had been prepared for a long time so there was no problem.\nThe problem was the Knights of the Pantheon who were in charge of supporting the people around Pyongyang...\n“Is it very different from what you thought?”\nThe Armed Forces officer admired the Mansinjeon knights who were active on the battlefield.\nthey were ruthless\nUnbound by the Geneva Conventions the Human Rights Ordinance and the laws of war they brutally trampled on their enemies.\nIn particular there was no forgiveness for the North Korean army which is a follower of the devil and the treatment was so vicious that even the South Korean military even talked about it.\nThat's why I was worried that such ruthless governance would not be applied to the civilian aid missions dealing with the North Korean people.\nBut what is it? Aren't the residents of occupied territories occupied by the Knights more obedient than I thought? In particular the area occupied by the Knights of the Burning Sword the original Knights of the Lion Heart had a particularly high evaluation score.\n‘At first glance it looks like it's going to break but that's not it. He's friendly enough to the point where you wonder if he's the same person as the general public.'\nSupporting the people of the occupied territories is an essential virtue of the modern military.\nIt is because it is a great help just by gaining the favor of the residents and not acting hostilely through public facility maintenance or public livelihood support.\nDo medieval knights in another world understand and do it? no.\nUnlike the knights of modern Earth such as the Knights of Manshinjeon Naju the leaders are those who have lived with different values.\nNevertheless the degree of friendship with the powerless common people was very high.\n‘Basically he has a strong affinity for humans. Is it because you're fighting with a different race like Orcs and Goblins?'\nSo an officer asked.\nI looked at the state of aid to the people of the Mansinjeon unit. It was very successful. The residents are following suit. What kind of secret do you have?\nTo this question Leon replied with a shrug.\nCarrots and sticks.\nIt was a more ordinary answer than I thought.\nWhy?\nOh no. It's a rather ordinary answer... I was expecting something special.\nThat's what it's like to deal with the people. Make sure to reward and punish them and as a ruler give them the confidence that you will keep them full and safe. Then they too should be loyal to the king and nobles.\nIt was the basic of the basics of the ruler. It was a problem because I couldn't keep the basics.\n“Isn’t it emphasized throughout your scriptures?\nHave you read the Confucian scriptures? You are very knowledgeable.\nIt's much better than democracy.\nKuh keuhum...!\nAs a soldier in a democratic country and an officer standing in front of a nobleman of the times it was an embarrassing statement that could neither be affirmed nor denied.\n“Rather than that everyone is unexpectedly well versed in medical knowledge right?”\nThe officer saw the flaming sword knights who were evasive and supporting the people.\nThey were born combatants but what surprised them most was their extensive medical knowledge.\nIt was mainly for external injuries but the Lionheart Kingdom always consumed the blessed crops so it was natural that there would be no disease in the body.\nSir Raihar! I brought a patient here! He's from the next town!\nBehold North Koreans have been visiting the barracks of the Knights of the Burning Sword even though there is a military medical unit nearby.\n“Sir Hari lie down over here.”\nIt was an awkward sight to see a member of the Holy Grail in armor taking care of the patient but Lord Raihar skillfully examined the patient.\n“Where did the old man come from because he was sick?”\nNu I can't see well...\nIt's in the middle of an old age... It's because I don't like eating. It's glaucoma so even the children who were cursed by the wizards of the School of Ruin had this disease... This is a very strange land.\nSaying that Lord Raihar set fire to his fingers and immediately threw himself at the old man's eyes.\nKiaaaaaagh!\nUh-huh! Some kind of safety squeal! Quiet!\nThe old man stopped in pain as he pulled his ear lobe as if he were a child. Then she realized that the sparks in her eyes hadn't hurt her at all.\n“This this this...”\nSince you've driven away all the bad energy your eyes should be a bit clearer now.\nIt really was. The old man trembled as he realized that his eyes which had been dim until just now were as clear as the East Sea.\nNu eyes...\nSurprised by the miracle that the eyes that had not been seen for 20 years had been cured Raihar slapped the old man's butt and pushed him away.\nGo and eat some of the soup they give out get some education from Priest Choi and then go. Commoner girl over there! Stop occupying your seat bow and leave!\nGo thank you! Thank you!\nWith a half-mad expression on his face the old man naturally went to the tent where the priests of Demera were gathered received instruction on the doctrine of the pantheon and returned.\nSomething warm or sacred or something ambiguous was unfolding but it didn't necessarily show only good scenes like this.\nMansinjeon People's Army Prisoner Camp.\nPeople's soldiers who surrendered one after another after Pyongyang was completely occupied by the pantheon were held here.\nHey let go of this! Let go clearings and bastards!\nThe Yankees' minions! Dirty capitalists!\nMost of the People's Army entered the concentration camp for prisoners of war but there were many who resisted.\nOh no! Let's have some!\nEveryone calm down and go in your turn!\nMansinjeon Naju Knights. Kim Jae-hyeok and Han Su-ho tied up the young stormtroopers who were resisting partisan activities and brought them to the prisoner of war camp.\nSir Kim Jae-hyeok! Sir Han Soo-ho!\nSir Tarhan the prisoner of war camp manager greets the two at the entrance.\nHe was taking care of the prisoners and treating the injuries sustained in the battle with Rakshaar.\nAh Sir Tarhan. Are you feeling well?\nHe responded with a chuckle at Suho's polite attitude.\nHehe my body hurts. If His Majesty hadn't ordered a rest I would have rode a horse and headed for the battlefield.\n“There are no big fights outside. Laihar is doing the boring work of treating patients and evangelizing.”\nHe said he'd rather have a fight.\nIt's okay but I envy you for smelling the outside air.\nEven if there are resistance activities they are only small-scale guerrilla activities.\nTheir resistance was meaningless when the resistance army the largest faction of the remaining People's Army had already surrendered.\n“By the way what about Lord Tarhan?\nAre you okay? Without a judge or prosecutor...\n“The Holy Grail Knights have the legal right to serve as judges in trials. In court this work is the prosecutor and judge.”\nIt's new but what the hell were the Lionheart knights like?\nIt's like the right to conscription or the right to war. Even so the uppermost class of society has a lot of legal rights.\nIt was a powerful authority that was easy to abuse but surprisingly they were honest elites who thoroughly handled their work through FM.\nWell normally a judge appointed after studying Kingdom law is the case but in an emergency it can't be helped. We Lionhearts understand each other's rights and don't infringe on each other.\nEven though everything was handled judiciously it seemed that the country was running well so there is nothing to say on this side either.\nHowever if there is a little very little problem... Would the law be a little too harsh?\nSo what crime did these guys get brought to?\nHmm... those youth stormtroopers? They're friends but they seem to have harassed the residents a lot. This guy is looting—\nYaktaaaar? A soldier? Yaktaaaaar?\nJaehyuk wondered if he should say this at the sight of Sir Tarhan whose eyes had gone round but what to do when it was all his karma.\nAnd there were dozens of reports of indecent assault... well it was a normal thing in that unit—\nPetos one of them is going up.\nSir Tarhan draws his sword. The blazing sword represented his anger.\n[I don't need a soul like this! Do you think I am a garbage incinerator?!]\nPetos who rejected the souls of sinners offered to him asked the knights to do well in evangelism.\nAaaaaagh! The crazy tin catches the people!\nSah save people!\nOh Sir Tarhan. Let's not burn normal people to death but use them as labor force. I heard there's a shortage of people in Pyongyang serf brother? Starting from 3 years depending on the type of crime?\nJaehyuk you've been stained a lot too...\nPeople's soldiers captured in this way were released according to the nature of their crimes and became civilians or were sentenced to serfdom after thorough interrogation.\nMy serf friends say they eat a lot of salted radish. We are similar.\nHow economical it is to be able to pamper a person for over ten years with a special meal mixed with water salt and a little sugar.\nAfter accepting the miraculous ledger that the weekly food cost of 3000 serfs acquired in a week was around one million won the inspector general of the Armed Forces took a peek at the skin-to-bone serfs in the camp and rolled his pen.\nWeekly meal expenses: 1000000 (KRW).\n- Creepy!\nWeekly meal expenses: 1000000 00 (KRW)\nNo problem. Thank you for your continued support Lord Tarhan.\nThe major also works hard.\nAfter the war it has already been a week since the disbandment of military units near Pyongyang.\nPrisoners at the Mansinjeon POW camp are guaranteed very humane treatment and a comfortable camp life.\n······\n······.\nAfter reading the report that had been processed with Gara the ROK military leadership secretly covered the papers.\nWhat we don't know.\nWe treat it as if the data were lost during the battle.\nOops the North Korean army's shells hit the data storage room.\nIt was one of the few useful things during the war.\n* * * *\nWith the support of the Korean government and public opinion Manshinjeon is accelerating efforts to turn Pyongyang into a world tree sanctuary but the project has not been going smoothly.\nWe need additional manpower support for the new Pyongyang City resident process!\n“Kyung Dae-seong is working hard but the problem is food delivery is a big deal!”\nAlthough the pantheon has been greatly increased in power most of it is focused on military power.\nThe 10000 man-at-arms and sexual law knights were also active in the public support mission but they are far short of manpower to command and control the large city of Pyongyang and its vicinity.\nHowever when we open our hands elsewhere the armed forces are too busy to help.\nOriginally the pantheon had the best existence to cover the rush of administrative work.\nIron and Blacksmith's Grail Knight Yakt Spinner.\nThe strong artificial intelligence of the future world and the absolute leader in electronic administrative work.\nA workload that would take hundreds of years for ordinary humans took less than 10 seconds in Yappy's hands.\n0.5 seconds to review. 2.5 seconds to sub plan after reviewing and simulating thousands of directions depending on the business case. The remaining 7 seconds are used to repeat the same task twice more.\nYapi who had such an overwhelming ability to handle tasks was currently absent. The reason is simple.\nDuring the battle with Rakshaar Yapi suffered fatal damage to the power source that moved the once-shattered fuselage.\nIn the first place the broken reactor was a yapp that was driven by the unscientific power of divinity.\nNot only did the function stop when the divinity was blocked but the damage was accumulated because Leon's armor was polished by excessive divinity operation.\nIt's been a week since the war ended like that.\nKikluk······.\nYapi nodded at the sight that slowly opened and stood up.\nUnnatural listlessness as if power had not been supplied for a long time. It was a sluggish movement that was not common for Yapi a machine.\nCheck the surrounding landmarks. Information falsification.\nYapi knew this was a strange place. The most luxurious bedroom in Pyongyang. A normal yappy would have figured it out right away by comparing it with the data obtained by the spy robot but the search for information is strangely slow.\nAbove all the feeling of déjà vu as if the thinking itself had slowed down. It was when Yapi was embarrassed by her own strange sensations.\nOh! You're awake!\nYapi a red-haired girl ‘remembered' that the organism's name was Hanhari.\nHanhari the name of an organism.\nAh~ Still hard-spoken. Even if it's a ‘temporary body' doesn't it change a little since you've become cute after a long time?\nWhat are you talking about this lowly organic matter.\nYapi as usual tried to come up with 108 ways to harass Han Hari but his search processor still didn't work so he tilted his head.\nKick?\nAnd something feels strange. The usual voice processor or voice recognition function is obviously foreign.\nCome on~ I'm here to wash you up but since you woke up after a long time shall we wash ourselves?\nUgh Hari supporting Yapi.\nDon't touch it organic... body?\nIt's not your usual eye level. Yapi was dragged by Hari's lead because of the driving method that didn't have enough power and didn't know exactly ‘how' and was able to stand in front of the mirror in the bathroom.\n······.\nA cold round fuselage reinforced with star iron. A 360-degree omnidirectional high-performance camera eye that can grasp distances of hundreds of kilometers at a glance. Eight legs and mechanical arms that assumed high-speed maneuvering in urban combat.\nKick?\ndoes not exist. not visible\nThe mirror which must have reflected her appearance due to its location was not the crystallization of her refined future technology——\nHow is it? Isn't it cute?\nGray hair sweeping across the floor as if it had never been cut and the high-performance camera eye that provided eight 360-degree viewing angles has been transformed into a clear and transparent silver color.\nThe inefficient clothes which Yappi always ridiculed as low-level cold protection for organisms were trying hard to cover the thick swollen chest and the cold and refined steel skin was replaced by soft and fragile skin.\nEven Yappy whose search engine didn't launch could understand this.\nIs Joe hot?\nUgh bad words!”",

      "content": "The reason why I, an all-around super robot, became an inferior organic beautiful girl (1)\nWith the armor completed thanks to Yaffe's desperate hammering Leon was able to secure victory.\nIt goes without saying that Leon who had won such a victory first tried to revive Yapi.\nHowever the reactor and fuselage damaged in the battle with Rakshaar did not work even with divine resupply.\nIron Divine. Why is Lord Spinner not awakening?\nIn response to the Lion Heart King's question Heto expressed regret as if he was frustrated.\n[I don't know if I can fix it even if I descend myself. Even if the power source the nuclear reactor is maintained the fuselage is too damaged. It has been contaminated by something foreign magic power.]\nHeto guessed as he looked at Yapi's damaged body through Leon's field of vision. If you descend directly you will see it more clearly but the enormous divinity consumed for it is harmful to the pantheon.\n“Vice what do you think?”\nApparently unlike the gods who can only be seen through the eyes of their Grail Knights or Guardians in the Pantheon Beatrice was able to touch and examine Yapi's torso.\nBeatrice mobilized all her magical knowledge to look at Yappi and identified the cause.\nContaminated by Rakshaar's magical power. Except for the reactor and some parts protected by the divine this fuselage should be abandoned.\nIf all you need is a new fuselage good luck.\nLeon with Heto's help separated Yapi's memories and the reactor.\nThen what about Lord Spinner's new fuselage?\n[·······.]\nHetoshi?\n[Yafi has no choice but to do that. There is no one among us who has the knowledge to create that high-tech fuselage.]\nLeon shook his head.\nYaffe needs a new fuselage to resurrect but Yappy has to make the fuselage himself?\nIsn't that a contradiction?\n[Well once Yapi opens his eyes he will find a way himself.]\nWhat if?\n[With our knowledge we cannot build or connect Yapi's high-tech fuselage. Then shouldn't we do it as a professional field?]\nIf you can't build a body build a ‘body'. First of all wouldn't it be possible to put Yapi's consciousness into the body to wake up and then Yapi to make the fuselage?\nIn short their idea of ??making a temporary body would not have been so outlandish. but······.\n[Would you like a girl? I want to be a small and cute child.]\nDemera the goddess of life and fertility disagreed with Petos the god of war.\n[Spinner is a great warrior. If so wouldn't it be nice to have big kidneys and bulging muscles?]\n[Hmm to be good at hammering it's good to have muscles attached. There is truth in the words of war.]\nHeto the god of iron and blacksmiths agrees. However Fleur the goddess of dreams and death presents a different opinion.\n[The original woman actively denies the opinion of war and iron. I have to take her factor from her original daughter's god director and make it into a beautiful girl's body.]\n[Uh huh even if it's a muscle? It is right to claim to be a dependable warrior as the factor of Vulcanus.]\nWhen Petos immediately asked back Ariana answered back this time.\n[If you want to find a base factor wouldn't it be better to use Leon a knight of this goddess and an agent of the pantheon? Even in war they say they favor my knight more.]\n[Leon is beautiful but he doesn't have the appearance of a mighty warrior. It would have been perfect if he was only 40 cm taller and weighed twice as much. Even though Vulcanus isn't cheap his physical beauty is worth seeing.]\n[Have you seen this macho? It's gross if you're close to two hundred and three. There's nothing wrong with my knight's height and weight. War say no more opinions.]\n[Unjust light!]\n[Before applying the variable interest rate of the borrowed holy power do not act rashly in war.]\n[Turn it off!]\nAfter Petos sank only Heto was left with the idea of ??turning Yapi's new body into a thriving muscle fodder.\n[No since I'm my blacksmith I have priority...]\n[It is life that breathes vitality into the body and it is the forest that sprouts the body so the priority is not only you.]\nIrmin the goddess of forests and trees was the creator of not only the tree men but also the big-eared race called fairies. Of course-\n[I also like pretty and beautiful things. Even as a man Leon is better.]\n[······Why don't women know the beauty of muscles?]\nThe god of the sea and waves secretly gave his opinion to Heto who was sullen.\n[I think beauty is better.]\n[Shut up the horny guy who makes beautiful women hang on the player statue.]\nIn this way it was decided that the body to resurrect Yapi would be a female body based on Beatrice.\nKkiruuk?!\nOf course Yapi's own opinion was not included at all.\n* * * *\nIn front of the Ryugyong Hotel where the world tree grew. The Knights of the Temple of Heaven and Man-at-Arms were in the middle of cleaning up their surroundings.\nThe downtown Ryugyong Hotel which was the center of the battle in Pyongyang was damaged in the aftermath of the battle and it was necessary to call in a lot of experts to clean it up.\n‘Should I call a contractor?'\nA lot of that too. When South Korea said that hundreds of heavy equipment would have to be mobilized in large quantities Leon dropped the plan.\n‘There are serfs so why hire a separate labor force?'\nI'm going to tear down all the buildings around the World Tree except for the important ones! Workers can use serfs so destroy them!\nThe number of serfs that the pantheon acquired in this war was staggering.\nIn collaboration with the government the ‘Devil Followers' KPA were ruthlessly sentenced to serfdom so the majority of the KPA were sentenced to serfdom according to the severity of their crimes and free labor was plentiful.\nGo Comrade Overseer!\nDon't talk to me carelessly serfs!\nHee...! Oh sorry!\nLord Galatan of the Knights Templar a flaming sword that ferociously slices the air with a whip. After bullying the lowly serfs he inquired about their business.\nYou're an insignificant serf. What's the reason you dirty the ears of a noble knight?\nThat that's...\nThe former People's Army serf cautiously opened his mouth in front of a steamy medieval knight who was more overbearing than a propagandist who said he had descended directly from the party.\nNow please provide some heavy equipment needed for the work. How can a stone that weighs more than tens of kilos be moved with only human power-\nThe People's Army serf was at a loss for words when Galatan glared at him with an open gaze. As he whipped his whip with brute force the sound of his whip resonated ferociously.\nHeeik...!\nThe serfs were trembling because of their great pore size. Galatan growled ferociously.\nHave you seen these pathetic bastards! In the days when I ruled my land the serfs didn't complain even though they built the wall all day long!\nI couldn't complain.\nThose wretched bastards built the wall for 5 years but it's hard to lift a few stones why are you making this mess?\nThe longest life span of serfs in the Galatan estate is 5 years.\nYou guys are lacking nooooh! Nooooh! My today you guys I have to start with mental training again! Everyone stop working! Conduct corrective labor training!!\nAt first glance it seems comfortable to stop work but Lionheart's treatment of serfs can't be so merciful.\nThey'll soon be screaming for me to do the work.\nHan Su-ho who was watching this asked Cheon So-yeon with a worried expression.\nIs it okay? Isn't that like catching people like in Naju?\nIt's okay. They're the ones who were sentenced to ‘indefinite serfdom'.\nOh~\nThe serfs captured from the Grand Duke of Slaughter's territory were exhausted because they were demon followers with heinous crimes but the People's Army serfs were a bit ambiguous.\nBasically minor crimes were freed so all the People's Army who were sentenced to serfdom were serious criminals but if that was a mortal sin that would tear the soul apart that wasn't the case either.\nThere were people like Ri Cheol-ung who had unavoidable circumstances and there were serfs who received 5-year or 10-year prison sentences after proper reform work.\nSince they plan to guarantee their survival and release them as free people after their sentence is over the knights were moderately treated carelessly.\nHowever indefinite serfdom is different. They actively followed the demons and if they died during execution they would even be absorbed into Lord Gratas' Bible.\nIn other words they are those who are sentenced to extreme punishments that do not matter even if they die and will not be comfortable even after death.\nI hope everyone can hold out a little longer.\nHuh? So-yeon what are you doing?\nWhen Cheon So-yeon who was poisoned by the Lionheart-style thinking made an unexpected remark in the Knights of the Pantheon Suho snooped.\nThe more labor the better. That's all money.\n······Sometimes you get more and more scared.\nLeon said he was satisfied but it was Suho who wondered if modern people could do this.\nIsn't that your sister over there?\nHuh? Sister!\nSuho approached Hari who was moving on horseback. Hari also found Suho and shook his hand.\n“Suho are you doing well?”\nYeah. But behind my sister...\nAnd I was speechless when I found a woman standing close behind him.\nand······.\nShe was a great beauty.\nThe long tied hair looked soft at a glance and the distinct features and elaborate face were perfect as if the gods had sculpted them.\nAbove all the beauty of the girl was so great that it reminded me of one person.\n‘It seems to resemble Queen Beatrice...'\nno way. no it can't be\nShe opened her mouth to Suho who continued to appreciate her beauty without thinking about it.\n“What are you trying to say organism name Han Su-ho?”\nEh?\nA cold voice that seemed to cool down even the love of a thousand years. Above all Suho made an expression of disbelief at the familiar tone.\nStop can't you?\nYeah I can't believe it. Sir Yapi.\nNo that's nonsense...\nSuho made an expression of disbelief but Soyeon who was following him was different.\nAre you awake?\nUh Soyeon did you know?\nIt seems you haven't heard because you've been working on the camp side.\nSince Cheon So-yeon was the leader of the knights she tended to receive all the latest information from the Mansinjeon.\n“Hari-senpai what business did you bring?”\nSir Yapi tidy up your hair and eat something. You're not used to the human body yet.\nI'll help too. Suho you go first.\nUh uh uh...\nTraditionally when women play together men are not allowed to intervene. Regardless of whether it's correct to view Yapi as a biological woman.\n* * * *\nThe door to the hair salon in front of the Ryugyong Hotel opened and a middle-aged woman greeted the customer.\nWelcome fifty... Lady Han Hari! Captain Soyeon!\nMr. Han who ran a barbershop in Naju recognized the two at once.\nAre you going to cut it?\nOh I'm fine. I'd like someone over here please.\nHuh? Oh my gosh you're very beautiful~\nMr. Han couldn't help but admire Yapi.\nHer hair was long like it had never been cut in her life but it was amazingly perfect.\nEven the well-maintained hair of a popular idol won't be this shiny.\nCome on sit down. It's used by North Koreans but it's in the middle of Pyongyang so the facilities are good. Wash your hair first—\nEven though her hair was so long it was only a matter of shampooing it but touching her soft hair made Han feel better.\nCome on how should I cut it?\nMisem.\nhuh?\nYou can just push it away.\nMr. Han hesitates at Yapi's hot remark. Hari and Soyeon were also frightened and dissuaded them.\nOh Sir Yapi! Why are you shaving that head! What a waste!\nThe hair on the head is a crude cold protection tool for humans that evolved for survival. It does not apply to this machine. Shave it off with a shaved head for efficient activities.\nSo it took quite a long persuasion to dissuade Yapi's argument that it was right to push it out for efficiency.\nNo I can't cut it! I can't shave my pretty hair like this!\nThe struggle based on Mr. Han's professional ethics also played a part.\n* * * *\nWow it's cut really nicely.\nMy hair is so good so even the basics worked well.\nIt doesn't make any sense.\nDespite Hari and Soyeon's sincere compliments Yapi reacted bluntly.\nYappy who had long floor-length hair that was trimmed off to her buttocks still feels long and uncomfortable.\nHowever I felt that it was inefficient to refute the desperate persuasion of the two people and the desperate opposition of Mr. Han a beautician who is willing to neglect his duty so I left the inferior cold protection organ of the organism.\nIt came from the feeling of being ‘annoying' but the current Yapi didn't know.\nThen shall we eat?\nThe eating behavior of the organism is not interested in the inefficient act of charging power. I hope to secure nutrients only to move this inefficient mass of organic matter.\nEek~ It's a human body after a long time so you should try a lot of delicious things.\nHari said something regretful but Yapi looked at Hari miserably and looked down from above.\nAn organism's inefficient eating behavior is itself a proof of inferiority. Do you not even think about the energy wasted for the organism's eating behavior?\nYapi did not bend his will presenting the carbon emissions of livestock and the enormous waste of energy required to manufacture feed as evidence.\nThen what do you want to eat? Combat rations?\nThe organism only needs to obtain the minimum amount of nutrients.\nSaying that Yapi headed somewhere with awkward steps. It was a place where the people's army serfs sat on the ground and ate.\nSir Yapi?\nSo-yeon felt strong and tried to stop her but Yapi walked to the food table without hesitation.\nSufficient amounts of sugar-salt water and nutrients are sufficient.\nEek... would you like something like that?\nRemembering the pain of eating only sugar-salt water in the past Hari hated it but Yapi sighed and accepted a glass of sugar-salt water distributed to serfs.\nAs long as the nutrients are satisfied it is sufficient.\nUm then would you like to sit over there and eat?\nYou should eat slowly...\nthe two knew How salty that sugar salt water is and how simple it is to make your tongue tingle.\nYou have to drink it slowly one sip at a time so you can barely pass it over your throat so it is recommended to sit in a corner and consume it.\nI can't be sick with these lowly serfs.\nYapi drank the sugar-salt water at once not paying attention to the glances of the lowly people's army serfs.\n- Pooh!!\nAs expected Yafi pours out the sugar-salt water.\nSir Yapi! Are you okay?\nPu-hup! Phu-heb! Guweeek!\nYapi vomited and poured out all the sugar-salt water he drank.\nWhat? Soreness. Pain. Pain. What is this?!\nThat's right... sugar salt water isn't it? A lot of sugar and salt...\nHow can you eat something like this!\nYappy throws a glass of sugar-salt water and breaks it. I thought of the People's Army serfs who were watching it with one mind.\n”You guys fed us.”\nEither that or not Yapi continued to vomit and was disgusted.",

      "content": "The reason why I, an all-around super robot, became an inferior organic beautiful girl (2)\nIt was about half a year ago that Rakshaar occupied Pyongyang.\nThis means that the large city of Pyongyang has passed half a year without any logistics movement and it was said that quite a few plants and infrastructure were destroyed.\nA city is a deformed living system that cannot last even a month without an influx of food and materials from outside.\nThe ROK military which entered Pyongyang had to order large-scale supplies from South Korea immediately.\n「Large Recruitment of Pyongyang Materials」\nIt is said that the supplies for the soldiers are solved with jjambab but the hunters were different.\nThe high-income hunters were not the ones to be satisfied with the army jjambab and each sent a large amount of professional chefs and necessary supplies from the guild headquarters.\nThanks to this the restaurants around the Ryugyong Hotel which they occupied one by one became the headquarters of luxury chefs.\nAh Princess Han Hari. Knight Commander Cheon So-yeon. Do you want to eat?\nWhen the executives of Manshinjeon enter the president comes out and greets them.\nYeah~ How's the business going?\nHehe I have no time to rest because I'm trying to feed thousands of people every day.\nMansinjeon also hired a large number of local residents from Naju and brought them to Pyongyang.\nIt is said that the local commercial district of Naju was revitalized thanks to Manshinjeon but when the war slowed down local restaurant owners and employees were generously paid for their departure and everyone rushed to Pyongyang excitedly.\n“The owner of the chicken restaurant next door fry a thousand chickens a day.”\nRight chicken!\nHari flashed at the word chicken house and shouted.\nSoyeon-ah I'll go and buy some chicken.\n“That soy sauce.”\nHari gives a thumbs up and walks out the door. Only So-yeon and Yapi are left in her place.\nWhat do you want to eat?\nIt doesn't matter as long as you have enough nutrients.\nYou just vomited up enough nutrients?\n······.\nWhen Yapi didn't say anything Soyeon roughly selected food from the menu.\nI'll make the pork cutlet official.\nOkay. Wow~ All three of you are very beautiful~\nIt was a compliment mixed with sincerity but Yapi pouted and showed no reaction.\nThe standard of organic beauty had no special meaning to her.\n“Where is the fuselage of this machine?”\n“It was completely destroyed and tainted by the demon lord’s magic.”\nSoyeon told Yapi the story the gods had told her.\nThey said the only thing that could be salvaged was the reactor and memory data. The new fuselage must be made by Lord Yapi himself.\nWe have to hurry. This machine will get out of this savage organic body as soon as possible.\nDoes it look good?\nthis?\nYapi smiled and showed a rotten expression to Soyeon who was wiggling her hair.\nIt only has two eyes.\n“Of course.”\nIf you only have two eyes how can you look behind you? And why can't you connect with the reconnaissance drone camera? If so how do you monitor the outside area?\nYapi's displeasure did not end there.\nI only have two arms. How do I fix this if it breaks? How do I multi-task? First I need to attach a few more arms.\nIt's not even Asura what...\nWeak armament. Lack of diversity in external armaments.\nBy the time Yapi was complaining about the limitations of humans bowls containing food arrived one after another.\nThe food is out.\nPork cutlet set meal with Korean-style pork cutlet hamburg steak fish cutlet and salad.\nThis is the biggest problem.\nPork cutlet set meal?\nIt simply symbolizes the inferiority of organisms that have to rely on their sense of taste to choose their food.\nYapi preached the efficiency that machines can operate for hundreds or thousands of days with only cheap electricity generated from nuclear reactors.\nSo the most perfect way of evolution is for all organic matter to be mechanized through cyberware modification. It is questionable that taste cells were not blown away even in this machine's world.\nYes yes at least eat it. Whether or not you remodel it later you have to eat for now.\nKick.\nYapi gave a dissatisfied look at So-yeon who overlooked her reasonable logical thinking but picked up the pork cutlet with her bare hands as if replenishing energy was the priority.\nWhy are you picking it up with your bare hands?\nWhat's the problem?\nIt's dirty.\nAll you have to do is eat and clean up.\nIf you get it on your hand... uh I'll slice it so give it to me.\nSo-yeon who was worse off sliced ??the pork cutlet. So-yeon recommends cutting pork cutlet on a fork.\nSleep. Ah~\n“Meat fried in oil has more calories than the daily recommended amount——sweet?!”\nThe pork cutlet is shoved into Hari's mouth as she tells a long story. Yapi's eyes widened as he unknowingly chewed it.\nThe combination of juicy and greasy tempura and sauce that bursts with each bite. Waste of energy due to excessive carbon emission and oil with poor absorption efficiency in the human body——\nKick?\nThe definitive version of carbon emission the main culprit of environmental pollution real meat made from slaughtered live livestock not 3D printed meat.\nIn addition the batter fried in high-temperature oil is crispy and the generous amount of demi-glace sauce is sweet.\nIt was a shock.\nFor a thousand years the first pork cutlet eaten by a machine that had never eaten before acquired an organic body caused a great electrical stimulation in Yapi's biological brain.\n-shaking\nSir Yapi?\nWithout answering Soyeon's words Yapi hurriedly ate the pork cutlet. While sipping the mushroom soup and cola that came with it.\n······.\nYapi who inhaled the pork cutlet meal in an instant suddenly noticed Soyeon's gaze looking at me.\nis it delicious? Yapi avoids the gaze and makes excuses.\n“It was an act of emergency evacuation to recharge energy.”\n“Yes yes you would.”\nHe didn't know human language but Yapi guessed that it was making fun of him. I don't even know that it's a mindset that can't exist in a machine that only values ??facts.\nThe chicken is here! Hey Sir Yapi have you finished it already?\nWhat else is that?\nYappy looks at the chicken box Hari brought.\n“Hehe if you talk about traditional Korean food isn’t it seasoned chicken?”\n“I just ate greasy high-calorie food. Eating greasy food again——”\nCome on~ Try it first and decide!\nThe red seasoned chicken Hari offered brought a fresh shock to Yapi.\n“What is this...?”\nAh~ This is ‘delicious'.\nit's good?\nIt was the day I learned the concept that machines are delicious.\n* * * *\nAfter the meal the three headed to the top of the Ryugyong Hotel.\nThis desolate hotel which has been under construction for '50 years' with the determination to build a skyscraper that surpasses the 63 Building in South Korea has been completely seized by the roots of the World Tree since the demon lord Rakshaar made it the tomb of the World Tree.\nHowever now that it has been functioning as a world tree by Koo Dae-seong Leon is staying by his side watching over it.\nOnly the exterior work has been completed and the interior work has been suspended for 20 years so the interior is very desolate but there was a story that interior repairs would be done at the pantheon level because of the symbolism that the world tree was used as a tombstone.\nSir Spinner are you here?\nits top floor. Yapi was originally opened as a ramen suite where she bumped into Leon who was waiting for her.\nyour majesty.\nHaha it's quite awkward because it's not the body I usually see.\nLeon looked at Yapi who was born after the delicate work of the gods and smiled with satisfaction.\n“Okay how about a new body?”\nDiscomfort······.\n“Yes that’s right. If you want it’s okay to stay in that body but—”\nYapi shook his head. In order for Yapi to keep this body going she needs at least six more arms than she has now.\nYes if that's your choice then we should respect it. But...\nAs with any noble lady Leon kissed Yapi's hand and grinned.\n“As a knight I regret that I will lose the opportunity to serve such a beautiful lady.”\nKikluk······.\nThe back of the hand is itchy. Yapi had seen Leon's daily manners over and over again but when he received it he felt a strange tickle.\n‘It's the back of my hand that touches me but why does my body temperature rise? After all organic bodies are strange.'\nYapi thought he would have to make a new fuselage as soon as possible.\nI have prepared the necessary facilities by ordering the following ones. There are enough special railroads so please make them according to your will.\nLeon tapped Yapi on the shoulder and promised to support him if he needed anything.\nAs soon as he entered the prepared workshop Heto spoke to Yapi who was hesitant about what to do with the awkward human arm.\n[The human body seems unfamiliar.]\nKick.\nWhen Heto's voice reached my ears Yapi reacted awkwardly.\nThis machine's reactor is not installed. Is communication still possible?\n[You are a Holy Grail Knight because you have a noble soul not because of the strength of your body.]\nThere is no substance called soul to this machine.\n[Yeah that's right. The soul is not material.]\nYaffi raised the hammer.\nHeavy star iron does not melt with moderate firepower.\nWhat is needed to process this is not enormous firepower and high heat but a divine miracle that can bend even the heart of a star.\nFor the Holy Grail Knight a living saint Byeolcheol bends and takes shape just by meaning.\nYapi who hit the hammer to sharpen the bent star iron expressed dissatisfaction that something did not go the way he wanted.\nI'm too short of a hand. I need an extra support arm.\nThere were numerous mechanical arms in Yapi's workshop. There were a lot of mechanical containers assembled by the network and there was also a high-tech facility that projected the blueprint in 3D and estimated the expected completion.\nBut what we have now is the body of an irrational organism. Dissatisfaction with it settled but Heto spoke in a stern voice.\n[No matter what your body is you are my blacksmith and Lionheart's Holy Grail Knight. Clarify that your hammering is the power of a god that works miracles.]\nYaffi recalled the hammering at that time.\nRecalling the words of the Holy Grail Knight Antalk recalling the moment Leon recognized him.\n[You completed the Lion Heart King's armor in a much worse situation than now. Did you make it even when you were perfect?]\nThousands and tens of thousands of armors and weapons were produced but Yapi failed.\nThe star iron weapons that were automatically produced based on perfect blueprints were at best the level paid to soldiers and only the divine armor passed through the hands of Yaffy demonstrated the true power of star iron.\nThe Star Iron Armor is a vessel that holds God's miracles and blessings. We know from accumulated data that it was never determined solely by the fertility rate of star iron.\nHow much lack did you feel while watching the armor of vulcanus.\nLooking at Leon's holy sword I sensed that this was a miracle that would not have happened even with my perfect calculations.\n[The armor you completed is in no way inferior to the star iron armor made by the blacksmiths of past glory. You already have the skill set so all you need is a strong arm to hold the hammer.]\nLong experience excellent technology and expensive materials.\nThat is what is needed to achieve 99% perfection.\nThe true 1% points come from hammering that works miracles.\nThis machine is a completely flawless existence.\nWith that stingy declaration hammer strikes.\nThe fully awakened blacksmith of God created a miracle according to his will.\n* * * *\nSpeaking of results Yapi quickly returned to the body of a machine.\nAfter three days and three nights of hammering eating only food brought by Hari and Soyeon Yapi quickly completed his fuselage and returned to the fuselage with a familiar design after an additional four days.\nIt's shiny because it's made of star iron. But why did you keep the size the same?\n- Advantageous for connecting with other dedicated equipment.\nIs there a need to fix compatibility with other platform armaments that have already been completed?\nIn addition Yapi who has now awakened as a perfect Iron Grail Knight will be able to proceed with the ‘ducal class' plan that has been postponed for a long time due to anguish over perfection.\nBy the way it's amazing. To be able to go back and forth between the human ‘body' and the robot's ‘body'.\nHari glanced at the capsule placed in the corner of Yafi's workshop.\nYapi's body created by the gods himself through the world tree sleeps with his eyes closed in a medical machine manufactured by Yapi himself.\n-It was given by the gods. I can't just throw it away so I'll just keep it.\nI'm sorry~\n- What a pity inferior organism.\nYaffi climbs on Hari's head and slaps him with a mechanical arm. Hari responded with a smile at her familiar personality.\nWell but Sir Yapi is Sir Yapi. Sometimes I move to my physical body and go out to eat!\n- This machine will not participate in inefficient eating behavior.\nA yappy who speaks loudly.\nand the next day.\n······.\n······.\nNaju Manshinjeon Chicken Branch.\nThe gray-haired girl we met at a chicken restaurant selected for the knights' group dinner mumbled a chicken leg in her mouth with a puzzled expression.\nYou say you're inferior?\nManshinjeon... Market research for chicken franchises.\nYou're groovy!\nEven after that gray-haired silver-eyed beautiful girls were often found so it must be that all of this was a market research with a deep meaning for the Yapi franchise.",

      "content": "Newcomers (1)\nAn intangible aura that distorts even space-time. The convergence of that enormous power savagely swallows the air.\nThe moment the hammer struck——\n-Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nThe terrain changes with hammering.\n- Wow... Crazy.\n-That's fucking ridiculous.\nAfter the world's communication satellites crashed the satellites that were urgently launched brought the world together again.\nTo be precise developed countries that have the power to build their own network infrastructure recovered half-global networks but the first thing they searched for after the Internet was restored was the 2nd Korean War.\nVideo records recorded for wartime record collection were released in South Korea as soon as the Internet was restored.\nTo show off the victory of South Korea against the demon lord and the fact that the Korean Peninsula has finally been reunified after 80 years of division.\nAnd in the process what the South Korean government wants to highlight is Koo Dae-sung.\n-Wow~ I thought the real Holy Grail Knight was ridiculously strong...\n-Your Majesty Leon Vulcanus Yapi and Queen Beatrice are all ridiculous monsters.\n-Those people are the survivors of the sin world. They are the nobles who came from that world to the end of the world. By the way-\n- ‘Earthman Holy Grail Knight'...\nYes.\nIn the meantime it has been proven through numerous battle videos that the Holy Grail Knights are super strong easily surpassing even the S-class.\nThe opening of the holy sword by Leon's astonishing comrades during the battle with Akasa the Grand Duke of Slaughter overwhelmed Akasa who had slaughtered even countless S-rank hunters.\nMagician Queen Beatrice is a great mage who treats the 30-year history of magic as a coloring book for children.\nYapi's extraordinary state-of-the-art weapons and technology were at a level that could not be done at the Earth level\nVulcanus and Karina were ridiculous monsters from the point of view of being Holy Grail Knights.\nIn the meantime the Holy Grail Knight was born on Earth?\nHalf the earth saw the pillar of light.\nThe process of sublimation by being chosen by the goddess Demera penetrating the sky and announcing her birth to the world.\n- Hey speak straight. It is not the ‘Earthman' Holy Grail Knight but the ‘Korea's Holy Grail Knight'.\n-No you're from Earth...\n-Uhh don't compare yourself with the nuggets? Where do you secretly put Korea's proud Koo Dae-seong into the comprehensive system of earthlings?\nKoo Dae-sung.\nIn the meantime most of the main forces of the Manshinjeon such as Han Ha-ri and Cheon So-yeon were Koreans.\nThe youngest S-rank hunters Han Ha-ri and Cheon So-yeon were both talented people in the pantheon but the meaning of the name Holy Grail Knight is too great to put them in the same rank as the ‘Grail Knight'.\nThe existence of the Holy Grail Knight is very well known on Earth.\nSuperhumans beyond the era where the gods last for hundreds of years without a successor appearing in one generation... perhaps.\nA living saint who represents God and wields the power of God.\nIts name is revered even on Earth and has a heavy presence.\nSuch a Holy Grail Knight the first Holy Grail Knight on Earth was born in Korea.\n- Wow what is that? is that sex law?\n-It's on a different level from what the priests of Goddess Demera in Naju use.\n-Grail knights and simple priests are on the same level.\n-Kyaa~ That is our Daehan Holy Grail Knight.\n- Jumo! Get down!\nWhen Koreans saw the video they shouted Jumo all over the country.\nAs a result the government was eager to show off its national prestige by supporting Dae-sung Koo but as soon as the video was released numerous reporters from South Korea flocked to Dae-sung Koo.\n“Knight Daesung Koo! How did you become a Holy Grail Knight?”\n“How do you feel about becoming a Holy Grail Knight?”\n“What about the tour course of the ruins of the Mansinjeon in Naju?”\nA series of questions from reporters. Since he couldn't get close to Leon who hated the careless conduct of common reporters everyone's eyes were focused on Goo Dae-sung.\nGoo Dae-sung passed by his father without knowing what he had answered.\n[Grail Knight of Life and Abundance Daesung Koo. Life adversity of the lowest hunter who was called D-class for 10000 years!]\n[Grail Knight Daesung Koo's message to the younger generation.]\n[Holy Grail Knight Sir Koo Dae-seong. When I was young I grew up eating this!]\n[K-Grail Knight's overwhelming performance! Japan is envious Russia is trembling and the United States faints! King of Lionheart K-knight is humane I love it!]\n‘My when did I...'\nAlthough Goo Dae-sung's unspoken words have spread the likeability of Koo Dae-sung in Korea is rising without knowing the end.\n-Kya~ Goo Dae-seong’s vocal method is amazing.\n-Look at the great devil breaking the earthen pot.\n- Goo Dae-sung is the GOAT of the hunter world\nHehe...\nWhat are you looking at?\nUgh!\nGoo Dae-seong who had laughed heartily while watching the comments on his battle video was startled by the voice he heard from behind.\nD Grand Duke of Dragonia!\nCall me Grand Duke Karina. There is room for it to be used interchangeably with the new god of the pantheon.\nKarina looked at Goo Dae-sung holding a smartphone and gave him a strange look.\nBy the way training is lacking. You can't even notice that you're distracted and caught behind your back.\nAh... I'm sorry.\nUntil I'm sorry. Kyung is a living saint whom Goddess Demera made as her proxy. Even compared to the original work her status is by no means inferior.\nThat's why Karina said to straighten her shoulders. Goo Dae-sung could not easily deal with Karina Leon's real daughter the grail knight of Ventasis the god of darkness and death and Dragonia the god of gold and contracts.\nIf you are a person in modern society it would be easy to deal with her as she is the boss's real daughter and even the boss at work.\nBy the way what did you see a little while ago? Sir Hari and the children of this land always carry that thin box.\nAh... you mean a smartphone?\nYes that's it. It's a great item in that it facilitates long-distance communication but the young knights of this land neglected to train to see it.\n·······.\nGoo Dae-seong suddenly wondered if Leon had said something similar.\n“Tsk tsk. How can young people live all day looking at something the size of a hand like that. When I was packing I swung my sword at least once more at that time.”\nHow are you so silent?\nAh sorry. Your Majesty said something similar.\nHmm... Indeed His Majesty seems to have found the same problems as in the original work.\nGoo Dae-seong couldn’t say that he is a kkondae in today’s terms. In this respect do you think the two are father and daughter?\n‘Sir Vulcanus and Her Highness Beatrice adapted right away.'\nRather the two are well-known influencers on social media. I heard that the value of one article is close to hundreds of thousands of dollars and I heard an unrealistic story.\nBy the way Sir Koo Dae-seong. You inherited Sir Geobrick's hammer.\nAh yes.\nWill you show me one more time?\nAt Karina's request Goo Dae-sung raised the hammer at his waist.\nThe heavy one-handed hammer had unusual energy and was the source of Goo Dae-sung's power.\nI heard from Your Majesty. Sir Geobrick will pass on all his powers to whoever wields this hammer.\nThanks to you... I was able to become a Holy Grail Knight who is less than others.\nAt Goo Daesung's self-deprecating voice Karina smiled and patted him on the shoulder.\nSir Geobrick was a Holy Grail Knight. He represents the will of the goddess Demera and his will is her will. You have been chosen by such a legend. Who can doubt your qualifications?\nah······.\nKoo Dae-seong was at a loss as if he had put a wedge in his qualifications after hearing what he had heard from Goddess Demera as well as from Lionheart's Grail Knight.\nEven the Goddess even such a great knight does not doubt his qualifications but only I have the qualifications.\nLet's compete for a while.\nyes?\nThere was no aesthetics of waiting. As soon as the words were finished a blow of dots rushed in like a darting arrow. Goo Dae-seong reflexively raised the earth shield to block it.\n‘fast!'\nIf it weren't for the reflexes that entered the realm of superhumans after awakening as a Holy Grail Knight he wouldn't have even seen the stabbing.\nKarina put one arm behind her back like a fencer and stabbed the sword fiercely with only one arm.\nA series of high-speed stabs. Koo Dae-seong blocked it with the shield of the earth but soon realized that only blocking it was not the best strategy.\n-thud!\nBig...!\nThe shock transmitted from the earth shield made my arms numb and pushed my entire body.\nNo matter how much the Holy Grail Knight possesses superpowers how heavy he is at such a speed.\n‘I've had sparring with His Majesty but you've really looked after me a lot!'\n·······!?\nThe earth's shield which had been receiving the onslaught grew in an instant and tied Karina with its roots. Karina immediately throws away her gripping sword and steps back behind her.\nSword! I will not return it!\nGoo Dae-seong completely blocked Karina's sword with the Earth's shield. Having read her armament Karina will have to fight herself with her bare body.\nYou don't know the power of the dark god.\n·······?!\n< Demonic Sword's Hwihwang >\nCarina's demonic sword held in the earth's shield began to radiate darkness. When she wondered if it was just fog there was a sound like something being gnawed at her shield.\nBar shield!\nThe shield of the earth that swallowed Karina's demonic sword was severed by the darkness emitted by the demonic sword and collapsed in an instant.\ncome.\nAnd when the target that was trapped disappeared the demonic sword returned with a single gesture from Karina.\nKarina resumed her onslaught against Goo Dae-sung with the returned magic sword.\nWhat is different from before is that the blow she wields cuts through even Goo Dae-sung's star armor.\nIf the Holy Sword of Light is a category that swallows evil then the Demon Sword of Darkness is a blade that cuts everything. Your shield and armor do not have enough iron to counter this absolute cutting power.\nGoo Dae-seong terrified by the armor that was gradually being cut off rushes in swinging a hammer forcibly.\n- Knock!\nKarina steps on Goo Dae-sung's chest and aims her sword. It was a complete defeat.\n“Is it also lack of experience?”\nKeuugh...\nI don't feel like I'm falling behind the specs. It's not that Karina didn't do her best but Goo Dae-sung didn't do her best either.\nBut I never thought there would be such an overwhelming difference in basic skills.\nWell don't be so sad. You didn't think you would win the original work did you?\nKeep...\nLooking at Goo Dae-sung's angry expression Karina realized that he was quite serious about trying to defeat her.\nI see His Majesty deserves to be liked that much. He has guts.\nGoo Dae-sung must be qualified enough in that he was chosen by the Goddess and inherited the power of the Holy Grail Knight.\n“Okay so what did you just learn in the studio?”\nWas... were you in a hurry?\nWhat caused it?\nThe shield is also lost... and the armor is also cut off... it's the same.\nThe Earth Shield is not an absolutely powerful shield in terms of durability. However as long as Koo Dae-sung breathes life into him his infinitely regenerating power and special ability bring ridiculous advantages.\nSuch a shield was cut in an instant in front of the magic sword's brilliance and the armor blessed by the goddess Demera that he believed in was torn like a piece of paper so he had no choice but to be impatient.\nThat's also true. It's important to be properly armed and make a vessel to hold the holy power. The base is now the Kingdom Knight's armor so order the proper armor from Sir Spinner.\nReceiving blessings will not be difficult. Koo Dae-seong himself represents the will of the goddess Demera. It was as natural as breathing to bless the completed armor.\nBut Sir's problem isn't the use of armor or shields. It's that he can't handle Sir Geobrick's hammer properly.\nA hammer...?\nThat's not what I'm used to. Originally Goo Dae-seong was a swordsman. One-handed sword and one-handed shield balance center.\nThe shield was still the same but I had no choice but to get used to it because I suddenly had a hammer.\nIt's not a matter of weapon technology. The external release of holy power has no meaning in a fight between the really strong. In the Holy Grail Knight class's interpersonal combat the balance between the inner and outer limbs is more important than the riotous power.\nKnights are giant-like monsters and goblins are the size of a little bitch. An all-powerful warrior who can fight against even humans.\nThe Holy Grail Knights are the warriors at the pinnacle. Although they may have each other's specialties they are not lacking in ‘all-around'.\nBefore demons appeared our real enemies were not like demons. In the history of thousands of years of war the beasts were at the antagonistic point of the struggle.\n-Quaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nIt was then. outskirts of Pyongyang. Huge fireworks welling up vividly even there.\n“Boo Lord Vulcan?!”\nWhat the hell is the reason for Vulcanus to create such a mighty spark? Even the remaining demons?\n-Kwaalalaralalala!!\nAs soon as the flames soared the dragon's roar resonated from a completely different direction. Unlike before the roar of the Black Dragon the first descendant of Dragonia born from the World Tree sounded as if it had lost its momentum.\nAn energy that can crush even a dragon? As far as Koo Dae-sung knows there is only one person like that in this world.\nWhat the hell is going on? Aside from Goo Dae-sung looking around in embarrassment Karina opened her mouth with a sword on her shoulder.\nThe Holy Grail Knights always look for their successors. They teach and expect knights who have demonstrated their dragon power.\nExpecting him to make a new generational shift.\nKarina... Grand Duke.\nNow raise your hammer. Newcomer. Unlike before the number of Holy Grail Knights has also decreased. After you you will have to teach the candidate stepmother how to live in the in-laws in advance.\nKarina resumed the bloody onslaught with a cheerful smile.",

      "content": "Newcomers (2)\nThere is no doubt that it was Koo Dae-seong who awakened as the Holy Grail Knight of Life who stood out in the second Korean War but it was not the only thing that attracted attention.\nAlthough the Holy Grail Knights including Leon and the Burning Sword Knights acted as an overwhelming force after the holy power was sealed by the great magic of Rakshaar the lord of chaos Gudaeseong and the Pantheon Knights became the main force.\nAmong them four people drew attention.\nHan Ha-ri Han Su-ho Cheon So-yeon and Kim Jae-hyeok. Indeed their performance in maximizing the power of the relic showed more value than an S-class hunter.\n“The first thing we need to foster is those four people.”\nLeon and Beatrice and Vulcan and Karina.\nAll the Holy Grail Knights participated in the meeting except for Yapi who has regained his original body and is in the middle of constructing urban infrastructure and Goo Dae-seong who is contributing to the formation of rice fields near Pyongyang.\nThe subject was surprisingly simple.\nFor the time being there isn't much for us to do. Stabilizing an occupied city is for the lower ones to do.\nThe Holy Grail Knights are a symbol of nothingness. Of course it is important to observe the people's livelihood by causing miracles of God with its mighty holy power but it is not to the extent that those who become saints and saints go around directly.\nSo I'm going to go in the direction of intensively educating the knights. In the future the number of new residents will increase.\nSo what's the point of educating those four?\nLeon nodded at Vulcan's question. This is the so-called intensive training of high-quality talent.\nKnights are also knights... but I'd like to add two more.\nWho are you talking about Karina?\n“The Old Bible and the New Black Dragon.”\nIt's a dragon...\nLeon understood when Koo Dae-sung was mentioned.\nGoo Dae-sung is a strong knight with a noble will but his technical perfection was not high.\n“Are you going to teach Goo Dae-seong about interpersonal warfare?”\nYes. But I'd rather be better than Your Majesty.\nWhy is that?\nIt's because His Majesty wants you to take charge of the Black Dragon not Sir Gu Dae-seong.\nHmm...\nThe first life born after the world tree bloomed was a black dragon born as a latent factor in Karina's dragon's heart.\nThe first offspring of Dragon God Dragonia. Called the Black Dragon because it has yet to be named it was a subtle headache for the Pyongyang Reconstruction Project.\n“I heard that they took over the entire Sun Palace and made it rare.”\n“It looks like he liked the jewels and gold inside.”\nIt is a dragon's racial trait to covet gold and jewels. Because they were both greedy and arrogant legends often robbed dwarves' treasuries.\nThe only person who has ever dealt with a dragon is Jim. Jim's reign was one of the few winged fire dragons active.\nThousands of years after the demise of Dragonia the progenitor dragon in Leon's time there were no traces of dragons.\nIt was only when Leon went on a mission to subdue the dragon that had taken over the dwarves' treasury.\nDragons are arrogant and proud. Even if you Carina have a dragon's heart and are Dragonia's agents it will not be easy to suppress that temperament.\n“For that reason I would like His Majesty to take charge of the Black Dragon.”\nThe Holy Grail Knights are the transcendentalists who led the heyday of Lionheart. But the day will come when they too will one day lose like stars and head to the banquet of the gods.\nThe Grail Knights' duty was not only to protect the kingdom but also to teach and lead the next generation.\n* * * *\nSo you guys decided to teach me!\nHari Suho and Jaehyeok silently looked at each other at Vulcanus's enthusiastic cry.\n“If you teach us we are grateful.”\nIt is said that the Pantheon Knights including Hari had been trained by Leon before.\nSwordsmanship spearmanship equestrianism and theological education.\nBasically dozens of people not only theoretical education and repetitive practice but also many real battles at the gate.\n“You must have received direct education from His Majesty. Well I admit it. Your Majesty is an exemplary knight in many ways.\n‘Is that so?'\n‘Is holding a shield and blocking a mounted charge the standard in Lionheart?'\nI was slightly puzzled but thinking about it Leon's education was quite systematic.\nEveryone got hurt here and there because of the hard real battle but their skills were expanded.\nAbove all the amount of training was enormous as it was possible to train virtually infinitely while receiving healing from the Holy Grail.\nBut my education will be different.\nAs soon as Vulcanus finished speaking knights in red armor strode forward.\nBaltan Burning Sword Knights five. They settled down surrounding the three of them in a spacious siege.\n“Does the Holy Grail Knights also participate in the training?”\nWhen Vulcanus laughed at Jaehyuk's question he let out his signature flame breath.\nNo the role is to prevent them from ‘running away'.\nThe next moment the fire gushing out from the Burning Sword Knights formed a wall in an instant. The three of them were frightened by the knights who suddenly spewed fire but Vulcanus felt that it was as planned.\nIt's a pure flame that doesn't discriminate against peers. Except for Lord Hari who is resistant to fire it won't ‘splash'.\nOf course Vulcanus boasts that Hari will mark himself in charge and ‘prevent' him from escaping.\nUh Boo Sir Vulcanus? I'd like to say I'm not running away...\nHarry evaded his words in endless anxiety. Usually the people of Steamy Lionheart tend to go to extremes when they say they do something.\nMy method of education is simple! The strong are born by breaking through endless limbs! In other words...!\nPillars of fire emanating from Vulcan soared high into the sky. Even without using Divine Advent his flame is already the strongest in Lionheart history.\nRepeated death crisis makes people stronger!\nGRARARARARARA────!!\nIt was simple ignorance but it was a standard training method that was surprisingly effective.\nPeople are quick to learn anything with blood.\n* * * *\nDragonia's first offspring.\nThe Black Dragon of this era born from the World Tree was contemplating what to do.\nA mortal enemy engraved in the DNA. But his own great ancestor stood by them.\n[Now is the time to increase your strength and increase your people. You must lead my descendants to be born in the future.]\nHe said that in order to do so he had to become an agent of the contract with his divinity gold.\n[Even so you cannot bow down to that human woman.]\nAt the Black Dragon's words Dragonia thought it was her own descendant but shook her head and said.\n[However we should cooperate. Although you are fierce you cannot match the dragon power of the Holy Grail Knights including Karina.]\nExtremely objective and factual advice. However the black dragon was furious.\n[I am the descendant of the great Dragonia! Can you compare them to mere worm-like humans!]\nArrogance peculiar to the Balaur.\nTheir self-esteem which has fought until the end without giving in even to the gods is not normal.\nEven more the black dragon is a special body that inherited all the knowledge and abilities to lead dragons to be born in the future while being born in the world tree.\nHe showed disrespect even to Karina who provided arguments to him.\n[I admit that you are the progenitor's agent. But don't be fooled into thinking you'll be treated the same as Sijo. That was the last time I put you on my back.]\nThe black dragon displeased with having a human on his back for a moment during the battle with the demon lord found his temporary rare.\nIt is a dragon's instinct to dig a nest and collect treasure. He found the most gorgeous and largest building in North Korea and made his nest there.\nSome strange human corpses were stuffed but those were burned and incinerated.\nIn this way the Sun Palace in Pyongyang where the black dragon was located became a dragon's nest that no one dared to approach.\nHmm~ Well it's pretty well decorated.\nAn uninvited guest who came to such a black dragon's rare. Hearing the sound of footsteps walking through the entrance the black dragon opened its eyes slowly.\n[How dare you without my permission...!]\nBlack's torn pupils fiercely glared at the intruder.\nHer golden hair was gorgeous enough to be coveted by dragons and her aura was in no way inferior to that of dragons.\nThis will become the holy ground of the World Tree. You are the one who built a nest there without permission.\nEven when Leon faced the dragon's ferocious gaze he did not hesitate in the slightest.\nUnder the generosity of Jim and the gods the four of you have built a nest in this land. Even if you can't thank them why don't you raise your eyes?\n[You bastard...!]\nThe black dragon raised its head and looked down at Leon.\nI am the Lion Heart King Leon Dragonia Lionheart. I am the agent of the Mansin and the Guardian of the Holy Grail. Be polite Lizard.\n[You're going too far with a cooperative relationship dwarf!]\nEven the black dragon knew how powerful the human in front of him was.\nHe also witnessed the moment he severed the demon lord Rakshaar.\nBut even so he did not allow the dragon's pride to yield to humans. Even more so the person in front of me is a dragon slayer.\nAren't they the descendants of the one who killed the great progenitor dragon Dragonia?\n[Dragons do not obey humans!]\nThe black dragon swung its heavy tail and struck Leon without the slightest hesitation. I don't think he'll die at this point but it's his own attitude.\n-thud!\nA terrifying shock. However the black dragon felt that its tail stopped at some point. Even right in front of Leon's nose.\n[·······!?]\nWell strength isn't bad compared to its size.\nIt doesn't budge in the slightest. Even though the dragon's tail which weighed several tons was swung Leon blocked it with one arm.\nUnbelievable strength in the human body. The black dragon felt his body float as he was caught by his tail.\nThis place must be narrow. Let's go to a wider place.\nThe dragon's massive body swung and shattered the sun palace. And a black dragon soaring into the air with a tail that was soon let go.\n[Creu...!]\nThe black dragon crushed its teeth in shame and spread its wings. Stopping in mid-air he looks down at Leon with the flapping of his wings.\nLeon summoned the divine beast Stallion and flew up into the sky and the two beings stared at each other in the same sky.\nThe city will be ruined to fight here. Go somewhere a little wider.\n[Don't order me! be impertinent!]\nAt the black dragon's retort Leon smiled and aimed at the holy spear.\nEven if you don't like it I'll force it. Jim doesn't know manners enough to fight in front of the goddess.\nIn the next moment a stream of light poured from the holy spear. The light swallowed the black dragon in an instant and pushed the black dragon out of Pyongyang.\nLike a dump truck swept away by a tsunami the place where the Black Dragon crashed was in the middle of a lake.\nLake Taesong near Pyongyang. This golf course for high-ranking officials in Pyongyang has not been visited by anyone since Pyongyang was annihilated.\n- Crowra la la la la!\nThe black dragon stuck in the lake spewed out its breath with anger.\nRuinous black flames shoot up and open a hole in the sky. Looking down at it Leon honestly admired it.\nBefore the coronation of the Lion Heart King I've fought a fire-breathing fire dragon. Well it's better than that dragon.\nLeon noticed that this dragon was no different from a newborn baby.\nAlthough it is a masterpiece filled with knowledge and magic the fact that it is young cannot be ignored. For example-\n[·······?!]\nThe Black Dragon which was flying after Leon felt that his body was not being lifted by the flapping of his wings.\nFrom the moment he was born he was deprived of the privilege of flying up into the sky as naturally as breathing.\n[You bastard! What have you done!]\nLeon approached the enraged black dragon by flying low and said.\nI don't know the theoretical part. Jim is a kind of cane.\nBlack Dragon realized that it wasn't Leon who blocked his wings. The magician queen sipping her tea on her seat on the lawn of the golf course near the lake.\nDid you know? Your wings alone can't support that weight.\nThe black dragon fluttered and stretched its wings but only the lake fluctuated and it still had no strength like wet cotton.\nThen the conclusion is simple. The flapping of the dragon's wings is not just a physical action but it takes additional magical power.\n[You guys....]\nBeatrice replied with a grin at the torn pupils of the dragon glaring at her.\nFrom now on while dealing with His Majesty and me let's learn how to handle the body and mana at the same time. Shouldn't we lightly deflect this level of interference magic?\nLeon and Beatrice. Even with the two strong men in front Black Dragon did not temper his momentum. Because the dragon's pride wouldn't allow it.\nbut.\nYour Majesty you're still a teacher so don't you want to pay for your school fees?\nDo you wish for anything?\nIt's the first time I've seen a creature called a dragon so there are so many things I want to know. So by the way...\nTuition is one dragon byproduct per day. For example claws or scales.\nCan I take a little?\nCancer! Since ancient times the teacher's grace is like the sky so the disciple must repay it.\nWhoop whoop...!\nThe curiosity of a pure scholar and the blatantly shiny gaze made the black dragon terrifying.",

      "content": "Leon's heir\nWhile discussions on the Pyongyang Special Self-Governing City were taking place in Seoul Leon was living a somewhat boring life.\nNorth and South Koreans who will work as workers in the development of Pyongyang. A plan to allow them to become residents of the autonomous city and at the same time maintain their South Korean nationality.\nHow the city will develop and the issue of disposal of existing property rights in Pyongyang etc.\nDeveloping a new city and declaring it an autonomous city requires a lot of work. The leaders of this city also needed something to leave behind.\nThere are so many things that need to be done so many things to be done but-\nhmm.\nLeon had nothing to do.\nUrban development plan? yapi does it\nPeripheral dental care? knights do it\nAs for the political issue President Ahn is coordinating with the National Assembly and Leon only occasionally appears as a face madam.\nAfter the demon lord of chaos and his forces were wiped out there was only a small gate attack. Even that assault party was not something that Leon would directly step out into.\nIn short there was nothing Leon could do himself.\nThe reason why he is so absorbed in the black dragon's friendship is because Leon basically has nothing to do.\n[Leon is there anything to do?]\nI don't have much to do these days.\nAt the sound of the goddess Leon shrugged. actually it was\nBut isn't this proof that the reign of peace is also a sign that the king is boring?\n[There is no room for my knight to become a cancer soldier.]\n“Exactly.”\nLeon doesn't even think of himself as an outstanding military commander.\nEven when he was in power as Lionheart's Lionheart he wasn't very competent in the affairs of the country.\nIt is because there has never been a feat in history where the wise men accomplished an ingenious feat that will remain in the era for the people.\nHe just worked hard at what he was good at.\nkill orcs. demon hunting. Black Mage Torture.\nMost of Leon's actions inside and outside the kingdom were to punish his enemies with force.\nWhat Leon is still doing is suppressing the black dragon which others find difficult to handle and teaching him what to do to help the pantheon as a dragon.\nIf it's not like Leon the black dragon will kick out my teachers by force.\n[If you're bored how about going to Beatrice's workshop?]\n“You mean Viche?”\nLeon nodded at Ariana's suggestion.\n[Yes it won't be that easy to work as a woman alone. Moving something heavy...]\nGoddess the secret body is the priestess of dreams and death. It's about moving something heavy even with bare hands—\n[Heh heh since when did my knight put a toe on the horse of your goddess?]\nLeon didn't vomit any more at what the goddess said. He leaves the Ryugyong Hotel suite without saying a word and walks down the hallway.\nAs soon as you leave the suite the interior becomes desolate. The interior of the Ryugyong Hotel which had been under construction for 50 years revealed a stark lack of budget.\n“I was going to entrust it to the soon-to-be-born wise men of the forest but I still have to do the minimum interior work.”\n[The roots of the World Tree are down so you'll have to take care of the furniture.]\nThat's right. Treemen and elves hate carved wood furniture.\nBecause of that the dwarves and humans who used firewood and developed forests were close friends. Conflicts due to differences in species occurred everywhere so it was the role of the Lion Heart King to coordinate them.\n[How about entrusting it to Yapi?]\nYou mean Sir Spinner?\nLeon thought about Yapi's way of working but was concerned that it might conflict with the elves and tree men.\nIsn't it Yapi the crystallization of a highly developed civilized society? They probably have no interest in nature conservation or harmony.\n[That child’s way of going out of his way. All you have to do is say one word. If you tell me to pay attention to eco-friendliness I will take care of it.]\nThat's true too.\nYapi alone manages the pantheon's finances. Calling the national treasury is the basis of national work but yapi was somewhat limited in its role.\nIf Yappi focuses on virtual currency production right now it will be able to swallow up the world economy at once.\nHowever because of Leon's ambiguous request to pursue the right way isn't it a healthy property increase even by human standards?\nThanks to the overwhelming computational power of strong artificial intelligence it rarely fails.\nWhoops...\n[Why are you laughing so much?]\n“I just imagined what it would be like if Sir Spinner became the Lionheart.]\n[[······!]]\nAriana wasn't the only one who was taken aback by Leon's lightly raised topic.\nNot only Petos and Poma but also Heto the guardian deity of Demera and Yapi were frightened and dissuaded.\n[Leon my lighthouse. Don't even joke like that!]\nIt's not like I'm joking.\nHeto interrupted Leon's answer.\n[Sounds of a big day! He's my blacksmith but when he becomes king his people will turn him into a cyborg! I will force implant remodeling into the constitution while saying it's efficient!]\nIsn't cyborg transformation something so dystopian?\n[He is the one who will make the Matrix!]\n·······.\nLeon thought about the future where Yapi became the Lion Heart King and then he thought that he might really be like that.\n[Yapi that baby isn't a bad-tempered child... but...]\nIsn't Demera also not pleased?\nEven his benevolent mother reacted like that and Leon asked back as if he was surprised.\n[I think I will develop an apartment on farmland and eat food with artificial food...]\nah······.\nIn the civilized world of Yapi it was possible enough.\nLivestock and agricultural and fishery products were consumed through the development of sinful factories and citizens filled their stomachs with artificial meat...\n“Then Lord Vulcanus——”\n[[I can't do that anymore!!]]\nThere was more resistance than before.\n[The original woman is the opposite of the Lion Heart King who makes a divine descent when she is bored!]\nPlesy Sir Vulcanus is not such an occasional knight.\n[Leon do you still say that when you see Petos holding evangelical meetings in military academies around the world?]\n·······.\nLeon had heard that Petos the guardian deity of Vulcanus was always struggling with his lack of faith.\nSo isn't the holy power continuously sent with the staff obtained from the priest who serves the god Maltak obtained from the demon realm?\nThe gods are worried that if Vulcanus becomes the agent of the mansin all the gods will suffer from lack of holy power.\nVulcanus doesn't have the timely thrift like Leon.\nhmm······.\nLeon went down the stairs and looked for candidates to become the next Lion Heart King.\nI thought I had enough dragon power and qualifications to become Yapi Vulcanus or Lion Heart King but the gods didn't seem to have it.\n‘Then Vichena Karina. Goo Dae-seong remains.'\nHowever Goo Dae-seong lacks experience. It was common for Holy Grail Guardians to be succeeded by Grail Knights but Goo Dae-seong was too young and inexperienced.\nThe other Holy Grail Knights will rebel and they will immediately disobey Vulcanus.\nFor Karina the dragon's heart is the problem. In order to transplant a lion's heart the dragon's heart must first be passed on to the next Grand Duke of Dragonia.\nLike Leon he could hold both hearts for a while but that was only possible because he was Leon.\nWhat if he gave birth to an heir who would inherit the dragon's heart...?\n‘Damn it I don't think you'll see that.'\nJust imagining a boy who will marry his daughter raises his anger. As long as Leon was alive she hated seeing such a mess.\n‘then······.'\nOh Your Majesty. What are you doing? Today isn't Black Dragon's training day is it?\nLeon met Beatrice in front of the room prepared for her workshop.\nAh Biche. Where are you going to drink?\nYes for the experiment.\nLeon looked at the large bundle Beatrice was carrying. She was a bit unbalanced to hold with her slender hands but her priestess would not lack her strength.\nAbove all else as an excellent magician there is nothing that makes her suffer as much as a heavy burden.\nGive it here. Let me lift it.\nYou don't have to do that...\nIt is a gentleman's duty to lift a lady's burden.\nIf so...\nWhen Leon lifted Beatrice's luggage he felt a familiar energy in it.\nIt's the dragon's energy.\nYes I processed what I received from the black dragon as an exam fee.\nLeon and Beatrice were teaching Black Dragon together.\nLeon learned about hand-to-hand combat and Beatrice learned how to use mana.\nDragonia the god of gold and contracts did not like the situation in which humans teach dragons but admitted that there are very few people in this era who can teach their descendants.\nBeatrice received the exam fee from the black dragon which is a trivial by-product of the dragon.\n“Where do you intend to go with this?”\nIs there a gate I asked for before? It's near Nampo.\nHmm that's pretty far. Stallion.\nLeon summoned the god of light. The white horse is a lofty beast that carries only the Lion Heart King on its back but it unexpectedly gives its back to Beatrice.\nTake Jim's hand.\nLeon climbed into Stallion's saddle and reached out to her.\nGladly.\n* * * *\nover the middle of the Korean Peninsula. If you go down the west coast you will arrive at Nampo the second largest city in North Korea.\nAlthough it is the second largest city in North Korea with a population of nearly one million Nampo City was no different just as Pyongyang fell into the hands of demons and perished.\nThe people who occupied this desolate city were the Kikkiruk tribe who came all the way from Mokpo and occupied the coastal area.\nStrictly speaking Nampo City is not included in the Pyongyang Special Self-Governing City currently being discussed but North Korea is now communist in Muju.\nThe Kiruk tribe who traveled north with Dominator-class submarine carriers annihilated the North Korean navy and occupied the empty city naturally occupied this place as if it were their own city.\nStrictly speaking they are also South Korean residents so it is ambiguous to kick them out even from the South Korean point of view.\nIn the meantime a gate appeared on the coast of Nampo City and Beatrice delivered a pause to the Kirkiruk raiding party trying to clear the gate.\n“I heard it was for an experiment but what exactly is the plan?”\nA gate that appears along the coast of Nampo City. Leon who was helping Beatrice on the sandy beach asked.\n“Are you familiar with Dragon Fear?”\nIt's the energy that the dragon naturally exudes.\n“Yes I felt it the other day when I went through the gate to the Dragonian Empire. Even a few hunters couldn’t move without knowing if they received the protection of strong faith.”\nIt is the energy of the strong that blooms just by existing. The higher the level of existence the more power exists to oppress lower beings.\nIt's not something that can be resisted only by strength so it's like how S-class Hunters or Holy Grail Knights who are similarly strong react differently even if they see the same higher being.\nThe dragon's scales and by-products still retain their aura even after they fall off the dragon. It's also quite powerful.\nexactly?\nLeon who was driving a stake suddenly remembered that there were no kinks around.\nEven when they just landed they had come to say hello to Leon but they hurriedly avoided the seat as if they were uneasy about something.\nDid you avoid the energy flowing from Yongrin?\nYes even those who are protected by the gods want to avoid the dragon's energy. In that case...\nWhat about monsters?\nLeon's eyes lit up at that question.\nWould the monsters avoid the dragon's energy?\nThat's right. That's why I asked you to stop attacking the gate.\nBeatrice deliberately caused a dungeon break and wanted to see how the monsters that popped out would react to the dragon's energy.\nIt's an interesting way. It's an idea unthinkable in Jim's reign.\nIt was natural too. In Leon's reign the dragon was an enemy to be defeated.\nHowever as long as Dragonia entered the pantheon and chose coexistence the dragons to be born in the future must also choose the path of coexistence with Lionheart.\nIf so you should be able to get anything like dragon scales.\nBeatrice foresaw such a future and studied how to utilize the dragon's power.\n“Then since the dungeon break isn’t too far away let’s spend some time here.”\n“Since you came to the sea after all would you like to play?”\nI'd like to refrain from that. Exposing bare skin is embarrassing after all.\nIt was a natural reaction since Beatrice hated swimsuits so much.\n“Is Jim talking about boating?”\nah······.\nA red flower bloomed on Beatrice's cheek at Leon's smirk. However Beatrice soon changed the subject gently.\n“By the way Fleur said to stop His Majesty what were you talking about?”\nAh~ It's nothing special. I've been talking about the Lion Heart King who will succeed me. Biche is also a strong candidate.\n······!\nLeon said it lightly but Beatrice was startled and grabbed Leon's hand.\nNo.\n······Viche?\nBeatrice looked up at him with sad eyes.\nplease. tight.\nHer slender hand was giving it strength as if it were about to run away.",

The agent of the gods the brave King of Knights the one who blessed my knights and saved me from the bondage of corruption.\nPower enters Leon's hand she held. It was to the point where I wondered how such strong power could come out of her slender hands.\nWhere are you going to leave us? Please... please don't leave me anywhere.\n·······.\nLeon realized what Beatrice was so worried about and sad about.\nTo discuss the succession of Lion Heart King. That is Leon gave up his seat as the representative of the gods and headed to the banquet to be with them.\nIt was because many Holy Grail guardians and knights had chosen their successors and ascended to heaven if they did not perish on the battlefield.\nThree hundred years old Bice.\nLeon couldn't just throw an empty check. Leon is an old man who has lived a long enough life and if he had been an ordinary human he would have been reincarnated or headed to the banquet.\nOriginally humans' lifespan is short so they are destined to leave someday so they lived a life of immortality with the love of the gods.\nEven if his life was a repetition of endless struggles and fights Leon was richer than others respected and in an honorable position.\nHe had no regrets about life. He thought that 300 years would be enough for him so he looked forward to the day when he would head to the banquet hall of the gods as did his great ancestors and knights.\nThen when you go please take me with you! I'm also the head priest of the goddess so I'm sure I'm qualified!\nBice... You're still young. Haven't you lived through countless years just repeating it? You'll be here slowly.\nI've never imagined a life without His Majesty. So please...\nLeon was speechless.\nHe knew that parting would come one day.\nBecause he always let others go. He was always a victim of separation from family friends and colleagues.\nSo since he realizes that he will be the perpetrator what can he dare to say?\nFor a long time he could only be silent.\n* * * *\nThe experiment was successful.\nThe dragon's barrier stone installed by Beatrice triggered a dungeon break and stopped the pouring monsters.\nThey were afraid to dare to come out of the range of the barrier stone and only managed to get out when it was time to burst within the narrow radius.\nIn the end the monsters were wiped out at the hands of Leon and Beatrice and the experiment on the by-products imbued with the dragon's energy was the first success.\nThen go in first. Jim intends to look around here.\nyes······.\nLanding in front of the Ryugyong Hotel Leon watched Beatrice for a while who seemed helpless despite the success of the experiment.\n[Leon my knight.]\nGoddess' voice. Leon answered in a voice that was weaker than usual.\nYes my goddess.\n[Your goddess always feels sorry for my knight.]\nHow can you say that?\nLeon was perplexed by the goddess' jade sound. Because even the fact that she made the goddess sad is my fault as a Shinto.\n[I remember you leaving the arms of Ulfric Dragonia and walking the path of wandering. Your goddess has been watching your journey all along.]\nIt must have been around seventeen.\nTrained directly by the Holy Grail Knight Lord Gordic young Leon immediately embarked on a journey of training.\nHow beautiful and sacred the face of the Goddess whom I came to know after several years of traveling was so beautiful.\nLeon remembers the blasphemy of looking up at the goddess in a daze.\n[You accepted my quest and performed it well becoming the youngest Holy Grail Knight.]\nIt was an honor undeserved.\n[However maybe that was my mistake.]\n······How do you say that?\n[Leon. He is my first knight to carry a lion's heart at a young age after Archen. You have lived a life of repeating fights for too long.]\nLeon's life was a series of endless fights.\nAt the age of 17 he embarked on a training course and became a Holy Grail Knight and became the Lion Heart King fighting beasts savages and demons.\nIn the face of the empire's rampage and betrayal they had to point their swords at their old allies and the same human beings had to be buried with blood countless times.\nIn the end even if his family friends servants and people were left alone he continued the war.\nHis 300 years of life is filled only with the dense history of war.\n[Leon. Your goddesses all of us owe you an unrepayable debt. All the souls of the vanishing paradise were able to survive in your steadfastness.]\nThe goddess appeared in a faint form and caressed Leon's cheek. My child whom I had watched for so long forgot happiness all too quickly filling her empty place with memories of steel and blood.\n[Mansin wishes you happiness. Your seat at the top of our banquet is always prepared but I hope that day will be far far away.]\nIf you were to ask if Leon's life wasn't happy Leon would certainly have shook his head.\nI had the love of my life had a child and made friends and colleagues to look up to.\nHe sat on a throne that many looked up to exalted his glory and lived an honorable life.\n“Do you remember the days when I was blasphemous?”\n[It was a time of ignorance rather than disrespect.]\nIt wasn't that Leon had blind faith from the beginning.\nHe was a new soul who died young and was reincarnated in an unknown world a young man who pursued chivalry with romance and fantasy.\nThere was no faith there just a young man obsessed with fantasy.\nI just changed my mind by facing the real God in front of my eyes.\nThere is a saying in the scriptures of this world. He who believes without seeing is true faith.\n[You are not wrong.]\nIn that sense I guess I wasn't a true believer.\n[Who has the right to say that to you?]\nLeon smiled gratefully at the goddess's generosity.\nI'm more calculating than the gods think. I'm no different than any other believer whose heart beat so much at the existence of paradise when he learned of the reality of the gods.\nParadise as described in the Bible a heavenly existence.\nA world full of eternal happiness and abundance. Leon also dreamed of that world.\nLike all followers and knights I have a long-cherished wish for the banquet hall. I also have a desire to face the gods...\nHoly Grail Knights themselves are saints of immortality that do not age.\nA blessed being who can monopolize youth and strength until he dies.\nNevertheless the Holy Grail Knights ascend without hesitation once their successors are decided.\nWe live a different time than the people we love. Eternal youth is even foreign to blend among those we love.\nLeon smiled bitterly. At least if your life partner was an adult like yourself... what about my friends?\nExcept for Antoc who became an Iron Grail Knight Gunlar also became a decrepit tree and looked at the world slowly and Gildus became a grandfather proud of his grandson.\nThe father who passed on many things left telling his young son to come slowly just like his granddaughter.\nIt is natural for children to bury their parents. But what if the opposite happens?\nKarina is truly a filial daughter. I will not die before my father.\nLeon was afraid that Karina would die before him. He shuddered that he would dig and cover the grave of her child with his own hands.\nWhen I found out that the child had become a Holy Grail Knight of Darkness and Vengeance I was very disappointed but thinking about it now it's fortunate.\nAt least Leon's digging of her grave was gone.\nPeople have to go when it's time to go. I've lived too long.\n[·······.]\nLeon walked down the street without saying a word.\nThe demon lord was repulsed. As long as their forces still remain I intend to head to the Demon Realm and annihilate them someday but what will I do after that is over?\nHaving fulfilled his duty Leon simply waits for the next day when the end will come.\nHmm? Your Majesty. Why are you making such a clean face?\nThen I met a knight in red armor. He seems to have just returned with Ha-ri Su-ho and Jae-hyeok all in a mess.\nIs the training going well?\nHmm well other than that.\nKnowing Vulcan's training methods Leon sympathized with the three of them a little. However his training methods are standard.\nIn fact only those who passed Vulcanus' training could join the Baltan Flaming Sword Knights.\n“Your Majesty would you like a drink or two?”\nSudden but not too strange proposal. Leon accepted this without saying anything.\n* * * *\nWhen it comes to Holy Grail Knights anything high-end is the law to use.\nEven for his own dignity this is a natural maintenance cost.\nThe Holy Grail Knights are all promising knights and most of them are from noble families. Even if it is not it is the one who is appointed and becomes the head of a family.\nIn that respect Vulcanus was a foreign being in the upper echelons of the old-fashioned Lionheart.\nIf you do this you'll be able to drink till your nose is crooked by tonight!\nEmpty the big keg! Vulcanus presented. Beer barrels made of stainless steel are not distributed in the private sector even in empty words.\nHave you ripped it whole?\nWhen I asked where they brought beer kegs in their arms the source was unexpected.\n“There are a lot of good things in the houses of party officials or something in this city.\nYou can't change your old habits sir. You're about to become a Holy Grail Knight and plunder.\nLeon spoke calmly as he ate the snacks Vulcan had brought him.\nAt times like this the lower ones are getting fuller. If you're older you should yield to them.\nWar plunder is an opportunity for soldiers and knights to multiply their wealth. Although it should be dedicated to Petos the god of war and flame the tenth structure was not applied instead.\nAt times like these soldiers and knights would buy at least one piece of gold ring to present to their wives or lovers.\nI don't have the manor that His Majesty bestowed on me anymore. I have to work hard to build a villa and find a land to serve as a lord.\nDo you still want Youngji?\nSo! It's fun to harvest the products of a wide territory with a house to lay my body on. I want to have a bigger territory.\nLeon smiled bitterly and did not deny Vulcan's ambition.\nKyung is such a unique savage.\n“GARARARA—the land is power and power. Others don’t know that.”\nGoong! Vulcanus who opened the lid of the keg spilled the beer into the bowl he did not know where he got it from.\n·······.\nIt shouldn't have been opening the beer keg so much... Leon gave up on questioning.\nBy the way Your Majesty. This city called Pyongyang. I heard that Your Majesty does not intend to rule directly.\n“Yes I plan to leave it to the soon-to-be-born Treemen and Elves. This place will become a holy ground for Irmin the goddess who dwells in the World Tree.”\nThe Lionheart Kingdom was reluctant to expand. Although the territory of the kingdom was not small it had the power to expand beyond that.\nThe reason for this was that the Lionheart Kingdom was basically a kingdom only for humans and they pursued a life in harmony with various races such as fairies dwarves and tree men with different lifestyles.\nI'm against it.\nHmm?\nOf course elves and treemen know harmony and balance. They are wise and have a noble spirit that will not betray their faith but can the young ones who are just being born do that?\nHmm...\nWhen the end of the world was almost certain Lionheart later set up an ark plan to recover the factor from Paradise and resurrect the species again.\nAn example is the black dragon which was created by injecting the life force of the saint of life into the element of the dragon.\nThe survival of Leon who kept the paradise in his heart was a prerequisite but there was a problem with the resurrection of the species by that factor.\nIt is said that the newly born are newborn babies who inherited only knowledge.\nThis world Earth is not a very comfortable place. Even if they can grow under Your Majesty's protection it will take time for them to mature.\nWhether it will be one hundred years or two hundred years is unknown. Because both elves and treemen are long-lived species that cannot even be compared to humans.\nSo what? It's natural for their species to leave their growth to time.\nIt's temporary but let's establish a lord.\nA lord?\nThat's right. Isn't your Majesty going to continue to expand? Right now this Republic of Korea has a legitimate owner so even if we leave it alone the central plains in the north will be different.\nWhen we say north we mean the former mainland of China. At Vulcan's words Leon sips his cup and speaks the truth.\nThat place is also a land with an owner. Aren't there dozens of countries claiming to be connecting China?\nGRARARA──! Don't say things you don't mean to say. It's now an unclaimed land that repeats endless chaos and civil war. Are you thinking of pushing it away if there's a justification in your heart?\nVulcanus received reports of Koo Dae-sung's activities in the Heilong People's Republic of China. He gave an example.\nThey're just idiots who can't even protect their own people. Taking over a country in the name of protecting them won't be a big deal!\nYou mean like the Lord's claim to conquer the old empire?\nYes! I think it was Your Majesty's fault for not accepting my proposal at that time.\n·······.\nLeon couldn't deny Vulcan's stern words. In fact the summoning of Malus the lord of chaos that hastened the destruction of the world was the result of the empire's runaway.\nWell let's put it that way. After all doesn't Sir want to become the lord of this city called Pyongyang?\nGRARA──! I won't deny it.\nHowever Sir and Jim are the people who will soon leave for the banquet. Even if they rule the territory how many decades do they covet the land?\n·······.\nFor a moment Vulcan's voice suddenly stopped. Her gaze which had just flashed stared at Leon with a subtle expression.\n“Aside from the fact that I will enjoy a thousand years of wealth and glory?”\n???\n[no!]\nPetos was taken aback by the unexpected remark.",

      "content": "worry\n“Aside from the fact that I will enjoy a thousand years of wealth and glory?”\n???\n[no!]\nNot only Petos but even Leon doubted their ears at Vulcanus' bombshell remark.\nPetos was astonished at having to make this fiery-attribute filial son his agent for ten thousand years.\nNo Mr. Petos. How are you so surprised?\n[Woah enjoying it for a thousand years... I can't believe you will live as a Holy Grail Knight for a thousand years!]\nIsn't it natural to be a living saint if you want to live young and long?\n[this guy! Do you think Holy Grail Knights are a means to stay young!]\nDespite Petos's wrath Vulcanus responded with an ear-piercing arrogance.\nPetos-nim. Where do you think I can get the Holy Grail Knight of War that I am the only one?\n[·······.]\nIt was true.\nIf it weren't for Leon's presence Vulcanus would be considered one of the greatest Holy Grail Knights of all time.\nHis strength is unrivaled to the extent that Leon did not think of Vulcan as his successor for nothing.\nIf a lion's heart is transplanted a holy grail guardian will be born that will not be lacking even compared to the demon lord.\n[Yes it's a problem that you waste so much holy power! They don't even know that the barn is empty and they spread their holy power all over the place!]\nPetos-sama. If I take over the military I will conquer the world.\n[·······!?]\nPetos was silent at Vulcan's bombshell.\nIf I conquer this earth won't Petos's faith overflow all over the place? Only China which is in turmoil right now! Even if I occupy it huh? Can't you hear it? War followers remember!\nDoes Petos believe Vulcan's words are plausible? I thought.\nHaa... Mr. Petos. Don't be persuaded.\n[I was not persuaded.]\nPetos denies being displeased with the fact that he was persuaded by Vulcan.\n[But isn't conquest a necessary process? In order to reestablish Lionheart on this land and spread the proper faith. There should be no country that steps in the footsteps of the empire.]\nThat's right! The lion turmeric who established the Lionheart Empire and his Majesty! Make me the King of the Holy Grail! The lands here in Pyongyang and Taiwan are fine! Give me a villa!\n[You Vulcanus shut up!]\nVulcanus shrugged his shoulders at Petos' scream and retreated. Leon implicitly knew that the gods of the pantheon were sympathizing with him.\n“Are other people of the same opinion?”\n[Well aside from the empire shouldn't we rebuild the kingdom? This Goddess wishes for the rebuilding of Lionheart again.]\nThat's what Leon was thinking. As Vulcan mentioned the land of China today is empty.\nGetting there shouldn't be that difficult.\n“But Sir Vulcanus. What does it mean to enjoy wealth and glory for a thousand years? Sir do you not intend to ascend?”\nGRARARA. As a living saint you have great dragon power and youth. Why do you rush to the banquet hall? I will enjoy all the pleasures in this world.\nHmm...\nLeon put on a puzzled expression. Perhaps it is because among the Holy Grail knights I have never seen anyone who declares that he will enjoy the wealth and glory of this life even after delaying his ascension.\nI knew that Lord Vulcanus had a different temperament than other knights but I didn't know that he would be so different.\nHeh heh is that so? It seems extremely humane.\nSir you need to show more respect for the gods and paradise. How about a theological education after a while?\n·······?!\nAt Leon's words Vulcanus trembled and shuddered.\nWhen Vulcan had just surrendered and served as Leon's squire he learned a lot from Leon.\nAmong them theological education was almost at the level of brainwashing so Vulcanus was greatly freed from the thoughts of evil spirits.\nKuh keuhum... Theological education. It's not even when I was a servant.\nThere is no end to learning. Rather if you a saint continue to study despite your status wouldn't it be an example for others?\nKeep...\nVulcanus hated it and showed a lot of dislike. But Leon is unstoppable.\n“Then I know that you will also participate in the theological education that will be held tomorrow with the articles collected.”\nAh Your Majesty!\nWhen Vulcanus groaned Leon smiled and handed him a drink.\nThere is a way to exempt theological education if you really don't like it.\nWhat is that?!\nPlease join Jim's trouble counseling.\nHo-oh...\nVulcanus quickly drank the Eosaju given by Leon and asked again while wiping his lips.\nSo. What is our Lionheart King's Majesty worried about?\nI've been waiting for the day to go to paradise for a long time. I thought it was not good for one person to occupy the place of the Lion Heart King for a long time.\nIt also played a role in not being able to afford to find Leon's successor right away.\nBecause I tried to preserve the position until the demons were destroyed and the cornerstone of Lionheart's reconstruction was established.\nHowever I have a feeling that neither the gods nor many will welcome my ascension.\nVulcanus fully understood Leon's words. It was hard to imagine what would happen after Leon left even for him who was greedy for the next Lion Heart King.\nBut it's greed. If Leon wants to rest he can. Because he deserves it.\nEven the gods can't deny it. But the gods are not unwilling to lose the greatest Grail Guardian in history.\nYour Majesty the reason you want to go to paradise is because of the Queen of Castile?\n·······.\nLeon poured a glass instead of words with a wry smile. It was a punishment for myself for not being able to answer.\n“Well I understand. Wasn’t it a love so noble and pure that a temple was built on the moon?”\nIs that all he is? Gildus Antok Gunlar... Jim's friends are all there.\nHere Leon is just a king. The mighty lion heart king. Agent of the gods and guardian of the Holy Grail.\nVulcan knew that Leon could be a husband and friend in that paradise free from all restraints.\nIt would be nice. If you go to paradise you will have a wife and friends.\nHeh. Is it because Kyung is rough on making friends?\nWell I blew off one of the arms of a friend I had. I decided not to make friends after that.\nAh~ then that...\nLeon remembered a man. When Vulcan was subdued there was always a man by his side.\nA loyal yet ‘evil' existence.\nWell stop talking about me Your Majesty. Just attach some affection to this world.\nYou think you're giving enough affection?\nYour Majesty's level can't make anyone a friend. It's not like me or Sir Yapi. Or that President Andong-gil is a decent man.\nVulcan holds out his cup. braided! A loud sound rang out.\nHold a woman too. Doesn't Goddess Ariana always say that? If you've been chaste for 200 years Sister-in-law Castile will understand.\nRight now isn't the daughter-in-law also keeping an eye on candidates for stepmother? After all it was his intention to create as many descendants of Lionheart as possible.\nI like it because it's so simple.\n“GRRARA. Your Majesty lives too complicated.\nTheir nagging rang until late in the evening.\n* * * *\nThe home of a party cadre in downtown Pyongyang.\nAfter Mansinjeon occupied Pyongyang several houses were requisitioned and used for welfare purposes and this is one of those requisitioned houses.\nWhoa...\nBeatrice sipped the wine she had sipped from the house of a party cadre who had now disappeared without an owner.\nI heard that it is the poorest country in the world but the quality of luxury goods is higher than expected. It must have been the luxury of squeezing the blood of the people.\nBitter taste...\nAs if reflecting her feelings Beatrice became intoxicated by the bitter taste of the wine.\nThe first time she started following Leon was for the sake of recompense.\nThose who became death knights to support and protect themselves who had fallen into the path of corruption by repeating the past.\nPurify the souls of those loyal knights and enter the path of reincarnation.\nIn order to start the cycle of reincarnation once again Ple who manages the world of the dead by spreading faith on this earth.\nShe was willing to become the priestess of dreams and death and she deservedly assisted Leon.\nHe is arrogant intolerant and authoritative but he is noble just and honorable.\nIf the criminals felt that way too he would have been a dazzling person without any obstacles to Beatrice who was born noble.\n“Was it greed?”\nThere were also things I was hoping for. If he were himself if he was himself if he was superior in beauty strength and pedigree... he would be a quite suitable companion for him.\nHonestly if that's enough... isn't it okay?\n[Well then. There is nothing lacking in the sight of the original woman and her goddesses.]\nIsn't it?\nIf someone had seen it it would have been a drunkard talking to the air and answering questions but to the saintess who is closest to God it is a daily communication with God.\n[He's such a pretty and talented kid but that guy from the wall is...]\nUuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu forgotten even two hundred years later are you?\nFleur tried to comfort the drunk priest but Dina the goddess of the moon giggled.\n[It's enough to kidnap the priest of chastity and hold a ceremony so you should have that level of fidelity.]\n[The moon should be quiet at times like this.]\nFleur covered Dina's mouth.\n[Where would the priest of the original woman fall short? Even if Leon was half like Vulcanus.]\nAriana furious at this said a word.\n[How do dreams make such terrible noises? My knight's supreme purity is also in line with his noble mind.]\nIrmin the goddess of forests and trees clicked her tongue and said to the goddess of light who was busy wrapping up her article.\n[This wouldn't have happened if the light hadn't stubbornly refused to marry the high elves of our forest.]\n[Why is the forest talking about that now?]\nAriana's displeasure from the gods burst out like a flood.\n[My child at the Temple of Lebonia also adored Leon... but the light took away the opportunity to express my feelings.]\n[Life even you!]\n[Isn't the light not condoning polygamy in order to monopolize the authority of the pantheon? The original woman has been curious about that since before.]\n[How can I blame my knight's pure love? My article just kept the idea of ??earthly monogamy intact.]\nWhile the goddesses were arguing Beatrice sniffled and made her own wine.\nJust when the gods were having heated discussions about Leon's new marriage the door opened and the culprit of the situation was revealed.\nyour majesty?\nIt was Leon.\n“Vice why are you drinking alone?”\n······It's just that. Because it's hostile.\n[The priestess of dreams is blatantly revealing her sadness. It's drunk.]\n[Write! Let the light be quiet!]\nLeon sat down next to Beatrice with a light smile on the faces of the goddesses.\nI think the burden made you sad.\nLeon trying to appease Beatrice took away the bottle of wine she was about to pour. When Beatrice gave a puzzled look at this action Leon smiled and said\nIt's not time to pour a glass here. Let's go.\nyour majesty?\nAt Leon's urging Beatrice was bewildered and followed Leon. Outside Stallion was waiting for the two of them and Beatrice climbed onto the saddle led by Leon.\nLet's go Stallion.\nAs Leon stroked the neck of the Shinsoo Stallion flapped its wings and began to fly.\nHold tight.\nAs the cold night wind blew the spirit of drinking had gone but Beatrice still seemed clueless.\n“Your Majesty what are you doing?”\nForgive me first. Viche.\nyes?\nTo the puzzled Beatrice Leon continued his speech in a quiet voice.\nI've lived my duty for a long time. I've fought for 200 years with only the hope of destroying all the demons that destroyed my kingdom.\nLeon honestly confessed that he hadn't thought of what happened next.\nIf the gate to Earth hadn't been opened Jim might have sat there. I didn't know what to do.\nHowever the gate opened and he returned to Earth where he learned that demons existed as well.\nKnowing this Leon was relieved. He said he still had work to do.\nThis fight isn't over yet but after the fight I thought I should ascend to paradise. The more stagnant the water the more it rots.\nYour Majesty... that will never happen.\nWasn't he a knight who had fought for two hundred years and kept his integrity and honor?\nBeatrice couldn't imagine how Leon would change.\nHuh maybe that's the case. There were other reasons too.\nFor other reasons...\nMy friends. The servants and soldiers I am grateful for who have been with me until the end of the glory. And Castile whom I have loved for the rest of my life.\n·······.\nAt the mention of that name Beatrice pursed her lips. For she was the name of a woman whom she could never win even the object of competition.\nWhen my duties are done I consider it the end of my journey to meet them as I ought. Jim looks forward to laughing and talking with them at dinner someday.\nIn the end... are you going to leave alone like that?\nBeatrice buried her face in Leon's back unable to hide her regret. He presses his forehead with his forehead and gives a timid rebuke.\nIt's slowly opening. Look at that.\n???\nIn response her gaze turned to Leon's fingertips. There was a huge world tree and numerous lights were gathering on each branch.\nthat?\nThey're a tribe of the forest. Elves and treemen. They've come to the Old Bible and asked to hurry up.\nIt was a world tree so huge that it could reach the clouds.\nEach of its outstretched branches was long enough to cross half the city and the sight was amazing as the light gathered on the fruit bearing on each branch.\nHundreds of years ago the wise men of the forest who stayed with Lion Heart until the end and became extinct.\nThey didn't give up until the end and entrusted Arrangement to Leon.\nThe Ark Plan and the Ultimate Holy Grail Plan.\nThey could bet everything because they trusted Leon completely.\nThe Moon Chalice obtained by Beatrice at the Gate and the history Leon experienced. Their devotion transcends time and space and was formed by Leon's hands so this must also be a miracle.\nTreemen live several dozen times longer than humans. They protect the harmony of nature throughout their lives and in the end they give everything back to the forest and plant new trees.\nThat is the seed of the sage. The seedling left behind by Gunlar soon became a world tree and is bearing fruit right in front of you.\nThe stopped cycle of life is starting again on this earth after several miracles.\n“Your Majesty... do you want to say that it is natural?”\nBeatrice felt resentful of even Leon saying such a thing. After all he seems to be saying that his ascension is a natural harmony.\nI'm sure it is. It's definitely a natural thing.\n·······.\nBeatrice buried her face. But then-\n“So it takes time.”\nyes?\n“I wonder if I should go against the cycle I deserve.”\nRemembering what it was against Beatrice blinked her eyes. Leon doesn't look back and speaks awkwardly cautiously as if committing a sin.\nGive me a little time. I've lived my whole life believing that. It's not easy to change your mind in an instant.\nyour majesty······.\nCan you wait?\nBeatrice hugged Leon's waist and buried his face tightly. The meaning was obviously different from before.\n-█????███▄▄▄▄!!\nThe resurrection of the species that embraces the light of life continues here and there on the branches.\nknights and soldiers. Everyone who was mobilized to rebuild the city watched in awe for a while.\nIt was an unforgettable night for everyone.",

However even that must have its own conditions: the weather is clear and it must be broad daylight.\nMom what is that?\noh my god······.\nand present. It is a night when the scars of the Second Civil War which had been so painful are being cleared up. Everyone has seen the light.\nA huge tree that stands tall in the capital of a ruined rogue nation. The light of life shining on the endlessly extending branches illuminates the whole world.\nCitizens on their way home from work in the neon signs of the city center\nThe fishermen who hauled in their nets late at night\nThe North Korean People's Army who were active in partisan activities in the unoccupied valley and the ROK Army who were searching for them.\nPassenger planes flying nearby or astronauts rebuilding a crashed space station.\nI saw the bright light that lit up the night sky. The light of life that shines brightly and beautifully.\n* * * *\nWow~ Mom look over there! The tree is so big!\nAfter unification was declared the first tourist visa was issued.\nEven though the entire Korean Peninsula has been incorporated into the South Korean government the reason why a visa is required is that it is nominally South Korean territory but it is also a special autonomous region.\nArrive at Pyongyang Station by train. Those who came from South Korea to Pyongyang could not hide their admiration at the sight of Pyongyang outside the window.\nBranches of a huge tree that has grown to be visible even in Seoul stretched out in all directions and several people passing by there can be seen.\nThe city which was so unindividualized and beaten has become an eco-friendly city surrounded by the mysteries of Mother Nature.\n-Kick! Notice to the passengers who used this Pyongyang Special Line.\nInside the train everyone's eyes are focused when a surprisingly beautiful gray-haired girl starts guiding them with an expressionless expression on the screen.\nThe organic appearance of Yapi which I saw when leaving Seoul five minutes ago was pleasing to the eye even after seeing it twice.\n-30 seconds later this train arrived at Pyongyang Station. A guide is waiting for you so please act according to the guidance.\n-This Pyongyang Special City maintains a legal system similar to the Continental Law of the Republic of Korea but notices that there are more important principles than laws under the Mansinjeon Special Act.\n-Check the tour guide notes again.\nGuides distributed for tourists heading to Pyongyang contained several precautions.\n-No hunting for elves.\n-If you get caught throwing away trash by Tree Man beat your head first.\n- Unconditional respect for those wearing full plates.\n- If you throw food at a dragon you can really die.\nIt was a bloody caution in many ways and it is a matter that is thoroughly educated in the process of issuing a visa in Korea.\nFirst of all it is an autonomous city belonging to the Republic of Korea but Pyongyang Special Self-Governing City is an independent city where the Naju Mansinjeon that is Leon the lion heart of the other world works as a support.\nAs much as they recognized that Lionheart's Kingdom Law is different from Earth's due to the popularity of the Pantheon they must follow Lionheart's rules.\n-Isn't Pyongyang also our land? It's kind of like this in a democracy.\n-Yes if you twist it don't eat the blessed crops.\n-I just wished they had put a hyperloop in Seoul for free.\n- Yes can you go back without the pantheon of Korean economy now? If Yapi-kyung hadn't built a semiconductor factory in Kaesong he wouldn't have dared to absorb and unify North Korea. I unified but the tax doesn't go up hahaha\n-Is it true that you can play 16K 240 frames only with CPU without graphics?\n-Oh just say ? ? ? ? ?\nThe discussion of the Pyongyang Special Self-Governing City has been a subject of intense debate in Yeouido as well.\nThe opposition parties led by President Dong-gil Andong-gil tried to block the establishment of the Pyongyang Metropolitan City by uniting in an alliance to prevent the ruling party from rising in approval ratings.\nMost of all the support of the whole nation was great and the popularity of the pantheon that led to victory after defeating Rakshaar the lord of chaos in the 2nd Korean War was beyond imagination.\n-Honestly isn’t it rather beneficial to have one more holy site inside the Korean Peninsula?\n-Look at Naju. It was a rural village with only rice fields but now it has become an economic city beyond Busan. This is possible because the Byeol Iron Workshop is here for blessed crops.\n-How about Mokpo? The Kikkiruk bring enormous economic benefits without overlapping with humans and habitats. Did you see the diving class made by the Kikkiruk tribe this time? The US Navy ordered 20 ships.\n-What about the pantheonic satellite? Yapi is simply the best.\n- I'm in the middle of tears to attract a pantheon from all over the world. We should be thankful that His Majesty Leon is in Korea.\nNorth Korea was the poorest country in the world more than 100 times poorer than South Korea and the South Korean government which suddenly absorbed and unified North Korea needed enormous financial resources.\nIn order to restore North Koreans' serious level of education and health to a level similar to that of South Koreans huge infrastructure investment was required and the economy needs to be reconstructed over the next hundred years.\nHowever with the existence of the pantheon all these problems could be solved.\nBlessed crops are grown throughout North Korea and nutritional problems are raised. Yapi's cutting-edge planned city and energy supply plan are announced and even development is not a problem.\nMoreover it would not be an exaggeration to say that Mansinjeon was the strongest force in Korea in terms of national defense.\nAh! Mom! They've arrived!\nReally? I didn't even hear it stop...\nThe Pyongyang special line maglev train that Yapi set up to Seoul was able to complete the journey from Seoul to Pyongyang in five minutes and tourists found guides to guide them as they disembarked one after another.\nHello! I'm Ha-ri Han assistant manager of the Korea Hunter Association who was in charge of today's daily tour guide! Welcome to Pyongyang Special Self-Governing City!\nWow~ Hanharari!\nThe youngest S-class hunter!\nTourists cheer when Han Ha-ri the youngest S-class hunter in their country comes out as a guide.\nThey cheered as they left the station following their guide Hari.\noh my god······.\nWow look at that. It's an elf! There's even a dwarf!\nThere are even races that look like real trees!\nA surreal scene where tree men roam the streets beautiful elves serve customers and dragons fly in the sky.\nThe Lionheart's heterogeneous tribes which were born through the world tree for half a year when Pyongyang is being discussed as a special autonomous city of Lionheart are making their nest in this special autonomous city of Pyongyang and achieving the prosperity of the tribe.\nIsn't that... dangerous?\nParents who visited Pyongyang with their children looked uneasy when they saw the massive dragon and the tree men who were far from humans.\nEven modern people who have grown accustomed to the different races beyond the gate were only greeted as monsters.\nNot at all. They are all peace-loving people.\nHari smiled broadly and waved at the tree man passing by. He gave his own welcome to the visit of foreigners.\nLet's go! Then shall we start sightseeing? First take the maglev bus—\nPyongyang tourism organized through travel packages is structured by composition through Yapi's big data.\nFirst the health promotion package.\nIt is a visit and lodging package for the middle-aged.\nYou can stay overnight at the Ryugyong Hotel which was used as the tomb of the World Tree and receive a meal made from blessed crops.\nWow~ This is the blessed crop diet you've only heard about.\nEat everything! I heard this costs tens of thousands of won or hundreds of thousands of won outside?\nand pilgrimage packages.\nIt is a place where you can visit the sanctuaries of the gods built around the world tree and offer prayers to them.\nThe belief in the pantheon was already spreading all over the world and at this rate it would not be long before it stood tall as one of the world's three major religions.\nConsidering that holy places such as Jerusalem the Vatican and Istanbul are always full of pilgrims there are bound to be a lot of people who want to visit Pyongyang the new holy place of the pantheon.\nIf you are lucky you can see the holy relics of Leon and other knights on display so many pilgrims stayed for long periods of time and visited the sanctuary every day.\nThis this is the Holy Grail of Lionheart!\nIt's noble... I feel like my heart is purified just by looking at it!\nThere is also Sir Geobrick's hammer which is said to be used by Sir Koo Dae-seong! It seems that he is not in combat right now. You are lucky!\nThey say the hammer flies by itself!\nThe sacred relics were able to feel the tremendous effect just by encountering them so the pilgrims did not wait for the relic with great energy.\nThe third is the technology travel package.\nPyongyang is a nature-friendly city where branches of the world tree spread throughout the city and formed the residence of elves and tree men but at the same time it was also a huge technological city.\nHigh-tech industrial complexes in nearby cities such as Kaesong and Nampo are nearby and they are mecca of high-tech technology that announces such technologies one after another.\nThere are even rumors that the new product and technology exhibition held in Las Vegas every year will be moved to Pyongyang from this year.\nLook at this VR capsule! It's a real virtual reality you've only seen in novels!\nProject Matrix? It's a cheap name right?\nAnd the full Lionheart package that covers all these packages.\nFrom top-notch Ryugyong Hotel lodging coupons to inter-ethnic exchange events health promotion meals and preemptive use of advanced technology 2 nights and 3 days worth 10 million won!\n-Honestly Yapi planned it all ???\n- Excluded. Really tight-\n[These accounts have been deleted for serious violations.]\nBy the way Pyongyang was becoming a city representing Asia.\n* * * *\nUnder the harsh and relentless ‘education' of Leon and Beatrice the Black Dragon has recently been unscathed.\nFlying was forbidden so he had to learn how to resist magical interference and he had to learn hand-to-hand combat from the Lion Heart King whose power surpasses the physical strength of a gigantic body.\nTo think that he the descendant of the great dragon had to endure such humiliation.\n[How long do I have to endure this humiliation?]\n[Be patient my first offspring. You must keep your position until you become the agent of the contract with the gold.]\nAlthough Dragonia was just born it cared for this black dragon with a lofty spirit like a proud dragon.\n[Thousands of years since our species went extinct. I hate to admit it but I have to admit that Lionheart's Holy Grail Knights are mighty beings.]\nIt's not that the Black Dragon doesn't acknowledge that either. Right now even Karina was able to overwhelm herself who was born as a semi-adult from the beginning and Leon the pinnacle of that is strong enough to get tired of it.\n[Your people are just over ten. It is a self-evident fact that we need the help of the World Tree until we can reproduce sufficiently and spread the species.]\n[But... do I really have to go this far?]\n[It's all for the prosperity of the Balaur. Take it.]\nUntil then there is nothing I can't understand if it means prospering the race under the shadow of the pantheon. There's nothing I can't understand-\nWow! It's a dragon!\nFirst time seeing a dragon...\nIn front of Dragonia Sanctuary God of Gold and Covenant. The black dragon growled ferociously at the sight of the citizens making him a spectacle.\nKyaaak! The dragon must be angry!\nEveryone let's go the other way!\nTourists frightened by the ferocity of the Black Dragon change their course. Dragonia said.\n[My first offspring! How many times has this been! It's an opportunity to spread the faith!]\n[Father is this really the way to show off the glory of the dragon?]\nSanctuary of Dragonia. The Black Dragon who was entrusted with the heavy task of spreading the faith to tourists was crying.\n[Didn't I tell you? Simply making the contract use does not gather much faith. You have to truly serve and respect me to gather quality faith.]\n[still···!]\n[The elf priest in the sanctuary next door is increasing the number of followers day by day so be patient.]\nDragonia was impatient.\nHoly power was needed to continuously create new dragons but it was difficult to cover this with only the Dragonia contract.\nDragons are a species that grows over hundreds of years. If you have to give birth to several semi-adults right away to reproduce and prosper the race then at what age will the race prosper?\nLook at the high elf priest who is selling the faith of the forest and trees right next to you.\nOh you followed Instock? Then would you like to have a detailed consultation at our sanctuary?\nEco-friendly organizations are always welcome! Gee you're running a campaign to protect the lungs of the earth? The treemen at our sanctuary will be happy to welcome you. For now here's an autograph—\n“We the Elves are also worried. Our race has a lot of women. It would be nice to have a chance to interact with a dignified man.”\n[Well look! Such despicable things! It's like attracting males in heat and signing them up for an eco-friendly campaign! Shame on the forest goddess!]\n[What? Can our children date? I am liberal in that respect.]\n[Increasing followers with appearance... what the hell!]\nPetos the god of war and flame attracts the faith of soldiers and hunters around the world.\nNot to mention Demera the goddess of life and fertility.\nPoma the god of the sea and waves prayed for a safe voyage to the Kikkiruk people and all those who make a living by the sea.\nHeto the god of iron and blacksmith has recently been expanding his territory to advanced technology with the resurrected dwarves.\nDragonia a rookie god can't help but feel frustrated when he sees the pantheon gods finding their own way to spread their faith after securing an autonomous city.\nAt least it would be better if we put down our pride and spread our faith from the point of view of ordinary citizens.\nDragons are a noble and lofty race. Unlike the children of other gods how could he dare to bend down and enter lowly humans?\nThis is something we have to get used to through years of education.\nIrmin had a hunch that this newborn god would wander for a long time.\n[The only thing to believe in is the golden contract.]\nDragonia's choice of gold and the sanctity of the contract was by no means a mistake.\nIt's just that propagation is slow because it's still in the transition period but if the world-wide contract spreads it will naturally become the standard contract for planet Earth.\nDragonia saw the distant future and that was a foreknowledge worthy of being called the king of dragons.\nBlack Dragon. Was it here?\nSanctuary of the God of Gold and Covenant. Karina appeared in front of the Black Dragon which failed to sell to tourists one after another.\n[What is it human.]\nThe black dragon still gave Karina a ferocious gaze. Since she puts herself aside and was a Grail Knight of Dragonia she didn't like her.\nIt's a dungeon break. The original work four guys and one more the three of us apply.\n[Who is the one left?]\nKarina shrugged and pointed with her thumb at the green armored knight following her.\nHmm... Mr. Black Dragon. Thank you very much.\nGoo Daesung greeted the dragon with an awkward expression.\n[hmm···!]\nHe was one of my favorite Grail Knights. And-\n[Convince me well. Even one vote from that guy is valuable.]\nThe Holy Grail Knight who has the right to vote for the mayor of Pyongyang Special Self-Governing City which will soon be held.\nIt was a hundred votes.",

      "content": "Pyongyang mayoral election (1)\nAfter Rakshaar blew up the world's satellites the world hurriedly launched communication satellites but even half a year after the war ended there are still satellites that could not be replaced.\nIt is a reconnaissance satellite with a gate detection lens.\nThe development of a reconnaissance satellite for gates which senses magic waves from space to the ground and sends observation information from space to the ground was the best invention for mankind to deal with gates in advance and thanks to this the frequency of dungeon breaks has greatly decreased.\nBefore the Second Korean War there were 3844 Gate Monitoring Satellites floating in Earth orbit.\nThe United States alone has 2000 satellites and economic powerhouses around the world have secured satellites from fever to 30 to have their own 24-hour warning system.\nHowever satellites are being made quickly just because you want to make them.\nThe gate monitoring satellite technology was an original technology of the United States and there was insufficient production to spread it to the world in a short time.\nDue to the lack of supply countries all over the world lined up in the United States to sell surveillance satellites and Korea was also selected as the top priority supply country and six months later only two satellites were received.\nCan't you just buy that technology? Co-producer or something.\nhundreds of meters in the air. Koo Dae-seong communicates while feeling the wings of a huge black dragon. The target is Yafi who oversees the Pantheonden's integrated network.\n- The US government stubbornly refused. Concern about a decrease in monopoly production due to technology leakage.\nThe United States has been reaping significant profits every year from the sale of gate surveillance satellites. Thanks to this satellite technology which is an original technology unique to the United States the rogue countries that were causing trouble in the United States in the 21st century had to bow their heads in front of the United States.\n[Did you just watch the dungeon break happen if you twist it?]\nIn order to prevent the dungeon break you must find the gate as soon as possible and secure enough time to attack.\nThat way even if the advance team fails the next attack team can respond.\nI don't understand. If it's such an important technology it should be publicized and everyone's safety should be pursued.\nKarina was shocked and criticized the attitude of foreign countries.\nIt was the right thing on a human level and Lionheart would have done it.\n‘The bottom line is that there is a big difference in point of view in this area.'\nKoo Dae-seong also sympathizes with him but what can he do when he says he hates countries that possess original technology. The international community is a harsh law.\n-So I tried to steal the technology by hacking but there was a problem.\nHacking... you tried.\nGoo Dae-sung overheard Yapi's calm confession of crime. Yapi was a Holy Grail Knight who used his being above the law too aggressively.\n- No data information. Presumed to keep all information on paper.\nsurely······.\nIf so it explains why continental hackers Iran and Russia have not been able to secure US gate surveillance technology for so long.\n[It is noisy above me.]\nThe black dragon annoyedly cut off the conversation above him. But it must be so. you have arrived at your destination\nThat place is Gaema Plateau... I've never seen it before.\nWho wouldn't?\nat the same time they arrived.\nMonsters poured out at the same time as the cracks in the gate.\n* * * *\nMonsters pour out of the gate.\nThe monsters that came out full because they didn't proceed with the attack were to the extent that they trampled each other and caused a crushing accident.\nA catastrophe that would make one feel even despair under ordinary circumstances. However Koo Dae-seong relaxed and stretched ahead of the waves of the monster.\nWhoa~\nStarting from the shining green star armor the shield of the earth is equipped on the left arm. When the helmet is placed on the head the field of vision is limited.\nThe world seen through the gap of the visor inside the helmet was quite narrow but I got used to it.\ncome.\nAs Koo Dae-sung calls out his name extending his empty right arm a sonic boom pulsates through the air. Experimentally it is a sacred object that returns to its owner even if it travels around the earth.\nIt traveled in an instant from the Sanctuary of Goddess Demera in Pyongyang to Gaema Plateau here.\n- Knock!\nGeobrick's hammer which naturally rests on his right arm. As he prepared for battle Karina looked down from the top of the huge black dragon.\nIt's only an orange gate. It's not a level that can't be solved alone but if it's possible I'll solve it with melee combat.\nyep.\nGoo Dae-seong who had been trained by Karina for the past half year nodded as he fixed the hammer. Soon after a wave of monsters rushes toward Goo Dae-seong.\nThe Dragon Linseok works well.\nThe problem was that once the dungeon break occurred the monsters would spread in all directions.\nIf even one was lost a search team would have to be mobilized.\nHowever the movement route of the monsters is clearly only going in the direction of Goo Dae-seong.\n[joy······.]\nA black dragon that shows an uncomfortable expression.\nThose were the results of the scales and teeth that Leon and Beatrice had ripped off while beating the dragons for the past half year to educate them.\nLimit the movement route of monsters by using Yongrin and Dragon Stone which emit weak dragon fear. In other words it can form a kill zone to concentrate firepower.\nBlack Dragon-sama... are you alright? You're going to exhale blood even if you don't want to.\nDon't worry. Didn't you learn to suppress your energy for half a year? It's time to show the results of your education.\nI don't like it but the black dragon succeeded in suppressing the peer flowing out of me as if to prove the results of training for half a year.\nThen time to work. Let's start with the big one.\nGoo Dae-sung and the black dragon drew in their breath at Karina's instructions.\nBlack Dragon prepared to wield the breath boiling from the inside and Goo Dae-seong concentrated powerful energy on his hammer.\nIn the next moment the Black Dragon's breath was poured into the monsters regardless.\nThe black breath disappeared without leaving a single bone fragment of the monsters and hundreds of them were annihilated in one blow.\nOf course it was a mighty breath that burned up the grass and natural features of the plateau.\nHuh...!\nLikewise Goo Dae-seong's hammer strikes at a group of monsters.\nHis hammer strikes which he plunged several tens of meters into the middle of the enemy group were as fierce as if he had concentrated the energy of the whole world.\n-Quaaaaaang!!\nGreat destruction ensues. Rumble! The floor collapsed with a groan and shockwaves spread all over the place.\n[Keukkeuk that's not bad.]\nThe great destruction caused by the two creatures of super power wiped out the monsters poured into the dungeon break.\nHalf of the monsters that poured from the orange gate were annihilated in one fell swoop.\n“Tsk isn’t the damage to nature too serious?”\nIt took less than ten minutes to clean up the dungeon break.\n* * * *\nThank you for your effort!\nIt was a beautiful elf wife who approached Goo Dae-seong who had finished the dungeon break.\nIt was an elf guerrilla who came to gain practical experience but thanks to Goo Dae-seong and Black Dragon's overwhelming performance there was no need to go out.\nOh thank you.\nKyung Dae-sung Koo! Thank you for your support!\nGoo Dae-seong blushed and smiled awkwardly at the benevolent gaze of the elf wife.\nIn general the different races created by the World Tree were so friendly to Goo Dae-seong. This is because they know that the mighty vitality of Koo Dae-seong contributed to the birth and resurrection of their own species.\nDon't get too excited Sir. He's only a year old.\nI-I didn't think of that!\nKarina says something to Goo Dae-seong who blushes at the elf's beauty. The elf girl responded by twisting her fingers.\nThat's right I was born as an adult.\nIsn't it to accelerate the growth of the species for the rapid prosperity? You guys need to study and learn more about the world.\nI know that Sir Koo Dae-seong is a good enough person. He is the one who took care of the forest on Bald Mountain around Pyongyang.\nElves and Treemen are the servants of Irmin the goddess of forests and trees.\nFor those who tend to the forest since birth and live a nature-friendly life North Korea's attic and deforestation are a terrible sight that instinctively angers them.\nSouth Korea also focused on the greening project by making Arbor Day but North Korea went beyond that level and was unable to restore it at all.\nGoo Dae-seong personally blessed the land for the elves and tree men who were stressed just by looking at the cold bare mountains and thanks to this many bare mountains in North Korea returned to their pre-1950s.\nBecause Koo Dae-seong is a ‘friend of the forest'.\nTo such Goo Dae-sung the elves and tree men gave him the title given to the most respected friend in their knowledge.\nGoo Dae-sung a friend of the forest. He and his descendants will be treated as friends of elves and treemen everywhere.\nIt was truly a deep favor that would last for generations.\n“By the way Sir Koo Dae-seong! Are you not running for mayor this time?”\nGoo Dae-seong shook his head at the elf wife's question.\nOh I'm overwhelmed just by training. There are many people who are better than me so how can I!\nAt Goo Dae-sung's words the black dragon's gaze flashed.\n[Hey Koo Dae-sung. Then give me your vote—-]\n-Quaaaaaaaaaa!!\nIt was then. A powerful fire that raises the temperature of the ground. The presence that scatters red flames in the sky is clear.\n“Why did that person come here again?”\nKarina's question and the trajectory of the simultaneous flame landed exactly where they were.\nGRARARARA!!\nOf course only Vulcan the Holy Grail Knight of War and Flame can do such a thing.\nHe approached exhaling sparks and spread his trusty arms.\nKoo Dae-seong! Looks like the work is over!\n“Boo Sir Vulcanus? Ah yes... What are you doing up to here?”\nGRARARA!! Do you have something to do between us? Let's have a drink together! I recently discovered the secret wine cellar of the chief escort!\nVulcanus pulled Koo Dae-sung's shoulders with his mighty arm. Even though Koo Dae-sung is the same Holy Grail Knight he did not have enough time to refuse the hand of the long-awaited senior.\n[·······.]\nThe black dragon watched him blankly. Karina shrugged her shoulders.\n“If you just stare blankly at it you will lose helplessly.”\nKarina's advice alerted the black dragon enough.\n* * * *\nI plan to elect the mayor of Pyongyang soon.\nThat's what Leon said at a meeting at which Pyongyang decided to enter a stabilization trajectory and accept tourists.\n-Kick?\nYou mean the mayor of Pyongyang? Isn't His Majesty in charge?\nLeon shook his head when Beatrice who had heard the story asked back thinking that Leon might be in charge tentatively.\nI must work hard to rebuild the Lionheart kingdom. Although it is an autonomous city Pyongyang is definitely a land belonging to the government of the Republic of Korea.\nIt is a law that the king cannot enter under the king. Leon announced that even such a formal relationship could not come under the umbrella of President Ahn and the government.\nOriginally I wanted to entrust it to the revived Treemen or Elves. It's probably where the forest and tree goddesses descended directly.\nDue to the World Tree many different races of Lionhearts were being revived. This will be their city so it would be natural for them to assume the autonomy of the city.\nHowever according to Lord Vulcanus' opinion they are too young. Although they were born as adults after receiving knowledge they are not enough to assume the position of leader.\nTherefore it is to select a mayor who will temporarily take charge of Pyongyang. Leon emphasized ‘temporary' but everyone here thought that it could possibly be ‘permanent'.\nHey Your Majesty. Do you have any qualifications to run?\nChun So-yeon raised her hand. She is a citizen of the Republic of Korea and she wondered if they had the right to do so at a young age.\nAs the youngest Knight Commander she seemed quite satisfied with the power of the leader of the group and secretly hoped that power would expand.\nOf course. And I'll set aside the right to vote.\n“The right to vote?”\nAt those words Hari Jaehyuk Suho and other knights from Earth nodded their heads.\nFor those who were born in a democratic country the right to vote was a given right at birth.\nThe right to run is limited to knights or higher. Those who do not have a noble status cannot enjoy the glory of ruling.\nEek...\nBeing a knight class means that even elves dwarves and treemen who are treated as ordinary free people do not have the right to run.\nIn the first place it was seen as inappropriate for young people to do politics so it was a natural step.\n[Doesn’t the Balaur have the right to run?]\nThe black dragon who had been listening with his face pressed against the window of the meeting room asked a question. Behind them dragons born in the last half year prick their ears with curious eyes.\nNo the dragons will be given the right to run. I believe that your intellect is no less than that of ordinary citizens.\n[joy! Of course!]\nIt may be racial discrimination but dragons take it for granted and Leon admits it so who can dispute it?\nSorry. Will this vote be held again next time?\nThe High Elf Naru the priestess of the forest and trees felt sorry for them but honestly admitted their immaturity.\nShe and the new races are long-lived species who are likely to stare at the vote a hundred years from now so the position of mayor right now is not such a regrettable position.\nI'll hold off until Jim decides. First of all stabilization is urgent.\nI see. Then what about the right to vote? Even though we are young don't we have the right to vote for the mayor who will lead us?\nLeon nodded his head at the opinion of the young high elf priest. Of course he has also prepared for the right to vote.\nEach free people will have the right of one vote.\nThis is a common concept in a democratic country. The problem is-\nFive votes for priests. Five votes for chivalry and kingdom knights. Ten votes for veterans. Twenty votes for knight commanders.\nEh?\nHari felt a fight but Leon is not interested in ‘equal democracy'.\n“The Holy Grail Knight and the priest have the right to vote equivalent to one hundred votes.”\nTea discrimination?!\nA word from Suho that he couldn't even swallow. But while no one dared to question the unfairness the black dragon asked.\n[The dragons! How many branches does the Dragon Mark have?]\nTwenty votes. Considering the small number of individuals and the size of the power I upgraded it so be grateful.\n[Chit...!]\nFinally Leon said.\nThose who want to run must express their intentions by next week. That's all.\nElection to decide the mayor of Pyongyang Special Self-Governing City.\nThere was no democracy or anything.\nYour Majesty! How many votes do you have...\nHarry's urgent question. Leon calmly continued his violence against democracy.\nThe one Jim chooses is the mayor.\n‘Weren't you interested in democracy from the beginning?!'\nWhere is this shit balance election!\nThe astonishment of the citizens of the democracy continued but fortunately Leon declared that he would not participate in this election.\nIn that way a total of three candidates ran for the position of mayor of Pyongyang Special Self-Governing Province.\nVulcanus the Holy Grail Knight of War and Flame.\nIron and Blacksmith's Grail Knight Yakt Spinner.\nA black dragon the first descendant of Dragonia the god of gold and contract.\nThe first democratic election in Lionheart's history began like this.",

Are you coming back after a workout?”\nBice.\nBeatrice seeing Leon with a happy face ordered the serf rickshaw to speed up.\nAside from the irrationality of a person having to match the speed of a horse walking.\nHow can you use lowly things as means of transportation. What about words?\nIt's not true recently but my horse has a foal. I think I'm going to go around like this for a while.\nOops. I'll order my subordinates to make a wagon at least.\nJust get on the car... The rickshaw serf thought to himself but he's not stupid enough to say it out loud.\nBy the way Your Majesty. About this mayoral election.\n“Are you interested in Viche too?\nI'm not a bureaucrat and I'm not interested in electing a lord.\nBiche are noble royalty. For her it was a surprising idea to select a position equivalent to that of a lord who governs her region as her elected position.\nEven if she understood the system of democracy in this world with knowledge it was difficult for her to accept it.\nIt is insulting that she the magician queen of the Kingdom of Spero and the priest of dreams and death has the same decision-making authority as one freedman on the street.\nIt's kind of entertainment.\nIs it entertainment?\nThe city's managerial position is a necessary position. Because there must be someone who is responsible for everything.\nThat is the way to govern the people. The seat of those who take responsibility and fulfill their responsibilities.\nIt has become incomprehensible to Leon who served as the king of Lionheart to decide such a position by vote without knowing his ability.\nWell let's see. It might be a fun spectacle.\nLeon had no intention of running in this election.\nBut I was curious to see what kind of fights the candidates for power would have.\nAren’t democracy and elections essentially a fight to pull each other out of the mud?\n* * * *\nGRARARA!! That guy can't drink!\nha ha ha······.\nGoo Dae-seong was drinking heavily with Vulcanus and the Knights of the Burning Sword.\nRegardless of whether holding onto an oak barrel in which Scotch was aged and drinking it in one gulp is a proper drinking problem.\n‘Recently strangely everyone treats me well.'\nAfter becoming a Holy Grail Knight Knights from Lionheart are basically friendly to Goo Dae-sung.\nThey had enough respect and courtesy for the honorable successor of Geobrick and rather they behaved so harshly that Goo Dae-seong was burdensome.\nBut respect and friendship are different things.\nGoo Dae-seong is not an angular personality but it was not easy to get along with these knights with a strong medieval sensibility.\nVulcanus even so Baltan Flaming Sword Holy Grail Knights were busy hanging out with each other.\n“Sir Koo Dae-seong! How does the alcohol taste!\nLoots...\n“GRARA! It looks like it was a secret warehouse for someone who does tin or something.”\nIf it's Joo-soo... Could it be Mr. Kim?\nAside from Goo Dae-seong's surprised eyes Vulcanus cheerfully handed him a drink and chewed on snacks.\n“By the way Daeseong Koo. I have something to ask you.”\n‘Wow it's here!'\nA recent approach toward yourself. Precisely the active movement of Vulcanus and Yapi was for this very purpose.\nHey this election. Who are you going to vote for?\nThat that's...\nGoo Dae-seong could not hide his embarrassment at the knights who pricked up their ears while pretending to drink.\nPyongyang mayoral election.\nThere are three candidates running in that election.\nVulcan Yapi and Black Dragon.\nAt first glance they look like outstanding candidates but they are candidates who start off with a lot of fraud.\nBoth Vulcan and Yaphie as Holy Grail Knights each had the right to cast a hundred votes and ten dragons including the Black Dragon himself shared two hundred votes.\nIn this situation each of the candidates moved busily to secure their supporters and among them Koo Dae-seong who has 100 votes is the first candidate to be recruited.\nThat... First of all voting in our country is a secret ballot...\nHuh? Didn't I tell you? His Majesty said there was no such thing as a secret ballot.\nYes?\nIt's not some kind of communist general election it's a public vote?\n“I heard that Grand Duke Karina and Queen Beatrice do not participate in the vote.”\nThe Holy Grail Knights who had the right to vote for a hundred votes did not step forward. then······.\nIsn't Lord Vulcan's victory a foregone conclusion?\nVulcanus has veteran knights the Burning Sword Knights as his supporters.\nEach of them had 10 votes so a total of 50 people got 500 votes.\nThe current clear supporters are:\nvulcan.\n100 votes for myself and 500 votes for the Knights of the Burning Sword.\nYapi.\nMy 100 votes.\nblack dragon.\nMy 20 votes. 180 votes of the nine dragons.\nAs such the base of the basic supporters is different. However Goo Dae-sung thought differently.\nThere are 637 free people with voting rights in Pyongyang including elves dwarves and treemen.\n637 votes for each of them.\nIt's quite a bit more than I thought.\nHowever it is very small compared to the population. 637 members of different races are on the same level as 50 Knights and 1 Holy Grail Knight.\nThen the core is the Naju Knights. Our Mansinjeon has trained 357 Knights so far and there are now five Knights from Naju.\nAs far as I know most of them are deployed externally.\nYes three with Cheon So-yeon and the 1st Knights 3rd Knights and 4th Knights! There are a little more than 150 knights under the umbrella.\nSo about 750 votes.\nVulcanus has already secured 600 votes but it is a figure that can be overturned depending on the actions of other candidates.\nI see. But that's it wouldn't it be great if Lord Vulcanus campaigned well?\nIt's like a promise or something. But Vulcanus shouted in exasperation.\nI thought so too! If only the wicked robot hadn't done anything mean!\nYes? Sir Yapi?\nSeeing is worth a thousand words! Come with me! I'll show you what that sinister robot is up to!\nVulcanus led Koo Dae-seong to the Ryugyong Hotel.\n* * * *\nElections are about how many votes you get.\nTo do this he must meet voters encourage them to vote and direct their votes to him.\nIt is a basic concept in democratic elections but it was an unfamiliar concept to candidates running for the Pyongyang mayoral election this time.\nComing from the authoritarian hierarchical society of the medieval kingdom Vulcanus also understands the concept of rallying his supporters but does not intend to go beyond that.\nBlack Dragon is also supported by dragons of his own kind but it just stops there.\nThe knight... even more authoritative than the Lion Heart King Black Dragon rejects the notion of attracting voters.\nHowever Yakt Spinner the thoroughly calculating second candidate is a survivor from a world relatively close to democracy.\nHe understood the concept of attracting votes very well.\n-Kick!\nIn front of the Ryugyong Hotel where the floating population of residents and drivers is the highest. People focused their attention on the large-scale parade.\n-Kick! Giggles!\n-Kick! Giggles!\nThey are Krashatria. Although they are treated as residents of Mokpo and Nampo rather than citizens of Pyongyang in this election and do not have the right to vote there is no law prohibiting them from helping with the election campaign.\n“Why are you Sir Yapi and the Kirkkiruks doing that?”\nWow~ Mom! Look at that! It's a robot!\nHundreds of Kikkiruk campaigners and colorful and stylish machines ranging from barons to counts carry placards and displays to campaign for the election.\n[Yapie to the market!]\n[Make the world tree even greater!]\n[Harmony between advanced technology and nature. It's up to Yappy's hands!]\nA placard that will become familiar around the time of the presidential or general elections. For Koo Dae-sung who grew up in a democratic country campaigning during the election period was nothing special.\nThat... doesn't seem like a problem?\nThey are attracting attention with the Krashatria tribe and state-of-the-art weapons and campaigning but isn't that a means that the candidate can mobilize as it is?\nRather Vulcanus who did not declare pledges or campaign was an apostle to Koo Dae-seong.\nIf it's just me I won't say anything! Look at that! The Q-A link on those placards!\nuh?\nKoo Dae-seong saw placards and QR codes embedded in displays carried by unmanned robots and quirks.\nI want to do something so when I recognize it as a smartphone a community pops up.\nIt must have been a closed network made public right after the Pyongyang mayoral election was announced. Only Pyongyang citizens and drivers can access after authentication.\nIt was used as a communication channel for the convenience of residents and drivers.\n[Shock! Excessive plundering by the Knights of the Burning Sword.]\n[The dragons' ‘inferior species' statement. The arrogant attitude of not facing citizens.]\n[Lord Vulcan's successive drunken songs. Is it okay like this?]\nThe titles that appeared on the main page of each community were blatantly undercutting the candidates for this run.\nAt the same time the explanation of Yapi's superior campaign promises and plans reveals who the manager of this community is.\nYes negative strategy...\nThis is common in elections. Putting down the other party inflicting all sorts of slander forcing them to give up voting or making the other side benefit...\nNo we can go through the houses of those who have already died and loot them! What's wrong with that!\nAnd Yapi's negative strategy was definitely true.\nWith the capture of Pyongyang it became the natural privilege of knights and man-at-arms to plunder Pyongyang where all the wealth of North Korea was stored.\nIn the process it is also true that Vulcanus and the Knights of the Burning Sword who can be said to be veterans of plunder actively robbed the houses of party officials and accumulated wealth.\nSeriously even Leon would have demanded restraint saying ‘Let's eat in moderation so that the young knights and soldiers can take their share.'\nAfter that although he refrained from looting by occupying only one party official's house Yapi emphasized these incidents and undermined his qualifications as the leader of Vulcanus.\nUmm... There are more people who agree than I thought. In particular the Naju Knights seem quite dissatisfied.\nAnonymity was guaranteed within the community but the newly resurrected races are not yet familiar with smartphones.\nMost of the Knights and Man-at-Arms responded by commenting.\nKkeuh! That's why I taught you the rules of plunder and even taught you how to rummage for hidden wealth!\nWell... looting is a bit of a strange thing for a decent citizen-state to come from.\nDaesung Koo himself was not very active in looting.\nThere's also a problem with dragons... it's not true. They're a little less aggressive than Lord Vulcan but I guess that's because they don't see them as competitors...\nHmph! Where else would those arrogant lizards get support other than themselves?\nThis was not the only thing that angered Vulcan.\nIt's okay to accuse me of being a looter. It's true. But...!\nVulcanus took Koo Dae-seong and headed behind Yapi's tent during the election campaign. And there-\nHehe Sir Yapi. I brought my younger brother and juniors!\n-Kick! Giggles! Chirukki look!\n(Sir Han Ha-ri. 20 votes. Voting encouragement Han Su-ho and five knights. 35 votes. Total 55 votes confirmed.)\nThe Kikkiruk election support team scribbles something while looking at the articles Hari brought.\nHe took out the boxes piled up in the election tent and handed them to Hari.\nWow~ Old X bag! Louis X Tong wallet! Do you have a gift certificate? Star iron armament custom additional equipment order ticket? This is really jackpot?!\n-Clucking!\n(Please take good care of our yappy candidate)\nSure~\nHari smiled and brought presents when Vulcanus and Koo Dae-sung met eyes.\nAh Sir Vulcanus... Sir Koo Dae-seong...\nThe stopped girl quickly turned her back while wiping cold sweat from her forehead.\n·······.\n·······.\nThe dirtiest election in the world was being held calmly.",

      "content": "Pyongyang mayoral election (3)\nGoo Dae-sung a democratic citizen was shocked by Yapi's tyrannical negative strategy and bribery strategy.\nDid you see it! How can I not be angry when they openly spread bribes like that!\n“Uh um... tell His Majesty——”\nHis Majesty refused to intervene saying that he was also on his own!\nLeon didn't particularly want fair elections.\nIf we had thought of fair elections in the first place we would not have given voting rights based on social status.\n‘Anyway this is a bit...'\nI can understand the negative strategy. It's not because I made up words that aren't true.\nHowever such an outright bribery attack...\nKikluk! What is it?\nIt was then. What a gray-haired pretty girl entered the campaign tent where dirty tricks were being practiced.\nHey Sir Yapi...!\nGu Dae-seong. Vulcanus.\nNo Sir Yapi outside...\nIt's a hologram.\nI didn't notice at all. Koo Dae-sung presumed that the technology Yapi was hiding would be beyond imagination and it was true.\nWhy... are you campaigning in the body of a girl?\nShe looks like a beautiful girl and even has makeup on and her beauty is dazzling. Yappy who usually claims that the organic body is inferior is active with an organic body that he did not even take out well?\nTo Koo Dae-sung's innocent question Yapi answered with a shrug.\nOrganism. Weakness to beautiful things. In terms of the aesthetic standards of organisms they favor pretty and cute appearances more than ugly ones.\nah······.\nI was at a loss for words because it was such a standard answer.\nSir Yacht Spinner!\nVulcanus strode toward Yapi. He was Goo Dae-seong who was frightened to be hit by one but his big palm held a smartphone.\nThis is not too much!\nWhat is it?\nYou're portraying me as an unscrupulous bastard over some loot!\nIt's true. And there are a lot of sympathetic comments.\nIsn't everyone doing it to unify public opinion and raise morale by plundering the property of those who lost in the war and adding it to their families!\n“I don’t think so.”\nAt Vulcan's unconventional medieval remark Yapi blinked in denial.\nI believe that all property belongs to the pantheon and must go through a fair distribution process.\n“Even His Majesty has allowed it!”\nVulcan protests saying that he only did what he should have done. Either way Yapi has no intention of stopping negative.\nWhen this side's logic was dismissed Vulcan attacked in another direction.\nSir Spinner. What are these bribes!\nNot a bribe.\n‘Shameless!'\nKoo Dae-seong is a yappy who lies without changing his expression. Does that condescending blood remain unchanged even after acquiring the body of an organism!\nThis machine is to do good deeds to support the welfare of citizens. It is not enough to receive thanks.\nHey Sir Spinner! You! I can promise you the same for Man-at-Arms!\nThe low-key kids are not eligible for welfare. Kiruk!\nIt's nasty. Nasty but effective is undeniable!\nYapi promised to vote by giving luxury goods and gift certificates as an advance payment and when the vote was over he eliminated any room for other feelings with the right to manufacture iron arms.\nIt was a tragedy caused by secret voting the principle of democratic voting and primitive voting without prohibition of payment.\nThis will not be enough Sir Spinner! Sir will only fail!\nDespite Vulcan's command Yapi calmly and calmly responded.\nOrganisms can do as the original spirit tells them to do. It's enough to greet the utopia by the original spirit.\n-Kick! Giggles!\n-Kick! Squeak!\nWith the help of hundreds of kikkiruk Yapi confidently left the tent.\n* * * *\nIt is said that setting rules for fighting is to take advantage of things that are not set by rules.\nIt's not entirely wrong but what if it's a fight without rules?\nUnlike modern democracy which has been accumulating forms and rules for over a hundred years eliminating irregularities as much as possible and subsidizing the system the Lionheart-style election which unsparingly reveals the capabilities of candidates as they are fell into abyss in an instant.\n-Don't leave the city to savage and greedy tin thugs!\n-Symbol number 1 Vulcanus said something to Petos. he's a stupid guy\nHonour is everything! Humans should only be ruled by humans!\nThat gloomy bastard the account that curses himself is beating the moderators! Don't give in to such a dictator!\n- Let's vote!\nVote!\n-For good politics!\nFor the right leader!\n-Kick! Squeak! Squeak!\nVulcanus! Vulcanus! Vulcanus!\nIt was a muddy election campaign with primary negatives and followers.\nWhile the two candidates competing in the city of Pyongyang were trying to pull each other down in a close game there were two unexpectedly important figures in this election.\nThe first is the Holy Grail Knight Koo Dae-sung.\nHe himself is also a voter with a whopping 100 votes but there are many people who show a crush on him and fully follow him.\nThese are the free people of the special city of Pyongyang. Elves dwarves and treemen born from the World Tree.\nMany people knew that Goo Dae-sung contributed to their resurgence by squeezing out infinite vitality so there were even people who came to ask him about who to vote for in this election.\nGu Dae-seong was embarrassed and sent him back to choose a reliable candidate for himself but the free people who had the right to vote still paid attention to Gu Dae-sung's opinion which became the reason both Yapi and Vulcanus tried to recruit him.\nAnd if not as much as Koo Dae-sung there was a person who unexpectedly became a key card-\nUnworthy!\n[·······.]\nSymbol number 3 Black Dragon's campaign tent found by Vulcanus.\nAlthough they are receiving election support from the nine dragons Vulcanus came to them who did not receive much support.\n[Reasonable... is that a word?]\nThe dragons frowned in front of Vulcanus and the following members of the Burning Sword Knights such as Raihar and Galatan.\n[Are you saying give up the election and go under you guys!]\n[Tin cans...! What is the dragon's pride!]\nThe dragons were indignant but rationally saw the offer as worthwhile.\nThe situation is a one-sided onion battle with symbols 1 and 2. On the other hand the only supporters of the black dragon were the dragons.\nOther freemen and knights could not easily gather around the ferocious and ostracizing Balaur.\nIf so I have no choice but to go under one of the two candidates and propose a plan to divide power by targeting even the most influential person in the election.\nIt is difficult to play the role of a decisive kingmaker as much as Koo Dae-sung.\n[Two hundred votes for all of us. Are you aiming for that?]\nHmm! Two hundred makes sense but maybe more! Or something that's dormant now.\nAt Vulcan's words Black Dragon guessed what he was thinking of.\n[Karina. Dragon God's Holy Grail Knight said he wouldn't vote?]\nWell maybe I'll change my mind again when I go then.\nOne hundred marks. In this way you can expect up to 300 votes generated while being worthy of the black dragon.\nLeon or Beatrice would not participate in the vote even if it was because of the pride of the royal family but Karina was more open-minded than the previous two.\n“If you accept the right party I will create a position as a city councilor and prioritize you dragons.”\n[·······.]\nVulcan's offer was attractive. At least now considering their inferiority reasonableness was indispensable.\n-Kick! I'll make a reasonable offer.\nYapi also made the same proposal and it could be said that the price of Black Dragon skyrocketed.\n[I can't help it. my first offspring Even if you chew on the bitter taste of defeat this time I think it would be better to use this experience as a point of calculation.]\nEven Dragonia urged Black Dragon to join the party.\nbut.\nBut... are you really okay with that?\nYou seem to be in a lot of trouble.\nCarina was smiling as if she had noticed the black dragon's change of heart. She would sometimes snoop on her face during Black Dragon's campaign campaign to see how things were going.\nAlthough that raised suspicion from Vulcanus that Karina was intervening in this election.\n[What.]\n“No because crawling under one of them like this isn’t a bad option either.”\n[Are you insulting me!]\nIsn't that realistic in the current situation?\n-Kreu...!\nThe black dragon threatened Karina with a ferocious breath but she was not a heroine who would back down at the mere gnawing sound of a young dragon.\n“Well even if you look like this you are the body that will become the Holy Grail Knight of the Dragon God. I can give you my own advice.”\n[You dare?]\nHaa~\nKarina thought it was not easy to deal with arrogant races from her birth.\nWell since he had such a bloated ego he must have thought of fighting the gods.\nThis work was an emperor who ruled an empire. But he did not become a good politician.\nEmperor Carina Dragonia. She was just a being who reigned with overwhelming power.\nOfficials and nobles obeyed her in fear and she only had to command with a chin.\nThere is another politician that this work thinks is ideal. If you want you can listen to his advice.\n[no way······.]\nNeedless to say about the politician Karina introduced.\nSo do you want to teach me?\nLeon. He looked down at the disciple who was not the disciple he taught for half a year.\n[How to do it...]\nBlack Dragon thought a lot while watching the election battle between Vulcanus and Yapi.\nIn this election where they bite each other tear each other down and that their role is nothing other than a worthy card that gives one side an advantage.\n[Their supporters are solid and I hate to admit it but... they are more political than me. To be honest even if I accept the invitation from one side... it's not a vote that can't be overturned.]\n·······.\nLeon thought that he had grown a lot by watching the black dragon honestly tell him about his shortcomings.\nWhere is the dragon who was arrogant with his pride and now there is only a failed political newbie wet with a sense of defeat.\nIt's such an unexpected entertainment experience.\n[I am serious.]\nDragonia's first offspring. Why did you think you would take up politics the mayor's office?\n[To raise the glory of the dragon and the name of Dragonia the progenitor.]\nIt simply means that the title was needed for honor.\n[Is it wrong?]\nYeah that's wrong.\n[what?]\nBecause you don't see the essence of politics.\nLeon knows that this young dragon has an immature mind unlike his lofty pride. But a dragon is a dragon.\nHis intellect which is overwhelmingly superior to that of ordinary humans is an excellent student who can learn ten with just a little teaching.\nWhat is democracy?\n[Isn't it to elect an elected position through voting?]\nYes the most successful political institution on the planet.\nDragonia thought Leon's candid impression was surprising.\nThe lion heart king in front of me is the owner of a lofty pride that surpasses even the dragon. Isn't he a superman who claims to be a being chosen by God and representing God?\nAs a living example of the divine right of kings it is surprising even as a black dragon that he is unexpectedly favorable to the system of democracy.\nCriminals gather votes among criminals to elect their representative. The representative is also a mediocre person in the end but all human beings have similar abilities so no matter who they bring in they will produce similar results.\nThat may be the strength of democracy. It's because it's not a big failure anyway.\nIt's fortunate that out of the mediocre people it's a good idea to represent someone who's exceptional.\n[Are there other problems?]\nThe problem is that ordinary things are only talked about with their mouths. They change their policies and overturn the words they have spoken out of their own accord by factions and conscious of the votes of their supporters.\nNot to mention corruption. Things that Lionheart couldn't even imagine happen calmly here.\nLord Vulcanus Lord Yapi and even your young dragon are different from ordinary people. They are beings who were born as superhumans and transcend the world.\nSo there is no need for any restrictions. You just have to have a sense of humor.\n“Lord Vulcan and Lord Yapi are mistaken that Jim threw away the shell of democracy. After all politics is something you have to do on your own terms.”\nLeon managed to say a word of thanks to the admirable candidate who had come to seek advice from him.\nTell the people what kind of politics you want to do. Tell the citizens of your foundation that can transcend public opinion and bribery.\nThat is the politics of iron men.\nBlack Dragon went back to the election camp thinking about Leon's advice.\nAs the election approached the three-way debate between the candidates for the mayoralty of Pyongyang was widely announced and the three candidates gathered in front of less than a thousand citizens of Pyongyang.\n-Who will win? Is it Sir Yapi who is also on the offensive?\n- Sir Vulcanus is not formidable. 600 votes for the Burning Sword Knights and myself alone.\n-Aren't His Excellency Karina and Her Highness Beatrice participating?\n-Which candidate will the Black Dragon ally with?\nCitizens naturally picked Vulcanus or Yapi as the next mayor during the campaign.\nThe third candidate the black dragon only gave one candidate an advantage by adding up the dragons' votes but no one thought that the black dragon would reverse this unfavorable charter.\nThen symbol number 3 Black Dragon! Please tell us your aspirations as a candidate for mayor of Pyongyang!\nWhen the host passed the baton Black Dragon pondered for a while and looked at the crowd.\nand.\ndeclare\nUnlike the two candidates who tried to gather votes somehow by cutting each other down.\nhis sincere political aspirations.\nit is-\n[I will do politics for the common people.]",

      "content": "Pyongyang mayoral election (4)\nPolitics for the common people.\nAt the Black Dragon's remarks everyone gave a puzzled look.\nCompared to the negative strategy and the money-spin election so far I even felt the freshness of the story which was even theoretical but it was due to the fact that the subject of the remark was none other than the Black Dragon.\nAn arrogant and arrogant race.\nIt was because those who did not hide it even from Lion Heart King who treated all races other than himself as inferior races said such things.\nBefore someone whispered What are you talking about? the black dragon continued.\nwhat is politics He continued his principled and standard remarks about what his own policy was for.\nThere were no accusations against other candidates no empty promises.\nHe just speaks honestly revealing the effectiveness of the policy and his sincerity.\nI don't know how many people it might have convinced.\nAmong those who were self-deprecating saying “Politics makes people like this” in the blatant political offensive among the Holy Grail knights there were also those who looked at the Black Dragon’s speech with a twisted gaze.\nbut.\nAt least one person felt a fresh jolt from it.\n·······.\nHoly Grail Knight Koo Dae-sung.\nHe is the man who watched this election withholding his position despite the continuous love calls of Vulcanus and Yapi.\nTo him Vulcan and Yapi's actions were not very nice to see.\nBoth of them had a worldly side compared to other Lionheart knights but they didn't expect it to be to this extent.\nThat's why the appearance of the Black Dragon which only spoke of policies without negatives or bribes brought great freshness.\nThe long-awaited voting day.\nMansudae Shrine where the Supreme People's Assembly was held before North Korea collapsed.\nIn this place where everyone with the right to vote participated Daesung Koo's turn came.\nI'm number 3. I'll vote for Black Dragon.\nAt those words the hall of the Capitol was buzzing.\nGrail Knights Vulcan and Yapi voted for themselves followed by Karina who abstained. It was because he who was the last of the Holy Grail Knights took pictures of the black dragon under everyone's attention.\nthis···!\n-Kick!?\nThe two are perplexed. Goo Dae-sung's vote was at first glance a 100-vote vote but if you look closely it's definitely not the case.\n“Oh Daesung Koo voted for Black Dragon.”\nHmm... Gudaeseongyeong is a benefactor who greatly helped our species' resurrection. He is next to Her Majesty Goddess Irmin and Goddess Demera.\nthen······.\nIn this Pyongyang mayoral election the number of free people's votes is significantly smaller than that of the knights.\n500 votes with just 50 Knights of the Burning Sword. 3 Naju Knights 750 votes.\nThe votes of the free people are only 637 votes even if they scrape together.\nHowever Goo Dae-sung's vote and the airflow that followed brought about a great change.\nWell... I'll vote for the black dragon too.\n-Kick!?\nStarting with Cheon So-yeon the commander of the Naju 1st Knights several knights voted for Black Dragon along with Goo Dae-seong.\nThere were no traitors among Vulcan's strong supporters the Knights of the Burning Sword but there were also those who voted for the Black Dragon from the side of the Knights whom Vulcanus had worked hard to persuade.\nThere were also those who did not like the scandalous election campaign between the two candidates.\nBy doing so.\nI declare this in the name of Lion Heart Leon Dragonia the Lion Heart King. The first mayor of Pyongyang Special Self-Governing Province is the first descendant of Dragonia the god of gold and contracts!\nAs the honorable first mayor of Pyongyang a black dragon was elected which no one expected.\n* * * *\n[·······.]\nThe black dragon looked at the newly established office for the large dragons and was deeply moved.\nCongratulations Mr. Black Dragon. No Mr. Mayor.\nBlack Dragon looked at Goo Dae-seong who supported him and turned the tide of the battle.\n[Why did you support me?]\nExcluding the same Holy Grail Knights Vulcanus and Yaphi it was the Black Dragon that was unexpected to support Goo Dae-seong even of a different race.\nAt his question Goo Dae-seong scratched his head and opened his mouth shyly.\n“I felt the sincerity.”\n[Honest?]\nYes. Unlike other candidates... I felt the sincerity of the mayor's speech. Ghmm... Is it a bit strange that I voted just for this reason?\nBlack Dragon just honestly revealed his aspirations. I didn't think it would bring such a big twist.\n[is it······.]\nAnd it didn't feel too bad.\nBy the way Mayor. What are you going to do first during your term of office?\nKoo Dae-seong was curious about the future policy of Black Dragon. He said he would do politics for the common people but he didn't know the details.\n[Right. First of all the cabinet should be formed.]\nDragonia unfolded the prepared cabinet composition plan. A cabinet member who will determine the future fate of Pyongyang Special Self-Governing City.\nAs it is a place where all kinds of races live in harmony it is difficult to adjust the balance——\nEh?\ndragon.\ndragon.\nYong Yong.\nfor use.\nOnly dragons from start to finish. It makes me wonder if there is such an outright racial favoritism in the world.\n[Good good. The Cabinet will do just that! Then as the mayor of Pyongyang I have to revise the Special Law No. 1!]\nMe Mayor? Black Dragon?\n[First first! Mayorship in Pyongyang is a permanent position! I don't need the next election until I die!]\nAs soon as he took office he declared a permanent dictatorship.\nThe expression of Goo Dae-sung a democratic citizen was worth seeing.\n[That's la la la la la la la...! Glory to Dragonia and Dragons God of Gold and Contracts!]\nA pantheon full of scheming and trickery.\nThe clumsy cannot survive!\n* * * *\nWhen China was divided into more than 50 countries it was the warlords in each region who took over the local government and started to play the king discussing what to do with the king.\nThey had an army and in times of turmoil that's power.\nIn the midst of each other claiming to be the President President and President for life of the Republic there was a being who called himself the ‘Heavenly Horse'.\nI am the Master of Ten thousand eons. The one who has reached the stage of success is the best person in all ages and modern times.\nsurvivor.\nThe man who came through the gate from the ruined world called himself the ‘Heavenly Demon'.\nThis Murim man who came from the world of the Middle Plain Murim appeared during the turbulent period when China was splitting up.\nHe wiped out the monsters overflowing in China during the chaos with overwhelming force and the Chinese hunters fascinated by his strength volunteered to come under his command.\nIn this way the disciples gathered to form a church and the residents who wanted protection on behalf of the incompetent government gathered and paid taxes so they were called ‘Cheonma Shingo'.\nIn this way the Church of the Heavenly Demon became one of the fifty or so torn Chinas and by the nature of the Heavenly Demon which was not particularly interested in expanding its power it was feared by the surrounding republics and established itself as the strongest country in name and reality.\nEven the absolute ruler of such a continent heard the news of a small peninsula country in the far east because someone secretly compared him to the Heavenly Demon.\n- Who will win if the Heavenly Demon and the Lionheart fight?\nLionheart a Korean survivor and Cheonma a Chinese survivor. Discussions about who is stronger among those absolute powers were common everywhere but it did not lead to a confrontation between the two supremes.\nIt is because the Heavenly Demon who trained disciples who reached the extreme for 10 years entered closed training before Leon returned to Earth.\nIt's already been three years since he planned to practice face-to-face training for 10 years and closed the cave.\nAn unexpected incident occurred in the Cheonma Shinkyo which was continuing its training while waiting for the return of the first person in the world.\n-Gong Gong Goo Eo Eo Oo U...!\n- Quaang! Kwak!\nGun bombs pouring down and warriors rushing in without sparing their lives.\nRyu In-chin the religious guard who guarded the defense line by cutting them down with a single knife was kicked by the endlessly swarming troops of neighboring countries.\nThese worms! Those who couldn't even look up at our school dared!\nLiu Yinqin was furious when he saw the army invading from all sides.\nAfter China was torn in all directions this place where the Heavenly Demon Gods settled was the only fortress that was not afraid of gates and dungeon breaks.\nThe surrounding republics were also aware of the fighting power of the Heavenly Demonic Church so they avoided the body and rather dispatched warriors of the Christian religion.\nOn the continent already torn into dozens everyone claimed to be the successor but no one was prepared to endure the dreaded civil war so they were desperate to enjoy their own kingdom and establish a good relationship with the Heavenly Demons.\nthey knew too.\nThey knew that if the Heavenly Demon directly shouted “One thing under heaven” they would always be swept away.\nThe reason why the torn continent was not sealed again was pure.\nThe Heavenly Demon whose world was destroyed by the demons did not pay any attention to human power until she gained the power to annihilate the Demon by rising to the brink of life or death.\nIf you go beyond the realm of talma and become a master of the life and death world even the devil will not be your opponent.\nWith this goal the Heavenly Demon volunteered to practice closed doors and went into seclusion.\nThese bastards...! How dare you invade our school! I'll tear them limb from limb—\nAaaaaaaagh!\nAt that time the hunters rushing towards Ryu In-chin. He cut five at once but the remaining one barely cut off the hem of his clothes.\nThis guy?!\nRyu In-chin who was about to cut him off felt an unknown gaze from Hunter.\nAn extremely fearful terrified gaze. Like falling into madness to do something at the same time.\nNot normal.\nRyu Yin-chin realized that not only the hunter in front of him but all the living things that had invaded the new church had similar eyes.\nNot only did they absorb the position of the powerful military forces among the Chinese warlords but the hunters who were fascinated by the strength of the Heavenly Demon received various martial arts and possessed overwhelming military power compared to neighboring countries.\nEven if the three neighboring countries are united they are not even opponents but the reason they are pushed this far is because they are conducting a mad charge to the point of even risking their own lives.\n‘What kind of magic did he use!'\nLiu Yinqin sensed that there was someone behind him and blocked their attack.\n‘If the Heavenly Demon returns! If the Heavenly Demon exists these bastards!'\nHowever the Heavenly Demon does not exist here. Shingo which grew up based on the absolute majesty of the Heavenly Demon can never be said to be weak but their momentum is surprisingly strong.\n- Kwaaaaang!!\nhuge roar. The roar from the mountain caught everyone's attention.\nAhhh······.\nAll members of the Protestant religion including Ryu In-chin looked up to him.\nA presence that makes even the air tingle. Even though it is in a faraway place its presence oppresses the space.\nHe has come.\nEven in the midst of an urgent battle each kneel and offer reverence. Even in the face of a defenseless enemy the allied forces were terrified.\nWow here you come.\nHe's here...\nA time of chaos when the continent was torn apart. A nogoe that tore apart a thousand Taegong warriors and 100000 soldiers alone.\nThe Second Coming of the Heavenly Demon! Manma and Bokbok!\nThe Second Coming of the Heavenly Demon! Manma Angbok!!”\nHeavenly Demon Lee Hwi-jin.\nAt some point he was in the middle of the battlefield.\nIt's busy.\nsmall talk. It was just an old man's petty complaint but the anger it contained made everyone tremble.\nThree years since the principal is closed and training. There are still seven years left but the worms of the Sabah world are even interfering with the principal's training.\nIt was anger towards everyone.\nAnger at the allied forces for interfering with the closing ceremony.\nA rebuke to the incompetent believers who finally pulled themselves out of their face.\nHe was the one who could make his wrath pay the price and he took up the sword as punishment.\nThat that!\nI am astonished at the unusual sword's anticipation. at the same time\nBreaking Heaven Sword (破天劍).\nOne of the world's strongest item Epic class.\nIt's already been three years since that sword cut something.\n3 years is enough time to be forgotten in people's memories. But no one has lost that memory.\nBlood damage...\nThe allied hunter who said that knew how stupid he said.\nNo one can escape from the heavens opened by the Heavenly Demon.\nThe next moment the sky broke and the sky was cut.\nA terrible cut passed through the earth splitting heaven and earth in two.\n·······.\n······\nEven after suffering right in front of his eyes even though hundreds of his comrades died in one blow no one was angry or despaired.\nI just couldn't believe what happened in front of my eyes and was stunned.\nThat is the Heavenly Demon Lee Hwi-jin.\nThe author is the only child of heaven and earth.\nA monster of Talma who has reached the pinnacle of a world.\nCome out. You're going against the heart of the main seat because your life is complicated.\nThere were unknown thorns in the Heavenly Demon's voice. The place where his gaze is directed is the center where he just cut the sky and the earth.\nSomething crawling out of the center of the wave that nothing else would have survived.\nIt's creepy.\nIt was a white silver-haired man.\nAt first glance his face was neat enough to be regarded as a nobleman. However Lee Hwi-jin thought that he could not be a descendant of a proper family.\nTattoos all over the body. The wildness overflowing from the man. It never matches the dignity of the famous family.\nThat is a savage who grew up in the wild and conquered with wildness. An existence that is like an ‘incarnation of a beast'.\nThe man's savage voice overflowed with deafness.\nIt'll be enough to have a good match with Vulcanus. I'm glad I came.\nWho are you?\nComparing himself to Saekmokin Lee Hwi-jin's eyes glistened fiercely.\nHowever even when facing the Heavenly Demon's gaze the man does not show fear but a sincere fighting spirit.\nIf asked for a name the answer would be the same for any warrior in any world.\nDevil's fangs Baekrang's semi-tribe Cheolwoong's fur and Black Eagle's claws.\nHe was given the utmost respect as a warrior towards the Heavenly Demon who was the ‘top of the world'.\nRigardo the great warrior of the beast gods.\nThe body of the warrior who identified himself as Rigardo gradually changes. His body which belonged to a human being suddenly turned into a pure white and strong beast.\nYou bastard... you're not human!\nIt was a beastization that would turn away even the top of Protestantism which was revered in the world as the Demonic Cult. The pure white wolf looked down at the Heavenly Demon with a sullen gaze.\nInstead of the weak demons I'll destroy this planet. That was the deal.\nA short time when satellites crashed and there was a delay in communication between countries. The demise of the Heavenly Demon Goddess happened quietly and quickly.",

      "content": "Frost Queen (1)\nThe worst gate incident that hit mankind originated from the three black gates.\nThe first is the Shanghai Incident.\nThe appearance of the great evil Scaja Carrier. And by the ever-resurrecting devil China lost its largest economic city and was torn to shreds into 53 countries as the influence of the central government disappeared.\nThe second is the London disaster.\nThe Epic-class item ‘Wandering Magic Sword' which was dropped after the Black Gate attack of the European Union Attack Corps dominated the host and caused casualties not only in London but also in the whole world.\nFinally the Siberian Snowfield Frost Queen dungeon break.\nLike the previous two black gates the Russian government mobilized all its strength to deal with the black gate that appeared in the middle of its country.\nHowever the gate attack failed and as a result a black grade dungeon break occurred in the middle of Siberia.\nThis monster boss called the Frost Queen took over the snow fields at once. He created a huge ice castle and at the same time the snow field gradually expanded.\nCompared to before and after 2016 the snowfield expanded by more than 20% and Russia risked national luck and mobilized all hunters and troops to defeat Frost Queen.\nDamn I should have handled it perfectly then.\nA soldier from the Siberian Snowfield Observation Corps gritted his teeth against the severe cold of the snowy field despite the fact that it was midsummer.\n2017. It was a Russian raid that succeeded in attacking Frost Queen but it was only a half-success.\nUh what should I do? Even the Yeti came out already!\nThe indestructible objects Frost Queen's heart and ice castle still remain in Siberia harassing Russia.\nThis phenomenon which caused an anomaly to the extent that a fair number of hunters would freeze to death just by approaching it gradually expanded Siberia every year and endless monsters were born in the ice castle.\nAmong them Yeti is an S-class field boss who is said to be the highest ranking member of the Queen. The fact that even this one was born meant that the queen's resurrection had actually been accomplished.\nReport to the superiors...!?\nThe soldier nodded as his superior's complexion turned to earthy color. However a cold sweat broke out on the nape of his neck at the huge shadow that soon fell.\nah······.\nLooking back he faced a huge giant. A monster of pure white fur and ferocious size.\n-Kreu...!\nYes Yeti...!\nThree Yeti the highest ranking member of Frost Queen are in front of them.\nGee support...\nThe subordinate soldier requested support from his superior. Even if he knew that it was an act meaningless to his life and death right away.\nSir?\nThe soldier searched for his superior one after another but there was no answer. The soldier had no choice but to find out why.\n‘Mo the body?!'\nAt some point the lower part of the body does not move. The soldier realized belatedly that the superior he had been talking to a moment ago had frozen.\nah······.\nThe boss has already frozen to death.\nThe culprits are strange beings like ice crystals surrounding them.\ngovernment ordinance······.\nDozens of ice spirits were staring at him. Likewise the Ice Spirits who are the descendants of the Frost Queen. The worst monster in this snowy field said to have more than A-rank potential.\n17 years ago hundreds of hunters were frozen to death by those spirits.\n- Kkeukreuk...!\nThe Yeti stretches out its hand as if mocking a soldier. The giant Yeti's arm snatched the soldier away.\nah······.\nLooking at his wide open mouth one thing came to mind of the soldier.\n‘The Pantheon. If they were here...'\nSiberian snowfields with fluttering snow. Russian soldiers monitoring the ice castle began to disappear one after another.\nand at the same time.\n[I am Skajacarrier! I am the embodiment of destruction!!]\nShanghai Gate. The great evil that destroyed China has risen again.\n* * * *\nThe resurrection of the Siberian Snow Queen Frost was immediately known to governments around the world.\nThe expansion of the snow fields due to Frost Queen was a serious issue that threatened the survival of neighboring countries and it was one of the greatest threats to mankind that was tracked and monitored 24 hours a day along with the Shanghai Gate and the wandering magic sword.\nKang-Hyeok Oh the head of the Korean Hunter Association reacted quickly to the crisis that broke out in neighboring countries and has already promised to collaborate with Chairman Takeda the head of the Japanese Hunter Association.\nIt would have been perfect to ask Leon for help now...\nSubdue the devil.\nLungs Your Majesty!\nLeon who flew straight to Seoul first mentioned that Oh Kang-hyeok was worried about how to be polite and ask.\nWhere have the others gone?\nWhen Leon mentioned the empty seat at the round table Kanghyuk Oh hurriedly replied.\nAh yes! The other 10 guilds are all stationed in various parts of the Korean peninsula. Since the 24-hour gate surveillance system has not yet been restored it is to respond immediately...\nTsk I didn't say anything about my President of the United States of America but it's so late.\nI will send an official letter through the government.\nLeon nodded and naturally sat down at the top seat at the round table.\n“Jim came because he finally heard that the damned Great Devil of Shanghai has been resurrected.”\nAs expected His Majesty this is unbearable news.\nDemon Gate in Shanghai. It was something Leon had heard of since he had just returned to Earth.\nWandering Demon Sword.\nfrost queen.\nScajacarrier.\nOf these three catastrophes that came out of the black gate wasn't it the one who split the continent?\nThe reason why Scajacarrier was able to ravage China so brutally is that he is an immortal being who does not die even if he dies.\nEven if numerous S-class raiding parties are mobilized and managed to defeat it it will be revived and returned in a few years so the damage will accumulate and eventually important human resources will inevitably collapse.\nIt is the great evil that has plagued the continent so persistently but it is no longer something to be feared.\nJim and the knights will take care of it. The devil will annihilate it without leaving a single piece of its body or a piece of its soul.\nFor the Knights of Lionheart who deal with the Holy Law the devil is truly their natural enemy. Their pride of immortality was meaningless in front of the power of the concept.\nI'm just going to give you the courage to shut it up!\nI heard that troublesome things happened in Siberia too?\nActually... there was a request from the Russian government to get help from the pantheon. It seems that hundreds of hunters were killed and injured while trying to capture the outer perimeter.\nRussia had already attacked Frost Queen once but this disaster seemed to be a more overwhelming crisis than before.\nThe Russian government bowed its pride and requested assistance from countries around the world and in particular earnestly asked for the Korean pantheon to participate in the war.\nRight.\nLeon thought that it was reasonable to send at least a Holy Grail Knight level force at the word black gate.\nI will send my knights to see President Ahn's face. The president owes a debt to Nampo as well as Pyongyang.\nYour Excellency the President will be pleased too. But... Your Majesty owes nothing to our government. Rather our country owes you a great debt.\nThe 2nd Korean War would not have been won without Leon.\nAbsorbing North Korea the poorest country in the world in a pile of huge debt there were many things that would have been difficult without the help of the pantheon.\nAlthough Pyongyang the largest city in North Korea was virtually independent and overlooked the occupation of Nampo by the Kikkiruk tribe how can we ask for the calculation since more benefits have come to South Korea.\nWhat. Isn't Korea a friend of Lionheart?\nyour majesty···!\nOh Kang-hyeok gave Leon a thrilling look.\nJim and Lord Vulcanus will go to Shanghai together. For those of us from Lionheart the devil is bound to be more important.\n“If so who are you planning to send to Siberia?”\nOkay if you're going to send it...\nLeon easily selected the knights to dispatch to Siberia.\n* * * *\nThe advent of Frost Queen in 2016 was a cataclysm that threatened the very existence of Russia.\nFrost Queen's heart and ice castle which could not be destroyed were recreating Russia's nightmare with the queen's resurrection.\nSupport! We need more support!\nThe monsters are endless! Send more hunters!\nRussia declared martial law at the same time as Frost Queen's resurrection but it was not enough to stop their expansion.\nMonsters are constantly being born. Unlike demons who do not die and resurrect even after dying this one has no end even after killing.\n‘It's too big that the gate was created in Siberia!'\nAs the name suggests Frost Queen is the holder of the power to control ice.\nThe lower the temperature the stronger the power of the Frost Queen and the place where the Frost Queen's gate appeared was the Siberian snowfield.\nThe power of the Frost Queen here is truly limitless.\nWith just a gesture monsters are born in a shower and among them there are a lot of ice spirits and yeti a decent red gate boss monster.\nThe battlefield is a truly devastating situation. Hunter and his army mobilized by Russia were facing a hopeless battle against Frost Queen's army.\niced coffee······.\nWaves of monsters rush in. More monsters than the monsters you defeated step on the snow field and rush at them.\nThat's it.\nEven if all of their country's S-class hunters were mobilized they couldn't survive for just a few days.\nFrost Queen who had been accumulating power in Siberia for nearly 20 years became stronger than before and the cold was not something that even a single country could block.\n“The end——”\nDaeseongbeop < Spear of the Earth >\nThe moment he intuited the end a huge ‘land' penetrated the Russian Hunter's eyes.\nTurning the battlefield upside down it literally shattered the Frost Queen's minions.\nMuh what happened...!\n──────!!\nHuge machines suddenly fell from the sky. Before they hit the ground they stick to each other and suddenly transform into alien robots that can only come out of a space war.\n- Marquis-class decisive battle weapon combination completed. commencement of battle.\nThe iron robot pours out a roar. The weapon of destruction pouring down from the whole body of that decisive battle weapon was a tsunami that swept the beasts of the snowfield.\n- Goaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nA huge beast roars. As if its appearance like an alien robot is the appearance of an enemy that is perfect for beasts.\nYes it's a Yeti!\nThe Yeti is coming!\nThe monster that killed several S-class hunters in Russia rushed towards the marquis class. However the gigantic decisive battle weapon doesn't even care about the Yeti.\n‘Boo collide!'\nIf the giant robot that swept the overwhelming queen's quantity was defeated the atmosphere of this battlefield would change again.\nThe Russian Hunters tried to block the Yeti's charge alone to keep the atmosphere about to be reversed.\nIt is instinctively realized. That robot is a decisive move to change this situation.\nUgh...!\nHowever his determined courage collapses under the yeti's growing shadow. He realized how pointless his own air was.\nThe moment he was about to drop his weapon at the monster in front of him——\nIt's great courage. I'll praise you.\nAlong with the cool voice of a woman something runs across the snowy field.\nblack bullet. Running on a pure white snowy field\n-·······?!\nBefore the white giant notices its identity the magic sword shines brightly.\n- Kwaaaak!\nAn eerie sound of flesh being cut. The huge beast collapsed with the sound of the swinging magic sword cutting the Yeti's neck with precision.\n‘The S-class field boss Yeti in one blow?!'\nQueen's Commander-in-Chief. The white beast said to be next to the frost giant died in one stroke. As if it was shocking to the hunters and even the queen's soldiers all eyes turned to the dark-haired woman.\nThere's still a lot. Sir Spinner and Sir Koo Dae-seong use your strength.\nAt the black-haired woman's words the voice of a knight in green armor came from the helmet.\nWhat about His Excellency the Grand Duke?\nBecause this work is from the royal family. The honor of being at the forefront tends to yield to the knights.\n-Kick!\nEven so the black-haired woman lightly swung her sword at the monsters approaching me. With just that the hard bodies of the monsters were cut like pudding.\nonly three people.\nThe appearance of only three people changes the face of the battlefield.\nThere is only one being on this planet who can exert such superpowers.\nThe Holy Grail Knight...\nThey arrived in Siberia.",

      "content": "Frost Queen (2) with artwork\ncharge.\nAlong with the voice of a cynical girl the sound of stepping on the ground resounds which is not suitable for the snowy field.\nThe sight of hundreds of armored knights rushing at once reminded me of medieval European knights.\n-Quaaaaaang!\nA wedge-shaped cavalry charge swept away the ice followers. Several giants tried to block their charge but a parabolic barrage hit them.\n-Kick! Giggles!\nPinpoint bombardment by the bombardment gloves of the Kikkiruk warriors.\nThe concentrated firepower as directed by Yaffe on board the Marquis-class decisive battle weapon was the alien corps itself that swept away the barbarians with stone axes.\n-Captured many ice spirits. Initiation of high-intensity fire support.\n[I already know!]\nYapi's integrated command communication responded to the five dragons deployed in the Siberian snowfield.\nTheir jaws open and a huge energy is focused. Shortly thereafter the breath that cut through the snowfields poured in and the additional corps that had been recruited to support them melted like ice cream in midsummer.\nHuh~ We are us too but aren't dragons' firepower really a joke?\nKim Jae-hyeok who was sweeping an axis by pouring thunder and lightning on the battlefield also poured out admiration for the dragon's breath.\nIf you have time to admire drop even one more bolt of lightning. If you drop lightning on molten ground it's a direct hit.\nWhile preparing for the knights' re-attack So-yeon observed the situation.\nSo Yeon-ah what's wrong?\n“The speed of replenishment is slow.”\nthis?\nFrost Queen's retinue pouring into Siberia is truly inexhaustible.\nWhen the snow piles up the magical energy injected into it gives birth to ice spirits yeti soar and frozen ice soldiers pour down as if the snowy fields are spitting them out.\n“Compared to the battle footage from 17 years ago this Jeong-don is still weak. The quality of troops has improved but above all the ‘frost giants’ are not showing up.”\nWhat is a frost giant?\nSo-yeon looks at Jae-hyeok who calmly asks questions saying that he is pathetic. Didn't the guy whose name was the head knight of the pantheon didn't even investigate the past data?\nQueen's corps commanders. Guard knights. They are monsters whose fighting power is said to be greater than that of a queen.\nIs there a follower stronger than Yeti?\nEven the Yeti is not a monster that can tear apart S-class hunters. However Jaehyuk was surprised that there was a monster stronger than him.\nBecause it's one of the worst black grades.\nSaying that it is not one of the three major disasters for nothing Soyeon recalled the wandering magic sword.\nThe Demonic Sword of Wandering possessed by Akasha the Grand Duke of Slaughter was evaluated as the strongest single entity but Frost Queen was called the strongest in a different sense.\nAs long as the Holy Grail Knights are here I don't have much to worry about...\nStill it was strange that a frost giant did not appear when the battlefield was pushed this far. Hasn't the Frost Queen fully resurrected yet?\nWell when you enter the ice castle you'll know what happened.\nThe tip of Jae-Hyeok's spear is taken away as he tries to point it at the monsters in the snowy field.\nA pillar of fire that burns the snowfield and melted ice water pours down as waves.\nIt would have been a waste to spend more firepower here.\n* * * *\nThe Siberian battlefield which Russia had blocked with all its might was broken through with the introduction of the Holy Grail Knights and Knights.\nThere were still many monsters in the snowy field but the dragon and the warriors who occupied the ice castle prevented it by conducting a defensive battle in reverse and the Holy Grail Knights and a small number of knights but Russian hunters entered the ice castle.\n-Start base defense mode. This machine moved the cockpit to the Count-class aircraft.\nAfter giving an automatic battle order to the Marquis-class decisive battle weapon Yapi took the lead with Koo Dae-seong.\nMany enemy troops inside!\nAs the 1st Naju Knights led by Yapi Goo Dae-seong and Karina quickly enter the ice castle the ice soldiers rush to stop the intruders.\n-Kick! Initiate fire suppression.\nThe Queen's soldiers were swept away in an instant with only Goo Dae-seong's defense maintenance and Yaffe's firepower support aboard the Count-class aircraft.\nIt's an ice castle. It's tasteful.\nOn top of that he even assisted veteran Holy Grail Knight Karina.\nQuite threatening monsters popped out in the middle but they couldn't withstand Karina's blow.\nIt was an ice spirit just now! It's quite powerful too!\nI don't think you'll feel much difference from a normal soldier in this work.\nIndeed the Holy Grail Knight. To them it was meaningless to measure the unit of strength between normal monsters and A-class monsters.\nThere are three holy grail knights with super power. The following Naju Knights were confident that this attack would end easily.\nIt's also strange.\nHuh? Junior Soyeon what's wrong?\nAt Ha-ri's question Cheon So-yeon frowned as if feeling a sense of déjà vu.\nThe frost giant is still nowhere to be seen. In fact it should be the queen's last line of defense...\nIsn't it just that it couldn't be created? You've come this far and you can't see it.\nJaehyuk said it as if it was not a big deal but Cheon Soyeon shook her head.\nNo matter how hard it is there must be at least one. The frost giant is the first member of the queen's family to be born. It is also the commanding entity that leads the family in the first place.\nThat means that there are frost giants in this ice castle.\nAnd the fact that it didn't show up even though I've been bothered until now...\nYou mean you're guarding by the Queen's side.\nA number of top level monsters that have not been discovered are next to the black rank boss Frost Queen.\n“This is the Hall of the Queen. Be vigilant and watch your surroundings.”\nWith Karina's advice they were able to reach the Queen's Hall in no time.\nUnlike the ice castle stage the inside gets darker as you go.\nThe ‘indestructible object' ice castle blocks even external light as if it is not of this world.\nThe black darkness reminds me of a maji cave-type dungeon. Yapi's infrared and thermal cameras advance through the darkness. Reach the huge door in front of the Queen's Hall.\nI'll open it.\nGoo Dae-sung who is the hardest and has the best regenerative power opened the door himself and Yapi threw something into it.\n-Wheeying! phut!\nIt was a device that identified the structure by shooting infrared radar in all directions.\nYaffy explored the dark inside of the queen's hall and made a conclusion.\n-Check the life reaction inside. two objects.\nAre you the queen?\n-Kick?\nIt was at that moment that Yaffe was trying to observe more detailed information.\n-Quaaaaaaagh! puck!\nSomething is thrown inside. It was a fleeting moment but Koo Dae-sung and Karina confirmed it.\n“neck?”\nThe frozen giant's thick neck was tossed like a baseball and met with a count-level war armament.\n-bang!\nThe count who was hit by it staggered. The war armament made of special iron lost its balance and collapsed.\nSir Yapi!\nThe assailant immediately swung his mace at Goo Dae-seong and Goo Dae-seong blocked it with the earth shield.\n- Goong!\nuh?!\nGoo Dae-seong who blocked it with the Earth Shield felt something strange.\nThe shock felt through the shield. The total amount of power transmitted to the arm is something bizarre.\nJust like when he blocked Leon's mounted charge for the first time during his Man-at-Arms days.\nSir Koo Dae-seong!\nDespite blocking that mighty blow with his shield Goo Dae-seong bounced back in the same direction the mace was swung. The astonishing power that the Holy Grail Knight could not withstand.\nthis guy···!\nKarina's magic sword was dyed black and swung towards the enemy. Even with that absolutely cutting demonic sword in front of her her opponent rather advances distorting the timing of Karina's attack with her shoulder and then stabs him as it is.\nKuh...!\nKarina who fell in shock threw herself to the side to avoid the Mace. She sees Yaffe aiming her machine gun at the end of her gaze.\n-Doo-doo-doo-doo...!\nYapi's gunfire which fired thousands of machine shells per minute hit his back.\n-Kreu...!\nEven after being hit by dozens of shells the reaction he showed was to approach with a howl like a beast.\n-·······!?\nAn attacker who silently endured even the most expensive star iron bullets and approached. Yaffi immediately engaged in close combat spreading dozens of wires.\nTactics < Cheonrajimang >\nAfter careful calculation the sharp wires that can cut anything fall into a trajectory that makes it impossible to evade.\nLiterally I wish for heaven. The assailant laughed at the wires that wrapped around the assailant like a spider's web.\n< Skuniq's Substance >\nThe moment his feet step on the floor the whole body is enveloped in darkness and disappears like fog. He did not witness the moment that even Yafi who was watching with a high-performance infrared camera disappeared.\n-·······?!\nIn the next moment the net of the wire is swept away and the assailant appears in the place where the destructive castle has swept.\nHis outrageous arms stretched out with red aura and Yaffi deployed the greatest defensive technique in an instant.\nTactics < Iron Blessing >\nInstant defense increase. This extreme defense boasts invincibility in a short time. But-\n-Kwajik\nA red hand violently grips the glove of the Count-class aircraft. The glove that was caught in the grip was ripped off as it was.\nNonsense...!?\nIn an unbelievable moment the glove is ripped off in the shape of the hand revealing Yapi's body in the exposed cockpit.\n< Gokrok's Gaze >\nSoon in the darkness a warm energy flowed from his eyes——\n-Kwaaa!\nGreen flashes rain down on Yaffi.\n-Emergency ejection!\nYappy avoiding the green flash that poured toward the cockpit activated the emergency ejection system with his gloves. However the assailant's arm grabbed Yaffe who had escaped the cockpit.\nFlies.\nThe corner of the assailant's mouth twisted along with such an evaluation. At the moment of desperation Karina appeared from behind.\nLet go of that lowly hand!\nperfect surprise. The absolute cutting demon sword cut his back but that was all. The armor with unimaginable defensive power resisted the demonic sword's cutting power and the additional attack was blocked by Yaffe who was thrown at Karina.\nKuh...!\nWhile Karina who received Yaffe was pushed back the attacker's mace tried to strike her.\nTake one shot.\n·······?!\nThe end of Karina's gaze. Huge power is focused on the ‘hammer'.\nHuh...!\nGoo Dae-seong who had focused his mad power on Geobrick's hammer struck it down. Boom! With a dizzying sound the power of the ice castle shakes. None of those who took this direct hit survived!\nWhoa...\nThe moment Koo Dae-sung sighed in relief convinced of victory the hammer hit his shoulder and was grabbed.\nRealizing that it was the assailant he had just hit Goo Dae-seong twisted in shock.\n‘You're still fine after being hit by this?!'\nIf it had hit the ground it would have been a blow that would change the terrain. But not only did he calmly endure it——\n-Quaaaaa!!\nMace slowly rising. Goo Dae-sung's face grew darker as eerie red waves poured from the mace.\nWhat what power...!\nI felt a crisis and tried to escape from his grasp but he blocked Goo Dae-seong with one arm and immediately hit the mace.\n- Goong!\nInstinctively what was blocked with the earth shield bounced off with the shield meaninglessly. The dented star-iron helmet rolls around aimlessly.\nForm up!\nGoo Dae-seong who was hit and bounced off by the mace was formed as if the knights were protecting him.\nThey form an almost instinctive formation as they have been trained but each has a pallor of disbelief.\n‘Stop Holy Grail Knights...'\n‘Have you been attacked by only one person?'\nBut there was no time to be embarrassed by them. The mace which lightly struck Goo Dae-seong was lifted this time concentrating destructive power.\nUp danger?!\nSuho almost instinctively deployed his shield. Holy Grail Knight Amalek's Light Hallows. At the same time as deploying that absolute defense-\n< Helcan's Grandson >\nA red wave so ferocious that even breathing stops. The red meteor makes everyone numb.\nThe overbearing charisma and despairing energy of the mace overwhelmed the knights and hunters and engulfed them with fear.\nThat monster had power that exceeded even the protection of the Holy Grail Knights.\n-Quaaaaaaang!\nWaves emitted from the mace slammed the floor collapsing the ice castle and crushing all directions.\n──────!!!!!\nThe place where the sound has disappeared.\nEveryone is stunned in front of the terrible destruction that took place in a single blow.\nEven this kind of power was just a light ‘demonstration' to that assailant.\nHoly Grail Knight. I expected a little... but it's utterly disappointing.\nIn the black darkness of the hall. The red energy from the mace reveals the assailant's face.\nRun away tin cans. Tell your king.\nthat your hometown has come\nOak.\nIt had the face of a ferocious beast.\noak rough\nWarpainting X",

A meteor of ‘flame' falls with a terrifyingly gigantic scream. at the same time-\n-Quaaaaaaa!\n-Quaaaaaaa!\nMissiles raining down. Anti-ship missiles... No it's round and thick as if several people were on board for an attack missile.\n[······What is that is that?]\nThe devil who lacks vigilance dies first.\n* * * *\nGu Kuwe E.\nThe demons were just trying to get out of this place.\nHowever the disasters that fell from the sky and the Holy Grail Knights from the ‘transportation' missiles that were launched across the sea unilaterally slaughtered the demons.\nHoly Grail Knight Vulcanus and Baltan Flaming Sword Knights.\nOne of the strongest knights in Lionheart they are notorious even among demons.\nIf it were only them the Skajakari and the demons of slaughter would have thought of fighting against each other.\nHowever there was another existence that fired missiles at them.\n-La Lionheart!\nLeon Dragonia Lionheart.\nThis man is truly the nemesis of evil. A demon slayer who is the fear of countless demons and has killed demon lords.\nWhen a fearsome entity appeared even the lower level demons collapsed.\n[Hey these guys! fight! I mean fight!]\nSkajacarrier waved a flaming whip to encourage him but he was more afraid of the demon slayer's sad gaze than the Prime Devil's whip.\nshelf collapse. Archdemon beheading. one-sided slaughter.\nWith the corpses of demons strewn all over the city the Knights of the Burning Sword did something they weren't used to.\nStop it you bastards!\nIf you stop now I'll annihilate you with a single sword!\nThe Knights of the Flaming Sword who ride horses and hunt demons.\nThey showed off their blood-soaked armor and began taking some demons prisoner.\nThis guy! How dare you touch my armor? Die you devil!\nQuaaaagh! I can't stand watching this repulsive appearance! Die you demon!\nOf course the acquisition of prisoners by the Burning Sword Knights a demon-limited anger control disorder was extremely inefficient.\nHaa~ Sirs are also really...\nBeatrice sighed lightly as she looked at the dying demons captured by the Knights of the Burning Sword.\nRecently I needed information about the Pandemonium so I asked for as many prisoners as possible...\nI'm sorry Her Highness the Queen...\nI can't bear to see their evil faces...!\nThe reason Beatrice asked to secure the demons was to interrogate them and obtain the latest information about the demon realm.\nAfter the defeat of Rakshaar the lord of chaos the demonic invasion of Earth has diminished.\nThe gate itself continued to appear but the Demon Gate or the tricks of the demons which appeared occasionally were nowhere to be seen.\nWith even the monarch defeated the next thing the demons can prepare for is an all-out war.\nSo it was a good opportunity for demons to haunt Shanghai like this.\na few days like that\nIn the process of thoroughly annihilating the demons in Shanghai Beatrice succumbed to the fact that the information she obtained from the demon captives was not as satisfying as she thought.\nAre you not well?\nYes... these demons have older information than I thought.\nBeatrice didn't get any more up-to-date information from the demons haunting Shanghai than she thought.\nThese guys... seem to have been running to Earth since the Demon Gate appeared in Shanghai. The demons also have separate territories so it seems that they haven't communicated as much as I thought.\n“What is the probability that they lied?”\nIn my experience demons who tell lies are surprisingly distinguishable. Maybe it's a woman's intuition?\nLeon understood after glancing at the corpses of the demons who died miserably. Those who have eaten meat are said to eat it well and when it comes to Beatrice it can be said that she is a devil torturer... no she is a master of interrogation.\nBut out of some pretty old information comes familiar information.\nFamiliar information?\n‘Dark-skinned Orcs'. These are called Black Orcs.\n·······.\nWhen Leon heard the information he frowned.\nWhile Leon and Vulcanus were clearing Shanghai they heard what had happened in Siberia.\nThe Grail Knights were injured by the dark-skinned orcs and retreated.\nWhen I surrounded the ice castle again and entered it I heard that it disappeared without a trace.\nBeatrice also picked up that information and confirmed the dark skinned orcs from the demons and quite a few demons were known by the orcs.\nIt's worth a thousand words it's a sight. Hear it for yourself.\nBeatrice summoned a demon prisoner. The demon prisoner who managed to not die yet started talking about the Black Orcs in a fearful voice in front of Leon and Beatrice.\n“This two hundred years ago we started a two-sided war on Your Majesty’s planet.”\nThe first target of destruction is of course the Lionheart Kingdom.\nAlthough Malus the lord of chaos was defeated the Lionheart Kingdom lost many Holy Grail Knights and Knights in the process.\nThe demons intuited that Caracael the lord of wisdom would be able to sufficiently destroy Lionheart and the most powerful demon legion the lord of slaughter and destruction invaded the eastern kingdom of heaven.\nThat's where we met. With them...\nThey were running west and west laying waste to the great eastern kingdom. As if trying to reach the end of the world.\nLaughing at them the lord of slaughter and destruction collided head-on with the orc hordes——\nDo passed away. No he was annihilated... his soul was absorbed by the Orc Gods.\nIn the process Akasha the Grand Duke of Slaughter also lost her body to the monster's clubbing.\nHowever Akasha managed to open the gate and escape with her sword but they even invaded the demon realm.\nThey even appeared in the demon realm. They killed demons randomly and especially that guy...\nHe?\nThe leader of the Orcs I mean. His name is...\nThe demon trembled and seemed afraid to even mention its name. However it is true that Nuna's violence is also fearful.\nThe devil said his name with difficulty.\nMurka. Orc Grand Khan Murka Balak.\nA great war in Leon's world. In the fierce struggle the demons had to fight a war in the demon realm as well.\nThey struck the sloth lord first.\nThe demon lord of sloth and stupidity. He was the master of the Devil Archduke who froze Vulcanus and the Knights of the Burning Sword in the cold continent for two hundred years.\nBattle ensued war after war...\nThey were beasts that embodied war itself.\nFor the first time in Pandemonium history... we were invaded for the first time. We... were helplessly attacked by them.\nSince then Murka has traveled all over the realm of demons stealing their resources and sometimes subduing demon followers demonized alien races and demons to unite and expand their power.\nWell we... had to deal with two great enemies: Lionhearts and Orcs.\nAmong them Lionheart was on the brink of destruction... No it drove it to the point of actual destruction. Only one person Leon could not be defeated.\nHowever Murka's side repeated defeat unilaterally.\nDespite the union of the demonic headquarters the lord of indolence and the lord of lust the enormous power mighty great demons and demon lords could not defeat Murka.\nWhen exposed to the demon world for a long time and even its skin became black and was called ‘Black Oak' the lord of indolence and the lord of lust were smashed by Murka and the demons of the demon world had to take special measures.\nWhile the remnants of the two demon lords were slaughtered unilaterally the dimension of the Pandemonium where Murka and the Black Orcs exist was separated.\nAnd that's it.\nIt was the Orc Great Khan who came to this earth now and he was the Orc Great Khan Murka Balak.\nLeon recalled the gaze of the enemy he once felt.\nThe incident where Zereah the Holy Grail Knight of Dreams and Death ascended to heaven in the original history at the gate where Zereah's holy relic convoy was given as a quest.\nBehind them were the corrupt electors of the empire but it was the barbarians of the beast god and... the orcs who carried them out.\nIs that the guy who shot down the satellite that Lord Spinner warned about?\nAlso the ‘giant existence' that the goddess Meriel saw while predicting Leon's fate in the United States.\nA beast of mighty ego who chased the goddess out saying ‘Go away' while predicting the fate of others.\nPerhaps his true nemesis might not be a devil but a bastard thought Leon.",

      "content": "orc coup\nAfter the reunification of the two Koreas the administrative judicial and legislative branches of a unified Korea are literally having fierce days.\n“So! North Korea must be designated as a special agricultural zone to create jobs and increase the food self-sufficiency rate! Isn’t it a crop that is blessed to be hot these days! We need to expand this to North Korea’s specialties—”\nImproving North Korea's poor transportation environment is the priority! We must actively install hyperloops to secure transportation infrastructure—\nWhat should we do from the overheated speculation atmosphere in North Korea? The Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport immediately withdraw the government's policy encouraging speculation!\nI heard that the leader of the opposition party contacted the generals of the North Korean military who surrendered. Isn't this to prepare for the upcoming presidential election?\nDon't oppress the opposition with absurd conspiracy theories!\n‘I'm about to retire...'\nHe was President Andong-gil who had the honorable title of the first president of a unified Korea but he thought that even this was inappropriate in front of the ruling and opposition parties who fought every day.\nResolving the North Korean issue is already painful but with the upcoming presidential election ahead everyone is staring at their eyes.\n‘Dragon ate the market in Pyongyang.'\nThe Pyongyang mayoral election was a global issue.\nThe election process was far from a normal democracy but it was the first case in which different races were elected by voting while maintaining the form of democracy anyway.\nAfter the Mayor of Dragon was elected Dragon officials did a better job than expected in the agreement with the South Korean government.\nWhen Leon was the subject of negotiations things that could have been easily dismissed as good is good because the dragons dealt with them according to FM based on thorough gold and new contracts.\nIt is evaluated that the attitude of looking down from above which is unique to dragons is highly valued but it is evaluated that it showed amazing negotiating power in the details of the contract.\nThanks to this there are people who are looking forward to the advancement of the political world.\n‘Well it's good for races with exceptional appearances like elves to use their faces as proportional representatives.'\nPresident Ahn who had been imagining the entry of heterogeneous tribes into politics suddenly thought about the advancement of orcs into politics.\nPossessing sufficient ‘voting rights' which is the most important factor in democratic voting they are a race that can exert sufficient potential in the political world.\n‘Well it might be impossible.'\nBut orcs are not interested in politics. They are a natural warrior race. He is so busy with his fight that he doesn't even think about going into politics.\neach···!?\n‘Should I scout the elf in the pantheon during the next proportional representation?'\nIt was Andong-gil who couldn't bear to tell the knights from Lionheart to go into politics.\n“──Ha!!”\n‘I think the ripple effect will be too strong if that Leon comes out in the election. It seems like everyone can't even mention it. Then she's even Queen Beatrice-‘\nExcellent!!\nUh de I'm listening.\nPresident Ahn felt the eyes of cabinet members and lawmakers. That his eyes were not on him but on the big TV in the conference room.\nYour Excellency! I think you should check it out!\nThe chief of staff who had called President Ahn earlier pointed to the TV. there-\nWhat is that?\nWuhan... This is the official statement of the Republic of Wuhan! This is a real-time broadcast!\nRepublic of Wuhan. It is one of the 53 distinctly divided Chinese countries and one of the fairly large continental countries with a population of 5 million.\nIt is one of the common warlord dictatorships that do not have much exchange with Korea unlike Heilong People's Republic of Korea which is a granary but—\nHuh? Why General Orc and not the President's spokesman?\nFor some reason I couldn’t even translate but I could communicate well.\nWhen President Ahn was puzzled by the fluent Korean language with the language advantage a characteristic of survivors unbelievable words were spat out.\n[This coup was a decision to save the country to return democracy to the citizens!]\nwhat? democracy? an orc?\nAn Orc general who said that the Lionheart knight would have to declare no religious affiliation to be roughly balanced.\nThe Chief of Staff of the Blue House said in a trembling voice.\nIt's a coup.\nOh yes... I know because I saw it.\nIt's not that rare. It was an occasional event for a thick-haired Orc general to stage a coup d'état with the support of the Orc warriors.\nIt's not just Wuhan. Shizhuang Hohehao Jinan Nanchang Shenyang Xi'an Chengdu... Coups by orcs have occurred simultaneously all over the Chinese continent!\nThey have one thing in common.\nIt was a democratic vote.\nEh?\nan orc?\n* * * *\nMore than 30 years ago after a cataclysm many countries were destroyed or divided.\nMainland China for example. This great country which once boasted the largest size in the world was eventually thoroughly divided by local warlords due to the appearance of the Great Devil and accumulated damage from the Black Gate.\nIn addition the Middle East suffers from a permanent shortage of hunters due to the thorough exclusion of female hunters and Africa does not even have the minimum infrastructure to discover and nurture hunters.\nSouth America where magical awakeners are not hunters but rather the cartel's assault captains.\nCountries with a low population compared to their huge territories such as Russia and Central Asia where the number of hunters is extremely low in an overly large land mass.\nOf course there was a movement to train hunters somehow with the national budget. However if you train hunters at best they are often blown away by headhunting in advanced countries with good conditions.\nLack of money in the country meant that it would soon become a weak Hunter country which again repeated the vicious cycle of weakening national competitiveness.\nHow did they survive the crisis more than 30 years after the cataclysm?\nThe Orc survivors are nothing short of a blessing to the Hunters.\nYes.\nsurvivors.\nThose who came from the other world have tenacious vitality and strength enough to survive in the extreme environment of the gate and among them the orcs are a representative fighting race.\nThe combat power of the survivors is guaranteed but the problem is the number. A small number of powerful people cannot cover the territory.\nOrcs have basic potential as well but they have excellent innate aggression and reproductive ability.\n“They are almost the only power that can replace Hunters.”\nAmong the survivors of the other world there were quite a few who came over as a racial unit.\nElves and dwarves were like that and there were also groups like humans witches and magic towers coming over.\nWhen first encountered with these orcs governments around the world expected them to be a nuisance.\nEven though humans and some values ??conflict there was no problem because they basically shared similar values.\nA certain amount of cultural relativism can be applied except for the cases where elves sometimes fall into eco-fascism or dwarves require customs of hospitality when visiting breweries in groups.\nHowever the orcs were very different from the existing heterogeneous tribes.\nThey worshiped warriors and tried to solve everything by fighting.\nAbove all it is difficult to control because he does not intend to listen to words unless he is a warrior stronger than himself.\nIn the midst of this accepting the orcs as survivors seemed risky.\nThat's how Orcs wandered around without a proper nationality for quite some time working as mercenaries.\nWe the Free People's Republic of Wuhan encourage active naturalization of Orc survivors!\nThe first start was one of 53 countries claiming to be the heirs of the torn continent.\nThe number of Hunters was rapidly declining every year due to the constant budget spent on training Hunters and emigration to developed countries with good conditions if raised well.\nWe guarantee the home and legal rights of naturalized Orcs and promise special benefits if you participate in the raiding party.\nThat's how the orc migration began.\nAt first everyone looked at the large-scale orc migration in the Republic of Wuhan negatively.\n- They are savage guys who only know how to fight.\n- It will definitely cause problems.\nAmid such concerns the world discovered an unexpected advantage of the orc colonists.\n-Certainly Orcs fight well. An adult orc warrior is at the level of a tolerable B-class hunter.\n- It's surprising that this is the minimum.\nYou fight well of course.\n-Aren't they resting? I finished yesterday's attack and went straight to the next gate.\n-Leave it. From an early age shopkeepers punch each other as a game.\nWith the belligerence characteristic of the Orcs they found the gate on their own and attacked it. Not only that-\n-politics? we don't care about that\n- Why are leaders so weak? Why do you fight only with fists in the National Assembly?\nHe rejects the orders of those weaker than himself but instead it leads to extreme indifference to politics.\nAlthough they often caused problems due to their natural aggression and violence they did not dare to come out of the area just by designating an orc residence.\nIn addition when it comes out of the residence to attack the gate it is enough to use a dedicated isolation truck. Even with the way they were transported like prisoners the Orcs liked the monster truck which was roomy even for 50 tribal warriors.\nIn this way when the Republic of Wuhan successfully operated orcs third world countries thought this.\nIs there a super fighting race that will take care of the gate and attack on its own if you give it roughly land and provide food support?\nIsn't this completely sweet?\nThat's how the third world countries which are weak hunters scrambled to accept orc migrants and in the end the migration business of ‘exporting' orc warriors became prevalent.\nOf course that doesn't mean they don't cause problems.\nA thick-haired general orc launching a coup d'état or causing a riot in the streets.\nBecause of his innate aggression and fighting power the scale was severe if he had an accident.\nHowever the orc warriors were attractive enough to take such a risk.\nVote! Go!\nVote! Go!\nso that.\nthird world. In other words 49 of China's 53 countries most of which claimed nominal democracy were under permanent rule by dictators.\nAmong those 49 countries 27 countries that actively accepted orc migrants and had an orc general in every region faced a coup d'état by the orc generals.\n[I am Brigadier General Karim the great orc warrior! I intend to return power to the citizens without any selfishness!]\nThe irony that the government is overthrown by Orcs whom the dictators mass emigrate to maintain their military and hunter power and then those Orcs stage a coup to return democracy to the citizens.\nCitizens came to face the slogans of Orcs and Democracy that couldn't match.\n-Orcs... Encourage voting.\n-Is this okay? It's good that our dictator's pig's head flew off...\n-Here is the Republic of Beijing and we set fire to our tin navel. It's a pig that sucks the people's blood... burning in real time.\n-Are you an orc? It's hot...\nCitizens accepted the coup of the orcs but were greatly embarrassed that they had chosen a democratic vote rather than a dictatorship.\nIn any case the revival of democracy is welcomed by citizens.\nThere were many excuses such as the need for strong governance until the national emergency or the gate crisis is resolved but in the end the dictators have been doing it for 20 or 30 years so it was not like a country.\nIf you know that part the orcs will reveal the details of their hidden wealth while splitting the heads of dictators in a coup d'état.\n-Crazy... How could there be so many thieves in this country!\n-You stole an American gate surveillance lens sold it and replaced it with a cheap one? Did you sell national security too?!\nThe Orcs who caused national resentment conducted elections for the President President and Prime Minister as if they had promised.\nMore citizens than expected responded enthusiastically to this. But that doesn't mean they became supporters of the Orcs.\nThere were orcs among the candidates but they were human anyway.\nI am grateful for splitting the heads of the dictators but I had no intention of serving an orc as my master.\n“Brother who are you going to take pictures of?”\n“Um~ Isn’t that the number 2 sign?\nI'm number 3. I like the campaign promises too!\nThe elections began swiftly like roasting beans in a flash of lightning but citizens headed to the voting booths with high expectations.\nProper voting took place and for the first time there was representation by citizens.\nTwenty-seven countries in China cheered for the revival of democracy and thanked the orcs for willingly surrendering power in a coup d'état at least for this moment.\nUntil the next day when I saw the presidential residence burning again.\n[Vote again.]\nThe familiar Orc General twisted his cigar and declared the second coup a success toward the camera.",

      "content": "Orc Continental Federation\nOne of the continental countries where the Orc coup took place. When the second coup took place in the Republic of Wuhan citizens realized.\nThat the orcs had no intention of returning power to the citizens.\n[Orcs do not deceive the citizens!]\nCitizens also protested.\n[Resist the violence of the Orcs!]\nI also threw a Molotov cocktail.\n[Congress will not yield to guns and swords!]\nThere was also a miracle in which the agents of the dictatorship and the New Democratic Party reached an agreement.\nbut······.\n[As of this time the Orc warriors will stop attacking the gate.]\n“······!!”\nThe Orcs responded with a thorough hardline response.\nAside from their undemocratic procedures and tyrannical suppression most of the Continental nations depended on the orcs for defense.\nThe gate observation lens was frequently stolen and the reason why they were able to survive without perishing on the Chinese continent where the dungeon break rate was dozens of times higher than that of other continents was because the orcs had somehow managed to solve it.\nWhen a dungeon break occurs you have to deal with a large number of monsters at once unlike gates that can be attacked sequentially.\nTherefore there are many casualties and it is best to attack the gate quickly.\nHowever the Chinese continent has been a country where corruption has been rampant ever since China was still in good shape.\nWhether or not people die from the dungeon break if an American-made gate observation lens is stolen right away the money will be in the tens of billions so the party officials will have to turn their eyes.\nThere is only one thing that maintains the right to life of such contradictory and corrupt countries. It was because they accepted the Orcs in other words...\nThe Chinese Continent entrusted my lifeline to the Orcs. It's only natural that this happened.\nTsk tsk. I didn't think of fighting myself and entrusted the military authority to someone else.\nOh Kang-hyeok president of the Association shook his head in agreement with Leon's clicking sound.\nThis incident. There must be someone behind them.\nYes I recognized it according to Your Majesty's words.\nWhile the Chinese continent was swallowed up by Orc-style democracy countries around the world mobilized their information assets.\nThere are beings that unite orcs from all over the world. They are ‘dark-skinned orcs'.\nalso······.\nOrc warriors who have fought endlessly in the Pandemonium including Orc Grand Khan Murka Balak. It seems that they rallied and agitated the Orc tribes in various places.\nOriginally Orcs are a race that is not interested in politics. All they pursue is power.\nThat is the orc's greatest strength and greatest weakness. They know war but they don't know politics.\nBut this move... was thoroughly political.\nOh Kang-hyeok who was briefed on the detailed process was overcome with surprise and fear.\nThey rallied orcs from all over the world staged simultaneous coups and uttered the slogan of democracy.\nAlthough the vote did not go my way a coup was immediately launched but even this seemingly simple ignorant second coup had a certain message.\nYou guys have no alternative but us.\nA strategy that makes you realize it thoroughly pretending to be simple yet cunning.\nIt pretends to be a democracy and gives citizens a choice but in reality it is a trick to make the citizens surrender themselves.\nWhile organizing information to report to Leon Oh Kang-hyeok suddenly discovered that the timing of the appearance of the Black Orcs was coincidental.\nThey appeared half a year ago...\nThey appeared shortly after Leon defeated Rakshaar.\nIsn't there a devil behind them?\nAt Kanghyuk Oh’s reasonable guess Leon shook his head.\nNo even though they acknowledge the strong they are not the ones who will give in to a different race. All these plans and decisions must have come from Murka Balak.\nMurka Balak...\nHe heard about the Orc Great Khan from Leon but even Oh Kang-hyeok couldn't believe it.\nBeing able to order a thoroughly political movement from dull orcs is something that is usually not possible with charisma.\nIn other words Murka Balak has the power to control orcs and the cunning to think politically.\nIt's a formidable opponent.\n“Yes he is a formidable fellow. Besides he is blessed by their gods.”\n“God bless you?”\nIt seems that the Orcs of Earth don't have a particular god to believe in. But not in Jim's world.\nLeon saw occasional Orc warriors in his world who were protected by the Orc Gods.\nHelcan warriors.\nGokrok's Shamans.\nHunters of Skunic.\nAmong them the objects called champions had the strength of the Holy Grail Knight class.\n“Are you saying that you are a Holy Grail Knight?”\nOh Kang-hyeok reacted in amazement but Leon was not that surprised. It happened often in his world.\nRather the Orcs he encountered on this earth were just too weak.\nWhat is your government's position?\nLeon wanted to confirm the government's intention at this time. Oh Kang-hyeok was embarrassed and answered cautiously.\nThe government is entirely on your side. We have orcs as potential enemies. We believe they will emerge as a major security threat to our unified Korea.\nHowever you can't blindly be hostile. You Earthlings unlike us are not unconditionally hostile to Orcs.\n······Yes if we call it a preventive war and launch a preemptive strike the international community won't wait and see. Sanctions and condemnation will follow.\nAnd that is burdensome for South Korea which has just achieved reunification.\nLike Lionheart it would be impossible for War Knights to attack the Orc tribe individually.\nKnowing such a notion Leon also did not touch the surviving orcs of this world.\nEven if Leon seems too foolish and easy-going he doesn't get involved in the rule of legitimate leaders.\nHowever you guys will soon find out. Orcs those beasts are not the ones who can coexist with humans.\nLeon said that and turned his back.\nOriginally foolish children learn by blood.\n[The 37th day of the Orc coup! Formation of Orc Continental Federation! Federation Leader Great Khan Murka Balak!!]\nIn the end the Orc Continental Federation was launched amidst the chaos of the world.\n* * * *\nCitizens resisted as the orcs set up simultaneous coups and de facto dictatorships.\nBut no matter what the powerless citizens say the orcish dictators gradually began to take over the country.\nIn the modern economic structure of the 21st century magic stone-related businesses obtained from monsters account for a huge portion.\nEspecially in coastal countries where industrial complexes are lined up China is dependent on the gate industry for most of its economy as it is inland and in the west which is blocked by deserts.\nHowever since the people who collect magic stones from that gate are sinful orcs the economy cannot function without orcs.\n-scary. The momentum of the Chinese Orcs right now is not normal.\n- We have cut off all transactions with brokers who previously handed over manastones and items at bargain prices. They decided not to do business with humans at all.\n- Even if the orcs strike for just a week the Chinese republics will be in trouble.\n-How on earth did the orcs figure out this economic weakness?\nThe Chinese continent which depended on the orcs in all aspects of security economy and society could not endure when they made up their minds and usurped the government.\nThey sought out the Orcs for peaceful negotiations.\nThe culprit behind all this. black orcs.\nAnd to Murka Balak the Great Khan of the Orc Continental Federation who has shown overwhelming charisma that has commanded numerous orcs under his command over the past six months.\nYou want to negotiate?\nMurka looked down at the negotiators while sitting on a scrap chair escorted by Krann the highest-ranking orc shaman and black orcs.\nFrom skeletons animal bones and primitive weapons to cutting-edge magic weapons that cannot be seen on Earth fragments of frozen giants... and recently familiar star iron with a subtle brilliance.\nAll the elements that make up the chair seemed to symbolize the chronology of a great conqueror.\nMurka naturally looked down at the negotiating team and in international diplomacy no one could complain despite his arrogant behavior that was close to rudeness.\npresence.\nThe energy naturally exuded by a lion heart king a demon lord or a being with a different status as a living being was not something that mere humans could resist.\n“Yes the recent unrest only brings misfortune and division. For true democratization——”\njoy!\nThe person who spoke out flinched at the openly mocking snort.\nHe was the former Chairman of the People's Republic of Tianjin and Murka knew his history.\nIt's ridiculous that a guy who used to be an agent of a warlord dictatorship talks about democratization.\nThat that's...!\nAfter countering with their logic Murkha looked down at the former powers that had been ousted by a coup.\nAnd the camera that relays all of this.\n“I have to ask you one thing. Can you guys attack and dismantle the gate by yourself?”\nattack the gate.\nThe reason Orcs migrated entirely to this continent.\nThey didn't have the strength to attack the gate on their own so they accepted a heterogeneous species called Orcs.\nYeah that's how much...\nCran.\nYes Great Khan.\nAt Murka's words an old orc shaman brought a pad that was not suitable for an orc.\nHe skilfully handed over modern culture and recited reports.\nSince the Orc's strike against the gate the dungeon break rate has jumped tenfold. Geukkeuk the combat power of the human hunters is terrible. Well all the high-level gates are left to the Orcs.\nIn China human hunters made it their business to hunt wild monsters on the streets.\nThis is because attacking the gate is risky and a huge tax has been attached to it.\nIt is much more profitable for them to hunt wild monsters and sell magic stones and drop items on the black market.\nOn the other hand manastone mining or drop items are just simple loot for Orcs. Since they didn't pay attention to the tribal tax they obtained the orcs had no choice but to attack all the gates.\nIt's really not the same power. Negotiation is established in an equal relationship. Your strength is not equal to mine.\n······.\nIt's embarrassing but it's a fact that I have no choice but to admit. No one here had the strength to challenge Murka and its forces.\nHah but humans are all over the country's industrial base! Do the orcs know about finance? Production and processing industries are all humans—\nIt sounds like a worker. Do you guys treat workers equally?\nUgh...\nIt was a battle that had no choice but to lose. On the continent the strength of Orcs and Humans is not equal.\nDon't overestimate your workforce. I don't need you guys. But you guys do need me and my men.\nNow are you and I equal?\nA very simple logic. Murka's question penetrated the complacency of mainland China countries.\n‘how···! How can an orc!'\n‘Is this really an orc? Aren't all orcs stupid?'\n‘It was in vain to try to regain my position somehow by coaxing me out!'\nBecause they are not equal they cannot negotiate and because they cannot negotiate they have no choice but to surrender.\nYou guys failed. Because of your failure you left the gate to the orcs. We hunted the monsters that popped out of there and you guys shared the by-products.\nMurka saw every side of the humans gathered here.\nFor the past six months I came down here to watch the world through a deal with demons.\nMurka felt as he quietly and surely obeyed the orcs spread across the continent and reigned as their king.\nYou are full of contradictions. Neither society nor the system is rational.\nMurka's gaze contained contempt. It is a sharp gaze filled with sincerity.\nWhen discussing fairness very few powerful people hold and shake everything. They pretend to set common goals for the group but it is too easy to get mixed up and lacks rationality.\nweak meat diet. The group's purpose is more complex than anyone else's even though they are simpler creatures than anyone else.\nThose are the people of Earth that Murka has seen.\nAt least I'm not. Orcs are different. Like you I'm not mistaken that I'm equal by falling into contradictory self-contradictions.\nWhat what...\nMy rule will be reasonable. I will not waste my resources on irrational prejudice and stupidity like yours.\nMurka said looking over the camera that was focused on her.\nCitizens will be protected by the Orcs. However the price is not as cheap as before.\nThus it refers to the natural right to rule and the duty of a subject.\nFuck off. And accept. Bow your head and swear allegiance. Only obedience will keep you alive.\nIt was no different from any medieval kingdom.\n* * * *\nAre you okay?\nThe pinnacle of the Black Orcs and the chieftain of all Orcs in the Chinese continent. There was only one person who could treat Murka so lightly.\nWhat do you mean?\nRigardo the great warrior of the four beast gods. He asked Murka the champion of the three great gods of Orcs.\nThat's definitely going to do something.\nI guess so.\nBesides didn't the boss also need human labor? I said this but society doesn't work without labor.\nNeedless to say the combat power of the Orcs was not overwhelming but their numbers were not enough to overwhelm the humans.\nThe total number of Orcs spread across the continent was less than 2 million. On a continent boasting a population of 500 million this number is less than a small minority.\nOf course there are a whopping 700000 Orc warriors who are treated as at least a B-class hunter level. It is an enormous force but it is only distributed across the continent and managed by Murka.\nIn other words if you only aim for Murka the head of the Orc Continental Federation you might think it's worth trying.\nRigardo. The great warrior of the smelly beast gods. Do you think you are equal to me?\n······.\nAt that question Rigardo smiled wryly.\nHundreds of years since he joined the Orcs to escape Lionheart's slaughter of barbarians.\nSomehow I fought the demon lord's legion and went to the Demon World together.\nIn that extreme battlefield most of the cultists of the Beast God died and only one person who could be said to be the spokesperson of the Beast God remained including Rigar.\nNo Boss and I are not equal.\nRigardo fully understood the natural dynamics of power.\nYes does that hurt your pride? Do you want to twist your stomach and aim for my neck?\nI can't. I'm thinking of increasing my strength but I don't think I can win against you.\nRigardo was convinced. Even the monstrous Vulcanus who was regarded as the best vessel of the beast gods could not stand against the Lion Heart King.\nThen the only thing that can deal with the monsters among the monsters that will go down in history is the orc right in front of them.\nKeuhehe yes. But those humans aren't like that.\nMurka saw former powerful people who couldn't hide their contempt for her until the end. They will do anything for their lost power.\n“This race does not easily give in to other races by nature. That is why he dared to use the word ‘negotiation’ without understanding the subject.”\nKnowing their own weakness they ask for the distribution of power while talking nonsense about justification and equality.\nWhat a huge delusion that is.\nThe weak are protected within the fence built by the strong. Then you should learn to obey the owner of the fence.\nThat is Murka's weak-knowledge.\nThe right to rule and the duty of a subject.\nIt is by no means different from Lionheart's Lionheart. That's why-\n“There can’t be two suns under the sky. I’m looking forward to it.\nAs if the strongest orc in history foresaw this——\nYou don't have to be fair against orc beasts. Lord Spinner let's begin.\n[Kick! Preparing for the pilot operation of the ‘peacock level'.]\nThis clash is inevitably foretold.",

      "content": "crash\nThe third world countries gradually felt a survival crisis from the power of the orcs and those who were cornered took extreme action.\n-It is because of the black orcs that stupid orcs can do such collective action.\n-If we just get rid of the leadership they will return as before.\n-Fortunately the guys are vigilant. Demonstrations are still being held across the country and a decision must be made before the Orcs strike prolongs.\nThe Orc Federation has yet to show any hard suppression of the citizens.\nConfronting the demonstrators were human cops and they were desperate too.\nIf they can't subdue them and the orcs directly suppress them... it will inevitably result in a massacre.\nIn addition economic problems were also serious. Ten days have passed since the general strike of the Orcs was declared.\nWestern civilization rebelled against the election results and staged another coup criticizing the orcs' strike but the orcs did not snort.\nAlthough they dispatched a small number of hunter raiding parties they could not cover the vast Chinese continent.\n-The number of dungeon breaks has reached a critical level. We need to kill Murka or something and push those beasts through the gate.\n-But they disappeared after the last negotiations. It seems to be prepared for an attack...\n- No problem with that part. Wuhan City Republic of Wuhan. I figured out that they were gathered there.\n-How do you get that information? Since that day none of our satellites have been launched.\n-Whoops there is a sponsor.\nThe identity of the sponsor was not disclosed by the former chairman of the National Assembly but they did not have the time to confirm its authenticity.\n-How many troops can be mobilized? Hunter power matters.\n- Hunters were recruited from each country. Taegong Warriors Guild Warlord Guild Red Revolutionary Guard—-Only 50 S-class hunters and 3000 elites made up of all A-class hunters.\nIndeed continents were continents.\nEven in this place where the population has been cut in half and there is no proper training center and self-growth through fist fights there are 50 S-class hunters just by roughly gathering resistance forces.\nConsidering that there are only 20 people in Korea a strong hunter country it is a tremendous power.\n- Not only this. The sponsor provided a large amount of ‘Star Iron Arms'. It's a quantity that can arm everyone.\n-?!!\nIt was unbelievable but when the star iron armour was mentioned they guessed the identity of the sponsor.\n-Really full of gods-\n-Shh! I won't end up dying if I mention their names in this operation!\nThe knights of the Pantheon are not mere slaughter machines but soul slayers. There was no one who did not know that even demons were afraid of their power of extinction.\n- On the surface it is a warehouse for iron and steel belonging to the pantheon.\n-What is the enemy power?\n-According to the supporter's observations he is touring the federation with less than 500 SS.\n- Cheeky bastards.\nOrcs are a valuable military resource.\nI admit that much but that's it.\nThe anti-orc alliance could not accept the sight of savage beasts on top of human heads.\nTo be precise they couldn't admit that their power was being taken away.\n* * * *\nsilent Night. Bombardments from fighter jets glow red and the spreading flames illuminate the city.\nA signal came from the radio at the same time as the air force successfully bombed the government building in Wuhan.\n[The air corps in Tianjin and Shenyang succeeded in preemptive strikes. Enter.]\nDamn Orcs.\nHwang Chun-zai an S-class hunter of the anti-orc union felt a sense of contempt when he thought of the orcs who must have been crushed by the collapsed government building.\nThe 34th day of simultaneous Orc coups on the continent. In the meantime Hunters from all over the continent had to feel deprived as they saw their marks so easily taken over by the Orcs.\nThey were the largest country in the world just 20 years ago. Even though they were torn to pieces with 53 pieces and pointed their guns at each other it was all in order to restore the glory of the past.\nThe unified China is the best in the world. A country with such potential was taken away by such beasts.\n‘I wonder if they'll allow the beasts to stand on top of us.'\nToday I will annihilate those black orcs and reclaim the name of my country.\n[Enemy units found! I will go into battle!]\nThe battle slowly began.\nHwang Chun-zai and the anti-orc union hunters believed in victory without doubt.\n50 powerful S-class hunters who rose up for their country from all over the continent. For the stealth of the master 3000 people consisting of only the most elite A-class hunters were gathered.\nThey are veterans who have hunted as many orcs as they could at the gate.\nEach one of them is an elite that can deal with an orc warrior. With just five hundred orcs——\n[Quaaaaaagh!]\n[What kind of monsters...! support! Support——!?]\n?!!\nA shrill scream erupted from within even without the radio or through him.\nThe screams that are not buried even in the noise of battle amplify anxiety.\nThe sounds of the radio burst from here and there proving that the situation on the battlefield was never smooth.\nCaptain! What should I do?\nWe are in a hurry too!\nHwang Chun-zai thought that his allies could not be defeated easily.\nJust now the radio was from Jinbao's unit a leading S-class hunter in the Chinese continent.\nThere was no way the powerful force which included only ten S-class hunters could be defeated by only Orcs.\nAn orc Daekan appeared in Jinbao's troops! Kill him and the Orc Federation will end!\nIndeed do you have the qualifications to serve as the captain of the Orcs? Hwang Chun-zai rather saw this as an opportunity.\nIf only that orc is killed the Orc Federation will collapse in an instant. Then this rebellion is a success.\n“We are here! Where is the Great Khan——!”\nthe scene of the battle.\nThere black orcs were slaughtering the hunters of the anti-orc alliance.\nJinbao the S-class hunter the pride of the Chinese continent was held captive by his hair leaving only the ‘neck' while bleeding profusely.\nWhat is that guy?\nAn ax soaked in dripping blood. Helcan's champion Balbaza who had a fierce impression full of scars stared at Hwang Chun-zai who had arrived while the battle was over.\nNo that's ridiculous. How can you already...\nThere were only ten S-class Hunters. In the rest there are hundreds of elites with numerous quasi-S and A-ranks. But what if less than a hundred black orcs slaughtered the most elite hunters?\nWhat are you going to do Captain? I killed them all because I was too weak.\nThe end of Balbaza's gaze. There a black gnome was clicking his tongue.\nThe second-in-command of the Black Orcs. It was Krann Murka's right-hand man.\nWhat can I do? Humans are weak. Tsk tsk I miss the days when I ran into knights.\nRecalling the nostalgic past Krann pointed his staff at Hwang Chun-zai and the Hunters.\nsomething is coming! It was Hwang Chun-zai and the hunters who instinctively activated the defense skill at the moment but swallowed the shame saying that they were deceived when nothing happened soon.\nuh?\nHwang Chun-zai who was about to strike back at Cran at any moment felt a strange pressure.\nAs if a huge presence was looking down on them—\nNow wait.\nLooking up there were huge blazing green eyes looking down at them.\n< Gokrok's Gaze >\nThe next moment a green ray hit Hwang Chun-zai and the Hunters.\nOops. They said it was used as a material.\nKrann snorted at Balbaza's question.\nThe next guys don't kill enough and catch them.\nSaying so Krann's gaze turned toward the void.\nThe black sea where the light that spreads roaring in the blazing fire does not reach. When the Great Khan intercepted the jokjok with his eyes on him he finally appeared with the highest level of equipment.\n“Is that the robot that even the great devils of wisdom said were annoying?”\n-·······.\nBehind the supply of arms and intelligence to the Anti-Coalition. That obvious malice was directed at the Orc Continental Federation.\nIt's scary it's scary.\nIn response to the chillingly inorganic gaze of the machine Krann smiled and disappeared into the darkness.\n* * * *\nHalf a year in which mankind's activities in outer space were reduced due to Rakshaar. Yapi launched a new space integrated armament platform and at the same time sent a system to defend against the enemy's satellite being shot down.\nDuke-class non-combat observation mode.\nIt has a sleek design and has the form of a bipedal robot that resembles a human at first glance.\nEven though it was an unfinished weapon this machine noticed its presence and even evaded Murka's green beam which attempted to intercept it.\nIt is easy to be shot down with a stationary satellite so it was a ducal class that was monitoring the Orc Continental Federation from space instead of a satellite but this time the anti-orc alliance's subjugation failure was to the point that it was difficult for even Yapi to report.\n-Kick.\nYapi who turned the Duke class into autopilot mode looked at the eyes staring at them.\nIs it a failure?\n-·······.\nIn response to Beatrice's water Yappy mechanically nodded in affirmation.\nKeukeuk that's why you can't do that with such ragtag people.\nDon't laugh Lord Vulcanus. A precious life is gone.\nAt Karina's point Vulcanus barely held back his laughter.\nWell it's just that I don't have a broad sense of humanity enough to be sad about the deaths of a few of those reckless bastards. The only thing I love is the people of the gods.\nYes before His Majesty's baptism Kyung was the greatest villain of the century.\nA hardliner in the kingdom who insisted on wiping out the empire. Vulcanus has no love for humanity that loves and embraces everyone.\nBut I can't believe... that amount of power would be overwhelmed like this...\nGoo Dae-seong who watched the battle video looked shocked.\nIt must have been so seeing S-class hunters who were once in a far-off celestial realm fall down like this.\nOrc champions... secondly not all black orcs are usually strong.\nHe literally crushed the best of S-class hunters and A-class hunters.\nIt's not that there hasn't been any damage among the Black Orcs but there have been dozens of damage. It is no exaggeration to say that the battle ratio is 100:1.\nBy the way what does His Majesty think? Guys formidable.\nWell he's strong for a beast.\nLeon said that but there was no sign of belittling it. Leon's gaze turned to Yapi.\nYes how do you think Sir Spinner? You are better than us when it comes to analysis.\n-Minimum A-rank Hunter or higher. Among them the best. It is estimated to have the same fighting power as the Holy Grail Knights.\nWhat about the champions?\n-Check the use of ‘divine power'. Analysis result... Holy Grail Knight level.\nindeed.\nLeon is the scabbard of the holy sword. He said while holding the holy relic of King Sim the first messenger.\nI have seen three orc champions at the gate of Lord Zereah's relic convoy. Perhaps in the original history the reason why Zereah finally failed to escort the relic was because they intervened.\nThey have the power to subdue even the Holy Grail Knights.\nKuh isn't it a big deal? Even Murka wasn't usually strong...\nGoo Dae-seong's anxiety caused Leon to smile and look at him.\nI don't know sir but in the past in the kingdom of Lionheart it's not that strange.\nHumans and Orcs.\nTwo races occupying similar living areas have inevitably competed for survival.\nWhat Leon was surprised about in this world was that Orcs were weaker than he had imagined. But now it seems that I know the difference between the gap.\nThey have been fighting each other constantly representing the power of the gods. They have been fighting each other for hundreds and thousands of years and they have been fighting each other to death.\nLeon's gaze returned to Goo Dae-sung. To him who does not understand the strength of an orc to a saint who is still young.\nThe strongest guardian Jim and the strongest Holy Grail Knights in history were under Jim's command. How is it that the orcs did not become extinct?\nBecause they are so strong.\nIf they did not grow into monsters in the endless competition for survival they would have gone extinct long ago.\nThere are only hundreds of ghosts who remember those days now. The number of them has also decreased considerably.\n50 members of the Burning Sword Knights including Leon Karina and Vulcanus.\nHundreds of Black Orcs including Murka Krann orc champions and the last messenger of the Beast God.\nThe time has come to end this tedious blood feud.\n[Exactly!]\nThe goddess of light and justice proclaimed the lion heart king's declaration.\n[The time has come to put an end to the gods of those insolent beasts! Sound the war horn! The true war will open!]\nGod of war and flame. Lionheart's blood boils in front of the main reason why mankind came to believe in war.\n“The true enemy of us Lionhearts is the Orcs from the beginning. This is the same for mankind on this planet. This is a race for survival at the stake of species.”\nThe cause of the international community is fine. Even if they are cautious Lionheart will prepare for a showdown with the Orcs.",

      "content": "Heilong People's Republic\nAfter the formation of the Orc Continental Federation a massive surprise attack by the Anti-Orc Alliance which took place in the middle of the night turned into a fiasco.\nTruly a one-sided slaughter. The high-ranking hunters that the Chinese continent was proud of were literally pulverized.\n-That... How are you going to win?\n-Crazy S-class hunters are no match.\n-Isn't that armament a star iron weapon? Was it something that could be torn like that?\n-It's said that if you don't have faith you can't apply blessings to armor but it's at least a unique level equipment...\nThe crushing defeat of the Anti-Orc Alliance broke the will of the people of mainland China to resist.\nAs most of the Chinese continent went through the de facto surrender process the resurrection of the world's largest country by the Orcs was becoming a fait accompli.\nWe stand against the dictatorship!\nOrcs do not trample on the will of the citizens!\nThere was a place where the fire of resistance was not extinguished.\nYou arrogant bastards. Still resisting.\neastern continent. Heilong People's Republic located in the northernmost part.\nIt is the most important continental country in terms of food security the biggest threat after the Gate incident as it owns the Beidahuang Plain one of the continent's grain belts.\nThe third coup had already taken place there but the citizens' will to fight did not disappear.\nThe cause was clear.\nWe are the followers of the Pantheon! This land is protected by the gods of the Pantheon!\nThe People's Republic of Heilong is one of the most famous countries where the belief in the pantheon has spread.\nEven though it has a huge granary called Beida Huang it copes with the slow gate unique to the dictatorial military regime. Due to insufficient power dungeon breaks occurred frequently and the land was contaminated with magical energy.\nThe priests of Goddess Demera preached the teachings and not only restored the earth's intellect but there was also a famous story of a knight in this place-\nThe People's Republic of Heilong is a land protected by the Holy Grail Knight of life and abundance Lord Gu Dae-seong! How dare the orcs dare!\nBefore Koo Dae-seong awakened as a Holy Grail Knight his heroic story of defeating wild monsters and saving people while training as a knight became extremely famous after he became a Holy Grail Knight.\nKoo Dae-seong is already a hero here in Heilong People's Republic of China. They had no doubt that the pantheon would block the tyranny of the orcs.\nWhen that led to the fifth coup Black Oak Bulltan who was in charge of this place hit the occupied presidential palace table with his fist.\nDamn them! They keep bothering me! I'm going to wipe them all out!\nBulltan even felt displeasure at the relentless resistance of humans. Black Orc Grokhan who is the same to him dissuades him.\nStop it burn. Didn't the Great Khan command it? We must never use forceful suppression. At least we shouldn't be stained with the blood of the Orcs.\nHmph! I know brother. Political blah blah blah blah. Murka-sama is too cautious.\nAt Bultan's blasphemous words Grokhan shoved him on the shoulder.\nBe careful with your mouth Bultan. The Great Khan does not condone disrespect.\nI just did it. Didn't the other brothers say they fought an honorable battle against the humans? But we're in this corner chasing after the kids.\nThe orc in uniform flinched in the back seat at the words of the fire.\nHe is the Orc General Groom of the People's Republic of Heilong. The reason Black Orcs came to the Heilong People's Republic of China was because he did not properly control the Heilong People's Republic.\nSorry great warrior.\nThe senile Orc General bowed his head in front of Bultan and Grokan. There is no humiliation there. He is the most powerful orc warrior in the People's Republic of Heilong but the two black orcs in front of him were strong on a different level.\nThere is no shame in orcs submitting to a great warrior. Besides they brought a new ‘faith'.\nThe three great gods of Orcs.\nThe faith they brought to the Orcs immediately fell in love.\nYou can become strong but there is no reason not to fall for it.\nOriginally Orcs did not believe in religion but after seeing the transcendent strength of the Black Orcs the Green Orcs willingly believed in the Orc Gods.\nBut the power of the pantheon that has taken root in this land is also formidable. They will not back down easily.\nHmph! Deploy more human cops! Beat them all! That's what I mean!\nGroom was perplexed by the force of the fire. He is a worn-out Orc enough to hold the rank of general in human society.\nAlthough he didn't understand human rights and whatnot he knew from knowledge.\nIt's not like yesterday or today to suppress the protesters hard but the level of suppression the Black Orcs want isn't going to be like that.\nIt was the fourth election soon. I will look around and come back.\nBurn!\nDon't worry brother. I'm just going to see what kind of things he's talking about.\nGrokan couldn't stop the burning fire he was talking about. Of course so is General Groom.\nAlthough uneasy Grokan had no choice but to follow the fire.\n* * * *\nThe Heilong People's Government was already holding its fourth election this time.\nfour coups. four elections\nMost continental nations succumbed to the Orcs and accepted their rule.\nOriginally the countries of the Chinese continent did not have many anti-government actions such as protests.\nThis is because dictatorships do not have the capacity to participate in protests as it is difficult to suppress protesters and make a living right away.\nOn a fictional day the exploding dungeon break causes the land to become polluted and the place to live gradually disappears so it's only natural.\nBut Heilong People's Republic was different.\n[Heilong People's Bureau. Mansinjeon-led land development project triggered.]\n[Sir Yacht Spinner developing a large-scale high-tech agricultural complex.]\nThey saw hope for the future as the pantheon advanced and spread their faith in the People's Republic of Heilong where there was little hope for the future.\nThey would rather have the pantheon rule them than accept the rule of the orcs.\nSymbol No. 2 Liu Yi-Ming! As a follower of Goddess Ariana I will bring about the development of our Heilong People's Republic!\nThus the fourth candidate for the election was candidate Liu Yi-ming who was an official fan of the pantheon.\nHe ran in the election with the support of an enthusiastic populace an overwhelming approval rating compared to General Groom who ran in the election despite losing three times.\n“Tch weaklings squeak like mosquitoes.”\nBulltan clicked his tongue as he watched the procession of protesters.\nFilthy-looking guys hold up pickets and say what to say about the orcs and step back.\nThings that can't even be eaten in one hand run wild so Bultan a born warrior has no choice but to be angry.\nBurn. Once again keep in mind what the Great Khan has commanded.\nWorried that Bultan might swing an ax at the protesters Grokhan warned him again. Bultan answered honestly even though he thought he was a nag.\nDon't worry brother. You worry too much.\nWhoa...\nCan I really trust you? Groh Khan was worried but he trusted his brother who had fought alongside him for hundreds of years.\nAnyway it seems that Lionheart's faith has spread quite a bit here.\nI heard that Lion Heart King came to Earth earlier than we did. Since he settled down first his power is greater than ours.\nIt seems they haven't even formed a nation yet?\nIt's not that the elder couldn't tell you he said ‘I didn't do it'.\nLionheart's strength comes not from the size of the country but from the wide spread of faith.\nThe Lion Heart King must have known that if he established a nation and started conquest he would face opposition from the existing nations.\nThat's why the power of faith that they can't deny. He said that he was gradually taking over the world through Demera's blessed crops and Dragonia's golden contract.\nAs Grokan heard it he thought that the Lion Heart King was a cunning man.\nThe belief in the pantheon is completely from another world but the benefits of that belief cannot be denied.\nIt is the faith of the pantheon that can only be encroached upon knowingly and with enough time it will soon be able to take over the world.\n‘The elder said he would follow the method of the pantheon. He joins the Orcs of the world into a federation to expand his power and increase his strength. That's the big picture the Great Khan draws.'\nUntil then it is necessary to increase and stabilize the forces and now the Orcs are not suppressing the protesters by force.\nGiving no room for Lionheart or other countries to interfere.\nThat is the big picture of Murka who is aiming for a one-on-one battle with Lionheart while maximizing the power of the Orcs.\nThere's an orc!\nBut then one of the demonstrators pointed a finger at Bultan and Grokhan.\nHmm?\nBurtan and Grokhan looked at each other with puzzled eyes.\nIt is also true that at the same time as the shouts of the protesters some protesters started pouring in.\nOrcs go back home!\n“go back! go back!”\nHearing the protesters' harsh voices Grokhan was worried that the fire would run amok but he was surprisingly calm.\nHeh talk only with your mouth.\nHe didn't look like the little dwarves no more than a fistful in size were screaming in front of him.\nIf it was an orc I'd rather pick up an ax and wield it but humans are just as weak in their way of protesting as their weakness.\nLet's go back Grokhan. I don't think there's anything more to see.\nYeah that's a good idea.\nIt was when Bulltan turned his back enduring better than expected.\n-grasp!\nSomething hit him on the back and yellow liquid flowed out. It was an egg thrown by protesters.\nThese children...\nAs the flames roared and strode toward the protesters the protesters had no choice but to shrink in front of the huge orc.\nbut.\nWherever you go there are bold people.\nWhat? What are you going to do? You bastards!\nThis bastard?\nBulltan growled and looked down at the human in front of him.\nDo you want to die human?\nUh! I want to die dude! Uh! Kill me!\nAre you crazy? Grokan was suspicious of what the human in front of him believed.\n“Burn we have to endure here.”\nMurka never allowed the orcs to intervene in the protesters.\nRather even if he loses the election he is in the position that it is enough to cause another coup.\nThis was a fight for cause and Lionheart's inability to interfere in internal affairs is to expand the power of the Federation.\nIn the midst of that if he offered an excuse...\n- Took!\nuh?\nhmm?\nIt happened in an instant.\nProtesters suddenly burned and knocked! And they bumped into each other a little and kudang-tang! and fell back noisily.\nAaaaaaagh!\nWhat what?\nThe protesters who collided with Bultan and Grokhan embarrassed or not rolled over the asphalt road screaming loudly.\nAigoo! Orcs are killing people! This is democracy suppression!\n“What is this human being saying!”\nOuch! Ugh! Ugh! Eh! My shoulder! My arm! My leg yeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!\nOrcs fan the protesters!\nHey take it! Take it all!\nCamera flashes going off in all directions. Dozens of smartphones took pictures of protesters violent orcs burning and grocans.\nEh these guys?!\nThe orcs didn't know.\nChinese continent. A wild land where all kinds of blackmail and insurance scams are rampant.\nIn this place the victim is the bad guy.\nThis video immediately started uploading on YouTube which is connected to the global network.\n[Shock! Orc Continental Federation suppresses the peaceful demonstrators demanding democracy with violence!]\n[Citizens assaulted by Black Orcs. Democracy cannot be lost even in critical condition! scream!!]\n[Citizens' aspirations for democracy!! Candidate Yiming Liu criticizing Candidate Groom!]\nDaejeonsa sir! What the hell did this happen!\nGeneral Groom the number 1 candidate who came to the stationed Black Orcs. He showed the video uploaded on yuptube.\nI-I've never hit you this far! Ji came and bumped into me!\nYes that's right. I saw it from the side!\nBut the video...!\nA more detailed video of the protesters was uploaded on YouTube but in that video it was a video of Black Orcs beating protesters mercilessly.\nThe number of views has already exceeded 100 million and there is no one who has not watched this video for some reason.\n[Burn! Grokan! How did this happen!]\nThe situation was so serious that even the Black Orc Command who watched the video came down with criticism. The two Black Orcs were on the verge of going crazy but—\n[Pyongyang Special Self-Governing Mayor Black Dragon! I will not stand by this situation!]\n[European Union. We strongly condemn the anti-human rights acts of the Orc Continental Confederation.]\n[President Hobson. Discussion of regulatory measures for the Ord Continental Federation.]\n[His Majesty Leon Dragonia Lionheart anger at the excessive suppression of human rights by the Orc Continental Federation!]\nThings have already happened and the super robots trying to make up for their past failures behind all of this put more effort into manipulating public opinion.\n-Kick!\n[Announcement of Heilong People's Bureau election results!

We are really unfair!\nThat's right! Protesters arbitrarily attacked us...! We've never done anything like that in the video!\nBulltan and Grokan also had unfair sides. Because they really didn't touch the protesters.\nMurka highly predicted the possibility that they had disregarded his orders but also the possibility that they were innocent.\nBack off.\nAt Murka's order to celebrate the two orcs sighed in relief and retreated while Murka sat down and let out a ferocious noise.\nIt's getting annoying.\nYes it was the land that should have been secured as a safe zone.\nMurka looked at the map. continental map. A map of the vast lands of the Chinese continent is marked with specific points.\n“Now that this has happened we will secure Jilin’s and leave.”\nI'll leave it to Skyra. But if they took over Heilong they might have noticed.\nwell.\n- Right! right!\nMurka rested her chin on it and tapped the armrest with her fingers. It is a thoughtful expression.\nThat's not something we can guess is it?\nMurka's red gaze goes beyond Krann.\nThere a goblin and a human wizard trembled with awkward smiles.\n* * * *\nThank you Your Majesty. Thanks to Your Majesty's protection we were able to win the election.\nLiu Yi-ming the new president of the Heilong People's Army bowed to Leon to the extent that it was too much to be called a president.\nFor him a member of the pantheon Ariana Church Leon is the saint of the church. Beyond politics he is only a member of the church in front of him.\nPresident Liu Yi-ming. I have introduced Sir Gu Dae-seong to help you but it is not free. So do your duty.\nOf course Your Majesty. I'm just grateful that you saved this country from the hands of those beasts.\nPresident Liu Yi-ming was a politician whom Koo Dae-sung met while serving as a knight in the Heilong People's Bureau.\nAs a city council member in a quiet rural city it seemed that he tried to help Dae-seong Goo who was hunting monsters while training as a knight at the city level.\nIn addition even if you claim the name of the goddess Ariana in politics it can be said that the first screening of the documents is passed at once because the goddess is not lacking.\n- I want you to disclose all information to this machine. Useful after proper analysis.\nPresident Liu Yi-ming did not show any antipathy toward Yapi who was giving instructions from above Hari's head.\nRather it is an honor to know and receive instructions from this mechanical saint.\nOf course Sir Yacht Spinner. With the authority of the President we will disclose all information to the Pantheon. Don't worry about the rebels. Our government intends to fully cooperate with His Majesty's ‘Lionheart Coalition'.\nLord Spinner will cooperate with you in governing the country. I will give you useful advice so follow it.\nIt was a de facto declaration of interference in internal affairs but President Liu Yi-ming showed no sign of hesitation.\nLeon does not violate the rights of the legitimate ruler.\nEven if it goes against Lionheart's rules and common sense even if it's a way to vomit the flagship of democracy not power bestowed by God.\nUmm first of all the Korean government doesn't know...\nWhen Hari pretended not to know with an embarrassing smile Leon smiled.\nIsn't this the wisdom suggested by your government?\nWell to be precise His Excellency the President informed me through the NIS...\nYeah let's do something like that.\nThe plan to form a lionheart federation by appointing an agent like President Liu Ming and gradually forming a Lionheart Federation was a plan that President Andong-gil directed directly to the National Intelligence Service.\nThe Korean government's active support for Leon was also due to food security which was linked to the Heilong People's Bureau.\nIt wasn't very pleasant for the Continental Orc Confederation to take control of China Korea's main food importer.\nYour Majesty although we did manage to subjugate the six countries of the Chinese continent...\nBut it's nothing compared to their federation.\nMore than 40 of the 53 countries on the Chinese continent were swallowed up by Orcs.\nMost of the countries that depended on the orcs for their society had to be seen as having been annexed.\nThe People's Republic of Heilong was a place where the orcs did not have a particularly strong grip so they could have been swallowed up so easily.\nWell it's good. Gradually pressing them down is enough. But is it the Lionheart Federation?\nAll of a sudden it was like following the Orcs. Leon arrived at a certain building with the knights before he knew it.\nIt was a building full of orcs.\nStop!\nAn orc in military uniform stopped Leon and Yafi and the others.\nThis is the Heilong Ministry of Defense building! Anyone can bring in——isn't that great?!\nLeon glared at the Orc soldiers and displayed his energy without hesitation.\nJust by revealing his coercive aura quite a few creatures can't even breathe.\nEven more so the opponent is a creature that is second only to the devil the enemy of the mortal enemy.\nUntil now he had allowed the existence of the orcs only out of respect for the country's rule of law and its leaders.\nPresident Liu Yi-ming handed over all authority to the king but how dare an animal block the king's path?\nAt Leon's sad gaze the Orc soldiers shrank in a cold sweat. They went straight to the walkie-talkie and waited for instructions but the voice from the walkie-talkie sounded nervous.\n[Stop it somehow! Buy time!]\nAnd the sound of the walkie-talkie could be heard clearly even by Leon.\nShallow water...\nWhen Leon smiled and gestured Yapi swung the wire in an instant.\nBig!\nThis this guy...!\nYapi and Hari who captured the Orc soldiers at once entered the Ministry of Defense building with the knights following them——\nUgh! Look at those guys!\nI don't know what to do!\nThere he found Orcs who were destroying documents.\nSubdue them. They are traitors who betrayed the country.\nAt Leon's instruction the knights began to subdue the orcs at once.\nA group of knights armed with legendary star iron weapons. The Orcs and the Ministry of Defense staff working at the government building were not able to stop it but—\n- Kwaaang!\nThe wall collapses and a giant orc appears.\nThe orc holding an ax as big as his own was fully armed.\nThese guys! Where is this place!\nGeneral Groom...!\nHari drew her sword in front of Leon. Anticipating a collision he accompanied the knights but the Orc general in front of him was on his guard.\nPlease follow the instructions calmly! We have been entrusted with authority by His Excellency Liu Yi-ming!\nNoisy! Little bitch!\nGeneral Groom's violent voice made Hari shut up.\nIndeed the legendary Orc Hunter of Heilong People's Republic. It is the momentum of a mastermind who took control of the Ministry of National Defense and launched a coup d'état by force alone to run for the president.\nClean up well. Sir Spinner with Jim.\n-Kick!\nyour majesty?!\nHari was horrified to see Yaffe leaping from above her head and following Leon.\nSah the opponent is General Groom an S-class hunter?! I'm going to fight alone?!\nHari who was left alone sent her eyes to ask for Yapira to be left but Leon's jade sound flowed indifferently.\nIf the name inherits the heart of Duke Renoir the Orc mortician even hold an orderly funeral for an animal.\nHari opened her mouth wide as Leon clicked away but no more voice came out.\nIt was because he blocked Grom's movement to swing the ax toward Leon's back.\n- Kaang!\nAxes and swords collided and the giant orc and the slender girl engaged in a power struggle.\nGet out of here bitch!\nUgh ugh!\nAmidst the loud noise Leon passed through the hallway of the building as Yapi led him. Busy moving orcs and human soldiers were numerous.\nTsk tsk. No matter how good a soldier's virtue is how can he be so loyal to beasts without honor?\n-Is it okay?\nWhat do you mean?\n-General Groom. Heilong People's Highest Rank Hunter. Hari Han. crap.\nIt's quite underrated.\n-Data don't lie.\nYou might see it that way. Groom the gate hero of the Heilong People's Republic is a worn-out S-class hunter and Hari is the youngest but it's been less than a year since he was promoted to S-class.\nEven though he's a kid he's a knight who went on a demon hunt with Jim. He's also gifted.\nFollow Yaffe down the stairs. A few orcs tried to block it but Yapi simply overpowered them with a wire.\nThe place we arrived at was the server room. It was the time when Yapi was trying to arrest an employee who tried to burn down the server room.\nBesides Hanhari's heart is against orcs—\n- Kwak!\nThe ceiling collapsed and something crashed along with it.\nHeeuk! Heeuk! Heeuk!\nIt is Hari gasping for breath and a charred Orc general. It seemed to be hidden.\nThis I'm going to win...\nOh good job.\nLeon remembered the saint of war and flame before Vulcanus. The memory of them burning the green wave in their war against the orcs.\nWell I wouldn't want that much but...\nIt was true that I was looking forward to it.\nSir Spinner. How long will it take?\n-7 seconds is enough.\nYapi transformed the mechanical arm and connected to the server room. It only takes 4 seconds for Yapi to secure all the data in the independent server of the Ministry of National Defense. It took 3 seconds to analyze all the data.\n- Results of checking data for the last 6 months. find something odd.\nWhat is it?\n- The Ragnarok Plan. There are traces of links with certain defense research institutes in the Republic of Jilin regarding the plan.\nThe Republic of Jilin was a country that invaded the Heilong People's Republic after an orc coup d'état changed the government in the past.\nAfter Yaffi stepped out to make up for the week of wrath and punished them the world of orcs was not the same as before.\nHeh. Was he the one who sold the country long ago?\nStill given that the country was taken is it a grandiose wish to wish patriotism to beasts?\n- I will dispatch an emergency response force immediately.\nDo as the Lord wills.\nAs soon as Yapi sent the message the water in the middle of the Yellow Sea shook and missiles began to rise.\n* * * *\n-Kwaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nInside the missile shaking loudly. Goo Dae-seong was very nervous about the ride which he couldn't even say with empty words.\nHeh heh Sir Koo Dae-seong! How are you so excited?\nGoo Dae-seong the image of Sir Raihar of the Burning Sword Knights eating beef jerky without wearing a seat belt.\n“Is this... is it safe?”\nA missile for transporting knights fired from a Dominator-class submarine carrier was currently passing through the stratosphere.\nIt seems far from safe even with empty words to burn five knights soar into space orbit at the speed of Mach 20 and then fall into the terminal orbit.\nWell what if it's not safe? Where can I get a ride like this?\nIsn't that unsafe?!\nGoo Dae-seong asked in shock and Raihar shrugged his shoulders and answered.\nI fall sometimes but don't worry. If you land well you won't get hurt.\nGoo Dae-sung's complexion became even more paler when he heard that he had one foot out of 20.\nOh are you okay?\n“What else wouldn’t be okay? Lord Vulcanus soars up into space and is fine even if he falls.”\nah······.\nI thought so. Vulcanus repeatedly climbs up to the stratosphere and then falls but he has never heard of anyone getting hurt.\n“Then it’s safe——!?”\nA steeply tilted interior. Goo Dae-seong had a hunch that the missile was going down.\n“Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!”\nsafety? I know you do but it's also scary. Come to think of it when he was young even when he went to an amusement park he couldn't ride a roller coaster.\nBoo Lord Vulcanus!\nHuh? What?\n“Sir Vulcanus where are you and what are you doing?”\nRegret slashes at the increasingly accelerating missile. So I resent those who are not here and say useless things saying that this is not the place for me to be.\nI heard you're going to claim the land you've been looking for as a villa!\nyes?!\nIn the midst of the fall Goo Dae-seong was horrified to see the broken metal plate of the missile creaking.\nBe safe! It's safe!!\nRed flames witnessed in the far sky while part of the missile shell fell off and disintegrated in real time.\n-GRARARARARARA——!\nPerhaps the ‘airspace' so far away that even the Holy Grail Knights cannot see it. There the Holy Grail Knight of War falling with a cheerful laugh came into view.",

      "content": "Field Battle (2)\n...\nThe past less than a year from now.\nAmong the 53 countries claiming to be the true heirs of the Chinese continent one country invaded another one.\nInvasion of the People's Republic of Heilong by the Republic of Jilin.\nThis war triggered by General Oak's coup ended with the unexpected intervention of the United States and Russia which launched satellite weapons into the Republic of Jilin without any declaration of war.\nIt was now crashed by Rakshaar but God's staff and grizzly laser satellites bombarded the Orc army of the Republic of Jilin and a certain unit took advantage of the chaos to assassinate the leader-\nThat is a generally known fact.\nThe truth is that Yapi who was intervening in the stock market in the name of a pantheon hacked the mirror's state-of-the-art satellite weapons to prevent the stock market from crashing misfired and directly assassinated the Orc leadership.\nSince then the Republic of Jilin has lost control of its national power and has been in an unstable and unstable situation.\n-Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nNational Defense Research Institute of the Republic of Jilin. To be precise dozens of missiles fell over this secret laboratory for researching and supplying gate attack equipment for the Orcs the main body of the military.\nThere was a slight error but from the missiles that fell right in front of the research center anachronistic knights in full plate armor appeared on horseback.\nWhoa whoa whoa~ Calm down old comrade.\nThe words that were tumultuous at the impact of the missile's fall quickly calmed down with the touch of an old friend.\n“Then are we right?”\nBaltan Burning Sword Holy Grail Knight Raihar looked at the large research building in front of him.\nUgh... I just communicated with you that's right...\nIt was information that the National Defense Research Institute of the Republic of Jilin was related to General Groom who had staged a coup in the Heilong People's Republic.\n“Why is General Groom related to a secret laboratory of an enemy country?”\n- Estimated to have been in contact after the ceasefire negotiations.\nSince the truce was negotiated?\nI was a little puzzled. Why did he contact the Jilin Republic Research Institute almost a year ago instead of after Murka appeared?\nWhen Koo Dae-sung seemed to be struggling Raihar gave a cool answer.\nWhat do you have to ask? Since His Majesty has taken control of the People's Republic of Heilong shouldn't that Orc General be killed?\nThat's true but...\nAnyway the fact that this laboratory has connections with General Groom. And Groom had to confirm that he intended to hand over the entire Heilong People's Republic to the Orc Continental Federation.\nBy the way Sir Yapi. Could you please send me something like that huge space weapon? Other than Marquis or Count.\n-Moving to mid-low orbit in preparation for the downfall of enemy forces. We recommend doing it locally.\nThe space platform supporting this operation cannot be fully used. This is because if you put a satellite in a high-altitude geostationary orbit that monitors the continent you will be attacked.\n-The opponent can intercept even in a circular orbit of 35786 km in the geostationary orbit. Presumed to be concept penetration by Orc's divine power.\nI don't know but it's hard anyway.\nRaihar who had no knowledge of the universe was dismissed but Goo Dae-seong who had his own knowledge of modern people was shocked.\n‘Attack a satellite in space?'\nI wondered if such a thing was possible but when I thought about it Rakshar also shot down Earth satellites throughout the universe.\nAs a Holy Grail Knight himself he wondered if such a thing would be possible but it seems that there really is no limit to the transcendental beings such as the Holy Grail guardian Leon the demon lord and the Orc Great Khan.\nI'll go in right away. Even though there's this chaos I wonder if no one is there because the lights are off—\nIt was when Raihar said so.\n- Boom!\nIt rushed with a burst of air.\nAll of the Holy Grail Knights heard the terrifying sound. But its speed is faster than sound.\nSir Raihar!\nThe only one who was able to cope with that speed was none other than Goo Dae-sung. He protected Raihar with an earth shield and when he collided with it his identity was revealed.\n‘Javelin?'\nSir Koo Dae-seong!\nThe shock didn't end there. The spear which did not lose its strength even after colliding with the earth's shield pushed Goo Daeseong forward.\n- Kwajijik!\nGoo Dae-sung's ankles dig into the ground as he blocks it with brute force. Goo Dae-seong twisted his shield slightly and the spear bounced off.\nWhoa...!\nIt was when Koo Dae-seong was relieved of the javelin of some guy.\nKoo Dae-seong! It's not over yet!\nLord Raihar's cry. Goo Dae-sung's gaze is directed toward the window embedded in the floor.\n────!!\nA strange painting carved into the window. It deviated from the window as if it were about to explode—\nDear Demera!\nStep on the ground and pour the power of the earth. A heap of dozens of tons of soil wrapped around the window but it couldn't stop all the light from leaking out.\n- Kwaaaaang!!\nA rising mushroom cloud. The aftermath of the explosion was enough to shake the armor.\nThe response was good. It's the first time I've seen it but he responded well.\nWhat the hell is that?\nIt's an explosive javelin used by hunters of the Orc hunting god Skunik. It's been a while since I've seen an explosive javelin of that level.\nKoo Dae-seong is stunned at Raihar's words. Similarly Lord Galatan of the Knights of the Burning Sword approached and testified.\nWhen Your Majesty was still a Grail Knight you've surpassed the level of the warchiefs I saw in the Orc Wars. At least an Orc Champion is here.\n... it's called bingo.\nThere are some important people here. Goo Dae-seong was able to be sure that they had come to the right place.\n“I’m entering! I’ll do the second throw——”\nThat was the moment. Inside a dark building dozens of windows are thrown through windows and walls.\nLord Raihar shouted.\nBaltan Burning Sword Knights! Balgum!!\nIn response to the flying throw the riders of the god of war pour out a wall of fire.\nCharge!\nThe Knights of the Burning Sword who blocked the first attack rushed with Goo Dae-seong at the head.\nDaeseongbeop < Spear of the Earth >\nThe land they ran on was on their side and under the great protection of the Holy Grail Knight they broke through a barrage of javelins and entered the building.\nKreu...!\nAnd there they met an orc champion riding a huge wild boar.\nAnnoying guys. Not even one of them has been killed.\nSkira the champion of Skunic the orc hunting god. He and the Orc Riders riding wild boars confront the Holy Grail Knights.\nOrc Champion...\nI've also heard of Goo Dae-sung. He said he encountered orc champions on the other side of helping Zereah's relics.\nThe fact that the strongman of the Holy Grail Knight class is right in front of you means that this conflict may not end as a simple conflict.\n‘Can I win? It's not that I don't believe in the ability of the Burning Sword Knights but...'\nThe problem is yourself. Considering that they are of the same level as Holy Grail Knights it is clear that my skills are below average among Holy Grail Knights.\nHe had undergone Karina's rigorous anti-personnel combat training for the past half year but he had never defeated her before.\nLord Raihar. I will take over as the Orc Champion. In the meantime those Black Orcs—\nIt was then. Goong! and the feeling of being squeezed by the air.\nThis sensation which makes even the Holy Grail Knight chill is similar to Leon Murka and Vulcanus.\nThe Holy Grail Knights and the Order of Knights. No wonder the troublesome writers gathered.\nThe identity of the chill was a silver-haired man exuding ferocious spirit like a beast.\nAlthough he looks like a neat young man his energy is ferocious and savage.\n“Could it be that he was still alive?!”\nLord Raihar who had been burning his fighting spirit until just now was astonished.\nAre you... someone who knows?\nRigardo the great warrior of the beast gods... When Sir Vulcanus was the monster of the evil gods he was the second-in-command of the barbarians.\nI thought he would have died long ago in the war against the devil...\nThe Burning Sword Knights are veteran knights of the same era as Leon. Each of them looked nervous as if they knew Rigardo but Rigardo on the contrary was rather pleased.\nOh~ The Burning Sword Knights. Aren't they the ones who slaughtered tens of thousands of our brothers?\nThere was no anger or hatred on Rigardo's expression. Rather it seems that the cool and easy-going thing reminds me of old memories.\nIt was fun then. How is Vulcanus doing?\n·······.\nThe Knights of the Burning Sword tried hard to calm the horse down from the tyrannical spirit exuding from the man but it was not easy.\nA beast is the way to recognize a beast. The horses fluttered as if they knew with their sixth sense the danger of the beast.\nBack off Skira.\nwhat?\nHowever the words that came out of Rigardo's mouth were unexpected.\nThe purpose has been achieved. There is no need to clash.\nDon't be ridiculous. Wiping them out of here will be what the Great Khan wants.\nDo you really think so?\n·······.\nAt those words Skira was silent. The Great Khan does not yet want an all-out war with Lionheart.\nIt was because he thought it would be much more efficient and effective to mobilize the orcs and use that plan.\nIt's not impossible to wipe them out here and it's true that if the Holy Grail Knights and Knights are annihilated it could be a big blow-\nYou just saw the flames of Vulcanus in the sky. If it's him he can come here as soon as he gets a call. Even if he crosses the continent 10 minutes is enough for him.\nCan you wipe out one Grail Knight and the Grail Knights in those 10 minutes?\nIf you go out you'll be able to deal with that monster right?\nBecause I'm the last remaining beast god's warrior I have to roll my body a little more.\nAt Rigardo's refusal Skyra snorted and turned the nose.\nYou're lucky tin cans.\nWhen Skyra steps down the Black Orc Riders join in as well. Watching them retreat Koo Dae-seong and the Holy Grail Knights were unable to pursue.\nRigardo the great warrior of the Beast Gods. because of that one man.\n······??\nRigardo laughs and disappears along with the orcs.\nWhoa...\nIt was dangerous.\nIt was a crisis situation that even the warlike Holy Grail Knights could comment on.\nBut I think it's too late. They've destroyed everything we're looking for.\nIt has been a long time since all servers and computers in the laboratory were destroyed. Yapi will come and find out the data but since it is physically destroyed it will be difficult to get the right one.\nSir Koo Dae-seong! Sir Raihar! Look here!\nA knight urges as if he has discovered something. Goo Dae-seong who visited them found an unexpected bonanza.\nThis?\nThe only intact data room among the thoroughly destroyed research institutes. It was rather unnatural that it was preserved.\nAs if hoping to be found.\nLet's check before Lord Yapi comes!\nGoo Dae-seong hurriedly looked at the data and soon became distorted with astonishment.\nThis crazy...\nRagnarok Plan.\nIt was at this moment that the true nature of this plan was revealed.\n* * * *\nTaiwan entered a period of great chaos after the incident in which Leon completely replaced Taiwan's leadership.\nIt was revealed that the upper echelons including the Führer bureaucrats and soldiers were all servants of the devil.\nIn the middle of the capital the great demons called in an army of demons and the Taiwanese army stepped forward to support them.\nCitizens were enraged and they went so far as to burn the demon follower officials to death.\n- Although a new Führer was elected to be honest I feel uneasy.\n-I picked him because I had no one to stand up for not because I liked him.\n-Why is there not a single pantheon among our politicians?\n-Originally dirty people will be punished if they say that they believe in the pantheon.\nAt a time when the distrust of the social leadership reached its peak and the collapsed social system and the military were not properly restored a disaster occurred on the mainland across the sea.\n[Formation of the Continental Confederation of Orcs. Will the scattered continents unite again!]\nOrcs took over most of the Chinese continent in the blink of an eye. This caused great anxiety among the citizens.\n- What is it those guys? Isn't that what you're attacking?\n- The spirit of the Orcs is unusual. Among the politicians who work there there is a writer who shouts ‘one China'.\nSince its founding Taiwan has lived under the threat of the mainland.\nAlthough the cataclysm that hit the world unexpectedly saved them the mainland has been crying out for Taiwan's restoration even after the country was torn apart.\nUp until now he was busy with his own life and didn't have the energy to participate in the event but now it was different.\nTaiwan is currently weak and a powerful military power has been born on the mainland in less than a day.\n- What is the Führer doing! Take action quickly!\nAt the request of the citizens President Jinrong in his first year was confused.\nDamn it! What are you saying to me!\nTaiwan where many devil followers have been expelled has yet to restore power.\nIf you want to replenish your power right away you have to bring in outside manpower but aren't the Orcs the representative mercenary group?\nThere was no point in bringing in orcs who were being threatened by the orcs. There were two countries that the new Taiwanese government could grab even by the crotch of pants.\nWhen will the Korea-Japan trilateral meeting come?\nAfter a meeting internally...\nI need it right now! Orcs have already eaten half the continent!\nPresident Jin Rong was also on the verge of stress-induced hair loss over the past month.\nIt has only been a decade since Taiwan has been free from threats from the mainland. It was only when the mainland China which was so huge was torn into 53 pieces that Taiwan also had a national power that surpassed that of the divided mainland China.\nHowever in the situation where most of the leaders were demon followers and the power vacuum was swept away by the Lionheart's knights a warlike superpower emerged in front of their noses?\nNot only President Jinrong but the entire Taiwanese people are bound to be engulfed in anxiety.\nYour Excellency the President. Park Yong-shin Princess Hanbit has visited.\n“After that ask them to come in.”\nIn the midst of this it was a South Korean pseudo-religious leader who had long been a headache in Taiwan who requested a visit.\nHowever it is an old saying that Hanbitgung was a pseudo-religion. After receiving the baptism of the Lion Heart King aren't they the ones who claim to be faithful servants of the pantheon more than anyone else?\nIt's an honor to meet you Mr. Führer.\nPresident Jinlong greeted the cult leader with an awkward smile.\n“Prince Park Yong-shin.”\nPresident Jinlong hoped that he could borrow the power of the pantheon from this meeting.\nNo matter what anyone says a superman among superhumans who easily surpasses an S-class hunter. Isn't it the place where the Lion Heart King who defeated even the Holy Grail Knights and the demon lord is located?\nThe Führer doesn't know much about hunters but I don't think transcendentalists who cut the sea with a knife and shoot down all the satellites in the universe are common.\nIn this way an unexpected proposal was handed over to President Jin Lung who was trying to get results from Park Yong-shin somehow.\n“The Lionheart Federation?”\nThe solution he brought was unexpected.\nPark Yong-shin smiled and promised the Taiwanese president who was bewildered as if he had heard something unexpected.\nYour Majesty as the earthly representative of the gods has promised to protect your country with that honor. As proof of that—\nThat was the moment. The sky above Taiwan turns red in an instant.\nNormally people would be afraid of how ominous and terrifying it was but now people around the world know.\nThat red light is the moment when the strongest Holy Grail Knight descends.\n“GRANARARARA——!!”\nThe voice of a giant resounding. The windows of the President's office were shaken but the face of President Jinlong was bright.\nThe Holy Grail Knight of War and Flame Lord Vulcanus will protect this land.\nalmost simultaneously.\nThe messengers of the Pantheon visited 29 countries on the Chinese continent.\nFor the formation of an anti-Orc Federation alliance based on the security guarantee by Leon Dragonia Lionheart.\nOrc or Lionheart?\nThe choice of either option is something called an option.",

How can you maintain a policy with such persistence?\nhaha······.\nLeon who confirmed the results of their training and their faith in God patted Chairman Takeda and the direct hunters on the shoulders. All of them were knights who were ordained knights in the Pantheon.\nThe next ones to come are none other than the president of a unified Korea Andong-gil and Oh Kang-hyeok the head of the Korean Hunter Association. Behind them were members of the new swords guild Cheon Jin-soo and Kim Jin-soo the chiefs of the association.\nPresident Ahn. Lionheart's friend. Thank you for making this place shine.\nThe one that should come of course.\nKorea like Japan and Taiwan was the largest supporter country that decided to join the Lionheart Federation. In particular as the main power of the Lionheart Federation is East Asia Korea is quite active.\n‘If it's a war that has no choice but to happen anyway.'\nWhen President Andong-gil saw the movement of the pantheon he felt intuition that he could not coexist with the Orc Continental Federation.\nAn ordinary politician would have to weigh the conflict between the two forces and think about which side to take but Korea can't do that.\nRight now the source of the Mansinjeon power is inside Korea and Korea which is taking its place while experiencing the burden of unification is dependent on the Mansinjeon for everything social political and economical.\nIt meant that the pantheon was an enemy that could not coexist that is Korea was also an enemy that could not coexist.\nAnyway that's quite a lot. Isn't this also thanks to His Majesty?\nPresident Ahn thought it must be true when he saw that more continental Chinese countries and even Southeast Asian countries participated than expected.\nSoutheast Asia also actively accepted Orcs much like the Chinese continent so they are worried about an Orc coup.\nyour majesty.\nBeatrice quietly approached Leon. Wearing a veil over her dark dress as usual she captivated those around her with her inconceivable beauty.\nBice. What's going on?\n“They say he came from America.”\nHmm.\nLeon guessed the identity and soon headed to the place where the American delegation was located.\nIt was an unconventional visit from President Hobson of the United States of America but the greetings with him ended quickly and he soon faced the person who was waiting in the secret room.\nlong time no see.\nLeon approached the platinum-haired beauty who was waiting for him and kissed the back of her hand.\nIt's been a while. Lion Heart King.\nGoddess of Fate Meriel. She is a goddess from the other world that the United States of America has been protecting for decades.\n“I assumed you would visit...”\nThe U.S. government expressed disapproval of my coming here. They talked about security issues but that's an excuse.\nThe US government was predicting the possibility that the goddess they had secured would pass over to the pantheon. Although it was unpleasant for Leon just by imagining it.\nHow dare the lowly ones dare to argue about the goings of the gods. Their faith is lacking.\nWhoops you're the only one who still treats me like a god.\nIt's just setting the example we should take.\nInfinite respect for God. Indeed it was a believer who deserved to be loved by the gods.\nMeriel brought up the story with renewed envy of the pantheon.\n“King Leon do you intend to fight Murka Balak?”\nof course.\nAs you know except for Asia the Western world tries to avoid confrontation with the Great Khan as much as possible. Their interests are too much at stake.\nThe principle that it is not possible to select and exclude only orcs from multi-racial human rights.\nThere are already overflowing orc aliens and orc warriors who are very useful in attacking the gate.\nEven after seeing the collapse of the Chinese continent in a coup d'état the Western world easily guessed peace. They say that they are successful because they are originally such poor countries and they are different.\nIt's not funny. They misunderstand the habits of the orcs or at least the ambitions of the Great Khan.\nThere have been three beings that I can't predict the fate of.\nOne is demon lords. This is because their power already transcends the godhead.\nThe second is King Leon. You are a singularity in history. An existence with enough power to become a god.\n······A half body.\nLeon expressed disapproval as if he hadn't thought of any more but Meriel continued.\nAnd that Orc Great Khan. The existence of a gigantic ego that I didn't even allow me to peep into my fate. The ‘singularity' that even the ferocious Orc gods cherish.\nMeriel was convinced that he was on the same level as Leon.\nThere is no need to predict fate. The fate of this planet will change with the victory or defeat of King Leon and Great Khan Murka.\nI think so too.\nSo... I persuaded the United States.\nLeon was taken aback by those words. Until now the United States of America had been the most reluctant to respond to the Orc Continental Confederation.\n[I understand your Majesty's intentions and concerns but there are too many orcs in America.]\n[You can kill them all or even isolate them by human rights groups...]\n[The United States of America is different from the developing countries of the Chinese continent. Our strength is solid and the Orcs are only a minority opinion.]\nIt was the United States that refused to join Leon's anti-Orc federation citing such domestic politics.\nConvinced the United States?\nHow far can you go?\n“When Your Majesty starts a war will volunteer soldiers who can speak English come out to support?\nIt won't be enough to fill in the numbers.\nStopping is a big help. The United States is a traditionally Christian country but its power has weakened since the cataclysm and pantheonism has crept in and spread.\nIf the church expands according to the current trend it is predicted that the pantheon will outnumber the Christians in 20 years.\nAlready in the United States of America there were numerous knights appointed by Leon and man-at-arms who returned home after receiving training.\nThe fact that their faith is growing day by day is confirmed by the gods of the pantheon.\nIt was a big help but how did you convince me?\nI gave you a choice. Human rule or Orc rule. I showed the president the fate.\n“Yes? But the goddess decides the fate of me and that orc——”\n[Leon the power I feel from the goddess of fate is significantly less than before.]\nAriana's voice made Leon really feel the holy power he felt in her. Her goddess who was confined to her vessel called her body and continued her life did her group to such an extent that she even broke her own vessel.\nHow can the goddess's jade body...\n“If King Leon doesn’t win his body is meaningless.”\nMeriel's smile made Leon hold her hand and make up his mind.\nI will definitely bring victory.\nToday the formed Lionheart Federation will declare war towards the Orc Continental Federation.\n* * * *\nover Pyongyang. In this place where flying is prohibited except for unmanned drones or dragons helicopters flew busily on rare occasions. It was a helicopter with reporters.\n[This is over Pyongyang. The Lionheart Federation ratification ceremony is about to begin now!]\nReporters from all over the world tried to capture this historic moment on camera.\nBlack Dragon the mayor of Pyongyang and the dragons who follow him.\nElves and Treemen gathered here and there from the branches of the huge world tree.\nOver 2000 knights and now over 30000 Man-at-Arms. In addition the number of knights who received the title of article from all over the world is not easy.\nNewsrooms from around the world also helped one by one while watching the relay video of the scene where the military parade unfolded.\n[This is a great army. The 33 countries that are members of the Lionheart Federation including Korea Japan Taiwan Heilongong Chengdu Guiyang Lanzhou Shenyang and Harbin have gathered.]\n[In other words by ratifying this Lionheart Federation Charter a huge united state comparable to the European Union the United States of America and the Orc Continental Confederation is created.]\n[Excluding Korea and Japan most of the new countries are developing countries. But in the end the core of national power is the pantheon.]\n[The Miracle of a Real God. And there are Holy Grail Knights who represent those gods. These alone exceed the strength of the great powers.]\n[Aside from that it’s worth recalling that the UK and the US are making quite positive gestures──]\nIt was then. Countless Kikkiruk tribes began to land on the Taedonggang River which divides Pyongyang Special Self-Governing City.\nIt was an amphibious landing performance by Kikkiruk warriors who moved from Nampo along the Yellow Sea to the Daedonggang River.\n[I can't leave out the Krashatria. According to the evaluation of the United States Navy it is said that they cannot be defeated at sea.]\n[And the being that brought them together is His Majesty Leon Dragonia Lionheart. In other words the leader of this federation is the Lion Heart King.]\n[This is a fairly old topic. Can Earth's politics be entrusted to beings from another world?]\n[However over the past year His Majesty Leon has responded gracefully with common sense different from ours. There is no need to talk about the infiltration cases of devil followers triggered by the UN Human Rights Commission inspection.]\n[It is often pointed out that the method of the pantheon is too inhumane... but it is also true that citizens have strong opinions about whether the human rights of the devil or his followers should be respected.]\nLeon is clearly far from the mainstream political ideology of the earth.\nHe hated democracy and believed in the divine right of kings according to which his rights were chosen by the gods not by a vote of the people.\nBut he also had other principles.\n[This is an unusual medieval royalty in that they respect the laws of other countries. Because he has the power to trample foreign laws.]\n[However considering the purpose of the establishment of this federation the standard is clear.]\n[Half Orc Federation. In other words the Lionheart Federation is likely to face off against the Orc Continental Federation. His Majesty Leon is a notorious ‘Orc racist'. He even has the trait of being the most orc slayer among primates.]\n[It was a warning that there was no respect for demons and orcs.]\nThey are hostile because they are orcs. Everyone knew that Leon was a staunch orc hater. And the purpose of the founding of this federation.\nArticle 1 of the Lionheart Charter. All power comes from the gods. The Lion Heart King represents the gods. Therefore he stands above all laws.\n[As expected... I have a lot to say about that charter.]\n[The system of leaving everything to individual morality has always failed on Earth. But there are many saying that this time will be different.]\n[All absolute power must corrupt... Is it because there are beings who can break the law?]\n[The Pantheon. That is the gods.]\nA living power given by a real God. But at any time that power can be taken back by the gods.\nExcept for Katabuta who discusses the morality of the gods it was the birth of a very attractive leader for mankind who had dreamed of being an ‘iron man' since time immemorial.\nI swear to lead the world for good with the divine power bestowed by the gods.\n[But does it make sense? The gods of the pantheon have complete trust in the Lion Heart King.]\nI Leon Dragonia Lionheart also as a knight will be the shield that protects all the people of the Federation and the spear that destroys their enemies.\n[He is a superman who has defeated demon lords and has no opponent. We all witnessed the great slaughter the heavenly world that defeated the lord of chaos.]\n“Follow me.”\n[Who can equal the Lion Heart King? Federal ratifying countries just have to believe.]\nThen you will win.\n[This is the birth of undoubted absolute power.]\n─────────!!!!\nIt was the moment when the ceremony of ratification was declared.\nin the middle of Pyongyang. Numerous knights and soldiers lined up to help and the ‘Gate' opened where the Holy Grail Knights were waiting.\nWhat what?\n“A gate at this timing?!”\nWhile everyone was perplexed Leon looked through the gate. He sensed the savage beast energy there.\n-Jerbuck! that buck!\njust one step. Even if I only took one step the air is oppressed.\nIn this world in a world where superhumans such as Leon Dragonia and Lionheart exist only one being can crush the space he purifies.\nMuh Murka?!\nGreat Khan Murkhada!\nOrc Great Khan Murka Balak.\nHe came to the middle of enemy lines.",

Lion Heart King.\n“Did you come here to wreak havoc on other people’s banquets like beasts?”\n“If you try to put a knife to my throat at that banquet it must not end in defeat.”\nAt Murka's gaze the faces of the surrounding soldiers turned whiter.\nRealizing that if this orc swung that mace right away they would be the first ones to die.\nIf I who represent the will of the gods directly hand down the death sentence I will not accept it as an honor.\nUnlike you tin cans orcs only decide through an honorable struggle.\nHonor? Honor? You beasts?\nLeon's emotions boiled violently as if he had heard something he couldn't possibly hear. The lion heart king's wrath was immediately reacted by the space-\nDah the ground shakes!\nCrazy! Is this real?!\nUltima of the sky shook the world with lightning and Demera of the earth made the whole crust boil.\n“Haven't you beasts realized that it was their duty to die a miserable death while crawling like maggots?”\nIn front of the wrath of the comrade Gyeongcheon the Orc Great Khan twisted his lips as he radiated fierce speculation.\nI'm not interested in your dori.\nAt that moment the holy swords extended towards Murka.\nAll of a sudden the Holy Grail Knights surrounding Murka aimed their holy swords at Murka.\nVulcanus Karina Koo Dae-seong... and even Yapi's Marquis-level decisive battle weapon and Magician Queen Beatrice who were waiting at the parade.\nThey said they took care of our knights. Let's fight with me too!\nMurka showed a corresponding fighting spirit to Vulcan's blazing gaze but gave a regretful look.\nYou're the one the idiot who was defeated by the Lion Heart King thirteen times. Didn't he eat a million warriors?\nGRARARA──! I sent you to the side of the gods with my mysterious mercenary skills!\nMurka twisted the corner of her mouth at Vulcanus's enthusiastic response.\n“It would have been different for me.”\nWhat do you know!\nReporters and citizens around Vulcan's ferocious momentum were swept away by anxiety.\n‘Am I really going to fight?'\n‘They haven't even evacuated yet!'\nMoreover the declaration of war against the Orc Federation by the Lionheart Federation has not yet begun. A hasty attack will lead to criticism from the international community-\nThe beast disturbed the king's eyes. At least he must die miserably to pay for his crime.\n‘Damn Lionheart you're full of thoughts to fight!'\n‘If those monsters fight the whole city will fly!'\nBut what is certain is that even Murka who stepped into the demonic cave teeming with these Holy Grail Knights-\nHehehehe... What is it is it okay to enjoy it a little?\nThat there is no way to control the situation.\nThen get out of here!\nIn the end it was Lionheart's side that made the preemptive strike.\nVulcanus wielded the holy sword without holding back. That giant sword is a sword of great strength that cut the demon archduke with a single blade. it-\n- Tup!\nMurka simply blocked it. He grabbed Vulcan's holy sword with his arm wrapped in a gauntlet.\nFor grabbing the holy sword of a war knight! You stupid beast!\nAt that moment the enormous flame pouring from Vulcanus' holy sword enveloped Murka.\nGRARARA──! With this this Vulcanus has taken over the field! The day to evolve into the King of the Holy Grail is not far off!\n[You idiot! Stay alert! He's fine!]\nhmm?!\nArms outstretched from the flames. It grabbed Vulcanus by the scruff of the neck.\nBig?!\nSometimes with a lukewarm fire.\nVulcanus has no choice but to be embarrassed when he is caught in the grip of a savage. However the Holy Grail Knights attacked from all sides almost at the same time.\nIf you only care about me you'll get a serious nose injury.\n“·······?!”\nA huge power that instantly freezes their chills. The Holy Grail Knights inadvertently looked up into the sky.\nThat's...!\nA gigantic orc... no something in the shape of an orc was striking down the soles of its feet hundreds of meters in diameter.\n“The big feet of the god of war Helcan!”\nA power used by the champion of Helcan which he witnessed in many wars against the Orcs. Karina tried to back down but there were too many knights and soldiers around her that she couldn't avoid.\nI'll stop you!\nGoo Dae-seong immediately raised the power of the earth. This is a sanctuary where the roots and branches of the World Tree extend. As long as he has the blessing of Goddess Demera Goo Dae-seong's collective defense is the strongest among the Holy Grail Knights.\nDaeseongbeop < Earth Shield >.\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say that it was almost instant. The roots of the World Tree which absorbed plenty of Gu Dae-seong's holy power formed a dome-shaped shield in an instant.\n-Kooung!\nGoo Dae-seong defends against the blow of the orc who has strengthened himself in a spiritual body. Karina smiled and praised.\nYou've definitely grown as much as the Seongbeop.\nThis isn't the time for this! He's not alone!\nKarina knows that too. Even though he used this much divine law Murka did not reveal any special divine power.\nIn other words Helcan's big foot was used by another orc champion.\n[Koo Dae-sung my sweetheart! The World Tree is under attack!]\nAt the voice of the gods the Grail Knights' eyes turned to the World Tree.\nThe world tree caught fire.\nIt's still partly on fire but the Orcs were rampaging and continuing to arson and destroy it.\nI watched that horrifying scene\nThe Orcs have invaded Pyongyang!\ncrazy\nNo matter how hostile forces they invaded the middle of the ratification ceremony visited and watched by distinguished guests from all over the world?\nde facto declaration of war. No the war has already begun.\nAll knights and soldiers stop the Orcs. Not even one of them is missing.\nIn the meantime everyone's eyes were focused on him at Leon's command.\nYour Majesty are you alone?\nThe World Tree is where the goddess Irmin dwells. You can't dirty that place with the dirty feet of beasts.\nLeon didn't order twice. He drew the holy sword and confronted Murka alone.\nKuh... I see!\nChit...! I haven't returned it yet but that's all I can say!\nThere must be other orc champions as well as taking such an offensive strategy. The Holy Grail Knights hurriedly ran out in the role of firefighters against the terror of the Orcs.\nThe remaining knights and soldiers too. Stand back protecting citizens and visitors.\nIt was instinctively understood. That they are of no help in the fight between the two.\nThere have been many guys who claim to be the captain of the Orcs but this is the first time I've seen such a cunning guy.\n“Lion Heart King. Your reputation is heard even in the lands I conquered.\nThe holy sword and mace shine. Even at first glance the legendary warriors who were condensed with phenomenal holy power were shaking as if they were as excited as their masters.\nBut I never thought I'd give the cause of the purge first. You overestimated my power.\nThe guy who would have declared war today would have seen ‘the plan' for some reason?\nRagnarok Plan.\nThe recent riots of the Orcs and this ‘final plan' taking place on the continent they dominated were enough to make Leon and the world of course the Orc Continental Federation an enemy.\nAnd since the plan was exposed the Orc Great Khan felt that a war with the Lionheart Federation was inevitable and chose a bold surprise attack.\nYes I'll admit that I'm definitely not an ordinary orc. If I'm going to fight anyway even if I make the world my enemy I will boldly take action! Indeed I'm one of those ignorant people.\nDespite being attacked unexpectedly Leon overflowed with boiling blood rather than displeasure. Because he no longer needs to be swayed by the customs and cause of the earth.\nBut I also prepared a plan of destruction for you guys.\n-Operation of the Duke-class all-weather last-armed platform. Initiate destruction protocol for all decisive battle weapons.\nhmm···?\nAt that moment there was movement on land at sea and in space.\n-Start controlling the Marquis-class main self-destruct drone.

In connection with Han Hari the goddess of the sea the formation of a 13km-class wave was completed.\n- Cosmic battle weapons satellite armed platform Mobius-class charged particle cannons by major city bombardment start.\nLeon was also preparing. A destroyer that will be activated at the same time as the war with the Orc Continental Federation begins.\nIndiscriminate attack by weapons of mass destruction that guaranteed the safety of innocent citizens according to the provincial law. It started pouring towards the Orc Continental Federation.\nAttacks full of thoughts to annihilate each other. I don't even think about the future negotiations to end the war.\nWorld leaders and citizens are astonished at this near-ignorance hatred.\nWhy are they so anxious not to kill each other?\nKeukkeukkeukkeukkeukkeuk!\nHahahaha...!\nAmidst everyone's doubts the Lion Heart King and the Great Khan. The giants of the two eras felt a strange affinity even though they met for the first time today.\nBlind hatred towards each other. They only assume the worst and try to kill each other.\nYes this is the history of Lionheart and Orcs.\nThe history of hatred that has killed each other for thousands or tens of thousands of years overwhelms the human rights of the world or anything like that.\nOnly each other's destruction.\nIgnoring even the minimum line the destroyer is activated.\nIt's funny. I feel such clear hostility but these earthlings talk about this guy that guy appeasement book human rights.\nYes these clumsy and fragile children do not know. They are pacifists who have fought among themselves at best.\nthis is inertia\nWhen a human and an orc collide of course there must be sword fighting.\nWhat are the impressions of the two demigods who watched the world suppressed by things such as civilization and peace?\n“dog sound!!”\npick up the holy sword\nThe largest orc slaughterer among primates.\nDown beast!

      "content": "Lionheart vs Orc (1)\n[Ten days have already passed since the battle in Pyongyang ended.]\n[The day the Lionheart Federation ratification ceremony was declared. Half of the World Tree was burned due to a massive raid by the great Khan Murka Balak of the Orc Continental Federation—-]\n[The situation in the coastal cities of mainland China is serious. Thirteen cities were submerged in seawater and numerous victims occurred——]\nFour days after the Lionheart Federation's ratification ceremony Murka Ballack's massive raid by the Orc Continental Federation and the Lionheart Federation's weapons of mass destruction are activated.\nThe clash between the Orc Champions and the Holy Grail Knights literally devastated Pyongyang which had been half-destroyed by the battle with demons.\nPyongyang which achieved remarkable development for half a year according to Yapi's planned city reconstruction plan could not withstand the confrontation of superhumans representing the power of God.\nWhoa~ It just got smashed smashed.\nReporter Park of the state broadcaster who came to cover the situation in Pyongyang clucked his tongue at the devastating sight of Pyongyang being destroyed here and there.\nExcluding the VIPs who were invited at the time the lowest cuts for ordinary citizens were elves and tree men so if there were ordinary citizens it would have been a catastrophe.\n“But even with that fire the World Tree is relatively intact.”\nIt is said that the birth of life which was the original maximum function has stopped. Now they are focusing on recovery.\nPyongyang Special City which can be said to be the headquarters of the Lionheart Federation was damaged by the World Tree being burned and stopped functioning and various parts of the city were destroyed.\nOf course it could be said that it was a shame to suffer such damage on the day of the ratification of the federation but no one thought it was a one-sided defeat of Lionheart.\nHow's the situation on the continent?\nIt's disastrous. They died in hundreds of thousands.\nAs soon as Murka's massive assault began Leon activated the destruction protocol he had prepared.\nHigh-performance self-destruct drones launched from the land unmanned drone base controlled by the Marquis class a decisive land battle weapon crossed the Yellow Sea and hit various parts of the continent.\nThe Dominator-class a decisive naval weapon exploded dozens of nuclear torpedoes causing huge waves on the continental shelf.\nAlthough it is now in stealth mode it is evaluated that the ground bombardment of the charged particle cannon by the space integrated armament platform exceeded the conventional power by a hundred times.\nIt was an attack that wouldn't be strange even if tens of thousands of people died. Spelling is really... convenient.\nIt's amazing that even with these great destruction devices activated few other than the orcs died.\nEven with the help of high-technology the subject of the attack was a conceptual attack that clearly distinguished Pia such as Beatrice's death spell Han Hari's wave spell and Yapi's iron spell.\nThey launched an attack designed to kill only Orcs not humans and the Orcs of the Continental Orcs were swept away by the mighty god's wrath.\nThe terrible destruction swept through but the Orc Continental Federation was not benevolent. This is because the Lionheart Federation immediately announced the plan the Orc Continental Federation was plotting.\nThe Ragnarok Plan. If that's true... This isn't a war between Orcs and Lionhearts. It's a war between humans and Orcs.\nRagnarok Plan.\nThe beginning was a plan that the demons who had been encroaching on this land for a long time started simultaneously with the appearance of the pantheon.\nOpen a special gate to summon foreign gods from the ‘alien world' to this land.\nA head-to-head confrontation between foreign gods and pantheon gods. Truly a war of the gods.\nNo one could have imagined what catastrophe it would lead to.\nThere was a reason why the Orcs overreacted. Thanks to that they are beating all over the world.\nOn the third day of the war the US Pacific Fleet was bombarding major cities and Indian troops were on land.\nThe European Union is providing arms support to the Lionheart Federation but it has not yet passed the National Assembly so it is sluggish.\n‘But thanks to that the huge number of Orcs has been balanced.'\nThe number of Orcs exceeded two million on the continent alone.\nCompared to the entire human race the number of orc warriors who are treated as a double warrior class that is at least a B-class hunter is close to 700000.\nIn addition considering the continental hunters and troops absorbed by the Orc Continental Federation the combat manpower alone was millions of units.\nNo matter how many thousands of knights and tens of thousands of men-at-arms are mobilized in the Lionheart Federation this numerical balance is still too heavy.\nFor some reason the U.S. which would be sluggish is actively taking an offensive in support and South Korea and Japan naturally participated in the war so the balance of this number was maintained in a precarious manner.\nBut in the end the strongest forces on both sides are Lion Heart King and Great Khan. Even if only one of those demigods participates in the battle this balance collapses in an instant.\nIt was something everyone who watched the Battle of Pyongyang could relate to.\nHalf-destroyed Pyongyang.\nHalf of it was just the aftermath of two monsters clashing.\n* * * *\nten days before the war.\nThe world is truly in chaos.\nIt's only been half a year since the war with demons ended. I thought I had barely gotten used to the riots of demons hiding in all directions but a great war broke out in which ‘great nations' collided with ‘great nations'.\nThe 33 countries under the Lionheart Federation the Korea-US-Japan triangular alliance and the Orc Continental Federation which has swallowed up half of the continent are clashing.\nOrc Circles raiding the National Guard in the United States or Orc coups in Eastern Europe and Russia are laughable.\nThe war against the lord of chaos Rakshaar was not as large as this and it is the first time since the Gulf War that mankind which has relied on a small number of superhuman powers has caused such a large-scale military conflict since the opening of the Hunter era.\n- Crazy part of Moscow is occupied by orcs! Russian Guards are entering the mosque now!\n- You're saying that the police level can't solve the problem right?\n- Hunters are also being swept away of course!\nThe problem is that this war goes far against conventional wisdom.\nOriginally the war of mankind was a face-to-face confrontation.\nThe army gathered from the land advances while occupying the land and collides with the enemy army.\nAlthough the connection between land sea and air has been added to modernization and network warfare the basic principle of war remains the same.\nBut this war was different.\n- Orcs have appeared in Pearl Harbor! The Pacific Fleet home port is being destroyed!\n-what? There aren't that many orcs in Hawaii!\n-I opened the gate and came in!\n-The Knights of the Burning Sword have arrived in Beijing! I'm burning everything I can!\n-Here is Wuhan but lightning is about to fall! No matter how you think about it it's not natural!\n-God of thunder Is there more than Ultima's lightning!\ngate technology.\nThis great magic of leaping through space was acquired by the magician Queen Beatrice and just as Murka rode over on the day of the ratification of the federation they were fighting guerrilla warfare across each other's realms.\n-I will open Gate 3 now. The 1st Knights and auxiliary man-at-arms return within 30 minutes after a quick fire projectile.\n-I will open the gate to Tokyo. After killing as many Hunters as possible there retreat sequentially.\nThe Magician Queen and the Orc Chief.\nThe masters of the two eras are able to use the gate magic that even demons can handle unless they are only the great demons of wisdom.\nBecause of the existence of these two the war goes beyond face-to-face confrontation and becomes super-dimensional and super-dimensional. In other words an n-dimensional confrontation is established.\n-Gate leap ends. The magic power of the enemy Grand Shaman is also gradually reaching its limit.\n- Take a break at this point. It's called the Magician Queen it's an amazing amount of magical power. cluck cluck ·······.\nThe reason why this war does not flow into endless mud is that there is only one genius in each camp who can use gate magic.\nIn order to retrieve the troops who went to the gate they had to spend all their energy to keep the gate open.\nWhoa...\nYou've worked hard Bice.\nLeon looked at Biche who was resting in the seat next to him grasping the tactical map.\nHow is it? Can you figure out his location?\nWhile performing the gate magic Biche traced back to the gate the orcs were opening. If the backtracking of the gate was possible that would be the home of the Orcs.\nIt is said that this war can be ended at once.\nNo. His anti-tracking magic is also at an incredible level. I've never seen a magician like this before.\nBeatrice stuck out her tongue saying that even the Corrupted Grand Duke Quay wasn't like this.\nIn the past there was a famous shaman among the orcs. He was the chieftain who united the 13 orc tribes.\nArchmage Krann.\nLeon recalled an old memory.\nBecause it was a large tribe of orcs that emerged from the northern part of the empire I couldn't go to kill them but it seems that the orc shaman who is dealing with the bische is him.\nWhat about the orc shaman named Mag'har Gokrok's champion?\nBeatrice mentioned the Orc Champion Leon encountered during the quest for the Zereah Hallows but Leon replied with a smile instead.\nVice your strength is more than that of a moderate Grail Knight. Your talent for sorcery is unmatched even by the impudent Elector Counts of the Empire. Even though that Mag'har is the champion of Gokrok the evil Orc shaman god really cares about him Krann. .\nJust as Murka Balak is favored by the three great orcs.\nBy the way Your Majesty. Is your wound still not healed?\nBeatrice approached Leon and stared anxiously at the bloody bandage.\nTen days ago in a bloody battle in Pyongyang Leon and Murka hurt each other and retreated. Thanks to this Leon had to take a break commanding the battlefield here in Pyongyang.\n“He also pierced his shoulder with a holy sword so it will take time to recover. Until then we have to leave it to his subordinates.”\nLeon looked at the map.\nThe Orc Continental Confederation's reckless surprise attack and the reality of the Ragnarok Plan have been revealed so they are being attacked from all sides.\nThere are several battlegrounds but in the end it's just a wasteful local battle. The real thing is in an unexpected place.\nI can only hope that Lord Vulcanus will do well.\nLeon's eyes were on the huge continental map.\n* * * *\nTen days and one day after the outbreak of war.\nThe world's attention is focused on one area even in the super-dimensional battle of gate leaping and the unprecedented clash of large forces.\nA huge wall built by the Chinese continent to prevent the invasion of nomadic tribes. Among them the easternmost point and the starting point.\nShanhaiguan.\nFor a long time the huge fortress that blocked the nomadic peoples who threatened the settled people from the entrance was again blocking the invasion of foreign enemies.\n-Clucking!\nAll-out fire of siege guns!\nThe pre-modern infantry advances with the support of the Kikkiruk armored artillery and future-oriented robot weapons.\nAs soon as the war began the Lionheart Federation Army War Knight Vulcanus which rushed through the Gaema Plateau was attacking this ancient castle with a large army of over 50000.\nDestroy it!\nThe flames of Vulcanus swirl and turn into a skull-shaped ball of fire.\nThe fireball advancing as if it would devour everything in front of it was the power of Petos the god of war.\nNo matter how much the Orcs' architecture was reinforced and strengthened by witchcraft the firepower that an old fortress that had only been preserved for a long time could not withstand.\n-Quaaaa!\nA wrecked seacoast. The cultural heritage of China's long history has disappeared in an instant like this.\nTry to trample!\nThe troops advancing led by Vulcanus and the Knights of the Burning Sword. As the elite knights and hunters stood in the forefront the orcs waiting behind the collapsed walls swung their axes to block them.\nlack!\nVulcanus ran into the leading orc with his bare body. The strong body of the orc explodes as it is.\nThe impact of a mounted horse is the pride of a knight but if you are a superman the size of Vulcanus it is more powerful to just run into it with your bare body.\nBut even with such powerful charging the flesh of the orcs was still thick.\nHehe that's a lot. They're pounding from all over the place so besides that there are so many of them.\nBeyond the Shanhai Pass the number of Orcs rushing in was so numerous that they were sick of it.\nSir Vulcanus! Over there golems! The golems are coming!\nhmm?\nGoo Dae-seong who followed pointed in the direction he pointed with his hammer. Huge boulders were moving there.\nGrara── It's been a while since I saw you.\n-come!\n-Big Rock Face!\n-Big Rock Face!\nAmidst the cheers of the orcs the rock golems created by their shamans appear.\nThey thought that the real elite were only the Black Orcs but there were a considerable number of shamans among the Orcs.\nThe reporters who were observing this battlefield swallowed their saliva while filming the two major forces that began to collide in earnest.\nHave forces of this magnitude collided with each other since Cataclysm?\nThere were countries that fought against each other despite the threat of the gate but even so it was only a small-scale local war.\nIt was the first international war in the 40 years since the Gulf War. But if there's one thing that's certain...\nThis war... will not end until we completely annihilate each other!\nIf the previous wars were based on pragmatism and ideology this war was truly a war of annihilation between species and species.",

      "content": "Lionheart vs Orc (2)\n...\nOrcs have their own magic culture called tattoos.\nA shaman puts various ingredients in a cauldron boils them and applies the brewed dye to the skin to give it magical meaning.\nHowever since this type of tattoo technique requires the skin to be exposed defense is reduced because armor is not worn.\nThere were tribes of savage orcs who didn't wear armor to make the most of tattoo magic but Krann the orc's great shaman thought this was ineffective.\nThus war monsters who did not need ‘armor' became the target.\nFirst to the warring warbores then to the foolish chump trolls then to the ogres and giants who were beaten and subjugated.\nBut the conclusion was the same.\n‘Isn't it better to just wear armor?'\nIt was an effective sorcery in the age of savagery. It wasn't easy to supply armor to the orcs who lacked smelting skills.\nHowever as they unified the tribes and lost each time in large-scale battles with Lionheart the Orcs gradually realized the importance of smelting technology and began to seek heavy armor next to large and heavy axes.\nThen wouldn't it be better if they wore the armor of nature?\nThat is how the Great Rock Face was born. This orc-made golem was shaped from a huge block of rock coated with plenty of tattoo dye and remotely controlled by orc shamans to become the strongest weapon of war for orc shamans.\nAnd the Orc's strongest war weapon the Great Rock Face is the highest level of magic that only a high-ranking shaman can cast. That's a whopping 50.\nIn other words it means that there are fifty high-ranking shaman here——\nGARARARARARA——!!\n- Kwak! Boom!\nHuge rocks are shattered helplessly. Even the weight of thousands of tons and the surface reinforced with magic were helplessly broken in front of the monster flying around wielding flames.\nBig ·· Monster like a monster!\nThe orc shaman gritted their teeth as they watched the boulder faces they had worked so hard to create smash one after another.\nA monster-like guy. At that time he far surpassed that old knight.\nWatching this Maghar the champion of Gokrok recalled that he had raided the Lionheart Kingdom army with the warriors of the Beast Gods at the request of the Empire in the past.\nHoly Grail Knight Zereah. The Knight of Dreams and Death was said to be the weakest among the Holy Grail Knights but how many Orc brothers died at his hands?\nMaghar hated the strength of the Holy Grail Knight but that knight was exceptionally strong.\n[Don't be careless. If it wasn't for the Lion Heart King he's the guy who would have destroyed Lionheart.]\nThe evaluation of Rigardo the great warrior of the beast gods. The Mag'har realized that it was never lacking.\nVulcanus is a monster of the era considered one of the strongest Holy Grail Knights of all time. That power is beyond strong and is like an unreasonable disaster.\nBut I'm also God's champion. I can't back down.\nMag'har used the sorcery of Gokrok the shaman god.\nhmm···?!\nVulcanus who was flying over the orc army and smashing Rock Faces one after another witnessed the next target Rock Face being dragged somewhere.\nAnd that's not all. The dozens of Great Rock Faces that Vulcan had destroyed were merging into one.\nWhat is it you've grown quite a bit?\nA great sorcery that is possible to become a champion of Gokrok. When the large rock faces which had already exceeded 50m in height coalesced together a super-large rock face approaching 2 km appeared.\nAt this point it was a super-large mass that would cause the corps to collapse just by walking.\nHa! Bringing all the weird stuff.\nVulcanus giggled and stared at the gigantic golem that reached the clouds.\n────────!!\nIt overturned the terrain just by moving forward and advanced toward the Lionheart Federation Army.\nStop!\nCrazy! How the hell does something like that work!\nHunters and wizards with ranged weapons opened fire on the golem. It's not just them.\n-Target On.\nFighter jets from the Korean Peninsula and the Yellow Sea fire air-to-air missiles and surface-to-surface missiles fired from the Army's multiple rocket launchers pour in.\nThe firepower of the Kikkiruk fire support soldiers was added and the firepower reminded me of a carpet bombing.\n- Spot the bandit. I will enter the engagement.\nAnd the same goes for the Orc Federation Army which is receiving support from the Air Force and Army. A splendid aerial battle between Air Force fighter jets over Shanhaiguan illuminates the sky.\n- Hyunmoo missile bombardment approaching. The knights prepare to deploy the long-distance protection method. 10···9···8──2···! deployment!\nA torrent of ballistic missiles. Hyeonmoo ballistic missiles that exploded hundreds of kilograms of explosives at the same time as they landed exploded in all directions on the battlefield.\nCrazy... the day will come when ballistic missiles are used for infantry strikes!\nThe commanders of the ROK military the Self-Defense Forces and the U.S. Army who were watching it clucked their tongues as they saw a completely different concept of missile operation.\nHowever even with such a barrage of missiles the Orcs did not notice any damage.\nCluck cluck...! Humans' weapons are hot too?\nBut it's nothing compared to the hellfire in the demon realm.\nWhile humans had the highest level of knights represented by the Holy Grail Knights there was a group of warriors called Black Orcs among orcs.\nWarriors of reversal one by one equivalent to a semi-S-class hunter. They destroyed their continent by overcoming the advanced sorcery weapons rained down by the demons of the demon realm.\nLike Lionheart's knights they had at least a fraudulent skill called long-distance nullification.\n[The heat immunity of the Orc Warrior is activated.]\n[Immune to status ailments of the Orc Warrior is activated.]\n[The unbreakable fighting spirit of the Orc Legionnaire is activated.]\n[The overflowing power of the Black Orc Centurion of the god of death Helcan activates.]\nThe protection of countless traits. Even veteran knights of Lionheart joined in and there are already thousands of trait messages flying from the system window.\nEven if you collect betas and hunters from all over the world you might wonder if one-tenth of this will rise.\nThe super-giant golem is coming!!\nAnd in that tremendous battle the super-giant Boulder Face summoned by Maghar the champion of Gokrok reached the Lionheart Federation Army.\nBaltan Burning Sword Knights! Balgum!!\n“Fal sword!!\nVulcan's Holy Grail Knights stand against it. Wielding the flames of Petos the god of war and flame these warmen's firepower is unmatched.\n-Quaaaaaa!\nWaves of pouring fire. Enormous flames were pouring down towards the gigantic golem enough to cover a corner of the war.\n-Kugung!\nEven the super-giant golem flinched at the enormous flame. The aftermath of the flame was strong enough to incinerate the surrounding Orcs.\nKuh...hide behind the Great Stone Face!\nTheir firepower is not infinite! The moment the Great Rock Face steps on their formation they charge all at once!\nThe spell of the Orcs and the Pantheon Knights is a fearsome force. Above all the number of divine power users still receiving the protection of the gods is overwhelming in the pantheon.\nBecause there were a lot of Hunters who had been baptized by Leon.\n-Clucking!\nWhen the Great Rock Face finally advanced despite the blazing sword knights' voice law connection the Kikkiruk warriors shouted something into the radio. At that moment there was movement in space.\n-Unlocking the stealth submerged mode of the space integrated armament platform.\nYapi's space decisive weapon that bombarded the main orc settlements of the Chinese continent in the early days of the war.\nAfter the three-day hiatus the Beast of Destruction revealed its gigantic body.\n- Disable invisible mode. Mobius-class charged particle cannon falls to the effective range.\nThe strongest attack satellite which hid in the distant universe in order not to be detected and intercepted by the shaman of the Orc shaman god descends to geostationary orbit at the same time as concentrating energy.\nAt the same time as output convergence ended the satellite that arrived in geostationary orbit fired charged particle cannons.\n-Quaaaaaa!\nBreak through the troposphere in an instant. It was slammed into the head of the super-giant golem.\n- Kwak Kwah Kwak Kwak!\nThe powerful proton beam emitted from the Moebius-class charged particle cannon melts the top of the golem's head.\nthis···!\nThe Mag'har felt frustrated.\nEnchant the golem! Come on!\nHe was using Gokrok's main power on a super-giant golem. Even if the connection of the Burning Sword Knights is somehow blocked it is difficult to block even the main gun of the star iron satellite fired by the Iron Grail Knight.\n< Gokrok's Tough Skin >\n< Heat Resistant Reinforcement of Gokrok >\n< Gokrok's Attack Reflection >\nThe orc shamans hurriedly bestowed magical protection on the super-giant golem but the firepower of the Mebius-class star-iron main cannon which the Iron Grail Knight had manufactured using the Holy Law far exceeded their defense power.\n- Kwajik! Kwajijik!\nA super-giant golem that melts from the crown. The moment it was finally destroyed the heat of the charged particle cannon that touched the ground burned orcs everywhere.\nAt the same time——\nI am...! I am Vulcanus!!\nVulcanus which pierces through the dazzling flash and flies at once. Vulcanus leaps toward Maghar scattering enormous flames with Divine Advent.\nMag'har cannot block the Holy Swords of Flame he wields.\n······I failed.\nThe moment Vulcan's holy sword struck Maghar's throat.\n- Knock!\nIt was the white wolf that stopped it.\n······You bastard!\nLong time no see friend.\nRigardo the great warrior of the Beast Gods. He blocked Vulcan's holy sword that was swinging at Maghar with his bare hands.\nGRARARA...! You're still alive and not dying Rigar too!!\nI should be able to die until I defeat you who betrayed my tribe.\nRigardo gave power to Vulcanus with an iron fist.\nBoom! With a dizzying sound Vulcan's huge body was slammed into the middle of the Orcs' troops.\nKill them!\nAxes and hammers rained down from all sides. Vulcanus stood up while ignoring the attacks of the Orcs from all directions.\nAre you stronger than before?\nSince you disappeared the gods have given me all powers.\nThe huge crow snatched Vulcan as it was. A claw gripped both of his shoulders to prevent him from swinging the holy sword. Rigardo soared into the sky and let go just as Vulcanus was about to burn himself with flames.\nKuhmm...!\nDivine Advent is still active. At the time when Vulcanus was spraying flames and flying towards him Rigardo grew in size through complete heroic transformation.\nHooo...!\nGreetings friend! And die now!\nCheol-woong who just fell down. It endures even the flames spewed out by Vulcanus and stabs Vulcanus down from the sky.\nAt the same time a green flash erupted from the ground. The ray of light rising toward space struck a satellite in geostationary orbit.\n-Integrated weapon platform damage rate 13.7%. Execution of evasive maneuvers. Initiate retaliatory attack. Throwing star iron bullets.\n- Covers the eyes of the bastards. Do not spare nuclear missiles and fire them.\nThe heat of the battlefield was accelerating like crazy.\nUntil this land disappears altogether.\n* * * *\ncrazy······.\nEveryone watching the battle in Shanhaiguan was stunned.\nPre-modern hand-to-hand combat. An epic firefight by modern firearms. A crowded battlefield where the decisive battle weapons of the future century are harmonized\nEven the clash between the knights and warriors who are protected by the gods unfolds the road to hell.\nStar iron bullets that have fallen from outer space are accelerated to enter orbit and hit the ground with physical force that surpasses nuclear weapons and charged particle cannons with all-weather technology are accompanied by the Holy Law and scatter protons everywhere.\nNuclear warheads fired in retaliation cause artificial suns and mushroom clouds to soar here and there and the eyes of the sorceress cut through the air.\nAn attack that would not be strange even if an entire city disappeared is bursting like a passive. In the midst of this the clash between the Holy Grail Knight and the Champion is the biggest bomb on this battlefield.\nIf you don't receive the protection of the Holy Law... you won't be able to survive even for a second in a demonic cave like this...\nThis is something that is already killing life... How are they fighting in a place like that?\nIn my heart I thought it was a pre-modern ‘savage fight'.\nAfter the Age of Hunters opened the world realized that swords and magic were more effective at the gate than modern weapons.\nHowever it is not only because of the long-established consciousness of the rule of law and democracy that the world is not ruled by Hunters.\nHunters cannot defeat an army. They are minority after all. Even if you gather all the hunters in the world it's only a few million units.\nIn the end as long as he is human he will die from the main gun of a tank and no matter how strong he is he will melt in front of missiles.\nEven more so if nuclear weapons are mobilized it is already impossible to do anything with the power of a superman.\nbut······.\nBlades cut through the atmosphere sorcery roams the outer space and firepower that destroys cities in the blink of an eye bursts here and there.\nThe battle between the Knights and the Orcs in the Shanhai Pass was to crush all the common sense that mankind had built up until now.\nIn this crazy battlefield where even nuclear weapons are used to blind the eyes with the flash of an explosion not firepower is it a knife wielded by a person that decides the outcome?\nThis is... Lionheart. This is... Orcs.\nKnights of Lionheart and Black Orcs of Murka Balak.\nNo matter how far human civilization advances in the future the battles of these monsters will always be in several dimensions.",

      "content": "Lionheart vs Orc (3)\nopening of the gate. The Orc Federation's plan to use the Ragnarok plan was announced but the world did not suddenly beat the Orcs.\n- Authenticity must be verified. The Orc Continental Federation accepts the UN inspection team and announces the inspection results.\n- Could it be the manipulation of Lionheart who hates Orcs?\n- If war breaks out the world economy will stumble. The Lionheart Federation should have been cautious. Even now after negotiations a truce——\nDoubtist human rightsist pacifist.\nIt could have been a virtue in a peaceful era but in a moment of crisis it is of no use whatsoever.\nEven if the threat is immediate and the crisis is revealed I hesitate and delay meeting after meeting after meeting as I start to consider many things in ideology economy society and diplomacy.\nThe other side that calls out unconditional opposition to the rival party claiming war labeling it a warmonger.\nA public opinion war between companies that should benefit from exports and imports from the Chinese continent and the media that received money from the companies.\n- A fight with an orc worker in a bar in Berlin resulted in casualties!\n- Quietly cover! If you touch an orc at a time like this you might end up in a war!\n-We only need to export goods well to the continent.\nThey turned a blind eye to the evils of the ferocious alien race. He abandoned justice and duty by citing various issues.\nStupid things.\nWatching their weakness the Lion Heart King clicked his tongue but he didn't expect much in the first place.\nElected leaders are more concerned with preserving their place than duty and honor.\nHow's the situation at the front?\nThe main force led by Lord Vulcanus of Shanhaiguan is fighting against 200000 Orcs. They have the upper hand thanks to Lord Yapi's fire support but the opponent seems to be formidable.\nThe Shanhaiguan Front was fighting for the 5th day today.\nMaghar the champion of the orc shaman god Gokrok and Rigardo the great warrior of the beast god.\nAnd the Battle of Shanhaiguan in which Vulcanus the Holy Grail Knight of War and Flame and Yakt Spinner the Holy Grail Knight of Iron and Blacksmith clashed shocked the whole world.\nThe future weapon of pre-modern hand-to-hand combat and overwhelming scientific power. The Orc Federal Army even mobilized nuclear weapons and the anti-aircraft defense system of Yapi to intercept them the old Continental Army and the Korean Army supporting the Lionheart Federation Army.\nIt could be said to be the biggest battlefield of the war.\nThe Kikkiruk Landing Force has landed in Shanghai and is securing a beachhead. This side is suppressing the Continental Navy of the Orc Federation rather than the Orc Federation.\nAs soon as the war began Chinese coastal cities were attacked on a massive scale by the force of the waves.\nHan Ha-ri pilots an artificial tsunami caused by a Yacht Spinner's Dominator-class submarine launching dozens of nuclear torpedoes on the continental shelf and hits the coast with waves.\nIn this blow 70% of the Orc Federation Navy was destroyed.\nEven if you don't want to join the orcs it's a mistake to side with non-human orcs. Don't waste too much resources on rescue work.\n“Of course.”\nLionheart is extremely tolerant of his fellow human kingdoms.\nThe reason why they forgave the empire with a warning and beheading the elector even after seeing the warlocks and the warlords is because the doctrine of the pantheon is ultimately full of mercy for humans.\nOf course barbarian serf bugs are not treated as human beings.\nAnyway even for them the unacceptable mortal sin was to cooperate with demons or orcs.\nLeon was not generous enough to protect the safety of the Continental Nations that had succumbed to the Orc Federation.\nBut the problem is the other wires.\nYes it's a disastrous situation.\nThe frontline of the Orc Continental Federation was torn into several pieces.\nWhen it was revealed that the Ragnarok Plan was openly disclosed and that the Orcs were trying to take advantage of it they invaded from all sides as if they had been waiting.\nIn particular it is none other than India that has actively declared its participation in the war.\nIndia is the country with the second largest number of Orcs after China. They also lost the Northeast to a coup.\nSeeing the Chinese continent being torn apart and incorporated into the Orc Federation India felt a sense of crisis and actively waged a preventive war claiming the motto “For humanity in this war.”\nThe same goes for some Southeast Asian countries and Russia. Unlike the European Union which accepted orcs for the purpose of securing humanitarian and economic workers at most these countries imported orcs to the point of crisis.\nTolerating the disrespectful group called the Orc Continental Federation will end the future of the country.\nHowever the Orc Continental Federation did not care. Troops were deployed on all fronts and the result was victory victory and victory again.\n- The Indian wire is completely destroyed.\n- No matter how much the Continental Army was absorbed does this make sense? Which country has the most hunters in the world?\n- The quality is wrong. The human hunters under the Orc Army are forced out but the Orcs are on a very different level.\n-Black-skinned orcs tear apart dozens of A-rank hunters but no matter how many hunters there are can they beat them?\n-Russia issued a general mobilization order. It's not that the hunter pool is small either but it's almost one-sided.\n-Are South Korea and the U.S. fighting properly? Isn't it the place with the most pantheon knights?\nBlack Orcs. Together with Murka Balak they are the beings who tore up countless demons in the den of demons called the Demon World.\nA whopping five hundred black oaks a semi-S rank.\nWith these alone Murka swallowed the continent.\nNot to mention 700000 Orc warriors received the protection of the three great gods of Orcs so a terrible army of hunters of average A rank was unfolded.\nYour Majesty. In this war as time goes by we are at a disadvantage.\nAt Beatrice's sober conclusion Leon honestly nodded.\nIn the past when Lionheart was in its heyday hundreds of thousands of Orcs were slaughtered on the basis of dozens of years.\nThe reason this was possible was because the Lionheart Knights had superhuman strength but the Orcs could not demonstrate their combined strength.\nEven if you see even one warchief they show a fighting power that can't be ignored. What's more a great khan... It's definitely exceptional.\nOrc Great Khan Murka Balak. It was definitely a gag.\nBecause of their unique ferocity and strong self-respect Orcs are rarely assembled into armies.\nIt was common for them to make amends and they didn't listen to systematic orders.\nThe Black Orcs are dutifully acting as intermediate commanders. They have the charisma and power to dominate the Green Orcs.\nAnd those Black Orcs are loyal to the Orc Champions to the Orc Great Khan.\nWhen the okra beasts are equipped with a system and a group system they exert such an overwhelming fighting power.\nIt's only a matter of time before the other allies collapse. As time goes by the continental countries belonging to our federation will gradually collapse.\nTo follow the weak notion of reciprocity based on profit not firm faith and fidelity.\nThere are even nonsense saying that the weakness of being able to do anything for peace should not yield to the orcs.\nThe gods always told me to rule the world. I thought that what Lord Vulcan said was the result of Lord Vulcan's ambition.\nBut I never thought I would be this stupid and weak.\nThe stupidity of those without faith is difficult to understand even for Leon originally from Earth.\nVice. Is ‘it' ready?\nLeon made a decision. Beatrice twisted the corner of his mouth and nodded his head.\nExactly three days later. It can be executed at the optimal timing. For that reason Lord Yapi himself went out.\nOkay let's do it right away. This war won't last long with the weak Earth's army.\nshort-term battle. And it was passed on to all the knights of Lionheart.\n* * * *\nWhoa...! Whoa...!\n[What were you so afraid of?]\nHearing Black Dragon's plaintive words Goo Dae-seong showed a look of uneasiness.\nYeah it has no choice but to be. No matter how much I think about it this is completely alien to my common sense.\nGoo Dae-sung has not been able to hide his anxiety ever since he moved his seat for this operation.\nLike other knights from Earth the operation they were trying to execute was crazy no matter how much you think about it.\nIt's an operation devised by Lord Spinner himself. We won't do anything impossible.\nThat's more unsettling...\nRealizing that the planner of this operation was Yapi Koo Dae-sung couldn't control his chest.\nAnd the same goes for other articles.\nA plan conceived by Lord Yapi?!\nGod crazy! I'm getting out of here!\nHaha it's fucked up...\nEveryone calm down. You're not going to die?\nCheon So-yeon encouraged the knights of the Mansinjeon. She has blind faith in everything that the Holy Grail Knights of the Pantheon and Leon do.\n- Organisms. Any complaints?\nHick!\nGup!\nThe knights of the Pantheon stopped abruptly at the sound of Yapi's machine coming through the communication.\n-If there is an inferior organism dissatisfied with the perfect operation of the superior main machine I want it to jump out of the ship right now.\n“Isn’t it too much?”\nRight! How to get out of here!\n-Noisy organic name Han Ha-ri Kim Jae-hyeok.\nYapi who brought the two together at once began explaining the details of the operation again. And the content seemed simple yet so dangerous.\nIsn't the risk too big? To say that Her Majesty and Her Highness are also involved. There's no turning back.\n-Enemy special entity. It's next to impossible to deal with without two people. Holy Grail Knight Koo Dae-seong recommends focusing only on the assigned mission.\nKeep...\nKarina tapped on the shoulder to Koo Dae-sung who was worried about whether he could do well.\nOld scriptures have already crushed the great devil and faced the demon lord. I can't understand your worries in this work.\nKeep it Your Excellency Karina...\nGoo Dae-seong thought that Karina who spoke calmly had no compassion.\nEven though they are the same Holy Grail Knights he was a B-C grade brat until half a year ago. For me the black gate inevitably puts a huge psychological burden on me.\nWhat. For the Holy Grail Knights battlefields like this are normal. The former owner of your hammer Sir Geobrick once faced an Ogre tribe alone.\nIt's not comforting at all...\nGu Dae-seong's reaction must have been annoyed so the black dragon screamed.\n[Noisy. I and the dragons lent their strength. Be grateful.]\n- He's very condescending.\n[What is it!?]\nA black dragon that reacts directly to Yapi's sarcastic mechanical sound.\n-In the end it's more than transportation and fire support? It is possible to see it alone.\n[This guy?! Do you think you can compare the majesty of your insignificant toy soldiers and dragons!]\nAs the argument between Yapi and the Black Dragon continued Hari quickly hugged Yapi.\nCome on Sir Yapi! Enough of that! Fight whenever you have a chance.\n-Ha-ri Han are you on the side of that lizard?\nOh my gosh...! I'll buy you chicken when I get back!\n-I don't need the inferior food of such an organism.\nI heard you're expanding the franchise! I need to research!\n-·······.\nOnly then did Yaffe stop the audio. Yapi who lost a crushing defeat to Black Dragon in the Pyongyang mayoral election would sometimes argue like this.\n[Don't panic. It is the palace of the king.]\n“······!!”\nWhen Leon appears on the screen everyone's eyes are focused. Beatrice was smiling next to Leon on the screen.\n[The operation will be carried out soon. Lord Spinner must have given you a mission. The Holy Grail Knights will be in charge of the front but your role is also important.]\nLeon looked around at them on the other side of the screen.\nRelationships beyond the gate. The loyal knights of the Lionheart Kingdom.\nAnd the people I met on this earth faithfully followed him even though they were still lacking.\nThey have grown stronger and are now honorable knights of the gods.\nThe names of our enemies are beasts called orcs.\nThe warrior glory these beasts claim to have always destroyed human civilization.\nDo you think the burden is too much? How can you start thinking about fighting without talking to anyone here?\nHowever you too will know. Jim was always right and Jim was justice.\nLeon made a vague arrogant declaration.\nThis Lionheart's opposition is not another justice. It is only evil. You shall not doubt it.\nFor humanity's justice for humanity's survival.\nAlthough Leon is intolerant arrogant and discriminatory.\nThere would be no lie about that being the way for humans.\nGlory to Lionheart! Glory to your spears and swords!\nkill the beast it is our duty\nat the same time-\n-Combined with space integrated armed platform. Completed all-weather duke-class divine engine combination. The massacre operation commenced.\nThe Yacht Spinner the last decisive battle weapon started its engine.\n* * * *\nAfter the Continental Confederation of Orcs was formed they took up a base in Wuhan City.\nOriginally a nomadic people Orcs move and move their bases from time to time but once a tribal union is formed and the chieftain the first thing they do is create a main base.\nThere are definitely disadvantages to not being able to utilize its unique mobility but it is a necessary method for a war with an old enemy.\nDaekan. Completed.\nKrann the leader of the Black Orcs reported to Murka what he had been preparing for a long time.\nWith this we have the power to go head-to-head with the gods of the pantheon. It was close.\nokay.\nAt Murka's reaction Krann nodded.\n“But the question is did you really need to build them here? With the divine powers gathered now you can only maneuver within this city right?”\nAsked if it would be more appropriate to invest that resource in a war against the Lionheart Federation.\nMurka replied to this.\nKran you are also inexperienced.\nOnly the Great Khan would say such a thing to me.\nBut don't deny it. Just as Leon was the oldest warlord in Lionheart Murka was the oldest warlord among Orcs.\nAnd if the two have one thing in common it is that they are undefeated commanders.\nHe knew intuitively.\nLionheart. Do you think that orc hater that annihilator will miss the opportunity to annihilate the orcs?\nI don't quite understand.\nThis war was not a war that they could win in the first place. They are strong but the other humans underneath them are weak.\nMurka pointed to the European Union which has withheld its participation in the war and continues to talk nonsense about economic sanctions and seizure of overseas assets.\nThis world has accepted too many orcs to overcome the brief crisis of the gate.\nInstead of improving his constitution and achieving balanced development he left it to the Orcs.\nIt's the same with those who entered the war. Fools who think about stepping down because the damage is getting bigger. Even though the fate of the species depends on the outcome of the war they are indecisive.\nLionheart knows. That if the orcs were not driven out they would perish.\nIsn't that why for thousands and tens of thousands of years Orcs have been blinded and caught?\nThe fact that the Holy Grail Knights and War Knights had the authority to wage war and summoned knights from time to time to wipe out the Orcs was a preventive war to prevent the growing power of the Orcs.\nHowever there are only a handful of Grail Knights and the Holy Grail Knights who are truly Lionhearts here. Except for them no one knows the horrors of orcs.\nTherefore this war cannot last long. Then-\n“There is only a short-term battle for this place.”\nindeed······.\nAbsolute charisma that conquers all orcs. Defeat Murka Balak and the champions and disintegrate the Federation.\nMurka was convinced that Leon would definitely use any means to launch a short-term battle against the Orc Federation headquarters.\nRigardo tethers the fiend on the front line. Call in the Maghar instead.\n······ Maghar? Then the front line will be pushed back?\ncome.\n·······?\nKrann inadvertently followed Murka's gaze. And he witnessed\n“A shadow on the sun?”\nA giant asteroid obscuring the sun was falling toward Earth.",

      "content": "Lionheart vs Orcs (4)\nAutomated drone-controlled bombing by Marquis class a land decisive weapon.\nAn artificial tsunami attack by the Dominator class a decisive naval weapon.\nSatellite bombing by space decisive weapon integrated armament platform.\nThe destruction protocol by Yapi's super-academic ability is powerful enough to annihilate one or two cities in a day if he puts his mind to it.\nHowever despite this large-scale destructive attack the Orcs silently endured and even counterattacked.\nWhen the drones which spread the mist of death imbued with Beatrice's holy power carried out biological and chemical warfare Orc hunters went hunting for the drones and the tsunami reduced the radius of attack by boldly abandoning the coastal cities.\nThe same goes for satellite weapons. Every time it enters orbit which is the effective attack range Orc champions try to intercept it like ghosts.\nIn short there is no decisive blow. Yapi realized how transcendent beings the Orc Champions who were on the same level as the Holy Grail Knights were.\n-Then crush it with an overwhelming mass.\nWhat mass weapon is capable of doing that on a battlefield teeming with monsters that even intercept satellites in space?\nThe answer is at hand.\n-Observation of the orbit of the stars by the scabbard of the holy sword. Able to initiate a Star Iron Summoning sequence.\nAn essential comet to make Lionheart's Blessed Star Iron Armor. It is thoroughly used for destruction purposes.\nIt's not impossible. But I guess my holy power won't be enough to attract something bigger than the last comet.\nBeatrice saw Caracael the demon lord of wisdom drop dozens of comets at the gate that reproduced Lionheart's final great war.\nHowever that was possible because Karakael is a magical child far beyond Beatrice.\nIt is difficult for her to reproduce Karakael's power by herself.\n- Solve the lacking part with scientific power. If this machine was made of star iron the restrictions on outer space activities would greatly disappear.\nAfter searching for the largest possible comet candidates near the Earth's orbit the asteroid with a diameter of 20 km was selected. Drop it towards Earth... the Orc stronghold of the Chinese continent.\nIt's really really crazy this! If it wasn't for the vocal law it would be at the level of the end of the world?! It's a reenactment of the Cretaceous Great Clash!\nThe knights who enjoyed the common sense of the earth including Hari were fed up with this ignorantly honest plan of destruction.\n- Absolutely correct. Let the inferior organisms be silent.\nThe other side of the asteroid falling to Earth. The all-weather all-round armed duke-class follows the asteroid with the best members of the pantheon including Leon.\nThe identity of the all-weather all-weather duke-class in the entire earth sphere is a space battleship. Even this superweapon which can't even move unless it's the main body of Yappi with the divine reactor attached looks like a tiny speck in front of the asteroid.\nCompared to the comet that the Lord of Wisdom summoned the number is small but the size is amazing.\nIn the past Leon who was in the middle of the battlefield where the comet and the sun collided in a decisive battle with Karakael looked down at the green planet Earth the home of mankind.\nThe city will disappear but this is also a sacrifice for mankind to triumph over the orcs. Now let's go. To build the bug beasts.\n-Kick!\nIn response Yapi started the engine installed on the other side of the asteroid.\nIn outer space dozens of nuclear engines were installed to propel the asteroid which could not be pulled by Beatrice's holy power alone.\nA state-of-the-art nuclear pulse engine manufactured by Yacht Spinner an iron and blacksmith Holy Grail Knight.\nEach of the dozens of mankind's largest aircraft carriers the engine that could be operated by the young man began to accelerate the asteroid with fire.\n* * * *\ncrazy······.\nThe orcs saw the fall of an asteroid that obscured the sun.\nEven the Black Orcs who had encountered all sorts of unusual things with their long war experience were like that.\nIntercept!\nShoot even a nuke!\nIt is an asteroid that is close enough to be seen with the naked eye. There weren't many weapon systems to counter it and the Orcs forced the Continental Army to launch nuclear missiles.\n-Quaaaaaaa!!\nChinese heritage. Intercontinental ballistic missiles accumulated by ignoring the UN's proposal for denuclearization and paying for expensive maintenance rise from the ground.\nIn this war nuclear weapons are not something to be afraid of. This is because the knights of the Pantheon have a built-in concept defense that nullifies long-range attacks.\nThe same goes for mediocre soldiers and hunters who receive the protection of higher-ranking knights.\nHowever the destructive power of the nuclear power itself cannot be ignored. It's because it crushes the terrain with an explosion.\nTwenty-four such nuclear missiles. It is the result of the former Continental Army who panicked at the shocking reality of falling asteroids pressed the missile launch button without delay.\n- 10 seconds until crash!\nThe Beasts of Earth's destruction reach a critical mass. The fission reaction caused by the megaton-class nuclear warhead soon hit the asteroid with atmospheric pressure.\nAww...!\nI averted my eyes for a moment at the flash of the explosion but I soon saw the result with my own eyes.\niced coffee······.\nThere was not a single scratch on the asteroid. Dozens of nuclear missiles fired in haste could not destroy an asteroid with a mass of 20 km.\nIt might have been better if it had been shot at the most vulnerable time when it was incinerated by entering the atmosphere.\nBut even this would be wishful thinking. The comet pulled from the celestial body by Lionheart's secret technique is imbued with divine power by the holy power of the saints.\nHow foolish it would be to destroy it with a human-made weapon.\nUse it.\nThe Great Khan's permission fell. At that moment Maghar who was urgently called from the Shanhaiguan responded.\nI understand great khan.\nMaghar the champion of the orc shaman god Gokrok. He placed his hand on the ‘huge tower' in front of him.\nGokrok's gaze. Activate.\nIt is a huge tower.\nA giant tower with blazing green eyes. Blowing oppressive heat it flashes towards the falling planet.\n[With my grace wipe out the tin cans.]\nThe tower of the sorcerer god who cruelly burns those who have not received his grace. A green beam of light rained down from that gigantic gaze.\n-Kwa...!\nFor a moment the sounds around disappear.\n- Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa!!\nA roaring sound resembling a crashing wave races toward the heavens.\n──────!!\nAn asteroid collides with a green beam. In an instant the fall of the asteroid stopped.\n·······!?\nIt was an unbelievable sight that an asteroid that hadn't slowed down a bit since entering the atmosphere stopped above the city.\nOr rather is it because of my mood that I feel like I'm being pushed toward the universe?\n-Tactical maneuver. < The Iron Protection >.\nAt that moment the holy power of iron surrounds the asteroid. An iron protection that withstands an opponent's attack. The asteroid seemed to withstand Gokrok's gaze due to the blacksmith god's grinding.\nHelkhan! Your great warrior is here!\nThe giant statue moves. It's a statue of a warrior. From that point on the spiritually embodied power gradually grew larger and eventually reached the falling asteroid.\nA hideous thing. Break it down.\nBalbaza the champion of Orc Avatar Helcan. Helcan's spiritual body which was revealed by pouring his divine power swung a huge fist at the asteroid soaked in Gokrok's gaze.\nThe moment that fist collided with the asteroid——\n-Quaaaaaang!\nShattering asteroid. Fragmented asteroids scatter in all directions.\ncrazy!\nNonsense!!\nthe other side of the asteroid. The knights who boarded the Duke class were shocked to see it.\nIt was a 20 km long asteroid. Who could have imagined that it would be broken by physical destructive force?\nIt's not over yet tin cans.\nThe champion of the Orc Hunt God Skunik. Skira raised a huge javelin.\nSkunik's Great Javelin. It aimed at the duke-class that appeared behind the asteroid that had been smashed by the power of the hunting god.\nIt's a giant bomb. An orc's strongest throwing weapon imbued with the power of the hunting god and fired directly by the champion.\nBe impaled and die. My prey.\nBoom!\nAnd a huge javelin shot up from the ground.\n* * * *\nAaaagh! It's a crisis a crisis!\nI smashed the asteroid! That makes sense!\nThe interior of the ship is noisy. That's right.\nWhat an asteroid. It's not the size of a real planet but isn't the unreality of a 20km class star being destroyed something that only comes out of a Hollywood movie?\nNonsense······.\nGoo Dae-seong the Holy Grail Knight was stunned by the reality unfolding in front of his eyes. Even if that's the case what about the other articles?\nI see I can't believe I've completed that far.\nHis Excellency Karina?\nKarina's reaction. It was when everyone's eyes turned to the reaction as if they knew that.\n[Karina.]\nLeon appears on the screen. Although he also clicks his tongue it does not look like he has witnessed the impossible.\nYes Your Majesty.\n[The idol of Helkan and Gokrok. Then there must be a third idol.]\nAn orc's idol is only one in a historical battle. It's unprecedented to have made three of them.\n[The existence of the Great Khan of the Orc is unprecedented.]\nA bizarre act of Orcs savage raiders setting up an ‘idol' in one base.\nThe strongest new weapon that can be created only when the divine power of the orc god worshiped by the great tribe is fully filled.\n[Coming soon. There are probably only three people in this era who can cope.]\nOne of them is in Shanhaiguan. Karina realized her own role.\nSir Spinner. I'll move to the stern.\ntake up the sword Carina climbed aboard the windswept ship with Yapi's anti-gravity device attached.\nKarina.\nLeon was there first. holding a spear\nCould you lend it to me?\nJim can do it.\nAt Leon's words Karina shook her head.\nYour Majesty you must preserve your strength. Above all... I have faced Skira's great javelin once.\nLeon passed his holy spear to Karina without hesitation.\nThe Holy Spear of the Lion Heart King.\nUnlike the holy swords and holy spears of ordinary Holy Grail knights blessed by one god it is a divine weapon blessed by all gods according to the Lion Heart King's capabilities.\nThe lion heart king's holy relic has the characteristic of being able to fully contain the power no matter how many gods intervene.\nVentasis Dragonia.\nKarina called out the two gods.\n[Ready my avenger.]\nVentasis God of Darkness and Vengeance.\n[It was the holy power to give birth to my descendants but I'll leave it to you.]\nDragonia the god of gold and contracts.\nCarina Dragonia is a Holy Grail Knight representing the two gods.\nShe held up the holy spear where the holy powers of the two gods were concentrated.\nDie tin cans!\nSoon after the spear of the hunting god is thrown. A great javelin that makes the city numb with only the sonic boom that soars and emits. against it-\nSkira's great javelin is a spear of infallibility. If that's the case there's no choice but to smash it from the front.\nKarina runs through the stern of the Duke class. The moment she stepped on her stern her yapi's electronic catapult assisted her launching her Carina vertically ahead of her ship.\nSkunik's Great Javelin.\nFor hunters of the Orc Hunting God javelins are not simply hunting ordinary animals.\nA wild land where carnage and savagery prevail. Orcs have been fighting tirelessly against menacing monsters that threaten their tribe.\nFor the hunters of Skyra who ride beasts and hunt monsters under the protection of the hunting god the javelin is for hunting great beasts.\nIn the wilds that make the difference between life and death the spears of Orc hunters have always kept the tribe safe.\nSkira's great javelin is the pinnacle.\nAs long as the holy power of the hunting god exists as long as the champion who will shoot it is alive it is an idol of the orc god that makes it possible to throw a deadly great javelin.\nIts penetrating power kills even beasts called gods.\n‘The power of darkness is the strongest cutting power. The golden power boasts the dragon's unique violent destructive power.'\nKarina's two holy powers against him. Ventasis the god of darkness and vengeance and Dragonia the god of gold and contracts are forces specialized in slaughter and destruction.\nDarkness of Ventasis forging a demonic sword for the avengers. The destructive holy power of Dragonia which was called the Dragon God is so dominant that it cannot be covered even with the characteristics of the God of Contracts.\n‘The Grand Seongbeop class which only has increased destructive power is unsuitable for use against people but...'\nJust scattering huge power is a splendor that only young people like. Karina is a thoroughly pragmatic character but at the same time she is able to focus this enormous power with precision because she has experience in presbytery.\nThe tip of the holy spear touches Skira's great javelin. With this power that is difficult to control it pierces the large javelin aiming at the Duke class from the front.\nHeh it reminds me of the old days. I can't imagine having to fight Skira's great javelin twice.\nShe is also an orc slayer next to Lionheart. Against the Orcs it is a part of the Holy Grail Knights who have fallen.\nDie tin can!\nIt's annoying. Get out of here beast.\nIn the next moment two gigantic forces collided in the sky above the city——\nAll clouds within a radius of 100 km were pushed out.",

      "content": "Lionheart vs Orc (5)\nThe clash of enormous power wielded by the two transcendentalists created waves beyond imagination.\nThe disintegration of the laws of physics that occurs the moment the powers of the gods collide head-on. The shock wave caused by the wave pushes the whole world away.\nFrom the point of impact the air dissipated and the clouds flew up to 100 km. Fragments of the shattered asteroid could not withstand the shock wave and were crushed or scattered in all directions of the continent.\nAaaaaaagh!\nQuaaaaaaaaa!\nsky and ground. Screams echo from both sides.\nThe knights of the Pantheon who were waiting inside the space battleship and the Orcs on the ground were terrified as they witnessed the shock wave caused by the collision.\nThere's no way anything could survive in the middle of such a shock\nKarina!\nKarina who was at the center of the impact was swept away by the waves. Leon stretches out her hand but even the Duke-class battleship is thrown back in shock. Her Leon's arms couldn't reach her.\nSir Spinner!\n-Emergency rescue sequence initiated. Dragon Squad ejection.\nThe largest cargo box of the ship is opened and dragons including the black dragon jump out.\n-Kwalala lala lala!!\nBlack Dragon the mayor of Pyongyang and his five dragons spread their curled wings and flew.\nAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\nBattleship...!\nA battleship that is swept away by the shockwave and bounces off. Yapi also responded.\n-Emergency thrust deflection nozzle fully deployed. posture control.\nKwak Kwa Kwa Kwa Kwam!\nIt smashes the concrete road surface bounces like a rubber ball and crushes buildings in the city. Nevertheless the Duke-class decisive battle armament is set by adding the output of the combined space integrated armament platform.\n-Successful inertia deflection thrust control. Abnormality in energy transfer. Emergency dispatch of nanobots for repair.\nIt landed as if it was thrown off by a huge power collision. The damage is not small.\nWipe them out!\n“WHAAAAAAAAA────!!”\nAnd the timing when the duchy stopped. Orcs who were waiting all over the city rushed in all at once.\n- Approaching enemy units. Needs good damage recovery.\nWahhahahaha! It's me who cuts their throats...!\nThe warriors of the orc Avatar Helcan. It was the moment when the Green Orcs who had received the baptism of commitment jumped toward the battleship with red-shining axes.\nHooup...!\nThe battleship's ejection port. A black girl pops out of there. The pure white holy sword and black demonic sword she wielded instantly cut the orcs in front of her.\nThat's a lot...!\nCheon So-yeon commander of the 1st Knights of the Manshinjeon Naju. As soon as she regained her senses she jumped out and mercilessly crushed the vanguard of the orcs.\nHe's a strong man! Turn hunters into beehives!\nSoon after the orc hunters arrived and threw javelins at once adding to the acceleration of the wild boars they rode.\nKuh...!\nSo-yeon cut down the javelins that flew in but she couldn't block them all. Her power the Holy Law of Ventasis is the power of revenge that specializes in one-on-one.\nIt is not effective in one-on-one battles not group battles.\nRight!!\nIn the meantime the javelin that could not be deflected is pierced head-on into So-yeon's star armor. The armor blocked the blow but the javelin thrown with her tremendous strength pushed the slender girl's body and flew away.\n-thud!\nThe moment So-yeon's body collided with the battleship the javelins flew in succession. Massive throws that cannot be blocked with star iron armor alone.\nGoddess Ariana...!\nIt was the shield of light that protected his comrades. The holy relic that Han Soo-ho expanded with holy power blocked all the javelins that hit the ship directly.\nWell done Suho!\nA red girl knight who jumped out of a battleship. Sparks redder than her impressive red hair shoot through her sword.\n-Quaaaa!\nA torrent of fire engulfs the orc vanguard. Some of them endured with ‘fire immunity' and so on despite the mighty firepower but Hanhari's sexual method is not the only one.\nShe is a born knight of war and flame and a goddess of the sea and waves. Han Hari's technique is a dual attribute of flame and wave.\nBig...!\nHold on...!\nThe orcs who survived were puzzled. Even though it was swallowed up by powerful flames for some reason its entire body was wet. A sense of alienation that the heated body is wet.\nBut the moment to understand it did not come.\nDid you get wet just fine?\n-Quarreung!\nThe sky fluctuates and the clouds roll. Thunder fell the next moment.\nThe thunder and lightning struck by Kim Jae-hyeok the knight of Ultima the god of sky and thunder destroyed the drenched orcs in a chain.\nQuaaaaagh!\nThe screams of the orcs echoed from all directions. Orc shamans murmured on the battlefield where hundreds of orcs were slaughtered in an instant.\nWhile they're not paying attention we'll intensively attack with the authority of the sorceress Gokrok. They'll die without knowing anything—\nA moment a shadow cast. The orc shaman realized too late that it was a human shadow.\nYou can't get in the way.\nA man in green armor. He jumped from the battleship and leaped into the midst of the shamans in one fell swoop.\nThis this distance at once?!\nThe leaping power possessed by the transcendent being called the Holy Grail Knight was not something mortal beings could understand.\nSeongbeop < Swallow the Earth >\nGoo Dae-sung the Holy Grail Knight of Life and Abundance trampled on the floor! It roared and swallowed the Orc shaman at once.\n- Goong!\nHe is a knight of the earth. A saint chosen by the mother of the earth as her proxy.\nThe place where his footsteps reached is his land.\n[Now this is my body.]\nDemera's power dominates the land. The land that had been eroded by overflowing life force soon backed up the article of life.\nHis Excellency Karina...\n[Never mind that child. He's a kid who goes beyond Vulcan if he's experienced. He will do the right thing himself.]\nGoo Dae-seong gritted his teeth at the goddess’ confinement and saw the crowd of orcs.\nA flying orc?\nThe ones approaching are Orcs riding wyverns they don't know where they got them from.\n“Come to think of it among the Orcs in the Republic of Wuhan there is a unit that specializes in taming flying beasts...”\nOver the past 30 years the orcs have also grown in power as they have adapted to the Earth.\nThe reason why the Orc Continental Confederation was able to swallow the continent so easily was because there were Orcs who had completed their adaptation to the Earth and accumulated strength.\n‘It's annoying with only the Black Orcs but there are so many elites like that.'\nGoo Dae-seong wondered if he had to deploy the earth's castle method to intercept them but that concern soon disappeared.\nTsushima < The Death Eye >\nBlack light spreads out. The light of destruction embroidering the sky erased the Orc Wyvern riders from the world.\nOh······.\nOverwhelming firepower and incredible accuracy. After her appearance the great magician queen who was said to have turned the world's magic academia upside down ‘erased' the orcs with a gesture of her hand.\nI've taken care of the annoying Orcs so I'll leave the rest up to you.\nAs if responding to her words two dragons poured out of the cargo compartment of the duke class. They are the ones left to support Ham from the Dragon Squad that went out to support Karina.\n-Kwalala la la la la!\nThey spread their huge wings and flew over the city. Some of the surviving Orc Wyvern riders resisted but they fell helplessly in front of the dragon's unique advanced flight skills and powerful firepower breath.\nWith this the spirit of the vanguard has been broken...\nThe formation of this side has not been captured. There are still many of them.\nWow! Your Majesty?!\nKoo Dae-sung was shocked by Leon who appeared riding a Stallion. Behind him the Magician Queen was riding casually.\nThe shock of kindness sent the horses away. It would take some time for the knights to bring the horses out.\nHmm it was a riotous landing so I can't help it. I'll have to wait some time.\nLeon reached out his hand as he saw the orcs coming from all sides.\nDivine Punishment < Sun Appearance. >\nAbove the city it floated in an instant.\nWhat what?!\nKwaaaaaaaagh!\nAnother sun that appeared without any foreshadowing. The heat of the sun which melted just by approaching beat down on the city.\n-Mi the missile is destroyed!\n-Concrete buildings are melting?!\n- The radio is dead! That sun is breaking all the machinery!\nAnd it threw not only the Orcs into confusion but also the former Continental Army of the Orc Federation.\nIn addition to accumulating a wide range of real-time damage mechanical devices are also broken by enormous heat and magnetic fields.\nTatar the god of the sun and judgment. It is an authority that radiates the widest range of power among all the holy laws that Leon can wield.\nHuh thanks to you I'll be able to breathe. Hurry up and reorganize to Sir Yapi—\nFor a moment Goo Dae-sung felt chills. A ‘gaze' as if something is staring at you.\n────!!\nA flash that takes away the light. Goo Daesung and Beatrice reacted at the same time.\nTsushima < strongest hardness defense. Elemental Shield >\nThe strongest strongest defense created by magic. The multiple layers of defense cannot withstand the green ray and are destroyed in an instant.\nAnd it hit Koo Dae-seong and the asphalt was ground and pushed away.\nUgh...!\ngreat heat. Not only does the earth's shield get crushed in real time but even the armor melts.\nHuh...!\nMaximize the strength of the shield by maximizing the power of the Holy Spirit and twist the trajectory of the light beam with supernatural power. In the process the buildings he brushed were cut in half but even that was a trivial matter.\nBack pressure...!\nGoo Dae-sung sighed in relief as he deflected the beam with more momentum.\nI suddenly became comfortable in the middle...\nIs it the limit of the light beam? The question of Goo Dae-seong did not last long.\nIs it Gokrok's tower? It's more powerful than the Eastern Desert Orcs built.\nIt was the path of the light beam thanks to Leon who took away the light of the light beam with the holy sword. With the power of the goddess Ariana it absorbed most of the light the main energy of the beam.\nGo thank you Your Majesty.\nDon't try to defend against that power head-on. One blow is a destructive power equivalent to divine punishment.\nDestructive power on the level of divine punishment that can be said to be a special technique that surpasses the great castle method. Koo Dae-seong was shocked to realize that it had been launched twice in a row.\nAnd the third?\nWe'll be firing soon. But that's not all.\n-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAA────!!\nEveryone's eyes are directed towards the ‘Giant' that reveals a huge presence.\nThe one that smashed the falling asteroid...\nIt is the spiritual body of Helcan summoned as an idol of the god of death Helcan.\nGoo Dae-seong swallows with a gulp.\nHelcan's big foot which was summoned by Balbaja the champion of Helcan the Orc Athlete in Pyongyang. It was Goo Dae-seong who blocked it and that's why I realized its destructive power.\nIf a monster like that runs rampant the city will be in ruins in 10 minutes. And that's not all.\nThe idols of the Orcs bestow enormous blessings on the Orcs just by their existence.\n[The statue of Helkan grants great power to the orc fighters.]\n[Gokrok's tower raises the spirituality of Orc shamans.]\n[Skunik's javelin amplifies the senses of the orc hunters.]\n[The statue of Helkan is———-]\n[The Tower of Gokrok is————]\n[Skunik's javelin———-]\nKoo Dae-sung swallowed while checking the system message.\nA series of ignorant buffs. As if this land was the territory of the Orcs... Even the protection of the Holy Grail Knights was blocked.\nYour Majesty no way...\nThe only ones who can fight in full condition on this battlefield are the Holy Grail Knights who can overcome their protection.\nAnd aiming for that moment-\n“······!!”\nEveryone feels a chill chill.\nA strange chill that I felt a little while ago. It came as a embodied danger.\n[The Orc Grand Sorcerer Kran raises the Frost Palace.]\n-Quaaaaaaaaaa!!\nIt rose from the middle of the city in an instant.\nA drunk heart after brutally killing the resurrected Frost Queen in the Siberian snowfields the other day. The cold heart which could not be destroyed by the existing human power is resurrected by the hands of the great sorcerer.\n[A chill creeps in.]\n-The slow rate is forced to 65%.\n- Magic power consumption is limited.\n- The Frost Queen's soldiers are summoned.\nA car that is still outnumbered. it happens even more Added to the harsh battlefield environment.\nThe beasts have prepared quite a bit. I can't believe they prepared this level of legendary idols in history and prepared for the last move.\nYour Majesty if we go on like this...\nWe will drown before the waves of the great army.\nThe troops brought in for the surprise assault were all made up of a small elite group of knights. Leon felt that there was only one way to overcome this situation.\nBice Koo Dae-seong and Spinner!\nYes...! Your Majesty!\n-Kick!\nLeon directed.\nEach one of them. Destroy the idols and the palace that you don't want to see! Jim breaks through the front. I will attract their troops as much as possible.\n······.\nBeatrice gritted her teeth when Leon chose the most dangerous front. The great Khan of the enemy who has not yet revealed himself.\nThere was no way he would allow Leon to be alone.\nI have no choice but to do it.\nNevertheless the means available on this battlefield are limited. Leon's method is almost the only effective hit.\n- I will organize the troops.\nYapi's Duke-class battleship which unloaded all of the knights began to move. Even at this moment Yapi grasps the optimal battle situation and reads his victory.\n-Her Highness Queen Beatrice. Capture the Ice Castle with Han Hari and the 1st Squad.\n- Goo Dae-sung. With Kim Jae-hyeok and Cheon So-yeon Go-Crok's tower attack.\n- This machine will attack the statue of Helkan with Han Soo-ho and the remaining troops.\nWait Lord Yapi. So who's going to dispose of Skunik's javelin?\n-Already entered the attack.\n- Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nIt was then. East from where they stand. A huge explosion that can be heard all the way here. The place where the sound was heard was where Skunik's javelin was.\nLeon rode on the back of his best friend Stallion.\n“Then wish each of you good luck.”\nThe final showdown with a time limit. Leon shouted.",

      "content": "Lionheart vs Orc (6)\nbounce in the sky\n-Quaaaaaaa!\nhuge shockwave. The center of a collision that crushes the entire city. Karina briefly lost her mind.\n- Crowra la la la la!!\nTen seconds later she came to her senses. It was because her ears hurt from the loud howling of the lizard.\nnoisy.\n[what?!]\nI saved you at best. The black dragon cries out and displays its temper. Karina stood up from the claws of the dragon that had snatched her up.\nthis······.\n[What's going on?]\nI missed the Holy Lance Your Majesty lent me.\nAt the time when I lost consciousness for a moment it seems that the strength of my grip loosened. Unlike Leon Karina has no way to find the Holy Spear because she does not have the power of the lion's heart to retrieve and deploy her weapons in space.\nDid you and the dragons come to support me?\nKarina suddenly saw dragons flying around the black dragon.\nFive including the black dragon. Excluding the dragons on each front these five were most of the dragons mobilized in this assault.\nPower is not enough.\n[What are you thinking?]\nAssault towards Skunik's javelin launch pad. As long as I have the strength I will continue to throw javelins.\nKarina pointed to the location of the nearby Skunic's great javelin.\nLike Gokrok's Tower Skunic's great javelin which can be said to be the strongest ranged weapon of the Orcs does not shoot powerful beams like Gokrok's Tower but it is annoying that it shoots a javelin with the ‘death' property. sour.\n“In the past when I was the Grand Duke of Dragonia I encountered them during the subjugation of Orcs. It took a lot of effort to destroy them. It would be difficult if not now.”\nShe had once competed with a great tribe of orcs who had built idols for the orc hunting god Skunik. The javelin which was fired from time to time could only be destroyed after many knights sacrificed.\nThat's not the only idol of the Orc God. Inevitably the Holy Grail Knights will go to destroy it.\nTherefore my role is to destroy Skunik's idol. Only then will it be able to lighten the burden of the Lion Heart King who will duel with the Orc Great Khan.\n[good night! If we have the strength of our great dragons it will be better than those tin cans!]\nThe four dragons flying in formation with the black dragon's confident roar\nBe careful. The one protecting it is the champion of the hunting god. No matter how dragon-\n- Kwaaak!\nAnd something pierces through the black dragon's wings. The black dragon crashed while screaming in pain.\n-Kooung!\n[······!]\n[······Save your own people!]\nThe dragons hurriedly fall at the black dragon's fall. But they had to dodge the javelins fired at them.\nnice······.\nKarina who fell with the black dragon that was snatching her crashed. She freed herself from the black dragon's claws and hurried the fallen black dragon.\nWake up! It's not time to look away!\n[Cheerful...! These fucking bastards! dare me! Tear off my proud wings!]\nFortunately it was not fatal. A dragon is a dragon even though its wings are torn and it is difficult to fly. Because the source of that power came from enormous magical power.\nBy the way... it's already surrounded.\nKarina saw the black dragon and the gazes staring at her.\nOrc hunters. These boar riders are the representative hunter group of the orcs.\nAnd one wild boar with a uniquely huge size and strong presence.\nThe legendary wild boar which seemed to only come out of mythology and its rider came directly to hunt the dragons.\nHehehe five dragons and a can of captain. Today must be the most glorious hunting day for me.\n“Are you a champion?\nKarina brushed off the dust from her hair and pulled out the magic sword.\nThis work is the grand duke of Dragonia. Lionheart King Leon Dragonia Lionheart's eldest daughter. Karina.\nSkyra the Great Warrior of Skunik. I'll be adding a Bitch and a Dragon's Bone to my collection today.\nThe warriors of the two gods collided against each other.\n* * * *\nThe power of a horse charge is multiplied the more it is done in a group.\nIt often happens that hundreds of cavalrymen can crush an army a hundred times larger than a man because a warhorse larger than a man and a heavily armored knight riding on it overwhelm the infantry in force.\nA group of cavalrymen charging together as one has reigned supreme in the history of human warfare for thousands of years.\nbut.\nThe lack of mass in short the less intimidating the minority the less destructive power the cavalry class gives.\nNot to mention the opponent is short-term.\nEspecially if this is a warrior group made up of war veterans.\nStupid...! You're going to pierce us alone?\nAs an S-class Hunter and Orc Engineer he was proud of his heavily armed men.\nOne of the best S-class attack squads on the continent. Although the rank has been lowered with the appearance of the Black Orcs there is an awareness that this side is also strong.\nI've heard that the opponent is a can that's as great as Daekan but no matter how much I think about it I don't think I'll lose.\n“Our big ax warriors are the strongest on the continent! Against us like that——?!”\n-Kwaa...!\nThe first crash roared. Orcs at the forefront flew through the air the terrain was crushed and dismembered corpses splattered in all directions.\nKuh... The momentum is good! But it'll be blocked soon! He's alone——\nuh?\n【Strongest Assaulter】\nThe modifiers such as ‘strongest' or ‘most' in traits or titles are modifiers that have never existed before.\nBecause it's really only given to one person.\nIt is something that is only given to those who have ‘specialized' powers that surpass even the demon lords across all dimensions not on the narrow planet Earth.\nBut mortals cannot have such a thing.\nTitles such as ‘strongest' ‘most' or ‘maximum' are the exclusive property of demon lords. Then-\ndie···!\nIf there is a human who slaughter even demon lords and claim the title of ‘strongest' what form does it have?\nKwaaaak!\nShut up?!\nIt has a human shape.\nSophisticated design with smooth and flowing lines. However she was clad in iron armor that was so strong that nothing in the world seemed to be able to invade it——\nThe new punishment < Fire of the Battlefield >.\nBreathing fire with your gaze——\nThe divine punishment < Spear of the Sky >.\nIt thundered with a voice.\nM-stop it! Stop it!\nI can't stop!\nA monster in human form wields a sword.\n-Kkeuhiiing!\nThe monster carrying the monster runs amok and tramples the green beasts.\nIt only took 3 minutes for the S-class Orc raid team to break through. The Orc engineering chief destroyed his men and trembled in front of the knight who came to him.\nBig...!\nWhat kind of bullshit is this!\nI am a warrior of the plains. It's an orc warrior. A chieftain who leads hundreds of orcs and a warrior among warriors who decided to serve the great orc great khan!\nThe Orc engineering chief struggled to regain his fighting spirit and picked up an axe.\nI'm not afraid of you!\nIt's a miraculous courage. It is the courage of a beast that can shake off fear and roar even in the face of irresistible natural disasters.\nHow did the Lion Heart King accept the courage that is worthy of admiration even though he is an enemy?\nThen be more courageous.\n- Kwaaak!\nThe holy sword struck mercilessly and split the Orc engineering commander in two.\nthree like this. When the blood of the orcs on the holy sword had already reached 1000 they appeared.\nI made you wait Lionheart!\nhammer strikes Destructive momentum of the moment. Leon deflected the attack with his holy sword. At the same time Stallion spins rapidly and strikes him with a swift rear kick.\nnice···!\nThe orc kicked by the horse backed away. Leon felt that the orc's skin color was different from other orcs.\n“Is it a black oak?”\n“Hehehe yes I am the bodyguard of the great Orc Grand Khan Murka Balak. The Great Black Orc War——”\nA beast has a long will!\nLeon approaches in an instant with Stallion's main wave. When his holy sword flashed people could be felt from all sides.\nAttack!\nfive at a time. Black Orc Boar Riders riding wild boars attack Leon.\nStalion!\nLeon's name. Stallion made a surprising move.\nIt easily ignores the inherent limitations of a horse specialized in straight-line movement and escapes by mixing sideways and diagonal movements.\nWhat?!\nthis···!\nThe Boer riders who lost their prey in an instant caused a disaster by colliding with each other.\nnice···!\nIt's fast it's a problem from before!\nTruly the horseback riding technique of gods and horses. It was flexible and quick as if the knight and the horse were one.\nBut the power of numbers can't win!\nA green aura flying from somewhere. It hit Stallion's fourth shinbone which he avoided in response even from all sides.\n- Hee hee!\nThe Stallion which almost collapsed from the momentary impact kicked the ground without stopping the maneuver. It is Stallion who has barely made it to the safe zone but limps on one of his feet.\nAre you okay Stallion?\n- Hee hee hee!\nNo problem. The white divine beast still shows his fighting spirit and intends to fight alongside Leon.\nGo in.\n-Hee hee...!?\nWhat does it mean? Are you insulting me friend?\nDespite her gaze Leon did not change his judgment.\nThey're not good enough to deal with on the move. They're quite experienced.\nHe soothes an old comrade and strokes the nape of his neck. Stallion did not hide his resentful gaze but trusted his comrades' judgment.\nThe Black Orcs ridicule the Lion Heart King for stepping on the floor like that.\nYour pesky feet are blocked.\nA surprise attack aimed at horses thoroughly. These guys know how to deal with knights.\nIs it the hunting god's stealth and the shaman god's curse?\nOn the other hand Leon saw through the guys' secret techniques that he didn't feel until right before the attack.\nOrcs are combative beasts that prefer a head-to-head confrontation. The fact that they use the beast god's stealth technique or the shaman god's curse technique proves that they are veterans with a fairly practical personality.\nAnd that the dark-skinned orcs like himself were warlords who had been fighting demons to the death for the past two hundred years.\nThey're pretty bell-tasting guys.\nLeon looked around. In that short time I was surrounded.\nThe number is about fifty. All of them are black orcs seeing the speculation that feels like a presence.\nThe Black Orc Warriors said to be comparable to the Holy Grail Knights gathered to hunt down one Leon.\nLion Heart King. Your reputation has been heard on the other side of the continent.\nFor a very long time we waited for the day to fight you.\nEven if the demons didn't get caught on the way the last war would have been between you and us.\nThe Orcs generously displayed their divine power. They are also the warriors of the three gods of Orcs chosen by the gods.\nThe divine power generated by the fifty elite Black Orcs created such pressure that it weighed down even Leon's star iron armor.\nNow let's fight. A showdown between power and power!\nYou'll die before reaching the Great Khan!\nLeon raised the holy sword. The light of Goddess Ariana was focused on the golden holy sword.\nThose who will die soon are as good as their momentum.\n* * * *\n-thud! thud! thud! thud!\nfast.\nGoo Dae-seong the Holy Grail Knight of Life and Abundance has no words.\nTo be precise it was more like not being equipped with words worthy of the title of a Holy Grail Knight.\nIt is because his leaping step has far surpassed that of a blessed steed since awakening as a transcendental being.\nKoo Dae-seong! Go let's go together!\nDon't be in too much of a hurry!\nJaehyuk Kim and Soyeon Cheon. And the restraint came in at a speed so fast that the knights behind him could barely catch up.\nNo I'm sorry. I thought I had to hurry up and deal with it.\nWhoa... We're late but that's about it.\nJaehyuk stroked the panting horse and tried to relieve the fatigue of sprinting. that brief break. Soyeon comes forward.\nWhat we have to deal with is the sorcerer's champion and his idol. We plan a strategy... Ah damn it! Daeseong Koo!\nGoo Daeseong immediately raised the shield of the earth. The Earth Shield which has been reinforced many times since arriving on this battlefield. And he blocked the green flash fired at the knights from the front.\nWhoa...! You don't give me a break!\nGokrok's Tower their target of destruction. It watched them with a wide field of vision and fired destructive flashes from time to time.\nThe Grail Knight class can defend against this attack. But to completely block it——!\nWe need the way Leon weakened the power of the flash. And it was Cheon So-yeon who exceeded expectations and cut the green flash.\nHoly Demon Sword——\nHer sword cuts the flash fired from Gokrok's tower. Like Han Hari she is rarely blessed by the two gods so the amount of her holy power is large.\nAriana's sword of light absorbs the light focused on the flash and Ventasis' sword of darkness cuts the weakened flash.\nThanks to this Goo Dae-seong was able to shake off the flash without too much difficulty.\nOh~ There were not only the Holy Grail Knights but there were also decent guys.\nAnd Maghar the champion of the Orc shaman god appears.\nHe greeted them with over ten Boulderface golems and thousands of Orc warriors.\nNo one really came from Lionheart.\nMaghar. This gnome who had assisted the great khan and hunted demons for over two hundred years looked with contempt at the young knights composed entirely of earthlings.\n“Do you think you will be my opponents? Fake knights who have just become knights will you deal with this Maghar?”\nIgnoring it even outright. However there were some who thought that was the right thing to say so the Naju Knights had no choice but to shrink.\nIsn't the opponent a monster who lived in the same era as Leon?\nno.\nHowever it was the ‘ordinary man' who stood at the forefront of them and refuted the contempt sent by the champion of the shaman god perhaps the least self-esteem in this place.\nWe don't need your evaluation.\nHoly Grail Knight Koo Dae-sung. A man who took the greatest step as a common man.\nHe doesn't flinch anymore. I just silently... and honestly took a step forward.",

      "content": "Lionheart vs Orc (7)\nHit it buy some time.\nHelcan's warriors. They are mighty warriors with the most strength and hefty power among Orcs.\nTheir ax skills chosen by the fighting god Helcan cut through iron and shattered armor.\n- Knock! Wow!\nThe holy sword splits the warriors' bodies in half. Faster than the ax they strike with brute force. As if he wasn't interested in a battle of strength and strength he slashed the ax with the hilt after exerting a blow with his whole body.\nnice···!\nfast. There is never a lack of power either.\nWhen it is necessary to split the leading warriors in half and knock them out in the disadvantage of one-on-one they definitely cut them off.\nPower and speed from overwhelming muscular strength. Destroys the stronghold of Black Orc warriors with pure strength.\nI can't believe it.\nEach of the Black Orc warriors of Helkan Tusin are warriors of reversal. They are the strongest Orc warriors who fought against Lionheart's Holy Grail Knights in the past.\nSuch monsters became stronger through the death struggle in the demon realm. Even so... the unbelievable sight of the Black Orc warriors being crushed. however······.\nShut up tin can.\nEven if one arm was severed and the whole body was crushed the blow of the ax was lowered. The fighting spirit that the indomitable warriors wield until the brink of death shatters the armor of the Lion Heart King.\nbloke···!\nThat fighting spirit the King of Knights does not acknowledge. As if to further protest against this the hunters of the hunting god cast their nets.\nStop moving!\nThe Orc Huntsman's net is a dense and strong net that can capture even the largest monsters. The net which even received the protection of Skunic is so strong and sharp that even the power of the monster cannot escape and the more it struggles the more it gets hurt.\n·······.\nIt's stopped on its feet! Shoot!\nBefore long a large number of explosive javelins were fired. The collective javelin of the black orc hunters who melted the Great Old One Belluza explodes right in front of their noses.\nIt won't end safely...!?\n-Go oh oh oh!\nThe expressions of the Black Orc warriors are distorted. For those who are born warriors and fearless to think that there would be a monster in the midst of such an explosion.\nIs this just it?\nA masterpiece newly completed by the Iron Grail Knights of this era. The armor made Leon immortal.\nEven more the star iron armor which is strengthened as the divine protection and holy power increases maximizes its characteristics when worn by the lion heart.\nIn doing so he became an unscathed immortal. That's why the arrogance of ignoring a few desperate attacks from the enemy is allowed.\nNow it's my turn.\nAs if the overwhelming power so far hadn't been an attack Lion Heart King's gestures were directed at the orcs. As if punishing the arrogant saint wields the power of God with his hand gestures.\n< Sky Spear >\nA giant in the crown of thunder above the clouds. He is ready to punish for his deputy from the beginning.\n[Fry to death worms.]\n-Quarreung! Kwak!\nA spear of thunder that strikes vertically. It struck the orcs right in the middle without even having time to admit it.\n-Quaaaaaang!\nAt the moment of the dizzying collision Leon witnessed that the spears thrown by the orcs absorbed the lightning.\nIs it a lightning rod? It's not like using your head.\nChuck this isn't the first time I've fought you tin cans.\nBlack Orc Great Warrior Bultan laughed fiercely and said.\n“The shamans are ready too.”\nhmm?\nBlack Orc shamans who have been hiding in the rear so far and operating out of Leon's sight. Their enormous power is directed at the Orcs on the front lines.\n< Strengthen the main focus - Gokrok's Gaze >\n< Strengthening Main Power – Helcan’s Big Arm >\n< Strengthen the main power - Skunik's Clan >\nThe mighty power of the Orc Champions. It is given to all Black Orcs.\nAn enormous power beam enormous strength and even quick feet. The results of that reinforcement were great.\n·······!?\nLeon who swung his sword at the rushing Buddha missed the timing due to his unusually fast movement.\nYou're slow!\nA fireball that catches back in an instant. The ax he wielded hit Leon's back.\nSuck!\nI swung my sword to block it at the moment but I was pushed back by the monstrous power of the fire that was much stronger than before and scratched the floor.\nIt's here!\nA charging black orc hunter. Running with the wild boar he crashed into Leon with ferocious momentum.\nTo smell like a beast! It's rude!\nLeon immediately slammed his fist into the boar's head piercing the heart of the orc hunter as he fell forward.\nHowever the Orcs made the most of the moment when their people died.\n< Helcan's Big Hand - Great Strike >\n< Helcan's Big Hand - Maximum Strength Enhancement >\nHelkhan's great warriors Bultan and Grokhan. Their axes hit the Lion Heart King all at once. Leon quickly blocked it but the orcs suppressed Leon with their brute force.\n-thud!\none of his knees is down It was the first time ever.\nKeukkeu...! Now that we use the power of the gods we overwhelm you!\nThe momentum of the Black Orcs was so frightening that they could say such arrogant things.\nAn explosive physical rise as if each of the Orc Warriors used the Holy Grail Knights' Divine Advent. Leon noticed that it was an expedient of the Orc shaman.\n‘Is it a time-limited Divine Advent?'\nYou really don't care for your life.\nThe Black Orcs increased their momentum and pressed Leon from all sides.\nThe Orcs had the mighty power of Helcan and the footwork of Skunik and even poured the mighty firepower of Gokrok.\nA devastating combination of Black Orc warriors that would overwhelm even the demon archduke. that······.\nYou blocked everything?!\nA monster this guy!\nIt was Orcs not Leon who accumulated hundreds of consecutive battle damages.\n‘I've already been hit by seven.'\n‘The remaining brothers are now under thirty.;\nAs time passed the attack power of the orcs decreased and their margins widened.\nBulltan met Grokhan's gaze and nodded as if he had agreed.\nLionheart...!\nGrokan shouted. His roar was enough to get the Lion Heart King's attention.\nNow stop dying!\nGrokhan showed a presence that could not be ignored and charged at the Lion Heart King. Leon is not merciful enough to let go of that straight charge.\n- Fu-wook!\nLeon stabbing Grokhan's heart. But at the same time-\n·······?!\nGrokan grabs Leon while stabbing the foreman with a bang. Leon tried to escape from its grasp but it was not easy to escape from the Black Orc warrior who gave his life.\nDaejeonsa burnt! Following the brother's footsteps!\nBurns grabbed Leon from behind. Of course it was even harder for Leon to escape.\nGreat Warrior Garham! For the glory of Helkan!\nGreat Warrior Falvatar! I will dedicate myself to Skunik!\nBlack Orc warriors flocking from all directions. Their divine power runs out of control and vast power is concentrated in the terrain.\nDie Lord of the cans. Your legend will end in our hands.\nThe sorcerers of the shaman god gathered their overflowing divine power into one. A huge amount of divine power they couldn't handle. The convergence of divine power overflowing in minutes causes an explosion from within.\nA life-threatening linkage of veteran warriors using divine power. Against this-\nOpening of the holy sword.\nStarlight converges in golden color.\n* * * *\n-Fleet damage repair completed. restart the system.\nThe duke-class all-weather final armament began to fly for its mission while recovering damage to the ship.\nNaturally as this all-weather armament took the form of a space battleship he headed towards the statue of Helcan faster than anyone else and upon noticing the approach Helkan's spiritual body reached out toward the duke-class.\nHuh? Up danger...!\nSuho who saw the asteroid being smashed by that punch was horrified but he had no time to pay attention to the violent movement of the battleship.\n- Avoidance pattern 137. Emergency avoidance mode. Thrust deflection nozzle at maximum open.\nThe duke class who makes sudden evasive maneuvers in an instant. Like a desert hare escaping from the clutches of an eagle in a dive it evades Helcan's clutches by making a sudden change of direction and an acrobatic 780-degree turn.\nAaaaaagh!\nSir Yapi! Driving! Driving please...!\nThe knights on board complained of pain from the overwhelming Frenzy of G but the Iron Grail knight lightly ignored it.\n- Posture control success. Moebius-class main gun deployment.\nThe main gun of the attack satellite attached to the Duke class. It poured charged particle cannons of destruction toward the statue that summoned Helcan's spiritual body.\n-Quaaaa!\nIn addition hundreds of missiles loaded on battleships. The statue crackles and collapses from the merciless bombardment.\n-Kooung!\n[The statue of Helcan has fallen. The summoning of the spiritual body is stopped.]\nOh oh···!\nYou did it in one go!\nAs expected Sir Yapi!\nThe inside of the ship was stained with the gruesome sight of the knights who committed obite but the fact that they succeeded in defeating the statue announced in the system message took priority over their vomiting.\n-Kick! Urgent movement towards the next target──\nthis guy···!\nThen thump! And something collides with the Duke class. The duke-class shattered by the shock so intense rolled across the concrete floor of the city.\n-Severe damage. armed ejection sequence. Conduct pilot and payload landings.\nYapi urgently landed its payloads. One of the knights of the pantheon including Han Su-ho. They are well-trained knights so even in this difficult situation they are straight into formation.\nThose who can't speak join the square for now! The guys on horseback line up left and right! Orcs are coming!\nHan Su-ho couldn't get his comrades out and encouraged his summer colleagues to do self-defense. And... I noticed a being with a huge presence approaching.\n[Helkan's champion Balbaza roars.]\n-WHAAAAAAAAAAA──!!\nBalbaza the champion of Orc Avatar Helcan. Having crushed the Duke's class in a single blow he took his hand-held men and rushed towards the half-destroyed Duke's class.\nChampion... Sir Yapi is there a way?\n- The time has come to prove the excellence of this machine.\nA shadow emerges from the cockpit. The pilot Yafi landed on the roof of a building.\n-Kick!\nWhat are you?\nValbaza stared at the mechanical spider looking down at him from the rooftop.\nToo small and dainty size to be a warrior. However knowing that it was the Holy Grail Knight of the famous pantheon Balbaza burned his fighting spirit.\n- Balbaza the champion of Orc Avatar Helcan.\nHey do you know my name?\nYapi analyzed the situation. Their allies are 30 Manshinjeon knights including Han Soo-ho. For the armament to be mounted on the Duke class there are not so many troops.\nOn the other hand the opponent only sees hundreds of things in front of his eyes. That number will increase in the future.\nTherefore Seung-gi is to take down the Orc champion Balbaza and pour overwhelming firepower into the enemy army. To do that you have to deal with Balbaza first.\nHowever how to take out and defeat only Balbaza in this war situation?\nYacht Spinner a wise and superior strong AI knew very well the mentality of these inferior organisms.\nso-\n-A straight call?\nwhat?\n-Are you scared? crap. crap. One-on-one a dog heojeop who runs away in fear.\nThis this guy...!\nBalbaza kicked off the ground and jumped up. Barbaza approached in an instant with its tremendous leaping power. Yapi ran up the roof and started to run away.\n- I'll follow you.\nYes I will kill you!\nBalbaza began to run across the city rooftops in pursuit of Yapi.\n* * * *\nBalbaza came over nicely at Yapi's provocation.\nWhen the distance was wide enough Balbaza who had finally caught up swung an ax at Yapi's slender carapace.\nthud! And the building collapses with a roar. Among the rubble Yapi jumped swiftly and landed in a plaza.\n-Kick!\nHmph! I heard you're an Iron Grail Knight but it's all about running away!\n-what.\nYapi's camera children stared at Balbaza and surveyed the surrounding battlefield.\nThe distance is wide enough and the location is suitable. Even Balbaza didn't know that intention.\nKeukkeukugh...! This must be an attempt to isolate me and defeat me one-on-one. Well that's not a bad method.\nEven Balbaza was not unaware of Yapi's intentions. However he radiated the swelling power of Helcan and heated up his speculation.\nYour plan presupposes that it is possible to defeat me.\n-·······.\nYapi did an objective power analysis by observing the clear rising spirit of Balbaza.\nIndeed the level of the Holy Grail Knight. No an eruption of power like that is more than just a decent Holy Grail Knight.\nSignificantly different from the Barbaza that was observed at Zereah's relic evacuation gate in the past. If Yafi had been herself in the beginning she would have calculated an obvious defeat.\n-Kick! Duke class all-weather final armament sequence activated.\nIf you were your past self.\n- Tung! Tung! Tung!\nIt was fired from a battleship that must have been half destroyed.\nDuke-class all-weather final armament. It takes the form of a space battleship so it seems that this is the true face of this final armament but that is not true.\n-This machine is the Holy Grail Knight of Iron and Blacksmith.\nHey hey profit! The flying container box dismantled while scattering spray sounds and something appeared one after another.\n- An existence that evolves develops and augments endlessly.\nIt was an innumerable armed forces.\nSupport Armament - Baron-class land fire support weapon.\nSupport Armament - Air Mobility Bomber Viscount Class.\nWar Armed Forces – Electromobile Special War Weapon Count class.\nDecisive Armed Forces – Marquis class land-based firepower decisive battle weapon.\nThe following 12 types of all-purpose armed systems are fully set.\nIntegrated armed platform force deployment. All Weapon Free.\nIn addition to this there are dozens of special weapons developed for the purpose of Yapi's dedicated connection and prepared to respond to dozens of combat situations. There······.\nFinal armament – ??All-around combat support system control weapon duke-class.\nThis is the Duke class. An all-weather ultimate weapon that responds universally in all situations.\n- Today's Bongi is stronger than yesterday's Bongi.\nWith this infinite blacksmith's grace the Iron Grail Knight overthrows the savage beast.",

When I tore the demons to pieces and drank their blood where were you and what did you do?\nThe history of the fight is different. In that intense struggle Barbaza has been active as a champion of fighting spirit.\n“Even those fancy gloves break if you press them down three times.”\n- Kwajik!\nGloves get crushed. It will be disintegrated by the blow of an ax beyond its limit.\n-Emergency ejection.\nThe emergency ejection device in the cockpit activates and Yaffy's small body ejects from the Count-class aircraft. It is another count class weapon that accepts the body of such a yappy.\n-Cockpit open. pilot mounted.\n- Operation of electric motorized special war weapons.\nI broke one at most and then another. Val Baza slapped his ax over his shoulder stomping on the armament of his crushed foe.\nKeukkeuk there are a lot of them.\nIgnoring his taunts Yafi linked up with the former commander.\nI moved one by one to make the most of the output of the sacred reactor that makes my body move but the enemy's destructive power far exceeds my strong artificial intelligence's ability to judge.\nthen.\n-All Weapon Link.\nAll armaments share the power of Yapi's Sacred Reactor. Yacht Spinner's battle program for the great Grail Knight's decisive battle that has been constantly evolving and developing.\n- Arrangement of land fire support weapon formations.\n-Airborne bomber weapons mid-low altitude firepower projection standby.\nA number of baron-level and viscount-level support armaments. The 5th Earl class and the Marquis class the Beast of Ruin who had been holding their breath to reduce energy waste until now move the huge body.\n- Byeolcheol weapon full set.\n-Integrated Commander Yakt Spinner. Connection with Duke class all-weather final armament auxiliary operation program. Synchronization complete.\n- Full armed maximum combat efficiency anti-personnel destruction program commenced.\nIt is difficult even for Yapi's new nuclear reactor to mobilize war armaments each of which has high firepower and high output at the same time.\nTherefore this power deployment is limited to 5 minutes. Even Balbaza couldn't help but admire the tremendous momentum.\nCome! I'm Barbaza the champion of the Avatar Helcan!\n-Baron-class high mobility special exoskeleton armament Mk.3 deployment.\nAndroid-type weapons using large-caliber special rifles advance while shooting at Balbaza.\nBelieving in the armor's defensive power Balbaza jumped in and tried to swing his ax through the Mk.3's fire.\n- Enemy Approach. 2nd bayonet deployment. Corresponds with single molecule cutter.\n-3rd 4th and 5th beongi maintain the network after widening the distance.\nTwo Mk.3s face the Valbaza with rifles equipped with bayonets. The moment the bayonet touched the axe it was pushed back by force but another bayonet pierced Balbaza's chest armor.\nIt's funny...?!\n-Initiation of single molecule cutter material decomposition.\nSuddenly a creepy sound scrapes the armor. At the molecular level thin blades cut through the binding molecules of the armor.\nThe monomolecular cutter which was completed through molecular unit design and structural combination of star iron theoretically does not wear out even if it cuts everything.\nThis guy...!\nBarbaza grabs the Mk.3 with the monomolecular cutter and activates Helcan's Big Hand as it is. Its limitless strength rips off an arm in an instant and an ax cuts the Mk.3 into pieces.\n- Ally damage reduction. Baron-class heavy armored multi-legged 1800mm railgun shelling.\nA high-powered railgun fired while the other Mk. Barbaza evaded it like a beast but only the passing railgun hurt him here and there.\nLike a flying fly...!\n< Helkhan's big feet. >\nIn an instant based on the divine power of Balbaza a giant foot-shaped spiritual body slams down from the air. It's not at the level of the spiritual body reproduced by Helcan's idol but the destructive power of the spiritual body that only materializes the feet can destroy the city.\n- Quaang!\nA shock wave that looks like a nuclear explosion. While star iron is crushed only by the shock wave Yappi does not stop calculating.\nUnified command link for use of all weapons. In the combat program to fight against the Holy Grail Knights it was premised that it would always withstand an impact that exceeded nuclear weapons.\n- Awareness-class high-fire bomber weapons before the firepower projection.\nA treasured fire support weapon. Even Balbaza was tired of it at this point and the continuous firepower projection broke the entire area.\nBig...!\nThe beast is the first to withdraw. But that is exactly what Yapi wanted.\n-Marquis class 680mm star iron gun SET.\nThe strongest weapon that destroyed even the Great Old Ones in one blow.\n- Stop this too.\nBoom! Goosebumps take away the sound of the world. No to be precise it was more like having my ears paralyzed by a terrible roar.\nA land-based decisive weapon Marquis class. Balbaza felt the end in front of the 680mm star iron shell fired by the Yacht Spinner's largest decisive battle armament.\nthis guy···!\n──The fighter of Helcan.\nAn explosion goes off.\nThe star iron shell is not a bomb but a high-speed armor-piercing bullet of pure physical force. Enormous dust and explosions are simply by-products of shockwaves created by shells of overwhelming destructive power penetrating the city's basement.\n- Thermal image detection mode. Infrared sensing mode simultaneous setup. Energy observation mode.\nIt operates a triple observation system and does not miss the enemy's movement. Yapi found a moving figure in the dust and all the weapons poured firepower without hesitation.\nEven the Baron class who can barely move their armament the Viscount class who still have missiles and cannonballs left and the Count and Marquis class pour their full energy.\nUntil this terrain disappears.\nArmed to the limit like that. The calculation of strong artificial intelligence recommends that further firepower projection be stopped here.\n- Armament consumption rate 75%. Recommendation to discontinue combat protocol.\nHe poured so much firepower into it. Armed cooling is also limited and it cannot handle the consumption rate. but······.\n-Rejection of recommendation. Compulsory combat continuation of the integrated commander.\nYakt Spinner who has 1000 years of combat experience has countless battle data accumulated through experience and knowledge.\nHe is an iron war weapon that has been able to defend against evil jewels for a thousand years without spilling them out.\nHowever even for such a Yakt spinner the experience of the last two years or so makes the existing data useless.\n“To Lionheart...! Have glory!!」\nUsers of unconventional concepts. The appearance of the Holy Grail Guardian who violates the Holy Law and physical force—\ngo away.\nThe abilities of superhumans that apparently go beyond the limits of living things.\nYes the advent of the superhuman Holy Grail Knight changed everything.\nIt fires and shoots light alone demonstrates physical abilities that violate the limits of living things and causes miracles with unbelievable tenacious vitality.\nYakt Spinner's combat theory learned there was simple.\n-Overkilling. Even if you die kill more and kill until the end.\nYapi's power comes from great technology and infinite resources.\nSince he does not have the transcendent eccentricity of the Holy Grail Knights Yapi decided that the only correct answer was to pour inexhaustible firepower.\nIt is a very precise judgment made by the machine. but······.\nChorae cholae pouring memes from a distance!\nThe existence of God's agent goes beyond even the irrationally excessive response of strong artificial intelligence.\nDespite shedding blood in ruthless conversational power his momentum does not diminish at all. It was after countless war weapons were destroyed and even the Marquis-class decisive battle weapon was sunk when he realized that it was a force comparable to the ‘atmospheric' Divine Advent he had seen in the fight against Rakshaar.\nHow many more are left scrap metal!\nThe opponent is a fighter with overwhelming strength and speed that does not require any calculations. It is close to impossible to confront it with force from the front.\n- respond.\nThe biggest advantage of Yakt Spinner. It has infinite amounts and countless types of power.\nAn armament capable of responding to any number of cases exerts great power in itself.\n- Count-class short-term battle type electromobility special war weapons conclusion. full throttling.\n·······!?\nIt binds to the sacred reactor and scatters its output attacking Valbaja at a speed beyond the perception of living things.\nIn the past when Yapi was protecting the city. A close combat weapon that had to be selected due to lack of ammunition inventory and resources.\nwire?\nThe instantaneous acceleration spun the wire in all directions while traveling at a speed that even the Holy Grail Knight could not perceive.\n- Tactical tactics. heavenly hope.\nCut the city with wire. Buildings are cut and the air splits.\nThe collaboration of overwhelming speed and wire made of special iron being whipped like a whip is eerie and dizzying.\nHa ha ha...! It's still not enough!\n< Helkhan's big hand. >\nThe wire grazed his entire body his armor shattered and his arms outstretched while blood spattered.\nIt grabbed the wire that was about to slice itself into hundreds of cubes and the palm that was supposed to be cut like tofu grabbed the rather tough wire and pulled it towards itself.\n-······!\nThe ax cuts the armament. It was a count class that had tremendous speed like a fighter jet but its armor was weak in proportion to its attack power and speed.\n-Emergency ejection!\nAs soon as he escaped the count was split in two. And Yapi boarding the new count class.\n-Equipped with GK-P parts for Daeseong Baegi Land Control Weapon.\nA huge unbalanced fist rushes towards Balbaza. The thrust generated by the ultra-heavy-armored count's energy injection nozzle completes the Mach 13 Fist of Destruction.\nKhaha...!\nBarbaza confronts this with a fist as if showing off. The savage punches that maximally demonstrated the power of Helcan's big hands face off against the rocket punches of technology.\n- Boom!\nA major collision in which the terrain is torn apart with only a shock wave. The winner was Barbaza.\nIf you have nothing more to show die!\nThe ax of Balbaza being swung. An ax imbued with the divine power of Helcan cuts through anything.\nhmm!?\nBut sooner than that. Yafi getting out of it. Balbaza was dumbfounded when he saw the yappy ejected through the cockpit.\nYou're quick to run away!\nThere are no additional armaments now. Just destroy that weak-looking fuselage and you're done.\n- Complete energy supply. threshold max.\nHowever a flash of light shines from the weapon that is about to be destroyed. By the time I realized that it was spun from the weapon itself it was already too late.\nYou bastard...!\nbig explosion. The reason why I boarded the cockpit was to supply direct energy through the sacred nuclear reactor.\nAlthough the explosive power is small it is a poisonous substance rather than a bomb because it emits a deadly substance. And that material is none other than divine power.\n-Completed dispensing of priest Beatrice's fog of death. Confirm the rapid consumption of the enemy's divine power.\nUsers of the concept of God's agent. Therefore he has no choice but to be a demon or use the same divine power to counter that power.\nArtifacts that Beatrice has consistently mass-produced contain her sexual methods and scatter them like a biochemical warfare.\nHer ability which is specialized in mass destruction above all else is embodied in Yappi as a mass-produced weapon.\n- Equipped with the last armament. gender expression.\nCountless armaments were broken. But that's why this final armament is meaningful.\n[Go my blacksmith. This heto is with you.]\n-Sacred Advent < Noble Machine >\nHoly power explodes. Under the permission of Heto the god of iron and blacksmiths the iron knight descends into his body.\nOriginally even living saints and saints would have to risk their lives. However for yakt spinners this risk can be reduced.\nNow he and she have the bodies of saints created by the gods.\nIf you abandon this machine body and transfer your body you can create a machine body again with a living body.\n- Strategic Law. duke-class combination. Marquess Count Viscount and Baron ranks.\nThe Holy Grail Knight of Iron and Blacksmith. Its authority has all the correction effects for iron and blooms as a blacksmith.\nHowever what blacksmith would be able to instantly combine the remnants of armament in a tense battlefield?\nA miracle that is only possible because of super strong artificial intelligence that can calculate even the end of the history of the universe in an instant.\n-Last Weapon. vs. Leon Dragonia Lionheart Battle Specs < Golden Knight >\nA great golden light flashes. Surprisingly this decisive battle armed with the strength of all armed forces carries only one sword not guns cannons or bombs.\nBalbaza was momentarily mesmerized by that beautiful knight-like sight.\nA sword...! What an interesting machine!\nAnd speculation boils over. Intuitively. That this ridiculous tin robot might be my greatest enemy in my life as a fighter.\n[Even if there is no risk of nova whether the fuselage can withstand the output is another matter. It should be done quickly.]\nTo Heto's concern about his agent the mechanical Holy Grail Knight answered without hesitation.\n- Cheap.\nhold the sword Imitating the most exemplary knights in the database wield only once.\nLet's see the end tin can!!\nA beast of commitment that attacks with an axe. Against this the golden knight serenely held the sword with both hands.\nMost of the golden knight's energy is focused on the formed golden ‘sacred sword'.\nThe colorful armor is an absolute defense glove formed to withstand the recoil of a sword swung just once.\nI bet everything on this blow.\n──The ax of fighting spirit.\n──Reappearance of the Holy Sword\nA blinding flash spread across the city and everyone saw it.\nA shocking scene where 10 seconds felt like a year. As the flash subsided the figures of warriors and knights began to appear.\n-·······.\nCrushing armor. Even withstanding the recoil the aftermath shattered even the star-steel body. Yapi slipped and fell from the shattered Golden Knight.\nThe cracked bridge is unable to raise the fuselage and the sacred reactor which boasts infinite output is in danger as if it will go out.\n-Kis... Look!\nYafi looked up at the beast with her camera eye.\nKuhuhh...!\nBalbaza looked down at Yapi. He was the one fighter who fought with him to the end.\nI······.\nWith a voice that even seemed cool somewhere—\nlost.\nA great fighter has fallen.\nIt was Yapi's victory.",

Quaang!\nBuildings collapse with hammer strikes and craters dent with kicks.\nThe existence of a city is collapsing in real time in front of the massive violence wielded by the Holy Grail Knight of life and abundance.\n‘Strong. I heard you're new to Holy Grail Knights.'\nAt first the mag'har did not think much of the new grail knight.\nJust as the Orc Champions are legendary warriors in history the Holy Grail Knights are also superhumans representing the times.\nTheir awakening is formed through long training and quests so they knew that one Holy Grail Knight would reign as the saint of the kingdom for a long time.\nThe Holy Grail Knight is such an existence.\nA hero recognized even by the gods after proving his long training and discipline.\nIt is not at the level of a hero of the era but from generation to generation ordinary farmers say that the main character in a story that can only be seen in a fairy tale book of a great-grandfather's childhood is a saint who is still alive in that era.\nFor this reason Holy Grail Knights are regarded by farmers as agents of God and to knights they are knights among knights in a far-high position.\nWill such a being appear within a year or two? The Mag'har shook his head.\nThe existence of the Holy Grail Knight could not be easily revealed. He became a Holy Grail Knight through an expedient method.\nThere was no way he could be on the same level as the nemesis that his ancestors had fiercely fought against.\nImmature!\nBroken buildings the remains of buildings are gathered together. The pouring piles of garbage poured toward Gu Dae-seong.\nSuck...!\nGoo Dae-seong evades it by running through the city with his bare legs. I tried to penetrate through it with overwhelming defense power but it is not easy to break through if thousands of tons of scrap metal blocks it.\nNumerous scrap metals that Maghar moves by applying golem combining techniques give the illusion that the gravity of this world has been reversed.\nAnnoying...!\nA hammer that blows it all at once. This great holy relic left behind by Holy Grail Knight Geobrick concentrates the user's holy power and transforms it into huge destructive power.\nBoom! Thousands of tons of scrap metal scattered all at once. Koo Dae-seong finally secured an advance route but—\n-Go oh oh...!\n‘come!'\nAnd beyond the view obscured by a pile of scrap metal. An eerie beam of light pours down.\nGokrok's Tower. The destructive ray shot from that sad gaze strikes Goo Dae-seong. He doesn't have the agility to dodge this beam.\nshit!\nOnce again block with the earth shield. To withstand the destructive rays that melt just by touching them with infinite vitality.\nMiss Soyeon!\nDon't mess with the angle!\nWhile Goo Dae-seong endured the holy sword with the holy power of light scattered the intensity of the beam.\nA leader-level knight who can control the nature of light coming from the limit of light rays and withstand the firepower that melts flesh just by approaching... Only Cheon So-yeon can offset this attack.\nJaehyuk Kim!\nI'm getting ready!\n< Ultima's Wrath >\nThe thunder spear the holy relic left by the Holy Grail Knight induced the lightning that fell precisely toward Maghar.\n-Quarreung! Kwak!\nSpectacular explosions light up the sky over the city. But everyone intuited that it was not the end.\n────!!\nSomething springing up from the ground.\nSomething huge is about to be completed with an earthquake-like echo.\nUh uh...!\nKim Jae-hyeok who tries to stop it before it is completed by pouring out the sex law. However even consecutive lightning bolts cannot stop its completion.\nIt's already too late fakes! See the feast of Maghar the great shaman of the Orcs who succeeds Master!\nCrushing urban concrete floors.\nIt is so heavy that it swallows buildings and their remains revealing a massive monstrosity.\nThat that's at Shanhaiguan...!\nThe knights in perplexity and bewilderment are astonished and evoke memories.\nA super-giant golem created by combining numerous large rock faces in Shanhaiguan. Certainly the construction design is not different from that but it is even more gigantic... far away.\n[Look this is my season. In front of this greatness you will be trampled like worms!]\nThe giant who piles up even crushed asphalt roads and cars like shoes is truly a monster.\nThe apotheosis of a city that would have been like this in the age of mythology.\nConsidering that the golems of the orcs basically only use large and heavy things that stand out around them as materials a modern city might be a place where the supply of materials is easier than that of the front lines.\nEven more so when it comes to Gokrok's champion Maghar the main force as its representative is inexhaustible itself.\nCreativity aside its destructive power is absolute in that it creates an ignorantly gigantic building golem.\nBecause being big is violence in itself.\nHeavyweight isn't at this level?!\nAvoid the time to discuss such things!\nThe giant building golem raises its fist. A strange phenomenon in which a heavy weight creates a storm just by being swung around. The moment it strikes a shockwave spreads enough to destroy even a large unit.\nBig...!\nA human-sized person is easily bounced off by the shockwave. It's not the physical strength that can lead to damage but the fact that it's difficult to maintain a posture is a huge minus for a knight.\nLet's break it down...!\nIn the meantime Goo Dae-sung endured by entangling himself with the roots he had grown from the ground. It is possible because everything in the earth protects and protects him.\nThe roots of the trees grown by the Castle of Abundance barely supported his body and Goo Dae-seong was able to finish preparing for a counterattack.\n- Kwak!\nDestructive hammering. Even the Archdemon's head explodes in one blow and the blow strikes the golem's fist.\n- Kwajijik!\nAnd the golem's fist that shatters helplessly. The strength is not strong perhaps because the waste was collected here and there. but······.\nreunion?!\nRemnants that are instantly combined by Maghar's divine power. The mag'har wielding a staff atop the golem let out a loud laugh.\n[no use! Even that fireman can't destroy this golem in one shot! It is impossible with you fakes!]\nAt Maghar's declaration Cheon So-yeon clicked her tongue and narrowed her eyes.\nFake fake... noisy.\n“Well our jjamba is a bit short.”\nThey know. Although he started as a cadet at his academy and had Leon's unconventional teachings he thought he had become quite strong when he was appointed as a knight.\nHowever when Leon returned from the Pandemonium with Vulcanus and the Burning Sword Knights they realized that their strength was on a different ‘dimensional' compared to them.\nIndividual armed forces collective fighting power... belief in God.\nMaybe that's a gap that won't close. The climate in which they grew up makes it natural for them to be close to the gods and consider honor and loyalty as virtues.\nCompared to them what they lack is an undeniable fact.\nBut why are the Orc beasts arguing over us?\n“I rarely agree.”\nAs Koo Dae-seong said they do not need the evaluation of orcs.\nOne thing they learned from the great King of Knights.\nDeserved rage against evil and orcs.\nlet's go.\nHoly Grail Knights take the lead. Goo Daeseong took Geobrick's hammer and earth shield and started walking toward the giant golem thousands of times.\nIs there a way? We don't know if it's an old Bible but we can't do it until we can't play it.\nI don't even know how to be so ignorant.\nA living saint perfect vitality. In particular Goo Dae-sung the Holy Grail Knight of Life might be able to fight infinitely.\nBut that's an effective fighting method only against low-ranking junkies. In an earth battle against a strong opponent of the same rank the seasoned side wins.\nWe have no choice but to go to a short-term battle. Even to reduce the burden on His Majesty.\nTheir goal is to destroy the idols of the Orc Gods who are bestowing mighty blessings on the Orcs.\nAbove all the tower of the sorcerer is pouring firepower that divides the city by repeating charging and diverging.\nGoo Dae-sung is receiving most of those attacks right now so if the target changes the allies will be in danger.\nI will go head-on. Miss So-yeon and Jae-hyeok please destroy the ‘strategic target'.\nBut Goo Dae-seong I'm the one-tool for firepower but if So-yeon isn't there how can I deflect that beam?\nI'll try to hold on somehow. The other Templars won't last long either. We need to make a decision quickly.\nTo do so Goo Dae-seong must take the biggest risk. But he is determined.\nEver since he undeservedly took on the job of being a Holy Grail Knight he was always prepared for it.\ngoing!\nGoo Dae-seong started running straight ahead. The Mag'har cast all sorts of magic upon him.\nCurse of Slowness Curse of Loss of Life Curse of Loss of Distance.\nWhile operating a golem that moves with divine power at the same time it focuses on blocking the movement of the Holy Grail Knight. Goo Dae-sung's body became heavy in real time and hindered his movement.\n[Beat and break it.]\nAnd when the slowdown was noticeable the golem's fist struck straight down. He would have been able to avoid it with the Holy Grail Knight's breakthrough power but the curse that binds him blocks it.\nshit···!\nA giant fist that strikes down. Its weight is indeed that of a building. Block it with the earth shield.\n[Keukkeuk did you become a jjabu?]\nThere is no way that a single individual could bear such a weight. It was when he thought Maghar had taken care of the Grail Knight.\n[Hmm?]\nThe golem's fist is heard. It was impossible. No matter how much a Holy Grail Knight is there is a limit to the strength of one's body and now that one is overcoming the weight of a single building!\nincomprehensible monstrosity. But the mag'har soon recognized the source of its power.\n[tree roots?]\nGiant tree roots growing from the city's underground. It is helping Goo Dae-seong push the golem's fist!\n[under···! You mean the Holy Grail Knight of Life!]\nThe mag'har immediately shot the curse's main force at the tree. A curse of decline that takes away life force. As a result the tree roots which boasted of strong fiber quickly die.\nNo way...!\nSeongbeop < Blessing of Growth >\nGoo Dae-seong's holy power against this. The Holy Grail Knight of Life which promises the growth and prosperity of all living things.\nAs long as he is in his place no weathering or decline can extinguish the tenacity of life.\nNow! Get out!\nGoo Dae-seong swung the hammer taking advantage of the space created by the tree roots. Boom! A golem's fist that scatters at once.\nIts weight is great but in the end it is nothing compared to polished steel as it is made of scrap metal.\n[no use!]\nMag'har's divine power reshapes the golem's fist. This time not a single solid fist but piles of scrap metal all at once poured into Goo Dae-seong.\nKeuh...! Something like this...!\ncan't hurt me It just obscures your vision a bit.\n‘for a moment? Is your vision blocked?'\nmomentary gap. Gokrok's tower manipulated by the Mag'har rains green beams.\nBig?!\nI blocked it with the Earth Shield but it was not something Goo Dae-seong could withstand.\nA beam of destruction that melts even the star armor of the Holy Grail Knight. If you are a knight who handles the magic of light as much as Cheon So-yeon you will be burned at the same time as you grow with the power of pure life.\nBig euuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!\nGoo Dae-sung raised one foot while desperately enduring the destructive power of the beam. Praying that the earth responds according to his will.\nDaeseongbeop < Spear of the Earth >\nSharp earth and sand welling up from the earth. The terrain that rose at his will was in the form of a sharp spear but its function was different from before.\n[Are you planning to change the terrain and use it as a shield? but···!]\n·······?!\nGoo Dae-seong instantly felt that his hands were empty. The wave of scrap metal that was so rampant that it obscured my vision snatched the hammer in my hand!\nthis···!\nInadvertently missed the weapon. Goo Dae-seong felt frustrated.\n「Kyung has no shortage of strength as a Holy Grail Knight but she lacks skill. It is too easily defeated by interpersonal warfare psychological warfare and trickery.”\nA warning that Karina gave while training herself. However Koo Dae-sung did not receive a passing grade from Karina.\nOf course my skills have improved. much more than before. Having received one-on-one lessons from a veteran Holy Grail Knight it can be said that his skills have improved significantly.\nbut······.\n‘It's not enough by the standard of a Holy Grail Knight! It's not even up to the level of the Holy Grail Knights.'\nOld age is still lacking. There was a vast gap in experience between his skills and those of the knights who represented the history of the Lionheart War.\nThis is probably why Maghar saw Goo Dae-seong and said it was fake.\n[What can you do without a hammer?]\nin his mockery. Koo Dae-seong chanted in the waves of scrap metal that made noise in his ears.\nfrom now on.\njust move on Losing a weapon doesn't change what you have to do.\n-Kwa kwa kwa kwak!\nHe pierced through the huge waves of scrap metal with only his shield at the forefront. The road ahead of him follows the route created by the Earth Spear and is straight forward.\n[Are you coming naked without a weapon! Fool!]\nMaghar unleashes countless curses and once again binds Goo Dae-seong's movements. If you go to a war of attrition this is your advantage. Besides since he lost his hammer he wouldn't be able to destroy the golem as easily as before.\nfrom now on···!\nBut even if the bridge is heavy even if thousands of tons of scrap metal block the way.\nEven if it is sold because it is fake.\nfrom now on!!\nOne thing he is confident that he can do that he can do better than anyone else.\n“But one thing is certain. Kyeong-eun you have guts.”\nForward oh oh oh oh!!\nJust moving forward with humility.\n[Such an ignorant bastard!]\nMaghar laughed at such simple ignorance and moved the golem. A fist from another arm instead of a fragmented arm.\nSmash him with this and crush him.\n[Shut up fake bastard...!]\nA fist weighing thousands of tons is swung toward Goo Dae-seong.\nIt's like a huge golem swinging its fist at an ant. Goo Dae-sung did not lose sight of his halfway posture.\nyet again!\nDaeseongbeop < Spear of the Earth >\nAt that moment a change in the terrain springs up from the ground. A spear that shoots in response to the earth itself. It penetrates the golem's torso.\n[······!]\nThe pierced spear of the earth blocks the golem. Fists can't reach in halfway posture.\nYaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nAnd in that gap Goo Dae-seong runs through the natural road that extends to the golem.\n[Huh... It's useless! If the destroyed parts are reunited it's enough——!?]\nIn an instant Maghar saw something that Gu Dae-seong was holding instead of a hammer.\ntree root.\nThe roots of the tree that grew by the power of his growth are in his hand.\n[this guy···! no way!]\nIt should be blocked. That was the Mag'har's instinct.\n-Quaaaaa!!\nThe ruins of the destroyed fists block Gu Dae-seong. On the spot it transforms into a mini golem... no it becomes a golem three times as large as a regular large rock golem and tries to block Goo Dae-seong.\nInterrupted!!\nGoo Dae-sung smashed it with his fist. As if there was no need to even hit with a hammer sometimes he would throw his entire body and smash it with a head-butt throwing a tattered shield of the earth and smashing the golem.\nIt seemed that he had no intention of relying on his hammer to become a Holy Grail Knight.\nhonestly forward.\n[Stop——!]\nThe Holy Grail Knight leaps forward. Superhuman leg strength shot him like a cannon ball. The place he headed was none other than the center of the half-destroyed golem.\nGoo Dae-sung punched the golem with his fist.\n- Goong!\nThe center of the golem which had been shattered in half by the Earth Spear was easily shattered. Inside the golem where so many scrap metals are gathered the only ‘life' digs in.\nSeongbeop < Blessing of Growth >\nAt that moment a tree started growing inside the golem in an instant.\nGrail Knight of Life The tree which was rapidly grown by pouring holy power grew from the inside without Maghar having time to deal with it and greenery even came out.\n[this···!]\nThe mag'har intuited that it was not a simple growth. In fact the golem's movement had stopped.\n[Did they take control of the inside with their roots!]\nTo get rid of this the entire golem would have to be re-dismantled and re-defected. And they have no intention of giving that gap.\nHoly Demon Sword.\n······!\nterrifying sound. The moment the sharp energy created by the holy sword and the demonic sword made Maghar chill the knight commander was already swinging his sword.\nCheon So-yeon makes a single leap by gathering as much spiritual power as possible from a nearby building. Her sword swings towards the cockpit of the golem protecting the Mag'har.\n[profit···!]\nIt was Maghar who urgently strengthened the defenses around me but the opponent was the knight commander who wielded the power of Ventasis the god of darkness and revenge.\nThe power of the Dark Magic Sword is simple. Absolute cutting that cuts through everything. In an instant that demonic sword cut through the golem's cockpit which was made of scrap metal.\nThe moment the cut metal and rocks fell off and Maghar's figure was captured Cheon So-yeon's holy sword stabbed Maghar.\n“The end——”\nDon't underestimate me kid!!\nGreen flashes pour from the mag'har's eyes. A power given to the champion of Gokrok. Gokrok's gaze.\nIf it's Krann or Murka it's a flash of destruction that can shoot down even a satellite in geostationary orbit but even a Maghar is enough to finish off a delicate knight in front of you.\nKuh...!\nHowever Cheon So-yeon also responded quickly. He hurriedly blocked Maghar's green flash with the light of the holy sword.\noh···!\nHowever he could not withstand the force received from the front and his dangerous posture collapsed.\nWhoa...!\nMaghar barely out of danger immediately tried to solve the root that had taken control of the golem. But then he suddenly realized that ‘one person' was nowhere to be seen.\n‘Where is the kid who can handle the power of thunder?'\n-Quarreung!\nAt the same time as feeling the horror the aura of the sky fluctuated. Golden thunder and lightning strikes somewhere along with dark clouds.\nYou bastard...!?\nbuilding across the street. On the opposite side of Cheon So-yeon the spearman was pulling the spear as hard as he could.\n‘Accompanied by a thunderclap that rattles from the window'.\nIt's raining it's raining. Ultima-nim please let my bamboo spear hit!\n[joy···! If you pray earnestly I the heaven will make it happen.]\nJoath! Trust me and shoot!\nThe next moment Kim Jae-hyeok throws his bow-like arm forward as hard as he can. The epic item he threw Ultima's Relic is thrown towards Maghar.\nKeuuugh...!\nWitnessing it the Mag'har had a gut feeling. that the spear would pierce him.\nMaghar who made an instant decision made one decision.\nDisperse!\nTo scatter the super-large golems united by divine power.\nHuh? What is that crazy thing!\nKim Jae-hyeok was taken aback by the sight of the giant golem scattering in an instant. As the golems scattered Maghar also fell but thanks to that the spear thrown by Jaehyeok passed Maghar.\nMistress! I missed the last hit!\nthen.\nOld man Goo Dae-seong!!\nSir Koo Dae-sung!!\nThe two knights call this. The Mag'har's eyes flashed.\nYou bastard...!\nA knight of life who throws himself at the falling mag'har. The mag'har grinned at the one leaping at him barefoot without a hammer or shield.\nOne step short fake!\nGreen divine energy gathers in his gaze. A situation where each other falls without a foothold in the air. Then as a shaman you have an overwhelming advantage!\nNo that's enough.\n·······?!\nAt that moment the mag'har saw. As long as he flies with countless revolving noises one hammer.\nthis guy···!\nA green beam is emitted.\nhammer strikes\nThe collision of the hammers which emit a flash of dark green and green green pushes each other's divine and holy powers and opposes each other.\nI... win!!\nA hammer blow that pushes back the flash.

      "content": "Lionheart vs Orc (10)\nCarina Dragonia is the Holy Grail Knight of Reversal.\nCompared to Leon or Vulcanus she became a Holy Grail Knight late.\nHowever if that's not to say that her military power was lacking compared to the Holy Grail Knights of the time that's not the case either.\nShe is the Grand Duke of Dragonia who has been transplanted with the heart of a dragon that is passed down through generations of the Grand Duke of Dragonia.\nSince she did not walk the path as a Holy Grail Knight she could only handle basic knowledge but her enormous magical power was sufficient even in confrontations with other Holy Grail Knights.\nThe advantage Dragon's Heart grants to its host is simple.\noverwhelming power. and Dragon Fear.\n- Kkwiik...!\nThe beasts stop. Orc Mountain Boars the core of the Orc Boar Riders were huge and violent enough to burn Orcs but they couldn't stand the pressure emanating from higher creatures.\nYour feet have stopped shoot.\nKarina did not miss that opportunity. The black dragon's pouring dress consumed the wild boars that stopped her.\nnice···!\nSkira the champion of Skunic once again bestowed blessings on the wild boars who did not listen to the Orc hunters but the boars were suppressed by Carina's energy rather than his blessings.\n‘If it was that young dragon there would be no problem. but···!'\nThe problem is that dragon in human form. Unlike the young dragons born through the world tree that was different.\nThe vessel that has held the dragon's heart for over 200 years is a being with a fragment of Dragonia the mythical great progenitor dragon.\n[Go wipe out those cheeky bastards who dared to injure the dragon's body!]\nEven Dragon God's agent. The Holy Grail Knight backed up by Dragonia the god of gold and contracts blesses all the dragons of this land and pours out mighty magic.\nUnless it was Dothrak Skira's old comrade who could be called the king of wild boars he would not be able to withstand the dragon god's agent.\nAbove all-\n- Crowra la la la la!!\ndragons run amok A breath from four dragons including the fallen black dragon flying in the sky. And each of them is a natural master of magic.\n‘If it continues like this it will be pushed! I have to come up with a countermeasure!'\nSkira wondered if she should step back and head for Skunik's great javelin.\nThe only ones who can throw that javelin are himself the champion of the orc hunting god Skunik or Great Khan Murka.\nThe javelin which the champion has to throw thanks to its powerful ability of passing is now only an ornament that scatters blessings without Skira.\n‘Back off! For now to the place where the javelin is located—-‘\nI apply for a duel with the great warrior!\n·······?!\n·······?!\nAt Karina's declaration Skyra as well as Orcs and Dragons stare at her. Carina announces her intention to duel putting her sword all the way to her scabbard.\ndog sound!\nSkyra gritted her teeth at Karina's request for a duel.\nAmong the Orcs duels between warriors are a sacred ritual. A fair means of proving strength to the Orcs who only pursue strong self-respect.\nIt is a well-known story that Orc Great Khan Murka has won duels with thousands of Orcs to keep his position as Great Khan.\nBut not those guys. Those Lionheart's canisters don't respect the rules and traditions of the Orcs.\nIf it's an orc aren't they the ones who just kill and watch? Are those guys asking for a duel?\nIf you don't believe me I'll make the dragons retreat.\nAs Carina beckoned the dragons began to flutter and retreat as if they had accepted an unspoken signal. The black dragon also flutters its torn wings and slowly retreats into the sky.\nAs the dragons each watched from the top of the building Carina shrugged.\nAre you still going to refuse? If so it's disappointing. A great orc champion refuses to fight one-on-one.\nthis guy······.\nSkira had a strong sense of pride but she couldn't help but feel the great charm of this great warrior duel.\nAfter they went to the Demon Realm Murka banned the duel between the great warriors to reduce the senseless consumption of their kind.\nI accepted it rationally but in other words it meant that there had been no rank shift among the Orcs for a long time.\nThat was dissatisfaction with the other Orcs and even Skira.\nFighting against the strong was the Orcs' best pastime.\n‘It's a handful! Don't go over!'\nSkira rejected it rationally but was fascinated by the instinctive attraction.\nThe strength of Lionheart's Tin Knights is widespread among Orcs across the continent.\nFor Orcs Lionheart is the enemy of the race. Among them Holy Grail Knights are great warriors equal to Orc Champions.\nHow many chances would there be for a one-on-one bloody battle with them?\nEspecially in the current era where the original Lionheart knights are almost wiped out this chance may be the last chance in Skira's life.\nKuh... that's good! I'll accept the Grand Master's duel!!\nIn the end he couldn't overcome the Orc's instinct.\nIt would have been absolutely impossible if Great Khan Murka Balak had been staring at it with both eyes open.\nHowever in this chaotic battlefield if you are alone...\nAs expected a great orc champion.\nKarina twisted the corners of her mouth as if her goal had worked.\nThen don't be shy with each other...!\nKarina spurred the road holding a magic sword. In response Skira raised her javelin and jumped away from Dothrak.\n- Boom!\nSkira started throwing the javelin she had brought at Karina.\nOrc hunters' javelins mainly use explosive javelins to hunt monsters but javelins do not have only such functions.\nJudo javelin and penetrating javelin. Being able to put various functions into a javelin is what makes a good orc hunter.\nhmm···?!\nKarina deflects the thrown javelin. However it surges toward Karina again adding an impossible trajectory correction. And that's not all.\n- Kwak Kwa Kwak!\nThe javelin disintegrates and splits into three short javelins that fly. A splitting javelin for killing multiple small game.\nYou're cliché...!\nKarina's magic sword shakes dark energy. The darkness that spreads in all directions disintegrates the javelin into thousands of pieces.\nA dark castle that applies the concept of cutting. Small spears cannot withstand this range suppressor.\nHa ha!\nSkyra stabbed the spear fiercely. A close combat fight. Karina effortlessly flicks her spear and swings her sword.\nkang! A sharp demonic sword that cuts off the hilt of a javelin. Karina smiled.\nIt's too soon Orc. This close combat is my domain. In close-quarters sword fights even His Majesty would back down on me.\n·······!?\nFierce sword strikes overwhelm Skira one after another. She tried to distance herself by defending with a javelin but Karina never gave up.\nChit...!\nSkira is a hunter who uses a javelin but is also a master of spearmanship. For Orcs melee weaponry is a basic skill. In a battle between spear and sword the advantage is obviously on Skira's side.\nAs such I tried to induce a mid-range fight by taking full advantage of the spear's tactical advantage but the opponent's footwork and offensive skills were too fast and skillful.\nIf you don't give me distance I have no choice but to do it by force.\nThe moment Karina who passed Skirana's javelin was about to dig in the javelin shone.\n······!\nThe javelin explodes at the nearest distance. The explosion as well as the smoke from the explosion obscured her vision.\n‘come!'\nThe other party's purpose is predictable. After accumulating damage to each other with explosions they widen their distance and engage in long-range combat.\nKarina prepared for the javelin that would soon break through the black fog.\n- Sasak!\nThrowing javelins rushing in the hidden field of vision. I want it to be a separate javelin but the weight of the sound is different.\nKarina swung her sword while calculating the weight and speed of the invisible javelin.\n- Kang!\nThe first javelin ricocheted\n- Kang!\nThe second javelin also bounces.\n······!\nAt that moment the unusual speed and weight pass through your senses. Karina blocked it with her sword blade.\n- Kwak!\nheavy. Carina's light body is pushed away as it scrapes the pavement. Heavy javelin type with penetrating magic. It is an item used to hunt monsters without getting hurt as much as possible.\nBut it's not for people!\nUnlike the dull monsters she is a Holy Grail Knight. The heavy throwing spear deflected from her skill.\nChit...!\nSkira and Karina were naturally placed in a confrontation. Karina who still has room and Skira whose javelin is running out.\nAn incident occurred that would determine the psychological gap.\n-Kwaaaaang!\n·······?!\n·······?!\nThe eyes of the Orcs including Skyra turned to one side. That's where Skunic's great javelin is. The dragons were pouring their breath there.\nWhat are you doing!!\nWhat are you talking about?\nAiming for a large javelin with dragons between duels!\nThe parties to the duel are only you and me. There is no reason to stop their actions.\nKarina shrugged shamelessly. She giggled with the two dragons remaining on top of the building for camouflage.\nBut you've already lost strategically Champion of Skunik. You orcs should have kept that.\nInomum...!\nSkyra was furious and concentrated all of Skunik's divine power on the remaining spear. At least one of the Holy Grail Knights has been defeated. Otherwise the balance won't fit.\nIt's a one-hit fight. Well I'll respond.\nKarina held the sword with both hands. The strongest swordsmanship in one blow. The holy power of Ventasis concentrated in the magic sword emits fierce energy.\nGreat Passing Javelin—-\nBrilliant Demonic Sword——\nAt the moment of collision the terrain splits with a bang. The moment they brushed each other the aftermath of the vast force colliding collapsed buildings and buildings in all directions.\nDamn it... such a difference...\nAnd it was Skyra who fell down. He looked back at Karina's demonic sword which cut his body in half and left a burning darkness in the wound.\n“I was the one who killed the champion of the former hunting god. It would be arrogant to think that the technique shown me twice would work.\nis it.\nAfter defeating Skira's champion Karina felt ferocious gazes focused on her from all directions.\nBlack Orc Hunters. They watched their captain lose the duel and they seemed stunned. but······.\nGo away human.\nIt's your victory.\nThe winner of the Great Warrior duel is not touched. That is an Orc tradition. Even if it's inefficient and foolishly honest.\nYour father hates you guys but well I guess this is worth respecting.\nThen and now these orcs are warriors worthy of respect.\nHowever as long as they share the same territory as humans it was a problem that one of them had to submit.\n* * * *\ncold.\nBeatrice felt that the winter on this land was not lacking even though she suffered from severe cold in the ice continent in the past.\nFrost Queen's Palace. An erosion field that has a powerful influence on the entire city and expands its territory.\nIn order to attack this Hari the goddess of flame and two dragons were brought in as backup. but······.\nThis is just it Magician Queen.\nstrong. Beatrice stared at the Orc Grand Shaman looking down at her from the huge ice wall.\nHey my queen this is a bit dangerous.\nI know Miss Hari.\nBeatrice saw dragons that were frozen as if they were stuffed in midair. The flames Hari wields are sticking to the ice and melting it but Frost Queen's ice doesn't melt it properly.\nIt has become much more powerful than the Frost Queen in the data. Perhaps it is because the users are different.\nUgh...\nKran the Orc Captain. The second-in-command of the Orc Continental Federation succeeding Murka.\nHe obtained the resurrected Frost Queen's heart in the Siberian snows and used it perfectly.\nAll but Beatrice and Hari were frozen and sealed by Krann.\nI can't use the wave's voice. I'm immediately used against it...\n[I have to use my power more and more Hariya.]\nAt the advice of Petos the god of war and flame Hari made up his mind. Numerous ice soldiers and frost giants are approaching the battlefield in front of her eyesight.\nBeatrice is a magician who specializes in long-distance combat. If so the only person who should be in charge of the vanguard is himself.\nMove forward.\nFlames raged on her blade. Hari prayed to God before the great battle of her life.\nPlease give me victory.\nI'll take care of you Hari-san.\nBeatrice's mana fluctuated. With the ringing of the Tsushima that opened the heavens and the earth the priestess of flame started running.",

It's just that Earth's magic was absurdly low compared to the ‘magic' he knew.\nSuck...!?\nHari held her breath as the magic trick unfolded before her eyes.\nThunder strikes and the light of extinction encroaches the space.\nEach level of great magic is defined as an A rank. Mythical magic that far exceeds the combat magic system established by mankind over the past 30 years unfolds as if breathing.\nThe Magician Queen of the Spero Kingdom.\nThe magic warfare developed by Beatrice Alighieri Sperro would be like watching a monkey's all-out battle between aircraft carrier fighters from the point of view of an Earthling.\nThe wizards of the present age are simply beings who receive the overwhelming magic she shows and the grace she shows.\nTo this sorceress queen Earth wizards are more like newborn babies.\nA great mage like that.

In Leon's world they were said to be powerful people at the pinnacle of magic.\nHowever they were no match for the Magician Queen. Even though he was suppressed by a giant named Lionheart and even touched the devil's magic he was thoroughly killed.\nThey were talented in their own way and on Earth they were the ones who would overwhelm the mage masters but even they couldn't withstand Vulcan's knife.\nThat's why I didn't think that the Orc shaman's skills were too great...\n‘The Queen is being pushed back.'\nFrost Queen's castle formed in the middle of the city.

And to stop them Beatrice sprinkles the spell of death.\nShe uses her spell to spread dreams and fog of death to stop the Black Orcs. By her spell she fights the Black Orcs and by her magic she fights the Krann.\n[Your role is important Hari.]\nHari swallowed at the request of God Petos.\nThe only helper left now is himself. As it is Beatrice had the option to protect it but Beatrice rejected it.\nAnyway at this rate we'll be overwhelmed by the quantity. Even if it's an Orc my spell won't work against the Frost Soldiers.\nOn the other hand Hari is the best among Frost Queen's family. Because the spell of her flame she handled melted her ice.\nSo Hari's mission is to break through Frost Queen's followers alone and kill or sabotage Krann.\nBeatrice trusted Hari and entrusted her with the role.\nBut the wave's castle law was blocked. Can we win with only flames?\nOn the other hand you cannot use the wave method. Just creating water to make waves is the only ingredient for his ice.\n[Believe me Hari. Your flame is acknowledged by this flame god.]\nWith Petos' encouragement Hari was determined. Yeah it's not a question of whether or not it's possible after all.

The feeling of watching the spectator freeze. However Hari warmed her body with a spark in her heart.\nReally is it my only match?\nSeeing the flames Krann moved his troops. Ice followers recreated with the heart of the Frost Queen. Among them they were knight-class followers who had been steadily mass-produced even before the formation of the Orc Continental Federation.\nGo get that little knight-girl's head.\nIce knights rush towards Hari. The frost knight's ice pick which was backed up by the Frost Queen's castle and filled with magical power with max value quickly struck.\nafter···!\nHari ducks her neck to avoid it.

I just covered my eyes with a wall of fire and lowered my posture to avoid the attack.\nAn extreme evasion that makes it impossible to prepare for the next attack if you think normally. However due to the difference in reaction speed caused by blindfolding and the flexible movement of the person himself he leaps at once like a cat.\n-······!!\nA frost knight stabbing Hari with an awl. However lightly correcting the trajectory with the blade the white knee kicked the knight right in the face.\n- Quaang!\nflames bursting again. As if the whole body were the ignition organ of the flame.\nWhirik!

A sword struck in a neat straight line.\nKreuk?\nThe smell of burning the severed cross section rises as Yeti tilts his head not even recognizing that he has been cut.\nHoo?\nKrann who kept his gaze on Hari even while engaging in a magic battle with Beatrice admired her appearance.\nReally a captain-level knight.\nOrcs had their nemesis especially born warriors.\nThe Warriders of Petos.\nThese Knights of Flame who believe in war and flame are the strongest beings on the Lionheart Frontline.\nAnd for a knight that handles fire like that the next pattern is——\nHooup...!\nGather the fire that dealt with the Frost Knights and the Yeti and unite them.\nThe culmination of the flame-type method taught by Leon and taught by Vulcanus.\nDivine Punishment < Fire of the Battlefield >\nRed flames scorch the ground and pour down as a single meteor. A first-of-its-kind natural disaster in which clouds split and ice evaporates. It was the moment when the pillar of fire was swung by a human hand.\nHmph. Is this just it?\nSeeing the huge pillar of fire Krann snorted. Frost Castle responds to his will.\n-Quaaaaaaa!\nThe gushing ice is truly inexhaustible. As if it were about to hit the world a huge ice block blocked the pillar of fire.\nwhat···!\nDo you think this is the end?\nAttributes < Frost Heart x Gokrok's Gaze >\nA green flash that penetrates the wall of ice blocking the pillar of fire. The moment Hari recognized it a flash of light pierced her heart.\nIt's so dark...?!\nMiss Harry!!\nBefore he had time to recognize Beatrice's urgent voice an ice flower bloomed from the pierced heart. It covered Hari in an instant and the statue in the shape of Hari collapsed dangerously.\nCompared to Vulcanus' flame this kind of fire is lukewarm.\nyou can't replace them\nAt the end of the ridicule of the old orc who had fought with the legends Hari's vision turned black.\n* * * *\nStrictly speaking Hari Han is not a true believer.\nHe has a righteous and gentle personality and respects his elders. Nowadays he is pure enough to be considered a natural monument but that does not lead to faith in God.\n“Ummm... I’m not religious for now.”\nWith the miracle of Leon right in front of his eyes he said that while scratching his cheek in front of real gods.\nI know the gods are real and I know the greatness of the Holy Law but that's it.\nShe was neither desperate nor hopeful enough to lead to a sincere faith.\nPerhaps that innocence on the contrary earned the attention of the gods.\n[Calm down...! If you fall asleep like this you will die!]\nGod's desperate cry. Hari repeated in her dying consciousness ‘How?'\nThe pierced heart was empty and the chilly cold engulfed the body. both outside and inside.\nlack of strength The flame does not spread. I think it would be easier if I left it to the dying consciousness.\n[If you give up here your comrades will die. You are not a knight to give it up.]\nAt those words I hold on to my dying consciousness. Yes if we give up here we all die. Not only himself but also his colleagues.\nBeing just means pure altruism. The integrity to be strong for others. That innocence is the most valuable virtue in chivalry.\n‘But Mr. Petos... I my heart... I lost my heart.'\n[Stupid. what is your heart What is your heart?]\n‘That's right...'\nSuddenly Hari remembered the existence of her own heart.\nA heart of fire transplanted to her by Isabel priest of the Moon and Purity.\n[The heart of fire left by Renoir looks like a crystal but the flame is not a crystal.]\nA flame that sways easily in the wind and never goes out. The blazing form is the original form of fire.\n[Light a fire. The flame in your heart is an eternal scare that never goes out.]\nAt Petos' advice he feels the lingering fire in his heart. Vulcanus once said.\n“It is a sacred object that produces holy power on its own just like the lion’s heart. ──You who received the heart of fire must have produced enough holy power.”\nLionheart's lion heart.\nDragon's Dragon Heart.\nand the Orc Undertaker's Heart of Fire.\nThe three major guardian holy objects handed down in Lionheart. Think of the glory the miracle of receiving that one transplant.\n······!!\nThe embers of the heart burn Just as the flame does not go out even if only a small ember remains.\nAnd the small fire soon turned into a huge flame.\n-Quaaaaaaa!!\nThe rising flames attract everyone's attention. Krann who was gradually overpowering Beatrice was caught by an unexpectedly huge flame.\nwhat······.\nThere was a knight wrapped in fire. A knight who melts all the ice that grows from his heart treats it as a ‘wave' and pours out ‘flame'.\nno way······.\nfire and waves. Could there be an existence that can handle the two opposite powers with the power of a saint?\nNo not in history. Because there are more people who use the power by receiving the blessings of various gods than I thought.\nBut how much talent must be born to treat it as a living saint class.\nComing!\nThe saintess runs. Hundreds of frost knights and frost soldiers who stood in their way tried to swing their weapons at the saintess who was running in a straight line.\n-·······?!\n-······!!\nHowever the ice pick they wield melts before they even reach it and the swirling waves of fire burn them.\nEventually the melted ice joins the saintess' wave of fire and grows even larger.\nA strange phenomenon in which ice melts and fire grows just by moving forward. Opposing it is now the strongest individuals of the Frost Queen's family.\n─────!!\nA gigantic frost giant roars. The giant whom even the Yeti treats like a child punches Hari as he rushes towards the castle.\nI'm riding a wave right now!!\nHowever a wave of fire accompanied the saintess. It hit the frost giant first.\nNo matter how huge a giant is it cannot stand in front of the waves that are nature itself. The frost giant was swept away by the waves floundering and melting in real time.\nOak···!\nYou bastard...!\nIn an instant you reach the top of the castle wall where the shaman is. It is no longer a problem with strong and high walls.\nBecause everything was burned and melted in front of Han Hari's waves of fire.\nthen···!\nKrann ate the heart of the Frost Queen he was handling in his arms. And that-\nWhat?!\nFrost Queen's castle is scattered. No it was concentrated in one place. At Krann the massive ice compresses and clings to Krann like armor.\nNothing changes!\nHari struck Krann with the sword of blazing flame. but······.\n-Kang!\nKrann's frozen arm blocks it. A red aura surged from Krann's arm which was protected like a suit of armor.\n< Helcan's Grandson >\nThe fist strikes Hari as it is. I managed to block it with the blade but it couldn't stop his body from flying away.\nwhat···!\nShaman melee combat? Isn't that also the divine power of commitment?\nI am the Orc leader. I used to be an Orc Lord who united numerous Orc tribes. I subdued the Orcs with only this fist.\nIt was a prejudice. It was common sense that a shaman would not be able to punch.\nBut the opponent is an orc. That too was once an elder at the pinnacle of the Orcs.\nAn orc is still an orc even if it is a beast defeated and wounded by the great orc great khan.\nCome on I'm getting tired of the tedious witchcraft warfare.\nKrann ordered all his subordinates on the battlefield to subdue Beatrice. Dealing with Han Hari who had awakened as a saint and dealing with the Magician Queen was a daunting task.\nWhoa...!\nHari also holds the sword with both hands. But soon Krann's figure disappeared from her eyes.\nwhat···!\nKrann who replaced all of his main powers with divine protection approached Hari with overwhelming physical strength.

Leon moved forward as his sword deflected the mace.\nMurka also moved forward without thinking of stepping back.\nIn close combat unable to wield a sword and mace each other's empty hands moved.\n- Kwak!\nCounter punches wielded simultaneously.

A sense of awe that we dare not add noise to this confrontation of the century.\nAnd the same goes for orcs.\nThey felt they had no right to interrupt the end of this confrontation.\nWhile everyone was watching Murka took a step back.\njust one step. Then let out a rough breath.\nKuheumm...\nMurka looked down at her body which was split in half from shoulder to thigh. And stare at the broken mace.\nWas it half a step?\nto be sick\nFirst defeat in my life.\nHaving overthrown the great Orc warchiefs and breaking even the demon lords this first defeat was awkward and embarrassing.\nBut I can't help but admit my defeat.\nHe was a fighter and knew what a loser's duty was.\nI lost.\nthat candid acknowledgment. Leon answered.\nI won.\nDespite the nasty declaration he nods. What remains now is ‘duty as a great khan'.\nLeader of the Orc Continental Federation! Great Khan Murka Balak! I propose to you guys!\nAt those words Leon's eyes twitched. He narrowed his brows as if he had heard an unpleasant declaration.\nDo you think the loser will be the subject to propose to the winner?\nHehehe it's not impossible. We still have some room to negotiate right?\nYou bastard...\nMurka said to Leon who looked like he had been stabbed in a painful place.\nFrom now on stop all hostile acts against the Orc Federation. Then...\nMurka looked around at the orcs watching her. As the Great Khan he has the duty to open a way for them to live with their sorrowful expressions who are destined to be butchered in the hunt for the defeated soldiers.\nAll orcs on this planet will be taken away by the orc gods.\nA de facto declaration of an end to the war.\nLeon thought of the Orc warlords who would resist amid the turmoil that had wounded the lost city and the world.\nPerhaps the Lionheart Federation will win in the end.\nHowever they will resist until the end having formed a huge anti-world federation called the Orc Continental Federation.\nEven this unfavorable fight is a struggle for them and they will seek glory and honor.\nEven Lionheart in his heyday could not exterminate the Orcs in the end. Then-\nOkay. I'll accept your offer.\nIf you don't like it but if it's your only chance to completely rid the world of Orcs.\nLeon decided to accept the offer even though he was reluctant.\nTake your kind and turn it off... Chit.\nLeon clicked his tongue as he looked at Murka who didn't answer. He stood still his eyes open and he took no more breath.\nHe was not an Orc until the very end.\nThe war is over.",

      "content": "Leon Dragonia Lionheart (1)\nThe rewar that shook the world of the fledgling federations is over.\nThe winner of this war in which 53 countries on the continent and 8 countries including Korea the United States Japan Taiwan India and parts of Southeast Asia participated directly for supremacy on the continent is the Lionheart Federation.\nThe Orc champions and warriors of Orc Grand Khan Murka Balak led to the defeat of the Orc Federation and Lionheart absorbed the Orc Federation as it was.\nThe problem was the millions of Orcs still remaining on the continent and everyone expected the slaughter of Orcs by Lionheart. But-\n[They gather sequentially and begin the alien migration of the orcs. This was promised in Lionheart's honor.]\nEveryone reacted unexpectedly to Leon's declaration.\nThe annihilator who was hung up on his abnormal hatred of orcs obediently opened a way for the orcs to live.\n[We do not surrender! We fight to the end!]\nOf course there were still Orc warlords with the will to fight but the subjugation proceeded swiftly and mercilessly.\nHowever most of the Orcs readily agreed to the migration plan thanks to the Black Orcs.\n[If that was the last command the Great Khan gave. We follow.]\nThe greatest orc in history. The influence of the one and only Great Khan Murka Balak was absolute among the Black Orcs and Orcs followed them.\nThe Orcs' rule of being strong was absolutely working even in the midst of this.\nWhile the Orcs' migration plan continued sequentially the problem was the Lionheart Federation which swallowed the entire remaining Orc Continental Union.\n-Isn't it dangerous to swallow that huge continent whole?\n-It is the rebirth of a unified continent. The problem is that it is not the backward developing country of the past but the center of Shinsung technology that will dominate the world.\n- Stop growth. If this continues all of Asia will be encroached upon by the Lionheart Federation.\nIt is a story that has been constantly discussed since the appearance of the pantheon.\nBlindly loved and favored by the gods the Lionheart of ‘Fire' does not share the same values ??as most of the Earth.\nHe is a famous hater a classist and an absolute monarch of the medieval worldview who despises democracy.\nWhere is the guarantee that he will not advance into an empire in the form of a federation?\n- But with what? how?\n-·······.\nNo one could question it. The world watched the war between the Lionheart Federation and the Orc Continental Federation.\nThey saw nuclear weapons being blocked by a single knight's long-distance protection method and faced the greatness of the method of artificially creating a tsunami and killing only enemies and the incomparable high technology of an all-weather space weapon.\nAnd above all-\n-How can you restrain a demigod that cuts through the sky with a knife?\n-Can you say that even after seeing a million monsters of the Beast Gods slaughtered over 13 days?\nThe confrontation between Leon and Murka in the final battle brought awe and fear to mankind.\nliving demigod. mansin's agent. The indefatigable transcendent of perfect vitality showed what was possible.\n-It looks like you're misunderstanding something but it's a level where Lionheart can conquer the world alone.\nIt is only natural that the world has come to such a conclusion. And even the saints and saints who were commanded by the demigods were not something that could be endured with the existing military power.\nAbove all-\n-Blessed crops iron arms iron semiconductors paradise after death can you give up all these things?\nHumanity has already figured it out. A real God and a paradise that can be obtained when they truly love humans.\nThe world is now beginning to be reorganized into a new order.\n* * * *\n[There let's dig out more intaglios to create patterns. Yes like my temple in the capital.]\nLet me tell you that. Then would you like the basic form to be similar?\n[okay. Seeing this reminds me of the past.]\nOn the continent which became the official territory of Lionheart temples of pantheon began to be built all over the place.\nFirst of all a second pantheon where all gods could be worshiped was built in the main city and each god started to build a guardian shrine claiming to be the guardian god of the city he liked.\nThe temple of Poma the god of the sea and waves built in a coastal city became a sacred place for those who work in the sea such as fishermen and traders.\nPetos the god of war and flame has put his name on the soon-to-be-established Lionheart Federation Military Academy.\nHeto the god of iron and blacksmiths protected cutting-edge semiconductor and manufacturing craftsmen in line with the latest trends and built a temple in the special industrial zone to be built on the continent.\nDemeraya the goddess of life and fertility is welcome everywhere. She is an absolute worship object in the grain belts of the Asian continent such as Beidahuang North China Plain and Sichuan Basin.\nUltima the god of sky and thunder became a god protecting the aviation and space industries and Tatar the sun and judgment became an obligatory object of faith for those who recited the code of laws.\nFleur the goddess of dreams and death will be a haven for all those who wish for mental treatment through dreams and a peaceful death.\nThe goddess of forests and trees Irmin as the goddess of elves and treemen sought a way to preserve nature and coexist.\nDragonia the god of gold and contracts has become the absolute standard for the global financial market and all contractors.\n[Well the children of the world say that the ‘moon' is the most surprising.]\n“I used to think so too at first.”\nI thought Dina the goddess of moon and chastity would be difficult to worship in modern society in many ways but more people believed in her than I thought.\n“Who would have known that there would be so many non-marriage people in this world?”\n[That's right.]\nAs long as one maintains the purity of the body God's blessings will come upon her. Since the unmarried people's devotion was greater than expected Dina was able to increase her church power.\nIn particular due to the nature of the pantheon where multiple worship is possible Buddhist monks enshrine the goddess of the moon as a bodhisattva.\n[joy. It's a niche market.]\nHearing the voice of the moon goddess Leon said with a faint smile.\nSince Spinner is about to launch a spacecraft to advance into the space industry I'll pick up the materials and build a temple on the moon.\n[If you say you're building I won't stop you.]\nHaha I'll take care and build it big. If you want I'll build it myself.\nLeon respects and worships all the gods but he is especially weak and has a sense of debt to the moon goddess.\nIt must have been because he had committed a mortal sin that angered the goddess.\n[It was! How long will my knight listen to that complaint! If you stop it's already done!]\n[what? that?]\nLeon dissuades the goddesses from quarreling with each other.\nLike Petos Ariana the goddess of light and justice will be the patron deity of knights and soldiers and the mother of all people.\nPursuing the light and upholding justice is the culture of all.\nFinally-\nVentasis. Are you okay with this?\n[what?]\nA faceless god did not build his temple. There must be a burnt offering altar in the pantheon but that's all.\nJust as there was no separate temple worshiping him in the old Lionheart Kingdom.\nIf you don't build a temple it won't be difficult to receive worship.\n[That's because you don't know the nature of primates.]\nVentasis is the god of darkness and vengeance.\nHe is the guardian of those who aspire to forge their blades in pitch-black shadows.\nIn every age there have always been those who worship him.\n[The stronger the light the darker it is. Avengers will always arise and I will answer them by praying to me in the dark.]\nNo matter how perfect your governance is no matter how prosperous you cultivate darkness will always exist. Ventasis said it was enough for them to worship him in the shadows.\nI'm glad you all found your place.\nLeon was genuinely delighted that the gods had adapted well to this Earth as well.\n[Leon.]\nAnd the voice of the goddess approaching him. The goddess is Fleur the goddess of dreams and death and the grim reaper who guides her on the way to paradise.\n[The time has come. Hold the original woman's hand.]\nLeon took her hand. Soon he follows the guidance of the goddess and heads to the spiritual world.\nNow towards the paradise in the heart that I will soon have to give up.\nAre you here?\nparadise of the gods. Many people are waiting for Leon in a place prepared for those who have respected the gods and lived an upright life.\nThere was the brown-haired Saint Agnac the Holy Grail Knight Lord Gratas who gave a scripture to hunt giants as a serf the Sun Knight Loxley who accompanied Leon in the final war and the Iron Knight Antoc... · and.\nOh your majesty my brother-in-law.\nblack hair. Next to the Moon Priestess who looks particularly lively and smiles brightly as if looking at a friend rather than reverence there is a woman who looks remarkably similar.\nGo ahead. Brother.\nAs Isabel shoved her back the woman shyly made her way through the crowds who had come to meet the Lion Heart King.\nEveryone opens her way and soon she comes to Leon.\n······.\nLeon didn't say anything to the woman who approached right in front of him. He just swallows his overwhelming feelings and hugs her woman tightly.\nI missed you.\nThe woman was briefly surprised by his sudden action but soon warmly buried her face in his arms.\nme too.\nHer name is Lionheart of Castile.\nShe was the only wife of Leon Dragonia Lionheart and the mother of Carina Dragonia.\n* * * *\nIn the paradise created for the dead a magnificent view unfolds wherever you go.\nEach of the infinite domains and territories where the dead could decorate to their heart's content had distinct personalities and when it comes to the most natural scenery it is also the place where the wise men and elves of the forest live.\nThis vast green area is as quiet as the residents making it a suitable place to spend time quietly.\nLeon rode Petelion a winged dark horse given to him by the Lion Heart King of Argentina and landed at a place where only the two of them could live.\n“Take my hand.”\nHuh His Majesty seems to have forgotten that I was Dina-sama's hunter.\nEven as she said that Castile grabbed Leon's hand and got off the horse.\nTo Jim what will you do with something as precious as a flower that is always tender?\nReally... you're still the same.\nThe two of them just looked at each other in the corner of paradise. That alone was good.\nAs you may have already heard I met Karina. That girl suffered a lot in another world.\nHe's a strong kid. I'm sure he'll do well wherever he goes.\nLeon talked about Karina for a while. The story of how she built her empire in the underworld. The story of a courtship duel. The story of finally joining the pantheon after negotiating with the dragon king.\nCastile quietly listened to it and enjoyed Nanggun's voice while laughing.\nA lot has happened. There are so many things I want to say to you.\nme too.\nIt was a love that could never come true. It was a love that was achieved by committing taboos and it was a love that was protected by enduring the wrath of the goddess.\nThis may be a common love story but Leon is so precious and precious that this love is so precious that he waited for the day when he would come here.\nA day to do your due duty feast with the gods and be with your loved ones forever.\nThe wife also knew her husband's long-cherished wish.\nNot yet Leon.\n······.\nYou can't come here yet.\nCastilla...\nLeon asked holding Castile's hand.\nDon't you want to see me? Do you resent me?\nIt can't be. Castilla shook her head and said.\nMy heart is your heart. But... you still have a lot of work to do.\nBefore being Leon's wife she is the queen of the kingdom. She was a priest who served the gods and a noble who lost her people to evil species.\nShe knew many things that only Leon could do in this world and therefore thought that she shouldn't be selfish. More than anything······.\nI was very happy. I was able to remember you and smile until the last moment. But... you are not.\nHis life has always been a series of fights.\nHe spent his youth fighting orcs and as king he fought against the unruly corrupters of the empire and the demons until the kingdom was destroyed and even after it was destroyed he fought alone.\nEveryone in Paradise watched the Lion Heart King's lonely fight.\nI saw him camp in the dry earth saw him roar with the blood of demons.\nI saw a king swallowing his emotions as he collected the armor of his dead friends and loyal soldiers.\nWhen she cried out in her hometown that was finally destroyed she lamented that even the gods could not deliver anything but words of comfort.\nDon't come yet. Come enjoy happiness in the world of the older.\nMy happiness lies with you!\nCastilla shook her head and said.\nI've been waiting for two hundred years. So you can wait a little longer.\nI've been waiting for two hundred years. So I can't wait any longer.\nWhoops sometimes I wish you could be as bold as Lord Vulcan.\nLike Vulcanus who brazenly said that he would enjoy life in this world for the rest of his life I wish Leon would enjoy his life if not to that extent.\n“Remember that there are people waiting for you in this life.”\nAt that Leon was speechless. Because he knows the intention of Castile's words.\nAre you okay?\nSometimes you seem to have a different conception than ours. Isn't a hundred years enough to forget twenty years of life?\nThat's just an Earthling's idea Castile chuckled as the only person who knew he was from another world.\nDon't just reject those who are recommended by the gods. After all they are recommending you because they love you Your Majesty.\n“If I had embraced all the women the gods pushed me into I would have had a hundred wives.”\nDon't go that far. It's going to be difficult to sort things out later in Paradise. Up to ten people will be fine. Please make a lot of Karina's siblings. When you're old you'll live for the fun of looking after your grandchildren right?\nha······.\nAt Leon sighing Castile hugged Leon's neck and smiled.\nBut I'll leave this one final.\n“What is that——”\nIt was a kind of surprise. The heat on his reddened cheeks was warm and the scent of the flesh that was close gave off a subtle sweetness.\nThe sweet and fluffy lips overlap like soft flesh that can be bitten.\nMoist lips. It seemed to be slightly separated but the juice squeezed through it. In the process of intertwining the two of them fall apart as if they were regretful after fully savoring each other.\nCastilla smiling bashfully has a face like a girl in love just like when she was kidnapped by a cloth.\nThat I'm the first. You can't forget that much.\nAt that Leon couldn't help but laugh.\nEven though he may resent his wife for pushing him to this world in the end how can he reject such a lovely woman?\nI love you. Forever.\nI love you. In life or in death.\nThe time for the living to stay is coming to an end.\nLeon returned to the world of the living remembering the day he would head to paradise someday.\nTo the world where he must be and who awaits him.",

      "content": "Leon Dragonia Lion Heart (2) finished\nIf you go all the way down the road from Pyongyang to Nampo there is a lake called Taejeongho.\nBefore unification a golf course was built for the use of North Korean high-ranking officials and the natural scenery was maintained by strictly prohibiting the access of people.\nAnd now after the end of the war and the federal agreement the executives of the Mansinjeon are enjoying an unusual boating.\n-Clucking!\n(Kikiroukho is leaving!)\n- Giggles!\n(Sir Vulcanus take off your armor and get on board!)\nUgh! Armor is like a knight's life! How could he tell you to lay down your life!\nIt's not even an exhibition so take off your clothes.\nLord Raihar! Even you!\nFlower viewing and boating are the skills of the nobility. They enjoy the splendid civilization of the earth but they each push each other reminiscing about the culture of the untimely kingdom.\n“But Suho where is the queen?”\nWell. I saw that Noona and So-yeon went out on a boat. Maybe they got on in front of him?\nWhen will your Majesty come?\nJaehyuk remembered that Leon was still in Pyongyang with the black dragon.\nThere are many issues to be coordinated with Lionheart Federation-related affairs so officials from the federation are in Pyongyang.\n“Anyway boating is best with Hari-senpai. I think we can play more dynamically with waves.”\nIs it okay to use the sex law for selfish desires like that...\nI hit the thunder of Ultima on the battery to try to copy money and it's like this again after being scolded.\nMeanwhile. In the center of Lake Taejeong several ships are floating. Among them one of the most luxurious ships.\nA ship serving royalty should not lack decoration and splendor.\nSilk is laid on a wooden board to make it soft and the lion flag of the Lionheart Federation is hung on the sail that moves the ship according to the wind.\nIf you look closely at the twinkling lights they are outrageous luxury goods with lights carved from gems.\nThere an ashen-haired beautiful girl who manages the facility gives instructions to the squirrels while sipping lemonade.\nExcuse me set up the lighting angle for number 17. The flower decoration must follow the designated planner. I will not allow even an inch of error.\n-Kick!\n(Okay!)\nThis iron and blacksmith's Holy Grail Knight beckoning to the kinks hugged my minimal-sized star iron body and lay down in a rocking chair.\nThe play of inferior organisms doesn't seem too bad either.\nYapi agreed with the myths on the internet that sometimes you have to eat junk food. It's a statement without any intellectual or logical basis but it doesn't matter because it's my own style.\n[Oh my yapi... when will you show off your descendants?]\nAt the words of Heto the iron and blacksmith god Yaffy nodded.\nThis device does not need to depend on the organism's inferior means of reproduction. This device can multiply indefinitely.\n[It's not that kind of story this one.]\nHeto wanted to squeeze the forehead of this self-proclaimed flawless mineral but in the end it was only a matter of time.\n[Go through the world more. See feel and try many things and then you too will know the human mind.]\n???\nYapi couldn't understand Heto's words yet but he didn't forget to order an extra marinated chicken.\nOh is it delicious?\nAt that time Beatrice in a dress came out at the stern. She looked at Yapi eating the marinated chicken and called out to her.\nIt's sweet. Would you like to eat Her Highness?\nI'll refrain from having dinner earlier.\nBeatrice gently stroked Yapi's hair and sat down on the soft sofa prepared at the stern.\nThe cruise ship which Yapi said was made as a kind of luxury tour service for the future economic independence of the Kikkiruk tribe was enough for her as a royal family to enjoy.\nHoo~\nWhy?\nWhat do you do when you get some fresh air in a nice place like this~ There's no one to enjoy it with.\nThe great war is over. After absorbing the Orc Continental Confederation and sweeping away the followers of the Beast Gods the Gate no longer appeared.\nThe age of war is now over. Of course Leon still seemed to have something to think about.\n‘Now that I've finished all the important things... I want you to take care of me soon.'\nYapi and herself who should be assisted by her closest aides have been on vacation like this but she is currently working in Pyongyang.\nFor Beatrice this was a valuable opportunity to be with Leon but he didn't even show his nose.\n[Oops. It looks like the priestess of the original woman is tightly bent.]\nHe smiled like it was cute to see Beatrice's upset.\nDon't make fun of me Fleur. I'm pretty serious.\n[Then how about you try courting more actively?]\nNo.\nIt was a resolute refusal.\nA gentleman woos first. How can a woman woo first? It's rude.\n[That’s it... When will the priestess of the original woman go ahead and start dating?]\nBut well it's not that wrong. Bondi courtship is a law that a man must ask for first. Even if it is an outdated notion it doesn't matter anyway since the two of them have lived in an outdated notion.\n[Behave yourself right away. come.]\nyes?\nA white horse lands on board with fluttering and powerful flapping of its wings. The Goddess of Light that the Goddess of Light saved my article and gave it to me.\nWow~ You did a good job flying. Have a meal over there.\n- Hee hee!\nThe man who got off the top gently stroked the white divine beast's neck.\n“Your Majesty you are here!”\nBeatrice busily corrects her posture. Leon responded with a smile at her hospitality.\nDid you wait?\nsure.\nLeon kissed the back of Beatrice's hand and headed towards the stern.\nHow are you so late?\nI'm late because I've been meeting old ties... and asking permission again.\nPermission?\nYou said you were busy wasn't it? Leon asked the puzzled Beatrice with a serious gaze.\nThe great war is over. There will be no fighting for a while.\nIt is.\nIt's not that there's nothing to do. The Lionheart Federation which is no different from a fledgling nation must be built from the ground up and a world devastated by a long war must be rebuilt.\nIt is the duty of the royal family to subjugate monsters still wandering in the wild promote the well-being of the people and make the country rich and strong.\nIf until now there was simply war now is the era of rule and stability. The work to be done will increase even more.\nHowever I don't think the war is truly over. We'll have to head there someday.\n······yes.\nBeatrice fully knew what Leon was saying.\ndevildom.\nIt is the habitat of demons and a world where evil is rampant.\nIt is a complex world made up of many dimensions and dimensions and the demons are increasing their power by attracting the world's evil and its minions.\nAlthough the demons have now declined due to the loss of their ruler someday they will come back with more power.\nIt might have been after the current Lion Heart King ascended to heaven. Because demons are afraid of Leon.\nLeon has no intention of leaving him.\nBice. I will head to the Demon Realm someday. I will fight again. It is a hard and rough road.\nCan you follow yourself to the end?\nViche answered Leon's question without the slightest worry or hesitation.\n“As long as His Majesty is on her way forever.”\nLeon was grateful for the devotion of this lovely queen. Having made up her mind he got her down on one knee.\nyour majesty?\nLeon handed her a small box he had taken out of his pocket. Needless to say what was in it.\nI am... no I can be confident that I was a good king and an honorable knight. But I was not a good lover. I am a failed father and a husband who could not find a wife.\nLeon's life was a series of fights.\nBorn as the legitimate son of the glorious Grand Duke of Dragonia he embarked on a journey to fulfill his duty.\nHe received and fulfilled the quest of the goddess and became War Knight Holy Grail Knight and Guardian of the Holy Grail and ruled the country wonderfully but lost precious things in the process.\nNevertheless he lived indomitably and finally destroyed evil so his life must have been glorious and honorable even in his own opinion.\nhowever.\nHe was never a good husband.\nHe lost his daughter for a long time because he couldn't be a good father and he says that even if he wants to revive his beloved wife he must not go against the providence.\nhe won't change\nA failed father's cause of abandoning his wife.\nhe won't give up\nBecause he has to fulfill his duty to the end.\nThe thing in front of you is a pathetic man a wall window that says even empty words that you can't give priority to your wife. Even so... even so Bice... Beatrice Alighieri Spero.\nOpen the box and reveal the contents. What was inside was a beautiful ring that the dragon who had a better taste for jewelry than anyone else had carefully selected.\nWould you like to be with a pathetic man with a hat like this?\n······.\nBeatrice stared at Leon quietly.\nIt was clear that such a great man Lion Heart King the king of knights and agent of the gods was nervous like never before.\nThe fact that she is worried that she will be rejected is revealed on her face...\nvery happy and lovely\nyour majesty······.\nHe is a man who has lost a lot.\nShe is a woman who has lost a lot.\nWhat caused them to lose was a common evil and the process of the two was similar but the ending was different.\nThe Lionheart finally overcame the war alone\nDespite the dedication of the loyal knights the magician queen was facing the end of corruption.\nHe was respectful grateful and even awe-inspiring.\nEven then to Beatrice Leon was a half-god worthy of reverence. It was a great being that could not exist anywhere in this world.\nThe Lionheart realized that he was also a human like himself when he left the old Grail Knight's sacrifice and left the gate.\nWhen Grail Knight Geobrick chose to self-destruct and entrusted his will to the king Beatrice saw Leon's face.\nThe face that endures painful disgrace.\n“You must not die before Jim. The death of the person next to you will pierce your bones no matter how many times you experience it.”\nI still remember the taste of the alcohol we drank that day.\nAfter all you are also a human being who has been hurt.\nHe was not a man who could not fall or fall.\nEven if you fall down you always get up again.\nThe kind of person who will definitely stand up again.\nFrom then on I liked this person.\nIt didn't take long for the admirable hero to become lovable.\nyour majesty.\nGrab Leon's arm. He wakes him up and thinks of a future to walk with.\nThat future will surely be a journey of winding and winding roads but that's okay.\nBecause this person will always walk by my side.\nI'll walk with you.\nA man gently stroked her cheek and hair cautiously approached Beatrice who was looking at me with trembling eyes.\nA fleeting moment when everyone turned their heads and even the gods averted their eyes.\nOn the boat of the calm lake the two of them brought their faces close to each other.\nObviously this moment will not be the ending.\nFor today it would be okay to whisper a happy ending.\nThe King of Knights who returned with God.\nMain story complete\n-Continued from Abduction-",

      "content": "A side story changed world (1)\nabduction 1\nIt has already been half a year since the Continental Federation of Lionhearts achieved unity.\nGates no longer appeared on Earth after the large-scale fluctuating gate incident in which the followers of beast gods poured out but people were still wary of the gate phenomenon which had become a daily routine for the past 30 years.\nHowever after half a year of that I became convinced that the Gate no longer existed.\n[We officially declare that the gate situation is over as of the current time!]\nThis proclamation ceremony which was proclaimed one after another from around the world finally liberated the citizens who had been in fear of the Gate.\n-at las! This war is finally over!\n-Now you don't have to be afraid that the dungeon break will happen!\n-Is it possible to rebuild the hometown destroyed by the dungeon break?\nEven if the gate disappeared humanity did not completely escape the threat of monsters.\nIt's been 30 years since the gate incident happened. There are countless bursts of dungeon breaks and the monsters that popped out of the dungeon became wild and reigned as predators of the ecosystem.\nIn particular in this respect the current Lionheart Federation...the former continental states were very vulnerable.\nMo the monsters are coming!\nDamn when did you grow a habitat like that!\nGongjia Mountain is the highest peak in Sichuan Province. Due to the absence of surveillance personnel monsters that had nested here were coming down to the city in search of food.\nThese giant hornets also called killer wasps can pierce and kill livestock as well as people with stingers the size of a human torso.\nOriginally the Orc army operated by the Republic of Sichuan Province would have subdued it regularly but the absence of military power was too great in the place where the Orcs left.\nSah save me...!\nThe moment when a group of giant wasps were about to attack humans.\nHuh...!\nhammering through the air. It destroys wasps larger than humans in one blow.\nAre you okay?\nGo thank you!\nKoo Dae-seong raised the citizen who was about to suffer a disaster and caught his breath when he saw the city attacked by a colony of giant hornets.\nHooup...!\nFlip the hammer and swing it horizontally. The blow containing the Holy Law struck everyone around in an instant.\n-puck!\nA wasp's body was crushed by that wind pressure-\n-Pupperpuck!\nHundreds of them are destroyed all at once. During that time no one was injured.\nHas this been roughly sorted out?\nThe real problem is handling colonies. From now on if you climb to an altitude of more than 7000 meters above sea level and find it well I wonder if it will be possible to solve it within a few hours.\n- Flutter!\nThen huge wing flaps that block the sun. The black dragon landed in front of Goo Dae-seong.\nMayor of Pyongyang! His Excellency Dae Gong!\nBlack Dragon the mayor of Pyongyang Special Self-Governing City and Karina descending from it.\nThe hive has been cleaned up. Sir Spinner's satellite observations are always accurate.\n[Obviously]\nA familiar mechanical sound came through the communicator. Karina and Goo Dae-sung shrug their shoulders.\nBy the way it seems like you've already wiped out 30000 monsters this week. Quite a lot.\nIt's been neglected for over 30 years and it depended on the Orcs until recently.\nAfter being absorbed by the Orc Continental Confederation the Orcs were migrating to the outer world through the gate.\nOf course the Lionheart Federation took over the area that the Orcs had managed so far and a massive subjugation operation was taking place.\nWell thanks to a lot of new recruits there's not a shortage of manpower.\nKarina saw the hunters entering the city. Hunters who were active in the existing Continental Countries and most of them enlisted as the Man at Arms of the Lionheart Federation.\nHunters who lost their jobs after the Gate incident ended were accepted by Lionheart as soldiers.\nOf course not all but many refused conscription or argued for a small salary but Lionheart is not a ‘democratic country'.\nAbove all Leon which became a de facto empire did not tolerate the existence of private soldiers.\nIn other words it means that private guilds are being disbanded sequentially and incorporated into the federal army.\n“If you twist it. know?\nYapi's bloody threats were everywhere.\nIt'll be late anyway. Let's go.\nAh that's what you mean.\nAt Karina's urging Goo Dae-seong scratched his head as if he had remembered something and boarded the black dragon.\nThen thank you mayor.\n[Don't bother falling.]\nThe black dragon flapped its wings and took flight.\n* * * *\nWhen the entire huge continent of China was incorporated into Lionheart there were several noises.\nIs it right to devour such a huge continental country and they should be left as independent countries and made neutral in the third world etc.\nThey gradually began to check the size and influence of the Lionheart Federation hoping that at least they would share the same ideas as themselves.\nLike democracy for example.\nKoo Dae-seong the lord of heaven!\n“Thousands of years! Thousands of years!!\nBut there's no way.\nSichuan Basin. In this place one of China's representative grain belts the temple of Demera the goddess of life and fertility was built and naturally became the territory of Gu Dae-seong her representative.\nNot all granary areas are like this but as one of the territories that Yapi distributed to the high-ranking officials and knights of the Mansinjeon Gu Dae-seong is the titled ruler of all the lands here and is no different than a king with all rights in taxation development and law. was\nReally... this vast land is all my domain...\nWell it's natural for nobles. No matter what.\nIt doesn't fit our common sense...\nKarina looked down at the citizens of the city as if it didn't matter.\nI heard that there are some reckless people who do not return the land.\nThat's because from their point of view their property which is fine is taken away.\nThe Lionheart Federation declared that it would recover and redistribute all of the property that the citizens of the existing continent had.\nThe most opposed to this was the existing vested interests. Having amassed tremendous wealth over the past 30 years they naturally resisted the sound of their wealth being taken over.\n“Hey how can a wagon run if you worry about being trampled on by ants?\nCapitalists would have been astonished if they had heard of it but it is already happening all over the Lionheart Federation.\nThere were those who wanted to pack up their possessions and escape the continent but they couldn't help it.\nA complete satellite system was monitoring the border area and the network payment network was blocked.\nThey obediently donate their property and the process of property formation will be reviewed and only a certain amount will be returned.\nof course. The after-tax amount to which Lionheart's grand principle tax law was applied.\nNow you are also the lord of the territory. I think it is necessary to specify the law.\nThe reason Karina came to Goo Dae-seong is to give advice to the novice lord Goo Dae-seong. However Koo Dae-sung's idea was surprisingly simple.\n“I intend to do as Lord Yapi suggests.”\nHuh? Sir Spinner's City Integrated Management System?\nEven before the ratification of the Lionheart Federation Yapi prepared a mechanized system to govern the country.\nCity monitoring and policing. From policy proposals and underground resource development to automated management programs granted to individual citizens.\nBased on Leon's order to refrain from too rational cold mechanical systems Yapi constructed a utopia system in which humans can be the happiest in their own way.\nIf it was just a mechanical system it would have been enough to create a cyberpunk dystopia but Yafi who enjoyed the pleasures of the human world with a body created by the gods calculated his own way for humans to be happy.\n-As long as the dogs and pigs are allowed to eat moderately and live-\n-Oh no! Sir Yapi!\nIn any case the integrated management system that Yapi made up the basic system and the Holy Grail Knights reviewed and passed was being completed in the direction of pursuing universal happiness for the majority.\nGoo Dae-seong intends to incorporate his long-earned territory into the integrated system without thinking about governing it.\nI'm just a knight. I don't think it's my role to govern the territory.\n“Then what is your role?”\n“It is to become a solid shield that protects the citizens.”\nAnd articles like yourself\nBased on chivalry his own conviction. Goo Dae-sung's determined expression made Karina smile.\nI see you're honest enough that His Majesty will like it.\nKarina even more liked this article.\nIf you grow it well it will become a worthy article.\nNow~ Lord Daeseong Koo. To commemorate your inauguration this work will tell you how to collect taxes.\nTax tax... you mean?\nIt is the basic duty of the lord to engrave this great principle to the people of the earthworm.\nGoo Dae-sung knew what Karina was talking about. However it was not easy to apply tax laws that were still difficult to understand even with his common sense.\nLet's go collect ten structures. If we set an example by turning the rebellious ones into serfs all the lowly ones will follow.\nha ha ha······.\nAre you okay? ten structures?\n* * * *\nIn the Lionheart Federation those who received the territory directly from the Lion Heart King are living saints and saints.\nThey began to rule the estate in their own way. Although he accepted Yapi's integrated management system like Daeseong Koo the direction of urban development inevitably differs greatly depending on the owner of the estate.\nRight now Goo Dae-sung is the Holy Grail Knight of life and abundance. Therefore the main industry of the manor has no choice but to be agriculture.\nThen who is the most exotic and unusual lord among the lords?\n-Kick!\nIs there any need to mention it?\nIt is none other than Lord Yakt Spinner the Holy Grail Knight of Iron and Blacksmith.\nOhh~ Great Iron and Blacksmith's Grail Knight. Here humble organics be worshiped.\nLionheart Federation's largest economic city and former Shanghai County Night City.\nNamed for a city without night Yacht Spinner the lord of this city greeted the citizen representatives who visited her audience room the ultra-high-altitude city management tower Yapi Tower.\n-Kick! Worked hard to get here.\nAigoo what a hard work.\nThey are members of the Civic Council created to represent the citizens of Night City. Members of the council made a democratic mechanism to make suggestions to the lord of the city yaffi and to reflect the views of the citizens.\nAre you surprised?\nIf you look at the reality it's not.\n──To give your opinion on real estate distribution...\n- refused.\nLord... This is a thoughtful proposal from our council.\n-What happened because you guys didn't understand this machine's grand plan. What does organic matter know?\nTsk tsk Yappy acting like a tongue-in-cheek at the Council's ignorance. The camera eye's ability to express emotions is developing day by day.\n“Well then the relaxation of the property cap system for citizens is——”\n- It is impossible to spend more than this on the distribution of resources even for the maintenance of a sustainable welfare system.\n“There are voices of concern about excessive urban development——”\n- The development of the city leads to the peace of the citizens. Not knowing this is just disappointing.\n“······.”\nThe Citizens' Council and all that is just an assortment to appease those who are reluctant to rule by machines.\nThere is no way this yakt spinner would admit democracy or anything like that. The reason was different from Leon who was an absolute monarchist.\n-If you just do what this machine tells you to do everything will be fine. What's your complaint?\nOf course Yaffe knew very well that humans couldn't just accept it.\n-Increased the spread rate of the matrix system even more. Infinite Tsukuyomi's version update is planned.\nHow can you change the naming...\n- The name will be changed in the commercial version.\nYapi understands.\nWhat humanity needs is bread and circuses not free will.\nIf it wasn't for the opposition of the gods it would have been possible to make the access time of the matrix system 24 hours a day and to extract energy from human bioelectricity.\nOf course bioelectricity extracted from humans is only a rat tail so it would be better to develop more nuclear fusion power plants or new nuclear reactors.\nIn any case humans are very complex and difficult to understand so Yapi sometimes inspects the city wearing a human body.\n- Beep! Highest-ranking citizen: Yakt Spinner lord confirmed boarding. Where can I take you?\nThe unmanned taxi artificial intelligence supplied to the entire Night City as a free welfare measure responded to the ashen-haired beautiful girl's boarding.\nTo where you always go.\n- Beep! approval. We will meet you with safe driving.\nAs the taxi moves it illuminates the panoramic view of Night City.\nFlashy neon signs and highly advanced unmanned machine systems are becoming similar to Yapi's hometown.\nThere the level of happiness of the citizens could not be said to be high due to the lack of resources and limitations. Didn't the quest for technology eventually lead to the jewel of wisdom summoning the great devil?\nBut this place is different. Dystopia does not exist in the Lionheart Federation where the gods have begun to protect.\nCitizens received honest rewards for their hard work and could enjoy entertainment without worrying about illness.\nOf course in return restrictions on freedom of religion and invasion of privacy frequently occurred.\nIt looks just right doesn't it?\n- Beep! That's right Lord Yapi.\nInferior minerals will accept the superior domination of this machine.\n- Exactly lord!\nThe human world will be ruled by machines. After His Majesty the Lion Heart King will be the owner of this machine.\n- Exactly lord!\n- A wise person who cannot be compared with the organic Holy Grail Knights!\n-For the great and beautiful King of Mechanism!!\nSavoring the praises of the artificial intelligences all over the city Yapi looked at the panoramic view of the city as he headed towards the marinated chicken shop.\nWithout knowing that Yafi herself is becoming more and more like the rulers of the human world.\nThat was when they arrived at the unmanned taxi-only road.\nAllahu Akbar!!\n-Kick?\nAnti-tank rockets flew towards the taxi in which Lord Yapi was riding.\n-Quaaaaang!!",

      "content": "A side story changed world (2)\nCalled the magic wand of Allah this old anti-tank rocket has been loved by the Third World for a long time.\nThe operation is simple the power is moderate and above all it is cheap.\nThe era of superhumans has come and this magic wand of Allah has also been shot by hunters.\nI don't know if it's a high-ranking hunter but if it's a C-class or D-class hunter this is enough to die.\nAllahu Akbar!\nHow much more a mass-produced taxi will explode in a splendid way in front of the magic wand of Allah!\n- Anti-tank rocket approach warning.\nNight City's unmanned taxi is a special vehicle with 0.01% iron alloy produced at Yapi's Daeri mechanical arm factory.\nIn other words all taxis in Night City are blessed by Heto the blacksmith god. It's not something that can be done with anti-tank rockets.\n- Quaang!\nAs smoke from the explosion spread the terrorists were confident of their success. I was aiming for Yapi in his human form. As long as it's a human body there's no way it'll be safe from anti-tank rockets—\n- Vroom!\nWhat!?\nYou're fine?!\nSeeing the taxi intact after being hit directly by an anti-tank rocket the terrorists immediately tried to prepare for a second wave.\n-Passenger safety response mode.\nAt that moment the bonnet of the taxi is opened and the heavy heavy artillery is revealed. It was charged with energy supplied by a small nuclear reactor mounted on the taxi.\n-Younglord. Please set the response level.\nRespond in a way that does not destroy the facility.\n- Yes! Initiate suppression with a pulse gun connected directly to the reactor.\n- Tung! Tung! Tung!\nA pulse gun fired from the top of the taxi's bonnet subdued the terrorists in an instant. However among them there were terrorists who could not be subdued even with a pulse gun superhumans who had awakened their magical powers.\nThat is they are hunters.\nHunter terrorists rushed towards the taxi ignoring the pulse gun with high-performance armor for hunters. If you go on like this you will crash.\nTaxi AI did not overconfident in its body.\n- Perform emergency evasion maneuvers! Fasten your seat belt!\nWhat a profit! and the fuselage of the taxi rapidly turning. It narrowly dodged a man-sized object and at the same time steered into an escape route.\nChit...!\nIn the meantime they were the terrorists who cut off the pulse gun attached to the taxi but the taxi ignored them and ran away.\nFollow me!\nGod is great!\nTerrorists on motorcycles chase Yapi's taxi. Night City's busy highway an unexpected drive action unfolded.\nKill God's harlot!\nHumans are not ruled by machines!!\nTerrorists chasing after shooting hunter bows. Taxi AI asked cautiously.\n-Younglord. Request a response level increase. At least level 3 response...!\nDo you know how much economic loss the city will have if you do that? Do you make money by digging?\nThey are digging and building an underground city. Taxi AI didn't bother to say that.\nLevel 2 response authorized.\n- Yes.\nThe response level to the threat of Night City exists up to level 5.\nThe war mode directly initiated by the lord Yapi is level 4. The final protocol city self-destruction is level 5.\nFrom level 3 onwards the response is very low. Level 3 is the bombardment of armored divisions in the city and level 2 is——\n“This is Taxi Service No. 7! A VIP passenger has been attacked! To all our drivers in the Rodeo Zone Little Cheongsam Zone and Lost Siberia Zone!」\n“Everyone gather under me!”\nThere are numerous taxis in Night City.\nDue to the existence of these free taxis that guarantee citizens' freedom of transportation the residents of Night City do not need to purchase or drive a vehicle.\nHowever all these taxis are controlled by Yapi's city integrated management system a central AI which can be requisitioned for city safety in case of emergency.\nHundreds of thousands of taxis exist everywhere in the city.\n······!\nWhat what that!!\nThe terrorists were stunned as they watched the taxis running at full speed filling the roads.\nDue to the perfect road control system the busy highways of Night City were jammed with taxis.\nThe headlights's' running from across the road were dazzling and the voices of the AIs who opened the windows and turned up the volume were full of anger.\n-Some bastard messed with our mayor!\n-mind! What does your father do! Neg father mahahino!\n-You guys stay there! I'm going to drive a taxi and blow all your heads off!\nIt was a roar that seemed to resonate through the city with just the sound of the creaking. Hundreds of cars back and forth. They were taxis gathered by AI taxi's emergency call.\nUh uh uh!\nThese crazy machines!!\nWhile the Teverums hesitated hundreds of taxis stepped on the accelerator in front and behind the terrorists.\n” Bread! You fucking bastard!!\nNight City is peaceful today.\n* * * *\nAfter the cataclysm the war on terrorism declared by the United States has become obsolete.\nGates that poured monsters and scattered magic powers right away were the priority so there was no time to worry about religious fanatics in distant countries.\nMoreover the main reason for this was the emergence of a new material that could replace the existing oil but as magic stones began to replace oil interest in natural resources in the Middle East was greatly diminished.\nBecause the world has been swayed not by international oil prices but by international magic crystal prices.\n-The gate crisis is over! Humanity will no longer be able to dig up magic stones!\n-Then comes the era of oil again! It's time to regain your lost influence!\nOil-producing countries such as Iran Iraq Saudi Arabia and Russia which were the centers of the world economy in the 20th century believed that their world had come but—\n[Lionheart Federation. New nuclear fusion reactor revealed! Combined with divine energy the so-called divine reactor can move the entire city with one blow!]\n[A new substance that replaces magic stones. It is made of faith.]\n[Night City where more than 90% of the citizens are pantheonists. In fact an energy utopia powered by a permanent engine!]\nThe era of magic stones has passed and a new era has arrived.\nAnd the name of the age was God not oil and that god was confined to the pantheon.\nAs a result it is natural that oil-producing countries are in trouble. And they decided to do what they do best.\nI will provide a weapon and route. Hit the Pantheon as much as possible to reduce their influence.\n“That mechanical Holy Grail Knight. Even if he disappears the economic power of the Lionheart Federation can collapse.”\nIt is not yesterday or today that the leaders of oil-producing countries such as the religious leaders of Iran and the royal family of Saudi Arabia are sponsors of terrorists.\nExtreme fanatical terrorists such as the Taliban Al Qaeda and Hezbollah were operated with the royal family's money but it was difficult for the United States to sanction them because the royal family monopolized oil.\nThe cycle of evil that commits terrorism abroad to maximize the fear of Islam and consequent discrimination and naturally trains the discriminated Muslims to become terrorists.\nEven more when superhumans called hunters appeared terrorism became more rampant and became more and more violent day by day.\n- Terrorism revives again!\n-During the Gate incident they did not concentrate on terrorism activities even for the sake of attack but now hunters who lost their jobs are cooperating with terrorism!\n- Suicide bombing is annoying but how can we stop terrorism by superhumans?\nThe Gate incident did not end the conflict. It only gave the conflict a reprieve for a while.\nAnd their main target was the gods of the other world whose patrons were an eyesore.\nTsk tsk. Even though the brothers managed to infiltrate and martyred terrorism they only suffered this much.\nAl Hasad head of the radical fundamentalist group ‘Warriors of Allah' with enemies in Iran clicked his tongue after seeing the results of the terrorism carried out by the Lionheart Federation.\nDidn't you destroy the damn machine? How come you couldn't blow up the central system?\n“That that... it’s so heavily guarded...”\nThe only good target was Yapi the lord who moved by unmanned taxi from time to time.\nOf course that terror was too easily intercepted.\nThis is what I'm going to do! For jihad (holy war) I have to kill the agents of those evil demons! How can I kill the demons of the West if I can't kill just one of their minions!\nAl-Hasad who said that did not believe that he could defeat Leon.\nThe world witnessed the battle between the Lion Heart King and the Great Khan.\nHow can you say something like this?\nIt's the Federation it's Nabal and even if it's just one of those guys they'll manage to conquer the world somehow.\nThat's why I aimed for the Holy Grail Knight who seemed to be of a lower rank.\nA machine that dares to rule over humans because the machine lord was an unacceptable mass of evil in the world of Islamic fundamentalism which defines the basic science of the West as the science of the devil.\nIt didn't matter that Yapi's high technology was from another world even from the planetary base.\nBut will it be okay? If they retaliate...\nWhat's the point of worrying about retaliation! Even the Yankees couldn't subdue us in the end——\n-Kooung!\nIt was then. The vine on which Al-Hasad had been was suddenly shaken.\nWhat what...!\nThis is Al Hasd's district. It was a secret area that even the government forces were not aware of. By the way-\n-Kick. Discovery of impure molecules.\nMechanical spiders began attacking Allah's warriors.\n* * * *\n- This machine's Night City will clear the terrorists in Iranian territory from the current time.\nIt was a declaration that was plastered on TV broadcast stations and the Internet throughout Iran.\nSimultaneously with this sudden declaration communications networks throughout Iran began to fail.\nCitizens were able to use only minimal internet and communications and the Iranian military began to have broken military networks and malfunctioning radars.\nand······.\n-Operation Night War. I will start\nFrom space they started falling toward the ground.\nArmed packages ejected from stealth strategic satellites which cannot even be recognized by current human detection technology except for Lionheart enter the atmosphere with pilots.\n- Support for Count-level war armament for Yacht Spinner. Pilot No. 13 McDeloff Pilot No. 19 Glaster confirmed.\n-Kick! Giggles (McDelof Hashimura Ohgent's response!)\n-Kick! Quirking look (Glaster Basilisk all-for-one response!)\nCount-class star iron armament. Pilots of the Kikkirook family rush into space with Yapi who is also boarding a count-class land battle weapon.\nAnd it's not just the three that are being put in.\n-2 squads of baron class support sub escorts. participate in the operation.\n-confirmed.\nThe near-perfect ground observation lens of the Yacht Spinner who commands them locates the enemies.\n-Check 13 camps of enemy fighters of Allah. Prepare for a bombardment.\n-Lord Yapi a number of civilians were captured in the enemy camp. Are you firing?\nAlthough the unmanned combat system of the Lionheart Federation is a machine it puts ‘human sensibility' into account.\nIt doesn't matter if they violate international law like a meal but they were excluding ways to incur the enmity of the absolute majority.\nArbitrarily invading foreign airspace and carrying out military operations is a reckless violation of international law but it does not lead to hostility among people.\nIf you add a little media control and emotional arming you will rather support the terrorists as well.\nSo the target should only be for terrorists.\n- The start of sexual law projection. Projects holy napalm bombs made by Vulcanus.\n- Yes. armament change.\nYapi changed his armaments and the armaments of the pilots into divine bombs containing the Holy Law.\nand drop.\n- Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa!!\nAmidst the pouring explosions residents screamed at the rising flames.\n-Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\n- Save people!\nBut they soon realized. That they were not hurt in the slightest in the flames that covered the whole city.\n-Hey how did this happen?\nThose who die in the bombing are only ‘guilty ones'.\nThe treacherous criminals who dared to harm the existence of the Holy Grail Knight. those colleagues. Only those involved were killed by the holy napalm.\n- Poetry my God...\nBecause of that miracle they inadvertently sought God. Maybe someone the god of the pagans.\n-13 hits completed. I will enter the enemy stronghold.\n- The enemy command must be captured alive. After torture and appeasement it will be brought to court and will be officially judged by His Majesty.\nthis is propaganda A warning to those who dare to point their teeth at Lionheart.\nThus Yafi personally went to the cave where the headquarters of Allah's warriors were located and was able to capture them easily.\n-Younglord. Through diplomatic channels the Iranian leadership is requesting an interview.\n- Change.\n[What are you doing!!]\nWhat is yafi in Iranian Rahbar's reckless scolding? and interjected.\n-Keep your body tight.\n[Uh why are you not the Lion Heart King...]\n- I stole the communication in the middle.\n[······!]\nThe Lionheart Federation has not yet established diplomatic ties with any Middle Eastern countries.\nIt is because they rejected the realm ruled by pagan gods claiming that the only god is Allah.\nIn the theocracy of Iran religious leader Rahbar had priority over the president so they could reject the Lionheart Federation for extremely religious reasons.\nThat's why the only diplomatic channel is the palace's direct line... Yapi snatched it from the middle.\nAs if you guys don't even have the qualifications to communicate with the Lion Heart King.\n[Uh why are you doing such an outrageous thing! This is terrorism! It is an act of violating the sovereignty of our Republic of Iran!]\n-This is a legitimate hostile act. This machine has the authority of ‘freedom of war' as a war knight who is the representative of the blacksmith god and has the authority to summon knights. This machine declared a ‘war on terror' and only slaughtered the terrorists in your country.\n[······!]\nHave you ever seen such stupidity! Iran's Rahbar shuddered at Yafi's tyranny which exists above the separation of powers.\nAs a religious leader he is also above the separation of powers and claims to be the representative of Allah but there was a big difference between the two leaders.\nYapi is an agent of a real God and a transcendent Holy Grail Knight who can wage war against the nation.\nRahbar is simply an agent of a self-proclaimed god established by old customs.\nHere in Iran he may be God's representative and an absolute being but from the Lionheart Federation's point of view the existence of God's representative is only seen as a fake that cannot even wield the power of God.\n[This is... terrorism! Terror!]\n- You guys. Terrorism is not something you can do alone.\n-My lord the communication isn't over yet.\n- I was told to listen. come on? What if you twist it? what can you guys do What else can I do besides humming Allahu Akbar hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha\nThese wild diplomatic remarks will not go anywhere. Because all the world's media outlets will be blocked by Yapi's ghostly control.\n[······Allah will not forgive you guys.]\nAfter that Rahvar's communication was cut off. Yafi has a displeased look on the case of fighters of allah terrorists.\n-Kick! Giggles! (Why are you like that my lord?)\n-It's disrespectful to mess around with organic matter.\nYapi was already aware of himself as a being who transcended the law and that is true.\nNo matter how much you think about it if your existential value is greater than that of organic matter why are you fooling around?\nAre you angry?\nIt changed the fate of the nation of Iran.\nAll networks in Iran were broken as of that day and international payment networks for oil payments were kicked out.\nIran protested against the sudden withdrawal of the payment network but there was nothing that Western countries as well as Middle Eastern countries could do as their servers were hacked and smuggling Iran's flagship industry was caught in the sea.\nIt is not uncommon for corrupt Iranian high-ranking leaders to suddenly have their data deleted or their secret accounts frozen.\nAs long as it is an organism that lives in the ecosystem called network it cannot endure in front of Yapi's order to leave the network.\nIn the end it took less than a month until Iran raised the white flag.\nThe collapse of the theocracy in which the United States and the Western world clung to each other and formed an independent economic ecosystem to survive despite all kinds of sanctions shocked many people.\n- If anyone touches this machine it will be fucked.\nNow the world just hopes that Lion Heart King's successor will not be that stupid mechanical Holy Grail Knight.",

It is a two-year short-term college but it is the world's most prestigious university that is frantic because it cannot be entered all over the world.\n[Therefore in the transaction process of the contract make an offering to the dragonia god through mutual respect──]\nThe reason why Pyongyang Lion Heart University became the world's most prestigious university in just three years of establishment is that it has the best professors of ‘professional specialization' such as Professor Dragon High Elf Horticulture Department Dwarf Practical Department Yapi Technical Engineering Department etc. There were also departments but the biggest reason is 'employment career'.\nThe core city of the Lionheart Commonwealth countries where the former Beijing County Lionheart Capital is located.\nGraduates here can get a job in the Lionheart Federation Knights as well as the Royal Knights if they excel.\nIn addition to that students from all over the world have no choice but to flock to the industries that lead the world in many ways such as federal new buildings and employment in the Byeol Steel Industrial Complex.\nOf course in order to enter this Lionheart University there is a premise that you must be a member of the pantheon.\nHari-senpai! Would you like to eat together today?\nNo! Where should we go today! Let's eat next time!\nReally? Then eat next time!\nLeaving behind the greetings from the undergraduates Hari hurriedly ran through the university grounds to the entrance. A familiar figure was waiting there.\nOh~ Hari are you done now?\nChief Kim Jin-soo!\nA middle-aged man with a shaggy beard. Now he is Kim Jin-soo director of the Korea Hunter Association who is slowly looking at the 40th line.\nHari quickly bowed her head toward manager Kim Jin-soo.\nPromoted to general manager! Congratulations!\nUh man. You were promoted to general manager last week so why are you here again to congratulate me? You called me then.\nEven so! To say that our Strategy Division's permanent manager Manager Kim is already the manager...\nWell... In the association the capture department is a firefighter role so it's a bit far from success.\nThe Hunter Association is basically an elite governing body.\nMost of the strategy department which is in charge of handling the tyranny of large guilds and incidents was created by low-end hunters so it is evaluated that they are ignorant guys who have not even graduated from college.\nManager Kim Jin-soo was able to get a high-speed promotion to general manager within a year after being promoted to deputy general manager thanks to Kite who assisted Leon with Hari from the beginning.\nIt means that the Korean government cares about the relationship with King Leon of the Lionheart Federation.\nHa-ri got into manager Kim Jin-soo's car and started running through downtown Pyongyang.\nYeah~ But isn't Hari the only college graduate in our strategy department?\nI'm not graduating yet!\nHarry is currently a college student.\nIt has already been 4 years since the gate incident officially ended.\nThe work of the Hunter Association the management agency of the hunters was reduced and the strategy department was merged into the hunter management department.\nNaturally the work of the hunters within the association disappeared but Hari thought that he had no work to do.\nEven though Hari is a genius as the youngest A-class hunter the reason why she chose to become a civil servant was because she wanted to help many people by attacking unexplored gates that were neglected for reasons such as economic efficiency and work efficiency.\n[I want to go to college!]\nWhen Hari resigned and announced that she would go on to higher education the association went into an uproar.\nHey~ When you said you were leaving the company the president of the association ministers and even the president came to stop you.\nUgh... I still feel sick to my stomach when I think of that time.\nFrom the standpoint of the Korean government Hari was a talent not to be missed.\nIn the battle against the Orc Continental Federation Hari was sublimated into a Holy Grail Knight that is a living saint.\nSince it is a special body that can produce holy power with only its own heart it was announced as a Holy Grail Knight of war and flame like Vulcanus and a Holy Grail Knight of the sea and waves which shook Korea.\n-Keu~ Is the Holy Grail Knight the second Earth also Korean?\n- Jumo! Get down!\nThe appearance of the Holy Grail Knight the second Earth after Goo Dae-seong the Holy Grail Knight made the whole Korean peninsula drunk with gukppong.\nIn such a car Hari tried to give up her civil service position for the reason of going to school so the president has no choice but to come and dissuade her.\nThey begged Hari to remain as civil servants even if it was an honorary position since they did not have to go to work.\n[axis! A proud saintess born in Korea. Hari Han the Holy Grail Knight was inaugurated as the Vice President of the Honorary Hunter Association!]\nEven while creating the position of honorary vice president that did not exist.\nHow are you honorary vice president?\nAh! Don't go wrong!\nWell how is it? At twenty-four you're treated like a field officer. Hari if you're just a little older you'll be able to pass the presidential election as well? Ah since Sir Koo Dae-seong is there it must be half-and-half.\nUgh the presidential election? There's a lot of talk about coming out as a proportional representative. I'm not going to do anything like politics!\nThat's a pity. I tried to become the chief of staff to the president.\nEven so the manager doesn't hire me as a secretary!\nWhile chatting about miscellaneous things they arrived at the Pyongyang terminal. An elven janitor approaching their approach.\nWhere are you going?\nWhen the beautiful elf manager in uniform smiled kindly Manager Kim Jin-soo said with a broad smile.\nHehe I'm going to Lionheart's castle.\nI see. Ah~ now I see that it is a diplomatic vehicle. If you go to the extra entrance you can use it with a free pass.\n“Yes thank you.”\nHa-ri clicked her tongue as she saw Kim Jin-soo whose expression stretched all the way to the end.\nIf you like it that much why don't you ask for a number?\nIs that...? I'm thirty-seven now.\nNo matter how many of them there are they're four years old. Do you want to be knocked over?\nAaghh! That's the problem!\nElves no longer spawn through World Trees. This is because when the population exceeded 100000 the Tribal Resurrection Project by the World Tree was stopped.\nEnough numbers of elves treemen dwarves and dragons have gathered so now they pursue prosperity through natural reproduction.\nThe problem was their age. No matter how mature they were they were at most four or three years old so according to legal interpretation they belonged to infants.\n-Why were we born 20 years ago?\n-If I were born now I would have dated adult elves!\nFrom the perspective of the Lionheart Federation the atmosphere was not particularly discouraged but according to social norms it was not easy to try dating with the newly born race.\nWell why don't you just wait 15 years?\nI'll be fifty by then!\nIt's an era where the average life span is 200 years but 50 is youth.\nThe distribution of blessed crops by the Lionheart Federation brought many changes to the world.\nOnce life expectancy has increased.\nIt's not that the Lionheart Knights didn't understand the concept of getting sick for nothing.\nThe blessed crops nurtured by the followers of Goddess Demera have now become the world's standard food.\nPeople began to be free from the disease and life expectancy naturally increased.\nBy combining Yapi's high technology and Shinseong technology rejuvenation and anti-aging programs are also provided to federal citizens and pantheonists so the era of young and healthy 200-year-olds has begun.\nThe world has gotten better.\nAs a Korean citizen who enjoys the changes brought about by Lionheart as the first priority Director Kim Jin-soo thought that there is no better time to live than these days.\n[The train is leaving soon. Passengers please pay attention to safety.]\nThe vehicle brought by manager Kim Jin-soo landed at the terminal installed in Pyongyang.\nHis vehicle designed to be compatible with and mounted on the high-speed magnetic levitation train is attached in three rows like other citizens.\nSoon the train departed and the maglev train carrying about a thousand citizens left Pyongyang.\nWhen 10 seconds passed I could already see the clear and clean sea in the middle of the west coast.\nAh~ There's a whale over there. They say they're starting to appear in the West Sea too.\n“Thanks to the Poma god the sea ecosystem has been restored a lot.”\nThe recent changes have been so fast and difficult to get used to but many people have been able to notice them.\nThe world is moving in a better direction.\n* * * *\nAs the continent was torn into 53 parts each of the continental states declared that they were the true successors of China.\nBut what is the meaning of authenticity that only talks about? They needed symbolism and Beijing the former capital and economic hub fits just that.\nIn the early days of the continental collapse Beijing was a battlefield for continental powers and was completely annihilated.\nThe Presidential Palace was blown up by missile bombardment the Forbidden City collapsed down to a brick and the scattered buildings collapsed.\nAlthough the Republic of Beijing the last victor took the city they did not have the money to rebuild the city that had been turned into ruins.\nIn the end Beijing was neglected and after the declaration of the Lionheart Federation its geographical value did not disappear so it became the No. 1 reconstruction city along with Shanghai.\nBeijing... no the royal capital has changed a lot too.\nOnly 15 minutes by magnetic levitation railway from Pyongyang to Beijing. After getting off the rails and starting to drive again the scenery outside the car of manager Kim Jin-soo is a large city with a different atmosphere from Pyongyang.\n“Since Lord Yapi was in charge of rebuilding I thought it would definitely feel like Night City.”\nBeijing··· Current Wangdao has a very different atmosphere from other planned development cities.\nCompared to cities developed with extreme urban convenience like Night City the royal road is more simple than you think.\nIt boasts a splendid and beautiful view but it forms a beautiful capital in harmony with low buildings different from modern megalopolises.\nHuh I think I know.\nI have never seen such a beautiful city view in Hari.\nThe kingdom of Lionheart was destroyed. The last city of mankind where the pantheon was enshrined was so beautiful.\nIt must have been that the city data Yapi had seen was used for reconstruction.\nWell it's like a medieval castle but there are all kinds of convenience facilities underground. There's even an amusement park right?\nI've been there too! I also participated in the commemorative joust.\nI'll have to go down sometime later. It's arriving soon.\nThe royal palace separated from the residential area is the residence of the majestic and splendid royal family.\nSeeing people wearing white priestly uniforms walking around and unmanned robots cleaning and working at the same time it is confusing whether this place is in the Middle Ages or the near future.\nThere are a lot of guests. From the British royal family to the Australian president and his wife.\nWhat about our government officials?\nI left first thing in the morning. Former President Andong-gil is also over there. They say he lives in this neighborhood these days.\nIn the Lionheart Palace celebrities from all over the world are numerous. Because today is an anniversary at the federal level.\nAh! Suho! Jaehyuk!\nHuh? Sister!\nSister Harry!\nThanks to that I was able to see a familiar face.\nI hear you two are having a hard time in Tibet these days?\nBecause there are still wild monsters left over there.\n“There are many monsters who have adapted to the natural environment and are camouflaged. Oh and I took a picture with the Dalai Lama?”\nOh! Really? Did you get an autograph?\nUnlike Hari who entered college Suho and Jaehyeok are active knight commanders protecting the borders and territory of Lionheart.\nThis was the case with most of the Naju 1st Knights but it seems that only Hari had a desire to go to higher education.\nI'm ready at the banquet hall right now. Noona should be in a hurry too? Sir Vulcanus and Sir Koo Dae-seong have already arrived.\nSir Yapi.\nUmm... Sir Yapi is a face I see every day.\nYapi is based in Night City and has dispatched his agents throughout the Federation. Right now Hari's professor at Lionheart University in Pyongyang was Yafi.\n“Hey the organic name is Han Hari. Is this the best?」\n「Huh! Sir Yapi! Why do you need to know quantum mechanics in basic physics in liberal arts class?! Ah!」\n“Isn’t that what Holy Grail Knights need to know by default? You seem to be saying that you can't see it? Aren't you saying everything is fine? But why aren't you following me? You only need to do what you are told to do well and review only what you are taught so why can’t you?”\n“Why do things these days have no guts? oh oh oh lack of power. Nooooo power. Today I will master quantum mechanics and next I will learn about the failure and re-proving of superstring theory.”\n「Buy save people!!」\n······My sister is having a hard time too.\nWhat is it? It's similar to the college life I know but something is different.\nThat's right...\nManager Kim Jin-soo taps Hari on the shoulder who makes a whining sound. He pointed somewhere with his finger.\nThere's Professor Yapi.\nHee!\nHari stunned and backtracked. However Hari soon witnessed the minimal body walking on eight legs struggling to crawl on the floor.\nHey Sir Yapi?\n-Let it go let it go organic matter.\nCarrreuk!\nA girl clinging to Yappy's torso and purring. Even though she is of minimal size since she has equipped her body with a divine atom the output of which is enormous Yappi is caught in her child's hand and is unable to move.\nOf course the child must be reducing his strength so as not to get hurt but there are not many opponents for that yapi.\nHarian!\nA silver-haired girl with characteristic blue eyes and swaying eyes approached Hari.\nYour Highness the Princess!\nReina Sphero Dragonia.\nA princess born to Lion Heart King Leon and magician Queen Beatrice.\nToday was Princess Raina's third birthday party.",

      "content": "Hari Han (2)\nA year and a half since the establishment of the Lionheart Federation. Hongbok was delivered to the federation.\nQueen Beatrice Alighieri Spero gave birth to a princess.\nReina named as the second princess following the kingdom's first official princess Carina the Grand Duke of Dragonia was named Reina Sphero Dragonia by combining the family names of Leon and Beatrice.\nPrincess Raina who inherited Leon's healthy constitution and Beatrice's intellect successfully (?) grew up under Yapi's ‘Princess Maker' program and is now overcoming Yapi who plays the role of a nanny.\nHarian!\n“Princess do you like it?”\nYeah! Masit!\nPrincess Raina and quite a few high-ranking officials had all learned their faces but among them Hari was the one who followed her well.\nEunya. Why does Unnya open her belly? Doesn't she dance?\nPa it's fashion...\nIt was when Princess Reina rubbed her face against Hari's belly button.\nOhhh! Princess it's been a long time since I've grown up!\nAh Vulcan's skin—\nHari who was delighted with Vulcan's voice stiffened as he looked at the glamorous beauties he wore on either side.\nThe...the two of you?\nSex-\nIt's done! It's done! It's not good for education! Don't do that in front of Princess Reina!\nIn response to Hari's reaction Vulcan kissed the two beauties on the cheek and told them to wait elsewhere. Hari covered Reina's gaze because her blatantly sinister gaze was directed at the beauties who had turned away.\nTsk tsk what are you so fond of? Growing up knowing everything isn't it? Sir Spinner.\n- We are still researching whether early sex education has educational merit.\nJjm! Jjm! Both of them jjm!\nAs Princess Raina who spends her childhood surrounded by these two people Hari thought she should visit the palace more often.\nBy the way Lord Vulcanus I hear you're famous in America these days. A movie has appeared.\n“I’m afraid to say that an actress with an amazing ass is appearing—”\nPetos! Please shut up!\n[Do you think he will listen to me?]\nbut. If that were the case there would not have been a Petos altar installed at each military academy and held regular prayer meetings.\nBy the way Sir Hari. Hmm...\nWhat what?\nYour breasts and hips are bigger than before. Wow~ You've become a pretty nice woman.\nSexual harassment sexual harassment!\nVulcanus was still there. This Holy Grail Knight from a medieval barbarian tribe was one of the most well-adapted to modern times but at the same time his values ??did not change at all.\nHowever thanks to his masculinity and strength he was enjoying his present life by scattering rumors here and there.\n[Don't take your eyes off it Vulcanus. I can't do it.]\nWhen Petos gave a word of warning Vulcanus smiled and raised both hands.\nDon't do that too much Petos-sama. I'll also cover up the objects of one night's play and bring them to bed.\nVulcanus tends to refrain from women's adventures against the same knights. In particular Hari is the Holy Grail Knight of Petos and Poma. No matter how Vulcanus was he couldn't be an opponent to be touched in a one-night stand.\nBy the way Sir Vulcanus do you have any thoughts of marriage?\nHmm? That's sudden.\nYou went to Lord Raihar's wedding last fall. There were some people who had weddings in the Knights of the Burning Sword.\nThe Holy Grail Knights the Knights of the Burning Sword under Vulcanus also got married and had children while adapting to life on Earth.\nIn particular men are a macho group that is perfected through marriage so the marriage rate among knights is particularly high.\nWell because I'm still young! I'm thinking of enjoying this eternal youth a little longer.\nReally? Hmm.\nWhy is that? Lord Hari.\nNo there are quite a few female classmates in our department who are kind to Lord Vulcanus. I thought it would be a big hit if I took him on a blind date.\nOhh~ I've heard of blind dates. What is it does Hari go out?\nNo all my classmates look like kids.\nIt was worth it.\nHari has been living on the front lines since graduating from Hunter Academy.\nAs a raiding party of the Hunter Association he fought against monsters was at the forefront in Leon's demon war and defeated Krann the Orc captain in the war against the Orc Continental Federation.\nSince she was the youngest A-class Hunter the youngest S-class Hunter and even the youngest Holy Grail Knight young male students in their early 20s would look like children to her.\n“If you hear about them going to the military or what something... haha.”\nGRARARA...! Well if you only look at real guys like me then you can't help but think that way when you see young people in blue!\n······.\nHari didn't say who she was thinking of Vulcan's exhilarating confidence.\n‘Well... if you look closely it's the same as Sir Vulcanus.'\nAlthough His Majesty is much more handsome.\nHmm? What were you thinking?\nYes? Ah ah...! I thought Lord Vulcanus looked very manly!\nGRARARA─!! Don't get too into it!\nWhile the banquet was being prepared the arriving knights joined one after another.\nSir Harry! Long time no see!\nIn addition to Lord Raihar Lord Galatan and Lord Tarhan of the Knights of the Burning Sword——\nHey hello.\nlong time no see.\nLong-standing guilds such as Lee Yong-wan the guild leader of the Firebird Guild and Ha Yu-ri the vice guild leader of the Korean 10th guild gather to catch up on their personal affairs.\nThat's right guild leader Lee Yong-wan! I heard you're getting married! Assistant guild leader Ha Yu-ri!\nHuh? How does Sir Han Soo-ho know about that?\nI see? It was a story only we knew.\nWhen Lee Yong-wan and Ha Yu-ri showed a curious reaction Han Su-ho sent a puzzled gaze to Yapi.\nHuh? When Sir Yapi sent the planner for congratulations and condolences he mentioned it... didn't he inform you in advance?\n······at all.\nLee Yong-wan's gaze turned to Yapi. Either that or not Yapi is hugged tightly by Reina and hangs limp as if in desperation.\nis it hacking\nIt's a hack.\nWhat is privacy in the Lionheart Federation?\nFortunately this super versatile robot doesn't abuse the information I know for personal use.\nEveryone talks a lot about marriage these days? Are you busy dating after the war?\n“Isn’t it our duty to build a family and give birth to descendants?”\nAlright then.\nIt was the moment when people from Earth and those from Lionheart were divided.\nBy the way did you hear? Recently there has been a story about Her Majesty's concubine registration.\nThe gaze focused on Vulcan's words. Not only those in the same seat but also several of the banquet guests glanced at him.\nUh... Your Majesty has already married Queen Beatrice—\nLeon is already married to Beatrice. But what about concubines? Raihar spoke before Hari's natural question was over.\nWell I'll have to bring in a few more concubines.\nEh?\nThis time Lord Galatan chimed in.\nThat's right. In the past they were busy with the installation by the imperial guys but isn't it an era of peace now? We should give birth to at least one more royal descendant.\n······.\n“Princess Karina has already grown up and it would be good for Princess Reina to have several siblings.”\n“······.”\nThe idea of ??increasing concubines and descendants seemed natural. Modern people including Hari and Lee Yong-wan were stunned but it was common sense to them.\nIs that... is it okay? Without Queen Beatrice's consent...\nHmm? I heard that this idea came from the queen first?\nYes...?\nThe expression of modern people has become more grotesque.\nThe queen is also a member of the royal family. You know the duties of the royal family. But the queen is the head of the Federal Magic Council and is busy researching gate dimensional magic.\nAlthough Beatrice was Leon's wife and queen she is a public figure contributing to the development of academic magic in a direction different from the sex law ranking second in the official ceremonial order of the Federation.\nIt is a well-known fact that after the end of the Gate incident the magic towers around the world receive academic exchanges and teachings centered on Beatrice.\nEven though she has two bodies she is busy so the direction to increase the royal family is to go through the concubine.\n“No are you okay?”\nWhat do you mean?\nThat... the order of succession to the throne... something like that is it dangerous? Isn't it?\nThe Lionheart's Lion Heart King is determined by the gods. Just because you're a royalty doesn't mean you become the Lion Heart King.\nIt was. In the first place successive lion heart kings were not made up of direct blood relatives.\nThe previous Lion Heart King and the current Lion Heart King were not at all related by blood.\nNo then you don't need to have many royal descendants do you? That... I've learned that the reason you need to have a lot of royal descendants is just in case for the succession to the throne.\nEarth royalty was for that reason.\nIn the past when the death of infants and toddlers was frequent and it was not known how accidents would happen they gave birth to a lot of royal children to prepare for the eventuality.\nHowever Lionheart is a system in which the gods choose the next Lionheart from among the Holy Grail Knights anyway.\nIt's not like Leon can become the next Lion Heart King just because he gives birth to a lot of royal grandsons so what reason did he bring in concubines to increase the royal grandson?\nFrom a great knight a knight of great qualities is born.\nah······.\nIf it's a knight the size of His Majesty Leon you can expect what kind of genius that child will become. Even if it's just His Excellency Carina right now.\nIt is the basis of genetics. Outstanding dominant factors passed down to their offspring... that wasn't necessarily the case but the probability would be much higher.\nIs it a concubine? Even if my daughter was 20 years old I would push her once.\nLord Raihar isn't your daughter two years old now?!\nSo didn't you say ‘If only I was 20 years older?' No let's wait 20 years. His Majesty will correct it even then...\n-Kick. Why 20 years? If pregnancy is the goal the age at which a woman's menarche begins——\nAhh! Everyone stop it!\ni can't follow Hari carefully covered Princess Raina's ears and carefully left.\n‘It's too bad in terms of education!'\nHow dare medieval knights openly talk about having a concubine in front of a child!\nHari hugged Rayna and looked for Leon but Rayna buried her face in Hari's arms and asked.\nHaryenya. Do you want to be a second mother?\nYeah?!\nGods tell me. The more mothers get older the more they become jotte.\n······.\nHarry stared into space.\n‘Poma-sama?'\n[I'm not the only one...]\n[Early education. cancer.]\n‘Sir Petos!'\nWhile struggling with the two gods Hari arrived at Leon's location.\nOh our Lady Han Hari! The pride of Daehan!\nEh? Mr. President?\nTo be precise former President Andong-gil. The first president of a unified Korea he has been residing here in the Lion Heart Royal Capital since his term of office is over.\nBy the way it was President Ahn who prevented Hari from leaving the association and appointed her as an honorary vice president.\nOi~ Princess Reina was there too.\nAndong-gil's grandfather...\nHeh heh heh.\nFormer President Andong-gil smiles as if Princess Raina is cute. Behind him he sees the blond man who had been chatting with him until just now.\nHanhari?\nAh yep! Your Majesty! You've only seen the gas after a while!\nOK.\nAbama maa~\nRaina soon escaped from Hari's arms and toddled with Leon. Leon hugs him.\n“I heard that Lord Spinner is taking care of it.”\nAyap...! Sir Spinner and Sir Vulcanus are talking about something bad educationally.\nHmm?\nLeon gave a puzzled look but Hari couldn't bear to say that he had come to talk about the project to increase the royal family with His Majesty's concubine.\nThen Your Majesty I'll leave.\nSee you again at the banquet.\nIt was when President Andong-gil passed by Hari.\n‘go for it!'\n‘go for it? What?'\n‘Chuck.'\nA good-natured grandfather President Ahn walks by with a smile.\n······.\nCouldn't it be... I'll move out of my seat so I'm telling you to use your strength doesn't that mean it?\n‘Ah no way...'\nHearing useless stories and reacting sensitively. It will.\nKuh keuhum...! Your Majesty where did Soyeon go?\n“I am Cheon So-yeon the commander of the Knights. Unless it is a private occasion please call me by an official title.”\nI-I will.\nIf it's Captain Cheon he's with Biche. He's working in the magic council hall built in the royal capital.\nCheon So-yeon is currently in charge of guarding and escorting the royal family as the commander of the Royal Knights.\nOf course Leon and Viche are not beings that need someone to escort them but ostentatiousness is a necessary law.\n“Chun Jin-soo the head of the new sword guild often asked me to come to Korea.”\nWell isn't Cheon So-yeon very sincere? She is eager to aim for the seat of the Holy Grail Knight.\n“Grail knight... hm?”\nHari tilted her head as if she had suddenly realized something. When Leon hugged Reina and sent her gaze Hari put on a very regretful expression.\nI... Your Majesty.\nWhat is it?\n“Why do I not use honorifics for titles such as Sir Han Hari or Holy Lady Han Hari?”\nIsn't that the Holy Grail Knight?\nAre you a living saint?\n······.\nLeon just looked at Hari as if he was speechless.",

      "content": "Cheon So-yeon\n...\nThe Lionheart Federation Magic Council is an academic institution that develops and discusses magic one of the three major technologies representing the Federation.\nThese magic techniques established by Beatrice the magician Queen of the other world where magic has greatly developed are enriching the lives of the federation to the extent that they are not inferior to Lionheart's spell and yakt spinner's skills.\nA university to train magicians was established and techniques from the Millennium Magic Kingdom which surpassed the immature magic skills of less than 40 years on Earth were being distributed in the hands of the dean Beatrice.\nAfter the Gate Crisis ended Beatrice was a ray of hope for the wizards around the world who predicted the downfall of magic due to the influence of the Holy Law so it is only natural that wizards all over the world are struggling to participate in the Federation's Magic Council.\nEarth magic is inferior to Holy Law. How many wizards were frustrated by Leon's rhetoric saying that magic is not a rule but just a skill and that with inferior skills do not dare to compare them with the power of a god.\nIn the end the wizards could not bear to downgrade their title to magicians and tried to protect their crumpled pride with the compromise of being a mage.\nAlthough Beatrice described it as ‘cute because she's young'.\nThen let's finish today's council with this. Thank you for your hard work.\nThank you for your hard work Queen Mama!\nCongratulations on Princess Raina's birthday!\nEven today the mages who have received the teaching are busily leaving to apply it to my research. Beatrice was delighted with the enthusiasm of her vigorous students for learning.\nIs it useful?\nCheon So-yeon the commander of the royal knights in the role of escort spoke with a puzzled look.\n“You mean teaching magic?”\n······I don't mean to ignore it. Compared to Seongbeop and Sir Yapi's technical skills it seems to be far behind.\nAbove all it is a system that cannot be operated without Beatrice the head of the system.\nHow long would it take Earth's magic technology to catch up with Beatrice?\nCertainly there are many parts of magic that are inferior to the divine method of the pantheon and Lord Yapi's. It lacks absolute performance and broad versatility.\nEnforcement of the concept of sexual law.\nversatility of technology.\nCompared to these two powers magic cannot defeat either one.\nThis is because magic is not an absolute force that enforces concepts nor is it a universal technique that everyone can use.\nNevertheless there were wizards in Your Majesty's world. They built an empire.\n... traitors. Traitors to humanity.\nAs Cheon So-yeon's eyebrows narrowed as she remembered the imperial electors Beatrice said with a smile.\n“Even though they betrayed the kingdom it is true that they established their own technology and culture. Unexpectedly people’s unique ideas lead the country’s development.”\nBeatrice showed her smartphone and said. A product of unique development created by mankind alone. After all Yapi's technology also came from it.\n“If you get too hung up on the sex and the skills given you will stagnate so you need an alternative.”\nIt was a pioneering plan seen from the perspective of the royal family and leader which Cheon So-yeon could not see.\nAs the queen of the Lionheart Federation she is leading the development of the entire human race in anticipation of the distant future.\n‘As expected... He's different from me.'\nCould this be the birth of someone who was raised as a born royalty?\nIt seemed to Chun So-yeon that there would be no bridging or overturning of this gap forever.\nAnyway it's surprising. I didn't know that Captain Chen would be interested in the path of magic.\n······Nowadays only Her Highness follows her.\nThat's a complaint I can't bear. Although she didn't show it Beatrice skillfully caught that subtle change in expression.\nDo you prefer Chen to follow His Majesty?\nThat... in the sense of training... that's right.\nBeatrice knows that Cheon So-yeon has been working hard for the past four years.\nHer goal is to become a Holy Grail Knight. She was chosen by Ariana the goddess of light and justice and Ventasis the god of darkness and vengeance to aim for the seat of the Holy Grail Knight the third Earth.\nIf that was a Lionheart knight it would be a natural ambition. Regardless of their status they walk the rigorous training path to prove themselves and raise their honor.\n‘But Miss Soyeon isn't a Lionheart.'\nshe is an earthling She is quite used to and trying to assimilate into Lionheart's ways but its essence is based on the modern-Earth mindset.\nThe reason why she wanted to become a Holy Grail Knight was the exact opposite of her ambition to pursue honor and glory.\nWhoops...\nQueen?\nChun So-yeon sent a cautious glance but Beatrice found this young knight girl very cute.\n‘Trying to become a Holy Grail Knight for love. Aren't they cute?'\n[It is a love affair that is noble even in the eyes of the original woman.]\nThe Holy Grail Knight is an immortal being. In other words they do not grow old and can live forever as long as they want.\nIn the past in Lionheart the Holy Grail Knights were defeated one after another while fighting endless orcs and demons but there is no threat to the Holy Grail Knights in the current Earth ecosystem just like Vulcanus shouts and walks around.\nChen So-yeon is nervous.\nBeatrice is the priestess of Fleur the goddess of dreams and death so she has already overcome her lifespan.\nGoo Dae-seong and Han Ha-ri are also sublimated into Holy Grail Knights so they can stay by Leon forever.\nOnly oneself must perish according to the set lifespan. It's so annoying I can't stand it.\n‘I'd like to encourage you but that would be a bit too much.'\nHe is a kind of love rival. Encouragement from such rivals even with good intentions is bound to be miserably received.\n‘Cheer up Cheon So-yeon. I'm rooting for you.'\nBeatrice's point of view is obviously a difficult point of view for modern people who take monogamy for granted.\nHowever she sincerely hopes that Lionheart's knights will work harder.\n‘Honestly it's hard because my body is sore every morning.'\n[It's a surprisingly realistic reason.]\nShe was the queen who desperately wanted to divide the labor against the Guardian of the Holy Grail who had infinite stamina.\n* * * *\nCorridor of Lionheart's Royal Castle. Cheon So-yeon opened her mouth on her smartphone while being greeted by the elf priest.\nYeah... I'm at work right now. Grandpa?\n[They said he went that way first. Is my daughter coming too?]\nYes. It's an escort for the two of you.\nThe target of the call was her father Cheon Ji-ho.\nHaving been parasitized by the body of Akasha the Grand Duke of Slaughter and living as a demon he has been repeating rehabilitation exercises due to the long-term aftereffects of parasitism.\nNow that there are no problems in daily life he is participating in public events like this.\n[I am proud of my daughter who always does well.]\nhuh···.\nSo-yeon answered awkwardly to her father who had been away for a long time.\nBut friendship is not lacking. It's just that we've been apart for so long.\nCome in carefully. I'll be waiting for you.\n[Yes I will go soon.]\nHowever as long as they missed each other deeply the two were sure that this gap would soon be narrowed. So thank you.\nA benefactor who helped me reunite with my lost family.\n-Doo-wook! Dou-wook!\nSoyeon returned to the banquet hall putting the mobile phone in her pocket.\nPrincess Reina's birthday banquet hall guarded by the Royal Knights including herself.\nUltima's knight Kim Jae-hyeok or Ariana's guardian knight Han Su-ho. Other than that academy classmates and prominent figures from large guilds.\nThe place to celebrate the princess' third birthday is more splendid than before.\nLooking at Princess Reina receiving everyone's congratulations I also thought of this.\nWill my child ever come to be celebrated like that?\n‘Ugh...! what! really!'\nMy face heats up thinking that I already drank kimchi soup. Rarely when Soyeon whose emotions were clearly revealed on her face was taking a deep breath a tall woman approached with a clicking sound.\nAre you working on a day like this?\nHis Excellency Karina...\nThe tall beauty in a fancy party dress was the first princess Carina Dragonia.\nShe offered a wine glass in her hand but Soyeon carefully refused.\nBecause I'm at work.\n“Huh if this work were a classic I would have taken a day off today and come back wearing a dress instead of a uniform.”\nFirst of all... I'm the escort leader.\n“The two of you have an assortment of escort knights.”\nthat's the case Karina smiled and pulled Cheon So-yeon's cheeks.\nGakaa?\nWell Lord Hari is quite my taste but I think Lord Hari is a good candidate. First of all aren't they knights who serve the same god?\nKarina is a Holy Grail Knight of Dragonia the god of gold and contracts and originally a Holy Grail Knight of Ventasis the god of darkness and vengeance.\nBecause she learned a lot from her Soyeon was able to build a good friendship with Karina.\nYou're very knowledgeable about longitude. Why don't you dive right in and see?\n······Please keep your dignity.\nKkeuk isn't it a bit ironic to ask the Grand Duke of Dragonia to keep his dignity?\nKarina giggled while playing with Soyeon's rustling hair.\nBy nature there are always a lot of people who are looking for good men and women. Those who prepare their perfect selves and promise the future always miss the timing.\nDid you say that to Hari-senpai?\nCheon So-yeon knew that Karina had carefully selected candidates for her stepmother. Among them the most powerful ones are Hari and herself.\nBeatrice had already been captured so now it was their turn. It's an idea that's hard to understand.\nSir Hari is the type who will do things the moment he thinks wow! without realizing it. Such an innocent type is the way to make a big accident.\nAre you getting drunk? I can't imagine not having my father.\n...is your Excellency all right?\nContrary to what Earthlings imagine there is no arguing over family succession in Lionheart. If you're greedy just fight and win.\nEven with a wild smile Karina gazed at her younger sister who was several hundred years older surrounded by everyone.\nAren't they the cutest of all? Having a younger brother at this age is no different than having a daughter. So try your best too.\nKarina banged Cheon So-yeon's butt! I left her surprised and headed somewhere for her.\nThe place she headed to was where Koo Dae-seong was surrounded by beauties and was confused.\n“I really don’t understand.”\nEven as Cheon So-yeon said that she headed somewhere. Towards Leon leaving the banquet hall.\n* * * *\nLeon was drinking champagne alone on the terrace. This is a place I often visit when I get tired of receiving guests from time to time.\nyour majesty.\nAre you Captain Chen?\nLeon offered a drink as Cheon So-yeon approached.\nWhy don't you bring something to drink?\n“Because I am at work.”\nA savvy guy.\nWhile drinking champagne Leon suddenly remembered the events of the day.\nCome to think of it Hari... No Sir Han Hari said. Why didn't he give me an honorific?\nAre you Harry?\nKuhk Jim was respectful to all knights but when you think about it he had a tendency to speak carelessly toward them.\nIt must have been a kind of familiarity. She must have been a proof of Leon's affection for the girl he had been following around with as a maid since he first returned to Earth.\n······.\nSo-yeon was surprised at herself for being jealous of even that. In any case Hari was receiving special treatment from Leon.\nyour majesty.\nhmm?\nHave you heard the concubine story?\nAh~ Is it a rumor in the palace? It's nothing new.\nWhen she heard the story Cheon So-yeon was nervous.\nI haven't qualified yet but I haven't been able to become a ‘saint' who can stand shoulder to shoulder with Han... Leon.\nIf this kind of story comes out already I wonder if I'm going to fall behind even more.\nIt's a common rumor in the royal palace. It's also common in Jim's world.\nLeon smiled as he remembered the past. In the past he was a true lover.\nHe kidnapped a priestess who swore chastity to the point of disobeying the moon goddess and made a covenant with him.\nHe endured the wrath of the goddess and went to the moon in order to be forgiven and built the temple alone from the foundation stone to the roof.\nThat great love story was also told as a fairy tale in Lionheart Kingdom and Leon kept only her by his side until he lost his first queen.\nIt was Cheon So-yeon who saw how determined Leon was before falling in love again so it was not easy to approach him.\n‘It was longing at first.'\nIn the past Cheon So-yeon was full of thoughts of revenge for the wandering magic sword that killed her mother and uncles.\nWhen Leon appeared many people were excited with longing for chivalry but So-yeon only focused on the function of the sex law.\nsex law. power of concept. If it were I would be able to avenge it.\n[You're rude girl.]\nWas it because of such an impure thought? The only person interested in her was Ventasis the god of darkness and vengeance who was even called an evil god.\n[I am the only one who accepts your outrageous deals. Despite your disbelief only I give you strength. Don't take that luck lightly.]\nVentasis offered her a deal. her soul in exchange for vengeance.\n[I affirm your revenge. The gift given to you will unite the darkness of destruction. Only I will make your wishes come true.]\nThe moment she accepted the deal and was about to pawn her soul as the incarnation of vengeance——\n[What are you doing great avenger.]\njust. It is the mind of a teacher who is concerned about the future of his seed.”\nLeon put down light for her. Even the blessing of Ariana the goddess of light and justice was brought to Cheon So-yeon.\n[Like when you lost ‘your daughter'?]\nLeon was looking at his daughter Karina whom he had lost from So-yeon. Because Karina also gave herself up to avenge her.\nSo at some point So-yeon also started to regard Leon as a ‘father'.\nJust as Leon looked over his lost daughter in So-yeon So-yeon also saw a lost father in Leon.\n‘But not anymore.'\nLeon got his daughter back and Soyeon also got her father back.\nThe two who looked at each other from each other like that finally got out of the old past.\nThat's how admiration developed into romance.\nIt was probably a natural phenomenon.\nWatching from the sidelines realizing that he is a knight you can respect and rely on and gradually becoming fascinated by that person and eventually developing into love is just like any other girl.\nUnlike the other female knights So-yeon did not give up on her romance and just kept it.\n“Your Majesty are you thinking of taking a concubine?”\nHmm?\nTo Soyeon's question Leon rarely hesitated to answer.\nLeon was clearly a medieval king of knights with ideologies alienated from modern earthlings but at the same time he was also a young man who died from overwork who preserved the common sense of earth.\nlove a woman for life Leon had already broken it so he couldn't say he wouldn't.\nWhat qualifications can he have if he who has already married his second wife is talking only in words?\nI. I'll try.\nto be by your side.\n······.\nLeon was speechless for a moment as he watched Soyeon staring at him with a determined gaze.\nI knew it but it was the first time I had heard it so directly.\nRespect me.\nI have no choice but to answer like this.\nAnd that was a sufficient answer for Soyeon.\nWhen I turned around with a faint smile...\nOh! So-yeon was here! His Majesty too!\nHe meets a red-haired girl. Soyeon stared blankly at Hari.\nSoyeon?\nLooking at the innocent saintess who is not fully aware of her own feelings——\nI won't lose.\n──Declare war.\n???\nSo-yeon left the terrace with those words. Hari raised her question marks as if she didn't understand the reason for the declaration of war.\nSo So Yeon-ah? What does that mean? Your Majesty? What was it?! Did I do something wrong?!\nKkeukkeuk.\nAnnit Your Majesty. Laugh but drink!\nLeaving behind Hari who was flustered not knowing his fault Leon complained to the gods.\nIt's scary. Being young.\n[Don't let your goddess permit you.]\nTowards the goddess who was inciting him Leon could only smile silently.",

Are you really a creature like yourself?\nWhen the final decision came I was stunned. Finally that fuckin' racist king of knights won! Fucked!\nAbove great being. What's your next plan...\nRaynald who turned his gaze to the Goblin Archdemon of Wisdom soon knew. The self-talk that flowed from the chattering Gob with his teeth gnashing...\nWow shit that's giginet...\nIn the midst of lamentation with many implications now even the great devil of wisdom has no means.\nBounce let's bounce! Don't you still have the magic to open the gate! Go back to the Demon Realm——\nAnnit. I'm not going back to the Demon Realm.\nyes?\nWhat if I don't go back to the demon realm? Where else is it simple?\nThe battle to determine the power of the Earth has already ended. Earth is now in the hands of the Lionheart Federation and the demons are to be hunted out.\ncan you survive there?\nEven if I go back to the Pandemonium now I will be dragged by the Pandemonium's conscription order! I don't know what that means!\nno way······.\n“Yes prepare for when they invade the Pandemonium!\n······.\nReynald couldn't bear to be confident of victory.\nWhen the demon lords have already slaughtered their sins where is there anyone who can stop the Lion Heart King?\nAs of the present time... the Pandemonium has been cut off!\n“Is that possible?”\nThe Orc Great Khan opened the way for the remaining Orcs to live! In other words when the Orcs are subtotaled to another world we escape from Earth by joining in!\nOh oh···!\nThe plan was plausible. Gob had the ability to create artifacts that could hide the demonic energy and if he hid his demonic energy and crossed the gate by sneaking between the orcs he would be able to escape the earth without fear of being requisitioned by the demon world.\n[What are these little guys?]\nBut I never thought I would be discovered by the Orc Gods.\n* * * *\n······!\nHe opened his eyes because of the rumblings that pierced his stomach.\nGreat...\nThe body reacts and vomits pour down the esophagus. Soon the field of vision opened and the hard floor was visible.\n-Kreu...!\nIt looks around with a growl like a wild beast. It is an unfamiliar landscape.\nThe earth is made of a hard material that cannot be compared with the earthen floor and artificial landscaping trees full of incongruity to be called a forest are growing here and there.\nFrighteningly tall structures stretched out to reach the sky and they rose in abundance on all sides.\n‘It's oddly familiar.'\nBut I don't know. memory is fuzzy I couldn't figure out why I was in this place.\nThere is only one fact known.\nMurka. Murka Ballak.\nonly his name. Other than that fragmentary memories and knowledge remained subtle.\nWhat is it? What is that?\nIs this a movie shoot?\nNeighborhood is noisy. When I turned my gaze I met eyes with a small creature. Water droplets immediately began to form in its small pupils.\nIgnore them and walk down the street. He focused his attention on himself but Murkha didn't care.\nJust when I was gathering materials to judge this situation as objectively and calmly as possible——\nWhat what?\nIs the sky... red?\nThe voices around you become urgent. The gaze toward himself who is a foreign object disappeared completely and everyone was looking up at the sky.\nHo-oh...\nThe world is dyed red. It's like a harbinger of great transformation.\nwhat······.\nAnd they saw The blue window that began to appear in his field of vision.\n[The end begins.]\nNew blue spears began to cover Murka's eyes.\n[The 44 races of the 1st advance party have completed the transition.]\n[987 warriors have completed the transfer.]\n[Depending on the blessing and oath the penalty of the warriors is enforced.]\n[Depending on the disappearance of the karma quota each god can additionally transfer or supervise his/her warriors.]\n[Map update starts. current version 1.0]\n────\n────\n────\nAt that moment the ground began to shake. As if there was an earthquake.\nAnd such a phenomenon was not confined to this land. The same phenomenon took place in all lands seas and skies of this planet.\nEven at the moment of the change of heaven and earth like the wrath of God a new message flew in.\n[A chaos wave begins.]\n[All intelligent lifeforms do your best to survive.]\n[Good luck. Innocent children.]\nIt was the voice of a soft woman.\n[Corrupt and perish. Death has fallen over your shadow.]\nIt was also the voice of an archaic devil.\n[Didn’t go after the fuckers. Embarrassingly the bastards who fell behind the first time I will change them all.]\nIt was the voice of a wild beast.\n???\nI was tilting my head at the incomprehensible message but some seemed to be aware of this situation like myself.\n- Jeobeok Jeobeok\nIt was then. Murka reacts sensitively to the sound of something approaching. His gaze turns round.\nA bone?\nThere are many bones that cannot be explained otherwise. Armed with crude swords and shields they began to stride forward.\nWhat is it? Hey filming... isn't it?\nhooked!\nAnd the skeleton's crude sword pierced the villager's abdomen.\nuh?\nIt was only when he saw the red blood flowing down that he realized that this was not filming.\nIt was a belated realization but is it fortunate that it helped others?\nAh ah ah ah!\nStarting with someone's scream running away and pursuing began at the same time.\nBone soldiers attack everything around them.\nAnd the deaths that hit the world didn't just come from sluts.\nKill-kill!\nI don't know what it is but kill it!\nWhat these monsters! Look at them getting smashed by this hammer breaker!\nLoud voices and screams come and go on a street full of chaos and a one-sided slaughter takes place and the end begins by an unknown blue window.\nThey seemed to know what to do.\nMurka was confused and the vague memories made her feel embarrassed... but if there was something decidedly different about him from the others-\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAA────!!\nThe beast roars.\nA loud roar gushing from the savage warrior full of muscles and shouts focused everyone.\nThe naked orc warrior began to destroy everything in front of him without hesitation.\ntear up! break it! smash it!\nBeast-like destructive power using the Orc's unique physicality shattered and destroyed the bone soldiers with their shields.\nKeuheek! Save the goblins!\nThen a goblin caught Murka's eyes.\nGoblin. A weak lazy weak race. It is a characteristic of a race that remains even in vague memories.\nNot to mention that goblin was a hunchback with a crooked back.\nOnly then will he be able to survive among his own people.\nThe goblins a weakling race were not a race to leave their own kind with disabilities alone.\njoy···!\nAside from that Murka picked up a large piece of scrap metal next to him. A vehicle with two wheels that is somewhat ambiguous even to be used as a chariot.\nIt was easily lifted by Murka's superpower and flew through the air.\nFuck!\nThe hunchback goblin instinctively noticed the flying two-wheeled vehicle and leaned over. A loud noise spread as a two-wheeled vehicle passed over his head.\n- Quaang!\nSkeleton soldiers crumbling after being smashed. Still the two-wheeled vehicle which had not slowed down drifted in front of a certain red-barded bone horse.\nYes... bastard...\nHorseman of the Red Barding. Likewise it was a pale-skinned knight clad in blood-red armor.\narticle?\nA strange feeling of displeasure reigns over Murka. He glared fiercely at the knight in red armor who was glaring at him.\nThis bastard... such an insolent beast. To face this Blood Knight Sturm Unchefest face to face.\nHe quenched his thirst by biting off the nape of the beast he killed by piercing it with a long spear like a skewer. It immediately amplified an unknown aura in him.\nThe evil that eats the living and turns them into strength. Murka snorted in the face of an evil force that made everyone roll their eyes.\n“It was a mosquito baby.”\nNeonooum...\nAt the insulting insult Stroom's cold blood seemed to boil with rage.\nA great night blood relative who ruled the world an aristocrat who even conquered the sun and a blood knight who dared to be a savage beast!\nSturm pulled the reins and turned the horse toward Murka.\n- < Blood Knight Lv.1 > Sturum Unchefest will engage < Orc Boss Lv.1 > Murka Balak.\nHmm?\nThe blue spear bothered me but Murka looked straight at the blood knight who was charging at him. And-\n‘What is this guy?'\nslow. No the momentum is lacking.\nSpeaking of a mounted charge it would add much stronger pressure and irresistible momentum——\n“To Lionheart...! Have glory!!」\nKuh...!\nMy head hurt for some reason. As if the lock had been locked by something the memory I was trying to pull out was blocked.\nYou sold one eye! Fool!\nBut it's not to the point of being hit by such a lame charge.\n·······?!\nit was an instant\nI grabbed the spear of the red knight who was charging at full speed and swung it with all my might.\nWhile holding on to the spear Sturm lifted up by tremendous strength was thrust straight into the asphalt road.\nKuhh?!\nClap at the same time as the collision! a sound flows Sturm desperately came to his senses and raised his spear but Murka's fist struck his arm.\n- Kwajik!\nSturm's arm bent at an odd angle from the punch.\nQuaaaaagh!\nYou're so weak.\nA fist thrust into the face as it sent a contemptuous gaze. In an instant his arm was restored and blocked with a regenerative skill called < Super Recovery > but he fell backwards in front of a fist of destructive power.\nIt's big?!\nfrom top to bottom. The boulder with muscles and tendons tautly contracted falls as it is.\nIn the shadow of death cast by his fist as hard as iron Sturum instinctively raised both arms to guard.\n- Boom!\nHowever even though he was guarded with his armor he was astonished at the shock and tingling that was transmitted. Her passive skill Super Recovery worked but the fist didn't end with a single hit.\n- Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!\nThe crashing sound of fists plunging down with overwhelming force.\nBy the second third fourth time the bone fragments were shattered and the arm could no longer protect his face.\nMurka said softly to the ‘knight' whose guard was released.\nDisappointing. You're not real.\n“Now let’s go to sleep——!!”\n- Kwak!\nThe thrusting fist pierced the asphalt road.\n[The Dark Vampire God Rakan's Warrior < Blood Knight Lv.1 > Sturm Unchefest was defeated by the Three Great Orc Warriors < Orc Boss Lv.1 > Murka Balak.]\n-Boss reputation increases by 10.\n-Boss level increases by 1.\nWhat is this?\nMurka glanced at the blue spears exploding in succession.\n[The sealing rate of the Orc Boss Murka Balak is 99.8%.]\n-Build an Orc idol to receive God's blessing. (Requires 1000 Reputation from the Orc Boss)\n- Level up your Orc Boss to become an Orc Great Boss.\n-Kill all warriors of different races except you.\nA list of unknown blue windows. But one thing was clear.\nTo stand tall as a loser by defeating all the great warriors of the gods other than oneself and expanding one's power.\nUnlike an Orc he was quick to grasp the situation and was able to grasp the battlefield of these artificial gods.\nJoe johnny merciful.\n[Sealed Survival King Goblin Gob wants to join your gang.]\n-Would you approve joining the gang?\n* * * *\nThis is the start of another story.\nAn opportunity given to foreigners who need faith and a planet to rule.\nThe arena of a lifetime where countless gods sent out the great warriors of their history as champions.\nIndeed who will be the winner of this great war?\nOrc Boss Murka!\nThe greatest orc champion in history and the great warrior protected by the three orc gods.\nWHAAAAAAAAAAA────!!\nHe let out a roar that started as a warrior again and the great survivor Goblin followed him.\nSeapod...! Boss! You survived today! Hey Raynald! Praise the greatness of the boss too!\nMu of course Master! The grace of reaping me with no memories! I will definitely repay you!\n“Murka! Murka! Murka!”\nSurvival King Gob! Will he be able to survive to the end?\nIt was summer.",

      "content": "Side Story Leon and Pleasant Friends (1)\nThis is what happened when I was 17 on the path of training in another world.\nA journey of asceticism in search of quests.\nIn order to become a Holy Grail Knight who is said to be the pinnacle of this world he must perform a quest in the eyes of the gods.\nThey say that if you vaguely wander around the entire kingdom and raise your honor diligently they will come to you on their own.\nHowever in order to succeed as a knight in this harsh fantasy world you have to go around alone and raise your honor.\nI'll have to try something!\nNow that I've come to the fantasy world I should take a look at Sword Master!\nIt's a body that doesn't even go to church but well I'll be able to do it somehow.\nSir Leon who do you believe in?\nIt was a question from Antalk an attendant I met during my travels. At this Gildus and Gunlar the tree man next to him also pricked up their ears.\nHehe how can you say that you serve only one person? All the gods who protect Lionheart are respectful.\ngive exemplary answers. Religion in this world is based on polytheism. It's not like there are tens of thousands of gods in India or Japan.\nAnyway there were quite a lot of gods and there were many people who believed in all of them and made offerings to them. If you see that there is a holy law that uses divine power there may be real gods.\nWell since it's a different fantasy world there's nothing strange about it.\n“As expected he is a model of chivalry. I must make an offering not only to my Petos-nim but to others as well.”\n······As it is.\nAnyway what are the inhabitants of this world? Too fanatical for invisible gods. In this world faith is the default so I am tired of arguing with no religion.\nAnyway I witnessed the slaughter of the barbarian tribes that Gunlar held captive in the car that responded moderately!\nUgh Lord Gunlar! What are you doing!\nHuh? Why is that Sir Leon?\nGildus put on a look of genuine disapproval. Yamma no matter how long ago we killed each other but what if we kill a prisoner just like that?\nAh...! You forgot me.\nWhoa...\nYeah you can't just kill people like that dude.\nSoon the serf festival invented by the great grail knight Sir Gratas will be held! Every city will not have enough serfs to kill so it is necessary to provide entertainment!\n······what?\nAren't they crazy?\nIt's really hard to enlighten another world...\n* * * *\nThis world was to say the least a complex and subtle world.\nKnight! It's Knight!\nKnight! Please bless us!\nKnights and nobles who have vested interests in society are enthusiastically supported by free people. They sprinkled or offered flowers on the path of the knights and kissed the ground on which their horses trod.\nsomething is a little too much I knew that the knights were respected even in the Grand Duke but... I thought it was just because I was the enemy of the Grand Duke.\nIf you're in front of a high-ranking person isn't it the way even a back alley beggar prostrates himself?\nKyaaaak! Knight! Look over here!\nHowever a knight here... boasted a popularity comparable to that of a superstar.\nYou just ran into me! You saw me! The blonde knight saw me!\nOh I didn't see it.\n······.\nHahaha! Sir Leon. How are you so nervous?\nGildus tapped me on the shoulder. The impact transmitted through the armor is considerable.\nGrunt... it's nothing.\nHeh heh heh this guy seems to be doing this for the first time. Well since he's never served as a knight of the kingdom it's possible.\nIn my case I skipped the courses leading to the pilgrim knight the kingdom knight and the training knight and went straight to the training knight.\nThe direct descendants of the great family are taking this kind of consideration in order to reduce the time spent serving as knights of the kingdom and pilgrimage but that doesn't mean they suck at it.\nIf something happens to the kingdom I have an obligation to serve as a member of the great family.\nAnyway wave to the free people. You seem to be the most popular here.\nAs Gildus said he smiled awkwardly and waved his hand and the reaction of the citizens intensified.\nhmm.\nAt that time unlike us on horseback Gunlar a tree man who was walking around scratched the flower in his hair.\nWhy is that? Gunlar.\nWhy do humans... why do they welcome flowers? Do you like flowers?\nWell isn't it like that because it's usually precious?\nUsually crops are planted in the land where flowers will grow.\nIt is my own interpretation that it is a luxury to grow flowers that cannot be eaten so it is not to show sincerity by gifting them.\nRight.\nGunlar nodded as if he understood then pulled out a flower from my hair and handed it to me.\nSincerely the first generation.\nNo after all this is your hair.\nGunlar who is on a journey to become a forest sage knew a lot but sometimes he showed such an erratic appearance.\nNow! Let's go to the lord's castle! The baron of this territory has prepared a grand welcome ceremony!\nWhoa~ I can barely eat normal food other than beef jerky!\nIt was a tea that I was tired of beef jerky. It's been awhile since I've had a proper meal.\nWelcome honorable knights on the path of training. I am Randolph the lord of this place.\nBaron Randolph the owner of the estate welcomed us.\nOrdinary wandering knights who have gone on a wandering road are said to be treated roughly even when they enter the lord's castle but this is because they haven't proven themselves.\nHowever Nana Antok and Gildus are honorable knights on the path of training. Since they were the ones who embarked on a journey to become Holy Grail Knights it seemed that they were treated differently.\n“By the way the barbarians who were brought as prisoners were well received.\nHaha it's nothing. It's just a coincidence that barbarians invaded the kingdom's borders.\nGildus trembled with humility as if it was nothing. Well three knights and one Treeman slaughtered hundreds of barbarian warriors and took over a hundred prisoners.\nI did it too but I realize all over again that we are post-humans.\nThey're the ones who recently planted them at the border. They robbed the crops of poor people and burned the wheat fields.\nThat... the people's grievances must have been unreasonable.\nThat's right. So I escorted the victims to the temple and exempted them from paying taxes.\nIf you haven't harvested the crops you'll need relief so please request it from the royal capital. The Argentinian Majesty Lionheart also has a relief knights.\nHow can the knights of the royal capital be tampered with? We have to end it as far as possible. Fortunately my wife is the priestess of the goddess Demera so she can take care of the wounded.\nSomething... is a bit awkward.\nUm aren’t lords like that in the original fantasy?\nAre you the people? Aren't they all pigs? I mean pay taxes or something!\nAll the vested interests should be stabbed to death with bamboo spears! Revolution to those dirty lords!\nA wandering protagonist punishes greedy nobles and saves the people... Well that's a common cliché.\nNo of course there must be a proper lord! However the lords I encountered while on the path of training were all genuine people.\nThere's a chance that one or two bastards will come out but since they're all so nice I wonder if they're doing something evil with their ear holes that I don't know about.\nReally awkward this medieval fantasy...\nI had a rewarding time with Yeongju telling stories of martial arts that occurred during the trip and news of the region.\nThe skill of the chef who said he had learned to cook in the royal capital was impressive.\nBy the way Sir Gildus and the wise inhabitants of the forest. If you don't mind why don't you enjoy the festival?\nYou mean the festival?\nMy ears perked up. Come to think of it the Grand Duke held a festival every year to commemorate the subjugation of Dragonia the progenitor dragon.\nSince it was an achievement made by Zeke Dragonia the founder of the Grand Duchy the citizens of the entire Grand Duchy enjoyed it.\nBesides that there was another big festival but I couldn't participate because only citizens who had come of age could participate. In terms of education are children under the age of majority not allowed to participate?\nI still wonder what it was-\nOh! You mean the serf festival?\nOh really.\nAntok's gaze turned to me.\nCome to think of it Sir Leon started his training as soon as he had his coming-of-age ceremony right? So isn't this the first serf festival?\n······.\nAccording to the kingdom's statute minors are forbidden from participating in the serf festival. Hahaha! Is this something Sir Leon must participate in to become a true adult?\n“Leon. The serf festival.\nThe eyes of the old man and the men are smirking to the point of irritation. What the hell is a serf festival?\nHmm it can't be without the knight experiencing the serf festival! The great Duke of Dragonia Confucius is experiencing his first serf festival in our territory! We'll have to prepare this much bigger than usual!\nNo so what is it?\n* * * *\nserf.\nCultists serving evil spirits... that is those who enslaved the barbarians.\nThe cultists and savage aliens scattered around the Lionheart Kingdom have long been a nuisance.\nThe kingdom has constantly fought against them and even when the empire has a policy of embracing the aliens the cultists are annihilated! claimed\nNow that I think about it I think that there is no such thing as this country...\nWe have held a serf hunting festival for you. Under the watchful eye of Dina the goddess of the moon and chastity the score will be divided according to who hunted more serfs.\nyes?\nMy lips trembled at Baron Randolph's words.\nDoesn't that mean you're going to hunt humans now?\nI knew it would be like this! savage medieval bastards!!\nFreeing serfs in the woods to hunt? Raise your score with your head? Is this really something a human mind can do!!\nUh how... how could you do such an outrageous thing?\nSir Leon?\nI can't stand it any longer! I will enlighten my savage medieval bastards! I will shout to them what human rights are!\nEven if no one listens in an age when human rights have become a vulgar joke!\nI must scream!\nNo matter how much prisoners of war they are they will kill those who have life and free will as their prey! What color is your blood!\nEveryone's eyes are on me. Not only the knights and nobles who participated in the hunt but also the serfs hanging their heads in despair.\nAll knights are those who defend justice and the law and run as fast as they should! Considering life so carelessly and harming it for amusement is this really chivalry! You guys are not a dog riding a horse!\nYes that's right!!\nOne of the serfs jumped to his feet. As if awakened by my appeal he pointed his finger at the knights with a bright face.\nI don't have the right to persecute people just because I ran a few errands for a dubious self-proclaimed goddess who didn't know where she came from!\nNo such a logical serf in this age?\nThe world's economic and social inequality continues because of your archaic royal dogma! Society needs self-governing communities by voterism to progress!\nno this is it? No way... no way?\nMajoritarianism by the absolute majority and a trade union community are the most ideal political systems! Supreme executive powers must be granted by the masses!\nOh how can this be! I may have witnessed the revolutionaries of our time!\nA serf with ideas and beliefs hundreds of years ahead in this savage Middle Ages? Perhaps protecting and preserving the spirit of this era is my role——\nThe killing of free people the abduction of women the murder of infants and mutilation of corpses. These are the sins the author committed on our estate.\nHail Lionheart!!\n-Suddenly!\nIt was a savage medieval era but it was a desirable era in which strict punishment was praised no matter how excessive it was.\nThe violence inherent in the system...! I am being oppressed.\nIts snout did not stop until its head was blown off.\nafter······.\nIf you're not careful it'll turn into trash in no time. It's like the fucking middle ages.",

      "content": "Side Story Leon and Pleasant Friends (2)\nSir Leon. Say it again.\n·······.\nGildus and Antoc's eyes and expressions pouted.\nYou want me to say it again?\nLife and free will are precious...\nPuhahahaha!\nTwo people laughing. They didn't stop laughing until they were about to run out of breath.\nOur blood is soooo...! What color is it?!\nThat's right it's red!\nStop it.\nI'm sorry Hash world~\nshit. Many people 10 years older than me persistently tease me for getting one.\n“Hehehe what kind of greenhouse did Prince Leon grow up to be so naive?”\n...Isn't that the son of Lord Gildus and the count's family?\nRegarding your status you are also a high-ranking nobleman Confucius in response Gildus pounded his chest and said confidently.\nMy family is an honorable battle aristocrat who defended the kingdom's borders as a Margrave. Their actual combat experience is different.\nIt is said that the battle aristocratic family which is in charge of protecting the frontier from generation to generation has a lot to fight against the savages. As such it seems that he knew well about their ferocity from a young age.\nMy family has been blacksmiths for generations. It's close to Cheolsan so there was a lot of interaction with the dwarves.\nSir Antoc was from a commoner. His innate dragon power was so great that the local lord provided the necessary equipment for the journey and he served as a knight of the kingdom before embarking on the path of training.\nHe was already married with a child but if he was a savage he would tremble.\nThe Grand Duke of Dragonia is far from the barbarians. That's why I heard there are few serfs. But still Sir Leon's innocence seems a bit excessive.\n·······.\nDid you know that I am Barbarians are not usually chewy.\nWho would have known that they would be crazy people who would commit murder and plunder as if they were eating human sacrifice and even cannibalism?\nFurthermore like the fantasy medieval they are said to be more vicious because they are the ones who serve the evil god. It's understandable that adult food eats people.\nCheolkeolkeol. Instead isn't Prince Leon's hometown bordering on the Orcs' habitat? I bet he didn't even say mercy to those beasts.\n·······.\nI tried my best to keep my mouth shut at Lord Randolph's words.\nActually... I tried. Let's trade with the thugs next door and get along well with each other.\nBut I didn't know that bastard would try to kill me out of nowhere. They're not warriors they're just beasts beasts.\nBy the way how was Gunlar? Didn't he live near the World Tree fighting with elves?\nI try to turn the question to Gunlar. He scratched his head and talked about his hometown in his characteristic slow tone.\nThe forest is quiet. It's peaceful. Except for the occasional elves... who catch breeding males.\n······The town is still there though?\nThey are a people of peace where horses harmonize with nature but there is no tribe as promiscuous as they are. They are very combative.\nI raised my hand and asked Gildus who was trembling.\nElf... messed up? Are you saying?\nAh don't you know? Elves aren't easy to conceive by nature and male elves don't increase in number because they lack sexual desire. So if Irmin the goddess of the forest bestows His protection even a different race can conceive.\nOh is that true?\n“Besides they prefer strong men and often kidnap knights. Sometimes half of the knights of the county are taken to the forest of elves? Well I persuade half of them to take them.”\nshit! Why are there no elves in the forest next to my house! Wasn't the basics of the fantasy of Gogaeng an elf forest next to it a dwarf mountain in front and a dragon rare in the back mountain?\nKeuheum... Sir Gildus. I want to visit Sir Gildus' hometown sometime.\nDear Arthur. Do you want to hug an elf like your great-grandfather?\nRather good.\nSir Antoc?\n······ Farmers.\nAnyway we pass the time with small talk and Gunlar is writing something.\nWith the wooden board he always carried whenever he had time he would engrave records on the wooden board and carry it around with him.\nWhat did you write down again this time?\nThe words of a dead serf. An interesting thought.\nWhat's interesting about that worm?\nMajoritarianism by the absolute majority the idea of ??a trade union community. Equal distribution of power to the majority. Interesting.\nIt would certainly be interesting to a scholar. I killed it but the serf's words were the foundational ideas of democracy.\nTo think that such an idea was extracted from a medieval fantasy serf would lead to a democratic ending.\nHeng...! That's bullshit!\nGildus seemed to be full of energy.\nThe right to rule is sacred. It is a right granted only to those who have proven themselves through endless self-discipline and refinement. How can the ignorant people share power?\nIn response Baron Randolph also agreed.\n“Lord Gildus is right. The people are by nature neither rational nor rational so there are many cases where they go wrong. They just do their job faithfully.”\n·······.\nWell it was a story that was hard for me to relate to as a democratic citizen until 18 years ago. The aristocracy here has a great sense of choice but a strange sense of duty to the people? I mean that's faithful.\nThe people work hard on commerce agriculture and urban development the nobles work hard on management and policies and the knights become strong fences to protect the kingdom.\nIt was a very idealistic role theory but does this really work?\nRight now even Gildus is the son of a Marquis but he has been a strongman who has been fighting barbarians since childhood and even though Baron Randolph is treated as a ‘child' by the citizens he sends his wife and daughter out to take care of them like their own children.\nwhat? Isn't this the savage Middle Ages I thought it was?\nIn any case the citizens who came to the amazing festival where he put vicious criminals and serfs into the hunting grounds and wondered who killed them better shouted It was in the middle of the street.\nSir Leon! Sir Gildus! Sir Antoc!!\nAt that time Baron Randolph rushed in. He visited us the participants on the third day of preparation for the serf hunting contest.\nBaron Randolph. What are you doing?\nAre you going to participate in the serf hunt again?\nAt the question of the two Baron Randolph shouted as if he couldn't control his anger.\nThese damn serfs have run away!\nWhat!\nUnbelievable!\nBaron Randolph's words shocked the two of them. That's right... I want to be like that too. If we continue like this we will all die anyway so we will try to escape.\nIt's like these miscellaneous things that don't even know how to do it! How good I've been!\nyes? what do you do While eating a meal with water mixed with sugar and salt?\nI even gave you a chance to wash away your sins but are you going to end up in the arms of the evil spirit!\nThey don't even deserve forgiveness! Let's chase them!\n·······.\nFirst of all it seems that the way to cleanse one's sins in this world is to rip out the soul and undergo purification in the afterlife managed by the goddess of death after death.\nEven if they died as serfs they were given a chance to cleanse their souls of sins so Lionheart's knights considered it rather mercy to brutally kill serfs.\nNo matter how many times I think about it they are fucking crazy.\nAnyway we decided to go out to track down the runaway serfs. It felt like they were doing something for the territory for free but Gildus and Antok acted like it was natural so I joined without a second thought.\nWhat about Gunlar?\nThat fellow is slow and not suitable for a chase. Shouldn't we hurry after them on horseback and tear them limb from limb?\nLook what Gildus is talking about. It's brutal it's brutal\nAnyway Gildus who had done a few missions to track down the serfs in his childhood skillfully tracked down the serfs.\nSoon four knights and twenty yeoman riders including Baron Randolph pursued the serfs and caught them trying to cross the river.\nExcuse me! We'll have to dig their heads before they cross the river!\nBaron can't you make those words... less bloody? Why did the aristocrat investigate the head...\nAnyway I opened my hand to the yeoman rider thinking that they would run away if I continued like this.\nHey give me a bow.\nyes?\nAren't I from the people of Jumong? One bow shot terribly.\nI tried to shoot them with the Yeoman Rider's bow but they stumbled and widened their eyes.\nNo give me a bow. What are you doing now?\n······Nari. How can an honorable knight try to use a ranged weapon?\n???\nwhat is this again? What about ranged weapons? What would you do if you were a mounted archer and disrespected ranged weapons?\nWhat's the matter with the ranged weapon? Hurry up and give it to me?\nI'm sorry sir. I cannot give you my bow even for the sake of your honor.\n???\nNo weren't these color wheelers crazy about classism? Why are you stretching out? However it was not only the Yeoman riders who were curious.\nSir Leon. Why are you trying to use such a lowly ranged weapon?\nThat's right. If you're a knight you should think about defeating the enemy bravely with a sword and spear.\n······ No serfs are crossing the river right now. What do you mean by catching them other than ranged weapons?\nAt those words Gildus and Antoc raised their jousting spears. No you're doing a jousting spear charge here?\nTo Lionheart...! Glory be to you!!\nBlacksmith's Guardian! Protection to your rider!\nBoom!\nWith an incredible roar the spears flew through the air.\nLarge jousting spears that blew air over distances of hundreds of meters and pierced the backs of serfs who had barely crossed the river.\n-Pak!\n-Oops...!\n- Hee hee!\nThe serfs who had been pierced by the spears fell limp. cried Baron Randolph.\nRiders shoot them with their bows and kill them! Let not one of them be sent alive!\nOn the other side of the river the yeoman riders rode up and fired their bows. Some died but some survived and fled into the woods.\nHurry up and chase them! Cross the river and they'll catch them soon!\nLord Leon throw a spear! This will be good target practice!\nWatching the two men who pierced and killed serfs by throwing their spears at a speed that far exceeded the range of a bow I followed along dumbfounded.\n-Quack!\nthis is real\nSometimes I wonder what the knights of this world are doing.\n* * * *\nDamn it!\nBaron Randolph banged on the tea desk in anger. The sturdy wooden desk is cracked.\nDamn the barbarians! You dare threaten us there!\nThe pursuit of the runaway serf was only half successful.\nThey succeeded in slaughtering more than half of the serfs who had fled across the river into the forest but on the way barbarians came pouring in.\nIt can't be helped. I can't believe I met their tribe without luck.\n“It was right to retreat there.”\nAlthough Gildus and Antoc were arrogant they gave reasonable answers. Yes it was fortunate that I had the reason not to charge head-on against 5000 barbarians.\nWe can't end it like this! We have to slaughter them!\nI had no choice but to step in to calm Baron Randolph's seizures. Gildus and Antoc are saying that they will raise their honor in the midst of this...\nCalm down baron. There are no knights in the estate except the baron and us. Right after the busy farming season it is difficult to mobilize soldiers.\nThe baron's forces consisted of 40 yeoman riders and 100 gnostic soldiers. In addition it is difficult to mobilize soldiers because it is the holiday season and even off-duty soldiers have to be mobilized to guard the territory.\nThe actual troops that can be mobilized are all 40 commoners on horseback so why are they going to war with 5000 barbarians?\nNow is the time to fortify the walls and thicken the defenses.\nWhoops don't worry Sir Leon. We have 20000 armed forces.\nyes?\n* * * *\nKalash the chief of the barbarian tribe who serves the beast god mobilized 5000 tribal warriors to rescue the captive tribesmen and burn the hated Landolph estate.\nThey were aware of the strength of the Randolph Manor from the tribesmen who had escaped the manor and were convinced that 5000 warriors would be able to annihilate those hiding behind the wall.\nChief! Chieftain!\nAt that time the tribesman who had been sent as a spy approached Kalash and reported.\nOkay what did you find out?\nWow the kingdom bastards are supplying 6kg daggers!\nwhat?\nKalash expressed doubt at the sudden supply news.\nA 6 kg dagger? Where in the world is there a dagger weighing 6kg?\nAmong the great swords used by the warriors of the tribe the largest weighs about 6 kg. A weapon of that level would be a large weapon wielded by great warriors. That kind of weight is called a dagger?\nAre they crazy?\nNot only that. Rumors abound that Baron Randolph is mobilizing an army approaching 20000!\nHa...! Only 20000 people in the Baron's Territory? You're bluffing.\nAnd lastly... It's a story about annihilating 5000 of our troops with 300 troops. He even boasted that if the war situation moves as he reads it would be about 90%.\n“Surrounding and annihilating 5000 people with 300 people?”\nAt those words the inside of the tent started to stir.\nWhile the central unit is engaged in defensive battles their elite unit surrounds them with both right and left wings. When the absurd tactical plan of annihilation came out everyone was even wondering.\nNo matter how crazy the knights of the Lionheart Kingdom are are they carrying out such a reckless strategy?\nAfter thinking about it Kalash felt the hairs all over her body stand up.\n6kg daggers 20000 troops 300 units and 5000 siege units.\nAfter putting all this information together the conclusion came out to be a very realistic nightmare.\nJi retreat now!\nChief? What do you mean by that!\nWe need to get away right now! Holy shit! Too late!\nEveryone looked at the chief of the Kalash tribe in disbelief but only he spoke a confident conclusion with fear-filled eyes.\n300 knights are coming.\n* * * *\nFortunately there was an order of knights who toured the kingdom near Randolph's estate.\n300 Thunder Knights of Wolves one of the Holy Grail Knights the strongest armed group in the kingdom.\nAs the best knights of Ultima the god of sky and thunder they willingly responded to Baron Randolph's request and ran nonstop day and night and immediately engaged 5000 barbarians.\nTo Lionheart...! Glory be to you!!\nThe knights of the Thunder Knights charged and shattered the front of the barbarian army and used their mobility to break through with the left and right wings. As it was it caught the left and right sides of the enemy central army and completed the encirclement.\nAnd the most elite knights including the captain of the knights dug into them.\nAnd then the unprecedented massacre began.\nThunder and lightning rang from the sky devastating the area and it took less than 6 seconds for the savage tribal leader Kalash to become a black mass from the lightning strike.\nThe tactic adopted by Baron Randolph in this battle the encirclement and annihilation formation was highly evaluated and studied down to posterity as the most effective tactic for the enemy's invasion.\nA talent that transcends the times was born here.\n·········\n······\n...\nNo fuck this it's not just that they destroyed everything with strong knights. It's a tactic and a strategy.\nArticle because that's possible!\nLionheart Kingdom is peaceful even today.",

A time when I was still lacking in faith.\n[Huh-huh... I was even surprised that my knight had a lot of strange thoughts.]\nIn his early days as an acolyte knight Leon was not a devout and honorable knight even in empty words.\nHe was a foreigner who was imbued with the culture and civilization of the earth and such views and ideas made it difficult to adapt to other worlds.\n[However you were an honorable and good knight. Your goddess has watched you since the days of your disbelief.]\nAriana has been watching Leon for a long time. He had a somewhat different concept from other knights and nobles but he knew that his actions were based on goodness.\n[Whoops I still remember. When Gildus and Gunlar defended the village from the orcs my knight ran alone to save them.]\nHe was willing to see his bravery indeed.\n[Leon. my dear knight You were my most shining knight.]\nThat is... a glorious word.\n[Now it is time for the children to wake up. Your goddess respects the privacy of my knight.]\nAfter saying that Leon noticed that the goddess had averted her gaze. It's because the gods and Leon are so closely connected that if they don't intentionally break the connection like this they'll end up sharing even the smallest things.\nAt this point he wanted to become something beyond the demigod but Leon had no intention of doing that.\nUm... are you awake already?\nThe seat next to it is bustling. The thick blanket rustled and a red-haired woman rose from within rubbing her eyes.\nWhoaaam~\nHari stretches wide. It wasn't very dignified for the first empress of the empire but she thought she would now.\nUh can't you sleep in today?\nCome with me...!\nIt was then. A girl bursts open the door and walks in. The cute girl with red braided hair looked at Hari and Leon on the bed and pointed her finger at them.\nAh! Dad and mom wrestling again?\nUgh...!\nHari covered herself with a blanket and hid at her daughter's sudden visit but Leon calmly approached the princess hiding only his lower body.\n“Well do you think we are good friends?”\nLeon gently stroked the top of his head. He embraced the 3rd princess of the empire in the product.\nDid you come alone?\nNo! My eldest mother my littlest mother my older sister my older brother and my younger siblings come with me!\n3rd Princess Han Ha-yeon shook her head and pointed to the hallway with her hand. At the end of that line of sight was Beatrice the empress of the Lionheart Empire and Cheon So-yeon the second empress with the prince and princesses.\nI'm here to say hello Your Majesty.\nFollowing the grinning Empress Beatrice Empress Cheon So-yeon the prince and the princesses bowed their heads.\nThey are the children of Leon who resemble their mothers and have a unique mix of silver red and black.\nWhere is Karina?\nThe Great Princess is spending time with Gu Dae-seong's wife.\nPak on that word! Leon frowned. When I see Hwang Tae-son who is three years younger than her second princess Reina I feel both happy and somewhat at a loss.\nTsk tsk are you saying they forgot to say hello in the morning and are so busy hanging out with each other? To the point where they don't even show their grandson's face?\nIt's our wedding anniversary soon.\nIt was a time when Leon's frustration did not go away despite Cheon So-yeon's request to look after the circumstances.\nOops...!\nUdang-tang-tang! The red-haired empress falls down with a loud noise. Hari who hurriedly got her clothes on and got caught in the blanket was surrounded by the prince and princess.\nUgh...\nIs the second mother okay?\nOkay it's okay.\nBut why does the second mother always have her stomach open? Isn't it cold?\nD-It's fashion!\nSo-yeon supporting Hari. Her Hari expressed her gratitude to her.\nUgh thank you.\nSister you have a child so don't overdo it. Don't go around with a cold stomach.\nIt's 3 months so it's okay! And since I'm the Flame Chalice Knight I don't have to worry about getting cold.\nDon't overdo it and get out of the rotation.\nThat was the purpose!\nLeon shook his head and smiled lightly at the two lightly bickering. Still it wasn't too bad to look at.\nyour majesty.\nBeatrice slipped her arms around the defenseless Leon. Her bright smile gave her good news.\nPrincess Raina will be returning from her training soon. Would you like to meet her?\nHmm? Has it already happened?\nThe Dragonian Empire asked me to stay there.\nKnights look forward to embarking on a journey to prove themselves to the gods and receive quests.\nHowever in this era of peace it was difficult for knights to find a battlefield to prove themselves so the Lionheart Empire invited knights to find a new battlefield to practice in another dimension.\nCountless knights set out on a journey to protect and protect the dimension pioneers such as Yacht Spinner's Cyberpunk Dimension and Beatrice's Sphero Kingdom Dimension as well as places where people live such as the Dragonian Empire Dimension which was conquered by Archduke Carina Dragonia and built an empire. left.\nNow the Lionheart Empire which is pioneering and conquering multiple dimensions beyond the earth is the ruler of the seven dimensions and the Lionheart is their ruler and guardian so their high reputation is not limited to one dimension.\nThen let's go with the children to welcome the second child. I heard that Goddess Ariana cares for that child so if the gods choose I can pass on the throne.\nOh you've still corrected it. Let me study more under Lord Vulcan or the Old Testament.\n“Abama are you going to see Raina?”\nI want to go too! I want to go see Raina!\nDespite the noisy shouts of the princes and princesses Leon just watched them happily.\nWhen he lost his kingdom and family early on he thought it was a sight he would never see again.\nHowever the relationships that transcend time and space and dimensions eventually gave me a world that was so undeserved.\nHow could I not thank the gods for this?\nThe gods always say thank you to him but Leon thought that this was also possible with the guidance of the gods.\nThe Lion Heart King of absolute power lofty honor and glory bestowed by the gods.\nThe chivalry of Leon Dragonia Lionheart the ruler and guardian of the seven dimensions is not over yet.\nBecause one day he must do something.\nTo end this era of peace and usher in a true era of glory.\nThe Lion Heart King is the owner of the Holy Sword and Holy Lance and will claim himself as the Guardian of the Holy Grail.\nBy the way Mama Obama when will Aunt Yafi become the fourth mother?\n······ Let's talk later.\nSometimes it seems that the world is too eager to give it to you.\n* * * *\nEarlier there was an invasion of evil.\nIt wasn't just the story of Earth.\nLionheart was like that and countless worlds must have had similar experiences.\nMany have faced evil and in the end lost and triumphed. But too many have perished.\nLeon watched their end.\nIn the other world where he found a new life there were friends he had been with since childhood.\nThere were also honorable knights respectable priests and loved ones.\nI saw their end in my hometown. Some despaired and cried but I also saw those who swore to fight to the end. It will be the same for you.\n“············.”\nEarth is no different. They were more easily corrupted more easily defeated... but they were not cowards.\nRemember those who fought. No songs or monuments are needed. Remembering them and following their will will suffice.\nI hear the sounds of those who gulp and swallow. Soldiers with fear in the face of a fight are everywhere.\nOrdinary people who fear death and do not want to face the end of life are not bad.\nIt's not something you can't understand. You don't believe in yourself and your faith in God may be less than your fear.\nMost of them are like that.\nThe things ahead are the darkness that swallowed the light\nIt is the beast that brings the end\nIt is an incurable disease that spreads.\nThe one who extinguishes hope and becomes the incarnation of despair.\nHow can the people of this weak age stand up to the evil malice?\nWho will show true courage in this era?\nI will face the impossible.\nDefeat an invincible foe.\nI will light up the brilliance that reaches the stars.\nfor all who watch their backs.\nI saw dragons in you.\nNameless soldiers. Stare at each article.\nThere would have been an easy way.\nfight or be silent It would have been a very simple option.\nEven those who are here right now may have been dragged by a sense of duty.\nThere will be those who would like to say that deep down they didn't want to leave their hometown and come to a place like this.\nImagine an enemy you can't defeat.\nAn unlikely invincible adversary lies ahead.\nYou can't win. The enemy is too powerful and it causes chaos that creates heaven and earth.\nYou don't even have to imagine.\nright in front of them.\nA disaster that I thought I would not be able to counter.\nCan you guys take on the challenge alone? Do you have the will to do so? Can you be confident that you will not give up hope until the end?\nwho can answer this question\nWho would be willing to step out?\nThere were those who thought so. There were those who said it couldn't be done.\nLeon remembers the last fight. He recalls the end of Lionheart.\nThere were those who howled in despair before a lord so mighty and an army of evil that stretched beyond the horizon.\nEven the Lionheart Knights of Glory were like that.\nHowever Jim is still here. Jim is the proof! It is clear proof that humanity! The world! has not given up resisting evil!\nMany articles were lost.\nThe dumb Grail Knight Zereah whom he respected has passed away\nThe Holy Grail Knight of unbreakable faith Geobrick sacrificed himself.\nOld friends Antoc and Gildus fought until the end and there were the noble thunder knight Gillingham the great saintess Agak the forest sage Gunlar and the sun knight Loxley.\nAnd there were unknown soldiers.\nThere were the remnants of the empire there were the wise men of the forest the dwarves of the iron mountain and the elves of the burned world tree.\nThere was someone to whom they entrusted their last will in fear.\nI am! The knight is here! The Lionheart is in front of you!\nThe example of you dragons is here!\nI Leon Dragonia Lionheart destined to lead you and finally win will gladly stand in front of you!\nA thunderous voice struck the world and the Holy Sword emitted a brilliant golden light. Everyone felt the warmth of that brilliant light and felt the divine protection.\nRemember! The knights who fought until the end with the Lion Heart King!\nRemember! The honorable machine that sealed the seed of evil and protected the city for a thousand years!\nRemember! The magician queen who never gave up while repeating despair for the sake of the world!\nAs long as the history of heaven and earth continues honor and glory will not be forgotten and future generations will use this as an indicator to walk towards the stars.\nRaise your will to immortality!!\nThe holy sword was dazzling.\nIn the holy light that catches everyone's attention he moves with Shinsoo.\n-Kirik! Kirik!\nEight legs moved. Slowly as if matching your steps.\n-thud! cooong! thud!\nThe machines stepped on the floor as one.\n- Jerkjeokjeok!\nThe knights turn their jockeys and step forward and then the boots move in line with the five.\nWhen the movement was combined it shook the world.\nA hundred years have passed since the fall of Rakshaar Lord of Chaos. Now we stand on their land.\nThe ground they tread on is black. The earth is deprived of the blessings of the gods and the air is full of stuffiness.\nbut. They will not despair over this.

      "content": "Final Author's Review\nAnother story has ended.\nThe story of Leon Dragonia Lionheart has come to an end like this.\nokay. This man's story has come to an end.\nI feel relieved and feel fortunate.\n‘The King of Knights Who Returned with the Gods' is the second web novel challenge that I published in series.\nIt is the work that became the basis of ‘King of the Knights of the Ruined World' which was published serially because he had a reckless challenge with ‘Orc Boss Murka' and then broke down.\nInspired by Cyberpunk 2077 it started with the title of Holy Grail Knight 5077 and ended with exactly 50 shorts.\nAt the time the score was 5800 views based on 50 episodes but it was a poor result for a paid version so I wanted to have a complete short story so I serialized up to 50 episodes and finished it as a short story.\nHowever I still had regrets and regrets about this work.\nAt this time it was not a modern man possessed in the Middle Ages and returned but a real medieval knight king who fell into the cyberpunk world.\nThe character is more natural and probable but I don't think it was a good main character for readers to relate to.\nSo as for the direction of the remake I added the setting that I was from an earthling that readers could relate to and that I was completely immersed in another world while reigning as a king for 300 years.\nThe background has become a modern hunter from cyberpunk and the enemies are not corrupt and dissolute humans but gates and demons.\nIn modern hunter water it is easy to become a simple fantasies of the main character of Munchkin but the main character named Leon had a character that fits perfectly.\nSo I added an element called ‘concept' to the gate.\nIn reality the setting is a ‘record' of a world conquered by demons but thanks to that I wonder if it showed many stories transcending time and space.\nI was able to rescue Beatrice from another world and I was able to solve the story of the noble Holy Grail knights Geobrick and Zereah.\nVulcanus the son of fire attribute who should have died or could not be met originally was able to be brought into the modern Earth and I think it made it possible to witness the end of Lionheart not from Leon's memory but from the perspective of other characters and readers.\nAbove all I was able to naturally introduce Yacht Spinner a cyberpunk killing machine from the ‘King of Knights of the Ruined World' whom I cared about and attached the most to in this work.\nThe King of Knights who returned with the gods must have shown most of what I wanted to show and what I could show.\nHowever the unfortunate thing is that the charm of the character did not become the center because the story was focused on but I would like you to consider that the character Leon is a character that is very difficult to use in a relationship... haha······.\nThose of you who read my work about killing an academy player must have expected ‘So when do you catch this guy?'\nBut you saved the harem ending?\nAnyway the story of Leon Dragonia Lionheart who was such a sore finger and Murka Ballak who was an even more sore finger ended like this.\nI who thought of using the main character from the ruined previous work as the final boss congratulate me...!\nthanked.\nThank you for reading my story to the end.\nPark PD in charge friends who cheered me on anyway a dot on my side chest! dot! Oh my! Author myabit who accepted and drew Han Hari\nKyoju writer who drew the cover and the wonderful illustration of Beatrice and even drew the stocking version\nAuthor Choi Woo-jae who drew Vulcanus Murka and black and white illustrations.\nAlso the editors of Munpia and the editors of the distributors.\nAbove all above all dear and grateful readers.\nI would like to express my gratitude to everyone who helped me to complete the work called King of Knights.\n『The King of Knights Returns with God』\nDid you enjoy watching it?\nDid you have a small smile while reading my article?\nAre you excited about the next episode?\nMay 24 2022. March 8 2023 from the first start. I hope you were a little more happy during the journey of a total of 279 flights. I sincerely hope you were happy.\nWriter Bulcho announces the end to the readers like this.\nTo the readers who read the article that might have been disappointing unpleasant or too obvious.\nI would like to express my gratitude to the readers who were happy enjoyed and had fun watching until the end of the article.\nGood night good morning and have a nice day.\nthanked.\nsave people Sincerely.",
