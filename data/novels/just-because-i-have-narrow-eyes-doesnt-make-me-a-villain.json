      "content": "The cherry blossoms were fluttering, and the pollen tickled people’s noses.\nThe bright spring sunshine was shining down on the people.\n[It’s a nice day today!]\n“…That’s right, Author.”\nWalking with an awkward stride up the uphill path where people were walking.\nThis body is still not used to it.\nWhen I bumped into some students walking the same path by mistake, they reacted strongly.\n“Hey, open your eyes while you’re walking…!”\n“Oh, sorry.”\n“Ah, that’s… uh, it’s okay!”\nThe students suddenly became polite after seeing my face.\nA wallet dropped from a student’s pocket. Were they in that much of a hurry?\nIt doesn’t seem like they noticed it.\nI decided to naturally use my ability for practice.\nThe thread of the half-glove I was wearing loosened and rushed towards the wallet.\n…Hmm, success. I need to get used to using it often.\nI gently snapped my hand back, and the thread pulled the wallet toward me like a fish reeled in. Then I looked towards where the boys had been.\n“Oh, they left already.”\nI thought with a wry smile.\nBased on their uniforms, they were definitely students at the academy I’m about to enroll in.\nI should return it quickly.\nIf I build connections even as an extra, it might help me later.\nAs I was about to head in the direction they went, suddenly someone grabbed my arm.\n“Excuse me.”\n“Yes?”\n“You shouldn’t steal other people’s belongings.”\nTsk.\nI clicked my tongue quietly.\nThis damned appearance. No matter what I do, I get misunderstood.\nI glanced at the face of the person who had grabbed my arm. He was quite handsome.\n…How unfair. Some turn into girls and get misunderstood all the time.\nMy mood soured a bit, and my tone became a little sharper.\n“…Let go.”\n“Huh…?!”\nOh, why is he so surprised?\nDid I do something?\n“Don’t worry. I was just trying to find the owner.”\nI smiled slightly to clear up the misunderstanding, though I didn’t feel like it.\nThe boy then made a gloomy expression.\nWell, he had just misunderstood me because of my face, too.\nI do look a bit suspicious, don’t I?\nI walked away briskly to leave quickly, and fortunately, the boys weren’t far ahead.\n“Hey kid, mind stopping for a second?”\n“…Why, why. I already apologized.”\n“Is this wallet yours?”\n“My wallet?! Give it back!”\n“Yeah, I’ll give it back.”\nI tossed the wallet to the startled boy.\nOkay, now I can build a connection with these boys…\n[That boy from earlier was the main character! Hiya, he really is handsome. Of course the main character should be good-looking!]\n“…Huh?”\nMy attention shifted from trying to talk to the boys to my ears.\nWhat did the Author just say? …Main character? That handsome kid from before?\n“Author, was that kid just now…”\n[Yes! You’re right! The main character of the novel, Yu Siwoo! Isn’t he cool?!]\n“…We’ve made contact already.”\nSo it’s finally starting.\nThe journey to bring this novel to its conclusion.\n[Hehe, the main character really is cool…!]\nI’m shaking my head at the Author who is writing this novel.\nI have to make a happy ending to a novel that I can’t tell will unfold.\nI don’t want to die.\n“Okay, let’s give it a try, Author.”\n[Huh? …Yes! We’ll do our best! Until the end! Let’s go!]\nFirst, an immediate goal.\nI had to become friends with Yu Siwoo.\n***\n“Suspicious…”\nYu Siwoo thought.\nIt’s too suspicious.",

      "content": "Many new students were sitting in the huge schoolyard.\nNestled among them, I was able to comfortably pass the time.\n“…Hey you! Wake up!”\n“Aah!”\n“I know the principal’s speech is boring, but as a student of this academy, you need to set an example.”\n“Yes, I’m sorry.”\nEveryone else had suffered the area-of-effect sleep attack called the welcoming speech, but I was fine.\n“……”\n[Reader, a teacher is coming!]\n“I’m not sleeping, teacher.”\n“Oh, I see…Sorry…”\nThe teacher who had approached me looked puzzled and turned away.\nShe looked confused, thinking I was surely snoring.\nThis face really comes in handy at times like this.\nMy narrow eyes make it hard to judge whether I’m asleep.\nHehehe.\n[…You do remember what you’re supposed to be doing, right?]\n“Of course, Author. I remember.”\nOf course, I wasn’t sleeping.\nI was just goofing off.\nThe simple question is what action I was taking.\nI was looking for someone.\n[Ugh, today’s chapter was tough to make…Reader, comfort me…!]\n“You’re the only one who could have created a world like this, Author. I think it’s amazing.”\nYes, only you could have.\nThe one who forcibly threw me into this novel.\nWhy are you just writing web novels when you have such power?\nIf it was a completed or popular novel, I could understand. There were many like that.\nI could have reluctantly accepted it.\nBut throwing me into a novel you haven’t even written yet, what is that about?\nAnd why did you throw a guy into a female character?\n[Hehe, such praise…]\nIt’s not praise.\nI let out a small sigh and refocused my scattered attention from inwardly blaming the Author.\nYes, what can I do? It’s already happened.\nThe Author created this world and started the series.\nIn the end, web novels are told from the main character’s perspective, so I have to be around him.\nTo tailor the story to the Author’s tastes.\nWhat if the Author gets tired of writing the novel and leaves, or the main character, Yu Siwoo, gets seriously injured in some incident and can’t continue the story?\n…I don’t even want to imagine it. Who knows what could happen?\nIn the end, there’s only one way for me to survive.\nWhile guiding the Author, who is a hopeless case, and protecting the not-yet-grown main character.\nI have to defeat whatever evil forces arise, whose identities and settings probably haven’t even been determined yet.\nThe difficulty level is ridiculously high.\n“…Found him.”\n[Oh, really?! For real. There he is.]\nAfter staring at the backs of the students’ heads for a while, a familiar head appeared.\nYes, that head.\nThere’s no mistaking it.\nWhy? Because even the back of his head looks handsome. Damn.\nWhy is such a good-looking guy the main character…I guess it’s because he’s handsome, right?\nThe world is absurd.\nOh, he’s looking this way.\nI naturally turned my gaze towards the principal.\nWhether the new students are spaced out or not, he keeps giving his speech in the same manner.\nAre all principals like that in every world?\n[Reader, you can look again. He’s facing forward.]\n“Thanks, author.”\nI looked back at Yu Siwoo.\nYes, that boy is the main character.\nNo matter what happens, that guy can’t get hurt.\nIf he does get hurt, it has to be within a manageable range.\nBut if I approach him looking like this, I’ll naturally be rejected.\n[Hmm, what to do…]\nFrom the start, I can’t act like other web novel main characters.\nSteal all the talents/abilities?\nI doubt I even have any talents. They probably weren’t set in the first place.\nAsk for help from another important character?\nHa, from what I’ve seen of the Author’s tendencies these past few days, it doesn’t seem like they’ve thought of that.\nA major world-shaking event for the story?\n…There are no important characters or talents, so what major event?\nIt’s literally just a live writing session.\nThe Author said they are writing using the world as inspiration.\nWhether this is a world the Author created or just observing a created world,\nI’m not sure. And it doesn’t really matter if I find out.\n[Should I stick with this? Hmm, but I like this way too…]\nIn the end, there’s only one thing I have to do.\nGuide this unpredictable world in as safe a direction as possible.\nA happy ending and not a painful death.\nTo do that, I’ll have to observe the main character first.\nI envy those other web novel main characters.\nThey remember all the novel’s contents and steal tons of talents/abilities.\nThey know all the characters’ secrets, too.\nThen, they help solve things and instantly become friends with everyone.\nBut me?\nI ended up in the same situation of being inside a novel, so why is my experience so different?\nEnding up as a girl just staring at the backs of guys’ heads.\n[Ugh, I’m stumped…Okay, I’ve decided!]\n“Decided what exactly?”\nI snapped at the Author in annoyance.\nThey’ve been muttering to themselves this whole time when I was trying to ignore them.\nIt’s really tough when the only other noise is the principal’s sleep spell.\n[Well! Reader, what comes to mind when you think of the beginning of an academy novel?]\n“The beginning of an academy novel?”\n[Yes!]\nAre they thinking about how to proceed with the plot? Asking for my help?\nI listed a few storylines that came to mind.\n“Hmm, choosing weapons? A duel?”\n[Ehehe, those are good too! However, incidents often occur right at the entrance ceremony. So I thought I’d try that!]\n“…Huh?”\nWait a second.\nWhat is this person saying right now?\nNot noticing my reaction, the Author continued with a bright smile.\n[You see, there are two types of entrance ceremony attacks. Monster appearances and evil organization attacks!]\n“Hold on a moment, Author. Let’s have an in-depth discussion.”\n[But I figured having an evil organization attack right at the start would be too soon, so I decided to have a monster appear!]\nCold sweat dripped down.\nThis is bad.\n“Um, when exactly is this monster supposed to appear…?”\n[For impact, after the principal’s speech ends and the applause dies down, the ceiling will break open!]\nOh, come on.\nCan’t we just have a normal start for once?\nThe novel only started yesterday!\nNot understanding at all, I protested to the Author.\n“You’re saying a monster can just appear in the city? Say something that makes sense.”\n[Oh right, in the city…Hmm, then the monster that was illegally raised by a corporation subcontracted by an evil organization accidentally escaped!]\n“…”\nThis makes no sense.\nWhat organization, evil or not, has subsidiaries like a corporation?\nA subcontractor of a subcontractor?\nThe Author’s determination to have an event at the entrance ceremony seems firm.\n“After the principal’s speech ends and the applause stops, a monster will attack from the ceiling…”\n[Yes, impactfully appearing, the main character will coolly defeat the monster and show his presence! How’s that?]\n“Well, it’s okay, I guess…Are you really doing this?”\nYes, I guess it’s fine.\nIt’s an impeccable novel plot.\nA device to subtly show the main character’s strength.\nThe main character cooly handles the threat when the other students are fleeing in a panic.\nThis incident naturally explains how the main character is stronger than his peers.\nA perfect plot.\nAs long as I don’t get caught up in it!\n“You definitely said the main character isn’t a returnee, reincarnator, or transmigrator, right?”\n[Yes. There have been too many of those recently, so I wanted to try an orthodox main character!]\nWhy does this person insist on being a hipster in situations like this…!\nYou could have normally made him a returnee/reincarnator and said he vaguely remembers things. That’s a perfectly good, easy setup!\nWhat if the suddenly overwhelmed main character just flees in panic?\n“…marks the end of the principal’s speech. Everyone, applause!”\nIt’s too late now.\nAccording to the Author, this place is about to become pandemonium.\nEven if I warned that a monster was coming now, no one would believe me. I’d be lucky not to be treated as a crazy person.\nSomehow, I need to discreetly let the main character know about this…\n[It’s starting, it’s starting! I’m so excited!]\n“Kyaaaaaaah?!”\n“A, a monster! Level 3!”\n“A level 3 monster at the school…!”\n“Everyone evacuate, quickly!”\n“…Level 3?”\n[Uh, I thought it was good foreshadowing…Like later, I can put another character saying, ‘Did he really take care of that monster?’]\nYou really are peculiarly detail-oriented in the strangest places.\nI suppressed the urge to make that sarcastic remark. The level system was hastily made. How strong could a level 3 be?\nIt’s probably some ad-hoc ranking system used by people in the field.\nStill, suppose this threat was brought up to show the difference between an ordinary student and the main character. In that case, it surely can’t be an easy opponent at this stage…Oof.\nI used my threads to deflect a chunk of concrete sent flying by the rampaging monster.\nThat was a close one.\n[Reader! Are you okay?!]\n“I’m fine…But I can’t use this glove anymore.”\nI tossed aside one tattered half-glove with its threads all frayed and loose.\nI’ll have to get a new one later.\n“More importantly, I need to find where the main character is and what he’s doing…”\n“Kuwaaaaaaaa!”\nStartled by the roar like a movie monster, I looked at the monster writhing in pain, its mouth area slashed and bleeding.\nWhoa, when did the main character go over there?\nI didn’t even notice. He is incredibly fast.\nThe monster was already screaming with bloody wounds around its mouth.\n[Hehe…I missed the main character’s exploits while watching you, Reader…]\nThe teachers who evacuated the nearby students joined and brought down the monster.\nSo that’s what the teachers were doing.\nYes, it makes sense that newly enrolled students wouldn’t be stronger than teachers yet.\nIn an academy novel, they’ll probably surpass them within a year, but still.\nBy the way, when did he even get over there?\nHe was standing quite far from his original spot.\nAs if he knew the monster would come to that location.\n…The main character’s famed intuition, perhaps?\nWell, the better for me.\n“Don’t cry, Author. I saw it, so I can explain in detail.”\n[…Really? You’re the only one for me, Reader!]\nHah.\nIt felt like caring for a child.",

      "content": "[I don’t like it.]\n“Huh? What don’t you like?”\n[I couldn’t imagine it all! I don’t like it!]\nI thought I had explained in as much detail as possible.\nI let out a small sigh.\nWell, they weren’t someone who would be easily satisfied.\n“But Author, it’s already happened. You can’t turn back time…”\n[Since it’s already happened, I have no choice! I’m going to launch another attack!]\n“Huh?”\n[Let’s see. After realizing that their wife had died, the other monster that escaped from the illegal breeding facility cried sadly.]\n“No, wait a minute, Author.”\n[Enveloped in a desire for revenge, the male monster rushed towards the humans who killed her!]\n“…”\nThey aren’t listening.\nOkay, it seems the Author is really disappointed.\nI need to persuade them as quickly as possible to undo this…\n“Kwaaaaa!”\n“There’s another one!?”\n“Student, take cover! It’s dangerous!”\n“Is there still someone inside!?”\nDamnit, they’re so fast.\nBut more importantly, why did it appear right in front of me?\n[Ah, I didn’t set the location.]\n…Author, what are you doing!?\n“Grrrrrr…”\n“Now now, good doggy. Stay still…Hand?”\n“Kwaaaaaa!”\nYeah, I figured it wouldn’t work.\nBlinded by rage, the monster charged at the nearest human.\nAnd who would that be? Obviously me.\nInstinctively, I used my ability against its overwhelmingly menacing appearance.\n“Krrrk?!”\n“Phew, that was a shock.”\n[I-I’m sorry, dear reader.]\n“Please don’t do that again. There won’t be a next time.”\nYeah, there won’t be a next time.\nNo matter how powerful the Author is, they can’t turn back time. What’s done is done, and throwing a tantrum won’t solve anything.\n[Hiiing…I wanted to see the protagonist’s first epic battle.]\nIn an instant, the rest of my half-glove unraveled, my stockings loosened, and my bare legs started to show.\nThe loose threads clung here and there in the auditorium, binding the monster’s four legs, body, and neck without covering them.\nThe monster charging straight at me was now frozen in place.\n“Krrrr…!”\n“Shhhh, don’t move.”\nI added more threads to restrain the monster struggling to break free.\nIt was hanging suspended in the air like a stuffed specimen. Kind of reminds me of dried pollock fish.\nSo, who’s attacking me now?\n“This is troublesome, though.”\n[Why? The mysterious new student easily restrains the monster! This is a good development.]\n“Um, well. How should I put this…”\nI glanced down at my body.\nAt some point, the half-gloves I was wearing and the black stockings covering my legs had all loosened and were binding the monster.\nIt’s good that I tied up the monster with these threads.\nBut I used too many out of panic.\n“Hmm, what should I do.”\n[Just kill it quickly! The protagonist kills the monster restrained by the mysterious beauty that attacked the entrance ceremony! This is Heroine 101!]\n“I’d like to do that, but…”\nNo, not the heroine talk.\nThe “kill it quickly” part.\nWho said anything about being a heroine?\nI’m a guy. Do you think I’d do something like that?\nI need to pull more from my  clothes to use my killing threads.\nI’ve used up all the  clothing I could comfortably pull from, my half-glove and stockings.\nWhat’s left?\nObviously, my leotard and uniform.\nWhy a leotard and not underwear? That’s easy to answer.\nFirst, I feel too self-conscious about wearing women’s underwear. A leotard feels like a tight swimsuit, so it’s a little better.\nSecond, a leotard has way more threads than underwear.\n“I used way too much.”\n[You’re just not used to your ability yet, dear reader. Once you get accustomed to it, you can easily restrain them with less cloth!]\nHere’s the problem.\nIf the only  clothes I can use threads from are my leotard and uniform, which should I use?\nMy ability is to pull out the threads from the  clothes I’m wearing that are touching my skin. This was the ability the Author gave me.\nBut if I’m not wearing stockings, my skirt will also touch my skin.\nIf I use the leotard, I can use the unseen inner threads to kill.\nHowever, the threads I use don’t return, so if I accidentally pull the wrong ones, I could end up just wearing my uniform with nothing underneath, becoming an indecent exhibitionist girl…\nI’ve never practiced pulling threads from the leotard before. It would be a disaster if I accidentally loosened my shoulders or even worse…\nOn the other hand, I’m a bit hesitant to use my uniform.\nI could shorten the skirt as a last resort…\nBut this skirt already feels too short, and shortening it even more?\nShould I risk the potential disaster of using the leotard threads, or should I use my uniform and be embarrassed but handle it safely?\nWhat a monumental dilemma!\nI probably should have instinctively tied it up with threads from the start.\nLike catching a ball, I automatically bound the approaching monster without thinking. But in the process, I used way too many threads excessively.\nI’m still inexperienced, so switching the restraining threads I’ve already pulled to killing threads is difficult.\n“Student! Just keep it tied up!”\n“What are you doing?! Hurry and guard the perimeter in case there are others!”\n“Y-Yes, sir!”\n[Ah, those guys were here too]\n“You don’t care about the teachers, huh?”\n[Well, they’re just extras. I don’t really care about them unless they’re the protagonist’s mentor.]\nThe teachers, staring blankly, finally came to their senses and took action to take down the monster I had tied up.\nThat’s fortunate. I won’t have to shorten my skirt and walk around embarrassed.\n***\nYu Siwoo felt a chill run down his spine.\nThe reason was not hard to find.\nThat suspicious woman from this morning was staring straight at him.\n‘Was she a new student at the academy…?’\nWhen he first saw her, she looked so suspicious that he didn’t notice what she was wearing.\nBut she was a student at the academy. A new student, just like him.\nHe realized he held suspicion based only on her appearance.\nFeeling apologetic, he turned his head towards where he felt her gaze.\nPerfect timi–she was facing the principal as if she never looked at him.\nStrange, he clearly felt her watching him just now.\nAs he turned his head away, distracted by the surrounding teachers, he felt her gaze on him again.\nWas she really that angry?\nCurious about her behavior, Yu Siwoo noted where she disappeared after the assembly so he could apologize directly later.\nJust as he was about to do that, he heard her mutter something softly.\n“Hold on a moment, Author. Let’s have an in-depth discussion.”\n…?\nWho is this “Author”?\nDoes she have a writer friend nearby or something? He tried to brush it off casually.\nIt’s not good to eavesdrop on other people’s private conversations.\nIt was unintentional, but her voice was so quiet that not even the surrounding students seemed to notice.\nHe figured it would be better to just ignore it.\n…At least, until he heard what she said next.\n“Um, when exactly is this monster supposed to appear…?”\nA monster?\nYu Siwoo was startled.\nA monster is going to appear?\nThis is the academy. In the heart of a major city, right in the center of human territory.\nMonsters are only ever seen on the outskirts of cities, in conflict zones…\n“You’re saying a monster can just appear in the city? Say something that makes sense.”\nIt seemed she was also questioning someone about this, thinking the same way.\nAnd right after hearing that, Yu Siwoo felt a chill run down his spine.\nShe had just asked when the monster would appear.\nAnd now, she was speaking in a tone that suggested she didn’t want to believe it was possible.\nCould it be…?\nNow completely free of any guilt about eavesdropping, Yu Siwoo focused on listening intently, absentmindedly caressing the sword at his waist.\n“After the principal’s speech ends and the applause stops, a monster will attack from the ceiling…”\nThe moment she finished speaking, Yu Siwoo naturally stood up without thinking.\nNot caring about the strange looks from the other new students, he walked towards the center of the auditorium’s ceiling – the area made of glass for landscaping purposes.\nThat’s clearly what she was referring to.\nThere was nowhere else on the ceiling a monster could attack from.\nLogically, it didn’t make any sense.\nFor a new student to know a monster would attack.\nYet strangely, Yu Siwoo believed her words as if spellbound.\nWas it because of those ominously hiding eyes he glimpsed when they first met?\n“…and with that marks the end of the principal’s speech. Everyone, applause!”\nDespite the embarrassed looks from some students viewing him oddly, he found a suitable spot to position himself.\nIf he had just misheard due to paranoia, that would be great.\nThen no one would get hurt.\nBut who would have thought?\nThey say things never go the way you hope.\nContrary to Yu Siwoo’s hopes, a monster attacked from the ceiling.\n“Kyaaaaaaah?!”\n“A, a monster! Level 3!”\n“A level 3 monster at the school…!”\nEven as the new students were hastily led away by the teachers, she remained unmoving.\nJust what gave her such confidence?\nWhile extremely curious about her behavior, with the monster in front of him, Yu Siwoo had no choice but to focus all his attention on defeating it.\nAfter a tense battle ended with him managing to slice open its mouth,\nThe teachers who had quickly evacuated the students started trying to restrain the monster.\n“Student, are you alright?!”\n“Yes, I’m fine.”\n“Impressive skills. …Still, step aside for now. We teachers will handle this.”\nAfter nodding briefly, Yu Siwoo quickly scanned the auditorium, looking for her, realizing she had disappeared.\nWhere did she go?\nHe found her location right after that thought.\nWith a thunderous crash, another monster appeared, smashing through the wall this time.\n“There’s another one!?”\n“Student, take cover! It’s dangerous!”\n“Is there still someone inside!?”\nRight in front of the monster,\n“Now now, good doggy. Stay still? …Hand?”\nFor her to be so relaxed facing a Grade 3 monster.\nThe suspicions towards her only grew stronger. No matter how you looked at it, she was incredibly suspicious.\nThe monster began charging straight at her.\n…Why wasn’t she moving?\nHad he misjudged the situation? Even if she moved now, it was too late!\nDespite the monster’s charge, she remained unmoving—as if mocking Yu Siwoo’s consternation.\nIn an instant, black threads appeared around her and bound the monster.\n“Phew, that was a shock.”\nNot at all a shocked expression.\nHaving so easily restrained the monster yet acting like she was startled seemed extremely awkward.\n“Please don’t do that again. There won’t be a next time.”\nDespite her clearly smiling expression, an inexplicable chill could be felt.\nEven the monster writhing in the binding threads seemed to sense it, its movements lessening.\nYet she mercilessly added more threads, further constricting its body.\n“Shhhh, don’t move.”\nAh, that’s what she meant by there not being a next time.\nWatching her torment the monster instead of finishing it off until the teachers arrived, Yu Siwoo thought to himself:\nShe’s suspicious.\nThere’s definitely something about her.\nAs his suspicions towards her deepened, more words suggesting she was talking to someone else came from her mouth.\n“You don’t care about the teachers, huh?”\nAs if the target were the students.\nTranslator’s Corner\nHanging dried pollock fish.\nThis is the cover from novelpia that shows her power.\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "After leaving behind the fallen dead monster, I left the school as a school closure order had been issued.\nI mixed in with the crowd of people leaving.\n“Author, how are you going to deal with this situation?”\n[Ah, you’re right? I hadn’t thought about that.]\n“You ruined the entrance ceremony and have no thoughts on it at all…?”\nWhat do I really do about this?\nIt will definitely be covered in the news and newspapers.\nI thought the Author would have some thoughts, but they don’t seem to have any. Did they just act without considering the consequences?\n[Well, other novels don’t seem to have descriptions like this… It should be okay if something like this happens at the academy, right?]\n“Then how did those novels deal with it?”\n[…They seem to have covered it all up.]\n“You’re saying that’s possible?”\nNo, I’ve seen developments where attack incidents are covered up before\n.\nBut in those cases, there was only about one class worth of witnesses at most.\nAre you saying you can silence all the new students?\n[Maybe…? Ah, I’ll try it for now!]\nI’m really uneasy, though.\nCan they really resolve this…?\nA cold wind blew strongly as if trying to blow away my unease.\nBrrr, it’s cold. Come to think of it, I need to go buy some stockings and gloves.\n“Author, give me some money.”\n[Ehh, again…?]\n“Of course. I’m a student, you know? A student. Plus, you’re the one who gave me this ability.”\n[Ugh, I feel kind of defeated. I don’t have much money, so why do you spend so freely, Reader?]\nWell, who told them to give me this ability?\nYou know, the money that gets drained each time I use the ability is quite a lot.\nWhen I asked if I could just carry around a ball of yarn instead, you refused, saying it was not stylish.\nIs exposing myself when I unleash my full ability stylish? Jeez.\nWhen I was little, I thought that if I got a superpower, I could use it freely.\nBut here I am saying, ‘An ability with a penalty is stylish!’\nPenalties will be penalties, though.\nWe’ve discussed this issue many times, but the conclusion has always been the same.\nThe Author seemed to have no intention of giving me a different ability.\nSo, I had to live knowing using my full power would make me an exhibitionist.\nDamn it.\n“Ah, and I plan to buy some snacks and ice cream on the way home. Put in a little extra.”\n[This is unreasonable…!]\nThe Author started whining about how unfair it is.\nThey asked why I didn’t gain weight no matter how much I ate.\nThen, yelling at me and complaining about why I live in such a nice place, with a mansion with a pool in the yard.\n“But Author, you’re the one who set it up like this for me.”\n[But, but…! I can’t help but feel wronged!]\nI mostly tuned out the Author’s usual whining.\nAh, I’m worried about tomorrow.\n***\n“Ah, there you are. Can you come to the teacher’s office for a bit?”\n“Understood.”\nYesterday’s incident caused chaos, with students unable to properly greet each other in the disorderly classroom.\nHaving been called by the teacher, I quickly left the classroom.\n[Reader, you’re not making any friends… What a pity.]\n“…That’s because of you!”\n“Sorry, what did you just say?”\n“Nothing, teacher.”\nUnable to hold back the surging emotion, my voice rose slightly.\nBut I did have an excuse this time.\nI haven’t had a single conversation yet, so I don’t have any friends.\nSpeaking in a small voice, I poured out my grievances to the Author.\n[But it’s true that you don’t have any friends, right?]\nThat’s because the students are avoiding me!\nI can’t exactly call someone a friend if I haven’t even spoken to them once.\nI need to have at least one conversation, but everyone subtly avoids me based on my appearance!\nMy surroundings were quiet until the teacher called me to leave because of this.\nThe atmosphere was so awkward that I was actually relieved when the teacher called me over.\nChewing over that thought, I soon arrived at the teacher’s office.\n“Now, your name is…”\n“Arte Iris.”\nI still wasn’t used to my changed name.\nWhen I asked why the main character has a Korean name but I have an English one, they said the main character names are often Korean in academy novels.\nThinking about it, I realized it made sense, so I accepted it, but now I regret it.\n“Ah yes, Arte. Try not to be too tense just because you came to the office. I called you here for no other reason than…”\n“Because of the monster incident?”\n“…Well, I can’t deny it. Yes, that’s the reason.”\nI wonder just how the Author resolved this.\nNo matter how much I thought about it, I couldn’t understand what they wanted to do.\nDid they really silence all the new students?\nThe unease I had been suppressing welled up again.\n“The academy will be awarding you a commendation.”\n“…Huh?”\n“We plan to award two students who helped resolve the monster attack incident.”\nWhat, they didn’t silence the students?\n[Heheh, how’s that? Not bad, right?]\nAs I was pondering what the Author could have possibly done, the teacher’s voice came.\n“To be frank, the monster attack incident was clearly our negligence.”\n“I see…”\nBut I don’t think it was your fault.\nThe Author’s snickering voice, as if fishing for praise, made me instinctively lower my head in embarrassment.\nI’m the one who should apologize.\n“We have no choice but to be grilled by parents and the media. It was our failure to provide proper security.”\nThe teacher’s voice sounded regretful, so I glanced slightly toward their eyes.\nAs expected, there were prominent dark circles.\nThey must have stayed up all night.\n“The academy is an institution that trains heroes. We will humbly accept our mistake and take it as the price for discovering promising students.”\nWhat?\nThat’s too rational, isn’t it?\nAren’t academies and hunter associations in web novels usually shady places?\n“So, a commendation, is it?”\n“Yes. Don’t worry. We also plan to provide sufficient compensation.”\n[How’s that? Isn’t it tiring to have incompetent academies all the time? Isn’t it okay for them to be a little competent, too?]\n“…Hmm.”\nNormally, they just promise sufficient compensation for the victims, but why does the academy seem so competent now?\nWell, it is what it is.\nIt doesn’t seem to negatively impact the story progression.\n“Excuse me, may I come in?”\n“Yes, please come in. …Ah, it’s student Yu Siwoo. Welcome.”\n[Ah, it’s the main character!]\nThe Author’s delighted voice overlapped with the teacher explaining the situation.\nBy the way, why does he keep looking at me like that?\nStaring at him with slight puzzlement, the main character hurriedly turned his head away.\n…What’s that about?\n[Oho, as expected, Reader! The main character is falling for the heroine!]\n“…Pfft, yeah right.”\n[I’m telling the truth!]\nTuning out the Author’s nonsensical claims, the teacher finished the explanation and approached me.\n“Alright, I’ll need to register your name, so can you state it again, please?”\n“Arte Iris.”\n“Arte Iris… Huh?”\nThe teacher looked perplexed and started fiddling with the computer some more.\nWhat’s wrong? Is there an issue?\n“Student, can you write out the spelling on this paper?”\n“Yes, sure.”\nThey must have entered it incorrectly.\nI wrote down the name the Author gave me on the paper and handed it to the teacher.\nWhat a hassle.\nBoredly looking up at the ceiling, the teacher’s voice took on a serious tone.\n“Student, your name isn’t on the new student roster…”\n“Huh? That can’t be…”\nIt can’t be, right?\nI’m clearly the new academy student, as declared by the Author.\nIf I’m not an academy student, then who is?\n“…Author?”\n[Ah, oops. I made a mistake…! Just a moment! I didn’t set that up!]\nAh.\nI let out a small sigh.\nI thought they wouldn’t create any issues, but they left out important details instead.\n[Arte Iris, first-year academy student. …There, it’s done! Your name should show up on the roster now!]\n“Umm, teacher. You may have entered it incorrectly, so may I try inputting it?”\n“…Alright. Go ahead and try.”\nThe teacher, who had been sitting, moved away from the desk to give me space to enter.\nLet’s see, Arte Iris… Okay, done.\n“Here it is. There seems to have been a system error for a moment.”\n“Oh, really. Thank you.”\n“Hehe, no problem.”\nAfter asking the main character for his name and inputting it, the teacher smiled brightly and said.\n“Okay, you two. The monster attack must have been very difficult, but thank you for your time. Let’s see… You’re both in Class A. Head to Class A.”\n“Thank you, teacher.”\n“No, thank you…Fighting! I’ll be cheering you on.”\n[Hehe, how’s that? I put you in the same class as the main character…You’re not mad, are you?]\nThey didn’t need to be so attentive.\nOf course I’m mad.\n“We’ll talk about this later.”\n[Hieek…]\nBy the way, why does the main character keep glancing at me?\nHas he really fallen for me?\n***\n‘Her name isn’t on the roster?’\nYu Siwoo overheard it.\nWhen told her name wasn’t on the new student roster, he saw her slightly harden her expression and mutter something like “Author.”\nShortly after she inputted her name, her name naturally appeared on the roster.\nThe teacher explained that the monsters had accidentally escaped an illegal breeding facility.\nBut was that really the truth?\nHe clearly heard it. In the auditorium during the entrance ceremony, she knew the monsters would attack.\nOn top of that, her appearance of talking to someone.\nBack in the auditorium, too, she had said “Author.”\nIf so…\n‘You don’t care about the teachers, huh?’\n“Excuse me.”\n“Y-Yes?!”\n“Pfft. Why are you so tense?”\nThe slender eyes radiating a reddish glow felt like they were piercing right through him.\nHis body, tense from anxiety, stiffened up as his heart started pounding heavily from the tension.\n“You’re Yu Siwoo, right?”\n“H-How did you…?!”\n“I heard the teacher mention it earlier.”\n‘A-Ah, right, that’s true.’\nHe had completely forgotten in his flustered state.\nAs she flashed a slight smile and extended her right hand, the relaxed muscles tensed up again.\n‘Wh-What is she trying to do…?!’\n“? What’s wrong?”\n“Th-This is…?”\nShe tilted her head in puzzlement after extending her empty hand.\n“Since we went through the same incident, why don’t we get friendly?”\nHe shook her hand, and she gave a slight smile back.\nIt was a mischievous smile as if she had achieved something she had aimed for.\n“I’m Arte Iris. Call me Arte.”\n‘She’s not interested in the teachers, but the students… On top of that, she’d been observing me since the auditorium…!’\nAs unbelievable as it sounds.\n…It seems she has her sights set on me for some reason.\nAnd not for a good purpose, at that.",

      "content": "“Heh, heheh~ Heheh~”\n[Reader, you seem to be in a good mood.]\n“Of course. I’ve made acquaintance with the main character.”\nWow, that was an unexpected gain.\nCome to think of it, the main character also took down a monster, right?\nIt’s natural that the main character is here, too. I had forgotten because of the Author.\nWe shook hands when we were alone, so I should be able to gradually become friendly with him, right?\n“Everyone, quiet down and take your seats.”\nThe teacher came barging through the door.\n…They must be the protagonist’s homeroom teacher.\n“I’m Claire, and I’ll be your homeroom teacher from now on. Pleased to meet you.”\n“C-Claire? Don’t tell me…”\n“The famous hero…?”\n“I heard she retired, but I guess she became a teacher.”\n[Umm… Like other academy novels, I set up a famous and strong person as the homeroom teacher, but why would such a person be a mere teacher at the academy…?]\n“Isn’t that an obvious thing to ask?”\nThere are a few to pick from.\nEither she suffered a plot-convenient injury that made prolonged fighting difficult but allowed short bursts.\nOr she saw a subordinate or colleague die and became disheartened.\nWe can just go with something along those lines.\n[As expected of you, Reader! Should I start calling you the Settings Basket? Thank you! Hehe, a homeroom teacher who’s an aloof beauty type with a hint of world-weariness is a delicious setting no matter how often I see it!]\nI mostly tuned out the Author’s words.\nThey’re all nonsense, as usual.\n“First of all, I’d like to express my regret over yesterday’s unfortunate incident. I apologize on behalf of the school.”\nBowing deeply.\nThe students were flustered to see their idol lower her head like that.\n“P-Please raise your head, Teacher!”\n“Yeah! We’re not concerned about it!”\nDespite the students’ protests, Claire kept her head lowered for a while. Finally, seeing the students become uncomfortable, she raised her head.\nBut she seemed unsatisfied somehow.\nIt seems she wanted to apologize more.\n“T-Teacher! What’s the topic for today’s lesson!”\n“Yeah! Haha, I’m eager to learn!”\n“…Lesson? Ah, right.”\nDid she forget?\nThis is really ridiculous.\nClaire scratched her nape in embarrassment, cleared her throat, and lowered her voice.\n“I don’t know what weapons you’ve used until now. However, the weapon you choose here is the one you’ll continue learning at this academy, so choose carefully.”\nAh, that one.\nWeapon selection.\nThe quintessential first lesson at academies that always shows up.\n“But Author, isn’t there an issue with this…?”\n[Huh? An issue? What is it?]\n“Well, I don’t know how to use weapons?”\n[…Ah, you’re right.]\nMy head started hurting, so I tightly shut my eyes.\nHere we go again!\n[B-But Reader, you can just pick anything…!]\n“Didn’t heroes and villains in this world have one special ability?”\n[Ah, yes. That’s right.]\n“Why would someone who can breathe fire need to wield a weapon?”\n[…Huh?]\nWhy would someone capable of breathing fire need to wield a blade up close?\nThey could just walk up and breathe fire on someone’s back to kill them instantly, right?\nWouldn’t it be more advantageous for them not to use a weapon?\nIf they wield a weapon, it would just raise caution needlessly.\nWouldn’t training their personal abilities be the best the academy can do?\nYou were saying the academy was competent earlier. This is a setting contradiction.\n[M-Mana! We’ll say it’s because of mana! Um… Ability users have mana circulating in their bodies, increasing their physical abilities! So they don’t die easily! If they don’t use their abilities, they can conserve mana!]\n*sigh*…\n[And if you’re going to argue about that, what about guns?! People die if shot by guns! So ability users also don’t die easily to firearms, as a setting! Wow! Perfect! And guns don’t contain mana! I just decided that!]\nHonestly, it’s not a completely convincing setting.\nBut having read countless web novels, I couldn’t be too mad.\nInstead of ‘In this world, why use weapons when you have abilities?’\nI realized I should accept that ‘In this world, they use both abilities and weapons.’\nThe only problem is that this is now the world I’m living in.\n“Alright, follow me. You need to choose your weapons from the warehouse.”\nCome to think of it, this is one of those academy novels where you select weapons, right?\nInstead of being divided into Class A, B, and C, the classes are divided based on what weapon you chose, right?\nDon’t tell me the Author failed to notice and set it up.\nI waited with bated breath for a sliver of hope but didn’t hear anything.\nWhich means they didn’t notice. Damn it.\n“Author, in the novels with weapon selection, the classes are assigned after choosing weapons.”\n[Ah, really?! Was it like that?!]\n“Probably most of them, I’d say?”\nOf course, right…?\nThe teachers can’t be assigned one student each, can they?\nThat would be grossly inefficient.\n[Ah, ah… Got it! After-school clubs! Y-Yeah, let’s do it like clubs! You take normal lessons in class, but for a few hours a day, you get intensive lessons with separate instructors specializing in each weapon! Eh, eheheh…!]\nAh, this is tiring.\nWhy is our Author so stupid?\nI wish they would think things through at least a little when setting things up!\n“This is the weapon warehouse. Choose the weapon you want. You’ll be using it at the academy from now on, so pick carefully.”\nWell, nothing to be done about the setting now that it’s been decided.\nLet’s see what weapon our main character will choose.\nI peeked at the back of his head amidst the noisy students choosing their weapons.\n…As expected, a sword.\nI saw him using a sword against the monster, so it’s only natural.\nMain characters mostly use swords. Very standard.\n“Hmm, is there a problem? You haven’t been looking at the weapons.”\n“Oh, teacher.”\n“Don’t hesitate to tell me.”\n“…Which group would daggers be assigned to?”\n“Daggers?”\nYes, a dagger.\nTo be honest, I don’t have confidence in using a sword.\nIt would just be like swinging a pointy stick.\nA bow? I don’t think so.\nA spear might be better, but storing it is a hassle…\nA dagger seems best.\nIt’s small enough to easily carry in a case.\nAnd it doesn’t require complicated techniques; you just hold it and stab.\nIf I had to learn something, it would still be easier than a sword.\nPlus, if I’m assigned to swordsmanship, I can keep an eye on Yu Siwoo. That’s actually the main point.\n“Daggers are a type of sword, so you’ll likely be assigned to the sword instructor.”\n“I see. Thank you.”\nOh, good to hear.\nI gripped the dagger without hesitation.\n“So it seems to be a puppy love situation. I don’t recommend choosing your weapon based on your fantasies, but I’ll cheer you on.”\n“…Pardon?”\nDid she notice me watching Yu Siwoo?\nFortunately, she doesn’t seem to find it suspicious, but she has misunderstood in a strange way.\nThat’s not it at all?\nI was about to refute her, but she had already moved on to advise other students.\nShould I just leave it be?\nIt’s not the truth anyway.\nI cautiously approached Yu Siwoo, who was holding his sword with a satisfied smile.\n“Ah, did you happen to choose the sword?”\n“…?! Oh, y-yeah…”\nWhy is he trembling like that?\nIs he cold? It’s a bit chilly being a warehouse, but it doesn’t seem cold enough to tremble that much.\n“…Do you have a cold?”\n“Ah, no. I’m a bit nervous… It’s the first class at the academy.”\nIs that so? It feels more like preparation than a class, doesn’t it?\nAnd his voice seems to be trembling slightly.\n…Well, whatever. It doesn’t matter.\nIf it’s a cold, he can take some medicine later.\n“Still, I’m not surprised you chose a sword, though I’m more of a dagger person myself.”\n“Oh, I see. A dagger. Yeah, it’s a good weapon.”\n“Haha, it seems like fate. We’ve defeated the same monster and are taking the same weapon class.”\n“Yeah, right. Oh, uh-haha…ha…”\nYour expression is really pale now. At this point, I’m starting to worry, even if it’s just a cold.\nYou need to grow up healthy so you can defeat the final boss, whoever that might be.\n“Are you okay? You seem really sick.”\n“Yeah. I-I’m fine, so don’t worry.”\nEven though they insist they’re fine, pushing further might be impolite.\nWell, I guess there’s nothing I can do. If there’s a problem, I can always ask the Author for a solution later.\n“Your face looks pale, so you should rest well. See you later!”\nLeaving Yu Siwoo, who was sweating profusely, behind, I started looking at the weapons.\nActually, it’s my first time seeing these kinds of weapons. They’re incredibly fascinating.\n“You chose a spear? Haha, you’re a total spear-maiden.”\n“Hey! Why would you joke like that…”\n“Why? It’s true. A woman with a spear. Spear-maiden.”\n“You, you…! Get over here!”\nAt some point, the tension eased, and I noticed students joking around with each other.\nThey seem lively.\n“Phew, that’s a relief… No major clashes in the setting!”\nIt’s totally spot-on, though, isn’t it, Author? I didn’t say it out loud because I felt like I might burst into tears.\nPoor me.\n“Everyone, if you’ve made your choice, head back to the classroom! Today’s lesson ends here!”\nAt Claire’s words, the students gathered and returned to the classroom.\nOf course, I was walking back alone.\nIt’s really lonely, seriously.\n***\n“Hu, phew… Phew…!”\nYu Siwoo thought he was going to die.\nHis heart was beating so loudly that he thought it might leap out of his throat.\n‘Arte, that woman… She was definitely looking at me…!’\nHe always kept her in his line of sight. And she only picked up the dagger after he touched the sword.\nIt was unmistakable.\n‘For some reason, she harbors a significant interest in me!’\nWhether that was a good thing or a bad thing, Yu Siwoo couldn’t quite determine. No matter how he thought about it, it didn’t seem good.\nYet, he had no memory of ever acting in a way that would attract such attention from a woman like her.\n‘I can’t discard the sword and choose another weapon to avoid her.’\nThe weapon Yu Siwoo had used until now was the sword.\nTrying to wield something else at this point would only set him back.\nAs Yu Siwoo entered the academy to become a hero, nothing was more unacceptable than that.\n“Why on earth is she showing interest in me…?”\nHe couldn’t understand.\nSomeone who could hack into the academy’s database in an instant and infiltrate as a new student—what possible reason could they have for showing such interest in him?\nHe had expected to make friends and train hard in the academy once he enrolled.\nInstead, he wanted to cry alone.",

      "content": "[Hmm, it feels a bit unsatisfying…]\n“What kind of mischief are you trying to do again?”\n[Isn’t it unsatisfying just to choose a weapon and leave school?]\nWhat was wrong with that?\n“There is no rush. There are still 3 years left in the academy…”\n[No! Those 3 years are an illusion! It’s practically 1 year!]\n“Well, that may be true… but I don’t think there’s a need to rush that much. It’s not like problems appear every day.”\nBut the Author’s words are right.\nThe fate of an academy novel.\nAfter introducing the main characters, they will always be outside the academy.\nUsually, that’s around the beginning of the second year, after exhausting all the academy novel cliches.\nOf course, I know that.\nBut isn’t it a bit too fast a pace to burn through two episodes in a day?\n…I smelt something was off.\nIt sounded like their voice was trembling a bit, too.\n“How many chapters did you write yesterday?”\n[Huh? W-why are you asking that suddenly?]\n“You had some stockpiled, right?”\n[…]\nAs expected.\nIt seems they recklessly wrote many chapters in a row without thinking.\nBut after writing so many consecutive chapters, they probably ran out of material for tomorrow.\nThey definitely need new material urgently and are frantically looking for a makeshift plot.\n“How vexing… Hmm, what should I do?”\n[Please, Reader. I’m in big trouble. I need material!]\n“Then why don’t you look at other people in the story?”\n[Aahh, besides you, Reader, it’s a bit difficult! Please, I’m begging you!]\nOur Author always acts without thinking, which is the problem.\nI’d rather not help out of annoyance, but I can’t do that.\nThey told me that looking at characters other than myself was draining for them.\nIn the end,  if the Author drops the pen, I’ll be at a much greater loss.\nWhat would happen  if the Author who writes the fictional world suddenly stops the story?\nWould the world stop moving or something? Ugh, I don’t even want to think about it.\nEventually, I let out a small sigh and accepted the Author’s request.\n“I guess it can’t be helped.”\n[Yay! As expected of Reader! I love you!]\n“But if you recklessly write consecutive chapters again next time, you’ll get scolded.”\n[Yes!]\nI suddenly realized something.\nWhat will the Author do if no material can be found?\nEven if a major incident happens and they can ride on that for a few days, there’s bound to be a gap eventually.\nNo matter how much of an academy it is, incidents can’t keep happening all year round, right?\nWhen I casually asked that, I got a refreshingly straightforward answer.\n[I’ll just go on hiatus?]\n“…Huh?”\n[It’s an irregular series anyway, so it’s fine!]\nWhat is fine about that?\nA sense of dread rushed over me.\nMemories came flooding back of web novels that slowly died after going on indefinite hiatuses with just an episode or two released here and there.\nOh no, this can’t be!\n“Okay, let’s give it a try. What kind of early development was there in academy stories…”\n[There are duels and dungeon raids?]\n“Shall we go with a duel?”\nIn the case of dungeon raids, those can be used plenty of times later.\nBut it’s a material that loses its flavor  if milked too many times.\nOn the other hand, duels can fit in many places.\nA duel is perfect for the Author who is constantly struggling to find material.\n[Okay! Then let me check the schedule right away…]\nAfter a short while, Claire, who had said she would end early today, returned to the classroom after visiting the office.\n“My apologies. I had planned to end early today, but the plan has changed. Could you spare some time?”\n“Huh? But you said we’d be done here!”\n“I did plan that, but apparently, there were orders to compare the students’ skill levels. We’ll be having a duel for some friendly competition.”\nThe students let out groans of displeasure.\nWell, of course.\nThey were told the first class would end early today, but now there’s additional class time.\nIt’s only natural they’d complain.\nClaire seemed aware of this, simply giving a wry smile.\n“Change into your gym  clothes and come to the training grounds. It’ll be over quickly, so could you cooperate with me?”\n“Yeah…”\nRealizing they could do nothing, the students seemed to give up.\nWe all headed to the changing rooms to change  clothes.\n[Ah yes, that’s how the chest should be…]\n“…Why are you staring like that?”\n[It’s the chest I created.]\nAren’t you being a bit too shameless?\nI tried not to look in that direction since the female students were changing clothes nearby, keeping my eyes averted as I changed.\nBut I was attacked from an unexpected angle.\nI didn’t think I’d actually be visible to you…\nWithout any room to worry about others, I hurriedly changed into my gym  clothes.\n[Ahh, what a shame. I wanted to look more.]\n“…”\nI don’t even know what to say.\nWas it because I was fidgeting for so long, trying not to look at the girls?\nBefore I knew it, I had left the now-empty changing room.\n“Alright, everyone’s here. Let’s see, with 20 students total… Okay, pair up in twos.”\nHuh?\nI looked around in bewilderment.\nEveryone else was awkwardly but surely pairing up.\nSo that’s what she meant by ‘friendly competition’…\nBut I didn’t have anyone I was friends with?\n[Hehehe, in academy novels, they often pair up, so I wanted to try it too!]\nIf only the Author were right in front of me…I would have grabbed their head and shaken it back and forth.\nIt’s such a shame that only their voice can be heard.\nI frantically turned towards Yu Siwoo and saw a blonde girl with a sword approaching him.\nOh no…!\nI slightly loosened the thread of the sleeveless shirt I had worn under my gym  clothes.\nI will wait until she is close enough to start a conversation…Then I’ll trip her!\n“Kyaa?!”\nThud.\nWith everyone’s eyes on the girl who had tripped over the thread, I quickly walked to Yu Siwoo.\n“Excuse me,  if it’s not too much trouble, would you be my partner?”\n“…Me?”\n“Yes. Haha, it’s a bit embarrassing, but I haven’t made any friends yet.”\nPlease, please, please…!\nI heard there’s nothing more awkward than being paired with a stranger.\nAnd well, I’ve also heard that guys get completely charmed by a girl acting cute.\n…Though I’ve never been with a girl before, so I don’t know  if that’s true.\nYou know, I’m also a pretty beautiful girl aside from these slit pupils that make me look suspicious.\nLong, slightly wavy jet-black hair reaching down to my chest.\nA chest size between medium and large, leaning towards the larger side.\nCaptivating red eyes with a charming smile.\nIf he’s a guy, wouldn’t he fall for an attractive girl like me  if I bat my eyelashes and act cute?\nYu Siwoo and I would have inevitably become friends anyway.\nWhich is better—becoming friends with Yu Siwoo by any means necessary or being awkwardly paired with a stranger?\nDefinitely the former!\nOkay, I’ll swallow my embarrassment and give it a try.\n“Won’t you please be my partner?”\n[Wow, you’re flirting…]\nBe quiet, Author.\nI’ll slightly bend my body and give him a sweet smile here!\nHow’s that…!\nI’ll even tilt my head a bit and flutter my eyelashes charmingly!\nHe’ll be smitten for sure! He’ll want to duel with me, right?!\n…Huh, why isn’t he reacting?\n“How strange…”\n“I-I’ll do it! I will be your partner!”\nHmm…?\nI thought maybe he was the type who wasn’t interested in women, considering my failed seduction attempt.\nBut then he suddenly and urgently accepted.\nWhat’s going on?\nNot that I mind avoiding the worst outcome…\n“Then, I’m in your care.”\nLet me give you one last service.\nI gave him a coy smile.\nHow’s that? Pretty cute, right?\n***\n“Kyaa?!”\nOne of the students approaching Yu Siwoo suddenly tumbled to the ground.\nThe loud noise made him instinctively turn his head, only to find a woman now standing before him.\nIt was Arte Iris.\n“Excuse me,  if it’s not too much trouble, would you be my partner?”\n“…Me?”\nYu Siwoo already knew she was talking to him, but he still looked behind himself.\n‘Please don’t let it be me!’\n“Yes. Haha, it’s a bit embarrassing, but I haven’t made any friends yet.”\n‘If you don’t have friends, then go make some!’\nHe wanted to retort but didn’t have the courage to do so against Arte.\nThe dagger in her hand was an excellent deterrent.\nShe kept tossing it up and catching it absentmindedly, but…\nTo Yu Siwoo, who viewed her as suspicious, it was an unsettling action.\n“Won’t you please be my partner?”\n‘Should I accept this?’\nHis brain had probably never been this active in his entire life before.\nCountless simulations flashed through his mind.\n…And then, Arte brought her face close to his.\nShe tilted her head slightly, looking up at him—to anyone else, this would look like an adorable act from a pretty girl.\n‘But I won’t be fooled.’\nShe definitely has some ulterior motive for approaching.\nAs proof, look.\nThrough those slit eyelids that make her seem like she is squinting from a forced smile, he can faintly see her eyes.\nThose eyes were piercing right through him.\nOkay, I’ll refuse her here…\n“How strange…”\nThe moment I resolved to refuse her,\nHer smile vanished, and the dagger she had caught in her right hand glinted in the sunlight.\nSeeing that expression, all the simulated outcomes in Yu Siwoo’s mind were wiped clean.\n“I-I’ll do it! I will be your partner!”\nBefore he knew it, he urgently accepted her offer.\nIt felt like  if he refused, he might not wake up tomorrow.\n“Then, I’m in your care.”\nHer faint smile looked like a demon’s grin.\nAs  if she had caught her prey.\nYu Siwoo then thought,\nHe’ll have to say goodbye to sleep.\nTranslator’s Corner\nI’ll try doing daily uploads for the most part, so yeah.\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "TN: Thank Dragons33 for reaching the goal.\n“Alright, let’s begin the duels. Everyone get ready. Watch the students in the earlier duels and share your impressions. Also, keep them in mind in your own battles.”\n[Finally, it’s starting! Wow!]\n“First, let’s start in the determined order.”\nI looked at the paper in my hand.\nIt said 10–the last pair.\n[Hehe, as expected, the protagonist appears last! Is that okay?]\n“It’s fine.”\nThe duel order was determined by drawing lots, but it didn’t matter to the Author and me.\nProbability doesn’t apply to us.\nIf the Author wants, we can do anything as long as it’s plausible.\nDelaying the protagonist’s appearance to the end is nothing.\n“What do you think?”\n“H-huh?! Wh, what do you mean…?”\nWhy is he so startled?\nHis breathing also seems labored.\nDid I tease him too much? Surely he hasn’t actually fallen for me?\n“About the students dueling right now. Do they seem skilled?”\n“…I guess. That girl with the spear is strong, but her opponent is too weak. It’ll be over soon.”\nHe’s switching between polite and casual speaking.\nPutting that aside, I agree it’ll likely end quickly.\nThe blonde girl presses with her long-range spear, while the other female student can’t react at all.\nIt doesn’t seem like she can keep the spear in her vision, let alone match the speed.\n“Ah, it’s over.”\n“…He couldn’t react at all. Can you guess what her ability is?”\n“I’m not sure exactly, but I can guess roughly.”\nOne can enhance their physical abilities using mana, but she seemed to be on another level.\nIt has to be an ability.\nProbably some kind of physical enhancement.\n[They’re both heroine candidates, don’t you think they’re pretty?]\n“Hmm…”\nI can see the blonde spearwoman being one, but that other girl, too?\nWell, there is a heroine type that starts out as an underdog before a makeover…\nMaybe that’s her role; the protagonist will discover and help resolve her issues.\n“…Any other candidates?”\n[Hmm, not at this point. Having too many from the same class would be a bit much… Maybe later during the swordsmanship class?]\nI see.\nThen, I don’t need to pay much attention to the rest.\nI watched the second duel start with a disinterested gaze.\nThe duel level was certainly higher than the previous one.\nBut they were still lacking.\nNo one seemed stronger than the spear-wielding heroine candidate.\nThe third, fourth, and fifth duel passed.\nBefore I knew it, the eighth duel had started, but no one seemed stronger than that first girl I saw.\n…The other girl might have lasted a bit longer against someone else.\n“Next up is the last duel! Once this is over, class is dismissed, so the rest of you can take a break!”\n“Ah, that’s us. Shall we go up?”\n“…Yeah.”\n[Kyaa, kyaa! The protagonist’s going to fight! Hurry!]\nThey don’t need to rush me; they’ll get to see it soon enough.\nWe took our positions on the stage.\nThe protagonist, Yu Siwoo, had his sword drawn with a stern expression.\n“Ready? Start!”\nWhat if I lose right at the start?\nI haven’t heard how strong the protagonist is supposed to be.\nIt would be embarrassing to lose instantly, so I hope to at least put up a decent fight.\nI tensed up, waiting for Yu Siwoo to attack, but he didn’t make a move even after a while.\n…What’s going on?\n“What’s wrong, you two? Is there some issue?”\n“No, there’s no problem at all.”\n“…I see.”\nEven the homeroom teacher found our lack of movement strange.\n…I should probably make a move soon.\n“Aren’t you coming at me?”\n“…”\nYu Siwoo stayed silent, his sword pointed at me.\nIt doesn’t seem like he plans to take the initiative.\n[Uuu, I thought you said you’d start!]\n“Well, I can’t help it… I’ll go first then.”\nWith the teacher watching, the Author complaining about when we’ll start, and Yu Siwoo showing no intention of making the first move, I have no choice.\nI’ll go to him.\nThe thread from the lining of my inner  clothes began rushing towards him as I loosened it.\n“…!”\n“…Good judgment, I’ll give you praise for that.”\nI admired how he evaded the rapidly approaching threads instead of trying to deflect them.\nIf the threads touched his weapon, he’d have been instantly bound and disarmed.\nHe seemed slightly startled before finally speaking.\n“I saw you bind a monster with those threads, so I won’t try to deflect them.”\n“I see… Then how about this!”\nI unleashed another wave of threads to attack. Let’s see how he reacts.\nTing!\nThe threads fell to the floor as the sound of metal clashing with each other rang out.\n“…You deflected them instead of evading?”\n“I also saw you cut through concrete before.”\n“My, you’re more perceptive than I thought.”\nSo he was watching that too?\nI’m starting to enjoy this.\nIs this the power of the protagonist? He’s quite skilled at gathering information.\n[Ahem, our protagonist’s ability is intuition! He excels at perceiving physical threats!]\n“Intuition, huh…”\nThat’s a good ability.\nEven if an invisible person attacked, he could counterattack with the ability to sense threats.\nHis ability to distinguish my visually identical threads is even more impressive.\nAlthough his physical potential may not be outstanding, the protagonist can probably overcome that by growing his ability.\n“Wait, how did you know my…!”\n“Well then, here I go again! Can you handle this?”\nIf that’s the case, maybe an unavoidable attack will work.\nI expended one side of my inner wear in a widespread indiscriminate attack around Yu Siwoo.\nHis intuition would be useless if he couldn’t evade the attack.\n“Phew, phew… That was close.”\n“…You’re more impressive than I thought. I like it.”\nWoah, is that even possible?\nI thought he’d be done if I attacked without giving him a chance to evade, even with his intuition.\nBut it seems my overwhelming thread coverage was still not enough.\nHe deflected the threads he could, letting them collide with other threads, and slipped through the gaps.\nIs he even human? That’s just unfair if someone with insane basic stats has that kind of ability!\n“Okay, then next is…”\n[I don’t like this.]\nAs I was about to unleash my remaining threads, the Author’s gloomy voice interjected.\n“What don’t you like…?”\n“…?”\nSuddenly?\nI have no idea why the Author’s mood has soured so much.\nWith no further attacks coming, the protagonist shot me a questioning look while catching his breath.\nThe Author’s tone was uncharacteristically subdued. If this isn’t a joke, who knows what might happen if I provoke them further.\n[I can’t even see the protagonist’s first appearance! It’s their first duel, but…! This won’t do! The protagonist doesn’t even seem strong. You’re outperforming him!]\n“Oh, oops…”\nAh, I forgot the most important thing!\nSo absorbed in finally testing an opponent, my desire to see the protagonist’s strength took over.\nThey never came at me, and it was my first time really cutting loose with my ability, so I got too excited.\nI should have played up the protagonist instead…!\n[I’m mad…! Hmph!]\n“That…this is really troubling…”\nWhat do I do?\nThe Author is totally angry now.\nIt’s my fault this time, so I have no excuse.\n“I forfeit.”\n“…What? Are you serious, Arte?”\n“Yes, completely serious.”\n[You ruined the protagonist’s first duel, Reader! Waaaaaah!]\nThe confused stares of the students and bewildered teacher fell upon me, but I was too busy to pay attention.\nI had to placate the crying Author first.\nMaking the protagonist win is easier to retcon later, anyway.\n“This, this is going to be hard to fix…”\n[Waaaaaaaaah!]\n***\n“She uses threads…”\nThe woman had approached hoping to duel the man who took down the monster, but\nShe had tripped and fallen over something.\nBy the time she got back up, he had already paired up with someone else.\nWith no choice, she ended up getting paired with the remaining student.\n‘…When I tripped, I thought I saw a glimpse of black threads but dismissed it as my imagination.’\nCould it be…?\n“And what’s up with her forfeiting after clearly winning? How ridiculous.”\nShe had completely overwhelmed and dominated that male student the entire time.\nShe could have just kept draining his stamina for an easy win.\nBut then suddenly, she says she doesn’t like it, calls it troubling, and mumbles some weird things before declaring her forfeit.\nIt’s not like she was joking around.\nThe other students looked dumbfounded, but I was angry.\nIf you can’t show your full strength, fine, but mocking your opponent and throwing away the win is unacceptable!\n“Arte Iris…Didn’t she help resolve the monster attack?”\nThe woman had hoped to befriend her after hearing she and someone else took down the monster while the other students evacuated.\nBut who could have imagined she would be such a deceitful person?\nWas subduing the monster for another purpose as well?\nHer skills certainly seem real.\nBut she could not abide by that suspicious behavior and poor sportsmanship.\nShe does not seem fit to be an academy student.\n“I, Amelia, will be watching…!”\nAmelia firmly resolved to judge if that woman was fit for the academy!\nTranslator’s Corner\nI know I mentioned that I was doing daily chapters, but have another one. Again, thank Dragons33 for bringing you this chapter. If you want to support me, get more chapters, or both, consider supporting me on ko-fi.\nAlso, I tried finding any art for the other characters. There isn’t even fan art. All I can really find is Arte and Author, so comment below if you want me to compile it for you guys. (Only Arte ones, at least, since we haven’t gotten the Author’s appearance described yet.)\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "TN: Thank Dragons33 for yet another chapter.\n[Are you really going to do it?]\n“Of course.”\nThe next morning.\nThe Author was still uneasy, so they asked me again  if I would do it.\nI had agreed, but still,\nI wanted to refuse.\nWhile trying to reassure the Author, they suggested an idea.\nI got scared and said I didn’t want to, which made them start crying, so I had no choice but to say I would do it.\n…To be honest, I’m still a little reluctant to do it.\nBut I have no choice.  If I want to resolve the Author’s sulking, I must keep my promise.\n[Hehe…  If you observe the protagonist all day, you’ll definitely get lots of material!]\n“…”\nThat’s right.\nThere’s no point in hiding it.\nAs compensation for ruining the protagonist Yu Siwoo’s debut, what the Author demanded of me is something I originally planned to do anyway.\nMonitoring the protagonist.\nBut then why did I refuse at first?\nThey wanted 24-hour monitoring.\nIt’s very different from just casually observing him as he trained.\nLiteral 24-hour monitoring.\nFrom this morning until tomorrow morning.\nI thought just monitoring the events happening inside the academy would be enough, but the Author thought differently.\nSomething about the protagonist’s daily life could also provide material or something like that.\nNo matter how much I tried to persuade them that a male protagonist’s daily life wouldn’t be needed in an academy novel, they were unmoved.\nThey even said monitoring once during ordinary days and once during his date with the heroines would be more profitable, proclaiming it was good material.\nBut the protagonist and I have our own private lives to tend to…\nThis time, I have no choice.\nI silently apologized to Yu Siwoo, who will be monitored all day and night by me.\nSince I can’t blatantly tell him that I’ll be monitoring him,\nI’ll just have to monitor him without him noticing at all.\nHmm, I’m a little worried about whether I can really do it well.\n[Ooh, I’m looking forward to it. I wonder what kind of day he’ll have…! Maybe a ton of crazy incidents and accidents will happen?!]\n“Even  if he’s the protagonist, I don’t think his ordinary days are that eventful…”\nNo matter how I think about it, I don’t believe the kind of scenes the Author wants will happen.\nEven  if he’s the protagonist, it’s not like the kinds of events you’d see in novels happen to him every single day, right?\n[No way! Of course they will, since he’s the protagonist!]\nWhat is the basis for this unfounded confidence?\nI let out a small sigh.\n“I guess I have no choice. Just this one time, right?”\n[Ehehe…! This will be fun…!]\nFun for who?\nI just hope they don’t end up disappointed.\n***\n“From now on, you all will be learning ethics.”\nThe muscular male teacher entered the classroom and spoke.\nThe students, who had naturally assumed they would be training their abilities or learning how to become stronger, protested loudly.\n“Not practical training?”\n“We came to the academy to become heroes, you know.”\nYu Siwoo could sympathize with his classmates’ complaints.\nThey had worked hard since childhood, training to become heroes, and passed through the academy’s difficult entrance exam.\nSo, of course, they assumed they would be training themselves and learning techniques.\nBut ethics out of nowhere?\nThe teacher smirked at the protesting students.\n“Yes, I knew you all would hate this. Your seniors all felt the same way too.”\n“Then why…!”\n“But despite all the opposition, this class has always been kept. The reason is simple–you need this class to become heroes.”\nBecause we need it to become heroes?\nThe students started paying closer attention to what the teacher was saying.\nIt seemed he was about to say something important.\n“Math, science, literature, English… You all probably only learned those basic general knowledge levels.”\n“Of course. We didn’t have enough time for more with all the training.”\n“Exactly. You don’t need to learn those in-depth. Heroes don’t need to be great at math or know science perfectly.”\nThe teacher stopped a female student who was about to say something.\n“Indeed, you all came here to become heroes, and you all indeed have stronger senses of justice than ordinary students your age. I know that well.”\n“Then why do we need to learn ethics at all? We’re just wasting time…”\n“That’s precisely why you need to learn the most essential ethics. Tell me, what do you think heroes do?”\nSuddenly put on the spot by the teacher’s question, the flustered female student–Amelia, or so he remembered–hesitated before answering.\n“Defeating monsters and catching villains.”\n“Right. More precisely, protecting citizens from threats.”\n“And what does that have to do with ethics…!”\nThe teacher questioned the protesting girl.\n“Do you have firm certainty that you all won’t become villains yourselves?”\n“…Huh?”\n“In other words, do you have any guarantee that you won’t end up as a villain?”\n“Of course not! We’re aiming to become heroes…!”\n“You all must not have heard that there are cases of academy graduates turning into villains.”\n“?!”\nNot just Amelia but many students were shocked by that statement.\nAcademy graduates becoming villains?\n“That, that can’t be…”\n“Unfortunately, it’s true. Graduates can turn villains by getting drunk on power or being scouted by criminal organizations. There are also more nefarious methods.”\nAn academy student becoming a villain.\nYu Siwoo glanced sideways at Arte, then quickly averted his gaze forward.\nBecause his eyes had met Arte’s subtle smirk aimed at him.\n“And we can’t preemptively eliminate any potential for villainy from you all, either.”\nStomp, stomp.\nThe teacher paced around the students, probably trying to set the mood.\nThe students, who had started concentrating on his words, were met with his sharp gaze.\n“That’s why we can only rely on your consciences, which is why we teach ethics. It’s a minimum safeguard, so to speak.”\n“You really think a mere class like this can prevent us from turning villainous?”\n“I don’t know. But it’s better than nothing, isn’t it?”\n“…”\n“If you’re convinced, take your seats. Class is starting.”\nLost in thought, Yu Siwoo’s heart grew complex as well.\nThere are cases of academy students turning villains…\nThen could villains also be infiltrating the academy to begin with?\nA chill ran down Yu Siwoo’s spine from the gaze he felt on his back.\nOn the way home, Yu Siwoo’s heart was troubled.\nEthics. He had never really thought about it seriously before.\nCome to think of it, what the teacher said wasn’t wrong.\nFor villains, seducing a hero means gaining an ally while eliminating an enemy.\nPlus, as always, destroying is easier than protecting.\nHeroes are always overwhelmed with tasks.\nUnconsciously looking around, Yu Siwoo noticed scenery he normally would have ignored.\nSomeone naturally littering after eating.\nSomeone spitting on the ground.\nThese were signs he would normally have dismissed but now made him frown in discomfort.\nSuppressing his discomfort enough, he continued on his way home.\nAhead of him, an elderly woman was pulling a cart uphill.\n“…Grandma, would you like some help?”\n“Oh? You’ll help me? Thank you.”\nSomeone who needed help, which normally he would have missed noticing, now caught his eye.\nSo Yu Siwoo helped pull the elderly woman’s cart up the hill.\nOnce they reached the top, the grandma smiled.\n“Thank you. I was able to get up easily thanks to you.”\n“No problem.”\nAlthough embarrassed, having someone thank him for his help warmed his heart.\nYes, the teacher was right.\nHeroes exist to help others, after all.\nEthics really are important…\n“…!”\nThe warmth in his heart that had bloomed suddenly withered as  if winter had arrived.\n“Just now… Behind that utility pole…”\nHe thought he saw a head of wavy black hair reaching down to the chest—the hairstyle of the person worrying him recently.\nThe once warm breeze felt chillingly cold now.\nNo, that couldn’t be.\nThere’s no way Arte could be here.\nIt was definitely just someone with a similar hairstyle… Probably.\nHis thumping heart was deafening.\nArte Iris.\n‘She is definitely following me.’\nThere’s no mistaking those slit pupils.\n“What in the world…!”\nCould it be?\nThe teacher had mentioned there are cases of academy students becoming villains.\n‘Is she trying to seduce me to the villain side?’\nIs that why she’s been watching?\nHe couldn’t tell.\nWhat reason does she have for following him like this?\nA chill ran down his spine, and he drew the curtains shut as soon as he got home.\n“Phew, phew…”\nHis ragged breathing was unsettling, knowing he was being followed.\nMemories of her actions flashed through my mind.\nHacking the academy’s database, taking an unusual interest in me, and somehow being involved in the monster incident.\nPlus, according to the teacher, the incident was caused by a criminal’s blunder.\nI don’t know  if the criminal was Arte’s accomplice. But orchestrating the incident is no ordinary feat.\nThere is definitely some grand conspiracy hidden behind it all.\nWhat’s certain is that she is plotting some event with the being she calls the “Author,” and she has taken an interest in me.\n“…Is she gone?”\nI peeked through the curtains slightly.\nNight had already fallen… Surely she had left by…\n“…!”\nYu Siwoo hastily closed the curtains again.\nShe’s there, she’s there!\nIt was blurry, but he saw her.\nShe was definitely watching this place!\n“Why, why is she doing this to me…”\nAs indignant as I felt, Yu Siwoo couldn’t cry out loudly.\nHe was afraid of provoking Arte, who was watching outside.\nYu Siwoo leaped onto the bed and pulled the covers over himself.\nLike hiding after watching a scary movie as a child.\nTeardrops rolled down his eyes, dampening the pillow.\nThat night, Yu Siwoo couldn’t sleep at all.\nTranslator’s Corner\nThat is the end of the bonus chapters. Hopefully, I can relax with the single chapters now.\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "“Huaaam…”\n[Dear Reader, are you sleepy?]\n“Well, of course…”\nIt would be strange  if I wasn’t sleepy, right?\nI stayed up all night, boringly watching the front of Yu Siwoo’s house.\nNo matter how young my body has become, I’m still tired.\n[…I’m a bit disappointed. Since you’re the protagonist, I thought some incident would happen.]\n“I told you that just because I’m the protagonist doesn’t mean something’s always happening.”\nIf there was an incident every year, my body wouldn’t last.\nI’m not always involved in incidents just because I’m the protagonist.\nThankfully, it seems the Author understands and isn’t too disappointed.\n“Huaaam…”\n“Ah, hello.”\n“?!”\nI waited for Yu Siwoo to come out and timed my greeting.\nWhat’s wrong, why is he so surprised?\n…Was I found out? Nah, it couldn’t be.\nHe must have been confused by running into such a pretty girl first thing in the morning.\n“What a coincidence. I guess you must live around here?”\n“Y-Yeah… That’s right.”\n“You look tired, you shouldn’t be. You need to get plenty of sleep.”\nI smiled at him.\nGood, that should have raised his affection for me.\nBy the way, why does Yu Siwoo have such dark circles?\nDid he not sleep well? Why?\n[Reader! Reader! Let’s walk to the academy with Siwoo!]\nThe Author started cheering excitedly.\nI have no choice.\n“Since we’ve run into each other, why don’t we walk to the academy together?”\n“T-Together…?”\n“Yes, together.”\nYu Siwoo nodded, and the Author cheered.\nThey seem happy to be able to keep watching the protagonist they’re writing about.\nThey’ve completely forgotten their anger now.\n“Hehe, I’m also looking forward to the academy life.”\nI should keep smiling.\nMaybe acting friendly will help improve his sullen expression a bit.\nDue to her tired, narrowed vision, Arte didn’t notice Yu Siwoo’s stiff expression.\n***\n“Okay, everyone. You worked hard sitting at your desks yesterday. We won’t do any theory today, so don’t worry.”\n“Oooooh…!”\nThe students started getting excited at Professor Claire’s words.\nThey must really dislike theory lessons.\nWell, I hated studying too when I was their age.\nI’m no different, am I?\n“So, Author. What do you have planned for today?”\n[Umm… We’ve already done weapon selection and duels, so I wanted to do a mana measurement today!]\n“Mana measurement? But isn’t that something usually done at the entrance ceremony…?”\nYeah, that’s right.\nMana measurements and special trait confirmations are usually done at the very beginning, at the entrance ceremony.\nThey put their hand on the crystal and go, “Woooah! This guy has an incredible amount of mana! He’s a promising student!”\nOr “Woooah, an S-rank trait! Amazing!”\nWe’ve done things out of order.\nNow that I think about it, we did the duels before measuring it.\n[Ehehe… Well! The plan was to do it at the entrance ceremony, but the device was broken during the monster attack, and the replacement just arrived now.]\n“Hmm…”\nThe way they’re being evasive tells me they probably just forgot.\nThey got too focused on the monster attack and forgot about that detail.\nWell, it’s a plausible enough setup, so I’ll let it slide.\nIf I nitpick the Author too much and they get annoyed when it matters, that could be bad.\nI should let some things go once in a while.\n“Today, we’ll be measuring your mana. It was supposed to happen at the entrance ceremony, but as you all know, there was an issue.”\nThe students started murmuring.\nTalking about betting on who would be stronger, you can’t beat me; it’s immature stuff like that.\n“And after the mana measurements, we’ll also have club sign-ups, so keep that in mind.”\n…Clubs?\n[You know, those clubs that go looking for events that others can’t find! Legal ways for academy students to leave campus!]\n“Ah, I see.”\nThey mean those clubs the protagonists are always joining to leave the academy.\nPlaces where they can bring back things from outside.\nAfter Professor Claire finished going over today’s schedule and returned to the staff room, there was a short break.\nI used that time to slip away from the students so I could talk to the Author in private without distractions.\nIt seemed like an important conversation.\nIt’s hard to focus with all the students chattering.\n…Hmm, this spot should work.\nI found a secluded area behind the academy where people don’t seem to pass through much.\n“It’s going to be hard to find entertainment outside the academy walls, Author.”\n[Yeah, you’re right. There’s that saying that academy novels get incredibly boring after they leave for the first time…]\nRight. It’s the curse of academy-based novels.\nThey get incredibly boring once they leave the academy grounds.\nWell, brief excursions are excluded.\nOf course, there are exceptions, but…\nI’ve seen a novel or two where the readers dropped off when they left the academy setting in the middle or later parts.\nOf course, they’ll have to leave the academy eventually.\nYou can’t just have the whole novel take place there.\nBut for the Author to be looking outside the academy for material this early in the beginning…\nThe Author seems to be running out of ideas and looking for new material.\nTo prevent the Author from getting writer’s block, I tossed out a decent plot idea.\n“What about searching for treasure within the academy? Doesn’t that sound fun, Author?”\n[Treasure hunt within the academy…?]\n“Uhuhuh…a secret room hidden by the academy’s founder, a special artifact hidden inside… Wouldn’t that be fun?”\nDoesn’t that sound like a good plot?\nNot bad for something I came up with quickly, I think.\nIt’s better than leaving the academy right from the start.\nWe can go with a treasure hunt storyline while at the academy.\n“A dangerous artifact hidden by the founder that risks being stolen from the academy by someone, and the students have to stop it… Wouldn’t that work as a broad outline?”\n[Ooooh! That does sound fun! It could provide material for a while. As expected of  the Reader! You’re a genius!]\n“Aw, you’re giving me too much credit.”\nStill, the compliment made me smile a little.\nSeems the time I spent reading web novels wasn’t completely wasted.\nAcademy novels need to have the events happen within the academy itself.\nIf you establish a solid core premise, the details will come naturally.\nLet’s start by building a solid foundation.\n[A force trying to obtain an artifact that could literally upend the world  if brought outside…! Oh, I like it! That can be the evil force we’re up against!]\n“An artifact that could flip the world? Sounds exciting. Hehehe…”\n[Hmm, what kind of ability should the artifact have?]\n“There is no need to rush it. Take it slow–real slow–and the right idea will come.”\n[Okay! Ah, I’m looking forward to this. I wonder how it will unfold to be exciting!]\n“I’m looking forward to seeing how Yu Siwoo will act going forward…”\nAs I was chatting and laughing with the Author, I suddenly thought–why not try out that cliche scene?\nI’ve wanted to do it for a while.\nAlright, let me shoot my shot.\n[…? Reader? What are you doing?]\n“Just a moment.”\nI shushed the Author in a small voice.\nThey sounded puzzled but did as I said, which I appreciated.\n“You there, come on out.”\nI spoke the line I had prepared.\nIsn’t this the kind of line you have to use for scenes like this? Sounds cool, doesn’t it?\nI drew the dagger I had hidden and aimed it at a tree I had targeted… Taking aim.\n“If you don’t come out… Then I’ll have to make you.”\nAnd throw.\nThe dagger left my hand and lodged itself in the trunk of a tree.\nCompletely missing the direction I was aiming at.\n[Reader, you missed spectacularly…]\n“…”\nWell, I missed my target by a bit…\nIt’s not like someone who has never properly held a knife could throw a dagger perfectly, right?\n[Wow, to be able to throw it in a completely different direction from where you were aiming, that’s kind of a talent in itself, isn’t it?]\n“Hah, haha… Be quiet. It seems I was mistaken.”\n[So you like scenes like that, huh… Well, I’ll keep it in mind. It would be nice  if a scene  the Reader enjoys ends up in the novel someday!]\nMy face felt hot.\nI shouldn’t have done that.\nNo, but I couldn’t help myself.\nIf you’re in a secluded area holding a dagger,\nAnd on top of that, having a conversation with someone,\nIsn’t that the classic cliche of someone eavesdropping on an important conversation?\nI just wanted to try it out.\n“Let’s head back. Class is about to start.”\n[The Reader’s preferences are eavesdropping or spying scenes. Noted…]\nBe quiet!\nA guy can enjoy that kind of thing too, you know!\n…Oh right, I didn’t retrieve the dagger.\nOh well, it’s just a standard academy model anyway.\nI’ll ask for another one later.\n***\nA few minutes after Arte had left the area,\nA blonde girl with bangs braided peeked out from the tree the dagger was stuck in.\nYes, it was Amelia.\n“Huff… huff… My, my heart hurts. I thought I was going to die.”\nHaving held her breath so her sounds wouldn’t be heard, she gasped heavily to catch her breath.\nHer legs, tense from the excessive strain, didn’t seem like they would move for a while.\nAmelia let out a sigh.\n“I just wanted to confirm who that student was, so why did this happen…”\nRight.\nThat rude girl who ditched the duel had gone to a secluded area,\nSo out of curiosity, just a tiny bit of curiosity,\nShe had followed after her.\n“A secret room? An artifact that could upend the world? What is that about?!”\nShe had never heard of such things before.\nIs the academy’s founder hiding away an artifact like that?\nShe didn’t want to believe it.\nShe had wanted to dismiss it as the delusions of a girl with chuunibyou, but the dagger she saw in her vision,\nThat dagger flew right at her despite being in a completely different direction than she was facing.\nSeemed to be telling her that what she heard was the truth.\n“Yu Siwoo, I think that’s what he was called.”\nShe recalled her saying that name before leaving her spot.\nShe was looking forward to how Yu Siwoo would act.\nWas she taking some kind of interest in the one who resolved the monster incident?\nOr perhaps Yu Siwoo was also an accomplice of Arte Iris, and they knew each other?\nShe felt a need to meet Yu Siwoo herself.\n“Uu, uuh. I need to use the bathroom…! Legs, please move…!”\nBut first, the bathroom.",

      "content": "“Come on, stand in a line. Before we start the measurements…”\nClaire’s voice rang out.\nFrom explaining the precautions for measuring mana to describing the actions to avoid, her voice detailed the overall rules in a monotonous and sleep-inducing manner, causing the students’ attention to become scattered.\n“Hey, who do you think will get the highest score?”\n“What do you mean? Obviously, those two.”\n“Ah, the ones who took down the monsters?”\n“Yeah.”\nYu Siwoo’s ears perked up.\nWell of course, since they were talking about him.\nIt was an extremely interesting topic too.\nWho was stronger?\n“I can’t believe they easily took down Grade 3 monsters.”\n“Right? They even took one down each apparently. Ah, what talent.”\n“Um, ahem…”\nSiwoo lowered his head and covered his mouth as much as possible.\nHe felt a mix of elation at the flattering praise and embarrassment at having his story told in a public place.\nIt was a contradictory feeling of not wanting to hear it, but also wanting to at the same time.\n“But between those two, don’t you think that girl is stronger?”\n“Ah, that suspicious one.”\nJolt.\nSiwoo’s elated mood instantly sank.\nHe had a feeling he knew who they were talking about.\nIf it was a suspicious girl who seemed stronger than him, there was only one person it could be.\nHonestly, he didn’t think he could beat her.\nThe look in her eyes right before she forfeited that time.\nA smile like she had found an amusing toy.\nThe attack he dodged with all his might was probably a casual move to her.\nHer nonchalance made that clear.\nAnd yet that woman showed some inexplicable interest in me…\n‘What on earth should I do?’\nYu Siwoo, who had lost his good mood, sighed.\n“You’re Yu Siwoo, right?”\n“…Huh? Yeah, but…”\nTurning his head toward the unfamiliar high-pitched voice calling his name.\n“You’re…”\n“Amelia. You can call me that also.”\n“Oh, okay. Nice to meet you.”\nA classmate, huh?\nThe girl who overwhelmed her opponent with incredible speed during her duel left quite an impression.\nWhy is she showing interest in me?\nWe’ve never spoken even once before.\n“Say, about you… Could it be that…”\nAmelia seemed to struggle to get her words out.\nWhat is she trying to say?\nGathering her patience, she took a deep breath and spoke.\n“What’s your relationship with Arte Iris?”\n“…Arte? Why would you bring up that woman?”\nThe fleeting pink delusion that crossed Yu Siwoo’s mind instantly dissipated.\nFor a moment, just a moment, he thought spring may have come for him, too.\nBut it was still the harsh winds of winter.\n“…I see. It doesn’t seem like you’re her accomplice. I guess I can trust you to some degree.”\n“What’s going on?”\nShe asks if he had any relationship with that suspicious woman, then suddenly seems relieved when met with an ambiguous answer?\nI can’t understand what she’s talking about at all!\n“It seems she’s interested in you, so let me tell you. There’s a terrifying plot brewing within this academy…!”\n“I’d appreciate it if you could explain in more detail.”\nYu Siwoo’s expression instantly turned serious.\nA plot within the academy?\nHe needed to hear more to verify its authenticity.\nBut one thing is certain–it’s related to Arte again.\nAnd Amelia seems to have information about her.\n‘The chance to learn about the woman whose motives I can’t fathom has come to me!’\n“Next, Yu Siwoo! It’s your turn!”\n“…It seems I can’t say more right now. Let’s meet at lunchtime.”\n“Okay. I’ll wait for you on the bench in the park.”\nAs he got up to go to the measuring device, Claire encouraged him.\n“There is no need to be so stiff. You’ll get great results for sure.”\n“Yes. Thank you for your concern.”\n‘It seems I made her unnecessarily worry.’\nWhen Yu Siwoo placed his hand on the measuring device, people let out exclamations of admiration.\nAn immense amount of mana, incredible talent, and so on.\nBut he couldn’t feel happy.\nHis mind was focused on Arte.\nShe was smirking at him.\n***\n“That’s as far as I’ve heard.”\n“Ah, there’s a secret room inside the academy like that?”\n“Shh! Keep your voice down!”\nOops.\nYu Siwoo quickly shut his mouth and quietly looked around.\nHis voice got too loud without him realizing it.\n…Thankfully, no one seems to be watching, though.\nThey let out sighs of relief together.\n“Phew, that was a close one… But you get what I’m saying, right? You never know who might be listening.”\n“Sorry. I was just too surprised.”\n“Well, if what you said is true…to think the monster attack was orchestrated…”\n“It’s not confirmed yet, though.”\n“You said you overheard her muttering to herself even before the incident occurred?”\nThat’s true, but…\nYu Siwoo’s heart grew conflicted.\nIt felt like the academy’s security he respected had been breached far too easily.\n“Honestly, it’s hard for me to believe what you’re telling me, too.”\n“Same here, you know?”\nNeither of us could fully believe the other’s stories.\nBut we didn’t refute them either.\nI just had an inexplicable certainty that it was plausible because it was her.\nWe simply compared our accounts.\n“Okay, let me summarize. She somehow caused the monster incident and instantly hacked the academy’s database. Right?”\n“Yes.”\n“She was also monitoring your house. Afterward, she talked about some secret room in the academy storing a powerful artifact… Is that about it?”\n“Will you tell the teachers about…”\n“Could I? That she instantly hacked the database? Do you think they’d believe me? I’d just be labeled a madwoman and demoted from academy student to a mental hospital patient.”\nWell, that’s true.\nWithout evidence, there’s no way the teachers would believe them.\nHer behavior is suspicious, but her status is just that of a student.\nThey’ll likely think they’re slandering her out of jealousy and face backlash.\n“Hmm…”\nAfter exchanging information, they both fell into contemplation.\n‘As academy students, what could we do against this grand conspiracy?’\nThat seemed to be Amelia’s concern, but Yu Siwoo’s was different.\n‘Why me…?’\nAmelia had coincidentally discovered Arte’s suspicious behavior, but him?\nTrue, his initial suspicions were also a coincidence.\nBut after that, Arte approached him herself.\nIt felt so unfair.\nEveryone else was making friends and enjoying their school life normally.\nBut he got caught up in all this shady talk about grand conspiracies and whatnot right after entering the academy in a shady place not frequented by students.\n“Okay, I’ve decided.”\n“On what?”\n“I’m going to become her friend.”\n“…What?”\nFor a moment, he couldn’t comprehend what Amelia said so bluntly.\nBecome friends? With Arte Iris?\n“In terms of her status, she’s just an academy student. She attends classes regularly, and she seems like an ordinary student from the outside.”\n“That may be, but friends?”\n“Not just friends. My goal is to become a close friend who’s always with her inside the academy.”\nSuddenly become friends with Arte?\n…Could it be that she wants to…\n“You don’t mean you want to live with her…?”\n“What are you talking about? Of course, it’s to keep an eye on her.”\nAh.\nI felt embarrassed for even considering that thought momentarily.\nRight, of course.\nShe seems too righteous to get close to Arte for that reason.\n“You mentioned this ‘Author’ person, right?”\n“Yeah, that’s what she called them.”\n“I’ve heard about this ‘Author’ too… There must definitely be some means for her to contact them. We need to seize that.”\n“How?”\n“It will be easier for me, as another girl, to get close to her than for you, a guy. So I’ll definitely become her close friend.”\nAh, so that’s why she wants to be friends.\nLike Amelia said, if we became close friends who stuck together at all times in the academy, it would be difficult for Arte to contact this ‘Author.’\nWe could easily track her movements, too.\nIf we could somehow create an opening and seize her means of contacting the ‘Author’…\n“We could convince the teachers then.”\n“Right. With evidence, we could. Conveniently, we’re choosing clubs for the next period, so if I join the same club as her…”\n“What kind of conversation are you two having?”\nWe instantly froze at the voice that suddenly came from behind, accompanied by a head popping out.\nBlack hair.\nA smiling face.\nBut in contrast to the expression, piercing red eyes.\nArte.\n“Ha, haha… How much did you hear…?”\n“Hm? I just got here. I didn’t hear anything?”\n“Oh, I see. …We were just discussing which clubs to join. Amelia, this girl, and I were thinking of joining together. …Right?”\n“Huh?! Yes! That’s right! We got a bit carried away and didn’t notice our surroundings. Ha, haha…”\nDid she really not hear?\n‘We’re saved…’\n***\n[Hmm, I wonder why they’re sweating so much. Is it hot?]\nWell, I didn’t hear what they were talking about, so I can’t answer your question either, Author.\n[Geez, speaking of which, the main character is already alone with a heroine?! Kyaa!]\nWhat are you talking about?\nThey just said they were discussing clubs, didn’t they?\nTo think they were dating already when they just met–that’s impossible, right?\nI was suddenly curious about what was going through the Author’s mind.",

      "content": "“…So?”\n“Yes?”\n“I’m curious why you’re following me like this.”\nI stopped walking and turned around.\nThe blonde heroine was following at a distance. Her name was probably…Amelia?\nHer slender figure stood out, elongated like that of a fencer.\nFor some reason, I felt a sense of defeat.\nIt seemed like she was even taller than I was when I was a guy.\n…No, it’s not that I was short.\nShe’s just tall!\n“Because I want to be friends.”\n“…Friends? You and me?”\n“Yes, yes. Is that not possible?”\nFriends, huh?\nIt hasn’t been long since I enrolled here.\nIf a classmate I haven’t even spoken to tries to become friends, what should I do?\n“Okay!”\n“Really?”\nWhat do I do?\nWhy am I even asking? I should accept!\n[Reader, you’re making friends…! And even a heroine candidate! Unbelievable.]\nThe Author’s astonished voice could be heard.\nBe even more amazed!\nThis is a monumental day for me to make a friend!\nHa, of course, I wasn’t a complete loner with no friends back where I used to live.\nBut I was worried about having no friends at this academy.\nThen, a heroine candidate directly asked me to be friends!\nI’m delighted.\n“Yes, of course. I don’t reject those who approach me.”\n“Then, can I…speak casually?”\n“Sure, I don’t mind.”\n“Oh, okay.”\nBeaming.\nGlowing.\nThose may be the only words to describe the look on my face right now.\n“Arte, have you considered any clubs you want to join?”\n“Clubs, you mean?”\n“Yeah. Since we’re, y’know, friends. I’m a bit curious.”\n…Hmm. Amelia seems a bit stiff.\nIs she tense? Why?\nCould it be…?\n“Amelia, you don’t need to be tense.”\n“Huh?!”\n“It’s only natural to be tense when first talking to a friend.”\nThat’s right, it’s always tense when you first talk to a friend.\nBut over time, it’ll dissipate as if it never happened.\nSo, I should help Amelia relax and loosen up.\nWhat was the tip I read before…?\nI think I saw online that taking deep breaths can help relieve tension.\n“Now, breathe in…”\n“Hah, haaah…”\n“And out.”\n“H, huuuuu~”\n…It looks more like she’s hyperventilating than relaxing!\nShe doesn’t seem less tense at all!\nI guess the internet really is garbage.\nI thought it sounded plausible, but it’s completely unhelpful.\n“I can’t help it. Since you seem too tense, let’s continue this conversation another time.”\nHas Amelia never made friends before?\nHer looks do have a bit of a refined lady vibe to them…\nI should ask the Author about it later.\n“W-what club will you join…”\n“Haha, you’re more stubborn than I thought.”\nJust as I was about to leave Amelia on a park bench, her words stopped me in my tracks.\nEven when she’s in that state, she’s asking about what club I want to join.\nIt really seems like Amelia wants to become friends with me!\nBut what should I say?\nI haven’t actually thought about joining any clubs.\nI have no choice but to tell the truth here.\n“It’ll depend on what club Yu Siwoo decides to join.”\n“What, what?! Wait, tell me more…”\n“Then be sure not to be late for class!”\nSince she was tense from being around me, she’ll probably feel better soon enough.\nAfter judging that enough distance had opened up between us, I asked the Author something I was curious about.\n“Author.”\n[Yes?]\n“Did Amelia not have any friends?”\n[I don’t know. Her backstory hasn’t been settled yet.]\n“…Huh?”\nWhat are they talking about?\nIf they don’t know, then who does…?\nBaffled by her nonsensical answer, as I was expressing my bewilderment, the Author seemed to realize something and asked me a question.\n[Ah, could it be that you thought I created all the characters myself?]\n“… Did you not?”\n[Not at all, actually?]\nI was starting to become confused.\nFrom the Author’s behavior until now, I assumed they had created all the characters herself.\n…But that’s not the case?\n[Hmm, how do I explain this? …Ah! Do you know Schrodinger’s…what was it again?]\n“Schrodinger’s cat, you mean?”\n[Yes, that.]\nThe example the Author brought up was a story almost everyone has heard at least once.\nSchrodinger’s cat.\nIn the thought experiment, a cat in a box is both alive and dead until someone opens it and observes its state.\nBut what does that have to do with this situation?\n[Hmm, I assume you know the basic premise, so I’ll skip that part…The most important part of that thought experiment is the observer.]\n“The observer…”\n[Without an observer, the cat’s state inside the box cannot be determined. It will remain in superposition indefinitely.]\n“And how is that related to you not knowing Amelia’s past?”\n[I’m not as all-knowing as you might think.  If I was perfect, I wouldn’t need to send you in–I could just write the novel from Yu Siwoo’s perspective, you see?]\n“…Ah.”\nThat’s right.\nThe Author’s novel progresses from Yu Siwoo’s perspective.\nBut the Author can’t even read his mind, let alone know what actions he’ll take, which is why they instructed me to stalk him.\nIf they were an omniscient god, they would know his thoughts without needing to do that.\n[Amelia’s past is currently unobserved.]\n“So her past is basically blank…”\n[Exactly. I’m just putting an empty box I can fill however I want.]\nRidiculous.\nI was so dumbfounded I was at a loss for words.\n[However, I can’t change what’s already been observed. That’s why I’m not all-powerful.]\n“Ah, that’s why you can’t change my abilities…”\n[Hehe, you got me… It’s because I already set them that way.]\nSo from the start, it wasn’t that they wouldn’t change them, but that they couldn’t?\nWas all that petulant refusal just because it was already determined?\nDamn.\n[Amelia’s past hasn’t been observed yet. That’s why I don’t know.]\n“…And once it’s set, it can never be changed?”\n[Right. I can change small details, but the major plot threads are…difficult.]\nI see, I understand the gist now.\nThe Author may not be a creator god, but they have abilities almost on that level of incredulity.\n[It’s easy to create something new but hard to erase what already exists. Understanding it that way might be easier.]\n“But then, who is the observer?”\n[Why, you are! I told you, it’s hard for me without viewing things from your perspective.]\n“But…I didn’t know that?”\n[Because I didn’t tell you, obviously.]\n‘You crazy Author, how can you assign such an important role without any explanation?!’\n…Is what I wanted to shout, but I forcefully held it in.\n[So, should we say Amelia was a social outcast?]\n“No, let’s say she had several friends but never any she was truly close with and wanted to make a real friend someday.”\n[Got it, understood~]\nAh, wait a minute.\nWithout realizing it, I ended up expressing my desire to become close friends with Amelia.\nSorry, Amelia…!\n[Okay, Reader. Since you seem to get the gist, let’s move on to clubs…What kind of club would be good?]\nThe Author’s question snapped me back to my senses.\nThat’s right, they just said it’s hard to change things once they’re set.\nAll I need to do is be a true friend to her.\nTo do that, I had to decide on a club first.\n“How about an exploration club or something?”\n[Exploration?]\n“Yes. Since the plot will progress towards finding a secret room, an exploration-type club would tie into that easily, don’t you think?”\n[Hmm, not a bad idea. An exploration club, then?]\n“It would probably be easy to get permission to go outside, too. Doesn’t that sound good?”\n[Okay!]\n…Come to think of it, a sudden question occurred to me.\nI sort of understand the Author’s abilities now.\nBut that’s exactly why I became curious.\n“Author.”\n[Yes?]\n“What happens if there’s a setting inconsistency?”\nThat’s right, a setting inconsistency.\nAs a human, setting inconsistencies are inevitable.\nSurely if an inconsistency happens, it doesn’t mean the world will be destroyed or anything…right?\n[Well, I don’t think anything good would happen. But don’t worry about it.]\n“Can you complete the novel without any setting inconsistencies?”\n[No? I just said it’s hard to go against established settings, but it’s not impossible.]\n“Ah.”\n[It would be quite difficult, but… I could force things if I had to.]\nI see.\nI imagined some catastrophic world-ending scenario for a moment, but thankfully, that’s not the case.\nWith that last question, I was hoping for a more reassuring answer that setting inconsistencies wouldn’t happen…\n[And that’s why you’re here.  If an inconsistency arises, you’ll need to resolve it for me, okay?]\n“…Yes, I understand.”\nThree things I realized from this conversation with the Author:\nFirst, my ability and me randomly turning into a girl. It’s already been set that way. Dammit.\nSecond, because of me, Amelia will have many shallow friendships but no truly close friends she can open up to.\nThird, I’ll have to clean up the Author’s shit.\nThe first and third points were a bit unsettling.\nTranslator’s Corner\nJust in case the third point was unclear, it means she’ll have to fix the problems made by the Author. However, it also referred to treating the author like a baby in a previous chapter, so I worded it like that.\nFor the fencer part, ideally, you want to be tall and fit—tall for longer arm reach and slender for a smaller profile. However, both of these are not huge factors, as technique is the most important, and there have been successful fencers of all ages, sizes, genders, some other varying factors, and whatnot.\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "TN: Thank Clone Trooper on kofi for this chapter. Part 1\n“I’ve found out the club Arte will be joining.”\nJust before lunchtime ended, Yu Siwoo heard a voice calling out to him.\nAmelia was hurriedly approaching.\n“…Which one?”\n“Arte is going to join whatever club you’re joining.”\n“What?”\n“I don’t know the reason. But she seems quite interested in you, just like you said.”\nYu Siwoo’s expression became gloomy.\nWhat on earth did he do wrong for this to happen?\nDid he sell out his country in a past life or something?\n“So I’ll ask…which club do you want to join?”\n“Let’s see. How about the fencing club, something ordinary?”\n“Fencing, huh? That’s not too…”\n…Strange.\nHe felt like the world was distorted for a moment.\nYu Siwoo sensed that something had changed.\nBut what exactly?\nHe thought something changed, but it could have just been his imagination.\nDespite definitely not being attacked, it felt like his intuition was ringing out.\nYu Siwoo decided to chalk it up to his mood.\nHas he been under a lot of stress lately?\n“No, instead of fencing, what about an exploration club?”\n“…Exploration?”\n“Yeah. Her goal is to find a secret room hidden in the academy…So an exploration club that can roam the academy would be perfect.”\n“That sounds good. Let’s go with that then.”\n“Okay. Then I’ll tell Arte.”\nThere’s no helping it.\nTo keep an eye on her, it’s best  if we’re in the same club.\n“We don’t need to find Arte… She’ll show up soon enough  if we wait.”\n“You sound confident.”\n“You experienced it yourself. It seems like she’s watching us somehow. At the very least, we can assume she has us under surveillance.”\n“Hmm…”\n“She was too tense when alone, but it’s fine now. She’s gotten used to it.”\nAmelia’s conjecture couldn’t be refuted.\nDespite being unseen, she had abruptly appeared while they were talking.\nJust as she said, when we waited a bit, sure enough–\nNot even ten minutes later, she showed up.\n“Oh, you two. What are you doing here?”\n“Ah, nothing much. We were just thinking about which club to join.”\n“Hmm…Where are you going to then?”\n“Same as you. We decided on the exploration club.”\nArte’s lips curved into a smile.\nShe seemed pleased.\n“That’s great. I was thinking of joining that one. It seems we will be in the same club!”\nArte had told Amelia she planned to join whatever club Yu Siwoo joined.\nSo that was a lie.\nAmelia thought Arte was just toying with her.\nBut there’s no other way.\nWithout evidence, the teachers will likely dismiss what we say as nonsense.\nBut can we really just leave her be?\nAn artifact that could overturn the world might get leaked.\nThat’s something they had to prevent.\nThey came to this academy aiming to become a hero who protects people, after all.\nThis exploration club that gives us an excuse to roam the academy is perfect.\nThey needed to find the secret room without Arte noticing.\n‘Having her monitor me is an unavoidable cost, I suppose.’\nAt least it’s fortunate that Amelia is around to share the situation with.\nHe might have lost his mind from the burden  if he were alone.\n“Shall we go submit our club entry requests then!”\n“Yeah, let’s go.”\n***\n“Three new members?!”\nThe presumed senior girl was considerably excited.\nWas having three new members really that delightful?\n“Senior, where are the other members?”\n“Well, that is…”\nShe hesitated, unable to answer my question.\nAlright, I get the picture.\n“Don’t worry too much. We’ll join the club even  if there’s no one else.”\n“Huh? How did you know?!”\n“Fufu, it’s a secret.”\n“Amazing! Amazing! Tell me!”\n[Maybe a bit too classic of a setup?]\nIt really is a classic.\nA club on the verge of being disbanded due to a lack of members.\nThe protagonist and friends join it.\nThanks to the protagonist’s exploits, the club’s status rapidly rises from its low to new heights.\nIt’s a cliche you see everywhere.\nBut I can’t exactly say, “Oh, I saw that in a novel~”\nI played it off with some mystique, and the club president’s reaction was great.\nShe seems delighted. Is this why people with good reactions are so popular?\n“Ah, ah, wait. …Um, sorry, but our club has a little tradition!”\n“A tradition?”\n“Yup. When new members join, the old members hide a piece of paper in the clubroom and have them find it… It’s all for fun. It’s fine  if you don’t want to.”\n“Sounds fun. I’ll do it. What about you two?”\nYu Siwoo and Amelia nodded, seeming interested.\nI guess this is the setup the Author included for additional content.\nSince it’s an exploration club, finding hidden objects is a relevant skill or something like that.\nThe protagonist instantly finds the hidden object, performs a “Gahaah!” motion, and gets praise.\nNaturally, they also get to showcase their skills as well.\nSo, I readily agreed.\nThe president looked really excited, so I figured skipping it would be rude, even  if it’s optional.\nIt’s a small price to progress the plot.\n[Heh, a treasure hunt! Sounds fun.]\nWait, what?\nWas it not that kind of setup?\n“Ah, could you all close your eyes for a bit? I need to hide the paper.”\n[…? Reader, why the expression?]\nI must have scrunched my face in disbelief, prompting the Author’s remark.\nI suppose they don’t have any deeper intent behind this.\nMy mistake was expecting too much from the Author.\n“…Done. Alright, now find it!”\nYu Siwoo and Amelia opened their eyes and began scanning the room.\nThe smugly grinning president seemed confident it wouldn’t be found easily.\n“Heh, this will be quite tricky to find!”\n“Hmm, I don’t see anything out of place…”\nAfter glancing around the clubroom, Yu Siwoo and Amelia sensed it would be harder than expected and started seriously searching.\nCome to think of it, why is this place so spacious?\n“The clubroom is pretty big?”\n“…There used to be more members.”\n[Hmm, a cliche setup. I like it.]\nInstead of planning some narrative twist, they’re just establishing settings.\nVexing.\n“…I can’t find it. What about you, Yu Siwoo?”\n“Sorry, no luck for me either.”\n[His intuition can only currently sense physical threats! Naturally, he can’t find it!]\nWhat are they doing?\nIsn’t this exactly when you’re supposed to highlight the protagonist?\n“Can’t find it, huh…”\nThe previously excited president hung her head dejectedly.\nShe seemed disappointed.\n…Ah jeez, this is hard to watch.\nI can’t just leave it be.\n“Hmm, it seems your training is lacking.”\n“…Huh?”\n“Here, here, and here. Quite easy, no?”\n“Wooow! Amazing! Amazing! How did you do that?!”\n“Fufu, it’s a secret.”\nI let out some thread from my fingerless gloves and instantly retrieved the papers the president had hidden.\nOne was under the mustache of a statue of unclear purpose.\nAnother was wedged between the tightly packed bookshelves.\nFinally, one under the president’s  shoe.\nThree in total.\nLet’s see what’s written on them.\n“…’Welcome to club?'”\n“Hehe, it’s a nice activity, right?”\nI see.\nI wondered what kind of setup the exploration club would have, and this is it…\n[So that’s the setup…]\n“I didn’t expect there to be something like this.”\n[Things I don’t explicitly set tend to form their own reasonable setups. If left alone, they solidify like that. Well, I suppose this is fine, too.]\n“So, was it fun?”\n“Yes, it was fun.”\nLeaving the overly excited and joyful president behind, I approached Yu Siwoo and Amelia.\n“…? You two, why the gloomy expressions?”\n“How did you find them so quickly?”\n“Pardon?”\n“Those tiny slips of paper, how did you spot them so instantly…?”\n“Ah, is that what you’re asking about?”\nHmm, it wasn’t that difficult of a trick, really.\nExtremely simple and easy, but a trick only I can do.\n“It’s a secret. Fufu.”\nI didn’t feel like telling them, though.\nWell, of course not.\nSince my eyes look closed from the illusion threads, I can’t exactly say I saw the president hiding them, can I?\nWith her celebrating over there, how could I tell the truth?\nWould she burst into tears?\n***\n“To find those so easily…”\n“I guess I’ll have to call off the hidden  camera operation…”\n“What?!”\nYu Siwoo was startled.\n“Why are you so surprised? We have no choice  if we want evidence.”\n“B-But that’s a crime…”\n“What, it’s fine. As long as we don’t get caught? And we can’t be picky about methods when there’s danger.”\n“…”\n“Don’t worry. I said we’re calling it off, didn’t I? She’d spot it immediately  if she’s that good at finding things.”\nShe’s not wrong.\nIf Amelia is right that Arte has dangerous intentions, they must stop her by any means necessary.\nIt seems she really isn’t going to hold back on methods.\n“How else can we get evidence? …Kidnapping? No, she probably has ‘close friends’ around. Wiretapping? Hmm…”\nYu Siwoo could feel beads of cold sweat rolling down his cheek.\n‘I thought Arte was the only dangerous person.’\nHe was surrounded on both sides.",

      "content": "TN: Thank Clone Trooper for the chapter. Part 2\n[We need something new.]\n“Huh?”\nOut of nowhere?\nI unintentionally raised my voice loudly while listening to a boring mana studies lecture.\n“What is it, Arte? Is there something you don’t understand?”\n“…No, sorry. I was just thinking about something else for a moment.”\n“Pay attention to the lecture. Now, mana circulating within the body results in less loss…”\nWith Ms. Claire’s voice as background noise, I listened closely to the Author’s words.\n[You see, Reader, there’s been nothing happening lately, right?]\n“…I suppose not.”\nI lowered my volume so others couldn’t hear.\nDoing this makes me feel like a magical girl or something.\nIt reminded me of the magical girl anime I secretly watched as a kid, with scenes of talking with a mascot character during class.\n[Every day, it’s just lectures, lectures, and lectures. Just training and studying theory all day doesn’t provide enough material!]\n“What about the swordsmanship classes?”\n[That’s the biggest problem! Just dueling all day long. Boring!]\nDidn’t you say there might even be a heroine candidate there before?\nWhen I brought that up, the Author got quite upset.\n[The first encounter is important for heroines! Meeting in such a boring way at a boring place doesn’t make her a heroine! Scrap it!]\n“Ah, I see.”\nSo that’s how it is.\nThen what was even the point of me joining the swordsmanship classes?\nBesides, one notably pretty girl was there, fitting for a heroine…Wasn’t she a candidate? Did you just forget about her? Really?\n[Anyway…! It’s an experiment, an experiment! I want to insert a new episode!]\n“Oh, okay. What did you want to insert…?”\n[Obviously, an attack on the academy!]\n“…?”\nDid I hear that right?\nAn attack?\n[It might be a bit early, but… I’m going to insert an evil organization raid event!]\n“That’s way too early.”\n[Huh?!]\nIt’s not just a bit early. It’s too soon.\nAre you kidding me?\n“At the very least, write two or so more events before doing a raid on the school. It’s way too premature.”\n[Tw-two whole events?! B-but I don’t have any material right now…]\nAs I thought.\nI knew it was something like this.\nThey’ve run out of material, so they’re trying to fill the void, right? I understand.\nBut does that mean you have to use up the juicy academy attack premise already?\nAt least let it simmer more.\n[But I really can’t think of any other material right now.]\n“Why not? You can just make some up.”\n[R-Reader?]\nThump thump.\nI could almost hear that sound.\nEven without seeing it, I could tell she was filled with anticipation.\nShe always ends up relying on me.\nIt didn’t feel bad.\nBeing depended on by others feels better than I expected.\n“Before the raid, what do you think needs to happen?”\n[Huh? …Um, I don’t know?]\n“Preliminary investigations. They need to assess the opposition.”\nIt’s easy if I think about what counter-terrorism units do before operations.\nIn movies and such, the counter-terrorism squads always obtain building blueprints and such to study the information thoroughly, right?\n“We need a spy.”\n[Ah…! Th-that’s right! A minion planted by the evil organization! As expected from you, Reader…!]\nThe academy has extremely tight security.\nNot only would hacking the databases be impossible at an ordinary level, but even suspicious access attempts would be traced back instantly, turning you into a criminal before you knew it.\nIt’s an academy that can’t be breached.\nWhile having a spy inside could be seen as a plot hole, it’s quite the opposite.\nThe evil organizations in academy novels tend to be world-threatening types.\nFor ones like that, infiltrating wouldn’t be too strange.\nThe saying goes that even the highest security in the world has a way in, after all.\n[But who should we have as the spy? Too ordinary might be a bit…]\n“Wasn’t there a good candidate among the students?”\n[…?]\nYes, there was one.\nSomeone the Author had no interest in but who had some connection to Yu Siwoo.\nPlus, she had an extraordinary appearance and was worthy of being an ex-heroine candidate.\n“If you can’t use her as a heroine, you should at least use her as a villain.”\nIt’s best to use up all your resources.\nI couldn’t help but smile, feeling my earlier actions in swordsmanship class weren’t meaningless after all.\nWell, villains need to be pretty these days.\nHaving one pretty spy shouldn’t be too bad, right?\n***\n“Something feels off.”\n“Yeah, I sensed it too.”\nYu Siwoo and Amelia were secretly watching Arte behind Ms. Claire’s back.\n“There’s no way Arte would randomly fall asleep and raise her voice like that. …Something’s up.”\n“She hasn’t taken any action these past few days, so maybe she’s about to move now that we let our guard down.”\nYu Siwoo agreed with Amelia’s words.\nA few days after joining the club, they were on high alert.\nJust when the tension was dissipating as nothing happened, making them think they may have misjudged the situation–\nArte started acting strangely.\n“She seems to have been contacted. It must be that ‘Author’ person, don’t you think Yu Siwoo?”\n“That person is definitely behind this.”\n“No doubt.”\nAuthor.\nA word meaning someone who creates their own works in the artistic field.\nThe word itself isn’t problematic.\nBut the way Arte referred to ‘Author’ seemed to mean something else.\nNot creating artistic works but crafting something in reality itself.\n“Disgusting. Causing incidents and treating it as art. …She’s deranged.”\nHe forcibly held back the grimace that threatened to show on his face at Amelia’s words.\n‘You’re just as strange,’ he wanted to retort.\nConsidering criminal acts to obtain evidence of a crime is just as strange.\n“…Wait, what is she muttering over there?”\n“Can’t hear.”\n“Too far away.”\nYu Siwoo was normally relieved he was seated far from her.\nFor the first time, he felt dismayed at the distance between them.\n“…Swordsmanship classes.”\nHuh?\nYu Siwoo was flustered by the words Amelia suddenly brought up.\nWhat did she just say?\nShe intently stared at Arte’s face, so he figured something was up.\n…Lip reading?\n“Sorry. I didn’t properly learn it, so I can’t read it well.”\n“You can lip read?”\n“Just a bit.”\n“Why, why would you…”\n“…It looked cool in movies.”\nAmelia’s face reddened in embarrassment.\nShe seemed embarrassed that she learned lip reading because it looked cool in movies.\nMore than that, he found it unbelievable she learned it just because it looked cool.\nBut now wasn’t the time to worry about that.\nWhy she learned it wasn’t important.\nThis was a chance to eavesdrop on Arte and that ‘Author’s’ secret conversation.\n“She’s started talking more!”\n“Wait. Early, raid, event…? Two events? Did I see that right?”\n“…Amelia, that might not be what we need to focus on right now.”\n“I know. She mentioned a raid. But it doesn’t seem like an immediate attempt, so we’re still okay. I’m not even sure if I’m reading this right.”\nEarly, raid on the school.\nWhat is that about? And what’s this event she’s talking about?\nIt was completely incomprehensible.\nI wish Amelia had just misread it.\n“Why not, make… Ugh… I can’t make out what she’s saying.”\nHer scrunched-up expression while staring at Arte might look like an angry glare to anyone else.\n‘Since I can do nothing right now, I should at least cover her face so our classmates can take notes in peace…?’\n“Academy, raid, preliminary investigation, assess…”\n“What are you…”!\n“Spy, student, heroine, villain…That’s it.”\nThe words coming out of Amelia’s mouth were shocking enough to make me freeze.\n“I hope I just misunderstood. It’s a bit shocking.”\n“Attacking the academy, it’s unprecedented. How could that be possible…?”\n“I know. It’s never happened since the academy was founded. But she’s not ordinary, as you know.”\nI didn’t want to believe it.\nAttacking the academy.\nCould she really be planning to attack the academy?\n“It would be fortunate if I misread and jumped to conclusions, but what if I read it correctly?”\n“…”\n“The teachers won’t believe such a ridiculous story…we must stop it beforehand.”\nAmelia was right.\nIf nothing happens, that’s good.\nBut if she read it correctly?\nIf she really intends to attack the academy?\nIt won’t end with just saying I didn’t know.\nA bloody incident is sure to occur.\n“You’re right. Even if we jumped to conclusions, it’s better to stop it beforehand.”\n“Okay. Let’s go over what she said again.”\nPutting the lesson aside completely, Amelia looked at the paper where she had written down the words by reading her lips.\nSwordsmanship lesson, early, raid, two events, why not, make, academy, raid, preliminary investigation, assess, spy, student, heroine, villain.\n“…It’s confusing.”\n“Yeah. I really wish I had misunderstood.”\nYu Siwoo stared intently at the paper, practically burying his face in it.\nAnd realized one thing.\n“Fortunately, the attack won’t happen right away.”\n“Really?”\n“Look at the part after the second ‘raid’ here.”\nPreliminary investigation, assess.\nThe meaning of these words was simple.\n“The first ‘raid’ word came up with the word ‘early.’ She probably thinks attacking is premature.”\n“I see. Then those words ‘preliminary investigation’ and ‘assess’…”\n“It means finding the right time to launch the attack, doesn’t it?”\nThe meanings of the other words were hard to figure out with so few clues.\nBut just one phrase.\n“Swordsmanship classes. The very first word. There must be a clue there.”\n“…But I can’t attend because I’m in the spear class.”\n“Leave it to me. I’ll try to find out somehow.”\n“Be careful, Siwoo.”\nBefore they knew it, the bell rang, signaling the end of class.\nThe weapons class Yu Siwoo was supposed to attend was starting next.\nHe had to watch what actions she would take.\nNo matter how scared he was of her, he was the only one who could do something.\nTranslator’s Corner\nThank Clone Trooper for the chapter again. I’ll keep translating a minimum of one chapter per day; then I’ll just post whenever I have free time another chapter. There’s still a bunch to go, so I’ll try to keep up the pace.\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "“Pick up your swords. Today’s lesson begins.”\n[Ugh, boring teacher. This sucks.]\nWhy are you being rude to the teacher…?\nWell, it’s not wrong to say the lesson is boring.\nThere are teachers like this.\nAs a writer pursuing entertainment, the Author didn’t seem to like this teacher.\nIf they were willing to abandon a heroine because the way she met the protagonist was boring, there is nothing I can do.\n“Alright, alright. Enough about the teacher. Let’s move on to the student. That girl over there?”\nI looked at the former heroine candidate.\nShe’s a female student with an impressive purple ponytail.\nThe weapon she’s holding is…a baton?\nBefitting a student who came for sword training, she had an attractively well-trained physique.\nAs a former heroine candidate, she had something that drew attention compared to the other students.\n[Hmm, but there’s one thing that bothers me…]\n“What might that be?”\n[I can’t imagine how she could have infiltrated the academy.]\nOho.\nOur Author is starting to care about plausibility.\nThere’s no need to care about plausibility; they could just handwave it by saying someone hacked their way in.\nBut I’m glad the Author is starting to care about these little things.\nMaybe one day, they’ll figure out solutions on their own without me having to advise them.\nHappy with this prospect, I decided to offer some advice.\n“Then should we add a bit of plausibility? It’s not that difficult.”\n[Huh? How? Where can one find a way to penetrate the academy’s security?]\n“She wasn’t a villain when she enrolled, she became one after enrolling.”\n[…!]\n“You can explain how a spy slipped in that way.”\nRight, there’s no rule that a spy has to be a spy from the moment of infiltration.\nWhat if it wasn’t an infiltration at all?\nShe could have been an ordinary student when she enrolled, but she turned villain after enrolling.\nSilently training day after day, believing her talent would bloom someday.\nPracticing to the point of bleeding without a single day off.\nBut her skills refused to improve no matter how hard she tried.\nYet she insisted her approach wasn’t wrong, stubbornly pursuing mediocrity.\nUntil one day, she finally snapped.\nThe reason? Well, how about this:\nThe incoming class is the protagonist generation.\nThe protagonist’s generation is brimming with talented students in any academy novel.\nTo keep up with the protagonist’s growth, and not fall behind.\nThe generation the protagonist enrolls in is always a golden one, shining brightly with talent.\nBut where there is light, there is also darkness.\nAnd naturally, some envy them.\n“She witnesses the amazing talents of her fellow enrollees and feels envious. By chance, she’s contacted by an evil organization asking, ‘Do you desire power…?’ And just like that, she defects. How’s that?”\n[Wow, amazing! Incredible!]\n“The academy’s security is certainly excellent, but gaps will always appear if an insider betrays them. Cliché but fun, right?”\n[I knew I wasn’t mistaken! You’re a god among readers!]\nI’m not the god; you are.\n…Well, being praised like this didn’t feel bad.\n[Okay, the setup is done! A student jealous of others’ talent who eventually defects to villainy out of envy! Delicious!]\nLooking at the student after the Author’s words, I could sense something had changed about her.\nThe way she swung her sword, reminiscent of the other students, now seemed rushed and tainted by malice.\nEven I, who knows nothing about swords, could sense that much–of course, the teacher noticed, too.\nThe teacher, who had been watching the other students while eyeing her, stopped her.\n“Lyla. That’s enough. Didn’t I tell you before not to be so hasty?”\n“Huff, huff… But! I can do more!”\n“No, you cannot. Your body isn’t that strong yet. You need rest.”\nWow, what a disconnect.\nThe girl swinging her weapon normally just moments ago is suddenly struggling like this.\nIt’s not my first time seeing settings change, but I couldn’t shake off the jarring feeling.\n…They really don’t feel human, do they?\nSights like this make it hard for me to perceive the denizens of this world as people.\n“That’s an order, Lyla. Take a rest.”\n“Ugh…”\nHer defiant spirit wavered at the teacher’s words, reluctantly accepting.\n“Don’t be hasty. You’re making plenty of progress. Don’t worry.”\n“…Yes.”\nWatching the teacher’s back as he turned to leave, Lyla’s face was as cold as if she were a different person from before the setting changed.\nWell, technically, she is a different person now.\nHer past has changed, after all.\n“Um, are you alright?”\n“…Go away. I’m fine.”\nQuite the cold response.\nBut I can’t back down either.\nI have to confirm if the setting change went well.\nIt would be a disaster if the Author messed up and accidentally gave her some weird setting.\n“By the way, you’re incredible. That perseverance. I’m jealous.”\n“…What do you want?”\n“I’m jealous of your amazing talent. They say perseverance is a talent, too. Do you think we could become friends?”\n“…!”\nYikes, scary.\nIf I hadn’t expected that reaction, I would have been startled.\nWho knew a pretty face could contort like that?\nWell, it makes sense.\nOne of the things those without talent hate most is being told perseverance itself is a talent.\nPerseverance is a talent?\nHonestly, if they could, the untalented would gladly kill whoever first uttered those words.\nWhether one perseveres or not ultimately comes down to willpower–totally separate from talent.\nShe clearly thinks the same.\n…Let me probe a little further?\nPretending not to notice her expression, I decided to prod her further.\n“I personally struggle with perseverance… I always find it hard to stick with anything for long.  If you could share some tips, I’d really appreciate it.”\n“…Get lost.”\n“Pardon?”\n“I said get lost!”\nHer booming voice drew the gazes of the other students.\nNaturally, the teacher hurried over.\n“Is there a problem here, Arte?”\n“No, teacher. I must have misspoken somehow. It’s nothing.”\n“…Very well. I’ll be watching, so don’t fight.”\n“Yes. Don’t worry.”\nThe teacher’s suspicious gaze stung a little.\nWell, they don’t even know what happened.\nLyla was the one who yelled, so why am I being doubted?\nFortunately, Lyla seemed too flustered to act out further.\nShe probably didn’t expect to shout like that herself.\n“Well then, Lyla. I’ll see you next time. Hopefully, whatever is troubling you will be resolved by then. Haha.”\nThe Author’s setting seems to have been applied properly, and that dilemma will likely be resolved.\nThe evil organization will grant her strength, befitting a villain.\nI’m not sure about the side effects, though.\nI don’t think the “strength” evil organizations provide is a proper enhancement method.\nIt’s the same everywhere, isn’t it?\nThere’s no such thing as a free lunch in this world.\nTo gain something, you have to sacrifice something else.\nEven if you don’t work hard for something, you still have to spend the time to obtain it.\nAnd if there are prices for freebies, the shortcut to power from an evil group is bound to have side effects.\nWhether there will be new troubles then…\nWell, we’ll think about that when we get there.\n“Oh, that reminds me, Author. The evil organization…do they need a name? Did you have one in mind?”\n[Yes! You know how these super-powered beings are basically superhumans? So the name I thought of was…]\nHearing the name the Author came up with, I couldn’t help but chuckle.\n“Okay, sure. Let’s go with that.”\nAuthor, you’re better at naming than I thought.\n***\n“…Found it.”\nYu Siwoo was certain.\nThat girl.\nThe female student Arte approached directly.\nShe must be involved in some scheme with Arte.\nUp until now, Arte had never directly approached a student herself.\nBut at this timing, she went out of her way to approach a student she had never met before.\nSomething about the situation felt off to Yu Siwoo.\n“I should discuss this with Amelia.”\nYu Siwoo imagined a happy scenario in his mind–foiling Arte’s plans and enjoying a normal academy life.\n‘Maybe it’s possible,’ he thought with a bright smile.\n***\n“Haah…”\nLyla let out a sigh as she walked home from the academy.\nWas that too much?\n…No, it wasn’t too much.\nIt’s better this way. That woman was mocking her.\nLyla saw firsthand how she was awarded at the entrance ceremony for resolving that monster attack.\nBut what?\nShe says she lacks perseverance?\n…She finds it hard to stick with things for so long?\nThen what about her?\nShe gripped her sword every day, bleeding and covered in blisters, never slacking off.\n‘Could I even defeat a 3rd-rank demon on my own?’\nLyla wasn’t confident she could.\nFor someone capable of defeating such a powerful monster on her own, with her own mouth to say how she lacked perseverance–just how overflowing with talent is she?\nAm I really that devoid of talent?\nI wanted to become a hero who saved people.\nI wanted to be helpful to someone.\n“Aaaargh!”\nClenching her fist tight in anguish, blood trickled down Lyla’s hand.\n“Right, what is there to worry about? They’re offering me power, aren’t they.”\nShe took out the ominous black pill from her pocket that she had nearly thrown away, finding it too suspicious to consume.\nIts inky blackness instantly sparked fury within her, reminiscent of that woman’s dark hair.\nSwallowing the pill with all her pent-up frustration, an excruciating sensation gripped her heart immediately after.\n“Ugh, ugh…?!”\nHelp me.\nI don’t want to die.\nI just wanted to become someone who helps others.\nAs she flailed her hands in agony, she heard approaching footsteps.\n“He…lp…”\n“So you took it. Looks like you’ve decided to join us.”\nAh.\nThat voice, she remembers it.\nThe one who gave her the pill.\nThe one who approached her, offering power.\n“Über…mensch…”\n“That’s right, we are the ones above men, Übermensch.”\nLyla sensed the man in the white coat giving a sinister smile.\n“Remember that well, for it is the group you shall belong to from now on.”\nTranslator’s Corner\nSince I was curious about it, I did some research and put a decent summary below. At least read the TL;DR because I put effort into that.\nTL;DR: Übermensch is a human becoming god through self-discovery and improvement. They call this person ‘overman’ or ‘superman,’ hence the title.\nÜbermensch is Nietzche’s idea of what man could be if not hindered by outdated religion and morality. In English, it translates to ‘Overman.’\nOne of his most-known quotes is, “God is dead,” which shows how many people of his time viewed religion, with atheism becoming not only acceptable but widespread. He believes once Christianity ‘collapses,’ humanity will fall into nihilism and the deconstruction of now foundationless beliefs and values since there is no place to base them on.\nThis is where Übermensch comes in. He believes this is the goal men should strive towards. His main problem with religion and morality is the suppression of inner desires to pursue a ‘virtuous’ life. He believes we should discard the notion of ‘sin’ and rebuild healthier and life-affirming values. Acknowledge one’s strengths and weaknesses and build upon them. Not the denial of the urges and forces that make up our lives but the sublimation, sculpting, and channeling of them into a psychologically healthy and beautiful creation.\nOf course, this is just my interpretation. Who knew writing all those essays would do something?  If there is something wrong with what I wrote, let me know, as this isn’t my field of expertise.\nHere is the source I used:\nÜbermensch Explained: the Meaning of Nietzsche’s ‘Superman’ | Philosophy Break. /articles/ubermensch-explained-the-meaning-of-nietzsches-superman/\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "TN: Thank Clone Trooper for yet another chapter. Part 3\nSometime after the man’s appearance.\nThe pain that had been tormenting Lyla’s body disappeared as  if it had never happened.\n“…My body doesn’t hurt anymore.”\n“It’s good for the body to be in pain, just like vaccines that initially cause pain to prevent illness but ultimately make the body stronger.”\n“Like a vaccine…”\nShe clenched his fist.\nKwaaak.\nIt felt completely different from her sword swings earlier today.\nAn immense force came with the sensation of the bandages on her hand snapping.\n“…This is power.”\n“Yes. Our power.”\nLyla looked up at the man’s figure.\nWearing a mask and a long coat that concealed his build, his appearance was impossible to make out.\n“Even after becoming a member of your organization, you won’t show your face to me?”\n“Once the true power of that elixir is revealed, you too will join us. But not yet.”\n“True power?”\n“Yes. It takes time to accept our power.”\nTime is needed, huh?\nShe looked at the snapped bandages.\nIs this still incomplete?\n“Until that power fully manifests, you will remain as a self-proclaimed guardian of humanity, a student of the academy.”\n“…I’ll do that.”\n“Good.”\nWith those words, the man of unknown identity left.\n‘True power, huh?’\nSo the power that never grew, no matter how much she trained, could be gained this easily?\nLyla gazed at the spot where the man had left for a long time with complicated feelings.\n***\n“You’ve grown stronger, Lyla. What on earth happened in just one day…!”\nThe teacher marveled as he watched Lyla’s training.\nThe force behind her sword swings felt remarkably intense compared to yesterday.\n“Hup…!”\nWith a brisk sound of slicing wind, the practice dummies were instantly shredded.\nWow, she’s gotten insanely strong.\n[Don’t worry, I didn’t make any mistakes!]\n“When you say that, it makes me more worried.”\nThankfully, it didn’t seem like the Author had made any mistakes.\nThose people must have enhanced Lyla well.\n“By the way, Author, what are your plans for the villain in the novel?”\n[Hm?…To get defeated by the protagonist?]\n“I see…”\nSo they’re destined to die in the end?\nIt didn’t feel great.\nWhat was this feeling?\nA memory from childhood of playing simulation games resurfaced.\nThere were times when sacrificing certain units felt unavoidable, and a tinge of guilt would creep in.\nIt was a similar feeling.\nBut there’s no choice.\nFor the story to progress as the Author intends, sacrifices must be made.\nIncidents and accidents never cease at the academy.\nA raid on the academy is bound to happen eventually, and the villains will try to upend the world.\nAnd with the existence of monsters, they could launch an invasion at any moment.\nSubjecting the protagonist to trials, and having them overcome those trials triumphantly–that’s a key source of enjoyment in academy novels.\nNo, it’s like that for most web novels, too.\nVillains are needed to create those trials for the protagonist to face. I just happened to designate them.\nIf I didn’t, another character would become the villain instead.\nAnd these are just fictional characters from the novel, anyway.\nI simply observed their backstory before being designated as villains without a real connection to them. I only saw them swinging their swords.\nIt’s not a problem  if I don’t designate the villains, either.\nIn the end, the Author has to establish villains no matter what.\nIt’s certain. It’s necessary for the story’s progression.\nEven  if I didn’t choose someone, there would still be a villain. And if I can’t anticipate the consequences, the damage could escalate.\nWhat if I refused to help the Author at all and obstructed the story’s progression?\nWhat if that led to the novel’s serialization being halted?\nWould the world be destroyed?\nOr would everything just come to a standstill?\nI’m not sure.\nUltimately, the best approach is to assist the Author and confirm the villains’ actions while I still can.\nThey’re not even human, just fictional characters, after all.\nI don’t know.\nI probably shouldn’t think about it too much. Like always, I’ll smile brightly and help the Author to bring this world to its conclusion.\nThere’s no need for me to ponder these things. The Author will determine everything.\nI’m just here to offer advice.\nThinking about it will only give me a headache.\nIn the end, they’re just letters, not people.\nTheir fate is decided by the Author’s whim, mere puppets.\n“Okay, let’s stop the training for today and start some sparring matches. Lyla, is there anyone you’d like to face?”\n“That one.”\n“Arte?…Are you still hung up about yesterday, Lyla?”\n“No. I just felt like she would best test my strength.”\n“I see, Arte. What will you do? You can refuse  if you’d like.”\nThe teacher’s voice snapped me out of my reverie.\nIt seems Lyla has requested to spar with me.\nHmm…\nPart of me doesn’t want to, but looking at her eager eyes, I can’t even imagine what might happen  if I refuse.\nI have no choice.\n“Okay. …What are the rules?”\n“An all-out match without using abilities.”\n“Got it. The match will start soon, so you two get ready.”\nHey, wait a minute.\nI suck without using my abilities!\n[Ah, it looks like Reader will lose. Fighting!]\nAuthor?!\n***\n“…She’s gotten unusually strong?”\n“Yes. She is clearly much stronger than before. Even  if it was just a sparring match, she defeated Arte so easily.”\nYu Siwoo recalled the day’s sparring match.\nThat female student who fought against Arte.\nHer name was…Lyla, right?\n“It’s a girl in my swordsmanship class.”\n“Ah, is her name Lyla by any chance?”\n“How did you know?”\n“She’s quite famous as an underachiever. It is rather suspicious  if that girl who couldn’t improve no matter how much she trained managed to defeat Arte.”\n“…Huh? Underachiever?”\n“You didn’t know? No matter how much she trains every day, her skills never improve. That’s why they call her the underachiever.”\nStrange.\nYu Siwoo felt a sense of dissonance. Similar to before.\nEven without being attacked, his instincts were ringing out too strongly to be a mere delusion.\nHer, an underachiever?\nThat couldn’t be right.\nShe was definitely around the same level as the other students.\n…Underachiever?\nCome to think of it, she did seem to struggle quite a bit yesterday.\nSo it wasn’t just her condition being off?\n“But she seemed perfectly ordinary…”\n“What are you talking about? Ordinary, my ass. I’ve never interacted with her, and the rumors call her an underachiever. You really don’t pay attention to your surroundings.”\n“…I guess not?”\n“Yeah. At least listen to the rumors circulating. So you know when something happens.”\nYu Siwoo decided not to dwell on it further.\nIt had been confirmed that his instincts only detect physical threats.\nThe teacher who evaluated me did say there was potential for growth, but the criteria were extremely stringent.\nUnless his life were in mortal peril, substantial growth would be difficult.\nYet he’d never experienced anything like that before.\nEven when he defeated the Grade 3 monster, his instincts weren’t warning him this sharply.\n‘I must have been mistaken.’\n“Her swordsmanship seemed to have deteriorated compared to before…But her physical abilities appeared to have skyrocketed.”\n“So she sacrificed technique for increased base stats. A potion, perhaps?”\n“Potion?”\n“Yeah. There’s a potion like that called the Wildfire Potion that drastically boosts your stats at the cost of temporarily lowering your intelligence, so you can’t utilize techniques well.”\nThe Wildfire Potion, huh.\nHe’s heard of it.\nBut it doesn’t seem to fit Lyla’s current situation.\n“I’ve heard of that too, but she wasn’t raging out of control like someone under the Wildfire’s effects. That’s why it got that name, for making you go berserk.”\n“Then is there really nothing…”\n“No, there is one. We’ve learned that something unknown to us can make a person tremendously powerful. Knowing what we don’t know is also important.”\nRecognizing what they don’t know is important too.\n“Knowing what you don’t know is important…”\n“It is. Humans have always harbored a fear of the unknown. A fear of the unfamiliar.”\n“…You seem to know it well.”\nHe has bone-chilling experience with the fear of the unknown.\nThe woman whose thoughts I could never fathom no matter how much I contemplated.\nThe woman whose heart remained opaque, unreadable to all.\nThat was the terror he felt towards Arte Iris.\n“Is that so? Seems there’s something you’re afraid of. Have you resolved that?”\n“No, not yet.”\n“I see… I may not know for sure, but they say the reason people fear death is also due to the fear of the unknown.”\n“…Really?”\n“Yes. What will become of us after death? Does heaven truly exist? Will we be reincarnated? If heaven does exist, will I go to heaven or hell? Have you ever thought about it?”\nYu Siwoo had never given it any thought before.\n…What happens after death?\nHe wasn’t sure.\n“In the end, none of us know what happens after we die. The afterlife is just something conceived by humans. It’s not like there are people who have actually died and been resurrected, right?”\n“…So we fear death because of that?”\n“Exactly. If people knew what awaited them after death, they wouldn’t fear it so much. Isn’t that interesting?”\nAmelia’s beaming smile was slightly unexpected.\nIt felt like he had glimpsed a side of her that others shouldn’t see.\nUnlike her usual unladylike demeanor that he had perceived as aggressive,\nIt was like seeing a new facet of her.\n“I don’t know what it is you’re afraid of. But wouldn’t it be good to try and find out?”\n“Find out…”\n“Yeah. What you thought of as a tiger skin rug might actually be a pot lid*! …Something like that could happen, right?”\nAmelia was right.\nThe side of her she showed him was indeed frightening.\nBut someone trying to stop Arte shouldn’t be afraid.\nJust as Yu Siwoo learned a new side of Amelia,\nHe may be able to discover a new side of Arte as well.\n“…Thanks, Amelia. That helped.”\n“I’m glad. Now, let’s think about what to do going forward.”\n“Yeah.”\nSomehow, he was starting to feel courageous.\nTranslator’s Corner\n*Means that something scary from afar could be way different  if observed closely.\nShould I keep using asterisks to mark notes like this? Also you better have read my essay in the last chapter.\n-Ruminas",

You said you set it up to take some time on purpose, right? Now seems like the best time.”\nAll for plausibility, or so she claimed.\n[Oh, but…]\n“But?”\n[I don’t know how to write it…]\nHaa.\nA sigh escaped.\n“Author…”\n[Why, why…! I don’t have much experience writing!]\n“Neither do I?”\n[Hmph.]\nThey’re sulking again.\nThere’s no point in fighting with the Author, so I have no choice but to teach her.\nI’ve only written self-introductions, so I don’t know if it’s right for me to help in this amateurish way.\nI have no other choice, so whatever.\n“Well, what’s the date…”\n[It’s late April!]\n“…Perfect timing then. We can start soon.”\n[Huh? …What?]\nWhat else could it be?\nOf course, it’s an event students can’t miss.\n“Let’s get ready for the exams.”\n[Huh? An exam?!]\nWhy are you so surprised?\nNormally, exams are held around late April to early May, right?\n“There are usually four exams a year, right? So there should be some around this time.”\n[Four times a year…]\n“Don’t worry. Since it’s a practical academy, there are many subjects to choose from.”\nWhat should we do this time?\nA tournament? No, that’s too grand for the first one.\nLet’s save the good stuff.\nIt would be better to do that right before summer vacation.\nOn-site training? No, that content belongs in the middle.\n…There’s only one option after all.\n“Dungeons. That should fit here the best.”\n[Dungeons…! Really?!]\nThe Author is excited.\nDid they really want to see a dungeon that badly?\nWhen I asked them, they responded enthusiastically.\n[Of course! Dungeon practice is a regular in academy novels, and it’s the fun part where the protagonist shines!]\nThey really seem to like it a lot.\nBut I had a slight doubt.\nIt’s a thought that just occurred to me, you see.\nDoesn’t this setting seem a bit odd?\n“Author, are there dungeons?”\n[Are there dungeons?]\nThe Author’s voice was full of doubt.\nSince she didn’t understand what I was saying, I decided to explain further.\n“No, come to think of it, dungeons…They’re only in hunter-type novels, right? With the gates opening and all that.”\n[Ah…?]\n“But here we have monsters, heroes, and villains, right? It’s a bit different from hunters, so dungeons are a bit… Let me think of something else.”\nThere’s no helping it.\nDungeons are a tasty setting, but we can’t use them if they don’t fit the world.\nIt’s a really tasty setting, but I have to discard it…\n[No!]\n“…Huh?”\n[I don’t want to! I want to see a dungeon! I’m definitely going to write it!]\n“But the setting doesn’t even fit the world…”\n[You can just fit the world around it!]\nFit the world around it?\nRight now?\n…How?\n[Hmm…I have an idea–no…That’s right! Hundreds of years ago, a gate opened, and the Hunter Era began!]\n“…Huh?”\n[So, this is already a hunter world, but the gate incident ended long ago! And it’s set in the world long after that!]\n“What’s that supposed to…”\n[The gate opened, mana was created, and those with special abilities manifested their mana quickly. Humans evolved to match mana, so they each gain one ability when they awaken. And…]\nThe Author suddenly started pulling out all sorts of settings one after another.\nA gate incident 500 years ago, the originally non-existent special abilities, the dungeons left untouched until now.\n[Dungeons are where you find byproducts that weren’t destroyed. Like mining minerals from mines, you extract byproducts from monsters in dungeons! …Ah, I’ll decide where they live, too! The former human territories lost in the gate incident 500 years ago became monster territory! The reason they’re fighting humans is, of course, to reclaim their territory!]\nThey’re talking without even taking a breath.\nJust how badly did they want to see it?\nThere don’t seem to be any settings that contradict it, which only annoys me.\nThe Author can do it well, huh?\nI guess they got serious because something they wanted came up.\nThey should work hard like this all the time.\n“Haa, I can’t help it. Alright.”\n[…! You mean!]\n“Let’s do the dungeon practice.”\n[Yay!]\nIf I said it didn’t make sense here, it would dampen their enthusiasm, right?\nI can’t have that.\nIf they want it this badly, I’ll do it for them.\n.\nWhat can I do?\n…I kind of feel like a parent who ends up doing what their child asks for.\n***\n“The exam is dungeon practice…”\nLyla scratched her head as she looked at the notice posted on the bulletin board.\n‘Dungeon practice, huh?’\nIf it were her former self, she would have been trembling.\nBut now, she was different.\nThat girl who used to mock her couldn’t even beat her now.\nIt was a pleasure to give her a beating laced with some resentment.\nShe flinched a bit whenever she had an opportunity, but there was no proper counterattack.\n“That bastard was able to handle a Grade 3 monster, so I should be able to easily deal with Grade 2 demonic beasts.”\nThe time when she envied her for defeating a Grade 3 monster had already passed.\nHer strength and stamina had gradually increased since taking the elixir.\nBefore she knew it, Arte Iris, that woman, couldn’t even lay a hand on her and only suffered defeat.\nShe had easily won against her on the day she took the elixir, so it was only natural, but still.\n“…so how are you going to…”\nA voice came from afar.\nA voice she had never forgotten.\nOf course, she couldn’t forget it.\n“Arte, hello.”\n“…Oh, Lyla. Hello.”\n“You seem healthy today. Is your thigh okay from yesterday? I think I accidentally hit it a bit hard.”\n“I’m fine. Thank you for your concern.”\nTch.\nHer expression didn’t change at all.\n‘I definitely hit her hard enough to bruise, but she shows no sign.’\n…What a waste.\n“Who would you like to team up with for this exam, Lyla?”\n“Me?”\n“Yes. They said it will be randomly assigned regardless of class.”\n“I don’t know.”\nShe didn’t care who it was.\nWith her strength, there was nothing she couldn’t do.\nShe didn’t think she could possibly lose to her fellow students.\n…Besides, she had no reason to stay at the academy now.\nThe organization had given her their first order.\nOn the day the academy students go outside, she would deliver a warning.\nÜbermenschen would now step into the light.\nTo announce Übermensch’s greatness to the world by offering the academy students as sacrifices.\nEveryone in the world would become aware of Übermenschen’s existence.\nSince she was still a prospective member, she hadn’t heard the exact plan.\nBut she had opportunities to listen to their ideology.\nIt was more plausible than she expected.\n“…Lyla?”\nShe was being urged to respond.\nShe wanted to twist that neck but decided to hold back.\nShe couldn’t blow her cover before the declaration of war.\nScratching her head vigorously, she went back to Arte’s question.\n…What was it again? Who did she want to take the exam with?\nIt didn’t matter to her who it was.\nAfter all, they would just become sacrifices for Übermenschen.\nIf possible, it would be easier if it was a weak one.\nAs she was thinking that, a certain person suddenly came into her view.\nSmiling serenely.\n“Ah, there’s one person.”\n“Hmm? Who?”\n“You.”\nConsidering she defeated a Grade 3 monster alone, she’s not exactly weak…\nBut with this strength she’s gained, there was no way she would lose.\nSince she’s someone she disliked, Lyla personally hoped she could become the sacrifice to make her name known to the world.\n“That works out well!”\n“Is that so?”\n“I wanted to team up with you too, Lyla. Since you’re strong, we’ll definitely get good results if we take the exam together, right?”\n“Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. If you and I work together, we can get good grades.”\nArte’s bright smile irritated her.\nThe annoyance made her vigorously scratch her head.\nAh, really.\nLyla couldn’t understand what she was thinking at all.\n‘This girl, I’ve been viciously beating her body for the past few days, yet she’s still smiling cheerfully like that.’\nShe controlled her strength to only leave bruises, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t hurt.\nIf she were an ordinary student, she should’ve been bedridden days ago.\n…Could it be that she wasn’t in much pain?\nNo, there’s no way.\nShe’s definitely just enduring the pain.\nForcing her unmoving body to move, having already reached her limit,\nWith the exam approaching, she’s desperately trying to keep going.\n“It would be great if we’re on the same team!”\n“Yeah, it would be great if we were on the same team. We’re friends, after all.”\nFriends, her and I?\nHa. What a ridiculous thought.\nIt’s just words that slipped out of her mouth.\nIf we end up on the same team, I will kill you.\nYou, who dismissed my efforts as mere talent.\nI wonder how gratifying it would be to see that annoying smile disappear from your face.\nScratching her head, Lyla looked at Arte’s smiling face.\n“Friends, that’s great! I feel the same way!”\n…She still didn’t understand what she was thinking.\nIt put her in a bad mood.\nTranslator’s Corner\nI know I don’t put this in, but Arte says “Author-nim” when calling the Author. -nim is usually used as an honorific or a polite way of referring to someone. Arte was probably Korean, but that could just be headcanon.\nOn a similar note, should I keep using Yu Siwoo when writing him, or just Siwoo?\n-Ruminas",

Really, both of us are spoiling you guys with chapters.\n“…She’s really being obvious about it.”\nLyla didn’t seem to have any intention of hiding the fact that she wanted to kill me.\nHer gaze burning into the back of my neck was scorching.\nShe was openly displaying hostility towards me.\nPretending not to notice was a struggle.\n“Have you decided on my group?”\n[Of course! There will be a spy, the protagonist, the Reader, and one extra! It’s perfect.]\n“You added an extra?”\n[Well, I had something in mind.]\nThe Author was thinking of something again.\nI prayed it wasn’t headed in a bad direction.\nI can’t control every little thing after all.\nIf I tried to control the Author’s every move, my mind and body wouldn’t be able to take it.\n[Hehe, I’m looking forward to the dungeon!]\n“…Oh, Author, can I ask for something.”\n[What is it?]\n“Can you give me some money?”\n[What?!]\nI felt the need to squeeze some more money out of the Author.\nThe first signs of trouble were brewing at the academy. I needed to prepare.\n[I can do that, but what is it for now?]\n“I want to buy some clothes.”\n[You’re exploiting me for your own desires! Reader, I didn’t expect this from you!]\nWhat are you talking about?\nI need to buy them.\n“I need to stay around the protagonist after all. I’ll need something to cover myself up in case anything happens.”\n[…Ah! I didn’t think of that! As expected from the Reader!]\nJust think about it.\nYou deliberately tied Siwoo, Lyla, and me together because you want to see the protagonist’s exploits, right?\nWhat  if hypothetically speaking, Lyla and Siwoo ended up in a one-on-one situation that I couldn’t witness?\nOr maybe some ancient horror could emerge as they made a fuss.\nI have to prevent that.\nOne way or another, I needed to observe Siwoo’s actions in important events.\nBut  if I openly followed Siwoo everywhere, he’d get suspicious, right?\nAccording to the Author, he can only detect physical threats…\nWould hiding be enough?\nWell, it wouldn’t hurt to be more cautious based on the Author’s actions, would it?\nThat way, even if I get found out, I can mumble some excuse as long as he doesn’t see my face.\n“I’ll buy a mask and hood.”\n[Should I add a voice modulation feature to the mask and a face recognition prevention enchantment to the hood?]\n“…Is that even possible?”\n[Nothing is impossible.]\n“Please do that then.”\nHow should I put it?\nIt felt like playing an RPG game with infinite money and items.\nThe Author is truly the best cheat.\n***\n“Oh, there you are, Prostitute.”\n“I told you not to call me that, Jeffrey.”\nThe woman turned around at the frivolous voice, and sure enough, a guy with a lecherous look was approaching her.\nWell, she already knew without checking.\nHe’s the only one who calls her by the ridiculous nickname “Prostitute.”\n“Why not? It fits. You’re a woman who uses a spear, so Prostitute.*”\nSwish!\nInstantly, she accelerated the spear she was gripping and brought it to Jeffrey’s nape.\n“Hiiick?!”\nFinally, he shut his mouth when the sudden attack left a small wound.\n“Ah, I got it. Sorry, Amelia.”\n“Call me that one more time, and I’ll slit your mouth open, got it?”\nHaah.\n‘This guy is really unlikable.’\nEven  if she warned him like this, the next day, he’d be singing “prostitute, prostitute” again like nothing happened.\nAmelia was just happy she could shut his mouth for now.\nAs much as she didn’t want to keep talking to such a man…She had no choice.\nJeffrey was skilled beyond belief.\nHe had a reputation as an informant even before entering the academy. She can’t not use him.\n“So, what information do you have on her?”\n“…Which one?”\n“Lyla first.”\n“Got it.”\nSitting leisurely on a park bench, he began to speak.\n“Well, about that failure student. I don’t understand why a lady like you wants me to investigate a girl like that, but…”\n“Just get to the point.”\n“There’s nothing much, except for the information that she suddenly got stronger recently.”\n“…Did she display any suspicious behavior around the time she got stronger?”\n“Nope. Even with the fee you paid, she hasn’t done anything.”\n“Tch.”\nA dead end, huh?\nIf he says there was nothing notable, then there really must not have been anything out of the ordinary besides her suddenly getting stronger.\nAmelia felt a tinge of disappointment and noticed he was staring intently at her.\nThe atmosphere felt strange somehow.\n“My hunch is that your target isn’t that failure student; it’s the other one, right? That failure student is probably just associated with her.”\n“Why do you think that?”\n“Ha, isn’t it obvious? Anyone investigating this would come to that conclusion.”\nJeffrey’s face suddenly contorted as he flipped through the documents with a sharp gaze.\nIt was like the look of someone who lost a bet they were confident in winning–not an ordinary bet, but one in their own area of expertise.\nIt looked like his pride had been scratched.\n“Arte Iris. No elementary school records. No middle school records. No high school records. No birth registration. No information on parents. No information on relatives. No information on birthplace…You’re kidding me, right?”\n“…”\n“You’re telling me a person with absolutely no background information is just walking around as a student at the academy?”\n“But can’t you find something more?”\n“Puahahahahaha!”\nJeffrey’s loud laughter drew the momentary attention of students in the park before they dispersed. After laughing until he was out of breath, he declared with a hardened expression.\n“Sorry, lady. I’m out.”\n“…What?”\n“I’m still a student, you know. I’ve got a long life ahead of me. I don’t want to die. To be honest, I wanted to just run away.”\n“Jeffrey, wait…!”\n“Since the fee you paid me was quite large, you’d better clean your ears and listen up.”\nAmelia wanted to stop Jeffrey as he tried to leave right away.\nBut his expression made her stop reaching out.\nIt was a look of sheer terror.\nHad he found something he couldn’t comprehend?\n“Arte Iris’ documents are incredibly sloppy. The academy teachers haven’t noticed because they lack the authority to view the document. Still,  if anyone outside investigated her even once, they’d catch on immediately.”\n“Then what?!”\n“Don’t you get it yet? Let me spell it out for you…They put a person who seemingly doesn’t exist in this world into the academy, which boasts the highest level of security.”\n“…!”\n“At the first sign of anyone catching wind of it, she’ll instantly be covered with false information. Where she lived, who she lived with, who her parents are… There might even be newly created childhood friends she never actually had.”\nHis words poured out like a machine gun, betraying his desperation.\nHe wanted out as soon as possible.\n…But as an informant, he had to finish the job.\nSo he would quickly give the information, then cut all ties with her.\n“They just haven’t felt the need yet. But know that it’s their choice to stay silent.”\n“…I see. I don’t want you getting in danger either.”\n“Okay…Sorry, lady. I wish the best for you.”\n“Thanks for your work, Jeffrey.”\nIn the end, Amelia couldn’t stop him from leaving.\n…But it wasn’t a complete waste.\nShe realized Arte was essentially a person who didn’t exist in this world; someone who may as well not exist at all.\nThe fact that she was an academy student was the only proof of her being a real person.\n“…That’s how it is.”\n“Someone who doesn’t exist in this world…”\nNo matter how much Siwoo and Amelia racked their brains, they came to the same conclusion–the midterm exams were dangerous.\n“Siwoo, you were in the same group as her for the midterms, right?”\n“Yeah. Lyla, me, Arte, and one other person.”\nWhen Arte communicated with the “Author,” Siwoo overheard that the academy would eventually be attacked.\nHe didn’t know exactly when it would happen, but still.\n“Be careful, Siwoo. Lyla definitely has some kind of connection to her.”\n“…Understood.”\nHonestly, he felt uneasy.\nOf all people, he was grouped with Lyla and Arte?\nIt felt like some cruel joke of fate, so he couldn’t help but lament.\nSiwoo zoned out for quite a while.\n“But you probably won’t die. Don’t worry…Of course, don’t let your guard down too much, just in case.”\n“Huh? I won’t die?”\nSeeing how tense Siwoo was, Amelia decided to give him a little encouragement so he didn’t have a total meltdown.\nIt wasn’t that difficult of a task.\nAll she had to do was add a bit of imagination to reality.\n“That woman seems to have taken an interest in you, you know.”\n“…I guess so?”\n“We don’t know exactly why she’s interested yet, but you wouldn’t suddenly kill someone you find intriguing, would you?”\n“Of course not!”\n“Right. It’s the same deal. As long as Arte feels that interest in you, she won’t just outright kill you.”\nAmelia wasn’t actually sure  if that was true or not.\nThe way villains act is quite varied, after all.\nBut there was no need to add to Siwoo’s anxiety with those kinds of thoughts right now.\n‘Still, I should give him a bit of a warning so he doesn’t let down his guard completely.’\n“…But don’t let your guard down too much either. Lyla is different from her; she might kill you  if you disagree with something.”\n“Got it, I’ll be careful.”\nWho would have thought the supposedly normal academy life would turn out to be such a roller coaster?\nLooking back, Siwoo almost pitied his former self, who prayed for an exciting academy experience when enrolling.\nExciting is an understatement–it’s been downright brutal!\nTranslator’s Corner\n*창녀 (prostitute) sounds similar to 창을 쓰는 여자 (a woman who uses a spear.)\nAlso, the writer of this series (had to write it this way so there is no confusion) replied to a comment with some spoilers. It concerns Arte’s potential relationships, so I’m cutting it.  If you want to know more, DM or ping me on the Discord server. It’s somewhere at the top of the page.\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "“Have you prepared enough for the exam?”\nClaire’s voice echoed.\nNot in the usual classroom but in a different location.\nYes.\nIt was the entrance to the dungeon that the Author so desired.\nBut something’s strange.\nIf they wanted it so much, why was she not saying anything?\n“Author?”\n[Yes?!]\n“What’s wrong, were you sleeping?”\n[No?! I-I was just nervous. Hehe…]\nWhy would they be nervous?\nIs it like feeling the excitement just before watching a much-anticipated movie?\nWhile I felt pity for the Author’s pathetic state, Claire’s voice echoed again.\n“You will now enter this place, the D-rank underground prison palace, Knosos Palace. Find your assigned team members and proceed.”\nKnossos Palace*, what a name.\nFor a D-rank dungeon, it sounds quite grand.\nBut how strong can a D-rank be?\nI don’t know. Let’s just assume it’s a relatively low level.\nSurely, they wouldn’t send inexperienced students into a dangerous dungeon right after enrollment, would they?\nThe Author won’t suddenly throw an S-rank dungeon at us after saying it’s D-rank, right?\n…Or will they?\nSuddenly, I felt anxious.\n“Author, this is just a D-rank dungeon, right?”\n[Yes? A D-rank dungeon is a D-rank dungeon. What else could it be?]\n“Oh, I see. It’s nothing.”\nHappily, it seemed the Author wasn’t as malicious as I had feared.\nPerhaps they hadn’t even considered it.\nI decided to just think that they have a good heart.\nSlowly, I looked around, wanting to find the protagonist.\nLuckily, it wasn’t too hard to find Siwoo.\nI could see a familiar head in the distance.\nHis height also made him easy to spot.\nLucky guy.\nI wish he were 10 centimeters shorter.\nI was a bit annoyed because even when I was a guy, I wasn’t that tall.\nShould I play a little prank on him since he’s so annoying?\nI lightened my steps and approached them.\nEveryone was busy searching for their team members, so my footsteps were naturally drowned out, and I easily sneaked up behind him.\nTap tap.\nI lightly tapped his shoulder.\n“…? Who–”\nAs they turned their head, I lightly poked their cheek.\nIt might be considered rude to do this to someone you’re not close with, but they’re the protagonist, after all.\nIt might be a bit over the top, but it’s a good way to quickly become friends.\nIf they feel bad about it, I’ll apologize.\n“Hello?”\n“–is…Arte!”\nWait, what? Why such a fright?\n…It’s like a reaction you’d have after watching a horror movie.\nHe looked as  if he’d seen something terrifying.\nWhy?\nWhat did I do?\nI felt a slight sense of crisis.\nIf things aren’t good between you and me, it’ll be difficult for the novel’s development.\nThere’s a limit to watching from the shadows every day.\nThinking the atmosphere might become awkward, I tried to speak as playfully as possible.\n“Are you really that scared of me?”\n“Sorry. You just surprised me.”\n“Hehe, it’s okay. Shall we go find the other team members then?”\n“Uh, yeah.”\nIs it gynophobia?\nNo, no way.\nSiwoo was having a good conversation with Amelia.\nIt can’t be gynophobia, right?\n…Does Yu Siwoo, the protagonist, have no friends?\nA sudden thought crossed my mind.\nCome to think of it, besides Amelia, he didn’t seem to have any close friends.\nOf course, it’s only been a short time since he enrolled in the academy, but…\nThe idea that he might have difficulty making friends suddenly came to mind.\n“I hope we can get along with the other members well.”\nWell, does it matter?\nI uttered empty words, knowing it wouldn’t happen.\nFriends? One is about to leave from here, and the other is just an extra. There won’t be time to get close.\nThe protagonist doesn’t need to interact with extras.\nIt’s enough to be friends with the main and supporting characters who stay here rather than those who just leave after being written in as fillers.\nWith such trivial thoughts, I found Lyla and the other member with Siwoo.\n“Alright. Yu Siwoo and three others. Confirmed.”\n[I’m so excited!]\n“Let’s go in. Don’t worry, we have surveillance cameras inside the dungeon in case of any emergencies.”\nClaire began reading the different safety precautions.\nIt seemed even the Author was forcibly calmed down by the prolonged bombardment of nagging.\n[Hmm… Having PTSD from losing a comrade, that setting isn’t too good. She’s talking too much.]\nI agree with that.\nIt’s really excessive, seriously.\nTo cut off the endless nagging that showed no sign of ending, I decided it was time to enter the dungeon.\nStarting to say the same thing for the third time is crossing the line.\n“Well then, let’s go in first.”\n“Wait, Arte! I haven’t finished talking yet!”\n“Hurry up, everyone. Nobody knows how long the teacher will keep us here.”\nAs I boldly entered the dungeon, the rest of the team followed me inside.\n[It’s really starting! Hehe, I’m excited.]\nAs the Author said, it was the beginning.\nNot of the academy’s exams.\nOf course, those were starting too, but…\nSomething even more important was beginning.\nThe start of the main story of the novel,\nWritten by the Author and me.\nThe chaos of the world will finally reveal itself.\nIsn’t that just typical of a web novel?\n***\n“Hup!”\nSwoosh!\nYu Siwoo’s sword left a trail of crimson blood splattered on the marble floor.\nThe body of a goblin crumbled, and after a brief moment, the corpse turned to ashes and scattered.\nAll that remained was a purple gem on the ground.\n…Yes, it is exactly what you are thinking.\nA mana stone.\nThe Author was going on about it being the next generation of energy or something.\nI don’t really understand that.\nI just have to go along with it, right?\n[Of course, there are goblins and mana stones in dungeons! That’s my protagonist! Fighting!]\nThe Author shouted with excitement, watching the protagonist’s exploits.\nNot like Yu Siwoo can hear them anyway.\nIt’s like cheering for a soccer player on TV, knowing they can’t hear you.\nThough I wish they’d keep it down because my ears were bleeding.\nThere were only four of us, so I had no choice but to endure not talking to the Author because I didn’t want to be treated like a crazy person.\n“…Phew, it’s not that difficult.”\n“Yeah. Siwoo is too strong.”\n“Hey.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Why aren’t you fighting?”\nFinally.\nI was wondering when Lyla would ask.\nShe’s been looking discontented since earlier.\n“I’m fighting with that guy up front, and the other one is playing the role of rearguard…What are you doing?”\n“I told you, didn’t I? I have to watch our flanks since we could be ambushed.”\nWell, it’s an excuse.\nI tried to come up with various excuses, but surprisingly, the rear guard student and Siwoo just nodded without complaining, so it passed more easily than expected.\nThe reason I’m not actively fighting?\nWell, it’s because of Lyla, who’s glaring at me right now.\nMy ability becomes increasingly disadvantageous the longer I fight.\nThe more I fight, the exponentially higher the cost becomes.\nAt first, it’s simple materials like stockings, rubber gloves, and the like.\n…Let’s not imagine the terrible outcome.\nI don’t want to become a pervert.\nAnyway.\nKnowing that Lyla will cause trouble inside this dungeon, it’s best I don’t actively fight while I can.\nBut then she started getting mad, saying I’m pulling her grade down.\nBut why do you care?\nWeren’t you going to quit the academy anyway?\nThe ones should be angry is not you, but Siwoo and that boy over there.\n“Let’s put the jokes aside. …I really can’t stand it anymore. I was planning to wait until we defeat the boss, but I can’t wait anymore.”\nLyla, who had been scratching her head from time to time, suddenly spoke mockingly.\nWhat’s with her? Already starting?\n“Lyla, please calm down…?!”\nCrash!\nSparks flew as swords collided.\nYu Siwoo, who had approached unnoticed, blocked Lyla’s attack as she charged at the male student.\n“…Fast.”\n“Thanks for the compliment. Hey, you. Could you quickly go to the teacher and tell her? There’s a traitor in our group.”\n“B-but you…!”\nGlance.\nSiwoo looked at me.\n…Huh, why?\nCould it be he’s treating me like a heroine? Huh?\nWhat should I do in this situation?\nShould I smile?\nI awkwardly smiled at Siwoo and he turned to the other member.\n“…Go quickly!”\n“Oh, okay!”\nWith a determined expression as  if he had made a decision, he turned his gaze to Lyla.\nOh, so he’s still the protagonist, huh?\nQuite impressive, isn’t it?\nProtecting weaker comrades and confronting a traitor alongside a heroine…Well I’m close enough to being one.\nThis dynamic is quite tasty.\n[…]\nThe Author seemed completely immersed, even forgetting to breathe.\nIt’s quite a scene to warrant that.\nSo, Siwoo.\nWhat will you do now?\nIn this moment of confrontation with the academy’s traitor aiming for you, with a pretty classmate standing behind you.\nWhat choice will you make?\n“Sigh,  if the three of you fought together, there might have been a chance to survive even a little. Idiots real–”\n“…Run!”\n“Huh? …Hey! Where are you going?”\nThe protagonist, Siwoo’s choice, surpassed my expectations.\nI thought he’d either ask me to fight together or tell me to go ahead without him.\nBut instead, taking advantage of Lyla’s momentary lapse, he dashed deeper into the dungeon.\nTowards the direction of the boss room.\n…Huh?\nWhat about me?",

      "content": "TN: Thank Clone Trooper for the chapter. Part 5\nSiwoo leaned against the dungeon’s wall to cool down his heated body and rest.\nAfter running for a while, he finally arrived at the boss room.\nKeeping an eye out in case someone approached and ready to enter at any moment, he took a brief rest.\n“Hah, that was really scary…”\nHis body gradually cooled down, but his heart was still pounding, unable to control itself.\nWell, he didn’t expect that Lyla would openly attack like that.\nIf it weren’t for his inexplicably heightened instincts, that male student might have had his head separated from his body by now.\n“That woman, she’s not in her right mind.”\nThe teachers said there were surveillance cameras.\nWhat was she thinking attacking them under these circumstances?\nNo matter how much he thought about it, he couldn’t understand.\nBut that was a minor question.\nIf Siwoo escaped this dungeon, the truth would come to light.\nHe needed to focus on the new information he had obtained for now.\n“Those guys weren’t on the same side…”\nHe thought Lyla and Arte were on the same side.\nThat intense hostility.\nThey didn’t seem to be allies, no matter how he thought about it.\nWas it an act? An attempt to deceive him?\nHe briefly considered that, but no matter how he viewed it, it didn’t seem like an act.\nWhen he glanced back while fleeing, Lyla swung her sword at Arte.\nWhen Arte dodged the attack, the dungeon wall was sliced cleanly as if cut by a blade. There’s no way that was an act.\nThey weren’t allies.\nEven if they were on the same side, their relationship must be extremely bad.\nThat’s how Siwoo judged it.\n“…Hah, well. Should I go in?”\nHonestly, he wanted to go back.\nJust turn back the way he came, leave early, go home, and sleep soundly.\nBut as someone once said, the shortest path is often the longest.\nFor Siwoo, the only path left was the boss room.\nThe boss room doesn’t reopen until the battle inside finishes.\nFirst, he needs to defeat the boss as quickly as possible, clear the room, and use the shortcut that opens to get outside.\nThen, he’ll quickly run to where the teachers are and report the situation.\nOkay.\nIf even one of them is seriously injured, that’s enough.\nOthers will be able to enter after leaving the boss room, but by then, Siwoo will have already escaped the dungeon.\nHe steadied his breath, pushed open the heavy door, and entered the boss room.\n“Moooooooo!”\n“Minotaur… The Palace of Knossos.”\nThe half-man, half-bull monster.\nThe human with a bull’s head. The Minotaur.\nUpon seeing that famous monster, one thought crossed Siwoo’s mind.\nCome to think of it, this is a boss that was meant to be cleared by four people together.\nThat’s the difficulty level the teachers set.\nBut he has to face a boss meant for four people to defeat, alone?\nSeeing the Minotaur charge at him with its battle axe raised, a look of injustice filled Siwoo’s face.\nSiwoo cried out, his voice filled with pent-up frustration,\n“Come at me! I’ll make you into ox-head soup!”\n“Mooooooo!”\nOh, wait a minute.\n‘It’s faster than I thought?’\nBefore Siwoo could react in his bewilderment, the Minotaur charged at him.\n“Uwah?!”\nHis instincts rang the alarm, and he jumped out of the way in shock.\nLuckily, he managed to evade the situation, but Siwoo couldn’t close his mouth.\nThat’s because he saw the aftermath after the Minotaur, having lost its target, rammed its head into the dungeon wall.\nQuake!\nThe boss room shook as if an earthquake had struck.\nThe crumbling dungeon walls showed him what could happen if he took a direct hit.\n“Ha, haha… Getting hit by that would probably hurt like hell?”\nForget ox-head soup.\nWould he even survive a hit without becoming ground meat?\nIf others were with him, the rest could buy time even if one fell. But Siwoo was alone.\nA single direct hit would be fatal.\nWith no time to heal from a deadly blow that would leave him immobilized, the moment Siwoo took that hit would be the end.\nSeeing the Minotaur charging at him with its huge battle axe raised, Siwoo swallowed his tears.\nNo matter what, at least this was better than that hallway where Arte and the traitor were.\n***\n“Huh, huh…”\nHow did he survive?\nA look of bewilderment filled Siwoo’s face.\nThat’s because he still couldn’t understand how he managed to survive.\nHe faced the threat of death several times.\nEven with his instincts, he shouldn’t have been able to dodge with his depleted stamina.\nWas he just incredibly lucky?\nThe Minotaur left behind a sizeable magic stone before vanishing.\nPicking up its magic stone, Siwoo laughed in relief, the tension leaving him.\nIn the end, he survived.\nFor now, that was enough.\n“Oh, here it is.”\nLeaving the ashes of the Minotaur behind, Siwoo began to search for the shortcut to escape the dungeon.\nIt didn’t take too long.\nIt felt like a short walk before he found himself in the forest.\nThe noisy sound of moving stones and the closing door of the shortcut seemed to celebrate his survival.\nBut the joy was short-lived.\nA question lingered in Siwoo’s mind.\n“…Hey, why is no one here?”\nHis pace wasn’t slow.\nUntil Lyla suddenly attacked, they were rapidly passing through the dungeon.\nThat there were no students was understandable, yes.\nIt was possible.\nBut at the exit point after clearing the dungeon?\nIt didn’t make sense that no one was there.\nJust as he was voicing that doubt,\nHis instincts suddenly rang out, and he threw himself forward.\n“Wh-What?!”\nOnly then, upon hearing the whooshing sound, did he realize why his instincts had warned him.\nAn axe.\nThe same axe the Minotaur had used.\nThat axe came flying at his neck.\n“Ah, too bad. It was a perfect shot. But you dodged it.”\n“Lyla.”\n“Geez, couldn’t you just die nicely? It’s so annoying.”\nClunk, clunk.\nLyla casually walked towards him with her bloodstained sword slung over her shoulder.\n“You, how did you…”\n“How what? I defeated the boss, can’t you see?”\nAs if annoyed, she scratched her head and nodded towards the battle axe that had just been thrown.\n“That stupid ox-head, it was so weak. Well, I guess that’s why it ends up being a punching bag for students like this.”\nWeak?\nOf course, it would be a simple opponent if faced by multiple people.\nBut fighting it alone, its overwhelming power, would not be easy to handle.\nNo, wait.\nThere was an even more puzzling question now.\n“Arte. What happened to Arte Iris?”\n“Huh? She’s dead. Can’t you see?”\nThe bloodstained sword Lyla carried glinted in the sunlight.\n…And above it, severed threads came into view.\n“Ah, that bitch. It’s said she defeated a Rank 3 monster, but she was just a nuisance.”\n“…So Arte is dead.”\n“Yeah. I’ll admit it was harder than I thought. I guess she liked being hit in our sparring sessions, huh? But by now, she’s probably buried under the rubble of the dungeon.”\nLyla said as she scratched her head.\n“She was annoyingly persistent. It was a bit of a struggle, but… now that she’s dead and you’re scheduled to die too.”\n“Even if you kill me now, one of the students has already gone to inform the teachers. It’s over for you. …I have no intention of dying easily.”\n“…Huh? Ah, ahahahahaha!”\nWhat’s up?\nSiwoo couldn’t understand why Lyla was laughing.\nHis instincts were ringing.\n“Haha, you’re hilarious. Do you know why there’s no one else here?”\n“…Huh?”\n“Why are you spacing out like that? It looks like you don’t know…Alright then, let me explain. While infiltrating the academy’s grounds is difficult, the dungeons are not.”\nInfiltrate the dungeon?\nSiwoo didn’t understand the meaning of Lyla’s words.\nWhat’s the point of infiltrating the dungeon?\n“The academy’s security is truly exceptional, but they can’t scrutinize the external dungeons as thoroughly. They fail to detect when the shortcut that appears after clearing a dungeon is opened a day in advance.”\n“…!”\n“In other words, right now, there’s no one here except you and me.”\nAs Lyla calmly walked towards him, Siwoo could feel his instincts ringing the alarm bells.\n…He could realize this situation was dangerous even without them.\n“I didn’t expect you to call the teacher, but…it doesn’t matter. I’ll just kill you before they arrive, and I’ll be gone by the time they get here.”\nSiwoo had pushed his body to the limit in order to defeat the Minotaur.\nHonestly, it would be hard to say he had enough strength to even run away now.\nBut Lyla’s appearance?\nFar from being exhausted, she looked completely fine, even relaxed.\nSeeing that unhurried demeanor, strength flowed into Siwoo’s body.\nNot to run away, but to stand up to her.\n“…What, still planning to resist?”\n“I don’t have a habit of begging for my life right before I die.”\nNo, in fact, he probably would have begged.\nBut that was until he met Arte.\nSiwoo, who had faced even more terrifying situations than this, could overcome his fear.\nAt least, that’s what Siwoo believed.\n“…Ah, you’re so annoying.”\nLooking at that defiant Siwoo, Lyla clicked her tongue in annoyance as she scrunched up her face.\nWas there something bothering her?\n“Can’t be helped. It’s the organization’s orders. I don’t hate people like you, but you have to die.”\n“…!”\nDespite his instincts’ warning, his muscles didn’t respond quickly enough.\nDid the Minotaur really take that much out of him?\n…Ah, I’m going to die.\nAs the sword approached his neck in an instant, Siwoo sensed his impending death.\n“That won’t do.”\nThe sword was caught by threads.\nAuthor’s Notes\nArte has arrived.\nBut maybe it’s because Arte came in a hurry?\nShe isn’t wearing her school uniform. She only has her leotard now.\nI sent a new one to her room, so it will be back soon.\nIt’s pretty.\nOh, by the way, they said they’ll (novelpia or an artist I assume.) give me the version with Arte’s eyes open later. Shall I wait with you?\nTranslator’s Corner\nThe art they’re referring to is the one I put some chapters ago.\nAlso, can someone remind me to add the chapters to novelupdates? Thanks in advance.\nAlso also, the Author’s notes are the hardest things to translate. I can’t tell if it’s the author of the novel or Author in the novel.\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "Thank Clone Trooper for yet another chapter. Part 6\n“…What is this?”\n[Ah, not too late! That was a close call!]\nPhew, what a relief.\nThat was really a close call.\nIf I had been a bit slower, Siwoo would have been torn apart.\nWas clearing those rocks really the fastest way?\nNo, but there was no other choice.\nI wondered  if I should use more thread, so I agonized over it for a while.\n“…You were alive?”\n“Haha, it seems so. My apologies to Lyla.”\nLyla seemed to really dislike me.\nIt was a little sad.\n..Though I did tease her a lot.\nWas she angry because I pretended not to know and talked about talent?\nWhen I think back to our conversations, that’s the only reason I can come up with.\nNo matter how I look at it, it was my fault, making me even sadder.\nBut there’s nothing I can do about it.\nThat was the easiest way to confirm.\n“…How?”\n“Hm?”\n“You should have been crushed to death by those falling rocks…”\n“Ah, you mean that? It would have hurt  if I really got hit.”\nI hastily used my ability on some loose threads wrapped around my arm.\nBeyond twisting and stretching threads, I tried making various shapes, such as triangles and squares. After recreating the Eiffel Tower, I even made a circle.\nHow’s that? This is thread crafting without using hands.\nPretty cool, right?\n“Fortunately, my ability is like this. I can wrap it around my body pretty quickly.”\n“…Tch.”\nThat’s going too far.\nIt was supposed to be my ultimate secret technique…\nI practiced hard as soon as I got this ability because I wanted to show it to people someday!\nDid I feel hurt earlier? Forget that.\nI felt like dying now.\n“Well, whatever. It was a bit unexpected that you survived, but nothing changes.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Hunting two weakened rabbits won’t be that difficult.”\nLyla grinned while scratching her head.\n…Huh?\nDid I see fangs?\n[Ah, it has begun. The side effects.]\n“…The side effects have started?”\nCome to think of it, Lyla took a suspicious drug to gain power.\n…Now? Suddenly?\n“Th-there are ears on your head!”\n“Nice try. Ears on my head? What kind of non…What is this!”\nEars sprouted around where Lyla was scratching her head.\n[That’s like a pro and a con, you could say? Hehe, it’s a drug that injects animal traits into humans!]\nAnimal traits?\n…Ah, so that’s why she’s past human. An Übermensch.\nShe has transcended humanity.\nIt has a double meaning.\nWas Lyla scratching her head because it was a premonitory symptom before the ears sprouted?\n[As time passes, the animal traits become stronger. They become incredibly powerful, but the animal characteristics manifest more and more. In the end, they become half-human, half-animal…]\nWait a minute.\nI think I heard something strange.\n“…Half-human, half-animal?”\n[Yes. Like the minotaur.]\nAre you kidding me?!\n“Let’s change that.”\n[…Huh? But the premise is that you get animal traits, so eventually, you’ll end up like that… And it’s hard to change it now.]\nI was dizzy.\nI underestimated the Author’s hipster tendencies.\nEven  if she’s an enemy, a beast?\nAre you insane?\nWhy would you ruin a pretty female spy character like that?\nIt’ll be a disaster  if you just randomly throw in such a divisive concept, even for a minor character.\nThe novel will explode!\nThe absolute limit for sub-humans is ears, tails, and eyes!\n“Stop it. Put in the premise or change it. Now!”\n[Wh-what…?! Ah, okay!]\nI guess the Author didn’t expect me to get angry.\nThe flustered Author hurriedly changed the premise.\n[Okay, I added a premise! Lyla is actually a descendant of a child born between a werewolf and a human hundreds of years ago! So, the traits won’t severely deform her body!]\n“Phew…”\nUsually, I would have wondered  if that premise could convince readers.\nBut I didn’t have the luxury to think about that.\nI just wanted to get away from this place, leading my exhausted body.\nI’ll scold them later.\nSince I saved the footage for the Author to watch, I decided to scold them while they watched it.\n“Is the security  camera premise done?”\n[Yes, yes… According to what you said, a sudden power outage three hours ago caused a malfunction.]\nGood.\nI fiddled with the USB drive tucked inside my white hoodie.\nNow I’ll take this and leisurely watch it with the Author, and that’s it.\nThere’s nothing left for me to do here.\nHow did I get the footage, you ask?\nIt wasn’t that difficult.\nI added a premise for the security guards on duty.\n[They occasionally play pool while smoking, at least for five hours.]\n… If I add a premise like that, I wouldn’t even need to sneak in.\nAfter taking all the footage saved on the computer in the empty security room onto the USB drive, I added that the CCTV malfunctioned three hours ago despite looking fine.\nThe creation of footage that shouldn’t exist in this world is complete.\nLastly, I just need to retrieve the thread wrapped around the USB.\nEasy, right?\nEven the academy can’t supervise everyone.\nThey’re too busy escorting all the other students, so which teacher would be free enough to check the CCTV?\nThey always outsource it to a reputable security company.\nThere’s always a shortage of high-quality manpower.\n…And accidents tend to happen from that kind of complacency.\nOh, the guards left their post, and unluckily, there was a power outage.\nAnd in those three hours, a traitor appeared? What an incredible coincidence.\n“What is this…!”\n“I’m sorry for the confusion, Lyla.”\nI clung to the white hoodie for no reason. Even though I knew no one was watching me, I hesitated unnecessarily.\nI was more conscious of their gaze.\nDidn’t they notice?\nSince I used most of the threads in my leotard to help Siwoo escape, this was the only thing I had left.\nI could’ve used it  if it were just a bit loose, but I used most of it to block the falling rocks and clear the rubble.\nI smiled like it was no big deal, but I could feel my face flushing red.\nHow embarrassing.\n“Please die?”\n***\nIt was a surprise attack.\nFlustered by the sudden situation, Lyla failed to react to Arte’s attack from a distance.\nAnd that was the end.\n“Is she dead…?!”\n“Yes, she died.”\nThe thread tied to the daggers rushed forward, and Lyla was distracted by her transformation.\nShe didn’t notice the daggers flying towards her back.\n…And that was the end.\nAfter easily dispatching the minotaur, that was the end of Lyla, who had threatened Siwoo’s life.\nIt was a pathetic death.\n“Then, I’ll be going.”\n“…Are you not going to kill me?”\nHe had witnessed Arte’s face flushed as she killed someone.\n“…? I have no reason to kill you, Siwoo.”\nSiwoo was relieved when it seemed like Arte would not kill him.\nThen he felt embarrassed.\nHe had entered the academy to become a hero, yet someone died before his eyes.\nLyla had been targeting his life.\nHe was well aware of that. It would be strange  if he didn’t know.\nBut…\nThe hero Siwoo aimed to become was not one obsessed with such things.\nSaying villains must unconditionally die is not heroic.\nThe hero in Siwoo’s mind is one who confronts and overcomes any hardship.\nEven  if hated by the world, they uphold the justice they believe is right.\nWhile aiming for such a heroic ideal, to feel relieved that he survived while someone else died…\nIt was simply laughable.\n“Siwoo, Arte! Answer if you’re there! Are you alive?!”\n“Oh, the teacher has arrived.”\n“Would you like to head back first? You seem tired.”\nSiwoo simply stared at Arte.\n“Wh, what is it…?”\n“I am currently weak. Mentally immature, and nearly died unable to handle a single traitorous villain…”\n“Huh?”\n“…Someday, I will become stronger than you.”\nSiwoo got up and started walking towards the direction of the teacher’s voice.\nFor now, he is immature.\nFor someone who couldn’t even handle the traitorous Lyla alone to claim he’ll become stronger is probably no different than a chick’s peeping to Arte.\nBut she is being careless.\nFor whatever reason, she has some interest in me.\nAmelia was right. For some unknown reason, she won’t kill me.\nThat reaction she showed me in a situation where it wouldn’t be strange to kill me.\nAt least for the time being, I won’t die.\nI am immature.\n…But being immature means there’s room to grow.\nIsn’t that why I came to the academy?\nKeep being careless.\nSomeday, I will become stronger than you.\n***\n“Uwahh… That was a scare. I-I thought he noticed. Brrr, it’s c-cold…”\nMaybe it was because I was so tense that I sweat a lot.\nThe chilly breeze instantly stole away my body heat from the cold sweat, and I rapidly started feeling cold.\nI tried covering up by pulling up the hoodie but couldn’t block out the chilly wind.\nWinter has already passed, so why is it still so cold?\nPlus, I don’t have my uniform anymore, either.\n“Still, it’s a relief though, Author. You almost got disappointed in the protagonist. Is he the growth type?”\n[…Don’t bring that up. Of course, the protagonist can only be Siwoo! The protagonist can be a little weak early on, you know!]\n“There you go again. ‘The protagonist abandoned the heroine…! Uwaaah!’ You were crying like that.”\n[Kyaaaaah! Kyaaaah! Kyaaaaaaaaah!]\nBut I’m not even the heroine.\n…Well, whatever.\nAnyone standing behind the protagonist facing off against a villain in that time, place, and situation would be seen as the heroine.\n“So, what now?”\n[W-well, I did say to kill her! Kill the ex-heroine!]\n“Aw, but that’s too mean. And what heroine? I already lied and said she died?”\nEven  if she’s not human, I still feel bad about it.\nIt’s human nature to feel bad  if you destroy a wild animal’s home and they’re freezing to death.\nAfter going this far, it would feel uneasy to just kill her.\n“A tail even sprouted.”\nFascinating.\n…Should I touch it?\nI’ve always wanted to touch a sub-human’s tail.\nTranslator’s Corner\nJust in case the double-meaning line went over your head, let me explain it to you. Übermensch translates to ‘overman’ or’ above man. ‘ In the line ‘she’s past human,’ it means she has surpassed the abilities of a normal human(above man) but lost a part of her humanity (sub-human.)\nOn a less complicated topic, the author of the story has some weird notes. She believed readers would think Lyla didn’t wash her hair, that’s why she kept scratching it. T̶h̶e̶ ̶n̶o̶t̶e̶s̶ ̶a̶r̶e̶ ̶p̶r̶e̶t̶t̶y̶ ̶f̶u̶n̶n̶y̶ ̶b̶u̶t̶ ̶p̶u̶l̶l̶ ̶a̶w̶a̶y̶ ̶f̶r̶o̶m̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶t̶o̶r̶y̶ ̶a̶ ̶b̶i̶t̶,̶ ̶s̶o̶ ̶I̶’̶m̶ ̶l̶e̶a̶v̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶m̶ ̶o̶u̶t̶.̶ Again, you can dm me on discord  if you really want to know. You could also just complain about the comments; I read all of them, so yeah.\nIt’s mainly comedy for now, so don’t listen to old me\n-Ruminas\nAuthor’s Notes\nI thought there was a lot of description of Lyra scratching her head.\nNo one questioned it.\nI wanted to hear you say why you didn’t she wash her hair.",

      "content": "“…Are you really sure it’s okay?”\n“Yes. Don’t worry about it.”\nI smiled and reassured Claire.\nThey really worry a lot.\nIs it because of the backstory trauma of losing a colleague?\nWhile I understand their clingy behavior to the point of annoyance, it irritated me a bit.\n“I was a bit shocked. I want to take a break for a bit.”\n“Ah, ah! Of course! But it’s better to be careful. It seems like Lyla had a colleague.”\n“…A colleague, you say?”\n“Yes. According to what you said, there should have been a body, but it’s since disappeared.”\nAh, that’s right.\nCome to think of it, she was a spy created with a similar feeling as the prelude to the attack.\nI had forgotten.\nShould I explain it properly?\n“…The Übermensch. She said something about Übermensch.”\n“Übermensch…? I see, thank you. I’ll look into it.”\n“Yes. Please do.”\n“Okay. …Get some good rest.”\nMs. Claire ended the conversation and left the room.\nIt was the end of a conversation that took about an hour.\n[Ugh… She nags too much…]\n“Well, that’s just her personality. Since erasing it would be a waste, we have no choice but to bear with it.”\nEven  if we find it annoying when we’re subjected to it, it becomes material when Siwoo is subjected to it.\nIt can’t be helped.\nIt’s better to deal with the annoyance rather than let it devolve into a bland literary device.\n“Well, since Ms. Claire is gone… Shall we go look for our animal-eared friend we hid again?”\n***\n“Haa, haa…”\n“Ah. Found you.”\nHer back feels like it’s on fire.\n…Ow, ow, ow.\n‘Why do I have to suffer like this?’\nLyla wanted to thrash about in pain, but the threads tying her to the tree showed no signs of breaking.\n“Hey, could you look at me for a sec?”\nIt’s so unfair.\nI just wanted to display my talents.\nThe organization told me I had talent.\nI just wanted to repay the organization.\nI wanted to be acknowledged…\nCrack.\n“?!”\n“Ah, I see you now. …Hello there.”\nA loud noise made her look ahead.\n…It’s that woman.\nThe smirking woman, Arte Iris, looks so vile.\n“Arte Iris, you…”\n“Yes, that’s my name.”\n“Die, die, dieee!”\nConsumed by rage, Lyla wanted to lunge at Arte.\nBut that was just wishful thinking.\nHer body couldn’t move in any direction, tightly bound to the tree.\n“Because of you, because of you, I couldn’t carry out the organization’s orders…”\n“Ah,  if it’s the orders of the Übermensch, you’ve fulfilled them adequately. Well done.”\n“…What?”\nWait a minute.\n…How does this woman know the organization’s name?\nShe never mentioned it.\n“Let’s see. To send a warning to the Academy while revealing the Übermensch’s presence to the world, was it? Not bad.”\n“You, you. How do you know about that…?!”\n“Ufufu. It’s a secret?”\nA chill ran down her spine.\nWithout realizing it, she had stopped thrashing about trying to attack Arte and was simply staring at her in a trance.\nShe knew everything.\nHer orders. The organization’s goals.\n…Probably even her inferiority complex.\nEverything.\n“Don’t worry. I made sure to tell the teacher that this was the work of the Übermensch organization. Your orders have been fulfilled!”\nThat’s when she realized it.\nWho she had provoked.\nWhy she was so relaxed during their fight.\n“Oh? Why are you trembling like that?”\nLyla suddenly realized,\nAll her actions up to now had been in the palm of Arte Iris’ hand.\nThat she had rapidly become stronger after taking the organization’s enhancer.\nThat she had intended to carry out the organization’s orders by causing trouble here.\nArte had known it all.\nThere was no other way to think about it.\n“Ha, haha… Kill me.”\n“Pardon?”\n“I was just a plaything in your hands? Go ahead and kill me.”\n“…Hold on a moment.”\nA moment of silence.\nThe only sounds were the chirping of insects and birds.\nWhen the human conversation ceased in the forest filled with white noise ambiance, the atmosphere became chillingly tense.\nLyla’s newly grown animal ear twitched at the inexplicable creepiness.\n“Oh, Author. Killing her would be a bit of a waste, you see. Yes, there’s a better way to use her.”\nAuthor?\nLyla was not sure what that meant. Seems like someone’s title.\nAnyway, how could she hear sounds from such a distance now?\n‘…Could it be the effect of the ears that grew on my head?’\nWith four ears, her hearing has become more sensitive.\nThe only certain thing is that Arte was not alone.\nIs she acting together with this “Author” person?\nAfter a long conversation with the “Author,” Arte slowly crouched before her.\n“Fortunately for you, Miss Lyla. The Author has given their understanding. You’ll be able to live!”\n“Ah, not die…? Me?”\n“Yes. You can live. I’d appreciate it  if you became my assistant!”\nAssistant?\nShe couldn’t understand what she was talking about at all.\n“Unfortunately, I’m short on manpower. I always wished I had someone to help me. You’ll certainly be useful with your outstanding physical abilities, Miss Lyla!”\n“…Just kill me–”\nAt that question, it was just for an instant,\nThe moment when Arte, who had been smiling, suddenly opened her eyes wide.\nLyla’s wolf-like tail and ears perked up instinctively in response to the perceived threat.\n“No, please allow me to be your assistant!”\n“Fufu. Good, Miss Lyla. A wise choice.”\nLyla regretted her past actions.\nShe had ended up working with this woman, all because of a mere inferiority complex.\nUnable to overcome that momentary emotion.\n“…However, one thing. I should put some precautions in place. It would be trouble  if you betrayed me, you see?”\nListening to Arte’s words, Lyla regretted again.\nIf she could go back, she would have beaten herself senselessly to stop herself.\nNow, she had become a puppet dancing in the devil’s hands.\n***\n[I wanted to refuse and let her die…]\n“Haa, I told you. There’s a limit to what I can do alone.”\n[But, but!]\nI let out a deep sigh at the Author’s stubbornness.\nThe Author thinks I’m some kind of superhuman.\nBut I have limits, too.\n“There are some things I must do, but I can’t do them  if I’m always monitoring Siwoo.”\n[…Um.]\n“Plus, wouldn’t it be better for the Author to have an extra handle the minor tasks, while I stay by Siwoo’s side to watch him?”\n[I-I see?]\n“Like in this case,  if I had an underling, I wouldn’t have needed to do the prep work myself to get the USB. I could have just ordered them to do it.”\nMy body is just one.\nThe Author mostly observes this world from my perspective.\nSo, I should stay close to Siwoo in most situations.\nBut if I don’t have someone to handle the odd jobs for me, I have to move whenever something minor comes up.\nWhat  if I miss a scene where Siwoo and a heroine set up a date while I’m away?\nThe Author would be sniffling for days after that.\nI didn’t want that.\n“And I’ve taken care of the Author’s concern about betrayal too, so please be convinced now.”\nI lightly shook the button in my hand.\nA single red button between the plastic casing.\nAnyone could recognize this object at a glance.\nA detonator.\n“With her life on the line, she won’t have any silly thoughts, right?”\n[I want to see Siwoo’s exploits!]\n“Good you understand.”\nWell, it’s not actually a real bomb, though.\nEven  if she tries to rebel, she won’t die.\nInstead of a bomb, there’s my thread inside the collar around Lyla’s neck.\nThis detonator-looking thing is just a fake.\nIf she tries to take the collar off or shows signs of betrayal?\nShrrk.\nThe thread will lash out violently, shredding anything around it.\nShe’ll lose a limb, at the very least.\n“…Tch.”\nImagining ripping off one of Lyla’s arms put me in a foul mood.\nI don’t quite understand why I’m being so considerate. I could just kill her.\nSure, I needed an underling to act as my hands and feet.\nBut it took some effort to convince the Author.\nThere was even less reason to spare this villain girl who was, at best, a potential heroine.\n…It’s not like I can’t kill people.\nI’ve already killed someone on the very first day I came to this place.\nAn accident caused by my inexpert use of my abilities.\nSome punks trying to mess with my body during  the momentary lapse in my control.\nAt that time, I was unnaturally calm looking at the corpses.\nNo, perhaps I just lacked a sense of reality.\nThe Author calmly disposed of the sprawled bodies in an instant, further distancing me from reality.\n[…? Dear Reader?]\n“No, it’s nothing. Now let’s see… Ah, here we go.”\nAm I feeling guilty for turning an ordinary student into a villain?\nOr was I just being capricious?\n…Who knows? Thinking about it is just giving me a headache.\nI should think simply.\nI just wanted to keep her alive. Isn’t that enough?\n“Alright, let’s watch the vid-”\n[…Huh?]\nWhat’s this?\n…Where did the video go?\n“The, the video is…Where did it go?”\nI started searching through the folders on the USB one by one.\nThe video was nowhere to be seen.\nDon’t, don’t tell me…\n“I, I found i-?!”\nAh.\nI thought I found it, but.\n…The video was there, yes.\nBut it was just the remainder, excluding the portion deleted by the power outage setting.\n“D-did I mess up the settings…?”\nInstead of a power outage, I should have used a different reason.\nSince the reason was already recorded as a power outage, all the footage I had must have been treated as not being recorded due to the blackout.\nIt was my mistake.\n[I, I trusted you.]\n“Author, c-calm d-”\n[I trusted you, dear Reader! Waaaaahhhhh!]\nThis is maddening.\n…How do I fix this mess?\nA different kind of headache started coming on, unlike before.\nI began regretting my earlier actions.\nI really should have gotten an underling sooner.\nAuthor’s Notes\nI stopped before Lyla became a furry and just became a pretty girl with animal ears.\nThere were more people than expected who accepted it as furry.\nEveryone has those tastes.\nTranslator’s Corner\nThere is a lot of stuttering in this chapter, and I used to different formats: ‘I, I trusted you,’ and ‘Author, c-calm down.’ I wanted to show a difference in timing with commas being a small pause, and dashes being faster.\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "[Waaaaaaaaaah!]\nI’m going crazy.\nThe Author’s crying didn’t stop.\nThere was no choice.\nI really, really didn’t want to do it.\nI wondered for a long time if I should even say this.\nShould I really do it?\nBut wouldn’t it be better than letting them keep crying like this?\n…It would be better, right?\n“What should I do?”\n[Sniff…What?]\n“I’ll grant you one wish, whatever you want.”\n[…!]\nThe Author’s crying subsided.\nIt was certainly effective.\n…The problem is the aftermath. I have no idea what kind of demand they’ll make.\nBut there was no choice.\nAt this rate, they would clearly cry all day.\nNo matter how much I tried to console them, I was already pinned as the culprit.\nNo matter what I said, it wouldn’t get through.\nIn the end, the only thing I could do to console the Author was to make up for it.\nMaterial things were impossible.\nAnd the situation wasn’t suitable for giving something mental or emotional either.\nThe only answer was to grant a wish.\n…Even though I came to that conclusion and said those words, I was already starting to regret it.\nI shouldn’t have said it.\nI was already starting to dread what kind of demand they would make.\nAs expected, the demand the Author voiced left me stunned.\n[Then…can I write a fan service scene?]\n“What? But we agreed not to do that!”\n[But…! You said you’d grant me one wish!]\nAh.\n…I really shouldn’t have said that.\n“But I’m a man?”\n[You’re a woman right now! And you’ve already heard everything! Since you’re a man, you won’t go back on your word, are you?! You said you’d grant me one wish! I’ve decided on this fan service scene!]\nNo, it’s not too late yet.\nEven if it’s a fan service scene, I don’t necessarily have to participate.\nI could just peek at Amelia and Siwoo cuddling…\n[An academy would have swimming classes, too, right? It wouldn’t be weird, hehe.]\nThey say you always have to be careful with your words.\nI deeply realized that advice that I had always taken for granted,\nThrough the disaster I brought upon myself.\nThe mouth is indeed the root of all evil.\n***\n“This is your first order, Lyla.”\n“…”\nGulp.\nLyla’s swallowed nervously.\nCompletely tense and stiffening her body, she scrutinized intently what kind of order would come.\n…An assassination?\nOr maybe terrorism?\nIt could even be a robbery.\nOr if not, maybe she’s just being treated as a disposable…!\n“What kind of swimsuit would be best to wear for the academy’s swimming class?”\n“…Huh?”\nWithout realizing it, Lyla asked back.\nShe immediately covered her mouth, fearing what punishment she might receive for defying that woman.\nFortunately, it didn’t seem to bother her much.\n“Was I not clear enough? No, what kind of swimsuit do women wear…?”\n“Um, I don’t quite understand what you’re…”\nNot caring about Lyla’s flustered state, Arte just said what she wanted to say.\nAt least, that’s how Lyla felt.\n“Okay, this is an order, Lyla. Get me a swimsuit that fits me…One with as little exposure as possible.”\n“A swimsuit…?”\n“There’s a swimming class coming up soon. Embarrassingly, I don’t have a swimsuit.”\n…Is it some kind of code?\nNo, this is the first order.\nAnd there’s no need for codes in this one-off situation.\nShe really just wants me to buy a swimsuit?\n“Ah, first buy it and bring the receipt, and I’ll reimburse you. Don’t worry.”\n“Yes, yes…”\n“Get one with as little exposure as possible. That’s the most important part?”\nArte’s smile seemed gloomy.\nThere was no such thing as a swimming class to begin with.\nThere had been no swimming class in the academy’s curriculum so far.\nThere was no mention of a swimming class being added either.\nBut Lyla nodded her head.\nIt was pointless to think about it now.\nShe probably gathered the information from somewhere.\nIt’s someone who knew about the existence of Übermensch, so something this pointless was a matter of course.\nShe must have some secret intel on the academy as well.\n“I understand…”\n“Excellent. If you do a good job, I’ll reward you. You can look forward to it.”\nLyla ignored Arte’s words.\nA reward? It’s not going to be anything special anyway.\n***\n“Everyone, pay attention. There’s an announcement.”\nAs the students were chatting and waiting for Claire after class,\nWhen her voice rang out, the students’ eyes turned towards her.\n“What’s going on?”\n“I wonder if someone transferred again?”\nTransferred.\nA wry smile crossed Amelia’s lips.\nLyla was “transferred” out of the academy.\nAccording to Siwoo, Lyla was likely an enemy or part of the same organization as Arte but had a terrible relationship with her.\nAs a result of the confrontation between them, Lyla died.\nArte didn’t seem to intend to kill Siwoo.\n…That’s what she said.\nIt must have been a burden for the academy to have incidents happen one after another.\nLooking at how they covered it up as a “transfer.”\nWell, it wasn’t incomprehensible.\nA student turned traitor.\nEven if they managed to get past the monster incident, an even bigger incident occurred shortly after.\nThey must have done their best to cover it up.\n“…You all enrolled at the academy to become heroes. As heroes, you must be able to rescue civilians in an emergency.”\nThe students agreed with Claire’s words.\nThe safety of civilians is the top priority.\nIt wasn’t a wrong statement.\n“Tomorrow’s class will be swimming as preparation for water rescue training in case of an aquatic disaster.”\n“Ooooooh!”\nSwimming class?\nThe excited chatter of the students echoed from all around.\nThey’re still students at an age where they love playing in the water.\nIt’s only natural they’d be excited about swimming.\n“Quiet! …A hero must be able to swim. In a water disaster, can you call yourself a hero if you’re the one being rescued?!”\n“No, ma’am!”\n“Right. Come to class tomorrow with your swimsuits. That’s all.”\nAfter Claire left,\nThe students’ excited voices flowed from all around.\n“Swimming, I’m looking forward to it.”\n“Yeah. I wonder if the one I bought last time still fits?”\n“You should definitely get a new one. You got fatter, didn’t you?”\n“…You wanna fight?”\nSwimming.\nWith the students’ noisy chatter in the background, Amelia suddenly touched her stomach.\n‘…I probably didn’t gain that much weight, right?’\n“Do you know how to swim, Amelia?”\n“Of course I do. It’s basic, isn’t it?”\n“I guess so. That’s a relief.”\nAt Siwoo’s words, Amelia replied curtly but then suddenly froze.\nSeeing Amelia’s abrupt stop, Siwoo called out in concern.\n“A, Amelia? …Are you okay? Did you get hurt somewhere?”\nSiwoo.\nSwimming class.\nArte Iris.\nAnd her, Amelia.\n…This is it!\nSimulations ran through Amelia’s head.\nWith this, they might be able to find evidence of that “Author”!\nAmelia was convinced.\n“Listen, Siwoo.”\n“O, oh, thank goodness. I thought you were hurt somewhere…”\n“That’s not the important part.”\n“…Huh?”\nDidn’t he realize the significance when he heard about the swimming class?\nI decided to ask if anything came to Siwoo’s mind.\n“Swimming class, a swimming class. …Do you understand the meaning of this?”\n“No, I don’t.”\nHow could he not think of this?\nAmelia felt frustrated.\nShe had no choice but to explain her brilliant idea to Siwoo.\n“For her to communicate with that ‘Author,’ there must be some kind of device, like a tiny transmitter.”\n“I suppose so?”\n“And for the swimming class, we’ll only be wearing swimsuits in the water, so she can’t keep anything in her clothes.”\n“…Ah!”\nThat’s right.\nHe finally realized it.\nSiwoo, who came to the same conclusion as her, brightly smiled.\n“During the swimming class, we can secretly inspect her clothes…!”\n“Right. We can find evidence. Then, we can cooperate with the teachers.”\n“Wow, brilliant. I couldn’t think of that.”\nSiwoo seemed impressed by her brilliant idea.\nAnd rightly so.\nThis is truly a perfect plan.\n“Then, while I keep watch on her, can you…”\n“Huh? What do you mean? You’re the one inspecting her clothes, not me.”\n“What?”\nWhat’s with that confused reaction?\nDid she say something wrong?\n“You’re not the one investigating?”\n“You’re not friends with Arte, are you? Can you really stick by Arte’s side the whole time?”\n“Well, that’s…”\nRight.\nSiwoo isn’t friends with Arte.\nWhile Arte seems very interested in Siwoo and secretly watches him, outwardly, they don’t seem close at all.\nHe can’t suddenly act like they’re close friends.\n“I’m friends with Arte. I can naturally move around with her and let you know her location.”\nAmelia occasionally hung out with Arte to maintain our friendship.\nSo it wouldn’t be strange for them to be together for the entire swimming class.\nBut there are too many variables for Siwoo to monitor Arte the whole swimming class.\nIn other words, monitoring her should fall to Amelia, not him.\n“So you end up with the natural remaining role of inspecting her clothes. Got it?”\n“…Do I really have to?”\n“Of course. It’s a chance to discover that ‘Author’s’ true identity.”\nThough Siwoo looked unsatisfied, he eventually nodded.\nGood.\n“I’m looking forward to tomorrow. A chance to get a hold of that ‘Author’s’ identity.”\n“Y-Yeah, I guess.”\n‘As expected, I’m the one.’\nIt was a perfect plan.\nA sense of pride spread across Amelia’s face.\nAuthor’s Notes\nYou guys know that you shouldn’t imitate things like that, right?\nBecause it’s a crime.\nTranslator’s Corner\nTitle really is clickbait lmao.\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "“Do I really have to do this?”\n“You’re asking that now? We’ve already made all the plans.”\n“But no matter how much I think about it, this doesn’t seem right…”\nA sigh escaped Amelia’s lips.\nWhy was Siwoo so hesitant now?\nInstead of scolding Siwoo, Amelia decided to convince him.\n“I told you. Since you can’t monitor Arte yourself, I have to do it in the end.”\n“I know you’re more suitable for monitoring Arte… But this is a crime.”\nSiwoo’s eyes wavered with anxiety.\nYes, it’s a crime.\nAnd a very bad one at that.\nA male student entering the girls’ changing room deserves condemnation.\nOn top of that, going through a female student’s belongings?\nIf caught, there’s no excuse.\nAt that moment, you immediately become a sex offender.\nExpulsion is certain, and your future life will be ruined.\nEven now, if Siwoo monitored Arte and Amelia searched through her things…\n“Don’t worry. I’ll make a loud noise if someone else approaches the changing room. There’s no way you’ll get caught.”\n“Do we really have to do this…?”\n“Didn’t I already tell you not to worry so much? It’s only a crime if you get caught.\n‘Even if you don’t get caught, a crime is still a crime.’\nSiwoo wanted to retort but soon closed his mouth.\nYes.\nEven if you don’t get caught, a crime is still a crime.\nNo one knows about Arte Iris’s criminal behavior except for me and Amelia.\nTo obtain evidence of that criminal behavior…!\nSiwoo steeled his resolve.\nTo obtain evidence of the crime.\nAmelia has already decided this is the best way to proceed.\nIf it’s unavoidable, it’s better to get it over with quickly.\n“…Alright.”\n“Good. That’s the spirit. Let’s go quickly. Arte is waiting.”\nSiwoo tried to suppress the guilt in his heart.\n***\n“Ugh. Do I really have to wear this…?”\n[Why? It’s pretty.]\n“But I don’t want to wear something like this!”\nArte felt resentful.\nShe had clearly asked Lyla for a swimsuit with little exposure.\nWhat is this?\n[…But this swimsuit still seems to have less exposure than a bikini.]\n“It may expose less than a bikini, but…!”\nWhat I wanted was a one-piece swimsuit.\nYou know, like those leotard-style competition swimsuits you see in web novels?\nWith a modest school-swimsuit kind of vibe and little exposure.\nThat’s the kind of swimsuit I wanted.\nWhen I checked the swimsuit I received this morning, I was devastated.\n[Most heroines just wear bikinis, though, so isn’t this a compromise since it shows less skin? It’s too late now anyway.]\n“…”\nI gazed glumly at the swimsuit in my hands.\nYeah, it’s not a bikini.\nTechnically, it is the one-piece swimsuit I wanted.\n…Except for the parts exposing skin here and there.\n“And why is there nothing on the back at all?…Cost-cutting on material?”\nIt is a one-piece swimsuit.\nAside from the plunging neckline and open back.\nThe fact that it thoroughly covers the butt area is almost more infuriating.\nThey spared some modesty after going to such extremes on the back.\n“Did Lyla really think this had little exposure…?”\n[Probably? All the heroines just wear bikinis, after all. So this has a similar vibe…? Being a heroine candidate probably influenced her thinking.]\nThey make a fair point.\nSo I can’t really blame Lyla.\nI should have just gone and bought one myself.\nInstead of embarrassingly asking her to…\n“Arte, what are you doing over there?”\n“Ah, Amelia.”\nAmelia called out to her.\nMy gloomy mood lifted a bit.\nAmelia was the only friend I was close to at the academy.\nHaha, see, I’m not a loner!\nAnd with such a pretty and kind heroine as a friend!\n“Let’s head in. If we don’t shower now, we’ll be late for class.”\n“Oh, ah…just a moment…”\nI’m not ready yet…!\nBut my feeble protest was drowned out as Amelia led me by the hand into the changing room.\n“…Wow, your breasts are bigger than I expected.”\n“Haha…really?”\n“Mine are barely there…here, share some with me.”\n“There’s no way that could happen…”\n“Tsk.”\nTrudge, trudge.\nAfter finishing the shower, I dragged my feet weakly towards the pool.\nI’m so tired…\nAmelia seemed unusually tense today.\nShe was oddly clingy.\nCome to think of it, why has the Author been silent since earlier?\nThey would normally be chattering away.\nTaking advantage of having come out before Amelia, I whispered softly to the Author.\n“…Author?”\n[Yes, yes?!]\n“Why are you so startled? I was just wondering why you were so quiet.”\n[Oh, it’s just… I was wondering if this really is a web novel. The heroines actually do touch each other’s breasts in the shower scenes, huh…]\n“…Just what did you see exactly?”\nI can guess what the Author is referring to.\nIn web novels, there’s often that kind of thing, right?\nThe heroine with small breasts goes “Eii, eii!” while groping the one with breasts bigger than her head.\nThe big-breasted heroine screams, and the guys nearby let their imaginations run wild after hearing it.\nBut we didn’t grope each other’s breasts at all.\nIt was all just normal…well, not exactly normal.\nI did fumble around a bit while showering with my eyes closed.\nAnd it took some time since Amelia was helping me.\nEven though I’ve gotten used to my own body to some degree, seeing someone else’s naked form was a bit…different.\nI wondered why the usually talkative Author was so quiet, but were they jotting notes to use as material?\nOf course, I know the Author doesn’t simply transcribe events from this world directly but alters things to some extent.\nThat’s understandable since they can’t fully grasp Siwoo’s way of acting.\nBut I just couldn’t comprehend it at all.\nJust what kind of filter did the information go through on its way from the eyes to the brain for them to perceive it like that?\nIt was baffling.\n“Ah, Amelia. Over here.”\n“Mm.”\nWhile conversing with the Author, I called over Amelia, who had exited the changing room.\n… As expected of a heroine straight out of a novel, wearing a white bikini as if it were only natural.\nThe pure white bikini gave off a strangely lewd aura.\nThere’s no way I could wear something like that!\n“Everyone, pay attention! Before the swimming lesson, I’ll explain some precautions!”\nAh, it’s starting.\n… I’m feeling a bit excited.\nAside from when I was little, I haven’t enjoyed playing in the water.\nSince I’m in this situation already, I may as well try to have some fun.\n***\n“Ex-excuse me, teacher. I need to use the restroom for a bit…”\n“…Hm? Oh, sure. Go ahead. Come to the classroom if no one is back when you return.”\nSiwoo grimaced while clutching his stomach and breaking out in a cold sweat.\nSeeing his state, the teacher seemed to easily guess the situation and promptly excused me.\nSince he had just demonstrated swimming proficiently, they probably thought he didn’t need more practice.\nAs soon as he reached the empty hallway, he relaxed his grimacing expression, but the cold sweat still flowed.\nThat part wasn’t just an act, after all.\n‘… I’ve really gone too far to be able to turn back now.’\nIt’s time to sneak into the girls’ changing room.\n“No one’s around, right…?”\nIn one quick motion, Siwoo swiftly opened the door and slipped inside the changing room without hesitation.\nAs Amelia said, hesitating would only make me look more suspicious.\nBrazen confidence is key.\nThat was the only advice she had given.\n“Phew, phew…”\nFor some reason, it smells different from the boys’ changing room.\nNo, that can’t be right.\nIt must just be my imagination.\n“Arte, Arte… There she is. Arte Iris.”\nFinding Arte’s locker wasn’t that difficult.\nThey were arranged in alphabetical order by name.\nAnd Amelia’s locker was right next to it, so it had to be right.\n…For some reason, it smells better than the boys’ lockers, though.\nThe strange thoughts kept surfacing, so Siwoo hurriedly opened and rifled through the locker.\nNeatly organized clothes.\nTrying his best not to dwell on the black leotard, Siwoo began rummaging through the clothes.\n“…Why isn’t it here?”\nBut strangely, no matter how much he searched through the clothes, he couldn’t find any kind of device anywhere.\nThere were just clothes, some cash, and a smartphone.\nSiwoo began growing increasingly anxious.\nHe had thought he would find it quickly, but over ten minutes had already passed.\nIf it took this long, the class could end.\nHe had slipped out after the class had started to some degree, trying to find an appropriate time.\n“Arte! Let’s go together!”\n“…!”\nAs he anxiously searched for the device, Amelia’s loud voice called out.\nThe voices of students who had approached at some point.\nHe had been so focused on searching that he didn’t notice.\nWhen he finally checked the time, twenty minutes had already passed.\nHe had failed.\nSensing his failure, Siwoo hurriedly tried to get up and leave.\nBut when in a rush, mistakes happen.\nThe floor of the pool changing room is always wet and slippery.\nWith water always around, it can’t be helped.\nThat’s why teachers tell you not to run in the changing rooms.\n…The price of not heeding the teacher’s warning was dire.\nCrash!\nHe fell with a loud noise.\nSiwoo wouldn’t be seriously injured just from a fall as a human who can wield mana.\nThe problem was time.\n“Arte, was that fun?”\n“Yes, it was enjoyable.”\nBefore long, he heard Amelia, Arte, and the other students outside the changing room.\nIt was too late to try leaving the changing room now.\n…Oh, what do I do?\nThere was no time to think.\nSiwoo decided to hide his body in the most concealed place possible.\n“It would be nice if we had another swimming lesson.”\n“We probably will. Having a pool but not using it much would be a waste.”\n“Hehe, you’re right.”\nIt’s over. Siwoo sensed it.\nWithout thinking, he had climbed into an open locker.\nYes, into Arte Iris’s locker.\nHow was he supposed to escape from here?\nIt was a huge mistake.\nNot only had he snuck into the girls’ changing room, but now he would be labeled a pervert sniffing a female student’s belongings inside her locker.\n“…Mmm.”\nAnd adding to his misery, there was actually a really nice scent, making it even worse.\nNot perfume, but the indescribable natural scent of the opposite sex.\nFrom the leotard covering his face, he could smell Arte’s fragrance.\n“Ah, Arte. Sorry, I need to use the restroom. Will you come with me?”\n“Huh…? Go ahead. I’ll wait for you.”\n“Aw, why not? Won’t you go with your friend?”\n“I suppose…? Yeah. Since we’re friends. Okay.”\n…!\nUnintentionally, an opportunity had presented itself to Siwoo.\nArte had gone to the restroom with Amelia.\nThe female students had changed clothes and left.\nNow was his chance.\nHe burst out of the locker like a bullet.\nAfter confirming the empty hallway, he went straight to the boys’ changing room.\nSiwoo finally grasped his pounding heart in the quiet changing room and held back tears.\nHe had survived.",

      "content": "The sound of water flowing from the sink echoed.\n“…Um, is this right?”\nWatching Amelia carefully washing her hands, I quietly asked the Author.\n“Excuse me, Author.”\n[Yes?]\n“Do girls normally go to the bathroom with their friends like this?”\nI had seen groups of girls going to the bathroom together occasionally.\nI also heard online that women follow each other to the bathroom.\n…But do they really?\nI guess you’d have to live as a woman for a long time to know.\nI have no idea.\n[I don’t know either.]\n“You’re a woman, but you don’t know something like that?”\n[…I didn’t have friends.]\nOh.\nSuddenly, the atmosphere became somber.\nIt seems I brought up something I shouldn’t have.\nI shouldn’t have asked.\nFortunately, the awkward atmosphere didn’t last long.\nAmelia finished her business and came over to me.\n“Sorry, did I take too long?”\n“Don’t worry, I was also solving my own problems.”\n“…?”\nI didn’t bother explaining further to Amelia’s questioning look.\nShe wouldn’t understand even if I told her.\n“Well, shall we head back? The teacher will be waiting.”\n“Yeah, let’s go back.”\nIt had been a while since I played so much, I was getting hungry.\nI should eat something delicious.\nThe academy has good food, which is nice.\nI wonder what I’ll eat today. I’m starting to look forward to it.\n“…Something feels off, though.”\n“Huh? What is it?”\n“No, it’s just that my clothes are unusually wrinkled.”\nEven though I had neatly arranged them before?\nThey were crumpled slightly, as if someone had touched and messed them up.\n“Well, maybe someone mistook it for their clothes? People mistake their lockers quite often, no?”\n“…I suppose so?”\n“Yeah. There’s just a name on it and no real locking mechanism. Maybe a careless person touched it by mistake.”\nHmm.\nYeah, what Amelia said made sense.\nIt felt a bit unpleasant, but well.\nSomeone else could have mistakenly touched it and put it back.\nJust as I was about to dismiss it with that thought, I noticed a hair stuck to the leotard.\nIt was an unusually short length, and the hair was black.\n“…There seems to be a short hair here.”\n“Oh, that must be your hair… You have black hair, don’t you.”\n“But my hair isn’t this short…”\n“You didn’t know that? …Oww!”\nI was greatly flustered to see Amelia suddenly pulling out strands of her hair.\nShe ended up pulling out far more than she intended, clutching about five or six strands in her hand as her eyes welled up with tears.\n“L-Look at this. Shorter than my hair, right?”\n“…I suppose so?”\nI wondered why she had abruptly pulled out her hair until I realized she was showing it to me.\nTrue to her word, while she had much longer hair overall than me, the strands she pulled out were similar and short compared to mine.\n“Sorry, I may have overreacted a bit.”\n“Y-Yeah… Let’s head back quickly.”\nStill, something felt off.\n…Ah, I had a good idea.\nI should mention it to the Author later.\n***\n“Hey, how did it go?”\nAfter school, Siwoo saw Amelia hurriedly approach him.\n…He didn’t know what to say.\n“Sorry.”\n“I see. So it failed after all. I thought that was possible.”\n“…Huh?”\nShe knew it might fail?\n‘And you still put me in that situation?’\nHe glared at Amelia with that implication, but she calmly responded without a care.\n“Well, they could be a telepath, you know.”\n“Then why did we do the infiltration thing…?”\n“If it’s not a long-range telepathic ability, we could have captured them in the act. But it failed in the end.”\n“You put me in that dangerous situation without being sure?”\nNo matter how he thought about it, this wasn’t right.\nCouldn’t there have been a slightly more moderate approach?\nHe knew her way of thinking was extreme, but this was too much.\nIf he had gotten caught, it wouldn’t have ended with just expulsion.\nSiwoo was about to unleash my fury, but Amelia’s voice stopped him.\n“But in the end, you didn’t get caught, right?”\n“That’s not the point of whether we got caught or not…!”\n“Can you at least think about how I had to take Arte outside while you were hiding in that locker?”\n“…So you noticed.”\n“Isn’t that obvious? You didn’t come back. It was clear you were somewhere in the changing room, and where else could you have hidden besides a locker?”\n“Kuh…”\nSiwoo had some counterarguments, but he couldn’t refute her any further.\nIt wasn’t that her logic beat him.\nIt felt like an unwanted sensation was arising.\nHearing her mention the locker made him recall the feel and smell of that leotard.\n‘Ah, no. I shouldn’t think about it.’\nHe forced his reddened face to cool down.\n“Here, take this.”\n“…What is this?”\n“Open it, and you’ll see.”\nAmelia handed him a black bag while he was calming his flushed face.\nWith a questioning look, he opened the bag.\n…Inside was content you’d only see in movies.\nThe bag was filled to the brim with cash.\n“?!”\n“I’m not just going to leave it at that and wash my hands of it. Here, isn’t this enough for hazard pay? Don’t worry, it’s all real.”\nDid she think he’d fall for just this money?\nNo matter what, he almost ruined his life.\nHe wanted to rebuke her, but in the end, Siwoo’s mouth didn’t open.\nIt was too much money to refuse.\n“Use it to get some good equipment. You never know when something dangerous might happen.”\n“…Understood.”\n“And I’m sorry.”\nBlushing slightly, Amelia opened her mouth rapidly like a machine gun, unable to look at the bewildered Siwoo properly.\n“From now on, I’ll be more careful. I’ve realized it was more dangerous than I thought.”\nHe wished she had realized that much earlier.\nA sigh escaped from his mouth.\n“…Yesterday, someone broke into the school.”\nAnd then the next morning.\nClaire’s words echoed through the classroom.\n…An intruder?\n“The reason is unknown. But judging by how they rummaged through a female student’s underwear, it was likely some super-powered pervert…Geez, honestly. To use one’s ability for something like that.”\nSiwoo’s mind went completely blank.\nA pervert who rummaged through a female student’s underwear?\nHis gaze turned towards Arte Iris.\nShe was smiling brightly, seeming in a good mood.\nShe turned her head and waved at me with a smile.\nDid she notice?\nNo way. No, it couldn’t be…?\n“Everyone be careful, and female students especially watch your behavior. If you see anyone suspicious, be sure to report them. Understand?”\n“Yes!”\n“Geez, what are the police even doing…”\nThe police, huh?\nSiwoo looked over at Amelia this time.\nMaybe she would know something…!\nBut his hopes were quickly dashed.\nShe also seemed confused, like she had no idea what was happening.\nSiu’s face was filled with despair.\n***\n[As expected of you, Dear Reader. Using even small incidents as material…! I have great respect for you!]\n“I’m more amazed that you forgot the setting.”\n[Ugh, ughhh…]\nYeah. I came up with a new scenario based on yesterday’s incident.\nI thought the Author would be pleased, too, so I talked about it for quite a while, but their response was quite disappointing.\n“The Secret Room? How could you forget that?”\n[Ugh, ugh… I, I’m sorry! I can forget things, too!]\n“There are some things you shouldn’t forget though?”\nDidn’t you say we’d use it as the main scenario for the academy before?\nI could only sigh at the fact that she had already forgotten that in the span of just a few incidents.\n…No, well. I should understand the Author.\nFrom Siwoo’s shocking escape to the USB loss incident.\nPlenty of events could have taken a toll on the Author’s mind.\nIt’s not strange for her to forget things…\nDefinitely…\n“Ah, come to think of it, how was the reaction to that spy storyline development?”\n[Well, it was decent. There were some reactions like ‘the protagonist’s actions seem too bland’ though.]\n“Phew, that’s a relief…”\nThe Author was writing a novel based on this world.\nHowever, since the Author couldn’t perfectly control every tiny action of the characters, they had to fill in occasional variables with their imagination.\nHowever, in the last incident, it wasn’t just one or two problems that cropped up.\nThe Author couldn’t see the 1-on-1 fight scene between Lyla and the protagonist.\nThe fight scene between the protagonist and the Minotaur was also lost due to the USB damage.\nAnd you’re asking if they could see Siwoo’s and Lyla’s initial bout?\nAre you crazy?\nWrite a novel about the protagonist abandoning the girl and running away.\nInstead of the protagonist, all the readers would run away.\nIn the end, the Author had to imagine most of the developments, with the only information being that Lyla had died.\nEven that was false information because she’s alive.\nDespite the complete mess, the Author somehow managed to salvage the situation, and thankfully, it seemed successful.\n… Author, are you actually good at writing?\nI had that thought briefly, but I quickly dismissed it.\nConsidering her usual behavior, she probably isn’t.\n[We missed the last time, but we can finally watch the main story!]\n“…The main story the Author forgot?”\n[Eek! I told you not to say anything!]\nThe fan service scene was over, and I was pondering how to continue the main story.\nThen suddenly, a classmate who touched my clothes inspired me.\n“How will Siwoo deal with the Übermensch’s infiltration? Hehe, I’ll have to watch it closely this time.”\n[A villain dispatched by the Übermensch to find the Secret Room! And the heroine and protagonist unite to solve it! Kyaa, this is a hit!]\nThe thought I had when I saw the disheveled clothes was simple.\nTo find the Secret Room, inevitably, someone would need to search the school.\n…Then wouldn’t the villain organization dispatch someone to search the school?\nThat simple thought gave birth to the appearance of the villain.\nFacing this new threat, how will Siwoo overcome this adversity?\nHe moved in the dungeon in a direction we didn’t expect.\nHow will he move this time?\nI started to feel excited.",

      "content": "“Amelia, what in the world happened?”\n“I don’t know either! I was sure no one could have seen you!”\nRight after Claire left.\nAmelia and Siwoo were trembling uncontrollably.\nThey couldn’t help it.\nAfter all, they knew who had ransacked the girls’ underwear yesterday.\nNo, they didn’t just know.\nThey were the planners and the preparators.\nThe two of them had done everything from planning to execution.\n“Where did the leak come from? CCTV? No, I definitely checked the blind spots. Was it the security guard? Or a student?”\nAmelia’s muttering reverberated in Siwoo’s ears.\n…But the content was a bit strange.\nShe had already checked the CCTV blind spots.\nJust what was Amelia aiming for?\nSiwoo’s expression gradually became gloomy.\n‘Maybe catching Arte is more beneficial for society, but catching Amelia is much simpler…’\n“Okay…Siwoo, our trail hasn’t been stepped on yet.”\n“Huh?”\n“I don’t know by what route our actions were discovered, but the culprit hasn’t been determined yet. For now, let’s pretend we don’t know anything. Got it?”\nAs the doubts in Siwoo’s mind gradually turned to certainty.\nAmelia showed him a resolute expression.\n“But we’ve already been caught…”\n“No. They know an incident occurred, but they definitely can’t be sure who did it. We’d be in jail by now  if they did.”\nIndeed.\nIt wasn’t ordinary for someone to have ransacked the girls’ underwear.\nIf they knew the culprit, it wouldn’t be strange to arrest them on the spot for suspicious intentions.\n“So from now on, we’ll pretend we don’t know anything as much as possible…”\n“You two, you look close?”\n“Kyahhh?!”\nGrab.\nSomeone approaching without a sound suddenly grabbed Amelia’s shoulder from behind.\nAmelia, whose legs went limp from the shock, saw behind her black hair.\n…Arte.\n“Hee, heeee!”\n“Oh. …Did I scare you too much? Are you okay?”\nSeeing Arte supporting Amelia caught Siwoo’s eye, but his mind went blank.\nWhy did she have to show up at this timing?\nThe two had gathered to discuss their plan going forward, so how did she suddenly appear?\nSiwoo knew she had been watching him.\nBut recently, she hadn’t directly approached him.\n‘She must know about my secret with Amelia!’\n“…Arte, what brings you here?”\n“Hm?”\n“What are you doing in a place not many people pass by…”\n“…Ah. Did I interrupt a secret rendezvous? Sorry about that. Um, I was just on my way back from the restroom. I saw a familiar face, so I thought I’d play a little prank.”\nA ridiculous lie.\nThe restrooms are in the opposite direction.\nOutright lying means she has no intention of telling us, huh?\n“Ahaha. Sorry. Seems I scared you too much.”\n“No, it’s fine. Right, Amelia?”\n“Uh, uhh. Ha, haha… I’m perfectly fine!”\nThe flustered Amelia started insisting she was fine.\nArte, who had a skeptical look for a moment, soon smiled at us and started speaking.\n“I’m glad. …Still, you should be careful. The teacher said a criminal has been wandering inside the academy lately, right?”\n“A-a criminal…?”\n“Yes. They mercilessly ransacked the girls’ underwear. How vile! They deserve divine punishment, for sure! … Don’t you agree?”\nArte’s lips curved into a smile.\n‘Is she asking for my agreement?’\nHer penetrating gaze almost made Siwoo apologize reflexively, but he held it in and agreed with her words.\n“…Y, Yeah.”\n“Ah, it would be great  if some brave student caught the culprit, wouldn’t it? Don’t you think?”\nSome brave student catching the culprit.\n…What is she hinting at?\n“It would be good  if they could catch them.”\n“Oh, Siwoo, aren’t you interested? In the vile villain who ransacked women’s underwear? You’d definitely get a big reward for catching them.”\n“…What are you trying to say?”\n“Ahaha. Well, I thought it might be fun to work with you to catch the culprit. Do you want to team up?”\n‘She’s telling me to catch myself?’\nThat doesn’t make any sense.\nJust as Siwoo was about to open his mouth to decline Arte’s offer, she took a step forward.\nSmirking, she naturally bent her waist slightly and asked him,\n“How about it? Doesn’t it sound fun?”\nNormally, it wouldn’t have been a problem.\nNo, even  if he hadn’t relieved his urges for nearly a month, he wouldn’t have had any particular thoughts.\nBut suddenly, the sensation he felt just yesterday…\nThat scent came flooding back.\n…Arte Iris’ slightly visible leotard from her bent waist awakened Siwoo’s senses.\n“Well? Doesn’t it sound fun?”\n“Uh, uhh…Yea–”\nOops.\nSiwoo realized what words had slipped out of his mouth.\nAs expected, Arte, not missing his slip-up, happily said with a smile,\n“Great! Then I’ll let you know when I’ve made a plan to find the culprit!”\nUnlike her sudden appearance, Arte turned and left with a bouncing gait.\nWatching her go, Siwoo thought,\nI’m done for.\nCome to think of it, that’s the direction of the restrooms.\nShe outright lied.\nIf she had been coming from the restrooms, she would have come from the opposite way.\n“Phew…! I thought I was gonna die. My heart hurts…”\n“Are you okay?”\n“Of course not? Wah, I was really startled.”\nOnly after Arte left did Amelia regain her senses, catching her breath and calming her pounding heart.\n“I guess she really does suspect us?”\n“Yeah. No doubt. While she can’t be sure we’re the culprits, she definitely suspects us.”\n“Whew, we expected it, but…This will be a little tough.”\nAs Amelia said, they had expected it.\nAfter all, the only one who could tell the teacher was Arte herself.\nShe must have realized somehow that someone ransacked her locker.\nThey don’t know how, but she suspects they were the culprits.\n“But why did you accept her proposal? Rejecting would have been better, no matter how I think about it.”\n“Well, that’s…”\nSiwoo couldn’t tell her that his mind was captivated by the leotard he glimpsed when she bent over, and he accepted without realizing it.\nNo amount of torture will get that out of him.\n“Well, whatever. It’s already done. No point dwelling on it further. It’s better to think about what to do going forward.”\n“What to do going forward…”\n“For starters, how about we wait to see what kind of plan Arte comes up with? There’s not much we can do right now anyway.”\nAmelia’s words made sense, so he nodded.\nNo, he would have nodded even  if she had something odd.\nSiwoo felt guilty about accepting Arte’s proposal.\n“Okay. Let’s do that.”\n“Phew, yeah. Let’s start heading back. I wonder what kind of plan she’ll come up with… I’m already getting scared.”\n***\n“Huhu. A great success, Author. Don’t you agree?”\n[Of course! The heroine and protagonist uncover the villain infiltrating the school and take them down. What an epic development!]\n“I was really nervous that Siwoo might refuse. Fortunately, it seemed like he thought about it for a bit before accepting. The advice from anime was right after all.”\nThey say guys will accept any request from a cute girl  if she does a little waist bend, so I tried it, and it worked well.\n[By the way, you mentioned having a plan. Did you have something in mind?]\n“Well, yeah. The element that would be disappointing not to show up in this situation has already appeared.”\n[…?]\nWhat?\nDid you forget again?\nI let out a small sigh.\n“…The club, the club.”\n[Club…? Ah, ah! I remember now! The Exploration Club! That’s right, that existed… Whew!]\n“…”\n[Heh, heheh…]\nI wonder what would have happened to you, Author,  if I weren’t here. The readers would probably have trashed you.\nThey probably would have gotten all kinds of insults, starting with, ‘If you’re going to introduce that setting, why don’t you use it?’ and ending with, ‘Was it a MacGuffin or what?’\nTo be honest, I am a bit worried they are still getting insulted.\nFortunately, the novel seems to be sailing smoothly judging by the Author’s current state.\n“You haven’t decided on the infiltrating villain’s ability yet, right?”\n[No, I’ve only given the setting that they infiltrated so far.]\n“How about making them a Chameleonic Adept since they’re a Wyverian?*”\n[…!]\nIt’s not like being a chameleon makes them invisible, blending perfectly into the surroundings.\nContrary to popular belief, they can’t freely camouflage themselves–they just change color based on their body temperature.\nBut novels don’t always have to strictly follow facts.\nAs long as there’s a perception of chameleons being camouflage masters, a Chameleonic Adept will always be a master of concealment.\nIt wouldn’t be strange for them to appear anywhere.\nJust the one setting of the infiltrator actually being a Chameleonic Adept can create countless scenes.\n[You’re…a god! Are you a god?! No, you must be a god!]\n“You’re going overboard again.”\n[I’ll add it to the setting right away! The infiltrating villain is a Chameleonic Adept…Ability is environmental camouflage! Done!]\n“Okay. Then let’s wait calmly.”\nWhen that Chameleonic Adept starts causing trouble again, I can approach Siwoo, acting like I had a great idea and leading him straight to the villain.\nFeeling like the development will unfold smoothly this time, I couldn’t help but smile.\nAuthor’s Notes\nSiwoo is a male.\nHe apparently had an experience that was far too stimulating.\nIt definitely won’t leave his mind for a while.",

      "content": "“You all, be careful. There have been rumors that someone broke into the dorms at night.”\n“Ugh, creepy. I bet it’s someone ugly who’s doing it.”\n“Then go apologize quickly.”\n“You–!”\nThe sound of students laughing and chattering could be heard, but Siwoo and Amelia couldn’t hear it.\nThey had just heard an unbelievable story.\nThey looked at each other with stunned expressions.\n…What?\nThere was an intruder?\n“Based on the method, it seems to be the same criminal mentioned yesterday. Everyone be careful. They’ll be caught in a few days.”\n“Okay.”\nSiwoo’s expression became complicated.\nWhen he turned his gaze towards Arte, she smiled faintly at Siwoo as expected.\nHe would have to hear about her plan after class.\nThe incident seemed to be heading differently than he had thought.\n“Wow, already the second incident! We should diligently investigate this with a detective’s eye!”\n“Detective!”\nAmelia’s eyes sparkled at the word detective.\nWhy does she like it so much?\nYou said Arte was the enemy.\n“What is this ‘plan’ you mentioned?”\n“It’s not that difficult. You haven’t forgotten the club we joined, have you?”\n“Ah, the Exploration Club.”\nArte nodded at Amelia’s words.\nShe nodded, smiling faintly, then reminded them of something they had not considered.\n“Yes. And who is the person in it with the most experience in going where others can not and seeing what others can never imagine?”\n“…The club president.”\n“You got it.”\nThat’s strange.\nSiwoo and Amelia had naturally assumed Arte had reported it.\nBut was that not the case?\nDid she have a reason to help them this much?\nSiwoo was suspicious.\n‘…Should I test her a little?’\nEven  if she notices it, he won’t die.\nBased on Arte’s behavior so far, she wouldn’t kill him.\n‘I won’t die…’\nI won’t die?\n…Probably?\nOkay, take a deep breath.\nGood.\n“Hey, Arte.”\n“Yes?”\n“The truth is, I’m the culprit.”\n“?!”\nIgnoring Amelia’s shocked reaction, Siwoo looked at Arte.\nHe wondered how she’d react.\nHis heart started pounding.\nEver since enrolling at the academy, it felt like his heart was overworked.\nShould he take some heart medication?\nArte’s reaction to his sudden coming out was unexpected.\n“Huhuhu…HAHAHAAHAHA~”\nShe started laughing for a while as  if she had just heard an amusing joke.\n“Ahahaha. Si, Siwoo being the culprit. Huhuh. That was a funny joke!”\n…Success.\nHe thought it was a 50/50 gamble, but it worked.\nArte didn’t know anything.\nRealizing this, Amelia’s expression brightened.\n“Hey, Arte.”\n“Yes?”\n“By any chance, do you know who the first victim was?”\n“Umm, probably one of the female students. I’m not sure.”\nShe really didn’t know.\nAmelia and Siwoo confirmed this and let out a sigh of relief.\n“…? Anyway, we’re meeting in the club room after school, right?”\n“Yeah, got it.”\n“Then I’ll go to class first. Take your time coming.”\nOnly after Arte’s figure disappeared into the distance could they feel their heads clear.\n“We didn’t get caught! We didn’t get caught!”\n“Yeah…! We survived!”\nWas it because we realized the victim herself didn’t know she had been victimized?\nAmelia, very excited, declared,\n“Even  if we get caught later, we’ll just pin it on that bastard!”\n“…Yeah! Let’s do that!”\n“Don’t let him talk back when we catch him, or it’ll be big trouble! Got it?!”\nNormally, Siwoo would be in a dilemma about whether or not to report Amelia to the police.\nBut he didn’t disagree with her words.\n…This time, he genuinely agreed with Amelia.\nRummaging through Arte’s underwear,\nHe really is an evil guy!\nDefinitely send him to prison.\n***\n“Huh? You want to find the hidden villain?”\n“Yes. Since you’re the president of the Exploration Club, I thought you might know something.”\n“So, so suddenly? Well, well! I am pretty great! I can definitely find them!”\nHehehe, the president laughed shyly.\n…Somehow, she reminds me of the Author.\nShe gets so happy  if you praise her a little, just like that childish Author.\n“But the teachers will look for them too, so why are you doing something so dangerous?”\n“It’s for the development of the club. Finding and arresting a villain no one else could find… isn’t that a perfect achievement for an Exploration Club?”\n“…!”\nIn an instant, the president’s enthusiasm overflowed.\nEasy.\n[Hmm, the Chameleon Adept… Where should I have him appear for the fun of the novel… Hmm.]\nSuddenly, even the Author, who is usually noisy, fell silent.\nShe’s still pondering over it.\nWhat’s so difficult about it?\nWithout my prompting, she went into quiet contemplation.\n…Hmm, I can’t voice my thoughts here with people around.\nAh.\nI have a good idea.\n“Well, considering the culprit broke into the girls’ dorms and even rummaged through their underwear, I think he must have had impure intentions.”\n“I think so too! He’s definitely a pervert…”\n[Impure intentions? Pervert…?]\nGood, she took the bait.\nIf I can’t speak directly, I’ll pretend to deduce and throw out plausible settings.\nThe Author has started paying attention to my conversation with the president.\nLet me drop some more hints…\n“Given that he’s able to go unseen despite all these people around, he probably has some kind of cloaking ability.”\n“I, I see?”\n“If a pervert is wandering around…”\n“Ah! There’s a high chance he’s in the girls’ bathroom or changing room!”\n[…! This, this is it!]\nWell, truth be told, I don’t really care  if that villain is a pervert or not.\nHe could just be an ordinary Übermensch villain with cloaking abilities.\nBut what  if the Author changes the setting?\n“I did think that, but I’m having trouble finding a way to reveal the cloaking. Do you have any good ideas?”\n“Um, hmm…”\n[Interesting! A perverted chameleon adept leering at the heroines’ nudity, and the enraged protagonist deals with him decisively! And oh my, that will make him look so cool! This works!]\nGood.\nI’ve piqued the Author’s interest!\nThe betrayal of a fellow student.\nSome kind of monster attacking the academy right from the first day of enrollment.\nI’m starting to worry about Siwoo’s mental state, having experienced various incidents right from the start of his academy life.\nBut that was the tragic fate of these kinds of protagonists.\nThe ones who kill one person and then tremble uncontrollably.\nThe ones where small things pile up until their minds suddenly snap.\nIt’s said to be normal–that being unfazed after killing someone makes you a psychopath.\nBut these days, in web novels,  if it progresses like that, they say you’re “overly indulging the sweet potato”* or something.\nI’ll pass. The Author can take that ride  if she wants.\n…But what if she writes like that?\nDreadful. I don’t even want to think about it.\nI can’t imagine what she might do if she goes off the rails.\nSo Yu Siwoo’s mind must not break.\nOnce a mind breaks, it’s hard to piece back together, so it’s best not to let it break in the first place.\nThe Author may package up developments occasionally, but that’s about it.\nSo, Siwoo’s mental state must be carefully tended to from the start to prevent it from shattering.\n“Ah, I have one idea.”\n“What is it?”\n“This is a detector that senses ambient mana. Seniors in the club made it before to find hidden passages and such.”\n[Heh, hehe. I’ve grown… Devising settings to this degree is like eating cold porridge…!]**\nI was amazed at the Author’s tremendous speed.\nHer pace is really fast.\nShe came up with the detector to reveal the cloaking in just the brief moment I didn’t speak?\nIt didn’t even seem like a minute had passed, and she’d thrown in a detector to expose the cloaking.\nI was almost moved to tears by the Author’s growth.\nOur girl really delivers when she puts in the effort.\n“Then  if we use that to approach wherever the culprit is…”\n“Yeah, we can easily find them!”\nSiwoo and Amelia seemed very excited.\nYes, I suppose the protagonist and heroine would be happy to capture the villain with their own hands.\n“Well, but how do we find them?”\n“That’s easy! When swimming class ends, we catch the pervert who came to peep!”\n“But everyone will be suspicious if we bring weapons to a pool.”\n“…Ugh!”\nI could subdue them with my threads, but I didn’t mention that.\nI can’t overshadow the protagonist again.\n“Looks like Siwoo has to solve this!”\n“Me?!”\n“Yes. The heroic Siwoo ambushes the culprit found by the detector! Doesn’t that sound cool?”\n“But, but I…”\nHuh?\nSiwoo seemed about to object but suddenly closed his mouth.\n… What’s wrong? Was he going to say he can’t go into the girls’ changing room because he’s a guy?\nWell, whatever.\nIf he doesn’t object, that’s fine with me.\nNo need to persuade him, which is actually more convenient.\n“Then let’s do that! President, can I borrow this detector for a bit?”\n“Of course! You can use the Exploration Club’s Special Detector as much as you want! … It’s specially made by the club!”\n“Yes, I know.”\nI mostly tuned out the president, repeatedly mentioning that it was made by the club and trying to elevate its status.\nOkay, this should be enough.\nBut what to do about Siwoo’s mental health…\nI got it.\nLet me show a fan service scene for the ages using Amelia!\nTeenage boys tend to get silly thoughts in their heads when they see a pretty girl’s naked body.\nI know from experience.\nI’m unsure  if it will help ease the shock of his first kill, but it’s better than nothing, right?\nBesides, Amelia is the heroine.\nShe’ll probably take good care of him.\nBeing cuddled by the soft heroine’s bosom might help improve things a bit.\nHe needs to stay unfazed even after killing someone.\nHopefully, he’s the type who doesn’t get fazed by small things.\n____________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nIt’s just too hot these days.\nOn scorching days like this, the worst thing an adult can do,\nIs to eat lots of that 5L tub of vanilla ice cream meant for businesses!",

      "content": "“Will they really come?”\nA few days later, after the second swimming lesson.\nAmelia was looking around anxiously.\nShe had a doubtful expression, wondering  if a villain would really appear.\n“Don’t worry. It will definitely happen.”\n“Oh, really…?”\nWell, it can’t not happen.\nThe Author said they would be here.\n[The fan service scene and the protagonist’s agony at once…! He, hehe.]\nLook at that.\nShe’s already anticipating what kind of scene will unfold.\nThe idea that there won’t be a villain here is simply impossible.\n“There’s no reaction yet.”\nShe tapped the detector in her hand.\nIt was called a detector, but it was just a round orb that could fit in one hand.\nIt didn’t look like one at all.\nOut of curiosity about whether it could detect mana, she had tried using her abilities from quite a distance.\nThe result was a great success.\nIt rang extremely loudly.\nWhen we asked the president about its sensitivity,\n“It was made by students, so don’t expect the best,”\nI guess there’s a reason they could find secret passages within the school but not the Secret Room.\nNo, why was she so realistic in the most unnecessary places?\nCould it be the Author…?\nThis plot line would’ve been for naught  if the performance were too good.\nNo, did the Author really think that far ahead?\nI’m not sure. I should just go with the flow.\n“By the way, aren’t you worried?”\n“…Huh? About what?”\n“No, I mean showing your body to the guys. Siwoo and that villain.”\nAh.\n“I’m not worried.”\n“Why?”\n“… It’s a secret.”\nThere’s no way I can tell her.\nWhy would a guy feel embarrassed showing his body to another guy?\nIt’s not like I’m openly exposing myself like last time.\nI’m not completely naked, either.\nI’m wearing a leotard.\nBut my current appearance is that of a female.\nIt was obvious Amelia wouldn’t understand  if I said something like that.\nIn times like these, it’s best to change the target.\n“What about you, Amelia?”\n“Huh? …Me?”\n“Yes. Setting me aside, you must feel some resistance to it, right?”\nIt may be fine for me since I was originally a guy, but she’s a girl.\nSurely, the Author wouldn’t make her a trans heroine.\n“I don’t care either.”\n“…?”\n“It’s for the sake of catching the culprit.”\n[Ooh. A model heroine.]\nThe Author and I were amazed by her determination.\nI guess this is what makes her the heroine.\nEnduring her embarrassment to take the lead in catching the villain, keep it up.\nBEEP BEEP BEEP! BEEP BEEP BEEP!\n“That is…!”\n“Aha. It seems they’ve arrived.”\nThe other students have long left the changing room.\nIt loudly rang in the empty room.\n… It’s really too much. It hurts my ears.\nDo they just leave this lying around?\nAt least they didn’t throw it away.\nIt was certainly effective.\nEven  if I tried to ignore it, it forcefully pierced my eardrums with its sound.\nUpon hearing that noise, Siwoo came in from the boys’ changing room.\n“The culprit! Where is the culprit…?!”\n…What perfect timing.\nHe turned red and hurriedly looked away.\nHis bright red ears hinted at why the protagonist turned away so hastily.\nAren’t you a bit too weak against the female form?\nAmelia may have a nice figure, but for his face to turn red just from looking at her?\nAs the protagonist of an academy novel, he should be used to the sight since he’ll be chasing girls.\n“Well, they’re definitely here. Want to try finding it?”\n“Me?!”\n“Yes. Use that intuition of yours.”\n“B-but my ability only activates when I’m attacked.”\nRight.\nI expected him to say that.\nBut isn’t it about time his abilities grew a little?\nThis is already the third incident, after all.\nThe monster attack, the spy infiltration, and now this.\nAnd that’s not to mention fan service and class parts.\nNot powering up the protagonist may lead to the readers getting bored.\nNo, maybe it’s already too late.\n“Shouldn’t your ability be able to detect crisis?”\n“…Huh?”\n“There must be a reason it’s called ‘Intuition,’ right? Come on, focus. Look around you.”\n[…! Protagonist power-up event!]\nThat’s right.\nThe protagonist is about to give up, unable to find the culprit.\nBut with some guidance, he was able to improve his ability.\nA classic awakening event.\nThere’s no need for detailed guidance.\nThe Author will fill in the rest.\n[…Huh?]\n“Is there some kind of problem…?”\nI didn’t direct that question to anyone in particular.\nSiwoo had his eyes closed, sweating profusely, while the Author seemed perplexed, letting out a confused voice.\n[What…The ability…? Huh?]\n“…?”\nWhat’s wrong, why did you trail off?\nWhat happened to his ability?\nHow can I ask the Author about it without making it too obvious?\nYou’re really leaving me curious here.\nBut that thought didn’t last long.\nSiwoo suddenly opened his eyes and swung his sword through the air.\n“…Over there!”\nCLANG!\nA sword swung at air should continue moving until stopped by the wielder or the surroundings.\nBut  if it stops in an empty spot?\n…And even makes a sound like metal clashing against metal?\nIn this situation, the implication was not difficult to grasp.\nThe protagonist had found the villain.\n“How…! My concealment was perfect! I removed my scent! Visual detection should have been impossible!”\nThe utterly flustered villain cried out loudly.\nHe seemed quite disconcerted, understandably so.\nHe had infiltrated the impenetrable academy and caused havoc within,\nOnly to be discovered by a student.\n“Ahaha. We didn’t find you through sight or smell.”\n“Impossible!”\nSiwoo’s ability is rather lackluster for a protagonist.\nIt’s not flashy, can’t enhance his body momentarily, nor can it produce explosive firepower.\nHowever, his ability grows more valuable the more it develops.\nTouch, taste, sight, hearing, smell.\nIn addition to the five human senses, he has one more.\nIntuition.\nA sixth sense that allows him to feel things ordinary people cannot perceive.\nEven  if he can’t see with his eyes, smell scents, touch physically, taste, or hear, he can still sense something present.\nIf it grows sufficiently, it may become a premonition ability of sorts.\nIt must seem like a nightmare to villains.\nNo matter how they attack or ambush, he sees through it and evades.\nAn unassuming yet terrifying power.\n…And that power has now grown stronger.\nAbilities that deceive the human five senses are useless against Siwoo’s intuition.\n“Kuh…! Damn!”\nUtterly vexed, the villain instantly concealed himself from sight.\n…Wow, I really can’t see him.\nIs he still in that spot? Or has he already moved while invisible?\nAs I marveled at his unseen form, Siwoo acted again.\n“Kuhok?!”\n“…I may not see you, but I know where you are. Hiding is futile.”\n[Kuhuh…! So cool! Say more cool stuff!]\nAgh, seriously.\nShe’s ruining the vibe here.\nIt felt like watching a movie with someone loudly commenting on what they think.\n“Yes, the great power of the Übermensch, bested by a mere brat like you…!”\n“…Übermensch?”\n[Ah. Now that they mention it, I forgot to briefly inform the protagonist about them…]\n…Come to think of it, I forgot too!\nLyla didn’t actually refer to the organization by name, did she?\nShe didn’t say it was the work of the Übermensch.\n“That form… Are you a chameleon?”\n“Yes, this is the great power the Übermensch has bestowed upon me. Interested?”\n“No, I’ve just seen a similar appearance before. Hers was a wolf, though.”\nPhew…\nThankfully, Siwoo is smart.\nHe must’ve recalled Lyla’s animal transformation, making the connection.\n“A wolf…? Ah, yes, the newcomer they mentioned. The one that died carrying out a mission at the academy, I heard…Did you kill her?”\n“…”\n“…Though I haven’t seen it myself, I cannot allow the one who killed an inheritor of our great power to live.”\nPfft.\nAh, wait a sec.\nI almost laughed there.\nWhen he said “inheritor,” it reminded me of that contrived setting I shoehorned in.\nWhat was it again?\nSomething about their ancestors mating with werewolves?\nThat made Lyla being a lycanthrope even funnier.\nUgh, I can’t laugh. This is an important scene right now.\nI somehow managed to stifle my laughter and continued watching the fight.\n“Die…!”\nThe villain instantly vanished and reappeared behind Siwoo’s back.\nWow, fast.\n…Is he planning to cut him from behind?\nJust in case, I prepared to fire the threads I had ready.\nIt would be bad  if he got injured.\nBut there was no need to intervene.\nWithout even looking back, Siwoo spun and kicked the villain’s side with his foot.\nSuperhumans are certainly stronger than ordinary humans.\nBut no matter how superhuman, they are not invincible.\nBeing kicked with that much mana infused, even they would sustain a fatal injury.\nWow, I think that ruptured his internal organs…?\n“Kuhack?!”\n“I told you, old man.”\nWhile the villain knelt clutching his side in agony, Siwoo calmly rested his sword against his neck.\n“Even  if I can’t see you, I know where you are.  No matter how fast you move, I can see exactly where you’ll go.”\nThe Author excitedly rapid-fired comments at me like a machine gun.\nAh, damn.\nSo noisy.\nAuthor’s Note:\nI resisted the urge to fully unveil Arte’s abilities\nSiwoo needs to get a chance to shine, too…\nNot yet…the time…is not right!",

      "content": "“…Ah, indeed. I understand why the rookie died.”\nThe chameleon villain sighed as  if giving up.\n“Kill me. I lost.”\n“…”\nWhat’s this?\nWhy don’t you kill him already?\nSiwoo pointed his sword at the villain’s neck, not beheading him.\n“Aren’t you going to kill me?”\n“Uh…”\n[Ah, that’s it.]\nThe Author let out a small exclamation as  if enlightened.\nI also realized why the protagonist was acting that way.\nSigh.\nSiwoo was hesitating to kill someone.\n“What? Are you hesitating to kill someone? Did you really kill the rookie?”\n“I won’t kill you.”\n“…Why?”\n“Because I need to hear information about that Übermensch you talked about.”\nIt was an excuse.\nThe Author, Siwoo, Amelia, and even the chameleon villain himself realized it.\n“I’ve been trained to endure torture. It’s a waste of time.”\n“No, there must be a way to get the information without killing you.”\n“…”\nThe villain’s mouth closed as  if refusing to say anything more.\nHmm, what to do.\nIt’s not trendy for the protagonist to be so averse to killing these days.\nA kill is only natural at this time.\nAh, right.\nThat would be better.\n“Wha…What?!”\n“… Don’t try anything! You can’t move in that state! Surrender!”\nI manipulated part of the wire I had laid down to bind the chameleon villain and forcibly stand his body up.\nIt was a wire so thin it was practically invisible.\nSiwoo would have noticed it normally, but this was far from it.\nHis mind was probably preoccupied with other thoughts.\nAs expected, he didn’t notice the wire descending silently from the ceiling.\nHmm, he’s still inexperienced. He’ll need to notice things like that eventually.\nHe should be able to dodge attacks even while sleeping. Hmm.\n“Kh…?!”\nThe chameleon villain seemed flustered, understandably so.\nOf course, he’d be flustered  if his body moved without him controlling it.\nNo matter how much he tried to move his body, the tightly bound wires wouldn’t let him.\nHe must have thought a ghost possessed him or something.\n“St-Stop! You can’t win like this…!”\nSiwoo was taken aback when the villain suddenly switched to recklessly attacking without regard for his safety.\nRight, he probably thought the villain couldn’t move at all, so this must be startling.\nTheir body couldn’t actually move alone.\nJudging by his side turning red, his internal organs must have ruptured or something.\nIt must hurt a lot…probably.\nNot that I would know how that felt.\nKang! Kang!\n“Ugh…!”\nThe battle resumed.\nThe difference from before was that it was no longer a surprise attack but an outright struggle.\nHowever, Siwoo couldn’t easily subdue the villain.\nEven when opportunities to attack opened up, he didn’t take them.\nHe could have easily won by striking.\n…He still won’t strike? Even now?\nThe villain’s throat, heart, and bleeding side were open for attack, but Siwoo still hesitated.\nDoes he think one hit would be fatal?\nWell, it probably would be.\n“You’ll really die at this rate!”\nIt was no use speaking to him.\nIf he told Siwoo that he was being controlled, it would be a big problem, so I sealed his mouth.\nAh, but this is kind of fun.\nIt feels like I’m playing a game.\nTake this! Deadly horizontal slash!\n…Missed.\n“Ugh, heh…!”\n“Wh-What is this…?!”\nAfter a while, I got bored of manipulating the body this way and that.\nIt was fun at first, but then it got monotonous.\nThe attacks were all blocked as expected, and Siwoo showed no sign of finishing it.\nBoring.\nShould I wrap this up?\nWe’ve fought enough, I think.\nI manipulated the wires to make the puppet’s body move even more violently.\nSiwoo had no choice but to defend as the villain relentlessly swung his sword without letting up.\nHis reluctance to kill was impressive, but perhaps he was trying to find an opening to knock the villain out.\nBut that won’t do.\nA web novel protagonist must boldly smash through all obstacles.\nThey can’t be held back by trivialities like this.\nI made the villain slash diagonally with his sword.\nSiwoo would naturally swing his own sword to block, right?\nGood, just as expected.\nIn that situation, what would happen  if I forcibly bent his arm to change the trajectory?\n“…?!”\nOf course, the obvious result.\nSiwoo seemed to notice it too, but it was already too late.\nThe villain’s attack trajectory had been forcibly changed into an impossible angle.\nThe unaltered horizontal slash severed the puppet’s neck.\n“He… He’s dead…?!”\nYes, dead.\nDefinitely.\nIsn’t it stranger to be alive  if the head was separated from the body?\nUgh, gross.\nI looked at Amelia behind Siwoo’s dazed expression.\nGood, now it’s time for the heroine to soothe him with her warm, compassionate heart.\n“…Huff, huff.”\nHuh?!\nAmelia’s face had gone pale seeing the corpse, barely able to stand.\n.\nYou’re not supposed to react like that!\nWhy are you mentally breaking down too?!\nOh no, this is bad. I thought Amelia’s bold personality would be unfazed!\nThe protagonist is just staring blankly–someone needs to comfort him right now.\nAmelia…! Pull yourself together!\nBut my mental plea didn’t reach her.\nHer ability isn’t telepathy, after all.\nDamn it. I can’t help it then.\nI lightly felt my own chest.\n…This is pretty sizeable, right?\n“Don’t worry, Siwoo.”\n“…Arte.”\n“It was just an unavoidable accident. Amelia and I were watching the whole time.”\n“B-But…!”\nAah, he’s so chatty.\n“?!”\nFeeling too awkward to embrace him from the front, I hugged him from behind instead.\nAh, life.\nI wouldn’t have had to do this  if only Amelia was mentally sound…\nMy face felt hot and flushed.\nUgh.\n…This should be enough, right?\n“Everything will be alright. It’s not your fault.”\n“…”\n“He threw his own body away–you did nothing wrong.”\nSiwoo’s trembling gradually subsided.\nDid he calm down?…He did calm down, right?\nGood. Success.\nHis aversion to killing should have lessened now.\nThe first time is always the hardest.\nOnce you cross that line, it gets easier.\n“What’s going on here? Such a commotion…?! Are you all alright?!”\nAh, the instructor finally came.\nWith such noise, it would be weird  if the instructors didn’t come.\nGood timing, at least.\nI smiled wryly as the instructor hurriedly tried to control the situation.\n[That was fun…! A perfect scene!]\nThe Author seemed delighted too.\nA great success.\n***\n“…”\nSiwoo clenched his fist.\n…He still felt the sensation.\nThe feeling of piercing flesh.\nThe odd feeling of easily cutting through, only to hit an obstruction–probably bone.\nA chill ran down his spine.\nHe had only intended to silence him.\nIf, by some tiny chance, the villain told her he didn’t actually search her underwear,\nThen, he would no longer be able to push the blame onto him.\nThat’s why he wanted to restrain him quickly.\n“…It was a success.”\nYes.\nIt was a success.\nHe can no longer refute the claim.\nBecause he’s dead.\nBut Siwoo felt conflicted.\nHe certainly deserved to die after invading the academy and being part of the same traitorous organization as Lyla.\nThe villain didn’t expect to survive after being defeated.\nThat’s probably why he goaded Siwoo to kill him too.\nHowever, there was still a possibility he could have lived.\nIn the end, I’m the one who took his life.\n“Phew…”\nSiwoo lay on the bed, blankly staring at the ceiling.\nThankfully, the gloomy thoughts didn’t last long.\nWhenever those thoughts crept in, the next scene flashed through his mind.\n“No, don’t think about it…”\nHe shook his head repeatedly, but it had no effect.\nThe more he tried not to think about it, the more it occupied his mind.\nThe soft sensation of her gently pressing against him came flooding back.\n“…Ugh!”\nThump!\nHe banged his head against the wall, hoping to erase the memory.\n…But it had little effect. Being superhuman, it barely even hurt.\nA wave of self-loathing washed over him.\nTo dwell on the feeling of a woman’s chest after killing someone.\nWasn’t that downright depraved behavior?\nYet whenever the sensation of blood on my hands returned, that whispering voice gently settled in his ear.\n“It wasn’t my fault…”\nWhat’s her goal?\nAt first, he thought she wanted to kill him, but that was a misunderstanding.\nWhy was she observing him like this?\nDid she just want to watch for observation’s sake?\nShe knew of the monster attack and the Secret Room.\n‘But what did that have to do with watching me?’\nHe couldn’t make sense of it at all.\n“I don’t know!”\nSiwoo decided not to think too hard about the difficult things.\nThere was no way to know for sure right now anyway.\nDwelling on it would just plunge him back into self-loathing.\n“…I can’t sleep.”\nBut as always, plans never go as intended.\nSiwoo couldn’t sleep, the sensation of her hand on the back of his head and her dizzying scent lingering in his mind.",

      "content": "“Phew…!”\nCrack!\nThe fixed sandbag broke apart, spilling its contents.\nTsk.\nNeed to replace it.\nLooking around, damaged and broken training equipment was strewn about.\nShe felt sorry for the servants as she rang the bell.\nDing, ding.\nIt didn’t take long for the white-haired old man to arrive after the bell rang.\n“You called, Miss?”\n“Ah, Granny. Sorry, but could you clean this up?”\n“Understood.”\nHer mood didn’t improve.\nShe couldn’t forget that incident.\nShe was frustrated that she couldn’t fight just because she didn’t have a weapon.\nShe could only leave everything to Siwoo and watch.\nShe was frustrated that she couldn’t comfort her friend, trembling after killing someone.\nWhy couldn’t she?\nShe was scared.\nJust because it was the first time she saw a corpse.\nFor such a trivial reason.\nCrack! Crack! Crack!\nShe repeatedly struck out in frustration, one, two, three, four times, accelerating as she used her ability.\nIt didn’t take long for the last remaining sandbag to be devastatingly torn apart, spilling sand everywhere.\nSeeing that reminded her of the villain collapsing while spewing blood, making her even more frustrated.\nAmelia was no longer shocked by seeing a corpse for the first time.\n…But the frustration of being unable to help her friend didn’t subside.\nWhat a pathetic girl.\nShe said she could do anything to achieve her goal, but she gave up on helping a friend.\nThat’s why she’s a piece of trash who is all talk.\n“…Ah, my hand hurts badly.”\nWhen she looked down, blood was dripping onto the floor.\nShe had only noticed it now.\n“Miss, use this.”\n“Thanks, Granny.”\nShe roughly applied the ointment and wrapped a bandage around her hand.\nIt’s a high-performance medicine, so it should heal by tomorrow morning.\n“Miss, did something bad happen? You seem to be venting your frustrations lately.”\n…She couldn’t tell him.\nGranny cares for me a lot.\nBut he’d raise a huge fuss if she told him she met a villain at the academy.\nNothing good would come of that.\nShe’ll have to be vague about it.\n“No, it’s nothing….Just something frustrating happened.”\n“I see. Please let me know if you have any worries. I may be able to help.”\nHelp.\nCome to think of it, neither she nor Siwoo had ever asked anyone for help.\nThat’s because they were afraid of Arte.\nThey couldn’t risk being labeled villains just for accusations without any evidence.\nBut if she asked for advice without revealing Arte’s identity?\n…What could go wrong?\n“Actually, Granny…”\n“Yes, Miss?”\n“I have something I want to ask.”\n“Please go ahead.”\nAmelia looked at the butler, who had watched over her since childhood, with a serious expression.\n…Maybe he would know.\nThe answer to the dilemma she was facing right now.\nWhy Arte is so interested in Siwoo?\n“It’s not about me, but about my friend.”\n“I see.”\n“… She’s acting a bit strange.”\n“In what way, Miss?”\nUm…\nIn what way is she acting strange?\nShe couldn’t mention the important events. Just strange things in daily life.\nNo matter how much she thought about it, she couldn’t find the right words to explain her suspicions.\n‘What should I say?’\nFortunately, Granny waited patiently for her.\n…Ah, got it. Let’s try saying it this way.\n“She’s unusually interested in a certain male student.”\n“A male student, you say?”\n“Yes.”\nGranny suddenly started fixing his posture.\nWhat’s up?\nIt looked like he was smirking, too.\nOr was that her imagination?\n“Ahem, ahem. Pardon me….So? Please continue.”\n“Oh, right.”\n… It’s probably nothing.\nAmelia decided to brush it off.\n“That friend seems to be looking at this guy named Siwoo with an unusual amount of attention.”\n“Hmm, Siwoo… Ah, you mean the student Siwoo in the same class, right?”\n“Yeah, and–wait, how did you know that, Granny?”\n“There are ways to find out anything.”\nThe same old line again.\nWell, Amelia didn’t really care.\nHe probably just did a background check or something.\nEver since she was little, he’s checked out all the boys around me.\n‘I guess old habits die hard.’\n…Thinking about background checks suddenly reminded me of what Jeffrey said.\nIf anyone even tries to look up her information once, they’ll sense something off.\nSurely he didn’t look up Arte too, did he?\nA chill ran down her spine.\n“…Do you know Arte Iris?”\n“Arte Iris? A girl in the same class? I haven’t looked her up, but shall I?”\n“No, don’t bother. I already looked into her.”\n“I see. Understood.”\nAmelia let out a relieved sigh.\nLooks like he didn’t look into her, thankfully.\nIt’s better if he doesn’t know.\nJeffrey was wary of her for a reason.\nHe’s an information broker. He’s sensitive to even the potential of threats.\nNo matter how powerful her family is, she can’t just bring someone Jeffrey was so wary of into her home.\n“Anyway! That friend seems to be paying an excessive amount of attention to this guy Siwoo.”\n“…Excessive, you say?”\nAh.\nNow that she thought about it, she did say ‘friend’ but then mentioned Arte’s name.\nWas that too obvious?\nShe quickly glanced at Granny’s expression, but he didn’t seem suspicious, just intrigued.\nDidn’t notice?\nThat’s a relief.\n“Yeah. She keeps looking at him during classes, too.”\n“I see…”\n“And after school, she follows him around whenever she can.”\n“I understand. Anything else?”\n“Else? …Um, ah. She even joined the same club as him. And they were on the same exam group, too, I think?”\n“…!”\n“Plus, she doesn’t seem interested in their other classmates. Her attention is only on him.”\nAfter hearing the whole story, Granny teared up.\nGranny is acting a bit strange today.\nWhat part of this made him want to cry?\n“I see. Well, Miss, it seems you’ve finally reached that stage…”\n“…Whatever misunderstanding you have, this is about my friend.”\n“Yes, yes. Your friend. I understand.”\n…Did he really understand?\nIt’s getting annoying.\nBut she’s the one asking right now, so she should be patient.\n“But I don’t understand the reason….Do you know, Granny?”\n“?! You mean you didn’t realize?!”\n“What, what? Why are you so surprised? Did I do something wrong?”\n“Wrong…no, not at all. Ahem, my apologies. I was just momentarily surprised.”\nWhy was he clearing his throat like an announcer before making a big announcement?\nWith an unnecessarily solemn face, Granny spoke to her in a serious tone.\n“Allow me to explain. The reason your… friend’s gaze is fixed on that young man is…!”\nWhat Granny said next surprised me.\nIt…makes sense!\nEven those who have lived long have something special about them. Is this what they call experience?\n“Thank you, Granny!”\n“No need to thank me.”\nAmelia felt better.\nWith this, she could help Siwoo!\n…The feeling of solving his problem melted away the guilt she felt earlier.\n***\n“Siwoo. Come here quickly. It’s urgent.”\n“Huh, okay?!”\nSiwoo was flustered.\nHe had been worried about Amelia, who had seemed gloomy these past few days after that incident.\nShe seemed to be in a bad mood ever since going through that experience.\nBut today, her energy seemed higher than usual.\nShe looked happier somehow.\nDid she finally get over it?\nSiwoo didn’t refuse Amelia’s guiding hand and followed her into the secluded alley where they usually talked.\n“…So, what’s the sudden urgency?”\n“What urgency?”\n“Well, we only talk here when…”\nIt was only when discussing countermeasures against Arte.\nSiwoo was about to say that but closed his mouth. Since Amelia had also recently suffered a mental shock, he should be considerate…\n“I know. Don’t worry about it.”\n“…Are you okay?”\n“With what?”\nHe asked her urgently, but she just looked puzzled about what the problem was.\nShe must have completely gotten over it.\nHe respected her for that.\nIn Amelia’s situation, he probably would have holed up in his room for days.\n…Just recalling that memory–her touch and scent–helped forcibly stop the gloomy feelings from overwhelming him.\nMaybe he could say he’s indifferent to it now?\nShe overcame it all by herself without any of that.\n“…Well, okay. Today’s discussion is about why she’s been watching you.”\n“What?!”\nSiwoo was caught off guard by what Amelia said.\nHer reason…!\nHer goal was to steal the artifact hidden inside the Secret Room somewhere in the academy.\nNo matter how he thought about it, the reason she was watching him had no connection to that at all.\nDid she figure that out?\nSiwoo was amazed.\n“You, you found that out…?!”\n“Yeah. Granny helped me out.”\n“…Granny?”\n“My butler. Don’t worry. I hid the fact that it was about Arte well.”\nUm, was that so?\n…He felt a bit uneasy, but now wasn’t the time to worry about that.\nHe could finally learn why Arte was watching him.\n“So, so what’s the reason?”\n“It’s…”\nIt’s?\nBa-dump, ba-dump.\nHis heart was pounding.\nThe secret he thought he could never unravel about why Arte was watching him was about to be revealed.\n“Love.”\n“…What?”\nWithout realizing it, Siwoo ended up asking Amelia to repeat herself.\nAuthor’s Note:\nYou all saw it, right…?!\nA beautiful fan art arrived!\nKyaaah, it’s so pretty!!!!\nK007 drew it for us!\nAnd you saw this too, right…?!\nThe cover artwork is complete!\nHOMY drew it for us!\nSo beautiful!",

      "content": "“No, that doesn’t make any sense. Love?”\nLove? What is that?\nSiwoo did not think at all that it was love.\n“But that’s what Granny said?”\nWho was this Granny to tell Amelia such a ridiculous story?\nNo, putting aside the fact that she said it,\nWhy did Amelia believe it?\nIt doesn’t make sense.\n“That can’t be. Arte is a villain!”\n“Siwoo, think about it. Why does Arte keep watching over you?”\n“That’s what I’m trying to figure out by doing this!”\n“Right. That’s where it all starts!”\nClick.\nAmelia glared at him like a detective would a culprit.\n…Siwoo couldn’t understand what she was saying at all.\n“Listen. At first, I thought it was ridiculous to say too.”\n“It will always be ridiculous.”\n“No, no! Siwoo, calm down and think about it.”\nWhew…\nRight, let’s calm down.\nAlthough Amelia brought up this nonsensical story, she must have had a reason for saying it.\nAs he caught his breath, Amelia started asking his questions.\n“Arte is watching over you, right?”\n“… That’s right.”\n“She even follows you, right?”\n“Yes.”\n“See! That’s love!”\n“Where?!”\nNo, so much for staying calm!\nHe couldn’t stay calm at all.\nThat Arte loves me?!\nThump, thump.\nHe could hear his heart pounding loudly in his ears.\nThink about it from the perspective of someone being watched!\n“Well, think about it. Arte is very interested in you. That’s for sure, right?”\n“That’s right. But that alone is not enough for it to be love. That’s just surveillance!”\n“She even joined your club to follow you. And she took swordsmanship classes to be with you, right?”\n“… That’s surveillance too!”\n“She has no interest in other students and keeps watching you during class?”\nHe couldn’t understand where she was going with it.\nThose are obviously just actions needed to watch over him, no?\nAfter he passionately explained this fact to Amelia, she pointed out something he had never thought of.\n“Of course, it could be surveillance, but Siwoo, are you someone worth watching?”\n“…?”\n“You’re just a bit better than other students, that’s all. Why would she watch over you?”\n“There is a reason! It’s because she had to cover up the monster incident!”\n“If she noticed that, she could have just killed you easily as she did Lyla.”\nHe was speechless.\nNo words of rebuttal came to mind.\nHe wanted to, but his mouth was sealed shut, and he couldn’t make a sound.\n“You know, the Arte we’ve seen so far is no ordinary person. If you or I were exposed, she would…kill us on the spot.”\nAmelia made a slashing gesture across her throat with her thumb.\nYes, Siwoo knew that.\nShe can infiltrate the academy, raid it with monsters,\nAnd she killed Lyla so easily.\nSomeone like her definitely has no qualms about killing people.\nThe actions they’ve noticed are a small part of everything she’s done.\nArte is dangerous.\nIf she sets her mind to it, it wouldn’t be strange for her to kill them.\nThat’s why he couldn’t stop the tears after miraculously escaping the changing room incident where he thought he would definitely die if exposed.\n“She…chose to watch me?”\n“That’s right! There’s no need for her to watch over someone like you!”\nSomeone like you.\n…Siwoo wanted to refute it, but he had nothing to say.\nHe completely agreed that someone of her caliber had no reason to watch over someone like him.\n“Then why does she keep watching me…?”\n“I told you! It’s love, love!”\nIn the end, it came back to this.\nCircling back to the story Amelia was claiming all along.\n“The reason she watches you? Because you’re attractive!…I don’t know about that. But I  guess your face is somewhat decent.”\n“Hey?!”\n“The reason she follows you all the way to your house? That’s because she loves you! She fell for you at first sight!”\nHe was confused.\nUntil now, he naturally thought Arte was watching him, but now Amelia’s saying that might not be the case.\n…Not surveillance?\n“Her joining the swordsmanship class to follow you, joining the club to be with you, all of it! … It’s because she loves you!”\nSuddenly, Siwoo remembered that day.\nThat villain who infiltrated the academy, whose name he didn’t even know.\nAlthough he seemed more animal-like than human, he was human.\nWhen he first cut a person and felt that sensation send shivers down his spine, what did she do?\n‘Don’t worry, Siwoo.’\n‘It was just an unavoidable accident. Amelia and I were watching the whole time.’\n‘Everything will be alright. It’s not your fault.’\n‘You did nothing wrong.’\nThat gentle touch came back to him,\nThat gentle voice\n“…She comforted me.”\n“Hm?”\n“Back then. The Chameleon villain.”\n“Ah, ah…”\nOops.\nSiwoo realized he had misspoken.\nAfter that incident, she had lost her usual confident demeanor for a while.\nHe thought she had finally regained it, but he carelessly brought up that story again.\nWhile Siwoo was worried she would lose her energy again, contrary to my expectations, Amelia spoke firmly.\n“I’m sorry!”\n“…Huh?”\n“I said I wouldn’t hesitate to use any means for my goal, but look at me now. I need to reflect. Hmm.”\n“Are you…okay?”\n“Of course. Who do you think I am?”\nFortunately, it seemed she had gotten over that incident completely.\nShe was her usual self again.\n“Hmm, hmm. Anyway! As you said, Arte comforted you when you fell into despair. …You know what that means, don’t you?”\n“No way. It couldn’t be…”\nHe tried to deny Amelia’s words, but unlike before, his voice had no conviction.\n…Really? Is that right?\nThe memory of Arte’s bright, smiling face came to mind.\nDid she notice my voice wavering?\nAmelia grinned confidently and declared.\n“Arte is watching over you, following you everywhere; it’s all because of love!”\n…Is that so?\nSiwoo came to accept her words.\nThey say men are prone to delusions.\nIf a woman is kind to them, they might fantasize that she’s interested in them.\nBut this is…\nThis isn’t a delusion, is it…?\nIt’s Amelia, of all people.\nShe knows Arte’s true identity along with him, and as a fellow woman, she’s confidently saying\nArte has feelings for me.\nAnd she’s saying it so assertively.\nThere was also some logic and evidence behind it.\n…Is it true?\n“The reason she keeps watching over someone like you who isn’t even worth watching? It can only be love. She fell for you at first sight.”\n“Is, is that so…?”\n“Of course! Granny said so, too!”\nHe still didn’t know who this Granny was that Amelia mentioned, but Siwoo fell for her words.\nIt sounded so plausible.\n“Arte just, um, doesn’t know how to express her love properly!”\n“Seems a lot more than not knowing…”\n“Ah, just take it as it is!”\nHe meekly tried to refute but was instantly shot down.\nHow unfair.\n“So now we have one more way to stop her.”\n“What method is that?”\n“A very time-honored method.”\nSlowly, Amelia approached Siwoo and placed her hand on his shoulder.\nAnd then, she suddenly leaned her face in close…?!\nAs he flinched back in surprise, her smiling face proudly said,\n“You have to seduce Arte.”\n“…Me?”\n“A time-honored method. The Art of Seduction, it’s quite famous, you know?”\nSiwoo thought that perhaps Amelia regaining her usual self might not have been a good thing after all.\nMaybe it was better when she was depressed.\n“I have to seduce Arte?”\n“Yes. Isn’t it easy? Just seduce Arte and stop her! Love cannot be stopped!”\n“It seems extremely difficult.”\n“Don’t worry. I’ll help you.”\nAs suddenly as she had moved closer, Amelia backed off with a sly smile.\nHer blue-green eyes shone brightly as if she had fully regained her energy.\n“Don’t hesitate to use any means to reach your goal…. Isn’t that a good saying? It’s the same this time.”\nA good saying…?\nLeaving aside all the other famous quotes, that’s what she calls a good saying?\n“The goal is to stop Arte. So then, you don’t need to hesitate about the means, right? If she comes to care about you more than the ‘Author,’ she’ll listen to you!”\nAmelia grinned confidently.\n“Use any trick you can to make Arte love you more!”\nSiwoo wished she would choose her words better.\n***\n“…Wow, they seem close.”\n[Right? It’s nice to see the heroine and protagonist together!]\nThey often meet over there.\nDo they like meeting in that alley?\nI observed their secret rendezvous while enjoying bread and coffee bought from a cafe.\n[Kyaa, kyaa! That, that, that. Isn’t that a kiss?!]\n“Hmm, it’s a bit ambiguous to call it a kiss… Didn’t she just lean her face in?”\n[Heeing… Too bad.]\nI overheard the Author making cooing noises.\nBy the way, Amelia’s expression hasn’t been good lately.\nBut it brightened up as soon as she met Siwoo.\nIs this the protagonist…?\nProtagonists really are all skilled at dealing with women, huh?\n“How peaceful.”\n[Right. Umm, I should start thinking of a new event soon.]\n“…I have a good idea for you.”\nAs usual, I shared an idea with the Author.\nHer excited voice told me the idea was right up her alley.\n“…Mmm, tasty.”\nIt’s quite good this time. Maybe I’ll drop by again next time.\nAs I finished the bread in my hand, I observed the secret rendezvous of the protagonist and heroine.\nHow peaceful.\nAuthor’s Notes\nThe Art of Seduction apparently belongs to the thirty-first of the  Thirty-Six Stratagems.\nTranslator’s Corner\nThe beauty trap (Honeypot) (美人計, Měi rén jì)\nSend the enemy beautiful women to cause discord within his camp. This strategy can work on three levels. First, the ruler becomes so enamored with the beauty that he neglects his duties and allows his vigilance to wane. Second, the group of men will begin to have issues if the desired women court another man, thus creating conflict and aggressive behavior. Third, other females at court, motivated by jealousy and envy, begin to plot subversions that further exacerbate the situation.\nThat one is off Wikipedia. The Art of War is such a thoroughly analyzed text that it isn’t going to get much more concise than that.",

      "content": "“Okay, let me explain the plan.”\nAmelia declared confidently.\nHer self-assured manner was nice to see, but it made Siwoo uneasy.\n…Is she coming up with some weird plan again?\nAmelia’s plans always made him anxious.\n“It’s not weird, is it?”\n“What are you saying! Just listen, and don’t be surprised.”\nHer assertiveness only made him more anxious.\nWhat is she up to?\n“A date!”\n“Huh?”\n“I mean, a date! When a guy and a girl go out and have fun!”\nHe was surprised.\nIt was a much more ordinary situation than he expected.\nWell, a date may be casual, but it’s still daunting.\n“…Where? No, how in the first place?”\nThere was a major obstacle to her plan.\nFirst, there was no reason for them to date.\nIf, by some chance, she had feelings for him,\nAnd if, really giving her the absolute benefit of the doubt, that was the reason for Arte’s actions,\nEven if that was truly the case, there was no relation between them.\nThey had no particular relationship….At least on the surface.\nThey were just classmates and club members, nothing more.\nThey’ve never really talked before.\nHe’d just get rejected if he suddenly asked her out on a date.\n“Don’t worry. We have the club, right?”\n“…The club?”\n“Remember, the president said last time that since we won an award, they allowed us to take an outing.”\nSiwoo’s head started pounding.\nOutdoor activity?\nHe didn’t recall the president ever mentioning that.\n…No, he was pretty sure she didn’t.\nSomething seemed off.\nThe club only has four members, and he would have remembered if she said something like that.\nShe never mentioned anything like that, did she…?\n“When we go on that outdoor activity as the club, that’s when we’ll pair you up with Arte!”\n“…Amelia. Did the president really say that?”\n“You have a bad memory, don’t you? You were there too. We caught the Chameleon Villain and got a big reward, remember? Don’t you remember?”\n‘Did we?’\nWell, there have been a lot of incidents lately.\nMaybe he just forgot from being tired.\nSiwoo decided not to worry about it.\n***\n“Ehehe. I’m so happy.”\n“You seem very pleased.”\n“Of course! Look at this award!”\nThe president proudly held up the award certificate.\nIt was an award certificate stating that as students of the academy, they had brilliantly defeated a villain who had infiltrated the academy.\nIt was an award for the Exploration Club.\n“They even gave us a generous budget…! I’m so happy! You guys are the best!”\n“I’m glad you’re happy.”\nI smiled faintly at the president.\nWe were supposed to get an award, but the reward was supposed to be much smaller than this.\n“This is all thanks to you guys…! Thanks to you, we can go on a trip and raise the club’s status!”\n“I’m glad you’re enjoying this. Even if it’s just the four of us, shall we go and have fun?”\n“Yes! This is why underclassmen are worth keeping around!”\nOf course, the outdoor activity has to align with the club’s purpose.\nThe Exploration Club is literally a club for exploring, so…\nIf we claim going camping is an exploration, that’s what it is.\nThat’s why Siwoo and Amelia are also excited about it.\n“I’m looking forward to it.”\n“Yeah, it’ll be fun!”\nYes, it will be fun.\nFor the nameless readers watching the Author’s writing, that is.\n[Thump, thump…! A new event is starting!]\nYes.\nThe start of a new event.\nClaiming to be an academy novel, yet going outside?\nThere are usually two possibilities in such cases.\nEither chasing after the enemy or being chased by them.\nOf course, our protagonist and heroine duo have yet to identify the true enemy.\nThey only know that Lyla belonged to the Übermensch organization, and the villain hiding in the academy was also a member.\nSo what will the outcome be?\nWell, what else? An ambush, obviously.\n“I’m looking forward to whatever fun event awaits us.”\n“Hmm, it isn’t summer yet, maybe not the beach? How about the mountains?”\n“The mountains sound fun!”\n“Hmm, or maybe not…? What about a scenic area?”\n“Haha, that also sounds enjoyable.”\nWhen the president asked where we wanted to go, I responded that anywhere was fine.\nShe couldn’t decide where to go anyway.\nThe one who decides is the Author.\nNot these puppets.\n“Heh, heheh. Heh~”\nAs the president hummed a little tune, pondering where to go, the Author spoke up.\n[Let’s save the beach for a summer event… Okay, I’ve decided! Into the unkempt mountains we go!]\n“Ack, pricey….Alright, let’s go here.”\nWe all gathered around to look at the location the president had pulled up on her computer screen.\nThe mountains.\n“An area untouched by human hands, perfect for camping! They say there used to be a dungeon there too!”\nLook at that.\nIn the end, they couldn’t choose for themselves.\nIn this world, only the Author and I have free will.\nThe rest are just puppets bound by the strings of fate.\nWhen the Author switches up the strings, they act according to their destiny.\n“This will be fun.”\n“The mountains seem a bit… Won’t there be bugs and such…?”\n“But there’s nowhere else suitable for just the four of us to go. The scenic areas were too expensive to enter. Want to see?”\nWhen Amelia expressed concerns about the mountains, the president showed the exorbitant entrance fees for the scenic areas.\nThey were quite pricey.\nEven with the generous reward for defeating the villain, it wouldn’t be enough for all four of them to enter.\nNo matter how generous the reward, the entrance fees are per person.\nOf course, the Author could have adjusted the reward amount to allow entry if she wanted.\nBut she wanted the mountains.\nSo, the scenic area fees ended up being that expensive.\nI’m not quite sure what a “scenic area” is. Probably just some setting the Author included.\n…Well, the name alone gives a general idea.\n“But if I chip in…”\n“We can’t use personal funds for a club activity!”\n“Eek!”\nIs that really a given?\nI glanced at the others but couldn’t confirm whether it was true.\nWell, it doesn’t really matter.\nThe Author can make it so if it’s not a given.\n“So, our destination for the outdoor activity is here! Got it?”\n“…Yes.”\n“This will be fun. We’ll have to bring lots of meat and seafood!”\nWho knows.\nI doubt we’ll get to actually eat any of that.\nA mess is clearly inevitable.\n[Heh, meat…Seafood…I want to eat it.]\n…If the Author wants to live vicariously, I suppose we can eat whatever she wants.\n***\n“Ah, Lyla. You’re early.”\n“…Yeah, I guess.”\nShe tensed her body with anxiety.\nLast time, it was a simple mission, but what about this time?\nCould she end up dying this time?\n“I have another request for you.”\n“What is it…?”\n“This mountain here.”\nShe trembled momentarily as she looked at the map Arte had given her.\n…This is where the Übermensch’s hideout is located.\nShe was told to flee there if anything happened.\n“I plan to have Lyla and her former colleagues enjoy themselves there.”\n“I see…?”\n“Yes. Since there will be quite a few people, I’m asking you to keep things under control.”\n“Con…trol?”\nControl?\n…Control what, exactly?\nDespite her fear, curiosity welled within, and she asked without thinking.\nHer stiffened ears and tail plainly showed her tension.\n‘Damn. These emotions show too easily.’\nFortunately, Arte didn’t seem to pay much attention to it, answering nonchalantly.\nThe content may have been casual,\n“Ah, that’s… So civilians don’t accidentally wander in, you know?”\n“…Why is that?”\n“Because if they come in… Ufufufu. Nothing good will happen.”\nThis woman is insane.\nShe’s not in her right mind.\nShe trailed off, but Lyla understood what she wanted to say.\nIf anyone wanders in and more bodies pile up, it will be a hassle, so preemptively control the area.\nDamn it.\nShe resented her past self.\nTo think she got entangled with such a dangerous person out of petty insecurity.\nShe had lost her mind.\n“…Ah. That’s right. I said I would give you a reward.”\nHer ears perked up for a different reason than before.\n…A reward?\nNow that she mentions it, she did say something like that.\nArte said she’d give her a reward for buying a swimsuit, but after she bought it, there was no further mention, so she assumed she was just talking nonsense and let it go.\n“Well, I wasn’t satisfied with the swimsuit you gave me…But that was my fault for not specifying properly.”\nShe started mumbling to herself in the air.\n…Here we go again. That “Author” of hers.\nShe had no idea who she was referring to, but it’s probably best if she doesn’t find out.\nShe decided to feign ignorance.\n‘The most precious thing is my life.’\nSurvival is paramount.\nLyla only realized this truth after experiencing the fear of death.\n“Here, take this.”\n“What is this…?”\n“Something good for the body.”\nWhat she handed was some reddish-brown substance.\nIts ominous color made Lyla recoil.\n“…What is this?”\n“Eat it. It will make you stronger.”\nFor a moment, Lyla wanted to throw away the object in her hand, but she managed to restrain herself through sheer patience.\nAnother drug.\nThe cause of the purple wolf ears and tail on her head.\n…Is she giving this to me knowing she hated drugs now?\nNo, surely not.\nThere’s no way.\n“…What if I don’t eat it?”\n“If you don’t want to, I don’t mind.”\nArte gave a faint smile.\n…It sent chills down her spine.\nIt was an offer she couldn’t refuse.\n“However, if you don’t take it and end up dying, I won’t take responsibility.”\n“… I’ll hold onto it for now.”\n“Yes. That’s wise. It takes effect instantly, so you’ll grow stronger the moment you ingest it.”\nNonsense.\nPotions are not that type of drug.\nIt takes time for the body to metabolize them.\nThat’s why it took a while after taking the potion for the wolf’s ears and tail to appear.\n“Ah, and make sure you don’t forget to take care of my request.”\n“…Got it.”\n“Good. I’ll be counting on you.”\nAfter Arte left with those words, it took Lyla a while to truly realize she was gone before letting out a deep sigh.\n“I’m going crazy…”\nLyla looked up at the sky.\nThe beautifully shining crescent moon filled her vision.\nDisgustingly pretty.\nShe never understood why people craved cigarettes so much.\nBut for the first time, she wanted to try.",

      "content": "“Ooh, here we are!”\nThe president tilted her head up, full of excitement.\nLike an excited puppy seeing a large toy, her appearance made me chuckle.\n“Wow, amazing.”\n“Yeah, it’s pretty.”\nAmelia and Siwoo exclaimed as they looked at the mountain.\nIt is pretty.\nBack in the original world, I rarely looked at the scenery since I was always on the computer or staring at my phone in my room.\nAn untouched landscape by humans is more beautiful than I thought.\nWell, saying it’s untouched by humans is a lie itself.\nA branch of Übermensch was hidden there.\n[This will be fun! I’m really looking forward to it!]\n“I’m really looking forward to it too.\n”\n“Yeah! I’m excited!”\nI suppose even academy students are still students?\nEveryone seemed excited about the possibility of enjoying themselves at the lodge instead of attending classes at the academy.\nEspecially Amelia and Siwoo.\nThose two have been sticking together since earlier.\nI wonder what they’re doing?\n“Amelia?”\n“Hieek?! Oh, yeah. What is it, Arte?”\n“No, I was just wondering what you two were doing.”\n“Uh, nothing! Sorry, I’ll move away in a bit!”\nThey looked so happy together that I was feeling warm inside.\nBut when I spoke to Amelia, she jumped in surprise, creating distance between them.\nAh, I see.\nShe’s embarrassed!\n“You don’t need to apologize.”\nRather, I should be the one apologizing.\nI guess it’s because I’ve never been in a relationship before.\nI didn’t pick up on the pink hue.\nThey were having a nice time when I suddenly butted in and made them flustered.\nI’ve seen scenes like that a lot in light novels.\nJust as the male and female leads are about to kiss, someone rudely interrupts, and they pull apart in embarrassment.\nI remember getting so angry at the clueless one ruining that moment.\nBut now I was in that same clueless position.\nI can’t help but feel apologetic.\nThe president had already run off excitedly ahead of us.\nI saw Amelia and Siwoo whispering to each other again.\nHmm, since no one’s watching, it should be fine.\nI slightly moved the thread inside my choker.\n“Keck?!”\n“Oops, my bad. Are you okay?”\n“Keck, koff. I’m, I’m fine.”\nHmm, I still haven’t gotten used to it. I should practice using it more.\nThe Author gave me the ability to control the threads of any  clothing I perceive as  clothing, as long as I’m wearing it.\nAlthough I’ve practiced enough to use it naturally, like moving my limbs, applying it is still difficult.\nNot that the applications are anything special.\nI can control the threads until the mana in them runs out.\nFor example, if I load them up with plenty of mana, I can manipulate  clothes whose threads I’ve preloaded.\nI tried making many thread balls once, but the Author stopped me.\nShe gave me a penalty instead of letting me make the ability too strong, saying it would be cheating if I removed the penalty.\nClaimed it would make me no different from the protagonist.\nThat’s the only time she’s stern.\nAnyway, that’s why preloaded threads are difficult to handle.\nIf I pull too hard, Lyla ends up gasping for air like a dog on a leash.\nHer head could have rolled right off if I messed up the force.\nI need to be more careful.\nMaybe I’ll practice and try again later.\n“Lyla, do you remember my request.”\n“…Right away.”\nShe disappeared after giving her a smile, seemingly understanding what I meant.\nAlright, I’ve blocked out the main variables now.\nIt’s time to finally hear the story I’ve been dying for.\n“Author, isn’t it time you told me now?”\n[Heh, heheh. Yes, I suppose I can tell you now.]\nFinally, I’ve been dying to know.\nThe Author was so tight-lipped, refusing to tell me no matter how much I asked, saying she had an amazing setting in mind!\nI wonder how much she’s grown.\nI hope it’s a good setting.\n[You see, the Übermensch are modeled after animals, right?]\n“Yes?”\nOf course, the setting is about transcending humanity by implanting animal traits.\n[So I thought the executives should be famous animals!]\nThe Author stated it as if it were some grand revelation when it was just the obvious.\nIf she said the executive of the Übermensch had the Pygmy Hog trait implanted, what would readers think?\nThey’d be like, “What the hell is a Pygmy Hog, you weirdo?”\nBut if it’s a famous animal, it’s much easier to understand.\n“The Übermensch executive has the Tiger trait implanted!”\nIt’s way easier to grasp without explanation and sounds powerful.\nNo, wait, I shouldn’t jump to conclusions yet. The Author hasn’t finished speaking!\nBut I believe in the Author!\n[But it felt a bit lacking just using famous ones, so I thought, why not make them symbolic too?]\n“Oh, symbolic ones, nice.”\nI held back my urge to express joy.\nRight, our Author just lacks experience.\nShe can definitely pull it off.\n[Right?! So I decided to take them from the Chinese Zodiac since there are twelve executives total!]\n“Huh?”\nChhrrrsshh.\nIt was like dousing the wildfire burning in my heart with cold water.\nWhat did she just say?\nThe Chinese Zodiac? Twelve executives?\n[The Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig! Heheh, so many motifs!]\nAh.\nThe Author’s voice, giggling about the abundance of motifs, rang in my ears.\nDidn’t I just say to hear people out until the end?\nThis is why I didn’t.\nShe hasn’t grown at all.\n“Um, Author. Have you already set this in stone?”\n[Hm? Yes, I have.]\nI somehow managed to swallow the profanities that almost spilled from my mouth.\nStay calm, Arte Iris\n.\nAuthor is an idiot.\nAuthor is a massive idiot!\nI have to endure if I don’t want to die!\n“Do you know how long it would take to introduce all twelve of them?”\n[Huh?]\n“Even if we introduce three per episode, that’s still four spent just on that.”\n[Huh?!]\n“And if we introduce three immediately, won’t it lack tension when we reveal the next three?”\n[…]\n“And if we start with one or two but then dump a bunch later, there will be power inflation issues and whatnot. Can you really handle all that?”\nI waited for a while.\nNo response, huh.\nPatiently waiting for the Author’s rebuttal, she meekly countered in a dragging voice.\n[Well, we don’t have to introduce all twelve, right?]\n“So you won’t introduce all the executives of the main antagonistic force?”\n[Hiii…]\nThis is ridiculous.\nHow do I even salvage this?\n“Author, what if we just get rid of them all?”\n[I could for one or two…but all of them is a bit…]\nAlright, fine.\nSince the Author says she can’t get rid of them, I’ll have to accept the setting she’s locked in.\nI cooled the heat that had risen to my head.\nPressing the Author further would be pointless.\nDoing that could lead to the world’s destruction.\n“Then how many are at this lodge?”\n[Well, each executive has 200 subordinates…]\n“200? By the way, how many new students enrolled at the academy this year?”\n[300.]\nI didn’t even have the energy left to get angry.\nIf each executive has 200 subordinates, and assuming the other executives have similar numbers without much deviation, that’s 2,400 in total for 12 executives.\nEven if all the academy students became villains right after graduating, it would still take 8 years?\nThis is a setting error.\nBut there’s nothing I can do about it. As much as I really dislike it, I have no choice.\n“Author, can you prepare just one school uniform for me?”\n[Huh? A school uniform?]\n“Yes. I have a feeling I’ll need one.”\nI needed a safeguard in case I had to go all out.\nThis is broad daylight we’re talking about.\nUsing my ability recklessly would be insane.\nEven if I used it at night, I could confidently declare I wouldn’t be in my right mind.\nFortunately, this is in the mountains, a place untouched by human hands besides the Übermensch.\nAs long as my fellow club members don’t find out, it should be fine to let these people who are going to die anyway get an eyeful.\nThe dead don’t talk, after all.\n“If I kill them all, it’ll be okay, right?”\n[R-Really?]\n“Yes. We’ll find some way to fix it.”\nBut there were still too many villains…\nHmm, we can say they were villains who fled from overseas and settled here.\nTheir numbers dwindled from infighting at first, but for some reason, they merged instead.\nThe result was the ballooned number of members in Übermensch.\nThis contrived setting is the best I can do.\nIt’s really forced, but how else could we reasonably explain 2,400 people?\n“Phew, it’s going to be a busy evening.”\nI can’t kill all 201, including the executive.\nI need to leave a decent number to ambush Siwoo’s group later.\nMaybe around 15 would be enough?\nIt’s not ‘Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves’; it’s ‘Arte and the 2,412 Beasts’.\nWay too many.\nAt this point, shouldn’t I be called an editor instead of a reader?\nThat thought crossed my mind.\nAuthor’s Notes\nHehehe…\nMommy Arte~\nI’m dead (actual death)\nAnd, for those who dislike controversial subjects, I’ll give one final notice. Truly, the last time, I won’t give any more notice.\nI’m tired, too; my fingers hurt from typing so much.\nIt’s not no-romance.\n*censored by the translator cause spoilers.*\nI think that’s explanation enough, right?",

      "content": "The person next to me yawned deeply.\n“What’s wrong, are you sleepy?”\n“Ah, no!”\nThe new recruit answered loudly, seemingly flustered.\nWho taught this kid manners?\n“Hey, keep your voice down. This is a secret base.”\n“Y-yes, sir…”\nI couldn’t help but laugh, seeing the new recruit quickly shut his mouth.\nI was like that once, too.\n“Don’t worry too much. No one comes through here. It’s a travel spot but not a popular one, and it’s far off the beaten path. There are even ‘Private Property’ signs up. Who would come to a place like this?”\n“I-I see…”\n“That’s right. So don’t worry and just focus on keeping watch.”\nUgh, being on watch duty is the worst!\nI purposely shouted that out and plopped down onto the grassy field to put the junior at ease.\nI even had to look out for the newbies now.\nLife is so unfair.\nBack in my day, the seniors beat manners into us.\n“Thank you, senior.”\n“Huh? For what?”\n“I didn’t think I’d get used to places like this. You’ve helped me a lot.”\n“What are you on about? We’re just small-time villains anyway.”\n“Still, thank you.”\nGeez.\nWhat drove a guy like him to become a villain?\nSome people want to live honest lives, but their circumstances won’t allow it.\nSeeing naive guys like him made me feel conflicted sometimes.\nHow hard their lives must have been to end up on this path?\n‘Life really pisses me off.’\nThat’s when something black approached us.\n“I really think you’re amazing, senior…”\n“Quiet, newbie. We’ve got a situation here.”\n“Huh?”\n“Over there, you see? It’s a person. Get ready.”\n“Oh, you’re right.”\nSo much for being at ease.\nHe’s just standing there stunned instead of preparing.\nExasperated, I patted his back.\nOnly then did he hurriedly grab his weapon.\nI held back a sigh. He’s still just a rookie.\nI checked out the approaching figure.\n…A woman, huh?\nDid she get lost?\nHer smiling face looked ominously creepy.\n“This is private property. Please leave.”\n“Ohoho, is that so?”\n“Yes. I don’t know how you ended up here, but I can guide you back if you’re lost.”\nI politely offered while scanning her.\nNo weapons…\nNo visible injuries…\nFrom her uniform, she must be a student of the academy.\nMaybe she came out for some field activity and got lost.\nTch, what a nuisance.\nIf I kill her here, it will just cause more trouble.\nEspecially being an academy student.\nAn investigation could expose this location if she’s filed as a missing person.\nI should probably respond appropriately and send her away…\n“No, I came here on purpose. To the Übermensch’s playground.”\n“…?!”\n“I almost came too late. I’m glad I found it in time.”\nI swung my sword to attack the woman.\nShe dodged the attack as if she expected it, but he didn’t care.\nAn academy student woman.\nFor her to come to this place alone knowing the organization’s name?\nThere’s no way.\nOur hideout has been exposed.\n“Hey, newbie! Sound the emergency alar–ughh?!”\n“That won’t do. If someone tries to escape, it’ll upset Lyla. She decided only fifteen can survive.”\nWhat, when did…?!\nShe was definitely unarmed!\nBut my throat was now deeply cut and bleeding profusely.\nThe floating blood droplets were the only indication I had been attacked.\n…Wait, blood droplets?\n“You have good eyes. But it’s too late now.”\nInstinctively, he clutched his throat, but it was of no use.\nThe blood was already gushing out rapidly.\nMy head was getting dizzy, and my vision blurred, likely from blood loss.\n‘…Damn it, I let my guard down assuming she was unarmed…’\nThis is it.\nIt was wire, thin as thread, that cut my throat.\nShe didn’t attack.\nThere was no movement from her.\nShe must have set up the wires along the path I took, anticipating it.\n“Ugh…The academy’s…top student…?”\n“Well, there’s no need to tell someone about to die, is there?”\n“What’s your…goal?! How did Übermensch…get exposed…!”\nIt was hopeless to survive.\nWith this level of bleeding, I’d likely be dead in less than ten minutes.\n“Spare…him…”\nThen, at least, I had to save the newbie.\nSpeaking through the gash in his throat was agonizing, but he forced the words out.\nI had to buy time somehow.\nThat naive kid couldn’t die here.\nIf I could stall, maybe he’d come to his senses and wash his hands of this…\n“Oh, the person lying over there?”\n“…What?”\n“Over there. I made it quick so they didn’t have to suffer.”\nThe newbie was lying in the field.\nIt was like how he was sprawled out earlier.\nExcept now he was covered in a red blanket, the ground as his bed.\n…Haha, hey, kid.\nLying down like that is going to be uncomfortable, you know?\nYou’ll get a stiff neck sleeping like that.\n“Well, I’ll be going then. Enjoy your remaining time.”\nStep by step.\nThe crimson demon walked away.\nMy vision blurred.\nMy head spun.\nSomehow, I dragged himself over and collapsed next to the newbie.\n“Ha…hey, newbie. I kind of figured this might happen someday, but not to you.”\nNo answer came back.\nDamn it, my vision is fading out.\nWhere do you get off falling asleep when your senior is still awake?\nBack in my day, we’d get beaten all day for that kind of thing.\n“Newbie…life really pisses me off, you know?”\nAgain, no response.\nAnd I could no longer continue either.\nThe strings of the two puppets were cut.\n***\n“Intruder! Emergency! Emergency! What are you all doing?! Stop them quickly!”\n“What were those on lookout duty doing?!”\n“You idiot! They’re probably already dead! If you have time to blame others, fight back!”\n…Ah, so noisy.\nThey’re all just trash.\nInstead of attacking, they raise their voices when caught off guard by methods they can’t comprehend.\nNo wonder fifteen won’t be enough.\nAmelia and Siwoo are the protagonists, the hero and heroine.\nThese trashy guys would get wiped out even if a hundred were sent.\nNo, wait, these guys.\nAre they even Übermensch?\nWhy are they holding guns?\n“Gugh?!”\n“Th-threads! She uses threads! Drop the guns and cut the threads with blades! Quickly!”\nSomeone’s voice rang out.\n…Took long enough.\nI was wondering how long it would take for them to notice.\nTheir level really is too low.\nFifteen definitely won’t be enough. I’ll need thirty at least.\nAt that voice, they discarded their guns and started wildly swinging their blades.\nMost didn’t manage to cut the mana-infused threads, but I could feel some snap through my fingertips.\n…Oh.\nThere are a few decent ones, at least.\n“Well, I’ll let you through then.”\n“What are you–?!”\nIn an instant, their uniforms burst apart as thread after thread infused with mana spread out, grazing the villains’ bodies.\nThe result was, well.\nA resounding success…?\n“Heh, hiiick…?!”\n“Ah, I didn’t expect that… Ugh, disgusting.”\nNo, I guess not a success.\nMore of a failure, really.\nDozens of villains were diced up, their bodies shredded into pieces.\n…Too cruel, maybe.\nAlright, that one is safe.\nI might throw up my lunch just by looking at it.\nThe stench is nauseating, and the visuals are unpleasant too.\nWith all that spilled blood, it leaves a bad taste as well.\n…Better not use that one.\nThankfully, the people I marked didn’t die.\nIt paid off that I went easy on them.\n…Ah, I regret it now.\nI should have spared that man keeping watch.\nSince it was our first meeting, I thought they were all around that level.\nWho knew it would take them this long to even notice the threads?\nIf I had known, I would have added him to the survivor list.\n“D-demon…!”\n“Well…calling me a demon is rather rude. Won’t you call me a human instead?”\nHow rude.\nI’m no monster.\nCompared to ones like you killing people for your own selfish desires, at least.\nIf the Author hadn’t created you, I wouldn’t have to go around killing like this either.\nDon’t make me feel so disgusted.\n“Let’s see, thirteen… Thirty might be too much. Hey, how many are left?”\n“Like I’d tell you, you demon!”\nI’ll have to make do.\nNo helping it, I’ll send them on ahead.\nI used the gloves on both hands to give the remaining people a gift.\n“Now, we’ll be playing a game of tag.”\n“Just kill us instead! We won’t follow your–“\n“Be quiet. I’m speaking.”\nAh.\nWhy do they only listen when I get angry?\nCan’t we just do this smoothly?\nMy mood is ruined now.\n“Shall I explain the game of tag again?”\n“Ugh…”\n“It’s simple! You all will ambush the students at the cabin on the mountain slope!”\n“Ambush students, you say…?”\n“Kill even one of them, and I’ll let you live.”\nI dangled a carrot to lure them, as they seemed too frightened.\nAh, as expected.\nTheir trashy gazes turned even trashier at my words.\nLooks like their motivation is back.\nGo get the protagonists’ group with that energy.\nBeat them down to an inch of their lives.\nThat would be ideal.\n“Now hurry along. Or else, who knows what will happen?”\n“Heh, hiick?!”\n…Even so, running away trembling like that hurts my feelings.\nIs my face really that scary?\nBut it definitely looked pretty when I checked the mirror earlier…\n“Well then, shall I see what the twelfth executive looks like?”\nThere are twelve of them, right?\nI wonder which creature they’ll be.\nAuthor’s Notes\nI found out today that I ranked 3rd in the weekly popular novels and got the editor’s pick!\nIt’s clear everyone loves the yandere protagonist.",

Of course!”\n“Damn it…!”\nI couldn’t take my eyes off the horror in the CCTV footage.\nI was planning to spend some time relaxing and having fun at the hideout, but it was all ruined because of that insane woman.\nI never even worried that someone might find out about us.\nNo, the moment I sensed we’d been discovered, I could have immediately fled.\nI was confident in my ability to run and hide.\nThat’s the only skill that allowed me to rise to the rank of executive in Ubermenschen.\n…Alright, I admit the hideout’s location was risky.\nBut it was an unavoidable choice to feed and shelter so many people.\nThis was the best option to provide for all those mouths.\nAn abandoned dungeon site that most people avoided.\nThe outermost corner of that area.\nI even deceived the public by claiming it was private property to prevent anyone from accidentally wandering in.\nThere’s no way someone could have stumbled in by chance.\nThey definitely had a clear objective for coming here.\nBut how could I have failed to notice?\nIf she had sensed even the slightest clue about this place’s location, there’s no way I would have missed it.\nWhat happened?\n“Oh, she’s moving at an insane speed! At this rate, she’ll be here any second!”\n“That insane…!”\nA chill ran down my spine.\nAmong the executives, I’m the weakest. Not surprising, since I specialize in hiding and fleeing.\nBut an executive is still an executive.\nA level incomparable to the grunts, or so I had prided myself.\nYet I didn’t think I could defeat that woman.\nThe way she instantly turned dozens into cubed steaks without a shred of hesitation or remorse… sent shivers down my spine.\nFor an academy student to commit such atrocities while wearing that uniform?\nNo matter how much they say student defections have become a social issue, there’s no way a human like that could exist at the academy.\nShe’s not an academy student. She’s a villain.\n“Did some other villain organization infiltrate the academy with her…? Tch, run! Everyone get ready; we’re out of time!”\n“That might be difficult for them.”\n“What’s so difficult! Just do as I…say…”\nWait a minute.\n…That voice just now wasn’t one of my underlings, was it?\n“It’s a pleasure to meet you. You must be the one in charge here.”\n“…!”\nClang!\n“Haha, how passionate. I like that. Your drive is impressive. As expected of an executive. You pass.”\nThis insane bitch didn’t even flinch!\nIt was meant to be a sneak attack.\nThe dagger I always keep on me for emergencies.\nI poured my mana into it and threw it.\nThe intruder was completely off guard.\nHer relaxed demeanor. The carelessness of not even looking at my hand.\nEvery sign pointed to this being the perfect ambush.\n…But in the blink of an eye, the dagger shattered.\nAnd the moment I realized the ambush had failed and tried to flee without looking back, I saw her clothes flare with mana.\n“Damn it! Attack incoming! Everyone, brace–!”\nBut by the time I realized that it was already too late.\nIn an instant, threads had unraveled and wrapped around the necks of my men and myself.\nThat wasn’t some indiscriminate massacre…!\nDamn it. I was too tense after seeing her cube people so brutally…!\n“Don’t move. You might get hurt.”\n“M-Marmo! Ugh, you bitch!”\n“Ah, I said don’t move.”\nCrunch.\nThe sickening sound of flesh tearing and bone crunching echoed hauntingly.\nHa, haha…\nWhat the hell was that?\nThat guy was definitely an enhanced physical ability user, right?\nI remember him.\nHe usually took point on missions.\nThe guy who wouldn’t get more than a scratch even if mauled by a monster.\nYet he died that easily to her?\nThe threads around his neck tightened in an instant, and with a single twitch, his neck twisted with that horrific sound.\nI don’t need to check to know.\nHe’s dead. Killed by that woman’s hand.\nCleanly, without the slightest hesitation.\nAs casually as a butcher slaughtering a pig in an abattoir, she ended a life.\n“Well, I did tell you not to move. It’s dangerous, you know.”\nA chill ran down my spine.\nAnyone who witnessed that scene would feel the same way.\nOf course, watching a person’s neck being violently ripped apart like that…\nNo matter how villainous, it’s rare to find someone so utterly remorseless about taking a life.\nShe’s completely insane.\nThe way she doesn’t even see us as human beings.\nEven hardened villains who have been through everything couldn’t fathom resisting her now.\nLife is precious, after all.\nGoing against someone who doesn’t view you as human is just pointlessly inviting death.\nNow, none of us besides that woman can move freely.\nHer threads are wrapped around all of our necks here!\nCold sweat trickled down my neck, sliding onto the thread.\nThe sensation was unnervingly soft, like caressing a baby’s delicate skin.\nDisgustingly smooth.\nIt felt like touching fine silk, but I couldn’t enjoy the experience.\nNormally, I would have taunted and mocked her lewd body.\nBut it was impossible now.\nThe image of my subordinate instantly becoming a cold corpse flashed in my mind.\nThis woman is clearly threatening us.\nShe could kill us at any moment, but by keeping us alive,\nShe’s silently pressuring us to obey her or die.\n“…What do you want?”\n“Ahaha. What I want, you ask?”\n“Cut the crap. You could kill us instantly, but you’re keeping us alive, so spill it. What are the conditions?”\nHer mocking laughter was infuriating.\nDamn it.\nI’ve got the worst luck.\n“The same as those who left earlier? Attack and kill the students, and I’ll let you live. How about it?”\n“…I don’t have a choice to refuse, do I? Fine.”\n“Good. I’m glad we can communicate! Now hurry and go!”\n“…Tch. Let’s go, everyone. The mountain cabin. Our target is three academy students we spotted earlier.”\n“Yes, sir! You got it!”\nI heard four academy students were coming here.\nFour my ass.\nThere was a demon among them.\nShit, the academy is so damn incompetent.\nWith the taxes I pay, they can’t even filter out one dangerous bitch like her?\n“M-Marmo. Maybe we should flee while we still can…”\n“No, it’s impossible. We’re trapped too cleverly.”\nOf course, I had considered fleeing.\nShe was already far enough away that I couldn’t see her anymore.\nBut it was impossible.\n“Remember what that woman looked like?”\n“Wh-what? She’s…I can’t seem to recall…?!”\nThat’s how it is.\nIt’s not like I’m some amnesiac.\nThat bitch who weaponized her own outfit was meticulous.\n…Her face, I can’t remember it.\nWhen she was right before me, I could clearly recall her appearance.\nBut when I closed my eyes to picture it again, it was like a fog clouded my mind–I couldn’t visualize her face.\nAll I remember is some woman in a leotard.\nWhere did she even get an artifact like that?\nAbility users are limited to one power each.\nIf her power is manipulating threads, then her face should be visible.\nThat must be why she didn’t use a hoodie.\nIt was an artifact.\n“The threads around our necks won’t come off either, so it’s too dangerous. For now, we have to follow her demands.”\n“Kuh, damn it…”\n“Don’t worry. You know me well.”\n“Yes, sir! We’re counting on you, Marmo!”\n“That’s right.”\nI suppressed the rising irritation.\nHow can I break free from that insane woman’s clutches?\nMarmo’s mind raced to come up with a solution.\n***\n“Well, it turned out better than I expected!”\n[R-Really? Hehehe.]\n“Yeah. I thought I’d be in more trouble when you said you made 200 of them. What is there to worry about if they were only like that?”\n[W-Well…you seemed really upset, so…]\nAhahaha.\nWhy would I be upset?\nOur Author made sure to account for the plausibility of having 2,400 villains.\n“I was wondering why they had guns, but I see you snuck in that extra setting.”\nThat’s right.\nThose weaklings who didn’t even notice the threads.\nI realized they had guns because the Author discreetly added another setting somewhere along the way.\n“Hmm, the goal of making humanity superhuman was a nice Ubermenschen touch…You said the reasoning behind it was good?”\n[Yes, yes. But no more spoilers! Even if it’s you, Reader, I can’t share everything!]\n“It’s okay. I can accept that.”\nRight.\nIt made sense why so many villains thought they could become superhumans with that setting.\nThe goal of making all of humanity superhuman?\nOf course, it’s an extremely cliche premise.\nOne I’ve consumed and digested so much that I know the taste without trying it.\nBut cliches are cliches for a reason.\nReaders prefer the guaranteed flavors they already know.\nIf you try cooking up something too new, you could end up with a mint-chocolate pineapple pizza disaster instead of the familiar kimchi stew everyone craves.\nPeople are daring enough to try those experiments, but the masses prefer reliable, proven tastes.\nThat’s why classic cliches like kimchi stew remain popular staples.\nOf course, if you only feed them kimchi stew, they’ll eventually get sick of it and crave something different…\nBut I don’t need to worry about that now.\nBetter to feed them a little stale kimchi stew than a mint-chocolate pineapple pizza abomination, right?\nThe readers following the Author’s story will be grateful to me, too.\nHmm, well, whatever.\n“The setting that their suitability for the enhancing serum determines if even ordinary people can become superhumans is really good.”\n[Ehehe…]\n“Nice touch that the leader of a villainous organization could have motives to betray them, too.”\n[H-How did you know that?!]\nNo, it’s a cliche.\nI know the flavor she was going for without tasting it.\n“Alright, let’s get going then. It’s about time I kept an eye on Siwoo.”\n[Okay, okay!…Ah ya…]\n“Hmm? What was that?”\n[N-Nothing!]\nHow dull.\n…And I ended up regretting not pressing the Author about it later.\nI had no idea she was pulling something so cool behind my back.\nI have to give credit where it’s due.\nWait, that’s not the point.\nA word from the Author (author review)\nWhat does kimchi pizza sweet and sour pork taste like?\nI heard it’s delicious.\nNo matter how much I think about it, it doesn’t seem to taste good.\nPeople who only look at mobile devices can see one cover, right?

      "content": "“Damn, what’s with all these guys?!”\n“Amelia! Are you okay?!”\n“I’m fine. Just focus on protecting the senior!”\n“Si, Siwoo! Above!”\n“!”\nAmelia looked to be in danger, and the moment Siwoo glanced away, a villain silently approached from behind and swung his sword.\nThe senior, wounded in the leg trying to protect Amelia from the surprise attack, cried out a warning. But it was too late for Siwoo to react to the sound.\nIt was a perfect ambush.\nHe had already known before hearing the sound, so naturally, he would have had enough time to react.\n“How did you…?!”\n“That kind of thing doesn’t work on me.”\nThe villain who had snuck up behind him, thinking he couldn’t be dodged, attacked with all his might.\nIf the ambush had succeeded, it would have been a powerful blow.\nBut the moment it failed, they were especially vulnerable.\nNaturally, he did not miss the chance.\nUsing centrifugal force, he delivered a kick like when he subdued the Chameleon villain, putting his weight into it.\n…But more gently than that time.\nOnce was enough.\nThanks to that experience, it felt like he had realized how much force a human needs to be struck with to be incapacitated without serious injury.\n“Ugh…?!”\nThe villain writhed in pain on the ground.\nHis life wasn’t in danger.\nEven with internal injuries, after a few months of treatment, he would recover.\nThere was no need to worry about that in a situation where he could have died instantly.\nA few months was getting off easy.\nAmelia cautiously looked around.\n“Phew, phew… How many more are there?”\n“Not sure. I think I’ve taken down about five so far.”\n“Ha, only five? I’ve got seven, including the one I just caught.”\n“I-I see.”\nHer personality doesn’t seem to falter even in this kind of situation.\nShe was totally caught off guard, but now she’s unfazed like this?\n“…By the way, where did Arte run off to again?”\n“Who knows? I’m worried about that too.”\nOf course, he wasn’t actually worried about Arte herself.\nNo matter what trouble she stirs up, she doesn’t seem like the type to get caught up in it.\nWhat worries him is what kind of trouble she’s causing.\n“It’s suspicious. For her to disappear right before something like this happens?”\n“…Yeah, I agree.”\n“There’s definitely something going on.”\nIt had already been several hours since Arte said she was going to the bathroom during our meal and disappeared.\nAnd conveniently, that’s when these villains attacked while she was gone.\nIn this remote area?\nThe timing is just too perfect.\n“D, damn it… How are we supposed to beat bastards like these?!”\n“We, we have to run away. There’s no way we can win!”\nThey’ve lost their fighting spirit.\nThe mob that rushed us is now diminished, and they seem to have given up after realizing they’re the only ones left.\nAmelia gripped her spear tightly as they tried to slink away.\n“What should we do?”\n“We could just let them go. We have too much else to deal with.”\n“Okay…Hey, you all can scram. We’ve got no business with you anymore.”\nA considerable amount of time had passed since the fighting started.\nEven without worrying about Arte, there was too much else to handle.\nFirst, they needed to report this to the Association and the police.\nThese guys are Übermensch.\nThey each had parts of animal bodies integrated into their own–that was clear.\nSomething’s footpads, wings of some unknown bird, sharp claws, and so on.\nEven the one who launched the destructive attack had strange protrusions on his feet that looked like hooves.\nThat’s probably why he didn’t hear his footsteps approaching.\nIt was similar to Lyla’s condition.\nThey had animal-like characteristics, just like her.\n…But what exactly are they?\nThe Association would be the one to investigate.\nAnd that wasn’t all.\nThey had to detain the villain they incapacitated and call an ambulance for the injured senior.\nThere was no time to capture those who had lost the will to fight.\nHis only concern with letting them go was the possibility of them harming civilians, but that could be mentioned when reporting the situation.\nThat’s how Siwwo judged it, deciding to let them go as long as they didn’t display any further strange behavior.\n“Ugh…?!”\n“Siwoo… Something’s not right here.”\n“Yeah. I felt it too.”\nAn eerie sense of dread washed over them.\nJust moments ago, those guys were hell-bent on escaping.\nThey immediately tried to flee when they saw that we wouldn’t apprehend them.\n…But now, there was something off about their faces as they turned to face them again.\n“Something’s wrong.”\nThe moment those words left his mouth, Amelia accelerated in an instant.\nJust as he prefers close-quarters combat, relying on his instinct, Amelia fully utilized her ability’s strengths.\n“Hah!”\nShunk.\nAn inhuman sound rang out through the forest.\nTwo of the three who had tried to flee were felled, their chests deeply gashed. The third’s neck cleanly twisted with just a light graze from Amelia’s spear shaft–one breath was all it took.\nFeats made possible by Amelia physically enhancing her acceleration to the limits.\nBut he couldn’t shake an uneasy feeling.\nThose attacks should have been avoidable for them.\nThere was no reason for them to simply accept such attacks without trying to evade.\n“Looks like…this isn’t over yet.”\n“Yeah. After seeing that creepy scene…”\nWhile she wouldn’t admire that grisly display, Amelia didn’t boast as she usually would.\nThe thought crossed his mind that those villains would still die if left alone. But why would they want to avoid that?\n“… There’s definitely something going on.”\nTheir expressions right before Amelia struck resurface in my mind.\nTears streaming down faces twisted in sheer terror. But they didn’t try to flee.\nThey had clearly been trying to escape just moments prior.\n“It was like they were being forced to stay put.”\n“Right? Siwoo, you saw it that way too, didn’t you? So creepy.”\nUndoubtedly, if they hadn’t already overwhelmed them, they would have fought back by any means necessary.\nThat’s what Siwoo thought.\n“…Damn, are you serious? My underlings dropping like flies to just three brats?”\nA deep voice suddenly rang out.\nWhipping our heads towards the source, we saw about ten people shambling towards us.\nThey all had parts of their bodies transformed into animals–Übermensch, no doubt.\nBut despite their pitiful appearance, Siwoo’s eyes narrowed at a certain scent wafting from them.\n“…The smell of blood.”\n“What?”\nAmelia questioned him, but Siwoo didn’t respond.\nThe smell of blood.\nThe same scent as when he cut into the Chameleon villain.\nSuddenly, Siwoo realized that an overwhelming bloody stench was emanating from them.\n“Sorry about this. I really didn’t want to involve some kids, but we got orders.”\n“…Whose orders are those?”\n“S, save us! Right now we’re…guh…! My, my neck…!”\nA man desperately trying to say something had his neck abruptly snapped, silencing him instantly.\nAfter a brief pause following that shockingly easy loss of life, the sighing man spoke up.\n“Didn’t I tell you not to pull any stupid shit like that? But you just don’t listen.”\nUnlike the others, this man’s entire body was coated in gray fur, with large ears and a stubby tail protruding.\nFinally, the red eyes and prominent front teeth made it clear what animal he resembled.\n“You, you’re a rat, aren’t you? That’s exactly what you look like.”\n“Yeah. I’m Marmo, an executive of the Übermensch.”\n“…Did you kill that person just now?”\n“I wish I had.”\nThe man who introduced himself as a Übermensch executive sighed heavily.\n“I told him to just obey, but he had to go and pull something stupid. You all, don’t try anything foolish–just do as you’re told. ‘They’re’ definitely watching right now.”\n“Y, yes sir!”\nThey’re being watched?\nWhile Siwoo had many questions for him, Marmo didn’t seem inclined to elaborate further.\n“Alright, you Academy brats. Looks like you’ve got some skills if only one of you got roughed up against that many of my guys.”\n“Some skills? Those losers couldn’t even touch my spear.”\n“Is that so? Well, sorry, but it’s about to get a bit tougher for you. Don’t hold it against us. We’re just doing what we gotta to survive. … Let’s go, kids.”\nAt his signal, the villains began their assault in unison.\nWith no chance to catch their breath, Siwoo and Amelia were forced into an overwhelmingly disadvantageous battle.\nRealizing this, Amelia let out a groan.\n“Isn’t ganging up on us a bit cowardly?!”\n“It’s a compliment to be called cowardly by the one whose spear couldn’t be touched. And for villains, cowardice is a virtue.”\n“Ugggh, so annoying!”\nShe still can’t control her temper, even in this situation?\nAmelia was supposed to be a noble’s daughter, but the term “gentle lady” didn’t seem to suit her at all.\nA wildflower would be more fitting.\n“But I actually prefer this…! Not giving us a chance to rest will be your downfall!”\n“Oh? And why is that?”\n“Because my dad could never catch me when I used my powers! You know why?”\n“Amelia! What are you saying all of a sudden in the middle of a fight?!”\nSiwoo almost lost his grip on his weapon for a moment while fending off the villains before him.\nFortunately, it seemed my opponent was just as distracted, preventing any dangerous situations from arising. But still…\nThis girl. What is she going on about amid battle?!\n“My dad could never keep up with me when I kept using my acceleration ability…! I’d just run away before he could punish me!”\n“…Alright, I’ve heard enough. Are those your final words?”\n“You should be ready to taste the speed that even A-Rank number 4 Lionel Lindberg couldn’t catch up to–from me, Amelia Lindberg!”\n“Wait, what?”\nEveryone seemed stunned by her words.\nA-Rank number 4…? Lionel Lindberg?\nA famous hero, renowned as the “Blazing Lionel” by the people.\nSo she’s his daughter? No wonder she never mentioned her family before.\nNo, that’s not the important part right now.\nWhat did she just say about him being unable to keep up with her…?\n“Here I go!”\nAmelia charged forth like a beam of light.\nA speed utterly transcending anything she had shown until now.\nAuthor’s Notes\nAhem Ahem.\nGalaxyTL, I hope you have a nice day today.\nTranslator’s Corner\n….Uhhhhhhhhh……Well hello Author-nim! I hope you’re enjoying the translation I’ve been doing…please don’t get bored of writing, the world can’t move without you.\nSeriously though, thank you for writing this. It’s truly an enjoyable read. Please keep writing amazing things like this. Fighting!\n…Just in case, I’m talking about 화이팅, not actual fighting…\nBut I almost got a heart-attack when I saw the group being called out. I seriously feel like Arte when the Author(of the story) does something completely random. I feel I’ve become closer to her on some level.\nNow some other big news. Viiyen on ko-fi just made a big—no, absolutely massive—donation. 34 Chapters.  If any of you wish to support the series, I’ll put your names ahead because, honestly, we’re going to be seeing Viiyen’s name for a long, long, long time. I’m sure they won’t mind me sharing the spotlight with some of the other supporters.\nAgain, thank you, Author-nim and Viiyen, for supporting my translation. Also, to the other supporters—Lemur4444, Dragons33, Clone Trooper, Isaac Martinez, Sergrand, Danmaka, and everyone from my previous translations—thank you so much.\nI can’t do the bonus chapters now since I have my final exams, but I’ll still do the daily one.\nFinally, try not to forget my name, from yours truly,\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "Everyone doubted their eyes.\nIt was an astonishing speed.\nAmelia, who had dashed like a flash, rushed forward with her spear, her golden hair trailing behind her in a blur.\nHowever, what surprised the villains and Siwoo was not that.\nNo, of course, they were surprised by that tremendous speed, but…\nAmelia had clearly stabbed the villain with her weapon.\n… But why wasn’t there any wound?\n“Ah, you’re tougher than you look. Why are you so thick?”\n“Die!!!”\n“Kyaaah?!”\nKwaaang!\nTaking full advantage of his massive body, the villain slammed his hand down towards Amelia.\nHowever, Amelia had already fled while screaming, and only the ground was struck, kicking up dust.\nShe was undoubtedly fast.\n…Fast, but why didn’t her attack land?\n“This is really annoying! Why are you so tough?!”\n“…I see. You need a price for that speed.”\n“You figured that out from just one attack? You’re pretty smart, huh?”\nA price?\nWhat in the world…?\n“You increased your acceleration but also took away from your strength. I can understand now why your dad couldn’t catch you. However, the price is too high.”\n“Haa. Yeah, that’s right.”\nWeaken?\nWhen Siwoo looked at her figure after hearing those words, he finally noticed.\nThe spear she was holding in her hand was trembling slightly. Was it heavy?\nDespite the strain, she had always been able to hold the spear straight before.\nThe tip of the spear was shaking.\n“But it’s strange. Why don’t you just run away? Unlike what you said, your ability is not at all advantageous for a drawn-out battle. You were just putting on a front.”\n“Ah, ahahaha. So my bluff was seen through also? I can’t act, can I? I definitely need to practice when…”\n“Even  if I can’t catch you, you can’t defeat me either.  If you run away, we have no way to catch you. Why don’t you just go?”\n“No, scratch that. You were dumber than I thought.”\n“What do you mean? I don’t think I’ve said anything wrong.”\nIn response to the puzzled leader, Amelia smiled at Siwoo and shouted.\n“Can someone aiming to be a hero abandon their friend?”\n“…”\n“If I did that, I’d have no excuse with Dad!”\nSiwoo blankly stared at her confident, smiling expression.\nShe was a hero.\nThe hero that Siwoo aimed to become.\nThe heroic spirit Amelia embodied was what Siwoo sought.\nCertainly, she preferred extreme methods.\nSiwoo clearly sensed that as he got caught up in her outrageous plans.\nBut Amelia, who enrolled in the academy to become a hero, had her own beliefs.\nI have to help her.\nAs Amelia said, a hero does not abandon their friends.\nBut how?\nNo, don’t think about it.\nThere’s no time to wonder  if I can or can’t.\nI just have to do it.\nHaving shielded the senior and taken attacks he could, his whole body ached.\nPerhaps because he had only avoided the dangerous attacks until now and taken most of them, his body was screaming from the unfamiliar pain.\nBut it didn’t matter.\nWhile waiting for the Association and police to arrive at any moment, he had to protect the senior.\nThe opponent is stronger than the grunts who came earlier, and they also seem to have gotten stronger.\nBut it didn’t matter.\nAmelia has become so weakened from overusing her ability that she can no longer deal meaningful damage to the enemy. He may even have to protect her.\nBut it didn’t matter.\nNone of that mattered.\nBecause abandoning a comrade in danger is something a hero must never do.\n‘I have to do something, no matter what!’\n“…Ha. For students, you’re quite principled. Let me tell you something good. That’s arrogance.  If you die, you won’t have any friends.”\n“It doesn’t matter. Running away here would only make me a loser, wouldn’t it? I don’t like that. I’ve decided to save my friend by any means necessary.”\n“I see. Then die. My apologies. This, too, is for survival.”\nBut it was too much.\nFar too much.\nSiwoo had to defeat all these villains and help Amelia.\nBut that was too much.\nNot impossible, but it would take too long.\nHe could win. He was sure of it.\nThey couldn’t inflict any damage on him.\nThe injuries he’s sustained were all from defending the immobile senior.\nHowever, it would take too long.\nSiwoo’s ability is intuition.\nA defensive ability focused on evasion.\nAs such, fighting multiple opponents like this inevitably takes a long time.\nUntil now, he hadn’t considered it a drawback.\nIf only I had an enhancement-type ability like Amelia’s, albeit not as powerful. Then…!\n“Geez, why am I like this… Ah, I know. I understand. It’s my fault.”\nTap, tap.\nEven amidst the fighting, he heard a cheerful footfall.\n…A voice he had forgotten until now.\n“Ah, Arte…?”\n“Yes, Siwoo. It’s me, Arte Iris. When you’re in trouble, don’t try to solve it alone—call a friend!”\nShe appeared as  if out for a stroll in the park near home.\nReeking of blood.\n“…What have you done? Don’t tell me…”\n“Aah. So this is how it turned out? …Umm, what should I say? Ah, this is good.”\nWhere had she been until she finally showed up?\nCould this be part of her scheme?\nHe had a mountain of questions I wanted to ask but decided not to for now.\nRelief spread across Siwoo’s face.\nShe certainly wouldn’t want them to die in a place like this.\n“It’s the ever-timely Arte Chance!*”\n“Attack quickly! Now!”\nWuhdook.\nWith that sound, the villains’ necks snapped in an instant.\n***\nAh, I expected too much.\nSince Siwoo had completely avoided my threads during our last match, and these guys couldn’t avoid them, I thought he could easily handle it.\nThe variable was the senior.\nNo, did I underestimate the death throes of the puppets trying to survive?\nDespite the perfect ambush, Siwoo reacted, but Amelia didn’t.\nAnd because of that, the senior got taken out trying to protect her.\nSiwoo, burdened with protecting the senior, couldn’t avoid the attacks and got injured.\nAs for Amelia, I thought she was a full-fledged heroine, but she turned out to have penalties galore, just like me.\nThe sense of kinship was no joke.\nIt was my mistake not to check the details of her ability despite knowing it.\nOr rather, since it was called acceleration, I thought that was all there was to it.\nWhat did the Author say in response to whether it violated the laws of physics?\n[There’s mana and abilities, so what does it matter!]\nFair enough.\nBut still, that’s not right.\nGetting faster the more she fights, but weaker attacks? What kind of…\nEquivalent exchange?\nI’ve heard that while the increase in speed outweighs the decrease in strength, it’s meaningless  if the attacks are too light.\nSiwoo and Amelia would be monsters  if their basic specs supported them, but right now, they’re just flailing around like perpetually premature products.\nIt’s not like they’re holding a coin, hoping it’ll moon someday.**\nGeez, Author really loves penalties, huh?\nAnd amid all that, Siwoo is the only one without penalties? Is that a protagonist buff? It pisses me off.\n“You bitch! I’ll kill you with like you–gack?!”\n“Oh? Suddenly stopping mid-sentence…Is there a problem?”\nWhoa there.\nYou dare spout nonsense in front of the protagonist?\nDon’t you know better than to use that foul mouth?\nI wanted to snap his neck, but this time, I decided to yield him to the protagonist.\n“Now, Siwoo. It’s your turn.”\n“Me, me…?”\n“Yes. I don’t have the hobby of snatching prey someone else has already caught, you know?”\nIt was nonsense.\nAmelia was on the verge of death, having not even made a scratch on her opponent.\nEven  if Siwoo wins, it will be a problem for the supporting characters to die.\nThat’s why I intervened.\nBut  if I take out the leader here, too, it would make the story go awry.\nThe protagonist should be the one to do that.\nEven Arte Chance has its limits.\n“…Got it. I’ll ask you for whatever you’ve been up to later.”\n“It was nothing, really…”\nAh.\nI had a slight hope he might have forgotten.\nDoesn’t seem to be the case.\nWell, just being smart isn’t enough.\nI’ll have to think slowly about how to make an excuse.\n“…Phew, here I go!”\n[Oh, intuition! Excellent! A chance to witness the protagonist’s exploits!]\nCome to think of it, that’s right.\nI could almost see the Author’s delighted expression.\nIt wasn’t a complete waste after all.\nShe seemed inspired by Amelia’s demeanor.\nHopefully, she picked up a bit of that heroic spirit.\n***\n“Shit, shit…! I’m unlucky as hell!”\nHe slid down the mountain at a speed that made it feel like he was slipping.\nHis entire body was already covered in blood, a complete mess with no uninjured areas.\nBut he had no time to worry about that.\nWho knew when that crazy woman would be on his tail!\n“Huff, huff…!”\nHe was lucky.\nFor some reason, that woman didn’t kill him and instead talked with that boy.\nIt was an incomprehensible act.\nPerhaps the reason she attacked us was because of that?\nBut that was fortunate for me.\nHe had time to unleash my special talent of evading detection.\nShe didn’t want the students to know about her deeds, so she played along.\nTaking advantage of her lapse in concentration, he thrust his neck into the tip of the student’s sword, destroying the necklace he had.\nOnly then could he slip away, leaving his defeated subordinates behind.\nA snicker escaped his at the woman’s look of bewilderment as  if she hadn’t expected such an action.\nAs always, the survivors are the strong ones.\nAnd today, Marmo survived.\n“I thought I was gonna die. What the hell was that woman doing?”\nWhen he goes to another branch, he’ll have to gather information on that crazy woman.\nHe couldn’t remember her face, but he’d memorized the other students’ faces.\nShe must be someone lurking around them.\nHe’ll have to watch my steps from no–\n“…? Hey, did someone else survive? You alright?”\nAt the entrance to the mountain, a woman with wolf ears and a tail was sitting on the stairs.\nAn Übermensch member.\nLuckily, it looks like one of them survived.\nThat bitch was more careless than he thought.\n“You seem alright. Here are my orders. Quickly get us a means of transport–gack?!”\n“I’m sorry, but no can do. Orders are that no one leaves this place alive.”\nOnly then did Marmo notice her neck hidden under her clothes.\n…Careless my ass.\nShe never intended to let anyone live in the first place.\n“Ha, really. I’m so fucking unlucky.”\nThat was the demise of the rat who had survived by crawling on the ground.\nAuthor’s Note\nPhysically speaking, it’s only natural for someone with greater strength and muscle to be faster.\nUnlike in games where high agility lowers attack power, the person with high attack power also tends to have high agility and endurance.\nBut what  if mana and abilities come into play?\nTranslator’s Corner\nWe get the fastest toothpick in the west.\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "“Hey, Siwoo.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Wanna go on a date?”\n“…What are you saying out of nowhere? In that body, where would you go?”\nHe chided Amelia, who was lying in bed.\nCalling it a ‘date’ instead of just saying ‘let’s go out’ aside, her body currently needed rest.\nShe wasn’t severely injured, but she had pushed her body to the limit, so she needed to rest for a few days.\nFor her to even suggest going out while hospitalized.\nJokes should be made in moderation.\n“No, not me. With Arte.”\n“…Huh?”\n“You said you’d go on a date during the outing but couldn’t. Wouldn’t it be better to do it now?”\n“No, what are you… Weren’t we supposed to drop that? From the start, the idea of her liking me made no sense. Thinking about it again, it really doesn’t seem to be the case…”\n“No, I’m sure of it. Arte loves you! Do it. Right now!”\nHad she finally gone insane?\nIt seemed her mind had snapped from having to stay bedridden with her ‘plans’ suppressed.\n‘To think a colleague I considered a friend would lose her mind… It’s a pity.’\n“Why are you looking at me like that? Now’s the perfect chance, for real!”\n“What chance? There’s no way to even meet Arte. On top of that, a date? It’s only been a few days since we’ve been ambushed. I’d be lucky not to be treated like some woman-crazed fool.”\nIt hadn’t been long since the nation was turned upside down by Übermensch’s raid.\nThe attack on the academy students and their mysterious annihilation.\nUnlike what they could with Lyla, their names spread rather quickly.\n“Plus, those guys were originally in the hundreds, right? They’re all dead.”\n“Ah, you mean that. There were rumors it was some kind of internal rebellion.”\n“…Did that come up in the news?”\n“No, I heard it from my father.”\nSiwoo often forgot, but Amelia was a precious young lady. The gap between the glimpses of that side and her usual self was jarring.\n“Apparently, it was crazy. The sight of humans minced into pieces made even seasoned vets vomit.”\n“Ugh, don’t make me imagine it.”\n“Plus, from the hallway to the rooms was a sea of blood! Along with a silly scrawl that said ‘Arachne was here’ and a spider pattern, all done in blood apparently.”\nSpiders.\nIt did seem plausible it was an internal Übermensch rebellion.\n“Spiders are animals, right?”\n“Yeah. They’re easily mistaken for insects.”\n“…And they spit out webbing?”\n“Right.”\nEveryone would probably think it was an internal Übermensch conflict.\nBut Amelia and Siwoo couldn’t help but have a different thought about that spider pattern.\n“I’m thinking it’s Arte. What about you, Siwoo?”\n“Same here. The webbing, spiders, and even the smell of blood back then. It has to be her.”\nShe had said when parting ways with me,\nShe said she was a bit late because she had to use the restroom.\nThere’s no way that was true.\nAnd to subdue that many villains…\nHis hunch deepened.\nNo, he should say it became a confirmation.\nShe had been at odds with Übermensch.\n“Could she be a traitor?”\n“But Arte didn’t have an animal body like the other villains.”\n“Hmm…we lack information.”\nJust what is her true identity?\nA traitor of Übermensch?\nOr a villainous organization rivaling them?\nAs I was pondering her identity, Amelia raised her voice again.\n“No, now’s not the time to think about that! Think of a date course instead!”\nHere we go again.\nWhat is this fixation on a date?\nHe sighed and opened my mouth to calm her down again.\n“I told you. The timing for a date is…”\n“It doesn’t have to be a date!”\n“…What?”\nMore nonsensical words.\nWhenever Amelia was like this, he always ended up convinced by her claims, spellbound.\nAnd the results were never good.\nIn fact, he thought he shouldn’t listen, but…\n…I couldn’t overcome my curiosity.\nCuriosity killed the cat, as the saying goes. It really was true.\n“Operation 0: Make You the Person Who Loves Arte the Most in Order To Stop Her. It failed due to an unfortunate accident.”\n“Operation 0…?”\n“So it’s time for Operation 1 to take the stage…! Code name: Getting Clothes Wet in the Drizzle!”\nAgain, some absurd operation name was coming.\nEven as he thought that, he couldn’t help but lend his ear.\n“Tell me, Siwoo, what do you think a date is?”\n“Well, it’s when a guy and girl who love each other go out somewhere together.”\n“Pfft, that’s why you’re a virgin.”\n“?!”\nWh, what?\nDid I say something wrong?\nNo, I didn’t, right? Well, isn’t it?\nMore importantly, how did she know…!\n“You don’t necessarily have to be in a relationship to go out together!”\n“No, that’s true but…”\n“It’s easy to meet up. You two are colleagues who went through that incident together, on the surface at least.”\n“I…I guess so?”\n“Just say you want to talk about that incident, and since you’re already out, go to a cafe or something–that’s a date! You don’t have to tell Arte!”\nHe was confused.\nWhy does that sound right?\nNo, isn’t it right?\nBut has listening to Amelia ever turned out well?\nNot really.\nYet this time, it really does sound plausible.\n“The goal of Operation 1, ‘Getting Clothes Wet in the Drizzle,’ is simple. It’s to increase her affection…”\n“No, sorry. I don’t think this is it after all. I’m out.”\nSiwoo cut her off, feeling he shouldn’t listen further.\nDanger, danger.\nIf he listened a bit more, like when he ended up in the locker due to being swayed by her words, he might do something weird again.\nIt does sound right, but they should stop here…\n“Eh, really? …I already called her though?”\n“What?”\n“Amelia…Ah, Siwoo is here too. Hello.”\n…It seems he never had a choice to begin with.\nAs he blankly looked at the suddenly appeared Arte, she smiled and spoke up.\n“Haha, surprised you, didn’t I? Amelia told me not to say anything to surprise you… You’re surprised, right?”\nWhen he gave Amelia a look asking what she had done, she beamed.\nBad girl.\nJust as you said, you really do employ any means necessary.\nHe’ll have to retract his previous assessment.\nShe’s overflowing not with a hero’s qualities but a villain’s.\n***\n[A, a date! A date!]\nWhat date? Nonsense.\nI wanted to say something to the Author, but I held back since Siwoo was there.\n[The protagonist going around town with a girl on a date! Kyaa! I’m so happy!]\n“Shall we go to a cafe or something?”\n“Uh, yeah? S, sure.”\n[A cafe is good too! A lovey-dovey date!]\nUgh.\nI forcibly held back the curses that nearly slipped out.\nIs going around town and resting at a cafe a date?\nIt felt like I had encountered someone maliciously labeling everything as dating.\nWhat date?\nAmelia had said that Siwoo wanted to talk about that incident, right?\nThe club president is hospitalized, and Amelia can’t stand properly.\nSince talking in the hospital room would be uncomfortable, she told me Siwoo would let her know later and sent us out.\nBut what? A date?\nIs this a joke?\nThe protagonist wants to consult a colleague about the incident.\nI wanted to start nagging the Author, but I couldn’t.\nSiwoo was still here.\n“…So? What did you want to say?”\n“Ah, right…By the way, have you heard? About those villains.”\n“Of course. The Übermensch organization, right?”\n“…Not that.”\nHuh?\nWhat? Wasn’t he talking about Übermensch?\nWith this development, wasn’t the protagonist supposed to learn the proper attitude as a hero and estimate the strength of the villain organization through the first executive?\nWas there more he could find out?\n“Apparently, there were nearly 200 of those villains.”\n“Ah, I see. Is that so? But with so many…”\n“They all died. Horrifically.”\nAh, that story.\nCome to think of it, Amelia is set up as the daughter of a wealthy family.\nHer father is a famous hero, making her the very picture of a wealthy heiress heroine.\nShe probably heard it from her father and relayed it to Siwoo.\nThe information gathering befitting a young lady.\n…Her personality is the complete opposite though. Why does she have that background but that personality?\n“But you know, apparently, they found something a bit odd there.”\n“Something odd?”\n“Yeah.”\nSomething odd?\nHmm, I don’t know.\nThe villains turned into cube steaks?\n…That is odd if you call it that, but didn’t he just say they died horrifically? It can’t be that, right?\n“There was a drawing on the wall, made with blood apparently.”\n“…Pardon?”\n[Oh, this is bad.]\nShe sounded flustered.\nBut I couldn’t care less about that as my mind spun rapidly.\n…What? Was there a drawing on the wall made of blood?\n“A drawing made with deep red blood shaped like a spider. Underneath it said, ‘Arachne was here.'”\nAuthor!!!\nJust what did you do!!!\nUnable to voice my irritation aloud, I deeply bowed my head.\nHearing that story, I felt like my face would be completely scrunched up.\n“…What do you think about this ?”\nThe protagonist cautiously asked me.\nAuthor’s Notes\nTwo blockheads…! (I believe referring to Siwoo and Arte.)\nAnd it seems Arte’s ambush succeeded!",

      "content": "“Hah, haha. Well, I don’t have much of an opinion.”\n“Really?”\n“Yeah. How am I supposed to imagine what that place looked like?”\nFor now, I gave a vague response to the protagonist.\nHe had a suspicious look in his eyes.\nIs he doubting me?\nWell, he has reason to.\nI suddenly disappeared.\nAt the site of the massacre, a spider was drawn in blood.\nI can control threads, so it’s not strange for them to be suspicious.\nThen, I remembered.\nWhen I left that hideout, the Author acted strangely.\nShe probably skipped ahead quickly so she wouldn’t miss Siwoo’s exploits.\nThere is no way she added something in between, right?\n“Arachne” came?\nHow do I handle this…?\nJust as I was racking my brain, the protagonist spoke up.\n“Well,  if you say so. Oh, do you like cake?”\n“Huh?…Yeah, I guess.”\n“Then let’s get some cake. It’s not much for a life, but since I’m still a student, this is all I can do now.”\n“Y-yeah…?”\nHuh?\n…Why isn’t he interrogating me?\nThat’s weird.\nEven  if he doesn’t think I’m the culprit, he usually asks more questions, assuming I’m somehow involved.\nWhile I was flustered, the cake we ordered arrived.\nIt was a slice loaded with fresh whipped cream and chocolate.\nIt does look tasty.\nCan I eat it?\n“Come on, eat up. You said you like cake, right?”\n“Oh, yeah…Thank you for the food…”\nWhat in the world is going on?\nIs Siwoo, the protagonist, treating this as trivial?\nWell, it’s better for me that the protagonist isn’t too sharp.\nI didn’t really know what to say anyway.\n…Hmm, this is good.\nAs I cut into the cake and put it in my mouth, the sweetness spread through.\nMmm, this is a good bakery.\nI should remember this place.\nOne of the best parts of possessing this body is being able to eat desserts without worrying about what others think.\nWhen I was a guy, I was way too self-conscious.\nBut that didn’t matter now.\nNo matter how much I ate, I never seemed to gain weight, so I could do so freely.\n“Ah, can I order another one?”\n“Um, sure…? Go ahead.”\nAnd so, Siwoo’s wallet became tattered that day.\nBecause I ordered a ton of cake slices and sweet drinks.\nHis eyes shook slightly when he opened his wallet, which was a little pitiful, but I took it as payment since he brought up the life debt.\nIt’s not that expensive for a life debt, is it?\nLater that night, when I was alone in my room, I gave the Author an earful.\n“Why in the world did you do that without saying anything?”\n[W-Well, I thought I was running out of time…]\n“Time?! Time?! Are you kidding me right now?”\n[But…! Isn’t it cool though? If I set up the hook now, I can resolve it later by adding to the setting! Someone lurking in the shadows…! Isn’t that cool?!]\n“Then, at least tell me! What  if Siwoo gets the wrong idea from this?! What were you thinking pulling a stunt like that?!”\n[W-Well…I thought you’d scold me…Hic…]\nUgh, my head.\nShe’s not even a kid, and she hid it because she was afraid of being scolded?\nMy chest started to feel tight.\n“I’m not going to let you sleep tonight.”\n[H-Hic. Please, go easy on me…]\n“What was that just now?”\n[N-Nothing!]\nHaah.\nThe Author really needs me around.\n***\n“…Well? That was a success!”\n“A, success…?”\nSiwoo couldn’t understand Amelia’s words at all.\nA success?\nThat was?\nWhy?\n“You had a conversation and ate some tasty food together. If that’s not a date, then what is?”\n“…I really don’t know what you’re talking about.”\n“If you don’t get it, just do what I say!”\nIs this right?\nNo, he couldn’t even comprehend how it was a success in the first place.\nDoes she mean she successfully emptied his wallet?\nIs having a conversation and eating dessert together a date?\nSeriously?\n“That’s how people naturally get closer. Nurturing affection for each other…Well, Arte already seems overflowing with affection.”\nAmelia kept telling me that Arte seemed to be in love with him.\nAt first, he naively believed Amelia’s words, but thinking back, Arte didn’t seem that way at all.\nIs Amelia mistaken?\nWhen he brought that up, Amelia sighed heavily.\nWith a look that seemed to say, “You’re hopeless.”\n“I mean, Arte has no reason to be interested in you, remember? We talked about this before.”\n“…Yeah.”\nThat heavy truth hit him again.\nWhile he’s been involved in many incidents lately, he’s otherwise unremarkable, so Arte wouldn’t have any reason to be interested in him when she first showed him.\nSiwoo was just a decently performing student at the time.\nThe incidents started happening after Arte showed interest in me.\n“So the fact that she saved you from the Übermensch’s attack and comforted you…is there any explanation besides love?”\n“B-But what  if it’s really not that?”\n“So what  if it’s not? Then we’ll just find another way. We don’t have a much better plan than that, do we?”\nHe had so many rebuttals he wanted to say.\nBut her confident tone and eloquence left him speechless.\nDamn it.\n“And it was good that you let that incident slide too.”\n“…Is that so?”\n“Yeah. Digging too deep could be dangerous.”\nHe could be certain from Arte’s reaction that the “Arachne” referred to her.\n‘How am I supposed to imagine what that looked like?’ That was an obvious lie.\nProbably something she blurted out in a panic.\nAnyone who was completely clueless wouldn’t even bring up that kind of wording.\nThey should not understand what is being referred to.\nJust by choosing those words, she revealed that she knew what “that place” was, even  if she didn’t realize it in her flustered state.\n“But it is a little strange. If she was going to panic like that, why would she leave that behind?”\n“…Who knows. Maybe she didn’t draw it herself or something?”\n“…You mean, the doing of that ‘Author?'”\n“Just speculation.”\n“Haah. I guess we still don’t know anything for sure…Looks like one plan won’t be enough. I need to make a move too.”\nAmelia proudly pulled something out of her hospital gown.\nIt looked like some kind of high-quality item. …What is that?\n“I really had to beg my dad for this. It was super annoying brushing off his questions about what I’d use it for.”\n“So, what is it?”\n“A magic detector. Way better quality than the one that senior gave us. My dad used this one himself, after all.”\n“…!”\nA magic detector, huh.\nThe same device they used to track down the Chameleon villain.\nWhile it had flaws, with this one…!\n“No guarantee we’ll find it, but it’s worth a try at least.”\n“The Secret Room.”\n“Right. It’ll probably take some time, though. So we’ll be running two projects simultaneously.”\nShe held up two fingers.\n“Seducing Arte and finding the Secret Room before her. Our ultimate goal is still to stop Arte. As long as one succeeds, that’s enough.”\n“…I see.”\nTheir theory is that Arte is behind all the incidents.\nWhether that groundless speculation will turn out to be a shocking truth remains to be seen.\n***\n“What are the results?”\n“No villains match the conditions. We didn’t detect anything unusual in the blood samples either.”\n“Sigh…”\nIn a secluded cabin with no signs of life, a blue-haired beauty was receiving a report amidst the bustle of various agents moving about.\n“What do you think, ma’am?”\n“Hmm, it’s troubling. A traitor to the Übermensch?”\n“It’s possible, or it could be the work of another criminal organization. There’s nothing definitive yet.”\nLetting out a sigh along with a grumble, she took out a cigarette from her pocket and lit it up.\nUnderstanding her feelings, her subordinate gave her a wry smile as he continued speaking.\n“There’s no villain in our data capable of flaunting their crimes in such a way. It must be a new player.”\n“Why would someone so strong resort to villain acts? They could just hunt fiends and be praised for life.”\n“The thought process of villains is hard to comprehend.”\nThe villain’s lair, still giving off the stench of blood, resurfaced in her mind, causing her face to contort.\nUgh, she shouldn’t have thought of that.\nIt just made her feel queasy.\n“A villain who shows no mercy, flaunting their crimes…”\n“They effortlessly took out nearly 200 villains, too.”\n“Evidence?”\n“Just bundles of threads with unknown purpose. Nothing else. The people were likely sliced up by extremely reinforced threads.”\n“…Did you have to put it like that?”\n“Ah, my apologies. I misspoke.”\nShe was trying to forget that gruesome scene, but she recalled it vividly again.\nShe never wanted to erase her memory of that.\nSome of the subordinates who went had weak stomachs and threw up, and those with weak wills still couldn’t sleep properly after days.\nShe wasn’t any different.\nShe was dumbstruck for a while.\nHaving witnessed countless crimes, that level of brutality was a first for her.\n“Threads, so a spider then. Hah.”\n“The playful handwriting suggests they don’t feel much guilt over taking lives.”\n“Well, did you expect someone who did that to feel guilty?”\n“…”\nHer subordinate’s expression also rapidly soured, likely reminded of what he had witnessed.\nNice one. Now she’s made him think of it too.\n“Report it to HQ. Register a new villain.”\n“Understood. The details, ma’am?”\n“Villain name, Arachne. Presumed thread-based abilities. Details unknown. Likely female.”\n“…Female?”\n“Arachne is a female name, right? Don’t you know the myth?”\nVillains who like to show off tend to leave behind clues in trivial details like this.\nIf they left nothing at all, the investigation wouldn’t progress, but their desire to flaunt leads them to slip up.\nFor those types, you have to scrutinize any evidence they left behind.\n“Threat level…A-class should be fine. Oh, and have the Association increase security at the Academy.”\n“The Academy?”\n“There’s been a lot of incidents there lately. It just feels uneasy.”\nThe people who reported this incident were probably Academy students.\nThe instincts she had honed from long experience dealing with villains were ringing alarm bells.\nThere’s something at the Academy.\nAuthor’s Notes\nHmm, nothing much to say today.\nRuminas, be careful of the heat!",

      "content": "“…?”\nI stopped in my tracks, feeling something off.\nI blinked blankly at the unbelievable scene before my eyes.\n“Where am I…?”\nJust once.\nIt was just a single step.\nNo, was it even a blink?\nI’m not sure. My mind was in such chaos that I couldn’t make a proper judgment.\nIn just a single moment, a place completely different from where I was walking until a moment ago unfolded before my eyes.\nAs  if the world had turned upside down in an instant.\n[Hello!]\n“…?”\nEven after standing blankly for a while and looking around, nothing changed. The scenery that had changed instantly was still spread out before me.\nI had no idea what was going on right now. It was beyond confusing.\nIn that situation, I suddenly heard someone greeting me.\nI quickly looked around, but all I saw was a back alley with no people in sight.\nA completely different place from the main street I had been walking on.\nThere was no one there to greet me.\nA greeting coming from a place with no one around.\nHearing that, I made a judgment.\n“What, is this a dream.”\n[It’s not a dream, you know?]\n“A lucid dream? This is really weird.”\n[I’m telling you, it’s not a dream!]\nWhenever I had dreams, my mind always felt like it was hazily dyed.\nThis was the first time I had such a clear awareness that I was dreaming.\nThe voice of a young girl keeps yelling in my head that it’s not a dream, but…\nWhat else could it be  if it’s not a dream when the location suddenly changes instantly?\n“… It’s weird.”\nI clearly remember everything I did today, but I think this is all a dream.\nJust looking at the dark back alley was exciting.\nThe cell phone I always carried was suddenly nowhere to be seen, but I didn’t care.\nHow strange.\nDo people who have lucid dreams always feel this kind of joy in their lives?\nI heard they put a lot of effort into practicing lucid dreams.\n…Should I try?\nAs I was thinking that and looking around, it happened.\nThe girl in my head shouted loudly.\n[Argh! I told you it’s not a dream! How do I explain this…!]\n“…Ugh, this is a bit much. It’s loud.”\nWhere on earth is that voice coming from?\nI wished for the owner of this voice to disappear, but it had no noticeable effect.\nSince it was a lucid dream, I thought things would go as I wished. However, I guess it’s not perfect.\n“Oh, what’s this? A half-decent looking chick.”\n“What brings you here? Here to play with us?”\n“Why else would she be here?”\n“Heh heh.”\n… What’s this now?\nAs I tried hard to ignore the voice in my head and admire the scenery, two thugs were suddenly laughing and chatting.\nFrivolous voices, as  if intimidating some woman they had grabbed.\nWas my imagination always this good?\nIt was so realistic that it made me frown. I moved to leave the spot.\n“What, are you ignoring us?”\n“Cheeky, just like you look… So that’s how it is, huh?”\nIt was pitiful for the unknown woman who seemed entangled with these annoying guys, but I had no intention of helping her.\nShe’s just a dream character anyway.\nShe’ll get intimidated like that, then disappear once I leave….\n“…?”\n“You can’t just ignore us like that.”\n“When someone talks to you, you should respond, right?”\nWhat the hell are with these guys?\nWhy are they coming up to me?\nI have no intention of getting in your way.\nDo what you were doing. There is no need to involve me.\nNot wanting to get involved with these annoying fellows, I tried to change direction and leave.\n“…Ah, seriously. You’re pissing me off.”\nMy body suddenly swayed greatly, and my vision spun.\nI turned my head to look behind me, and sure enough, one of the thugs had grabbed my wrist.\nSo that’s why, because my arm was grabbed.\nI felt a slight pain in my arm, perhaps because my wrist was suddenly grabbed.\n…Wait, pain?\n“I let it slide that you came here alone, but ignoring us is a no-go.”\n“I thought you might be a superhuman, so we watched for a bit… Looks like you’re just a stupid pretty face.”\n“A normal person entering an alley like this needs to give up on leaving unscathed, got it?”\nThe thugs were saying something noisily, but I just blankly stared at my arm where I felt pain.\n“…This isn’t a dream?”\nIf it was a dream, there’s no way it would hurt, right?\nPerhaps they heard me muttering blankly.\nThe thugs looked at me with slightly worried expressions.\n“Hey, is this chick alright in the head?”\n“Dunno. Seems a bit out of it. But since her face is pretty, we can sell her for a high price.”\n“Hmm, is that so.”\n…Woman?\nCome to think of it, these guys have been talking to a woman this whole time.\nRealizing that fact, I quickly looked around.\nAnd what I saw was a desolate alley and a slender arm still being held by the thugs.\n“Wh-what…?”\nOnly then did I notice the discomfort in my body.\nThe countless inconsistencies I had brushed off, thinking it was a dream, suddenly became a reality.\nDelicate arms.\nHeavy chest and a lower point of view than usual.\nA soft voice, lower than typical for a woman but still clearly feminine.\nA different sense of balance.\nSuch big changes that I couldn’t understand how I hadn’t noticed.\nThere was only one truth those changes pointed to.\nThe woman those thugs kept talking to was me.\n“Wh-what happened….”\n“This chick still doesn’t get the situation, huh.”\n“It’s convenient for us. By the way, she’s way better than I thought…Hey.”\nWhile I was still lost in confusion, I noticed the thug’s eyes scanning my body and realized.\nI was in an extremely dangerous situation right now.\n“Be careful. She may be top-grade goods, but…If we damage her, the price will drop a lot.”\n“…Tsk. I guess so.”\n“Let’s hold back a little. If we can sell this woman, we’ll be able to get so many chicks we’ll be tripping over them.”\nI’m not sure about the details myself.\nBut one thing is certain…\nIf things continue like this, who knows what will happen to me.\nRealizing that, I desperately tried to shake off his hand and run away, but…\nThis frail body that wasn’t my original one couldn’t shake off the men’s arms.\n“Let go, let go…!”\n“Huh? What’s this.”\n“Looks like she’s come to her senses?”\n“…Tsk. This is getting annoying.”\nWhat on earth is going on?\nIf it wasn’t a dream, did I move to such a strange place in the blink of an eye?\nNo, in the first place, why did my body change like this?\nPutting those thoughts aside, I tried my best to get away from here, but…\nThe result of my struggle was met with violence.\n“Ugh, urgh…!”\n“This, is, annoying, you know. Stay, still, like earlier!”\nNot enough to cause injury, just light violence.\nBut even that light violence was unfamiliar, and I quickly shrank back.\n…It hurts.\nIt hurt so much.\n[Hmm…. Getting beat up by extras like them is a bit much….]\nWhy do I have to suffer this kind of treatment?\nWhat the hell is going on?\nJust as tears were about to fall from the unfairness of it all.\nThe auditory hallucination that had been speaking in my head talked to me.\n[Reader-nim. You need to escape this situation quickly!]\n“E-escape…? How…?”\n“Escape my ass! Shut up and stay put!”\n“Aah, aaah…!”\nI unconsciously muttered the hallucination’s words, and the thug who heard kicked me even harder.\nI could only cower and endure his malice and desire.\n[Hmm…. How should I explain this…? There’s something called mana… Do you know about it?]\nSomething inside the body? Mana?\nIt was a terribly shoddy explanation, but I had no choice but to listen to the hallucination’s words.\nTo escape this situation.\nClinging to it like a drowning person grasping at straws, I desperately tried to find that something inside my body the hallucination spoke of.\nI-is this it…?\n[You found it? Then try to focus your power with the feeling of making it go boom!]\nThe feeling of making it go boom, huh?\nAgain, with the vague instructions.\nHow do I make this explode?\nBut I obediently followed the hallucination’s words, and the result was shocking.\n“Aaaaaargh! My, my arm…!”\n“?! A-are you okay!”\n“Uuuurgh…! Shi-shiiit…!”\nSwoosh.\nSomething thin swiftly passed by in an instant.\n“…A thread?”\nI blankly watched the thread fall gently before my eyes.\nA single thin, small thread brushed past my vision.\nBut in the path the thread moved, a long cut was left behind.\nAs  if something sharp had passed through.\nIt was only natural.\nThe hand of the man hitting me, who had been standing in the thread’s path, was sliced off in an instant.\n“Y-you crazy…! A superhuman…! Shit…! Why were you just taking it…?!”\n“A-are you okay?!”\n“Worry about me later. We don’t have time for that! Hurry and kill that bitch before we both die!”\n“Eek, eeek?!”\nFaced with this sudden series of events, I was paralyzed with fear.\nIn a place I didn’t know, with someone’s voice in my head, in a changed body…\nSo, my actions were extremely simple.\nThe moment those thugs started moving to outright kill me.\nThe method the voice had taught me, I tried it again.\nThis time, with more force.\nSomething inside my body moved.\nViolently\nBoom.\nThe result was horrific.\n“…Huh?”\nThud thud.\nAlong with blood, dismembered bodies rained down on the ground.\nA few fingers from the man who had been about to punch me lightly tapped my cheek as they fell.\n“Urp, uurgh…!”\nWitnessing that horrific sight, I spent a long time retching.\nI’m not sure how I did it, but one thing was clear.\nI killed them.\n[Hmm, it was more shocking than I expected…?]\nAs I kept vomiting, unable to recover from the shock for a while, the voice in my head muttered.\n[Haa…. It’s a bit hard but…. Ta-da! Reader-nim? Look ahead! It’s okay now, right?]\n“Uurp….O, okay…?”\nI immediately regretted lifting my head at the voice’s words.\nThe corpses had vanished.\nNothing.\nAs  if they had never been there in the first place.\n[Reader-nim, hello!]\n“….”\nThat’s when I realized.\nThis wasn’t some auditory hallucination.\nIt was something far more dangerous.\n“Wh-what the hell…is this….”\n[Hehe, you used quite some power! You shouldn’t be fazed by killing a few puppets like them, Reader-nim!]\n“… puppets?”\n[Yep, puppets! Guys who can’t even get on stage!]\nAfter that, the voice in my head rambled on about things I hadn’t even asked.\nThat it brought me here, that it wants to make the world fun…\nI couldn’t properly understand most of what they were saying.\nBut there was one thing.\nOne thing I wanted to make clear.\n“…What should I call you?”\n[Hmm… Let’s see! Call me Author-nim!]\n“Author-nim…?”\n[Yes!]\nI looked around once more.\nThe bloody scene that was there until a moment ago had vanished as  if I had hallucinated it.\nThat was my first encounter with Author-nim.\nTranslator’s Corner\nMoving on, I’ll start using Reader-nim and Author-nim when they refer to each other.\nAlso, how should we refer to the actual author of the novel?\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "“Everyone quiet! I understand you’re anxious, but there’s nothing we can do about it. There have been a lot of incidents lately.”\nClaire looked at the security guards outside the classroom with an unsatisfied gaze.\nThere was a sudden increase over the past few days.\nThey were probably stationed by the higher-ups due to the various incidents.\nI could understand her position, but…\nWas it because seeing the anxious students made Claire feel bad?\nWhile trying to calm the students down, she seemed to have the most to say.\nPerhaps she was holding back to reassure the students.\n“As you all know, crimes targeting academy students have been surging recently. Of course, you’re superhumans and strong. But the villains are superhumans, too. It’s best to be careful.”\nHmm, that didn’t seem right.\nWhile Claire’s words were generally correct, the grunts of Übermensch were just ordinary people running around shooting guns.\nThey were probably people with low compatibility for enhancers.\nI don’t think superhumans would lose to such people.\nHowever, the fact that villains vastly outnumbered us was also true, so I decided to stay quiet.\n“So don’t pay attention to those people. Just focus on your lessons. Isn’t it because you look down on those kinds of people that you become targets for crime?”\n“…Indeed.”\n“If they’re the kind to become criminals, they’re not worth our attention, are they?”\nThe students’ dissatisfaction instantly shifted towards the villains.\nWow, the teacher was incredibly skilled.\nShe instantly turned the students’ anxiety into anger toward the villains’ arrogance.\nAs expected of a teacher.\nShe subtly gave the impression that the villains were weak, emboldening the students by implying they were being underestimated.\n“…And remember, finals season is coming up in a month. You’ll have to work harder to get good grades, won’t you?”\n“Ugh. I had forgotten about that.”\n“Please don’t remind us, teacher…”\nAnd her ability to completely deflate the students’ enthusiasm was no joke either.\nThe energized students from before were now letting out groans of frustration.\n“Finals…what will be on them?”\n[Hmm, I wonder? What should it be…]\nThe Author began pondering over this and that.\n…But this time, I had no intention of guiding or helping her.\nFrom drawings at the crime scene behind my back,\nThe sudden appearance of twelve Übermensch executives,\nThe Lyla incident,\nThe monster at the entrance ceremony.\nThinking back, there have been an awful lot of twists and turns.\nExcept for dangerous situations, I had been watching and letting the Author slowly grow. Still, I decided to cross the line a bit here.\nIs it dangerous? No, this might be my only chance.\nAt this rate, the final boss that the protagonist has to catch could become a universe-destroying monster on a tremendous scale.\nTo prevent that, I needed to determine how much I could influence the Author.\nSo far, I have only made suggestions to the Author. I had never twisted the story as I pleased.\nBut this couldn’t continue. What if an incident that was too big for me to handle occurred one day?\nWhat if the protagonist died due to a small mistake? What if the Author then gave up on this world?\nI had to try while there was still some leeway.\nTo test the limits of what the Author would allow.\n…And for one other purpose.\nSteeling my resolve, I slyly moved closer to Amelia.\n“Do you know, Amelia?”\n“Huh? Oh…no, I don’t. Didn’t the senior she couldn’t help us with this either?”\nRight. The final exam content was undecided since the Author hadn’t set the details.\nGiven the nature of this world, where undecided things get filled in accordingly, there was probably a setting where the contents were changed every year.\n“I didn’t know either, but apparently, the exam content changes yearly to prevent leaks. Sometimes it’s the same as last year’s, so it’s completely random.”\nSee? As expected, the exam content was completely random.\n…But that wasn’t the important part. What mattered was from now on.\n“Ahahaha. I heard a rumor about it.”\n“Really?!”\n“Yes. It seems credible enough. Apparently, the final exam is a tournament.”\n“A tournament?”\n“Yes. A tournament for all the freshmen.”\n[?! R-Reader-nim! What are you doing!]\nThe Author, realizing what I had done, was aghast.\nWell, of course. Determining the story’s direction is the Author’s role.\nBut she is not an all-powerful god. She is someone who transcribes the tales of this world. While she can modify the story to her taste, there are limits.\nEven a puppeteer cannot control billions of puppets at once.\nMoreover, the Author has to perform this puppet show for others. That’s where the opening lies.\nI must also be a major character in the novel. There’s no way she wouldn’t utilize me when I’ve been staying so close to the protagonist.\nAs such, for me to tell a story with no basis to Amelia, the presumed main heroine, wouldn’t make sense from a storytelling perspective.\nAmelia would naturally tell the protagonist what I said.\nBut if the exam format I described ended up being completely different?\nIn reality, this wouldn’t even be an issue.\nIt was just a rumor, no more than hearsay.\nBut in a novel, it’s a different story. Not some trivial tale, but one about the final exams. A narrative trigger.\nIn a situation devoid of any triggers, would readers not take the only information given as foreshadowing?\nNo, they definitely would. Without a doubt, readers would accept the trigger that the final exams are a tournament.\nOf course, it’s nullified if the Author doesn’t put it in the novel. But I had already told Amelia.\nThe protagonist and heroine would undoubtedly start believing my words to some extent.\nWell, one usually doesn’t think I’m saying it without any basis, right? They’d probably think I got the information from somewhere.\nI’ve also worked through various incidents with them until now, so I have a certain level of credibility.\nNow, they’ll act based on that information.\nThey’ll genuinely think the final exams are a tournament and prepare accordingly.\nIf the Author then comes up with a different exam format?\nThe narrative will be disrupted. Siwoo and Amelia would have been under the impression it was a tournament.\nThey would have prepared with a focus on 1-on-1 scenarios.\nTo proceed with something like monster subjugation under those circumstances?\nThe important heroine and protagonist would be thrown into confusion.\nUltimately, as I had said, the Author has no choice but to make it a tournament.\n…And that’s exactly what I was aiming for.\nIt was the only action I could take since the Author cannot modify events that have already occurred.\n“… I’ll keep that in mind. Well, I’ll be going then.”\n“Oh, uh…thanks.”\nAfter bidding Amelia farewell, I naturally exited the classroom and entered an alleyway.\n…I wonder how this will turn out.\nMy hands were trembling uncontrollably.\n[Well, a tournament doesn’t sound too bad!]\n“…Is that so?”\n[Yes…But you mustn’t do that again, okay? I’ll get angry! You told me to speak before acting, but what am I supposed to do if you do that!]\n“Haha… You’re right? My apologies.”\nI made it.\nA wave of relief and disappointment washed over me, draining all strength from my body.\nThis was different from the persuading and scolding I did until now.\nIt was an act of incomparable disrespect.\nThis was, quite literally, seizing and shaking the work itself.\nAn act of disrupting the narrative flow penned by the Author to suit my own tastes.\n…For her to forgive me for this. Does it mean she trusts me? Or is it that she cannot change me?\nWhile it was good that she didn’t get angry, I was a bit disappointed that I failed to achieve my second objective.\nWhat was that, you ask?\n…I wanted to know whether I was human or a puppet.\nThe truth.\nAm I a human who merely believes I am human? Or am I truly human?\nI couldn’t tell. So, I had hoped the Author would get angry.\nIf she could tamper with my settings, then I must just be a puppet.\nIf memories of a family I didn’t know suddenly appeared in my head, would that make me a puppet?\n…This body was created. A puppet molded by her hands.\nDidn’t she say so herself? She said she made my chest with her own hands.\nWhen a colorless puppet takes the stage, adjustments are naturally necessary.\nSo, when the academy student setting was added, I didn’t think much of it. It wasn’t me changing.\nIt was simply filling an empty space with something. My memories and recollections weren’t altered.\nIf a human is inside a puppet that resembles a human, is that a puppet or a human?\nI chose to believe I was human.\nMy life, my persona, wasn’t being rewritten like those puppets.\nI didn’t suddenly develop an inferiority complex like Lyla, nor did my life change in an instant like the nearly 2,400 villains.\nJust some minor background details were filled in.\n“Author-nim. What do you think it means to be human?”\n[…? That’s an odd question to ask.]\n“Hurry up.”\n[Umm, I don’t really know…?]\n“I believe it’s determined by whether one has free will or not. That’s what separates humans from non-humans.”\n[Free will?]\n“Yes.”\nIf the world moved according to the whims of an all-powerful god.\nIf people only acted and died as that god desired.\n…Could you really call that being human? No, you could not.\nIt would be no different from puppets. Pitiful puppets bound by the strings of fate.\nBelieving their actions are of their own free will, yet failing to realize they are merely being manipulated by the strings of fate. Pitiful puppets.\nUnlike me.\nI can defy her opinions, interact with her, and move as I desire.\nBut what about others? Their lives, fates, and thoughts change with a single line she writes.\n“Humans without free will are no different from puppets.”\n[…Is that so?]\n“Indeed.”\nWith a wry smile towards Author, who responded with a pained groan as if not quite understanding.\nBut I came to a conclusion.\nThe only humans in this world were the Author and I.\nIf I asked her if she could change me, she said yes…\n…I didn’t dare to ask such a question.\nAuthor’s Notes\nHmm, there was quite a bit of introspection today.\nEven I found it a little confusing…\nIf we assume there is a god who can change the world, would you consider that world to be fake? Or real?\nDepending on your thoughts, it will determine how you perceive Arte!\n…Will Arte’s psyche be influenced by Author’s added settings, or not?\nIs she human or a puppet who believes herself to be human?\nTranslator’s Corner\nQuestions like this make me happy I crunch numbers in school.\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "“Hmm…Arte Iris…Arte…Iris…”\n“What do you think?”\n“Why even ask? She’s extremely suspicious.”\n“…I thought so too.”\n“Anyone who doesn’t find this suspicious should be kicked out of the Association. There’s no way there would be such an incompetent person.”\nA man looked at the document with the investigation results of this case.\nThe outline wasn’t difficult.\nBecause the cause was an incident that was famous enough to be on the news.\nSome fearless villain infiltrated the academy, and the Exploration Club, which caught him, went out for external activities after receiving a reward.\nThe mountain villa they went to coincidentally happened to be the mountain where the Übermensch villain organization’s hideout was located, and they were attacked.\nThis was a rough summary of the story.\nIt was extremely suspicious.\n“…There are too many coincidences.”\n“The students who coincidentally caught a villain went to that mountain, the hideout of the organization the caught villain belonged to coincidentally happened to be there, and they were coincidentally massacred by someone at that time… Isn’t it a bit odd?”\n“That’s not all. Look at this.”\nHe pointed to the part indicating the students’ abilities in the light of personal information provided by the academy.\n“Siwoo, intuition. Amelia Lindberg, acceleration. Dorothy Springfield, weight reduction. These students are not a problem, but… Here, this girl.”\n“Arte Iris, thread manipulation… It’s like she’s the culprit herself.”\n“Right. Anyone can see it’s suspicious.”\nThe threads are presumed to be the cause of death for the corpses of the massacred organization. And an ability user who manipulates threads.\nLastly, the spider drawing was blatantly depicted. It was enough to be suspicious.\n“Then why aren’t you going to catch her?”\nTsk.\nClicking his tongue, he put a cigarette in his mouth.\nAnyone can truly see she’s the culprit.\nThat’s why it was suspicious.\n“Because it’s too obvious.”\n“Pardon?”\n“What kind of idiot would do things like this? Don’t you think it’s strange?”\nEven a ten-year-old child could see Arte Iris was the culprit.\nThat fact was just too obvious.\n“A villain who even draws on the wall that she’s the culprit, would she brazenly walk into the Academy as  if nothing happened?”\n“…You think she’s being framed.”\n“I don’t know about that, but it’s strange. Villains whose purpose is self-promotion are usually the type to enjoy causing confusion in the investigation.”\nShe’s the one who called herself Arachne and even left playful phrases.\nA villain like that couldn’t have handled things this sloppily. That’s what he thought. Based on his experience, this type tended to be smart guys.\n“It’s not like there aren’t abilities that can slash people similarly, right? Even I can slash about that much without any ability. Close to two hundred… although it takes too long.”\n“Disguising as a thread ability user to make people think Arte Iris is the culprit…Is that what you’re saying?”\n“Probably. Nothing is certain. It’s also possible that after all this speculation, Arte Iris was actually the culprit.”\n“Ugh, what a headache.”\n“You can say that again.”\nWatching the white smoke rising, he calmed his complicated mind.\nThis damn world is disgustingly complex.\nLong ago, about 500 years ago, there was no mana in the world.\nIf it were a world where every person had no abilities, tracking down criminals would be really easy. He envied the detectives of that era.\nEver since mana filled the world, he couldn’t recklessly act no matter how strong his hunch was.\nCases where he directly witnessed the murder scene and made an arrest, but it turned out to be the doing of an ability user controlling others’ bodies were quite common.\nAs  if CCTVs were nonexistent, an electricity ability user would disable all electronics and leisurely commit robbery.\nWhen he thought the alibi was sufficient, it was actually a clone ability user who could duplicate themselves.\nWhen he caught someone after being reported seeing them leave the murder scene, it was actually a transformation ability user in a state transformed as a stranger.\nThere were too many variables.\nOf course, the Association registered abilities in a database, but they didn’t know how much was possible.\nIn many cases, an ability user who could control a cup of water suddenly controls all the water in a pond.\nConcealment, invisibility, transformation, miniaturization, ability duplication, and so on.\nWith abilities perfect for framing others all over the place,  if you hastily identified the culprit, you were bound to get hit in the back of the head.\nHe wouldn’t have to care about ordinary crimes, but once he was transferred to the Association, it was definitely a metahuman* crime. Possibilities always had to be kept open.\n“Still, she remains the top suspect. We need to watch her.”\n“Should I assign someone?”\n“No.”\nRubbing out the burnt cigarette in the ashtray, he got up from his chair.\n“I’ll go.”\nThere was someone he knew at the school.\nHe could just wrap up some gifts and go.\n***\n“I can’t believe there was nothing in the academy database…”\n[He, hehe. I forgot…]\nNormally, this would be a time when I would have been very angry.\nIf a student with so little information entered the academy, one couldn’t help but find it strange. I should be angry like that, but…\n…I wonder  if she’s still holding onto what happened then. Unconsciously, such thoughts come to mind.\nSo I couldn’t reprimand the Author too harshly.\n[But it should be fine now that I added it, right?]\n“Yes, well. I suppose so.”\nAnd I didn’t care what happened to my background. Because that’s not what’s important.\n“By the way, what will you do for a month?”\n[Hmm, I wonder. What incident should I trigger…]\nA much bigger problem arose. There’s empty time until the final exams.\nAfter the final exams, there are events like summer vacation and the start of the second semester, so there’s leeway, but…\nWhat should I do now?\nWouldn’t it be awkward for the Author to skip nearly a month?\nShe’ll probably have to trigger some incident, but using important material right away feels awkward.\nWhile pondering future developments with the Author, I heard Teacher Claire calling for me.\n“Ah, you were here. Arte, do you have time now?”\n“…Yes, I do, but. What’s the sudden occasion?”\n“An old friend is looking for you. Said he has something to tell you.”\n“An old friend?”\n“…It might be a bit unpleasant, but don’t worry. Nothing will happen.”\n[Ooh, I sense an incident…!]\nThe sound of the Author rejoicing echoed in my ears.\n…An old friend? Of Claire?\nA feeling of unease came over me. Claire was set up as a famous retired hero.\nAn old friend of such a person. It felt like something was bound to happen.\nI should have been happy since some incident occurred, but I couldn’t just thoughtlessly rejoice.\n…I just wish nothing extreme would happen.\n***\n“Nice to meet you, student. I’m Lee Ha-Yul, in charge of metahuman crimes at the Association.”\n“I’m Arte Iris.”\n“Good…I can speak comfortably, right?”\n“As you please.”\n“I’ll be straightforward. …What happened at that mountain villa?”\nOf course.\nNo wonder I felt uneasy.\nFrom the moment talks of metahuman crimes came up, I had a feeling this would happen.\nIt has finally come.\n“If I say I don’t know anything, would you believe me?”\n“Haha. What an amusing joke. You think I’d believe that?”\n“No.”\n“Right. Then you know what I’ll say next, too.”\nOf course I do.\nHonestly, it felt a bit late.\nThe threads I couldn’t retrieve while hastily escaping the hideout.\nThe spider drawing in Übermensch’s hideout and my ability.\nIf they hadn’t come to find me with just these clues, I would have doubted the incompetence of this world’s authorities.\n…Personally, I wished they were a bit incompetent.\n“Ha-Yul. Are you threatening a student? You said you’d just have a civil conversation.”\n“That’s why I’m just having a conversation. It’s not a threat. That overprotectiveness of yours hasn’t changed, Claire.”\n“Arte is my student. Be careful.”\n“Yes, yes.”\nClaire hurriedly interjected.\nHmm. I’m grateful she’s looking out for me, but this person seems to have come to investigate the cubed steak incident at the hideout.\nI felt a bit sorry since they were my actions.\n“So, Arte. The Association sees you as a suspect.”\n“…And the reason you’re telling me that is?”\n“It’s a warning. A warning that it’ll be dangerous  if you make any rash moves.”\n“Ha-Yul!”\n“I got it, I got it. I’m getting up now.”\nI gave a small smile to him, who got up from her seat as  if chased away by Claire.\n“I appreciate your concern, but it won’t do much.”\n“…Is that so?”\n“Yes. Because I’m not the culprit.”\n“Ah, Arte… Right! My student is not the culprit! Get out quickly! Hurry!”\nWith a disgruntled face, Claire pushed me out of the room.\nRight. I am not the culprit.\nShe’ll find out the reason for that tonight.\n***\n– Next up on the news. Recently, there was an incident where hundreds of villains were massacred at a villain organization’s hideout. A suspect in that case has been arrested. The suspect is…\n“What the fuck.”\nHa-Yul blankly stared at the TV.\n…Arrested?\nThe culprit?\nSuddenly, the smiling face of the student he met today came to mind.\nThe person introduced as the culprit on TV was a man in his late 30s who looked completely different from her.\nAuthor’s Note\nI got caught by an acquaintance writing a novel.\nI did not just get caught; they learned everything, including what kind of novel it is.\nThey even said he’d been reading it for a week.\nThey’re probably reading now too. Fuck.\nTranslator’s Corner\n*Metahuman is a person with superpowers.

      "content": "“…Quickly, explain.”\n“Y, yes.”\nHa-Yul could feel his subordinate being wary.\nDid he look that upset? But this wasn’t the time to mind that.\nIt’s definitely suspicious.\nHer face at that time.\nThat smile.\nIt was a smile as  if she was certain she wouldn’t be caught.\nMost innocent suspects aren’t that bold in such situations.\nPeople who haven’t experienced it may scoff, asking why they would be flustered, but that’s the bluff of those who haven’t experienced it.\nIn reality,  if you get caught up in an incident you didn’t even do and are treated as a suspect, you become extremely flustered.\nThey say it’s easy to show various anxiety symptoms.\n…But what about her?\nForget anxiety.\nA confident smile.\nA voice filled with certainty that she won’t be caught no matter what happens.\nOf course, as he told his subordinate yesterday, she may not be the culprit.\nBut it was suspicious. Far too much.\nThat attitude, as  if she knew the culprit would be caught, kept circling in his head.\n“The suspect is a 38-year-old male, Elio Oland. His ability is Duplication. They say he can use the ability of a person he has seen for a day.”\n“He duplicated her ability with that?”\n“Yes. It’s a great ability for pinning accusations on others.”\nIf that man is the culprit, as my subordinate says.\nThen everything falls into place.\nBecause it means nothing was a coincidence, but an inevitability.\nIt’s not that the crime coincidentally occurred where she went, but that the man orchestrated it to be that way.\nHe deliberately drew the spider picture to frame the culprit.\nThe detailed motive will need to be investigated, but further investigation will be difficult.\nHe’s already caught.\nIt makes sense. It’s reasonable.\nBut an incongruity came over Ha-Yul.\n“…Why didn’t they tell us?”\n“Pardon?”\n“It was a case we were in charge of. Why did I have to first hear the culprit was caught on the news?”\n“…Oh, that. He turned himself in…”\n“Turned himself in?”\n“Yes. He became afraid of retaliation. Rather than disappearing without a trace by Übermensch, he said he’ll survive even  if in prison. That’s what he testified.”\n“Ha. Ridiculous.”\nNonsense.\nSince he massacred that many people, a death sentence is possible.\nExecution of the death penalty tends to reflect public opinion to some degree, so he may not actually be executed in light of killing villains.\nBecause public opinion will arise that he killed guys who deserved to die.\n…But will the Übermensch really sit still?\nThere are countless cases of people who picked fights with villainous organizations and died in prison.\nWhile they have to cover it up, the guards don’t care.\nThe atmosphere is that it doesn’t matter  if one or two people die since it’s just criminals killing criminals. All they have to do is the paperwork for a longer sentence.\n“He killed that many and thinks he’ll survive in prison? No way.”\n“… That’s true.”\nRevenge of blood for blood will occur.\nThey’re criminals anyway. Plenty of guys will not care  if their sentences increase a bit.\nThose kinds of guys, if compensated enough, can kill people and still have room to spare.\nHe’ll become a cold corpse before long.\nDoes he not know that? No, there’s no way he doesn’t know.\nFor an organization that big, no matter what prison he goes to, members of said group will be imprisoned there. Surviving is impossible.\nAnd that’s not all.\nForget prison;  if he had hidden and stayed quiet, Arte Iris would have been the top suspect.\nWhy did he turn himself in?\n“Why are you acting like this? Normally, you wouldn’t care and just check the next case.”\n“… It’s too suspicious. There’s definitely something.”\nIt’s a case of a villain killing villains.\nIf the culprit was caught, he normally went, “Ah, I see,” and moved on.\nBut her face flickered in his mind.\n“Didn’t I say villains who enjoy self-promotion cause confusion in the investigation and enjoy that?”\n“Yes, you did say that.”\n“Those guys tend to enjoy that kind of thing.”\nThere were more than one or two strange points.\nHer tone and expression were as  if she knew the “culprit” would be caught.\nActions that were conversely confusing because they were so suspicious.\nA case that concluded without coming to the main investigators.\nMoreover, the culprit framed Arte Iris as the suspect before abruptly turning himself in?\n…It was too suspicious.\n“Bring me more information on Arte Iris.”\n“What? But the culprit already turned himself in…Do you still think she’s the culprit?”\n“Yes. So bring me more, quickly!”\n“B-But we’ve already been stripped of authority. Since the investigation ended, we can’t investiga–”\nBang!\nIrritation surged, and he slammed the desk hard.\nHe felt a bit sorry seeing my subordinate startled by the sound. Did he hit it too hard?\n“Then I’ll investigate personally.”\n“Ye-Yes?! But…!”\n“I know, it’s dangerous. But I need to unveil the truth.”\nTo cause confusion in the investigation, she had someone turn themselves in.\nSuch thoughts circled Ha-Yul’s head.\n***\n“This is troublesome.”\n[Hmm? What is?]\n“That person yesterday. You heard right, Author-nim? Teacher’s friend.”\n[Ah, aah! That cool person!]\n…The impression is that he’s a cool person, huh?\nPutting aside his appearance, he’s an irksome obstacle to me right now.\nAfter school, Claire quietly approached and informed me.\nShe said he brought up meeting me the next afternoon.\nSince the culprit has already been caught, it’s obvious how he feels.\nHe still suspects me.\nI accepted it for now since rejecting it would obviously make it worse, but…\nWhy?\nWhy is he suspicious of me?\nHe must have learned that someone had them turn themselves in. In a state where the culprit has already emerged, what is there to suspect?\n…Is it because of my impression again? I feel like I’m always the only one accused of being suspicious.\n“Sigh. I had things I wanted to take care of while I had spare time.”\n[Things you wanted to take care of?]\n“I need to reduce Übermensch’s numbers a bit.”\n[Oh. I-Is that so…?]\nThere were too many of them.\nCurrently 11 executives and roughly 2,200 members.\nIf it goes on like this, the power inflation will become unmanageable.\nI wanted to trim them down a bit before Siwoo and Übermensch clash directly, but  if a strange person sticks to me, it’ll be a pain.\n“Hmm, should I kill him…?”\n[No! The teacher at the academy and her old friend, the cool detective, we can’t let a person like this go!]\n“Hnng…”\nThe problem is that the Author took a liking to him.\nShe seemed to have taken a liking to something about him. She’s in adamant opposition, saying killing is not allowed.\nEven  if I say I want to interfere by inserting settings to prevent him from interfering, she opposes.\nIt seems the Author quite likes that he’s investigating the case.\n“Sigh. It can’t be helped.”\nClap clap.\nThe Author mentioned she didn’t like how I pulled on Lyla’s leash, so I had to change it to her taste.\nThe only one who suffers is Lyla, who has to come at this small sound. Well, her ears are good, so I guess it’s fine.\nAfter a short while, Lyla arrived, her purple hair fluttering.\n“…What is it?”\n“I have a small favor to ask this time too.”\n“…?”\n“Are you good at drawing by any chance? No, it doesn’t matter  if you’re bad. You’ll become good at it.”\nI smiled brightly at her.\nIf throwing one person at him doesn’t dispel his suspicion, I can use another method.\n***\n“Hmm, do you have more business with me? I heard the culprit was caught.”\n“No, I just came to apologize.”\n“Apologize?”\nFor what?\nIt was an excuse.  If Ha-Yul apologized individually to every person he investigated, it would be a waste of time.\nIt’s just to gauge her reaction. He didn’t feel sorry in the slightest.\n“Yes. Since the culprit was caught too. I think I was too aggressive then, so I came to apologize. Sorry.”\n“No, it’s fine. The culprit wasn’t caught at that time, so it couldn’t be helped that I was suspected. You’re only doing your job.”\n“Arte…What a considerate child…! You’re kind as you look.”\nClaire smiled at Arte brightly.\nAre you blind?\nHe suppressed my urge to say that.\nThat remark is a bit…\nIf she looks kind, everyone in the world must look like a saint.\nAnyhow, Claire is someone unusually weak to students.\nShe’s completely infatuated.\n“Right. I came to say that today. Thanks for understanding.”\n“Not at all. Everything turned out well.”\nThat ended the conversation.\n…No particular gains, huh? As expected, there were limits with just a hunch.\nWas it a waste of time?\nAs Ha-Yul let out a small sigh, his subordinate called.\n“Ah, sorry. Let me take this call.”\n“No. Go ahead.”\n‘What is it? I’m sure I told him I was coming here.’\nDid something urgent come up?\nHis subordinate’s urgent voice came through as he put the phone to his ear.\n[H-Ha-yul sir! It’s big trouble!]\n“What is it? Speak quickly. What happened?”\n[A-Arachne! Arachne has appeared! 10 minutes ago, we got a report that a villain in an alley was dismembered! It’s the same as that time! A picture of a spider drawn in blood! Thread is left behind too!]\n“What?”\n[As expected of you, Ha-Yul-nim! You knew the culprit wasn’t caught!]\n“…”\n[The higher-ups are in an uproar right now! Wh-What should we do?]\nSuddenly, his gaze turned to Arte.\nHer slightly smiling face with red eyes exposed felt like she was sneering at me.\nShe clearly couldn’t hear what we were talking about.\n…But still, her smile, as  if things went according to plan, bothered him.\n“Wait. I’ll be right there.”\n[Yes, yes!]\n10 minutes ago, right after Arte Iris came here.\n…It can’t be.\n“Seems like big trouble has come up. How about you go quickly?”\n“…Right, I should go quickly. Thanks for the consideration.”\n“Not at all.”\nNo, he should return for now.\nIt seemed pointless to continue this battle of nerves any further.\nAuthor’s Notes\nThese days, I’ve been contemplating whether I should make emoticons.\nWhy, you ask?\nBecause it seems readers really, really want to smack “Author.”\nI was wondering  if it might be better to have an emoticon of “Author” getting smacked?\nTranslator’s Corner\nThe emoticons exist.\nI’m just too lazy to get it done.\nI’ll just put the link to the novel. You can check the illustrations there. Support Author-nim also  if you can.",

      "content": "“Tell me the case outline. Quickly.”\nHa-Yul started urging his subordinate to find out what happened.\nArachne appeared again?\nNo way. Arte was definitely with him.\nThere’s no way Arachne appeared…\n“Yes, yes. It’s just as I told you on the phone. A spider pattern drawn in blood and a dismembered corpse. It’s Arachne. The victim this time is also a villain. A guy wanted for rape and murder charges.”\n“The difference is?”\n“I guess it’s that he wasn’t finely minced. There was also no writing saying ‘Arachne was here’ like before. We’re also considering the possibility of a copycat.”\nA copycat?\nNo, that’s not it.\n…But there was no evidence it was Arte.\nHe may just be mistaken, and as Claire said, she may really be a junior working hard to become a hero.\nBut it bothered him too much. At first, he thought she wasn’t the culprit because it was too suspicious.\nNot anymore. Rather, it felt like she was mocking him.\nHer expression was like a spectator looking at a tiger trapped in a zoo cage.\nIf he broke out of the cage and approached, he would be a threat, but since that wouldn’t happen, she looked like a tourist enjoying herself to the fullest.\n“Damn it. She’s mocking me.”\n“Pardon?”\n“No, it’s nothing. …The possibility that there’s more than one Arachne?”\n“You think it’s a conflict between villain organizations?”\nHa-Yul nodded at his subordinate’s words.\nBecause if there’s more than one Arachne, it would be resolved.\nShe must have noticed he was suspecting her without any evidence.\nAs if mocking him, she threw one of her minions at him, and when he still didn’t withdraw his suspicion, she had someone commit a crime while meeting with him.\n…If you put it that way, it makes sense.\nBut is this really right?\nIs it okay to suspect someone like this just for being suspicious, without proper evidence?\nIs he just making it unnecessarily complicated? What if it’s really a copycat, and the real culprit is already caught?\nHis mind started getting complicated.\n…What should one do when they can’t think of anything to move the case forward?\nAfter pondering for a while, Ha-Yul decided to change his approach.\n“Sorry, but take over that case for a bit. I have someone I need to meet.”\n“What?! B-But I’m still not ready to be entrusted with this kind of…!”\n“I’m saying this because I trust you. I’m counting on you.”\n“…! Yes, I understand!”\nThis guy, he’s easy.\nIf you just sweet-talk him a bit, he readily takes on work, so it’s very convenient.\n“By the way, who are you going to meet?”\n“It’s nothing much. If I met the suspect, I should also meet the people around her, right?”\nEspecially if they’re related to the case.\nHa-Yul picked up the documents scattered on the desk.\n“First, I should meet this kid named Yu Siwoo.”\n***\n“So you came to me for that?”\n“Yeah. I thought you might know something.”\nSiwoo returned the badge proving Ha-Yul was an investigator from the Association.\nHe had completely forgotten about it since there was no particular news after that incident.\n‘He’s looking for the mastermind behind that incident.’\nHe really wished Amelia was here at a time like this.\nBecause she’s much better suited for this than him…Although she’s a bit extreme.\nWhat should he do?\nThe Investigator said he was chasing the culprit of that incident. Still, no matter how much he thought about it, only one person came to mind as the one he was chasing.\nIt must be Arte.\n“Since you and your friend were near the crime scene then. Do you know anything?”\n“No. We were too flustered by the attack to think about that at the time.”\n“Right…Was there anything strange? Like one of your friends being absent for some time.”\nHe’s blatant.\nHe didn’t seem to intend to hide the fact that he suspected Arte.\nHis sharp gaze was like glaring at a criminal, making Siwoo shudder unknowingly.\n“…Oh, sorry. My eyes are naturally a bit sharp. Don’t worry. I won’t arrest you or anything.”\n“Ye-Yes…”\n‘Did he think the reason I shuddered was because of anxiety that I might get arrested?’\nBut that’s not what he’s worried about.\nIs it really okay to drag this person in to stop Arte?\nHe’ll definitely be helpful. That’s for sure.\nThere’s no way an investigator in charge of metahuman crimes at the Association wouldn’t be helpful.\n…But there was something strange.\nWhy is he trying to get information from Siwoo?\nHe saw yesterday’s news too.\nThe one who brutally disposed of numerous villains, the so-called Arachne, was arrested.\nBoth he and Amelia had guessed Arachne’s identity.\nArte, who had been absent for a while, was their best candidate.\nThat’s why he was very disappointed when he saw the news that he was caught.\nBecause he thought he couldn’t expect help from the Association.\nBut why all of a sudden?\n“Anything is fine. If there was something suspicious, let me know.”\n“…Why are you asking about that?”\n“Huh?”\n“Arachne was caught. Wasn’t that on the news?”\n“Yeah, it was. There was an uproar. Have you seen the response online?”\n“…Yes.”\nThe internet was heated.\nWell, of course it would be. Troublesome villains died.\nNot just one or two, but a huge number of about 200.\n“Release Arachne…There was even talk like that going around.”\n“That’s…”\n“I know. It’s extreme. But many people hate villains.”\nYes, that’s right.\nPeople hate villains. No, it’s fair to say they abhor them.\nWhy should they feed and house criminals who steal their peaceful daily lives in prison?\nThey should just kill them all. Criminals don’t have human rights. Such talk is not uncommon either.\nMetahumans who are sitting en masse in cities. They were the reason for public unrest.\n… That’s the citizens’ evaluation of villains.\nIn the present where animosity towards criminals is endlessly high like this, even if caught, it’s clear they’ll live off their taxes in prison.\nHowever, Arachne neatly killed off those villains.\nA villain killer who hasn’t killed civilians and only slaughtered villains.\nThere’s no way such words wouldn’t come out.\n“But regardless of public opinion, a crime is a crime, and murder is murder. But let me tell you something…”\n“…”\n“Today, there was one more victim of Arachne.”\n“Wh-What?!”\nHis words surprised him, but Siwoo also realized.\nAs expected. The culprit is Arte. She was Arachne.\nBecause there’s no way the number of victims would increase when the culprit was caught otherwise.\n“It hasn’t come out in the media yet, but it will soon. The victim is also a villain…However, they plan to call it a copycat.”\n“A-A copycat?”\n“Yeah. If they boast they caught the culprit and admit their mistake a day later, the Association’s prestige will be in tatters. So this is the call the higher-ups made.”\nAfter saying that, he leaned into Siwoo and grabbed his hand as if pleading.\n“Even if it’s just to prevent more victims, if there is anything suspicious, please tell me. Even something trivial is fine. Physical evidence would be even better.”\n“T-Then…”\nIs it okay to say it?\nThat Arte is suspicious?\nWill he laugh it off as nonsense?\nIt seems the mastermind behind the recent sensational incidents is her…\nEven if he says that, will he really believe it?\nNo, even if he does, what can he do alone? Even if he believes it, will the Association?\nAs he closed his mouth to think about what to do, the Investigator waited as if to give him time.\nA silence instantly fell upon them.\n“What fun story are you talking about? Include me too.”\nAnd that silence was instantly shattered by an intruder.\n“Ah, Arte. Nice to see you.”\n“We meet again, Investigator. What brings you here today?”\n“I thought the students might be struggling psychologically after experiencing the attack. I called your friend over for a brief counseling session.”\n“Aha. I see.”\n“Then, Siwoo. You seem fine, so I’ll get going. If you need my help, contact me at this number.”\nInvestigator Lee Ha-Hul quickly left the scene.\n…An expression as if he didn’t expect Arte to come.\nAn expression as if his luck was bad.\n“Hi, Arte.”\n“Hello. You were talking with the Investigator…Did I interrupt something important?”\n“No, not at all.”\nHe realized the situation just now.\nThe Investigator only suspects Arte and has less information than them.\nHe didn’t think Arte would come if he talked to Siwoo in an open place.\n“Geez, that Investigator. There’s no need to worry that much about him.”\n“…Yeah. Even if I look like this, I’m an academy student. That much is no problem.”\n“Hehe. That’s cool. Well then, I’ll get going. You should go back soon too, right? It’s tense these days.”\nWatching Arte leave the scene as suddenly as she appeared, he suddenly thought.\n‘… I’m not surprised even when Arte suddenly shows up anymore.’\nHas he gotten used to Arte appearing out of nowhere?\nSiwoo let out a small sigh.\nHe never thought he’d get used to someone constantly watching him.\nHe’s lived a long life.",

      "content": "It had already been two weeks since Investigator Ha-Yul’s persistent investigation began.\nRealizing that things couldn’t continue this way, I made a decision.\n“Author-nim.”\n[Yes?]\n“Let’s just do it.”\n[…Are you sure? You said it was dangerous.]\nThat’s true. It is dangerous.\nThe investigation is still ongoing. And it’s not just suspicion–they are doggedly pursuing me with near certainty. It’s quite risky.\nBut there was no other way.\nThe Author opposed killing, and even after I sliced three more villains for an alibi, there was no reaction.\nHowever, not taking action makes even less sense.\n“We need to get rid of those villains while we have the chance.”\n[…Ugh.]\nThe Author let out a groan, unable to argue.\nWell, it was her fault after all.\nI tried to make it plausible, but 2,400 villains were way too many no matter how you looked at it.\nWe had no choice but to reduce the number.\n“And now that it’s come to this, we have no other option.”\n[No other option…?]\n“I think I used Lyla too much. There have been side effects.”\nI looked at the posts appearing online.\nThe comments on news articles were filled with remarks cheering Arachne.\nHa-Yul still suspects me after all this? After all I had done?\nI had utilized Lyla in a way that made me think that, but perhaps that backfired.\nSlicing up villains in other regions. Slicing them up during class.\nI even sliced up a villain inside a prison once, but they still wouldn’t let go of their suspicions.\nWhy? Why do they suspect me?\nBut I unintentionally found a clue in the comments of a news article I saw.\n“To think they’d be considering a secret organization or something like that.”\n[…Well, I suppose it’s not that strange. Since there were crimes everywhere.]\n“I guess that’s true….”\nWas it because I sliced up villains here and there to avoid suspicion?\nAt some point, the idea spread that Arachne may not be an individual but an organization.\n“It makes sense that they won’t let go of their suspicions now. They’ll think it wasn’t me who did it, but the organization I belong to.”\n[But don’t you think a secret organization sounds cool?]\n“Sigh….”\nThe Author seemed taken aback by my sigh.\nDid she think I would absolutely love it?\n…Well, to be honest, I do think it’s totally awesome.\nA secret organization, how cool is that?\nThen why did I sigh, you ask?\nI couldn’t help but sigh at the realization that my level had dropped to be on par with the Author…\n“So, you set things up well, right?”\n[Yep, yep! Three Übermensch executives and 600 villains! It’s perfect!]\n“Alright then. Shall we go?”\nRight now was the perfect time when that bothersome investigator wasn’t around.\nI needed to eliminate them quickly.\nThe goal was to bring the number down to around four.\nBut taking them out one by one would take forever.\nSo it’d be better to capture three at once.\nAs for the number of villains, well.\nFour executives and around 800 subordinates…\nI realized why the Four Heavenly Kings often appear in novels.\nThat seems to be the sweet spot…\n“Get caught, you say?”\n[By the investigator. Should we kill him? But it’d be such a waste.]\n“So that’s what you were worried about.”\nWhat  if investigator Lee Ha-Yul catches me, you ask.\nThat’s easy.\n“We just need to control the Association from the shadows.”\n[What?]\n“A secret organization that has deeply infiltrated the Association. Sounds awesome, right?”\n[…! Yes, super cool!]\nCan’t we just not care, even if we get exposed?\nSince we’re already being treated like a secret organization, why not actually make one?\nI don’t even know anymore.\nThey can try to catch us  if they want. Do whatever.\nIf pressure comes from above, they’ll probably give up.\nEven if they somehow find evidence now, it’ll be meaningless.\nI was slightly hesitant, thinking this could cause problems  if taken this far, but oh well.\nLeaving things alone seems like it’ll become even more of a hassle.\n…Ah, but wouldn’t it be a bit awkward if the secret organization only had two members–me and Lyla?\nIt’d be nice if some fun character popped out of somewhere.\n***\n“Hmph…How annoying. Why are they being so vigilant?”\n“You know why. With all the fuss lately about Arachne or whatever.”\n“Ah, that? Didn’t they say Marmo-nim died?”\nOn a dark night, inside an abandoned factory where people don’t go.\nArmed villains were chatting and laughing.\n“Yeah. It can’t be helped after going through something like that. Well, things will return to normal soon. That person wasn’t actually that strong.”\n“…True. Compared to the other executives, he was weak.”\n“So let’s just keep watch properly. We have three times as many people here compared to that place. There’s no way they would com–”\nClunk!\n“…? Did you hear a strange sound just now?”\n“I don’t know. Maybe you misheard?”\n“No, I definitely heard it. A sound from somewhere around here…Urk?!”\n“Guh…?! M-My breath…!”\nIt happened in an instant.\nA villain who heard a strange sound approached the ventilation duct to investigate, and another one suspiciously followed him.\nAnd the moment they got close.\nSwish.\nIn a flash, two  strands of thread tightened around the necks of the two.\n“G-Guh…! S-Spare….”\n“….”\nAfter a brief struggle, the two villains who went limp were effortlessly dragged into the vent by the thread around their necks to conceal their bodies.\n…This is harder than I thought.\nMoving inside the vents, like in movies or games, is just unrealistic.\n[How does it feel to directly experience the infiltration you love so much, Reader-nim?]\n“How does it feel, you ask? What’s the point of me saying it.”\nOf course it’s the best.\nIt was so much fun.\nHiding in the darkness and taking out enemies, that sort of thing.\nEveryone imagines it at least once, right?\nI thought I’d only be able to experience what I imagined right before I die through some hyper-realistic VR game or something.\nAlthough it was easier to get caught than expected, which was a downside, it had a thrilling field trip vibe.\n“I think 600 was too many after all.”\n[You said you could handle 600, Reader-nim!]\n“No, well…I didn’t expect security to be this tight…So I’m sorry about that.”\nOne thing I had misunderstood.\n…I thought I would have time to change  clothes.\nSince I saw how lax their guard was before.\nI figured I could slice up around 100, change  clothes, then slice more and change again.\nI thought I could just repeat that.\nBut that wasn’t the case.\nWas it because one executive died and hundreds of villains were killed simultaneously?\nOr because the news reported that the culprit was still out there slicing villains?\nTheir vigilance was considerable. Fighting like this would be tough.\nIf I barged in and fought head-on, I’d have to battle 600 continuously.\nI didn’t think I would lose, but the problem was not having enough  clothes.\nI had to change once, even when dealing with 200, so I couldn’t avoid it against 600.\nIf I kept fighting, I’d end up captured in a stark naked state without a single piece of  clothing.\nSo, I thought of infiltration.\nFirst, I’d take the heads of the top brass, then slowly take out the confused underlings.\nWithout guys to strategize, their morale and judgment would drop.\nThey wouldn’t realize I couldn’t fight anymore.\nI’d use that chance to change and then mop up the rest.\nSimple, right?\n“Hey, why aren’t you guys respond–Urk?!”\n“C-Crazy! Enem–Mmph! Mph! Mmmmph!”\n… If there’s one problem, it’s that the plan has already fallen apart.\nThe vent was noisier than expected.\nNo, I thought I could do it since they move around fine in movies.\nI was startled when it clanked as I was changing posture because crawling made my chest uncomfortable.\n-Bzzt…Respond.\n“Hm?”\n-Answer quickly… What’s going on? I’ll sound the alarm  if there’s no response within 1 minute. Hurry and respond!\n[Ah, we’re going to get caught like this.]\n“I guess so. Haha, what to do.”\nUnfortunately, it seems this infiltration game will have to end here.\nI didn’t have the slightest thought that I would die.\nThe Author needs me after all. She’ll make sure I survive one way or another.\nHowever, could I really go on living carefree after gleefully killing Übermensch members?\nI can’t fully trust her.\nShe could suddenly go, ‘Battered heroines are popular these days!’ and lop off my hand or something.\n…A mechanical hand seems cool, but I don’t want to live with one.\nShooting  energy beams from my hand is tempting, but I prefer having all my limbs intact.\nIt’s just a guarantee that I won’t die. There’s no promise that my limbs will remain unharmed.\nSo, I decided to stop the infiltration.\nI’d be in big trouble  if I tried to hide and got caught.\nThen what will I do from now on, you ask?\nIt’s not hard.\n“Let’s see, this is the center of the factory….”\n[All three executives are in the control room!]\n“Alright.”\nI tightened the nearly unused half-gloves.\n…I wanted to try this at least once.\nIt feels less exciting than I expected.\n“Okay then. I’ve come this far by infiltrating, so I should move on to the next stage.”\nEnemies are on all sides, and sneaking further is impossible.\nIn that case, I’ll just break through.\n“Shall we start the speedrun?”\nThere was a popular saying like this in a famous stealth action game.\nIf there are no witnesses, it’s a perfect assassination.*\nI decided to put that into practice today to see  if it’s true.",

      "content": "Leaving behind the room where four villains had their lives cut short in an instant, I stepped out into the hallway.\n…I guess I was pretty slow.\nVillains covering nearly the entire corridor were there to greet me.\n“Wow, are you all welcoming me? I didn’t know I was this popular. As expected, you all have an eye for beauty.”\n“Don’t let your guard down! She’s that Arachne! Form ranks!”\nHah, seriously.\nThese people have no sense of humor.\nI tried to have some conversation before fighting.\n…Well, whatever. I don’t have much time to spare either.\nI’ll have to get serious like they want.\n“Alright. It’s nice to see everyone diligently doing their job, but just one thing.”\n“…What is it? Surrender is useless. You won’t be able to leave here unscathed.”\nUgh, as expected.\nIt’d be hard to keep my limbs intact  if I get captured.\nIf I had stupidly kept infiltrating, the probability of me becoming a robo-Arte shooting energy beams from my hands would have exponentially increased.\nEven  if I used up all my  clothes until I was wearing my birthday suit, I couldn’t take them all out.\nIn that case, I need to instill fear.\nFighting is all about spirit.  If no one wants to fight me anymore, that’s good enough.\nIf 500 lose their will to fight, I only need to kill 100.\n“I’m a bit busy, so playing with all of you would be hard. If those who want a good time could gather, that’d be great.”\n“…Nonsense! Everyone, prepare for battle! Capture that wench! No, you can kill her too! Whoever kills her will get a bounty!”\nHmm, as expected, they won’t be scared by this level of threat.\nAlright, fine.\nIf they won’t be scared by this, I’ll show them directly.\n“…You might regret it later. This is your last warning.  If you want to live, jump to the side right now.”\n“Attack!”\nCountless mana-infused long-range attacks flew at the order, ignoring my words.\n“Sigh, okay.”\nFine.\nYou won’t listen to what I say, will you?\nUsing some of my stockings, I weaved threads to create a shield.\nBut as they say, fighting is a game of numbers. The shield that took attacks from dozens collapsed precariously as  if it would tear any moment.\nSeems they aren’t complete idiots.\nThis is a narrower chokepoint than I thought.\nEven  if hundreds of villains come at once, the number I can face at a time is limited.\nDid they order long-range attacks, being wary of that?\nThen I have no choice but to move too, right?\nI unwound the threads from the half-gloves I had deliberately left unused and stabbed them into the arm of a muscular man.\n“Guh, gaaah…?!”\n“Thread…?! E-Endure it! I’ll use you as a shield! Endure it no matter what!”\nHmm, bingo.\nAs expected, he was a physical reinforcement type ability user. He looked the part.\nI’d have had to find someone else  if he weren’t, but this is perfect.\nCirculating mana, I manipulated the threads. Then, leaning back, I pulled the threads as  if trying to drag him.\nThe guys who thought I would subdue and use him as a shield started using their heads.\nA huge villain planted his feet firmly into the ground so he wouldn’t get pulled towards me, and several villains pressed down on his shoulders next to him…?\nNo, why are villains cooperating? I really don’t get it.\nThe net of threads above my head was on the verge of breaking.\nWhat an extremely dangerous situation.\n…But those guys were mistaken about something.\nThat was never my intention.\nAt the same time as the sound of the net above my head ripping, I severed the tug-of-war I had been forcibly maintaining with mana.\nThe strength I had forcibly pulled using mana instantly dropped to the level of a feeble high school girl. Naturally, the balance of the tug-of-war was broken.\n“Wh-What?!”\nNow, quiz time.\nWhat would happen  if a fierce tug-of-war was going on and one side suddenly let go?\nThe balance instantly broke.\nAnd to think they were really trying to stop him from falling into my grasp.\nThis is why I was looking for a physical reinforcement ability user. As expected, I’m lucky.\nI held onto the rope and let myself be pulled by it, instantly closing the distance between us and avoiding the projectiles.\n“Ta-da!”\n“This crazy–”\n“Hello, and goodbye.”\nI separated the heads and bodies of the muscular man who brought me here and the villains who tried to restrain him as thanks.\nThe dumbfounded villains tried to attack, but my uniform completely unraveled at that moment, and the freed threads went wild.\n…The technique I decided to seal.\nI didn’t want to use it, but I had no choice.\nSince the goal is to scare them as much as possible.\n“Ptooey…Ah, dammit. Blood got in my mouth.”\n“Hii, hiiiek….”\nThe threads danced wildly across the corridor.\nThe clean and smooth floor became sticky with blood like it had never been washed.\n…Wow, there’s so many people.\nWhen I heard the number, 600 seemed like a lot, but seeing it directly, there’s even more.\nI sliced up so many, but there’s no sign of the number decreasing…\nI dusted off the beret that seemed to belong to the one who looked like the commander and put it on my head.\nEek, the blood is sticky and feels gross….But I need at least this much not to be naked, so I have no choice…\n“How unfortunate. I told you to scram  if you didn’t want to fight, but you didn’t listen.”\n“D-demon…!”\n“Demon sounds too impersonal. I have the cool name Arachne, you know?”\nIt’s not like I came up with it. The Author did.\nHmu*, your naming sense is quite good.\nI liked it more than I expected. Arachne.\n“So, well then…Will you fight or scram? Decide quickly.”\nGet scared, get scared, get scared, get scared…!\nPerhaps because I used a technique I didn’t want to, or maybe because I kept praying from the bottom of my heart?\nFortunately, the terrified villains started backing away slowly.\nThey all seemed greatly shocked by the process of making cube steak.\nThey panicked, thinking the same thing would happen to them.\nHaha. Bluffing tactic, huge success!\n…Well, I have no intention of sparing you even  if I let you go.\nI already blocked all the exits, you idiots.\nIt’ll be too late to regret not fighting after all the executives die.\n***\n“Ahaha…. You startled me. That ambush nearly got me.”\n“S-Spare me…! Spira, help me! I, I can’t move…!”\nWe’re screwed.\nSpira, an Übermensch executive with a snake lower half, one of the Twelve Zodiac.\nShe sensed defeat.\nThe ambush she thought was perfect had been shattered.\nAnd quite spectacularly at that.\n“W-Why…? Why did it fail? No, how…?!”\n“Hm?”\n“How did you kill Ovis…!”\n“Ah, this?”\nThe feeling of a comrade who was perfectly alive until a moment ago being called ‘this’ while limply hanging.\nThose who haven’t experienced it wouldn’t know. She didn’t want to know either.\n“Ovis’s wool could instantly absorb most attacks…”\nOvis, who had sheep’s wool, lacked attack power but could boast tremendous defense in certain situations.\nImpacts couldn’t pierce her wool and would lose strength after cutting a few  strands, so they were unable to harm her.\nShe prided herself in not being able to get heavily injured unless burned by fire or fried by electricity.\nYet that she now hung like a doll.\n“Ah, that’s why it’s so hard to cut. Physical nullification or something?”\n“How did you do it…!”\n“Aah, it was nothing much.  If it doesn’t work once, you just do it many times, right? You startled me, suddenly hugging me out of nowhere.  If one or two don’t do the job, repeat it hundreds of times until it does.”\nA chill ran down her spine at the appearance of that woman saying those words.\n‘She sliced the same spot that many times in such a short time…?’\n“Thanks to that, my  clothes are all used up too. Aah, dammit. It’s a relief there’s at least sheep wool. I almost became a pervert.”\nSpira, who didn’t hear Arte muttering afterward, now looked at her controlled comrade.\nKris, a pig beastman. He also had some physical resistance, and his weight-utilizing attacks were enough to turn a person into pulp.\n…Such a guy was trembling from a tiny thread.\n“I guess your strategy is good? A person with physical resistance hugs and attacks me one-sidedly. It’s quite ingenious  if I do say so myself.”\n“A-Are you mocking me…?”\n“It was good that you tried to ambush in case it failed too.”\nReeking of blood all over yet smiling brightly, she controlled Kris. No, rather than control, she might be toying with him.\n…Because she was moving him around and observing with a curious look while poison from Spira spread through his body.\nShe attempted the second ambush as soon as Kris failed.\nShe used him as a shield and quickly escaped.\n“Stop, stop…! The poison is spreading! What do you want?! Information?! Or money?! Tell me what you want! I’ll give you anything!”\n“Ah, will you really give me anything?”\n“Yes! I’ll give you anything! Hurry! Tell me what you want!”\n“Your life.”\n“…Guhek?!”\nIt was the end of Kris, who had feared the tiny thread by his ear.\nHe had proudly said his thick layer of fat would make even a thread like that harmless.\nThe tiny thread suddenly dug into his ear, and soon Kris collapsed with blood flowing from his eyes and nose.\nDid she scramble his brain with that thread?\nHer face automatically paled at the horrific imagination.\n“Things like your money or information are meaningless to me. What I want is your death, after all.”\nIn an instant.\nTruly, in an instant, the two executives who had ambushed her died.\nThey were people with quite a lot of combat experience too.\n“Now, you’re the only one left…What should I do.”\nHer mind went blank.\nWhat do I do?\nWhat do I have to do to survive?\n…The contemplation didn’t take long.\nBecause she felt she wouldn’t survive no matter what she did.\nSo, she decided to do as her instincts told her.\n“Please spare me!”\nLike a snake, she decided to lower her head to the ground.\nAuthor’s Notes\nWriting the scene of killing a pig made me crave meat…\nIt’s pork belly today.",

      "content": "“…?”\n“I-If you spare me, I’ll do anything! Please!”\nWhat is this now?\nFor a moment, I couldn’t understand the situation at all, so a gap was exposed. Luckily, it seemed the woman with her head buried in the ground didn’t notice.\n“Woah… You want to live that badly?”\n“Yes! Yes! Sh-Should I lick your feet?! Master!”\n“No, that’s not necessary.”\n“Understood! Master!”\nWhat’s with this ‘Master’ thing?\nIf someone saw this, they might mistake her for a dog beastman, not a snake one.\nNo, since her lower body is a snake, there wouldn’t be confusion, but her behavior…\n“Hmm, what to do. I was going to kill–”\n“Hii, hiiek! Don’t kill me! I’m good at laundry! I’m good at cooking and cleaning too! Can’t you use me as a housework slave?!”\n“…”\nMaybe she’s in a state of panic. It doesn’t seem like my words are getting through.\n…My mood sank.\nDoes she want to live that badly?\nI planned to kill her mercilessly if she showed signs of attacking or resisting.\nBut seeing her wanting to live this desperately made me feel strange.\nNo one who charged at me before had ever acted this cowardly just to survive.\n[Reader-nim, are you hesitating? You can just kill her. That’s why you came here, right?]\n“… That’s right. Yeah.”\nJust as the Author said.\nThat snake beastman is an obstacle to the story’s development. A disposable puppet whose existence doesn’t matter.\nShe’s just one of the over 2,400 villain puppets created by the Author’s setting.\nPlus, if I dragged this on too long, the villains who overcame their fear might suddenly rush in.\nThen that woman, gaining confidence from numerical advantage, might aim for my back again.\nIt’s easier and more definite to kill. There’s no reason not to.\n…Right, that’s it. Killing is easier.\n[…? Reader-nim?]\n“Can you hide those legs?”\n“Yes, yes! It’s possible! I can hide them! Please don’t kill me!”\n“You said you were good at housework?”\n“Yes, yes! Leave it to me!”\nI threw her various questions I was curious about.\nPerhaps sensing she could survive by answering those questions, she smiled brightly and spoke.\n[Reader-nim?!]\n“How would you look in a maid outfit?”\n[Uuu, that’s just an excuse! Why are you suddenly like this?!]\nRight, I know. It’s an excuse.\nThe over 2,400 villains were born from the Author’s mistake. My current goal is to eliminate 1,600 of them.\nThere was no need to deliberately spare one. Especially if it’s someone with an important executive position.\nMoreover, it’s a very dangerous action that could cause a clash with the Author. Killing her is the wise move.\nB, but…\nHer bright smile overwhelmed me.\nAs if she noticed my gaze, she buried her head in the ground again.\nBowing her head and smiling like that to the enemy who killed her comrades just to survive.\nI felt complicated.\nAs if she wasn’t a puppet but a living person.\nNot a cool character in a novel who gets angry at their comrades’ deaths, but a realistic person thinking of their own survival.\nI’ve never been put in this situation because of the typical resolve not to betray their comrades.\nSeeing her desperately clinging to life made my insides churn as if I were seeing something alive.\n“…Alright, how about being a member of a secret organization?”\n[Ye, yes…? A secret organization?!]\n“This is perfect timing. I was feeling it was a bit empty with just two members.”\n“…Huh?”\n“Welcome, Spira. From now on, you are a member of Arachne. Nice to meet you.”\n“What?!”\nI was overthinking.\nThis one is definitely a puppet. I’m sure of it.\nSo this is my whim.\nJust a trivial whim.\n[Hmm, certainly having a secret organization with only two people is a bit… Alright! A traitor from a hostile organization in a secret organization… that’s cool, too!]\nFortunately, the Author didn’t seem to have any particular complaints.\nSighing in relief, I glanced at Spira, who had now become a comrade.\n“Well then, here’s your first order, Maid.”\n“Yes, yes! What should I do?!”\n“Go outside the room and kill your former comrades.”\n“?!”\n“…You can’t do it?”\n“N-No! I’ll do it!”\nAfter confirming Spira hurriedly went out of the room, I tossed aside the heavy wool.\nUgh, it was too hot.\nIt was heavier than I thought.\n“Ha, haa… This is really heavy.”\n[It looks super fluffy. I want to hug it too.]\n“Of course, the texture felt nice, but it was extremely hot, you know?! Even in this state! …No, more importantly, give me clothes quickly!”\n[Ah, right. I almost forgot.]\nThere are other things to forget!\nI was buried in wool without wearing anything!\nI almost got caught being naked!\nI only had enough thread left to kill Spira.\nIt wouldn’t have been enough if she had resisted fiercely or things had gone wrong.\nExactly one time. I only had enough for one attack.\n“It was fortunate that her personality prioritized her own survival.”\nI let out a small sigh.\n***\n[Arachne_Real-time_Update.jpg]\n(Gore warning photo)\n(Photo of an abandoned factory filled with red blood)\n(News portal hyperlink)\nÜbermensch or whatever villain organization members massacred, one man and one woman thought to be executives dead. Last one missing.\nAre they gods?\nOr perhaps Angels sent by God to fulfill our wish to massacre those trash villains?\nComments – 1176\nAmelia lowered her phone and checked the comments.\nA gloomy voice emerged from Siwoo, who had been checking the news over her shoulder.\n“Praise here, praise there… Everyone’s excited.”\n“Well of course. The ones they hate were literally erased.”\nSiwoo seemed uncomfortable with the heated atmosphere.\nPeople with similar sentiments sometimes posted comments but were immediately beaten down by public opinion and disappeared.\n“I don’t get it.”\n“You must know well why they’re doing this.”\nSiwoo seemed unable to understand the people praising them despite hundreds dying, even if they were criminals.\nIt’s probably because he directly killed a villain and knows the weight of a person dying.\nHaving realized the weight of life, he seemed to reject the fact that so many died instinctively.\nEven if they were a criminal group.\n‘…But I think I know why these people are acting like this.’\n“It’s because quite a lot of people have been harmed by villains, big or small.”\n“That’s…”\n“I know. Those people may not have caused that harm, right? But what can you do? Do you think the people’s hearts will be easily soothed? In their eyes, they’re all the same villains.”\nMost citizens are non-supers. And most villains are.\nThus, citizens were inevitably prone to getting caught up in their attacks.\n“They think the punishment is low compared to what they suffered. Blood for blood. Tears for tears.”\nOften, villains who killed were quickly released.\nDue to the chronic shortage of metahumans.\nIt’s not common, but sometimes, they are released on the condition of serving on the frontlines for a period through a plea deal.\n“Villains are released through plea deals, but the dead don’t come back, right?”\n“…But the survival rate of villains on the frontlines is extremely low. It’s very hard to survive. Even the heroes there despise them, so they don’t help when they’re in danger. They get isolated.”\n“The citizens know that too. But it’s not like no one comes back at all.”\n“…”\nIt’s an efficient method.\nThe Association increases lacking super manpower through plea deals, and villains get a chance at freedom instead of rotting in prison for life.\nBut emotions don’t care about efficiency.\nCitizens directly harmed by villains couldn’t tolerate villains getting a chance at freedom at all.\nEven though the number of villains surviving the frontlines is extremely small, they can’t accept that a tiny number of villains return to society.\n“It can’t be helped. If some villain killed my parents and I heard they were returning to society, I’d act the same.”\n“…Yeah. I get that too. I’m not judging those people.”\n“Then what don’t you get?”\nAmelia thought Siwoo disliked citizens being in a festive mood celebrating villains dying.\n“You know, all this…It must be Arte’s doing, right?”\n“…Probably? They say Arachne is a group, and Arte is likely a member.”\n“Then how do you think Arte feels?”\n“Huh?”\nIt felt like he was speaking nonsense.\nHow Arte feels?\nHow would she know that?\nShe wanted to brush it off lightly, but Siwoo’s expression looked serious, so I couldn’t easily move on.\n“When I killed someone…If Arte hadn’t helped me, I would’ve had a hard time for a while.”\n“Yeah. You would have.”\n“Then, would Arte, who killed that many people, be okay?”\n“What are you…”\n“I don’t know how Arte feels right now.”\nHow Arte Iris feels, you say.\nHe’s talking nonsense.\n“Obviously it wouldn’t matter to her. She’s a villain. A villain, you understand?”\n“…Is that so?”\n“Yes, so stop thinking unnecessary thoughts and think about how to sweet-talk her. Or find the artifact first.”\n“Got it.”\nHowever, they didn’t make much progress that day.\nSince Siwoo wasn’t focusing, she kept nagging him.\n_______________________________________________________________\nAuthor’s Comment (Afterword)\n10,000 readers! Yay clap clap!\nTo celebrate, I sent an email to Nobel-chan asking for a cover. But I just said, ‘Give me a cover’ for now.\nPerhaps it’s because I already poured all my energy into making the first cover, but I can’t even think of what kind of cover I want.\nWell, I don’t know if I’ll be able to decide.

They were way stronger than we thought. We underestimated them too much. We couldn’t know since that guy was the one who died first.”\n“Marmo was always a bit weak.”\nIn a dim conference room.\nThe ownerless chairs placed around a table depicting twelve animals caught the eye.\nIt was usually bustling with people.\nWas he the only one who felt that atmosphere? Everyone seemed quieter than usual for some reason.\n“…So? Boss isn’t here yet?”\n“She told you not to call her ‘Boss.’ Don’t you remember?”\n“No, even if we say Twelve Zodiacs or executives, this organization was created by that person in the end. What’s wrong with calling the Boss, Boss?”\n“It’s not a big mistake, but didn’t she ask you not to? She said to treat them as an equal.”\n“…Ah, welcome, Boss.”\n“Sigh. You never change.”\nSpeak of the devil.\nAs he had silly thoughts, the Boss with beautifully shining jade-colored horns approached their seat.\nHe thought she would sit, but why isn’t she?\n“Boss? I believe your seat is there, right?”\nIgnoring his question, Boss walked towards the window and suddenly opened the curtains.\n“What are you, children of darkness? Get some sunlight.”\n“Aah, my eyes! Boss, we’re villains, so we are children of darkness! Close the curtains quickly!”\n“…Is that so?”\nEveryone suffered from the sudden sunlight, so she smiled awkwardly and closed the curtains again.\nShe’s still learning unnecessary things—things she doesn’t need to do. He knows she’s trying to be considerate of the other members, but she doesn’t have to do this.\nAfter a ruckus, the heavy atmosphere lightened. Still, everyone sobered up at a single phrase uttered by the Boss.\n“Four died.”\n“…”\n“Wow, I didn’t know it would feel this empty with a few people gone. It’s scary how I got used to the noise.”\n“Boss…”\n“I know, I know. We’re villains, and it wouldn’t be strange for us to die or get arrested at any time.”\nBoss momentarily stared at the empty chairs and explained why she called the emergency meeting.\n“Everyone listen. The plan went awry.”\n“Yeah, it did. What will we do now? Didn’t we decide to raid the Academy?”\n“Yes, we did…And there will be no changes to the plan. We’ll push through as is.”\n“What? But that’s–.”\n“Assuming everyone was present, you thought it was possible? But it seems more unlikely now. I know that too. But you also know our goal, right?”\n“…Yeah, I know it well.”\nIs there anyone here who didn’t?\nThe Secret Room the Boss found by chance in the memoirs of the first principal.\nAnd the artifact sleeping there.\nThat was the key to the organization’s ultimate goal.\n“We need to get that to achieve our goal. That’s why everyone was happy when we converted that kid, right? Because we thought we could easily get there.”\n“In the end, they died without being of any use.”\n“Phew, yeah. It would have been nice if they had just stayed alive.”\nThe Boss, sighing at the other executives’ words, declared.\n“We need to find the artifact hidden inside the Academy. Only then can we fulfill our wish. We can’t delay the plan any further.”\n“…All because of Arachne.”\n“Right. Those annoying bunch. Seems like they really hate villains.”\nWell, it’s understandable.\nNo matter how nicely you put it, villains are undeniable criminals.\nNot just criminals but ones so strong that victims have no way to retaliate.\nEven the authorities don’t attempt to catch Arachne, except for a few.\nTch. Aren’t those guys villains too? Why don’t they take action?\nIs it because it’s convenient? That’s probably the most likely possibility.\nThey’re taking care of the troublesome guys that they didn’t want to deal with.\n“It would be right to get rid of them and raid the Academy, but…”\n“No. The damage will be too big. We already lost a third of our members. We would need to gather all of our members. You think the authorities will let that slide?”\n“…Not a chance.”\n“It’s enough for everyone to gather on the day of the raid.”\nThe chatter of Tiger and the Boss echoed in his ears.\nThey must be discussing how to steer the organization in a better direction.\nOther executives’ voices started mixing in, but he closed his ears and lowered his head.\nHe doesn’t know much about such difficult matters.\nThe Boss will take care of it. They always have.\nI’m the Boss’s loyal dog. It was enough to always be by their side.\n“…Ani. Ani!”\n“Ah, Boss.”\n“I told you not to call me Boss. Anyways, you fell asleep during the meeting again. I said it was important.”\n“But I don’t know much about that stuff.”\n“Sigh, what am I to do with you.”\nEven when the Boss sighed, he was simply happy.\nSince she woke me up, they’ve made the final decision.\n“Is it decided?”\n“…Yeah. We’ll raid the Academy.”\n“When?”\n“Start of vacation. Security will be lightest then.”\n“I see.”\n“…Ani, you never express doubt.”\n“Mir has always been right.”\nHe burrowed into the Boss’s arms as she smiled bitterly.\nHe was the Boss’ loyal dog.\n***\n[They decided to launch an all-out attack at the start of vacation!]\n“…What?”\n[Übermensch! Attacking the Academy in full force at the start of vacation! The Academy in flames!]\n“Are you crazy?”\nAh, my mistake.\nI unintentionally blurted out my thoughts.\nThe fortunate thing is that the Author was startled by my intense reaction?\nI was nervous for a moment thinking she would get angry, but thankfully, she didn’t.\n[W-Why…?]\n“What school story has the Academy burning on the first day of vacation? You’re not even writing the vacation event?”\n[Eh, it won’t burn down! The protagonist will coolly stop everything!]\nNonsense. How will he catch all eight? Are you nuts?\nNow that it’s come to this, I need to be firm.\nThe most important thing is persuading the Author.\n…I would lose if I had to face the 8 executives alone. I’m certain.\nEven when catching three, if the bluff hadn’t worked, what state would I be in now?\nBut you’re saying Siwoo has to face the villains all at once? Are you joking?\nIf it’s an all-out offensive, strong villains will definitely pop out in droves.\nSiwoo hasn’t grown enough for that yet.\nI can see he’s definitely getting stronger, but…\nHe hasn’t shown amazing growth to the point of being called a protagonist.\n“It won’t work. The protagonist hasn’t grown enough for that yet.”\n[But… Wouldn’t it be possible?]\nPossibly my foot. You’re talking nonsense.\n“It would be possible if Siwoo suddenly gained an ability like becoming a phoenix or something. But Author-nim, you can’t do that, right?”\n[Uh, what?! I, I can’t! Yes! Because it would lack plot coherence!]\n…What? Why are you so surprised? I know that too.\nThe most important thing in a novel is coherence.\nIn reality, people would just grieve if someone suddenly died from a random murder, but novels can’t do that.\nThe moment the lead suddenly dies from a random murder, the readers immediately explode.\nThat’s why novels need to consider coherence even more than reality.\nThis is why the Author isn’t omnipotent. She is ultimately in the position of writing a novel.\nYou can’t just stuff in three or four abilities while saying, “I wish the protagonist was stronger.”\nSince the setting allows only one ability per person, playing favorites and giving the protagonist various abilities will shatter the coherence.\nIt’s impossible unless sufficient plot coherence is built up like a strengthened ability gradually evolving into a new one.\n“It can’t be helped, Author-nim. Does it have to be the start of vacation, no matter what?”\n[I wanted to coolly catch villains on the first day and write lots of slice of life during vacation…]\nYou have a plan?\nI thought you were speaking without any thought, as per usual.\nIt’s a plan grasping at straws, but now that the whimsical Author has made a plan, it’s a bit tricky to interfere.\nIf I stubbornly tried to bury this plan, it was clear as day that there would be backlash.\n… It’s not like a universe-destroying spaghetti monster from space flew in, so I’ll stop here.\nIt’s not like there’s no solution.\n“The final exams are soon. And a bit after that is the start of vacation, right?”\n[Yes!]\n“Let’s think about how we can reduce the villains in the remaining time.”\n[Okay…]\nThere was no time.\nI had to eliminate the four executives before the vacation began, no matter what.\n***\n“Argh, what are you doing. Try again.”\n“Ah, Arte…! Wanna go hang out with me?”\n“You lack confidence! Again!”\n“…Hey, Amelia. Are you sure we really have to do this?”\nSiwoo grew resentful of Amelia.\nWhat the heck is this?\n“I’d rather search for the secret room…”\n“I saw you couldn’t focus at all! Practice this instead! This seems more likely to work anyway.”\n“…”\nWhere does Amelia’s baseless confidence come from?\nSiwoo suddenly grew curious.\n“Hey, Amelia.”\n“Yeah?”\n“What if, just what if. What if Arte isn’t really in love with me? What will you do?”\nAmelia was about to say something with a sullen expression, so he hurriedly added.\nHe was tired of hearing the obvious–that it must be love and whatnot.\n“If! Just if!”\n“Do I really need to answer that question?”\nNo, did he say something wrong?\nIs it really love? Even though she doesn’t ask to hang out even once?\nAt first, he thought maybe it was, but isn’t it natural to grow doubtful again?\nAmelia answered my question as if it was very easy.\n“Even if Arte hasn’t fallen for you, there’s no problem, right?”\n“…Why is there no problem?”\n“Because you can make her fall for you.”\nSiwoo was at a loss for words.\nWhat kind of confidence does Amelia have to say things like this?\n“So prepare again! Come on, one more time! Naturally!”\n“Sigh…”\nHe had no choice.\nIt was none other than him who touched Amelia’s nerves while imagining how Arte would feel.\nHe decided to go along so she wouldn’t throw a fit.\n“Arte, wanna go hang out with me?”\n“Oh, this one’s pretty good. Again!”",

      "content": "“Hey, Arte.”\n“Yes?”\n“Wanna hang out with me?”\n…What is he talking about now?\nHe should be saying this to Amelia. Why is he telling me this?\nTaken aback, a negative reaction slipped out of my mouth.\n“Umm, we have final exams coming up soon.”\n“I know. But you’ve been through a dangerous incident, right? I thought it might be nice for us to go out somewhere together…Amelia agreed to come along, too.”\n“Ah, I see.”\n[A thrilling harem event! This is great too!]\nWhat, so that’s what it was. So the three of us going together?\nThey probably wanted to go on a date alone but were too shy, so they’re trying to bring me along.\nNo wonder Amelia has been hanging out more with Siwoo than I have lately. Looks like she’s solidifying her position as the heroine.\nI half-listened to the Author’s absurd description of a “harem” and considered the novel’s development.\n…It seems alright to take a short break.\nThe protagonist hasn’t had a chance to rest to his heart’s content so far, and resting occasionally may not be so bad.\n[Amusement park! Aquarium! And, and…!]\nThe Author also started thinking of this and that on her own.\nUltimately, the Author will likely urge me to participate, and there’s no point in refusing here anyway.\n“Sounds good.”\n“…What?! Is that okay?”\n“Inviting me and then being so surprised when I accept…Are you trying to hurt my feelings? Don’t tell me you thought it was only to be polite?”\n“Oh n, no! I was just surprised…”\nHis reaction was unexpected, slightly irking me, so I teased Siwoo.\nThere’s no way the protagonist would behave like that, so it’s probably genuine goodwill.\nI’m not sure if he’s considerate of me or if I’m just an extra to Amelia, but just inviting me shows his thoughtfulness.\n…He didn’t just say it for that, right? Please tell me that’s the case.\n“Where are we going?”\n“The amusement park…How about it? This weekend.”\n“Aha, that sounds fun. Great!”\nCan superhumans even enjoy amusement parks?\nThat thought briefly crossed my mind, but I decided to put my worries aside.\nWell, he must have a reason for suggesting we go out.\n[Amusement park…! Sounds fun. I bet there will be lots of thrilling episodes.]\nThe Author seemed to think the amusement park itself wouldn’t be fun, but the episodes that would unfold there would be.\nAn amusement park, huh. I don’t think I’ve been to one apart from when I was little. It’ll be fun going after a long time.\n“Then send me the details by message!”\n“Sure.”\nSiwoo, who had looked flustered, returned to his original seat as if he had finished his business.\nThen he conversed with Amelia and soon got smacked on the back by her.\n…?\n“Oh, it’s nothing. Arte.”\n“Okay…”\nAmelia noticed me watching, waving her hand as if to say it was alright.\n…Is it really nothing?\nShe seemed to hit him at full force…\nWhy is she suddenly doing that? There’s no reason for Siwoo to get hit by Amelia…\n“Ah, that must be it.”\nIt seems Amelia had already made plans to hang out with Siwoo. Still, he unnecessarily dragged me into it, so she got mad.\nIt’s nice to hang out as friends, too, but it was probably a chance for them to get closer to each other.\n…Hmm, maybe I shouldn’t have agreed to go.\nI should have just declined and secretly observed from the shadows. I’m starting to regret it a bit.\nI looked at Siwoo with sympathy, who was soon put in an armlock by Amelia and suffering.\nHe lacks awareness, so he has it tough.\nBut it’s the protagonist’s fate.\n***\n“Ugh, seriously. I can’t take this.”\n“I said I was sorry.”\n“Why did you bring me up there! I told you two to go, just the two of you!”\n“…”\nAmelia dumped a bunch of complaints on Siwoo.\nWell, yeah.\nHe indeed messed up. He unintentionally brought Amelia into it in his nervousness.\nOriginally, the plan was for just him and Arte to go, but he ended up unintentionally involving Amelia.\n‘But still, she’s not in a position to complain.’\nSiwoo couldn’t hold back the words spilling out of his mouth.\n“…Seems like you have no conscience, Amelia.”\n“Wha-What?! What did I do!”\n“No, if you don’t know, then never mind.”\nHe said that, but Amelia seemed inwardly embarrassed too.\nHer face turned bright red as she unnecessarily raised her voice.\n‘That’s right, you should be embarrassed.’\nArte hasn’t even arrived yet, but who looked around excitedly with sparkling eyes, saying the amusement park is amazing?\nShe even bought a weird heart-shaped headband from somewhere, and it’s plain as day how excited she is.\n“Th-That’s…! I-I’ve never been to a place like this! It can’t be helped!”\n“Eh~, I see.”\n“Ugh, so annoying…”\n“…Oh dear, am I a little late?”\nWhile seizing the rare opportunity to tease Amelia and vent his pent-up frustration,\nThe voice of the person they were waiting for was heard, and Amelia hurriedly turned her head in that direction.\n“No, no! You’re not late! Come on…over. Oh my gosh. Arte, you’re so pretty.”\n“…You think so? I’m not really sure. Someone I know picked it out for me.”\n“It’s super pretty!… Hey, what are you doing? Hurry up and compliment her!”\nPoke, poke.\nAmelia whispered while subtly poking Siwoo’s back where Arte couldn’t see.\nOnly then did he come to his senses and open his mouth…But what should he say?\nAfter hesitating, the line that came out was one that even he thought lacked sincerity.\n“…You look pretty. Arte. I almost didn’t recognize–Ack.”\nAmelia strongly jabbed his back.\nHe didn’t need to ask why this time.\nIt was a bit lacking to be called a compliment. Fortunately, Arte didn’t seem to mind.\n“Thank you. It seems you two have been enjoying yourselves already, so what should we do first?”\n“Hmm, how about that? They say it’s a ride made just for superhumans, and it’s so fast you have to wrap yourself in mana just to withstand it!”\n“…Wow, is that thing really a ride?”\n“Apparently, there are cases where ordinary people try to go on it to experience it, and accidents happen…Well, we’re superhumans, so it doesn’t matter to us! Let’s go!”\nIt’s Arte’s casual clothes. I was surprised.\nShe always wore a pure white hoodie over her school uniform.\nI naturally assumed she would be wearing something like that today too.\nShe is wearing jeans that go down to her ankles and a black short-sleeved T-shirt. A leotard peeks out slightly at the neckline.\nExcept for wearing a leotard under her clothes, it’s ordinary clothing… They’re ordinary clothes, but maybe because of her usual image,\nShe looked vibrant,\nLike a girl her age.\nNot the villain, Arachne’s Arte Iris, whose thoughts are a mystery,\nBut the student, Arte Iris, who came to the amusement park to have fun with friends.\n“What are you doing, Siwoo! Aren’t you coming?!”\n“… Aren’t you just too excited?”\n“Ugh…Yes, fine! I want to ride it! Hurry up and come!”\nGeez.\nAmelia seemed to have forgotten her original purpose after saying it herself.\nDidn’t she want to back out when Arte wouldn’t notice\nWhere did that Amelia go? She’s the most excited one.\n“I’m coming, I’m coming. Don’t be too excited, Amelia.”\n“Wh-Who’s excited? I’m not!”\n“Ahaha. It’s alright to take it slow. We have plenty of time to enjoy ourselves.”\nHe knew it.\nIt’s not the usual Arte.\nThe vibe was somehow different.\n***\n“… It’s less fun than I expected. It’s too slow, Siwoo. Don’t you think?”\n“Th-This is slow…?”\n“No, I mean, if I run at full speed, I can reach this level of speed.”\nSiwoo and I were simultaneously shocked.\nShe could reach this speed on foot? Is she crazy?\nEven Siwoo and I had a hard time staying conscious in the end.\nIf the Author hadn’t penalized Amelia’s abilities, she might have been the world’s strongest.\nIt seems like most enemies would be one-hit kills just from her lightly touching them in passing.\nShe mentioned before that her father, a current A-rank hero, couldn’t catch her, and I’m realizing to my bones that it was the truth.\nHow are you supposed to catch a kid like this?\n“Hmmm…What should we ride next…”\nWhile Amelia was lost in thought and Siwoo was grasping his dizzy mind, I casually straightened my clothes.\nHmm, is it because this is the first time I’ve changed into this body and worn casual clothes?\nIt feels so awkward. I’ve always only worn my school uniform.\n“Ah, let’s try that next. It’s called a haunted house. They say there’s a course for ordinary people and one for superhumans.”\n“A superhuman course?”\n“Yeah. It’s written in the pamphlet. Apparently, there used to be a dungeon with undead-type monsters appearing hundreds of years ago, so they maintained that dungeon.”\n“So it’s not a haunted house, but real ghosts are coming out…”\n“The course for ordinary people isn’t like that, though? Since we’re superhumans, real ghosts will probably come out!”\nIt’s an ordinary short-sleeved tee and jeans I often wore, even as a guy.\nThe clothes Lyla and Spira recommended I wear.\nThey’re plain as can be, avoiding femininity as much as possible.\nBut why does it bother me so much…? I usually don’t think much about my clothes, even wearing a skirt.\nIt’s bothering me a bit today of all days.\n“Arte, what do you think? Do you dislike ghosts?”\n“…Ah. No, it’s fine. Ghosts and such don’t exist. Those things are just monsters.”\n“Aha. So that’s the type you are?”\nWell of course.\nGhosts don’t exist.\nThis world is the Author’s model garden. Her puppet show.\nGhosts form when people die. There’s no way there would be ghosts here.\nI glanced at Amelia while absentmindedly fiddling with my clothes, which no longer bothered me.\n“Hmm, but usually haunted houses are a place couples go to. Wouldn’t three people be a bit iffy?”\n“…Ah.”\nAmelia looked startled, as if she had completely forgotten.\nWhat, she forgot…?\nYou were in the middle of a date with Siwoo.\nHow can you forget something like that?\nI thought this might happen based on Amelia’s usual personality, but this is still unbelievable.\nIf you’re the heroine, pay attention to the protagonist. What are you doing?\n______________________________________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nI got a message from the PD!\nHmm, I need to submit the cover production proposal by August 3rd.\nI think I’ll make Arte’s cover!\nMany more people will want to see Arte rather than Siwoo or Amelia.\nI’ll think carefully about what kind of Arte would be good.",

      "content": "“…Ah, this is a failure.”\n“I agree. It’s much…less scary than I expected.”\nAmelia and I couldn’t hide our disappointment.\nWe had some expectations since they said real monsters would pop out.\n–\nI guess that’s how it is.\nMaybe for safety reasons, the monsters seemed to be missing a few screws, so there was no tension at all.\nFor a haunted house, there should be something a bit scary.\nIf there were one or two superhumans, it might have been tense, but… There are three students from the academy here.\nIt’s a bit awkward to say it myself, but all three of us are excellent students who have experienced real battles.\nDid we expect too much from the things coming out in this playground?\n“No, isn’t it obvious? If it was tense enough for three superhumans, this place would have to close down the moment an accident happens.”\n“That’s true, but…I feel kind of cheated.”\n“… That’s just you.”\n“What, why are you looking at me like that?”\n“It’s nothing.”\n…Hmm, the relationship between Amelia and Siwoo feels a bit different from what I thought.\nI thought Amelia was the main heroine since the Author didn’t intend to increase the number of heroine candidates.\nHer relationship with Siwoo felt more like close friends.\nIt doesn’t feel like she sees him as the opposite sex, but more like…\nThe feeling of having silly conversations with a same-sex friend? Something like that.\nA few days ago and even now.\nTheir bickering felt like the atmosphere of just close friends.\nEven if their relationship is like that now, will there come a day when Amelia falls for Siwoo?\nI suddenly started to worry… It’ll be possible someday, right?\n“Ah, that. What about that? Don’t you think even you could enjoy that?”\n“…What, the Ferris wheel?”\n“Yeah. The Ferris wheel should be fine.”\n“…! You’re smarter than I thought!”\nAt Siwoo’s suggestion, the overly excited Amelia started running toward where the Ferris wheel was.\nA Ferris wheel, huh. Well, yeah. Even Amelia could enjoy this.\nSince it’s not the type of ride you enjoy for speed or thrills.\nSiwoo and I enjoyed the rides, but Amelia couldn’t enjoy them at all due to her ability, so it seems her attention was drawn to this.\n“Sigh. Granny said it would be fun.”\n“…Granny?”\n“My butler. When I said I was going to the amusement park with friends, he told me this and that. It was a bit different from what I expected, though.”\nAmelia grumbled that Granny had told a bunch of lies.\nI see. Amelia is a young lady from a wealthy family. It wouldn’t be strange for her to have someone like that.\n[Ooh. I see. That’s good to know.]\n“… Didn’t you set that up?”\nI spoke to the Author in a small voice while watching them play around and walk away.\n[I only need to touch it when necessary! I tend to leave things alone if they’re unnecessary or look fine. I hadn’t touched anything here either.]\n“…Right. That was the case.”\nThis amusement park is also part of the Author’s puppet show world.\nBut she had never touched this place, and the visitors laughed and chatted, enjoying the specialness.\nThat fact was refreshing, as I had watched the area around the academy and even my house change in real time.\nThat specialness.\nThe specialness because she left it alone.\nIt was very enjoyable because I had never seen a place in this world that her hand hadn’t touched.\nIs that why?\nEven though there were rides that couldn’t exist in reality, like a haunted house and rides just for superhumans, it felt real.\n“Author-nim, did you really not touch or do anything to this place?”\n[What?… That’s right? Why all of a sudden…]\n“No, it’s nothing.”\nI swallowed the words I was about to utter.\nThis isn’t reality.\nEven if the Author says she didn’t manipulate the surroundings, in the end, it’s still on a stage.\nThe world is still full of puppets.\n“What are you doing, Arte! Hurry up and come!”\n“So impatient. I’ll be right there.”\n***\n“…We have a problem.”\n“What’s wrong?”\n“No, well. This was supposed to be a date for you and Arte…”\n“Now you realize? It’s way too late.”\n“Ugh…”\nAmelia fidgeted her fingers while glancing at Arte, who was following behind.\nNo matter how much urgency she expresses now, it’s already too late.\nA date…yeah, right. We came to hang out as a group of three.\nNo one would think of this as a date.\n“Ooh, I got too excited. Okay, there’s a good opportunity, so with this somehow…”\n“Opportunity?”\nAmelia didn’t answer my question.\nShe just silently waited for Arte.\n…An opportunity, what in the world does she mean?\n“Over here, Arte. A huge Ferris wheel! It’s amazing.”\n“It really is. I don’t think I’ve ever seen one this big.”\n“Let’s get on quickly. Hurry!”\nWithout even knowing what kind of opportunity she meant, Siwoo and Arte entered the Ferris wheel at Amelia’s urging.\n“Dear guests, we’ll be departing soon, so please prepare…”\n“…Ugh, hngh. Sorry, you two! My stomach suddenly…! You guys get on first!”\n“What?! Amelia! Where are you going?! Hey!”\n…She disappeared.\nThat speed, she definitely used her ability.\nWhat stomach ache. She was perfectly fine until just now, and if she had one, there was no way she would escape while using her ability.\nSuddenly, what Amelia said earlier came to mind.\n…Opportunity. Is this what she meant by that?\n“Uh, well.”\n“Let’s get on, Siwoo. People are waiting.”\n“…Right.”\nHe dumped complaints at Amelia in his mind.\nShe said it was an opportunity, but this was undoubtedly an act of sabotage.\n‘Putting me with Arte in an enclosed space?’\nHe didn’t think he would die, but his social death was fast approaching.\n“Oh, it’s going up.”\nBut it had already started moving.\nDuring the time it takes for the Ferris wheel to make one revolution, how in the world should he…\n“Boo!”\n“Whoa?!”\n“Why are you so stiff? Is it because I’m too pretty?… Haha, just kidding. Don’t be so nervous.”\n“R-Right…”\nArte, who had suddenly surprised me by jumping at me with outstretched hands, smiled and moved away.\n…At the tip of my nose, a subtle scent lingered.\n“…? What’s wrong?”\n“Oh, it’s nothing.”\nSiwoo couldn’t say it.\nEven if Arte was a normal student and not a villain, there’s no way he could say it.\nBeing able to recognize her scent because of her leotard.\nOr that his gaze was unintentionally drawn to it, peeking out at her nape because of that smell.\n‘If I say it, I’m dead. Not that Arte would kill me, but I would hang myself.’\n“It’s been a long time since I rode a Ferris wheel… It’s the first time since I was little.”\nFortunately, Arte only expressed doubt for a moment and didn’t question him further.\n‘I-I’m saved…’\nWhile watching Arte gaze at the rising scenery, he remembered what Amelia had told him.\nThe purpose of coming here was to seduce Arte.\n‘If an opportunity arises, create a good atmosphere no matter what. ‘\n…What does she expect me to do when I’ve never had a romantic relationship?\nBut since she forcefully created this opportunity for him, if he doesn’t act, she’ll start nagging again.\nSiwoo decided to muster up his courage and try striking up a conversation.\n“…Hey, Arte.”\n“Yes?”\n“Do you have someone you like or anything like that?”\nAh.\nSiwoo inwardly repeated that he was doomed.\nWhat crazy person starts a conversation with something like this?\nIn a situation where he didn’t know what to say, he couldn’t withstand the pressure from the Amelia in his mind and blurted out nonsense.\nDamn you, Amelia.\nHow dare you infect me with your rose-colored delusions!\n“No, I don’t…Are you trying to seduce me?”\n“Oh, no. I just. I never heard about your personal life, so I was curious.”\nGood, well done, Siwoo.\nFor having majorly messed up the beginning, this is a good save…!\nFortunately, Arte also seemed to breeze past it nonchalantly.\n“There is no need to talk about it.”\n“…I see. Maybe someday you’ll have someone you like.”\n“Never.”\n“…?”\nThe atmosphere suddenly changed. Siwoo couldn’t help but feel it.\nAs the Ferris wheel gradually rose, he saw Arte’s cold gaze at him.\nHer eyes looked as if she was looking at something inhuman.\n“I have no intention of dating anyone.”\n“I-Is that so…?”\n“I wouldn’t date puppets who can’t even forge their own paths even if they died.”\nPuppets?\nHe couldn’t understand Arte’s words.\nWho in the world is she referring to?\n“Uh, Arte. I think you’re getting too worked up. I think I misspoke. I’m sorry.”\n“I won’t fall for lifeless beings. No matter what, I’ll go back. I can’t keep staying in this puppet show.”\nWhat was the problem? What made her like this? Siwoo didn’t know.\nBut there was only one thing he could tell right now.\nArte was struggling with something, so much unlike her usual self.\nSiwoo didn’t know what it was.\nSo, he tightly embraced her.\n“?!”\n“It’s okay. Arte. I don’t know what’s going on, but it’s okay. Don’t worry.”\nDuring the Chameleon villain incident, she comforted me.\nThis time, I’ll help her.\nThat simple thought filled Siwoo’s mind.\nHe didn’t think about whether she was a villain or not.\nFriends help one another.\nEven if she doesn’t think of him as a friend,\nEven if she really is a villain killer,\nRight now, in Siwoo’s eyes, there was only a struggling friend.\nAuthor’s Notes\nWhy did they only hug!!!\nAmelia! Hurry up and do something more!",

It was just a casual remark that I might have someone I like someday.\nBut that one comment made me feel like a seizure button had been pressed, and I started spouting all sorts of weird things.\nFortunately, Siwoo doesn’t seem to understand what I meant.\nThe Author was also babbling loudly about dates and whatnot, ignoring what I said.\nHowever, I should reflect,\nComing to the amusement park, the puppets momentarily looked like people, shaking me up.\nThere’s no way that could be the case.\nI guess I can get sentimental once in a while.\nNow I got lost thinking all sorts of pointless thoughts.\n“Haha. This is embarrassing. You don’t need to go this far.”\n“…No. It’s okay. When you’re struggling, having someone by your side can be helpful.”\nSiwoo said that and hugged me again.\nBeing hugged and comforted by someone else was kind of embarrassing…\nBut there was one thing bothering me.\n[Hee, heheh… So cool. The protagonist’s warm hug and comfort. Must be nice…]\n…The Author’s commentary was so annoying that I couldn’t stand it.\nShe’s not some ahjumma* squealing over a morning drama, so why is she doing this?\nTell Siwoo to give hugs like this to Amelia, not me. Why do I have to feel these subtle emotions…\nBut he showed no sign of letting me go, so I stayed still until the Ferris wheel gradually neared the bottom.\n“…Um, it’s getting hot, so  if you’re okay now, can you let go?”\n“Oh, r-right. Sorry.”\nOnly then did Siwoo let go of me.\nSigh. It felt like hugging a teddy bear on a midsummer night. I thought I’d die from the heat.\n[You really hugged the whole way down? Hehe… This is, this is…! Uhehe, uhehehe.]\nShut up, Author.\nI muttered that in my mind. It’s a meaningless complaint since the Author can’t hear it anyway.\nWhen I looked at Siwoo’s face, it was flushed red.\nMaybe it was because he had been hugging me for a while?\nHey, why were you hugging me for so long  if you were hot, too?\nIs it something like the protagonist doesn’t abandon his friends?\n“Haha, I’m sorry. But thanks to you, Siwoo, I feel much better. Thank you.”\n“Oh, sure… I’m glad.”\nStill, since it was done out of concern for me, I should express my gratitude, right?\nI don’t know where that manly side he showed earlier disappeared, but the protagonist suddenly couldn’t make eye contact with me.\nI wanted to ask the Author what had happened, but I was not in a position to start a conversation.\nBecause she was still fangirling in my head.\n[Heh, hehe…! Ehehehehehe…! Th-That was so good to see. So, so nice…! You should have kissed right there. A deep one!]\nUgh, damn it. My head hurts.\nA kiss, are you crazy? Do something like that?\nTell him to do that to Amelia.\nIf he did that to me, who’s not even the heroine? What will I do if I get called a cheat?\nI plan to stay single for life and can’t let anything ruin that!\n“…Oh. Looks like it’s ending soon.”\nAhh, it was so regrettable. The outside scenery was really pretty.\nThat feeling of looking down at a view you can’t normally see from high up in the sky.\nI was disappointed I couldn’t properly enjoy the scenery because I suddenly threw a fit.\nWhile coming down, Siwoo was hugging me, so I didn’t have time to look at the view then either.\n“Huh, Amelia… Where did she go?”\n“Who knows? The restroom, maybe?”\nIs her stomach still hurting? …Did she eat something bad?\nAfter 10 minutes, then 20 minutes of waiting passed by,\nJust as Siwoo was about to call Amelia, who showed no sign of coming back, she appeared in an unexpected place.\nShe came off the Ferris wheel.\n“…It was more disappointing than I thought. Sigh.”\n“Amelia?! Why are you coming out of there?”\n“I told you guys to go ahead. I rode it alone separately. But it wasn’t as fun as I expected.”\n“…I-I see.”\nCome to think of it, did she say something like that?\nI thought it was just something she blurted out, but she really went up to ride alone. Impressive.\nI don’t think I could ride it alone in a place like this because it would feel burdensome.\n“Phew, so where should we go now?”\n“Wh-What?! You want to play more?”\n“Of course. We still have time. Did you think we’d be done after riding just a few things? Come on, let’s go! Time is ticking!”\nHow are you still so energetic?\nShe said it was nothing special and not fun, but I could tell.\nShe’s more upbeat than usual. Is she happy just spending time with friends?\nAccording to her setting, she didn’t have friends she could open up to, so maybe she considers us real friends.\n…My mood sank again.\nRight, in the end, this is a puppet show.\nEven if the Author can’t easily touch the protagonist and those around him because it might cause a setting inconsistency, they’re still puppets.\nAmelia, Claire, Lyla, and Spira…\nI shook my head once. Thinking about this hurts my head, so let’s not think about it.\n“…Alright. Let’s go.”\nI decided to enjoy myself and follow her.\nSince we’re here, it would be a waste not to have fun.\n***\n“Sigh. I’m exhausted.”\nAs soon as he returned to his room, Siwoo flopped onto the bed as if throwing his body.\nWas it because Amelia dragged us around the whole park?\nDespite being a superhuman, he felt exhausted.\n“… She’s here today, too. Isn’t she tired?”\nJust in case, he slightly opened the curtains to check, and sure enough.\nShe was watching over him today too.\nWhen he first found out she was watching over him, he wet his pillows in tears and didn’t get a wink of sleep.\nThinking about it now, it might be a memory.\nFar from being scary, he only had the impression of, “Oh, she’s here today too.”\nSomething scary only lasts once or twice. Since she watched daily without doing anything else, he gradually stopped being afraid.\nFar from being scared, Siwoo was attempting to play eye spy, wondering where she was watching me from.\n“Behind the utility pole today, huh? That’s rare.”\nUsually, she would hide behind a tree or on the power lines.\nShe must be tired, too. She was watching from a position where it was easier to be spotted than usual.\nAt first, it was scarier because she would appear and disappear.\nBut at some point, he got the knack for it. Or maybe his intuition got better?\nIt became easier to find where she was.\n“Changed back into her school uniform, I see.”\nThe casual clothes were pretty.\nThey were plain clothes, but she felt like a completely different person.\nA T-shirt and plain jeans.\nThey accentuated her physical features more than when she wore her school uniform.\nHe thought she might not have casual clothes since she always wears her school uniform, even when hiding and watching him.\nOr maybe she just didn’t want to wear them?\n“…Ah, damn it. It’s coming to mind again.”\nHe hurriedly closed the curtains and lay down on the bed.\nThinking of her kept reminding him of what happened today.\nTo calm the anxious-looking Arte, he hugged her.\nIt’s not like there was no physical contact at all before. During the Chameleon villain incident, she hugged me too.\nThat lingered in his mind, allowing the bad memory to be glossed over.\n…But this was on a different level.\nShe didn’t hug him from behind. He hugged her from the front.\nOnly after some time passed did he realize.\nIt was a very dangerous situation.\nThe same soft sensation from the back hug and her scent when he snuck into the women’s changing room.\nHer soft hair and slightly cool body temperature, too.\nWhen he came to his senses, he was faced with a huge danger.\n“If Amelia saw what I was doing… Phew.”\nI shook my head at the chilling thought that suddenly came to mind.\nLuckily, I didn’t get caught.\n…But what would have happened if I had?\n“Calm down, Siwoo. Think about something else. Calm down, calm…”\nSiwoo chanted to somehow forget that sensation and scent that kept coming to mind.\nBut they say the more you try not to think about something, the more it comes to mind.\nThe more he chanted, the more that moment became vividly engraved in Siwoo’s mind.\n“…Sigh. Guess I won’t be sleeping well tonight either.”\nSiwoo had a premonition.\nThat he wouldn’t be able to sleep soundly tonight either.\nAt least it wasn’t out of fear this time.\nSiwoo briefly fell into self-loathing, thinking if this was all he amounted to as a person.\nBut soon, even those thoughts were instantly erased by that scene that came to mind again.\n…And just as he thought, Siwoo couldn’t sleep.\n_______________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nRuminas, have a pleasant evening today too!\nIt’s hot these days, so you shouldn’t pull an all-nighter like Siwoo, you know?\nWink.\nOho, my thousand coin virginity was taken!

      "content": "Bang!\nTeacher Claire smacked the chalkboard with her palm.\nThe large letters written on it shook for a moment from the impact.\nEnd of semester tournament.\nIt was the beginning of the final exams.\n“This Wednesday, the end-of-semester tournament begins! It will be reflected in your grades, so prepare diligently!”\n[It’s finally starting!]\nTournament, huh?\nHmm, no matter how much I think about it, I have no idea why this kind of thing is the final exam.\nMost academy novels divide up the students based on their rank.\nIf the 1st and 2nd place meet in the preliminaries and the 1st place happens to lose, that person would end up with the lowest grade.\nWhen I asked the Author about this, the development was revised. Today, she’ll probably discuss that.\n“There will be a loser’s bracket in the tournament. So don’t worry too much.”\n“A, a loser’s bracket?”\nAh, she’s talking about it right now.\nShe seemed concerned about the students looking anxious.\n“There has been talk before that the tournament lacks a seeding system. So there will be a loser’s bracket this time.”\n“Oh, ohhh…”\n“And one more thing.”\nTeacher Claire delivered an important fact to the students, who were feeling relieved.\n…In a way, this might be a better solution.\nEven I didn’t think of this. The Author sometimes comes up with good ideas.\n“This tournament will be in teams of two.”\n“Wh, what?!”\n“If we add a loser’s bracket, there won’t be enough time. Everyone agreed to this. The rationale was sound.”\nHmm, look at how flustered they are.\nThey must be the students who heard about the tournament contents from their seniors.\nSeeing those guys get confused when the content differs from their knowledge is a bit satisfying.\nLike I can control the emotions of the puppets!… Something like that?\nWell, it’s not that I controlled it, but still.\n“So, sound rationale?”\n“Yes. Have you all ever tried working in sync with others before?”\n“…Ugh.”\n“You haven’t, right? I know.”\n“B-but…!”\nThe student who tried to argue couldn’t continue speaking after seeing Claire’s expression.\n…A look as  if longing for something. She’s probably thinking of her dead former comrades.\nThat was part of her setting, after all.\n“I’m saying this because I also had such times. …Trying to work in sync with others is something a hero must do.”\n“B-but! We have no experience working together right now! For the exam content to suddenly…”\nChange like this, does it make sense?\nThe student who tried to say that finally shut his mouth, realizing Claire was staring intently at him.\nRight, the teachers were just turning a blind eye to it.\nThe academy exam contents are confidential. Moreover, the exam content is only revealed on Monday of that week.\nKnowing the exam content beforehand should be impossible in the first place. The teachers were just kindly overlooking that.\nThe students realized they were already being let off.\n“So try it out this week… Didn’t you all want to become heroes?”\n“Y-yes. That’s right…”\n“Most heroes don’t wander around alone like you think. At a minimum, they work in teams of two. That’s the basics. The solo heroes you imagine are a tiny minority.”\nTeacher Claire wrote on the chalkboard with the chalk.\nTeams of 2.\n“Ordinary superhumans can’t handle the monsters at the front lines alone. So most form teams… Who do you think the superhumans team up with?”\n“Their close colleagues, of course. Isn’t it obvious?”\n“You’re partially correct. About half the time, they work with people who aren’t their colleagues. It’s different from what you think.”\n“…What?”\nHuh, really?\nEven I didn’t know that.\nThe Author probably set that without telling me.\nShe doesn’t bother explaining things to me that don’t need explaining.\nI’ve suffered a lot because of that.\n“As you all know, superhumans are busy. The front lines, exterminating villains, patrols for citizens’ safety, etc. They’re so busy they can barely catch their breath.”\nBefore I knew it, Claire had returned to lecture mode. She walked around the students as she continued speaking.\n“Superhumans are also human. They need rest, and they get injured too. Having mismatched schedules with colleagues is a daily occurrence…Then, what will you do  if a teammate gets hurt and your schedules don’t align?”\n“Nu-nurse the colleague or something?”\n“Are you crazy? Superhumans are in short supply as they are. You’re going to leave a perfectly fine person alone just because one teammate got hurt?  If we did that, we would have progressed much slower than now.”\n“…”\nThe student who had been answering the teacher’s questions lost her words.\nHer opinions had been completely refuted, so that’s understandable.\n“The answer is simple. You go on missions with a superhuman whose hands are free, one you’re meeting for the first time. Or one you only know by face.”\n“…B-but! We don’t know what kind of accident might happen then!”\n“Of course, we know that. That’s why the content of this final exam was decided. I don’t think this will solve everything, but isn’t getting used to it even a little better?”\n[Hmm, not a bad setting, right?]\nMy focus was completely shattered by the Author’s words.\nIn the end, this is all a setting of her liking. I was stupid for intently listening to the teacher’s words.\nAfter circling around the students once, Claire returned to the chalkboard and wrote in the empty space with the chalk.\n“The evaluation criteria for this final exam is simple. Teamwork and the ability to handle unexpected situations… It’s different from the old days when ranking was the standard for everything.”\nTeamwork, written in large letters on the chalkboard.\nClaire spoke loudly to the students blankly staring at the board.\n“The partners for this tournament will be decided by drawing lots.”\nHa, I see. Then who will I be with?\nI peeked at Siwoo and Amelia.\nThose two will be together, right?\n…Do I have to team up with someone I don’t know?\nHowever, after all the students had drawn their lots and I had seen the results, I was shocked.\nAmelia was next to me.\n“Arte, I’m counting on you.”\n“Y-yes. I’m counting on you too.”\nWhat the.\nI thought for sure Amelia and Siwoo would be on the same team.\nWhy did she come here?\n[Whew, the opportunity has finally arrived. Do you know how hard it was to have a heroine set up but not be able to use her?]\n…What? Heroine?\nI hurriedly glanced next to Siwoo.\n… It’s a girl. According to the Author, she must be the heroine.\nBut now? All of a sudden?\nShe must have noticed my confusion. She began explaining confidently.\n[You see, I had a heroine set up, but there ended up being less contact with her than I thought. Since it turned out this way, I thought I’d try increasing her role.]\nBut you told the readers she was the heroine without doing anything with her?\nAt the Author’s words, I stared intently at that girl.\n…Heroine? You mentioned that before? When?\nI stared at her for a long time, and the timid-looking heroine, noticing my gaze, got startled and trembled.\n“Arte, do you have some business with her?”\n“No, she just looks familiar… Do you know her, Amelia?”\n“Who knows? We’re in the same class, but I haven’t talked to her aside from sparring with her on the first day.”\n“Ah.”\nThat’s it.\nI realized it from Amelia’s words.\nBack when we had just entered school not long ago, that girl who got thrashed by Amelia in the first spar.\nIt was her.\n“…I see.”\nCome to think of it, the Author had mentioned something like that before.\nShe said both of them were heroine candidates when they sparred.\nI thought the Author had rejected her since they had never met after that, so I forgot about it.\nSeems she was lying in wait because the timing to use her never came up.\nIndeed, there were a bit too few heroines.\nThere have only been three heroine candidates so far.\nLyla, Amelia, and that girl.\n…Claire definitely wasn’t a heroine. At most, she was a supporting character.\nLyla was consumed as a villain, and that girl only now appears.\nUnlike most academy novels, there has only been one heroine. This is a bit unusual, considering that most novels have harems or multiple heroines to choose from.\nIs she planning to start introducing other heroines and let it run differently?\n“…A-Arte.”\n“Yes?”\n“Don’t worry too much. It’ll be fine.”\n“?”\nAmelia spouted nonsense.\nWhat’s she worried about?\nWhat is she thinking to comfort me like that suddenly?\nHer looking at me like I’m some poor thing to be pitied made me feel a bit annoyed.\n***\nThe girl, Dorothy, was very flustered.\n“Nice to meet you, Dorothy.”\n“Oh, yes. …You know my name?”\n“We’re in the same class.”\nShe just accepted that the popular Siwoo ended up in the same group as her.\nAnd while it’s surprising he knows the name of someone as useless as her, she thought it was possible.\nThere are always some who know their classmates’ names, even  if they aren’t close.\nBut Dorothy couldn’t stand Arte’s gaze.\n“…Is something wrong?”\n“N-no! It’s nothing!”\nThe closer Siwoo got to her out of concern, the more piercing Arte’s gaze became.\n‘H-hiii. Scary.’\nWhen there were rumors among the students that she was someone whose thoughts were impossible to know, she didn’t understand what they meant.\nShe thought she was just a person who was always smiling brightly, pretty, and strong, unlike herself.\nNow, she clearly understood.\n‘Why is she looking at me like that!’\nHer eyes are glaring at me like she wants to kill me, but she’s smiling…!\n“You don’t look well… Should I help you to the infirmary?”\n“D-don’t come any closer! Please!”\n“…O-okay. Sorry.”\nSiwoo looked hurt at being rejected, but Dorothy couldn’t help it.\nThe gaze on her back was getting more and more piercing, making it hard to endure.\n“Um, Teacher. About changing the drawing…”\n“I explained earlier. This test is to see how well you synch up with someone you’re meeting for the first time. The moment you change, I’ll give you both the lowest score, so don’t even dream of it.”\n“…Yes.”\nDorothy wanted to cry.\nIf she could, she wanted to give her spot to Arte.\nShe started resenting the teacher.",

      "content": "Just Because I Have Narrow Eyes Doesn’t Make Me a Villain! - Chapter 50\n“Hmm, hmm…”\nDorothy was very tense from the gaze that kept piercing her.\nWhat’s wrong? What did she do wrong? Did she do something to offend Arte?\nIt was different from when we checked the raffle results.\nAt that time, her mouth was smiling, but her eyes were glaring at me as if she wanted to kill me.\nBut not now.\nThat scary expression from then vanished without a trace, and an incomprehensible gaze kept flying toward me.\n… What’s the problem with that, you ask? Isn’t it fine that she’s not looking with a scary expression?\nIt’s even scarier that it’s not!\nWhy? Why did she have that expression before? Why is she looking normal now?\nWhat on earth is the problem?\n“…Dorothy. You haven’t been concentrating since earlier.”\n“Ah, ah! It’s fine! I-I’m alright!”\n“It doesn’t seem like you’re alright though.”\nAgain, it’s that gaze.\nThe gaze that lingered the whole time she was coordinating with Siwoo.\nAs she turned my head, sure enough, Arte was watching.\nDorothy roughly learned the condition for her gaze.\n“D, don’t come closer.”\n“…Um, listen, Dorothy. I’m sorry, but that’s going to be difficult. The exam is a team battle. Even if you dislike me, that can’t be changed.”\n“No! I, it’s not that I dislike you!”\nOh no, this is terrible.\nNo matter how she thinks about it, Arte sends her gaze when Siwoo approaches her or when they move close together.\nSo, she had no choice but to distance myself from him, and it seemed Siwoo thought she disliked him.\n“I-in other words…”\n“… I’m sorry, Dorothy.”\n“Ah, aaaaah…”\n‘Wh-, what do I do?! ‘\nThis is bad, this is bad, this is bad, this is bad!\n‘It seems Siwoo really thinks I dislike him now! We-well, it is my fault…’\nShe distanced herself from Siwoo because she couldn’t stand Arte’s gaze.\nTo disperse Arte’s gaze!\nShe wasn’t sure if her thoughts were correct, but Arte turned to her teammate.\n‘B-but is this really okay…?’\nHowever, as she stopped feeling Arte’s gaze, Dorothy gradually thought this was unfair.\nIt wasn’t right.\n‘What wrong have I committed that I have to tremble like this?’\nShe hasn’t done anything wrong. As the Teacher said, she just teamed up with Siwoo, so why did she have to receive this treatment?\n‘The one in the wrong isn’t me. It’s Arte.’\nDorothy steeled her heart.\nIt’ll be big trouble if she lets the fear of Arte stop her from practicing and mess up the exam.\n…Alright.\n“…Dorothy?”\n“Ah, yeah. It’s nothing.”\nSlowly, slowly.\nAs she approached Siwoo to some degree, as expected, Arte’s gaze followed.\n“Eek…”\n“Dorothy. You don’t have to force yourself.”\n“Huh?!”\n“I know, so you don’t need to force yourself. What I said was a joke, so don’t worry too much. I know you don’t dislike me.”\nHer thoughts stopped.\n…He knew? That Arte was watching like that?\nThen why is he so calm about it?\n“I wonder what she’s staring like that for this time…”\n“Si-Siwoo, you knew?”\n“Hm?… Ah, you might not know. She does that often.”\n“Often?!”\nShe was dumbfounded by what Siwoo uttered in a nonchalant tone.\nOften?\nOften?!\nEven if she stares often… ha~. Technically, it’s not stalking, but… Anyway.\nEven if he admits she does it often, what’s with this composed attitude?\n“I’ll have to ask Amelia later. Sorry, Dorothy. This is all because of me.”\n“Ah, ahh…?”\n“She may look like that, but she’s just observing us, so don’t worry, and let’s practice.”\nHer emotions were being tossed about a lot today.\nShe felt terror at Arte’s incomprehensible expression, persistent gaze, and confusion at Siwoo’s ridiculous reaction.\nNow thinking it doesn’t matter anymore, she turned to look at Arte.\nSure enough, she was watching with an inscrutable smile.\nAnd Siwoo knew that but was just letting it slide…?\nThey’re both out of their minds. Dorothy started hating the Teacher.\nJust let me switch.\n***\n“Ah, about that. It’s love.”\n“…Pardon?”\n“Love. Is it that surprising? When love is too deep, people sometimes get jealous and stuff. It’s exactly that.”\n“Are you crazy?”\nAfter classes had ended for the day.\nFor the first time in her life, Dorothy spat out harsh words in front of someone.\n“If that’s love, then a hero chasing after a villain must be desperate lovers!”\n“No, that’s not it. The hero chases the villain because they have an objective.”\nDorothy was talking with Arte’s partner, Amelia.\nShe had heard she was the daughter of a wealthy family, but to think she was this kind of person.\nThey say you can’t calculate a person’s insanity?\nA hollow laugh escaped as she saw the faint madness.\nThey say the empty cart rattles the loudest, so why do people who have gone mad all look fine on the outside like this?\n“Arte is just watching Siwoo without any objective…If that’s not love, then what is it?”\n“…”\n“See, you have nothing to say either? Sorry, but Arte gets a bit too jealous. Please understand.”\nDorothy didn’t stay silent because she couldn’t refute it but because she was dumbfounded.\nShe wanted to say that’s not love, but it didn’t seem like she would listen even if she did.\nA scary girl stalks a boy while having who knows what thoughts.\nA boy who is so nonchalant despite being stalked as if it’s only natural.\nAnd a girl who knows that but still spouts that it could only be love.\nWhen the Teacher said the exam would be in pairs, I thought I’d be able to make a friend.\nBut rather than a friend, I’ve gotten tangled up with people I shouldn’t be involved with.\nA sudden rainy season began in Dorothy’s heart.\nThey’re all crazy.\n***\n“They seem unexpectedly close?”\n[I know, right? Even though she likely had a timid personality. …Well, isn’t it good if they become friends!]\nHow carefree.\nA sigh escaped my mouth at the Author’s irresponsibility.\nBut as she says, there likely won’t be any particular problems.\nIn any case, with academy novel tropes, Amelia and Dorothy will maintain a relationship of being friends.\n“Ah, Author.”\n[Yes?]\n“Have you decided who will win the heroine race?”\nSince a new heroine appeared, I wanted to hear who on earth would end up with Siwoo.\nA harem ending befitting an academy story?\nOr the currently unrivaled Amelia? The newly appeared Dorothy?\n[It’s a secret!]\n“…What? No, you could let me know a little bit.”\n[You’re also a reader! I don’t want to reveal too much!]\n“Sigh…”\nThe Author in this state won’t listen no matter how much I persuade her.\nSo even if I want to know, I can’t.\nThere’s no meaning in hearing who will become the main heroine.\n…Well, my personal thought is that it will likely be Amelia.\nBecause the period when there was only one heroine was too long.\nThese days, she even plays around with him like childhood friends who have been together since childhood.\n“Well, okay. Just be careful not to get burned out.”\n[Don’t worry!]\nThere’s no way I couldn’t.\nIt’s not like the incidents she’s caused alone are just one or two.\nI sighed while watching the two heroines chatting on a bench.\nTomorrow is the start of final exams.\nThe protagonist will need to get good grades. I’m starting to worry.\n***\n“…What did you say?”\n“I said to keep your hands off the Arachne case, Investigator Lee Ha-Yul.”\n“Bu, but…! We even have a strong suspect!”\nHa-Yul was flustered. Keep my hands off it?\nHe and his subordinates were the only ones in charge of the Arachne case.\nIf he lets go, there will be no way to catch Arachne in the future.\nBut keep his hands off it?\n“I understand your enthusiasm, but orders came down from above. They said to stop now.”\n“What do you mean by that? Arachne is a criminal!”\n“Yeah. A criminal… A criminal the citizens really like.”\n“Urk…”\nAt his superior’s words, the citizens’ reactions naturally came to mind.\nThe citizens rejoiced, saying villains aren’t human, so the murder law doesn’t apply.\n“They probably think the approval rating will fall if Arachne is caught.”\n“What?!”\n“That organization is disposing of troublemakers for us, so shouldn’t they just leave it alone and reap the benefits?… The higher-ups seem to have judged it that way.”\nBecause Arachne is treated differently from other villains.\nHis superior, who said that, smiled bitterly.\n“They’ve been quiet recently too. Even if a big incident erupts, they judge there’s no need to mind it. So hands off.”\n“Bu, but…!”\n“Ah, and they said they won’t tolerate overstepping their authority. If there are signs of that, be prepared to be treated as a villain… They said that as well.”\n“…”\nDammit.\n‘Is it because I’ve overstepped too much until now?’\nHe didn’t pay much attention to being treated as a troublemaker, but today, he started hating his past self.\nHe should have behaved more…!\n“I understand how you feel, but there’s no helping it if that’s the higher-ups’ judgment.”\n“…Yes.

      "content": "Just Because I Have Narrow Eyes Doesn’t Make Me a Villain! - Chapter 51\nTN: Thank Viiyen for the chapter……………\n________________________________________\n“We’re doomed! Doomed, I tell you…”\nDorothy spewed all sorts of complaints, spreading a gloomy atmosphere.\n“Dorothy, don’t worry too much. It’ll be fine.”\n“Don’t say such nonsense. We barely practiced at all.”\n“Urk…”\nSiwoo couldn’t refute her words.\nIt was true that they hadn’t practiced properly, just as she said.\nIt’s not that they weren’t given time. They were given the same amount as everyone else.\n…The problem was that Dorothy couldn’t focus properly.\n“Does Arte not practice…? She’s always just watching.”\n“Who knows? I’m not sure either.”\nAt a glance, it seemed Arte didn’t do much besides talk to Amelia occasionally.\n“Still, don’t let your guard down. They’re both strong.”\n“It’s not even certain we’ll face them in the tournament! Let alone letting our guard down…”\n“No, it’ll work out if we meet. If we do, doesn’t that mean we won a bunch?”\n“… Aren’t you overflowing with confidence?”\n“Of course.”\nArte and Amelia are strong. Siwoo is certain of it since he saw it firsthand.\nAs long as those two are together, they won’t lose to any group.\n‘But I don’t think I’ll lose either.’\nUnlike other students, he’s experienced all sorts of incidents, so he’s confident he could fight well.\nIn the end, if they keep winning, they’ll meet eventually.\n“I’m counting on you, Dorothy.”\n“…Yeah. Well, sure.”\nAnd he’s confirmed Dorothy’s ability, too.\nShe lost to Amelia in an instant at the start of the semester.\nBut he understood why that happened.\nAn ability that couldn’t be used alone.\nNo wonder she lost.\nBut in a case like this 2 vs 2 tournament, the story is different.\nBecause she can fully utilize her ability.\n‘Maybe we can even beat Arte…!’\n“Everyone, focus! The tournament is starting! Those waiting their turn can watch the matches and leave comments! Observing other students and learning from them is important too.”\n“Ah, it’s starting.”\n“I wonder what kind of fight Arte and Amelia will have.”\nHe didn’t think for a second that they would lose.\nHe was only curious about one thing.\nWill the two of them cooperate?\nNo matter how much Siwoo thought about it, he couldn’t imagine it.\n***\n“…Hey Arte. Is this right?”\n“Of course. Come on, you tie this and go.\nThe content of this exam isn’t difficult.\nHow well you utilize each other.\nUsing someone you just met is usually hard, but I already know Amelia’s ability.\nIt won’t be hard to subdue the students effortlessly.\n“It feels kind of icky. This is, well, you know…”\n“I know. It feels morally wrong. But this is the most efficient, right?”\n“Hmm, I guess…?”\nThankfully, it seems Amelia is convinced.\nIt was funny how she would be instantly persuaded if I said it was efficient or the best method.\n“Let’s stop the idle chatter there. Are you ready?”\n“Yes.”\nI could see our tense opponents.\nHmm, but I feel bad about this.\nI can’t lose to extras though.\nHaving teamed up with Amelia, I can’t lose to these guys for the sake of the story development.\n“Begin!”\nWith the bang of a gunshot, the battle began as Amelia accelerated instantly.\n“…!? F-fast! Block her!”\n“No. Amelia gets weaker the faster she goes! She doesn’t hurt much, so we’ll aim for Arte first!”\nHmm…Who is that? A classmate?\nIt seems like it since they know Amelia and me, but I can’t remember the faces.\nI don’t memorize the faces of each puppet after all.\nI don’t know who it is, but that was a good judgment.\nThe faster Amelia goes, the harder she is to catch, but her attack power decreases in exchange. They know their stuff.\nShe’ll annoyingly buzz around like a fly, but if the impact isn’t big, they can take me down first and slowly catch her later.\nThey have a good grasp of Amelia’s ability.\nThey know to ignore her and aim for an easier target. How extra-like to mess things up because of that judgment.\nIf her attacks are weak, why would she even bother to attack?\nThey should have considered why she would’ve done this in the first place.\n“Sorry. My attack power is weak, but this thread isn’t.”\n“?! Oh no! It’s thread! Dodge!”\nAmelia’s attacks were light.\n…But my threads aren’t.\nFor what reason did Amelia go into speed mode from the start? She could have fought normally, like in her duel against Dorothy.\nNot realizing that was their blunder.\nMy threads are thin and hard to see. Still, if I attack outright, they can see the mana manipulating them, allowing them to dodge easily.\nThey’re fast, but not to the point they can’t be dodged…But the more they dodge, the fewer chances I have to attack. My clothes decrease after all.\nThis is an arena with many students watching. I want to save my threads as much as possible. Then what should I do?\nI usually lay it somewhere to save thread and use it by baiting foes towards myself, but that’s impossible here.\nThen how can I do it so the opponent doesn’t notice?\nThe solution is quite simple. Tie barely visible threads to Amelia’s body and have her scatter them around the arena.\nThey didn’t notice the thin threads and rushed at me, but it was too late.\nThe arena was already under my control.\nThey panicked as the mana-infused threads Amelia scattered flew at them from all directions, but it was too late.\nOne student who knew us well escaped in time, but the other panicked.\nHe was bound head to toe by the threads flying from every direction.\n“Hey, Arte. Did I have to tie it around my neck?… It’s too brutal. I mean, not as an insult. Couldn’t you have tied it to the hands?”\n“It could slip off the wrists, so the biggest bottleneck is best.”\n“…Really?”\nAmelia touched her neck as she said that.\n…Well, it’s not wrong. It’s more convenient than tying it to the hands.\nI’ve gotten too used to tying it around the neck.\nIf I tie it to the hands or something, it’s a bit…how should I say it?\nLike I might make a mistake? I preferred tying it to the neck.\n“You’re the only one left. What will you do?”\n“B-bring it on!”\n“Oh, gutsy. I like it.”\nAmelia cheerfully laughed as she canceled her acceleration and cut the thread on her neck with her spear.\nAnd that was the end.\nThe lone student charged in with spirit but couldn’t withstand the attacks of Amelia as I hindered his movement with threads.\n“… I’m glad it ended quickly. Good work.”\n“Alright. Now that it’s over, return to your seats and rest. Feel free to watch the others’ matches.”\n[Good work, Reader-nim! That was cool!]\nI felt good ending the match without using a lot of thread.\nTo think the battle ended with one glove.\nSure, they were extras I could catch quickly, but I could easily end things going forward.\nIt felt like my biggest worry was resolved. After all, the longer the fight, the more disadvantageous it is for me.\nIt’s fine if I kill them since it doesn’t matter if I show skin then, but this is school. The opponents are students. I can’t kill them.\nSo, I have to fight while holding back, inevitably increasing thread consumption.\nUltimately, the threads I can pull from are limited to my gloves and stockings. Using the rest risks big trouble.\nOf course, we’re given rest time after fights to replenish clothes.\n…Still, I can’t change clothes in the middle of a fight, right?\nUnlike villains, the puppets watching now are students.\nIt’s impossible to get rid of this many.\nI absolutely can’t make the mistake of using too many clothes while fighting and ending up naked in front of this many people.\nThankfully, thanks to Amelia, there seems to be an easy solution, so I’m in a good mood.\n***\n“Wow, so that’s what they planned.”\n“…Simple but guaranteed.”\nThat was Siwoo and Dorothy’s reaction to the match.\nA simple but certain method. Install threads with Amelia’s incredible speed and attack from all sides.\nA way to supplement Arte’s threads with Amelia’s lacking attack power.\nA very efficient method.\n“I’m envious. Seems like they can get a good evaluation like that.”\n“…Who knows. I’m not sure.”\n“Huh?”\n“Couldn’t Arte have just attacked normally…?”\nThat was what Siwoo was curious about.\nHaving Amelia lay threads and Arte attack is a good method.\n…But did they really have to do that?\nWouldn’t it have been enough for Arte and Amelia to attack separately?\nDorothy answered Siwoo’s question.\n“There must be a reason they had to do that, right?”\n“A reason?”\n“Yes. If they did something unnecessary, there must be a reason.”\nA reason, huh?\nSiwoo pondered why Arte didn’t use thread.\n…And after a moment of thought.\nSiwoo finally realized it.\n“N-no way.”\n“…? Did you realize something?”\n“No, it can’t be…”\nUntil now, Siwoo has thought Arte could create thread using mana.\nThe thread Amelia spread was also covered in mana.\nBut what if that wasn’t it?\n…What if she’s not converting mana into thread, but the thread is just infused with and strengthened by mana?\nSuddenly, Arte’s hand came into Siwoo’s view.\nOne of the gloves that should have been there was gone.\n“Don’t tell me, back then too…?”\nWhen he first fought Arte\n.\nHe was too busy dodging to look at Arte properly.\n…At that time, was she wearing stockings?\nIt felt like he saw her weakness.\nNo, but even if that’s true, is it okay to leverage it?\nSiwoo’s feelings grew complicated.\n___________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nAfter thinking about it, I decided to ask for a cover from novelpia-chan? (I might be hallucinating with the chan.)\nArte winking with a night backdrop.\nI’m excited to see how it turns out.\nHopefully it lines up with the 100th chapter.",

You’re much stronger than I expected!”\nDorothy’s excited voice rang out.\nThe gloomy attitude from earlier, saying they were doomed, was nowhere to be seen. After a few battles, her mood seemed to have improved.\n“I wondered why you were so confident, but there was a reason for it all!”\n“…”\n“…What is it? You’ve had that look for a while. We’re winning, but it makes me anxious. Is something wrong?”\n“Ah, it’s nothing. Sorry.”\nHe only thought about how he must look after Dorothy’s words.\nTheir team is advancing and winning, but he’s sighing. Of course she’d be worried. He didn’t think about that.\n“…It doesn’t seem like nothing. Tell me quickly.”\n“W-well, that’s…”\n‘Can I say it?’\nSiwoo pondered for a moment.\nAnd concluded that he mustn’t say it.\nHe realized what Arte’s ability that he’s most wary of is! Her ability is turning her clothes into thread.\nSo, to definitely beat her, he had to drag it into a drawn-out battle!\nBut he’s agonizing over whether he should really do it!\n… It’s easy to imagine what would happen if he told Dorothy.\nHe’d be treated like a madman and looked at with eyes of contempt.\nAnything but that. He couldn’t handle that.\nHe’d die socially. His heart couldn’t take it.\n“…Sorry. I can’t say.”\n“Okay. If you don’t want to say, it can’t be helped. Tell me later if you feel like it.”\n“Yeah. Got it.”\nHe said that, but he had no intention of ever telling her.\nIf it was Amelia, he could have said it comfortably.\n‘She definitely wouldn’t look at me like trash!’\nNo. Maybe she’d get more excited and say let’s drag it out as long as possible to strip Arte naked.\nBut Amelia is with her right now.\nHis partner now is Dorothy. Would a fellow girl agree to strip another to win?\nSiwoo thought there was no way.\nIf he were with Amelia, he wouldn’t even have to worry about this.\n…And suddenly, Siwoo realized he was becoming more like Amelia.\nBefore hanging out with her, there’s no way he would have agonized over such thoughts.\nHe would have tried to fight fair and square in a short, decisive match.\nI guess it’s true that if you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas.*\nAt some point, Siwoo’s thinking started to resemble Amelia’s.\n“…Why are you suddenly grabbing your head?”\n“No, well… I realized you should choose your friends well.”\n“You’re a strange one. Why are you saying something so obvious now?”\nYeah, it’s obvious.\nYou should choose your friends well. Something he always heard.\nSiwoo was confident he wouldn’t be influenced even if they did bad things.\nIf they go down a bad path, he can be a good friend and influence them instead, right? That’s what he thought.\nBut ink spreads slowly.\nHe only realized that after being colored by his ‘friend.’\nThere’s not much left until the fight with Arte.\nHe had to think about what to do.\n***\n“Amelia.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Do you know Dorothy’s ability?”\n“Nope.”\n“…What?”\nI asked, thinking she’d definitely know.\n…What the?\n“You fought her once before, didn’t you?”\n“That’s true, but she didn’t use her ability then. I don’t really know.”\n“…Hmm.”\nIt was meaningless to ask the Author, too.\nShe prioritizes the novel’s entertainment, so if I prepare, she thinks it’ll be less fun and refuses to tell me.\nWell, I could roughly guess her intent.\nAn academy where the protagonist has to shine. Moreover, in a tournament, isn’t it only normal he wins?\nI didn’t bother arguing with her since it seemed unnecessary.\nI agree with her opinion, too.\nShould I fight moderately and then lose to him?\n[I’m excited! What kind of battles await? It’s been a while since you directly fought the protagonist!]\nThe Author spoke in an excited voice.\nMeeting Siwoo didn’t take as long as I thought.\nI thought we’d only meet in the finals.\nI didn’t expect to face him in the round of 32. Either Siwoo or I had to fight in the loser’s bracket during class tomorrow.\n“Our match will be starting soon. Shall we go?”\n“Yeah. Since it turned out this way, let’s try to win. I’ll put him in his place.”\nThe problem was this. I wanted to lose moderately, but Amelia was too fired up.\nHow can I lose in a way that doesn’t make her suspicious?\n“Arte Iris, Yu Siwoo, Dorothy Gale, Amelia Lindberg! Come up! It’s your turn!”\n“Ah, it’s starting.”\n“Let’s go, Arte! Our goal is 1st place!”\n…Hmm, I don’t know.\nIs there a way to lose this?\nMaybe Siwoo will suddenly awaken.\nI hope so.\n***\n“…Ready, begin!”\nBang!\nTeacher Claire fired a gun to signal the start of the fight.\n“Amelia, you’re not moving?”\n“No need to move. It’s more convenient for you to make them come to us.”\n“…Yeah, that’s right.”\nSiwoo let out a small sigh.\nHe waited, thinking it would become clear if he saw directly, but he forgot they knew his ability, too.\nSeems they’re reluctant to engage first since it’s an ability that excels at counterattacks.\n‘…Alright, then, there’s no choice. I’ll have to check myself.’\nHe peeked at Arte.\nTwo gloves, a school uniform, a slightly visible leotard, stockings, and a pure white jacket.\nThe same outfit she usually wears.\n“Dorothy, grant me your ‘wisdom.'”\n“Okay… Be careful not to vomit again?”\n“I won’t. I’m used to it now.”\n“It surprised me. Saying you’re dizzy or something. Some people get hurt from it, but it was the first time someone vomited.”\nHe wondered what would happen.\nSiwoo hoped his thoughts were wrong.\n“The scarecrow said: I want a brain. The Wizard agreed to grant the wish.**”\nWhen Dorothy’s words ended, I felt an intense headache and a stomach ache that felt like my insides were twisting together.\nA sensation as if the world was distorting.\nA feeling so surreal it was enough to think this world doesn’t actually exist.\nDorothy’s ability, Wizard…An ability that strengthens others.\nHis eyes and ears hurt from the ability that forcibly maximizes them.\nPractice with Dorothy was always like this. His is also Intuition maximized to the point other senses become dull, making it hard to move.\nAn ability that strengthens only the designated aspect, not the body together with the ability.\nIt was not something one could get used to quickly.\nHe heard she can strengthen other aspects, but this is all he got used to in a week.\nIf a user had fire-breathing ability, their firepower would be maximized to the point that they would be burned by their own flames.\nIn Siwoo’s case, it’s sensory maximization.\nIntuition became sickeningly strong.\n“…Te-, …ck? Th-…, we…fi-…o…”\nI close my eyes and ears.\nNormal people can’t fight in that state. They wouldn’t be able to see or hear anything.\nBut not Siwoo.\nHe closed his ears but could still hear the sound of Amelia clicking her tongue in dismay.\nHe closed his eyes but could still see Arte watching him with interest.\nHe couldn’t help but sense…The wind of Amelia’s spear thrusting at him.\n“?!”\n“…Caught you.”\nHe had no sensation in his hands, but he could feel it.\nHe caught Amelia’s spear.\nHe heard thin threads crawling across the floor. He swung his sword and cut them.\nAnd the moment he tried to rip the spear from Amelia’s hands, he felt something.\n…What is it?\nThere was something beside Arte.\nIt’s not Amelia. She was in front of me.\nIt wasn’t Teacher Claire, either. He can feel her watching from far away.\n…Then, what is this strange presence he feels next to Arte?\nWhile he was flustered by the bizarre presence felt by his maximized Intuition, the world returned to normal.\n“Oo-ugh…! Bleh…! Ack…!”\n“A-are you okay?! You’re not vomiting, right?!”\n“I, I said it was only on the first day…! Do you want me to do it…?!”\n“S-sorry. It was just so memorable.”\nHuff, whew…\nHe clutched his throbbing head.\n‘M-my head hurts…’\nNo matter how he thought about it, Dorothy’s ability didn’t suit him.\nStrengthening others is good, but his ability is close to being always active, so it’s like he’s constantly using the strengthened ability.\nIt may be fine for others, but it’s too much of a burden for him.\n‘Ugh, it hurts…’\nHe tried to take out Amelia quickly, but his momentary hesitation from the strange presence beside Arte allowed her to escape.\n“Yo-you surprised me…! Wh-what are you!? You caught my spear with your eyes closed!? E-even dad couldn’t catch me!”\n“That line is so cliche, Amelia… Are you from the past or something…?”\n“Oh, i-is that so? It shows up in classic movies sometimes. I wanted to try saying it once. Hehe~”\nWhile matching Amelia’s silly remarks, Siwoo glanced around Arte for a bit.\n… There’s nothing there?\nThen what was that presence he felt?\nWas it my imagination?\n“I let my guard down just now, but not anymore! I’ll deal with you properly!”\n“Ack, no! Don’t come after me!”\n“You come here! You did that, didn’t you?!”\nHe had no time to think more about the strange presence he felt.\nBecause Amelia, who thought Dorothy was the reason Siwoo caught her spear for some reason, was chasing her.\nIt’ll be disadvantageous if it becomes 2 vs 1.\nHe had to save Dorothy.\n___________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nI don’t have much to say today.\nRuminas, I hope you have a good evening!\nUgh, I’m sleepy\n_________________________\nTranslator’s Corner\n*Basically, it means the company around you influences you.

      "content": "“S-save me…! Save me please!”\n“Caught you…When?!”\n“Wow…”\nJust before Dorothy got caught by Amelia, Siwoo hurriedly picked up the threads he cut and tripped Amelia, eliciting an admiring voice from Arte.\nHe thought she would be annoyed rather than amazed.\n“Ugh, wh-what the…! Let go! Ow, why is it so sturdy?! Arte! Make this a bit weaker!”\n“That’s hard to do… Those are just threads. They aren’t supposed to…There, I cut it for you. Is that okay now?”\n“Ah, she got away!”\nSwish.\nIt was instantly cut by another thread.\nIt was easily cut by Siwoo’s sword last time, so it seemed weak to slashing attacks.\n“Huff, hah… T-too much run…”\n“Dorothy, no time to rest. Hurry.”\n“Ah, okay! The scarecrow said: I want a brain. The wizard…”\n“Ahahaha, sorry. Seems it won’t work a second time. An ability that strengthens allies… How rare!”\nAh, darn it.\nThey were found out.\n…Well, Dorothy has to recite a unique line to activate her ability.\nIt’s so distinctive that it’s easy to notice if she does the same thing twice.\nStill, they planned to use it at least twice before being found out…\nSiwoo wiped his face with his hand, sensing things had already gone wrong.\nArte’s threads weren’t slow enough for Dorothy to dodge.\nAs expected, Dorothy was instantly bound by her threads and immobilized.\n“Now then, you’re outnumbered, so what do you plan to do? You can admit defeat and forfeit if you want.”\n“…”\n“That’s great! Ahahaha, you can step down if you don’t want to look worse, Siwoo!”\nThe grinning faces of Arte and Amelia looked hatefully smug for some reason.\nYeah, that’s how it goes.\n“Sorry, but it’s not like there’s no way…”\n“…Alright, then show me that way you speak of.”\nIt can’t be helped now that it’s come to this.\n‘I may not look like it, but I’m a man too. I can’t just sit still after being mocked this much.’\n“I didn’t want to resort to this, but… Arte, you brought this upon yourself!”\n“…Huh?”\n“Come at me!”\n***\nI looked around anxiously.\nDorothy, neatly wrapped in thread, was stuck in the corner of the arena.\nAmelia caught her breath with a flushed face.\nMy already-used threads scattered everywhere.\n…And the protagonist, Siwoo, drenched in cold sweat.\n[W-wow… To think he can go that far… As expected of the protagonist, amazing evasive maneuvers!]\nIs this the time to be gazing at the protagonist in a trance?!\nI got impatient and kicked the ground for no reason.\nHearing that sound, Amelia accelerated once more.\nHaving accelerated multiple times, Amelia, now fast enough to be invisible even to my eyes, charged at Siwoo.\nWith my thread wound around her neck.\n“This time for sure, die!”\nThe threads placed around Siwoo instantly soaked up mana and tightened towards him.\n…And failed again.\nHe focused on breaking through one part of the encircling threads and escaped the net.\n“Amelia, die, you say. This is an exam. The goal is to subdue, not kill.”\n“Aaargh, another failure?! Shut up! It’s because you keep running away like a coward! Arte, one more time!”\n“…”\n“Arte? What are you doing! …Is there a problem?! Should I go alone?!”\nI’m in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime dilemma right now.\nAmelia doesn’t seem to have noticed since she’s focused on Siwoo, but I’ve used up all the threads I tried to conserve as much as possible.\n…In other words, I’m currently only wearing a leotard, school uniform, and jacket.\nThis is driving me crazy. What do I do?\nThe entire school is watching this match right now.\nOf course, the spectator seats are far away for safety, so they can’t see clearly, but won’t the students slowly realize something is off?\nWhy are that person’s clothes damaged when they haven’t been attacked at all?\nIt’s a problem even if they don’t suspect it.\nIf I fight more here, my clothes or leotard.\nI’ll have to give up one of the two.\nOf course, assuming I can subdue him right away, using the leotard is the right call.\nThe leotard is worn under the uniform so it won’t be seen.\n…But what if I still can’t catch him even after using up the leotard?\nIt’ll be a huge disaster. The moment that happens, my ability will be sealed.\nBut I can’t reveal the leotard in a place with so many eyes on me, either.\nWhat, what should I…?!\n“Eeek?!”\n“Amelia, you know you don’t match up well.”\n“So annoying!”\n“Just learn to sit still already.”\n[Ah, she’s caught. As expected, Amelia is at a disadvantage against Siwoo.]\nThis is bad.\nWh-what do I do…\nWhile I was pondering for a moment, Amelia was subdued.\nI think she asked me for help, but I was lost in thought and didn’t answer, so she must have gotten impatient and rushed in.\nAmelia disrupts the opponent with incredible speed, but it doesn’t work on Siwoo.\nIt was impressive how he seemed to predict where Amelia would charge from, placing his sword in the path beforehand as if predicting her hit-and-run tactics.\nHuh, but is that really Intuition?\nIsn’t it about gaining an extra sense to make it easier to dodge attacks?\nBut just now, it looked like he already moved his sword to that path before Amelia even moved.\n…Am I mistaken? It must be my imagination.\nThe Author said Siwoo’s ability is Intuition.\nI must have seen it wrong because Amelia’s speed and Siwoo’s reaction were too fast.\n“Arte. You’re the only one left.”\n“…So it seems.”\nSiwoo’s voice brought my mind back from momentary contemplation.\nRight now isn’t the time to think about such trivial matters. There’s a more important problem left.\n…How can I break through this terrible situation?\nMy mind started to go blank.\n“Now the numbers are even, so what do you plan to do? You can admit defeat and forfeit if you want.”\n“…”\nFor a moment, I didn’t understand what I heard.\n…What did Siwoo just say?\nDid he say I can admit defeat and forfeit?\nThose lines were the lines I said earlier.\nThe lines I said when urging the protagonist to surrender.\nClick.\nI clearly realized why he was fired up after hearing my words.\nOf course, that was my goal from the start, but suddenly, hearing those lines thrown back at me made my head feel like it was rushing with blood.\n[R-Reader-nim… A-are you angry?]\nAm I angry?\nOf course. The words I said were returned right back at me.\nI would admit defeat and lose, just as the protagonist said…!\n“Ha, haha… That’s a good one.”\n“Huh, uh…?”\n“Since you’ve said that much, I suppose you’re prepared.”\nThe threads of the black leotard under my uniform began to unravel one by one, slowly creating a spider web in the arena.\nI know very well I shouldn’t do this.\nI know that if I make a mistake, I might end up showing skin in front of others…\nI don’t care. It’ll work out somehow.\n***\n“Th-this isn’t right…?”\nSiwoo looked at the threads Arte scattered all over the arena in shock.\nThis confirmed it. Arte’s ability is to use her own clothes like consumables.\nAs proof, her stockings and gloves were gone at some point.\nArte also started showing lukewarm movements at one point, so he made the suggestion after subduing Amelia.\n‘…While throwing back the lines that pissed me off.’\nHe didn’t expect her to get this fired up. Arte had only shown me a leisurely side until now, so he thought she didn’t have much competitive spirit.\n“Let’s see if you can dodge this too.”\nHe flinched at Arte’s eerily glowing eyes, but suddenly Siwoo remembered.\nGloves, gone.\nStockings, gone.\nClothes and jacket, untouched.\n…Then where are these threads coming from now?\n“Try dodging. If you can.”\nSiwoo approached Arte while dodging the threads flying from all directions and sometimes striking them away.\nThe fight had already restarted. To beat Arte, he had to get somehow close to her.\nBut where are all these threads coming from…?\nSiwoo looked at Arte with questioning eyes and finally noticed.\nThe black leotard, normally visible on Arte’s neck, was gone.\n“N-no way…?”\n“What are you staring at?”\nSiwoo suddenly looked at the threads Arte deployed.\n…He couldn’t tell the color. They all looked a faint blue, wrapped in mana.\n“No, it can’t be. No matter how much you want to win, to do something like that…?”\nSiwoo touched a thread stuck on his sword and brought it to his nose.\nIt was a fatal opening during the fight, but the exam was no longer important to Siwoo.\nHis mind was already filled with other thoughts.\n“…What are you doing?”\nA faint scent came from the thread.\nA familiar smell.\nWhen?\n…The women’s changing room, inside Arte’s locker.\n“Arte, you…”\n“Yes?”\nSiwoo looked at Arte with shocked eyes.\nThe leotard wasn’t visible on her neck.\nAnd the scent he smelled before was faintly wafting from the thread cut by his sword.\n‘…Th-this is.’\nSiwoo realized.\nThings will go very wrong if they keep fighting.\n“Arte, let’s stop fighting–”\n“What do you mean by that? You’re saying that you want me to give up after this?”\n“N-no. That’s not it…!”\n“…”\nArte started attacking me while manipulating the threads as if to say she was done waiting.\nEven as he reflexively dodged her attacks, his mind spun, trying to figure out what to do.\nShould I surrender?\nJudging by her reaction, she thinks I’m trying to win by drawing out the battle. She’ll get angry then. It’ll be the same even if I lose on purpose.\n‘But I’m weaker than Arte, so I can’t win.’\nHe was barely managing to dodge right now. Small cuts on his clothes appeared while thinking unnecessary thoughts…\n…His clothes are getting torn?\n“Ugh, I’ll have to buy a new uniform. This one was expensive…!”\n“…?!”\nSiwoo prayed inwardly.\nHoping she would understand what he meant.\n“I surrender.”\n“What? Arte, are you serious? You were fighting well until just now.”\n“Yes, Teacher. My head is starting to hurt a bit.”\n“…I see. Doesn’t seem like you’re giving up. Got it.”\nTeacher Claire declared the end of the match with a displeased expression.\nTh-thank goodness…\nSiwoo finally realized he had passed the dangerous hurdle and sighed.\nHe suddenly looked up and saw the numerous students.\nIf they had kept fighting like that…\nSiwoo didn’t want to think about it anymore.\nThat was close.\n“By the way, Arte’s ability is really annoying. What should I do with these threads…? I’m sorry, but Siwoo, can you throw these threads away on your way out?”\n“Yes, I understand… What?!”\n“I’m counting on you. I have to repair the arena.”\nSiwoo suddenly sniffed.\nHe felt like her scent lingered from the threads sprawled across the arena.\nAuthor’s Notes\nOriginally, I wanted to continue the fight in the next chapter, but I realized it might be better to put it in one, so this one is longer than usual.",

      "content": "“…That was a close call.”\nIt was a truly dangerous moment.\nI can’t believe I almost did something crazy, unable to control my emotions at the moment.\nI shudder to think what would have happened if I hadn’t come to my senses and instead let my pride take over.\nAs I was imagining the worst-case scenario, Amelia suddenly appeared out of nowhere to check on me.\n“Arte! A-are you okay?! You said your head hurts!”\n“…Oh, I’m fine. Don’t worry. I feel better now.”\n“R-really? That’s a relief.”\nShe’s so quick to believe my lie about having a headache.\nAmelia can be quite naive at times.\nHer identity as a rich young lady is easy to forget.\nJudging from her actions, she seems more like a rowdy tomboy from a dangerous family than a prim and proper rich girl.\n“Still, it’s a shame. I really wanted to win and advance.”\n“…Was there a reason you wanted to win so badly?”\n“Well, if I got good results today, I wouldn’t have to attend classes tomorrow since I would have gotten 1st place.”\n“Ah.”\n…Come to think of it, I wonder if there’s a loser’s bracket in this tournament we’re doing.\nI heard that those who place high enough accumulate sufficient data and don’t need to do rematches in the loser’s bracket.\nSo that’s why everyone was so fired up. They didn’t want to go to class.\n“Then, just in case, you should rest up.”\n“Thank you, Amelia. Let’s do our best tomorrow.”\n“Yeah!”\nAmelia disappeared as quickly as she had come, like the wind.\nI wonder where she’s off to.\nI’m a bit curious, but I don’t feel like prying.\nI’m exhausted today. I just want to rest.\n“Author-nim, I’m sorry… I think I’ll just rest today…”\n[O-of course. You must be mentally drained after that ordeal. …But I’m satisfied since we got a lot of good scenes!]\n“Good for you.”\nThankfully, the Author was considerate of my feelings.\nPerhaps it’s because she is also a woman, so she took into account how I nearly exposed myself naked in front of the whole school.\nNo, but then she shouldn’t have given me this ridiculous ability in the first place.\nI wanted to take this chance to confront the Author about various things, but I gave up.\nShe probably just thoughtlessly decided it would be cool and created this ability.\nAnd then she likely haphazardly patched things together when it was too overpowered. I’m certain of it.\n“Since it’s a rare break, maybe I should eat something delicious…”\n[Ooh, then please eat some meat! Meat! Something that looks tasty!]\n“…Alright, sure. I like meat too. How about steak today?”\n[Steak! That sounds delicious! Do you know how to cook?]\n“Simple dishes, at least.”\nSometimes, the Author requests that I eat certain things.\nI’ve never watched those, so I’m not sure, but it’s probably similar.\nAnyway, it’s a long-awaited break. I’ll do my best to make the most delicious meal I can.\nSavoring this leisurely moment, I headed to the supermarket.\n***\n“…What the. Siwoo, what are you doing there?”\n“Dorothy collapsed from exhaustion, so I’m making a quick trip to the infirmary.”\n“I see? …Congrats on your win, by the way. Guess you won’t have to come to the academy tomorrow.”\n“You have a way with compliments…”\n“Why? Isn’t it nice to skip academy for a day and rest up?”\nIt is nice, but still…\nNo matter what, isn’t it a bit much to openly express joy at the prospect of not attending the academy?\n“By the way, you. You disappeared for a bit after our match ended. What were you doing?”\n“Huh?! Oh, n-nothing! I wasn’t doing anything!”\n“…? What’s with you? If it was nothing, then it was nothing. Why are you so flustered? Got something to hide?”\nAh.\nSiwoo’s gaze suddenly fell on his uniform pocket.\n“What’s that? Got something in your pocket?”\n“Oh, n-no. It’s nothing…!”\nPlop.\nWith disheartening ease, Amelia snatched the object from Siwoo’s pocket.\nUnlike Amelia, who had plenty of time to rest, Siwoo had been in matches up until a moment ago.\nSo even though his Intuition alerted him to Amelia’s approach, he couldn’t evade her.\n…That was the downside of Intuition. No matter how well you sense an incoming attack, it’s meaningless if you’re in a situation where you can’t dodge.\n“…Thread? Isn’t this from earlier? The one from your fight with Arte. Why do you have it?”\n“Uh, w-well. The teacher told me to clean it up…”\n“Wasn’t this made with mana? Why is the thread still here?”\nSiwoo realized it. There was no getting out of this situation.\nIf he tried to play dumb and say he missed his chance to throw it away, how would she react?\n…He had no choice but to explain Arte’s ability.\nSo, trembling as he imagined her response, Siwoo had no choice but to recount what happened.\n“About that, the thing is…”\n“…What were you thinking?!”\n“Ack, s-sorry…”\nThe moment Amelia heard the explanation, she started berating him.\nAs expected, even Amelia finds this hard to accept, huh?\nIt can’t be helped. I would feel the same if I were her…\n“Why did you let Arte notice there?!”\n“…Huh?”\n“You should have stripped everything off! You clueless idiot!”\n“…What?”\nHis head, which had been drooping with guilt, snapped up in an instant.\n…What did Amelia just say?\nHe should have stripped everything without Arte noticing?\n“Y-you, what are you…”\n“Aaah, I knew it! The thread didn’t disappear! It wasn’t made with mana! …What were you doing, not stripping it all off?!”\n“Are you crazy?”\nHe blurted out something harsh without thinking, but he didn’t care at all.\nAmelia didn’t seem to mind either. No, far from minding, she was denouncing his actions back then.\n“Completely stripping would have made achieving the goal so much easier…!”\n“So I was supposed to stand there and watch as her clothes got torn off in front of all those people?!”\nI underestimated you, Amelia.\nHe had a feeling.\nHe did consider the possibility that she might suggest stripping without hesitation.\n…But to think she would actually say it.\nHe felt like he would lose his mind.\n“Stripping it all off was the key to raising her affection…!”\n“…How in the world?”\nSiwoo couldn’t understand at all.\nHaving your clothes torn off in front of others raises affection?\nJust what kind of mindset does Amelia have?\nIt made no sense based on his common sense.\n“Sigh. To think you didn’t even know that. …Think about it, Siwoo.”\n“Why am I being treated like an ignorant person…?”\n“If Arte’s clothes had been completely stripped off, how would she have reacted?”\nShe’s not even pretending to listen.\nThere’s no stopping Amelia once she gets like this.\nAll he can do is obediently go along with it.\n“… Wouldn’t she be embarrassed, even if it’s Arte?”\n“That’s right… Imagine Arte’s reaction, her leotard half torn off, exposing her bare skin underneath…”\nFollowing Amelia’s words, he tried to imagine it.\nArte with a flushed face as her leotard gets ripped, revealing the flesh underneath…\n“What are you making me imagine?!”\n“Just her naked appearance? Anyway. It would be hard for her to walk around in that embarrassing state.”\n“Obviously…”\n“And that’s when you gallantly remove and drape your coat over her!”\n“…?”\n“Imagine how embarrassed she would be. Then, you coolly offer your coat! Arte, grateful, would have developed at least some affection for you! But you ruined it!”\n…Is that right?\nSiwoo pondered deeply.\nIf her bare skin were exposed, Arte would be embarrassed… It makes sense.\nAnd if he draped his jacket over her, she would be grateful… Probably, right?\nAnd that gratitude would turn into affection, creating a nice mood…?\nStrange.\nHe definitely wanted to refute it, but he couldn’t seem to.\nIt feels like there’s nothing logically wrong with it…?\n“And she should have been attracted to your manly scent on the coat, thinking ‘So masculine…’! What a waste…”\n“Wh-what…! Don’t spout nonsense!”\n“…? What’s with you? Why are you suddenly worked up?”\n“S-s-scent?! People don’t get attracted to the opposite sex because of something like that!”\n“No, but there are plenty of cases where people are drawn to the scent of the opposite sex.”\n“No! It’s not like that, period!”\nUntil the sun disappeared, Amelia chattered on and on.\nAfter returning home and lying on his bed, Siwoo finally noticed the sensation in his pocket.\nHe had forgotten to throw away the thread.\n“…”\nWhat should he do with this?\n***\n“Let’s see, the temperature is… perfect!”\n[Woooow… It looks delicious… Aren’t you going to eat it right away?]\n“It needs to rest first. Have to wait a bit.”\n[Heeeh… I thought it would be fine to eat it as is. It looks tasty.]\n“It’s not cooked through yet. The inside is still raw and bloody.”\n[I see.]\nI spent the resting time leisurely chatting with the Author.\n… It’s a bit boring. Maybe I should turn on the news.\n– There is growing concern among citizens as news about the villain Arachne, a hot topic on the internet recently, has become scarce. Let’s discuss why people are worried about villains…\nClick.\nI turned off the TV. Ugh, what boring stuff.\nI clapped my hand twice.\n“Did you call?”\n“D-did you call for me, Master?!”\n“…What, were you guys that close?”\n“Y-yes. Well, we found we have quite a bit in common.”\nThings in common?\n…Ah, that’s right. Those two are from the same organization. Lyla is a newbie, while Spira is an executive.\n“You haven’t eaten dinner yet, right? Take this. It’s steak.”\n“I-is this my final meal?! Did I fail in my duties? Sh-should I lick your feet?!”\n“…?”\nSpira’s outburst left Lyla and me staring at her in confusion.\nWhat’s going on?\n“Wait a moment. To make it easier to eat… There, done.”\n“Eek…”\n… What’s with her?\nI cut the rested steak into neat cubes with thread to make it easier to eat, but she looked terrified.\nIs she concerned about hygiene? …I coated it with mana, so there are no bacteria or anything.\nBut I guess she’s the type to be particular about that. My bad, I did something thoughtless.\n“You can put it over rice in a bowl or make a salad to eat with it. Here, take it.”\n“…Okay. Thanks.”\n“Don’t mention it.”\nNow that the subordinates have been given attention, I’ll have a relaxing meal, too.\nI cut the grilled steak into small cubes and took my plate to my room upstairs.\n“Mmm, delicious.”\n[I’m jealous…]\nPerhaps because it’s a long-awaited break.\nI was in a great mood.\n__________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nThe artist for the cover has been decided.\nI’m looking forward to it!",

      "content": "“…Aaah, what should we do?”\n[About what?]\n“You know, Author-nim. Übermensch.”\n[Aah… Right. You said we need to reduce their numbers…]\n“Sigh.”\nI had no idea what to do.\nI have to cut them down to just four.\n…How am I supposed to do that?\nThere’s not much time left. The end-of-term ceremony is coming up soon.\nJust four.\nFour should be enough.\nDorothy, Siwoo, Amelia, and me.\nIt would be best if each of us handled one.\n“…No matter what happens, there will be an attack during the end-of-term ceremony, right?”\n[Yes! That’s the plan! Mmm, but I haven’t decided how strong to make the villains yet.]\n“Hmm…”\nHow should I go about this?\n…No, should I just kill them all before the ceremony in the first place?\n“Author-nim, do you have any other villains in mind besides those guys?”\n[Why would I?]\n“…”\nI shouldn’t have asked.\nI knew very well that the Author didn’t think much about these things.\nEven if the Author says this, more villains are bound to be added.\nWe had no choice but to prune the villain groups because there were too many, but we’ve barely gotten through half of the 1st year.\nTo move the plot forward, new obstacles need to be created.\nAs I mentioned, the academy novel genre is about presenting trials, overcoming them, and feeling catharsis from seeing the protagonist’s growth.\nOf course, we could keep those guys alive and use them somehow, but then the Author’s readers would make a fuss.\nThey would ask why we didn’t kill the enemies and let them live.\nIf they complained like that, would the Author be able to handle it mentally?\n…I was doubtful. The Author I’ve seen so far doesn’t seem like she could endure something like that.\n[Why don’t we kill them all like last time without overthinking it?]\n“If it were that easy, I would have done it already.”\nThe Author’s stance was that there would be no problem if I killed them all and returned like before.\nBut it wasn’t such a simple issue.\nPeople’s eyes and ears were already focused on the villain group called Arachne.\n“Can I kill the detective, Lee Ha-Yul?”\n[Ugh, it would be such a waste… A detective chasing villains, that’s so cool… D-do we really have to kill him?]\nSee?\nThe Author didn’t want to kill off the detective. It probably fits her tastes or something.\nWell, I can understand. There’s always something that catches your fancy.\n…The problem is, I feel like Detective Lee Ha-Yul will get in the way.\nKilling him would be the quickest solution. He’s a supporting character who won’t appear in the main story.\nI don’t need to concern myself with those who can’t even make it onto the main stage, but…\nIt’s a different story if it’s someone the Author cherishes. There’s no point in me insisting that I should kill him.\nEven if I somehow get rid of him, it will severely strain my relationship with the Author.\n…If that happens, what will become of me?\nA chill suddenly ran down my spine, and I stopped thinking.\nDon’t think about it.\nDon’t think…\nBefore I knew it, I had dialed a number saved on my phone.\n[The call is being recorded.]\n“It’s me.”\n[Arte-nim…! Please wait a moment!]\nClatter clatter.\nSuch noises could be heard from the other end of the phone.\n…I didn’t call the wrong number, did I?\nI lifted the phone and checked the contact again.\nIt’s correct. Association executive.\n“The outcome is certainly impressive.”\n[Ahem! It’s all thanks to my competence!]\n“…”\nC-competence…?\nNo, well, they’re indeed competent.\nThere’s a reason the Association’s higher-ups are so subservient to me. It’s because of the Author.\n‘Arachne has deeply infiltrated the Association.’\nThe setting that I asked to be put in because Lee Ha-Yul was being annoying.\nIt was just a setting casually thrown in, but I never thought it would be used like this.\n[Please tell us. We are ready. Do you plan to purge all the villains?]\n“…Ah, that’s not it. I was just curious about something.”\n[I-is that so? Please ask us anything!]\nWhat the hell is with these guys?\nThey’re supposed to be traitors of the Association, pawns of Arachne.\nThrough the phone, I can hear the breathing of multiple people, not just one. Did they gather everyone just now?\nI thought there would only be one…\n… I’ll have to probe. It seems the empty background has naturally changed due to the setting.\n“By the way, it feels strange. To think that the Association, which hates villains, is conversing with a villain like this.”\n[…A villain, you say? That’s going too far.]\n“But the Association has designated Arachne as a villain organization, haven’t they? A very dangerous organization at that.”\n[While that is an unavoidable action for the Association, you know very well that we do not consider your organization a villain group.]\nThe middle-aged man’s voice naturally rose as if boasting with pride.\n[The system of society cannot kill villains. Because that’s the law. As a result, citizens suffer, and even if criminals are caught, they just rot in prison for life!\nMoreover, most of them can even go free through plea bargains! All because we lack manpower!]\n“… That’s right. But most of them fail and die on the battlefield.”\n[Trash of society does not deserve human rights. Those bastards have forfeited it! Isn’t it ridiculous for them to assert it when they have violated the rights of others?\nWe cannot accept it! Do those creatures really need to have rights?! They are not human!\n…But the law cannot punish them, and the suffering of citizens only grows by the day. That’s why we can only rely on you, Arachne! I—]\nAfter the excited voice caused a brief commotion on the other end of the phone, the voice changed.\nThis time, it was also the voice of someone quite old. It’s only natural, considering they’ve risen to the executive level.\n[That is why we support you, Arachne.\nThe law is always imperfect, and it takes too long to improve it—at least until all evil is eliminated.\nShould we inconvenience those who voluntarily act as society’s cleaners? So please tell us. What do you want?]\n…Aha.\nI roughly understand.\nTo fill in the setting that “Arachne and the Association have a close relationship,” it seems the setting naturally became that the Association’s higher-ups hate villains.\nThey frequently clash directly with villains, so they must have witnessed all sorts of dirty things.\nSo the longer someone has been in the Association, especially those in high positions, the deeper their hatred for villains… I think it’s acceptable to interpret it that way.\nTo those executives, Arachne is a janitor.\nOne that washes the filthy city clean.\n“Do you know about the investigator chasing Arachne? What is he doing now?”\n[That man is currently on leave. Having duties forcibly suspended due to external pressure is a huge shock. He’s probably resting.]\n“Hmm…”\nResting, my foot.\nHe’s the type of person who would persistently suspect me even if I had a solid alibi proving I wasn’t the culprit.\nI don’t think someone like that would easily succumb to external pressure. He would chase after me even if it meant turning his back on the Association.\nIf I can’t kill or kick out such a bothersome leech…\nI can just stick him onto the other side, can’t I?\n“Reinstate him. Tell him Arachne has appeared and that you need his strength.”\n[What? What do you…]\n“We have located Übermensch’s position. Their numbers are half of the remaining forces. Four executives.”\n[…!]\nActually, that’s a lie.\nWhat location? I don’t know anything.\nBut there’s nothing to worry about. This world is the Author’s puppet show. I just need to ask her.\nIf too many props are behind the puppet show, it’s only right to remove unnecessary pieces.\n“Their objective is to steal something hidden within the academy.”\n[Then that means…]\n“They’ll attack the academy at some point, right? Since that’s their goal…”\n[…We will strengthen security.]\n“That’s not the right way. Do you know when they’ll attack? If you raise your guard too much, it will be harder to grasp the situation.”\nThat’s a lie.\nIn fact, I know exactly when they will attack and how many of them there will be.\nNo matter what happens, they will attempt an attack on the day of the end-of-term ceremony.\n…But I have no obligation to tell them that. Because it’s an event that Siwoo needs to experience and grow from.\nSimply watching is enough for the puppets that can’t even make it onto the stage.\n“Just reduce the numbers to the point where they feel uneasy but still think it’s possible. As for the rest…”\n[…I understand. It’s a necessary sacrifice.]\n“That’s the idea.”\n[We will take care of what you mentioned right away.]\n“I’m counting on you.”\nI hung up the phone unilaterally.\nThere was nothing more to discuss.\n“Aah, this is so… tiring!”\n[Th-that was so cool! A cool villain sweeping away an evil organization from behind the scenes!]\n“What’s so cool about it… I’m not a villain, and I’m not an evil organization, you know?”\nI brushed off the Author’s nonsense.\nMe, an evil organization?\nA secret society, maybe.\n…Anyway, I’m looking forward to it.\nThe longer someone is in the Association, the deeper their hatred for villains becomes.\nI wonder what the Ha-Yul thinks about villains.\nHe has seen more directly than anyone else what villains do and how they act.\nPerhaps, as the Author said, there’s no need to kill him.\nI felt good.\n***\n“…Crazy.”\n“Hic, hic… It’s a good thing I got down on my knees and begged…!”\nLyla and Spira were terrified.\nThey couldn’t believe what they had heard was true.\n“…You, you heard the same thing as me, right?”\n“The Master is connected to the Association…?”\n“Crazy… We heard it loud and clear.”\nThey didn’t hear everything.\nBut they clearly heard Arte giving orders to the high-ranking members of the Association.\nMoreover, what did they discuss?\n“Half of Übermensch will disappear…”\n“…”\nLyla let out a sigh of relief.\nFortunately, they left the rotten lifeline that would snap soon.\nIf they had kept climbing, who knows what would have happened to them.\nThey almost became cube steak.\n_______________________________\nAuthor’s notes\nAh, right. There’s one thing I wanted to tell you about yesterday but forgot!\nThe emoticon rough sketch has arrived! Wow!\nThe Author(not me) had glasses on… I immediately requested them to remove it…\nOff with the glasses!\nAlso, the emoticon of the Author giving a flick has been replaced with one showing her receiving it and crying.\nAfter already getting hit…!",

      "content": "“…This is the place.”\nHa-Yul gazed at the deserted back alley.\nA back alley where you couldn’t see ahead, let alone sense any presence, due to the lack of light sources.\nIt was a different world from the dazzling night view of the city that hurt the eyes in the distance. He moved his feet to such a place and expressed his doubts.\n“Why is there no one here? This place is strange…What is this?”\nThis is definitely the spot.\nHe was sent to by his superiors, who even canceled the vacation they had given him, saying there was an urgent task.\nThey had given him a vacation to get him away from the field, but now they were calling him back.\nHis annoyance was about to explode, but he somehow suppressed it and came to the designated location, only to find this.\nForget about there being anything. There wasn’t even a single person. There should at least be someone to explain the situation.\n…He had a hunch. That something was up.\n“Whew… Huff…”\nTo calm his mind and body, he took out a cigarette from her pocket and put it in his mouth.\nBased on his experience with countless superhuman crimes, he always had to be thoroughly prepared if he were put into an abnormal situation.\nIf he noticed nothing wrong, then he subconsciously realized that something was suspicious.\n“To get this unpleasant feeling at a location designated by my superiors. What on earth is going on…”\n“As expected of an investigator, you have good instincts. You remind me of Siwoo.”\n“?!”\nThere was definitely no sign of anyone’s presence!\nThe moment he heard the voice, Ha-Yul kicked the ground to leave the spot and took a deep breath.\nWhoever it was, to address him without any presence in a place like this.\nIt was extremely suspicious.\n‘I have to subdue them immediately and find out what’s going on…!’\n“Oh my, don’t move. If you do… you’ll die?”\n“…D-damn it.”\nCold sweat trickled down.\nThrough the smoke from the cigarette he was smoking, he saw thin threads.\nThe threads were spread out as if enveloping him. To others, they might seem like ordinary threads.\n…But he could instinctually tell. His life was no longer in his hands.\nHe had seen these threads many times. He had investigated them thoroughly before he went on vacation, so there was no way he couldn’t remember.\nThey were Arachne’s threads.\n‘Damn it. If only I had a little more time!’\nThen these measly threads wouldn’t even be able to touch him.\nIf he showed even the slightest sign of resistance, it was obvious that his neck would be gone in an instant.\n… It’s over.\n“… Wasn’t Arachne only supposed to kill villains? Ha, this is why I hate villains. If something doesn’t go as you, you’ll do anything…”\n‘Was I a hindrance?’\nWhile chasing Arachne, he had thought it would be dangerous. Still, he never imagined there would be retaliation when he had stopped the pursuit.\n‘Damn, am I going to die here?’\nClaire’s nagging voice suddenly came to his mind.\nShe was always noisy, telling him to stop doing dangerous things.\nWhen she was worried that another incident would occur where she lost her former colleague and friend, Ha-Yul brushed it off, telling her not to worry.\n‘… She’s going to cry a lot again. Damn it. I had decided not to make her cry anymore.’\n“Hello, Investigator. It’s been a while?”\nThump, thump.\nIn the alley with no people and no sound, the footsteps echoed hauntingly.\nThe sight of her approaching was perhaps to be expected.\n“…So it was you after all, Arte Iris. You were the culprit.”\nThe girl he had been continuously suspected approached him with her ominous eyes slightly open.\nHer smile, combined with those ominous eyes, felt as if they were mocking me.\n“You’ve been quite a nuisance, Investigator. To bother me even when I have an alibi.”\n“…”\n“What do you think I’ll do to you?”\nIt’s obvious without even looking.\nThe instinct to eliminate bothersome obstacles is common to all humans, and in a way, it’s a natural behavior.\nIf it’s a person, most people avoid them, try to correct them, or endure it, but…\nVillains are different.\nThere’s no need to go through the trouble. They can just get rid of nuisances.\n“You’ll kill me. Damn it.”\n“No, I was going to let you live.”\n“What?”\nWhat is she talking about?\n‘…Not going to kill me? Why?’\n“There’s a reason for everything. I have no intention of killing you.”\n“…Then why did you attack me?”\n“Oh my, attack? Let’s call it restraint, shall we? You’re not even hurt anywhere.”\nHer blunt words were repulsive.\nIn the end, she’s also a villain. Although she’s still keeping him alive, it must be because she has some kind of plan.\nHaving his life held hostage by a villain, his mood plummeted to the depths.\n“…Well, it’s nothing much. I just want to make you an offer.”\n“An offer?”\n“Yes, an offer. It’s not difficult.”\nWhoosh.\nIn an instant, the threads floating around him wrapped around his body and forcibly lifted him to his feet.\n“?!”\n“Ah, don’t move, okay? I’m not used to this, so I might tear your limbs if you resist too much. If you don’t want to end up in the hospital, it’s best to stay still.”\nHearing Arte’s words, he completely relaxed my body.\nResistance was meaningless. It was obvious that doing so in this situation would yield no results.\nThe thought that he would either die or experience an excruciatingly painful time crossed his mind.\n“What’s the offer?”\n“… It’s not difficult, right? Come, let’s go together.”\nHe didn’t even want to think about what happened after that.\nA terrible sensation.\nAs if his body wasn’t his own. Like walking on clouds in a dream.\nHa-Yul realized how unpleasant it was to entrust your body to someone else.\nIt felt like becoming a puppet tied to the strings of a puppeteer.\nNo, it’s not even different, is it? He was literally tied up with threads and forcibly dragged around.\nTo think that he would end up entrusting his life, which he wouldn’t even fully trust to a reliable colleague, to a villain.\nIt was truly a cruel twist of fate.\n“Well, we’ve arrived.”\n“Where is this?”\n“The outskirts of Übermensch’s hideout. A place where half of the remaining remnants are.”\n“…!”\nHa-Yul didn’t know what she was trying to do, but Ha-Yul could easily imagine what would happen here.\nSuddenly, the terrible scene from the mountain lodge came to mind, which was why he first took on the Arachne case.\n“Now, look over there. They’re villains.”\n“…Villains? What are they doing right now?”\n“What else? You’ll know when you see it, right?”\n‘What on earth is she trying to show me?’\nIt was too dark to see clearly, so he unconsciously squinted his eyes to look, and only after they adjusted to the darkness did he realize.\nA disgusting act was unfolding.\n“Why are you showing this to me? I’ve already seen countless things like this. If you were trying to shock me…”\n“No, it’s not about shock or anything. …Those people, if it were you, what would you do to them?”\n“What?”\n“If it were you, what would you do to them?”\n“What a strange question. Of course, arrest…”\n“And after arresting them?”\nAbruptly.\nHis eyes, focused on the disgusting scene, now captured Arte’s ominous eyes.\nShe looked like the devil.\n“If you arrest them, they will go to prison, right?”\n“Of course. If you commit a crime, you have to pay the price.”\n“Are the victims satisfied?”\n“What?”\n“The victims who were harmed by the villains. What did they and their bereaved families say?”\n“Th-that’s…”\nAt her question, he seemed to hear the resentment of the countless victims he had met.\nIt’s not just one or two.\nWhy is the sentence only that much? Why are they released after paying bail?\nWhy, why, why, why.\nThe words of numerous victims echoed in his ears.\n“Don’t you have it too? The experience of someone close to you being seriously hurt by villains. …Like a colleague dying?”\n“H-how do you know that…!”\n“It’s only natural if you’ve been in this industry for over a decade. Isn’t that right? That villain who hurt your loved one, what is he doing now?”\n“He’s serving his sentence. Why are you…!”\n“Aha. I see… Are you sure?”\n“What are you trying to say?!”\n“Doesn’t that person look somewhat familiar?”\nHa-Yul, who was about to shout something at Arte, had no choice but to shut his mouth.\n…The sight of a familiar face.\n“N-no way…”\n“Serving his sentence? Ahaha. Then who is that person over there?”\n“Th-that can’t be. That’s impossible. He killed an Association detective! A criminal who killed a superhuman!”\n“You know it too, don’t you? That villains can also return to society.”\n“…!”\nHe knows.\nThe fact that if you break through the extreme survival rate and serve for a certain period on the front lines, you can return to society.\nBut, no way. There’s no way…!\n“The criminal who killed your former colleague is committing another crime. This time as part of a much larger criminal organization.”\n“…”\n“Ah, but what can we do? Even if a villain is caught, if they’re lucky, they can return to society again. Since he survived once, the second time will be even easier.”\n“…”\n“The number of unfortunate victims will only increase, and the suffering of the citizens will pierce the sky!”\nThe horrific scene before his eyes and the heinous scene etched in his mind overlapped.\nThe victims are different. But the perpetrator is the same.\nThe monster who killed people and laughed openly was repeating the same actions after being released into society.\n“…What on earth are you trying to say?”\n“Ahaha, ahahaha! Have you finally become willing to listen?”\n“Tell me! Fucking tell me! What are you trying to say?!”\nArte, laughing loudly enough to be heard by the villains in the distance, suddenly stopped laughing and said to me.\n“Investigator Lee Ha-Yul.”\n“…”\n“I will make you an offer you cannot refuse.”\nThe threads slowly loosened.\nEven though the threads on my arms and legs had loosened, allowing him to escape, he stood rooted to the spot.\nEven when the threads around his neck, which had forced him to look at the terrible scene, loosened, he still kept watch over that scene.\nHe was already caught by the devil.\n“Arachne wants you.”\n“…Me?”\n“Won’t you join us in cleansing society of its trash?”\n_______________________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nWhy do people have to work on the weekends?\nBosses are bad!!!\nOh, and I’ve made a post for all of the fanarts.\nI’ll update it whenever I get new ones.",

      "content": "“…Hey, Spira.”\n“Yes?”\n“I’m so scared.”\n“…Me too.”\nLyla, who was watching the situation unfold from afar on Arte’s orders, was flustered.\nArte was “talking” with an investigator from the Association. Moreover, he’s in charge of metahuman crimes.\nIt was a very important position. Even a small mistake can easily lead to a major disaster.\nThat’s why the department members are elites capable of performing all duties, such as combat, civilian protection, and investigation.\nThey have front-line experience as a basic requirement and are recognized as competent talents by the upper echelons.\nTo openly reveal her identity and attempt to coax such a person was reckless.\nIf she had killed him at the moment of subduing him, that would be one thing, but to set him free and try to persuade him?\nLyla briefly had a happy imagination of Arte getting caught and becoming a free person.\n…As the word “imagination” implies, she returned with the investigator.\n“Nice to meet you. I’m a newcomer to Arachne, but I’ll be working with you from now on.”\n“Y-yes…”\nIt’s awkward. No, it’s beyond awkward, it’s terrifying…\nThe fact that someone who chases villains every day is right next to them made cold sweat trickle down.\n…Why, why did he come over?!\nWasn’t he supposed to be super competent?!\nAn investigator who needs both power to solve cases and a sense of justice to handle the heavy workload is now standing as one of them.\n‘These incompetent Association bastards…!’\n“…By the way, judging from your appearance, could you be related to Übermensch?”\n“Eek! N-no, we’re not with Übermensch!”\n“Y-yeah. Right. Uh, um… H-how do we prove it?!”\n“Uh, well… A-Arachne forever! Death to villains! Long live Arte-nim! Long live Master!”\n“L-long live Arte! Yay! Death to Übermensch! D-death to Trash!”\nThey frantically scrambled, not even knowing what they were saying in response to the sharp question that came out of nowhere.\nLyla had wolf ears and a tail. Spira’s lower body is a snake.\nAnyone can see they were part of the Übermensch. It’s impossible to deny.\n‘…In that case, let’s appeal that we’ve washed our hands of them as much as possible!’\nJust as they were resolving ourselves, Arte explained to the investigator.\n“Don’t worry too much. They are Arachne members who deliberately infiltrated the organization.”\n“…Is that so?”\n“Yes, that’s exactly it.”\nArte smiled at them.\n“We can’t find out everything, right? Doesn’t someone have to make sacrifices and infiltrate the enemy?”\n“I-indeed…”\n…She seems skilled at this. It’s not the work of someone who’s only done it once or twice.\nHas she done this a lot?\n“I apologize. I made a mistake…”\n“Oh, n-no.”\n“Yeah. We’re fine.”\nEven though they were startled by his bowing figure, they couldn’t help it.\nHe’s a member of the Association, the head of metahuman crimes!\nMoreover, according to Arte, he’s a veteran who has been doing this for over a decade!\nRookies with overwhelming talent were scary.\nBut there are plenty of people who fail despite it.\nBut someone who has been a detective for over a decade is not only scary but also awe-inspiring.\nJust how capable are they to last that long while dealing with villains?\n…No, how did she persuade such a person in the first place?\n“Well, now that we have a new colleague, let’s use this momentum to clean up the villains…”\n“That will be difficult.”\n“Why is that?”\n“By now, someone from the Association should be waiting at the designated location. We need to hurry…”\n“Ah, don’t worry about that. You’ve already met them.”\n“…Pardon?”\nIn response to him expressing doubt as if he heard something strange, Arte smiled.\n“Investigator Ha-Yul, if you think about it for a bit, you’ll understand… Is it really a coincidence that Arachne and Übermensch are together near the location designated by the Association?”\n“N-no way…”\n“It’s not for nothing that the higher-ups told you to stop tracking Arachne.”\n“…I see. I understand.”\n“Good. Since we are four here, we can each handle one.”\nThe only person who calmly accepted Arte’s bombshell statement was the investigator.\nSpira and Lyla didn’t want to understand what they just heard.\nThe higher-ups told him to stop tracking Arachne?\nMoreover, if the person designated by the Association is Arte, then…\n“T-the Association is condoning a villain who goes around killing people…”\n“Oh my. Watch your words, okay?… They’re not people; they’re villains, right?”\n“Eek. Y-yes… O-of course! They’re villains!”\nD-damn, the Association…\nThe reason Arte can act so freely is because the Association is backing her!\nThe Association has been working behind the scenes to kill off troublesome villains!\n“…Ah, right. Lyla.”\n“Huh?! Wh-what?”\n“Just a moment.”\nArte approached her and stroked her neck.\nLyla thought she was just a crazy murderer, but she turned out to be a human butcher who had the Association’s permission to kill people.\n“…There. So, how is it? Comfortable?”\n“Uh, yeah…?”\n“Your neck. Touch it. How does it feel?”\n‘M-my neck…?’\nAt Arte’s words, she brought her hand to her neck, and the soft sensation of the collar she had grown accustomed to was no longer there.\n‘D-don’t tell me, now that she has a new colleague, she doesn’t need me, a former villain…?’\n“I think it’s past the time for betrayal. There’s no need to wear an uncomfortable collar anymore. Right?”\n“R-right…”\nYeah.\nArte is right. Lyla can’t even dream of betraying her now.\nShe initially followed her because her life was threatened.\nThe reason she continued to follow her was for her own safety.\nShe would have run away immediately if there had been a chance to escape.\n…But not anymore.\nBecause she realized that her opponent, who had exploited her inferiority complex, was such a powerful being.\nBecause she became convinced that no matter where she ran, she would eventually be found.\nLyla no longer felt an inferiority complex. There’s no way she could.\nAn inferiority complex is a feeling you get towards someone better than you… However, you don’t feel inferior to someone on another level of power.\nDominance.\n“There happen to be four executives here, and there are four of us.”\n“…So one per person?”\n“Exactly. You can handle it, right?”\n“Y-yes! L-leave it to us!”\n“…”\nLyla nodded at Arte.\nWhether she can do it or not,\nShe no longer needed to think about such things.\nShe must have a plan and see things that she can’t see.\nIf it were impossible, she wouldn’t have asked in the first place.\nOn this day, Lyla, who had an inferiority complex towards her classmate, surrendered to her.\nShe suddenly remembered the pills Arte had given her before, which she had carried until now.\nAs expected, Arte must have thought everything through.\n***\n“…Phew.”\nExhaling the smoke from my mouth, he looked at the trash before me.\n“Tch, an intruder! Quickly, sound the alarm…!”\n-Beep beep beep! Beep beep beep!\n“Wh-what?!”\n“…It has begun.”\nHa-Yul saw the trash panicking.\nThey’re confused because the alarm went off even though they didn’t trigger it.\n…Since it’s their final journey to the afterlife, he decided to let them know as a gift.\n“Do you think I’m the only intruder?”\n“N-no way…!”\n“This place will become a graveyard for villains today.”\nHe gently closed his eyes and smirked.\nTo think he would end up doing something like this. It’s funny how he did the same thing as the person he chased.\n‘If Claire and that guy who went ahead of us saw me, they would surely be shocked and try to stop me.’\nBut he couldn’t stop anymore.\nWhen he saw the villain who killed that guy harming someone again.\nAt that moment, it felt like something inside him broke.\nWas it guilt or a sense of duty?\nMaybe it wasn’t broken but reignited.\nMaybe his desire for revenge, which he had given up on back then, is finally burning.\nWell, it’s too late to think about that now.\nThe Association also wants this. Then, as someone who receives a salary from them, he has no reason not to comply.\nTrash belongs in the trash can.\nIt’s basic common sense.\n…It felt like something was cutting through his body.\n“Wh-why?! The attack isn’t working…!”\n“I’ve experienced such sneak attacks many times. An investigator who would fall for something like this would’ve died long ago.”\n“I-investigator?! Why is someone like that here?!”\nAs the smoke from the cigarette in his mouth scattered, his body also began to disperse.\nThe sensation of his feet standing on the ground disappeared, and the sensation of his hands vanished. It felt like his entire body had become cotton soaked in water.\n‘… I’ll never get used to this no matter how often I use it.’\n“Sorry, but it’s going to hurt a bit. You’ve all killed at least one person, so I believe you won’t have any complaints.”\nIt’s an ability that makes him nearly invincible for a short time, but the longer he uses it, the harder it becomes to maintain his sanity.\nBut this time–just this time–he decided to use it to the limit.\nAfter seeing that sight, he felt he wouldn’t be able to bear it if he didn’t take out his frustration.\nWhat would happen if he used it so long that he couldn’t maintain his sanity?\n‘…Would I disappear like a mirage?’\nBefore he knew it, everything below his neck had dispersed into mist.\nHa-Yul made one last declaration to them.\n“…I hope you thoroughly enjoy drowning on land.”\nSeeing them trying to sweep away the mist and swing their weapons was amusing.\nHe had never tried to kill someone so maliciously before.\nThe ability he only used for instant evasion against monsters turned out to be this effective against humans.\nIs this why people become villains?\nSuddenly, he remembered chatting with Claire and that guy back in school.\n‘Hey, why is your ability so villain-like?’\nThe words of that guy, who was already buried in the ground, seemed to echo in his ears again.\nLooking at the mist that dispersed, he thought.\nIndeed.\n…It really is like a villain.\nBack then, Ha-Yul got annoyed and told him to stop talking nonsense.\nNow, a heavy mist fell across the battlefield.\n_____________________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nAfter writing the announcement, I went to bed.\nWhen I woke up and checked my clock, 13 hours had passed.\nNow I’m feeling fine, hehe.",

      "content": "“Wow, what a spectacle…”\n[Ah, I really regret not being able to include this in the novel. It’s so cool.]\n“…Is it cool? That?”\nAs soon as we invaded the Übermensch’s base, the fight began.\nLooking down from the sky, the one that definitely stood out was investigator Lee Ha-Yul.\nNo, what the hell is that?\n[The ability to turn your whole body into mist. Isn’t it so cool! I knew I made the right choice to keep him alive!]\n“No, it’s cool, but…”\nWell, sure. It is cool.\nThe ability to turn into mist is quite romantic.\nBut that’s a bit, um… Too…\n“…I think that belongs more in the realm of horror than coolness.”\nI had seen a movie like that before.\nA horror movie where unidentified creatures emerge from the mist and attack people.\nWhen I watched that movie, I was scared of the monsters that could appear at any moment.*\n… Wouldn’t it have been better to have those monsters?\n“Grrr…”\nThud.\nAnother villain fell.\nPeople who were moving their bodies violently fell like puppets with cut strings.\nThere’s no blood. Because they didn’t die from getting injured.\n“I wonder what it feels like to have your lungs filled with water…”\n[Who knows?]\nAs the people around them suffered from respiratory distress and twisted their bodies, the villains, who thought it was dangerous, tried to run away, but to no avail.\nThe mist had already settled around them.\nEven if they tried to escape, their lungs gradually filled with water, making them unable to breathe, suffocating them until they drowned.\n…No matter how superhuman you are, training your organs is not easy.\nHow ironic that people who bullied ordinary humans without abilities using their superhuman status are now collapsing like ordinary humans without even being able to fight properly.\n“Spira is fighting well as expected, and Lyla is fighting better than I thought. There was nothing to worry about.”\nSpira, who roams the hideout like her own home, goes without saying, and Lyla also fights better than expected.\nI was a bit worried about both of them.\nI thought Spira might be hesitant since it’s the place she was part of, but she was moving swiftly.\nSuddenly, I remembered how she clung to me to survive back then… Well, whatever. She can’t betray me, so what’s the big deal?\nAs for Lyla, um…\nI thought she wouldn’t be able to fight well since she was set up with an inferiority complex, but her style had completely changed.\nA style that dominates the opponent with overwhelming strength and speed.\nI’m pretty sure she had some technique before, but it seems she’s completely abandoned it.\n“Since everyone seems to be fighting well, let’s meet the executives in advance!”\nI jumped off my thread and slightly regretted it.\nBecause I landed straight on sticky blood.\n“Ugh. I shouldn’t have come down. I was just trying to feel useful…”\nThese stockings I just changed into are already getting dirty.\nGrumbling, I entered the building the villains had come out of.\nLeaving behind the fallen puppets.\n***\n“…What should we do?”\n“I know, right? Aren’t we screwed?”\n“Wow, amazing. They’re getting slaughtered.”\nThe executives each expressed their thoughts.\n…Without any sense of crisis, as if it had nothing to do with them.\n“Do you guys even have the will to fight?”\n“Of course we do.”\n“Yeah, yeah. Of course we intend to fight.”\n“But think about it. Even if we go, won’t those guys get caught up and die anyway?”\n“…”\n“Right? You can’t refute that? It’s more advantageous to conserve our strength as they waste theirs to get to us.\nKwang!\nUnable to contain his anger, he slammed the table.\nWhat the hell are these guys thinking?\nWe definitely talked about this at the last meeting!\n“You guys should know that the more our numbers decrease here, the more dangerous it becomes!”\n“…We know. That’s why we’re decreasing it, Minos.”\n“What?”\nWhere did their carefree attitude from just now go?\nAt some point, they were watching the CCTV with cold eyes.\n“You know, even if we overlook that Marmo’s location was easy to discover, how did they find out about this place?”\n“You thought it was strange too, right? So do I. This is a place where people don’t even roam around. How did they find out?”\n“Wh-what are you saying?”\n“Also, look over there, that CCTV. Do you see it?”\n“… That’s!”\n“Ah, you saw it? That’s a relief. I thought dull Minos wouldn’t be able to see it. Fortunately, you found it quickly.”\nThis is strange.\nNo, it’s beyond strange, it’s impossible.\nWasn’t she dead?\n“…Why is Spira…?”\n“Who knows? Oh, she’s fast. Her speed underground is top-notch.”\nA woman whose lower body is a snake’s tail.\nHer appearance was reminiscent of a lamia that would only appear in myths.\nThere’s no mistake. There couldn’t be another woman besides Spira.\n“Wa-wasn’t she dead?”\n“More precisely, she was missing.”\n“But everyone thought she was dead!”\nMinos was confused.\nA comrade he thought was dead had returned alive.\nIn that case, he should naturally be happy.\n…But that comrade was killing other comrades.\n“Wh-why…”\n“It’s betrayal, Minos. What else could it be?”\nThey easily uttered that word he had thought of but forcibly erased from his mind.\nHe couldn’t believe it.\nEspecially recalling her hearty laughter.\n“How, how…!”\n“Who knows? Whether she turned traitor or deceived us from the beginning… What’s certain is that she is an enemy now.”\nEven as he trembled with the betrayal, they coldly continued their conversation.\n“You know, Minos. We also can’t believe it, but there was a traitor, even among the executives.”\n“…”\n“If there’s one more traitor among the executives, we should consider Übermensch finished. If we catch the traitor, we won’t be able to trust each other, and if we don’t catch them, there will be interference at every turn, and we will fall apart.”\n“Excluding the worst-case scenario, we can only make one judgment… There’s at least a traitor hidden among the regular members.”\n“…I see.”\nHe couldn’t refute the words of Rabi, the rabbit beastman, and Havi, the monkey beastman.\nAs they said, a traitor must be hiding among the regular members. They had no choice but to make that judgment.\n“Of course, it’s quite a painful loss. Even if only we survive here, it’s still dangerous. It’s hard to guarantee whether the plan will succeed or not.”\n“But think about it, Minos. What if we let even one person live, and a traitor the enemy deliberately spared slips in? The plan won’t even begin.”\n“Yeah, I understand.”\n“That’s a relief. It’s heartbreaking for us, too, but it’s all for the plan. They’ll understand.”\nMinos looked at the CCTV again.\nThe screams gradually subsided, and before he knew it, few people were left standing.\n…Everything is for the plan.\n“…By the way, what on earth didn’t they like about us to hate us so much? Because we’re villains?”\n“No way. If that were the case, they would have attacked us long ago. Why attack now?”\n“That’s true. Then why?”\n“Could it be that they didn’t like our goal? The plan to turn humanity into superhumans.”\n“…Hmm, that seems most likely.”\nThe teacup Minos had picked up to calm down crumpled in an instant.\nThat’s right, the plan is to turn humanity into superhumans. That is our organization’s goal.\nThere are countless invisible discriminations and irrationalities between superhumans and ordinary humans.\nThe frontlines that can’t move forward because there are too few superhumans compared to the total human population.\nÜbermensch was created to solve such problems.\nThey have shown some results, and ordinary humans could also be turned into superhumans if their animal factors were suitable.\nThey thought they could achieve their goal with a bit more time.\nBut it fell apart in an instant.\nThe goal that had come close suddenly ran far away, and it became uncertain if we could reach it.\n“…Unforgivable.”\n“Huh?”\n“Ah, you’re angry.”\n“Uooooooo…!”\nUnable to contain his anger, Minos broke through the wall.\n“My name is Minos! Where are the intruders! Come at me!”\n“…Sigh. I told you he’s stupid. Right, Havi?”\n“I didn’t think it was this bad…”\nThe two of them turned to the other executive.\n“Hey you, wake up. You lazy bastard, how can you be asleep with all the noise outside?”\n“Huh… why, why? Is there a problem?”\n“Problems are overflowing. Intruders. Hurry up and prepare to fight.”\n“What?!”\n“Consider all the guys who went to stop them dead.”\n“What?!?!”\n***\n“What’s this sound?”\nBoom, boom.\nSuddenly, a strange roar began to be heard from somewhere.\nAs if I had come to a construction site.\n…What? What’s that sound?\nIt’s not coming from just one place.\nThe source of the sound was gradually moving.\nThe sound is getting slightly louder as if it’s approaching…\n“Crazy…!”\nIt’s not just as if it’s approaching. It was charging straight at her!\nFeeling uneasy, Lyla tried to move her legs to dodge, but it was too late.\nThe sound of something collapsing approached at a tremendous speed, and before she knew it, it had come so close that I couldn’t even distinguish where it was coming from.\nKwaaaaang!\n“…Found you, intruder!”\n“Am I too… Ah, hello?

      "content": "“S-stop chasing me!”\n“Die!”\n“…Hmm.”\nWhat should I do? Should I help?\nVarious thoughts swirled in my mind.\nInvestigator Lee Ha-Yul is overwhelming the person who looks like a rabbit, and Iris is fighting evenly with the person presumed to be a chicken.\nThe problem is Lyla. She seems to be in danger.\nIt wasn’t even a fight. She’s just being chased around like a game of tag.\n“The inferior student setting, did I include it for nothing…”\nThe setting I included to use her as a villain ended up being a hindrance.\nThe investigator over there made good use of an almost forgotten setting.\nAs I was thinking about how to deal with him, I suddenly remembered something.\nThe setting that investigator Lee Ha-Yul and teacher Claire were close friends in the past.\nThanks to that setting, I could easily recruit him as an ally.\nI recalled that Claire suffered from PTSD due to some incident and retired from the front lines.\n…If the investigator is a close friend of teacher Claire, he must have experienced that incident with her. With that thought, I asked the Author, and sure enough,\nThe answer was that it was possible, so I convinced the Author to modify the setting slightly.\nThere’s no way the investigator could avoid the PTSD that teacher Claire also suffers from.\nThe investigator is human too.\nThree close friends from school days.\nWhat if they were doing well together on the front lines, and two of them became investigators?\nAnd what if that person was attacked by a villain due to a moment of carelessness and lost his life?\nWhat if teacher Claire was shocked, suffered from PTSD, and retired from the field, and the other chose to chase down the killer in revenge?\nI thought of that, so I had it created.\nThe existence of a friend who was closer than anyone else, who was no longer here.\nAnd the mastermind who made the friend disappear.\n“I was just happily thinking the setting was well made…”\nA sigh escaped.\nLike a snowball that grew from a single setting of Claire, this time, too, a single setting was rolling like a snowball.\nLyla is weak.\nThis is firmly established as a setting. The Author has mentioned before that she can forcibly twist the setting, but will she take the risk for Lyla’s sake?\nProbably not. She was reluctant when I tried to save her.\nFrom the Author’s perspective, Lyla is just someone who doesn’t matter whether she lives or dies.\nI felt upset.\n“…Author-nim. Did you say you can forcibly twist the setting?”\n[Well… It’s possible, but if I twist it too much, it becomes neither this nor that, so I can’t overuse it and have to push it a bit.]\n“What do you mean by neither this nor that?”\n[Well, if it’s a setting that fits the context like the investigator, it’s not a burden…]\nThe Author’s explanation was not very difficult.\nIt’s a simple story.\nA setting inconsistency.\n…For example, what if there was a description of Amelia eating a meal, and then in the very next scene, she’s having a lunch date with Siwoo?\nIt would feel awkward. To me, to the Author, and to the readers who are reading the novel.\n[I don’t really know what will happen if the context is severely broken. I’ve rarely tried it because it’s dangerous.]\n“I see…”\nI was convinced.\nThe Author probably has no intention of taking a risk to help Lyla.\nIt was strange that I felt down about such an obvious fact.\n“It can’t be helped. The employee’s risk is…huh?”\n[Oh, that. She hasn’t taken it yet.]\nLyla, who had been running away, hastily swallowed something from her bosom when she had a brief moment of respite.\nI think that’s what I gave her last time.\nThe medicinal pill I gave her as a reward, saying she would become stronger if she ate it.\nShe still hadn’t eaten it?\n“I thought she ate it and was still weak.”\nI was about to move to help Lyla, but I decided to watch a little longer.\n… That’s right. No matter how weak she was, she was about to get a little stronger now.\nNo matter how slow she is to learn, she’s bound to improve a little if she consistently practices.\nHer fighting style changed, and her movements were better than when I first saw her, so I absentmindedly thought she had eaten it.\n“…Interesting. Don’t you think so, Mr. Monkey?”\n“Ugh, ugh…!”\n“Don’t worry. It’s too early for you to die yet.”\nIt would be easy to kill everyone, but you never know.\nIt should be fine to have a few hostages.\nI adjusted my posture and decided to watch what Lyla was trying to do.\nI wonder what will happen.\n“…But Author-nim, what does that strengthen?”\n[Hmm, who knows!]\n“…Sigh. You don’t intend to tell me again.”\n[Because you’ll see it soon anyway! Spoilers are forbidden!]\n***\n“You…!”\n“Huff, cough…”\nThe sound of her heartbeat was loud.\n‘Is it a side effect of taking the medicinal pill?… Damn it. I should have eaten it when she gave it to me.’\nShe thought she was going to die from the pain the first time, so why would the second be any different?*\nFeeling her body burning up, she gently closed her eyes.\nIt was so quiet that only her breathing could be heard, let alone any attacks… What’s going on?\nShe forced herself to raise her head and look at the guy chasing her and slightly regretted it.\n‘What’s with those half-crazed eyes? It’s creepy.’\n“…What is that medicinal pill? Where did you get it from?!”\n“What…are you talking about?”\n“Your body…! Until a moment ago, you only had ears and a tail!”\n“…What?”\n“What are those fangs? Where the hell did you get that medicine from!”\n…Fangs?\nWithout thinking, she touched her teeth at his words. She felt something long and sharp.\nWhat is this?\n“The medicinal pills of Übermensch don’t increase compatibility no matter how many you take them!… Where did you get that medicine from!”\n“Ha, haha. …Well. I’m sorry, but I don’t really know either.”\n“If you won’t tell me, I’ll make you talk by force. If we have that medicinal pill, we won’t need to follow the plan!”\nForget running away. It seemed he had no intention of letting Lyla go because the medicinal pill she took was an important item.\nDamn it, nothing’s working out.\n“…I really didn’t want to use this.”\n“Don’t worry. I won’t kill you!”\nIt was an ability she thought she would never use, but now that she was cornered like this, she had no other choice.\nThere were no allies around and no objects that she shouldn’t break.\nThe only thing that existed was the enemy threatening her.\nThen, it was time for her ability to shine… She had rarely used it because she couldn’t control it, but somehow it would work out.\nWhenever she used her ability,\nNothing remained.\n“You said it was a medicinal pill that makes me stronger?”\n“Uoooooooo!”\n“I hope that monster-like guy is gone when I open my eyes.”\nCrack, crackle.\nAlong with the sound of something cracking, her vision went dark.\n***\nKwang!\nA sound that doesn’t seem like flesh colliding with flesh.\nMinos felt puzzled by the impact felt along with such a sound.\n“…What?”\nIt was a dull impact.\nA sensation as if he had collided with something solid.\nThis was a feeling he had only felt from superhumans with strong defensive abilities.\nHe didn’t think the woman who ran away at the sight of him would have that level of defense.\n“What is this…”\nHe turned around. And immediately regretted it.\nIt was more shocking than he had imagined.\n“A monster? No, that can’t be. She should have been human.”\n“Grrr…”\n“It seems she’s not in her right mind.”\n“Raaaar!”\nShe’s human. But she’s not human.\nShe clearly walked on two legs like a human and had two arms.\nBut those crazed eyes.\nThe purple fur covering her entire body made it difficult to see her as human.\n“…It seems she’s gone crazy. What the hell is this?”\n“Awoooooo!”\nShe looked exactly like the creatures from the textbooks of his childhood.\nA being that is human yet wolf.\nThe fearsome existence rumored to go berserk with bloodlust on the night of the full moon.\nDespite efforts to coexist with them, everyone feared their ferocity that went on a rampage whenever the full moon rose.\n“Werewolf…”\nHe looked up at the sky.\nThe brightly shining round shape of the moon evoked an eerie feeling.\nIf the old tales were true, he had to run away right now. It was an extremely dangerous situation.\n…But Minos did not run away. Because he had something he had to do.\n“I don’t know why you suddenly transformed like that and went crazy…! But I must find out! The true nature of that medicinal pill you took!”\n“Raaaar!”\n“Übermensch cannot overcome any more dangerous hurdles…!”\nSharp teeth and claws.\nEyes engulfed in madness.\nHe did not run away even when confronted with a monster barehanded and without any support.\nBecause there was something he had to find out.\nDespite knowing the danger, Minos decided to fight head-on.\n“Come at me!”\nThe time for the hunt had begun.\nRuminas, are you excited too?\nWouldn’t it be bad if we get attention by playing around like immature kids?\nI think the results might not come out next week, either.\nWhat if I eat it? It will be delayed even more, huh…",

      "content": "Just Because I Have Narrow Eyes Doesn’t Make Me a Villain! - Chapter 60\n“…My head hurts.”\nAs soon as Lyla regained consciousness, she grabbed her head due to the pain she felt.\nThe terrible pain stirred her head, making it impossible even to open my eyes or move for a while.\nThis is why she hates using her ability.\nAs soon as she uses it, she loses consciousness and can’t even remember what she did.\nOn top of that, when the duration ends, it’s hard to move for a while.\nIt seemed like she would never get used to it, no matter how much she used it. Maybe she would never get used to it in her lifetime.\nAfter holding her head for a long time, the headache subsided only after some time.\n…It seems to hurt more than usual.\n“Are you coming to your senses? Does it hurt?”\n“Ah, Arte? No, it still hurts…”\n“Hmm, no wonder. I was surprised. I didn’t know you would become that strong. You’ll be surprised if you see it yourself?”\n“What? What do you mean…”\nLyla was about to respond politely to Arte’s voice and lie back down on the ground, but at her astonished voice, she unwittingly opened my eyes.\nAnd upon seeing the sight in her eyes, she realized why Arte had said such a thing.\n“What is this? Where is this?”\n“What do you mean where? It’s the same place where you used your ability?”\n“…These ruins?”\n“Yes!”\nThe buildings that were a bit dirty but intact had been reduced to the brink of collapse.\n“… You’re saying I did this? That can’t be?”\nThat’s right, it can’t be.\nMy ability is not as versatile as Arte’s nor as strong as the Investigator’s.\nIt’s not an excellent ability that can always be used, like Siwoo’s ability, which she learned from Arte.\n… It’s just an ability where she goes crazy and rampage for a bit, then collapse from exhaustion.\nFrom what she’s heard, she rampages without even feeling pain when attacked, but in the end, her body could never create that level of destructive power.\n‘But Arte is saying I did this?’\n“It might’ve been difficult originally, but you took something, remember?”\n“Something I ate?”\n“The medicinal pill. Oh my, you were so scary~”\nLyla unconsciously touched her lips.\nCome to think of it, she did eat something like that.\nThe fangs she had felt before losing consciousness had disappeared at some point.\n“You must be happy that your ability has become stronger!”\n“…Yeah, well. I’m glad.”\n“It was a medicinal pill that passed down the power of your ancestors, something called ancestral regression. Were you surprised? To think Lyla’s ancestor was a werewolf.”\n“I see. My ancestor was a werewolf… Wait, what?”\nAgain.\nShe doesn’t remember how many bombshells she’s heard today, but here was another.\n‘What? My ancestor was…what?’\n“As soon as you used your ability, you became a werewolf and went on a rampage? It was amazing.”\n“Re-really…?”\n“Yes. Look over there. Can you see it? The claw marks on that wall. You did that?”\nJust as Arte said, there were long claw marks where she pointed her finger.\nThreatening marks that looked like they were engraved by a ferocious beast.\n‘…Did I really do that?’\n“It seems like your ability has been altered. It’s not just a berserk rampage, but more like going crazy while borrowing the power of your ancestors. Maybe the full moon today also made it stronger!”\nLyla could hear Arte chattering away, but it didn’t really register in her ears.\n‘…S, so you’re saying I transformed into a werewolf?’\nAnd that’s the effect of the medicinal pill Arte gave her? That medicinal pill uses the power of her ancestors…\nIt was shocking.\nIt was even more shocking than if she had heard that her mom was originally her dad.\nWhy wouldn’t she? It’s a werewolf! A dangerous monster that only appears in textbooks!\nOne that has intelligence similar to humans and can blend into society but goes crazy and rampages every full moon!\n‘…And that’s my ancestor?’\n“Th-then…”\n“It seems your ancestors had unique tastes, Lyla!”\n“…”\nShe poured out words of contempt towards her unknown ancestor in her mind.\nIt seems her ancestors were truly insane.\n‘Don’t tell me they did that… with a werewolf, who has almost nothing in common with humans except bipedal walking?’\n“My ancestor…”\n“Pedigree!*”\n“Can you please shut up?”\nShe felt even sadder when she saw the massive corpse lying in the distance.\nAs if Arte’s words were true, there were wounds that looked like a wolf had bitten and torn at it.\n‘I never thought it would be a medicinal pill like this…’\nEven though he was the person who attacked her, she felt sorry for him instead.\nHe probably didn’t want a medicinal pill like this either…\n“Ah, since you worked hard, should I make steak for dinner tonight?”\nShe almost got annoyed thinking Arte was making fun of her, but she realized it after seeing her expression.\nThis girl has no qualms, even though she knows she was being chased by a bull until now.\n“…Beef is a bit too much, so make it pork.”\n“Got it. Hmm, what should I make?”\nArte, who was humming and moving her feet, looked like a girl her age.\nExcept for the thick smell of blood and the blood-soaked clothes that looked new.\nThe gap between her ordinary appearance and the extraordinary situation created a sense of discomfort.\nTo the point where she felt like Arte was an outsider who didn’t belong in this world.\n***\n“Hey, did you hear?”\n“I heard, I heard. Is there anyone who doesn’t know about that these days?”\n“Right?”\nThe students’ chatter echoed throughout the classroom.\nNot just the group of boys over there.\nThe girls gathered together, some students chatting in the hallway, and even the teachers.\nEveryone was talking about the story on the news.\n“…Sigh.”\n“Arachne struck again. This time, it’s estimated to be around 800 people?”\n“That’s a lot. Why are there so many villains in this small city?”\n“Who knows.”\nSiwoo let out a sigh.\nHe wasn’t in the mood to properly attend class at all. The school atmosphere was the same.\n…Maybe that’s why the teacher sighed and declared self-study. It probably means just to chat freely so they wouldn’t be so noisy during the next period.\n“I heard this incident involved several people attacking a villain organization simultaneously. The estimated number of people is four.”\n“…Four people.”\n“Yeah. They’ve narrowed down the killing methods to about four people.”\nThe information Amelia casually drops as if it’s no big deal is extremely valuable.\nBecause the news only reported that Arachne had massacred villains again was the only news known to the public.\n“You know, Siwoo.”\n“Hm?”\n“… Let’s give up.”\n“…”\nHe could guess what Amelia was talking about.\nThe ultimate goal they want to achieve.\n‘She’s talking about stopping Arte, right?’\n“No matter how much I think about it, it’s impossible to apprehend Arte directly.”\n“B-but…”\n“But what? It’s already 1,600 people. In the thousands… I really never thought there would be this many villains.”\n“…”\nAmelia didn’t speak to him directly.\nBut what she wanted was clear.\n…She probably wants to give up on the idea of subduing Arte and focus on seducing Arte instead.\n“Do we really have to do that?”\n“Then what? Can’t you see we’re gradually drifting apart? It was impossible from the start.”\n“Sigh…”\nThere wasn’t a single thing wrong with what Amelia said.\nBecause she thought stopping Arte would just require stopping her alone, but that wasn’t the case.\nIt turns out Arte is also a member of an organization and they are a group capable of slaughtering thousands.\nFrom the beginning, the difficulty level wasn’t something they could match.\n“There’s no other way.”\n“…Phew.”\nIn comparison, the difficulty of seducing Arte was the same.\nAmelia, who values efficiency, probably can’t understand at all.\nWhy would Siwoo be against it?\n‘…Bu, but. Think about it.’\n“Isn’t it arrogant to think that we can seduce Arte in the first place?”\n“What nonsense are you spouting again? Your face is decent enough, so just do as I say.”\n“Okay…”\nIt’s not getting through to her.\nIn the end, with Amelia’s enthusiastic support, the Anti-Arte Alliance (which has two members) decided to change its policy towards Arte.\nFrom the Arte Prevention to the Arte Seduction.\n“…So what are you going to do?”\n“Hmm, the standard approach would be repeatedly going on dates…”\nAmelia began to ponder, saying that the standard approach probably wouldn’t work with Arte.\nIndeed, Siwoo thought so too.\nIn the first place, even the reason she is interested in him is questionable.\n‘…Well. I’ve never dated before, but I don’t think it would elicit a good response.’\nHe has no dating experience, so he cannot know if Arte feels uncomfortable.\n“For now, let’s go with the ‘slowly but surely’ approach.”\n“Slowly but surely?”\n“It’s a strategy where a classmate becomes a friend, a friend becomes an oppa, an oppa becomes a darling, and a darling becomes a daddy.**”\n“???”\nWhat on earth is Amelia talking about…\nThey definitely spoke the same language, but he spent a long time thinking about what she meant.\n“Tomorrow is the last day of school before summer break, right?”\n“Yeah, that’s right.”\n“When you think of summer vacation, what comes to mind?”\n“…Who knows?”\n“The beach, the beach!”\nAmelia gestured to him excitedly.\n…Actually, Siwo wondered if she didn’t care at all.\nHe was always worrying about what to do, but Amelia seemed to always be enjoying herself.\nJust as he was having such doubts, Amelia continued.\n“Normally, it’ll be hard to meet Arte during the vacation! But we’re in the same club! It’s not like we have no way to meet!”\n“So why the beach?”\n“Let’s go on a trip to the beach.”\n“A trip?”\n“Yeah. It’s just us hanging out together for bonding purposes. What do you think?”\nSiwoo was surprised.\nBecause it’s a relatively normal idea coming from Amelia.\nGoing on a trip to the beach isn’t that strange of an idea.\n‘I guess she also has normal thoughts…’\n“And then you pounce on Arte in her swimsuit… Then she won’t have any clothes, so she won’t be able to resist…!”\nCancel that.\nShe wasn’t in her right mind.\nWhat a fool he was for even believing for a second.\n“No, maybe the method of locking you in the changing room…?”\n“…Amelia. Do you really intend to seduce Arte, or are you trying to kill me?”\nHe sighed as he watched Amelia spouting nonsense.\nTomorrow is already the last day of school before summer break.\nSiwoo also felt excited about the approaching vacation before he knew it.\n_______________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nIt seems that lying is also an art.\nEven if you know it’s a lie, if it’s believable, you end up being deceived…",

It’s already been half a year.”\nAt Amelia’s words, Siwo finally realized how fast time had flown by.\nIt’s already been half a year.\nHe was so focused on the fact that it was summer break that he didn’t realize that much time had passed.\n“I definitely thought you would make a bunch of friends and spend it ordinarily.”\n“You dream big, Siwoo.”\n“…No, is it really dreaming big just to live an ordinary life?”\n“Looking at your situation, isn’t that accurate to say?”\n…Yeah, it’s true. No one would expect their school life to become this entangled right from the start.\nHe never imagined becoming this close with a student whose identity is impossible to grasp and another student whose thoughts are indecipherable.\nHalf the reason his life isn’t ordinary is because of Arte, and the other half is because of Amelia.\n‘I wonder if she knows that?’\nShe definitely doesn’t. Even now, she has a clueless expression.\nSighing, he spoke to Amelia.\n“In the end, we couldn’t find the secret room.”\n“From the beginning, it was a mistake to think we could find it in half a year, as you said.”\n“So the plan was impossible from the beginning?”\n“Ugh…”\nFor half a year, they searched all over the academy.\nUsing club activities as an excuse, they turned every location upside down, so to speak.\n…But it wasn’t there. No matter how hard they looked, something like a secret room simply didn’t exist.\n“Maybe something like a secret room really doesn’t exist after all? Senior seemed eager to help us, but she also lost motivation.”\n“… It’s not just her you can say that about, Siwoo. You and I also gave up a long time ago.”\n“Yeah, well. That’s true.”\nTo be honest, at first, everyone enthusiastically ran around.\nThey thought it would be fine if they could somehow find the secret room while enrolled in the academy and secure that dangerous artifact first.\nThat’s why they joined the Exploration Club and told the president about it, embellishing it in various ways.\nThe excited president tagged along to find the secret room no matter what and earnestly searched for several months.\n…Yes, they ‘searched.’ Now, not a single person in the club was bothering with it.\n“Whew, you need to make at least some progress to do anything. I experienced firsthand the saying that motivation plummets when stuck on the same part.”\n“…It was my first time feeling that way too.”\nOver the past half-year, they have realized why people dislike repeating the same thing.\nWhy people dislike training.\n“I didn’t know the lack of progress could be this difficult.”\n“Yeah. I honestly didn’t get it when Granny said many people dislike training. But now I think I understand.”\nThey have seen countless times how their classmates dislike attending classes and honing their skills.\nAnd whenever they saw that, they wondered why they disliked it. After all, the sense of achievement from being able to do what was impossible with just a few days of practice was enjoyable.\n…And through their emotions, they found the answer to that question.\n“That feeling when the thought suddenly hits you that you’re just spending time without any results… Ugh.”\nAmelia rubbed her arms as if she got chills.\nYes, that’s why they gave up. Accepting the fact that they were arrogant.\n…A secret room that the academy’s founder painstakingly hid so that no one could find it for hundreds of years–how could mere students do it in less than half a year?\nNot to mention without any clues.\nSo they gave up on finding it first and waited for Arte to find the artifact.\nThey changed their approach to somehow seizing it right before she got her hands on the artifact.\nShe surpassed the level of strength of a student, had clues about the secret room, and even had comrades, though Siwoo didn’t know the exact number.\nSo they decided to get stronger and ambush her to subdue her right before she grabbed the artifact.\nThat plan was also discarded yesterday, though.\n“…Ah, it’s Dorothy. Over here! Over here!”\nAmelia raised her hand high and waved it while shouting.\nOnly then did Dorothy come running over in a hurry, her brown hair fluttering from afar.\n“Huff, huff… Ah, hello.”\n“You could have come slowly. It would have been fine.”\n“Sti, still. We said we’d hang out together to celebrate summer break, so wouldn’t it be a bit much if I arrived late?”\nDorothy’s brightly smiling face was dazzling.\nHow commonsensical her words were.\nIf it were Amelia, she would surely say, “Is that so? Then it should be fine if I’m a little late next time?” and start arriving a bit late each time.\n“… What’s with that unpleasant gaze?”\n“No, it’s nothing.”\nDid he unintentionally stare at her?\nHe made an excuse to Amelia, who looked puzzled. He said it was nothing and glossed over it.\nIt would be a bit troublesome if she kept asking about it.\n“It looks like it’s about to start, so let’s find our seats.”\n“Okay… But where’s Arte?”\n“…Huh? I saw her over there a little while ago. Where did she go…?”\nDespite their efforts to somehow find Arte, they couldn’t see her.\nWhere on earth did she disappear to…?\nAmelia poured out her complaints towards Arte.\n“When we said let’s go hang out somewhere after the ceremony… Where did she vanish to?”\n“Who knows? Calling her after it’s over should be fine, so let’s sit for now.”\n“Sigh… I’ll endure it, I’ll endure…”\n…To be honest, Amelia and Siwoo’s wariness towards Arte has greatly diminished.\nThey were almost certain she was a member of Übermensch.\nThey thought that was the correct answer, but wariness towards her has gradually faded since they couldn’t prove it.\nIt’s odd for someone aiming to be a hero to have these thoughts…\nBut if Siwoo had to be honest, he didn’t know much about the dead people.\nHe only heard the news that they died, but they were people completely unrelated to him.\nAnd the victims weren’t upstanding citizens either.\nThey were villains who relentlessly tormented those citizens.\nThere was even news that among the dead villains, there was a villain who murdered 30 civilians and was released from prison, right?\nThey may not have committed crimes. The dead villain may have been falsely accused.\n…But is it because he’s biased that he can’t help but think they deserved to die due to the blatant circumstantial evidence?\nIs it because he is a cruel person that he doesn’t feel much aversion to the thought that Arte may have killed people?\nSiwoo was unsure.\n“Ah, ah. The summer break ceremony will start soon, so students, please take your seats…”\n“Haa. Where on earth did she disappear to?”\nWhere did Amelia’s hostility go? To think she’s feeling friendliness towards Arte.\nExcluding him, Arte, and Dorothy, whom she recently started talking to, Amelia converses with only a handful of people.\nPerhaps she also thinks she must stop Arte, but she might consider her a friend.\nShe’s been starting to treat her without reserve, so it’s probably certain.\n“Hey, it’s really starting. Sit, sit.”\n‘But I can’t say much with how empty it feels without Arte…’\nShe’s indeed dangerous. He didn’t know her background, and she might be watching him while plotting something dangerous.\n…But he still hoped that she wouldn’t disappear.\nEven if it had been only half a year, he had come to consider Arte a precious friend.\nWhether Amelia’s plan succeeds or fails.\nHe sincerely wished that she would have a good experience over the break.\n***\n“And lastly, the various things you students have learned over the past half year at the academy…”\n“It keeps going…”\nThe principal’s speech, which showed no signs of ending, lasted over ten minutes.\nThinking it would end, but it doesn’t, and thinking now it will really finish, but it continues again.\nSiwoo was despairing that even when he thought an hour had passed and looked at the clock, only about ten minutes had gone by, and once again, their voice pierced his ears.\nIn that seemingly eternal, boring time, Dorothy was voicing her complaints.\n“Amelia, do you… She fainted.”\nHer half-collapsed, absentminded appearance was completely different from usual.\nTo think someone so lively would end up like this.\nJust as he started to feel his body stiffening, he suddenly recalled.\n…This spot, this seat.\nIt felt familiar. Like he had seen this seat many times before.\nWhere was it? The only memorable thing about this auditorium is the monster attack…\n“S-Siwoo?”\n“You there, student! What’s going on? Quickly return to your seat!”\nIgnoring the teachers far away reproaching me as they approached, he looked at Arte’s seat on the day of the entrance ceremony.\nArte isn’t here. But he felt a sense of déjà vu.\nNo matter how much he thought about it, he couldn’t shake off the uneasiness. To the point of having the illusion that his head was splitting.\nWhere did Arte disappear to?\nHe hurriedly opened the closed window to check outside the auditorium.\n“…This is crazy.”\n“Student! Take your se- what the, what is that?”\nLike a passing storm, a wave of darkness approached.\n_________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nWhile reading the comments yesterday, I suddenly realized something.\nIf things continue like this, the number of incidents until the summer break will increase dramatically! With that in mind, I skipped the time period and even the description I had to include.\nI added an explanation.\nI’m feeling sleepy today.\nGood night, everyone.",

      "content": "Just Because I Have Narrow Eyes Doesn’t Make Me a Villain! - Chapter 62\n“It’s finally starting.”\nAni looked at the villains gathered to attack the academy.\n…There are too few. Absurdly so.\nAccording to the original plan, there should be three times this number of people.\n“Mir, are you really going to do this? Shouldn’t we gather more people?”\n“You know there’s no choice. It’s dangerous to drag this out any longer. We don’t know when those guys will come.”\n“…”\nThe plan was extremely risky from the start.\nThey can somehow force their way into the academy.\nIf thousands of ability users swarm and ransack at once, it would be enough to easily subdue it.\nNo matter how strong they were when active, after retiring and becoming academy teachers, they were ultimately has-beens.\nAccording to the original plan, with that number of people, they could easily subdue the academy before the heroes stopped them.\nThe academy was just an obstacle. What they really considered a threat were the Association’s heroes.\n…But what about now?\nExecutives and their subordinates were instantly cut down.\nBecause of an organization that suddenly appeared.\nHe had no choice but to feel uneasy about the academy attack, which he thought they could easily handle.\nMir’s plan, which he considered perfect, was disrupted by strange people.\nIt was extremely unpleasant.\n“Only four executives left.”\n“Now you’re treating me like an executive?”\n“…You said to treat you as an equal.”\n“Well, sure. But isn’t it cooler to be known as the Four Heavenly Kings?”\nThey watched the villains smashing through the academy’s front gate and forcing their way in.\nThe Four Heavenly Kings.\n“But we’re all doing this for the world.”\n“…Yeah. This is all for an equal world.”\nMir looked at the academy with a determined gaze.\nHer goal was there.\nThe academy’s founder. A hero. The world’s savior.\nSomething so dangerous that the hero sealed it away.\nBut to them, it was the sweetest thing above all else.\n“…But you know, if it was dangerous enough to seal away, why didn’t they destroy it? It seems like they could have.”\n“Think about it, Ani. That person must have also realized how much of a revolution the artifact would bring about… It’s dangerous, but they sealed it, thinking it would be used in the right place someday.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yeah, I’m certain.”\nMir spoke with a confident voice.\nYes, if she says so, then it must be true.\nShe was always right.\n“According to that book, it’s definitely there. The artifact we want… The artifact that can mix humans and other races.”\n“The name was Crucible, right?”\n“Yeah. If we have that…”\nAni could guess what she would say next without hearing it.\nMir always said the same thing.\n“Anyone can use mana, right? Got it, got it.”\n“…Have I talked about it too much?”\n“Yeah. A ton.”\nMana is the exclusive property of superhumans.\nThat’s why people who aren’t superhumans are infinitely weak to superhumans and are treated as inferior.\nEven in crimes.\nIf an ordinary person kills several people, that’s the end. They rot in prison for life or die.\nBut what about superhumans? Even if they kill hundreds due to the shortage of superhuman personnel, they can return to an ordinary life if they’re lucky.\n“If we can just get our hands on the Crucible… Then people can protect themselves.”\n“I see.”\nSomeone once said this.\nIf anyone can use mana, if anyone can always have the power to kill people,\nWouldn’t that be hell?\nUnder the pretense of helping others, you can use that power to drive society into hell.\nThat’s true. Suppose the mentally ill, people with short tempers, or immature people suddenly gain powerful abilities. In that case, they’ll certainly act out of line without knowing their place.\n…But the person who said that forgot the most important fact.\n“Ah, they’re coming out. Faster than I thought.”\n“It’s fine. It still hasn’t exceeded expectations.”\n“Shall we go in too?”\n“…Yeah, Ani. We should go too. For equality.”\nThe fact that Übermensch is a villainous organization with thousands of members.\nYes, a villainous organization.\nEven if society rejects it out of concern for side effects, even if the negative impact far outweighs the positive.\nThey don’t care.\nThis many people gathered with their own thoughts. Prepared to go against society.\nThere may have been trashy guys who just joined out of boredom, but they didn’t care.\nThey are villains.\nThey don’t care about the numerous growing pains that will be experienced if we give mana to everyone in the world.\nThey are villains.\nThey are the ones who gathered here, determined to do what everyone advises against.\n“Are you ready to set the world ablaze, Mir?”\n“Set it ablaze? I told you this is a necessary action, Ani. We’re giving society a shot. Vaccines hurt when you get them, right?”\n“…What if someone dies from getting it wrong?”\nMir smiled benevolently at his question.\nIt was her usual kind appearance.\n“Then… Well, should we offer condolences to the weak society?”\n***\n“…Dorothy!”\n“Eek?!”\nSiwoo hurriedly deflected the flying blades heading towards Dorothy and cut the tendons of the attacking villain.\nLeaving them alone for long would be dangerous, but… Now wasn’t the time to worry about that.\nShe had a dumbfounded expression from the attack that came from a blind spot but soon seemed to realize what kind of situation she almost ended up in.\n“Th-Thank you.”\n“No, don’t worry about it. More importantly, that’s…”\nStudents and teachers were fighting, intermingled with villains everywhere.\nThe places with teachers seemed to be easily handled, but then more villains swarmed and persistently fought.\nHe could also see students who had panicked from the sudden situation.\n…This is dangerous.\n“Siwoo!”\n“…How is it?”\n“Never mind that. It’s definitely the Übermensch! How are there so many?! Didn’t a huge number of them die?!”\n“As I thought…”\nHe heard that one executive was with nearly 200 villains last time, so he thought their scale was large, but to think it would be to this extent.\n“The executives, can you see where they are?”\n“Huh, what?!”\n“Remember that rat-like man who called himself an executive? He definitely mentioned the Chinese Zodiac. There should be more than one of them.”\n“…Probably.”\n“Since they’re executives, they’ll definitely be stronger than the other guys. We need to tell the teachers…”\n“There’s no need for that, chicks.”\nAt the sudden interrupting voice, I hurriedly turned my head.\nA man who looked to be over 2 meters tall was approaching us.\n“I heard the name Übermensch and wondered what was happening. You must be talking about Marmo. Are you the students who were at that mountain villa?”\n“…Wh-What about it?”\n“No, it’s nothing much. But you know, he was a guy I was close with.”\nClack.\nAs soon as he heard that sound, Siwoo’s whole body started ringing alarm bells, and a low voice reached my ears.\n“I’ll make sure he won’t be lonely.”\n“Oh no…!”\nIt’s not that he couldn’t react.\nAs soon as his instincts warned him of danger, he raised his sword to defend that spot, but…!\n‘He’s much faster than I thought!’\nThinking he had no choice but to get hit, he tightly shut my eyes and prepared for the impact, but instead of pain, only a familiar voice entered his ears.\nAmelia, who had somehow wedged herself between him and the villain, struggled to block the kick.\n“Guh, ugh… It hurts… Mister, you’re pretty quick…?”\n“…How did you…”\n“I’m also a bit confident in my speed. How about it? Want to bet on who’s faster? If this is your fastest, I’d win.”\n“Hah.”\nAs if he heard a shallow provocation, he brought his blocked leg to the ground and scratched his head.\n“A cheap provocation. Did you think I’d fall for that?”\n“Ah, as I thought…?”\n“That’s right, chick. I can’t stand it. Come at me.”\n“Huh?”\n“What are you doing? You’re not going to fight? Looks like that spirit was all for show.”\n…What the hell is wrong with this crazy bastard?\nAmelia stiffened momentarily as if she hadn’t expected that reaction but soon smiled brightly.\nIt’s the same smile as always. That smile always puts Siwoo in a difficult position.\n“Ha, great. Come at me! I’m faster than you think.”\n“Who knows? We’ll find out when we fight… It’ll be over soon anyway.”\nAfter a short exchange, the two started moving at a tremendous speed, kicking up dirt.\nThe fight couldn’t even be seen with the eyes. They were probably fighting each other, but he couldn’t follow it at all.\n“Let’s go, Dorothy.”\n“What, huh? But Amelia is fighting…!”\n“Right now, quickly finding a teacher is how we can help her!”\nAmelia signaled with her eyes before fighting.\nTo hurry and go.\nAs someone who understood her abilities, he didn’t think Amelia would lose.\nShe’ll keep getting faster.\nIf she judges that it’s becoming too difficult to attack, she’ll run away on her own. That’s the kind of person she is.\nSo, while she was tying him up, they had to bring a teacher as fast as possible.\n***\n“…Hmm.”\n[It’s starting! Amelia and Horse started fighting!]\n“It seems so. There are three left…”\nDragon, Dog, and… was it Tiger?\nI shifted my gaze away from the two people fighting in the distance, kicking up dirt, and watched the two villains far away.\n“They look quite strong… Can the protagonist win?”\n[…Ah. Right.]\n“What is it this time?!”\nA sense of unease came over me.\nWhenever the Author seemed to have forgotten something and started talking, a problem arose.\nMoreover, this time, it’s the highlight scene of the novel, and the target we were watching is a being presumed to be the boss.\nIn terms of games, it would be the mid-boss position.\n…And yet, this reaction while looking at such a person. I already don’t want to hear it.\n[That, well… I didn’t set up how strong they are… They seem stronger than I thought?]\n“What?”\n[With the protagonist’s current level, I don’t think he can win…?]\n“What?!”\nA shocking statement came out of the Author’s mouth.\nWhat?\n… Can’t win? Seriously?\n_________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nRuminas, have a good evening.",

      "content": "Just Because I Have Narrow Eyes Doesn’t Make Me a Villain! - Chapter 63\n“…What should I do?”\n[You have to somehow stop them from meeting Siwoo! If you fail, you’ll have no choice but to use extreme measures!]\nThe Author started urging me.\nIt’s natural for her to do so, as the protagonist is about to face a dangerous situation.\nBut you’re the one who caused this…\nIt was absurd, but there was no helping it. What’s done is done. The priority is to handle the situation somehow.\n“How strong are they?”\n[Uh, well… Based on the output, about upper tier…? It’s already been observed, so modifications are… a bit…]\n“Haa…”\n[…Ugh, urk.]\nWhen I didn’t hold back my sigh, the Author made a dejected sound.\nBut I didn’t pay it any mind.\nUpper tier in the world…\nYou deserve to be scolded.\nGiven the characteristics of academy novels, I can understand experiencing a dense half-year instead of the usual three years before completion. Most novels are like that.\nIt’s inevitable to progress the story in the first place.\nBut if you ask if there’s a protagonist who fights an upper-tier villain in the worldview before the summer break of their first year, I can confidently say there isn’t. Siwoo is not a power fantasy munchkin protagonist but a growth-type one.\nTo encounter an enemy in the upper tiers of the power balance within the worldview when their growth isn’t even complete? It’s quite dangerous.\nWill the protagonist really defeat that villain?\nHe can’t, or else the power balance would be ruined.\nSuppose a supposedly immensely powerful enemy loses to a protagonist who hasn’t fully grown. In that case, the enemies that appear next will inevitably have to be stronger than that villain to put the protagonist in danger.\nThen what if the protagonist can’t defeat the villain and loses?… This is an even bigger problem.\nLosing to a villain = usually dying.\nThis is a fact everyone knows without having to say it.\nTo survive, you must provide a reason for it, but how?\nShould I abruptly say the villain fell for Siwoo?\nHa, I’d be lucky not to be criticized for lacking plausibility.\n“It’s not that there’s no way…”\n[Oh, really?]\n“Yes. The outcome of a fight isn’t always determined by strength.”\nThe most basic example is compatibility.\nYou could use Amelia and Siwoo as an example. No matter how fast Amelia is, she can’t subdue Siwoo, who can deny her attacks with Intuition.\nOther than that, there’s cooperation, weakening, strengthening, etc.\n“What if Dorothy strengthens Siwoo, and that villain is weakened for some reason?”\n[…!]\n“Or we could have another strong person handle the boss and assign one executive to him.”\n[Re-Reader-nim!]\n“If you get so excited over such a simple fix…”\n[Ah, no. That’s not it! It’s, it’s a big problem!]\n“What?”\nAt the Author’s urgent voice calling for me, I looked around.\nOnly then did I realize what the Author was talking about.\nDid quite some time pass while I was pondering how Siwoo could defeat that villain?\nThe situation had changed considerably.\n“Uh, huh…?”\n[Wha, what, what should we do…?! H, he’s really much stronger than I thought! Aah, I, I kept putting off setting it up…! It, it’s over!]\nI realized this when I saw the students who were in formation being pushed back.\nIt’s the doing of that woman with dragon horns. I’m sure of it.\nIt’s dangerous to leave it like this.\nIt’s not that it’s dangerous because students might die. Perhaps because of her fate as a mid-boss, the leader of Übermensch was moving in the direction where Siwoo was.\n“There’s no choice. Even if the development gets a bit ruined, we must stop that…”\n[R-Reader-nim! Be careful! Behind you!]\n“?!”\nKwathump…!\nWhen I hurriedly rolled my body to the side at the Author’s voice, the attack from behind me broke the rooftop floor with an eerie sound.\nWha, what…?!\nI’ve ambushed others before, but it was my first time on the receiving end, so I was utterly flustered. Meanwhile, the one who attacked me while kicking up dirt irrately.\n“What the… Do you have eyes on the back of your head?”\n“… I’m a bit lucky.”\n“Well, you have to be at this level to be Arachne. Right?”\n[?!]\n“…How do you know that?”\nA man with a unique hairstyle that looks like it’s drawing a pattern with white and black hair.\nA tail of the same color.\n…I have a rough idea. The last executive of Übermensch whose location was unknown until now.\nTiger.\nWhy is this bastard here? Wasn’t he searching for the secret room?\nNo, how did he even know I’m Arachne in the first place…!\n“So you are Arachne.”\n“…Was it a wild guess?”\n“No? Amid this chaos, the one leisurely observing the situation on the rooftop, if not Arachne, then what? Even if you aren’t, I can just kill you and be done with it.”\n“…”\nUnable to find any words to refute, I closed my mouth.\nWell, what he said was true. The villains, students, and teachers were fiercely fighting.\nJust the fact that I, in a school uniform, am not fighting the villains is enough to make the situation suspicious.\n“Mir told me beforehand. The meddlesome bunch who keep interfering at every turn will definitely come to obstruct us somehow, so look for a place with no people.”\n“…”\n“Honestly, I was half in doubt, but… she is truly wise. How does it feel, Arachne?”\n“My current feeling? I’d like you to step aside. I need to go quickly.”\nI gently conveyed my wish.\nAnd the response that came back was exactly as I expected, without an inch of deviation.\n“That can’t happen. You’re going to interfere with us again, aren’t you?”\n“…”\nHe didn’t seem to have any intention of stepping aside at all.\nThis is bad. If a fight breaks out…\nI don’t think I’ll lose. The Author is behind me. She must be in a hurry too, so she’ll help me somehow.\nBut if I waste time here, the protagonist…!\n“I know you hate us, but we feel the same way. We’ve been hit this much, so we can’t stand it if we don’t pay you back somehow.”\n“Step aside. Right now.”\nAnxiety enveloped my entire body.\nThere was no time for this. I had to join and help Siwoo. If, if the protagonist dies…!\n“I don’t know what you want to do, but you seem anxious. I guess you’re in a big hurry?”\n“I said, step aside!”\n“This time, it’s our turn to interfere with you, Arachne.”\nTiger grinned cunningly.\n“Even if it kills me, I’ll cling to you.”\nAll for the plan.\n***\n“…This is the founder’s tomb. The founder’s cradle.”\nMir gazed at the immensely vast academy grounds.\nThe wind enveloping her entire body was blowing refreshingly as if expressing her mood.\n“We’re finally going to… confirm the true nature of the Crucible.”\n“But Mir. You said the Crucible is in the Secret Room? How are you going to find it? Didn’t you say no one has been able to find it for hundreds of years?”\n“That’s easy, Annie. No one has discovered it until now because their method of searching was too passive.”\n“Passive?”\nMir started condensing the wind in her hand.\nThe more it condensed, the more the wind went wild inside.\n“Yes. Everyone said they would search for it but just walked around.”\nMir laughed as she threw the wind condensed to its limit into the academy’s main building.\n“I don’t care if the academy breaks or not. I just need to find the secret room. The flow of the wind will guide me to that location.”\n“I see. But what if it’s blocked by something like mana, and we can’t enter?”\nThe suppressed wind was instantly released and ransacked various parts of the academy.\n…Wow, it’s sturdy. The academy.\nShouldn’t it collapse if something like that rampages inside? It’s surprisingly intact.\n“Then that’s even better. It means the secret room is where the wind doesn’t pass through.”\n“Huh.”\n“…And, I don’t think you need to worry. It seems I’ve found it.”\nIs Mir’s long-cherished wish finally being fulfilled?\nAnnie looked at her, muttering to herself with a flushed face.\n“…Finally, I finally found it. How long have I waited for this moment?”\n“Good for you, Mir.”\n“Thank you… Then, shall we go? To the beginning of a new world.”\n“Yeah.”\nAnnie was simply delighted.\nBecause Mir finally achieved what she wanted. She knew how long she had been planning for this.\nThat’s why she naturally felt upset when she saw the ones interfering with Mir’s happiness.\n“Haa, haa…”\n“Si, Siwoo…! W, why did you suddenly change direction… Eek?!”\n“…Who are you?”\n“To, to… Haah, haah… stop, you…!”\nAre they crazy?\nTheir entire bodies are covered in minor wounds. They probably got hit by the wind Mir scattered on the way here.\nIt’s admirable that they can still move like that after being hit, but they must have noticed whose attack it was.\nAnd yet they followed. Have they lost their minds?\n“Interfering in a pleasant situation.”\nShe’ll make them the first sacrifices for the new world Mir desires.\nThe moment she was about to attack them, consumed by anger, Mir stopped her, took out a piece of paper from her bosom, and scribbled something on it.\n“What is this… a map? Don’t tell me this is…”\n“Go ahead to the secret room, Annie.”\n“What? But, but…”\n“Don’t worry. I just felt like playing with them for a bit because their courage is admirable.”\nOnly then did she realize.\nMir was much more excited than she appeared. More than what was visible.\nShe seemed extremely angry at those guys who suddenly interfered with the object she had yearned for for a long time.\nLike a child who had their candy stolen and eaten right before their eyes.\n“…Take your time and enjoy, Mir.”\n“Shame it’ll be over quickly.”",

You want us to stop that thing on our own?! We should have called the teachers!”\nDorothy started scolding me.\nRealizing it was too late to run away, her face turned pale.\n“That’s why I told you to run.”\n“Who would actually run away when you tell them to?! Be, besides, I didn’t expect something like this!”\n“And if it’s the teachers, they’ll be here soon.”\n“What?”\nSiwoo looked at the academy’s main building, which had turned into a mess.\nThey could easily guess where the threatening villains were without even thinking about it.\n“Since they caused such a disturbance, someone will come here soon. We just need to hold out.”\nThere was no need to go find the teachers.\nWith this level of destruction, someone coming here to help would be faster than them going to get the teachers and bringing them.\n“You’re saying something interesting. Those people are probably strong, but can you hold out until they arrive?”\n“…Who knows. It’ll be tough.”\n“But you still came here? What’s your intention?”\nObjectively speaking, immediately running away now would be a much more rational choice than fighting.\nJudging from their appearance, they likely invaded the academy with some purpose in mind, and based on their relaxed demeanor, they have nearly succeeded or already succeeded.\n‘Seeing the dog-eared women moving with purpose, that’s probably correct, right?’\nIn that case, even if he tried to stop them in this situation, it would be meaningless.\nHe was struggling after taking the attack scattered like confetti while defending Dorothy.\nWhen an invisible attack came flying, he was the only one able to block them.\nFrom the beginning, the best move would have been not to come here and protect himself.\nBut Siwoo would never choose that option.\n“That’s simple. I came to stop you.”\n“I don’t get it.”\n“I thought you would be smarter.”\nHe spoke to her, who was looking at me with a questioning gaze.\n“Could someone who runs away in front of a villain become a hero? Idiot.”\n“… You’re just a kid drunk on hero mentality. Well, this is the academy, after all.”\n“You can think that way if you want. I’ve decided not to run away in a situation like this.”\nJust like how Amelia did back then.\nAt that time, in those mountains, she made an irrational decision.\nThe rational judgment would have been to run away using that ability and alert others of the danger.\nInstead, she fought against the villain, saying she couldn’t abandon her friend.\nIn a way, that could be seen as an irrational action.\nBut heroes can’t always act rationally. He realized that after seeing Amelia.\nTo protect.\nHe decided to act without hesitation when an irrational decision was needed.\nSo he decided he would somehow stall that villain’s advance.\nNow was the time to make an irrational decision.\n“Dorothy, since it’s come to this, help me a bit.”\n“I have no choice. I’ll die if I don’t help.”\n“Do you think help from a friend can stop me?”\n“It will be enough.”\nSensing the increasingly raging winds sound an alarm, Siwoo looked at the enemy before him.\n“It’ll be fun teaching reality to kids who can’t grasp it.”\n“Well, auntie. It’s not that we can’t grasp reality. I’ll make you realize that kids these days are stronger than you think.”\n“… You’ve got a mouth on you. Fine, shall we begin?”\n“The scarecrow said: I want a brain. The Wizard agreed to grant the wish.”\nThe moment Dorothy’s voice rang out, he felt a sensation and intense pain as if the world was distorting.\nAnd the winds released from the villain’s hands began raging out of control.\nAnyone else would have had their body torn to shreds by the invisible attack before they knew it.\n…But Siwoo saw it.\nTo him, reinforced by Dorothy, who had hidden herself, the invisible blades were clearly visible.\nThey’re fast. But not as fast as Amelia.\nThey’re sharp. But not as sharp as Arte’s threads.\nAttacks of this level couldn’t injure him.\n“…You dodged. Looks like you’re not just all talk.”\n“Of course. I’m, ugh, quite skilled.”\n“That doesn’t seem to be your original ability…ability enhancement? It seems to have some side effects, too… The duration isn’t very long either. I guess I can play until it runs out.”\n“…Damn it.”\n‘How did she figure all that out just from me retching a bit?’\nIt made his head spin in a different sense from the side effects.\n‘Can I really hold out?’\n…No, he abandoned that thought.\nI will defeat her.\nThis much was nothing.\nWhen was it? He once had a conversation with Amelia about the fear of the unknown.\nThe reason humans fear death is because they don’t know what will happen after they die.\nIn that case, he wasn’t afraid of that villain.\nThe invisible blades that others would fear are visible.\nHe could perceive even the slightest movements and reactions that others wouldn’t notice.\nHe knows what’s coming,\nSo why would he be afraid?\nIf humans’ greatest fear is the fear of the unknown, then I shall become the most fearless being in the world.\n“We don’t have much time, so I’ll end this quickly.”\nThe villain fires off a slash of wind.\nAgain, it’s invisible, but Siwoo can see it.\nHe dodged the oppressive wind that came from above.\n“?!”\n“Sorry, but I can see it all. Deception doesn’t work on me.”\n“… You’re more interesting than I thought. But you can stop bluffing. You look like you’re struggling.”\n“…”\nShe noticed, huh?\nYeah, his head is definitely pounding.\nEven when he was well rested, he couldn’t endure Dorothy’s ability for long.\nEven when he was in good condition, his brain couldn’t handle the amount of information, let alone in this state with his body in tatters.\nHis head was already starting to throb. It didn’t seem like he could hold out for long. He could already feel the ability waning.\n…But that doesn’t mean there’s no way.\n“Dorothy, I need something stronger!”\nHe shouted aloud.\nDorothy definitely heard him, but nothing changed.\nShe refused.\n“Dorothy, at this rate, I’m going to die. It’ll be better to use it and at least try something.”\nThe villain was still at ease. She must have judged that she could kill me at any time.\nHe could feel her gaze, watching to see what he would do.\n… She’ll regret that judgment.\nAs if hearing his desperate plea, he felt the world spin.\nStrength began overflowing through his entire body as if my whole body had recovered. He felt like he could do anything.\nBut the feeling of omnipotence was short-lived. Terrible pain pounded his entire body, making him realize he was in a dangerous situation.\n“Huff, hah, haah…”\nHe couldn’t tell if his body was breaking down because he was abusing Dorothy’s ability or if his body was too tattered to continue.\nMaybe it was both.\nEvery step he took was accompanied by intense pain, and it felt like time was passing slowly.\n…I can’t endure any longer.\nMy body wouldn’t last long.\nSo, let’s give my all.\nWith that thought, his vision went black.\n“You’re closing your eyes? There’s a limit to ignoring me…!”\n…Did he close his eyes?\nHe didn’t remember doing that. They must have closed on their own.\nBut he doesn’t mind. Even if he can’t see, he can perceive.\nHe gradually lost sensation in his body and stopped smelling the thick scent of dirt and blood.\n“…! I’ll… kill…!”\nFinally, Siwoo could no longer hear the villain’s irritated voice, probably feeling he was ignoring her.\nAll sensation in his body vanished.\nHe couldn’t see, hear, smell, taste, or feel anything.\nA feeling as if only he existed in the darkness.\nIs this what death would be like?\nHe let out a sigh.\nNo, was it really a sigh? With his senses gone, he couldn’t be sure.\nAn ordinary person would feel extreme fear at this point.\nWith all five senses gone, they wouldn’t be able to move.\n…But he had his Intuition.\nSixth sense.\nThe ability to perceive what humans cannot.\nThe ability to see what cannot be seen, hear what cannot be heard, feel what cannot be felt, and smell what cannot be smelled.\nRelying on his ability, Siwoo took steps forward and suddenly realized numerous paths were laid out before him.\nOn many of those paths, Siwoo lay collapsed, bleeding all over from his body being torn by the wind.\nBut on a few paths, Siwoo survived. He decided to take those paths.\nAs he walked, another fork appeared before him.\n…Again, most versions of Siwoo died, but a minority did not.\nHe decided to take the path where a version of Siwoo survived.\nHe repeated this dozens of times.\nBefore long, only two paths remained before Siwoo.\nThe path where his entire body is torn apart by the wind barrier the villain hastily set up, and the path where that doesn’t happen.\nSiwoo walked the path where it didn’t happen and swung his sword.\nHe couldn’t feel any sensation. With his fading consciousness, Siwoo couldn’t be sure if he swung.\nThat was the end.\nSiwoo’s consciousness went black, and the world turned completely dark.",

      "content": "Just Because I Have Narrow Eyes Doesn’t Make Me a Villain! - Chapter 65\n“Author-nim, what is that…?”\n[Oh my god… What an awesome scene…!]\n“We can talk about that later. Hurry up and answer me! What is that?!”\nI yelled at the Author roughly without realizing it.\nShe clearly said that the protagonist wouldn’t be able to win.\nSo, as soon as I managed to escape the Tiger, I rushed over…\nBut the sight before my eyes was quite different from what she said.\nFar from Siwoo being defeated by the villain in an instant, he dodged all the attacks the flustered villain unleashed.\n“What is happening?! You said he wouldn’t be able to win!”\n[Is that so? Siwoo is surprisingly strong!]\n“…What?”\n[I thought he would just die without even landing a single hit. But seeing this, I think we can have some expectations!]\nThe Author doesn’t know everything.\nI knew that better than anyone.\nWell, she is the one who causes incidents at the drop of a hat after all.\nBut the Author I know isn’t as stupid as you’d think.\nSure, she often does idiotic things, but she pays a lot of attention to the protagonist.\nBecause he’s the core figure of the novel. Because he’s the protagonist.\nThere’s no way the Author wouldn’t know about Siwoo.\nIn that case, there’s only one conclusion.\nThe makeshift setting she threw in to save the protagonist was surprisingly strong.\nI couldn’t think of anything else.\n“…Ah, aha. Author, please explain.”\n[Yes?]\n“You inputted a setting into Siwoo, right? What in the world did you put in to make him like that…?”\n[I didn’t do anything like that.]\n“…What did you just say?”\n[I haven’t changed anything.]\nI was wrong.\nIt was wrong.\nThe only inference I could make turned out to be wrong.\n…What is this? What on earth is happening?\nCountless thoughts swirled in my head and began to disappear.\nAt this very moment, Siwoo was slowly approaching the villain. Dodging all the numerous attacks and sometimes deflecting them.\nThat can’t be.\nThe Siwoo I’ve seen so far isn’t this strong.\nDorothy. For a moment, I thought of her but denied it. It’s the same even if he receives Dorothy’s buff.\nI’ve seen it once before. It has major side effects and didn’t make him that strong.\nIn the first place, rather than Siwoo dodging the attacks, doesn’t it seem more like the attacks are avoiding him?\nThere must be something more…!\n[Hmm, I guess the variable was bigger than I thought…]\n“…Variable?”\n[Well, you see, the protagonist can’t be modified. I didn’t intend to alter him much in the first place, and sometimes it’s inconvenient.]\nThose words the Author let slip.\nThe moment I heard those words, my thoughts came to a halt.\nWhat on earth did I just hear?\nIt felt like the world was collapsing at the words the Author lightly dropped.\nA feeling like the world was collapsing and being reassembled.\nI realized that what I had taken for granted all this time wasn’t actually a given.\n“…Siwoo can’t be modified?”\n[Yes. Hmm, I don’t really know the reason myself. It’s never happened before.]\nI blankly stared at Siwoo fighting the villain.\nIt was clearly a fight he couldn’t win, and he seemed half out of his mind, but he was slowly approaching.\nIt was the same even when the dragon human, flustered by the unexpected situation, hurriedly launched a sincere attack.\nEndlessly, he was taking steps forward.\n[Originally, he should have lost without even getting close… Well, this is cool too, so it’s fine, right? As expected of the protagonist, overcoming adversity…!]\nThe Author began excitedly chattering about seeing a cool scene, but it didn’t register at all.\nThe only thing I could see was Siwoo.\nWith his eyes closed, he looked like he would collapse at any moment as he staggered, but he didn’t fall.\nIn this world where the Author nonchalantly toys with things as she pleases.\nIn this world where everyone is affected by the Author.\nIn a world where someone who has lived their whole life diligently becomes a villain with a single lightly touched setting, and where a villain gains a tragic backstory of actually being kind with a single lightly touched setting.\nIn a world like a puppet show played by a child, where everyone is a puppet, I thought I was the only human.\nI couldn’t take my eyes off him as he advanced toward the enemy the Author declared he couldn’t defeat.\nIt’s dangerous. He clearly can’t win.\nI needed to help him right away.\nThe Author is delighted, saying it’s a scene of the protagonist’s exploits, but there’s no way he’ll win.\nHe looked to be in a fragile state. The protagonist isn’t invincible. He might die.\n…Even as I thought that, I couldn’t move my feet at all.\nBecause I was wondering if what I’m thinking is really true.\nWorrying that I might be mistaken.\nAnd the sight that blew away my hesitation entered my eyes.\n“…He landed a hit.”\n[He really did! Wow, I got a great scene!]\nHe attacked.\nEven though I thought there was no way he could win.\nEven though the Author said he would lose without even getting close, let alone attacking.\nHearing her happy voice saying this was good in its own way, I laughed.\n“Ah, aha. Ahaha…! Ahahahahahahahaha!”\n[Geez, you startled me. Why are you laughing like that? …It was cool, but is it a funny scene?]\n“Ah, ahaha! Ahahaha!”\nI couldn’t stop laughing. I felt like I wouldn’t be able to endure it if I didn’t laugh.\nJust one.\nOnly one.\nI was convinced that I was the only human in this world.\nThe other people were just puppets in human form.\nPuppets pulled along by the childish power wielded by the Author, led by the strings of fate.\nI thought the protagonist wouldn’t be any different.\nNo, I thought he was a puppet precisely because he was the protagonist.\nI thought he was a distinct existence from the other puppets, like a cherished doll.\n…I was wrong. I was completely wrong.\nHe’s not some mere puppet. He can’t be compared to the likes of them.\nThe Author is the truth.\nHe should have lost without even getting close.\nSiwoo moved.\nHe approached the villain and swung his sword.\nWith staggering steps. Despite his blood-soaked body.\nSiwoo moved even in the worst situation, not forcibly moved by the strings of fate connected by the Author, but by his own will.\n“…Ah, you’re amazing, Siwoo.”\n[Right? This is the appeal a protagonist should have after all! I don’t think this development is bad either!]\nThe smile on my lips showed no sign of fading.\nBecause I found it.\nIn this world full of puppets,\nThere is a person.\n***\n“Are, are you crazy…? Who, who are you…?!”\nMir yelled while clutching her throbbing head that was hit.\nHe was definitely a powerless kid.\nA kid I could easily handle even with the reinforcement from the woman next to him.\nFor a moment, I felt my life being threatened.\nIf this guy had endured for just one more second, I would have…!\n“How dare you, how dare you…! I was in a good mood, so I decided to play with you for a bit…!”\nI looked at the kid lying collapsed, covered in blood.\nTo think I seriously thought I would die to a guy like this.\nTo a kid who hasn’t even grown up yet, who is still attending the academy.\n“… It’s dangerous.”\nI almost died to a kid who hadn’t finished growing yet.\nI couldn’t let him live.\nBecause I didn’t know if this hero-syndrome-afflicted academy student would come to interfere again someday.\nWhat if I encountered him again after he had grown a bit more?\nI could console myself, saying it was only dangerous this time because I had let my guard down, but I decided not to do that.\nI had to acknowledge what I needed to humbly. That this guy is dangerous.\nIf I let him live and encountered him again after he grew, I might be unable to win next time.\n“…How lucky. Not you, but me.”\nI wonder if I had been hindered by Arachne all this time for the sake of luckily surviving now.\nCalming my unnerved heart, Mir condensed wind in her hand.\nIn order to kill that dangerous guy.\nHe’ll be a threat if he grows up. Judging from how he dodged even my invisible attacks as if he could see right through them, surprise attacks probably won’t work, either.\nIt’ll be too late by then. I have to finish him off now.\n“Die…!”\n“…What are you doing, you mere puppet.”\n“?!”\nAt the voice heard by my ear, I hurriedly tried to unleash my ability to attack the surroundings.\nBut perhaps because I was hit in the head, a brief gap was created, and the enemy didn’t miss that opening.\n“Argh…!”\n“Do you even know who you were trying to kill? He’s not someone the likes of you should lay a hand on.”\n“Urk, ugh…! You, you…!”\nIt was a surprise attack, and while a brief gap was created, my right arm was sliced off in an instant.\nWhat, what is this…!\nForcing the winds that wouldn’t gather properly with my severed arm, I looked at the enemy who had assaulted me.\nThe tattered outfit. And the threads visible around them.\nWith a string that didn’t fit a battlefield at all, I could easily infer their identity.\n“Those threads…! It’s you, Arachne! What happened to Lan?!”\n“Lan? …Ah, that guy? Don’t know, probably dead. I don’t care.”\nArachne seemed to have no interest in me whatsoever.\nHer gaze was solely directed at the guy who had just collapsed.\nTo think she would ignore me even though I was critically injured.\nIrritation welled up at the humiliation I had never experienced before.\n“Don’t, ignore, me…!”\n“I’ve never ignored you, Übermensch. Because you’re dangerous.”\nIn an instant, threads came flying toward my body just as I was about to use my ability to counterattack.\nThe world tilted again, and the wind blew in a strange direction.\nAt that moment, I realized.\nMy fate ends here.\nThe fatal mistake of being unable to hold back my excitement at obtaining the object I had aimed for my whole life and letting my guard down for a moment.\nThat single mistake ended everything.\n“…Ugh.”\n“A puppet shouldn’t injure a person. You crossed the line.”\nI saw Annie hurriedly running over with something in her hand through my blurring vision.\nSorry, Annie.\nCreate the new world in my place.",

There was something more important to her.\n“… You’re alive.”\nHe was bleeding but clearly alive.\nI used all my remaining thread to wrap Siwoo to bring him to the hospital as quickly and safely as possible.\n“Mi, Mir…! Mir!”\nI had to leave the academy with my body only roughly covered by my jacket.\nThere was no time to feel embarrassed. It was an emergency.\nThere were probably more than a few injured people. They obviously couldn’t do more than first aid, let alone proper treatment.\nWe need to go to the hospital.\n[Re, Reader-nim?! You’re not going to finish the last executive?!]\n“There’s no time.”\n[What?! B-but…!]\nI lightly ignored the Author’s words.\nI didn’t have any thread left to use right now, and I had to do something much more important than that.\nIf that puppet causes problems later, I can just erase it.\nBut Siwoo is different.\nHe’s someone I have to protect.\nNo matter what.\n“He’s the protagonist. It’ll be big trouble if he dies.”\n[Well, that’s true…]\n“Right. This is unavoidable for his safety. You said you can’t even change his settings? What are you going to do if the protagonist dies here.”\nThe Author didn’t seem to want to stop serializing yet.\nSo, I decided to throw the nail in the coffin.\n“Don’t tell me… Author-nim, are you already preparing the discontinuation notice?”\n[…Okay.]\nAfter roughly getting her agreement, I left the scene.\nWell, she has no choice but to agree. She said with their own mouth that the protagonist can’t be modified.\nThen she can’t revise it to make it seem like Siwoo was fine. He’s really injured right now, and badly.\nWhat if he becomes untreatable because I was too slow?\nThat can’t happen.\nThe students fought the weak villains, and the teachers hurriedly came to the academy’s main building.\nAnd the corpse of the Übermensch leader and the dog next to it disappeared at some point.\nBut why would I care about the other bastards?\nOnly Siwoo mattered.\nThe world’s protagonist, a human in this puppet show.\nJust Siwoo.\n***\nSiwoo suddenly frowned.\nA bright light shone as if to torment his closed eyes.\n“Ugh…”\nIgnoring the sensation that felt like it was stabbing his pupils, he tried to go back to sleep but couldn’t fall asleep again, so he decided to get up.\nHis head felt dazed, but he couldn’t keep his eyes closed any longer.\nSwallowing his sudden irritation, Siwoo opened his eyes and was startled again.\n“…Are you awake?”\n“Eek?!”\nBecause he saw Arte staring at him with her red eyes wide open, unlike her usual narrowed eyes.\n“Ack?!”\n“Ow… O-ouch…”\nSurprised, he sat up and collided with Arte.\nSiwoo and Arte rubbed their reddened foreheads from the unexpected accident.\n“I’m glad you seem healthy… And you’re still…”\n“What do you…”\n“I heard your muscles were damaged, and your brain was almost destroyed too. You didn’t wake up for days. I really thought you had died.”\n“What?!”\nSiwoo hurriedly looked around the room.\nThe white room and the IV drip. The slightly musty smell is unique to hospitals, like medicine.\nRealizing that the place he was lying in was a hospital, Siwoo finally started to come to his senses.\n“Ah, the academy! What happened to the academy…!”\n“It’s already over.”\n“… It’s over?”\n“Yes, definitely. Übermensch has been annihilated. Ta-da.”\nAlthough Arte spoke in a light tone, as if a child was talking about a play, the content was not light.\nThe annihilation of Übermensch.\nIn other words, while he was sleeping, everything ended.\n“It was on the news? What was the academy doing? Those incompetent Association bastards.”\n“Ca-casualties?! No, are Amelia and Dorothy okay?!”\n“…Worrying about others as soon as you wake up? Don’t worry, everyone is safe.”\n“They’re okay…?”\nArte smiled and pointed to the table.\nOn the table was a calendar.\n“Well, everything has been handled in the week you were–”\n“A week?!”\n“Yes. A week. After checking, there were no deaths and about 10 people seriously injured, most with minor injuries.”\nAlong with saying that it was mostly the teachers who were seriously injured, Arte told him that if it weren’t for the teachers, there would have been even more damage.\n“One executive missing, three dead. Most of the villains were arrested. The end, it’s over.”\n“…I see.”\nNo students died in that chaos.\nHe was resentful, wondering why the teachers weren’t coming when he was holding out in the main building.\nThere was a reason for everything.\n“But Arte.”\n“Yes?”\n“Can you move away a little?”\n“…Why?”\nHuh?\nHe never expected this kind of reaction.\nHe thought she would naturally say, “Oh, I’m sorry,” and give some distance, but an unexpected reaction returned.\nWh-what?\nSomething was strange. It was Arte as usual… but.\n“Th-that’s…”\nWhat could he say?\n‘You smell too good being close, so I want you to move away a bit?’\nAbsolutely not.\nIf he says that kind of thing as soon as he woke up, he’d deservedly be treated as a pervert with no excuses.\nAfter going through so much hardship, he couldn’t become a sex offender.\nAt that moment, when he was agonizing over what to do, an unexpected person helped me.\n“You’re awake?”\n“Ah. Hello.”\n“Amelia…!”\n“… What’s with that reaction? Creepy.”\nA timely help that came in by chance.\nWith Amelia’s interruption, Arte’s attention naturally shifted to her, and Siwoo sneakily moved away.\nPerfect, Amelia. Thanks.\n“Is your leg okay?”\n“Huh? …Ah, it’s fine. They said I can slowly start walking now.”\nAmelia smiled brightly and lifted her crutches.\nAnd that’s when he noticed Amelia was badly injured.\nOne of her legs was thickly wrapped in bandages.\nHe could tell, even without it being said, that Amelia was one of the seriously injured.\n“You’re hurt?”\n“…Yeah, well. That guy was fast. I got hit by one low kick, twist my leg.”\n“What?!”\n“Don’t worry. They said there won’t be long-lasting effects.”\nShe waved her leg wrapped in thick bandages as if it were fine and smiled brightly.\n“Dad got revenge for me too!”\n“…Dad? The hero…”\n“Yeah. I almost died, but luckily, Dad came. Without time to dodge, wham.”\nShe spoke playfully, but the content was not light at all.\nShe brushes it off so easily, even though she almost died.\nAs expected, Amelia is tough.\nShe usually doesn’t show it, but the toughness she occasionally displays is impressive.\n“…Ah, Arte. Sorry, but can I talk to Siwoo alone for a bit?”\n“Why are you asking me…?”\n“No, well. I want to have a heart-to-heart talk between friends. Candidly.”\nHe could feel Amelia gauging Arte’s reaction.\n…What? Why is she being cautious?\nAmelia requested Arte while emphasizing the word friends.\n“Okay. Should I come back in about an hour?”\n“Thanks. That much is enough.”\n“It’s nothing.”\nSeeing Arte off, Amelia sighed deeply a little while after.\n“You, you…! Siwoo! What did you do?!”\n“Wh-what?”\n“What the hell did you do to Arte?!”\n“I was just sleeping. What could I have done?!”\nSiwoo was ready to be reprimanded, but what was she on about suddenly?\nRather than the typical nagging, it felt like she was excited.\nNo, not just a feeling. It was clear. Amelia was excited.\n…A sense of unease came over him.\nHe never received good news when she was like this.\n“You, you bastard…! Good job! I don’t know what it is, but you really did well!”\n“With what?!”\n“Arte acting like that, didn’t you do something? It seems like she’s half fallen for you!”\n“What are you talking about again…”\n“Managing to seduce a girl even amid such a fight. I didn’t see you like that, but you’ve got some moves, eh~?”\nAnd his worries were not unfounded.\nTalking nonsense again.\n“What nonsense are you saying? I didn’t do anything!”\n“That can’t be true. You might not be able to see it, but she was caring for you with utmost devotion?”\n“What’s that…”\n“She watched over you for more than 3 hours every day without fail before leaving? What did you do? Tell me honestly!”\n…What?\n‘She watched over me for more than 3 hours a day?’\n“Wh-what do you…”\n“Just what on earth did you do? Tell me already. We need to plan the next steps.”\nShe was watching over me for more than 3 hours a day?\n…Really?\nSuddenly, Arte’s ominously shining eyes, which he saw as soon as he opened his eyes, came to mind.\nAlong with that face that was close enough to bump foreheads with when he abruptly sat up.\n“D-don’t tell me, earlier too…”\nWas she continuously watching over him?\nWhy in the world? What got into her?\n‘I didn’t do anything?!’\nHe thought he was ready for anything when he got used to Arte stalking him.\nA chill ran down his spine at her incomprehensible actions.",

      "content": "“…You really didn’t do anything?”\n“I told you I didn’t!”\nSiwoo complained to Amelia about the unfairness.\nIf he had done something, he would at least know the reason.\nHe did nothing, but Arte watched over him for hours.\nAnd visited every day.\n‘…Huh? Come to think of it, it’s not that different from usual, right?’\n“…Nothing has changed.”\n“What?”\n“No, I was startled at first, but thinking about it, I realized it’s the same as always. If she stares at me every day, it’s not really different, right? I am a bit grateful for the hospital visit, though. It’s quite touching.”\n‘We’re celebrating over nothing.”\nHe must have been a little flustered seeing Arte’s face right as he opened my eyes.\n“…You, you. Are you okay with that?”\n“Huh? What?”\n“No, nothing… Right, if you’re fine with it, then whatever…”\n“?”\nAmelia looked at Siwoo dumbfounded, but he couldn’t understand why.\nArte had already watched over him from the beginning.\nHe’s gotten so used to seeing her wandering around his house every night before going to bed that it feels routine.\nHe did get chills for a moment from the fact that she was staring at me so closely this time, but nothing really changed except the distance.\nIt’s not something for Siwoo to be afraid of.\nHe was briefly flustered by the new situation, but there was nothing much to fear upon closer thought!\n“Is that all you have to say?”\n“Oh, well. Originally, we were planning to go to the beach…”\n“The beach?”\n“Yeah. You don’t remember? I mentioned it during the closing ceremony. That we should hang out together.”\n“…Ah, right.”\nHe had completely forgotten about it since the incident happened right after the closing ceremony started.\nDid we have that conversation?\nThe talk about hanging out after the closing ceremony disappeared, and only the part about going to the beach remained.\n“But your leg…”\n“Ah, it’s fine. It’ll heal in a week… But what about you?”\n“Huh?”\n“It doesn’t really work if you’re…”\nAh.\nHe realized why Amelia was trailing off.\nShe clearly thought there was no point if he couldn’t go.\nThere can’t be a date with only one person.\n“Well, maybe this time…”\nHe was about to suggest they shouldn’t do it with the recent events.\nBut he suddenly shut his mouth.\nTo Amelia, who was looking at him with a puzzled expression after he abruptly stopped talking, he brought up the complete opposite of what he was going to say.\n“My condition isn’t great, but I think I’ll be fine in a week too. I’ll probably be discharged by then.”\n“Really? Then I should ask Arte if she wants–”\n“I’m fine with it too.”\n“?!”\nArte, who suddenly appeared, smiled at the startled Amelia.\n“The beach sounds nice, doesn’t it? I can’t believe you were having this conversation behind my back.”\n“Arte. When did you come…?”\n“Just now. I thought something was up since it was taking a while. If it were this kind of talk, it would have been fine for me to listen in from the beginning.”\n“Ah, ahaha… I-is that so…?”\nAmelia glared as if asking why the hell he didn’t say anything.\nShe must have realized that Siwoo noticed Arte’s presence because he dodged the question.\n‘Why is she so unnecessarily sharp.’\nBut what could he have done?\nShe was already within earshot by the time he noticed.\n“Let’s invite Dorothy too, and all go together.”\n“…Oh, Dorothy, too?”\n“Yes. Isn’t it nice to go with friends? Leaving someone out is mean, you know.”\n“Hmm. Okay.”\nAmelia tilted her head as if it was different from what she thought.\nShe was probably thinking something weird again.\nSomething like Arte must have fallen hard for Siwoo, so she wouldn’t want to bring another girl.\nContrary to what she expected, Arte was the first to suggest bringing Dorothy, so she seemed flustered.\n…But why is that?\nSiwoo then sighed inwardly.\n‘I must have been too influenced by Amelia.’\nHe couldn’t even imagine that Arte would suggest bringing Dorothy too.\nThinking that Arte might find them strange, he hurriedly changed the subject.\n“…But it’s a shame. A week has already passed?”\n“Huh? Yes, it has, why?”\n“I wasted a precious week of vacation… Sigh…”\nIt was a topic he brought up hurriedly, wanting to change the subject, but he couldn’t help but sigh after saying it.\nVacation, vacation.\nNo matter how rewarding getting stronger is, repeating sparring, classes, and training every day is bound to get tiring.\nEven if it was not a very long period, knowing you could rest well would help anyone’s mental stab.\nBut a week of precious time has disappeared.\nWithout doing anything.\nEven if he could move freely right now, they’ll probably perform a thorough examination just in case.\nIf he were being generous, it would be at least a week long.\nHalf a month will disappear without doing anything.\n“The vacation was already short…”\n“Ah, I heard this vacation will be a bit longer.”\n“What?”\n“Ah, you don’t know. I forgot you just woke up.”\nSiwoo didn’t know what she was talking about, but he could tell one thing.\nShe wasn’t smiling menacingly, so it couldn’t be bad.\n“There was talk that the academy’s buildings are not operational.”\n“Not operational?”\n“The villains didn’t hold back in their destruction.”\n“…Ah.”\nSuddenly, that scene from before he fainted came to mind.\nThe main building was a mess after the villain with strange horns used her ability.\n“Upon investigation, they found a room that appeared out of nowhere, and they had no idea where it came from.”\n“…Room?”\n“Yes. It seems someone made it long ago, but it hasn’t been revealed until now.”\n“…”\nThat’s the Secret Room.\nArte probably thought they wouldn’t know and told us, but they did.\nThat there was a Secret Room.\n…It was exposed.\n“It’s presumed that they attacked the academy to find something within it, so the academy made a big decision.”\n“…What does that have to do with vacation?”\n“It’s related. They’re renovating the buildings.”\n“What?”\n“They’re going to remake them, basically. I heard they’ve started with the demolition.”\nAmelia shared shocking news.\nThey’re renovating the buildings, really?\n“For hundreds of years, they only did maintenance in the name of tradition, but issues have been revealed.”\n“They were sturdy but also old, and the fact that there has been something hidden until now must have been a threat.”\n“Yeah. This time, the villains came in to find the Secret Room blatantly, but what if there were secret passages?”\n“…That’s terrible.”\n“Intruders could rush in all at once without anyone knowing. The academy can’t just sit back and pray it wasn’t the case.”\nSiwoo didn’t even consider it.\nThere was something they didn’t even know existed, hiding in their own backyard.\nIf there’s a Secret Room, there might be passages, too. It’s only natural to have that thought.\n“There have been way too many incidents at the academy these days, so I heard they’re going to reconstruct it and improve various things.”\n“There was talk that the vacation will be extended by about two weeks because of that.”\n“…I see.”\nFor Siwoo, it was a blessing in disguise.\nIt might be strange to have this thought not long after the incident happened…\nBut on school days, he only takes classes and trains.\nDuring the holidays, he can rest or train as he needs to.\nThey were very different.\n“Let’s stop the gloomy talk and have a fun conversation… What are your plans for the trip?”\n“We have a villa that my family owns. How about there?”\n“That sounds great!”\n‘…I keep forgetting her family is rich.’\nShe’s not the type to boast that her family is well-off, so Siwoo sometimes forgets that she’s the daughter of a wealthy family.\nWhen he’s occasionally reminded of it, it just feels wrong.\nNo matter how he thinks about it, she doesn’t seem like a rich family’s lady but a lively neighborhood girl…\nShe also looks noble in dire situations, proving her righteous upbringing.\nThen, she returns to her usual conduct.\n‘Just how was Amelia raised to have this kind of personality…?’\n“We’ll have to get swimsuits.”\n“Huh? Come to think of it, you’re right.”\n“Swimsuits? …Ah.”\nSiwoo was about to suggest the ones the school gave.\nBut they were in the school lockers.\nDemolition work must be in full swing by now.\nEven if the swimsuits were fine after that villain’s wind attack, they must have been smashed to the point of being unusable by now.\n“Okay. Then let’s push back the date and meet up once everyone feels better!”\n“…Huh? W-wait.”\n“It’ll be fun to go shopping together too. How about it?”\n“Oh, well. I don’t mind.”\nSeeing Arte and Amelia talking cheerfully, he felt uneasy.\nThe atmosphere is strangely shifting.\nCome to think of it, this combination has considerable issues.\n‘… I’m the only guy!’\nIt’s burdensome even with one guy and two girls, but it’ll be three if Dorothy joins.\nHe usually didn’t care, but wouldn’t the beach be a little dangerous?\nNo, even if they can somehow manage the beach, wouldn’t it be more of an issue for him to go along with three girls to buy swimsuits?\nAlright, there’s no choice.\nHere, I’ll run away like a man.\nAmelia will understand.\n“I, I…”\n“You’re joining, right?”\n“I’m sorry, but–\nBefore he could reject Amelia, Arte, who sneakily approached, whispered to me.\n“Don’t you want to see pretty swimsuits?”\n“…Huh?”\n“Hoho, you can look forward to it.”\n“…What? Huh?”\n‘Are my ears working properly?’\n…She asked if he wanted to see pretty swimsuits.\nWhy? With what intention?\nHuh? Huh???\n_____________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nA reader: This is unrealistic. From the description alone, the academy is huge. How is it being demolished and reconstructed in a month!!\nAuthor-nim: People with abilities.\n(Not exactly what went down, but basically that.)",

      "content": "“…Everyone is late.”\n[That’s true~]\n“Why aren’t they coming?”\n[Who knows~]\nStrange.\nWe were definitely supposed to meet here around this time.\nBut none of them are in sight.\nEven the Author seemed bored, dragging out her words.\nLooking at the clock again, it was indeed the promised time. 2:10 PM.\nJust in case, I took out my phone to check the conversation, confirmed that the meeting time was 2:00 PM on Saturday, and checked the date again.\nIt’s correct. Saturday, 2:00 PM. No doubt about it.\n…Hmm, I guess they’re a bit late. Should I wait?\nI thought about sending a text asking when they would gather but decided not to go that far.\nThey’ll be here soon.\n“I guess everyone is running a bit late. I expected Siwoo to arrive first.”\n[Huh? Why?]\n“No, well… If he’s a guy, wouldn’t he be excited?”\nNot just anyone, but the heroines in swimsuits.\nThe exposure level of a swimsuit is practically no different from underwear, right?\nPerhaps because they’re heroines, Amelia and Dorothy are both pretty.\nMost superhumans are good-looking, but is it because they’re heroines?\nThey definitely stood out compared to other students.\n“Hmm, with Amelia and Dorothy, shouldn’t he be here early, thanking his luck?”\n[…Is that so~?]\n“Of course! Those two are so pretty!”\nAmelia is the typical lively blonde beauty with blue eyes.\nShe’s a pretty girl with braided hair along her bangs.\nHer figure is moderately voluptuous but quite tall, so her model-like proportions are beautiful.\nAnd what about Dorothy?\nShe’s a pretty girl with slightly timid-looking brown hair and beautiful green eyes.\nUnlike Amelia, her large breasts are impressive.\n…Where did Siwoo go, leaving these girls behind?\n“Was he not curious about Amelia and Dorothy in swimsuits…? I even encouraged him to look forward to it.”\nIt seemed like he was hesitating to come, so I brought up a topic that would stimulate any guy.\nI wouldn’t be able to resist seeing Amelia and Dorothy in swimsuits, either. I would’ve been the same.\nAs expected, when I casually mentioned that, it was impressive how he nodded as if entranced.\nBoys that age wouldn’t be able to hold back.\nI know well since I went through that phase. Even if you don’t want to care, you can’t help but care.\n[Why do you think he’ll only care about those two?]\n“What?”\n[Reader-nim, you’re a girl now too. Couldn’t Siwoo be attracted to you?]\n“Haha, you’ve gotten quite imaginative. There’s no way.”\nThe Author is really good at making jokes, too.\nThere’s no way.\n“I think I’m quite pretty too, but not enough to outshine the two heroines, you know?”\n[…Hmm, is that so?]\n“I haven’t had much contact with Siwoo either. Even if he looks my way, there’s no reason for him to be drawn to me.”\n[Re-really?]\n“I’m telling you.”\nWhat incidents did I get involved with Siwoo…?\nWhat was there?\nFirst spar, comforting him when he couldn’t recover from the shock of his first kill, meeting as enemies in the finals.\nThat’s about it, right?\nAh, there were club activities too.\nWe met as enemies in the first spar and the finals. He was an obstacle.\nFor club activities, the three of us mostly moved together, and even then, Amelia and Siwoo spent much more time together.\nHe must have rapidly gotten close to Dorothy through the 2v2 tournament practice.\nThe only incident where I might have gotten close to Siwoo was comforting him after I killed that chameleon thing, right?… I can’t really think of anything else.\nThat was probably offset by me suddenly going a little crazy when we rode the Ferris wheel.\nHe must have thought that crazy bitch is having a fit on her own.\n“Whenever there was a major incident, I had to be around him, but we didn’t really interact outside them.”\n[Hmm, is that so…]\n“I’m telling you.”\nThe Author’s reaction was ambiguous, but I wasn’t wrong, was I?\n“If it was just me alone as the pretty one, it might be different, but there are several pretty girls and two heroines closer to him than me.”\nObjectively speaking, nothing happened that would make Siwoo somehow drawn to me.\nEven comforting him is something a friend could do.\n“…However, Author-nim. There is one thing you should be careful of.”\n[A precaution?]\n“Yes. A precaution.”\nIn some popular novels, the protagonist is a popular character, and sometimes, supporting characters or extras try to cozy up to him.\n…I can’t allow that.\n“Some strange girls better not try to get close, okay? You were roughly planning to include a beach episode, right?”\n[Huh? H-how did you…]\n“I won’t tolerate those kinds of girls approaching him.”\nThat’s right, it’s unforgivable.\nSiwoo is the protagonist. The one and only unique existence in the world.\n…And, one of only two humans in the world.\n“Amelia and Dorothy… And maybe future heroine candidates are okay.”\nI can barely tolerate them.\nUnless the Author goes crazy, she can’t just throw away a heroine who has appeared this many times and say she was a spy for some secret organization.\n…You might bring up Lyla, but that’s different.\nShe had no real connection to me and Siwoo, and it was the beginning of the school year.\nIt was a time when we didn’t properly know what kind of person she was.\nHonestly, deep down, I hope no new heroines that might appear someday show up either.\nBecause it’s easy for the Author to change their settings as she wishes.\nIt’s a different story from Amelia or Dorothy, whose personalities and backgrounds are roughly known already.\nLike suddenly saying she’s from some new villain organization and kidnapping Siwoo…\nGrrr. (TN: ??? Sure?)\n[…Reader?]\n“Ah, it’s nothing.”\nAnyway, that kind of incident must not happen.\nBecause he’s an existence that can’t be replaced by anyone else in this world.\nBoth the Author and I want Siwoo to survive, but…\nWhat would happen if Siwoo, the protagonist, dies?\nThe Author said with her own mouth that she couldn’t touch Siwoo.\n…A person is always exposed to all sorts of dangers. You never know when an accident might happen and kill you.\nI don’t know exactly what kind of existence the Author is.\nWhether she really has the job of an author, how she freely manipulates this world, or whether she’s really human.\nThe one thing I’m certain of is just that she’s close to an omnipotent existence.\nShe would also want Siwoo to survive…\nBut what if–just what if–Siwoo dies?\nWill the Author throw away this world?\nIf that happens, what will become of the world?\nWill it crumble? Or will it continue on as if nothing happened?\nHe’s the person I found in this world.\nThe only one besides me.\nIf I lose such an existence, can I really stay sane?\n…If I hadn’t noticed his existence from the beginning, I might not have known, but now I can say for certain.\nI won’t be able to endure it.\n“…Anyway, it’s cliché for those extras to approach the protagonist, so it can’t happen. Got it?”\n[Hmm… Is that so…? Reader-nim has always been right… Alright! I understand!]\nFortunately–or unfortunately–the Author is not the meticulous type.\nShe’s the type to roughly cause things to happen and only realizes her mistake after a problem occurs.\n…What would happen if she accidentally kills the protagonist?\nThat absolutely can’t happen.\nI’m going to save him. Definitely.\nI couldn’t leave Siwoo in danger.\nWhat if some extras try to cozy up to him, and suddenly the Author says it would be fun and adds a setting where they’re villains who like surprise attacks?\n…No!\nWho cares if he has an ability that completely prevents that?\nThe only thing that came to mind was that the world is dangerous.\nAt least I can trust the people around him so far. But not others.\nI have to get a grip…! Absolutely, absolutely no dangerous incidents can…\nAs my thoughts spread that far, I suddenly got chills.\n…Why aren’t they coming?\nDid the Author do something behind my back again?\nOr in a place she didn’t set, was the protagonist suddenly stabbed and attacked?\nDon’t tell me he’s already in danger…!\n“Um, Arte.”\n“That absolutely, absolutely can’t happen… Where is…!”\n“Arte?”\n“Ah.”\nI heard Siwoo’s voice behind me and hurriedly turned my head.\nI was spacing out a bit while waiting, so I didn’t notice the people approaching behind me.\nFortunately, the voice I heard was a familiar one.\nSiwoo. The protagonist.\nI agonized over sending my subordinates to search the city thoroughly, but thankfully, he seemed fine.\n“Sorry, I was spacing out for a bit…”\n“No, we should be sorry. Sorry, were we a bit late?”\n“…”\nFor a moment, I felt awkward.\nAnd I realized why the three of them were late.\n“Just what did you put so much effort into?”\n“…Ah, you noticed?”\n“Wouldn’t I be stupid not to notice this?”\nNo matter how you look at it, it was different from usual.\n…How should I put it? It felt like they received styling at some specialty shop.\nIt’s hard to explain properly since I haven’t been to such a place, but it felt like they splurged a lot of money.\n“Miss Dorothy, what were you doing not stopping them…”\n“I tried to stop them, saying we would be late, but they wouldn’t listen.”\n“Sigh…”\nThere’s only one person by whom those two would get dragged around.\nWhen I glared at Amelia, she hurriedly spilled excuses.\n“I-I’m sorry we’re late! But don’t they look cool?! I-I tried to dress up a bit since we’re going anyway! Everyone arrived earlier than I thought…!”\n“…The other two didn’t even get dressed up?”\n“We ran out of time! S-so for now, we only did Siwoo! I’ll do you later too, Arte. How about it?!”\n“Sigh.”\nIt felt like an excuse, but I decided not to ask further.\nIt was roughly convincing, and it was Amelia.\nI had the thought that she wouldn’t do anything strange to Siwoo.\n“Co-come on! It’s late, so let’s go quickly! I prepared a car!”\n“Yeah! L-let’s go quickly!”\n“…Hmm.”\nPushed from behind by the urging of Amelia and Dorothy, I boarded a vehicle that looked expensive at a glance.\nAnd that’s when it really started to hit me.\n…The trip is starting.\nThe Author said there won’t be any fighting on this trip.\nI decided to relax and rest well.\nIt was a vacation after a long time.\nAuthor’s Notes\nMany readers made a fuss, saying they knew it would happen last time.\nIt’s not too late yet!!! They said they haven’t fallen for each other yet. It’s still just an obsession!\nBy the way, I haven’t received any news about the emoticons, even though I worked hard on it. It’s already been a week…?\nNovel-chan… it’s cold… why aren’t you checking my sketches…",

      "content": "“…So?”\n“Huh? What?”\n“How was Arte’s reaction?”\nAmelia asked Siwoo while glancing at Arte.\nHow was it?\nAfter thinking hard about her intention behind the question, he finally realized.\nNo wonder she grabbed Dorothy’s arm and hesitated while getting in the car; she was trying to get him and Arte somehow together.\nShe couldn’t say it inside the car in case Arte heard, so she deliberately brought it up as soon as we entered the department store.\n“… Don’t tell me that’s why you put me and Arte together?”\n“What else would it be for?”\n“Sigh…”\nNo wonder he kept feeling her gaze.\nIt seemed Amelia had started up again, desperate to match him with Arte.\n“Nothing much happened.”\n“Th-that can’t be…?”\n“It’s true. You were watching the whole time too, right?”\n“That’s true, but…”\nShe thought they were having a secret conversation.\nHe was amazed at how Amelia strained her ears for anything.\nIf she was concentrating that much, there’s no way she couldn’t hear it.\nIt wasn’t just a day or two that Amelia kept trying to tie him and Arte together, but deep down, Siwoo wished she would stop soon.\n…Because it felt like far from falling for him, Arte would be against it.\nI’m sure she didn’t think much of it before, even if they were that close.\nWhen Arte sat beside him, he could only fidget anxiously.\n“Can’t be helped. Then we’ll have to move on to the next plan.”\n“…Do I really have to go? Can’t I not go?”\n“You think we spent time dressing you up for nothing? It’ll make what we did today a waste of time.”\n“That’s true, but…”\nSiwoo couldn’t refute her.\nWell, he was forcibly dressed up, but it’s true that he was.\nIt was obvious she would be sad if he gave up without making use of it.\nNo matter how much he says he doesn’t want to, she will be disappointed after hours of diligent preparation.\nEspecially Dorothy excitedly poured out all sorts of knowledge while dressing him up. She seemed to be interested in fashion.\nIf he suddenly disappeared, saying he couldn’t do it, what kind of reaction would she have…?\nThey may have gotten closer, but he already felt guilty doing it to Amelia.\n“But how did you convince Dorothy?”\n“Huh?”\n“Don’t tell me you told Dorothy too? About Arte’s identity.”\nNo matter how he thought about it, it was strange.\nDorothy wouldn’t know anything about Arte’s identity.\nShe was excitedly making a fuss, saying she’d help.\nBut Amelia doesn’t seem like the type to say such a thing easily.\n“Ah, that… When I dodged the question, she accepted it really easily?”\n“Huh?”\n“I said you and Arte aren’t dating, but it seems you have feelings for each other, but things aren’t progressing.”\n“… That’s your wishful thinking, isn’t it?”\n“I just blurted it out in surprise then. But strangely, she accepted it in an instant.”\nSo that’s why… No wonder.\nSiwoo thought she was mercilessly dragged Dorothy into it and felt a bit scared, but there was such a story behind it…\n…He couldn’t comprehend it.\nWhy in the world?\n“Anyway, Dorothy still doesn’t know her identity…”\n“What have you two been talking about for so long?”\n“Ah, Dorothy. Just, well. It’s nothing much.”\n“If it’s nothing, come over here quickly!”\n“…Huh?”\n“Hurry, hurry!”\nDorothy, talking with Arte while walking, ran towards them and dragged Siwoo’s arm.\n“Wh-what is it?”\n“Ah, hurry!”\nHaving no choice, he let himself be dragged.\nDorothy, who ran all the way to the empty corridor, finally let go of my arm.\n“Phew, the gaze was piercing…”\nIt must be referring to Arte’s gaze. Indeed, she was staring intensely.\nHowever, she disappeared after Amelia hurriedly went to distract her.\n“…So, why did you call me?”\n“To ask a favor.”\n“A favor?”\n“You’ll be going to buy swimsuits with us now.”\n“…Sigh.”\n“Wh-what’s with that sigh?”\nNo, what could he say about this?\nHe definitely made up his mind to go. Even considering the sincerity of Dorothy, who dressed him up.\nBut, still.\nEven though he made up his mind, now that it’s about to happen…\n‘I don’t want to go…’\n“…Listen, Dorothy. Do I have to go?”\n“How could you not? We came to buy swimsuits.”\n“About that… I’m a guy, you know? Wouldn’t it be a bit…weird?”\n“…What, were you thinking about that?”\nShe gave Siwoo a disgusted face.\n‘Of course I have to think about that, so what?’\nIf three girls pick out swimsuits at a department store and one guy stands alone, even he would think strange things first.\nJust what kind of guy is mixed in there?\nWhat’s his relationship with the girls?\nWouldn’t a normal person think like that?\n“I’m the only guy, so wouldn’t being in the women’s swimsuit section be weird?”\n“… It’s fine. Amelia and I don’t see you as a man anyway.”\n“Somehow that hurts more? Are you saying that intentionally?”\n“I have no desire to touch someone who already has an owner.”\nAn owner, she says.\n‘Just what kind of relationship are Arte and I in Dorothy’s mind?’\nJust what did Amelia fill her head with?\nSiwoo wanted to ask but didn’t want to know the answer.\nBecause it seemed like he would hear an even stranger story.\n“…No, that’s not it. You just have to compliment Arte when she’s wearing a swimsuit. Got it?”\n“O-okay…”\n“You must. And keep your eyes on Arte, not us. Alright?”\nAs soon as she finished talking, Dorothy ran back in a hurry.\nAmelia has done something again.\nThe number of people who want to meddle in his relationship with Arte has increased.\n***\n“Wow, it’s pretty. How is it?”\n“It’s not bad. But the exposure is a bit too much…?”\n“Ehh, it’s a swimsuit, who cares. It’s not like you have much flab. Let’s see.”\n“Wh-why are you suddenly touching my belly?!”\n“No, I thought your belly might be sticking out…”\n“That’s rude, you know?!”\nAmelia and Dorothy were making a fuss.\nNot having the courage to look in front of me, I kept my eyes tightly closed. Since I couldn’t see, it only made their chatter louder.\n“Arte, aren’t you going to pick one?”\nPerhaps because I was just sitting quietly.\nAmelia asked in a puzzled voice.\n“Ye-yes…? Ah, I don’t really know much about this stuff…”\n“Really? Then should we pick for you?”\n“Please do.”\n“Okay, leave it to us!”\nFortunately, Amelia and Dorothy didn’t notice that I had my eyes closed.\nSometimes, having narrow eyes comes in handy, I suppose.\nBecause it’s hard to tell if my eyes are open or not.\nI had asked the Author before.\nJust why did you put me in this kind of body?\nThe answer was very simple… Because it’s cool.\nIf she says so, then so be it!\n“…Here, Arte! How about this one? Do you like it?”\n“Ah, yes. Thank you. I like it.”\n“Try it on quickly! Hurry!”\nI rushed into the fitting room at Amelia’s urging.\nPhew, that was close.\nPerhaps because I’d never been to a women’s swimsuit shop before, I didn’t know where to look and was having a hard time with my eyes closed.\nFortunately, it seemed Amelia decided to pick out a swimsuit for me.\n“I’m going to resent you, Author…”\n[But swimsuit fashion shows appear often, don’t they?]\n“Shut up.”\nI know there are novels among web novels heavily influenced by light novels that have this kind of happenstance. (TN: Suggested by my friend, blame them…)\nAnd I knew the Author wanted to use that kind of material.\nSo that’s why I suggested we should go pick out swimsuits.\nIt was good that I guided things that way since she wanted to use that material. It was good, but…\nIf there’s one thing I overlooked, it’s that I have to buy a swimsuit too.\n“Can’t be helped. I’ll quickly put it on and… Huh?”\n[…Wow. A bikini.]\n“…”\nWhat is this?\nI tried to put it on and get out as quickly as possible, but the size of the piece of cloth in my hand was small.\nRight, people call it a bikini.\nWhen I received it and held it, I was sure there was a lot of cloth touching my hand, so I thought it would be a rashguard or high-leg style, but I was fooled…!\nIt’s not just a bikini.\nAs if telling me what that cloth I felt was, a pareo that could be put around the waist was asserting its presence.\nIt’s not that there’s no top, either. It was prepared to be worn over the bikini.\nIt would have been nice if it had just covered up to below the chest instead of exposing the belly button.\nThe outerwear top is white, and the pareo is also made of a see-through material, so it doesn’t cover anything at all.\n…Then what’s the point of having a top and pareo?\n“Arte, are you done?”\n“… I-I’ll be out soon.”\nAh, dammit.\nDo I really have to wear this? Seriously?\nAmelia must have been considerate in her own way.\nI was the only one wearing the school swimsuit during swimming class when everyone was wearing bikinis.\n…But if you were going to be considerate, I wish you had done a bit more.\nNo matter how you look at it, the clothes seem meaningless to wear.\n“Arte?”\n“…Wa-wait a moment. Just a moment.”\n***\n“How does it feel?”\n“I want to leave.”\nSiwoo answered honestly to Amelia’s question.\nHe wanted to leave.\n‘Why am I in a place like this?’\nJust being surrounded by women’s swimsuits was embarrassing beyond words.\n“Okay, I’ll let you go.”\n“Really?!”\n“Yeah. If you just look at Arte and give your impressions.”\n“Huh?”\n“She’ll be out soon. Wait.”\nThat’s when he realized.\nHe could hear Amelia and Dorothy’s voices but not Arte’s.\nHe tried his best not to be conscious of the swimsuits because they were embarrassing, so she didn’t notice other things.\nSwish, swish.\nHis closed senses expanded in an instant.\n…Did they say Arte was in there?\nHis annoyingly good hearing and intuition vividly conveyed the sound of Arte changing clothes.\nAuthor’s Notes\nThe emoticons are done.",

      "content": "The sound of fabric brushing against fabric drifted into Siwoo’s ears.\nIt should have been drowned out by the music echoing through the department store and the chatter of Amelia and Dorothy.\n…Yet, thanks to his unnecessarily good hearing and abilities, he kept hearing it.\nIt’s not a strange sound.\nJust the sound of fabric rubbing against fabric. That’s all.\nYet, it was stimulating his imagination.\n“What kind of swimsuit it is…”\n“I won’t tell you beforehand because your reaction might seem awkward.”\n“But you must compliment her no matter what, okay?”\nHe had hoped for a small hint, but it was useless.\nBecause the two wanted his raw reaction, his curiosity about what kind of swimsuit it was only amplified.\nAt this point, the option to run away without checking no longer existed.\n… It’s probably a school swimsuit, right? Arte usually wears a leotard, too. For her, wearing a leotard as underwear would be more comfortable.\nNo, maybe it’s a bikini aiming for that gap.\nBut Arte would have picked it out herself. Amelia or Dorothy might, but I don’t think Arte would have chosen it.\nSiwoo concluded it would be a competitive swimsuit similar to what she usually wears, but his imagination was already running wild.\nThe image of Arte changing clothes was gradually emerging inside that fitting room that he couldn’t see with his eyes.\nHe wanted to stop thinking about it, but it wouldn’t stop at all.\nThat soft sensation and scent I felt before…\n“Aaaargh!”\n“What are you doing?”\n“…Leave me alone.”\nHe banged his head against the wall in self-loathing.\nTo think he’s having such perverted thoughts about an acquaintance.\n‘Okay, calm down. Siwoo.’\nPeople tend to pick clothes they usually enjoy wearing.\nHe’s seen her in a leotard plenty, so the damage will be minimal.\nSo it shouldn’t be a problem…\n“How is it?”\n“Wow, it’s pretty!”\nWhile he was cooling off with his head against the wall, Arte seemed to emerge from the fitting room.\nAmelia and Dorothy made a fuss, saying she looked pretty.\n“Ah, haha… E-Even if I’m pretty, not to that extent…”\n“No, you really do look pretty? I like how it gives a different vibe from usual.”\n“R-Really…”\n“Yeah, my eye was right after all. Changing the image slightly differently from usual makes such a difference, right?”\n…The image is different?\nAt that moment, Siwoo realized.\nArte wasn’t wearing it like a leotard as she usually does.\n“Siwoo? Why don’t you say something, too? I know you’re embarrassed, but.”\n“Ah, I got it…”\nAt Amelia’s urging, he had no choice but to turn my head and look.\n…And then he turned back to the wall.\n“…?”\n“Hey, hey?!”\nHis head grew hot. It was so different from what he had imagined.\nHe was prepared to face a leotard or something with minimal exposure.\nHe thought he stood a chance due to his tolerance being built up.\n…But for some reason, Arte was wearing a bikini.\nWith a pareo wrapped around and a white crop top on.\nThey were clothes that covered her body, but that made it even more suggestive.\nBecause they couldn’t hide the black bikini that should have been covered.\nHe couldn’t look anymore, feeling the betrayal of secretly looking at something he shouldn’t.\n“It, it… looks pretty, Arte…”\n“Thank you.”\nThe compliment that left his mouth absurdly lacking in strength, and he even knew it.\nIf it were a compliment he received, he would have thought it was empty words.\nBut this was the best compliment he could give.\nThe result of restraining himself as much as possible, feeling like he’d blurt out nonsense if he kept looking.\nHe couldn’t face her directly, but he felt Arte was smiling.\n***\n“Well then, see you on Monday!”\n“See you next time!”\nI waved back at Amelia and Dorothy, waving from inside the car.\nThe car gradually left my sight and soon disappeared, so I lowered my waving hand and sighed.\n“Sigh…”\n“Sigh…”\nAt the same time, I heard a sighing sound next to me.\nSiwoo was beside me.\n“Was it so boring that you’re sighing?”\n“No, that’s not it… I’ve just never shopped for this long before. It’s a bit tiring.”\nI smiled faintly at his words.\nBecause the reason was no different from mine.\n“Same for me. This is the first time I’ve wandered around this long to buy something.”\n“…Really?”\n“Yes.”\nBecause before, I roughly picked up what caught my eye or chose comfortable things.\nMaybe that’s why? It felt like I was half being dragged around by Amelia and Dorothy.\nIt was the same for Siwoo.\nThat’s probably why he sighed like me.\n“…But still, wasn’t it a good experience?”\n“Huh?”\n“I told you before, didn’t I? You saw the swimsuits, right? How was it?”\nWe didn’t only buy swimsuits, but if I had to pick the most memorable event, it would definitely be that.\nAmelia and Dorothy excitedly tried on various swimsuits, which was almost like a fashion show.\nThanks to that, I also had a feast for my eyes. As expected of heroines, I thought they could be models.\n“…Yeah, it was pretty.”\n“That’s a relief!”\nMe? I didn’t really try on many. I had no desire to be involved in that.\nThe two of them eagerly tried to persuade me at first, but when they noticed I had no interest, they backed off as if they had no choice.\nAfter unknowingly wearing something strange the first time I changed, I had absolutely no desire to do more.\nThe goal was a swimsuit fashion show for the heroines anyway, so it was a success, right?\nThere’s no need for me to try more.\nAs expected of the protagonist? He complimented everyone as pretty.\nHis attention must have been focused on Amelia and Dorothy, but he still complimented me.\nThe way he was considerate so I wouldn’t be hurt seemed protagonist-like.\nHe’s really kind. Is it because he’s the protagonist or because he’s human?\nI’m not sure. Whatever the reason, I had to protect him.\nSo, let’s part ways here for a bit.\n“Ah, I’ll be going now…”\n“…Huh? The intersection is further down, though?”\n“That’s not it, but I forgot I have something to take care of for a bit!”\n“Okay. See you next time.”\nI made an excuse to Siwoo that I had something to do, returned the way we came, and stood still.\nOriginally, I planned to go home together and keep a close eye on him, but an unexpected variable came up.\nAfter waiting in the alley, I saw a woman hastily walking over.\nHurried footsteps as if urgently chasing something.\n…How careless.\nUsing a single half-glove, I restrained this suspicious woman’s entire body.\nPerfectly, without a single gap, like a spider wrapping its prey caught in a web.\n“Eek?!”\n“Talk. Who are you? Where did you come from? What’s your goal?”\nShe had been bothering me for a while.\nThis woman had been following us the whole time since the department store.\nI let her be even though it was a bit concerning inside the department store. Still, after seeing her take a taxi to follow us, I was certain.\nThis woman, there’s something about her.\nWhy? Who was she following? Me? Or Siwoo?\nThere’s no way I was the target.\nIf so, would she have tried to pass by, pretending not to notice when I was here? No way.\nThe target is Siwoo. I’m sure of it.\nThen why on earth?\nCould a villain organization the Author didn’t set up be targeting Siwoo?\nBecause he’s in danger? Or to persuade him?\nEither way, I can’t allow it.\nAbsolutely not. Even if I have to die trying.\n“P-Please, s-spare me! I-I’m a citizen! I’m not a villain!”\n“Shut up, puppet. There’s no one here who will come to save you. If you scream one more time, I’ll slice that neck of yours.”\n“Eek…”\nI don’t know for certain. Whether there really are people here or not.\nBut that’s not what’s important.\nI need to find out why this woman is following Siwoo. That’s it.\nNothing else mattered.\nI slightly tightened the thread I tied to give her a cut, and she seemed to realize I was serious.\nShe became cooperative.\n“Why were you following?”\n“T-That’s…”\n“…”\n“Eek! I-I’ll talk…! B-Because he was cool! I did it because he was cool…!”\nBecause he was cool?\nI had no idea what she was talking about.\nIs it some code used by villain organizations?\nI tightened the thread restraining her a bit more, meaning for her to explain in detail.\n“Ugh, urk…! A-At the department store…! I-I fell for that man at, at first sight…! I’m sorry! I-I won’t bother him again!”\n“Fell for him at first sight?”\n“Y-Yes, yes! Yes! There’s nothing else!”\n…I see.\nIt didn’t seem like she was lying.\nHer frightened expression, the thread digging into her much easier than a superhuman.\nShe’s not a superhuman.\nThen, is this woman saying she really followed Siwoo here after falling for him at first sight?\n…So, she was stalking him. Is that it?\n“I can’t forgive you.”\n“Eek…!”\n“How dare a puppet as common as dirt…!”\nShe’s not even an extra.\nJust a mere background existence daring to target one of only two humans in the world.\nIt was unthinkable.\nIt shouldn’t happen.\n“He’s not someone the likes of you can touch!”\n“Y-Yes, yes! I won’t dare to anymore! P-Please spare me!”\n“How dare, how dare, how dare, how dare, how dare…! A mere extra, not even a heroine!”\nThe audacity of a puppet.\nThe audacity of an extra.\nDaring to overstep her bounds with a human. It’s unacceptable.\nI can tolerate Dorothy and Amelia. I can even tolerate a new heroine that may be added later.\nBut I can’t tolerate someone like this approaching Siwoo.\nWhat should I do? How should I deal with her?\n…Right, there’s a great method, isn’t there?\nSomeone cut the thread.\n“That’s enough, Arte.”\n“…Ah, Investigator.”\n“I’m well aware that woman has done something wrong, but this place is dangerous.”\nWhen I was about to make it so she couldn’t move, Ha-Yul stopped me.\n…Ah.\nThat’s right. This place is dangerous.\nI don’t know this location well besides being near Siwoo’s house. I haven’t even figured out where the CCTVs are.\nI could ask the Author to take care of it, but it would be bothersome.\nIt’s a fun vacation. If a murder case happened near Siwoo’s house, it would surely dampen his mood.\n“This is the only time, puppet. You’re lucky.”\n“S-Spare… Spare me…”\n“…If you try to approach that person again next time, you better come prepared to die.”\nCovered in tears and snot, the stalker following Siwoo violently nodded her head.\n…I didn’t like it.\nThe fact that someone who dared to overstep her bounds with someone she shouldn’t get to live with all limbs intact.\n“Thank you, Investigator.”\n“It’s nothing.”\nAs soon as I untied the thread, the puppet who had been hastily running away tripped over her feet and fell, then got up and started running again.\nSoon disappearing from sight, I thought while looking in the direction the stalker ran away.\nHe’s not someone the likes of you can overstep your bounds with.",

      "content": "“…Have you calmed down?”\n“Thanks to you. Thank you, Investigator.”\n“I told you that you can call me casually.”\n“I’m more comfortable with this.”\nI let out a small sigh.\nI’m glad things didn’t get bothersome.\nAs much as possible, I didn’t want to borrow the Author’s hand for trivial matters.\nThe more her touch is involved, the more it feels like this isn’t an ordinary world, which puts me in a bad mood.\n“…You don’t seem to be feeling well. Shall I handle it?”\n“No need. Warning them this much should keep them from approaching again.”\nAs an investigator, methods like arresting that woman became possible, but I decided not to go that far.\nIf they come again, it’s not too late to deal with it. There was no need to make a big deal now.\n“Hiring you as an investigator was indeed a good choice.”\n“Thank you.”\nI lightly praised Lee Ha-Yul, who prevented things from getting bothersome.\nAfter the fight with Übermensch, I decided to have at least one subordinate accompany me.\n…The annoyingly persistent cat almost ruined everything.\nThat day, I realized it deep in my bones. That I need more people.\nWhat if there had been one more person that day?\nI could have asked for their help or just left it to them and escaped.\nBut there was no one. Even though I had subordinates.\nWell, Arachne is an organization in name only.\nThat’s why I didn’t actively utilize Lyla, Spira, or Lee Ha-Yul.\nRather than subordinates of a secret organization, they were more like maids freeloading at my house.\nI didn’t have any particular use for them, and there weren’t any issues.\nIn the first place, Arachne was an organization I made up to fill in the Author’s mistakes and setting errors, so I didn’t actively engage in organizational activities.\nI never really felt the need for subordinates, either.\n…Until right before I saw Siwoo almost die, that is.\n“How has security been in this area lately?”\n“Very good. It’s been quiet, all thanks to Arachne.”\n“… That’s good.”\nI had been complacent. If I react only after an incident occurs, it’ll be too late by myself.\nIt’s impossible to prepare before an incident happens. The very reason incidents occur is for Siwoo to resolve them.\nGiving the protagonist trials and having them overcome those trials is why the Author desires chaos. Incidents are inevitable.\nThen, rather than preventing incidents from occurring, I needed to reduce the variables.\nIt’s no different from what I’ve been doing so far.\nIt’s just that since I am limited by myself, it’s about time I utilized my idle hands.\nLyla is not suitable. If she fights properly, the area would be destroyed due to her frenzy.\nSpira is the same. It’s too dangerous for her to hide by my side. Her tail draws too much attention.\nLee Ha-Yul, with ample experience in infiltration and abilities suited for covert ops, was the most suitable.\nUnless something special happens, he can help me.\nThe Association didn’t object either. The crimes suppressed by Arachne were far greater than those suppressed by a single elite Investigator.\nWhen villains who lightly committed crimes, thinking they could just go to prison for a bit, started losing their lives one by one to Arachne, the villains began laying low.\nThose already cornered instead began causing bigger incidents and prepared to die, but the other investigators who conserved their energy due to the decreasing number of petty crimes could sufficiently handle that.\n“By the way, Arte. Why are you monitoring him? He’s capable for his age, but not to the extent of surveillance…”\n“Because he’s at the center of incidents.”\n“Pardon?”\n“Incidents will always occur around him. We need to prepare in advance.”\n“Is that… a prophecy?”\nA prophecy… It’s not exactly wrong.\nSince I roughly know what will happen.\nI’m technically a prophet conveying the words of god. Or perhaps the role of a devotee.\nA sect of a god who treats the world like a toy.\nI sound like an evil cult leader.\n“…Yes. Let’s say it’s fate and destiny.”\nThe world was already noisy.\nÜbermensch, Arachne, the destroyed academy.\nEven now, while walking through busy streets, I can hear people talking about the events around the end of term.\nIt was the same today. Everyone was talking about it.\nThat’s how creative works always are.\nThe protagonist must be pushed into an even greater incident to give an even greater stimulus.\nSo the world will get even noisier.\nIt may even be exposed to the threat of world destruction.\nBut I’m not worried.\nBecause this world has a protagonist.\nA being loved by the incomprehensible Author.\nThe only being who walks their own path in this puppet show.\nI’m certain he will save this world one way or another.\nThen, I merely assist him.\nTo prevent the show from ending.\nI can’t escape here either, so I must give my best.\n“…Sigh.”\nIf the world shatters and falls into chaos, that can’t be helped, but it mustn’t burn to the brink of destruction.\nSince I may end up living here my whole life.\nToday again, I watch over Siwoo.\nFor the world and for myself.\n***\n“Mir, Mir… You really died.”\nIt feels like time has stopped.\nHow many days has Annie spent just crying?\nIf not for this sturdy superhuman body, she may have died by now.\n…Though it seems like enduring with just this superhuman body is reaching its limit.\n“I can’t believe it, Mir. In an instant, in a single moment, you…”\nShe hugged a head with the brilliant horn.\nThere was no response.\nMir would sigh as if bothered and push her away, then pet her head as if nothing happened.\nBut there was no longer a hand that would reach out.\n…Annie knows. Villains can always die at any moment. Life was something that could be snuffed out with ease.\nShe knew. She knew, but dying right on the doorstep of her goal…\nThat’s too cruel.\n“What is this trivial thing, for Mir to…! What the hell is mixing genes going to do for–”\nWait.\nShe stopped short of throwing the orb she previously held with care onto the floor in disgust.\n…Mix genes?\nAnnie suddenly looked at Mir’s horn.\nMir was also human… But she wasn’t purely one.\nThe genes of another race.\n“If I use this…”\nShe could become one with Mir.\n‘She didn’t die. She’s with me.’\nMir always said it. That she wants an equal society.\nThat’s why she didn’t appoint herself as the Boss and remained an executive with everyone else.\nThat’s why she was the first to use the completed elixir, even though there could be unknown side effects.\nAnnie fell for her when she saw that. She vowed to be with her for life. She pledged her loyalty.\nIt was time to keep that vow.\n“…Mir. I will achieve your dream.”\nIf one had to pick the most unusual one out of the Chinese Zodiac, it would undoubtedly be the dragon.\nWell, because dragons are a creature that doesn’t exist.\nThe other executives are all animals that exist in reality, but not dragons.\n…Then, why did Mir call herself a dragon?\nHow did she alone boast such overwhelming power?\nThe answer is simple.\nBecause only she could accept a factor that others couldn’t.\nBecause everyone else couldn’t endure it and died.\nThat’s why she’s special. That’s why the elixir was incomplete.\n“Normally, I wouldn’t be able to accept it… But if I mix… it will surely be possible.”\nShe didn’t know how to use the orb.\nBut her body moved in unison.\nAnnie swallowed the orb.\n“Urk, ulp… Ugh…”\nThe terrible sensation of a foreign object filling her stomach.\nShe forcibly swallowed the crucible, and after some time passed, she noticed.\n‘…I can smell better.’\nShe felt pain all over my body, but she didn’t care. It was nothing compared to the past few days.\nThe scent of dirt, the smell of sweat, and even the stench coming from Mir’s corpse.\nHer senses instantly expanded, and she felt they became much stronger.\n“With this…! With this, it’s possible…!”\nThe crucible’s function and usage seeped into my head as if melting.\nIf it’s this power, it’s possible.\nMir was right.\nI can achieve Mir’s dream.\nA world where everyone is equal and can have mana.\nI could make it happen.\nI could do it.\nAnnie turned my head to look at Mir.\n“Mir, you were never wrong. With this power, I can make everyone equal.”\nShe preciously stroked the decapitated head.\nShe tore off the brilliantly shining jade horn and brought it to her mouth.\nMir endured the genes all by herself.\nThe genes of a magical beast.\n“If I’m with you, I can do it too, Mir.”\n***\n“Ca, calm down… Siwoo…”\nSiwoo couldn’t rest well at home. The reason was simple.\nHe had accidentally brought the thread he picked up during the 2v2 tournament home and left it there, and today, it caught his eye.\n“I need to throw it out… Need to throw it out…”\nSuddenly, the bikini Arte wore today came to mind.\n…The bikini was also black.\nAmong the colorful threads, the black thread particularly stood out.\n“Aaaaah!”\nSiwoo ran out to the front yard.\nAt this rate, it seemed he wouldn’t be able to sleep.\nHe couldn’t throw it out, either. If he touched it, he knew strange thoughts would come to mind.\nSiwoo was caught in limbo.\nAuthor’s Notes\nI wish I could have Arte’s threads too…",

      "content": "“Hey, Amelia.”\n“Yeah?”\nThe promised day. The day to head to the sea had arrived.\nOn the way to Arte’s house.\nUnable to endure the boredom, Dorothy fell asleep.\nTaking this chance, Siwoo spoke to Amelia, who was sitting comfortably.\nHe had more than a couple of things he wanted to ask her, who was grinning from ear to ear.\nThat huge pile of luggage was one thing, but her joy made him anxious.\nWhenever Amelia was happy, strange events always occurred.\nHowever, more than that, he wanted answers to the questions that suddenly came to mind.\n“Why is Arte going on a trip with us?”\n“…What are you talking about all of a sudden?”\nAmelia narrowed her eyes and looked at Siwoo as if asking what nonsense he was spouting.\n…Was it too out of the blue? No, but what can he do when it comes to mind?\n“Wasn’t Arte’s goal to steal the artifact in the secret room?”\n“Ah… Was it…? I think it was, but…?”\n‘Did you forget?’\nFinding it absurd, it was Siwoo’s turn to stare intently at Amelia.\nShe must have found it absurd as she smiled and tried to brush off the topic.\n“Th-That’s right! So? What about it?”\n“…Sigh.”\nShould he let it slide this time?\nIt seems like she remembered, even if belatedly.\nNow, a more important question had to be asked.\n“No, hasn’t the goal already been achieved? Can’t she drop out now?”\n“What?”\n“Didn’t you mention before? The secret room was exposed, and they decided to rebuild the academy completely.”\n“Huh? What?”\n“Then haven’t the artifacts already been brought out? Have you heard anything about what was in the secret room?”\n“…No, I haven’t.”\nRight, that’s how it was.\nThere was no need for Arte to stay in school.\nThe night before the trip, those thoughts suddenly crossed his mind.\nArte is a member of Arachne. Her purpose for infiltrating the school was to find the artifacts inside the secret room.\nI’m not sure if she wanted them for herself or just wanted to bring them out… But one thing was certain.\nArte’s objective now lies outside the academy.\nHe was about to say those words out loud but swallowed them back down along with his saliva.\n…He was afraid that if he said that, Arte would suddenly disappear.\nAt first, he was scared, and even now, he had no idea what she was thinking.\nBut Arte was a friend now.\nEven if she entered the academy with an ulterior motive, the fact that they became friends doesn’t change.\nA friend who helps when times are tough and sets you straight when you stray.\nBut if she stops coming to the academy…\n“You were speaking so seriously that I thought it was something else. Of course, there’s a reason for her to stay.”\n“…There is?”\n“Yes, there is. You’re at the academy, aren’t you?”\n“I’m being serious right now…!”\n“Listen well, Siwoo.”\nUnlike earlier, Amelia spoke with the playfulness gone from her smile.\n“I know what you’re worried about, too. You’re worried about Arte, aren’t you?”\n“…Yeah.”\nSiwoo was worried about Arte.\nHe didn’t know why, but Arte’s mental state was unstable.\nSiwoo had briefly glimpsed Arte’s inner thoughts inside that Ferris wheel.\nThe image of her speaking incomprehensible things about dolls and puppet shows came to mind.\nThat highly unstable appearance.\nThat momentary change in her demeanor, as if she had suffered a setback, was probably her true self.\nEven if she always appears composed and belongs to a secret organization, she is still human.\nShe can’t always be strong.\nWhen times are tough, someone needs to help her.\n“I don’t really know what you saw or why you’re worried about Arte. And it doesn’t seem like you’ll tell me.”\n“About that… I’m sorry.”\n“It’s fine. There’s nothing more unsightly than hearing about someone’s weaknesses from another person’s mouth.”\nShe might have given better advice if he had told Amelia that he had seen Arte’s vulnerable side.\nBut he didn’t say it.\nBecause that’s something between Arte and Siwoo.\n“But you’re worrying for nothing. We just need to give Arte a reason to stay with us.”\n“We? You again…”\n“Even if it’s not love, just being friends is enough. Not wanting to be apart from us. If she develops those feelings, that’s good enough.”\n‘Are you going on about love again? I’m being serious right now.’\nAmelia’s words left him unable to say it.\nBecause her response was more serious than he had expected.\n“…Is that so.”\n“Yeah, so get rid of those unnecessary thoughts and get ready. We’re almost there. As for Dorothy… Well, it’s fine to let her sleep.”\nAmelia ended the conversation and looked out the window.\nA large country house.\nIt wasn’t as big as Amelia’s house, which they had seen on the way here, but it was quite large.\nSo this is Arte’s house.\nAfter ringing the doorbell and waiting for a moment, someone quickly came out.\n“Yes, who is it?”\n“…Amelia, subjugate her!”\n“Got it.”\n“Eek?! Wh-What is it! Th-Thief?! Master! Help me!?”\nOf course, they thought Arte would come out, but Siwoo was puzzled by the unfamiliar voice.\n…However, the moment they saw the person who opened the door.\nAmelia and Siwoo swiftly subdued the villain who came out of the house.\n“…Why is this woman at Arte’s house?! Could it be!”\n“I heard a few remnants had escaped…”\nA woman with a snake’s tail instead of legs.\nNo doubt about it. She’s a remnant of Übermensch.\nWhy is she here?\nThis is Arte’s house. They only found out the address recently.\nSiwoo didn’t think Arte would easily leak her home address to others.\nThen there’s only one answer.\nRevenge.\n“Urk, ugh. Kuh.”\n“You, what did you do to Arte? Talk!”\n“Kuh, kuh… Th-Throat, please… Y-You’re telling me to talk, but my th-throat… I’ll talk, so th-throat…!”\n“… What’s the commotion?”\n“Arte?! You’re safe?!”\nWhat?\nHe lifted his head while still restraining the struggling villain.\nArte was looking at us unharmed, unlike what he imagined.\n“Th-Thank goodness! You’re safe!”\n“Of course I am. It’s my house, after all.”\nArte sighed in exasperation and spoke.\n“What is happening here though?”\n“It’s a remnant of Übermensch! Be careful, Arte. Your address…”\n“… She’s my maid.”\n“What?”\n“Kuh, kuh… L-Let go, please. I-I was wrong…”\nAt Arte’s words, the strength in his hand pressing on the snake demi-human’s throat loosened.\nHe looked at the villain, who was coughing incessantly and steadying herself. As Arte said, she was indeed wearing a maid uniform.\n…Huh? Is she really a maid?\n“M-Maid? But she’s a villain?”\n“Ah. Well, you see… She left the villain organization and came to me saying she couldn’t survive. Right?”\nArte sought agreement from the maid.\nThen the maid hastily nodded, stroking her throat with a tearful expression.\n“Y-Yes, yes! O-Of course! Thanks to you, Master, I’m happy!”\n“…”\nNo matter how he looks at it, it’s suspicious.\nLike it was made up on the spot.\nThat maid’s reaction also seemed like an overreaction.\n“By the way, where’s Dorothy? Are we going to Dorothy’s place now?”\n“No, you’re the last one. Dorothy is sleeping.”\n“Aha… Have you eaten yet? The timing seems a bit awkward.”\n“No, not yet.”\n“Then it works out well. Shall we bring her too? Since you’ve come here, let’s have a meal before you go.”\nNo matter how he looked at it, she seemed to be trying to change the subject.\nWhy would Übermensch, who hates villains, spare a remnant of Übermensch and employ her as a maid?\nThere were several questions, but he decided not to ask.\nArte probably wouldn’t answer anyway.\n“…Alright, I’ll leave it to you.”\nIn a different way than they expected, the three entered Arte’s house for the first time.\n***\n“…Hide yourself.”\nI whispered softly into the air.\nIt was close to me mouthing it, but Lyla should hear it.\nShe has four ears, after all.\nIrritation surged within me.\nYou’re the one who knows best that your lower body is a snake, so why did you go outside and create trouble?\nYou should have just stayed still.\nI made up a random story to change the subject, and now I must serve them something.\nShould I punish her later? I should make her drink snake alcohol.\n“Yawn…”\n“It’s smaller than I thought?”\n“…Small? This?”\nAmelia and Siwoo were commenting on the house, and Dorothy was walking unsteadily in a half-asleep state.\n[…Small?! That’s unacceptable! Reader-nim, let’s move!]\nMove? No way.\nThis is big enough already.\nWhat would other houses be like if a country house with a swimming pool were small?\nAmelia is being weird, just like a rich young lady.\n“Do you like steak?”\n“I absolutely love it!”\n“…Well, I don’t dislike it.”\nAs for Dorothy… Well, she’s nodding off, so even if I ask, I probably won’t get a proper answer.\nShall I show off my skills after a long time?\n“Then please wait.

      "content": "Just Because I Have Narrow Eyes Doesn’t Make Me a Villain! - Chapter 73\n“…Hey, Amelia.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Do you… remember that thing?”\n“…All too well.”\nAn appetizing steak was placed in front of them.\nThe aroma and appearance that stimulated the appetite seemed to say it would be delicious.\nBut here’s the thing.\nWhy did Arte have to cut it into cubes…?\n“Please eat. I hope you enjoy it!”\n“…Yeah, well. Thanks.”\nShe said with a smile.\nSiwoo wondered what on earth she was thinking with that smile.\n“Are you not eating?”\n“H-Hick. I-I’ll eat it… It’s d-delicious. Ehehe…”\nIt bothered him so much he couldn’t stand it.\nHe thought it was just them, but that wasn’t the case.\nHe turned to the maid, who had been banging her head on the ground until just now, revealing a reddened forehead.\nShe also seemed reluctant to eat the steak, but when Arte asked her a question, she forced a smile and started eating.\nSo she knows.\nWell, she said she was from Übermensch. She would know about that incident. Maybe even better than him.\n“Hmm…”\nHe hasn’t actually seen it in person.\nEven so, he couldn’t help but be bothered by it.\nCube steak served by Arte.\nHe knows it’s not, but…\n“…Ah, it’s delicious.”\n“Right? I’m confident in my steak.”\nAmelia had already taken a bite and started eating with a lighter expression.\nNaturally, it was as if it was just delicious meat.\n“Why did you have to cut it?”\n“It’s inconvenient to eat it uncut, no? If you cut it beforehand, all you have to do is eat.”\n“Hmm…”\nAll you have to do is eat if it’s cut.\nSaying that, Arte brought two more plates of steak from the kitchen but, as if realizing something, took them back to the kitchen.\n“Huh? There are two extra?”\n“Ah. This is… I made too much.”\n“You make mistakes?”\n“I’m human too, you know.”\nWatching Amelia and Arte laugh together, Siwoo mustered the courage to bring a piece to his mouth.\n“… It’s delicious.”\n“I’m glad to hear that.”\nWhen he unintentionally made a comment, Arte, who had been talking with Amelia, addressed him.\n“Would you like more?”\n“No, this is enough. Thank you.”\nThe cube steak he was hesitant to eat because of her background turned out to be delicious when he tried it.\nThinking that way, he felt like it became easier to treat Arte.\nLike this cube steak, she just has a slightly scary background.\nBut inside, she’s probably just an ordinary person.\nThat’s what Siwoo thought.\n“Phew. I’m full.”\n“Ah, for cleaning up…”\n“It’s okay. Our maid will take care of it. Right?”\n“Y-Yes, yes! Leave it to me! I’ll do anything!”\nAt the end of the meal, which was awkward at first but became lively later, Arte whispered something to the maid.\n“Hide them…”\nHe couldn’t hear it clearly, but…\nAlcohol*? Why is she suddenly talking about alcohol?\nHe saw the maid’s face turn pale.\nHe didn’t get it. Is it some kind of code?\n“Miss Dorothy didn’t eat much, did she?”\n“Ah, I didn’t have an appetite. Sorry.”\nAt Arte’s words, he looked at Dorothy’s plate.\n… It’s true. She didn’t eat a single piece.\nShe only picked at the vegetables used as garnish but didn’t touch the meat.\nIs she feeling unwell?\nBut she didn’t show any signs of that.\n“No, it’s fine. Spira? Please take care of this, too.”\n“Leave it to me…”\nWith a dejected look, the maid started clearing the table.\nShe looked like a dejected puppy that had been scolded a lot.\nEven though she’s a snake.\n“Well, now that we’ve filled our stomachs, shall we go?”\n“Yeah, let’s go. To the sea!”\n…Well, it’s not something for me to worry about.\nHe could understand to some extent why Arte scolded her.\nThey left her house and got in the car.\nIt was time to go to the sea.\n***\n[It’s summer! It’s the sea!]**\n“…Where did you learn that from again?”\n[Hehe, I just wanted to shout it out once!]\nI couldn’t stop sighing at the Author’s immature behavior.\nYeah, I was wondering why she has been so quiet lately. So that’s why.\nIt was nice and quiet for a while… I decided to ask her what I wanted to ask.\n“Why have you been so quiet lately?”\n[I was thinking about the progression for a bit.]\n“…Progression?”\n[Something different from what I had planned came up, but I think it’s good like this too.]\n“Ah, yes… Are you going to tell me…?”\n[It’s no fun if I tell you!]\nI didn’t expect it anyway.\nThe Author seemed to avoid spoilers because it’s no fun if told.\n…I do feel like there’s no reason not to tell me though.\n“Arte, what are you doing there?”\n“Ah. That’s…”\n“Come quickly! We came to the sea to enjoy ourselves!”\n“Yes… Right. We should enjoy ourselves…”\nAmelia ran out onto the sandy beach, looking excited.\nA sandy beach with not a single person.\nNo one was there even during this holiday season because it was Amelia’s private property.\nThat’s why I had less resistance to swimsuit exposure. There are fewer people to show it to.\nBut, but…\nI had no desire to come out of the changing room at all.\nNo matter how I think about it, this outfit… seems a bit, you know.\n“Why did this have to happen…”\n[That’s because you didn’t try more swimsuits, right?]\n“Be quiet…”\n[Did I say anything wrong? It’s your own mistake.]\nYeah, it’s not wrong. It’s my fault.\nThat’s why I wanted to blame someone else even more.\nWhen Amelia and Dorothy were excitedly picking out a bunch of swimsuits at the department store, I didn’t try more.\nI didn’t feel like changing into more and was worried about the stalker, too.\nWas it because all my attention was focused on the stalker rather than something like swimsuits?\nI had made a grave mistake.\n…I didn’t buy a swimsuit.\nWhy is this a mistake, you ask? It’s simple.\nThe only swimsuit I tried on at the department store was the first one, so what would they buy?\nWas it a mistake that I was too lazy to take it out even after receiving the swimsuit?\nI was about to pay the price for my complacency.\n“Sigh…”\nI looked at the scrap of cloth in my hand.\n…Do I really have to wear this?\nCan’t I just go in my leotard?\nI think that’s a good idea!\nYeah, let’s do that. The leotard is black too, so it won’t be see-through even if it gets wet.\nHowever, my perfect plan was instantly shattered by the Author’s words.\n[…Are you perhaps planning to go in your leotard?]\n“What?”\n[I trust you wouldn’t go in wearing your underwear.]\n“Ah, ahaha… Of course not…”\nDammit.\nI don’t know why she’s so quick-witted only at times like this.\nThere was no more room to escape.\n…Do I really have no choice but to wear this bikini?\nIf there’s anything I can take solace in, it’s not the worst, I guess.\nAlthough it’s a top that becomes see-through when worn, at least there is a top, and the pareo, while nearly transparent, does cover a little bit.\nIt’s better than nothing, right?\n[Why are you hesitating so much? It’s pretty.]\n“No, I was originally a man too, so a bikini is a bit…”\n[Then just wear it like a man for once! Don’t act like a little girl if you were originally a man! It’s not like you wear it every day, so why are you like this? It’s not like your manliness will wear off.]\n“…”\nWhat is this feeling?\nThis feeling of being nagged by someone who you normally nag.\nI wanted to refute so many things, but why did I feel it would be fruitless.\n“I’ll wear it. I just have to wear it, right!”\n[Wow! So manly! As expected of you! A true man!]\nAre you making fun of me?\nCalling someone who is going to wear a bikini a true man.\nMy insides were boiling.\nI guess I’m getting back all my karma.\nSighing, I entered the changing room.\nJust you wait. I’ll definitely get back at you someday.\n***\n“Arte is late.”\n“She’s probably changing.”\n“Really?”\n“Yeah. She went into the changing room.”\nNo matter what, she’s taking too long.\nDid something happen to Arte?\nAs Siwoo kept unintentionally looking back with that thought, Amelia’s hand touched his arm.\n“…What are you doing?”\n“No, your body is better than I thought.”\n“All the other students are like me, you know? We have to be at least this fit to be aspiring heroes.”\n“That’s true, but it’s different when I can touch it… Wow, it’s firm.”\n‘Even though you see it every day during swimming class…’\nAmelia started touching his body all over, saying it was amazing.\n“… That’s right. It really is amazing.”\n“…Dorothy, not you too.”\n“It’s amazing, isn’t it! It’s really firm.”\n… It’s hot.\nSiwoo gently pushed them away.\nThe touch that had somehow moved from his arm to his chest was ticklish, and it felt humid, staying close together because it was summer.\nAnd that’s when it happened.\nA sharp voice came from behind.\n“P-Pervert…!”\n“Ah, Arte. You’re here?”\n“Wh-What are you doing right now?!”\n“Huh?”\nThe three were startled.\n…Doing what? What?\n“E-Even if it’s a place with no people, to do th-that…! To do that kind of thing outdoors…!”\nThat kind of thing?\nNot understanding what Arte was talking about, he tried to imagine.\nHow we would look from a bit of a distance.\nTwo women clinging to a man and touching his chest.\nYou wouldn’t be able to see their hands from behind, so…\n“Ah, Arte! It’s not like that! We were just…”\nSiwoo tried to make an excuse, but his mouth shut briefly.\nBecause Arte was standing there, just like he saw her at the department store.\nA huge disaster will occur if he loses composure while wearing only a swimsuit.\nBecause that kind of situation absolutely must not happen.\n“… It’s not like that, you say?”\nHe came to his senses at Arte’s words.\nThere was no time to admire her appearance.\nFirst, he had to make an excuse somehow…!\n“You guys say something too!”\nIt would be quickly resolved if Dorothy and Amelia helped.\nIf they just say one thing!\nBut Dorothy and Amelia had already run far away towards the sea at some point.\nAmelia, who heard his voice, turned her head and grinned, giving a thumbs up as if to say good luck.\nThis girl, she ran away on purpose…!\n“Uh, um, that’s…”\nIt took some time to clear up Arte’s misunderstanding.\nAuthor’s Notes\nThere are no refunds for the donations.\nGood readers, please be careful when you do.",

The name is quite close to Author-nim’s name too…\n“So you’re saying it was all a misunderstanding…?”\n“Yes! I’m telling you, that’s what it was!”\n[What on earth were you thinking?]\nSiwoo’s voice filled with a sense of unfairness, and the Author’s snickering voice echoed in my ears.\n…It was all a misunderstanding?\n“The reason you were so close together was…”\n“They kept touching my chest, saying it was amazing, that’s all.”\n“A-And the talk about being f-firm and whatnot…?”\n“Muscles.”\nAh.\nI want to die.\nIt was just a thoughtless, truly thoughtless assumption.\nI swear to the heavens, I’m not a pervert!\n“…Look, Arte.”\n“I-It was Siwoo and Amelia’s…! And Dorothy’s fault!”\n“What?”\n“I did nothing wrong!”\nThat’s right. I did nothing wrong.\nIt was Siwoo’s fault. It was Amelia’s fault. It was Dorothy’s fault.\nI mean, they were wearing swimsuits, you know?\nSiwoo was wearing swim trunks, and Dorothy and Amelia were wearing bikinis.\nOn an empty sandy beach.\nIf one man and two women are in such an exposed state, pressing their bodies close together and talking about firmness and whatnot, huh?\nIsn’t it possible to misunderstand?\n“I, I…!”\nRight. Siwoo is the main character, isn’t he? And Dorothy and Amelia are the heroines?\nSo, it’s okay if I misunderstand a little, right?\nI couldn’t see the position of their hands. Of course I thought it was… that.\nI, I was just startled.\nI mean, even so… Outside?\nEven if there were no people, I was just surprised that they would engage in such an indecent act outside.\nAnd all of that was just a misunderstanding?\nThe image of Siwoo’s perplexed face and Amelia giving a thumbs up to him for some reason as she ran away flashed before my eyes.\n“I did nothing wrong!”\n“Arte?!”\nTrying to hide my flushed face, I ran towards the sea while covering my face.\nIt felt like my whole body was twisting from embarrassment.\n***\n“How was it?”\n“You, you…! Why did you suddenly run away?! I was misunderstood because of you!”\nAs soon as Siwoo cleared up Arte’s misunderstanding, he ran to the sea and protested to Amelia.\nHe almost got misunderstood as a crazy person doing weird things outside.\nHe didn’t care what kind of misunderstanding Amelia had about him but with Arte…\n“I ran away to make her misunderstand.”\n“You, you…!”\n“No, Arte’s face was turning bright red, right? So I thought this was an opportunity.”\n“Opportunity?”\n‘What kind of nonsense is she spouting?’\nHe decided to listen to her excuse quietly.\nIf it doesn’t sound plausible, he won’t forgive her.\nHe’ll torment her somehow, no matter what.\nHe was prepared to put mint chocolate in the coffee Amelia drinks secretly.\n“It seemed like she was having some strange misunderstanding. I was just poking fun, but she was so flustered.”\n“Then you should have cleared up the misunderstanding.”\n“Ha, that’s why you’re still a virgin.”\nAmelia snorted as if his answer was absurd.\nShe was resting her body on a floating tube and fiddling with the sunglasses on her head, which was irritating.\nNo, then what should he have done there?\n“You’re right that the misunderstanding should be cleared up, as you said.”\n“Then I’m right!”\n“And I was right in not helping you there.”\n“…What?”\n“Think about it. It would have been a simple misunderstanding if I helped you clear up the misunderstanding. But if I hadn’t helped you…”\nAmelia grinned and tilted her head.\nBehind her, he could see Arte, still red-faced, repeatedly dunking her face in the seawater.\n“She would have just been enjoying the sea normally. Not getting embarrassed like that.”\n“But what’s the point?”\n“Have you ever seen Arte get that flustered?”\n“…”\n“You haven’t, right? Sometimes, shock therapy is necessary. Now Arte might become more conscious of you, which is more advantageous.”\nHe was wrong.\nOnly after hearing her words did Siwoo realize he had misjudged her.\nHow many times had he been fooled by Amelia’s eloquence?\nBeing captivated by her words, thinking they were correct, and having the actions he took based on that come back to bite him was not just once or twice…!\nIt was already too late.\nHe had already found himself thinking Amelia’s words sounded plausible.\nWell, in reality, Arte had never shown such a flustered reaction before.\nThat look on the Ferris wheel was more like being attacked by trauma rather than flustered, so it was a bit different.\nIt was the first time he saw Arte’s face red with embarrassment and fluster.\n“How is it? A different side of Arte.”\n“…Cute.”\n“Huh?”\nAh, wait. He misspoke.\nAs if hearing an unexpected response, Amelia slightly frowned.\nThen, after thinking for a moment, she soon started giggling.\n“Ah, what? Is that what it was?”\n“Wh-What…”\n“No, it’s nothing. Yeah, well. I guess that can happen too. This is even better. I can scheme without worries now.”\nAmelia laughed as if she had discovered something fun.\nIf others had seen it, they might have fallen for her, saying she was pretty.\nBut he had no such thoughts at all.\nNo matter how pretty she was, he never had such thoughts about Amelia.\nEven if this woman tried to seduce him when they were alone, there was no way he would fall for it.\n‘It’s Amelia we’re talking about.’\n“What are you scheming again…”\n“That’s, well… Go with the flow? Don’t worry. It won’t be anything that harms you.”\nAt that moment, Siwoo prayed despite not being religious.\n‘God. Please don’t let Amelia think anything stupid.’\n***\n[Hmm, is nothing fun like earlier happening?]\n“Author-nim, I was wrong, so please forgive me…”\nEven after a long time, my face felt hot, so I was cooling it with seawater when I heard the Author’s voice again.\nI begged for forgiveness, fearing she might stir up trouble in search of something fun again.\nI just wanted to rest a little now.\nI couldn’t stand the embarrassment of making such a ridiculous misunderstanding…\n[…Hmm, but you know, isn’t the sea a bit awkward with just four people?]\n“What? Awkward?”\n[No, I mean, it’s good that we came to the sea, but there doesn’t seem to be much useful content…]\nThe Author started complaining to me.\n[Playing beach volleyball with four people is a bit boring, and the blonde delinquent can’t seduce the heroine because it’s a private beach…]\n“Do you want to stir up incidents that much, even during a vacation…?”\n[Because that’s what makes it fun!]\nA sigh escaped my lips.\nIt seemed the Author had been pondering possible incidents that could happen at the beach. Still, after finding no notable incidents, she wanted to stir something up.\n“Author-nim, even so, it’s a holiday. Everyone is enjoying themselves.”\nI looked at the others while floating in the sea.\nAmelia was floating on a tube, and Dorothy was taking a short break on a sun bed on the sandy beach.\nSiwoo was talking with Amelia about something.\n“Even if an incident occurs, they must take a break, Author. The main character and heroines won’t be in good condition without it.”\n[Hmm… Is that so…?]\n“Of course.”\n…By the way, this is a bit uncomfortable.\nIt’s nice that my breasts float, making it easy to drift absentmindedly in the sea, but my face feels a bit hot.\n[Then I won’t say much, so put on some sunscreen at least!]\n“What? No, why would I bother with something like that? It’ll all wash off in the water anyway.”\n[I saw you frowning because your face was hot! The sunscreen doesn’t wash off in water, so hurry up and put it on! It’s the body I created!]\n“Sigh…”\nNo, why bother with something so troublesome?\nI’m sure I’ll still look pretty, even if I get a bit tanned.\nBut it seemed the Author didn’t think that way.\nShe started nagging, saying she didn’t want to see the skin of the body she created getting damaged.\n…After a short while, the one who surrendered in the end was me.\n“Sigh… You really won’t stir up any incidents, right?”\n[Yes! Yes! So hurry up and put on sunscreen!]\n“Alright…”\nIt’s not even her body, yet she’s making a fuss.\nIs it some kind of vicarious satisfaction? I really don’t get it.\n“Dorothy, do you have any extra sunscreen?”\n“What?… Don’t tell me you didn’t bring any?”\n“Ah, yes. The sun is stinging a bit.”\n“That’s no good!”\nDorothy, who was startled, hurriedly started rummaging through her bag.\n…Was I too careless?\nTsk, come to think of it, it might be a bit of a waste.\nFlawless skin is indeed precious.\nSeeing everyone panicking and telling me to take care of it, I started to think that even if I didn’t manage it, I shouldn’t ruin it.\n“Here you go.”\n“Thank you. I’ll return what’s left…”\n“No, it’s okay if you use it all. I plan to stop by the villa for a bit because I think I’ll run out of drinks. Do you need anything?”\n“…Then a cola.”\n“Got it.”\nAfter handing me the sunscreen, Dorothy left, saying she was going to the villa.\nThe villa was quite a distance away, so it would take some time.\nIt would be close if she moved her body, but there would be some volume to carry.\n“What, where is Dorothy going?”\n“She said she was going to get some drinks.”\n“Really? It would be much faster if we went. She should have told us.”\nAmelia, floating on a tube in the sea, seemed to have noticed Dorothy leaving the sun bed.\nShe approached me to ask what was happening but soon saw the item in my hand and expressed curiosity.\n“… Isn’t that sunscreen?”\n“Ah, the sun is a bit strong today, so I thought I’d put–”\n“You didn’t put it on since the beginning?! Why?!”\nDid I do something that wrong…?\nWith the three women around me panicking, I felt like I had made a huge mistake.\nI didn’t bother putting it on when I was a man because it was troublesome and sticky.\n“…Aha. I see. So you’re going to put it on now?”\n“…? Yes. That’s what I’m planning to do.”\nAmelia suddenly smiled as if she had realized something and started writing something on a piece of paper on the table next to the sun bed.\n“Hey, that’s…?”\n“Ah, it’s nothing. I’m worried about Dorothy, so I’ll go to the villa for a bit too. I think I need to grab some food as well. It’ll take some time. About an hour?”\n“Sure, well. Have a safe trip…?”\nWhat’s with that specific time?\nAs Amelia left, she said one last thing to me.\n“Don’t forget that you need to apply sunscreen diligently! Since it’s a bikini, you need to pay extra attention to your back.”\n“Got it.”\n“Tell Siwoo to read that memo when he comes!”\nI thought she could just tell him directly, but I nodded without further inquiry.\nWell, I’m sure she has her reasons.\nAuthor’s Notes\nWe got some fanart that children shouldn’t see.\nYou can check it out in the announcements.\nThank you all as always.",

      "content": "Just Because I Have Narrow Eyes Doesn’t Make Me a Villain! - Chapter 75\n“…Ugh, it’s sticky.”\nAfter wiping off the moisture on my body, I squeezed an appropriate amount of sunscreen and rubbed it on my hands.\nI felt an unpleasant sticky sensation.\nDo I have to apply this? Should I just not?\n[Reader-nim?]\n…No. It’s too late.\nThe Author was watching me, nagging about what I was doing to my precious skin.\nIt’s too late to back out now.\nBesides, my skin indeed stings a little.\nI had no choice but to apply it.\n“Co, cold…”\n[How can you apply it so unevenly? You have to apply it properly!]\n“…”\nWhy do you have to say something that makes sense?\nI felt a little displeased at the normal conversation that was different from the usual.\nWell, I mean… Since it’s sticky, can’t I just apply it moderately?\nIt’s not like you’re my parent.\n…But she could actually be my parent\nIt’s clear that the Author is the one who created this body.\n…Huh? Wait a minute.\n“Author-nim.”\n[Yes?]\n“How did you create this body?”\nA sudden question came to my mind.\nThe Author said that she created this body.\nThen where did this body come from?\nThat curiosity was resolved refreshingly by the Author’s answer.\n[I just created it?]\n“What does that mean…”\n[I set up the characteristics of a person and created it.]\n“…”\n[Should I say it’s the only creation? Not something that already existed, but…]\nA chill went down my spine.\nI shouldn’t have asked. I asked for no reason.\nAm I human or a doll?\nA doll that thinks it’s human?\nThe famous thought experiment of the brain in a vat came to mind.*\nThe terrible thought that even my past may have been created by the Author.\nThe terrible imagination that I had tried not to think about because just thinking about it made me dizzy reared its head again.\n[…I don’t know how lucky I am to have Reader-nim! Huh? What’s wrong?]\n“…No, it’s nothing.”\nNo, that can’t be.\nEven if the Author created this body, she couldn’t have made my mind.\nWhile she made my body, she can never change my mind.\nThere is no basis.\nBut I am human.\nWith that thought, I suppressed the imagination that had risen.\nIt will forever be stuck in the depths of my mind.\n“…Ahaha. It’s sticky and feels bad. Do I really have to apply it?”\n[I told you to apply it! Exposed skin must be covered! No matter what! Apply it!]\n“Okay.”\nSmile, let’s smile.\nAs usual, leisurely.\nI am Arte Iris.\nFollowing the Author’s instructions, sometimes offering opinions.\nLiving in this world.\n“… It’s gross.”\nI applied the sticky sunscreen generously.\nThe white and soft arms, different from me before I fell here, changed shape according to my touch and were stained with the sticky liquid.\nThe slick texture, along with the sticky feeling, was unpleasant.\n“There, done, right?”\n[It’s not enough! You forgot a spot!]\n“What? No, where else do I have to apply from here…”\n[You have to apply it on your chest and back, too! You can’t just get sunburned on your limbs!]\nIt’s not like I will show it to anyone anyway. Do I really need to go that far?\nEven if I get a little tan, it will return to normal after some time.\nI considered the need to protect areas covered with more than three layers of clothing, but then I gave up.\nI don’t think I need to argue with the Author over this.\n“… It’s heavy.”\n[I have an inexplicable sense of defeat… Did I make them too big for no reason…?]\n“You should have made them smaller. They’re bigger than I thought and quite uncomfortable.”\n[Eek…!]\nI continued to complain as I applied sunscreen to my chest area.\nTo be honest, I had never thought this size was big before.\nBeing immersed in countless 2D illustrations, huge breasts were a bit more…how should I say it?\nThe size of a face? I thought that was the starting point for huge breasts.\nIt was a crazy thought. Maybe it was because I was too immersed in that kind of illustration? I didn’t think it was very big.\nBut this size is big enough.\n“Phew, I applied it all. Should we relax leisurely at the beach now?”\n[What? You haven’t applied it all yet!]\n“What? What do you mean…”\n[Your back! Your back is important too, you know? The bikini exposes your back too!]\n“That’s true, but… I can’t reach my back.”\nWhat nonsense is she talking about?\nI can’t apply it on my back even if I want to.\nIt’s not within reach of my hands.\nYou could say I can reach it if I use my ability, but I’m wearing a swimsuit right now.\nThe moment I use it here, I’ll become a pervert who likes to strip outdoors.\nThe small surface area would tear apart even with a little use.\n[If that’s the case, there’s a way! You can ask someone else to apply it for you!]\n“…What?”\n[Oh, he’s coming over there! Come on, quickly!]\nSiwoo was slowly walking this way.\nMaybe he wondered what was going on since no one was around.\nThe Author told me to ask Siwoo, but there was one big problem.\n“But Siwoo is a man.”\n[That doesn’t matter…! It’s even better!]\nWhat’s good about it? Are you crazy?\n“If I ask Amelia or Dorothy…”\n[They’re not here right now!]\nI froze.\nI realized it then.\nRight now, the only person who can apply sunscreen is Siwoo.\nDidn’t they say they would come in an hour?\n…I decided to steel myself.\n***\nHow did it come to this?\nSiwoo let out a silent scream.\nCold sweat flowed all over his body, and he couldn’t calm down at all.\n“I’m sorry for asking you to do this.”\n“Oh, huh?! Ah, no! I’m fine!”\nThe voice he let out sounded too awkward even to me.\nBut Siwoo couldn’t get a hold of himself enough to mind such things. He couldn’t understand this situation at all.\nThe situation where Arte was lying down with her back fully exposed, and sunscreen was in his hand.\n“By the way, what did Amelia write down?”\n“It was nothing special…! That, that… What was it…”\nAt the unexpected question that she uttered lightly, his mind went blank.\n‘What should I do? What should I say?’\nThere was nothing difficult written on the note Amelia left behind.\n– It’s a chance to thoroughly enjoy Arte’s back, so work hard!\nOnly that one sentence was written.\nSeeing that, he wondered what this crazy girl was thinking, but Amelia and Dorothy had left for the villa.\nAnd Arte is applying sunscreen, but there’s no one to put it on her back.\nHe didn’t know the exact details, but one thing is certain.\nIt’s a situation orchestrated by Amelia.\n“…Sigh. It seems like she’s playing another prank. I got it.”\n“Oh, okay… Thanks…”\nFortunately, he didn’t need to come up with an excuse.\nArte was well aware of Amelia’s usual behavior.\nShe seemed to guess that something troublesome had happened again.\n“Come on, apply it quickly.”\n“Oh, okay…”\nGulp.\nThe anger towards Amelia instantly dissipated, and the perplexity returned as the situation remained unchanged.\n…So? Right now, Arte wants sunscreen applied on her back?\nAnd since Amelia and Dorothy, who should apply it, said they would come in an hour, he was the only one left.\nThat was the story.\nIt’s rational. If there’s only one person to apply it, it would be the right decision to ask that person.\n‘Except for the fact that I’m a man and Arte is a woman.’\nHe looked at Arte lying down again.\nLong stretched legs, the elastic breasts slightly deformed from being pressed against the ground.\nAnd the nape of the neck visible due to the hair being brushed aside to expose the back.\nEven the sexy buttocks, although covered by the black bikini, make it even more alluring.\nHis mind became confused.\n“Can you make it quick? I want to rest.”\n“Oh, okay…”\n‘Right. I should apply it. Yeah.’\nSiwoo decided to steel myself.\nYes, this is just applying sunscreen on her back.\nHe had no ulterior motives…\n‘Really none…!’\nAfter applying the sticky sunscreen on his hand, he brought it to Arte’s back with the thought of finishing it quickly.\n“Eek?!”\n“?!”\n‘Wha, what? Where did that sound come from just now?’\nHe hurriedly took my hand off and looked at Arte.\n“…Oh, well. It was a bit cold…”\n“I, I see.”\nArte explained in a crawling voice, slightly blushing as if embarrassed and narrowing her red eyes.\n… It’s painful.\n“I, I’ll apply it again…”\n“Okay…”\nWhen he brought his hand back, Arte flinched.\nIf he could look at her face, she’d probably be blushing in embarrassment. But he couldn’t think of that.\nHe felt the sensation of smooth skin on his fingertips.\nSkin like a newborn baby.\nThose who haven’t tried maintaining their skin wouldn’t know how difficult that is to achieve.\nFeeling Arte’s reaction of flinching, he stroked her back.\n“…Thank you.”\n“Oh, no problem.”\n“Are you going back to play in the water?”\n“…No, I will rest here for a bit.”\n“Is that so? Thank you.”\nHe could only watch Arte running towards the sea, stepping on the sandy beach while hugging his knees for a while.\n‘I couldn’t let Arte find out.’\nHe was nervous that she might notice because he only wore swimming trunks.\nFortunately, she did not seem to notice as she buried her face, saying she was embarrassed during the ordeal.\n“How was it? Did it feel good?”\n“A-Amelia?!”\n“Oh my, oh my, oh my… I saw something good…”\nThe two who said they would come after an hour spoke to him.\nWith a sinister smile on their faces.\nAuthor’s Notes\nArte’s brain has been destroyed!",

      "content": "Just Because I Have Narrow Eyes Doesn’t Make Me a Villain! - Chapter 76\nTN: Thank James Baily for the chapter.\nThey clearly said they would be at the villa for about an hour.\nSiwoo hurriedly checked the time, but an hour had not passed.\nEven if he hesitated for some time, not much time had passed.\nSo how are they here?\n“Why are you guys here? You clearly said you’d come after an hour…”\n“You believed that?”\n“…What?”\n“Even if we have luggage, it wouldn’t take an hour. A few minutes at most.”\nSeeing Amelia and Dorothy smiling gleefully, he realized.\nThese girls were watching the whole time.\n“So, how was it? Did you have fun?”\n“…”\n“Huh? How was it? How did it feel to touch Arte’s skin? Huh? Huh?”\nA sense of betrayal surged.\nHe thought he could understand Amelia.\nHe was already used to her coming up with absurd plans and executing them.\nHe could brush it off as Amelia being herself today.\nBut to think even Dorothy was involved.\nThanks to that, he was fooled into thinking it would really take an hour.\n“Dorothy, even you…!”\n“I’m sorry. But it seemed like it would be so much fun, I just…”\nIn the end, Dorothy is also a young woman.\nHe had seen her reading books a few times.\nSeeing that, he thought she was the knowledgeable type.\nBut to think she would use it in a place like this.\n“Please forgive me. But seeing you two caring for each other was so fun.”\n“Right?”\n“…”\nWhat was that saying?\nA bad companion ruins good morals?*\nMaybe Dorothy has already been influenced by Amelia.\nShe had shown signs of liking romance before, but after meeting Amelia, it seemed to have intensified in a bad way.\n“So? How was it?”\n“What was?”\n“Arte! I think she’s quite pretty, no? With a guy touching her undefended back with his bare hands…”\n“But nothing happened?”\n“Don’t lie! We saw from afar so we don’t know the details, but… Be honest, you got excited, right?!”\n“I didn’t.”\n“…Really?”\nIt’s a lie.\nThe touching alone was too much…\nAnd then her embarrassed scream?\nThere was a big problem that made it hard for him to get up for a while. (TN: Okay dude.)\nBut Siwoo didn’t tell the truth.\nWell, it’s because it subsided instantly as soon as he saw Amelia.\nEven when she looked at me suspiciously, there was no evidence.\nNo matter how pretty she is, so what?\nIt’s Amelia.\nThanks to that, he was able to hide the evidence.\n“Strange. You don’t have any functional issues, right? You shouldn’t…”\n“I’m perfectly fine?!”\n“Hmm…”\nHe was dumbfounded by her suspicious gaze.\n‘Did this girl forget that I’m a man and she’s a woman?’\nIf she was in her right mind, there’s no way she would say this…\n‘Ah, it’s Amelia.”\nThat answered everything.\n“… What’s with that look? It’s unpleasant.”\n“It’s nothing. So? What’s that you brought? It seems like too much to be just food and drinks.”\nIgnoring her sharp gaze, Siwoo changed the subject.\nMaybe he would have cracked if it was him when he first enrolled.\nBut to him, who has gotten used to Amelia, that level of gaze is nothing.\n“Good question!”\nDorothy took the chance to speak as she laid out her luggage.\n“…Oh, it looks delicious.”\n“Right? But that’s not all.”\n“Huh?”\nAmong the appetizing meats, there were a few vegetables hidden.\nHis gaze was captivated by the barbecue ingredients, which clearly showed Amelia’s taste as if she had prepared them.\n‘Meat is the best…’\nSiwoo’s mouth salivated as Dorothy opened the second box.\nSeeing the contents inside, he was quite perplexed.\n“…Alcohol?”\n“Heh, isn’t alcohol perfect for a trip?”\n“Well, I mean… That’s true.”\nHer luggage contained numerous bottles of alcohol.\nHe didn’t know exactly what kind of alcohol they were, but judging by the different colors and shapes, they must all be different.\nJust glancing at it, there seemed to be dozens of bottles.\n“… We’re going to drink all this?”\n“Are you crazy? How can we drink all this? It’s for making cocktails.”\n“Have you made them before?”\n“Don’t worry. I roughly know how to make them.”\nAmelia said with a grin.\n“It’ll be getting dark soon. Let’s have dinner. How about a party by the beach looking at the night view?”\n“He~, that sounds fun.”\nLeaving behind the two smiling happily, Siwoo looked at Arte floating in the middle of the sea.\nBefore he knew it, she had taken Amelia’s tube and was enjoying her time on top of it.\nSeeing her relaxed appearance, he smiled slightly and shouted.\n“Arte! Let’s have dinner! Come here quickly!”\n***\nSizzle.\nThe meats and skewers made delicious sounds as they grilled.\nSeeing that, the Author started groaning.\n[Ugh… I, I’m hungry… Why do I have to just watch this…]\nWho knows?\nIf you’re dissatisfied, you can come down and eat it yourself.\nThough if you really come down, I’ll hit you.\nCan she even come in the first place? I’m not sure.\n“…By the way, you know more than I thought, Amelia.”\n“More than you thought?”\n“No, I mean…”\nI watched as she skillfully measured with a jigger, put it in a shaker, and shook it.\nIt was quite a serious sight.\n“Ah, this? I learned a bit from my Granny. It looked cool.”\n“… I’m starting to wonder what kind of person she is.”\n“Well, she’s not a weird person. She just knows more and can do more than others.”\nThe sound of ice colliding noisily inside the shaking shaker could be heard.\n…Hmm, it’s quite atmospheric.\n“My dad was busy since I was young.”\n“Ah, your dad is an active hero, right?”\n“It feels a bit awkward hearing that from kids my age. Well, yeah. He’s a famous person, so he was busy every day.”\nThe shaking shaker stopped, and the alcohol inside was poured into a triangular glass.\nFour glasses of alcohol were poured, and Amelia stuck sliced lime as a garnish before bringing it to us.\n“That’s why Granny was hired. I’m more familiar with her than my dad, you know?”\n“She must be like family.”\n“Yeah. Actually, it’s become ambiguous to call it an employment relationship. Neither of us cares about that anymore.”\nI downed a glass of the alcohol that was poured into a martini glass.\nMaybe because sugar was added? There was a slight sweetness.\nAnd along with that, the freshness of lime and the unique taste of rum rose up.\nThe sweet and sour taste was exquisite.\n“How is it?”\n“It’s delicious.”\n“That’s a relief. It was my first time serving it to someone else.”\n“Why?”\n“…Because I had no friends to make it for.”\nAs I took another sip of the alcohol, I couldn’t taste the sweet and sour flavor of the drink.\nEven though there were no bitter ingredients, it felt like I had taken medicine.\n“Hmm… I’m quite talented, you know?”\n“To say that about yourself…”\n“Ah, why, Dorothy? It’s true, isn’t it?”\n“…Well, objectively speaking, it is true.”\nA talented family, pretty enough to be selected as a heroine.\nAs Amelia said, she was a talented person.\n“Maybe because of that, I was envied a lot.”\n“…”\n“It’s not like I didn’t have people I could call friends, but, hmm… They approached me because of my looks and family.”\nI knew.\nThe story Amelia was telling leisurely, under the influence of the atmosphere and alcohol, was a story I already knew.\n“They were only friends on the surface. There was no one I could really call a friend.”\nI knew that story too.\nBecause it was a setting the Author made.\n“So…well, there was no one to make this for. I learned it diligently because I heard students usually rebel once.”\nShe laughed awkwardly.\nAs if her younger self dreaming of secretly drinking alcohol with friends was embarrassing.\n“Granny thinks it’s okay to have that kind of experience once when you’re young, so I could learn easily. Well, in the end, I couldn’t use it.”\n“…I see.”\n“I thought I would never get to use it.”\nShe, who had been sipping the alcohol, downed it all at once and smiled, looking happy.\n“I achieved my dream after meeting you guys!”\n“… It’s only half. We’re already adults.”\n“Hey, what’s with that? Isn’t it enough that I did it?”\n“That’s right. It’s fortunate.”\nEveryone laughed, looking happy.\n…Right, that’s how it was.\nThe Author said Amelia had no close friends when she was young.\nSo, she added a setting in which Amelia wanted true friends.\nIt’s just as she said. Just as she set it up.\nAmelia had no friends when she was young, so she wanted friends she could open up to.\n…But did the Author decide why that was?\nAmelia wanted friends, so she learned how to make cocktails.\nShe also had the setting of being a rich girl.\nSo she ended up having a famous hero as a father, and because he lacked time, a butler who raised her in his place was created.\nAnd with all those settings combined, Amelia smiled happily as she made cocktails for us.\nDid the Author really set up the setting that Amelia knows how to make cocktails?\nI don’t think so. I was skeptical.\n“… It’s delicious. Can I have one more glass?”\n“Huh? Sure! It seems you like the skills of bartender Amelia!”\n“Yes. Please, bartender.”\n“Leave it to me!”\nI watched her put ice in the shaker again, looking happy.\nPerhaps it’s ridiculous for me to think of this world as a puppet show.\nIn fact, maybe everyone I killed was really human, and this is just another world.\nThey may have been forced to become villains by the Author’s power.\nOr they may have been villains deserving to die, just as I thought.\n“Here you go!”\n“Thanks.”\nI looked at the alcohol in the glass with tipsy eyes.\nThe sweet taste of sugar, the fresh taste of lime, and the unique taste of rum combine to create a new flavor in the cocktail.\nMaybe the Author adds a little grapefruit to the finished cocktail to vary the taste.\n…I don’t know. I didn’t want to know the truth.\nLooking at Amelia, she was smiling happily.\nMaybe it’s because of the setting that she wants true friends?\nI took another sip of the alcohol.\nCan I really call myself her friend?\nMe, who can’t accept the world as it appears.\nThe alcohol I sipped had a strong scent of alcohol.\nAuthor’s Notes\nName the cocktail whose main ingredients are sugar, rum, and lime.

You’re superhuman after all!”\n“Even superhumans have their limits…”\n“Don’t know, don’t care! Drink up! Chug it down!”\nAmelia’s loud, boisterous voice rang out.\nDoes that girl never get tired?\nDespite drinking the most, she kept pouring drinks and pestering Dorothy without rest.\n“Hmm…”\nAs Siwoo sighed, pondering how to rein in Amelia’s ridiculous behavior, he heard mumbling from beside him.\nArte was nodding off, half asleep.\n“…Arte? You sleeping?”\n“…”\nNo response.\nBased on her half-open red eyes, she didn’t seem to be fully asleep but was having trouble staying conscious.\nHe had been a bit worried from the moment she started readily downing every glass Amelia gave her without refusal.\n…Still, he never imagined it would come to this.\nThis was the first time Arte showed such a defenseless side to them.\n“Amelia.”\n“Huh? What?”\n“I’m going to take Arte back to her room. She looks tired.”\nAsking Amelia was impossible as she was half-drunk herself.\nA drunk person can’t escort another drunk person. Who knows what could happen?\n…You might say he could ask Dorothy then.\nHe didn’t want to.\nWhile Dorothy didn’t seem that drunk, the moment he asked her, it was obvious that drunkard would turn her attention to him.\nHe ignored Dorothy’s pleading gaze, and she looked at him with betrayal in her eyes.\nAbsolutely not doing that.\n‘This is payback for earlier. I’ll forgive you for deceiving me and using me for entertainment just this once.’\n“I’ll be back. It might take some time.”\n“Okayyy. See ya! Now, Dorothy! There are fewer people, so let’s drink! Chug it!”\n“Ah, since we’re out of snacks…maybe we shouldn’t?”\n“Hmm…? Don’t worry! There’s more!”\nKwang!\nDorothy rejoiced, thinking she had found an escape route upon seeing the empty box, but it was short-lived.\nShe thought all the ingredients in the box were gone, but Amelia suddenly brought another basket from behind her.\nThere was no longer anywhere for Dorothy to run.\n“Now, eat, eat! Today’s the day to eat, drink and die!”\n“Siwoo, a man taking a woman is…”\n“I’ll be back!”\n“Ah, please! Please spare me!”\nLeaving behind Dorothy’s groans and Amelia’s boundless joy, he set off.\n“Arte, you okay?”\n“Mm. I’m a foine…”\nFlushed red face. Unsteady gait.\nSlurred speech. And decisively, a dazed expression.\nHe was certain.\n‘Okay my foot, if I let her walk alone, she’d collapse in no time.’\n“…What do I do.”\n“Whoops.”\n“Arte?!”\nHe was pondering how to escort her properly.\nLost in thought for a moment, his concern came true as Arte stumbled and fell.\n“You okay?!”\n“…Hehe.”\n“Phew…”\nHe let out a sigh of relief.\nThank goodness. She’s fine.\n…No, wait. Come to think of it, Arte is a superhuman.\nShe wouldn’t get hurt from just falling over.\nAs proof, there was no sign of injury where she fell, just soft, supple skin…\n“Aaaaahhhh!”\n“…?”\n‘I tried not to pay it any mind…! I absolutely tried not to think about it…!’\nWith the fun atmosphere and delicious food, he had momentarily pushed it out of his mind, but it came rushing back.\nThe fact that Arte was currently in a fatal outfit no matter where you looked.\n“What do I do, what do I do…!”\nHe looked at Arte, who was once again nodding off.\nAt this rate, forget taking her to her room. They’d be spending the night in the middle of the road.\n… There’s no other choice? Right?\n‘Steel your resolve, Siwoo. This can’t be helped, it can’t be helped…’\n“Get on my back, Arte.”\n“Hmm…?”\n“At this rate, dawn will break before we get back. Hurry.”\nNo matter how he thought about it, this wasn’t going to work.\nWith Arte dead drunk, she might fall asleep walking alone.\nIn that case, he had no choice but to carry her.\n“Okey…”\nArte mumbled as she took unsteady steps.\nStep, step.\nPerhaps because only the sound of insects could be heard.\nIt felt like the sound of Arte approaching was especially loud.\n“Whew…”\nCalm down, Siwoo\n.\nIt’s no big deal.\nJust the act of moving Arte. Nothing more.\nHis resolve, which he kept repeating to himself, shattered the instant Arte got on his back.\nA few months ago, when Arte comforted him.\nHe had felt Arte’s touch.\nThe memory of being unable to sleep because of that soft sensation was still vivid.\nSince he had experienced it once before, he thought he was somewhat prepared…\n“Hmm, why ar we sitll ere…?”\n“… I’m going.”\nNonsense.\nHe stood up unsteadily and started walking.\nThe sensation was completely different from that time.\nThe Arte who comforted me then was clothed.\nHe could blatantly feel the texture of her leotard, but at least she was wearing something.\nHe was clothed too.\n…But now?\nForget a leotard, she’s in a bikini.\nShe even took off her pareo and top earlier, saying she was hot from drinking.\nHaving to carry Arte in this situation was torture.\nSince he was only wearing shorts, there was virtually no barrier.\nThe thin, small piece of cloth was the only wall between him and the two soft mounds…\nAnd her soft thighs that he was supporting with his hands…\nEven her slender arms wrapped around his neck…\n‘…Frankly, it’s agonizing. It’s hard to endure.’\nSiwoo had also been drinking, albeit not as much as Amelia and Arte.\nIt would absolutely never happen, but it was hard to control his desire.\n‘I need Amelia.’\nBut she isn’t here.\nIt’s just Arte and him, the two of them.\nHe slowly walked through an area with only the sound of insects and no sign of people.\n“…Hey, protagonist.”\n“…Me?”\n“Yeah.”\nHe was puzzled by the sudden remark.\n‘Why are you calling me that?’\nIt was the first time she referred to me that way.\nNot only the strange way she addressed me, but the fact that Arte dropped the formal speech as well.\nShe seemed considerably drunk.\n“I’m scared.”\n“…Of what?”\n“That the people I killed might have really been people.”\n“…”\nSiwoo stopped walking.\nRight now, Arte was spilling her innermost thoughts that she had kept tightly locked away.\nHe instinctively realized it.\n“You know. The people I killed, were they really just puppets? Could they have… actually been people?”\n“…What are you talking about?”\n“The puppets in this puppet show, do they really lack free will? I’ve always wondered… I mean, there was no way to know.”\nPuppet show, puppets.\nHe suddenly recalled Arte getting extremely agitated inside the Ferris wheel.\nShe said something similar back then.\nThat she had no intention of getting involved with puppets that lacked free will.\nHe had absolutely no idea what she meant at the time.\n…But now, he had a vague sense of understanding.\nArte wasn’t seeing people as people. She was only viewing them as puppets.\nHe could finally understand her cruelty towards villains, something even the twisted Amelia couldn’t comprehend.\n“Even now, I still think they were puppets… But were they really puppets?”\nArte’s voice gradually faded.\nShe probably didn’t even know what she was saying herself.\n“…”\nArte seemed to have drifted off into a light sleep again.\nConfirming that she was breathing steadily with her head resting on my shoulder, he started walking again.\nPeople and puppets.\nWhy is she so fixated on that?\nIn the first place, what do people and puppets signify?\n‘And why did she call me the protagonist?’\nSorting through my jumbled thoughts as he walked, he soon arrived at the villa.\nSiwoo laid Arte on the bed in the villa’s bedroom and became lost in thought.\nThis story that he unintentionally heard must be Arte’s true feelings.\nArte, who always seems composed, unintentionally revealed them.\nIt seemed she categorized humans into people and puppets.\n…He didn’t know what criteria she used to distinguish between humans and puppets.\nBut Arte became endlessly cruel to those she considered puppets.\nLike killing Lyla and brutally killing the Übermensch.\nHe stroked her head as she fell into a deep sleep.\nHe considers Arte a friend.\n‘So if something is troubling her, I will help.’\nArte’s unfathomable actions frightened him at first, but not anymore.\n‘Come to think of it, the more time I spent with Arte, the more my fear towards her faded.’\nShe wasn’t as scary as he thought, nor as inscrutable as they believed.\nToday, realizing what Arte feared through this incident was fortunate.\nShe was judging people based on some criteria.\nWhether they were puppets or people.\n‘In that case, I can help.’\nIf he can find the reason why Arte started thinking that way and resolve it,\nThen she won’t have to agonize over this anymore.\n‘I may not be able to undo what Arte has already done, but I don’t want to see her suffering any longer.’\n“I’ll help you, Arte.”\nBecause I’m your friend.\nAuthor’s Notes\nThe correct answer is Daiquiri.",

      "content": "“…My head hurts.”\nI clutched my head, suffering from a terrible headache.\nWhat was I doing?\nI drank the alcohol Amelia made, and then…\n“I can’t remember…”\n[Ah, Reader-nim. You’re awake?]\nI heard the Author’s voice.\nIt sounded playful like she was holding back laughter.\nI wondered why that was, but realized the reason from her words.\n[Oh my, what on earth did a man and woman do alone at night in that state…?]\n“What?”\nThe moment I looked around, puzzled by what she meant, I saw a black-haired man.\nThat familiar appearance I could recognize without being told who it was.\n…Why are you here?\nWithout thinking, a scary thought occurred to me, and I checked my body, noticing the bikini with an indecent amount of exposure.\nHuh? What?\nMy face turned pale instantly, and I felt my head go blank for a different reason than before.\nNo way, it can’t be… Right…?\n[A man and woman alone on a trip, in this exposed state…! Hehe, did you have fun last night?]\n“No!!!!”\nI let out an unintentional scream at the terrible imagination and was startled.\nIf I scream like this, Siwoo will…!\n“Yawn… Did you sleep well, Arte? Why are you yelling…”\n“Tell me honestly! Quickly!”\n“Geez… What?”\n“Last night! I, I didn’t do anything strange while drunk, right?!”\n“Last night?”\nSiwoo, with his eyes half-open, looked at me and our surroundings, trying to assess the situation.\nMy flustered appearance, the two of us in the same room. And our half-naked attire.\n“…Ah, sorry.”\n“What?!”\nI felt like losing my mind at Siwoo’s sudden apology.\nDon’t tell me, don’t tell me.\nReally? Seriously? We did it?\nThe Author’s snickering voice echoed in my ears.\nJust as I was about to let out a silent scream, wondering what on earth I had done last night, Siwoo spoke.\n“Looks like I fell asleep because I was a bit tired last night. I should’ve slept in my own room. Sorry about that.”\n“…Fell asleep?”\n“Yeah. You were pretty drunk, so I was helping you, but I must have unintentionally dozed off.”\nI mulled over Siwoo’s words.\nHe fell asleep?\n“…Nothing happened?”\n[Agh, he went and said it. How boring.]\nI heard the Author click her tongue and complain softly.\n…Nothing happened!\n“Gee, you startled me…”\n“What is it, Arte? Were you thinking something weird?”\n“Ah, n-no!”\nSiwoo’s meaningful smile was annoying.\nHe seemed to have noticed what I was thinking and tried teasing me.\n“Don’t make fun of me!”\n“Okay, okay.”\nHe smoothly brushes it off.\n… He’s changed a lot.\nThe Siwoo from when we first met wouldn’t have even considered joking around like this.\nHe seemed to have become a bit bolder after going through this and that.\nShould I consider this growth too?\nNo, that can’t be.\nNo matter how much of a growth-type protagonist he is, I’m certain this isn’t growth.\nAmelia must have had a lot of bad influence on Siwoo.\nRather than calling her a heroine, should I call her ink?\nThe speed at which she tainted people was reminiscent of ink.\nDorothy also seems to be getting tainted by Amelia.\n“Sigh. I see. What about the others?”\n“Who knows. They were drinking when I left.”\n“Just the two of them?”\n“Well, yeah. The three of us were drinking, but I left, so… It was hard to leave, too. I told them I’d be right back using you as an excuse.”\n“Right back? Isn’t it already morning?”\n“…Ah.”\nI clearly remembered Amelia’s appearance before I lost consciousness.\nShe was encouraging others to drink and livening up the mood with her high tension.\nI thought she was the type to get excited when drunk, and I remembered it clearly because she kept offering me drinks.\n…But you left Amelia alone with Dorothy in that state?\nAnd you said you’d be right back but fell asleep?\n“We’re in trouble…”\n“Let’s go check on them. Ugh, my head…”\nClutching my throbbing head from the hangover, I decided to look for Dorothy and Amelia.\nWhere was it again? We definitely had the party on the sandy beach.\n“Here, take this.”\n“Huh? Why clothes…”\n“You left your clothes and pareo there. At least cover up a bit. It’s morning, and it’ll be cold by the sea.”\n“…Thanks.”\nI accepted the clothes Siwoo handed me.\nI had clothes in my unpacked luggage in the room, so I could’ve just worn my own, but he was thinking of me.\nI didn’t want to reject his goodwill.\n“… It’s warm.”\nThe clothes Siwoo gave me didn’t fit at all.\nHis shoulders were much bigger, and his sleeves were too long because he was taller than me.\n…How annoying.\nIt reminded me that I had entered Arte Iris’ body.\n…I felt human warmth that I couldn’t sense from other beings.\n“Arte, let’s go. They shouldn’t be, but we need to wake them up if they’re sleeping there.”\n“Ah, okay. I’ll be right there.”\nTightly gripping the loose top, I hurriedly left the room with Siwoo.\n***\n[I should scold you firmly, Reader-nim. Saying something like that to the protagonist of all people is a big deal. I already let it slide once before.]\nShe laughed softly, complaining that she forgave me once because Arte seemed mentally unstable, but she did it again.\n[Well, this is fun in its own way, so I’ll forgive you. As long as it’s entertaining, that’s all that matters. Shall I change up the final boss candidates a bit?]\nShe muttered while watching Siwoo put his arm around Arte as they walked back together on the path he had taken alone the previous night.\n[This world is really interesting. It surprises me how unpredictable it can be, even with my power. But that makes it more fun.]\n‘Life with you, Reader, is more enjoyable than I expected.’\nShe was a bit taken aback whenever she tried to scale things up as usual, only for problems to arise.\nResolving unexpected incidents is delightful, so it should be fine, right?\n‘The reactions of other beings are better than I anticipated, to the point where I want to continue this fun, creative life with you indefinitely, Reader.’\n[Ah, it’s a shame that nothing lasts forever.]\n‘But someday, I’ll have to part ways with you too, Reader.’\nYour mental state doesn’t seem very good, so it’ll probably last one to two years at most.\nShe recalls you complaining before about how academy novels always stop being mainly about the academy after about a year.\n‘It really does, huh.’\nAmong those watching with interest, there is someone who can manipulate time, but she doesn’t want to borrow the hands of others.\n‘This is a story of you and me, Reader.’\n[I’m looking forward to how it will end!]\nShe watched the Reader and Protagonist hurriedly trying to wake up the two people lying on the sandy beach.\nAs she thought, she wasn’t wrong.\nCompleted stories definitely have their charm, but there’s a unique flavor to something incomplete progressing toward completion.\nThose who scoffed when she said she’d show it in real-time are now watching, full of anticipation.\nShe laughed at their disgruntled complaints about what she’d do with that kind of development, that they could do better than her, yet they’re still watching in the end.\nThe impatient ones said they’d try it themselves and are looking for their desired locations.\n‘Well, they can do as they please. I’m too busy enjoying my time with you to care what others are doing, Reader.’\n[What will happen today, Reader? Please entertain us again today.]\n‘You seem to think I’m a web novel author.’\nShe figured it wouldn’t be much of an issue even if the Reader thought that.\nDon’t they say a work is another world?\nIn that case, there should be no problem displaying a world as a work.\n‘It was quite difficult to put you into this world, but you have always brought me enjoyment so far, Reader. So if I continue to trust and wait for you, you’ll create an interesting story.’\nThe pure girl smiled brightly.\nAs if looking forward to what’s to come.\n***\n“I’m disappointed.”\n“I said I’m sorry…”\n“Unforgivable…ugh.”\n“…Okay, that’s enough. Dorothy, there’s hangover medicine in the luggage over there, so take some first.”\n“Th-thank you…”\nWith corpse-like steps, Dorothy went to find the hangover medicine.\nEven so, her gaze towards Siwoo was fierce, as if saying she’d deal with him later.\n“She’s still mad, huh…”\n“Of course she is. Wow, just how many bottles did you drink.”\n“…Ugh, I think we finished almost all of it.”\n“Ah, Amelia.”\nClutching her head, Amelia staggered over.\nThe always lively Amelia was tottering today as if she had poured all her energy into last night.\n…She looks like a homeless person.\n“You drank all that? Are you in your right mind?”\n“I’m not. That’s why I drank it all. Ugh, my head…”\nI handed soup to Amelia, who was suffering from a hangover, and she gulped it down instantly.\n…Are you sure you’re hungover? That’s really fast.\nAuthor’s Notes\nRuminas-nim, have a good evening.\nTranslator’s Corner\nHave a good week, Author-nim.\nBoom, get one-upped.\n-Ruminas",

      "content": "“…”\nSiwoo gazed at Arte, who was talking with Amelia.\nDorothy put her head down on the table after taking hangover medication.\nBefore he knew it, the four of them were together, hungover, eating a meal.\n“Aren’t you going to eat?”\n“Ah, I’m okay. I’m not really hungry.”\n“Really?”\nUnlike Dorothy, who looked half-dead, Amelia seemed to have already regained some of her energy.\nWhen he refused the meal, she took the soup that was supposed to be his and began eating it deliciously.\n‘… She’s eating well. Is it because it was supposed to be mine?’\nAmelia was eating so deliciously that he briefly considered taking it back out of spite, but he quickly shook his head.\nYesterday’s worries had completely robbed him of his appetite.\nSiwoo looked at Arte.\n‘What could she be thinking about right now?’\nHumans, dolls, and free will.\nYesterday’s events had convinced him that this was the dilemma Arte was grappling with.\nShe was clearly in a precarious situation.\nShe was categorizing others into two groups: humans and dolls.\nHe couldn’t possibly think that was normal.\nDolls and humans. He had stayed up all night pondering what that meant before accidentally falling asleep…\nThanks to that, Siwoo was able to realize it.\nArte’s thinking was really twisted.\n“Ugh, my head. Let’s take it easy today. We partied too hard yesterday…”\n“I agree…”\nArte could not see others as human, and because of that, she could be more cruel than anyone.\nRealizing this fact, Siwoo agonized over it for a long time.\nHow could he get Arte to see others as humans, not dolls?\nAt first, that was what he contemplated, but he quickly gave up. A huge flaw had been discovered.\nArte felt no guilt because she couldn’t see people as human.\nThen, if she started perceiving people as human?\nIf she realized that the things she had done thinking they were dolls were actually done to humans?\n…Who knows? At the very least, nothing good would come of it. That’s what Siwoo thought.\nThen how could he get her to recognize people as human without hurting Arte?\nSiwoo came to a conclusion. It was impossible for Arte not to get hurt.\n“Arte…”\nNo matter what happened, she was bound to get hurt.\nSiwoo could tell.\nArte is–no, Arachne is cruel. Enough that those who held grudges against villains would cheer.\nSo Arte, as a member of Arachne, must have also committed countless cruel acts.\nEven so, he had watched Arte by her side, seeing things others didn’t know.\nHer thoughts were inscrutable, and she sometimes did things he couldn’t understand…\nSiwoo believed that, at her core, Arte was kind.\nIt was just, it was just…\nHer heart was sick.\nOthers couldn’t see it, but Siwoo could.\nA virulent poison rotting her from the inside out.\nThe only way was to remove the infected part. Still, if that was done, the patient had a very high likelihood of being unable to endure it and dying.\nThere was only one way to cure such an illness.\nThe infected part had to be removed and replaced with something to take over its function.\nSiwoo vowed.\nEven if Arte gets hurt someday, he will become her strength.\n“Yoo Siwoo! Are you just going to keep standing there?! We came to the beach, so let’s have some fun!”\n“…Ah. I’ll be right there.”\n“Hurry up!”\nFor now, maybe he should start by making summer memories for Arte.\n***\n“…Sigh.”\n[What’s wrong, Reader-nim?]\n“No, it’s just… It’s been a while since I’ve seen a school uniform…”\n[Hmm, that’s true. Could it be that you don’t want to start the new semester?]\n“Yes…”\nI couldn’t help but let out a sigh.\nI can’t believe summer vacation is over… Time really flies.\nThe break was extended by a week, but it doesn’t feel like it.\nThey say time flies when you’re having fun.\n[I’m happy about it! Both you and the protagonist were just staying home! It was boring!]\n“We weren’t just staying home… We went to the sea almost every day.”\n[That doesn’t count as going out!]\n“…”\nI tried to argue with the Author but couldn’t get anywhere.\n…Dammit.\nWell, I guess it would be boring to keep watching the protagonist.\n“Fine, fine. We can leave soon.”\n[Yay! A fun school life!]\n“…”\nIt’s not that academy life isn’t enjoyable…\nBut regardless of that, on the first day back, feeling your whole body go limp like a water-soaked sponge is unavoidable.\nIt annoyed me a bit that the Author spoke so lightly about it when she doesn’t even attend herself.\n[You can look forward to it! The academy has been renovated!]\n“Ah, right. There was talk about that.”\nI remember that being mentioned.\nThe academy was definitely… what was it? I forgot the name of the place.\n…Anyways, it was half-destroyed by the attack of those animal friends.\nWhile cleaning that up, they discovered a secret room that made it dangerous, so they said they would rebuild.\nI was curious how they rebuilt it, and the Author said it was something to look forward to.\nArriving at the academy gates, I understood why.\n“… Didn’t it get even bigger than before?”\n[Yep!]\n“There’s a bunch of machines…?”\n[A cutting-edge system that intercepts those whose identities can’t be verified is the setting!]\nIt felt like it had become more of a fortress than a school.\n“…Are you sure this is okay?”\n[Hey, the academy was half-destroyed, so this level of precaution is a must!]\n“No, that’s not what I meant…”\nDid they rebuild it like this during the short summer break?\n…How?\nWhen I expressed that doubt, the Author smiled and said.\n[The materials were, well, solved with superpowers. And heavy equipment just needs superhumans, so it’s much faster than you’d think. Hehe.]\n“…”\nI had no idea how that was supposed to make sense.\nBut there’s no point in mentioning it now.\nShe solved everything with the use of superpowers. That should be enough.\n***\n“…This may be sudden, but we’re beginning midterms starting today.”\n“What?!”\nImmediately, Teacher Claire dropped a bombshell on the class after reuniting.\nMidterms for the students feeling down about vacation ending.\nI couldn’t hide my shock either.\n“Author-nim…?”\n[It wasn’t me! It wasn’t me! I don’t know anything about this!]\nRight, even still, there’s no way she would do that.\nAny other Author would curse themselves out for that.\nBut that’s what actually happened. Even though the Author didn’t touch it.\nJust what is going on?\n“I know it’s startling.”\n“S-Startling doesn’t even begin to describe it! Midterms when not even a day has passed since break ended?!”\n“Do you remember what happened on the last day before vacation?”\n“…”\nThe students’ mouths closed.\nWell, there’s no way anyone forgot. It was a huge incident.\nThey say no students were seriously injured, but many teachers got hurt protecting them.\nHow would the students who directly witnessed that feel?\n“The academy was attacked, and our prestige hit rock bottom. There was even talk of taking a whole semester off.”\n“But! We defeated the villain…!”\n“We repelled them. But that’s not what’s important. People got hurt, the building was damaged, and villains infiltrated. Do you know what that means?”\n“W-Well…”\n“Idiots who think they can do it too will multiply, that’s what.”\nHmm.\nThe academy had never experienced an attack like this before, so when an unprecedented incident occurred.\nThere’s a difference between having no precedent and it happening once before. I could kind of understand what she meant.\n…But what does that have to do with midterms?\n“So, how is that related to midterms…”\n“It’s related. The content of the midterms has changed because of that.”\nIntercepting the questioning student, Teacher Claire opened a black rectangular box.\n“The midterm period is from today until one month before finals begin.”\n“What?!”\n“The content is the procurement of points.”\nA student roster floating in a blue light emerged from the box.\nNext to the students’ faces, the letters “0p” were bobbing up and down.\n“The procurement method for points is simple. Subdue villains or help citizens. The point amounts will be determined by three or more teachers reviewing the incident.”\n“B-But we’re students! We don’t have time for that…”\n“Until finals, it’s self-study.”\nThe students were taken aback by Claire’s words.\nIt’s surely startling. However, the teacher didn’t wait for the students to regain their composure and continued with the announcements.\n“It’s a good time for villains to run rampant. You all should be well-rested, and the teachers judged that you need some real-world experience.”\n“But, it’s dangerous…!”\n“That’s why there are also points for social contributions besides subduing villains.”\nAs if refusing to hear any objections, Claire packed up the hologram box and said.\nWhat happened over the break to change the usually stoic but kind teacher like this?\nLeaving the students’ doubts behind, the teacher brought someone in.\nIt was someone I was familiar with. At least the Author and I were.\n[Hmm, a lollipop is a bit iffy. A cigarette would be cooler after all.]\n“Lastly, I’ll introduce the new teacher who is replacing someone who can no longer serve as an instructor.”\n“Nice to meet you, everyone.”\nPerhaps he gave up his usual cigarette because he was in front of students.\nWith a lollipop in his mouth, he smiled brightly.\n“I’m the former investigator, Lee Ha-Yul. I look forward to working with you.”",

      "content": "“Investigator. Starting tomorrow, don’t work anymore.”\n“…What?”\nA few weeks ago, Arte took Ha-Yul as a bodyguard, saying she was going to the beach with her friends.\nTaking advantage of a moment when no one was around, Arte ordered him not to come to work.\nThe memory of being flustered and thinking she may have been displeased with how he handled his duties vividly resurfaced.\nNot wanting to give up my work at Arachne, he had resolved to try to persuade Arte.\nHowever, the conversation took a slightly different turn than I had anticipated.\n“B, but I still have much to offer Arachne!”\n“…Ah. Not the organization, I mean the Association. I’ve already contacted them.”\n“The Association, you say?”\n“Yes, the Association. I think you should take on some different duties.”\nShe flashed a smile at him.\nHair fluttering in the breeze and a bright smile.\nA bikini that emphasized her figure like a girl her age.\nNo matter how you looked at it, she didn’t seem like the leader of Arachne, the one called the ‘nightmare of villains.’\nWhen momentarily dazed by that sight, he didn’t properly hear what she said next.\n…Ah, right. She said,\nHelp the students gain motivation.\nEnsure their spirits aren’t broken by the villains.\n“On the last day before vacation, many of you witnessed numerous villains shattering the peace.”\n“…”\nIt was a story they had just heard from Claire as well.\nBut the students fell silent once more.\nOne’s first real battle is always dangerous and shocking for anyone.\nThat’s why students are sent into the field with as much preparation as possible.\nThere was no time to prepare this year, so even though the students had rested well, whenever that incident was brought up, they seemed to recall what happened back then.\n…Well, it’s a good thing for him.\nIt was a headache that many students turned to villainy, but if it becomes a trauma for them, that number will decrease.\nHe didn’t want to see those kids dying while crying out for their mothers.\nBut that’s his personal take.\nThe academy and Association said they were quite at a loss.\nIf the students gave up on becoming heroes, it was obvious that the shortage of superpowered individuals in society would worsen.\nOn top of that, the number of injured teachers was considerable.\nWith some in critical condition requiring months of recuperation, there was a shortage of teachers.\n“It must have been frightening. I understand. I was scared of the first villain I encountered, too. Wondering if I could beat that person. What would happen if I lost… But didn’t you feel any other emotion besides fear?”\nThat’s why the Association and Arte decided to make use of him.\nSociety was currently in a state of suppressing villains strongly, so there was some leeway for now, but it was like a powder keg that could explode at any time.\nEven one more would progress that a little faster.\nBlades were needed to excise the cancerous masses from society.\nEven knowing the students may be in danger, deliberately conducting midterms this way was part of that.\nThe students’ trauma may be further triggered. They may face a daunting wall and collapse.\n… That’s why Ha-Yul was the right person for the job. Why Arachne was the right choice.\nBecause as a member of an organization that hated villains, he could awaken the students.\nBecause he could overwrite their trauma with hatred.\n“I heard a considerable number of civilians in the commercial district around the academy were injured, and some even died.”\n“…”\n“After fighting a villain for the first time, I felt fear like all of you. And I also felt rage.”\nHe could see the faces of a few students instantly fall.\nFamily? Or close acquaintances?\nHe didn’t know. However, he could at least infer that they knew the victims.\nIn that case, it’s simple. It’s easy to transform that sorrow into a different emotion.\n“Why should we fear villains? Shouldn’t it be the criminals who need to be afraid? As someone who condemns villains, didn’t you feel anger towards them?”\n“… I’m so angry. Why, because of those bastards, uncle…!”\n“There was a kind lady at the store, but I haven’t seen her lately. Could something have happened to her…”\n“…They were good people.”\nFrustration and sorrow hung on their faces.\nAt the same time, they began to feel rage toward the people who made them feel those emotions.\n“Ha-yul, what are you…”\n“Remember that sorrow. And think of those who caused that feeling.”\nHe pried open the wounds in the students’ hearts that had begun to heal.\nRipping apart and exposing the wounds gradually healed by the medicine of time.\nAnd showing it to them.\nTo the ones who hurt you,\nCondemn them.\nThey may be stronger than you,\nBut don’t worry.\nWe’re here.\nYou will become even stronger.\n“Feel fear, but also rage. And strive to bring down the hammer of justice upon them. I’ve come to help you with that.”\nHe glanced at Claire’s flustered expression from the corner of his eye.\nShe must be wondering what in the world just happened all of a sudden.\nHe felt a bit sorry, but he had no intention of stopping.\nIt was obvious that the world would become chaotic from now on.\nThe students who would fight villains and evil on the front lines had to grow up strong.\n‘Like you and me, they can’t be crushed by mere trauma.’\n“Let me introduce myself once more. I’m the former head of metahuman criminal investigations, Lee Ha-Yul. I will teach you how to subdue and transport criminals, basic legal knowledge, and the fundamentals of combat against humans.”\nClap, clap, clap.\nA few students who were deeply moved by my speech began to applaud, and swept up by the atmosphere, other students started clapping as well.\n‘…Good, looks like I’ve fastened the first button properly.’\nDrawing out trauma, displaying it. And then pointing to the cause and redirecting the arrow of rage.\nNow, he just needs to keep adding fuel so that anger doesn’t die out.\nEmotion is what drives people. The more intense and powerful it is, the more it moves people.\nIf he manages that emotion well so it doesn’t fade, it will be of help to the Association.\nHe felt a sense of pride at the sight of Arte’s smile, as if saying he had done a good job.\n“Ha-Yul!”\n“Ah, Claire. Long time no see.”\n“You, you. Just what did you…!”\nClaire seemed flustered but also had an air of wanting to reprimand him.\nWell, it’s understandable. From her perspective, it was an unexpected action. Even if the Association ordered it, she probably wouldn’t accept it.\nClaire had always been so righteous that it felt stifling.\nObviously, she would think it wasn’t right to stimulate the students this way.\n“I know, Claire. You want to say something like, ‘How can you agitate the students like this, right?'”\n“You did it even though you knew?! Do you even realize what you’ve done…!”\n“I know. I know very well. I’m well aware that you really hate this method.”\n“What if they get seriously hurt because they’re swayed by emotion!”\n“…Is being swayed by emotion always a bad thing?”\n“What?”\nClaire blankly asked him back. It was an expression that showed she hadn’t expected him to oppose her.\n…Honestly, he was surprised too. He had also thought the same way.\nHim talking back to Claire. How many years had it been?\nSince our student days, the three of us always hung out together.\nThe two often fought because their personalities didn’t match well.\nClaire, who pursued moderation, and Ha-Yul, who tried to gloss over everything, didn’t get along.\nShe would always reprimand him, and he would brush it off. Angered by that, Claire would reprimand him again…\nThe smile that would stop them was nowhere to be found.\n“I met the criminal who killed ‘him.'”\n“What?! Th-That’s…! That guy got out?! Wh-Where is he right…!”\n“Don’t worry. I already killed him.”\n“?!”\nAs he said it out loud, it felt like he could vividly recall that moment, and a smile lingered on his lips.\nThat bastard wasn’t even worth using his ability on.\nWith his own hands, directly.\nHis neck was so soft.\nAh, how ecstatic that agonized look was.\n“Y-You…! You killed him?! That’s…!”\n“A villain? No, it’s different. It’s different from that.”\n“How is it different!”\n“That was revenge, no. Punishment. The rightful sentence was given to a despicable sinner who hadn’t paid for his crimes.”\nSomeone once said.\nRevenge breeds revenge. To break the chain of revenge, you need to know how to forgive.\nRevenge isn’t sweet, they said.\nWrong.\nHe can assert that it was the first time he had felt that happy since he died.\nHe’ll never forget that moment when he cut off that bastard’s breath with his hands.\n“I’m sorry, Claire. I wanted to leave your share too, but… Since there’s only one life. The first one to take it is the owner, right?”\n“You, you…”\n“Are you going to tell me revenge isn’t right? But you know, all heroes are avengers.”\nHeroes always appear only after villains emerge.\nThis has been an unchanging fact for hundreds of years.\nBut that’s why heroes always take revenge.\nTo protect society, to realize justice.\nA hero is an avenger who punishes villains who have committed crimes.\n“Things won’t get as extreme as you think. I have no intention of creating criminals. After all, that would increase my workload.”\n“Ha-Yul… You’ve changed.”\n“Of course I’ve changed, Claire. It’s been years since then.”\nRealizing that no matter what she said, he wouldn’t accept it, Clair looked at him with complicated eyes, and he smiled at her.\n“Don’t worry, Claire. I’ll definitely make your students strong.”\n‘So no one will feel the pain we went through.’\nAuthor’s Notes\nI received some cool fan comics and pretty fan art! Hurray!\nYou can check it out in the announcement! I think it would be good if everyone took a look!\nI’m just grateful for all your love!",

Amelia, remember when I mentioned meeting an investigator before?”\n“You did say that…So what about it? Is it that person?”\n“Yeah. But it feels like his atmosphere has changed.”\n“His atmosphere?”\nAmelia asked with a laugh.\n“You can differentiate people’s expressions now?”\n“No, that’s not it…”\n“Then you must be mistaken. Or maybe you just didn’t have a good first impression? Your impression might not have been good since you were being investigated.”\n“Is that so?”\nAmelia’s words made sense.\nCertainly, Siwoo had mixed feelings towards the investigator back then.\nWondering if he could really stop Arte. If he was being too forceful in his questioning. The wrongness, knowing he did nothing wrong.\nIt wasn’t a particularly good impression.\nWas that why he felt something off about the investigator?\nNo, it was different from that.\nHe couldn’t express it in words, but it felt like something had changed.\nAs if his ability had awakened…\n“Oh, it’s the teacher. What brings you here?”\n“Nothing much. I just thought I’d greet the students.”\nThe investigator approached with a friendly smile, interrupting Siwoo’s thoughts.\nIt seemed like he had been talking with Claire.\nWas their conversation already over?\n“Hello, Siwoo. Long time no see. Do you remember me?”\n“Ah, Investigator. Of course I remember you.”\n“I’d appreciate it if you called me teacher, Siwoo. I’m a teacher now, after all.”\n“Ah, yes. I apologize.”\nAs if the atmosphere from earlier had vanished, Ha-yul smiled gently.\nIt was a soft atmosphere, unlike Claire’s stiff one.\n“You don’t have to be so tense. If you’re worrying about what happened last time, I’m sorry.”\n“It’s alright… teacher.”\n“I’m glad to hear that. It’s part of the job, after all.”\nHe laughed, saying that due to the nature of his profession, he often had to be forceful during interrogations.\nIt was a completely different appearance from what he had shown earlier.\nAmelia and Dorothy also seemed to feel something off about this.\nWell, it was only natural.\nAfter all, he didn’t seem like someone who had just been preaching revenge to the students.\n“Teacher, your atmosphere is quite different from earlier?”\n“…Ah. I can see why you’d think that. It’s nothing much. You have to separate work and private life, right?”\n“Aha.”\nHa-Yul took his leave after chatting with Dorothy and Amelia for a while.\n“Well then, I’ll get going now. I want to greet the other students as well briefly.”\n“Goodbye!”\n‘…Is it my imagination?’\nAfter the attack by Übermensch, how many days was he unconscious after nearly dying?\nAfter that, he went on a trip to recuperate as well.\n‘Is that why? My ability seems to have dulled a bit.’\nTo malfunction like this. It’s never happened before.\n***\nAfter Siwoo left, thinking it was his imagination, Ha-Yul muttered quietly, his friendly smile disappearing.\n“A person who will bring about incidents.”\nAn ordinary boy. At least, that was all he saw Siwoo as.\nDue to his profession, he had met countless people and seen many lie and hide their true selves.\nHaving lived that life for over a decade, he thought he had confidence in reading people.\nThat’s why, even without definitive evidence, he had considered Arte to be Arachne and investigated her. Well, he turned out to be right in the end.\nHa-Yul trusted his intuition and discernment and viewed Siwoo as an ordinary student.\nThe only thing unusual about him was that he was close to Arte.\n… That’s what he had thought.\n“He’s certainly different, Arte.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes. He’s made remarkable progress in such a short time.”\nIn just a few months, he seemed to have leaped several levels from a student who stood out only a bit among his peers.\n“To think he’d sense something off about me after briefly seeing me. We haven’t talked that much in the first place.”\n“…Is that so?”\n“Yeah. Even Claire, a long-time friend, took some time to notice the oddity, but he noticed it as soon as he saw me. He said something about me had changed.”\nHa-Yul thought to himself.\nHe felt he understood why Arte was keeping a close eye on him.\nShe sometimes muttered to herself about the protagonist this, plot development that.\nWith that level of growth, it wouldn’t be wrong to call him a protagonist.\n‘If I were five years younger, would I have burned with jealousy?’\nHe was sure that his skill level was only about that of one or two executives in a criminal organization last time.\nOf course, that was still excessively strong for a student, but that was it.\nThere were plenty of ways to deal with one person somehow.\nOutstandingly strong for a student but just an exceptional prospect. That’s what Ha-Yul had thought.\nBut after seeing him just now, he realized.\nThat wasn’t it.\n“I don’t think I’ll be able to catch Siwoo in the future.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes.”\nHis speed at detecting changes was exceptionally fast.\nIf he judged it to be dangerous, he would instantly leave.\n“The moment I turn to mist, he’ll flee without looking back. If that happens, I won’t be able to catch him.”\nOf course, even though his ability allowed him to attack people unilaterally, the mist needed time to spread.\nTrying to ambush him wouldn’t work, and there was no way to capture him.\n“You said his ability was intuition?… That’s not on the level of intuition.”\n“He must have grown.”\nEven if he grew, isn’t this too much?\nHa-Yul laughed helplessly.\nIf he continued to grow as Arte said, no one would be able to interfere with him, let alone catch him.\nHe seemed like a free spirit.\n“If he grows even further from here…”\nHa-Yul became curious.\nJust what would he be like ten years from now?\n***\nIn a run-down, dirty alley. Someone wearing a hood was staggering, unable to steady themselves.\n“Stop right there.”\n“This is our turf. Do you know where you’ve come, punk?”\n“…”\n“Hey, what are you mumbling about? Get lost. Can’t you hear me? You wanna die?”\nSwish, swish.\nEven as they threatened, swinging around rusty knives, the hooded figure remained motionless, prompting them to mutter.\n“Ah, fuck. Boss, what should we do?”\n“What can we do? We’ve given enough warning. Hey, I don’t know who you are, but we’ve sufficiently warned…”\n“…Hun.”\n“Huh?”\n“…Hungry.”\nIt happened in an instant.\nAs one villain approached, having heard the mumbling, his arm was ripped off and devoured in a flash.\n“Aaa-aaaargh! My, my arm! My arm!”\n“Let’s become one. We can do it. Make everyone equal.”\n“Cr-Crazy bitch! Kill her quick! Kill her qui…!”\n“What the, what is…”\n“Shit…! What the hell is that?!”\nAs the wind blew back the hood, briefly revealing what lay beneath, they were horrified.\nA terrible sight of body parts from various animals haphazardly mixed together.\nFeeling an instinctive fear towards the inhuman form, they stepped back.\n“Hey, you guys want to become one too, right?”\n“What kind of crazy nonsense…! Get lost, you monster bitch!”\n“Mir said. Let’s make the world equal. Yeah, that’s right. Equality. Good girl, Annie remembers well. Right, Mir? Hehe, praise me.”\nThe villains realized. They had messed with the wrong person.\nThey had disturbed a huge bomb, a fact they only grasped after it had already exploded.\n“And Mir said… It’s no use refusing. We only shout for equality. If society can’t withstand it, let’s offer condolences.”\n“Fuck… We’re screwed…”\n“Hey, let’s all become equal.”\nAfter a short while, the alley was empty.",

      "content": "“…This is the best choice, right?”\n“I think so.”\nI expressed my agreement with Amelia’s words.\nWell, it’s what the Author wanted.\nIt was obvious she would agree.\nRight now, we have two choices before us.\nEarn points by defeating villains, or earn points by contributing to society.\n…I say contributing to society, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was just unpaid slave labor.\nAnyways, considering the Author’s personality and the uniqueness of the world in the novel…\nNo matter how I thought about it, what she wanted to choose was already set in stone.\nAnyone could see that defeating villains was more exciting, right?\nSince she constantly has to show the readers something, she would prefer incidents to occur.\n[Defeating villains! Defeating villains! Helping citizens is for cowards!]\nSee? I knew it would be like this.\nWell, I had no complaints either.\nAccording to what I heard from Ha-Yul, the Protagonist was definitely growing.\nTo the extent that even he was amazed.\nHe said his growth rate was so high that he could understand why I called him the Protagonist.\n…But it’s not enough. No, even if it’s sufficient, he should grow more.\nSince we don’t know when he might face a dangerous situation.\nEven if I keep hovering around him, I’m only human too.\nI might inadvertently overlook a threat, or an enemy I can’t handle alone might appear.\nI don’t think that would happen unless the Author goes crazy, but she isn’t omnipotent either. I knew that better than anyone.\nIf she makes one mistake in the settings and an enemy appears that the Protagonist, heroine, and even I can’t handle, it would be a huge problem.\nIf that happens, it’s over. The only person will die.\nI couldn’t just stand by and watch that happen.\nEven if I keep the worst-case scenario in mind, a situation worse than that might occur at any time.\nWhile I could still control him, I had to make Siwoo grow as much as possible by any means necessary.\nThat’s why I was in favor, but… I wonder what they think.\n“Alright. The villain subjugation gives more points.”\n“I don’t mind either.”\nFortunately, there wasn’t an atmosphere of opposition.\nSo, I was going to watch Siwoo and the heroines’ growth while hovering around him with peace of mind.\n…But a problem arose.\nA problem I never anticipated.\n“The maximum number of people is two.”\n“What? B-But it’s villain subjugation…!”\nA voice tinged with dissatisfaction leaked out without me realizing it.\nTwo people? There are four of us right now.\nOf course, we can split into two groups of two, but if we go as a group of four from the start, there’s no problem, right?\nWhy do we have to do this?\n“I was told it’s to have you act in pairs and gain field experience. Since that’s how you operate in real situations.”\n“…Ah.”\nCome to think of it, there was a setting like that.\nIt was a one the Author added.\nHeroes basically act in pairs or something like that.\n…A setting casually thrown in before is holding us back now.\n[Ehehe…]\n“Sigh… I understand.”\n“…What should we do? If you don’t want to split up, we can choose the other option. I heard there’s no limit on the number of people there.”\n“No, let’s go like this. Let’s split into two groups.”\nThere was no other way.\nThe Author had already set things up, and it would be burdensome for her to change them now.\nThe proof was that she couldn’t say anything and was just silent.\nNo matter how you looked at it, it would be too much to change.\nThen we go as is.\n“Ah, then I’ll go with Dorothy.”\n“Sounds good. You just need to protect me, and it’ll be fine!”\n“Don’t worry. You know how fast I am, right?”\n“You’re so reliable!”\n“Huh?”\nWhat’s going on?\nAs if they had planned it, Dorothy and Amelia suddenly started having a conversation with each other.\n…Seriously, what? What’s happening?\n“We’ll go on ahead!”\n“Let’s go, Dorothy! If we just stand around, bad villains will be harassing citizens!”\n“That’s a big problem! We need to hurry!”\n“… They’re gone.”\nThe two who had separated from us instantly finished registering and left.\nSeeing that, Siwoo laughed as if it was absurd.\n“Arte Iris, Yu Siwoo. Confirmed as a pair. If you want to give up and re-select, you’re free to do so. If you want to re-select, please come to the faculty office.”\n“Ah, yes. Thank you.”\nI realized it only after the registration was finished, and I left with Siwoo.\nI was being ignorant.\n“It seems like those two have gotten really close.”\n“Gotten close?”\n“Yes. It looks like the two girls have somehow bonded.”\nRight, I must have forgotten an important fact.\nCome to think of it, they’re both girls, aren’t they?\nI don’t know how girls become friends, but they must have hit it off quickly through some method.\nStill, it’s a bit disappointing. Since they’re heroines, they should get closer to the Protagonist.\n…Well, they’ll get close soon. There’s plenty of time.\nUntil the end, I failed to notice Siwoo’s gaze, which seemed to say, “Aren’t you a girl too?”\n***\n(…Those two, you said they were heroines?)\n“That’s right.”\n(But why do they seem to have little interest in the Protagonist?)\n“I didn’t really pay attention since it didn’t seem necessary for me to intervene, and this is what happened.”\nThe pure girl said. As if it were only natural.\n“At first, I tried to use them as heroines, but…”\nShe recalled.\nHer precious Reader.\nThe appearance she had shown so far. And the events that occurred.\nRecalling the memories, the girl smiled brightly.\nIt was an innocent smile.\n“I thought about adding some since there was a lack of events, but it didn’t seem necessary after all!”\n(…Ah, you mean that Reader of yours?)\n“Yep! She’s not my Reader yet, but the Protagonist seems a bit drawn to her.”\n(Hmm…)\nThe girl watched the Reader conversing with the Protagonist.\nAt first, she had mainly observed the Protagonist, and events always revolved around him.\nThe Reader was just a convenient pawn. Nothing more, nothing less.\nBut before she knew it, the girl found herself becoming more interested in the Reader than the Protagonist.\nThe others were still observing the Protagonist since they were interested in him, but…\n‘Reader is so much more interesting.’\n(By the way, why doesn’t your ability work on that guy?)\n“Huh? Ability?”\n(Yes! Your ability! You said it doesn’t work, right?! Do you know how surprised we were?!)\n(You weren’t joking about that, were you?)\n“Hey, what do you take me for?”\n(You did it once before, so I’m just saying. I said I’d get really mad if you did it again.)\nAt the resounding voice, the girl smiling optimistically replied sheepishly.\n“I don’t know, really.”\n[…Seriously?]\n“Yeah. I was so surprised.”\nSurprised enough to nearly faint.\nThe others who heard that story felt the same way.\n‘I mean, a mere human who my ability doesn’t work on? That’s absurd.’\n[You said it worked at first, right?]\n“Yeah. There were quite a few similar worlds, but I liked that world. I put in some effort to set him as the Protagonist.”\n‘I picked a guy with a handsome face and tweaked him a bit to fit the worldview.’\nHis ability was intuition. She also gave him the setting of having tremendous talent that befits a protagonist.\n“Don’t you think the ability of intuition is kind of cool? It’s not visible, but it’s incredibly strong!”\n(That’s not what we were talking about, right?)\n“…Tch. No, well. It’s nothing much. It just happened. After that, my ability stopped working on him.”\nRight now, there are only two people in that world who her ability doesn’t work on.\nThe Reader and the Protagonist.\nMy ability works on all the other humans.\n“At least it half works on the Reader.”\n(That’s a side effect of you transmigrating that human, right?)\n“No, well. That’s… It can’t be helped. That’s what makes it interesting. Right?”\n(…)\nThe others couldn’t refute it.\nBecause they also found it interesting when an otherworldly soul brought from outside entered another world.\nEven the ones who initially said there was no need to go through such trouble quietly sealed their lips now.\n“I can understand the Reader since she’s aware of my existence.”\n‘But why doesn’t my ability work on the Protagonist?’\nIt’s not like it didn’t work from the beginning.\nIt was fine when she set him up.\nShe tried to tweak him for the first time in a while, but what used to work well suddenly didn’t, and she was so flustered.\nWithout thinking, she made an excuse to the readers, saying it was nothing.\nThose guys wouldn’t scold her for something like that, but she reflexively did it.\n“There’s no way my ability wouldn’t work unless he knows my existence.”\n(You set Yu Siwoo’s ability as intuition, right? Could he have noticed you with it?)\n“No, no. Absolutely not.”\nIntuition. It’s an ability to sense things humans can’t perceive, but…\nEven that has its limits.\n“He couldn’t even notice the Reader watching him, so how could he notice me?”\n(…Hmm, is that so?)\nYu Siwoo’s ability was intuition.\nThey knew that better than anyone.\n“You guys said intuition was too boring, so I added an extra setting, but someone said it was dangerous, so I tried to remove it, but it won’t go away.”\n(…)\n“I’ll do as I please now.”\n(Yeah, yeah… I have nothing to say.)\nSince intuition was boring, she briefly added a setting that it was a fragment of a superior ability.\nShe couldn’t even decide what ability it was. Since the ability wouldn’t grow much anyway, it was a setting she could modify, so she just threw it in there.\n‘I don’t know why, but my ability stopped working on Yu Siwoo, so I can’t remove it now.’\nIt was cool, but she kept getting berated for it.\n‘Because those guys who always told me what to do made a mistake!’\n(…Then what? Is he really some kind of mutant?)\n“I don’t know either.”\nIn the end, they gazed at the Reader without gaining anything.\nShe was conversing with the Protagonist and smiling with her eyes.\n“…Hehe, she’s pretty.”\n(Crazy bitch…)\n“What, why! She is pretty!”\nAuthor’s Notes\nThere are a lot of typos these days…\nI’m always looking up to the readers who point things out…\nI am grateful and embarrassed…!\nAnd the long-awaited 1M has been achieved! I’m so happy for the love from my readers!\nI’ve been thinking for a while about how I should repay this…\nWouldn’t it be nice to have one more Arte illustration?\nSo, I decided to apply for another cover today.",

      "content": "“Villain extermination, how should we go about it?”\n“Well…”\n“Is there a particular area you’d like to focus on?”\n“Not really.”\n“…A villain you’re especially keen on catching? Or an ability that seems tricky to deal with?”\n“Hmm, I’m not sure.”\n“Do you even want to do this?”\nArte narrowed her eyes, shooting Siwoo a look.\n‘I don’t think I’ll ever get used to those eyes.’\nThey’re pretty, but…\nSpine-chilling.\nEven he gets startled seeing them occasionally, so others must react the same way.\nOccasionally, when she shows her red eyes to other students, they all freak out.\nIn that sense, he’s fortunate.\nHe’s just momentarily surprised, but others can’t face them properly.\nLike a treasure buried in mud, you could say.\n“…What is it now? Suddenly staring at me.”\n“Oh, sorry.”\nIt’s certainly not a bright, cheery gaze.\nBut because of that, there’s an indescribable allure.\nSo, without thinking, he gazed at her for a long time without responding to what she said, and she seemed a bit annoyed.\n‘I should make an excuse.’\n“No, well. I thought we don’t need to go out of our way to worry about these things.”\n“…?”\n“We can take it easy, you know?”\nShe thinks he doesn’t know, but he knows she’s a member of Arachne.\nSince they were on the same team, making things difficult is unnecessary.\nIt’ll be enough just to catch the few villains they come across.\nIt’s natural not to be excited about the exam when you’re with someone who annihilated the Übermensch.\n‘And this may sound arrogant, but I think I’m a bit stronger than the other students.’\nUnless some huge dark horse emerges, that is.\nThe top ranks are basically guaranteed.\n“…Well, that may be true, but…”\n“Right? We don’t need to overthink it, I’m telling you.”\nHearing him say that seemed to convince her too. Her embarrassed smile was cute.\n‘But why is she trying to prepare so systematically? ‘\nWith her skills, she could easily snap a villain’s neck just by taking a short stroll in a back alley.\nNo matter how you look at it, Arachne seems to be an organization with considerable influence.\nBreaking into the academy, hacking the database, attacking the Übermensch, and so on.\nThat organization is behind so many incidents.\n‘I’m not sure what her rank is within Arachne, but it must be high.’\nBased on the conversations he overheard between her and the person she calls “Author,” Arachne’s information network is substantial.\nAmelia and he deduced that they were somehow divided into “field” and “office” workers.\nArte as the field agent, and “Author” as the office worker.\nThe Author gathers intel, and Arte carries out tasks based on the information she receives from them.\nThat’s why he planned to go along with whatever Arte suggested.\n‘…But then why is she asking me?’\nMoreover, she seems unusually eager.\n‘We could just go about normally and casually rack up points, which should be plenty, right?’\n“Can’t we catch plenty of villains without trying too hard?”\n“No.”\n“Huh?”\n“But we should aim for an overwhelming first place!”\n“…?”\n‘…I made an offhand comment, wondering if that might be the case, and she latched right onto it.’\nAs if she was desperate to obliterate villains.\nWas Arachne an organization that despised villains?\n‘I heard they brutally kill villains, earning cheers from citizens tormented by villains, but opinions are split among heroes.’\nSome sympathize, while others think it’s too cruel.\nThe heroes have also seen their share of the villains’ misdeeds.\nThey all likely assume there must be circumstances that drive them to such extremes.\nBut it seems opinions diverge when it comes to killing villains to stop them.\n“…”\nSiwoo’s chest felt heavy.\nArte is also a member of Arachne.\nThat means she must have her own circumstances too.\nJust what happened to make her express such hatred toward villains?\nThe thought that his friend had a dark past weighed on Siwoo.\nAnd it strengthened his resolve.\nHe wanted to create a society where she wouldn’t have to hunt villains.\nHis childhood dream of becoming a hero started taking a more concrete shape.\nIf only fewer people could be hurt by villains.\nIf only there were no more people taking the wrong path after being wounded again and again, like Arte.\n“…and to plan. Do you agree?”\n“Oh, uh?! Yeah. Sure.”\n“That’s great!”\nSiwoo was flustered.\nWhat did Arte say again?\nLost in thought, he didn’t hear what Arte was saying and absentmindedly agreed.\nIt shouldn’t be a big deal.\n…Alright. Even if Arte gets mad at him here, it can’t be helped.\n‘It’s my fault for not focusing on the conversation and letting my mind wander, so I need to ask what she was talking about, politeness be damned…’\n“Then I’ll see you at your house tomorrow morning! See you then!”\n“…Huh?”\n“Well then, get some good rest today!”\nArte got up from her seat.\n…Wait, hold on.\n‘My house? Whose?… Mine?’\nWhy?\nCold sweat trickled down.\nShe definitely said something to him. There must be some purpose behind specifically suggesting a meeting at his house.\nIf she told him directly, it shouldn’t be anything shady.\nShe’s an ordinary student to the outside world, so there’s no need to overthink it.\nBut why is she coming to his house?\nHe’s well aware that Arte lingers around his house.\nFinding her hiding spot has become part of his daily routine, so of course he knows.\n‘She’s gotten better at hiding than before, but my presence detection has also improved.’\n…No, that’s not the point!\n‘What is it? What reason would Arte have to come to my house?’\nThink, think. Yoo Siwoo. Rack your brain.\n‘…I have no idea!’\n“Arte…?”\n“Yes?”\nArte smiled slightly as if telling me to speak.\n… She’s pretty.\n“Seems like you have nothing to say. Then, see you tomorrow morning!”\n“…Oh no!”\nDarn it.\nHe was entranced.\nWhile he was staring blankly, captivated by her mischievous smile for a moment, Arte vanished.\nArte, you didn’t plan for this too, did you?\n‘…No way. I’m just being stupid.’\n“Sigh… This is bad. Really bad.”\nSiwoo muttered to himself even as he headed home.\n‘…Why on earth is Arte coming to my house?’\nNo matter how much he thought about it, he couldn’t come up with a reason.\nUnable to figure out a reason even after arriving home, Siwoo made a decision.\nHe wouldn’t show a single gap.\nHe never thought his house was that messy.\nBut glancing around, dust caught his eye.\nIf Arte came over with the house in this state…\n“Ah, this won’t do!”\nHe snapped to attention.\nThis can’t happen.\nFiguring out why Arte was coming could wait.\nIt was already set in motion. There was no undoing it.\nSo he decided to clean the house first.\n***\nAfter the house was turned upside down and looked somewhat neat even to Siwoo’s eyes,\nHis face grew even darker.\nThe cleaning was all done, but he found one item while cleaning that was a problem.\n“This is still here…”\nA black ball of thread exuded in front of Siwoo’s eyes.\nThe thread from Arte’s… that he ended up keeping last time.\nHe had meant to throw it away but apparently forgot to do so.\nWhat would Arte say if she saw this?\nWould she notice? If she did, what would her reaction be?\nNo matter how he thought about it, he couldn’t imagine a good reaction.\nIt made sense to him.\nA male student took thread made from a female student’s underwear and brought it home.\nEven he had to admit it was a bit much.\nThe problem was that the student was him.\n“…”\n‘Alright, let’s throw it.’\nIt wouldn’t be good if Arte saw it.\nSiwoo reached out to grab the ball of thread hiding in the corner of his house.\n“… It’s soft.”\nAnd he fiddled with the thread for a while.\nAfter enjoying the texture for some time, Siwoo realized what he had done.\nUndeniably perverted behavior.\nIf Arte had seen it, she would have looked at him with contempt.\nNo, this couldn’t be helped.\nEver since he passed out and woke up after receiving Dorothy’s buff, he felt like his ability had gotten stronger, and it was because of that.\nWhether it was a side effect or a benefit, he wasn’t sure…\nAs his intuition sharpened, his other senses became more sensitive too.\nHis senses, already more delicate than others, had intensified further.\nThat’s why he absentmindedly touched it, drawn to the soft texture, and meant nothing else by it. Really.\nSiwoo felt his nose itch and scratched it with his hand, then he realized.\n…It smells nice.\n_________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nI applied for a cover yesterday.\nThe outfit is an overfit short-sleeved top, napkin pants, and a ponytail?\nI asked them to emphasize the waist and nape of the neck.\nOf course, since this is the first draft, there may be some changes.\nI’m looking forward to it!",

      "content": "Ding-dong.\nA loud, ear-piercing sound echoed through the house.\nShe’s here.\nSiwoo was in the middle of taking everything out and organizing because no matter how much he cleaned, it just didn’t feel satisfactory.\nHe hurriedly shoved the cleaning tools in his hands and the items he was holding into a corner and headed to the front door.\n“Hello!”\n“Hey, you’re early.”\n“Am I?”\nSiwoo tensed up at the sight of Arte’s beaming smile.\nIt was the first time he had a girl over at his place.\nIf only he hadn’t absentmindedly agreed, Arte wouldn’t have had a reason to come inside.\n“I felt it when I took a peek last time, but your house is really nice!”\n“You… No, well. I guess. It’s not bad.”\nHe suppressed the words that threatened to spill out.\n‘You’re always looking, aren’t you? Didn’t you come in today after monitoring the area?’\nWhat kind of reaction would she have if he said that?\nNo matter how much he thought about it, he couldn’t imagine a good response.\nThat’s why Siwoo couldn’t tell Arte he had noticed her surveillance.\nIt was probably a secret he’d have to keep for life.\n“By the way, your house is quite clean? Don’t tell me you have mysophobia or something?”\n“No, nothing like that. Just, you know…”\nHe couldn’t say he had turned the house upside down after hearing Arte was coming over, so he chose to gloss over it.\nFortunately, Arte seemed uninterested and was busy looking around the room.\n“Oh, are there any places I shouldn’t go?”\n“It’s a house where I live alone, so. Just be careful with my closet. There’s nothing special.”\n“… There’s no way that’s true?”\n“What is?”\nThe closet is a bit iffy because of underwear and such, but it wasn’t because of that.\nHe had no idea what kind of fantasy she harbored about a male academy student’s solo living space.\nHe didn’t have a maid like Arte, nor was he a part of a secret organization.\nHe was just an ordinary student.\n“No, that’s… Then the computer…?”\n“I don’t mind.”\n“Hmm… Strange…”\nSiwoo heard Arte muttering softly.\nHer comment piqued his curiosity.\nWhy on earth does she find it strange?\nUnable to contain his curiosity, Siwoo ended up asking Arte.\n“Strange? What is?”\n“…Oh, it’s nothing. Just, since you said it’s fine to look at everything except the closet.”\nWhat’s the problem with that?\nSiwoo decided not to press her, who was stalling and delaying her answer, and wait patiently.\nAfter a bit of time passed, Arte, unable to bear Siwoo’s gaze any longer, responded to him.\n“Well… I thought there might be things you wouldn’t want to show others.”\n“…?”\n“It, it’s okay if you don’t know! Would it be alright if I use the bathroom for a moment?!”\n“Oh, sure. It’s over there.”\nWatching Arte hurriedly take refuge in the bathroom, he thought to himself.\n‘What’s the issue here?’\n“…Author-nim. Is Siwoo a eunuch?”\n“?!”\nWhat?!\nAt the absurd question, Siwoo unconsciously turned his head towards the bathroom.\nHe wondered why she suddenly went to the bathroom, but it was because she wanted to talk to this person called “Author.”\nBut why on earth would she ask about that of all things?\n‘…Why is she asking if I’m…if I have that or not?’\n“If Siwoo is normal, it would only be natural for him to have an item or two he can’t show to a female friend.”\n“…”\nAh.\nSiwoo finally realized why Arte had asked such a question.\nShe was trying to be considerate.\nShe was being thoughtful to avoid a situation where she might inadvertently see something in the house and feel embarrassed.\nThe thoughtfulness warmed his heart for a moment.\nBut Siwoo was soon captivated by her voice coming through again.\n“Yes, yes. He’s probably not a eunuch… Right, that’s impossible.”\nWhy is she asking such questions in the first place?\nWhat reason could there possibly be to ask about his sexual functionality to someone presumed to be her informant?\nThe Amelia and Dorothy in his head whispered to him.\n[It’s because she loves you~]\n[She’s wondering if you’ll be able to have children after getting married~]\nKwang!\n“Is something wrong?!”\n“So, sorry! My hand slipped for a second.”\n“Oh, okay.”\nIs it because he’s been listening to Amelia’s love stories too closely for too long?\nHe felt like he was starting to resemble Amelia’s way of thinking.\nNonsense.\nHe didn’t know why Arte was visiting his house, but she came in with a purpose.\nHe didn’t know why she suddenly asked about his… ability, but there must be another reason.\n‘Get out of my head, Amelia!’\n“Phew… Should I say this is fortunate or unfortunate?”\nHe could hear Arte mumbling.\nEven though he didn’t want to hear any more of Arte’s words, they kept reaching his ears.\nIs it because there’s usually little noise since he lives alone?\nIt felt like the voice of the first female friend to enter his house was drilling into his ears.\nWith his ability enhancing his senses, he had no choice but to hear Arte’s voice even if he didn’t want to.\n“I wanted to find out what his taste is.”\n“?!”\n‘Why my taste?!’\nThe Amelia in his head chattered noisily.\nWhat on earth is going on?\nSiwoo was confused.\n***\n“Oh, sorry I took long.”\n“It, it’s nothing.”\n…Why is he acting like that?\nI tilted my head at Siwoo’s strange reaction.\nDid something happen? I heard a loud noise earlier too.\nLeaving the creaking Siwoo behind, I moved my feet and let out a small sigh.\nSince I came to the protagonist’s house, I wanted to secretly open the stash that every man should have.\nI was going to pretend to be considerate, secretly discover the location, then sneakily discover it and tell the heroines.\nBut I failed because the protagonist didn’t understand the meaning.\nThat’s why I momentarily thought he was a eunuch. I was startled.\nWhat if the protagonist who’s supposed to end up with the heroine is one?\nThankfully, the Author said that’s not the case, so there are no problems.\n[I’m a bit curious too. What kind of taste does he have?]\nWhy on earth is the Author’s knowledge about the protagonist full of holes?\nHow come you know he’s not a eunuch but don’t know his taste?\n…Putting that aside, there’s one thing I want.\nFor him to have normal tastes.\nIf his tastes are a bit icky, it’ll be hard for the heroines to match him.\n“…Hm? What’s this?”\n“That, why is that… Did I forget to put it away…?”\nEntering Siwoo’s bedroom, an object rolling on the floor caught my eye.\nIt was a black ball of thread wound into a circular shape.\n“Oh, it’s soft.”\n“Is, is it?”\n“Yes. Hmm, this texture. It feels familiar somehow.”\nIt felt even more intriguing because the sensation was similar to the leotard I was wearing.\nAs I was feeling the soft texture with my fingertips, I noticed Siwoo breaking out in a cold sweat.\n…Aha.\n“I’m sorry.”\n“Huh? What, what are you…?”\n“I was being insensitive.”\nI handed the ball of thread to Siwoo.\nTo Siwoo, who was looking at me with questioning eyes, I said with a smile,\n“I didn’t mean to tease you.”\n“Huh?”\nSiwoo had a more feminine hobby than I thought.\nKnitting.\nThat’s a rare hobby.\nHe must have been awfully embarrassed about getting caught by me.\nSeeing him sweating like this.\n“I don’t mind it.”\nWhether Siwoo knits or plays games.\nI won’t care about anything.\nExcept for things like him fooling around with some extras.\n[Hmm… I feel like I’ve seen this color somewhere…?]\nI could hear the Author talking nonsense.\nBlack is everywhere.\nI wanted to criticize her but couldn’t since the protagonist was before me. I gave him a small smile.\nThis should be fine, right?\nI had no intention of nitpicking someone’s hobby.\nWell, he can enjoy knitting a bit.\nAt this rate, Siwoo would feel awkward, so should I change the subject?\n“It’s a bit early, but shall we start getting ready?”\n“Huh?”\n“Hey, why are you acting like that? Why do you think I came here?”\n“That, that’s…”\nSiwoo was just stammering and didn’t seem inclined to do it.\nHmm, how frustrating. I feel bad for taking his time, so I want to finish quickly.\n“What are you doing? Hurry up and take it off.”\n“What?!”\n“If you don’t take it off, I’ll strip you myself.”\n“Eek?! Ah, Arte! Stop! Please!”\n***\n“…What do you think this says?”\n“I will stand in the sky.”\n“Then what’s this sound?”\n“…A toad croaking?”\n“Then this? Try eating it.”\n“Ugh, what, what the heck is this?!”\n“I tried mixing mint, tabasco, cheese, and caramel. Can you feel the spice?”\n“I can, but that makes it even worse!”\n“Hmm, I see… What about this smell?”\n“Vanilla?”\nSiwoo blankly stared at Arte, who was moving nonstop.\nWhen she told him to take off his clothes, he was startled, wondering what on earth she was talking about.\nBut the reason was completely different from what he had thought.\n“What exactly is intuition?”\n“…Who knows? Isn’t it just intuition?”\n“I get that it’s the sixth sense…”\nArte said this was the reason she came.\nWhat exactly is his ability? She said she wanted to know.\nHe thought it was just intuition, but Arte said that wasn’t it.\nShe said it doesn’t explain why his other senses are so keen if it’s just intuition.\nSo, she wanted to experiment with it.\nShe said she told me to remove his clothes to test his sense of touch.\n“…But Arte. Was it really necessary to take off clothes?”\n“Did I tell you to strip naked? You just need to take off your top.”\n“Ugh…”\nBlindfolds and earplugs from who knows where, a bizarre object to stick in the nose, and a candy to hold in the mouth.\nFinally, some kind of liquid smeared all over the back.\nConstantly changing items, Arte was testing me on something.\n“Ack, stay still for a bit, will you?”\n“No, that’s… Um…”\n“This part should have numbed sensations, so why are you flinching with…?”\n‘Your chest is touching… Your chest!’\nSiwoo bent his waist as much as possible and subtly moved his body to block Arte’s vision.\n_______________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nAlright, I’m coming out.\nI like TS.\nThank you.",

      "content": "“I have no idea!”\nArte answered cheerfully.\nShe had been looking forward to experimenting with various things for a while.\n“… You’re answering quite bluntly, Arte.”\n“Well, that’s because I really didn’t figure anything out.”\nArte said as she wiped her sticky hands with water.\n“Did you feel anything when all your senses were blocked?”\n“No, I didn’t feel anything.”\n“But you dodged my attacks?”\n“Yeah.”\n“…”\nSiwoo avoided her dumbfounded gaze.\nHe knows full well that it doesn’t make sense.\nBut he just knew what was happening.\nHe instinctively felt what was dangerous, even if he couldn’t perceive through the senses.\nSimilar to what he felt under Dorothy’s buff.\nHe’s not sure what it is, but if there’s one thing certain,\nIt’s that his ability had room to grow further.\nHe was flustered but decided to follow Arte’s instructions for now…\n‘You don’t know, huh?’\nHe had some expectations.\n“Alright. Well, it can’t be helped. Since we’re roughly done, you can put your clothes back on.”\n“Oh, okay. I’ll go take a quick shower and come back.”\n“Go ahead.”\nHe headed to the bathroom to wash off the strange medicine that had gotten smeared all over his body at some point.\nSiwoo knew best the reason why Arte found it strange.\nEven now, he had no sensation of his body. He was just a head floating in space.\nBut he was still walking properly.\n“Phew…”\nThe sensation of water pouring all over his body started to return bit by bit.\nThere are more than a couple of strange things about my ability.\n‘Arte probably doesn’t know since I haven’t told anyone…’\nBecause every time he received Dorothy’s buff, he felt something new.\nThat spine-chilling presence he felt when battling Arte.\n‘What was that, I wonder? I still don’t know what it is.’\nAt first, he thought he was mistaken or his ability malfunctioned.\nSince Dorothy’s enhancement is so powerful, the side effects are quite severe.\nHe thought maybe his complicated feelings towards Arte were amplified and strange. That’s what he was thinking,\nBut he felt it again during the raid on the academy.\nThere was no problem with him and Dorothy.\nThen what was the issue? Why did he feel that sensation towards Arte?\n“… It’s not like Arte has a ghost attached to her or something, right?”\nNo, that can’t be.\nSiwoo couldn’t explain the reason at all.\nBut it didn’t feel right to ask Arte either.\nDo you have a ghost attached to you?\nSaying that might make him seem like a lunatic.\nBut she is kind-hearted, so she probably wouldn’t say that.\n“Putting aside that unpleasant something…”\nThe second enhancement.\nThat was even weirder.\nIt was to the point where he couldn’t call it intuition anymore.\nYes, what he felt during Dorothy’s first enhancement could be explained as intuition.\nSince he felt something.\nBut the second one, that inexplicable sensation during the raid…\nThat strange feeling as if he saw his future self.\nWhat was that?\n“I don’t know.”\nSiwoo admitted. That thing back then couldn’t be called intuition.\nFar from being a sixth sense, it was like…\n“If I just put my mind to it…”\nRight.\nA sense of omnipotence enveloped his entire body as if he could figure out anything if he just put his mind to it.\nFinding out what lies at the end of a forked path and walking towards where he wants to go. That kind of feeling.\nIt was a jumbled explanation, but Siwoo wasn’t confident he could explain it any better.\nSince he had acted on instinct, even recalling it hurt his head.\n“…Should I ask to be enhanced one more time?”\nAt that time, he had done it forcefully because he felt like he was really going to die, so it was questionable whether she would agree. Still, Siwoo decided to ask Dorothy for enhancement one more time.\nIt was because he became curious about his ability.\nThe ability to reach an existence unimaginably above him, even though it was enhanced.\n‘…I feel like I’m forgetting something?’\n“Eek, cold?!”\nStartled by the suddenly returning sensation, Siwoo hastily turned off the water.\nIt seemed his senses had returned at some point while he was lost in thought.\n“Brr, it’s cold…”\nPerhaps it was because his senses hadn’t returned, so he had been absent-mindedly letting the cold water hit him.\nSiwoo came out of the bathroom, shivering.\n“…?”\n‘What is it, this smell?’\nAt some point, a pleasant smell stimulating the sense of smell had spread throughout the house.\n“Oh, are you done with your shower?”\n“Gah?! Ah, Arte! Why are you here?!”\n“Oh, I thought you were done with your shower… Why are you so surprised?”\n‘Because you suddenly popped up!’\nFortunately, he was fully dressed, but if he hadn’t been…\nPushing the terrible imaginary scenario aside, he asked Arte,\n“You startled me… So, Arte. What’s up?”\n“No, I was just wondering if you had eaten.”\n“I haven’t?”\nWhy is she suddenly asking about that?\nIn the first place, Arte wouldn’t need to ask him that.\nDoesn’t she already know what he’s doing?\nAs if confirming his guess, Arte immediately made a suggestion to him.\n“Then would you like to have a meal?”\n“…Huh?”\n“I thought it would be rude to come empty-handed. I cooked a little. I hope using the kitchen wasn’t impolite?”\nArte said with a beaming smile, and he finally realized.\nAh, she was cooking.\nBut there weren’t really any ingredients to cook with in the house?\n‘…I don’t know. She must have gotten them from somewhere.’\n…Then he realized something\n‘How did she know the location of my kitchen? Where did she get the seasonings and ingredients…?’\nHe decided not to dwell on it.\nShe must have figured it out somehow. If it’s Arte, she could do that.\n“Yeah. Sure.”\n“That’s a relief!”\nSurely it won’t be steak again today.\nWhen Arte cooks, she always makes steak for some reason.\nIt’s an expensive and delicious dish, but…\nHe had this odd feeling because it seemed like she made steak every time they met.\nAnd it just has to be cubed.\n“Since it’s breakfast, I made scrambled eggs and toast for an easy meal.”\n“I see. Sounds delicious.”\n“Feel free to look forward to it.”\n‘So she doesn’t just eat steak all the time.’\nSince she made steak every time she cooked, he was starting to think that maybe that was all she knew how to make.\nIgnoring Amelia, who was noisily chattering in his head again, Siwoo headed to the living room.\n‘It’s been a really long time since someone made me a meal.’\n***\n“…Oh, it’s delicious.”\nWatching Siwoo exclaim in admiration, I started eating the dish before me.\nSoft-textured eggs and crispy toast.\nMm, it turned out well.\nI was worried since I’d never seen Siwoo use the toaster.\nFortunately, it seemed to have turned out fine without any issues.\n“You’re good at cooking.”\n“Huh? Well, I guess so. When I was young, I cooked a little…”\n“I see.”\nSaying that, Siwoo didn’t pry further and started eating again.\nAs expected of the protagonist, should I say?\nThe fact that he didn’t deliberately touch on a sensitive subject was appealing.\nI didn’t want to talk about things from the past.\nI don’t know how he knew, but he naturally avoided an awkward topic.\nI didn’t want to think about my life before coming here.\nSince it only made me feel depressed the more I thought about it when it was uncertain if I could even go back.\n[In the end, we couldn’t determine his ability…]\nYou can say that again.\nThe Author made me rush to Siwoo’s house to figure out his ability.\nIt seemed she couldn’t even get a sense of what it was.\nI thought that would be the case.\nWhy did I expect anything different?\nBut well, thanks to the Author, it wasn’t like there was no gain.\nBecause I could legally check out the inside of Siwoo’s house.\nIt was a bit disappointing that I couldn’t find out his taste…\nThere was a limit to figuring out the interior through the window.\nHis bedroom was usually covered by curtains.\nWith this, if something happens to the house, I can rescue him faster.\n“So, is that all?”\n“…Hmm, I wonder. There is something more I’d like to do.”\n“Something you want to do?”\n“Spar with you.”\nEven though Siwoo has gotten much stronger than before, I still don’t know how much stronger he’s become.\nI want to experience it firsthand. I want to fight him at least once.\n“I don’t mind.”\n“Great. Then, after resting a bit…”\nShall we have a sparring match?\nThe moment I was about to say that, news flowed out from the TV that was left on.\n– Breaking news. It seems Arachne, whose activities had been quiet recently, has resumed its activities. Amidst rapidly worsening public opinion for targeting civilians instead of villains…\n“…?”\nWhat is this about?\nFor a moment, I almost couldn’t process the content of the news.\nArachne was active?\nWithout telling me? There’s no way.\nI told them not to touch civilians, so there can’t be anyone who violated that.\nLyla? Spira? Or Lee Ha-Yul?\nWho is it? Who’s the culprit?\n“…I thought it was about time for them to show up.”\n“For what?”\nSiwoo said while watching the news and drinking coffee.\n“Well, they’re famous. Isn’t it time for copycats to appear since Arachne’s activities have been scarce lately?”\n“…Copycats.”\n“If someone draws the symbol on the wall and commits a crime, they can pin it on Arachne, right? Arachne’s activities have been infrequent these days too.”\nHmm.\nI see. Copycats.\nI had forgotten about that possibility.\n“I’m sorry. I have something to take care of for a bit. How about we have that sparring match another time?”\n“Sure. Take care.”\nLooks like I suddenly got more work.\n___________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nRuminas, have a good evening!",

      "content": "[I wanted to see the protagonist’s house more…]\nThe Author’s voice was heard, complaining in a deflated tone.\nShe wanted to observe the protagonist’s house more?\nBut it couldn’t be helped.\n“I’m sorry, Author-nim. Something urgent came up, so can you please understand?”\n[Hiiing…]\n“We can visit again next time. Let’s take our time and check it out then.”\n[…Okay!]\nConsoling her wasn’t that difficult.\nWe can just visit again next time, right?\nI also wanted to understand the structure one more time properly.\nI was also interested in how Siwoo lived his life.\nFortunately, the Author understood that I had to leave urgently.\n[But copycats… It’s unforgivable!] (TN: If you scrape this, hi. ^~^)\n“Is that so?”\nShe began to get very angry at the impersonator.\nStill, I thought she was considerate of me.\nJust as I was about to feel a little better, the Author’s next words instantly dampened my mood.\n[Of course! It’s a cool secret organization! How dare they impersonate it…!]\n“…Ah, yes.”\nRight, of course.\n…I had completely forgotten that the Author had a childlike personality.\nShe wasn’t angry because she thought of me, but simply because our cool organization was being impersonated.\nWell, whatever. Now’s not the time to dwell on that.\nEven if it was an organization created on impulse, I am still Arachne’s leader.\nManaging the organization is also my responsibility.\nAs soon as I arrived home, I clapped my hands to gather my subordinates.\n“Oh, Arte, my beloved Mas…”\n“Welcome back, Arte. You’re a bit early?”\n“Yes, well. That’s how it turned out.”\nIt seemed like they had also become quite close after spending some time.\nLyla, who covered Spira’s mouth as she was about to say something, smiled and spoke to me.\nAh, right.\nI wonder if these guys also know?\n“Did you watch the news?”\n“News?… What’s that?”\n“It seems like you haven’t seen it. Alright. Then let’s all watch it together.”\nWe gathered cozily with investigator Ha-Yul, who followed me and looked at the news.\n“This is…”\n“Arachne killed civilians?”\n“Have you taken any actions by any chance?”\n“No! No! I haven’t done anything! I’m innocent!”\n“I’m not interrogating you.”\nLyla is always the same.\nThe ability to do anything to survive.\nI knew very well that it was her personality from watching her all this time, but…\n“… I’m not involved either. I’m too busy watching this one.”\n“This one?! Wha, what did I do?!”\n“Put your hand on your chest and think about it, you useless snake. Arte, is it too early for snake alcohol?”\n“Can you get it?”\n“Yeah, sure thing.”\n“?!”\nLyla must have noticed how flustered Spira got last time when I threatened to force-feed her snake alcohol.\nIt seemed like Lyla realized that threats were necessary to handle Spira.\n…No, wait. That’s not it.\n“What about you, Investigator Ha-Yul?”\n“…I’msorryI’msorryI’msorryI’msorryI’msorryI’msorryI’msorryI’msorry!”\n“?”\nOh my.\nThe two who were bickering and I slowly distanced ourselves from Ha-Yul, who was muttering something at a fast pace.\n“It’s unforgivable! How dare they harm civilians under the name of Arachne!”\n“…Uh, yeah. I guess so.”\nI knew better than anyone that Investigator Ha-Yul would never kill civilians.\nAfter all, I was the one who brought the justice-filled investigator into the organization.\nI asked the Author to create an unfortunate past accident to bring him in.\nI thought I couldn’t bring him in without going that far.\nThe Association, they’re quite capable…\n“We must find them and make them pay for their sins! The price for borrowing our name is death!”\n“…Uh, yeah. I got it, so can you calm down a bit?”\nWas the method I used too effective?\nHis sense of justice twisted in a strange direction, and he began to blindly follow Arachne.\nWell, it’s a good thing for me, but…\nHow should I put it… I feel like such trash…\nI’m not some cult leader, you know.\n“Then I’ll take it as no one has taken any action.”\n“…Well, that’s right.”\n“I didn’t do anything!”\n“Of course!”\nLyla, who seems to find everything bothersome.\nSpira, who keeps looking at others’ reactions.\nAnd Ha-Yul, who looks like he wants me to give orders.\nI looked at the three of them.\n…I had planned to kill these guys.\nHow did we end up living under the same organization, under the same roof?\nA momentary whim, a sense of pity.\nIt was hard to watch the existence of those I had spared, moved by emotions I shouldn’t have felt.\nIt was like watching the daily life of puppets moving behind the stage.\nI didn’t need to know their personalities, hobbies, and trivial information.\nDid the puppets I had killed also live like this behind the stage?\n…No, no. Let’s not think about it.\nI didn’t need to know the inside story of the extras.\n“Alright, everyone. Then it would be good to teach a lesson to those who tarnished our name.”\n“As you command.”\n“Shall we start by gathering information first?”\nI’ll try not to borrow the Author’s hand as much as possible.\nWhenever she acts, I inevitably realize that this world is false.\nI realize that a single gesture can turn everyone’s life upside down, except Siwoo and me.\n[Teach them a lesson, Reader-nim!]\n“Come on, let’s teach the impersonators a lesson.”\nEven if the Author didn’t say it, I was full of intentions to show them who they messed with.\nHow dare they interfere with the opportunity to find out more about Siwoo.\nAnd even if it was an organization created unintentionally, how dare they impersonate Arachne.\nHow should I torment them?\n“Mwahaha, ahaha…”\n“Wow, that laugh is scary…”\n“Shut up, Spira.”\n***\n“How is it?”\n“No one suspects a thing. Stupid fools.”\nSeveral burly men gathered in a dark alley and started laughing and chatting.\nAs if boasting about the merits they had established, they were eager to brag about what crimes they had committed.\n“Even if you kill a few people, no one suspects it if you claim they were a villain!”\n“Even if you rob a store and steal valuables, all you need to do is draw well.”\nStories of killing people. Stories of stealing things and running away.\nBoasting their respective exploits, they ridiculed the people.\n“If it’s something done by Arachne, they mistakenly think it’s a crime committed against villains without a doubt!”\n“The investigative authorities also seem to have that impression. Stupid bastards.”\n“Thanks to Arachne. Isn’t this a windfall?”\nThey are scum.\nThey are villains, but very weak ones.\nThe reason they can commit crimes openly, barely being underlings of criminal organizations, is simple.\n“These days, the income is also pretty good.”\n“That’s because we all share it.”\nAn organization that dominated the area vanished.\nNo, perhaps they might have dominated more than half the country.\nAnd they were wiped off the map.\nIt’s only natural that the remaining villains, oppressed by them, start to raise their heads.\nThe hyenas couldn’t miss the huge corpse that suddenly appeared.\n“Why even commit crimes? Arachne will punish you.”\n“Right? Hehehe. Fools.”\nThe number of crimes committed by villains has plummeted since the emergence of Arachne.\nThat was clear from any statistic, and that’s why Arachne was praised by the citizens.\nTo the citizens, they were an organization that dealt with bad guys.\n…But they are not always accurate.\nAs Arachne’s activities dwindled, some guys who used their heads appeared.\nIf Arachne is a bunch that executes villains, then we can just become ‘one’ of them.\nThey attempted impersonation based on that simple idea.\nThat action was quite effective.\nIf you just draw a crimson spider emblem and run away, the victim is suspected of being a villain instead.\n“Ah, it’s really funny. Right?”\n“I know. Did you guys see that face?”\n“I saw it! That expression of injustice! Khuhu…!”\nJust being targeted by Arachne is enough for the victim to be suspected.\nMaybe they were a villain before.\nOr maybe they were someone who had some kind of deal with a villain.\nSuch suspicions spread, and the victims had to either claim their innocence or keep their mouths shut for a long time.\nEven if they realize the victim is innocent and restart the investigation to find the real culprit, it’s too late.\nThey’ve already been on the run for a long time.\nThey didn’t have to worry about getting caught by the real Arachne because their activities had become infrequent.\n“Hail Arachne!”\n“Hahaha! What are you doing that?”\n“What? Isn’t this natural? They’re the ones who made our fortunes.”\n“Is that so? Hehehe. Should I try it too? Hail Arachne!”\nThe hyenas laughed.\nIn a world without lions, hyenas flourish.\nSo why isn’t it a hyena’s world?\nBecause the noise will wake the sleeping lion.\nSure, here is the translation of the text in the image:\n__________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nThe sound of the wind is scary…\nReaders, please don’t get hurt…",

      "content": "“Now, please state your name and age.”\n“Hiii?! S-Spare me! Please spare me!”\n“Don’t worry. We won’t harm you. What did you do here? Did anyone nearby see you?”\n“A-Arachne, I’ve done nothing?!”\n“…Sigh.”\nHa-Yul, who let out a sigh, turned into a mist.\nNot long after the mist entered the man’s body, his eyes rolled back.\n“Did you kill him?”\n“No. I knocked him out. Even I don’t kill recklessly, and this guy’s only a minor offender.”\n“Oh, right…”\nI thought he would have definitely killed him.\nIt seemed like I wasn’t the only one who thought that, as Spira and Lyla’s eyes were also filled with questions.\nI’m not sure what his criteria is.\nI thought he wanted to kill all criminals, but it seemed like he had his own standards.\n…Well, that’s not what’s important right now.\n“Arachne’s reputation is really bad here.”\n“Of course. It’s understandable.”\n“Those bastards who speak ill of Arte’s organization! They should all be killed…!”\nHere we go again.\nI lightly ignored Spira, who began to flatter me while watching my reaction.\nIt’s not the first or second time she’s done this.\nDoing this every day, I can’t even look at her favorably.\n…But she seemed unaware of that fact.\n“Plunder, robbery, fraud, assault. They’ve committed all sorts of crimes? Except for murder. Maybe they thought it would be dangerous if they went that far.”\n“You don’t seem to be in a good mood?”\n“…Well, that’s right. I’m also a member here, after all. Even though I was forced to join…”\nLyla’s emotions seemed a bit complicated as she said that.\nIt seemed like she had long given up on returning to her original life…\nHad she already gotten used to group life?\nShe seemed quite uncomfortable with the fact that people were impersonating Arachne.\n“…What about you, Arte?”\n“Me?”\n“You’re the boss of the organization, right?”\nHmm, yes.\nIf you ask if I’m in a good or bad mood, I can definitely say it’s bad.\nTo the extent that I rushed over here upon hearing the news about them.\nI thought I just had the mindset of teaching those annoying guys a lesson.\n…But it seemed like I was wrong.\nIt’s much more unpleasant than I thought.\nI felt it as I wandered around the areas where those guys were active.\nThe fact that there aren’t many favorable opinions towards the organization.\nOf course, Arachne is a criminal organization. I knew that very well.\nAn organization that goes around killing people can’t be a normal one.\nEven if they make deals with the association behind the scenes, they’re still a group of criminals. That fact is undeniable.\n…But even if it’s a criminal organization, it’s one I created.\nEven if I had no particular affection for it.\nEven if it was an organization I created lightly without much thought, in the end, it’s made up of people I took in.\n“They must pay the price, right?”\n“…Is that so?”\n“Yes. The sin of daring to impersonate is great.”\n***\n“…Hmm, I see.”\n“Yeah. They’re probably impersonators.”\n“Okay. I’ll let my dad know.”\nSiwoo relayed the news about Arte to Amelia.\nArte didn’t come to school today, saying she wasn’t feeling well, so the two talked comfortably.\nUnlike usual, this semester’s midterm exams were scheduled in a unique way. Hence, no one paid attention even if students were absent.\nEven in the classroom, students were sparsely missing.\nThey probably went to earn points.\nSo, it seemed like Arte also felt comfortable skipping school.\n“By the way, you really…”\n“What is it again.”\n“No, it’s nothing.”\nHe thinks he knows what Amelia wants to say.\n‘Why didn’t you do anything after bringing her into your house? Are you impotent?’\nSomething like that.\nAmelia always talked that way.\nHe decided just to ignore it.\nThat’s how Amelia always comes to strange conclusions.\n“The places Arte is likely to go…”\n“What, are you going to go?”\n“You’re not?”\n“Even if you do, you’ll only be asked why you’re there, right? How are you going to explain that? Besides, most of the impersonators are minor offenders.”\n“…Minor offender?”\nAmelia began to explain to him.\nBringing up a story she heard from her father.\n“Suppose there’s an extremely strong guy. This guy is either mentally damaged enough to commit crimes or is rebelling against society.”\n“Uh-huh.”\n“Do you think such a guy would hide under someone else’s shadow?”\nMost villains don’t do that.\n“They might hide their own crimes, but there are rare cases where they frame someone else.”\n“…I see.”\n“Yeah. They have neither pride nor strength. Only those without either would do that. For example…”\nAfter confirming they weren’t interested in the conversation, Amelia suddenly looked around at the students, came close to me, and whispered softly.\n“You know that criminal. The one you fought…”\n“That wind ability user?”\n“Shhh…! Be careful when you say that! Everyone has bad memories when it comes to wind. Some kids got hurt by the fact that they were knocked out with one attack.”\nAfter hurriedly looking around and confirming that no one had heard the conversation, she hit his back.\n“Anyway. The person you faced also attacked with some purpose in mind. You know this too.”\n“Ah, you’re talking about that?”\nSiwoo recalled the image of that grayish woman.\nShe instructed the woman next to her to head towards something.\nAt that time, he was just happy that he could stay standing.\nNow that everything is over, he could understand.\n‘Because I interfered. Because I prevented her from entering the academy.’\nThat’s why she achieved half success.\nA missing executive and stolen artifact.\nAs soon as he heard that story, she came to mind.\nBased on the amount of blood loss, the woman presumed to be the boss was dead.\nBut her follower didn’t die and survived. She survived with the artifact.\nShe achieved her goal, but she herself died.\nThat’s why it was a half-success.\n“That person wanted to change society with the artifact in the secret room.”\n“Change society?”\n“Yeah. They gathered information from the blood stains on the floor and found the hideout… They discovered it. The memoirs of the academy’s founder.”\n“What?!”\n“I told you to be quiet…!”\nHe hurriedly shut his mouth, and as the gathered gazes dispersed, he let out a sigh of relief.\nSiwoo tried to be quiet.\nBut how could he not be surprised?\nThe memoirs of the academy’s founder… that’s something from hundreds of years ago.\nIt was an item that would be found in a museum.\n“S-So? What was written in it?”\n“Well, that… I didn’t hear the exact details. They said it was too dangerous. But they said it was a dangerous object that could change the world…”\n“A dangerous object that could change the world…?”\n“Where have I heard that before?”\nThe reason Amelia met Siwoo.\nWasn’t it because she overheard something Arte was muttering?\nAt that time, Arte said something that could change the world was kept in the secret room.\n“The story got a bit off track. Anyway, the big shots usually have such a purpose. In my opinion, that villain probably wanted to do something with it.”\n“…Yeah, I think so too.”\n“But look. If you impersonate someone else, you can’t pursue that goal, right?”\nWhen you impersonate, you entrust your identity and goals as a villain to someone else.\nThat’s why there’s no need to go.\n“That’s why those who impersonate are usually scum.”\n“I understand.”\n“…But why does it seem like you don’t? I’m telling you, you don’t have to go? You don’t even know where Arte went.”\n“I don’t know. But I’m going to go.”\nWhat Amelia said made sense.\nArte is probably acting as Arachne, and if so, he wouldn’t be of any help.\nRather than moving and receiving suspicion, waiting would be wiser.\nHer words were a hundred times correct.\nBut he decided to head to where Arte was.\n“That’s just a guess, isn’t it?”\n“…Huh?”\n“I also understood what you said, that most impersonators aren’t that powerful or important.”\nHe understood what Amelia said.\nHe didn’t know the details, but it’s probably right. Her father is a current top-tier hero.\nIt might have even come out in statistics.\nBut still, he decided to head to where Arte was.\n“What if the impersonator this time isn’t a minor offender?…What if it’s an action taken to target Arachne?”\n“There’s no way. Who would do such a crazy thing? They’re a group that massacred hundreds of villains gathered under such an oppressive organization.”\n“I know that the probability of that is low, so there’s no reason for me to go.”\nIt’s not rational. Siwoo knew that very well.\nBut still.\nEven if it’s an irrational and stupid choice.\nSiwoo decided to follow Arte.\n“You, that was a lie just now, wasn’t it?”\nShe’s quick.\nWhy was she really perceptive at times like this?\n“Tell me honestly. Why do you want to go?”\n“She’s a friend.”\nHe answered her question without a moment’s hesitation.\nIt was a question that didn’t even need hesitation.\n“At first, I thought she was someone I had to stop, and I still think that way. But she’s a friend.”\n“…”\n“If Arte is walking down a bad path and seems to be taking such actions again…”\nHe hoped that Arte would no longer stain her hands with blood.\nBecause he saw her surprisingly fragile side in person.\nBecause he got a glimpse of her true feelings.\n“I have to help my friend walk the right path.”",

      "content": "“Is this the place?”\nAs Siwoo looked around, a scene that was hard to believe was from the same city was revealed.\nThe outdated facilities and buildings created an eerie atmosphere.\nIf there weren’t people wandering around, it could pass for a ghost town.\nIs it because it’s a city recently liberated from monsters?\n“Wow, even people live in a place like this…”\nAmelia also began to look around with eyes mixed with curiosity and pity.\nPeople walking on the street began to glare at them.\n‘Do they realize we’re outsiders from her reaction?’\n“Wh-What is it? Why?”\n“…Sigh. I’m sorry.”\nAfter apologizing to the passersby, Siwoo said bitter words to Amelia.\n“People here don’t like people like us very much, so be careful. I heard the public safety isn’t very good.”\n“Wh-What? They’re not superhumans, so there’s no way they could have heard my voice from that distance.”\n“Well, that may be true, but your appearance isn’t like that.”\n“Appearance?… Ah.”\nShe finally understood.\nThose people aren’t well-off enough to dress up like Amelia.\nHer noble-looking appearance and seemingly valuable accessories.\nThey were looking at her with eyes filled with envy, jealousy, and desire.\nThere’s only one reason why those people didn’t pick a fight with them.\nIt’s because they were wearing academy uniforms.\nEven if they fought, they would have no way to win.\n“Why did you even come here in the first place?”\n“… Can’t I come? I’m also Arte’s friend, you know?”\n“No, I’m not saying you can’t, but…”\nIt’s not the first or second time he’s acted together with Amelia, so it didn’t particularly bother him.\nThe problem is that it was only the two of them.\n“Shouldn’t you be moving with Dorothy?”\nDorothy and Amelia are in the same group.\nThat’s why he thought Amelia wouldn’t come. Because she had to move with Dorothy.\nDorothy doesn’t even know Arte’s true identity.\nSo he left Amelia behind, but she walked alongside him at some point.\n‘Don’t tell me she left Dorothy behind and moved alone.’\n“Don’t worry. She allowed it.”\n“…Allowed?”\n“Yeah. When I explained the situation, she understood.”\nAh.\nSiwoo felt like he knew what had happened without even looking.\nDorothy, who is emotionally sensitive, tends to be obsessed with romance.\nSo, she must have easily fallen for Amelia’s sweet talk.\n“Sigh… Do as you please.”\n“As always!”\n“…”\nShe’s quite talkative today.\nThinking that continuing to argue like this would only give him a headache, Siwoo decided not to pay any more attention to it.\nIt’s not like it’s the first or second time she did as she pleased.\n“It’s definitely around here, but… How are you going to find her?”\n“Huh?”\n“…What, you came without any plan? How are you going to find Arte in this city?!”\nAmelia raised her voice as if dumbfounded.\n‘Why is that even a question?’\n“We’ll find her if we just keep walking.”\n“What?!”\n“Come on, let’s go. I have a feeling it’s this way.”\n“H-Hey?!”\n***\n“…H-Hey. Where are you going?! Do you know the way?!”\n“No, I don’t. This is my first time here.”\nIs he crazy? No, he’s definitely crazy.\nAmelia was convinced.\nSiwoo was definitely not in his right mind.\nIt’s a city that he said has poor public safety.\nAn area with such strong vigilance towards outsiders that hostility can be felt.\nAt first, she looked around curiously, but she got tired of the gazes she felt with every step she took.\nEyes that glimmered with all sorts of desires and jealousy.\n‘If people like that gained abilities, they would surely commit something.’\nBut after saying it’s dangerous with his mouth, he’s striding forward in a place he doesn’t know the way.\n“Let’s go back, Siwoo. It’s dangerous here. Even if we’re metahumans, there’s no need to take risks…”\n“I don’t know the way back, though?”\n“What?!”\nSiwoo sometimes asked her if she was crazy.\nNow, she wanted to say those words back to him.\nYou’re the crazy one!\n“You can go back if you want to. You can get out quickly if you run a bit.”\n“That may be true, but…! You’re here?!”\nWhat’s the point of leaving him alone?\n‘If I leave this guy behind in such a dangerous place and something happens, I won’t be able to sleep peacefully at night.’\nShe didn’t want that.\nSleep is one of the joys of life.\n“We need to get out quickly…!”\n“Ah, found it.”\n“…What?”\n“Over there, do you see that person? I got a feeling.”\nA feeling, he says.\nHe’s been moving forward with confident steps even though he said he doesn’t know the way.\nIt was movement filled with certainty, but he just went where he felt was right?\nAmelia suddenly remembered Siwoo’s ability.\nIntuition.\nDidn’t he say just a few months ago that it only reacts to attacks?\n‘That crazy bastard. How fast is he growing?’\nHe moved without hesitation as if following quest markers in an open-world game.\n“…Wh-What is it? W, who are you!”\nWhen Siwoo stopped, they found a man sitting on the ground.\nA completely different person from Arte.\nBut Amelia decided to believe in Siwoo.\n“Hey, mister. Have you seen a girl who looks like she has her eyes closed? A black-haired girl with a big chest.”\n“H-Hiik! I don’t know anything!”\nSo he does know.\nAmelia became envious of Siwoo’s ability.\nShe had never envied anyone else’s ability before.\n‘This monster…he can find lost items with ease!’\n“What is it, Amelia? Why are you looking at me like that?”\n“Lend me your ability next time.”\n“?”\nThere were quite a few things that were definitely somewhere in the house because it was too big, but she couldn’t find them.\nAmelia began to make plans to invite Siwoo to her house next time to find many things she knows are somewhere inside.\n‘When would be a good time…’\n“Don’t worry. We’re not here to harm you. We just have something to ask.”\n“H-How can I trust that…!”\n“Hmm…”\nWhile she was distracted by his ability for a moment, Siwoo was pondering something.\nThough distracted and not listening, she knew what he was thinking about.\nHow to make him speak without violence.\nThat’s probably what he’s worrying about.\n…But he’s not really omnipotent after all. He can’t directly go to where Arte is, can he?\nIf he grows like that, he might become an investigator.\nIt seemed like an ability that could directly find the culprit, skipping the entire process.\n‘…Well, anyway. Since Siwoo found a clue, it’s my turn now, right?’\nShe was really envious of his ability, but…\nThere are still some things she was better at.\n“Mister. Take this.”\n“Th-This is…”\n“It’s not fake, so don’t worry. It’s quite expensive, you know?”\n“…”\nGulp.\nShe could feel another emotion growing within the man.\nGreed.\nWell, it’s not often that someone living in a place like this gets a chance to obtain a gold ornament.\nHe tried to snatch it from her hand, but she pulled it back before he could grab it.\n“If you tell us where the person we’re looking for went, I might give you more.”\n“…A-Are you serious?”\n“Of course. I’m serious, mister. I’m rich.”\nOf course, it was her dad’s money.\nBut money is meant to be spent.\n‘If I tell Grandpa and Dad that I spent some money helping a friend, won’t they forgive me?’\n…They will, right? Right?\nAmelia already felt the nagging in her ears.\n‘Well, what’s done is done.’\nA little bit of scolding never hurt anyone.\n“S-She went into that alley over there.”\n“Further inside? Why did she go in?”\n“I don’t know. She was looking for Arachne… They said they were looking for Arachne. With an investigator!”\n“An investigator?”\n“I don’t know if they were real or fake, but anyway, that’s what they said!”\nArte was with an investigator?\n…Why?\nArachne is an organization that the association is keeping a close eye on.\n‘Hmm, I don’t really understand.’\nShe handed the bracelet in her hand.\n“Here, take it.”\n“Oh, ooh…!”\n“Let’s go, Siwoo.”\n“W-Wait. I have one more thing to say.”\n“Huh?”\nThe man, who had been staring at the jewelry with entranced eyes, spoke to her.\nWith all doubts removed, to show goodwill to the person who gave him a precious item.\n“Arachne is active around here.”\n“That’s obvious since it was even on the news. I know that too. They’re just impersonators.”\n“S-So… That’s…”\n“If you have nothing more to say…”\n“Wait, Amelia. Let’s hear more.”\n“Those guys, there are quite a lot of them!”\n‘There are a lot of them?’\nPerhaps noticing their interest, he continued.\n“T-The recently disappeared Übermensch…! The guys who were oppressed by them are all impersonating Arachne. The number is enormous.”\n“…It doesn’t seem like it will be a problem.”\n“No, no. It’s a maze here.”\n“…A maze?”\n“Because the recaptured areas were hastily built up, the roads are twisted here and there, so it’s easy to get lost even for the locals. So if you let your guard down…”\nOnly then did she realize what he was trying to say.\nA maze-like terrain.\nCriminals lurking using the name Arachne.\nIt might be dangerous if they were attacked by surprise.\nMaybe that’s what he wanted to say.\n“…Thanks, mister.”\n“I-It’s for the money.”\nAmelia spent well today.\n_____________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nI want to have my own ‘world’ like the Author.",

      "content": "“…One. Two. Three. Four. Is this all of them?”\n“It seems like it for this area.”\n“Sigh… How many of them are there in total?”\nFour men trembling.\nEven now, it was hard to believe, but they were all impersonators.\n“P-Please spare us.”\n“We’ll never do it again…!”\n“…”\nI had already lost count of how often I had heard these words.\nIt was absurd.\nIt seemed like I wasn’t the only one who thought so, as Lyla laughed as if dumbfounded.\n“Wow, impressive. We were popular, huh?”\n“We didn’t get popular from doing things like this.”\n“We’re not even celebrities, what the…”\nJust four people.\n“How many were there so far?”\n“Twenty-two.”\n“Hiik…”\nThis is crazy.\nI grabbed my throbbing head.\nI never thought there would be this many.\nNo matter what, this was too many.\n“I think it’s because it’s a secret organization.”\n“…Because it’s a secret organization?”\n“Yes. It’s the perfect condition for impersonation.”\nWhy are there so many impersonators?\nWhile thinking that, Ha-Yul, who had been pondering something for a while, finally opened his mouth.\n“It’s just an organization known by name, isn’t it? It’s understandable to think it’s easy to impersonate. Especially since our activities have become infrequent lately.”\n“…Is that so?”\n“A secret organization that nobody knows the true identity of. But a secret organization that the public quite likes. Even though they don’t hesitate to commit murder, their popularity is skyrocketing. What do you think?”\nWe didn’t answer Ha-Yul’s question.\nWe could tell that everyone understood, even without saying it.\nUltimately, we had reached a limit due to the inherent nature of being a secret organization.\n“…Sigh.”\n“This… There’s no way. There are too many. If we kill them all, it might tarnish our name.”\n[N-No, you can’t do that! A dark hero who receives cheers from the citizens, that’s quite cool!]\nKilling them all would solve everything.\nBut realistically, that’s impossible.\nThe number we found after searching for several hours is barely around twenty.\nYou might say we found a lot, but the problem is that we caught that many even after searching continuously.\nWe even had an investigator with us, not just ordinary people, yet we could only catch twenty people.\nI don’t know the total number, but it doesn’t seem like it would be just this much.\nIf we try to catch all the impersonators in this crazy neighborhood, we might have to stay here for months.\nThe roads are all twisted, so even if we definitely went forward, we sometimes end up back where we started.\n“…It will be difficult to catch them all.”\n“You think so too, right?”\n“Yes. I think we have no choice but to make an example out of some and teach them a lesson.”\n“H-Hiik…”\n“Don’t worry. We won’t kill you.”\nPerhaps it was inevitable for Arachne to gain the image of people who execute villains.\nArachne was born because I caught villains while trying to control the ridiculous setup the Author had scattered.\nThe organization wasn’t created to execute villains as the citizens think.\nIt’s just that the organization was somehow created while killing villains.\nThat image wasn’t our intention, but… The Author seemed to quite like it.\nThen, I had no intention of killing those other than villains.\nEven if it’s an unintentionally created image, if it’s a good direction, I’ll just follow it.\n“Consider yourselves lucky. You guys are too ambiguous to be called villains, so you get to live.”\nWell, I also don’t particularly want to kill those who don’t need to be killed.\nI didn’t want to go around slashing every single person I saw.\nBesides, our investigator wouldn’t like it.\nHa-Yul didn’t seem to consider them villains.\nThen, as the boss, I should respect that.\n“But I thought you would tell us to kill them, but you didn’t? Aren’t those guys also villains?”\n“Because they haven’t killed anyone. There’s still a way for them to atone for their sins, right?”\n…Ah. I see.\nUpon hearing Ha-Yul’s answer to Lyla’s question, I finally realized why he was reluctant to kill them.\nBecause they haven’t killed anyone.\nThat’s all there is to it.\nThe reason Ha-Yul turned to Arachne was for revenge.\nRevenge against the villain who killed someone precious to her.\n“There’s no need to kill for stealing money. They can just compensate for the damage. There’s no need to kill for attacking someone. They can just provide appropriate compensation.”\n“You’re really rational despite muttering that you can’t forgive impersonators…”\n“It’s embarrassing, but I clearly distinguish between public and private matters. I can’t recklessly kill just because I’m angry, can I?”\n“I see.”\n“…However, I cannot forgive those who have taken the lives of others. No, they can’t even ask for forgiveness. Because the victims themselves are no longer in this world.”\n“Then what about you killing villains?”\n“That’s a different story.”\nHa-Yul affirmed.\nAs if it wasn’t even worth talking about.\n“I know what you want to say. Doesn’t that apply to villains too? That’s what you’re going to say, right? I’ll tell you firmly. Villains are not applicable.”\n“Yeah?… I didn’t mean it that way. I was just curious, so don’t get too angry.”\n“It’s an order. We’ve probably rested enough, so how about we threaten the impersonators and come back?”\n“Ah, don’t worry, Spira. I’ll take care of it.”\n“…Well, okay. I have to do what I’m told.”\nI forcefully ended the conversation.\nI didn’t want to hear any more of that kind of talk.\nWhether killing is right or wrong, such things have no meaning at all.\nIn the end, they’re all just puppets. Even if you think about such things, nothing is important.\nIt only makes my head hurt.\nThere’s only one being in this world that mustn’t die.\nJust Siwoo.\nThe rest doesn’t matter.\nYeah, the rest isn’t important.\nThe only important thing is him. The rest doesn’t matter…\n“Huh? Where is this place…?”\nWhen I suddenly raised my head, the surrounding scenery had already changed.\nI was distracted for a moment while walking, and in that short time, I had moved to an unfamiliar place.\n“…Hmm, this is troublesome.”\nI felt a bit embarrassed.\nIt was easy to get lost even when several people were walking together in this place, so could I really find my way back to them?\nAs expected, the scenery changed every time I moved, but it was always unfamiliar.\nI never thought I would get lost.\nThey say to stay in the same spot if you get lost, but…\nNo matter what, if I stay in the same spot, it won’t look cool.\nI forcefully split up with my subordinates to end the conversation.\nIt seemed like it wasn’t a good choice after all.\nNow that it’s come to this, should I find other people nearby and ask for directions?\n…Or should I use the thread to go up to the rooftop of a building?\nHmm, that would be good.\nJust using one glove would be enough.\nAlright. If my subordinates catch me, I can make up an excuse that watching from the sky is more comfortable.\n“Hey, sis. What are you doing here?”\n“…?!”\nThe moment I looked at the rooftop of a tall-looking building to release the thread from the glove.\nI heard a voice from behind.\n“Die…!”\n“Oh my, don’t move. You look like an academy student, but you don’t think I’ll attack you alone, right?”\nI tried to attack, ignoring the sharp blades that came close to my neck and back.\nThere’s no way someone who sneaks up behind me without making a sound would be friendly.\nIf I hadn’t seen the blue energy emanating from the dagger, I definitely would have done so.\n“…Mana?”\n“Hey, what did I say? I said a superhuman would recognize it, didn’t I?”\n“Right. That drug really seems to be effective.”\n“It’s a prototype made by the guys who attacked the academy. The effect should be certain.”\nAh.\nI let out a small sigh.\nIt’s another side effect of the setting the Author created.\nIt must be the drug that animal organization was making.\nWhen they collapsed, the drug prototype that supposedly turns people into superhumans must have naturally spread to these back alleys.\nI let my guard down.\nIt’s hard to fight without preparation.\nDue to the nature of threads, it’s much more effective to lay them in advance…\nTaking advantage of the moment I was distracted by the maze-like twisted paths, they launched a surprise attack.\nThey must be guys who are familiar with the geography here.\n“…What do you want?”\n“Oh my, sis. You’re quite calm? Aren’t you scared? Ehehe. If you get stabbed a little more here, hmm? You’ll die?”\nPoke.\nWith a slight pain in my neck, the leotard became a bit damp.\nThe dagger must have dug into my skin.\nIt’s probably a threat.\n“I’m asking what you want. Just say it. I don’t like bothersome things.”\n“Oh my, you have guts?”\nGuts or not, I won’t die, so there’s no need to be scared.\nThere are many reasons.\nThe first reason is that I am the Author’s only eyes.\nI am the only way for her to view this world.\nIf I die, she will face great hardship.\nSo I won’t die…\nAt least.\nThe second reason is that these guys won’t make me disabled.\nAlthough it may seem that the academy doesn’t care about the students’ safety by sending them to the field, that’s not the case.\nAs soon as there were stories of some students getting hurt, the teachers directly punished the villains based on the students’ testimonies.\nIt’s already been several weeks. The rumors must have spread far and wide.\nAs proof, if they wanted to subdue me, they could have cut off my arm, but they only slightly showed blood as a threat.\n…Lastly, I’ve already finished preparing.\nYou should also think about being attacked from under your legs, you idiots.\nI finished preparing to attack them from the blind spot as the thread from the stockings unraveled.\nSince they’re annoying, cutting off a finger or two should be fine.\n…No. Since they hurt my pretty body, wouldn’t it be legal to cut off the hand holding the weapon?\nHmm, it should be fine.\nJust as I was about to attack those annoying guys while rationalizing to myself.\nI was startled by a voice that suddenly came.\nBecause it was the voice of someone who shouldn’t be here.\n“Can you let go of that person?”\nSiwoo, for some reason, appeared before my eyes.\n…Why the hell is he here?\n________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nStarting today, it’s the enjoyable Chuseok holiday!\nI hope everyone has a joyful Chuseok!\nThe ant is busy.\nToday too, busy.\nWorking hard~",

      "content": "“What are you doing here?”\n“Well… I’m just a passerby. You know that’s a crime, right?”\nSiwoo’s nonsensical words echoed through the alley.\nStunned by the sudden turn of events, I stared blankly at Siwoo, forgetting to subdue the two thugs.\nWhat is he doing here?\nWhat’s going on?\n[As expected of the protagonist…! That spirit of not tolerating injustice! So cool!]\nNo, that’s not what’s important right now, Author.\nWhy is he here when he should be at school by now?\nIt would take several hours just to get here.\nMoreover, this is a place where it’s easy to get lost if you aren’t a local.\nI knew that well, as I had gotten disoriented after walking absentmindedly for a while.\n“I know, so get lost. We’re busy right now.”\n“Hmm… What should I do…? Oh, what should I do for you to let that person go? Holding a knife like this is dangerous, you know.”\n“Do you want to die?! Get lost right now!”\n“Whoa, don’t swing that around. I told you, it’s dangerous.”\n“If it’s not dangerous, there’s no reason to swing it, you stupid bastard! If you don’t want to die, get lost!”\nSiwoo tried to persuade the thugs somehow, but the thugs got angry at his tone several times.\nSiwoo shook his head as if he had given up.\n“… Didn’t I say something just now? I warned you. I told you it’s dangerous.”\n“Stop talking nonsense and get lost right now! If you don’t want to see this woman die…!”\n“The one who’s dying is you, you worthless piece of trash.”\n“Wh-What?! When did you…?!”\nClang.\nThe handle and blade of the dagger that had cut my neck were separated.\nI smiled at the thug, who was staring blankly at the now useless piece of trash in his hand.\n“What should I do with you?”\n“Hii-Hiik…?! R-Run…!”\n“Oh my. Stay right there. If you don’t want to see this guy die.”\nHe tried to take me as hostage earlier.\nI’ll show him what a real hostage situation is like.\nWhen I showed him his colleague, who was tied up tightly with thread and was floating next to me, the guy immediately reacted.\n…He started running away without even looking back.\nWhat’s with that guy?\n“Mmph, mmph! Mmmmph!”\n“Haaaa… They really don’t have the slightest bit of camaraderie.”\nThis isn’t a hostage situation if he runs away.\nI shook my head at the fleeing thug.\nIt’s meaningless to go there anyway.\n“AAAARGH! My-My shoulder…! My shoulder…!!!”\n“Oh dear, you were lucky. If you had taken one more step, you wouldn’t have been able to use your arm.”\n“Sp-Spare… Spare me…!”\n“Yes, I’ll spare you.”\nI tied up the thug who tried to run away. Unlike his colleague, he could move and speak.\nHowever, I meticulously tied some thread around his fingers and toes.\nHmm, how can I convey my thoughts properly?\n…Ah. This will do.\nCRACK!\nI pulled out a thread from my stocking and instantly shattered a stone lying on the road.\nOnly then, as if he understood the situation, the thug, who had only been thinking of running away, turned pale.\n“Now, the thread tied around your body is the same thread. What do you think will happen to your body if it tightens like that shattered rock?”\n“Hii-Hiii…”\n“Speak, speak! You piece of trash…”\n“Spa-Spare me…”\n“I said I won’t kill you, didn’t I? I have no reason to kill you. …But you better give me a reason why you should return with your limbs intact, friend.”\n“Th-That, well…”\n“If you can’t give a reason, you’ll unfortunately have to bid farewell to a part of you forever.”\nI smiled at the thug, who finally started cooperating.\nThis is a REAL hostage situation.\nYes, if you don’t want to say goodbye to that body, you’ll have to spit out any decent information you’ve got.\nAfter talking to the thugs for a while, I eventually let them go with all their limbs intact.\n“Hey, Arte…?”\n“…Oh.”\nI was in big trouble.\nI felt like my mind was going completely blank.\nNo matter how careless I was, I was angry that I had been slightly scratched by these guys, so I did it without thinking.\nThat shouldn’t have happened.\nI committed it even though I knew Siwoo was around.\nWh-What should I do? Should I try smiling for now?\nI spoke to him with a slight smile. It was an awkward smile.\n“You saw something unsightly, Siwoo.”\n“Mm-hmm. Yeah. That’s why I told you.”\n“…?”\n“I told you it’s dangerous, but you didn’t listen when I said it…”\nWhat?\nHe wasn’t concerned for my safety but for theirs?\nI was a little touched for a moment.\n“What do you mean? Are you saying it’s dangerous for me?”\n“…No, that’s not it. You’re a good person.”\nWhen I complained weakly in a playful tone, expecting him to overlook what he had just seen, a reaction contrary to my expectations popped out.\nI thought he would be slightly surprised, but his reaction completely differed from what I had anticipated.\n…A good person? Me?\n“HAHAHA, you’re quite the joker. Didn’t you see what just happened? I’m a pretty bad person, you know?”\n“You weren’t the one who attacked first.”\n“…What? Well, that’s true, but.”\n“You’re not a bad person.”\nI let out a small laugh at Siwoo’s words.\nHe doesn’t know that I’ve killed many villains.\nThat’s why he can react like that to me.\n“That’s interesting. I wonder how many people could say that after seeing what happened.”\n“That person attacked you first. You’re not someone who would harm others without reason.”\n“…”\nIt was absurd.\nEven after seeing that…\nEven after seeing me threaten someone, he still believes in me.\nHis reaction remained the same even when I tried to gloss over what just happened.\nHe trusted me. He believed that I wasn’t that kind of person.\n“You know, Siwoo. I’m not as kind as you think I am. You may not know, but I’ve done all sorts of bad things.”\n“I know.”\n“…What?”\n“I know that you’ve been involved in various incidents.”\n“Wha-What?”\n“I also know that you’re part of Arachne.”\n“Wait a minute. Wh-What did you just say…?”\n[…Huh? What did I just hear? Huh?]\nI was confused.\nHuh? What? How?\nI wasn’t the only one who was confused.\nThe Author also blurted out a dumbfounded voice, utterly perplexed.\nBoth of us were stunned by Siwoo’s words.\n…This is bad. This is really bad.\nWh-What should I do?\nKill Siwoo? No, I can’t do that. He’s the protagonist. Moreover, he’s the only person. It’s impossible to kill him.\nKnock him out? …No, that won’t work either. How? Siwoo’s ability is intuition. A surprise attack won’t work.\nDidn’t I see with my own eyes that he dodged my attack even when I blocked several of his senses?\n[Re-Reader-nim… This is really bad, isn’t it…?]\n“H-How. How…?”\nSiwoo didn’t answer my question.\nHe just looked at me and said what he wanted to say.\n“I know you killed villains.”\n“U-Uh… Well, that’s…”\n“I also know that you hacked the academy’s database.”\n“Wh-What?”\n“I know you were involved in the monster incident at the entrance ceremony.”\n[This is bad. Hmm, what should we do? Replace the protagonist? No, those guys will definitely make a fuss. But to replace Reader-nim is a bit…]\nI could hear the Author muttering, but I couldn’t understand what she was saying.\nMy mind was solely focused on what Siwoo had said.\nEverything has been exposed. How was it exposed?\nNo, that doesn’t matter anymore at this point.\nI plopped down on the ground.\n“A-Arte…?”\n“What should I do, what should I do, what should I do, what should I do, what should I do…?”\nSiwoo had noticed that I was acting strange.\nMaybe he had noticed it for a while.\n…But how should I handle this situation?\nThe Author said she can’t make changes to the protagonist.\nMoreover, he IS the protagonist. I can’t kill him either.\n…Then, what happens if the protagonist discovers that there is an observer?\nIt’s a rule that the protagonist can’t be changed.\n…Then who gets changed?\nAs my thoughts reached that point, I couldn’t maintain my sanity.\n“Au-Author-nim. I’m sorry.”\n“Arte?”\n“I’ll do better. Okay? I’ve been doing well so far, haven’t I?”\nI don’t want to die.\nIn this unknown place.\nEven in a situation where my name was forcibly ripped away and my appearance transformed, I’ve been trying my best.\nI-I’ve even killed people.\nNot just one or two.\nAll those countless villains that the Author created unnecessarily… I handled all of them.\nI KILLED THEM ALL!!!\n“No, please, no, no, no, no, not like this… This can’t be happening…”\n“Arte.”\n“I-I worked hard. I worked hard. But why, why? From where…!”\n“Arte!”\n“Hi-Hiii?!”\nSwoosh.\nSiwoo hugged me.\nIt took a while for me to notice that fact.\n“…Arte. It’s okay.”\n“Wh-What…? Wh-What the hell…?”\n“Don’t worry, Arte. Everything will be fine. You won’t die. Don’t worry.”\nI felt a warm hand stroking my head.\n“Don’t worry, Arte. It’s okay. It’s okay…”\n“B-bu-b-bu-but…!”\nSiwoo doesn’t know anything.\nHe doesn’t know the truth of this world, nor the fact that he’s the protagonist.\nHe doesn’t know that the world changes its appearance back and forth according to the hand of god.\nHe doesn’t know that this world is like a castle made of clay.\nThat’s why his consolation doesn’t help at all.\nHe shouldn’t know all that. That’s how it should be. That’s how it should be, but,\n…Why do I feel so at ease?\n“It’s okay, Arte. You’ll be fine.”\n“B-But how…?”\n“I’ll help you, Arte.”\nSiwoo made a vow to me.\nIt’s just like a knight making a vow to a princess.\n“I’ll help you so you won’t commit any more bad deeds. I’ll help you so that you won’t be in danger.”\n“…”\n“So, don’t cry, Arte.”\nI had no choice but to stay in his arms for a long time.\nBecause I couldn’t muster the courage to break free from his embrace.\nBecause it felt like the moment I left his arms, my existence would be erased from the world.\n“Hic, hic… Hey, Siwoo! Where did you go?! Where did you go, leaving me behind?!”\n“…Ah. Amelia. I forgot.”\nI came to my senses when Amelia’s annoyed voice echoed through the alley.\nAuthor’s Notes\nI can’t take it anymore.\nI need to progress my love life.",

      "content": "“Amelia, I’m here.”\nSiwoo called out to Amelia when he heard a voice looking for him.\nHurried footsteps followed, and a familiar person popped out of the alley.\n“Where the hell did you go, leaving me behind?!”\n“So-Sorry. I felt uneasy about something…”\n“…Ah. No, that’s understandable.”\nAmelia, who had been blushing with anger, softened when she saw him.\nFor a moment, he wondered why she was acting like that, but he could quickly find the reason.\nIt was because Arte, who was in his arms, started squirming to break free.\n“Mo-Move… Please move…! I’m fine…”\n“Ah. Sorry.”\nThere was only one reason why Amelia suddenly became benevolent towards him.\nBecause he was hugging Arte, it was clear that she saw that and let her imagination run wild.\nThat was something that always happened, but Arte’s reaction was a bit awkward.\nNormally, she would have smiled lightly and asked me to move as if it were nothing.\n“Haa, haa… You saw something unsightly.”\n“Ye-Yeah…”\n“I-I’ll be going first then!”\nIn Arte’s hurried escape from the scene, there was no trace of her usual confident demeanor.\nThere was only a cute girl, blushing and utterly flustered.\nIt was as if the mask she wore had been torn off.\n“Look at you~. You’re quite something, aren’t you?”\n“It’s not like that.”\n“Oh, come on. You were embracing her so intensely as if whispering sweet nothings.”\n“It’s not that.”\n“…Did something happen?”\nHe had expected this kind of conversation based on Amelia’s usual behavior but wasn’t in the mood to respond.\nSo he answered curtly, and Amelia also asked me with a serious expression.\nShe must have realized that there was something important. As expected, she’s quick-witted.\n“I told her.”\n“…Huh? Told her what?”\n“I told her that I know she’s Arachne.”\n“What?! A-Are you crazy?!”\nAmelia’s voice, almost screaming, made his ears hurt.\nWell, it’s understandable for her to react like that.\nHe spoke impulsively too.\nHe did it unintentionally because he was angry at Arte’s self-deprecating attitude.\n“Listen, Amelia. I’ll explain everything later, so just answer my questions. I need your opinion on whether my guesses are correct.”\n“… You’ll have to explain everything from the beginning when you’re done.”\n“Yeah. So just wait a bit. I want to organize my thoughts too.”\nAmelia sighed but kept quiet otherwise.\nShe may usually seem out of her mind, but she’s reliable at times like this.\n“…Listen, Amelia. Do you remember the ‘Author?'”\n“Of course I remember. We speculated that she might be an informant. Why?”\n“When I revealed to Arte that I know her true identity, she suddenly cried and trembled.”\n“What?”\n“And she said, ‘”Author-nim. I’m sorry. I’ll do better. I’ve been doing well so far, haven’t I?'”\n“That’s… could it be…?”\nAmelia also seemed to have reached the same conclusion as him, and her face became serious.\nYes. Their speculations were off from the beginning.\nThey had speculated that Arte and that ‘Author’ had a horizontal relationship.\nBut they were wrong. It was only a superficial relationship.\nThose two had the most vertical relationship of anyone.\n“My guess is this… It was all ordered by that ‘Author.'”\n“…”\n“Arte killing people, releasing monsters into the academy, infiltrating it… All of it.”\nBefore he knew it, he had become convinced of his thoughts, even though he had said it was a guess.\nIt fits together too well to be just a theory.\nOtherwise, there’s no way to explain Arte’s actions.\n“Arte had been rationalizing killing people. She said they were ‘just puppets.'”\n“Wha-What? When did she say…?”\n“No matter how much I think about it, it’s strange. It’s been over half a year since we got to know Arte, but we don’t even know about that ‘Author.’ How do they even communicate in the first place?”\nHe’s ashamed to think about it again, but he had once hidden in Arte’s locker.\nAt that time, no mechanical devices were found anywhere in it.\n“We speculated that they communicate through some kind of ability like telepathy… But if you think about it, isn’t it strange?”\nTelepathy is the ability to communicate without speaking.\nBut it’s strange.\nWhy didn’t they realize this?\nThey could have realized it was strange if they had thought a little more.\nBecause they didn’t think that ‘Author’ was a very important person.\nThat’s why we missed an important fact.\n“Let’s say she can convey her own voice. Then how does she convey Arte’s voice?”\n“…Huh?”\n“One ability per person. This is common sense that everyone knows. And Arte can control threads.”\nRight.\nThe only thing that can be conveyed through telepathy is one’s voice.\nThere was no way to hear Arte’s voice.\n“Communication with Arte is impossible. But she kept muttering. She was communicating with that Author in real-time.”\nIf she’s conveying her voice through telepathy,\nThen how does she hear Arte’s words?\nIt’s not something mechanical.\nHe verified that.\nIt wasn’t Arte’s ability either.\nBut Arte and the Author kept conversing through some means.\n“Th-Then how on earth…?”\n“I don’t know either. But it’s definitely not something like telepathy.”\nSiwoo started moving in the direction Arte had fled.\nHe’s not sure where she went. But he was certain.\n‘If we go this way, we’ll be able to meet her.’\nThere was no basis for it. But he knew.\n“Somewhere, they can hear Arte’s voice, constantly watch over her, and hold the power of life and death over her.”\n“… You’re saying that guy ordered Arte to kill people?”\n“That’s what I think.”\nThey should have realized from the beginning that something was strange.\nWhy did she, whose mind was unstable enough to rationalize people as puppets, start killing people?\nHe judged that the reason lies with the one called the ‘Author.’\n“…Finally.”\nA way to help Arte started to appear.\n‘Yet, it’s only an outline for now.’\nBut he was convinced that even that was a big step. Until now, even that wasn’t visible.\n“Wait for me, Arte. I’ll help you.”\nFinding out that Arte’s actions were done under someone’s orders was a huge achievement.\nBecause he could be certain that everything she did was not of her own will.\nHe moved towards the place where he thought Arte would be.\n***\n“Hmm, what should I do about this…?”\nThe pure girl muttered while watching the Reader hastily trying to escape the alley.\nShe could just use threads like she was going to earlier and move to the rooftop of a tall building.\nPerhaps due to panic, she couldn’t even think of that and was running around here and there.\n“When did he notice? To think he knew about the monster incident…”\nIt didn’t seem like he was suspicious of her.\nThe girl was greatly discouraged.\nShe shouldn’t have given him the ability of intuition, making him notice unnecessary things.\nShe should have just given him a status window.\nBefore she knew it, even her ability didn’t work on him, and she couldn’t even guess what the protagonist’s ability would be.\n‘Because of that, the other guys are mocking me too.’\n(I knew you’d do this, you stupid bastard. You did all sorts of things, and now a big incident has erupted.)\n“Aargh, shut up! People can make mistakes too!”\n(…More than that, there’s something I’m curious about. What are you going to do?)\n“Huh? About what?”\n(Your toy is half out of her mind, and that protagonist is showing hostility towards the non-existent Author in that world.)\n“…Ah, that? It’s easy.”\n(Easy, you say?)\nThese guys’ weakness is that they lack imagination.\n‘You only enjoy stories about the end of the world and such, so I guess that’s why you’re a bit lacking?’\nYou should know how to enjoy romantic stories occasionally.\n“We just need to change the route a bit. It’s been a while since I changed it anyway.”\n(…Did it change? When?)\n“Quite a while ago? When was it? I don’t know. I don’t care.”\nNo, she didn’t care about when it changed.\nRight now, she’s just happily watching the story created by chance.\nThe Reader seems to think she would abandon her because the protagonist discovered that she created the incidents.\nSiwoo managed to calm her down somehow, but given time, she’d probably start thinking that way again.\n‘Even though I have no intention of doing that.’\n“Hey, hey. Isn’t the Reader cute? She’s begging even though I have no intention of killing her.”\n(…You have twisted tastes…)\n(I agree. I can never understand your preferences.)\n“Look who’s talking.”\n‘These guys who get excited about the end of the world, saying it’s like fireworks.’\nAnyway, they don’t know art.\nShe’s so cute, you know?\n“How did I bring such a soul? Am I a genius or what?!”\nShe had only brought a soul that seemed suitable for the role of an observer.\nBut she turned out to be much more to her liking than expected.\nShe could have predicted the story development by abandoning the Reader and rearranging the surrounding settings except for Siwoo, but…\n‘I don’t want that. I can’t lose the Reader!’\n“The final boss candidate was Arachne, but… Hmm, that might be too cliché!”\n‘Once in a while, a shocking final boss might be nice, don’t you think?’\nThe girl smiled brightly.\n“It seems fun to participate directly!”\nOf course, if she fought seriously, the world would be destroyed, so she wouldn’t be able to give it my all.\nWell, it’ll be a good setup if the protagonist wins appropriately!\nFor the sake of love, shouldn’t he overcome a hurdle?\n‘…Come to think of it, I created the Reader’s body.’\nDoesn’t that make her the parent?\n‘Hehe, for the sake of love, he’ll have to convince me! An incredibly strong parent. It’ll be fun!’\nThe girl smiled brightly.\n(Aren’t you being too arrogant? You don’t even know what the protagonist’s ability is.)\n(That’s right. Seeing that even your ability doesn’t work on him, it might be an ability to be wary of. You should be careful…)\n“Nah, it’s fine! You think I’d lose?”\nThere was no case where she’d lose to the protagonist if she fought seriously.\nEven if she can’t descend into the world, her overwhelming mass could crush the protagonist.\n‘Moreover, unlike the other guys, I can easily descend.’\nThe one who can change the settings.\nThe girl smiled as if telling them not to worry.",

      "content": "I hugged the pillow on the bed tightly and pulled the covers over me.\nIt’s warm. It would be a lie to say it’s not.\nThe cozy blanket, the luxurious pillow, and the soft, fluffy bed.\nThese small things are the good parts of crossing over to this world. I normally wouldn’t dare covet these expensive items.\nThe high-end bedding is definitely cozy and warm, as befitting the price.\nBut, but why…\n“It’s… lacking.”\nIt’s warm, but it’s not warm.\nI know better than anyone that it’s clearly contradictory.\nIt doesn’t make sense to say it’s warm but not warm, right?\nBut I can clearly feel it. It’s not warm.\nThe blanket that was cozy up until yesterday…\nI suddenly covered my head with the blanket up to my ears and closed my eyes for fear that I would hear the Author’s voice.\nDoing this can’t stop me from hearing the Author’s voice.\nI know that well too.\nBut if I don’t at least do something like this, I won’t be able to bear it.\nWhy isn’t she saying anything?\nWhy? For what reason?\nShe definitely heard it, right? Right?\nThe possibility that she didn’t hear it doesn’t exist.\nBecause I directly heard the Author’s startled voice.\nShe definitely heard it. I’m certain.\nBut why aren’t you saying anything?\nI hugged the pillow in my arms even tighter.\nIt still wasn’t warm.\n“… Author. Are you asleep?”\nThere was no reply.\nSince that time, the Author hasn’t given me any response.\nWhy could that be?\nIs it because she’s embarrassed? Or is she disappointed in me?\nI couldn’t know.\nI felt even more anxious because the Author had never been like this.\n“Please, answer me…”\nThere were actually many times I wished the Author didn’t exist.\nIf that were really the case, I would be able to accept this world as reality.\nI could enjoy the world and go on adventures like the web novel protagonists I’ve seen before.\nIt would be fine even if I didn’t feel like a human who fell among a puppet show.\nBut now that the Author has really disappeared, I feel anxious instead.\nWhy isn’t there a response? Why isn’t there any word? Have I been abandoned?\nI became scared.\nThe Author, the only basis I have to judge that I’m human, has disappeared.\nSeeing people change, seeing society shift, I thought I was different from those puppets…\nIf the Author secretly changed my settings, I would have no way of knowing.\nI would just perceive it as reality.\nThe Author was a basis for me. A place where information came from.\nThe fact that Lyla changed. The fact that Investigator Lee Ha-Yul changed. The fact that Amelia’s past changed slightly.\nThe appearance of the secret room. The number of members in Arachne. And so much other information.\nIt’s all information I found out through the Author.\nThen what am I if she isn’t here?\nAm I no different from the people I considered puppets?\n…Haha. I don’t know.\nI hugged the pillow in my arms once more.\nI still couldn’t feel any warmth.\nI missed that warm temperature I felt during the day.\nI shouldn’t have run away.\n***\n“It’s strange…”\n“What is?”\n“No, it’s just that Arte didn’t show up at my house last night.”\n“…?”\n“She usually comes every day, but she didn’t come yesterday… I’m a bit worried.”\nAmelia was confused about where even to start.\nIs the problem Siwoo, who’s worried that Arte didn’t stalk his house?\nOr is it Arte’s fault, stalking Siwoo every day without fail, causing him to worry when she rested for a day?\nAmelia pondered for a while and reached a conclusion.\nNeither of them is in their right mind.\n“Are you sure your head is okay?”\n“…? Yes. Of course, I’m not hurt anywhere.”\nGreat, he doesn’t get it.\nAmelia decided not to mind the stalking anymore.\nIt seemed like talking to him wouldn’t work.\nIf the two of them are fine with it, then that’s good enough.\nAmelia regretted that maybe she should have given them a stern talking-to last time.\n“Was it too hasty of me to talk about the Author?”\n“Well, that’s true. According to what you said, they’re always watching.”\n“…”\nWhat Siwoo said yesterday was truly shocking.\nHearing all the objective facts he knew and his speculations, she couldn’t help but be astonished.\nThe Author. Arte’s mental issues.\nPuppets. Humans. And all the things Arte has shown until now.\nIf all of that is true, then it was definitely too hasty.\nNo, it was beyond hasty.\nIt was extremely dangerous.\n“You need to be a bit more cautious, Siwoo. If you want to help Arte, that is.”\n“…I know.”\n“I’m saying this because it seems like you don’t know. Arte might not have made the night.”\n“…”\nNo one besides Arte knows the Author’s true nature.\nThat Author is always watching her.\nIf she is scared enough to beg on the spot without regard to Siwoo being present, then they definitely hold her lifeline or something even beyond that.\n‘But we don’t know how the surveillance occurs or even how they converse. And you went and said something like that in that situation?’\nIt’s dangerous, isn’t it?\n“…Well, it can’t be helped since you already said it. Arte isn’t here yet?”\n“Yeah. She hasn’t come yet.”\n“It seems about time for her to arrive… It should be fine. Let’s wait ten more minutes.”\nThirty minutes have passed since then.\nArte didn’t come.\n“…Hey, Siwoo. Isn’t Arte really late compared to when she usually arrives?”\nAmelia asked, but there was no reply.\nWondering what he was doing not to answer, she turned to look at Siwoo, only to see him biting his nails with a worried expression.\nWas he bothered by what she said earlier?\nAnyone could see he looked anxious.\n“Hey, Siwoo!”\n“Huh?… Uh, sorry. I was just thinking about something else for a bit. What is it?”\n“Don’t worry. Arte will be fine.”\n“…”\n“Arte isn’t just some ordinary person, right? Something must have come up to make her late.”\n“R-right…”\n“Yeah. So don’t worry.”\n‘Jeez, they really need a lot of attention.’\nBoth Arte and Siwoo.\nShe forced herself to brush away the anxiety and smiled brightly.\nShe had to do that for this dimwit to be reassured.\nFortunately, he seemed to have come to his senses as he smiled slightly at her.\n“Thanks, Amelia.”\n“Before worrying about others, take care of yourself first.”\nBut really, why is she late?\n‘It can’t be that something really did happen to her because of that person called the Author like I said…right?’\nAmelia told him not to be anxious, but right after something like that happened yesterday…\nArte was much later than usual, so she couldn’t help but worry.\n‘Should I try calling her?’\nThe moment she was about to contact Arte, the sound of the classroom door suddenly opening resounded.\n“…Hello.”\n“Ah, Arte. Why does your face look like that…?”\nThe familiar polite speech.\nIt was Arte’s voice.\nThe relief that my worries were for nothing was short-lived.\nShe was taken aback by her exhausted face.\nArte looked like someone who hadn’t slept properly in ten days.\nCan a person change this much in a single day?\n“You, you… stayed up all night?”\n“Whew… Yes, yes… No I slept…”\n“What time did you sleep?”\n“Umm, 2 AM…? No, 3 AM… 4 AM… 5 AM was it…? No, 8 AM?”\nAmelia was shocked at the time every time she spoke.\nShe didn’t sleep at all.\nIt seemed she had stayed up the whole night.\n“You, you didn’t sleep?!”\n“I couldn’t fall asleep.”\n“…”\nIf the two of them were anxious about what might’ve happened last night,\nThen what thoughts did Arte herself have?\nAmelia couldn’t easily imagine what she was thinking.\n“Yaaaawn…”\nThe sight of Arte yawning loudly entered her vision.\nIt could seem peaceful, like any other day, but that wasn’t the case.\nTheir relationship has changed greatly.\nSince finding out Arte’s secret.\n“Ah. Hello.”\n“…Hi, Arte.”\nPerhaps due to the guilt of making Arte anxious by talking unnecessarily…\nSiwoo, who couldn’t easily meet her eyes, was stared at intently by Arte.\nWhat?\n“…Ah. Right.”\nHer confusion and Siwoo’s was short-lived.\nThat confusion turned to astonishment.\nBecause Arte took an action that would normally be unimaginable.\n“Ah, Arte?!”\n“Mmm… It’s warm…”\n“Oh…”\n“What, oh?! H, help me!”\nIt was a sudden situation.\nArte threw herself at Siwoo.\nHe seemed to have sensed it and tried to dodge it but thought Arte might get hurt if he did, so he caught her in his arms.\n“You’re warm…”\n“Arte? What is this all of a sudden… Arte? Arte?”\n“She’s sleeping?”\nInhale, exhale.\nBreathing evenly, Arte fell into a deep sleep.\nSiwoo tried to get out of her embrace in bewilderment, but seeing her furrowing her brows every time he tried, he gave up and left her be.\n“…Hey, what did you do?”\n“I didn’t do anything!”\n“Suspicious…”\n“What did I do to deserve this!?”\n‘Chance!’\nA chance to tease Siwoo.\nAmelia decided to wait for Arte to wake up while tormenting him.\n“Hello. Huh? Why is Arte sleeping…”\n“Oh, you came at a good time. Dorothy. Listen to what I have to say…”\n“Oh my, oh my, oh my…”\nArte said she stayed up all night, was it?\nShe’ll sleep for at least four hours.\n‘Then as payback for making me worry, I’ll tease you to the fullest, Siwoo.’\n___________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nObsession ON\nFan art has been uploaded in the announcements.

      "content": "TN: Thank James Baily for the chapter. I’m really just doing a 3 person rotation now.\n“Arte, wake up. Arte.”\n“Zzz… Zzz…”\n“…Arte? Arte?”\nI heard someone’s voice. A voice that wanted to wake me up.\nI’m so sleepy I could die, and you’re waking me up?\nAnnoyed, I tossed and turned, and the voice disappeared, making me feel good.\nThe hard but warm and comforting  pillow brought me a sense of stability.\nSmiling with satisfaction, I fumbled around, looking for the  pillow I was hugging, but my hands grasped nothing.\n…Strange. It should definitely be nearby.\n“What if she wakes?! At times like this, you should quietly stroke her hair!”\n“…But my legs are starting to hurt.”\n“Can’t you even do that much for your beloved?!”\n“Love or whatnot, it’s been four hours already.”\n“Shh. She’ll wake up.”\nWhen I was startled that the pillow that should exist didn’t, the voices entered my ears again.\nThe moment I was about to toss and turn again in protest, I paused, questioning the content of the conversation.\n…Legs?\nHuh. Come to think of it, did I have such a hard  pillow at home?\nI don’t think I did?\n“…Thankfully, she didn’t. Let her sleep a bit more, Siwoo. She looks tired.”\n“I know, I know. I just wanted to ask a bit about yesterday’s events.”\n“That can wait. Let’s let her sleep more for now. She must have been really exhausted.”\nHearing Amelia’s words to let me sleep more, Dorothy and Siwoo agreed.\nBut it was already too late.\nMy sleepiness had fled long ago.\nHonestly, I wanted to sleep more, but I couldn’t fall asleep.\n…Why am I sleeping amidst these three in the first place?\nUnable to understand the situation, I tried to think about what happened before I fell asleep.\nHmm, let’s see.\nI couldn’t fall asleep, so I stayed up all night.\nI had no choice but to force myself awake and leave for the academy.\nI remember Lyla and Lee Ha-Yul looking at me strangely as I staggered.\n…And then? What happened next?\nArriving at the academy, I discovered Siwoo and Amelia having a conversation.\nThe moment I saw Siwoo, I think I had a thought.\nThe reason I couldn’t sleep was because I lacked warmth.\nAnd when I was in Siwoo’s arms yesterday, it was definitely warm.\nI’m sure I had that thought, and then…\nI could feel my face slowly heating up.\nI remembered everything. Why I’m sleeping here. What I had done.\nI, I, I must be crazy…?!\nWhat I’m resting my head on now… they definitely said it was a leg.\nIt’s not Amelia or Dorothy’s leg. Those two couldn’t possibly be this hard.\nThen there’s only one person left.\nThe person who complained his legs hurt. Only that person.\n“She’s really out.”\n“She said she stayed up all night. Of course she’ll sleep well.”\n“Is that so? Still, I’m glad. Arte seems alright otherwise.”\nIt seemed no one noticed I was awake.\nEven the teachers had difficulty judging if I was asleep or awake.\nIt’s really convenient at times like this.\n“But is it really true? That story.”\n“If it’s hard to believe, you don’t have to. We know well it’s an absurd story too.”\n“No. I’ll believe it. I trust you’re not the type to joke around with a story like this.”\n“I appreciate that.”\nDorothy let out a small sigh and muttered.\n“The fact that Arte is actually a member of Arachne and has been causing various incidents at the academy… It’s hard to believe.”\n“If it’s hard to believe, you can pretend you didn’t hear it even now.”\n“No, I believe it. Definitely.”\n“Why are you so certain?”\n“I saw it. I saw Arte killing someone.”\n“…What?”\nFor a moment, I almost jumped up in surprise.\n…She saw it? Me killing someone? When?\n“Do you remember, Siwoo? That Übermensch dragon. The person who controlled the wind.”\n“…Yeah. I’ll never forget it in my life.”\n“Me too. Because that person died right before my eyes.”\nWith Dorothy’s words, I finally realized.\nWhy did Siwoo, who showed no signs of growth, push that dragon so hard.\nWhy he collapsed as if fainting after a single attack.\nHe had received Dorothy’s enhancement.\nHow? Where? Those things didn’t matter. It was something that had already passed long ago.\n“Arte killed that person in an instant. It was a perfect sneak attack.”\nWas she talking about that?\nDorothy’s voice trembled slightly.\n“I couldn’t come out then. It was the first time I saw someone die, and I was scared.”\n“… Wasn’t the identity of the killer unknown?”\n“It was unknown. Because Arte didn’t reveal it. No, that’s not what’s important. Arte was filled with ecstasy.”\n“Ecstasy?”\n“Yes.”\nDorothy retraced the memory she saw once more and spoke with a voice full of conviction.\nIt was ecstasy.\n“‘ A puppet shouldn’t injure a person. You crossed the line,’ or something like that.”\n“… That’s.”\nSiwoo and Amelia realized.\nWhy Dorothy believed their words.\nShe had already seen it directly.\nArte talking about puppets and humans.\n“…But Dorothy. Why didn’t you mention that?”\n“Huh?”\n“You’ve been acting as if you hadn’t noticed anything until now. You even got along well with Arte.”\nRight. I had no idea at all. Until yesterday, I couldn’t even imagine that Dorothy had seen that.\nBecause she acted the same as always as if she hadn’t noticed anything.\n“There was no need to mention it.”\n“No need to mention it…”\n“She killed someone. Of course it’s wrong. But is it also wrong to kill a villain who tried to kill a friend?”\nDorothy treated us the same as always.\nAs if nothing had happened. The same as usual.\nBut she knew everything.\n“Sometimes it’s important to cover for a friend’s flaws.”\n“…Right, I see.”\nWith my sleepiness completely gone, I was listening to their conversation.\nDorothy, Amelia, Siwoo,\nThey all believed in me.\nThey consider me a friend, justify my actions, and believe in me.\nThe only one who can’t believe in such people is me alone.\nI was just consoling myself, saying everyone except Siwoo is merely a puppet.\n“The key to helping Arte is you, Siwoo.”\n“…Me?”\n“Yes. It can only be you. The only one Arte considers human.”\nSo that was exposed too.\nI thought she was just an ordinary sub-heroine with no definite character like Amelia.\n“‘ A mere puppet attacked a human.’ That’s what Arte said. In other words, Arte sees everyone in the world as puppets. Except for you.”\n“…”\n“I don’t know the reason she came to think that way. I don’t know the boundary between humans and puppets she speaks of either.”\n“Me neither. I haven’t figured that out.”\n“If you want to stop her from committing more sins, you’ll have to make her see other people as humans. It’ll be hard though.”\n“That way, she’ll hesitate to hurt people.”\nSaying that, Dorothy stroked my hair.\n“…You have a good eye.”\n“Because I have a caster-type ability. Shouldn’t I have at least this much insight?”\n“Ah, that. Wasn’t it just like a spell or something?”\n“It is a spell. I’m just putting on airs a bit… Still, didn’t I seem a bit like a witch?”\n“Yes, Miss Witch.”\n“Hehe.”\nThey were thinking of me.\nDorothy and Amelia. They were having a conversation about me, considering me a friend.\nI know. Of course I know.\nI’ve never had friends who cared for me this much, even before I was kidnapped into this world.\nAmazingly, I have so many people who care for me in this short time.\n…But I couldn’t believe it.\nBecause I never know when they might betray me.\nWhat if the Author changes the settings for those two?\nIf she introduces a new evil force for the development of the novel and adds a setting that Dorothy was actually a spy for the organization?\nEven this conversation right now would become a lie.\nDorothy’s concerns for me would turn into acting to deceive us.\nThat’s why I can’t believe it. That’s why I close my heart.\nI suppress the emotions rushing to break through the tightly closed bolt.\nThere’s only one person I can trust.\nThe only person I can believe in.\nOnly Siwoo, who the Author’s changes don’t affect.\nAmelia and Dorothy are friends. But for how long?\nThe Author changes the settings on a whim.\nShe even changed the basic setting of the world.\nShe changed a world with an ordinary academy into a world where gates opened 500 years ago.\nI don’t know when Amelia and Dorothy’s settings might change on a whim too.\nI suppressed all the emotions knocking on the  door, trying to break through the bolt.\nAs I thought, there’s only one being I can trust.\nJust Siwoo.\nPretending to sleep talk, I snuggled a bit into Siwoo’s embrace.\nIt was definitely the warmest and hardest  pillow.\n________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nI feel like my  writing is better than usual these days.\nI feel motivated again.\nThe answer is romance.",

      "content": "“You woke up.”\n“Yes, yes… I’m sorry…”\n“No, it’s fine. Let’s get you signed in first.”\nHer face flushed red, Arte got up primly as if she hadn’t heard anything.\nBut such an act didn’t work on Siwoo.\nArte seems to be forgetting, but his ability is intuition.\n‘…But even I’m doubting whether it’s really that.’\nHe knew that Arte was already awake.\nThat’s why he didn’t bother stopping Amelia and Dorothy from saying those things to Arte as they looked at her.\n‘We can help you. We’re your friends.’\nEven if they said that, there’s no way Arte would accept it.\nHe thought it was a natural opportunity to convey their thoughts to Arte, so he didn’t tell them she was awake.\n…It didn’t seem to go as planned though.\nShe was blushing as if she had made a spectacle of herself, but she didn’t seem to believe in them.\nShe was treating Amelia and Dorothy the same way she always did.\n‘Well, it’ll be fine. I didn’t expect it to succeed in one go.’\nThe fact that Arte wasn’t eliminated by that Author is proof that she needs her too.\nThere was still time left.\n‘Arte thinks only she and I are human.’\nHe didn’t know the reason, but it was clear that he was special to her.\nThen it should be fine to think there’s still a chance.\nHe made up his mind to help her accept other people as human too, besides him.\n‘…Before that, one thing.’\nHe tried his best to ignore it, but he couldn’t help it.\nHe had to talk about this.\n“Arte. Can you move away a bit?”\n“…Why?”\n“Why, you ask…”\n‘It’s because you’re sticking too close, so it’s hot.’\nNo, it wasn’t just because it’s hot.\nShe clung to him like a child sticking to their parents’ back, so the students’ gazes were gathering.\n“Those two, were they always like that?”\n“They always went around together, and I guess they’ve finally…”\nRight. Let’s say even the gazes around them are like that.\nHe’s used to Amelia and Dorothy’s fuss now, so those gazes don’t hurt anymore.\nBut there are some things you can’t get used to, no matter how much you experience them.\n“I’m a guy after all…”\n“? Yes, I know you’re a guy.”\n“No, I don’t think you do.”\n‘If you know I’m a guy, you shouldn’t be clinging to me this much, right?’\nBecause of Arte clinging to him to the point of being burdensome, he could only sweat and be nervous.\nIt wasn’t because it was hot.\nIt’s hot since summer is still in full swing, but he was sweating for a different reason.\nSoft skin.\nThe scent of her skin stimulating his nose.\nEven the restless behavior when it seems like she’ll move away a bit.\nIt was too much stimulation for him.\n“Hey, Arte. Siwoo looks pitiful, so move away a bit. Okay?”\n“That’s right. People are watching too…”\n“…Alright.”\nHe didn’t know if she pitied him or minded the gazes around them.\nAmelia separated the two.\nBut Arte didn’t seem to like it.\nShe kept fidgeting her fingers, looking uncomfortable about something.\nNo matter how he thought about it, Arte’s behavior was strange.\nHer suddenly staying up all night.\nHer trying to cling to him.\nLike a puppy showing anxiety symptoms.\n…Could it be.\n“Arte. I’m going to the restroom for a bit…”\n“…”\n“Arte?”\n“C-come back soon. I’ll be waiting…”\n“…Okay. I’ll be right back.”\nLeaving Arte, who had stopped in front of the restroom, Siwoo entered.\nHe thought she might try to follow him here.\nBut it seemed it wasn’t to that extent.\n“Phew…”\nFeeling irritation rising, he wet his face with the cold water from the faucet.\nHe thought Arte was showing strange behavior often today.\nBut it might be more serious than he thought.\n“…Anxiety. Is it anxiety when I’m out of her sight?”\nHe didn’t know people’s psychology accurately. I haven’t learned that professionally after all.\nBut I could tell Arte was feeling anxious.\nWhy? For what reason?\nHe didn’t know the exact reason. It’s probably something related to that Author.\nThat’s the only thing that could change Arte’s attitude in a single day.\nHe raised his head and looked at the mirror.\nHe saw the face of a man frowning as if irritated.\n…This won’t do.\n‘I decided to help Arte, didn’t I?’\nIf he made an anxious expression, wouldn’t Arte feel it too?\n“…Alright.”\nArte is in an emotionally difficult situation.\n‘Then, as her friend, I should help her.’\nSiwoo reaffirmed his resolve once more.\nTo make Arte able to smile happily.\n***\n“…”\nI swung my legs back and forth, wondering when Siwoo would come out.\nWhen is he coming out? Now? It seems about time for him to come out. Why isn’t he coming out?\n“Arte. Why are you suddenly like this? Let’s wait a bit more. Not much time has passed.”\n“I know.”\n“…Hmm.”\nI know.\nRight now, I’m in a situation that’s hard to see as normal. I know that better than anyone.\nA situation that’s hard to see as normal no matter how you look at it.\nAnyone could see that my state was hard to call fine.\nYeah, I know well.\n“When is he coming out? When is he coming out…”\nBut even if I knew, there was no way to solve it.\nI’m anxious. I’m anxious. I’m anxious.\nWhy isn’t he coming out?\nWhy is it taking this long?\nBad imaginations were shaking my mind.\nDid a new villain appear?\nOr is he flustered because his ability suddenly broke?\nCould the inside of the restroom be actually a portal to my world?\nI know these are absurd delusions.\nHe’ll probably walk out fine if I wait a bit longer without doing anything.\nBut I couldn’t bear the anxiety.\nNo matter how I thought about it, I couldn’t erase the suspicion that something might have happened.\nThe Author isn’t talking to me. Not yesterday, and not today either.\nWhy is that?\nCould it be she’s trying to find someone to replace me?\nIs that why I’m still alive like this?\nIs she just keeping me alive for a bit until she finds a replacement?\n…No. Let’s not think about it.\nFor now, think about the protagonist.\nWhy isn’t he coming out? Why isn’t there any news?\n“Ah, he’s out.”\n“…!”\nAt Amelia’s words, I hurriedly raised my head and looked ahead.\nSiwoo was approaching us, looking more put-together than before.\n“Sorry. Am I a bit late?”\n“It’s fine. Let’s go quickly. You said it was a robbery in progress?”\n“Yeah. Since it’s a first offense, there might not be many points… But it’s good to have them anyway.”\nAh.\nI could clearly realize.\nThat my current state isn’t normal.\nThe anxiety I felt when Siwoo wasn’t in sight disappeared the moment I saw him.\nI won’t be replaced as long as I’m in front of his eyes.\nAs long as he’s in front of my eyes, he won’t die to a mysterious assassin.\nWe’re watching each other.\n“Arte? Are you okay?”\n“…Yes, I’m fine.”\nI smiled brightly at him as he asked me.\nYeah, I’m fine.\nAs long as you’re in front of my eyes.\nAs long as I’m in front of your eyes.\nNo matter how out of control the Author goes, she can’t change the protagonist.\nWhat if I suddenly disappear from the protagonist’s sight?\nThen he’ll chase after me. Because he’s a good person who cherishes his friends.\nIf that happens, it’ll be troublesome for the Author. The development will be set.\nSo I can relax a little.\nOn the other hand, I need to keep watching the protagonist too.\nThat way, I can protect him from this world.\nThe only human besides me. The protagonist of this world. It’ll be big trouble if he dies.\nIt would be terrible if the Author got disappointed and left after destroying the world.\n“Well then, shall we go?”\n“Yeah.”\nAmelia, Dorothy, me, Siwoo.\nThe four of us have probably already established ourselves as important characters in the Author’s story.\nBut I don’t know when Amelia and Dorothy might betray me.\nThe only one I can trust is Siwoo.\nJust Siwoo\n“Hey, Siwoo.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Hmm… How should I say this…”\nI saw Amelia calling Siwoo and having a conversation.\nIt made me uncomfortable.\nNormally, I shouldn’t have any thoughts, but…\nNo matter how I thought about it, I couldn’t erase the thought that I was strange, but I still couldn’t hide my discomfort.\nI hurriedly squeezed in between the two and grabbed Siwoo’s sleeve urgently.\n“…Arte?”\n“Let’s go quickly.”\n“Huh? W-wait a second.”\n“Quickly.”\nWhy am I doing this?\nIf I act this strangely, they’ll look at me weirdly.\nAs expected. The three of them looked at me with startled expressions.\nBut I didn’t regret it.\nBecause I could feel my heart gradually calm down.\nNo matter how I thought about it, it was infuriating.\nThere are only two humans in this world, you and me.\nWhy can you be so carefree?\nIs it because you’re the protagonist?\nI complained in my mind, unable to say it out loud.\nI didn’t like seeing Siwoo acting so carefree.\n…Should I kidnap him?\nKidnap him, lock him up in the basement, have Lyla, Spira, and Lee Ha-Yul bring him food, and watch him 24/7?\nI suddenly had that thought, but I shook my head.\nNo. Siwoo has to save the world.\nKidnapping won’t do.\nI felt a little regretful.\n_____________________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nArte is broken.\nThat was quick… well, whatever.",

      "content": "“Ahaha.”\nThe girl laughed.\nWith an expression free of any worries or concerns. She laughed as if she was so very happy.\n(…Hey, that Reader of yours looks quite unstable?)\n“Right? Maybe it’s because I haven’t said anything in a while. Do you think she believes she was abandoned?”\nShe watched  the Reader looking very anxious.\nHey Author-nim? Did I do something wrong?\nThat anguished appearance was so lovely.\n“It’s like an abandoned  kitten crying!”\nMeow, meow.\nA  kitten crying out to a person to save it.\nA kitten desperately clinging because it will die if it doesn’t receive help.\nIt reminded her of a cute, trembling, frightened kitten.\nThe way she clings to the Protagonist, trying to find warmth in any way she can.\n“How cute. This is why I like  the Reader!”\n(Sigh…)\nAs if she would kill the Reader.\nIs it because she’s needlessly worrying and has seen many things?\nIt was cute how she feared she might be replaced.\n(Still, she’s the soul you brought. Why not treat her a bit better?)\n“You’re telling me?”\nThe girl turned her head sharply with a sulky face.\nNo matter how she thought about it, she wasn’t in a position to listen to those guys.\nBecause what those guys were doing was even worse.\n“Always playing around with regression and whatnot. Saying you want to see a great war, building a tower, putting a whole race inside, and having them fight.”\n(…I have nothing to say to that.)\n“And as you know, I don’t want to kill  the Reader either!”\n(Well, there’s no way you could kill her. Since you like that world so much.)\n“Of course. I can’t abandon it. No, I won’t abandon it!”\n‘Do you know how hard it is to take control of a world? There’s no way I could abandon it.’\nHow could she abandon  the Reader after obtaining this chance? Was she crazy?\n“I’ll enjoy it before she fully breaks.”\nInvading another world is quite a difficult task.\nBecause it’s impossible to just enter due to the world’s nature of rejecting foreign substances.\nShe had to somehow bring a human soul from outside and mix it with a part of her body to infiltrate.\nOnly then could she avoid being bounced out.\nAfter going through such hardships to invade this world, it would be a waste to throw it away.\nWho knows how many centuries it would take to find another terminal? Then, it would be meaningless.\n“Well, there’s no need to tell  the Reader she wasn’t abandoned.”\nIt was also amusing how  the Reader mistakenly thought that she might have been abandoned.\nIs it because she was originally male?  The Reader didn’t seem to have any special feelings towards the Protagonist.\n‘But tada! I just didn’t talk to her for a bit, and my goodness.’\nLook at her clinging to the Protagonist out of anxiety.\nShe was pondering momentarily about what to say to the Reader, not responding.\nIt was so cute how she was half-panicked, clinging to him.\n“How is it? Romance is fun too, right?”\n(…Hmm. I hate to admit it, but this one’s pretty good.)\n(Shall we try it too?)\n(Let’s watch this a bit more first. It should be fine to try after that world is destroyed.)\nSeeing the other guys taking an interest in this world, she felt her pride rise.\nIt felt like she became a trendsetter.\n“I wonder how  the Reader will act from now on. I’m looking forward to it.”\nIt seemed the distance between the leads narrowed a lot.\nWhat actions will she take to entertain us?\nThe pure girl began watching  the Reader again, not hiding her pounding heart.\n***\n“…Alright. This should be good.”\n“Urgh…! Let, let go! To the likes of you…!”\n“Stay still. If you want to walk out with your limbs intact.”\n“Eek!”\nThe likes of you, he says.\nNot liking him talking to Siwoo like that, I spoke curtly.\nFortunately, he seemed to be a decent guy for a villain, quickly realizing his mistake.\nAfter that, he began walking to the academy with us without a word.\n“We caught quite a lot.”\n“Indeed.”\n“The villains we caught today alone are a considerable number. We’ve basically secured a high rank.”\nThe reason I was so certain was simple.\nCopycats were appearing after Arachne stopped their activities, right?\nThen, if Arachne is active, they’ll stop out of fear.\nMoreover, after drawing spider patterns in the copycats’ houses and making a mess, they all started laying low.\nArachne’s target is always villains.\nAlthough their numbers may be high now, the number of villains will decrease by the time Arachne starts activities again.\nThe ways to earn points itself will decrease.\nSo, if we earn points now, a high rank is guaranteed.\n“You’re reliable, Arte.”\n“Of course!”\nI looked at Siwoo with my usual smile.\nI won’t make a spectacle like before. I’ve completely calmed down.\nWhat happened yesterday and today was just a…\n“…Then, shall we part ways here for today?”\n“What?”\nP-part ways?\nSuddenly?\n“We don’t need to earn any more points. You seemed to lack sleep too. Wouldn’t it be better to go back early and rest?”\n“T-that’s… right.”\nPart ways. The time has come for me and Siwoo to part.\nThe moment I realized that fact, my breathing started getting heavy.\nHuff, huff…\nNo, I’m fine. We’re just parting ways.\nThere’s no particular reason. It’s just time, and he’s telling me to go back and rest out of concern for me.\nThere’s no reason for me to tremble this much. No reason.\nMy mind turned blank.\nMy reason was to try to convince myself that parting ways is natural and that there’s nothing wrong with what he said.\nBut my body?\nMy breathing started getting heavy when I realized it was time to part.\nNo matter how I thought about it, I myself knew best that my state wasn’t normal.\nI can’t show the Protagonist this unstable state.\nSomehow suppressing my breathing, I showed my usual smile.\n“Let’s do that. I’ll be going then…!”\n“Arte! Wait a…”\nI left without listening to what Siwoo was trying to say.\nIf I had stayed longer, I would have shown Siwoo a strange side of me.\nI had no choice.\n“Huff, huff, huff…”\nMy breathing was ragged.\nTo think I would be this mentally cornered by the fact that I have to part from Siwoo.\nWhy?\n“Phew… Haaah…”\nAfter somehow calming my breathing, I began following Siwoo.\nSeparate from the self-loathing I felt for being cornered to this extent, I had to watch over him.\nBecause it was true that I didn’t know what the Author might do.\nI had to somehow watch over the Protagonist.\nCatching my breath which was gradually finding stability, I began following Siwoo.\n***\n“Delicious. Delicious. Mir, isn’t it delicious?”\n“Yeah, Annie. It’s really delicious.”\nIn a city turned to ruins with corpses strewn about…\nA girl in a tattered hood was muttering something while continuously putting something in her mouth.\n“Humans are humans, but magical beasts are especially exquisite. Delicious, delicious…”\n“You shouldn’t discriminate against monsters, Annie. It’s good for everyone to be equal.”\n“Okay. I got it, Mir.”\nThe girl kept talking even while ceaselessly putting something in her mouth.\nBecause the girl’s mouth wasn’t just one.\n“…Ah. Something else grew again.”\n“It’s proof you’ve become equal, Annie. Don’t worry…”\n“Alright, Mir. Your words were always right.”\nIf people saw her conversing alone, they would have found it eerie.\n…No, the moment they saw her appearance, they would have either fled or tried to kill her without hesitation.\nBecause it was hard to see the girl’s appearance inside the hood as human.\n“…I think I grew more teeth.”\n“It’s just a 3rd-grade magical beast, Annie… It’s so very weak. Right?”\n“Yeah, that’s right. I see…”\n“To make the world equal, we need greater power. Overwhelming power.”\nThe girl kept muttering to herself.\nWe need great power. Overwhelming power.\nThe memory of that day when they failed right before the plan’s success came to mind.\nShe was hindered by a boy who looked insignificant, and she died in an instant from the sudden intrusion of a powerful being.\nIf all of them had been gathered, that wouldn’t have happened.\nSpira, Minos, Marmo, Annie, Mir, Lan, Rabi, Havi, Ovis, Chris, Equus, and Lupo.\nThe story would have been different if the twelve of them had gathered.\nIf it weren’t for that damned spiders, Mir wouldn’t have died either.\n“We lacked power, Mir. We were weak.”\n“… That’s right, Annie. We were weak.”\n“If it weren’t for those spiders…! If it weren’t for them…!”\nShe chewed on the magical beast’s bones, filled with resentment.\nThey were weak. Weaker than their enemies.\nThat’s why they died.\n‘They probably think we were defeated. That we were crushed by a mighty power.’\nBut they’re wrong. They haven’t been crushed yet.\nBecause a small fragment remains.\n“Haha. They’ll regret not killing us… Right, Marmo?”\nThe hooded girl unwrapped the bundle and looked at the corpse she had painstakingly obtained.\nAlthough it was hard to identify due to the collapsed form, she could tell.\nThis distinctive shape of the skull. The pointed front teeth.\nBecause it was someone she had seen many times.\n“Wait, my friends. Let’s go achieve our goal together. I’ll be right there.”\nThe insane specter yearning for power began to move.\n_______________________\nAuthor’s Notes\nRuminas-nim, have a good day!",

      "content": "Arte gasped for breath, clutching at her chest.\nThunk, thunk.\nI tried pulling on the locked front door in vain.\nThe tightly shut door wouldn’t budge no matter what.\nAfraid of getting caught, I hastily let go of the handle.\n“…It won’t open.”\nDespite expecting it wouldn’t open, an inexplicable disappointment washed over me.\nI could cut through the door if I wanted to force my way in.\nBut then I would definitely get caught.\nGiving up, I watched Siwoo through the gap in the curtains, his figure faintly illuminated by the bright interior lights.\nFor some reason, unlike usual, the curtains weren’t fully drawn.\nSo, I was able to observe Siwoo more easily than I normally do.\nHmm, I’m not sure why the curtains are open tonight, but it’s convenient.\nIt feels like I lucked out.\nSince it’s usually hard to see what Siwoo is up to…\nSpeaking of which, what is he doing right now?\nIt looked like he was using his computer to search for something.\n“…What is it? Hmm, I can’t see well.”\nHe seems to be looking something up, but I can’t determine what’s on the screen from here.\nAfter searching for a while, Siwoo sighed and started making a phone call to someone.\nThen he went back to searching.\nWith the phone still at his ear, Siwoo was absorbed in something.\n…Who is it?\nI desperately wanted to check the name of the person Siwoo was talking to on his phone right then.\nBut it was impossible.\nI could infiltrate Siwoo’s room, sure.\nBut then Siwoo might judge me as an enemy.\nI can’t have that.\nSuppressing my fervent desire to find out the contents of the conversation, I simply watched over Siwoo.\n“…Nothing seems different from usual.”\nThe only things out of the ordinary were him making a phone call to someone and briefly using his computer to search for something.\nSiwoo’s day seemed no different than any other.\nSwinging his sword in the yard, eating meals, washing up.\nThe same boring routine day after day.\nThankfully, it didn’t appear like any assassins had come after Siwoo.\nSighing in relief, I decided to head back as usual.\nSince it seemed Siwoo had gone to sleep.\nI should get going too.\nThe moment I was about to leave Siwoo’s house, the curtains now drawn, I felt something off with my body.\nMy chest felt tight, cold sweat ran down my back, and I couldn’t steady my legs.\n“Heuk, heuk, I…I can’t breathe…”\nI couldn’t breathe.\nEven pounding on my chest in distress changed nothing.\nThe sudden symptoms filled me with bewilderment and fear.\nWhat the hell is this all of a sudden…!\n“Heuk, cough… A-Author-n…”\nThe Author was the only one I could think of who might be able to do something like this to me.\nSo I called out her name, my voice laced with consternation at this abrupt turn of events.\nBut still, no answer came. The Author had remained silent for days now.\n…Come to think of it, did she say she could modify me?\nI couldn’t remember. My mind went utterly blank.\n“D-Don’t help me… Don’t help…!”\nI cried out almost like a scream, forcibly squeezing the scant oxygen left in my lungs.\nThis can’t be happening.\nThere’s no way the Author can help me. She couldn’t possibly.\nShe hasn’t done anything to me.\nThis has to be… right…\nSomething must be wrong with how I was made. It has to be.\nThe Author couldn’t have done anything.\nBecause if that were possible, then I’d be…\nNo different than the people I’ve killed.\nThat absolutely cannot be the case.\nI already know the answer. I’m human. Those people were puppets.\nThat’s how it was meant to be.\nThat’s how I must have been created.\n“Keuk, keuh…”\nWas it because I forced myself to expel my breath?\nIt became even harder to breathe, and I clutched at my throat.\nHeuk, heuk.\nI gasped for air however I could, but it wasn’t enough.\nHyperventilating didn’t help either.\nIs this how I die?\nSuddenly? But why?\nJust as my mind started going hazy, the sudden warmth of hands grasping my shoulders brought me back to my senses.\n“Arte! Arte! Are you okay?!”\nPerhaps because he rushed out, Siwoo was barefoot in his pajamas, repeatedly calling my name in a fluster.\n“Huu, huu… You’re okay, right?”\n“S-Siwoo…?”\n“Yeah. It’s me, Arte. Are you alright?”\nHow did he find me?\nI really thought I might die.\nSince I couldn’t hear the Author’s voice, I figured I couldn’t be sure of my safety either.\nBut with Siwoo suddenly appearing by my side, my breathing gradually stabilized.\n“Thank you. I’m okay now, thanks to you.”\nI’m not sure why, but my breathing suddenly got difficult to the point I thought I would die.\nIt’s not like I got better just because Siwoo was here, but…\nSince it seemed he ran out in a hurry to help me, I thanked him.\nHowever, this was troublesome.\nIf he asked me why I was here, I didn’t have an answer prepared.\nSo, after expressing my gratitude, I tried to extricate myself from the situation quickly.\nThat is, if not for Siwoo’s next words.\n“Where are you going in that condition? Rest for a bit before you leave.”\n“…What?”\n“I can tell you’re trying to go somewhere. But you don’t look well, so rest for a bit first.”\nWhere Siwoo gestured, I saw a door.\nThe door I had just failed to open a moment ago.\nThe door that had been tightly shut now stood wide open as if welcoming me.\n“You don’t need to ask me how I knew… You’re aware of my ability, aren’t you?”\nIntuition, huh.\nWhat a convenient skill.\nPutting aside what kind of intuition lets you know, even something like that…\nThere likely isn’t any other ability as useful as that one.\nIt could help you avoid getting hit in battle and seems extremely handy for everyday life, too.\nI felt a bit envious.\nWith my abilities, the most I can do is slice things or leave my body to silk threads to admire the night scenery.\n“Don’t refuse, just come in.”\n“…Then, please excuse my intrusion for a bit.”\nI was happy to be able to enter Siwoo’s house.\n…But why did I want to go inside in the first place?\nI couldn’t remember. Oh well, as long as it feels nice, it’s fine.\n***\n“Phew… That startled me…”\nLeaving Arte briefly in the living room, Siwoo entered the bathroom and tried to calm his racing heart.\nFiguring Arte had probably returned by now, Siwoo drew the curtains and changed into his sleepwear before lying on the bed.\nBut the moment he did, a sudden unease overcame him, and he rushed outside.\nThere, he saw Arte clutching her throat, overtaken by panic.\nIt seemed she was having difficulty breathing.\n“…This is serious.”\nSiwoo was now certain of the new issue he had suspected with Arte.\nThat night, Siwoo had used his computer to look up Arte’s various symptoms.\nSeparation anxiety.\nExtreme unease about being apart from one’s object of attachment.\nBecause Arte’s behavior that afternoon reminded him of it.\nClinging to him to sleep, showing distress when he’s not around.\nThere was also how flustered she got earlier when he suggested parting ways for the day to test things.\nAnd her state just now.\nSiwoo had no choice but to acknowledge it.\nIt appeared Arte became extremely anxious being separated from him.\n“What a headache.”\nHe’s truly grateful that Arte thinks of him so much.\nHowever, I don’t want that to go so far as to cause her physical harm.\nSiwoo smiled bitterly at the heavy feeling in his chest, then quickly decided to go outside.\nIf Arte was suffering from separation anxiety, then even this situation wasn’t safe.\n“Ah, are you finished?”\n“Yeah.”\nThankfully, Arte seemed to be okay.\nSiwoo sighed in relief, hand over his heart.\nHe never wanted to see her like that again.\nArte gasping for breath, clutching at her throat.\nWitnessing that once was more than enough.\n“Um, but is there really a need for me to stay here any longer…?”\n“Sleep here tonight.”\n“What?!”\n“It’s late, you know. It’d be dangerous for a girl. You’re aware public safety has been poor lately.”\n“B-But…”\nArte isn’t an ordinary girl–she’s a member of Arachne.\nShe should have the strength to protect herself, at least.\nBut that’s only when she’s in peak condition.\nArte is mentally unstable right now.\nMoreover, seeing how she’s talking about going back, she doesn’t even know why she had trouble breathing.\nIf her breathing were to become labored again on the way home with no one around to help, it’d\nbe a huge problem.\n‘As long as she sticks by me, there’s no reason for that, right?’\nI’ve resolved to help Arte no matter what when she’s struggling, so Siwoo was confident he could handle at least this much.\n“Sleep here. If you go back now, you’ll be late again tomorrow, won’t you?”\n“…Well, if you insist that much.”\nFortunately, Arte accepted his suggestion.\n“So, would it be alright for me to sleep in the living room or guest room? And do you have any spare blankets…”\n“No. Let’s sleep together.”\n“What?!”\nHe knows this sounds absurd.\nIf he said this kind of thing to anyone else, he’d deserve to get sued for sexual harassment, no question.\nHowever, that thought never even crossed Siwoo’s mind. He made the suggestion purely for Arte’s sake.\n‘If being apart makes her anxious, then I just need to stay by her side. Isn’t that right?’\n“Don’t worry, Arte. It’s not dangerous. I’ll watch over you.”\nTo alleviate Arte’s anxiety, Siwoo vowed to stick close to her no matter what.\nBut Siwoo failed to realize,\nHow his words would come across to Arte.\nAuthor’s Notes\nThose who experienced hyperventilation would know,\nIt really overwhelms your mind.",

      "content": "How did it come to this?\nLooking around, I saw a neatly organized room.\nA place I’d seen once before. Siwoo’s room.\nThough I’d seen this tidy room once before, it felt different somehow.\n“Where did I put that spare blanket…”\nSiwoo started searching for a blanket for me to use.\nThat guy really doesn’t think anything through.\nI sighed in exasperation.\nFor a moment, I almost misunderstood.\nThough there was no reason for Siwoo to say such things to me…\nI’d wondered if he’d fallen for me for some unknown reason.\nBut he really hadn’t thought anything of it at all.\n…Is this because he’s the protagonist?\nI never thought he’d say something so easily misunderstood.\n“Arte, is something wrong?”\n“It’s nothing.”\nWow, that startled me.\nI was surprised when Siwoo suddenly spoke to me.\nHe noticed right away, even though I just glanced at him.\nHe’s so perceptive about some things.\nWhy can’t he realize his words and actions could be misinterpreted?\n“Ah, here it is.”\nSiwoo’s face lit up as he found the blanket.\nHe spread it on the floor and lay down on it.\n…Huh?\n“Um, that blanket…?”\n“It’s for me to use. You should rest comfortably on the bed, Arte.”\n“Ah, I see.”\nIt was a small, simple gesture of consideration.\nThe kind of courtesy often exchanged when visiting a friend’s house.\nSomething you might do when visiting a friend or when a friend comes to your place.\nSiwoo probably didn’t think much of it either.\nIt was likely just a minor courtesy, as always.\nBut that small act of consideration warmed my heart.\n…It would have been even better if not for one thing bothering me.\n“But do you really need to sleep on the floor…?”\n“Hm? Why?”\n“There are several rooms here. Couldn’t you sleep in another room…?”\nI still couldn’t understand.\nWith multiple rooms available, why did he want to sleep in the same room?\n“…Do you really want to know?”\n“Huh?”\nWhat’s with the serious face all of a sudden?\nSiwoo’s expression hardened as if asking if I really wanted to hear it.\nHmm, I expected a casual answer.\nWasn’t Siwoo not seeing me as a woman?\nDid he actually have some reason for needing to sleep in the same room as me?\nI looked at Siwoo’s serious expression.\nHe was still staring at me with a stern face.\n“…Yes, I’d like to know.”\nWhen you talk so seriously, how can I not be curious?\nI thought it was just the protagonist’s typical oblivious behavior, treating me like a close friend.\nBut there was a reason.\nMy curiosity was piqued.\n“Haa, alright. Then I’ll step outside for a moment.”\n“…Huh?”\n“It’ll be fine, just for a bit. You’ll understand soon.”\nSiwoo informed me.\nHe’d go outside for a moment.\nLooking worriedly at me, confused by this sudden turn of events, Siwoo stepped out as he said he would.\nSaying he’d be back soon.\n…And a short while later. I trembled with anxiety that returned once again.\nAs breathing became harder, I was bewildered by the renewed sense of helplessness.\nSiwoo came back into the room, bowing his head apologetically.\n“…How was it?”\n“W-What is this…”\nI’m not stupid.\nIf a similar situation happens twice in a short time, I can guess the reason.\nWhat happened just before it suddenly became hard to breathe?\nSiwoo disappeared from my sight.\nJust because of that small thing, I end up like this?\n“Arte. I told you before. I know who you are.”\n“…”\n“The next day, you were late and clung to me in your sleep. Remember?”\n“D-Did that happen…?”\n“Since then, you’ve seemed a bit… unstable.”\nI wonder if it’s okay for him to tell me this.\nWith that kind of expression, Siwoo spoke to me.\n“I had a hunch, but seeing you struggle to breathe properly today, I became certain.”\n“W-What do you mean?”\n“That you seem anxious about being separated from me.”\nSiwoo had come to the same conclusion as me.\nBut that’s why it was even more shocking.\nBecause it seemed that what I was thinking was true.\n“That’s why I suggested we sleep together. Because you looked like you were having a hard time.”\n“…Ah.”\nI felt ashamed for thinking he was oblivious.\nSiwoo was trying to help me while I was disparaging him.\n“Th-Thank y-”\n“And… There was something I wanted to say.”\n“Y-Yes…? Something you wanted to say?”\nI was about to express my gratitude, but Siwoo cut me off.\n“We glossed over it before… But I think we need to talk about it properly.”\n“…”\n“…Amelia said it was dangerous, but I think this is the right time to discuss it.”\nMuttering that, Siwoo closed the open window.\nAs if to ensure I had no escape route.\n“That person you call the Author. Is she still watching?”\n“H-How do you know about the Auth-!”\n“You should be careful when you speak, Arte. I can still hear you if you mumble.”\nI thought he only knew about me.\nIs it because of my carelessness? Or because of the Author’s lack of ability?\nSiwoo knew more than I expected.\n…You could have at least given me telepathy.\nEven though I knew it was impossible because of the one ability setting, I couldn’t help but complain.\n“So? Is she watching?”\n“…I don’t know. I can’t contact her.”\n“You can’t contact her?”\n“Ever since my identity was discovered, she hasn’t said anything…”\nEven if I ran away now, he’d ask again tomorrow.\nI was certain of it looking into Siwoo’s eyes. Running away now would only postpone the inevitable.\nGiving up, I told Siwoo about my situation.\nI can’t contact her at all.\nI have no way to reach out to her.\nIt’s not Siwoo’s fault.\nHe knew but kept quiet because he trusted me.\nBut still, negative thoughts started creeping in.\nHe didn’t have to say anything.\nI wouldn’t have had to be so anxious.\nEven as I thought that, I couldn’t stand how disgusted I felt with myself for blaming others.\n“Well, alright. Whether she’s watching or not, what I want to say won’t change.”\nI thought we’d glossed over it.\nSiwoo was more persistent than I expected, and I was too naive.\nJust as self-loathing was about to overwhelm me.\nHe declared to me.\nNo, he declared to the Author.\n“My goal, Arte, is for you to be happy.”\n“…What?”\n“But I don’t think you’ll be happy with that Author around.”\n“…?!”\n“So I’m declaring this.”\nSiwoo said to me with a smile.\n“If you get in touch with that Author again, tell her this.”\n“…Tell her what?”\n“To be careful from now on.”\nArrogant.\nThat was my impression of Siwoo’s words.\nEven I’ve never seen the Author’s face.\nHow does he plan to do anything against someone whose face he doesn’t know?\nPerhaps my thoughts showed on my face because Siwoo pouted.\n“…What, Arte? Don’t you trust me?”\n“How could I possibly trust that?”\nSiwoo is strong. That’s true.\nBut Siwoo is still human in the end.\nThere’s no way he could defeat a god. That’s what I thought.\n“There’s no way you can win. No one in this world can defeat the Author. That’s the reality.”\n“Is that just your guess?”\n“It’s an indisputable fact.”\n“…I see.”\nSiwoo’s words were kind.\nBut impossible is impossible.\nHow could a mere human stand against a god?\n“It’s a bit disheartening when you put it that way.”\nAfter saying that, Siwoo suddenly embraced me.\n“W-What are you doing all of a sudden…!”\n“Let’s get some rest today and think about it again next time. It’s already way past bedtime. If you sleep late, you’ll be tardy again, right?”\nAs if refusing to discuss it further, Siwoo forcibly lifted me onto the bed.\nIn my moment of confusion, I found myself placed on the bed.\n“Good night, Arte. I hope you sleep well tonight.”\n“W-Wait a moment!”\nSiwoo didn’t speak to me anymore.\nHe probably wants me to get a good rest.\n“Haa…”\nUltimately, he said what he wanted to say and didn’t even pretend to listen to me.\nI reflected on Siwoo’s words.\nHe wants to help me. He wants to do something about the Author somehow.\nI could clearly see that’s what he was thinking.\nAs if determined to find a way no matter what, Siwoo refused to entertain the word “impossible.”\n“Hey, are you asleep…?”\nAs expected, there was no answer.\nIs he sleeping? I didn’t dare to check.\nSomeone else’s bed.\nMuch harder than my bed at home and unfamiliar.\nNormally, I should be unable to sleep and stay awake all night.\nBut for some reason, I felt a sense of reassurance.\nIn the darkness, Yu Siwoo lay nearby.\nHe, who completely trusted me and wanted to help me, was lying there.\n…It feels nice somehow.\nI buried my face in the pillow.\nAs expected, it didn’t suit me. There’s no way I could fall asleep.\nThat’s what I thought, but…\nSleep started to wash over me.\nA comforting sense of security, as if embracing me. A warm coziness.\nI felt like I might be able to get a good night’s sleep for the first time since coming to this world.\nThat vague feeling.\nBut it wasn’t wrong.\nFor the first time since coming to this world,\nI fell into a deep sleep.\nAuthor’s Notes\nI really tried very hard to do the serial publication, but it didn’t work out. I’m sorry, dear readers…\nIt seems I overexerted myself on the break I took because writing even one episode a day was too difficult.\nI’m a weakling, sigh.",

It’s a shallow provocation to get under her skin.\nHowever, she won’t fall for such provocations.\nIt might have been different if it were someone else…\nBut if it’s Yu Siwoo saying it…\nIf it’s the Protagonist of this world saying it, she couldn’t be happier.\n“How cool…”\n(…This one is admiring someone who just threatened her to be careful. Has she really gone mad?)\n“Why? I was planning to let him win eventually anyway.”\nThe others probably can’t imagine letting someone win because of their pride.\nThey might go crazy at such threatening remarks and try to manifest themselves somehow.\nBut she threw away her pride a long time ago.\n(You’re really something else.)\n(Well, isn’t that why she set this up? It’s entertaining, isn’t it?)\n“Right?! Right?!”\nExcited by the sudden praise, she eagerly sought agreement.\nIt’s fun. It’s unique.\nWhenever she hears such things, it feels like she’s the one being praised.\n“To think the Protagonist would care so much about the Reader!”\nIt seems their relationship was better than she expected.\nShe never thought Siwoo would suggest sleeping in the same room.\nIt’s disappointing that they’re not in the same bed, but time will surely take care of that.\n“Maybe I really am a genius…?!”\n(Here we go again.)\n(This is why you shouldn’t praise her like that.)\nThe girl lightly ignored the noisy chatter of those guys.\nThey’re just jealous.\n‘They’re envious and jealous that I’m the first.’\nThere was no need to listen carefully to what those guys were saying.\n‘After all, I’m a genius…!’\n“I was right not to speak to the Reader!”\n(Didn’t you say you didn’t speak because you feared getting scolded?)\n(That’s what I thought too. How long has it been since you were ridiculed as an immortal afraid of being scolded by a mortal…?)\nThey seem especially envious and jealous today.\nBut she can speak through results.\nShe proudly showed them the scene she was watching.\n“Can you still say I was wrong after seeing this!”\n(…)\nShe felt triumphant at the voices of those guys who fell silent like dumb spectators watching the Reader and Protagonist sleeping in the same room.\nWho’s responsible for the Reader’s progress in getting this far?\n‘That’s right, it’s thanks to me.’\nShe became anxious because the girl didn’t speak to her.\nThat’s why she couldn’t take her eyes off the Protagonist, and her obsession deepened.\nAnd who was it that found this most entertaining?\nIt was them.\n“If we had left them alone, wouldn’t it have taken ten years for those two to make progress?!”\n(I’m not sure about that, but it certainly would have been slower than now.)\n(Hmm, that’s true…)\nSome of them acknowledged her passionate speech.\nWell, that’s to be expected.\n‘When will those two start dating?’\n‘At this rate, won’t they die without ever dating?’\nTheir progress was so slow that such opinions were exchanged among those guys.\nOne even suggested forcibly changing the Reader’s settings, inserting one where she goes into heat at the Protagonist’s scent.\nTsk tsk. That’s no way to enjoy it.\n‘They really don’t know how to do it like me.’\nThey think there’s no problem doing such things because they manipulate the world as they please every day.\n“Naturally. Not by force but of their own accord. If you just set the stage, the story flows on its own.”\nThose guys, full of envy and jealousy towards a genius, couldn’t understand this.\nCan’t we just force them together?\n‘That was the prevailing opinion. Until I showed them!’\nIt’s perhaps natural that these guys haven’t been interested in romance until now.\nWhat fun is there in forced romance?\n“I really am a genius!”\n(Ah, I want to kill her. Why did it have to be that bitch…)\nShe decided to ignore the guys who started their envy and jealousy again.\nThere’s only one thing she was looking forward to now.\nWhat will become of the Reader and Siwoo in the future?\nThat was the only thing she was curious about.\n***\nSiwoo and I were lying in the classroom, leisurely resting.\nThe students who saw them looked envious, but well.\nIt’s not really worth paying attention to.\nIt’s not like their usual behavior was bad enough to be attacked by others.\nUnlike before, when public safety was so unstable that the academy set villain subjugation as a test for students, things have improved considerably.\nHow convenient it must be now that academy students are helping with public safety maintenance, which was originally done only by superhumans belonging to the Association.\nAccording to the Investigator, the Association is considering officially introducing an internship system.\nIt seems they found the students’ level to be quite good.\nThat’s not all.\nArachne has also started activities.\n“Somehow, those guys have been going out regularly these days.”\n“Now there are too few villains left…”\nThe resumption of activities by Arachne.\nThe academy students are superhuman forces, even if they lack experience.\nThe Association has always worked hard to maintain public safety.\nWith these three organizations burning with determination to eradicate villains, this result might be natural.\nAll the students have long since given up on villain subjugation and turned their attention to community service.\nThe academy is of course aware of this fact…\nBut it doesn’t seem like they have any intention of changing it.\nWhile villain subjugation is important, the academy’s purpose was to restore some of its fallen authority.\n“I received snacks on my way here today.”\n“I got chocolate. It feels like I’ve been receiving things more often lately… Do you know why this is happening?”\n“It’s because the perception of academy students has improved a lot these days.”\n“What?”\nUntil now, academy students didn’t receive much attention from citizens.\nIt’s the heroes who actually work, and the students who are still learning are in a period of growth.\nThere was less interest in students who weren’t exposed to them.\nBut in the past month or so, interest in students has greatly increased.\nThere’s only one reason. It’s because of the students’ active participation.\n“Running around catching villains, rebuilding broken shops, natural disaster recovery support to technology demonstrations at village performances. Exposure to positive aspects suddenly increased, right?”\n“…Ah.”\nThey caught villains to collect points.\nThis already improved citizens’ perception, but it didn’t end there.\nFixing broken shops around the academy also accumulates points.\nFor the students, it was just an action to get good grades, but it led to positive responses from citizens.\n“It was considered a one-time thing, but I heard the response was too good. They say they’ll do it periodically from now on.”\nDoes that mean there’s no benefit for the students?\nThat’s not the case either.\nIt was an action taken to gain their own points. In other words, they helped for selfish reasons, but in the end, they still helped.\nNaturally, the students received thanks from the people they helped, and it seems they felt a sense of achievement.\nRecently, the amount of voluntary practice by students has greatly increased.\nIt was impressive to see the investigator smiling with satisfaction.\nMaybe he seemed a bit angry, too.\nWondering why they hadn’t done such a good thing sooner.\n“It seems a positive virtuous cycle has been created.”\nSiwoo also smiled happily at that fact.\nThe fact that he, with his protagonist-like personality, can spend time so leisurely in the classroom, well.\nIt’s because the students are working hard.\nBecause no big incidents are happening.\nStudents help citizens to receive points.\nCitizens thank the students, give them this and that, and praise them.\nThe students feel good because they have never heard gratitude and praise like this, so they work harder.\nThe Association judges that the possibility of becoming villains will also decrease because they’ve had such good experiences.\nThe humiliation they would face if they became villains. And the cheers and rewards heroes receive.\nThey’ve experienced it all.\n“Oh, I see…”\n“… What’s with that unenthusiastic response?”\nI was slightly puzzled by Amelia and Dorothy’s reactions.\n“No, it’s just… Don’t you two seem to be sticking together a lot lately?”\n“That’s right. Just now, Arte started answering, and then Siwoo finished it…”\n“Is there something going on?”\nI couldn’t properly answer Dorothy’s innocent question.\nBecause there really was something.\n“…Uh, well. It’s nothing! Haha, right?”\n“Y-Yes. That’s right. It’s nothing.”\nSiwoo and I awkwardly laughed and tried to change the subject.\nAfter all, how could we say we’re living in the same house?\nThere was a reason, but we couldn’t say it.\nIf we did, it might seem even stranger.\n“…Well, let’s leave it at that.”\n“Leave it at what?”\n“Never mind, Dorothy. Let’s just leave them be. If they’re happy, well.”\n“…”\n“…”\nAt Amelia’s amused expression, Siwoo and I realized.\nWe don’t know how she found out, but she already knew.\nThat Siwoo and I are living together.\nShe probably just asked now to confirm.\n“…Be careful with contraception, okay?”\n“We haven’t done anything!”\nAre you in your right mind, Amelia?!\nAuthor’s Notes\nAs the writer continues to win, she becomes very proud and dismisses the others as jealous and envious people.\nI need to slap her on the cheek…",

      "content": "“Sigh… What were they thinking…”\nAfter spending dozens of minutes blushing and making excuses for Amelia’s ridiculous misunderstanding, I finally stopped Amelia and Dorothy from looking at Siwoo and me with suspicious eyes.\n…Though it felt more like they were letting it slide rather than truly understanding.\nThey did understand properly, right?\n“Contraception? There’s no way Siwoo would do such a thing. Right?”\n“…Yeah, well. That’s right.”\n“Even as a joke, that’s going too far.”\nSee?\nSiwoo isn’t that kind of shameless person.\nHow can these so-called heroines know so little about the protagonist?\nI suppressed the urge to confront Amelia out of annoyance. If I did so now, it might lead to another strange misunderstanding.\n…Besides, well.\nIt’s not like I have anything to say, really.\nHow could I tell them that I actually become emotionally unstable and dangerous when Siwoo isn’t around and that we’re living together to help with that?\n“He just wanted to help me, that’s all.”\nIt’s not like I trusted Siwoo this much from the beginning.\nEven if he is the protagonist, he’s still a young man in his prime.\nWhen I first moved in with Siwoo at his house, my guard was as high as a stray cat on the street.\nHe was helping, but he might use that as an excuse to fulfill his desires, right?\nI understood well enough that my body was attractive.\nSo, I remained cautious while I watched Siwoo, knowing I needed his warmth.\nHowever, I found him to be harmless.\nA month. We lived together for almost a month, and Siwoo remained kind to me.\nHe never looked at me with lustful eyes.\nAt least when I was a man, it would have been impossible. I could be certain of that.\nI clung to him so much that even I thought it might be annoying or uncomfortable for him.\n“I trust him, so don’t worry!”\n“…Yeah, I’m glad.”\nSiwoo… well, how should I put it?\nHe seemed to meet the conditions of a protagonist well.\nThe Author suddenly said she couldn’t modify Siwoo anymore. That means, conversely, that she could change him before.\nBeing the Author, I wonder if she inserted settings like the protagonist being dense about romance, like in light novels.\nNo matter how I thought about it, there was no other explanation.\nI wouldn’t have been able to endure if it were me.\nA beautiful girl like this living in the same house, treating me as special, saying she can’t be without me.\nNo matter how I thought about it, for nothing to happen under these conditions must be because of that.\nOnce, I even fell into self-loathing, wondering if I lacked charm when I saw Siwoo’s nonchalant attitude.\nDespite being such an attractive girl, there’s no reaction. It gives me an inexplicable sense of defeat.\nMoreover, I remembered something I seemed to have seen on the internet before falling into this world.\nWhat was it again? Guys who can’t date in the real world won’t be able to date even if they become handsome or pretty when they go to another world. Something like that?\nWas I really someone who couldn’t experience romance even after coming to this world, just as those words said?\nI felt a little sad thinking about that.\n…But then I realized I didn’t need to be sad about such things.\nIt’s impossible to date anyone here anyway, right?\nEveryone is just a puppet, so what’s the point.\n“…Ah, is there anything you’d like for dinner today?”\n“I can cook, you know.”\n“No, no.”\n“Leave it to me!”\nI decided to make  steak today based on Siwoo’s suggestion.\n…Hmm, what do we have in the fridge?\nWe’re running low on onions and pepper. I should restock those while buying  meat.\nRecalling the current ingredients in Siwoo’s fridge, I headed towards the market.\nOf course, with Siwoo.\n“I should at least do this much. I don’t want to be a burden.”\n“I keep telling you it’s fine… Isn’t it tiring?”\n“I often cook for myself anyway, so it’s fine. How many times have we had this conversation?”\nI let out a small sigh.\nSiwoo is kind, but it’s problematic that he tries not to make me do anything.\nThat can’t be.\nIt’s not right to suddenly live in someone else’s house and do nothing.\nBefore talking about manners, I can’t stand how uncomfortable it makes me feel.\nBased on my judgment that I’d feel less uncomfortable if I did something, I decided to take charge of cooking while staying at Siwoo’s house.\nSiwoo seemed reluctant about that too.\nIt’s not like we’re short on money, and it was quite enjoyable to actually make dishes that I had only thought about making before.\nIt was also quite pleasant to have someone else eat the food I made.\n“Oh my, you’re here again today.”\n“Hello. I came to look at some  meat… This looks delicious. I’ll take this, please.”\n“Of course, dear customer. You have a good eye.”\nI see the Academy’s reputation has indeed improved.\nI could see nearby customers glancing at us, even though we visit almost every day.\nIn the past, they would have just thought, “Oh, they’re students,” and moved on.\nRecently, the number of people whispering about us has increased.\n“…It’s burdensome.”\n“Is it? I think it would be fine to enjoy it a bit more.”\n“We’re just doing what we’re supposed to do.”\n“Oh.”\nAs expected, is this because he’s the protagonist?\nI always found it amazing to see this side of Siwoo.\nI wouldn’t have believed it if someone else had said such a cliché thing.\nBut I could because Siwoo said it.\nUnlike others, he speaks from his heart.\n“That was kind of cool?”\nHmm, hmm.\nAs I nodded to myself, the lady who prepared the  meat approached us.\n“Here you go. Take it.”\n“…Pardon? What about the payment?”\n“How could I take money from students? Quickly now. My arms are getting tired.”\n…You didn’t take money last time either.\nBesides, this is clearly not the  meat I asked for earlier.\nOf course, the meat I chose looked delicious too, but…\nThis looks much more expensive no matter how you look at it.\nIt seems the size has increased too.\n“Ma’am, but this…”\n“Take it quickly. Students need to eat well.”\n“We’re not people who deserve this…”\n“No, it’s fine to accept it. I’m so grateful thanks to you students.”\nThe lady said with a bright smile.\n“I was fine, but the surroundings were damaged and in chaos, and you students helped, right? Quickly, take it. I told you my arms are tired?”\n“…”\nCome to think of it, this shopping district was one of the places damaged on the day of the closing ceremony.\nI think I heard that’s why students mainly get points here.\nIt’s close by, and there was a lot to restore.\nIt seems the students have moved to other places now that the restoration is almost complete.\nIt felt strange.\nThe shopping district was destroyed due to the Author’s setting, and now it’s being restored because of another.\nAs I stood there for a while, just looking, the lady said playfully.\n“Take it quickly. You should feed your boyfriend something delicious.”\n“…It’s not like that.”\n“Oh, come on. Don’t be silly. You come here together every day. Eat well and protect us citizens. That’s enough for us.”\nBoyfriend? What nonsense.\nSiwoo is meant to end up with a heroine.\nRight now, he’s living with me like this to help me, but someday, when I can manage without Siwoo…\nWhen that happens, it’ll be Amelia. Or Dorothy.\nOr maybe he’ll end up with a new heroine that appears someday.\nOr perhaps, like a true protagonist, he’ll marry all of them.\n“…”\nUltimately, I took the  meat and picked up a few missing ingredients from other stores.\nOnce again, I couldn’t pay due to the owner’s insistence.\nOn the way back to Siwoo’s house.\nI suddenly imagined what would happen if the Author really ceased to exist in this world.\nIf I couldn’t return to my original world.\nAnother woman would smile happily next to Siwoo, and I would watch as usual.\n…Somehow, it feels unpleasant.\n***\n“Then, please go ahead and take a bath. I’ll prepare the meal.”\n“Will you be alright?”\n“Ha, haha… Of course. I can manage that much somehow.”\nThat’s a lie.\nAfter living together for almost a month, Siwoo has come to know Arte better.\nThat’s just bravado. She’ll surely have breathing difficulties after just ten minutes.\nBut even knowing that, there’s nothing else he can do.\nIt’s not like he can enter the bathroom with her.\nIn the end, Siwoo had no choice but to nod.\n“I’ll be quick.”\n“Take your time, it’s fine.”\nLeaving the kitchen where the smell of grilling  meat was starting to waft, Siwoo entered the bathroom and immediately banged his head against the wall.\n“Endure it, endure… You have to endure, Yu Siwoo…”\nOver the past month, Siwoo has been feeling his sanity gradually wearing away.\nIt’s not like he’s been training too much. He’s getting enough rest.\nHe could intuitively tell how far to go to finish training efficiently.\nHe hasn’t been staying up late either.\nSince Arte moved in, the surrounding environment may have become too good.\nHe’s been sleeping well.\nThere’s only one reason why Siwoo’s sanity is wearing away.\n“Isn’t she too defenseless…”\nIt’s because of the desires that arise from spending all day with Arte.\nWhat would happen if Arte found out he was looking at her with such eyes when he agreed to help her?\nWould she be disappointed? Disgusted?\n…Maybe she’d be so shocked that she’d suffer from breathing difficulties even with him nearby. That can’t happen.\nIt was easier to endure when Arte was watching from afar.\nThe stimulation wasn’t strong enough to make a judgment that she might be watching from behind the curtain.\nBut now? She’s too defenseless.\nAt first, she seemed a bit wary, but she completely let her guard down after just a few days.\nIs she a stray cat abandoned by humans? Isn’t her guard dropping too easily?\nSiwoo started cooling his head with the coldest water possible to clear his mind.\nHe couldn’t take a long shower either.\nArte needs him to be nearby.\nIf only her symptoms would improve or if she would be a little more cautious.\nSiwoo let out a sigh.",

      "content": "As soon as Siwoo finished showering, he hurriedly changed clothes and looked at the clock.\nAbout ten minutes had passed.\nWorried that Arte might be in danger, he rushed to the kitchen.\n“You’re back already? I’m not done preparing yet.”\n“I finished quickly just in case….”\n“I told you not to worry and take your time…”\nFortunately, Arte seemed fine, probably because he arrived early, so Siwoo let out a sigh of relief.\nThis was already an improvement.\nRight after they started living together, it was really serious.\n“What’s wrong? Why are you suddenly quiet?”\n“No, I was just thinking how much you’ve improved. On the first day, it was really bad, but now you’re fine with being apart for about ten minutes. Remember that?”\n“… Don’t talk about it!”\n“You couldn’t even wait for me to shower and had to periodically knock on the door to tell you I was here, right?”\n“Aaaaargh! I said don’t talk about it!”\nThump, thump.\nUnable to overcome her embarrassment, Arte hit his back with her magic-infused hand.\n…That really hurts.\nAs he rubbed his sore back, he saw Arte’s face flushed red. He glared at him as if telling him not to speak.\n…She really has improved a lot.\nBack then, she was so conscious of his every move.\nIt was pitiful how she looked at him as if begging not to be abandoned.\nNow she’s comfortable enough to counterattack when he teases her.\n‘But still, she gets anxious when I’m away. That hasn’t changed.’\nAs evidence, though she’s not showing it…\nHer voice trembled slightly at first. Her eyes wavered.\nHer breathing started to quicken.\nFortunately, he came out at the right time; if he had been a little later, Arte would have had a hard time.\nHe couldn’t let her get into that state after he had sworn to help her.\n“…Arte. The meat is going to burn.”\n“Ah?! I-I’ll get you later!”\n‘Maybe I teased her too much.’\nAs Arte kept hitting his back, he felt like his back wouldn’t survive, so he mentioned the steak she was cooking.\nWatching Arte hurriedly flip the meat after throwing a warning at him, his mood sank.\nThis was her original personality.\nHe thought the suspicious and cold Arte of Arachne was her true self, but…\nIn reality, her personality wasn’t any different from ordinary people.\nShe wasn’t as cruel as people thought.\n“…I can’t forgive this.”\nNo matter how he thinks about it, he couldn’t forgive it.\nBoth the fact that Arte had to do such things and that she’s suffering mentally.\nIt’s all because of that ‘Author’, isn’t it?\nHe’s asked Arte several times but never got a positive answer.\nShe says she’s grateful for his words, but there’s no way he can win. She only knows the Author’s voice. She’s never met her directly and can’t meet her. If she gets serious, the world might really end, no joke.\nShe held back her words while saying such things.\nThat’s why he still didn’t know how to help her.\nThere’s only one way.\nTo raise Arte’s trust in him so she feels like telling him about the Author.\nThat’s why he can’t break Arte’s trust.\nBecause he needs her trust to help her.\n‘…But it’s already been over a month since I started living with Arte.’\nIsn’t this long enough to have endured?\nSiwoo absent-mindedly stared at Arte’s back as she cooked.\nHer snow-white nape that he caught a glimpse of… Ah, damn.\n“The food is rea– Huh? What’s wrong?”\n“No, my eyes are just a bit tired.”\n“…We have blueberries. Want me to give you some?”\n“Yeah. Please.”\nThis is bad.\nHe needs to gain Arte’s trust.\nHe’s trying his best not to look at her with sexual intent.\nBut his gaze keeps turning towards her with it.\nShe looks soft. She probably smells nice.\n…It would feel good to hug her.\nSuch thoughts overturned his mind, and he tried several times to regain his senses.\nSiwoo thought that it was becoming harder to endure.\nIf he didn’t know anything, it might be easier to endure.\nBut as it happens, Arte and he have frequent physical contact, at least for him.\nA guy who’s never dated has had continuous physical contact with Arte.\n… It’s embarrassing to think about, but he even hid in her locker once.\nOn the day he killed the villain, she hugged him from behind to comfort him.\nHe piggybacked her and gave her a lap pillow.\nHe’s even carried her in a swimsuit.\nIt’s rather easy to imagine because he’s had these various experiences.\nThanks to these unnecessarily good sensations, the memories of those days come back vividly.\nSurely it would feel good to hug her. She must be soft.\nShe must smell nice, right? Her shampoo smelled good—a bit different from what he used.\n“Here, have some blueberries.”\n“Ah, thanks.”\nAs he put the blueberries Arte brought him in his mouth, he thought this couldn’t go on.\nThe dolphin shorts and loose oversized top she wears say they’re comfortable.\nOf course, it might be comfortable for Arte, but it was an unbearably uncomfortable sight for him.\n“…Mmm, it is uncomfortable after all.”\nArte looked back nonchalantly, as if bothered, and started tying up her hair.\n“Then, please wait a bit! It’ll be done soon!”\n“…Okay. Got it.”\n‘This is driving me crazy.’\nWhat’s driving him crazy is how perfectly it fits his taste.\nThe loose top and dolphin shorts.\nShe raises her arms to tie her hair, revealing her armpit. The tied hair makes her snow-white nape visible.\nHer waist, which looks smooth to the touch, also came into view.\nIt’s usually fine, but occasionally, when she shows a bit of skin like this, it drives him crazy.\nIt’s not good for his eyes.\nUntil now, he’s tried to pretend not to notice, but should he start talking about it soon?\n“…Arte.”\n“Yes?”\n“Can you maybe… Never mind.”\nHe was determined to say it today. With that resolve, he called out, but it crumbled instantly.\n‘Can you maybe wear your leotard at home.’\nThere’s no way he could say such a thing.\nHe decided to keep the words he was about to say to himself.\nHe could guess why Arte wears a leotard.\nTo make combat easier, she needs to use the thread on her body, so she wears clothes with as much surface area as possible.\nThe uniform is needed so it can’t be touched, so he could guess that she somehow increased her sustained combat power with gloves, stockings, and underwear.\nBut there’s no way he could say that he knows about such things.\nCome to think of it, the leotard is Arte’s underwear.\nHe confirmed it when he entered her locker before. There’s nothing but the leotard under her uniform.\nBut if he, a man, say such things to Arte?\nArte, you wear different underwear at home…\n‘How could I say that?’\nAre you crazy, Yu Siwoo? She might try to kill him on the spot, let alone slap him.\nIt’s not even polite.\nSiwoo decided to bury it in his heart.\nArte wears the most comfortable clothes at home. That’s enough.\nHe decided not to dig deeper.\n“?”\n“It’s nothing. Let’s eat quickly… Mm, it’s delicious as always.”\n“Right? I’m confident in my steak!”\nAs Siwoo tasted Arte’s steak, which he had become familiar with after eating it several times, he thought.\nHe felt like his gaze towards Arte was becoming increasingly lecherous recently.\nHe had been suppressing it somehow, but it was getting harder.\nEven then, he tried his best to suppress his gaze towards Arte.\n“Haah…”\nHe really, really didn’t want to try it, but Siwoo decided to use his last resort.\nWouldn’t Amelia have some useful opinions?\nSuspicions have increased recently anyway. There’s no point in hiding it anymore.\nLooking at Arte’s figure, Siwoo decided to consult with Amelia tomorrow.\n***\n“I thought you two were sticking together too often lately.”\n“Well…”\n“Say less… So that’s what it was.”\nMuttering like that, Amelia started circling around him.\n“I don’t have time, Amelia. I told her I was going to the bathroom and came to you. What should I do in this situation?”\n“…You’re in a dangerous condition too, huh?”\nHe ignored Amelia’s incomprehensible mutterings as she looked at him.\nHe couldn’t have this kind of consultation with other female students.\nAt times like this, he felt fortunate that Amelia was involved in the incident related to Arte.\nIf he told this to Dorothy or other female students, they would either treat me as a pervert or waste time chattering excitedly.\nWith Amelia, there’s no worry. She’s not the type to do such things.\nSure enough, Amelia put aside all trivial talk and said.\n“Indeed. It must be quite troublesome not to be able to be apart for more than 10 minutes in the same house. Someone like Arte would be enough to trouble you.”\n“Don’t you have any good ideas?”\n“Do I look like some kind of thought repository to you? Do you think I can answer everything you ask?”\nAmelia looked at him as if she couldn’t believe it.\n…Well. It’s not like Amelia is perfect either.\nAlthough she was the only person he could ask about this, thinking she might have a good solution was just his assumption.\nOnly then did he realize the error he had made.\n“It’s not like there’s no method…”\n“Th-There is?!”\n“…Well. I’m not sure if it will work or not. But I think it’s worth trying. Want to give it a shot?”\n“Tell me. Right now.”\nAs he was hanging my head in desperation, he heard something hopeful.\nEven if it’s not certain, he’ll do it if it’s worth trying.\nHe had to have some time to himself somehow.\nHe couldn’t endure any longer.\n“…How about this?”\nAmelia’s explanation continued.\nAnd after hearing all of her explanation, he nodded.\n‘I’m not sure if it will work, but if it’s possible, I have to try.’\n“The important thing is sincerity. Got it?”\n“I got it. Thanks.”\n“It’s nothing.”\n“…Oh no. It’s already this late. Sorry, Amelia. I’ll see you later!”\nSuddenly looking at the time, he found that over five minutes had passed.\nIt was time to return to Arte.\nSiwoo hurriedly said goodbye to Amelia and started heading back towards where Arte was.\n“… What’s with him, acting like a henpecked husband? Anyone who sees this would think they’re already married.”\nBecause of this, Siwoo couldn’t hear Amelia’s muttering.",

      "content": "Chapter 101\n__________________________________\n“What are you doing?”\n“Arte? Um… It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.”\n…Suspicious.\nI felt conflicted as I watched Siwoo hurriedly avoiding my gaze and hiding something.\nCome on, I’m not a parent nagging about studying or anything.\nRecently, Siwoo has been hiding something from me.\nAnd because of that, he has been like this. He’s been spending more time away from me to use his spare time.\nHe used to only leave for a moment when absolutely necessary.\nLately, he’s been leaving his seat more often without properly explaining.\n“What have you been doing lately? You usually don’t use the internet much.”\n“Umm, well…”\n“And you rarely looked at your phone before, but now you’re constantly checking it.”\nAt first, I felt a bit hurt and slightly anxious.\nWorried that if he continues to be lazy like this, he might be unable to overcome the Author’s trials.\nSo, I pointed out Siwoo’s recent lazy behavior to complain a little.\nHis training time has decreased, and he’s been spending more time checking his phone and the internet in between.\nSiwoo isn’t the type to become this lazy.\n…But as I said it, something seemed suspicious.\nThere’s no way Siwoo would change like this suddenly.\nIt’s Siwoo we’re talking about, not someone else. The protagonist of the world. The person who will save the world from crisis.\nSomeone like that wouldn’t suddenly become lazy.\nI trusted Siwoo. There was no reason not to trust him.\nSurely there must be some reason.\n…And seeing Siwoo break into a cold sweat at my questioning, I was certain.\nThere’s something.\n“…A girl?”\nWhat reason could there be for Siwoo to suddenly become lazy?\nI thought hard and suddenly voiced the idea that came to mind.\nSiwoo must have heard it clearly. He said he could even listen to my conversations with the Author.\nIf he could hear it when his abilities were weak, almost in their initial state, there’s no way he couldn’t hear now.\nSiwoo slightly avoided my eyes as if confirming my thoughts, looking a bit troubled.\nYes, a girl. So it was a girl.\nWas that why he suddenly searched the internet and looked at his phone often?\nWas he spending time looking for date spots and whispering sweet nothings to his lover?\n“…Who is it?”\n“Ah, well, that’s…”\n“Who is it?”\nAmelia? Dorothy?\nHave they already started dating?\nI didn’t think I saw any signs of that.\nMaybe it’s because we’ve been together for over a month. I’ve already grasped Siwoo’s surrounding relationships quite well.\nFrom my judgment, I didn’t think Amelia or Dorothy had that kind of relationship with Siwoo.\n“I-It’s not a girl or anything. Really.”\n“Then why are you stuttering?”\n“…”\n“It’s probably not Amelia. Not Dorothy either.”\nThose two didn’t show any signs.\nThen it must be another girl.\nAs far as I know, there are only two determined heroines currently. Just those two.\nBut if it’s not those two, who is this girl Siwoo is so concerned about?\n“Ahaha. Why are you so flustered? I’m not trying to interrogate you.”\nI decided to finish my thoughts and reassure Siwoo.\nBut even as I smiled at Siwoo, my thoughts lingered elsewhere.\n…It’s not a heroine.\nAfter considering all the numerous possibilities, I couldn’t help but think that.\nI knew that Siwoo and those two had been having some conversations recently, but I let it pass as it was their private life.\nBut there’s one scene I clearly remember.\nSiwoo, Amelia, and Dorothy talked while looking at something on their phones.\nIf it was one of those two, such a scene wouldn’t have occurred.\n…Could it be another puppet, not a heroine?\nSince when? Since when did she start flirting with Siwoo?\nI’ve been watching him constantly around Siwoo.\nI haven’t been doing any Arachne activities. No, I couldn’t.\nHow could I do Arachne activities when I can’t leave Siwoo’s side?\nMost of the current Arachne activities are the work of Spira and Lyra.\n“If you don’t want to discuss it, that’s okay.”\n“Umm, well. Actually, it’s not much…”\nI wonder how those guys are doing these days.\nI hadn’t visited home for over a month, so I couldn’t grasp how they were doing.\nI should ask our investigator next time.\nHe was controlling those guys like a nanny.\nSpira, who gets cocky if left alone for a bit, and Lyra, who pretends not to but easily gets swept up by Spira.\nI know it’s hard controlling those guys, but…\nIt seems like I have one more thing I need to ask.\n“…I’ll go do some laundry for a bit. I’ll return soon, so you don’t need to follow me.”\n“Arte? Wait, that’s…”\nI hurriedly left the place carrying a laundry basket filled with clothes.\nSince Siwoo and I started living in the same house, I’ve been taking care of most of the housework, but…\nLaundry was an exception.\nBecause things like underwear would be embarrassing for others to see, we decided to put our laundry in our own baskets and do it ourselves.\nThis is my first time living with someone, so I’m not sure, but it probably wouldn’t be much different even if we were the same gender.\nThat’s why saying I was going to do laundry was the best excuse to leave my spot.\nIt was even better because when I quickly glanced, an appropriate amount of laundry piled up.\n…Good. This distance should be enough.\nEven if it’s Siwoo, there’s no way he could hear our conversation from this far.\nIf he could hear from this distance, I’d believe his ability was cat ears rather than intuition.\nConvinced of this, I clapped my hands to call the investigator.\n“…Did you call for me?”\n“Sorry to bother you while you’re busy, but I need you to do something.”\n“Please, go ahead.”\nThe investigator has really changed a lot.\nThe person who initially tried to put me in jail has now become a subordinate doing the same work as me.\nAlong with Lyra, who was a heroine candidate, he’s probably the person whose life has been turned upside down the most because of the Author.\nIndeed, this world…\nNo, no. Now wasn’t the time to indulge in such gloomy thoughts.\nThere was information I wanted to know as soon as possible, so I erased the thoughts in my head and spoke to her.\n“Can you investigate Siwoo’s past?”\n“…His past, you say?”\n“Yes. As quickly as possible.”\nWhy on earth am I asking for this? An expression of such doubt briefly crossed Ha-Yul’s face.\nBut he immediately stiffened his face as if realizing his mistake and nodded.\n“Please focus on his relationships.”\nRight after meeting Siwoo, I spent most of my time in this world monitoring him.\nYes, from morning to night. Even before I fell into dependence on him.\nThat’s why I could be certain.\nThere was no time for Siwoo to suddenly have a girl. None at all.\nIf there had been, I would have noticed immediately.\nThere was only one answer.\n…There’s a possibility that something happened before he entered the academy.\n“Understood.”\n“Please do it as quickly as possible.”\nI can’t say for certain, but as far as I know, Siwoo doesn’t have a family.\nA house is quite spacious for living alone.\nBut a family that hasn’t shown their face even once in over half a year of watching.\nThat’s why I thought he didn’t have a family.\nDid his family have some kind of accident? Or did the Author remove them before she became unable to manipulate Siwoo’s settings?\nOr maybe they’re on a long-term business trip on the other side.\nWell, I wasn’t particularly interested in Siwoo’s family circumstances.\nI was only interested in one thing.\n“If something unnecessary has attached itself…”\nI don’t care what kind of puppet it is. I’ll have to remove it.\n“By the way, what’s that?”\n“Huh?”\n“What you’re holding in your hand.”\n“…Ah, this.”\nAt Ha-Yul’s words, I remembered what excuse I had used to slip away.\nI said I would do my laundry.\n“It’s nothing. Just…”\n“Hmm, I’m not sure if I should say this, but… holding someone else’s laundry doesn’t look very good.”\n“What?”\nWhat did he say?\nAt his words, I checked the contents of the laundry basket I had grabbed hastily.\n…Strange. Why does it look so big?\n“Well, if it’s as Siwoo predicted last time, it’s not bad to secure it early…”\n“Uh, uwaah?!”\nStartled, I threw the laundry basket, and the piled-up laundry instantly scattered on the floor.\nG-Goodness!\nI thought it was mine.\nI regretted throwing the laundry as soon as I did it, startled by the sudden situation.\nThe dust on the floor stuck to the clothes, making them much dirtier.\nTo dirty someone else’s clothes like this.\nJust as I was about to pick them up, feeling bad for causing trouble, a voice came beside me.\n“Oh dear. Let me help…”\n“It’s okay, you can go ahead.”\n“No, but…”\n“It’s fine.”\n“…I understand.”\n***\n“…That’s my laundry basket.”\nSiwoo thought as he watched Arte hurriedly leave.\nHe had briefly considered whether to say this or not.\nAnd he had decided to say it because the risk of not saying it was too great.\nBut Arte suddenly left her seat, so he couldn’t tell her in the end.\nHer sudden excuse of doing laundry and leaving looked like she urgently wanted to do something, so he couldn’t stop her.\nHe couldn’t even say that the basket she took was his.\nShe’ll probably come back when she realizes she took the wrong one after doing what she wanted to do.\nSiwoo decided to wait for her patiently.",

      "content": "Chapter 102\n_______________________________\n“…Why did I do that?”\nI unconsciously rejected Ha-Yul’s offer to help.\nWhy did I reject it?\nSurely, there was nothing wrong with his offer to help.\nIt would have ended quickly if I had gratefully accepted his help, even if I felt a little sorry.\nI wore a troubled expression at the clothes scattered on the floor.\nI had already rejected his kindness.\nLooking at the amount of scattered clothes, there were more than I thought.\nI suppose it’s because Siwoo changes his clothes often, as he sweats daily.\n“Hmm, this is strange…”\nI sighed and started putting the scattered clothes into the basket individually.\nWhile pondering why on earth I had acted that way.\nI did it reflexively, but I really couldn’t understand why.\nAfter thinking while picking up the clothes, I finally realized why I hadn’t let Ha-yul help.\n“…That was dangerous.”\nWas I reflexively protecting Siwoo from danger to this extent?\nMy shoulders rose with unwarranted pride.\n“Even if Ha-Yul is a member of Arachne, there’s no guarantee he’s absolutely on our side. It was a good decision.”\nHa-Yul is an ally.\nA position closely connected to the Association as a former investigator.\nA veteran who has been through numerous real battles.\nOn top of that, it is a practically invincible ability, even if it can’t be maintained long.\nHe’s undoubtedly the strongest among the Arachne members.\nYes, the best in Arachne.\nEven including me.\n“If he had been given a traitor setting and did something to Siwoo’s clothes… Phew, that’s a relief.”\n[What nonsense is that… Hup!]\n“?”\nWhat was that?\nI thought I heard something just now.\nIt must be my imagination.\n***\nThe girl hurriedly covered her mouth and held her breath.\nThe sound was already blocked, so the Reader probably couldn’t hear her, but she couldn’t bear it otherwise.\nThe subject of the girl’s observation looked around for a while at the sudden sound, then started picking up the clothes again, one by one.\n“Whew… That was close…”\n(I can’t believe she didn’t notice.)\n“W-What did you say?!”\n(If only she had noticed, we could have seen her crying… What a shame…)\n“I wouldn’t cry!”\nThe girl exclaimed that, but she wasn’t sure if she wouldn’t cry.\nThe girl had made a resolution.\nWhen the Protagonist and the Reader started to confirm their feelings for each other, she would speak to her again then.\nBut the girl’s short patience was shattered by the past month’s experiences.\nSurely, the girl’s patience could be considered excellent among transcendents.\nEspecially compared to those who would just forcibly connect them rather than wait frustratingly.\nTo be honest, the girl was starting to want to talk with the Reader.\nShe wanted to chat about various things. Not being able to speak was quite painful.\nYet, the reason the girl didn’t speak to her was simple.\nShe didn’t want to waste the past month.\nIf she spoke now, everything built up until now would crumble.\nBut it was hard to endure. At this rate, it seemed like she might give up and speak first.\nShe connected the sound briefly to feel that moment again, but her voice accidentally leaked out at the Reader’s monologue.\nShe almost ruined over a month of waiting in vain.\n“Ah, this is so frustrating! How can we make the reaction happen faster?!”\n(I thought you said you liked that kind of thing?)\n“Even that has its limits! After waiting for a month, huh? Shouldn’t they be all over each other by now?!”\nThe plan was surely perfect.\nRight after realizing that the Reader was contradictorily afraid yet dependent on her.\nShe voluntarily kept her mouth shut, which she had closed for fear of being scolded.\nBecause the progress between the Protagonist and the Reader suddenly accelerated.\nSo, just a little more.\nShe endured for a month, thinking that if she stayed quiet just a little longer, they would make more progress.\nOf course, a month might not be considered a long time, but she thought they would progress quickly.\n“Why, why has it turned out like this…”\nThe girl was certain.\nThat the Reader’s body was her finest masterpiece.\nShe was confident that if this body were in a normal modern society, not this kind of world, it would instantly become famous just for its face.\nThe reason for making it that way… Well, there wasn’t any particular deep meaning.\nPart of her body had to be mixed in, and it would be unpleasant if it were ugly.\nThere’s a saying that what looks good tastes good too, right?\n“With a body like that, behaving like that with such a body…!”\nWhy isn’t the Protagonist reacting?!\nIs he impotent?\nNo, that can’t be. Surely he should be fine? It’s impossible according to his settings, right?\n“Why doesn’t he pounce? Why doesn’t he pounce, I say!”\n(This is starting to look unsightly.)\n“Be quiet! Do you understand how I feel?!”\n(I don’t want to understand your feelings.)\nSurprisingly, nothing happened for a month.\nThey certainly got closer, unlike the feeling of being friends before living together.\nIt was visible that Siwoo was constantly aware of Arte’s unintentional seduction.\nIt seemed he was somehow managing his gaze so Arte wouldn’t notice.\n…But still, the progress is too slow.\nIt hurt her pride.\nIt felt like being told that the body she created wasn’t pretty.\n“Fine, let’s say even the Protagonist is like that… The Reader is the worst!”\nLet’s concede and say even the Protagonist could be like that.\nThe most annoying one is the Reader.\n“That reaction is really too much!”\nHonestly, she felt wronged.\nWhat did I do?\nShe didn’t understand why the Reader was so wary of her in the first place.\nHas she ever done anything bad to her?\nShe might have scolded the Reader, but she hasn’t ever tormented her.\n“A setting where a former investigator who went around killing villains suddenly becomes a traitor! Would I do such a thing…?”\nOh.\nThat sounds like it could be interesting.\nAn investigator who realizes that killing people is wrong and turns back to the side of justice.\nSingle-handedly opposing the Association and secret organization that manipulate superhuman society…?\nShould she try it?\n(You’re not thinking of something weird again, are you?)\n“…Ha! N-No, I wasn’t thinking anything!”\n(This girl was about to cause trouble again, wasn’t she?)\nAhem, ahem.\nIt’s a setting that makes her mouth water a bit, but she put it aside for now.\nThe Reader surely has feelings for Siwoo too. It can’t be otherwise.\nIsn’t it natural for love to blossom when they’re sticking together like that?\n“And yet, to have such a reaction…”\nShe tried not to intervene at all.\nBut she felt that at this rate, it might take years for them to make progress.\nThe Reader’s mental state has improved a bit recently, but…\n“Hehehe, I guess I have no choice at this point.”\nShe’ll have to forcibly create an event.\nAfter all, an incident is necessary to sprout emotions.\nThe Reader was still picking up clothes,\nNot knowing what was about to happen.\n***\n“…Phew. I guess I’m almost done.”\nI sighed while picking up the clothes.\nFinally, it’s over.\nLooking at the clock, almost ten minutes had passed.\nI should hurry back before another problem occurs.\nThinking that, I hurriedly headed towards the washing machine.\nAt that moment, thud.\nWith the sensation of something catching my foot, my body started to lean forward.\n“Ah, aah?!”\nCrash, bang.\nThe contents of the basket I was holding in both hands spilled out, and my body, with no way to support itself, fell onto the contents.\nAh, damn it.\nI have to pick them up again.\nMy mood sank. Things aren’t going well today.\n“I’m sure there was nothing here…”\nThere shouldn’t have been anything in this area that could catch my foot.\nI looked around to see what had caught my foot, but I couldn’t see anything.\n…Was it my imagination?\n“Sigh, I have to pick them up again…”\nHow am I going to explain this?\nI felt guilty seeing the white clothes covered in dirt and stained.\nThose kinds of stains don’t come out easily, so I’ll have to figure out how to fix them somehow.\nI picked up the clothes again, trying to soothe my deeply sunken mood.\nAfter putting the picked-up clothes into the washing machine,\nOnly then did I realize something was strange.\n“Huh?”\nFeeling the strangeness, I looked at the clock.\nThe clock was still busily moving, showing the time.\nThe time that had already passed 15 minutes since I separated from Siwoo.\n“Hmm…?”\nWhen I was separated from Siwoo, my breathing would naturally start to become unstable after ten minutes.\nFor the time to suddenly increase by more than half doesn’t make sense.\nI don’t think my body suddenly got better.\nEven yesterday, my hand trembled once.\nThen what’s different?\nAmong things related to Siwoo, the reason I can endure longer than before is…\nAt that moment.\nSuddenly, the basket in my hand caught my eye.\nCome to think of it, when I fell, something felt warm.\n“…”\nGulp.\nShould I do this?\nIs it really okay to do this?\nI don’t even know if this is right or not.\nNo, but constantly clinging to him until now might have been more of a nuisance.\nCompared to that, this much is…\n“Arte! Arte, where did you go?! Are you okay?!”\n“Eek?!”\n“There you are! Arte, are you alright?!”\n“Y-Yes… I’m fine.”\n“Thank goodness… Let’s go back to the room for now.”\n“Ah, no. Before that, I need to…”\n“Oh, that. I meant to tell you but forgot. Those are my clothes, so it’s fine to do it later.”\n“No, it’s just…”\n“Let’s go to the room first.”\nWait a moment…\nEven though I tried to say something, Siwoo was busy ushering me into the room.\nSo, I ended up holding onto something.\nOne of Siwoo’s clothes.",

      "content": "Chapter 103\n_____________________\n“…”\nIs this right?\nI pressed my hand firmly against my chest to calm my pounding heart as I lay on one side of the newly purchased bed.\nA pleasant sensation traveled through my hand, but my heart beat fiercely.\nI felt like screaming out loud.\nI would have been kicking the blankets if Siwoo wasn’t sleeping next to me.\n…He is sleeping, right?\nI turned my head slightly to look at Siwoo.\nThe bed we first slept in when we started living together here. Siwoo was sound asleep there.\n“Phew…”\nAs I sighed, I felt like some of the heat in my chest was released.\nBut perhaps because of my still pounding heart.\nI couldn’t control my body properly due to the strange sensation that was rising again.\nDid he notice? Did he not notice?\nThe fifteen minutes I was away from Siwoo.\nSiwoo’s clothes that I hurriedly took then.\nI still had one in my possession.\n“What should I do with this…”\nI fidgeted and took out the item I had hidden from Siwoo’s gaze.\nA t-shirt he often wears at home.\nIt’s the clothes he wears when training alone. Maybe because it needs to be washed every day? I remember there were lots of similar garments.\nHe buys several at once and adds more whenever he runs out since they get dirty or torn quickly.\n“…”\nI took out the shirt I had unconsciously taken and looked at it.\nNow that Siwoo is sleeping, wouldn’t it be okay if I return it now?\nHe probably wouldn’t notice such a small detail, even with his intuition.\nIf he knew I was holding his clothes, he would have said something by now.\nToday, Siwoo didn’t show any signs of noticing.\nEven when I said I accidentally spilled it, he just smiled and said it was okay. He didn’t seem very interested in the contents.\nI’m not sure why… Maybe he didn’t notice?\nYes, otherwise, Siwoo wouldn’t have acted normally.\nRight. It should be fine if I return it.\nI got up quietly, keeping an eye on Siwoo.\nWill Siwoo’s intuition notice me? Or will it just pass by?\nHoping he wouldn’t notice, I gently got up from the bed.\n“Mmm…”\n“…!”\nI froze momentarily, startled by Siwoo’s movement in his sleep.\nI sighed in relief as I watched Siwoo turn over again.\n…He’s sleeping. That scared me.\nI felt annoyed at Siwoo for no reason.\nIt’s not like I’m trying to steal anything.\nI’m just going to return it. Do I have to be this anxious?\nLeaving Siwoo still sleeping, I once again stepped out into the living room.\n“Phew… Thank goodness.”\nThinking that Siwoo might wake up from the sound if I closed the door, I ran to the laundry room on tiptoes without closing it.\n“Let’s see, it should be here…”\nAfter returning to the living room, Siwoo took the basket and said he would do it later.\nSure enough, the washing machine was quietly running late at night, making a low noise.\nCompared to the old world, it’s strangely advanced in these small details.\nIs it because of mana? I’m not sure.\nNo, now is not the time to be impressed by the washing machine’s performance.\nI need to return this quickly.\nIt’s still washing, so it should be fine if I put it together.\nThinking that, just as I was about to put the clothes in my hand into the washing machine.\nSuddenly, the clock caught my eye.\n“Come to think of it…”\nAlthough I was apart for fifteen minutes today, there was no problem.\nThat was the reason why I had unconsciously taken Siwoo’s clothes.\nIt was just in case, just maybe.\nIf I took Siwoo’s clothes. If so, I thought maybe it would be okay to be apart for a while.\nSo I was thinking about taking Siwoo’s clothes and unconsciously took them.\nWhen I almost got caught, did I hide them without realizing it?\nAs quickly as hiding inappropriate videos from parents.\nI never thought I could react that fast.\nI quickly pulled out Siwoo’s clothes’ thread thin enough not to be noticed by his eyes, rolled it up as much as possible and stuck it to my back, and he didn’t notice.\nMoving was a bit awkward because I would be caught if I showed my back.\n…No, that’s not important right now.\nSiwoo’s clothes. Will it really have the effect I thought it would?\n“Since it’s come to this, should I test it…”\nSiwoo is sleeping anyway.\nEven if my breathing becomes rapid, it should be fine if I return to the room quickly.\nThinking that, I decided to spend time leisurely.\nUsing the washing machine’s soft white noise as background, I spent about twenty minutes doing the cat’s cradle by pulling out a little thread.*\nWith slightly trembling hands, I touched Siwoo’s clothes.\n“…Why.”\nWhy does this actually work?\nUnable to hide my confusion, I fiddled with Siwoo’s clothes, and the trembling in my hands subsided a little.\n“No, this shouldn’t be possible…”\nI just thought it might work.\nI didn’t really think it would actually work.\nI was rather confused when what I had only thought about became reality.\nIt really works. I can endure for a long time even without Siwoo around.\nNumerous emotions swirled in my head.\nRelief that I might not need Siwoo’s help anymore.\nJoy that I could alleviate some of the guilt I’ve been carrying recently.\nI hugged Siwoo’s clothes.\nIt felt like the warmth was embracing my body.\nBefore I knew it, quite some time had passed.\nA soft melody signaling the end of the wash cycle played from the washing machine.\n“…Ah.”\nI randomly picked up some clothes from the washing machine as if entranced.\n“It’s cold…”\nI couldn’t feel any warmth.\nIt should be warm since even the drying is finished.\nFar from being warm, the night air felt cold.\nI put the clothes back in the washing machine and hugged the clothes in my hand once more.\nIt was still warm.\n“…I have no choice.”\nYes.\nThere’s no other way.\nI can’t possibly tell Siwoo about this.\nEven if I say I need his clothes, Siwoo would lend them without suspicion, thinking there must be some reason.\nConversely, no matter how much I needed them, he wouldn’t give me unwashed clothes.\nSo this is unavoidable.\nThere’s no other way.\nI looked at the clothes in my hand and then at the clock once more.\nAbout an hour had passed.\nI tightly hugged Siwoo’s clothes.\nA shirt larger than my body.\nThe large clothes felt as if they were embracing me.\nWhen I entered Siwoo’s room and lay on the bed, nothing was in my hands.\n***\n“…”\nArte returned to the bed, and soon, steady breathing could be heard.\nShe’s asleep.\nEven without looking, Siwoo could be certain she was asleep. Siwoo had that ability.\nLooking at the clock, more than an hour had passed.\nSiwoo carefully stepped out to the living room so as not to wake Arte and looked at her again.\nShe was still asleep.\n“Strange.”\nWhat happened for Arte to be walking around so normally like that?\nWhat was she doing and where for over an hour?\nSiwoo recalled Arte’s behavior today.\nSomething seemed suspicious right after she asked him what he had been doing recently.\n“It doesn’t seem like she found out.”\nWhen she suddenly asked if it was a woman, he unconsciously avoided her eyes, wondering if she had found out.\nAmelia said that these things are most effective when received without knowing anything.\nArte’s information-gathering skills are quite good.\nStill, he thought it would be better than her getting anxious and her symptoms worsening, so he was going to tell her, but somehow, he ended up not saying anything and glossing over it.\nAfter that, she suddenly went out, saying she would do laundry.\nFrom then on, Arte’s behavior became a bit strange.\n“It seems like she is hiding something…”\nSiwoo usually sensed Arte’s danger through intuition.\nThe reason he could find her like clockwork after ten minutes was because his intuition told him she was in danger.\nSo today too, he was spending time thinking she would return soon.\nSuddenly, he looked at the time and found that more than ten minutes had passed.\n“Why didn’t I notice…”\nDid he rely too much on his Intuition?\nSelf-deprecating like that, Siwoo rushed to Arte and was shocked to see her fine.\nThat’s when he realized. His intuition didn’t work because it thought Arte was okay.\n“…Hmm.”\nSiwoo realized. Surely, Arte’s sudden improvement in condition must be related to her behavior today.\nThe sudden unusual behavior she showed must be connected.\nHe headed to the laundry room where Arte had been staying.\nShe had been here for almost an hour. What did she want to do?\nSiwoo looked around the laundry room for a while.\nNo matter how much he looked, nothing strange caught his eye, and his intuition didn’t react either.\nSurely there must be something here.\nSuddenly, Siwoo’s eyes fell on the washing machine, which had completed its cycle.\nThere were traces of someone touching it.\nSince only one other person besides him is living in this house, it must have been Arte.\nWhat did she do here?\nSiwoo looked around the washing machine for a long time, checked all the clothes inside it, and then muttered.\n“…Why is one piece of clothing missing?”",

What is it?”\n‘Is it okay to say this?’\nWill there be any problem if he tells Amelia?\nSiwoo pondered for a long time.\nIs it really right to talk about the incident that happened at night?\nThe fact that Arte took his clothes was just his speculation.\nIs it right to talk about yesterday’s incident, or is it better not to?\nAfter much deliberation, Siwoo decided not to talk about it.\nIt felt like something he shouldn’t tell someone.\nHe thought that if Arte found out he had told Amelia, who knows what might happen.\nIt’s still just speculation after all.\nYes, for now.\n“…No, it’s nothing.”\n“What? Weren’t you going to say something?”\n“Well, that’s…”\nBut abruptly ending the conversation like this would only invite suspicion.\nSo, Siwoo decided to ask about the items Amelia had been preparing recently.\nHe needed her help with that too, anyway.\n“I was wondering if what you mentioned is being prepared well.”\n“You’re asking the obvious. Here, take this.”\nSiwoo couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw the object in Amelia’s hand.\nHe couldn’t even consider the possibility that she might be playing a prank on him.\nThe eerie magic could still be felt slightly even though time had passed since its death.\nIt was the thread of a monster.\n“…You really got it?”\n“You should know how lucky you are. By-products of Rank 2 monsters are usually hard to obtain. You know that, right?”\nWhile Amelia often shows unreliable aspects, she becomes a dependable ally at times like this.\nHe didn’t expect much When she told him she’d get some.\nTo be honest, when she said she would procure the materials herself, he thought it would be impossible.\nEven for Amelia, it would be difficult.\nBut to think she really obtained it.\n“You managed to get it. By-products of Rank 2’s are expensive, aren’t they? Did your father help you get this too?”\n“Huh? It’s easier to get than you might think.”\n“…Really?”\n“Ah, you might not know.”\nHe thought materials from Rank 2 monsters were astronomically expensive, but she says they’re easy to obtain.\nSeeing that he didn’t seem to understand properly, Amelia started explaining.\n“Look, think about it. Rank 2 monsters are hard to catch, right?”\n“Yeah, that’s right.”\nNot all magical beasts are the same.\nThey are divided into four categories, from 1 to 4 in order.\nAmong them, Rank 2 magical beasts are the strongest of the existing magical beasts.\nUnlike Rank 1, whose existence is questionable, they are the biggest obstacle threatening heroes on the frontlines.\nThey are the reason humanity hasn’t recovered all the land until now.\n“But heroes as strong as Dad can catch them, you know. It’s not like they’re Rank 1. You even subdued a Rank 3 once. When was…the entrance ceremony day, right?\nThe entrance ceremony.\nCome to think of it, that did happen.\nIt’s a story from less than a year ago but feels like a distant past.\nMaybe it’s because every day since entering school has been so intense.\n“But, being able to catch them doesn’t mean being able to subdue them. That’s why they’re rarely released to the market.”\n“Why is that?”\n“Why, you ask. To obtain by-products from magical beasts, you need to kill them as intact as possible, but there’s no luxury for that.”\nAmelia explained with a smile that during fights, they might burn all the fur that boasts tremendous strength, or if it’s a magical beast with magic eyes, they might crush its eyes.\nThe more outstanding parts make better materials, but inevitably, those parts get damaged during the fight.\n“Besides, if they remain intact, the people who caught them usually use them.”\n“I see.”\n“That’s why items made from high-ranking magical beast materials are expensive. They’re either in very small quantities, insufficient to use, or damaged.”\n“Then what did you mean by saying it’s easy to obtain?”\nAmelia’s words didn’t add up.\nIf it’s that difficult to obtain materials, surely what he asked for would have been hard to get too.\n“If it has no commercial value, it’s easier to obtain.”\n“…Commercial value?”\n“Why, even with crops, if they’re torn or damaged, they can’t be sold and are thrown away, right?”\nAh.\nOnly then did Siwoo understand what Amelia was trying to say.\nItems that can be used but are problematic for actual sale.\nThat’s what she meant.\n“Then…”\n“Dad happened to be going to catch a spider-type magical beast recently. So I asked him. If he could share some unused thread.”\nSiwoo looked at the dark red thread in Amelia’s hand.\nThe thread, surrounded by an ominous magical power, was neatly tied.\n“Thread of this length isn’t long enough to make clothes, and no one can use this as a weapon, right? This can’t be used for anything.”\n“…I see.”\n“But this is enough for you, right? You can just take all of it. How about that? Impressed by my skills?”\nAmelia, smiling proudly, suddenly looked amazing.\nIf it weren’t for her, he would have used ordinary thread.\nHe would have had to pay an astronomical amount if he had tried to buy such expensive items.\nSiwoo received the thread from Amelia with a slight smile, conveying his gratitude.\nHe knew that if he expressed his thanks out loud, she would wave it off and ask why he was being so creepy.\nSure enough, Amelia asked him without even considering the potential rudeness of him not giving a verbal thanks.\n“So? Have you still not decided what to make?”\n“I’m thinking of making a bracelet.”\n“A bracelet? Hmm, that’s good. Safe choice.”\nAmelia nodded, saying it was perfect for a gift.\nHe thought she would start saying he’s no good at this again.\n“By the way, what about Dorothy? What’s she doing over there?”\n“She says she has a headache because of you.”\n“Me?”\n“Yes, you. Do you have any experience making accessories or anything?”\n“No.”\n“Right. That’s why she’s going around like that, trying hard so you don’t ruin your gift. You really were born lucky.”\nNumerous papers were spread out at Dorothy’s head, who was lying face down on the desk.\nAmelia explained that all those papers were designs for various accessories.\n“Dorothy, wake up. He’s decided. It’s a bracelet.”\n“…Ugh, a, a bracelet? Here it is… No, not that one…where was it… Check the one on the floor…”\n“…Found it. Get some rest.”\n“Good night…”\nDorothy’s eyes were hollow as she woke up at Amelia’s urging.\nShe looked like a dying person, like someone who had been up for nights.\n“I told her to take it easy.”\n“…Is she okay? She looks really tired.”\n“Leave her be. She got excited, saying it was perfect timing as she had nothing to do and was bored, so she’s like that from researching. She didn’t need to stay up all night though.”\n“Well, Dorothy doesn’t really train much.”\n“It’s not efficient for her.”\nDorothy’s ability is Wizard.\nThough the name was misleading, it was an enhancement-type ability.\nThis was quite widely known within the academy.\nBecause it was a very rare ability.\n“It’s not like she’s given up completely. She’s doing enough to protect herself, so it should be fine.”\nUsually, abilities benefit oneself.\nLike strengthening the body, breathing fire, or making the body harder.\nSome abilities weaken other beings, but most don’t.\nIn that sense, Dorothy could be seen as quite unusual.\nShe can’t do anything alone, but her ability manifests when she has companions.\n“She’s just going to be like a backdrop in actual battles anyway, so it’s good that she’s at least training a bit, right?”\n“That’s true.”\nThat’s why Dorothy’s training is inefficient.\nShe can’t even cultivate her ability in the first place.\nOther students train their bodies while also honing their abilities, but Dorothy can’t do that.\nIt’s unavoidable since she needs to use her ability on others.\nThe two helped her occasionally, but they couldn’t always help.\n“Let’s talk about Dorothy later. Which one do you like best here?”\n“… There’s a lot. Very detailed.”\n“I told you. She has done a lot.”\nThe materials Dorothy handed over were neat and plentiful.\nDetailed explanations on how to make them, along with photos of the finished products.\nIt was such a clear instruction manual that even Siwoo, who had never made such things before, felt he could make them.\n“Let’s go with this one.”\n“This? It’s quite simple.”\n“Arte wasn’t the type to like decorating much. It seems better to go with something plain.”\n“You’ve really gotten better, considering the person you’re giving the gift to. Having something she can use daily is probably the best.”\nAmelia praised him, saying it was a good choice not to pick something flashy.\nWhile wondering if this was really worthy of praise, he felt a bit better after receiving the compliment.\nIt felt like his taste was being recognized.\n“I hope this improves that symptom you mentioned a bit.”\n“…Yeah.”\nAt Amelia’s subdued voice, his mood sank a little too.\nIf Arte doesn’t get better with this, how should he help her?\nIt was an action he started vaguely, but he felt a bit resentful of himself for being unable to think of any other method besides this.",

      "content": "Chapter 105\nTN: I have a gut feeling I used Grade 3 monsters in the early chapter, but I feel Rank 3 has a ring to it. Also thank James Baily for the chapter.\nI sighed deeply, breathing in and out.\nIt felt like a warm embrace enveloping my entire body.\nWhile I wanted to stay like this forever, addicted to the feeling, a sense of self-loathing washed over me, realizing what I was doing.\nMy mind understood I was doing something crazy, but I simply couldn’t stop.\n“It’s warm…”\nRecently, Siwoo had been secretly doing something without my knowledge.\nI was aware of this fact but didn’t confront him about it.\nNo, I didn’t even have the intention to do it.\nBecause I also had something I was doing behind Siwoo’s back.\nAn act I didn’t want anyone to discover.\n“Haa… It’s nice.”\nTaking advantage of Siwoo’s absence, I took out the hidden item once more and hugged it tightly.\nThe lingering anxiety completely vanished as I embraced the item again.\nInstead of anxiety, I felt stability and comfort.\nNo matter how much I thought about it, I had to stop. But I couldn’t stop.\nI looked at the hidden clothes. Siwoo didn’t seem to have noticed.\n…Did he really not notice?\nI had been observing Siwoo’s behavior for a while, but he showed no signs of noticing.\nFortunately, even with his intuition, he couldn’t seem to detect something like this.\nIf Siwoo had found this, I would have had the courage to hang myself with a rope.\nIt was truly fortunate.\nThese days, Siwoo spends a long time at his desk, working on some small object.\nI didn’t know what it was, but he never showed it to me, so I couldn’t confirm what it was supposed to be\n“…Alright. That’s it for today.”\nAt first, Siwoo’s abnormalities made me incredibly anxious.\nSo much so that I ordered a background check on him.\nBut now, I hoped Siwoo would have his own time.\nIf we were always together, I would end up showing this side of myself.\nEven if someone else looked at me strangely, Siwoo wouldn’t be any different.\nEspecially since he was the owner of this item.\n“…It seems to have weakened.”\nSecretly from Siwoo, I put the shirt into a drawer I had made in a corner he rarely checked.\nIt seemed like the performance was deteriorating as time passed.\nI thought it would be nice to feel the warmth just by having this, even without Siwoo, but I encountered an unexpected problem.\nAt first, the warm feeling was sufficient even for a brief moment, but now I had to hug it for longer to feel the warmth.\nNo matter how much I thought about it, there was only one reason.\nAnd there was only one way to solve this problem.\n“…Gulp.”\nI looked around. Siwoo was still not there.\nNow was my chance.\nNow, while Siwoo hadn’t noticed.\nNow, while he hadn’t grasped what was happening.\nIf I swapped this item now…\nI knew that if I did this, I could no longer make excuses.\nI could make an excuse that the first time was because I was surprised…\nBut from the second action onwards, such excuses wouldn’t work.\nMy heart pounded at the thought of being caught, cold sweat running down my cheeks.\nAnd my eyes, having lost their place due to anxiety, couldn’t stay still and moved around restlessly.\nIf I got caught.\nIf Siwoo noticed something strange.\nSuch thoughts swirled in my mind.\nEven though my mind told me not to, I moved.\nWith one hand gripping Siwoo’s shirt haphazardly.\nMy eyes fixed on the room where he was, ears perked up.\nTaking a light breath…\nQuickly, after picking up a shirt carelessly placed in Siwoo’s laundry basket, I put down the shirt I was holding.\nAnd then I ran.\nI quickly left the living room and hid in the laundry room.\n“…Did I get caught?”\nI stole again. This time, completely of my own will.\nNow, I couldn’t even make excuses.\nStealing the clothes of the person I was indebted to, in their own house.\nI felt sorry for him, but as soon as I hugged the shirt in my hand, the warmth made me feel good.\nIf someone else saw me, would they think I was a pervert hugging someone else’s clothes?\nBut I couldn’t help but make excuses.\nIt wasn’t that I was a pervert, but…\nFor some reason, Siwoo’s clothes were warm.\nAnd, well.\nHe must be having a hard time too.\nIf we were always together, there would be times when he would get annoyed.\nSo, I kept this as a precaution during those times.\nI absolutely had no other intentions.\nAfter confirming no one was there, I glanced at the living room and hugged it again.\nThe still-warm shirt gave me a sense of satisfaction.\n***\n“…Is this right?”\n(What, isn’t this what you wanted? They made progress)\n“It is, but…”\nThe girl was taken aback by the sight of the Reader hugging the Protagonist’s clothes with a grin on her face.\nIt felt quite different from what she had imagined.\nThe Reader was rubbing her face against the shirt as if she were on drugs.\n“Isn’t it a bit… unsavory?”\nStrange.\nHow did it turn out like this?\nThe pure girl muttered to herself as she looked at the scene.\nAlthough she had pushed her back a little, she never imagined it would worsen to this extent.\nA heroine rubbing her face against a man’s shirt…?\n“Somehow, it doesn’t seem that bad either?”\n(This girl, seriously…)\n“No, really. Think about it. Isn’t this fine in its own way?”\nThe girl thought as she looked at the Reader.\nIt was slightly different from what she had imagined, but the distance between her and the Protagonist had noticeably decreased.\nIf she rubbed her face against his shirt, what more was there to say?\n“The Reader seems to have a bit of an aversion to romance.”\nShe should have brought a woman’s soul if she had known this would happen.\nShe had briefly thought about it, but the Reader probably wouldn’t have been this interesting if she had done that.\nIn other words, this was an inevitable side effect. That’s what the girl thought.\nHowever, her goal was for the two to become inseparable.\nThe Protagonist seemed to be interested, but the problem was the opposite.\nThe Reader didn’t seem to have any.\nShe only treated him as the Protagonist.\nAlthough it had improved a bit recently…\nShe didn’t seem to see him as the opposite sex.\n“It would have been nice if Amelia had put in a little more effort.”\n(That crazy bitch?)\n“Don’t call my Amelia a crazy bitch!”\nOne of the best things she did in this world was setting Amelia as the heroine.\nHmph, they don’t even know.\nThere were so many moments when Amelia tried to connect Siwoo and Arte, knowingly or unknowingly.\nThe Reader didn’t seem to be aware of it.\n“Hmph. You guys just watch and see.”\nIf the mood had become like that, the Reader from a few days ago would have refused.\nBut what about in her current state?\nThe Reader who stole someone else’s shirt and hugged it, something she wouldn’t have even thought of a few days ago?\n“Heh, hehehe… Hehehehehehe…”\n(Seriously, she’s putting on airs in the most useless parts…)\n“Shut up!”\n***\n“…Ugh.”\nSiwoo glared at the thread he received from Amelia.\nAlthough he was a bit worried about Arte, she said she was getting better recently, so it was okay even if she wasn’t right in front of him.\nThat’s why he tried to act as quickly as possible.\n…Because it was an obvious lie from Arte.\nHe felt that, if anything, she had gotten worse, but he found no sign of it.\nHe knew she was lying, but Siwoo decided to let it slide.\nBecause he also had something he was keeping secret from her.\nSince he was genuinely worried, he tried to finish as quickly as possible, but…\nAn unexpected problem arose.\n“What should I do…”\nHe thought he had enough thread.\nSince this was his first time doing this work, he made various mistakes, and plenty of threads became too short to use.\nPerhaps it was because craftsmanship was a separate matter from intuition.\nAlthough his skills had improved significantly compared to the first time…\n“I can’t ask for more of this.”\nSince it was a material from a Rank 2 monster, he couldn’t buy it himself.\nThere was no guarantee that there would be stock either.\nIt seemed like it could be completed with just a little more.\nWhen he felt Arte’s gaze watching him.\nAt that moment, while he was hiding it in a hurry, the thread broke slightly.\nAlthough it was a monster’s thread, perhaps because he was also a superhuman, it broke more easily than he expected.\nWhy is it so weak?\nSiwoo glared at the thread, even though it was his own mistake.\nTo think that the work that could have been finished today ended up like this.\nHe let out a small sigh.\n“It’s not like I have more thread…”\nHe thought it would be plain with a single color, so he considered adding a little accent.\nSo, he was thinking of using dye to change the color of the thread in that part.\nBefore coloring that part, he was checking the approximate length when it broke.\n“Haa…”\nWhat should he do now?\nAs Siwoo sighed, a thought crossed his mind.\n…There was that thread, wasn’t there?\nHe suddenly raised his head and looked at the black thread still in its place.\nAn item he had thought of throwing away someday but forgot about.\nThat item was flaunting its presence.\n“It doesn’t necessarily have to be a monsters thread…?”\nA glint appeared in Siwoo’s eyes.\nHe found an alternative.",

      "content": "Chapter 106\nTN: Thank Viiyen for the chapter.\n“…”\nIt’s complete.\nSiwoo looked at the bracelet in his hand.\nPure white with dark red crimson accents.\nThe two contrasting colors shimmered under the light.\n“…Would this be enough?”\nIt seemed to be well-made.\nHe compared it once more with the materials that Dorothy had diligently prepared.\nPerhaps it was because it was his first time making such an item, and he had never been interested in accessories.\nHe couldn’t tell if it was well-made or not.\nIt seemed to be made similarly.\nIs it… okay?\nAfter staring at it under the light for a while, Siwoo finally put the bracelet down on the desk.\nHe couldn’t tell even after looking at it.\nPersonally, it seemed fine, but…\nHe couldn’t help but think that it would look pretty in his eyes because he made it himself.\n“I can ask tomorrow.”\nSiwoo decided to show the bracelet to Amelia and Dorothy after going to the academy tomorrow, and stretched his arms.\nHis body wouldn’t get stiff just from sitting for a while as a superhuman, but there was something called mood.\nLooking at the clock, he suddenly realized several hours had passed.\nWhat could Arte be doing?\nA few days ago, she seemed anxious enough to be in danger if he wasn’t by her side.\nSiwoo decided to give Arte a gift because of that.\nHoping it would make her feel a little better.\nEven if he wasn’t there, if she could caress the bracelet, perhaps she would feel a bit better.\nIt was Amelia’s idea, but he thought it made sense, so he worked hard to make it.\n“Fortunately, she seems to be doing much better these days.”\nWould Arte be uncomfortable?\nWas her pride hurt because he needed to be by her side?\nIt must be hard for her too.\nWith that thought, he made it, but while making it, Arte’s symptoms improved significantly.\nHe felt a bit of regret, thinking he might have made it for nothing…\nBut it’s not like he would throw away a gift he had already made.\n‘I might as well give it to her.’\nTomorrow, after receiving honest evaluations from the two, it should be fine to give it to her.\n“Arte, are you outside?”\nBut he was still worried. It hadn’t been long since she improved.\nSo he called out to Arte, who should be in the living room, but there was no answer.\n“…?”\nStrange.\nWhy isn’t she answering?\n“Arte? …Is there a problem?”\nHe tried to find Arte again and opened the door.\nStill, no answer.\nThere was no sign of human presence in the living room either.\n“…Arte?”\nSuddenly, anxiety washed over Siwoo.\nHis Intuition was still quiet, meaning there were no problems with Arte.\nBut there’s no way she would be this quiet if nothing was wrong.\nThere’s no way she couldn’t have heard him looking for her.\nSomething was wrong.\n“Answer if you can hear me!”\nMaybe he was too careless.\n‘Did I treat Arte too indifferently, thinking that she seemed to be getting better little by little and that it would be okay since I had intuition?’\nSuddenly, the image of Arte gasping for air and looking for him came to mind.\nCould it be that she couldn’t answer his voice because she couldn’t breathe?\nSo she couldn’t even come looking for him?\nYou fool. What do you mean you don’t want to see her like that?\nArte still hasn’t fully recovered, and even with Intuition, he isn’t omnipotent.\nBlaming himself, Siwoo quickly moved his feet and searched around the house.\nStill, Arte was nowhere to be seen, and Siwoo gulped in front of the laundry room door, the last remaining place.\nIf Arte isn’t here either.\nIf that’s really the case…\nIs this how it would feel to have left a child by the pool?\nIs this how it would feel to realize you forgot to leave a child in a hot car during the sweltering summer?\n‘Arte is definitely not a child, but she needs my help.’\nHe was too optimistic in her recovery.\nWould staying by her side have been more helpful than making a bracelet?\nWith such thoughts constantly coming to mind, Siwoo opened the door to the laundry room, suppressing his anxiety.\nIf she’s not here either, he plans to report it to the police.\n“Arte! You’re here…”\n“…Ah.”\nOkay, let’s calm down.\nSiwoo felt relieved to find Arte first, but he was perplexed before he could feel relieved.\nArte had her face buried in his clothes.\nAs if she was happy.\nAs if she hadn’t even thought he would come, she stared at him blankly, unable to accept the situation.\n“Um, well, you see. You weren’t answering at all, so I thought. Maybe something was wrong…”\n“Ah, ah. Uh.”\n“Sorry.”\nAs Arte realized the situation and her face gradually turned red, he hurriedly closed the door to the laundry room.\nShe would want to be alone now.\nAfter closing the door, Siwoo stood there blankly and put his hand on his forehead.\nYeah, she was fine after all. Of course.\nWhen Arte didn’t answer, he must have panicked without realizing it, thinking bad thoughts.\n“AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH……!”\nHe heard Arte’s scream from behind the door.\nYeah, that’s right.\nIt wasn’t his imagination.\nHe thought one of his clothes was missing and went about his day.\nBut Arte had been hiding it.\n“…Haa.”\nThis is troublesome.\n‘How should I face Arte now?’\n***\n“…So?”\n“That’s it.”\n“…”\nDoes this guy even know what he’s saying?\nAmelia wanted to smack the head of the guy, who was making a serious expression in front of her, but she erased the thought.\n…Yeah, there’s no reason for him to lie.\nShe let out a small sigh.\n“So, you want me to believe that?”\n“…”\n“You want me to believe that Arte stole your clothes in your house without you knowing and was sniffing the scent of those clothes?”\n“… It’s strange after all, right?”\n“Does that make sense!”\nShe couldn’t hold back and tried to smack his head, but he quickly dodged it thanks to that damn Intuition, making her even more irritated.\n‘Someday, when I become faster than he can react, I’ll smack his head so hard that it peels.’\n“…What pisses me off more is that it doesn’t seem to be a lie!”\nShe glanced at Arte, who was sitting far away from them, unlike usual.\nArte, who always watched over Siwoo.\nBut she didn’t even look at him and buried her face in the desk.\n“What do you want me to do about this?!”\n“…Is there no way?”\n“What do you think I am!”\n‘Does this guy think I’m a machine that gives the correct answer whenever he asks?’\nShe’s even more pissed because he didn’t even think about that.\n“Haa…”\nHolding her throbbing head, she sat back down.\nIt was a bit much to say this out loud.\nPerhaps because she stood up and spoke loudly as if we were arguing, the gazes focused on them began to scatter.\n“Let’s go over it again. Arte is dependent on you, right?”\n“Yeah.”\n“It was so severe that she had separation anxiety? That’s why you’re living together at your house, right?”\n“That’s right.”\n“…I thought she was getting a little better recently, so you felt relieved, but she was stealing your clothes and sniffing them?”\n“Exactly.”\n“Haa…”\nAmelia sighed and looked at Arte.\nHer earlobes, redder than usual, caught her eye.\nShe’s probably recalling yesterday’s incident that Siwoo mentioned.\n‘This is driving me crazy.’\nIs she a teenage boy who was accidentally caught with pornography by his parents?\n“…Could it be because she feels reassured?”\n“Reassured?”\nDorothy, quietly listening to the conversation, offered her opinion as if she had finished thinking.\n“I mean… If she has Siwoo’s clothes, you know. It might feel like Siwoo is nearby.”\n“…”\n“You said she gets anxious when separated from him, right? Then conversely, it means she feels more reassured the closer she is to him.”\n“Ah.”\nCome to think of it, that’s right.\nSiwoo had suspected that Arte’s behavior might be separation anxiety.\nIf so, it’s natural that she would feel more reassured the closer she is to him.\n“Since she developed separation anxiety, has Arte ever clung to you or anything like that?”\n“…Once.”\n“That might be why.”\nDorothy, are you enjoying this?\nShe must have been looking so tired that she could die from researching how to make handmade accessories.\nBut as soon as she heard Siwoo’s story, her expression suddenly brightened.\n“That must have been when she felt the most reassured, right? Since she was hugging you tightly.”\nDorothy said with a grin on her face, not even trying to hide it.\n“She must have accidentally discovered it. That Siwoo’s belongings also make her feel reassured.”\n“… Isn’t that just a guess?”\n“No! I’m sure of it!”\nAmelia was convinced.\nDorothy is definitely enjoying this.\nShe was perplexed by the fact that she was hugging Siwoo’s clothes.\nBut Dorothy seemed to like it.\n“Okay, let’s say your guess is right. Then how do we solve it?”\n“What? That’s easy.”\n“Easy?… What do we do?”\nWhen Siwoo and Amelia looked clueless, Dorothy smiled and told them.\n“If something can make her feel more reassured than a shirt, it’ll be fine!”\n“…Something that can make her feel more reassured?”\n“Hug her all night long!”\n“I can’t!”\n“Aww…”\nDorothy, who expressed her dissatisfaction as if it was unfortunate, continued as if she had no choice.\n“If that doesn’t work… Well, it can’t be helped. Give her a heartfelt gift.”\n“A gift…”\n“Yes, the one you brought today. You made it well. It should be fine to give it to her tonight!”\n…Dorothy, you’re incredibly excited.\nYou really like this kind of thing.",

After I was caught doing something I shouldn’t have done by Siwoo,\nHe didn’t say a single word to me all day.\nHe just treated me as usual.\nIt was probably out of consideration. I wasn’t in a state to listen even if he said something.\nHowever, even if I received such consideration, nothing changed.\nThe fact that I was caught secretly hugging Siwoo’s shirt after keeping it a secret from him doesn’t change.\nI, who had spent the whole night with my eyes open, was contemplating how to die with the least amount of pain.\nThe least painful death would be a death using drugs, but…\nIf I left Siwoo’s side, he would follow me, worried, so purchasing things were impossible.\nInitially, I was supposed to be the one monitoring Siwoo, but at some point, it felt like we were monitoring each other.\n“…Is this the only way after all?”\nI looked at the school uniform fluttering in the wind.\nIf I weave this well, hang it from the ceiling, and hang it around my neck, wouldn’t I die instantly?\n“Arte.”\n“…”\nNo, it might be too painful after all…\nBut stabbing myself with a knife or cutting my body with wire seems a bit too much. It would be even more painful.\n“Arte!”\n“Ah, yes…?”\n“What are you thinking so deeply about? You’re not even listening when I talk. Is something bothering you?”\nDorothy and Amelia were looking at me with concerned expressions.\nJudging from what they just said, they must have called me several times.\nThey came this close because I wasn’t answering.\n…What should I say?\nShould I tell them the truth?\nThat I was secretly stealing Siwoo’s shirts and hugging them, savoring them, and while doing so, I didn’t notice that he was looking for me and got caught?\nThat I was thinking of dying because I couldn’t bear the shame?\nThere’s no way I could say that.\nI decided to brush it off appropriately.\n“It’s nothing.”\n“It doesn’t seem like nothing.”\n“Why did you call me?”\n“… You’re not good at changing the subject, are you? Well, fine. I’ll let it slide. You know, the midterm exams are ending in a few days, right?”\nIt would have been a bit troublesome if they had kept pressing me.\nFortunately, Amelia let it slide, so I was saved.\nBy the way, has that much time already passed?\nI had completely forgotten about the midterm exams, but Amelia’s words finally reminded me.\nThe time for the midterm exams to end was approaching.\n“We’re guaranteed to be at the top, right, Arte?”\n“That’s right. Our classmates are envious.”\n“It’s just bad luck for them.”\nI wonder. Is it really just luck?\nOther students took it easy in the beginning because they could see the villains’ activities gradually becoming more active.\nIt was an attempt to gain points more efficiently.\nThen, the villains’ activities very suddenly became scarce.\nThe reason? It’s obviously because of me.\n“Arachne suddenly resumed their activities, so the villains tucked their tails and ran.”\n“I feel bad for the villains too.”\nAt first, we resumed our activities because of the impersonator issue, but we gained an unexpected harvest.\nWe secured a top spot without much trouble.\nThanks to that, we spent a long time without classes, just doing personal training.\n“…So?”\n“Huh?”\n“I get that the midterm exams are ending, but why did you bother to…”\nHonestly, I didn’t really care about the midterm exams ending.\nI don’t even have any feelings about taking the midterm exams. We were either getting first or second.\nMoreover, the ones competing against us are right before me.\nWe may not be a team, but the four of us have it all figured out.\nDue to the overwhelming gap we gained, we didn’t need to do more.\nTo suddenly bring up the midterm exams now…\n“Well, that’s…”\n“Well?”\n“To celebrate the end, I wanted to have some fun today… Is that not okay?”\nJust go have fun.\nWhy are you asking me?\nI was thinking that, but I felt the gazes of the two looking at me.\n“Siwoo also agreed to come. What do you think?”\n“…Siwoo too?”\n“Yeah.”\nWhy are the two acting like they’re gauging my reaction?\nI unconsciously realized the reason.\n“Where are you planning to go?”\n“Huh?… No, well. Nothing special. Just going shopping at the shopping district or something like that.”\nAs I thought.\nJust an invitation to hang out. Without any particular plan.\nI recalled the time before I came to this world.\nSometimes, my friends would invite me like this.\n“Okay.”\n“What? Really?”\nWhen I nodded in agreement, the two showed a surprised reaction, and I almost felt a little hurt.\nWas it just a perfunctory question for me?\n“Ah, no. Don’t misunderstand. It was just a bit unexpected.”\n“…Unexpected?”\n“We were hoping you would come, but…”\nThey didn’t really expect me to come, something like that.\n…Well, I wasn’t originally planning to go either, so it might not be wrong.\n“I just thought, maybe this kind of thing would be nice occasionally.”\nWas it a coincidence that I suddenly remembered the time before I came to this world?\nI unconsciously accepted the invitation, which seemed like a friend casually asking me to hang out.\n“But you do have some kind of plan, right?”\n“Huh? Hmm… Should we think about it now…?”\n“Haa…”\nThey just suggested going out to play without any plan. It’s the same here as it was…\nI sighed and looked out the window.\nThe clear sky without a single cloud was spread out.\n“…I just thought, maybe this kind of thing would be nice occasionally.”\nI muttered softly and thought again.\nThat’s all. Amelia and Dorothy are not people.\nThey’re just puppets.\nSuddenly, I missed the Author.\nWithout her, I forget that I am surrounded by dolls.\n***\n“She’s coming?”\n“Yeah. But why did you suddenly suggest going out to play? It was hard trying to brush it off.”\n“I felt like we should.”\n“…?”\nSiwoo couldn’t tell them more.\nHis ability wasn’t the type that could be controlled.\nIntuition is useful.\nIt’s a reliable ability, almost like precognition, when it comes to dangerous situations or something he absolutely thinks shouldn’t happen.\nBut on the flip side, that means he grew dull in other places.\nArte stole his clothes.\nIt’s easy to understand if you think about the fact that he didn’t notice something like that.\nBut sometimes.\nVery rarely, there are moments when something suddenly comes to mind like this.\nA flash of insight, like he needs to take a certain action right away or someone will be in danger.\n“Somehow, I felt like doing this would lead to a better outcome.”\n“…Your Intuition?”\n“Yeah.”\nThere was a reason he didn’t go and only sent Amelia and Dorothy.\nHe forcibly pushed the two to stall as he devised a plan.\nSiwoo didn’t know exactly what would move in a better direction through this action.\nBut if there’s one thing for sure, his intuition won’t let things take a turn for the worse for Arte.\n“If that’s the case… It’s actually good timing. You have something to give her, right?”\n“Ah, right.”\n“It doesn’t seem like it needs any modifications. You made it well.”\nHe was pleased with Amelia’s praise.\nGiven her background, she must have a good eye for these kinds of accessories.\nIf she approves of it, it should be fine.\n“But what’s this thread?”\n“Thread?”\n“Yeah. This dark crimson thread. It’s nice that you emphasized the white thread with a complementary color, but where did you get it?”\n“Ah.”\nThe sudden question made him feel like his words were stuck in his throat.\nHow should he explain this?\n“It’s nothing.”\n“What is it? I’m just curious… The texture is really soft. It could be used for underwear, right?”\nHe couldn’t help but shiver at Amelia’s words.\n…Why is she so unnecessarily sharp sometimes?\n***\n“Heh, hehehe. I’ve gathered them. I’ve gathered them all.”\nThe girl in rags looked up at the sky.\nThe sky, without a single cloud, filled the girl’s vision.\nThe weather seemed to celebrate her achievement, and the girl’s mood brightened.\n“I’ve finally gathered them all, Mir. I’ve gathered all the comrades.”\n“That’s great, Annie. Are you going to take revenge now? Are you going to make everyone equal?”\n“Not yet.”\n“…Why?”\nIf someone had been watching the hooded girl, they would have thought she was crazy.\nTalking to herself, answering herself.\nIt was truly the behavior of a madwoman.\n“Think about it, Mir. The reason we lost.”\n“We weren’t prepared enough.”\n“That’s right. We weren’t prepared enough. We didn’t have enough people.”\nHowever, someone who had watched the girl closely would have tried to run away immediately at the bizarre sight.\nThe figure inside the hood was a monster wearing a human mask.\n“We need subordinates. Subordinates who will fight alongside us.”\n“…But Annie. We’ve lost our foundation. Will there be anyone who will follow our cause?”\n“Don’t worry, Mir. Don’t worry. It’s okay if they’re not human.”\nA conglomeration of various animals.\nHer eyes were filled with a madness that couldn’t be called human.\nIt was already a sight that couldn’t be considered human.\n“Let’s go to the front lines. There will be friends who can help us there.”\n“You’re talking about the monsters, right, Annie?”\n“Yeah. What do you think?”\n“You’re really smart. As expected, there’s no one but Annie.”\n“…Hehehe.”\nThe girl, no.\nThe monster took a step.\nStep, step.\nA crimson path followed where it walked.",

      "content": "“…Wow.”\nThe dazzling lights flickered, dizzying my eyes.\nA scene unfolded before me, making me realize again that this world was made of magic and supernatural powers.\n“What are you looking at so amazed? As if you’ve never been to a place like this before.”\nWithout even thinking of answering Amelia’s words, I blankly stared at the scenery of the place we had entered.\n“Arte?”\nStrange objects float in the air as if ignoring the laws of physics.\nColorful accessories emitting colors that seemed to be not of this world.\nIt would be fine to call it a truly magical space.\n“These things are…”\n“They’re made with the abilities of superhumans. Haven’t you seen them before?”\n“Abilities?”\nA scene you would only see in movies or animations.\nEven when I looked to see if there was any mechanical device, there was no such feeling at all.\n“Yeah. They’re made by superhumans who retired from the front lines.”\n“…Superhumans.”\n“What, you sound like you didn’t know. Only superhumans can use mana, so it’s obvious.”\nThere was nothing wrong with what Amelia said.\nOnly superhumans can make things like this.\nEven knowing that fact, I couldn’t believe it.\n“…”\nMaybe I didn’t want to believe it.\n…Yes, there can’t only be superhumans who just fight.\nThere must be superhumans who make things like this too.\nKilling and fighting.\nNot everyone partook in it.\n“I’m just amazed.”\nThe reason I had turned a blind eye to that fact was simple.\nJust that one trivial reason.\nJust the thought that there might be superhumans who live ordinary lives made this world seem more real.\nSo I turned a blind eye.\nBut recently, it has become difficult to ignore these trivial things.\nIs it because the Author disappeared and I started to feel warmth from Siwoo?\nIs this world really a puppet show?\nCould it be that it’s actually just another world?\nI started to think that way.\n“…Well, fine. It seems like it’s your first time coming to a place like this. That’s even better. You’ll be really amazed. You can look forward to it.”\nI don’t know why Amelia is so confident. It’s not like she made it herself.\nIf I were the me from the entrance ceremony, I would have snorted and brushed it off.\nEven Amelia’s behavior seemed normal for someone her age, and it felt strange.\nAs if she really seemed like an ordinary student.\nLike a real person, not a puppet.\n“What are you two doing there?! Come quickly!”\n“Ah. We’ll be right there!… Let’s go, Arte.”\n“Alright.”\nI don’t know.\nI tried to cut off my thoughts in my head, not wanting to think about it as always, but it didn’t work well.\nDorothy’s expression and gestures urged us.\nAmelia’s behavior of checking occasionally if I’m following as she walks.\nClearly, nothing has changed. Dorothy hasn’t changed, and Amelia is the same as always.\nSo the reason I have different feelings when I see them must be because I have changed.\n“What were you talking about?”\n“Nothing much. She says it’s her first time coming to a place like this, so she’s amazed.”\n“…Really?”\n“Yes. It’s my first time coming to a place like this.”\nIn novels, superhumans always fight.\nThey stand against society, monsters, and sometimes each other.\nSo, I might have vaguely thought there were no superhumans other than heroes and villains.\nSuperhumans who always fight, like puppets in a play.\nAnd the superhumans I’ve actually seen have always been like that.\nFighting villains, fighting heroes, fighting monsters.\nA story of this world that I had never seen before I fell into this world.\nThat’s why. Because I’ve seen such things.\nI couldn’t erase the thought that this world seemed even more like a created world.\n“But it doesn’t seem bad. It’s pretty.”\n“That’s a relief.”\n“…Yes.”\nBut if I see a scene like this.\nIf I see that superhumans aren’t just people who hurt others.\nCan I still think of this world as just a well-constructed world?\nI looked at the scene in front of me once again.\nA scene that shows magical beauty, still very different from the world I originally lived in.\nPeople were happily laughing and chatting about things they had never seen before.\n***\n“What are you doing there?”\n“Hmm, well, that’s…”\n“You should give that thing soon. It’ll be midnight in a bit… Don’t tell me you plan to give it to her at home?”\n“No, I should give it to her here.”\nSiwoo fiddled with the bracelet in his hand at Dorothy’s words.\n‘Yeah, I should give it to her soon.’\nHe knew he should give it to her, but…\n“It’s hard to find the right timing because Arte looks so happy.”\n“…Ah. That’s true. I didn’t expect her to be that excited.”\nIf he had known she would be this happy, maybe he should have taken her out to play earlier.\nDorothy’s face was full of smiles as she muttered like that.\nFollowing her gaze, he saw Amelia and Arte doing something.\nArte’s expressions… The same smiling face as always.\nShe walks around with an unnatural smile.\nA forced smile.\nThe unpleasant feeling of smiling even though she was not happy made her seem suspicious.\nArte, who was playing with Amelia, was also smiling as usual.\nBut if there was a difference from before, could it be that her expression seemed to have a little bit of sincerity?\n‘Is she gradually starting to accept people other than me?’\nIt made him feel good to see Arte growing a little bit.\n“But it’s strange. Doesn’t everyone come to a place like this at least once?”\n“…Who knows? She must have circumstances we don’t know about.”\n“Is that so?”\nAnother thing Siwoo realized while living with Arte,\nShe lacks common sense.\nTo a really strange degree.\nShe was good at cooking, laundry, cleaning, and there wasn’t much she couldn’t do.\nBut he could tell that Arte lacked common sense whenever she watched the news.\nWhenever she heard content about social issues, he felt that Arte didn’t understand it.\nLast time, he asked Arte for her opinion on the news’s content, thinking she might understand it.\nWhat she thought about that.\nAt that time, she just smiled and said she wasn’t interested in such things, so she didn’t know.\n…Even though it was about a former villain who turned over a new leaf and turned himself in.\nEven though he was a really famous person that Arachne would know about.\nWhenever we go out somewhere, her gaze wanders here and there, looking amazed at various products.\nEven though she’s good at cooking, she sometimes presents a dish he’s never seen before and she gets flustered when he says it’s his first time eating it.\nOn the contrary, sometimes, when he cooks, she looks at it in wonder, saying it’s a dish she’s never seen before.\nIt felt like looking at a tourist who went on an overseas trip.\nSomeone who knows nothing about the culture here.\n“…Are you going?”\n“Yeah. I have to go.”\n“Good luck… You know you shouldn’t ask her to marry you, right?”\n“What are you…”\n“Hehe. I’m just kidding.”\nIf the situation is really not much different from what I felt.\nIf Arte came from a place far enough to feel uncomfortable here.\nThen it would be nothing but unsettling.\nNo family, no friends, no acquaintances.\nWhat would it feel like to live in a place where you can’t even reminisce about memories?\nIt’s hard for him to imagine.\nFor Siwoo, who has friends, family, and people he could turn to…\n“…Arte must be lonely.”\nStealing his clothes.\nHe didn’t mind that.\nBecause he had also done something bad.\nBecause he had done something he couldn’t tell Arte.\n…Actually, quite a lot.\n“She must have done it because she was lonely.”\nHow lonely would it be to live in a world where you can’t see anyone as people and can only open up to a single person?\nSiwoo couldn’t even guess.\nWouldn’t she be so unimaginably lonely?\n“Hey, Arte.”\n“…Yes? Uh, weren’t you with Dorothy? Where’s Dorothy…?”\n“…”\nDid she realize what he was trying to do when he spoke to her?\nAmelia left the spot, looking at Arte’s reaction.\nShe’s really quick-witted.\nWorthy of a woman who prides herself on being the fastest in the world.\n“…Um, well.”\nTo be honest, he knew this looked like a confession.\nIf it weren’t for the two people who came with them, it may have well passed as a date.\n…He couldn’t say he didn’t have such ulterior motives.\nHe didn’t know when, but Arte kept worrying him.\nI didn’t want her to get hurt.\nI didn’t want her to do anything dangerous.\nI didn’t want her to go down the wrong path.\nSince when? Why did it turn out like this?\nThe first impression must have been a hostile existence, let alone a bad one.\nHe remembered the days when he cried at night because he was scared of the extremely suspicious Arte.\n‘If I told the past me he would be sleeping in the same room as her, he would have told me to stop talking nonsense.’\nFalling for such a nasty person. It was clear that he would yell to stop talking crazy.\nImagining that, he unconsciously let out a laugh.\nThat doesn’t matter now.\nHe decided to fill her mind with happiness to overwrite whatever her past held.\nSo this is a confession, but it’s not a confession.\nHow many times had he resolved to help Arte in his heart?\nNow, it was time to put it into words.\n“I have something to say.”",

      "content": "“You have something to say?”\n“Yeah.”\n…Here?\nSuddenly?\nStunned by Siwoo’s sudden words, I blankly looked around.\nPeople chatting loudly and machines shining brilliantly.\nWasn’t this supposed to be a celebration for finishing the exams?\nI fiddled with the device in my hand that I had been using with Amelia just a moment ago.\n“Um, can’t we talk about it when we get…?”\n…I guess that won’t work.\nSeeing Siwoo’s serious face, I swallowed my complaint about talking later.\nIt was more fun than I expected.\nWith a hint of regret, I looked at the device I had been using until now and then put it down.\nIt’s okay to enjoy these things again later.\nIt was a really amazing and interesting item, but that’s all.\nCompared to Siwoo, it’s just an object worse than the garbage on the street.\n“…Yes, what is it?”\nBy the way, what could it be all of a sudden?\nNo matter how much I think about it, I can’t figure out the reason.\nWas there a reason for Siwoo to look at me with such a serious expression?\nCountless delusions flashed through my mind in an instant.\n…Could it be that this place is actually a hideout for a villain organization?\nTo be honest, I knew this seemed like an overblown delusion.\nThe idea is that a secret organization exists underground in a place where people normally enjoy entertainment.\nI know that such thoughts are childish, the kind that even middle school students wouldn’t have.\nBut because of the Author’s existence, I couldn’t help but have such suspicions.\nThe Author had always been like that.\nInserting absurd settings and smiling brightly, saying it would be fun.\n“Well, um…”\nSiwoo, who had a serious expression, suddenly looked away with a slightly troubled face.\nIs it difficult to talk about it here?\n“If it’s difficult to talk about it here, how about we step outside for a bit?”\n“No. It’s not that… Here, will you accept this?”\n“What?”\nAs if he had made up his mind, Siwoo held out his hand to me.\nI reflexively grasped what was in Siwoo’s hand.\n…A bracelet?\n“This is…”\nWhat could be Siwoo’s intention in giving me something like this?\nI looked around once.\nPeople were still laughing, chatting, and enjoying this space.\nWhat could be the reason for giving me this kind of item in a place like this?\nCertainly, it’s an item that doesn’t feel out of place when given in a place like this.\nA pretty accessory that looks simple, but the black thread contrasting with the white thread adds a slight elegance.\nAn item with high quality, even to me who has no particular interest in accessories.\nBut there was a slight magical power contained in the thread.\nWhat could this be?\nWhy did he suddenly hand this to me?\n“It’s a bracelet.”\n“…What do you think?”\n“Pardon?”\nSiwoo, looking extremely tense, asked for my impression.\nWhat do I think?\nWhat could he mean by that?\nI couldn’t understand Siwoo’s words at all.\n“Do you like it?”\n“…I do think it’s pretty, but why?”\nI couldn’t even guess what Siwoo wanted to do.\nJudging from the magical power contained in the bracelet, it seems to be no ordinary item.\nCould it be that the Author started plot development without my knowledge, and because of that, Siwoo is fighting a new evil organization?\nBut he had been with me constantly since the Author stopped talking to me.\nI knew Siwoo had been doing something in his room recently, but I didn’t think he could do anything in that short amount of time.\n“…I’m sorry. I really don’t know.”\nSo I decided to be honest.\nWhat on earth could this item be? Why is he giving it to me?\nI couldn’t understand the meaning behind this bracelet at all.\nThen Siwoo, who had been looking at me with a tense expression, sighed as if he was flustered trying to explain something to me.\n“…I guess my explanation was lacking. It’s a gift.”\n“A gift?”\n“Yeah, a gift. I made it myself. What do you think?”\nHe made it himself?\nAt those words, I unconsciously looked at the bracelet again.\nSiwoo made this bracelet?\nCould Siwoo be more skilled with his hands than I thought?\nI fiddled with the bracelet in my hand for no reason.\nI felt a soft texture on my fingertips.\n“Do you want to try it on?”\n“Oh, yes…?”\n“Here, like this.”\nSudden words.\nPerhaps Siwoo was frustrated that I didn’t show much reaction to his words about a handmade gift.\nOr maybe he had planned to do this from the beginning.\nSiwoo approached me and then put the bracelet on my wrist himself.\n“Hmm, it’s pretty. It suits you.”\nI blankly stared at Siwoo’s smiling face, saying he was glad it fit well.\nIt was a completely different story from what I had thought.\nIt wasn’t a secret story about eliminating an evil organization.\nNor a bracelet with a tragic backstory, just an ordinary gift.\n“Why did you give this to me…?”\nI had never seen Siwoo give a gift to anyone.\n“I thought you might have been lonely.”\n“…Pardon?”\n“…Um, well. I figured you’ve been having a hard time when I’m not around, right?”\nScratching his head, Siwoo spoke to me carefully.\nAs if he didn’t want me to get hurt.\nAs if telling me not to misunderstand, Siwoo’s voice was full of consideration.\n“You might misunderstand since I’m giving this to you after you showed that side of yourself… But actually, I’ve been making this for quite a while.”\n“…For a while?”\n“Yeah. I wanted to give it to you as a surprise, so I made it in secret.”\nAh.\nSuddenly, I remembered Siwoo doing something alone in his room.\nSo he was making this.\n“Amelia and Dorothy helped a lot too.”\nHearing Siwoo’s words, I was overwhelmed with self-loathing.\nI thought Siwoo was being seduced by a woman and neglecting his usual training to play around.\nBut that wasn’t it.\nHe was making time here and there to make a gift for me.\nI felt ashamed of myself for asking Lee Ha-Yul to investigate Siwoo.\n“Thank y…”\n“But Arte. I can’t always be by your side.”\n“…Yes. That’s true.”\nAs I was about to express my gratitude, my mood sank at Siwoo’s apologetic voice.\nYeah.\nAs Siwoo said, he can’t be with me forever.\nWhen taking a bath, doing laundry, etc.\nIt’s not just about ordinary daily life.\nIn the end, Siwoo will eventually end up with the heroine.\nThen Siwoo won’t be able to be with me.\nWho would like it if another woman lived in the house and constantly stuck to Siwoo?\n…I have to be apart from Siwoo.\nSomeday, I won’t be able to be with Siwoo.\nEven with Siwoo right in front of me, my mind started to turn white.\nSomeday, I will writhe in loneliness and spend the night curled up alone.\nEven my vision started to turn white.\nI shouldn’t think about it. I shouldn’t think about it.\nI thought I shouldn’t, but I couldn’t stop thinking.\nApart from Siwoo.\nA woman, Amelia or Dorothy, smiling happily next to Siwoo.\nWhat will happen to me when that moment comes?\nIf Siwoo isn’t around me, I…\nIf Siwoo, the only human, isn’t around.\nI couldn’t even imagine what kind of feeling I would have.\n“But I will always be with you.”\n“…Pardon?”\nSiwoo’s voice shattered my imagination in an instant.\nHe said he would always be with me.\n…That’s.\n“That’s impossible.”\n“It’s not impossible.”\n“…Just a moment ago, you said you couldn’t be with me forever.”\nIt was a contradiction.\nSiwoo’s words were full of contradictions.\nSaying he couldn’t be with me forever, but he would always be with me.\nEmpty words.\nJust as I was about to get angry, thinking he was just trying to appease me.\nSiwoo said to me.\n“Yeah. I can’t always be physically with you. But I will be with you.”\n“What do you…”\n“Do you want to try putting some magical power into this?”\n“…Magical power?”\nHe’s telling me to put magical power into it.\nIf it’s something useless, I’ll get very angry.\nWith that in mind, I was surprised by the sensation I felt when I put magical power into the bracelet.\n“This is…”\n“How is it?”\nI felt it.\nWhere Siwoo was.\nBesides being right before my eyes, I was convinced I could tell where he was, even if he was far away.\nI felt as if Siwoo and I were connected by an invisible thread.\n“Even if I’m apart from you, Arte.”\nI blankly stared at the bracelet and gradually distanced myself from Siwoo.\nI felt like I could still clearly know where Siwoo was.\nNo matter how far apart we were.\nNo matter where he was or what he was doing.\nI knew I would have a feeling as if Siwoo and I were connected by an invisible thread.\n“We will always be together.”\nOnly when I looked at Siwoo to ask him how he did this did I realize,\nOn his wrist, there was a bracelet that looked exactly like the one I was wearing.\n“Don’t worry too much, Arte. I will always run to you.”\nI caressed the bracelet Siwoo gave me.\nAlong with the soft texture, a warm feeling spread through my chest.\n“What do you think, Arte?… Do you like the gift?”\n“…”\nAs I blankly caressed the bracelet, I saw Siwoo fidgeting, wondering where his cool appearance from earlier had gone.\nThat appearance.\nI couldn’t help but chuckle.\n“How could I not like it?”\nA warm feeling spread and reached my heart.\nThump, thump.\nWhat could be the emotion expressed by my pounding heart?\n“Thank you for the wonderful gift.”",

It moved!”\n(Really?!)\n(I never thought it would take this long…)\nVoices filled with deep emotion burst out from here and there.\nThey always tease the pure girl to the point of annoyance, but at times like this, their hearts are united.\nThey never imagined it would take this long.\nAffection of a human. Who knew it would take this long for the faint feeling of love to sprout?\n“How long did it take?”\n(If you’re talking about since you put that Reader in, it’s been about 9 months.)\n“Shorter than I thought.”\nShe was sure it had been a very long time.\nTurns out it’s much shorter than expected.\n(It may be short by our standards, but isn’t it quite long by human standards?)\n(Who knows? What’s the point of knowing that?)\n(It’s because you have such little interest that everything you touch gets destroyed.)\n(What was that?!)\nIgnoring the noisy bickering between them, she gazed at the Reader.\nPerhaps it was due to her loudly beating heart,\nIt felt like her vision was shaking a bit.\n“…As expected of the Protagonist.”\nWords of admiration slipped out.\nTo sway the Reader so much with just one gift and a few light conversations.\nThe girl was certain she never included him being good at this when creating the settings.\n“The Reader… doesn’t seem to have noticed yet.”\nIt just had to happen once.\nIf such feelings emerge even once, they will only progress rapidly from then on.\nWhen the Reader’s gaze, amidst being teased relentlessly by Amelia and Dorothy, occasionally turns towards the Protagonist.\nWhen she unconsciously caresses the Protagonist’s gift.\nEach time, her heart beat a little faster.\nEven if she hasn’t noticed, slowly. But surely.\nFeelings were sprouting.\n“It’s a shame to cut it off there…”\nBut it might be for the best.\nThe Reader doesn’t handle sudden changes well.\nWaiting until the Reader becomes aware of those feelings on their own is probably ideal.\n‘If, in that situation, if I had gotten carried away by momentum and made her confess…’\n“Hey, you guys. What do you think would’ve happened if she confessed as well?”\n(She would’ve been rejected.)\n(Thank you for your feelings, but I’m sorry. Something like that probably would’ve been said.)\n“I thought so too.”\nIt’s regrettable from the perspective of wanting the two to get together, but it’s an unavoidable reality.\nGiven the Reader’s circumstances, it will be difficult for her to accept it easily.\nStill, she couldn’t help but look at the Reader sadly, feeling the unavoidable disappointment.\nShe can’t help but think that it’s tantalizing. She wants to make a bit more progress.\nA soft sigh of disappointment escaped, but even so, she smiled brightly, feeling good.\nDisappointment is disappointment, but just a little.\nIt seemed like just a little more of a push would be fine.\nShe felt good that her efforts to push Arte to rely on Siwoo instead seemed to be paying off.\n(Hey, does it still not work on him?)\n“Hm? What doesn’t?”\n(Your ability. It still doesn’t work on the Protagonist?)\n“It doesn’t work at all, why?”\n(What will you do if a variable appears…)\nA variable?\n“There’s no way something like that will happen.”\nThe girl smiled brightly.\nThere’s no way a variable will appear.\nThe Protagonist’s ability is intuition.\nOf course, she did include a setting that it will become an incredible ability once it finishes growing…\n“Do you think he’ll become a threat to us?”\n(…True. Yeah, sorry.)\nSince a mere mortal can’t threaten them.\nSo, there was no need to worry about such trivial issues.\n***\n“…Grrr.”\n“Hehe.”\nThe hooded girl laughed brightly.\nAs if finding the dog in front of her adorable.\nIf one doesn’t mind appearances, one might think it’s a moment of bonding between a girl and an animal.\nIgnoring the fact that it’s a girl covered in something grotesque and a dog the size of a five-ton truck.\n“You’re strong, aren’t you!”\n“Grrr…”\n“Yes, yes. I know. It’s hard because humans keep barging into your home?”\nThe hooded girl spoke to the monster.\nDespite the impossibility of humans and monsters conversing with each other.\nThe girl, whose words and actions seemed to differentiate herself from humans, stroked its side.\nYet the monster did not attack the girl.\nEven though they always have an instinctive aversion to humans.\nDespite all attempts to domesticate them ending in failure.\nThe girl showed that it was possible.\n“It must have been tough. Right?”\n“…Grrr.”\n“If I hadn’t happened to pass by, it could’ve been dangerous. Don’t worry. You’re safe now.”\nAhaha.\nAhahaha.\nThe girl laughed like a madwoman.\n“…Stop laughing and state your purpose.”\n“Ah, right. Sorry Mir.”\n“It’s fine. Now, this child is waiting.”\n“Yes…Say, won’t you help me?”\n“Grrr.”\n“Hm? You’re asking if this will benefit you? I’m not sure about that, but if this goes well, humans won’t be able to come to your home.”\n“Grrr!”\n“…Really? You’ll help?! Thank you!”\nThe girl laughed and chattered alone.\nAs if able to converse with each other despite the impossibility of humans talking to monsters.\n“…”\nThe man had been hiding and observing that scene all along.\nNo, perhaps saying he was hiding isn’t quite accurate.\nHe was dying right now.\n“…You have a lot of friends too? Humans keep coming to find you so it’s hard? Don’t worry! I’ll help you!”\nA perfectly ordinary day of setting out to kill monsters.\nHe had a bit more trouble than expected, but he was about to finish off the monster and return to base without issue.\n…Until that crazy bitch suddenly appeared from behind and instantly slaughtered his comrades.\nIt happened in an instant, so no one could react.\nHe had barely noticed it and managed to avoid instant death by twisting his body.\nHis comrades showed no signs of opening their eyes.\nThey probably died instantly.\nHe already thought he was done for too.\nBlood kept seeping from his stomach, and it was getting harder to think.\n“HQ. HQ, respond…”\nHe was always prepared to die.\nThe battlefield where we put their lives on the line. Those who live in such a place and aren’t prepared for death don’t last long.\nSo there’s only one thing he fears.\nNot being able to report this situation to the rest.\nNot being able to convey this situation.\n“HQ. This is Team 2. Respond… Quickly.”\n-Bzzt, bzzt… What’s going on? Didn’t you just say you were returning?\n“…!”\nThank goodness. It connected.\nHe can convey this situation!\n“Abnormal situation occurred. A girl roughly 150cm tall, wearing a hood, launched a surprise attack from behind. Team 2 has been annihilated. The girl is…”\n-Wha, what…? Annihilated? What the hell is that…\n“Hey, what are you doing there?”\nAh.\nAt that moment, he felt death approaching.\n“I asked what you’re doing?”\nIf he had stayed still, there might have been a chance of surviving.\nBut, even a little.\nHe had to convey even a little more information.\nBecause that was what he had to do for her fallen comrades.\n“The girl seems to be able to communicate with monsters! Her body has numerous grotesque things…!”\nThump.\n-…What was that sound just now? Hey, answer me. Are you still alive? Answer!\nThat was the end.\nThe final piece of information and last words that a dying superhuman conveyed with his life on the line.\n“Calling my companions grotesque, that’s rude of you. How impolite.”\nCrunch, crunch.\nThe girl stomped on the radio in irritation.\nIt was a sturdy radio designed to last a long time even in harsh environments, but under the girl’s kicks, it shattered into pieces and became unusable.\n“Hey, doggy. Let’s just eat a little of that and run away quickly. I think we need to move locations.”\n“…Grrr.”\n“I got caught because I carelessly said this and that. I thought he was dead.”\nShortly after.\nWhat the hastily dispatched rescue team found were the members of Team 2, discovered in a horrific state.\n***\n(Hehe, Reader-nim. I’m here~)\n“…?”\nIs this an auditory hallucination?\nI heard a voice I thought I would never hear again, so I looked around.\nSiwoo went to wash up, so there’s no one here. What the hell?\n(Reader-nim…? I’m here. Is this on…Reader-nim?)\n“Hah, boring.”\nI randomly changed the TV channel, but nothing changed.\nI wonder when Siwoo will come.\nBeing apart even for a short while is hard to endure.\n“…”\nWhen I unconsciously thought I felt lonely, I stroked the bracelet.\nA warm heat spread and the bracelet let me know I wasn’t alone.\n“…Hehe.”\nHow many times have I laughed absently while gazing at the bracelet?\nDorothy and Amelia teased me a lot because of this, but I couldn’t stop.\nI mean, I can’t help it if watching makes me smile, you know?\n“When will he come…”\nNot having Siwoo by my side made me anxious, but I wasn’t worried anymore.\nBecause he said he would eventually come to help me.\nSo no matter how hard it gets, I wasn’t anxious anymore.\n(Uwaaaaaah…! Reader-nim…! Don’t ignore me!)\n“…Oh my, you surprised me. It was real.”\n(Uwaaaaaah!)\nI thought it was an auditory hallucination, but it was really the Author.\nThat startled me.\n…I already missed the time without her.\nMy head started to hurt from the loud voice.",

      "content": "Swish, swish.\nThe sound of a blade being sharpened on a whetstone echoed.\nShould Ha-Yul call it a drawback of the basement?\nBecause the sound reverberated, even this small noise sounded loud.\n“It’s quite noisy after all. Right?”\nNo response came, but he didn’t mind.\nIt wasn’t a question he asked expecting an answer.\nThe other person was not in a state to answer anyway.\n“Using the basement to make this room was good, but it’s more inconvenient than I thought. The sound echoes, and mold grows easily. The smell doesn’t dissipate well either, and it’s too damp.”\n‘…Is this enough?’\nHe stopped sharpening the blade and picked up another knife.\nHe didn’t bother checking if it was properly sharpened.\nBecause he didn’t know much about knives. Even if he looked to see if it was properly sharpened, he wouldn’t know.\nSome may question why he was doing such a useless action then.\nBut it wasn’t useless.\nHe could leisurely pass the time while doing something important.\n“But even if the basement is extremely inconvenient, I think it was a good idea to ask Arte and get it after all. Right?”\nAgain, no answer came back.\nHe could push further here…\nBut he decided to just scare the man this much for today.\nIf the fear became too great, they might faint.\nIt was his own know-how learned after experiencing it many times.\n“It’s the perfect place to dispose of garbage like you.”\nClank, clank.\nThe man, whose whole body was restrained to the chair, struggled this way and that in an attempt to escape from here out of fear.\nBut escape was impossible.\nThe chair was made of high-strength metal and is used in prisons to hold superhuman criminals.\nThat level of strength wouldn’t make it budge.\nEven though the prisoner knew that from trying several times, he instinctively tried to escape again, but realizing he still couldn’t move, fear settled in the prisoner’s eyes.\n“You’ve got a lot of energy. Do you still have enough vitality?”\nThat’s what the time was for. The echoing sound of sharpening the whetstone was all to induce fear in the other person.\nEverything else was secondary.\nIt seemed to be a more effective method than he thought, which made him feel good.\nShould he try using it on the next person too?\nBut his good mood was only momentary.\nWith the sound of dripping, his elated mood instantly sank.\n“…How filthy. Who allowed you to do that?”\nHe was sure he only gave the prisoner enough water to avoid dehydration.\nIrritation surged, and he roughly grabbed the kitchen knife.\nWhen he gently brought it to the man’s neck, blood dripped.\nThe prisoner’s eyes were engulfed in terror.\n…There was no need to be that scared.\nHe wasn’t planning to kill the prisoner right away.\nAt least for now, what he was worried about wouldn’t happen.\nHe really wanted to stab the prisoner’s neck right now, but compared to their sins committed, just dying would be too luxurious.\nIt would be better for the prisoner to live in fear of his approaching death every moment, to suffer in pain every moment.\n“I was going to let you off with one today… Fine. I believe you can endure about two.”\n“Mmph, mmph…! Mmph!”\nSo noisy.\nOn top of splattering filth in a place that was already hard to clean.\nHe wanted to kill the prisoner right this instant, but then he wouldn’t be able to make him atone more for his sins.\nSo he couldn’t kill him yet.\n…But in exchange, this bastard would have a harsh day today.\n“Reflect on your sins until evening. If I see signs of remorse, I’ll reduce it to one, so stay quiet, got it?”\nHe repositioned the pliers on the desk so the bound prisoner could see them well.\nHe instantly became quiet.\nRight, he had already experienced this pain, so he knew how it felt.\nThe prisoner knew well what would happen if he went against his mood right now.\nHe lied about reducing it, though.\n“I knew you’d be here.”\n“Ah, Lyla. What’s up? I thought you hated coming here.”\n“How many people would want to come to a place like this.”\nHe didn’t refute her words as she made a disgusted expression.\nHe knew that few people would want to come to such a repulsive space.\n“…Are those teeth?”\n“That’s right. Quite a lot has been collected.”\n“You usually threw away byproducts like that.”\n“I did. But… I’m trying something different this time.”\n“…Different?”\n“Yeah.”\nIt was nothing much.\nThis white thing was that guy’s lifeline.\nLike the last leaf.\nIf it all disappeared… Well, he didn’t need to say the rest.\n“… Isn’t your hobby too bad?”\n“…”\n“I know, I know. I wasn’t going to say anything.”\n“So, why did you call me?”\n“Ah, right.”\nIt seemed like a long time would pass if they talked more, so he asked the purpose of her coming here.\n“A strange note arrived. I was wondering if you might know who it’s from.”\n“…A note?”\n“The sender and recipient names are weird. Full of numbers.”\n…Full of numbers.\nHe thought it would be a light conversation like what she wanted for dinner tonight.\nHe straightened his posture and asked Lyla for the letter.\n“Let me see.”\n“Ah, okay. Here.”\n“…As I thought.”\n“Who is it?”\nThe sender’s name was a combination of numbers. But it matched his expectations.\nA strange combination of numbers to someone who doesn’t know.\nBut official documents from the Association were usually like this.\nAlways fighting villains, not knowing which ability user might become a villain, it was a set method.\nSo, it was easy for someone who didn’t know to think it was a misprinted item.\nLyla probably already opened the contents.\nThere were traces of the contents that should be closed being slightly open.\nBut she probably brought it because she couldn’t read the contents either.\nHe was the only one here who would receive such a thing.\n“It’s from the Association. Let’s see, the contents are…”\n“…? What is it? What does it say that you’re getting so serious?”\n“Where did Arte go?”\n“Huh? Probably at Siwoo’s house. She always stays there these days.”\n“Quickly bring Spira and come there. I’ll go ahead and talk to her first.”\n“What? Wa, wait! What’s going on?! And you want me to bring her?!”\n“There’s no time to explain, so I’m going first.”\nHe began moving at maximum speed, repeatedly transforming into mist and back.\nIt wasn’t an ordinary matter for the Association to send an extermination request.\nEspecially for Arachne, who played an important role in maintaining public order in the city.\n“…Is this really true?”\nHe was heading to Arte to get help as quickly as possible…\nBut he stopped momentarily at the unbelievable story and read the official document again.\nHowever, nothing changed.\nHe read it again, thinking he might have been mistaken, but the document still remained as if it were true.\n“A human who communicates with monsters.”\nThere were performances of capturing them in front of citizens and killing them. Still, there had never been a successful case of truly communicating with them.\nHe was skeptical, but that’s why he decided to increase his speed and head to Arte again.\nBecause it would be even more dangerous if it really was a human who communicates with demons.\nIt was hard to imagine how big the situation could grow if such a human was a villain.\n***\n“Wake up, Spira! I said wake up quickly!”\n“… I’m sleepy though.”\n“It’s an emergency! I told you to move quickly?!”\nLyla tapped her feet in frustration.\nThere were occasional times before when Spira would show laziness, lying still and acting like she didn’t want to move, but it wasn’t this bad.\nSprawling around like a sloth like this started after Arte began staying elsewhere.\nAfter she disappeared, Spira started lying down openly, saying no one was watching, and this was the result.\n“Why. I finished all the work.”\n“Not that! We need to go out right now!”\n“It’s bothersome…”\nEven more annoying was that Spira had done all her work and was just playing around.\nIt wasn’t the first or second time Lyla had been annoyed by her leisurely resting while working beside her. Still, she had no choice but to leave her alone since Spira finished her portion.\nBut there was a limit to being lenient like that.\nNow was the time to move immediately.\nLyla didn’t know the reason, but there must be a reason Ha-Yul moved so urgently and told her to bring Spira.\nShe was starting to get anxious about wasting time like this.\nIrritation surged, and Lyla scratched her head furiously as she shouted.\n“…I have no choice. I’ll buy you the game console you wanted, so get up quickly! It’s urgent!”\n“Really?! I’m ready!”\n“This brat…”\nCould it be that Spira planned this?\nSpira, who finished preparing to go out with sparkling eyes when Lyla mentioned buying the game console she always wanted, was detestable to the point she wondered.\nWas Spira sulking because she ignored her, always pestering her to buy her things, saying she couldn’t go out because of her lower body?\n“Hah… Okay, fine. I’ll buy it so let’s go quickly. The one having a hard time isn’t you. It’s me.”\n“I have quite a hard time too? Do you know how hard it is to be packed in a box?!”\n“Think about my position carrying it too! You pig!”\n“A pig?! I’m a snake! I’m not that heavy either! Roughly…only about 200kg! Plus, you’re a superhuman!”\n“Not 200kg, more like 230kg, you brat! That’s the weight of about 6-7 skinny women!”\n“Kyaa, kyaaah?! How do you…since when! Do, don’t tell anyone that. Got it?!”\n“Enough, so hurry up and get in the box.”\n“You, you won’t tell, right? Really?”\n“I won’t, so get in!”\nLyla sighed, feeling a headache coming on.\nTo think this brat was a former executive of the Übermensch, a current member of Arachne.\nLyla remembered the comments of citizens who had fantasies about Arachne members and laughed hollowly.\nWhat would they think if they saw this sight?\nIt was absurd.",

      "content": "An ordinary evening like any other.\nThe sounds coming from the kitchen tickled Siwoo’s ears.\nAfter a short time, a delicious smell entered through my nose.\nChicken, perhaps.\nJudging by the smell of oil and the frying sound, it must be fried chicken or a similar dish.\nArte turned out to like meat dishes much more than he expected.\nSometimes, when he hands her vegetables and tells her to eat them, she makes a face, hesitating whether to do so, which is kind of cute.\nShe ends up eating them in the end though.\n…No, that’s not what’s important.\nSiwoo continued his pondering with a serious expression.\nHe thought he had successfully delivered the gift.\nHe was sure he had successfully given the gift.\nHe was certain it had succeeded based on her expression, the trembling of her voice, her eyes, and various other information.\nCould something have gone wrong?\n“Time to eat!”\n“Ah, okay. I’m coming.”\nLost in thought, Siwoo put down his sword and wiped his sweat with a towel.\nArte no longer takes his clothes. This is perhaps the biggest change that can be called such.\nAfter responding appropriately to Arte’s question about today’s progress, Siwoo sat at the dining table.\nFried chicken after all, huh.\nIt’ll be hard to clean up, will it be okay?\nWhen he looked at Arte with worried eyes, she just smiled brightly.\nIt’s not something for me to worry about. She’ll handle it well on her own.\n“Looks delicious today too.”\n“Right? You worked hard, so eat a lot.”\n…No, this isn’t it.\nHe unconsciously started eating with Arte as usual.\nOf course, the food she makes is delicious, the house has become a bit tidier than before, and now the restriction of Arte having to stick by me at ten-minute intervals is gone.\nBased on their experiment, it’s clear there are no issues, even if they’re apart all day.\nBut why.\nWhy is Arte still staying here?\nThat was his question.\n… Isn’t it about time she goes back?\nHe’s really struggling here.\nBut he couldn’t show that to Arte either.\nHow could he bring up such a thing to the person he likes?\n‘…Alright. I’ll definitely say it today.’\nSiwoo made up his mind.\nOf course, this current life wasn’t bad either.\nBecause spending everyday life with Arte was more enjoyable than he had thought.\nBut it was too much now.\nSiwoo’s self-control was now screaming at its limit.\n“What would you like for dinner tomorrow? Chicken? Pork? Beef?”\n“…Arte.”\n“Yes?”\n“This is just in case, but I’m wondering. Has your separation anxiety not gotten better?”\n“It has? Thanks to the bracelet, I’m doing well. I’m sorry if I caused you any inconvenience.”\nSiwoo barely suppressed his expression from crumbling at the sight of Arte smiling brightly as she held up her bracelet.\nRight, it’s gotten better. That’s a relief.\nThe bracelet was meant for that purpose, so he was glad she was using it well.\n“…But then why are you still here?”\n“Pardon?”\nBut even so, Siwoo finally drove the point home.\nWhy was Arte still here?\nThat’s what he was curious about.\n“I mean, well. If it’s improved, you can slowly go back ho…me…”\nAnd Siwoo soon realized.\nThat he had made a mistake.\n“Di, did I do something wrong…?”\n“No, that’s not it.”\n“If there’s something I did wrong, I-I’ll apologize, so…!”\nArte’s separation anxiety had not improved long ago.\nHe knew that.\nHe thought she had gotten better thanks to the bracelet.\nBut it seems his thoughts were wrong.\nDid she take my words to mean he wanted her out of this house?\nArte began pleading with him.\n“You didn’t do anything wrong, Arte. Calm down.”\n“If I didn’t do anything wrong, does that mean I’m useless…?”\n“That’s not it. Calm down.”\nHe grabbed his aching head.\nDid he really have to say this?\nIs it really right to say it?\nHe pondered for a while, but the answer was already set.\nIf he didn’t say what was bothering him, she would never understand.\n“Well, you see…”\nHe really didn’t want to say it.\nWhat kind of face will she look at me with if I say this?\nBut the option to not say it no longer existed.\n“…Listen, Arte. You know I’m a man, right?”\n“Huh? …Of course?”\n“You’re a woman.”\n“Yes.”\nHe tightly shut his eyes at the sight of Arte looking at him as if asking what the problem with that is.\nIf she can’t understand even after he’s talked around it this much, there’s no helping it.\nI’ll have to say it directly.\n“It’s a bit hard for me to stick together like this every day.”\n“…Hard, you say?”\n“I’m a man too. I have sexual desires.”\nA moment of silence followed.\nThe anxiety of having said something he shouldn’t have to her and the anticipation that she might finally understand me a little were mixed together.\nHow will she react?\nHe opened his eyes slightly and looked at Arte.\nArte’s face was dyed a deep red.\n“Wh, what do you.”\n“Sleeping in the same room every day, always being together, it’s hard for me to endure too.”\nSiwoo felt he could no longer hold back.\nNow that he had said it, he decided to vent all his complaints so far.\n“I couldn’t say it until now because I was afraid you’d be anxious, but you need to be more careful.”\n“B, but. Siwoo isn’t the type to…”\n“It’s the same even if I don’t intend to do anything. You’re too careless. Especially those clothes.”\n“Huh? Cl, clothes?”\nArte looked over her outfit as if wondering what was wrong with it, then frowned as if it was unfair.\nDid she not even understand what kind of outfit she was wearing?\nThinking it might be right to say it now clearly, I decided to take this opportunity to make it clear.\n“It’s better to wear underwear even at home, Arte.”\n“Pa, pardon…?”\n“Have you never looked in the mirror?”\nHe had never seen Arte doing things like putting on makeup.\nShe was always with him, even normally.\nShe probably didn’t have the chance to look in a mirror or such at home.\nHe wanted to say this a month ago, around when Arte started clinging to him.\nThe longer the time passed, the more likely she was to get angry and ask why he had never said anything.\nSighing, he brought Arte to the mirror, and as expected, her face began turning even redder.\nPerhaps her face felt hot. She kept cooling her face with her hands.\n“Wh, wh, why…!”\n“Why didn’t I say anything? Arte, think about it. Could I have said such a thing to you a few days ago?”\n“…Urk!”\nThere’s no way he could have.\nTelling someone who depended on him so much to be more careful with her appearance?\nThat it’s hard for him to endure because he’s a man?\nNo one can guarantee what would happen if Arte, who only trusted him, could not do so.\nAs if realizing that fact, she could only blush without saying anything.\n“No matter how comfortable our house is, your clothes are too short. To begin with…”\nNow that it’s come to this, he tried to tell Arte this and that.\nShe’s too defenseless. Isn’t she acting too comfortably at home for someone who’s not even a man?\nEven if it’s someone she trusts, she needs to have some caution.\nHe was going to say something like that, but.\n“I, I, I’m so sorry…!”\nArte instantly ran away to the laundry room.\n“Hah…”\nBut he decided not to chase after her.\nHe didn’t even want to imagine what would happen if he pushed Arte further.\n“But this should make it a bit better…”\nToo much is worse than too little, as they say.\nIf he had only seen it occasionally, he might have dismissed it as eye candy. However, experiencing it daily was a different story.\nEspecially since he lost any way to relieve it.\nHe hopes Arte doesn’t take it badly.\nHe looked at the laundry room where she was hiding with worried eyes.\n“…But it’s a bit of a shame.”\nPonytail with dolphin shorts.\nIt was exactly his type.\n***\n“Ugh, hic, uwaaah…”\nI feel like I’m going crazy.\nJust what have I been doing for this past month?\nI felt the urge to grab something and hit it hard.\n[…You really didn’t know.]\n“Uwaaaah…”\nI recalled the image I just saw in the mirror.\nThe white shirt I was wearing was slightly see-through…that, that.\nKyaaaaaaah…!\nI picked up the blanket hung in the laundry room.\nUnable to hit it for fear it might rip if I used force, I hugged the still-damp blanket and rolled around on the floor.\nI didn’t even think about the blanket getting covered in dust.\nI just wanted to relieve this feeling even a little.\n“I’m crazy, I’m crazy, I’m crazy, I’m crazy…!”\nAh.\nMy habit from before coming to this world.\nThe habit of wearing comfortable clothes and lounging around at home.\nBecause no one said anything about it back then. So I let my guard down.\nSiwoo didn’t say much either, so I didn’t even notice.\nTo think I looked like that.\n“Aaaaah… What do I do…”\nWell, Siwoo might ask why he can’t be a bit apart.\nI know very well since I used to be a man too.\nOf course, those kinds of feelings would arise if a woman in this state stayed nearby defenseless.\nPlus, though it’s embarrassing to say it myself, I’m pretty enough to rival the heroines.\n“To think I stuck by him for over a month looking like this…”\nEven when sleeping.\nIn a state where I couldn’t even be apart from him for more than ten minutes.\nThis is, this is just…\n“I’m seducing him, aren’t I…”\nHow did Siwoo even endure for a month?\nI don’t think I could have lasted even two days.\nI felt admiration for him, but at the same time, I felt resentful.\nTell me sooner…!\nBut I also understood Siwoo’s words that he couldn’t say it back then, seeing me fall into anxiety.\nIf I had realized back then that I was doing something close to seducing Siwoo.\nThen what actions would I have taken?\nI didn’t know.\nNo, I didn’t want to think about it.\nI just wanted to erase this situation from my mind.\n[Reader-nim…?]\n“Uwaaaaaah…!”\nI rolled around hugging the blanket like that for a while.\n… It’s damp.",

      "content": "“…I want to die.”\nI’ve been saying this a lot these days.\nIt’s not a good thing to say out loud so often, and it’s not that I really want to die, but…\nEven if it’s a bit of an exaggeration, I felt like I couldn’t endure if I didn’t say things like this.\nJust what have I done?\nMy head started hurting at the sight before my eyes.\n“It’s okay. It happens.”\n“…Please, don’t raise your head.”\n“Ah… Sorry.”\nSiwoo, who had been looking down, raised his head to comfort me but quickly lowered it again at my request.\n“…Ugh.”\nMy face, reddened with embarrassment, showed no signs of improving.\nI just cursed inwardly, afraid that making another scene would only increase the work.\nBecause the result of rolling around while hugging the not yet fully dried blanket was right in front of my eyes.\nThe floor was slippery due to the moisture, and the white blanket that had been washed not long ago was once again dirty, covered in dust.\nAnd finally, what should be called the most important reason my face is red.\n…My clothes are damp from the water.\nJust yesterday, I would have walked around confidently asking what the problem with this is.\nBut now, I was trying my best to somehow cover the exposed parts with both hands.\nDid Siwoo see? …He probably did, right?\nThe shame of having shown an embarrassing sight triggered shame. How ironic.\nIf Siwoo just raised his head, he would be faced with my crop top, which was soaked through, revealing everything inside.\nThis is driving me crazy. My flushed face shows no sign of cooling down.\nIf someone looked at my face right now, wouldn’t it be the color of a bright red persimmon?\nAfter calming down a bit, this atmosphere was hard to endure.\nThe silence that naturally followed felt like it was reprimanding me.\nJust what should I say to escape this awkward atmosphere?\nWhile I was pondering for a while, my cell phone started ringing.\nThe caller was… Ha-Yul.\nI quickly answered the call.\n“Hello.”\n– Arte. It’s me. I have an urgent matter to discuss. Can I see you for a moment?\n“…Yes. What a coincidence.”\nPerfect timing, Ha-Yul.\nI unconsciously smiled at his beautiful timing.\nGood. I found a way to escape this awkward atmosphere.\n“Um, ahem. I’m sorry, but something urgent came up. I’ll be back in a bi–”\n“I’ll go too.”\n“Huh, huh? No, it’s some–”\n“That’s related to Arachne, right? It’s dangerous. I want to hear it too.”\n“No, well…”\nHow did he hear? We are quite far apart.\nThat thought soon changed to the realization that I had made a mistake.\nI don’t know why, but Siwoo’s senses are sharper than others.\nIt’s probably due to the influence of his Intuition.\nLost in the thought of escaping this situation, I unconsciously answered the call too close to him.\nWithout considering that Siwoo would be able to hear it from a distance.\nAnd if Siwoo hears this news, there’s no way he’ll stay still.\nSiwoo, it might sound a bit strange to say this, but…\nHe seems to cherish me a lot.\n…I felt a bit embarrassed realizing I had such a conceited thought.\nAnyway, this has nothing to do with Siwoo so I should refuse…\n[I strongly object! A secret organization is a secret organization! The secret only we know, outsiders can’t…!]\n“Alright. I don’t mind.”\n[Reader-nim?!]\nAh, oops.\nHearing the voice, I unconsciously acted the opposite.\n… It’ll be fine. Siwoo is showing his affection like that too.\n[Reader-nim, are you upset…?]\nAs if I’d be upset.\nI’m not the type to get upset, so there was no need to get angry over something like that.\nEven if I heard that he deliberately didn’t talk to me so I wouldn’t get angry and waited until my anger subsided, I wasn’t upset at all.\n[Reader-nim, please say something. I was wrong…]\nSo this isn’t being angry.\nIt’s just because it’s what Siwoo wants.\nSince most of it has already been revealed anyway, I thought it wasn’t a big deal, even if a bit more gets revealed.\nThat’s why I thought it would be okay even if Siwoo heard.\nAbsolutely, definitely.\nIt’s not that I’m taking petty revenge to make you experience the feeling of anxiety I had when you didn’t talk to me.\nNo, it’s not.\n“Thanks, Arte. For trusting me.”\n“… It’s nothing much.”\nSee?\nI even got Siwoo’s thanks and increased trust. How nice.\nThe Author is definitely a ditz. I don’t need to listen to what she says.\n[Re, reader-nim…! I’m sorry!]\nLightly ignoring her words, I decided to go into the room Siwoo lent me to change clothes.\nI can’t meet Ha-Yul looking like this, after all.\n***\n“…Teacher?”\n“Hello, Siwoo. I’ll intrude for a bi…”\n“Were you also part of Arachne?”\n“Pardon?”\nAh.\nCome to think of it, Siwoo would have thought Ha-Yul was just a former investigator who came as a teacher. I didn’t consider that.\nLooking at me, Ha-Yul had a clearly flustered expression anyone could see.\nHe soon realized that was an answer and tried to calm down somehow…\nBut it was too late.\nRealizing that fact, Ha-Yul sighed.\n“…How did you know?”\n“Arte said an Arachne member was coming.”\n“…? Huh?”\n“I thought it would be necessary.”\nArachne is a secret organization. Moreover, the matter we’re about to discuss is important.\nYou called it an urgent matter, but there’s an outsider present.\nIt wouldn’t be strange for Ha-Yul to object.\nBut I didn’t think he would object, and that expectation wasn’t wrong.\nHe sighed softly and handed me a paper with something written on it.\n“…If it’s Arte’s judgment, it should be fine. Here, it’s an official document from the Association. This is why I came to see you today.”\nAn official document from the Association?\nI looked at the paper upon hearing her words.\n… It’s too bubbly to be an official document.\nAren’t these usually printed?\nWhen I asked that question, a refreshing answer came back.\n“I wrote it.”\n“…Ah, yes.”\nHe has a cold impression, so I thought his handwriting would be stiff, too.\nHis handwriting is cuter than I expected.\nThinking that, I read through the document.\n“…What is this.”\n“What is it?”\n“It would be faster if you read it yourself.”\nUnable to explain it, I handed it to Siwoo, telling him to read it.\nDid the Author do something again?\nIt had a strange story that didn’t align with the common sense I had learned after coming here.\n“…A villain who can communicate with monsters annihilated a pioneer unit under the Association?”\nCommunicating with monsters.\nThere’s no way that’s possible. At least based on the common sense I learned here.\n“Thank you, Ha-Yul. I want to think for a bit. Could you give us the room?”\n“…Understood.”\nAfter Ha-Yul nodded and left the room.\nI immediately spoke to the air.\nHa-Yul aside, Siwoo already knows most of it anyway.\nThere was no reason to hide it from Siwoo, either.\n“Did you do this, Author-nim?”\n[Gasp, finally! Are you not upset anymore?!]\n“Never mind that. Answer the question.”\nThe Author had roughly shoved in a setting before.\nWhat was it? If you entered the academy, there should be a scene of taking a test in a dungeon.\nWith that kind of logic, she forcibly added a setting that mana actually appeared about 500 years ago.\nAround 500 years ago, the world naturally changed from a world like a raid novel with hunters and dungeons rampant to the current world.\nThat’s why the world naturally changed too.\nHumans and monsters can’t communicate with each other.\nMonsters from dungeons.\nThey instinctively harbor hostility towards humans. So forget about conversation, there’s no way they can bond.\nThat’s the common sense here. That’s the setting of this world.\nOr so it should be.\n[No. I didn’t touch anything.]\n“…No way.”\n[It’s true… I haven’t even thought about the content for the final exam yet…]\nHowever, the Author denied crafting it.\nWhile she was a fool, she wasn’t a liar.\nThen, could it be that the story progressed in a way even she didn’t expect?\n[This looks interesting, so it might be fine too!]\n“Hah…”\nI was convinced by the Author’s innocent voice.\nShe really doesn’t know anything.\nIt seems something happened as the changed world flowed on its own.\nShe doesn’t handle every event in the world, so things like this happen too.\n“That Author… did it?”\n“No. It’s not her.”\n“…”\nI shook my head at Siwoo, who was looking at me seriously.\nThis isn’t an incident the Author created.\nBut she often acts on her own whims and has a childish side.\nSo, if it looks interesting, she’ll try to make it the main story.\n[But it looks fun! A villain who communicates with monsters, a threatened world…!]\nSee?\nI have a rough idea of how she’ll tell the story.\nWell, how about living on the front lines for a few months instead of the final exam? She’ll say something like that.\n[The front lines! It’s time to try something new, having fallen into filler these days! Leave the academy and throw yourself into the battlefield!]\n… There’s nothing unexpected.\nI held my forehead, feeling like I could see the hardships ahead.",

      "content": "What could be the Author’s purpose?\nThat was easy to figure out if I thought about the Author’s words I’ve heard so far.\nFun.\nAll the events that have taken place so far were for that purpose. There was no reason beyond that.\nChanging Lyla’s setting, unleashing a bunch of villains, and implanting memories of an old friend in Ha-Yul.\nReleasing monsters, creating a secret room, and even including an event from about 500 years ago.\nIt was all for fun.\nSince most of the incidents have happened at the Author’s hands, I had no idea what could happen in this one.\nAn incident untouched by her hands.\nRather, she seemed even more delighted because she didn’t plan it.\nTo the point of starting to tell me that it might be nice to go outside the academy and briefly solve it.\nSo perhaps this situation before my eyes was inevitable.\nBecause they were heroines. Because they were good characters.\nUpon hearing we were heading to a dangerous place, friends rushing to stop us was perhaps a natural occurrence.\nAnd upon realizing that it was impossible, asking to take them along too.\n“Take me too.”\n“Me too.”\n“…Hah.”\nDorothy and Amelia, with determined expressions, were blocking us.\nDespite having already told them no several times.\n“You know the front lines are very dangerous, right? Students can’t go.”\n“Then what about you and Siwoo? You’re both students too.”\n“We have experience hunting monsters, so…”\n“It’s been well over half a year already. Dorothy and I have experience defeating villains. Quite a lot, in fact. Our practical experience hasn’t rusted yet.”\n“That’s right! Take us too!”\n… It’s no use. They have no intention of listening.\nThis is all because of Siwoo. He just had to mention going to the front lines.\nThey won’t listen even when I mention our monster hunting experience, saying it would have rusted since it’s been half a year.\nMy head started hurting, so I looked at Siwoo, but he avoided eye contact upon noticing my gaze.\nRight, he knows he did wrong too.\nUnder my gaze demanding his responsibility, Siwoo blurted out an excuse.\n“…But they’re friends. I thought we should tell them. I didn’t know it would turn out like this.”\n“That may be true, but…”\nSiwoo’s thoughts weren’t wrong either.\nBut it’s such a pain if they object this much.\nIt’s even more of a pain because they’re not just opposing.\nBecause I don’t really have any words to make excuses.\nIt’s a bit awkward to say I will help because the Association asked for it.\nThe front lines are a dangerous place.\nA place where vicious criminals are sent to die like bullet sponges.\nA place where the battle lines don’t easily advance despite heroes of unimaginable strength lying around.\nThat was the public perception.\nIt was a fact that could be easily understood just by looking at the gazes of the extra students around.\nWhile thinking they too will go there someday, they sufficiently understood that it’s an extremely dangerous place.\nThat’s why their gazes held pity. A gaze of sympathy, thinking isn’t it too early to go?\nThinking it was about time someone did something, I looked at Ha-Yul.\nBecause he had the position of a teacher.\nHe at least had a justification to convince them.\n“… I’m sorry, but you can’t go.”\n“Why!”\n“I’ve been explaining…”\nHa-Yul’s voice, trying to stop the two upon feeling my gaze, was filled with a sense of unfairness.\nBecause he realized that they hadn’t listened to a single explanation despite him working hard to explain until now.\n…For someone with such a cold impression, he’s surprisingly rich in emotions.\nWell, that’s probably why he came to hate villains, talking about his friend’s revenge and all.\n“As I said, you don’t apply for the front lines. It’s assigned by the Association.”\nBut his gloominess was short-lived. Perhaps Ha-Yul had gotten used to the teaching profession?\nHe began explaining again, having become a teacher who diligently answered students’ questions.\n“I can’t explain in detail, but an unfortunate incident occurred recently. It’s embarrassing, but we decided to receive help from students.”\n“…Why is that?”\n“You guys really didn’t hear anything, huh. I’m really shocked…”\nHa-Yul’s voice trembled a little.\nHe seemed shocked to hear that they didn’t listen to a single one of his explanations.\n“Abilities like intuition are really rare. Because you can detect something without any information. That’s why the front lines requested help.”\n“But Siwoo is a student!”\n“We’re ashamed of it too. But there was no coercion, and it’s not a long-term stay. He’ll return before winter break starts.”\n“…Then what about Arte?”\n“She’s… The strongest among the students has the monster-hunting experience and can dominate an area by laying threads around. Furthermore you are her friends. She will be at ease if you are safe as well. Do you understand now?”\nHa-Yul, who finished his explanation calmly, smiled as if feeling proud.\nPerhaps he thought they wouldn’t be able to refute anymore.\nHe’s completely used to being a teacher now. He’s changed a lot.\nPerhaps he had the talent of an educator from the beginning.\n…But Ha-Yul was making a big mistake right now.\nDorothy would feel dissatisfied hearing this but would be convinced,\nBut Amelia had the means.\n“…Uh, Dad.”\n“Amelia?”\n“Yeah. Are you busy?… It’s okay? Yeah. No, it’s nothing much. I have a small favor to ask.”\nI knew it would turn out like this.\nI don’t know about Dorothy, but those words would never convince Amelia.\nAt least not the Amelia I’ve seen so far.\nAnd I’m really sorry to say this, but she seemed to have a way to break through this situation.\n“I want to go to the front lines… Don’t talk nonsense? Ah, okay. Then can I post all the Luv☆Deluxe you secretly bought on SNS?”\nWhat’s that now?\nSomething strange suddenly popped up in Amelia’s conversation.\n“Luv Deluxe? That’s definitely…”\n“Could Amelia’s father really be reading that? I thought it was just a rumor.”\n“No way…”\nWhat could it be to elicit such a reaction?\nOut of curiosity, I searched for the title on my cell phone.\nWhat appeared were the covers of comic books and novels.\n…With a girl half-naked.\n“How did I know, you ask? No, Dad. I understand you want to hide that kind of thing, but at least hide it well. Hiding it under the bed is too easy to get caught.”\nSo it’s that kind of thing.\nIt seems Amelia’s father tried to hide his taste somehow, but he got caught by Amelia.\nI understand wanting to hide the fact that you like that kind of thing, but…\nWhy did he have to get caught by his own daughter of all people?\nIt’s not the fact that it was his family that found it, but Amelia did.\nMoreover, hiding it under the bed, what are you, a kid?\nI couldn’t hear the other side of the conversation, but the mood was conveyed.\nIt seemed like Amelia’s father, who had been adamantly refusing, was begging for something while squirming.\nOtherwise, there’s no way Amelia would have such a triumphant expression.\n“Ah, one more person besides me. Include a girl named Dorothy Gale too. You say that’s really not possible? I can’t hear you well, Dad. Is it really not okay?”\n“…”\n“I see. Aah, can’t be helped then. I’ll also sell off the secret collection hidden in that villa’s storage. You don’t need it, right? I’m sure there are plenty people would want to buy.”\nDorothy and Ha-Yul, Siwoo and I.\nEven the students and teachers who were spectating all became quiet.\nBecause we realized this had reached a level that couldn’t even be called a negotiation anymore.\n…It was blackmail.\n“Oh, Dad. If you just close your eyes and grant me one favor, everything will be fine.”\nAfter a short while.\nAs if having heard something, a smile bloomed on Amelia’s face.\n“Great! I love you, Dad. I’ll keep that safe with me. Hide it better from now on. Got it?”\nAmelia lightly put down her cell phone, smiled brightly and said to Ha-Yul.\n“Dorothy and I got invited too, so it’s okay for us to go, right?”\n“…”\n“What’s with this atmosphere? What’s wrong with everyone?”\nAre you asking because you don’t know?\nIn an atmosphere where everyone seemed to want to say that, Siwoo asked Amelia as a representative.\n“…Uh, well. Are you sure it’s okay?”\n“Hm? What is?”\n“I mean your father. Is it okay to treat him like that?”\n“Ah, it’s fine. I get that treatment sometimes too.”\nShe gets that treatment sometimes?\nEveryone was dumbfounded by the preposterous answer.\n“If you heard what I did just to hear ‘I love you, Amelia’ once, you’d be surprised.”\n“…O, oh. I see. But…um, won’t there be a problem.”\n“What problem?”\n“You said your father wanted to hide it. The books he reads. There are a lot of people here, and everyone heard it…”\n“I told them to listen, though?”\n“…What?”\nAmelia spoke without even trying to erase the laughter in her voice.\n“This wouldn’t have happened if Dad had just agreed from the start. It’s a bit of revenge.”\n“Still, it seemed like a secret he wanted to hide…”\n“Passionate fans were already half-suspecting it anyway, so it’s fine. They thought, ‘I guess that’s how it is’ since he strongly denied it.”\n“…Then you talked about it on purpose?”\n“Yeah. I wonder if he’s clutching his head right about now, seeing the stories popping up on SNS.”\nHow does she plan to handle the aftermath?\nNo, knowing Amelia, she might have done it without even thinking about it.\n“Now, since Dad invited Dorothy and me, it’s okay for us to go, right?”\n“…Uh, yeah. Right?”\n“Let’s go, Dorothy.”\n“…Okay.”\nEvil.\nThat thought lingered in everyone’s minds.",

      "content": "“You really wanted to follow us that badly?”\n“Of course.”\n“…”\nInside the aircraft heading to the frontlines, everyone looked at Amelia with dismayed eyes.\n“What?”\n“But still, he’s your father…”\nHonestly, it was still shocking.\nA daughter exposing her father’s secrets that he wanted to hide.\nNo matter how I thought about it, this wasn’t right.\nOkay. Let’s say, with many concessions, that it could happen.\nBut why did the secret he was hiding have to be something like that?\nHis tastes were beyond unique. They were bizarre.\nHe was a famous and popular hero who was always on the front lines.\nDoes it make sense for someone like that to have a hobby of reading light novels?\nCould it be that the Author planned this?\nPerhaps noticing the suspicion that she had done this, the Author began frantically appealing that it wasn’t her doing.\n[No, no! It really wasn’t me!]\n“…”\n[All I did was set up Amelia’s personality to be inherited from her father… And I did that a long time ago!]\nIt was you who did it.\nSeeing her confess her crime while trying to make excuses was ridiculous, and a hollow laugh escaped me.\n“Your parents also thought you were in danger and tried to stop you.”\n“Well, that’s true. They always play with me but stop me when it’s really dangerous.”\n“Even though you know that…”\n“Don’t you remember what I said last time?”\n“…What?”\nAmelia looked at Siwoo, who was trying to send her back somehow as if it was absurd.\nWhat on earth did she say?\nAs Dorothy and I expressed our puzzlement, Amelia sighed and opened her mouth.\n“Can someone who abandons their friend and runs away aim to be a hero?”\n…Ah.\nCome to think of it, she did say something like that.\nSiwoo and I were lost in emotion.\nThe memory of when we had just entered the school suddenly came to mind.\nWhat was it? A rat demi-human?\nI remembered the man with the impressive protruding front teeth.\nIt was impressive how Amelia stepped forward, saying she wouldn’t abandon her friend when she was in danger.\nYeah, she did say that.\nTime has already passed so much.\n“Don’t worry too much. I have the confidence to protect myself. Dorothy may not look like it, but she’s also a precious existence. Do you know how important a buff totem is?”\n“This isn’t a game…”\nDorothy, who was treated as a buff totem, drooped.\nShe knew it wasn’t wrong, but being told that still hurt her.\nBut with no words to refute, she just looked gloomy.\n“… We’ll be arriving soon. Please get ready to disembark.”\n“Ah, yes.”\n“And Amelia, please be kind to your parents…”\n“I’ll think about it.”\nPerhaps because of his experience on the frontlines, there was pity in investigator Lee Ha-Yul’s voice as he accompanied the students.\n“Sigh… He’s still into that… At least hide it from your daughter.”\n“…What? You know my dad?”\n“Of course I do. I met him briefly before.”\nPeople who have been there are usually tightly bonded.\nBecause they’re comrades who share each other’s lives.\nA faint smile hung on Ha-Yul’s lips as he said that.\n“Did you see that kind of thing back then too?”\n“Don’t even mention it. He was always looking at that stuff, saying he had no time to meet women.”\n“…But how did he not get caught until now?”\n“Because you have to protect a colleague’s private life. Besides, he was quite a promising person. It’s a headache if rumors spread about someone who’s rising.”\nHe smiled and said he tried to hide his comrade’s tastes somehow.\n“Besides, well, it’s true that he was too busy to have time to meet women. Everyone just accepted it.”\n“…But how did he meet my mom then? They seemed to get along well.”\n“Oh, um. That’s…”\nHa-Yul, who was talking with Amelia, suddenly started paying attention to me.\n… What’s going on?\nI was listening with interest as old memories came up.\nIt felt like listening to a teacher telling a story during class.\nThere seemed to be something thrilling about what wasn’t a big deal.\n…Being a teacher really is your true calling, isn’t it?\nUnable to endure the students’ gazes, he finally opened his mouth.\n“I heard they were close friends since childhood. He went to meet that friend during a long-awaited vacation, and…”\nRawr!\nInvestigator Lee made a cute gesture with his hands spread and shouted softly.\n“He got gobbled up.”\n“…Oh.”\nWhat, why is everyone suddenly looking at me?\nAmelia and Dorothy were looking at me with meaningful eyes.\nAs for Siwoo… I’m not sure. What kind of look is that?\nHa-Yul’s eyes looked worried.\n“…I think this story is enough for now. Everyone, please get up. Let’s go greet the commander.”\nWe took out the luggage we had packed one by one, as we had to live here for a few months.\nPerhaps because it was adjusted appropriately to match the context without the Author’s setting changes.\nAmelia ended up becoming a daughter with a mother who died to maternal complications.\nBut the family seemed happy, so I guess it’s fine.\n“…Hmm.”\nI thought a woman pouncing first was just a delusion that only happened in subcultures.\nBut it really does happen.\nWhen I turned my head towards Siwoo, he hurriedly turned his head away from looking at me.\n“…?”\n“L-let’s go. Arte.”\nHis voice was trembling.\n…Is he sick somewhere? Did he catch a cold?\n“If you walk that slowly, we’ll be late. Everyone already went far ahead.”\nSince the others had already gone far ahead, I hurried and followed them.\n…But I feel a bit uneasy.\nNo matter how much of a protagonist he is, a person is a person.\nI couldn’t help but feel tense about the fact that he walked into a dangerous place on his own feet.\nI hope he didn’t get sick from being unable to sleep properly.\nI hastily grabbed Siwoo’s hand.\n“?!”\n“Hmm, are you okay…?”\n… I’m not sure.\nIn comics and novels, they check a person’s body temperature by touching them, but aren’t they all too sensitive?\nNo matter how much I touch him, there doesn’t seem to be much difference from me.\nAll I could feel was his firm and well-trained hand.\n“…Um, Arte?”\n“…”\nSquish squish.\nVarious emotions swirled inside me, and I ended up fiddling with Siwoo’s hand for no reason.\nIt’s firm. It’s probably natural since he trains every day.\nI feel a bit jealous of Siwoo’s physique, but…\nI saw with my own eyes how he trains.\nI wonder if I can follow his training method. It looked really tough.\nWhen I tried touching my own hand, I felt a soft and squishy sensation.\n…Yeah, well.\nI guess it’s okay even if I don’t train hard.\nThere’s no need to build muscle, right?\nI used to get angry about why this body was made like this.\nHave I become completely used to it now?\nI’m slowly starting to forget even my original appearance.\n“…Arte. Let’s go now. We’ll really lose them.”\n“Ah. Sorry.”\nOh no.\nIt seemed I had been lost in thought and fiddled with Siwoo’s hand again.\nStartled, I let go of his hand and hurriedly started running in the direction my companions were walking.\n“…Phew. That surprised me. I got flustered.”\nThat’s why I didn’t see Siwoo’s face turning completely red and him letting out a shallow sigh.\n***\n(So?)\n“Huh? What?”\n(You’re moving to a new stage. Do you have anything in mind?)\n“No? Not really?”\n(You… never mind.)\nThey were about to shout at the pure girl again about why she was not setting things up.\nShe spoke confidently.\n“I didn’t plan on having everyone go there in the first place!”\n(Ah, right.)\n(If it’s you, then that makes sense…)\nStorylines were no longer important to the girl.\nBecause of that, some guys said they were getting bored and went to do something else, but who cares.\nIt was self-satisfaction from the beginning.\nA work made by picking up a wandering soul, searching for an interesting world.\nIt was a work she made because she wanted to enjoy it.\n“I’m not interested in the protagonist’s growth story anymore.”\n‘How amazing it is that you, dear reader, who should have been just an observer, made me throw away all the plans to create a work that captures the protagonist’s growth.’\nIn the first place, it’s an impossible goal now that she can’t manipulate the Protagonist as she pleases.\nNow, she only has one goal.\nIt’s to watch the Reader and Protagonist connect.\n“So I don’t really care about the change in location either.”\n(…Right. That looks fun too.)\nOf course, seeing the Protagonist being cool and active is also nice.\nBut the ultimate goal is no longer his growth.\nThe girl was trying to think of a plan to get them together.\n“The protagonist seems to have already fallen for her…”\nPerhaps because she was holding his hand, the Reader didn’t notice, but the Protagonist’s face was red.\nWell, it would be if the person you love is doing that.\n(As for your Reader… About halfway there?)\n“Yeah. She hasn’t realized her own feelings. But it’s okay.”\nIn the girl’s judgment, she already had some feelings for Siwoo.\nThe only one who understands her. The only person she can trust even if the whole world turns against him.\nIt’s no joke. She must be sincerely thinking that.\n“Having that kind of feeling itself isn’t normal.”\nShe seems to think of him as just a close friend you can trust…\nWell. Would you hug a close friend’s clothes to calm down?\nIt would be difficult without a physical attraction.\n“The setting happens to be a battlefield too, right?”\nAnd a very dangerous battlefield at that.\nIt’s the perfect place for emotions to reach an extreme situation.\nThe girl smiled innocently.",

      "content": "“… It’s been a long time, Commander.”\nNot long after arriving at the accommodation, my companions and I could meet the Commander so easily that it was absurd.\nIs this right?\nCould it be that the higher-ups in this world can normally be met this easily?\nThinking I might be the strange one, I looked around at my companions’ reactions to check.\nAnd I realized. It wasn’t me who was strange.\nEveryone had a look of astonishment. They didn’t expect to be able to meet him this easily.\n“…Commander?”\n“Those kids seem to have a lot of questions. Why don’t we resolve that first before talking?”\nAs if he knew without being told, he looked at us with a benevolent expression.\nIs it because he’s old? His white hair and beard. And the wrinkles on his face created harmony.\nRather than being ugly, it was a look of accumulated years.\nThe benevolent expression may have made me think that even more.\n“…How can we meet you this easily?”\nWhen everyone was hesitating, wondering if it was really okay to speak,\nAmelia asked bluntly.\n“It’s too strange. If you’re the Commander, you must be a core person here, but there’s no one guarding you.”\nYeah. That was the question everyone had.\nThis benevolent old man is the commander.\nA person in a position to handle people.\nMoreover, this is the frontline. Putting aside the powerful magic beasts, there are prisoners here.\nPrisoners forcibly placed here due to a shortage of manpower.\nWho was it? That villain who killed investigator Ha-Yul’s friend, whom I can’t even remember the face of, had also stayed here.\nIf I remember correctly, he was trash who escaped from here and went around killing civilians.\n…Of course, it’s because of the Author’s setting changes.\nStill, the parts the Author didn’t set would follow context, so there’s no way there would only be one or two such people around here.\nThere would definitely be various noises, and then there’s no way there wouldn’t be people trying to harm the commander.\nNo matter how much I thought about it, I couldn’t imagine the prisoners quietly listening to the commander’s words.\nUnless they were going to behead this old man and escape.\n“…Ah. You could think that way too. I didn’t even consider that you might not know. It’s my mistake. I apologize.”\n“It’s alright. It’s not that important of a fact.”\nNot an important fact?\nTo us expressing doubt, Ha-Yul smiled and said.\n“Because he’s the strongest person here. He’s not at the level to be taken down by mere criminals who were caught and handed over here.”\n“…Is he stronger than Dad?”\n“Of course. I’m much stronger than your father. If I lose to someone like that, it would be a disgrace.”\n“…”\n“If I lose to a guy who reads novels about girls running around naked, I’d have to hang myself and die from shame.”\nThe old man who said that stroked his beard and smiled benevolently.\n“If you put it that way, there would be a lot of people who should die… No, that’s not it. But why don’t we know?”\n“Hmm?”\n“If you’re that strong, there’s no way rumors wouldn’t spread. At least once in the media…”\n“This is the frontline. There are many secrets here that can’t be told to people.”\n“…”\n“You seem to have a lot more questions, but why don’t you rest first?”\nThe old man, still smiling without changing his expression, suggested.\nNo, rather than a suggestion, it’s practically an order.\nBecause no one would really refuse in this situation.\n…I thought Amelia might be a little different, but even she didn’t go that far.\nAs everyone seemed to agree, the commander told us without losing his smile.\n“I’m sorry for calling you students to such a remote place. I promise to try to finish the parts where I need your help as quickly as possible.”\n“…Understood. Thank you.”\n“I’ll tell investigator Lee Ha-Yul the details, so rest in an empty room.”\n“B-but he’s the chaperone teacher?”\n“I want to chat with my subordinate, whom I haven’t seen in a while. I called someone in advance to replace me, so please forgive me.”\n“What? Someone to replace you…?”\n-Honk!\nAt that moment, a horn sounded from outside the building.\n“He’s here.”\n“B-but…”\n“Please go ahead, Dorothy. I’ll see you later.”\n“…Okay.”\nHmm, something’s fishy.\nI couldn’t help but look at the commander with suspicious eyes.\nIt’s a cliché for kind-looking people like this to have a black heart.\n…Even if I doubt him now, it’s meaningless.\nNothing has happened yet.\nThe Author might have made changes to the setting.\nFor now, I decided to follow that person’s words obediently.\nWho knows if he’s really a good person?\nEven if I ask the Author, I don’t think she’ll answer.\n***\n“… It’s been a long time. You’ve changed a lot.”\n“As expected, you noticed.”\n“Of course. You know my ability well.”\nSighing, the Commander looked at his former subordinate.\nHow did he end up changing like this?\nThat innocent and selfless appearance from before has disappeared, and all that’s left now is a worn-out veteran hero.\nSeeing people who have become like this isn’t new, but such changes always made his heart ache whenever he sees them.\n“You ended up killing.”\n“…As expected, you knew.”\n“Like I said before, of course I would know.”\n‘I knew that ability was cheating.’\nHe heard him think that.\nEveryone thinks that when they stand before his eyes.\nThere are quite a few inconveniences, you know.\nIt must be unpleasant to have your thoughts read, so it can’t be helped.\n“…So? Are you going to kill me?”\n“I’d appreciate it if you stopped saying that when you know what I’m going to say.”\n“Of course. I know.”\n…Arachne.\nThe world has changed a lot too.\nHe thought the troublesome incidents coming in every day had decreased lately, but there was a reason for that.\nHe had no intention of saying anything about investigator Ha-Yul killing someone.\nHe still remembers directly comforting him back then, so if he had met him by chance, he thought it would have turned out like that.\n“It’s meaningless to ask why you let him out, right?”\n“That’s right. It’s the principle.”\n“You haven’t changed at all.”\n“I’ve changed a lot, you know. I’m afraid my hair might start falling out soon.”\n“You’ve finally learned how to joke. Your hair still looks thick.”\n“Is that so?”\nEven though he knew it was flattery, he laughed heartily as it made him feel good.\nTalking with old acquaintances was always enjoyable.\n…But he should get to the main point soon.\n“Hmm, like I said, all I want is a search. You don’t have to do the rest.”\n“Is a search enough? Helping with combat would be…”\n“That would certainly be helpful, but it would be a big problem if the students get hurt.”\nIf those kids get hurt, he could already picture what kind of situation would unfold.\nProtests and controversies spreading on the internet.\nThere aren’t many people who want to mess with them, but it’s not like there are none at all.\nVictims of villains who were released according to principles.\nReporters looking for juicy stories.\nGroups that hate superhumans.\nTo avoid giving those bastards an excuse, he had to block off anything that could be a problem as much as possible.\nA searcher suddenly fell ill or couldn’t come for personal reasons, so he had no choice but to bring students…\nBut he can’t give them a bigger excuse.\n“Put the boy in charge of searching and have him accompany the other students. The purpose…escort should be enough. Their concern for their friend is admirable.”\n“…Understood. I’ll tell them that.”\n“Ah, and wait a moment.”\n“Yes?”\nAs Ha-Yul, who heard all the instructions, was about to leave his seat, he hurriedly decided to relay additional information.\n“That boy. His name was… Siwoo? Have him share a room with the girl named Arte.”\n“What? You’re joking, right?”\n“Of course not. I’m serious.”\n“…Siwoo is a boy, and Arte is a girl? It’s not like there aren’t any rooms. Didn’t you say there’s a shortage of manpower?”\n“There’s a reason it has to be that way. Please.”\n“…”\nOh dear.\nHe left without even answering.\nSince he could confirm his acceptance with his ability, it was a trivial act of rebellion, but it still hurt a bit.\nPerverted old fart, that’s too much.\nHe was happy that he trusted him enough to follow absurd words. Still, at the same time, he felt bitter about the strange misunderstanding.\n“…Puppets, Author, Protagonist. And another world.”\nThe old man leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes.\nAs expected, he didn’t like his ability.\nEveryone envies it, but he ends up knowing all the secrets he doesn’t want to know.\n“If I didn’t know, I would have just left them alone, but…”\nHe couldn’t feel at ease leaving such an unstable child alone.\nEven if he’s already a dying old man in a remote room, he is also a superhuman and a hero.\nIt was hard to watch a child’s heart rot away.\n“…But was it too much to put them in the same room after all?”\nNo, looking at the two’s memories, that should be the right answer.\nShe seems to feel a great sense of psychological stability around him.\n“Heh, it’s a good time. It’s a good time.”\nA girl who feels stability hugging someone else’s clothes, and a boy who sneaks into the girl’s locker.\nIs that normal these days?\n…No, there’s no way.\nTwo people chosen by a transcendent being.\nThey’re literally a couple sent from the heavens.",

      "content": "The person who would guide us in place of Ha-Yul, as suggested by the old Commander.\nThe reactions of my companions upon seeing that person were mixed.\nTwo people are looking at him with curiosity, and Amelia is frowning.\nAnd me, wondering who he was to make such expressions.\n“Hello, kids. From now on, I’ll guide you instead of investigator Lee. Is that okay?”\n“…Why are you here, Dad?”\nHuh? Dad?\n…Now that she mentioned it, they do look a bit alike.\nI wasn’t talking about their appearance. Their distinctive features and aura were similar.\nGolden silk-like hair and blue eyes, just like Amelia’s.\nThe face is different, and the expression is different.\nBut her unique aura was lingering around him as well.\nRealizing that fact and looking again, to the point where anyone would think they were father and daughter.\n“Why am I here, you ask. My lovely daughter came here, so who else could come but me?”\n“Ugh.”\n“That kind of hurts…”\n…It seemed like not only their faces but also their personalities were completely different.\n“Well, it’s not a joke. I came because it would be more comfortable to have someone you know to guide you.”\n“Really?… Well, if that’s the case, I don’t really mind.”\nAmelia had never talked to us about disliking her father or anything like that.\nThen what is this?\nIt felt like watching a father intruding on his daughter in puberty.\n“Follow me, kids. It’s not that far. Let’s talk leisurely while walking.”\n“Ah, yes.”\nAt first, everyone was interacting with him awkwardly.\nBut since when?\nHe naturally blended into our group and started having various conversations.\nAbout our abilities, about what’s going on in the world these days.\nHe skillfully started conversations by leading the topic here and there.\n“Really? That’s amazing. It’s a really rare ability, isn’t it?”\n“Hehe, is that so?”\n“Even if you come here, you’re guaranteed to be treated well? Since it’s an ability to strengthen others, you’ll be in the rear, so it’ll be less dangerous…I can’t recommend it though.”\n“Why?”\n“No matter how less dangerous it is, a battlefield is a battlefield. You never know when you might die. That’s why you guys came too, isn’t it.”\n“…Ah. That villain?”\n“Yeah.”\nCan we finally hear about the target of our search?\nEven when I asked Ha-Yul, he said the details were confidential, so he didn’t know much.\nI heard that they could only tell us after we arrived directly.\nJust what kind of guy is he for them to do that?\n“Right. You don’t know much about the target yet. Okay, since you’ve come this far, I can explain.”\n“Explain?”\n“Here, want to check this out?”\n“…This is?”\nHe took something out of his pocket and handed it to Siwoo.\nWhat on earth could this be?\nIn his hand that received the item, there was a small, black mechanical device.\n“Everyone working here carries this. It’s a specially made expensive item, so it’s a pretty sturdy high-end product…Right. You guys take one each too.”\n“Ah, thank you.”\n“…But what is this?”\nI asked him, who suddenly remembered and handed the items to us as well.\nWhat is this tiny thing that he’s giving to us?\n“Ah. I forgot. It’s like a small camera.”\n“Camera?”\n“If you touch it like this… There, can you see?”\nI looked at him suspiciously as he started turning the camera here and there with his fingers, wondering where the controls were on such a small item.\nBut that was only for a moment. The light that came out of a small hole soon started projecting a video on the wall in front of us.\n“Wow, that’s amazing…”\n“Like I said before, it’s dangerous here. It’s really convenient to have something that automatically records when something happens without activating it yourself.”\n“…”\nWhen something happens.\nAt those words, the mouths of everyone gaping in amazement closed.\nAt the same time, we realized why he had handed us these items earlier.\nIf something happens to us, they can clearly identify the cause.\nAnd the fact that this item, the first one he gave, with the video playing now, was something someone had been wearing.\n“You seem to have guessed? That’s right. This is the record of one of the 2nd team members killed by the villain. Fortunately, it remained.”\n“…It remained?”\n“No matter how sturdy it is, there’s a limit since it’s small. Of course, it breaks if it’s on a part hit by a magic beast.”\nUpon learning that this item was someone’s legacy, the atmosphere among my companions turned gloomy.\n“Here, look. That’s our target.”\nAnd that gloomy atmosphere vanished in an instant.\nIt had to vanish. Everyone was overwhelmed by the villain’s appearance in the video before our eyes.\n“…What is that?”\n-Hey, what are you doing there?\n-What am I doing, you ask?\nCrunch.\nThe appearance of the girl in the video was hideous beyond words.\nWhen the person presumed to be the owner of this item was struggling to alert everyone of the abnormal situation.\nThe girl who quietly approached and stroked the leg of the magic beast beside her…\nShe was too hideous to be called human.\n“Is that really a person…?”\n“Who knows? We’re in a bit of a controversy about that too.”\n“Whether she’s human or a monster?”\n“Yeah. We’ve classified it as a villain since she takes on a human form and can speak.”\nIs it really okay to call that a person?\nThat thought lingered in everyone’s minds.\nBecause the girl’s appearance was truly hideous beyond words.\nBefore that horrific something attached to her body, she might have been an ordinary girl.\nBut the girl’s appearance that we’re seeing…\nIs this what an abandoned doll would look like after a child played with clay?\nThe appearance revealed when she took off the hoodie covering her silhouette was truly shocking.\nHideous teeth and eyes were stuck all over her arms.\nSomething bright red was constantly moving in the area, presumed to be her chest…Probably the heart.\nHer legs had sharp thorns protruding, making it hard to see them as human.\nOverall, it was difficult to see her as human.\nShe had the form of a horrific monster that you would only see in horror movies.\n“She’s too human-like to be a monster since she can talk to humans and too monster-like to be human since she can talk to them.”\n“…That seems dangerous.”\n“Right?”\nEveryone understood.\nWhy the Association only showed this to us after we arrived at the scene.\nSomething that can simultaneously communicate with monsters and humans. Something hard to even distinguish.\nIf this somehow leaked out, it was hard to even imagine what kind of incident would occur and its aftermath.\n“I didn’t want to ask for your help, but… I’m really sorry.”\n“…I heard the search-type ability users suddenly suffered from a manpower shortage.”\n“Yeah. That’s what happened.”\nSighing, he spoke as if complaining.\n“I tried to call a colleague who was on vacation, but he said he was helping out because a serial murder case broke out near him. Other search-type superhumans said their situations were similar. My luck is really bad.”\n…Luck? No, that can’t be.\nEveryone seems to think it’s unlucky because it’s an incident that occurred in reality, but I could tell.\nThat it was the Author’s doing.\nI slightly raised my head and looked at the ceiling.\n“I’m really sorry. Instead, we’ll make sure to provide reliable protection.”\n“… It’s okay. I think of it as doing something I’d have to do someday in advance.”\n“Ooh… Hey, daughter. Do you have some cool friends? Want to try catching them somehow?”\n“Absolutely not! Are you crazy?!”\nWhoosh.\nI turned my head to look in the direction of the voice.\n“…Why? Did I do something wrong…?”\n“It’s nothing.”\n“O-oh, really?”\nHe gave an awkward smile, seemingly startled by my voice.\nAfter a brief moment of silence, we arrived at the accommodation.\nHe handed us the keys.\n“Here it is. Rest well here today. The commander probably relayed the detailed schedule to investigator Ha-Yul.”\n“Ah, thank you.”\n“Daughter, you follow me for a bit.”\n“…Huh? Me? Why?”\n“Why, you ask?”\nHe was still smiling.\nBut as if sensing something strange, Amelia started preparing to run away.\n“You see, Dad checked all the posts that went up on SNS.”\n“…?!”\n“Oh my, daughter. You think you can run away?”\n“Since when?!”\nBut at the moment she was about to take off her foot to accelerate.\nLionel, already preparing to capture Amelia, instantly approached her side and grabbed her cheek, grinning confidently.\n“Hey, this is cheating…!”\n“Tsk tsk, you naughty thing. How dare you expose Dad’s hobby? I didn’t raise you like that.”\n“Let me go…!”\n“As punishment, shall we spend a fun time together today, daughter?”\n“Ahh, guys…! Save me!”\nThere was nothing we could really do to help.\nHonestly, it seemed like it was Amelia’s fault.\nSpreading someone’s private matters to the whole world is a bit much, isn’t it?\nAs if realizing we had no intention of helping, Amelia started screaming pitifully.\n“Oh my, even the scream is…”\n“…Have a good time?”\n“Rest well… It’s been a while since I enjoyed a fun hell racing, daughter. Remember that the moment you get caught by me, it turns into hell sparring?”\n“Uh, that, Dad…?”\n“You don’t have to worry. If your skills haven’t rusted, I won’t be able to catch up with you. But if you do get caught, you’ll have to fight me in that tough situation.”\n“P-please go easy on me…?”\n“Tsk tsk. Training is like real combat. And what was our family motto?”\n“… Don’t be picky about the means and methods.”\n“That’s right. Don’t be picky about the means and methods, and you’ll be fine if you run away from me, right?”\nThat expression says it’s impossible. Amelia’s face was filled with resignation.\nShe said before her father couldn’t keep up with her speed.\nIt’s probably not a lie, but it seems it’s only possible once she gains some speed.\nThen what happens if she gets caught before gaining speed?\n“Then, start!”\n“Save me!”\n“Hahaha, you’re slow, daughter! Run faster!”\n“I don’t want to!”\n“…Sigh.”\nLike father, like daughter indeed.",

      "content": "*Siwoo POV\nI stared blankly at the two figures disappearing in the distance, scattering screams and laughter.\nThat family definitely isn’t right in the head.\nThe dad is like that, and the daughter is like that.\nI was convinced the mom’s side I hadn’t seen wasn’t normal either.\nBecause of what I heard on the plane.\n“What should we do now…”\n“Who knows? Since they brought us here and told us to rest, I guess it’s okay to rest?”\nSince they told us to rest, maybe we should rest well today.\nI answered with that thought, but I was also half in doubt of the situation.\nThere was a strange atmosphere inside the accommodation.\nIt clearly was a comfortable room. One presumably made for two people to stay in.\nTwo beds, two desks. It’s probably certain.\nThere’s no one in the room.\nStill, there’s only one reason we’re hesitant to go in.\n“It seems like a place where people were living. Are you sure it’s okay to enter…?”\n“I don’t know.”\nIt was because there were traces of people living there.\nItems presumed to be for personal use stood out, although they were organized as if someone had been living there.\n“…What the, who are these kids?”\n“Hello.”\n“Oh, yeah. Have you seen a yellow-haired man around here?”\n“Yes. He ran over there.”\n“I knew it was that jerk. I thought so.”\nHe suddenly appeared and asked about Amelia’s father, then started badmouthing him while grumbling.\n“I told him to be quiet, but he just won’t listen, seriously.”\n“Ahaha…”\n“I was glad he said he’d call people to help, but why did they come so soon?”\nHis treatment of his own daughter was curt, so is he like that to his colleagues too?\nSeeing him being treated as a nuisance, I felt a bit sorry for him.\n“Since you’re unfamiliar faces, you must be the helpers? Why are you here? I thought the operation starts tomorrow.”\n“Ah, about that…”\nIt seemed like good timing.\nDorothy started explaining our situation.\nThey brought us here, but we were hesitating about whether we could really go in.\nThere were traces of people living here, so we wondered if they had brought us to the wrong place.\n“…That jerk didn’t even explain this before leaving?”\nSighing lightly, he told us the truth.\n“Well, it’s a place where people lived, so of course it feels that way. You can throw it away if it’s uncomfortable.”\n“What? B-but someone else’s belongings…”\n“No, I said ‘were living.’ They died.”\n“…Ah.”\nAfter hearing those words, the accommodation I looked at felt quite different from a moment ago.\nThe only thing that changed was my prior knowledge.\nI thought someone was living here, so there was still human warmth.\nBut looking at it again after hearing that, it only felt chilling.\n“…Since you’re here, you heard about the search target?”\n“Ah, yes.”\n“This is where the guys who were done in by that thing stayed.”\n“…”\n“You guys are aspiring heroes, right? Still students.”\n“That’s right.”\n“Just in time. Don’t hesitate and come in.”\n“…”\n“Well, you’ll be staying here anyway.”\nMuttering like that, he rummaged through a desk a bit and then returned with two pieces of paper as if he had found them.\n“…What are these?”\n“Wills. Read them.”\nIs it okay to read these?\nAs I hesitated, he nodded as if telling me to read them quickly.\n“…”\nUnable to resist that urging, I read the wills and found common stories written on them.\nIf someone is reading this will, I’m probably already dead.\nI’m sorry to my family. I was always grateful to my friends and colleagues. Those kinds of stories.\nNormally, they would be stories I could lightly pass over as unfortunate, but thinking that this was the place of the person who wrote these wills, my heart felt heavy.\n“How is it?”\n“… It’s a bit… I feel a certain way. Why are you showing these to us?”\n“It’s nothing much. I thought I should tell you since you’re still young.”\n“Tell us?”\n“If you came with a light heart, go back now.”\nSaying that, he advised us.\n“As you can see, people die frequently here. You can go back now, forget the confidential matters, and focus on defeating villains.”\n“But…!”\n“You’re still young, right? You might regret it. The owners of this room were also people who worked here for several years. They were elite. But now they’re like this. Do you think heroes are invincible?”\nI’ve seen quite a lot of people dying.\nI’ve seen dead bodies too. There are villains I’ve killed myself.\n…But it was my first time seeing the aftermath of a hero’s death.\nI understood it in my head. The fact that heroes aren’t invincible and can die at any time.\nBut maybe I was thinking too lightly.\nThe arrogant thought that we won’t die, that we’ll be different.\nPerhaps I had been harboring such thoughts without realizing it.\nSuddenly, I had those thoughts.\n“Of course, defeating villains is dangerous too, but… Not as much as this place. It’s not too late. It’s okay to go back. I’ll convince that wily old man.”\n“…No. It’s okay.”\n“Why?”\nAs I quietly listened to the story with those thoughts, Arte refuted him.\n“Because we won’t die.”\n“That’s…”\n“It’s not like arrogance or anything. That’s how it will be.”\nThere was conviction in Arte’s eyes.\nIt’s a statement with no basis, but as if it’s certain.\n“…Sigh, okay. I warned you, alright?”\n“Thank you for your concern. But it’s really okay.”\n“Alright, rest well. See you tomorrow.”\nI watched his back as he left, waving his hand.\nMaybe it was because of the atmosphere up until now that I belatedly realized we were in a dangerous place.\nThe kind and benevolent commander, the companions who came out with me.\nInvestigator Lee, whom we see every day at school.\nAmelia’s father with a bright atmosphere.\n…But this was a battlefield. A place where you never know when someone might die.\nWas he trying to let us know that fact?\n“He’s quite a worrywart. There’s no way we’ll die.”\nRight? Arte looked at me.\nAt that face with a hint of a smile, I nodded.\n“Yeah. Of course.”\nBut as Arte said, he was worrying unnecessarily.\nThat’s how it will be.\nBecause I’ll protect everyone.\nSo that Arte won’t be sad.\nShe clearly thinks of other people as dolls and thinks I’m the only human.\nBut is that really the case?\nWithout realizing it herself, her attitude changes when she looks at Amelia and Dorothy.\nShe would definitely be hurt if those two got injured.\nSo that Arte won’t get hurt. So that my friends won’t get hurt.\nProtecting everyone was my purpose.\n“…Where did Lionel go?”\n“Ah, teacher. He went over there. With Amelia.”\n“No wonder there was a loud noise…”\nThere was a faint smile on investigator Lee’s face as he sighed.\n“It really feels like he’s back, I miss seeing that troublemaker.”\n“Troublemaker?”\n“As if he hates this place being quiet, he causes incidents every day.”\n… He’s really just like Amelia.\nI can roughly guess the content too.\nActually doing absurd thoughts, and as a result, minor incidents become huge.\nSomething like that, right?\n“There was a time he tried to grill and eat monster meat, wondering what it tastes like.”\n“…How was it?”\n“He spit it out, saying it’s tough because it’s all muscle.”\nAs if old memories were coming back, investigator Lee kept looking around.\nAs if realizing we were there, he faked a cough and continued speaking.\n“I will inform you of the operation details tomorrow. Please rest well in this room today. It may feel icky, but there are no spare rooms right now.”\n“It’s alright.”\n“Dorothy and I will stay in this room, so you two, please use that room.”\n“…What?”\nHuh?\nWhat did he say?\n“Excuse me, I think I misheard…”\n“No, you heard correctly. Dorothy and I will take this room. Arte and Siwoo, please use that room.”\n“…?”\nWhat is this?\nAs if the heavy atmosphere from a moment ago was a lie, it all vanished instantly.\nDid I hear that right?\nUh, two rooms… Arte and I use one room, and Dorothy and the teacher use the other…?\n“B-but…”\n“No need for excuses. I’m well aware that you two are living together.”\n“Ack.”\nI looked at Arte, at a loss for words, and her face was flushed red.\nShe was also moving her mouth, trying to say something.\nShe was just trembling, unable to refute anything.\n“…What about Amelia? Put Amelia with Arte and I…”\n“Her father requested to spend time together since it’s been a while. It was approved.”\n“…”\nThe gazes around me are sharp.\nThey’re probably people I’m seeing for the first time.\nAs if roughly guessing the situation, they were looking at us meaningfully.\n“Wh-what…”\n“Isn’t it a reasonable room assignment? Since you two live together, it doesn’t seem like a problem.”\n“No, that’s…”\n“Alright then…You should go to bed early at night. Because we have to begin the operation starting tomorrow.”\n“…”\nThat’s not it.\nI couldn’t refute that either. Because it was true that we were living together.\nI started feeling strange as people around us seemed to view us as a couple who did everything except date.\nTranslator’s Corner\nSpecial thing under. Will update the rest when the site works smoother.\n-Ruminas\n========\nAuthor’s Notes\nMonsters… No. Never (No clue what it means, but it’s back.)",

      "content": "“Yaaawn~”\nAmelia kept yawning because of last night’s incident.\nDamn Dad.\nHe couldn’t even dote on his lovely daughter he hadn’t seen in a while.\n‘He pounced on me, saying he’d test my skills.’\n“Ugh, my legs…”\nIf there hadn’t been someone to stop him saying there’s work to do tomorrow, she might be lying in rubble somewhere nearby.\n‘He did give me medicine, saying I’ll be fine if I take it, but…’\nInflicting the injury and then giving the cure.\nAnyway, he’s too much.\nEven if she did expose his tastes.\nIf Dad had just listened to her request from the beginning, it wouldn’t have turned out like this, right?\n“…Oh, it’s working well.”\nAs soon as she took the medicine, the pain in her trembling legs started to heal slowly.\nIs it because it’s the frontlines that they carry such good medicine?\nShe looked around in admiration of the effect of the medicine Dad gave me.\nShe should be around here somewhere.\n“Dorothy? Are you up already? That’s early.”\n“Ah, Amelia. Good morning.”\n“Morning. Why are you up so early?”\n“The teacher got up early to have a meeting with the others. I woke up early because of that noise.”\nIs that so?\nIt seems Dorothy and investigator Lee were using the same room.\n…Wait a minute.\n“What about Arte and Siwoo?”\n“…”\nSeeing Dorothy turn her head towards the other room, she realized what Dorothy wanted to say.\nThey’re over there.\n“I think I know what you’re thinking.”\n“I’m not the only one thinking that, right?”\n“…Shall we take a peek?”\n“Sure. I always say we’re on the same wavelength.”\n“That’s my line.”\nDorothy and Amelia know.\nThe fact that Siwoo and Arte are living together.\nAnd they already knew.\nSiwoo’s feelings for Arte.\nAnd they also knew that while Arte hadn’t fallen for Siwoo, she had special feelings for him.\n“For whatever reason, they ended up using the same room, right? Then…”\n“We can’t miss this chance!”\nHeh heh.\nDorothy didn’t bother hiding it and kept smiling.\n…Well, she was no different.\n“I’ve always been curious… What the two of them do…!”\n“Could they have made a lot of progress without us knowing? Like, with each other…”\n“N-n-n-no way…! That can’t be!”\nEek, eek.\nIn case other people wake up. In case Arte or Siwoo hears us.\nTheir voices were loud, but their footsteps were light.\n“Here we go, opening it…?”\n“Yes…!”\nThump, thump.\nThey were so focused that it felt like they could hear each other’s heartbeats.\nThey knew the two were living together, but they’d never heard of them doing anything inside that house.\nIn the first place, there’s no way they’d tell them.\nBut they were curious.\nAmelia remembered trying to set up Siwoo and Arte, making plans, and putting in a lot of effort.\nHow frustrated they were with Siwoo openly showing his interest in Arte and her not even noticing it.\n…But why were they trying so hard to get those two together?\nNo, such trivial things don’t matter in this situation.\nRight now, it’s a chance, perhaps the only chance, to secretly see Arte and Siwoo’s love nest…!\n“What are you doing?”\n“Ah.”\n“Um, well…”\nHowever, there was no scene to satisfy our curiosity.\nThey thought it was the only chance.\nWhen we opened the door, Arte was staring intently at them, somehow having noticed.\n“Ah, we thought you might have had breakfast! Since it’s about time…!”\n“…Sigh. I got it. I’ll be out soon, so please wait a bit.”\nD-did we make it…?\nFeeling chills, they stood still for a long time, even after Arte closed the door.\n“Phew… That startled me.”\n“That was good quick thinking, Dorothy…”\nSeeing Arte’s cold eyes, she felt a chill for a moment.\nWhat’s with those eyes?\nIt surprised her.\nShe thought she had gotten used to Arte’s suspicious smile.\n‘Now that I’m used to it, did she come up with a new smile?’\nHer eyes are smiling, but her mouth is still, as if…\n“If we mess with her too much, it feels like we’ll get sliced up…”\n“I know…”\nDorothy and Amelia agreed with each other.\nLet’s save the peeking for next time.\n***\n“…Did something happen?”\n“It seems Dorothy and Amelia came looking for us.”\n“Those two? They’re early.”\nSigh.\nI sighed and watched the two return to their room.\nThat surprised me. So it was Dorothy and Amelia.\nAnyway, those two are quite playful.\nWere they trying to surprise me and Siwoo? They approached while hiding their presence, like assassins targeting Siwoo, so I ended up getting tense.\n[Just what are you so worried about…]\nI lightly ignored the Author’s murmuring.\nIf she looks back on what she’s done, there’s no way she can say such things.\nI was confident it could lead to an even more absurd development, let alone assassins.\nSuddenly, one of the heroes at this location is a secret member of Übermensch, and for the organization’s revenge…\nShe could come up with a story like that.\nIt doesn’t matter if it makes sense or not.\nBecause the Author just does it if it seems interesting.\nIt’s best to be wary first if it looks dangerous.\n“By the way, Arte, yesterday…”\n“Those two said it’s about time for a meal, so shall we head out too?”\n“…Ah, yeah. Okay.”\n***\nSiwoo looked at Arte, recalling yesterday’s events.\nDoes she not want to talk about what happened yesterday?\nHe stared intently at her.\n“Are you not coming?”\n“… I’ll be right there.”\nAt this point, sharing a room with Arte wasn’t embarrassing.\nBecause it was something they had done to the point of being sick of it.\nIt felt awkward because it was a new place with a different feeling, but only for a moment.\nHe was used to being with Arte, so he unpacked and moved around as usual.\n‘Yeah. I acted as I normally would. I thought it was no different from usual.’\nBut it seems Arte wasn’t like that.\n“…”\nHe looked at her back, which seemed the same as always. Looking unbothered.\nShe had always been like that. Hiding her weaknesses, hiding her fears, hiding her worries.\nArte had always hidden something so she wouldn’t appear weak.\nAbout the Author. Thinking of people as puppets.\n‘And being obsessed with me.’\nHe thought it might be okay for her to talk about trivial things now, but it seemed she didn’t think that way, so he felt a bit down.\n‘Does she still not trust me enough?’\nYesterday, when that person warned that this place is dangerous.\nShe confidently said they would be fine.\nThat no one would get hurt.\nBut did Arte really think that?\nThat she, who worries about trivial things and becomes anxious as soon as he disappears, is that unstable?\nThat night.\nHe was spending the night worrying about the unfamiliar sleeping arrangement and what lay ahead.\nArte had approached him.\n“Siwoo, are you asleep…?”\nShe whispered quietly into his ear.\nAt that moment, he hesitated about how to react.\nArte seemed to judge that he was sleeping and crawled into his bed.\nHe was startled for a moment but closed his eyes when he felt trembling from behind.\nBecause he realized why Arte had to hug him secretly in the middle of the night like that.\n“… You’re anxious.”\nYeah.\nArte was anxious too.\nThat confident appearance in front of that person, saying they’ll be fine and won’t die, was just a façade.\nAs usual, hiding her weaknesses, being confident.\nShe showed a confident appearance in front of that person, but in fact, she was anxious.\nThinking, what if he gets hurt? What if Amelia and Dorothy get hurt?\nPerhaps she had such thoughts.\n“…”\nVerbally comforting her would be meaningless.\nThe method was simple then: They should not waste the practice they’ve done so far.\nSiwoo had made countless efforts.\nTo protect people.\nThat’s how it has been since he first entered the academy.\nA simple wish to become a hero.\nFor that simple wish, he worked hard to protect people.\nBut not anymore.\nHe found someone he wanted to protect. Someone he wanted to help.\n‘That’s why I worked hard.’\nTo protect Amelia. To protect Dorothy.\n…And above all, to protect Arte.\n“Don’t worry, Arte.”\nEven if he tells Arte directly, she probably won’t believe it.\nBecause she’s the type to worry a lot.\nSo, instead of telling her directly, Siwoo made a pledge.\nTo not let anyone get hurt.\nArte, Amelia, Dorothy.\nAnyone.\nSiwoo took a step.\nHis intuition was screaming loudly today as well.\nThat there’s a powerful enemy here.\nThat there’s a huge threat here. So run away quickly.\nBut Siwoo didn’t run away.\nSo that no threat can hurt them.\nSo that no hardship can torment Arte.\nBecause Siwoo decided to become a shield to protect her.",

      "content": "“As explained, we begin the search today.”\nHa-Yul’s voice echoed through the room.\nA heavy voice, completely different from usual.\nHe, who normally talked politely to the students, now spoke with such gravity that the rest of the group also became serious.\n“The plan is simple. Siwoo, who has the ability to search, and three others to escort him will conduct the search. The main force will be on standby at a slight distance. Any questions?”\n“Why is the main force staying away?”\n“Even monsters have intelligence. If we stick too close, they won’t even approach in the first place, making the search meaningless.”\nI see.\nIt was a really simple plan, just as Ha-Yul said.\nTo the point where I wondered if we even needed to gather for a briefing like this.\nIt seemed I wasn’t the only one with that question, as one of the other participants asked Ha-Yul.\n“The plan is so simple. Is it really enough with just that and nothing else?”\n“The plan is simple because we haven’t yet fully grasped Siwoo’s ability. Consider it a test run.”\n“I didn’t think of that. Sorry.”\nA test run, huh.\nWell, even though he verbally promised to finish it quickly…\nThere’s no way it could really end that fast.\n“Intuition, was it? How far can you go?”\n“Who knows. It’s my first time using my ability in a place like this.”\n“Don’t worry too much. We’ll help you out.”\n“Yes, thank you.”\nThe people looking at Siwoo had eyes smiling as if seeing a cute child.\nIt’s unpleasant.\nNo, well. Sure.\nIt must not be easy for the people here to go outside.\nSo maybe they would make that kind of expression when looking at young kids like Siwoo.\nBut still. It feels gross to be looked at with those eyes.\nWhat the heck is with that face?\nWhy are you making a face like you’re looking at a pretty little brother?\nWhy is Siwoo smiling?\nFeeling betrayed, I stared intently at him.\nPerhaps sensing my gaze, just as he was about to turn his head, a nearby member pounced on him from behind, and his head was yanked down.\n“Wha- What the?!”\n“Aww, are you jealous?”\n“J-Jealous?! No way!”\n“Yes, yes. This unnie knows everything.”\n“Since when were you my unnie?!”\nJust based on the age difference, she’s probably old enough to be my parents’ generation!\nShe may look young, but I won’t be fooled.\nMost superhumans in this world are beautiful.\nI don’t know why that is.\nEven if I asked the Author, she’d probably say something about mana, so I didn’t even bother.\nBut the fact that most superhumans are beautiful doesn’t change.\nLyla, Claire, Ha-Yul, Amelia, Dorothy.\nAnd the students and teachers at the school.\nSeeing so many superhumans made me wonder if they use some mana to maintain their appearance.\nWell, it’s a bit of a stretch to call the Übermensch good-looking with those weird things attached to their bodies.\nAnyway.\nThat’s the kind of world this is. No matter how much she looks like a pretty older sister…no, I guess it’s unnie now.\nEven if she looks young, that’s all just surface level.\nIn this superhuman society overflowing with people who look younger than their age, if she looks like this, she’s probably actually an old lad-\n“Hey, hey. You’re thinking something weird, aren’t you?”\n“Mmph!”\n“I have no intention of hitting on your boyfriend, so don’t worry too much. Your eyes are scary, kid.”\n“B-Boyfriend?! He’s not my boyfriend!”\n“Yes, yes.”\nBoyfriend, she says. I’m not in that kind of relationship with Siwoo yet.\nBut what the heck is this…\nI tried vehemently denying it, but no one seemed to believe me.\nAfter patting my head once, the woman lightly dismissed my words and started talking with the others.\n“Now, now. Let’s all get going. Shall we see what our juniors are capable of?”\n“Sure. It’s just a warm-up today, so we’ll be done soon.”\n“You’re already thinking of resting.”\n“You’re the same way.”\n“Heh, busted?”\nEven though no one said the meeting was over, people flowed out like the ebb tide. Seeing that, Ha-Yul sighed.\n“These people never change…”\n“Are they always like this?”\n“Yes, well. It was a similar atmosphere when I was here too.”\nThis is so different from what I imagined.\nI expected the front lines to have a very rigid atmosphere.\nSince it’s a dangerous place where you never know when you might lose your life.\nBut the reality is this kind of atmosphere.\n“Isn’t this better than being rigid?”\n“Ah, Commander.”\n“If we just tremble in fear of the danger that could come at any time, the atmosphere would be very heavy. I used a bit of force.”\nUsed a bit of force, he says.\nIs this the atmosphere the Commander wants?\nAs if confirming my guess, the Commander smiled benevolently as he watched the others leave.\n“If you’re always just worrying about trivial things, you can’t move forward.”\n“But isn’t it too dangerous to call it a trivial worry?”\n“You think so?”\nA casual remark that I would have brushed off any other time.\nBut I couldn’t let the Commander’s words slide and talked back to him.\n“In a dangerous battlefield where you never know when you might die, yet you call it a trivial worry. We need to prepare as much as possible-”\n“But there are also things that are impossible, my child.”\n“What do you mean, impossible?”\nHis expression was still benevolent.\nA benevolent look filled with years of experience, like a grandfather I met when I was young.\nThat experienced expression seemed incapable of causing me harm, but it felt like it was seeing right through me.\n“This place is the front lines, just as you say. Dangerous monsters appear daily, and accidents happen the moment you let your guard down.”\n“Then all the more reason to-!”\n“And that’s exactly why the atmosphere can’t be heavy.”\nThump, thump.\nAs those piercing eyes drew closer, I unconsciously backed away bit by bit.\nIt felt like some unknown pressure was being added.\n“If the sky were to collapse, what would you do?”\n“I’d hide in the ground.”\n“Then, if the ground were to cave in?”\n“Why are you even asking that?”\nI have no idea what he’s trying to say.\nIrritation welled up, and my voice rose without me realizing it.\nI really don’t get what he’s talking about.\nThere’s no way the sky would collapse or the ground would cave in.\nEven if something like that really happened, there’s no way we could find a solution-\n“Yes, that’s it.”\n“Huh?”\n“No matter how much you worry, there’s a limit to what we can solve.”\nThose piercing eyes stared straight at me once more.\nHow? Did I say that out loud?\nNo, that can’t be. I’m sure I didn’t.\n“People sometimes worry about all sorts of things. Philosophical quandaries and such.”\nHave you heard of the brain in a vat?\nThe Commander said with a smile.\n“Of course, pondering those things is good too. It’s interesting. But is it really necessary?”\n“What do you-”\n“Let’s say we really are a brain in a vat. Even if that’s true, what can that brain do?”\n“…”\nWhat can a brain in a vat do?\nEven if it realizes that everything it feels is just electrical signals from a scientist, a mere brain cannot do anything to the scientist.\nAn existence that is just a brain couldn’t possibly have a way to do anything to the scientist-\n“Exactly. Even if this world is fabricated, there is nothing we can do about it.”\nThe Commander still had that benevolent smile.\nHowever, I couldn’t properly look at him.\nIt felt like he was seeing through my thoughts.\nIt felt like everything, even the depths of my heart, was being exposed.\n“Then is that kind of worry really necessary? Even if it’s true, nothing changes. It only hurts the heart.”\n“…”\n“Your perspective on the world may change, but in the end, the fact that you’re living in this world doesn’t change.”\nJust who is this person?\nI blankly stared at the Commander.\nI thought he was just an ordinary, senile old man.\nI thought he was just one of the extras placed in the Author’s world.\n“It’s the same. Sometimes, there are worries you can’t solve. We can’t stop people from dying here, can we? It’s a battlefield after all.”\nIs that why the atmosphere is like that?\nIs that why…it’s a pointless worry?\nI’m sure we were talking about the atmosphere here.\nBut somehow, it felt like he pierced my essence.\n“Oh dear, I’m sorry. I guess I’m getting old. I tend to ramble on when I meet young folks I can connect with.”\n“We’re a bit late because of that.”\n“I’m sorry. They’ll understand if you tell them this old man was holding you up. Go on now.”\n“Yes. Let’s get going.”\nEven as I left my seat following Ha-Yul’s instructions, the Commander’s words lingered in my mind.\nA pointless worry, huh.\n***\n“Hmm.”\nThe Commander wondered if this would be enough. He hopes it helps even a little.\n“There are beings that toy with the world, beings that the human perspective cannot possibly fathom…”\nIt would be shocking to learn that such a being has been arbitrarily changing the common sense of this world on a whim.\nSince childhood, everything he learned about this world’s common sense and history had apparently been altered by an otherworldly existence.\nHe never imagined the incident 500 years ago only happened a few months prior.\nFor someone who solely knows that truth or senses such an existence every day…\nPerhaps it’s only natural they can’t see people as such.\nBut even after learning that fact, he doesn’t change.\nEven if his memories are warped based on that point in time, it doesn’t make him any less himself.\n“I just hope that boy can cheer her up a bit…”\nThe only lifeline for a girl whose mind is broken from solely shouldering the truth of the world.\nOnly that boy can save that girl.\nSighs of pity repeatedly escaped.\nThey say God doesn’t play dice.\nThose words were right.\nThey played pranks instead.",

      "content": "*Siwoo POV\n“It’s quite a sight.”\n“So this is the front line…”\nLooking around, a completely different landscape from a moment ago unfolded before us.\nWhile the atmosphere was slightly rigid due to security, it was a place where people lived, quite unlike the quarters.\nThe buildings that would have soared high into the sky were now skeletal remains covered in dust and dirt.\nThe city that would have shone brightly in various colors now looked dull and gray, as if witnessing the end of the world.\n“Surprised, cuties?”\n“Of course, we’d be surprised to see this… It’s as if…”\n“The city you lived in was destroyed?”\n“Yes.”\nI know that’s not entirely true.\nWhile many buildings have collapsed here and there, some remain standing, not yet felled.\nBrushing away the dust obscuring the letters, I saw an advertisement slogan.\nAn ordinary event slogan, except for the date being hundreds of years ago.\nIf the architectural style differed, could I have accepted it as a story from a novel or movie?\nI’m not sure, but I thought it would at least be less shocking than it is now.\nThe sight of skyscrapers that once soared towards the sky now bent and broken felt like the city I lived in until a few days ago had transformed like this.\n“Everyone feels that way at first. But soon, you’ll realize with your own bodies that this place is different from where you lived.”\n“Huh? What do you…”\n“I’ll head back to the main force. You can handle searching the area, right? I’ll be watching to see the juniors’ skills.”\n“Wait a minute!”\nI tried to stop the woman who was hugging and rubbing against me during the meeting from leaving us.\nHowever, she kept walking as if she had nothing more to say.\n“Different?”\n“Ugh, why is she trying to scare us like that? Creepy.”\nHearing the unbelievable, I turned my head.\nPerhaps noticing my expression, Amelia looked at me with a sulky face.\n“What? Why are you looking at me like that?”\n“So there are things you’re scared of.”\n“You! How exactly do you see me, Siwoo?! Of course there are scary things!”\nNo, I thought you were someone with nothing to fear, given how you act with your father…\n“Excuse me, Siwoo. No matter how close you are to a woman…”\n“Woman? You??”\n“Hey?!”\n“…”\nI turned my head slightly at Dorothy’s dumbfounded gaze.\nIt hadn’t even been ten seconds since I started talking before I insulted her.\nBut I hope she understands.\nSee Amelia as a woman? I absolutely can’t do that.\nI’d sooner call a mannequin feminine.\n“Do you sense anything with your Intuition right now?”\n“No, not yet. Nothing in particular.”\nArte, who seemed to be in a good mood for some reason, asked me.\nWhat’s this?\nShe clearly ruminated after talking about something unknown with the Commander.\nWas it nothing important?\nI was planning to properly ask later, thinking she might have heard something bad.\nFortunately, she seemed fine.\nOr so I thought, until the moment I felt a sudden sensation and spoke in a voice that sounded urgent even to my own ears.\n“Everyone, get down!”\n“?!”\nSwish!\nA sharp-looking thorn that narrowly passed over our heads got stuck in the wall of a building barely maintaining its shape.\nThe building on the verge of collapse naturally couldn’t withstand that level of impact.\nWith a huge roar, the building began to crumble, spewing out dust and dirt.\n“What the heck is this now?”\nAmelia muttered in disbelief.\nWhat would have happened if they hadn’t listened to me?\nSeeing that scene, Dorothy’s face turned pale as if that thought occurred to her.\n“Wha- what?!”\n“Where did it come from?”\n“There, behind the statue on that building.”\n“Got it.”\nAs expected of Arte.\nShe skillfully untied the thread on her gloves and accurately shot the thread at the location I specified, smiling.\n“Caught you, you vile thing.”\nAs if playing tug-of-war, Arte lowered her stance.\nI marveled briefly at her ability to support her body with a single thin thread.\nIn the distance, something black began to be dragged over.\n“Kieeeek!”\n“Die!”\nAnd as soon as its location was exposed, Amelia quickly approached and struck its head down with her spear, ending it.\nIt was an absurd death, unlike the sharp surprise attack.\n“A spider?”\n“No, is it really a spider?”\n“But it looks like a spider.”\nPerhaps thinking everything was over, the three began discussing what exactly the creature that ambushed us was.\nIt certainly looked like a spider to anyone…\nBut to call it a spider, it was large and had sharp thorns on its back.\n“I guess this is what it shot?”\n“Probably. Hmm, it has a unique appearance.”\n“It looks sharp. Could it be used as a spear?”\n“I don’t really want to use something so gross as a weapon…”\n“As long as it works, it doesn’t matter if it’s gross.”\nSeeing them quickly regain their senses and converse despite the shock, they really aren’t ordinary people.\nStill, now wasn’t the time to have this conversation.\n“Get ready, guys. There’s more to come.”\n“Eh? More?”\n“The building.”\n“…Ah, damn it.”\nIt was good that we dodged, but the problem was that the thorn happened to hit a building that was about to collapse.\nThat building crumbled with a tremendous noise that would have reverberated through the surroundings.\nIt’s no surprise animals fled out of it.\n“They came quickly.”\n“Wow, how many are there?”\n“Who knows… Looks like quite a lot.”\nBut these things aren’t ordinary animals.\nI didn’t think they would run away from this noise.\nAs if proving that thought wasn’t wrong, numerous enlarged animals slowly walked towards us.\nThey look hideous.\n“Monsters are monsters indeed… Ugh, I won’t be able to eat meat for a while.”\n“You? Really??”\n“I’m really curious, Siwoo. What kind of person am I in your head?”\n“Enough. Get ready. Looks like it’s about to start.”\n“I’m seriously not letting you off later…”\n***\n“Arte, at three o’clock!”\n“Don’t worry.”\n“Hey, Amelia! That’s enough! Get out quickly! It’s dangerous!”\n“I’m still going strong?!”\n“Stop talking nonsense and get out! Hurry!”\n“Ugh, damn it! Fine!”\n“Dorothy!”\n“I’m retaking the buffs! Who should I give it to next?!”\n“To Arte!”\nLionel let out an exclamation at the sight before his eyes.\nThey’re handling it much better than he thought.\n“How is it?”\n“Amazing. That’s my daughter for you.”\n“I didn’t come here to hear you brag about your daughter.”\n“Oh, you already know, so why are you asking?”\n“Anyway… These kids are a problem because they don’t even bother answering. Ugh, kids these days…”\n“Kids these days, you say. We’re just too old. Those are the kids these days.”\nLionel couldn’t take his eyes off his daughter.\nThe daughter he felt sorry for not being able to stay with for long since childhood.\nThe child who was like a sore thumb had already grown up so much.\nJust as she used to tease him and run away, she moved nimbly among the monsters, drawing their attention as much as possible.\nWhen they tried to ignore her, she annoyingly poked them with her spear, an admirable and irksome sight.\nHe’s somehow empathizing with the monsters.\nIs it because he used to be on the receiving end?\n“Don’t think anything weird.”\n“Hehe… Well, it’s amazing. Even if we don’t go, those kids can handle it on their own, right?”\n“Hmm.”\n“Considering how he immediately noticed the surprise attack and located the monster’s position, his tracking ability seems sufficiently proven.”\n“Good. That’s enough.”\n“Yes. Let’s go, guys! We’ve seen enough of the juniors’ skills!”\nAmelia, who looks much more like her mother than Lionel, was sweating as she moved, looking so admirable.\nHe continued to watch his daughter until the surrounding situation was completely resolved.\n***\n“Hmm.”\nNot yet. It’s not time yet.\nThe Reader’s emotions haven’t been stirred. This much isn’t enough.\nSurely, this battle will make her a bit closer to the Protagonist, but it’s clear that the emotion couldn’t be called love.\nHer pounding heart is merely due to the battle.\nThe feelings of love haven’t sprouted enough yet.\nNo, saying they haven’t sprouted is a lie.\nThey have sprouted but are being ignored.\nLying to one’s own feelings.\n“Just a bit, a tiny bit more…”\nBut just a tiny bit.\nJust take a few more steps.\nBecause she can feel the Reader’s heartbeat quickening when she looks at the Protagonist.\nShe just hasn’t realized it yet herself. Her emotions, just a little bit more.\nThe moment they’re stimulated even a tiny bit, there will be no way to back down.\nThe pure girl stared intently at the world, openly showing her excitement as she eagerly awaited that moment.",

      "content": "*Siwoo POV\n“Phew…”\n“What’s wrong? Are you hurt somewhere?”\n“It’s not that. Just…”\nLooking around, the sight of fresh blood was everywhere.\nOf course, it’s not human blood.\nThe ones bleeding are the monsters.\nThe people laughing and chatting during the meeting were now slaughtering the monsters as if they had never done so before.\n“Everyone is amazing.”\nI exclaimed, seeing them avoid attacks so skillfully. It made me wonder if they really didn’t have detection-related abilities.\nThey probably don’t have abilities like my Intuition, yet they easily dodged attacks coming from behind, making me suddenly feel a sense of inferiority.\nEveryone can dodge well, even without their abilities.\nWas I perhaps unnecessary?\nI thought I would protect Arte, but maybe that was arrogant of me.\nSeeing the people easily handle the enemies that gave me a harder time than expected, such thoughts came to mind.\nSo, without realizing it, I blurted out my thoughts.\n“That’s a pointless worry, friend.”\n“Ah. Hello.”\n“Dad, why are you here again? Not working?”\n“This dad is a more expensive existence than you think, daughter. Let others handle tasks like that.”\n“Old geezer…”\n“Hey now.”\nThey’re always fighting, aren’t they?\nI blankly watched the two about to argue, but then Lionel seemed to remember something and grabbed my shoulder.\n“Everyone has those thoughts when they first come here. But kid, that’s arrogance.”\n“Arrogance?”\n“Those people have lived on this battlefield for a long time, unlike you.”\n“…”\n“So there’s no need for you to feel inferior.”\nI know.\nI’m just a student at best, and they have spent a long time on this battlefield.\nIt’s only natural for them to be stronger than me, and if I were stronger than them, it could be unfair to those people.\nBut I couldn’t accept it.\nEven if it meant making the whole world my enemy, I had to be able to protect Arte.\nThat was my promise and resolution.\nSo, seeing their overwhelming performance, I couldn’t acknowledge the fact that I was weaker than them.\n“Doesn’t seem like you’re willing to listen?”\n“Because I made a resolution.”\n“Resolution?”\nThe executive of the Übermensch who displayed overwhelming power.\nThe one who controlled the wind would have been easily subdued by them if she were here.\nCome to think of it, it’s only natural.\nIf they had the power to defeat those people, they wouldn’t have been hiding.\nSo it was obvious that I, who nearly died to a single villain, was still weak compared to them.\nIt’s obvious, but…\n“No matter what happens, there’s someone I want to protect.”\nDespite that, Siwoo made up his mind to protect Arte.\nSo, the inferiority I felt was due to my own weakness and laziness.\nThis should be enough. If I steadily get stronger, I should be able to protect Arte.\nI became ashamed of myself for thinking that way.\nBeing steady wasn’t enough.\nArte said that if the Author gets serious, the world might be destroyed.\nIt was Arte herself who said that, not anyone else.\nSo I thought I believed her, but…\nDeep down, I couldn’t believe it, thinking it was an absurd story.\nIf I truly believed her words, I would have worked even harder.\nI would have trained harder to stop the existence tormenting Arte that might destroy the world.\n“Is today’s schedule over with this?”\n“Yeah. From now on, it’s break time.”\n“Got it.”\nSiwoo decided to cast off his laziness.\nIf there really is an existence that can destroy the world and torment Arte…\nThen, he had to become someone who could turn the world into an enemy.\nOnly then could he free Arte from that existence.\n***\n“He always tells me I’m crazy, but he doesn’t realize he’s not normal either.”\n“…”\nLionel watched Siwoo’s back as he headed towards the quarters with a determined expression.\nIt was as his daughter said.\nHe’s not in his right mind.\n“Saying that’s not enough…”\nIf he told this to people who didn’t hear those words, they would surely mock him and tell him to stop talking nonsense.\nBecause no one at that age has ever achieved as much as he has.\nThe genius of the century.\nAn untouchable existence among his peers.\nIn Lionel’s eyes, Siwoo and his colleagues were such children.\nIn fact, Lionel and the main force were preparing to evacuate them just before the monsters’ ambush started.\nWhy?\nIt was a welcoming ceremony.\nNo matter how short-staffed the front lines are, they don’t assign missions to new recruits alone. They’re not crazy.\nThere’s no way they would take such a dangerous action that might cost precious lives like flies.\nThe reason they were separated was to assess their abilities.\nTo gauge the combat capabilities of the only available tracking ability user.\nThat’s why they were preparing to go support them…\nAnd when they realized there was no need, everyone was shocked.\nConsidering that most people entering the battlefield for the first time are busy running away in panic and fear, these guys’ skills were already proven.\nThey’re just students at best.\nFour newcomers who had just set foot on the battlefield for the first time were slowly but surely slaughtering a horde of monsters, leaving everyone dumbfounded.\n“Is your friend thinking of slaying even the gods?”\n“I don’t know.”\nLionel was amazed to see the guy, who seemed like he would run wild once he got used to the battlefield, making some kind of resolution while saying he lacked.\n“Still, he’s a romantic fellow.”\nHaving someone he wants to protect.\nNo matter how much Lionel thought about it, only one person came to mind.\n“Is it that girl? The sharp-looking one with black hair.”\n“Arte? That’s right.”\n“As expected.”\nLionel clicked his tongue in regret.\n“Why isn’t my daughter catching a guy like that? Daughter, even now…”\n“Are you crazy? Why would I date a guy like that? I’m way too good for him.”\n“Yeah, yeah. I didn’t expect much anyway.”\nHe had hoped a little that he might become his son-in-law, like the protagonist in the novels he’s been enjoying lately.\nBut seeing his daughter’s reaction, it’s a no-go.\nWhen will he be able to see his grandchildren?\nWith her easygoing personality, he felt his future was already bleak, as if he might not even live to see his grandchildren.\n“You’re not thinking something weird again, are you?”\n“My, my. What do you take your dad for?”\n“A dad who reads weird novels.”\n“Weird, you say! You just don’t know the charm…”\n***\nA city dyed completely in shades of gray.\nAmong the collapsed buildings, a girl and a huge dog were walking.\n“It’s noisy.”\n“The sounds are filled with screams and groans, Annie. There must have been a battle.”\n“Battle…”\n“Grrrr…”\nThe dog the girl was petting was openly showing discomfort as it glared at the place where the noise was coming from.\nWhile monsters sometimes fight here, it’s rare for them to roam around in groups like this.\nAnd there’s only one case where monsters show such discomfort.\n“The Association bastards?”\n“Seems like it, Annie. They might be chasing us.”\n“I see. As expected, Mir is smart.”\nThe Association.\nThat detestable name made her teeth grind.\nThey keep getting in their way.\nBoth when the Übermensch were around and now.\nThey always keep us on the ground.\n“We haven’t been able to reduce people since then…”\n“It’s because of that guy back then, Annie. We should have found and killed him quickly.”\n“…”\nThe Association bastards were always troublesome.\nNow that we’ve gained power, ambushing and killing a few gathered heroes right after a battle was easy.\nSo they killed them.\nBut was that a mistake?\nRealizing her existence, they started sticking together in large groups without considering time delays.\nThey might be able to kill one or two…\nBut at that moment, they’d be surrounded and captured by the others.\nThat mustn’t happen.\nBecause they can’t die until they achieve equality for all.\n“What should we do…”\nHow can they sow confusion among those guys?\nHiding in the front lines to get stronger was good, but…\nThey can’t even leave because of it.\nThey almost got caught even while sneaking in. Going out with such a large companion is nearly impossible.\n“What should we do…”\nWhat’s the way to blend in among those guys and escape?\nThe girl pondered for a long time as she walked.\n“Grrr!”\n“Hm? What’s wrong?”\n“Grrr!”\nAnd the moment she was about to enter a building…\nThe monster that had been with her all along began to refuse to enter.\n“You’re scared? Why?”\n“This place is dangerous, L…”\nOther monsters would have sensed this ominous mana and instinctively avoided it.\nEven the monster that had been sticking close to the girl did so.\nBut the girl didn’t.\nBecause curiosity took precedence over instinct.\n“What is in there…”\nCuriosity kills the cat.\nWas there such a saying?\nThe girl decided to dismiss it as nonsense.\nBecause the key to escaping this place was there.\n“Found it. The way.”\nInside the building where the giant spider’s corpse was slowly rotting…\nAn uncountable number of cocoons were scattered, making entering difficult.",

      "content": "“···Ah, did you sleep well?”\n“Yeah.”\n“They say there’s nothing planned for today, so why don’t we all relax together...”\n“Sorry. I have a busy day ahead. I need to train.”\n“Oh, I see…”\nTraining.\nGiven how much Siwoo and his friends struggled yesterday, I thought they might need a bit of rest.\nEven though they’re the protagonists, a large-scale battle for the first time must have been exhausting.\nMoreover, after talking with Amelia’s father, he seemed to be in a bad mood.\nThat's why I asked Hayul to prepare some snacks, but suddenly training?\nI was taken aback but decided to try to persuade Siwoo one more time.\n“We’ve prepared delicious snacks. You’ll regret missing out.”\n“That sounds tempting, but I’m sorry. Today is a bit... maybe next time.”\n“That’s a shame.”\nSeeing Siwoo's polite refusal, I knew there was no point in pressing further. He wasn’t going to join us for the get-together.\nI wanted to spend time with him.\nIt wasn’t for any other reason; he wanted to train. Persuading him to hang out felt wrong, like asking a friend to go to a PC cafe while they’re studying hard for exams.\nSiwoo is the protagonist.\nSince he’s determined to work hard, there was no need to hinder him.\n“Then, please do your best.”\n“Have fun.”\n“…”\nBut, I couldn’t help feeling disappointed.\nSpending time with Amelia and Dorothy was good, but it would have been much more enjoyable if Siwoo was with us.\nI absentmindedly stroked my bracelet.\nI felt a bit lonely, but stroking the bracelet made me feel a little better.\n···About two weeks passed.\nBy now, I’d gotten used to the front line accommodations. It was an ordinary day, fighting off third-class beasts attacking occasionally, nothing like the large-scale assault on the first day.\nToday, as usual, I was eating with Amelia and Dorothy.\n···Or rather, eating snacks with alcohol.\nBoom! “Isn’t that too much?!”\n“Calm down, Arte. You’re going to break the table.”\n“I am calm!”\n“You seem pretty angry though…”\nAngry? That’s a misunderstanding.\nI was perfectly fine.\nI wasn’t angry at all.\n“···Dorothy. What’s Arte’s boyfriend doing right now?”\n“She’ll deny it if Arte hears you.”\n“She won’t hear it, will she? Look, no reaction. She was already half-drunk before we even got here.”\nMy head was pounding, and Amelia’s hand waved in front of my face, snapping me back to reality.\nUgh, my head hurts.\nGet that hand away.\n“I’m still fine…”\n“Yes, you look fine. So? You seem to know well. Siwoo calls you sometimes, doesn’t he?”\n“That’s what bothers me. You don’t know how sharp Arte’s glares are. At first, I thought she’d kill me.”\n“Just seeing that makes you look like a couple to everyone.”\n···What are they saying? I can’t hear well.\nMy vision was spinning.\nMy heart started pounding, and my face had already been burning like it was on fire.\nI touched my cheeks, feeling the heat, and quickly pressed my face against the cool glass of my cup.\nAh, that’s better.\n“Gulp, gulp... Phew! Nothing weird happened, as Arte thinks. It was just part of the training.”\n“Really?”\n“After using my ability, I felt like I grasped something. A certainty that I could grow stronger. That’s what he said.”\n“What’s that about? I’ve never experienced that.”\n“Me neither. Siwoo must be a genius, or his enhanced intuition told him. One of the two.”\n“···Hmm. Interesting.”\nI stared blankly at the water droplets falling from the bottle.\nAh, this is more fun than I thought.\nI laughed, touching the falling droplets with my fingers.\n[Ahhh... reader. Please, stop...]\nWith my heart pounding faster than usual, I felt my blood being pumped through my body.\nI could feel the position of my heart.\nFeeling better, I took another drink.\nAmelia, watching me, muttered something.\n“That guy, he’s clearly inexperienced in relationships. Instead of comforting his upset girlfriend, he’s training again today?”\n“But... it’s for Arte…”\n“There’s a limit to that. At first, I thought he’d learned how to pull, but this is the result?”\n“···.”\n[Reader... Please stop drinking...!]\nHmph.\nThere’s no need to listen to the author’s words.\nAccording to the author, I’m the reader!!!\nReaders don’t listen to the author! From today on, I’ll become a problematic reader!\n[Ahhhh... Stop! Please stop! It feels weird...]\n“He’s so oblivious to his girlfriend being upset, huh.”\n“···That is a bit true.”\n“And he’s still drinking the supply alcohol without noticing Arte’s state.”\nAmelia clicked her tongue, looking at me, now half-asleep.\nI was lonely, wanting to spend time with Siwoo.\nBut Siwoo was training hard. He didn’t spend time with me.\nSo I didn’t say anything...\nAnd then, boom.\nI exploded, and yet he’s still focused on training.\nHe probably doesn’t even know this happened.\n“I can’t believe I’m stuck taking care of these guys without a relationship of my own...”\n“Ha ha...”\n“Ugh, is this my fate?”\nI thought everything would work out fine.\nMaybe we’d understand each other’s feelings here. I thought so.\nBut instead of understanding, we grew a bit distant, making me furious.\nThese frustrating kids.\nJust...\nKiss on the lips, huh? Do some of those unspeakable things together?\nWouldn’t that be nice?\nEven though I’ve never been in a relationship, I can tell Arte only needs to push a bit more, and he’d fall.\nWhat a frustrating guy.\nI chewed out Siwoo, the handsome face not here.\n“Ugh... Sniff... Why, whyyyy... Was it my fault?”\n“Damn it.”\nFeeling like my insides were burning, Amelia took another drink.\nSeeing Arte like this, she wanted to say something to Siwoo.\nBut it was all for Arte’s sake, which made it harder.\nHe had resolved something, training like crazy, but...\nIt was obvious even without seeing it.\nI was there when he made his resolution.\nHe probably thought, “I’m weak, but I’ll get stronger and protect Arte!”\nFine, fine, but...\nLooking at the future, he’s missing the present.\n“Then, how about this?”\n“What is it?”\n“If Siwoo can’t see Arte’s loneliness...”\n“Phew...”\nDragging my exhausted body, I headed to the quarters.\nI was on the brink of collapse from the continuous training, but I knew I wouldn’t fall.\nMy intuition told me exactly how far to push myself for the most effective training.\n“It’s a shame Dorothy isn’t here.”\nWith her, the training efficiency skyrockets.\nShe enhances my abilities, adding strain to my body.\n...Which, conversely, means it’s like temporarily increasing my muscles.\nBy getting used to the temporarily enhanced abilities, I felt myself growing faster.\n“Didn’t Arte say she’d spend time with Amelia?”\nThey should’ve parted ways by now.\nAt this late hour, they’d probably be asleep.\nReturning to the quarters, I quietly opened the door, careful not to wake Arte.\n“Ugh, what’s this...”\nA strong smell of alcohol filled the room.\n...They’ve been drinking.\nI knew there were a few bottles in the supplies. They must have had those.\nIt’s nice they cleaned up, but couldn’t they at least have ventilated...\n“?!”\n“Hehe, you’re back...”\nSquelch.\nMaybe because of my exhausted body, my intuition reacted too late.\nBefore I could avoid it, the drunken presence hugged me tightly.\n“Arte, wait... wait. You’re drunk...”\n“I was so lonelyyyy...”\nMemories of Arte back-hugging me at the academy flashed, making my face blush as I tried to pull her away.\nBut hearing her whine, I hesitated.\n“You never talk to me... Always busy...”\n“That’s because...”\nI just wanted to protect you.\nI just wanted to help you.\nI wanted to say those things, but I couldn’t.\nThey were excuses.\nI realized I had left her so lonely she clung to me like this.\n“Hehe. It’s okay. I’ll forgive you.”\n“···.”\n“Because you’ll stay with me eventually...”\nHearing her soft breathing, I tried to carry her to the bed.\nShe must have been asleep, but her grip was too tight to move her.\n...Looks like I’ll have to sleep together.\nWith a sigh, I spoke into the air.\n“You guys should sleep too. I won’t do anything weird.”\nThere was no response.\nBut I could tell they were startled and ran away.\nDid they really think they wouldn’t get caught?\nHow much interest do they have in my relationship with Arte?\n“Sorry, Arte. I didn’t take good care of you.”\nWith her face flushed red, I moved Arte to the bed.\nIn the past, this would have been awkward, keeping me awake all night.\nNow, it feels quite familiar.\n“···.”\nAfter a moment of hesitation, I put my arm around Arte’s waist and closed my eyes.\nThis much indulgence is okay.\nThrough the smell of alcohol, I could feel the scent of someone I liked.",

      "content": "“Ugh, my head…”\nAs soon as I woke up, I grabbed my pounding head.\nIt felt like my head was being pricked with sharp objects.\nAlong with the headache, my mouth felt so dry that it was almost uncomfortable.\n…Water, I need water.\n“Ugh, water…”\nI tried to get up to find some water to quench my parched throat.\nThat was, until something prevented me from getting up.\n“…Huh?”\nThud, thud.\nStill not fully awake, my mind was foggy.\n…Honestly, I wanted to sleep a little more.\nI planned to drink some water and then lie back down with my eyes closed.\nBut my body wouldn’t move as if I were strapped in by a seatbelt, filling me with confusion and irritation.\nThis wasn’t something in the quarters.\nWhat was this?\nThinking that, I opened my eyes to remove the obstacle in frustration…\nAnd my eyes widened.\nI realized what the situation was.\n“Wh-Wh-What the…!”\nWhat was going on?\nI forgot all about getting up and just opened and closed my mouth for a while.\nThe reason I couldn’t move was…\nLooking down, I saw Siwoo’s arm wrapped around me.\n“Hi-Hiiiik…!”\nWhat should I do, what should I do, what should I do, what should I do, what should I do?\nHow do I get out of this? How do I get out without Siwoo noticing?\nWhat did I do last night?!\nI tried to remember yesterday’s events with my eyes closed, feigning calmness, but it was no use.\n…I couldn’t remember anything.\n“We definitely drank together…”\nAnd then I have no memory.\nI thought I had a rough idea of my drinking limits when we drank together last time.\nDid I not hold back? Or was it stronger?\nNo, that’s not the important thing right now.\nWaking up on the opposite gender’s bed after a blackout…\nThe information hitting my brain made me break out in a cold sweat and turn pale.\n…Did we do it?\nDid we really do it?\nNo way.\nEven so…right?\nI tried to confirm by getting up, but Siwoo’s arm didn’t budge.\n“Ugh…”\nI could use magic to forcefully remove his arm.\n…But that would wake Siwoo up.\nWhat would he say if he saw this situation?\nI was afraid of what Siwoo might say.\nSo I couldn’t force my way out and had to stay in Siwoo’s embrace for a long time.\n…Ah, it’s warm.\n“…”\nWas it because I had been relying on the bracelet for a while?\nOr was it the relief of not being abandoned in Siwoo’s embrace?\nOr maybe it was because I was lying in a warm bed, shielded from the cold morning air?\nFeeling the comforting warmth, I stopped struggling to get out.\n…Yeah.\nWas there really a need to get out?\nI was a bit thirsty, but it wasn’t unbearable.\nIt’s been cold in the mornings recently because of the changing seasons.\nIf I went out now and woke up completely, it would be disappointing.\nI was a bit tired, too.\nAccording to a book I read before coming to this world, your back hurts the day after doing such things.\n…I don’t feel any pain, and it’s Siwoo, so it should be fine.\nFeeling a bit uncomfortable, I adjusted my position.\n“…Still asleep?”\nLooking at Siwoo from different angles, he didn’t seem awake, so I decided he was still asleep.\n…In that case.\nIsn’t it normal to shift a bit while sleeping?\nYeah, that’s right.\nLike hugging a body pillow, I adjusted my position and hugged him once.\nIt didn’t feel soft and fluffy like a pillow.\nIt felt hard because of his well-trained muscles.\nSo it should have been uncomfortable.\nIt should have been uncomfortable, but…\nWhy does it feel so comfortable?\n“…”\n…I don’t know.\nI still don’t know.\nI decided to think that way.\nTo feel more of his warmth, I hugged him closer.\nIt’s warm.\nI postponed thinking about how Siwoo might react when he woke up.\nIf he’s flustered…yeah.\nSiwoo had left me alone for a while.\nI should think of this as his punishment.\nAs I closed my eyes, I felt my heart pounding clearly.\nAfter a short while.\n…When my heartbeat gradually slowed and my breathing became regular.\nSiwoo, who had been motionless, opened his eyes.\n“…Phew, I almost got caught.”\n“…Is that true?”\n“Yeah, it’s true. Satisfied?”\nI wondered why Siwoo had called Dorothy and me after a long time.\nHearing Siwoo’s words, Dorothy and I jumped with joy.\n“See! Dorothy, you’re a genius!”\n“Huh, I am pretty smart. Would you call me a genius of love?”\n“Of course!”\n“You’ve never been in a relationship…”\n“Be quiet!”\nAnyway, that guy is clueless.\nDoes intuition not help with awareness?\n“You should’ve just gone for it, but that’s a bit disappointing…”\n“That’s a crime…”\n“What are you talking about? If it’s consensual, it’s not a crime.”\nArte is always silently suffering while agonizing over things.\nI told him that myself, yet he still hasn’t noticed?\nHe’s just denying it to himself, but Arte is already in love with Siwoo.\nIf he acted like a man and just took the plunge, there would be no problem.\nShe might struggle at first, but if he whispered sweet nothings, she’d give in quickly.\nImagining Siwoo hugging Arte and whispering love, Amelia shook her head.\nThis innocent guy would never do that.\nThough Amelia thought it was the quickest way, she knew he would never do such a thing.\n…It’s frustrating, but well.\nIt’s something we can help with.\n“You know Arte’s been really lonely because of you, right?”\n“…Ugh.”\n“That’s why she drank so much.”\n“What are you trying to say?”\n“It’s simple. Just stick by Arte’s side today.”\nIt’s impossible to get this overly considerate guy to make a move on Arte.\nSo there’s only one answer.\nMake Arte make a move on him.\nOf course, Arte herself isn’t fully aware of her feelings, so it’s a bit tricky.\nBut conversely, once she becomes aware of her feelings, everything will be solved.\n“Stick with her. She’s been having a hard time.”\n“Is that all?”\n“Yeah. She hugged you tightly this morning, didn’t she?”\n“…Alright.”\nThere’s no guarantee Arte will make a move on Siwoo.\n…I didn’t think that at all.\nBecause with Arte’s strong jealousy and possessiveness, there’s no way she wouldn’t.\nThe only reason she hasn’t done anything yet is that she doesn’t realize she likes Siwoo.\nThe look on her face when Siwoo was sticking with Dorothy recently.\nDorothy was so scared of her expression that she had to explain herself.\n…Not that Arte believed her.\nAnd the way she glared at the senior who was talking to her for the sake of camaraderie.\nAmelia was convinced.\nOnce Arte realized she liked Siwoo, something big would happen.\nThough she wanted to see it herself…\nArte would surely kill her out of jealousy, so she had to give up.\nA bit disappointing.\n“…By the way, is Arte resting today?”\n“I put her to sleep. She seemed really tired.”\n“Of course. She drank so much yesterday.”\n“Right.”\nHe’s considerate in these ways too.\nIt’s a bit disappointing that Arte is missing, but…\nIt seems Siwoo has a rough idea of where the target is.\nToday, we’ll just scout the surroundings.\nThe main force will be waiting nearby.\n“Make sure to stay with Arte. Got it?”\n“I got it.”\n“Ugh, my head is spinning…”\nHow long has it been since I felt this dizzy?\nThe first day the reader opened their eyes in this world.\nIt feels like the first time since then.\nLast time, they seemed to hold back a bit while drinking, but today they just let loose.\nThe pounding heart made it a bit tough.\n“…Ugh, but it’s almost over. Just a bit more.”\nSeeing the protagonist making my heart race like this, it really feels like just a bit more.\nA little more push, and it’ll be certain.\nThe girl smiled brightly, thinking.\n“It’s about time to send it!”\nThe bracelet the protagonist gave to the reader as a gift.\nIt seemed to contain magic, likely from a beast.\nIf it’s a web-spinning beast, it’s probably a spider, right?\nSo I thought.\nWhat if the spider laid many eggs before dying?\n“A revenge of the grown spiders!”\nThere’s even a marker in the form of a bracelet.\nThe spiders, instinctively recognizing their parent’s magic, would seek revenge on humans.\nWouldn’t that be a perfectly plausible and exciting attack?\nThe protagonist even put the reader to sleep and left.\nRealizing the protagonist’s absence, the reader would rush to the battlefield.\nWith a bit of timing adjustment, an interesting scene might unfold.\nThe girl smiled brightly.\nShe thought this time it would really work well.",

      "content": "\"How are you feeling today?\"\n\"Oh, senior. Everything seems fine.\"\n\"Really? That’s good to hear.\"\n\"If this keeps up, we should be able to find it within a few days.\"\nSiwoo responded to the senior who had approached him while looking around.\nThe senior seemed to like Siwoo and Arte, as he had been talking to them since the meeting.\nToday, this senior was going to be with us instead of Arte.\n\"By the way, why is she sleeping in today? What’s the reason?\"\n\"She drank. She has a hangover.\"\n\"Drank? Oh, I see. It’s because of you, isn’t it?\"\n\"···.\"\n\"Treat her well. She’s mad because her boyfriend isn’t spending time with her.\"\nI let out a small sigh.\nSeeing how the senior, the information hub here, was saying this, it seemed the rumors had spread quite a bit.\n\"We’re not dating yet.\"\n\"Sure, sure. Do your best. She’s pretty.\"\nHe didn’t believe me at all.\nDid he realize I was uncomfortable?\nThe senior changed the subject smoothly.\n\"Anyway, I really don’t get it. Are we really looking for something? Aren’t we just walking?\"\n\"We are just walking.\"\n\"···Then how do you know where to go?\"\n\"Instinct.\"\nHow else could I explain it?\nInstinct.\nThat’s the only way to put it.\nHow else could I describe the feeling of knowing the direction without any clues?\nI felt a bit sorry for the senior who looked baffled, but it was the truth.\n\"···You know my ability is intuition, right?\"\n\"I knew that... but I thought you’d get some kind of hint.\"\n\"That’s not it. I just feel like I know.\"\n\"···Is that really detection?\"\n\"I don’t know.\"\nIt was natural for the senior to question it.\nAs far as I knew, it was impossible to use detection abilities in this way.\nLooking around, all I saw was a city painted in gray.\nBut for those with detection abilities, it would look different.\nThey would see the footprints of beasts, scattered fur, or even smell the scents.\nOr perhaps they’d see the distribution of mana floating in the air.\nMost detection ability users are like that.\nFrom limited clues, they gather much more detailed and precise information than others.\nAnd they draw conclusions based on the collected information.\n…This is the biggest difference between me and other detection ability users.\nTo me, this city was just a destroyed gray city.\nNothing more, nothing less.\nFor detection ability users, this place was a treasure trove of information, but for me, it was just a background.\nEven though my senses were sharper than average, that was all.\nI couldn’t compare to those with related abilities.\nYet, I could tell.\nI was more confident than the detection ability users.\nThey make guesses based on information. That’s why there’s a possibility they could go in the wrong direction.\nBut Siwoo was certain. This direction was correct. The person we were looking for would be here.\nWe would meet them soon.\n\"I think of it as something that can also be used for detection.\"\nWhile training with Dorothy’s enhancement, Siwoo suddenly realized.\nHis ability wasn’t just mere intuition.\nThe amount of information that directly struck his brain was too much to just call it intuition.\nIf it was merely intuition, how could he receive so much information?\nThe more Siwoo trained and grew every day, the more solid this idea became.\nWhen he put all his effort into landing a blow on that villain, he had seen a vision.\nAnd lately, that vision was becoming clearer.\nEven with a single enhancement, he could glimpse it.\nWhat would happen a few seconds later.\nWhat would be the result of his actions, it felt like he could see it beforehand.\nPrecognition of the future?\nMaybe.\nBut it felt a bit different.\n\"Well, I don’t know much, but our job is to complete the mission, right?\"\n\"Yes, that’s true.\"\n\"How about now? Do you feel anything?\"\n\"Yes. Probably in about two days…\"\n…My intuition sounded an alarm.\nSomething felt critically wrong.\nIt felt like the premise itself was wrong.\n\"···? What’s wrong?\"\n\"···.\"\nI had felt this sensation before.\nThat time.\nWhen I saw that bizarre presence clinging to Arte, I had felt something similar.\nI had felt it a few other times too. A sensation as if the world was twisting.\n…and something always happened then.\nIt was like a precursor to an event.\nDamn it!\n\"Quick, the communicator!\"\n\"Uh, uh…?!\"\n\"Hurry!\"\nKnowing it was rude, I hurriedly snatched the communicator from the senior and tried to send a message.\n\"Main unit, main unit. Respond! This is the search team!\"\n\"···What is it, Siwoo? Didn’t you say there’d be nothing today?\"\n\"Incident, incident! Quickly, be on alert and prepare for battle! Now!\"\n\"···What?\"\n\"There’s no time to explain! Hurry!\"\nThankfully, they seemed to believe my urgent tone.\nI heard the commander issuing hurried orders.\n\"You guys, too…!\"\n\"We’re ready.\"\n\"It’s not our first time. We know what to do.\"\nLuckily, Amelia and Dorothy seemed to notice something was wrong and had started preparing to retreat.\nThese guys could be annoying usually, but they were reliable in danger…\n\"So? Where do we go?\"\n\"To the main unit! We need to join them quickly! If we get separated, I can’t guarantee our survival!\"\n\"Got it.\"\n\"Wait a minute…! What are you doing! You need to explain…\"\nThe senior’s voice trailed off, and his face turned pale.\nHe couldn’t believe what he was seeing.\nNeither could we.\n\"…Is that it?\"\n\"…Probably. No, definitely.\"\n\"Guess no sleep for us tonight…\"\nAnyone would be speechless at the sight before us.\nA black wave.\nThat would be the appropriate term.\nLike a surging wave, a massive swarm of spider beasts was rushing towards us.\n\"Ugh, I’m not good with bugs…\"\nAmelia joked with a bright voice, but there was no hint of playfulness on her face.\nOnly urgency.\n\"Hurry, give me all the luggage. I’ll carry it.\"\n\"…Are you sure?\"\n\"I’m the fastest! Come on! We don’t have time!\"\n\"Sorry. Thanks.\"\n\"I’ll be back!\"\nWith all the luggage except the essentials, Amelia disappeared from sight in an instant.\nIn the past, carrying that much would have slowed her down significantly. She had grown a lot.\nBut there was no time to admire Amelia’s growth.\nWe had to move quickly too.\n\"Hurry, let’s join the main unit! It’s dangerous to stay here!\"\n\"Ugh, yes! Let’s move!\"\nHow many times had I been grateful for my ability?\nI estimated the distance between us and the main unit.\n…No matter how I thought about it, if I had reacted a bit later, only Amelia would have survived.\nThe speed of the spiders was faster than expected.\nTheir small size made them easy to handle individually, but…\nIf we got swept away by that swarm, survival would be impossible.\nIt wasn’t just a few.\nWe decided to join the main unit as quickly as possible.\n\"Ugh…\"\nI frowned at the sunlight piercing through my closed eyes.\nIs it morning already?\nWith a groggy mind, I tried to avoid the sunlight by turning over.\nOh, right. Siwoo was hugging me. I can’t move…\nI thought.\nBut my body moved easily, and I turned my head.\nHuh, why isn’t Siwoo here?\nFeeling uneasy, I got up from the bed to check the time.\nI’ve felt this sensation occasionally.\nEven before coming to this world, I rarely slept well.\nSo I always woke up in a grumpy mood, annoyed that I had to get up.\nBut something was different today.\n…Why does my body feel so light?\nA worst-case scenario flashed through my mind, waking me up completely.\nThere was only one reason I would feel this light.\nI hurriedly checked the time on my phone, confirming my fear.\n\"I’m late…!\"\nMy grogginess disappeared, and my mind became clear instantly.\nIt was already 11 a.m.\n…No wonder my body felt so refreshed.\nRealizing the obvious, I started sweating coldly.\nI was late.\nAnd by a lot.\nWe were supposed to start searching at 9 a.m. today.\nIt was almost lunchtime now.\n\"I-I-I’m late…! Author, why didn’t you wake me up…!\"\n[You only call for me at times like this.]\n\"Isn’t this something you should have woken me up for?!\"\n[Your affection for me has cooled…]\nI wanted to snap at the author, but I held back.\nThere was no time to waste.\n…but I couldn’t help but say this.\n\"I never had any affection for you in the first place!\"\n[L-Lies…!]\nStop denying reality, author.\nWhy would I ever like you, anyway?",

      "content": "\"···What is that?\"\n\"This is insane...\"\nAt that moment, the superhumans, who had been complaining about the sudden orders, were faced with a sight that made them want to rub their eyes and look again.\nThe beasts had appeared.\nAn overwhelming number of beasts, so many it seemed impossible to count.\n\"Is that... a Black Tarantula?\"\n\"No way...!\"\nBeasts also have offspring and continue their lineage.\nThat’s common knowledge.\nIt’s not unusual for such small beasts to attack occasionally.\nWhat’s unusual is the quantity.\nLook at that wave—no, that flood of spiders. That’s the true nature of the Black Tarantula.\nThey give birth to an enormous number of tiny offspring.\nAccording to scholars, they produce an astronomical number of babies.\n...But until now, we’ve never seen it.\nHowever, based on our experiences, we knew it was true.\nAnd that common knowledge was being overturned right before our eyes.\n\"There’s no way that number is possible! According to the Black Tarantula’s nature, this is impossible...!\"\nHumans receive nutrients through an umbilical cord.\nUsually one, sometimes two or three babies are provided with nutrients.\nBut those countless spiders can’t receive nutrients that way. They hatch from eggs.\nSo, how do they get their nutrients?\nHow do those countless baby spiders, gathered in an egg sac, survive?\nHow do they get the nutrients they need after hatching from the sac in a nutrient-deficient environment?\n...The answer is simple.\nThey eat each other as soon as they are born.\nThey supplement their nutrients by cannibalizing, and when the competition ends, only two or three remain.\nThat’s what we knew.\nThat was common knowledge.\nTherefore, these baby spiders are an anomaly.\nWithout cannibalizing, they’d die from lack of nutrients.\nHow is this possible?\nAs the superhumans fell into confusion, a sharp command rang out.\n\"Form ranks! Quickly! There’s no time!\"\n\"...Yes!\"\nThe commander appeared calm and composed, giving orders despite the sudden, abnormal situation.\nAs if he had known about the black wave in advance.\nOf course, he couldn’t have known, but his calm demeanor helped settle the confusion among the heroes, allowing them to start working quickly.\nStill, the commander’s mind was equally troubled.\nThis unprecedented situation was new to him as well.\n\"...\"\nThe commander remained calm partly because of his extensive experience on the battlefield, but also because he had an inkling of the cause.\n\"Is it because of that presence...?\"\nIt had to be.\nHe looked at the children running hurriedly toward them from a distance.\nThe student named Siwoo, who had warned them of the threat.\nHe felt sorry for Siwoo and Arte.\nOne of them wasn’t really a student, but...\nThey were both younger than him, so he considered them students.\nPoor kids.\nThey had caught the attention of a terrible presence and ended up living such turbulent lives.\n\"Protect the students at all costs! They are the future!\"\n\"Isn’t that obvious! Move quickly, kids! We don’t have time!\"\n\"Yes, sir!\"\nEven the criminals who had been mentally absent seemed to realize that fleeing was futile when faced with the sight before them.\nIt was rare to see them working so passionately.\nAs the makeshift barricade was being constructed rapidly, Lionel approached, holding the carcass of a spider.\n...Though they were babies, they were only small compared to adults.\nEach one was about the size of a human.\n\"What’s your estimate?\"\n\"Rank 3 low... no, I estimate them to be Rank 4 beasts. They’re quite soft. Easy to crush, but...\"\n\"We can be easily crushed too.\"\n\"...Yes.\"\nNo matter how soft the carapace of a beast is, it’s still harder than human flesh.\nUnless you have a body-strengthening ability, dodging or deflecting is the best option.\nSo, a large, unavoidable swarm like this is a disaster.\nA single one is not scary.\nEven ten would only be a bit troublesome, and no one here would fear them.\nBut a hundred?\nA thousand?\nAs the ground disappears beneath your feet, eventually, you’ll be engulfed.\nA true tidal wave.\nA disaster that should be called a black wave.\n\"...Sigh.\"\n\"Why are you sighing again? You usually smile so peacefully.\"\n\"Don’t you feel like sighing? Look at that sight. It’s horrific.\"\nThat annoying fellow didn’t answer but smiled.\nI felt a sense of trust emanating from him.\nA feeling that he trusted me to handle this.\n\"...You rascal. You shouldn’t overwork the elderly.\"\n\"Haha. Elderly? What are you talking about? You’re the strongest here.\"\n\"Hmph. Flattery won’t get you any rewards.\"\n\"There are rewards, though. Look.\"\nHe glanced at his daughter, moving so quickly that she was barely visible to us.\n\"...My daughter is in danger. It’s reassuring to have you with us, commander.\"\n\"Tsk. You should act like this more often.\"\n\"Haha.\"\n\"Well, that was lucky.\"\n\"Yeah, Annie. Really lucky.\"\nA girl, covered in rags, smiled brightly.\nThey were indeed fortunate.\nWhen they found these spider friends and saw one egg hatching soon after.\nSeeing them trying to eat each other was shocking.\nLuckily, when I told them to stop, they did, but they complained about being hungry.\nFortunately, there was a spider carcass nearby, so I shared it, and they ate it happily.\nIt was hard to feed the newly hatched spiders for a while, but...\nSeeing this huge number made me feel proud.\n\"They must be very hungry.\"\n\"Yeah, they must be. We couldn’t feed them much in the end.\"\n\"There was no helping it. They were growing so fast.\"\nWhen they were younger, a little food was enough.\nI planned to keep them a bit longer, but there were no more beasts to feed them, so I had no choice.\nAfter a day of starvation, they started to cannibalize, so I quickly pointed them to the food, and look at them run.\nSo cute.\n\"Haha, look at them. They’re so startled.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Now we can achieve our goal, Mir.\"\nWhether they could stop the spiders or not, whether they would all die or not, I didn’t care.\nThey’d be too busy dealing with the spiders to notice a small girl slipping through the front lines.\nI could use this opportunity to achieve the goal we hadn’t been able to with this power.\n\"Mir, finally. We can create the equal world you dreamed of.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Mir? Why aren’t you answering?\"\nAnxiety crept into my voice as Mir didn’t respond.\nDid I make a mistake again?\nBack then, when Mir was taken down.\nI had vowed never to make such a mistake again.\nDid I mess up again?\nAs I was getting nervous, Mir’s reassuring voice came through.\n\"It’s not that, Annie.\"\n\"Then what?\"\n\"It looks familiar.\"\nShe kept mumbling to herself.\nAs if she were talking to someone next to her.\nAs if she were having a conversation with someone.\n\"Looks familiar? What does?\"\n\"That person. I remember seeing them.\"\n\"That person?\"\n\"The man heading towards the main unit.\"\n...Ah.\nI finally understood the discomfort.\nRight, how could I forget?\nNo.\nMaybe I didn’t forget.\nMaybe I just didn’t want to remember.\n\"...Right. How could I forget, Mir? I remember everything.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I clearly remember the day you fell. It’s etched in my mind.\"\n\"...\"\nThat boy.\nI remember him.\nThe one who hindered Mir.\nThe one Mir said she’d handle quickly and told me to go ahead.\n...The one who ruined everything in the end.\n\"Why is he here...?\"\nWasn’t he a student?\nWhy is he in a place like this?\n...Suddenly, I remembered.\nThat girl who killed Mir was also in a school uniform.\nThe thought of quickly escaping had already vanished from my mind.\nI was comparing each face among the crowd.\n\"...She’s not here.\"\nBut my guess was wrong; the face of that hateful girl wasn’t there.\nEven though her distinctive appearance should make her easy to spot.\n\"Well, I guess it makes sense she wouldn’t be here. Let’s go, Mir...?\"\nAs I was about to leave, I saw someone running from a distant building.\nSomeone with hateful black hair and that face.\n\"...\"\nThe moment I saw that face, all the plans in my head vanished.\nPlans, sure. They’re good.\nLet’s make a new plan.\nA revenge plan on that detestable girl.\nI’ll soothe Mir with her blood.\nThe girl smiled brightly.",

      "content": "I looked up at the sky.\nThe numerous lights descending from the sky, enriched by the high concentration of mana, looked so beautiful that it felt like watching stars embroidered across the night sky.\nIf this were happening during a festival, I would have honestly admired it.\nBut this was a battlefield.\nSuch occurrences were not a good omen.\n“What on earth…”\nRushing to the operational site, ready to be scolded for oversleeping, I was greeted with utter chaos.\nEveryone was frantically preparing something, a stark contrast to the calmness of yesterday.\nThe reason for their frantic actions was obvious even to me, who had just arrived.\n…The swarm of spiders approaching like a tidal wave.\nIt must be because of them.\n“…Author? Did you mess up again?”\nBut I didn’t panic and sighed instead.\nI had experienced these ridiculous situations many times before.\nSuch absurd quantities of beasts…\nIf the frontline had to deal with such a number of beasts daily, this world would have perished long ago.\nThere was only one cause for such improbable events.\n[Oh, what? What is this…?]\n“…?”\nThe author’s voice was thick with confusion.\nCould it be that the author wasn’t behind this?\nA creeping sense of unease began to rise.\nBut only for a moment. The author’s ridiculous explanation made me clutch my head again.\n[No, that’s not it… Why are there so many?]\n“What do you mean…?”\n[I planned to have a surprise attack event… but there are too many!]\nOh, damn it. Not again?\nI was growing weary of the author’s behavior, showing no signs of remorse.\nIt’s been almost a year since we’ve been together, yet nothing has changed.\nIt’s just one disaster after another.\n“I was wondering why things had been quiet lately…”\n[What! Don’t talk like I’m always causing trouble!]\n“…So, you’re not?”\n[…]\nSeeing the author unable to refute my words, it seemed they knew they were at fault.\nCome to think of it, the reason there hadn’t been any trouble lately was simply because they hadn’t done anything.\nThe author’s embarrassed reaction made me sigh in exasperation.\n[But…! I set it up correctly this time!]\n“…What?”\n[The spiders are correct, and the surprise attack is set correctly, but…! There aren’t supposed to be that many! I just set it so the mother spider laid eggs before dying…! But…!]\nThey thought it was manageable.\nSure, if the story was just about spiders hatching from eggs laid before the mother died, there wouldn’t be much issue.\nThe problem was the author never anticipated such a massive number of spiders.\n…Anyway, the author’s insistence on being innocent meant they had set it up correctly.\nSo how?\nWhere did it go wrong?\n[No matter how much I think, there shouldn’t have been a problem…! From where…!]\nThe author started to groan in distress.\n…What’s done is done.\nThey say sighing shortens your life, but that’s definitely a lie.\nHow many times have I sighed because of the author?\nIf that were true, I should have died long ago.\n“…So?”\n[Yes?]\n“How many are there?”\nThe only way to handle this mess was to reduce the number quietly.\nLuckily, with so many, the distance between the front and rear would be considerable.\nEven if I used all my strength, no one would notice.\nAs for the clothes…\n…If I hide well, it should be fine.\nOr I could ask the author for help.\nI glanced around and saw that everyone was still too busy to notice anything else.\nNo one had even realized I had joined late.\nIf I slipped away, no one would notice.\n[Well, I don’t know.]\n“…Sigh.”\n[…]\nThe author couldn’t argue against my exasperated sigh.\nOf course, they couldn’t.\nIt was clearly their fault.\nLooking at those spiders made it obvious.\nThe author had admitted to setting up the spider attack.\n“I guess I have to check them all one by one…”\n[Heh, heh…]\n“Be quiet.”\n[Yes, sir…]\nMoving through the rear unnoticed by such a massive number of beasts was already a daunting task.\n…No, it’s more like my future is bleak.\n“Siwoo seems… to be okay.”\nI saw him rushing to join the main unit.\nThat meant there shouldn’t be any major problems.\nThe heroes here were veterans among veterans.\nThis place was filled with the strongest humans.\nThey had spent years cutting down beasts.\nHandling this many beasts without any damage would be difficult.\nThis was likely their first time facing such a horde.\n…But what if Siwoo was there?\nIn such critical situations, the protagonist and their allies always managed to solve things stylishly.\nIf I could just reduce the number of beasts a bit from behind, it should be fine.\nLuckily, my ability is specialized for mass destruction.\nEspecially against such low-intelligence beasts.\nIt wasn’t an insurmountable task.\n“Author, you really need to reflect on this. You keep causing incidents every day.”\n[Sniff…]\nI quietly left the main unit, making sure no one noticed my absence, and felt a pang of regret for what was to come.\nI’d have to say goodbye to these clothes.\nEven though no one would see me, the thought of running around naked outdoors already felt overwhelming.\nIt would be good if Siwoo didn’t catch me.\nAs I absentmindedly fiddled with my bracelet, a sharp pain suddenly struck, and my vision blurred as if I were watching the scenery from a speeding train.\n…What happened?\nOh, I got kicked in the side.\nThe force of the impact had slammed me into a building.\nThat’s why I hurt so much.\n“Ugh…”\n[Reader?! Are you okay?!]\nThe author’s frantic voice echoed in my ear.\nThis wasn’t the author’s doing.\nIf it were their doing, they wouldn’t be this surprised.\nIt wasn’t a beast either. If it were a beast, it would have torn me apart.\nThey don’t launch ambushes that send you flying into buildings.\nSuppressing the pain coursing through my body, I forced myself to look up and see who had ambushed me.\n“Hello. Do you remember me?”\n[…Oh? You’re alive…?]\n“…!”\nI was shocked.\nStanding there was someone I recognized.\nThat day.\nThe day I realized Siwoo was the only human.\nThe sole survivor of the Übermensch I had let live because I was distracted by Siwoo.\nThe last remaining member of the Twelve Zodiac.\nShe stood before me.\nShe looked horrible, but it wasn’t hard to recognize her.\nI thought she was dead.\n“…How are you…”\n“You remember me?”\n“Answer my question! Why are you here…!”\n“I was surprised too. I never expected to see you here. I was planning to use the spiders to escape, but then I saw you.”\n“…!”\n…So that’s it.\nThe reason there were so many spiders that even the author was baffled.\nIt was her.\nBecause of this girl the author had forgotten, the situation had escalated.\n“…You used to look pretty nice, but you’ve gotten uglier than I expected.”\n“Ugly? No way. I think I look great. I like how I look now. Right, Annie?”\n“Yes, Mir. Everyone thinks so. Our comrades think so too.”\n“See? Even Mir says so.”\n…Who was she talking to?\nHad she lost her mind?\n“You killed Mir.”\n“I don’t know who that is.”\n“Haha, don’t lie. You know.”\n“…”\n“Tell me. Why did you kill Mir?”\nAt some point.\nI had thought that one day I would be asked this question.\nIf I kept killing dolls, wouldn’t someone eventually ask me this?\nI had thought about it.\nWhat would I say in such a moment?\n…Oh, no.\nMy head isn’t working properly because of the pain.\n“…Because it was a doll.”\n“A doll?”\n“It’s all a doll. Everything in this world. Except for Siwoo and me, everything is a doll.”\nYes. Everything is a doll.\nAs long as the author manipulated this world as they pleased, this world was nothing but a grand puppet show.\nIn such a place, what else would you call the moving people but dolls?\nI decided to think that way.\nOtherwise, I felt like I couldn’t bear it.\n“…It’s not just a doll.”\n“No, it is a doll.”\n“…So Mir died because of a liar like you.”\nThe survivor’s cold eyes glared at me with burning hatred.\n…I’ve been caught.\nI’ve been found out.\nYes, I knew the truth.\nIt wasn’t just dolls.\nThey were all humans living and moving in this world.\nI hadn’t killed dolls; I had killed real people.\nBut I had to think of them as dolls to cope.\nThat day.\nThe day everything changed.\nThe corpses split in half before my eyes, the red blood gushing out.\nWhen I trembled in fear at the horrific scene I had caused, the bodies disappeared as if nothing had happened.\nThe vanished corpses seemed to tell me I wasn’t guilty.\nThey seemed to say they weren’t real people.\nSo I ignored my guilt, and so I killed the dolls.\nThe girl shed her rags and stared at me.\nBesides her hideously altered face, her body was twisted in every direction.\nRat, sheep, cow, pig, rabbit, horse, tiger, monkey, rooster… and dragon.\nDistinctive body parts I had seen before.\n“…Hey, do you remember this?”\nI remembered. There was no way I could forget.\nThe bodies of the Übermensch members. Their body parts were grafted onto her.\n“…So, you remember.”\nI realized.\nThis last survivor, with the bodies of those I had killed stitched onto her, had come to judge me.\nShe had come to avenge them.\nFor the crimes I had committed here.\nTo make me pay for my sins.\nMy karma had come to find me.",

      "content": "My karma.\nWhat else should I call it?\nI can’t find any other way to describe the girl in front of me.\nA monster that appeared with the corpses of the numerous people I killed haphazardly pieced together.\nThis is the sin I committed.\nIt was a terrible sight,\nAs if my past actions have come to light.\n“You killed them! You ruined all our plans!”\n“Yes. I killed them. But you guys are the type that are fine even if you die, aren’t you?”\nI retorted to the girl’s hateful words.\nWords that I had recited dozens of times in my mind.\nThe people in this world are all puppets.\nBut even so. Even if they are puppets.\nI didn’t kill just anyone.\nDid I try to kill Ha-Yul before? The Author somehow covered that up.\nI think I gave the reason that I didn’t want to kill him because he seemed interesting.\nAt that time, she thought I was talking nonsense.\nBut thinking about it now, not killing him was the right answer.\nIf I had killed Ha-Yul then, I wouldn’t have been able to rationalize like this.\n“You guys are villains. Criminals who go around killing people.”\nThat’s right.\nThe bad guys who always cause harm to society.\nThat’s why I could kill them even more without hesitation.\nBecause they weren’t good people.\nBecause they were the trash of society that didn’t make me feel any guilt that I forcibly buried.\n“You also killed a lot of people.”\nThe Übermensch is a villain group.\nLies like not causing any harm won’t work.\nBesides, this woman must be the reason Siwoo came here.\nThe culprit who killed several heroes in a surprise attack.\nI didn’t notice when I only heard her voice, but…\nIf it’s now, I can clearly tell.\n“I don’t care about that. I’m here for revenge.”\n“Yes. You’re right. In fact, you didn’t care about that at all.”\nBut the girl didn’t seem to particularly care about her own sins.\nYeah, that’s right.\nThat’s how villains are.\nThat’s their way.\nThe fact that they tormented someone, hurt someone. Killed someone.\nThose things don’t matter at all to them.\nThey only get angry when the same thing happens to them.\nI’m no different.\nEven if I kill villains, they’re ultimately villains. Just puppets playing the role of bad guys.\nI thought it had nothing to do with me.\n“Bring it on.”\nI unleashed threads around me while somehow maintaining my blurry vision.\nThere’s no room for trivial talk about who wronged whom between someone who lost a loved one to another and someone who killed a loved one.\nJust as the fact that I killed doesn’t change even if they were villains.\nEven if the girl’s loved one was a villain.\nEven if no one in the world sympathizes with her death,\nThe girl came for revenge.\nThe world is neither just nor logical.\nThat’s why the girl came for revenge.\nShe came to collect my life as debt.\n“Sorry, but I have no intention of dying obediently.”\nIf Siwoo had died.\nWould I have ended up like that girl too?\nI don’t know.\nBut even if that were the case, I couldn’t die to this.\n“Die. I want to see your blood.”\nThe girl’s arm twisted grotesquely, and soon, the enlarged arm swung at me.\nI forcibly moved my aching body and flew while pulling threads and attaching them to a nearby building.\nThen, the structure behind me collapsed in an instant.\nWas it because of the earlier impact or the strike now?\nOne thing is certain, it looks like it will hurt terribly, even if it just grazes me.\n“You’re like a fly.”\n“I’d prefer if you said spider. Flies can’t use threads, you know?”\n“…”\nI tried to stall for time by opening my mouth, but the girl’s arm rose again as if there was nothing more to say.\nWell, fine.\nI don’t feel like dragging this out either.\nWithout hesitation, I released all the threads from my clothes.\nI had no worries about showing an embarrassing sight.\nThere was no one to see anyway, and I’d rather die of shame than physically.\n[Re-Reader-nim! Are you okay?!]\n“Be quiet. My head is ringing.”\nNo matter how I looked at it, that girl had become far stronger than when we last met.\nI don’t know how she did it, but is it because of those grotesque things stuck all over her?\nTo check the strength, I tried attacking by whipping the threads like a whip.\n“Is this all? You killed Mir with just this level of skill?”\nThen, a mouth that appeared on the girl’s hand breathed fire and burned the threads.\nAh, crazy.\nWhat the hell is that now?\nWasn’t there only one ability per person?\nWhy is she suddenly breathing fire?\n“Did you think I wouldn’t make any preparations even after seeing your battle?!”\nAs the girl shouted in a heated voice and stamped her foot, the ground began to tremble this time.\nI saw a stream of water as I escaped the collapsing building from the vibration and moved to the next building.\nI hurriedly used more threads to leave the spot, seeing buildings sliced easily like tofu wherever the stream of water moved.\n“Sigh.”\n[N-no, it’s not me! I really don’t know about this!]\nI heard the Author muttering again as if startled, but I couldn’t listen to what she was saying.\nProbably because the girl was charging at me with tremendous speed as if inspired by Amelia’s acceleration.\n“Got you.”\n“?!”\nBut it’s not good to run too fast.\nIf you rush in at that speed, you won’t be able to spot the threads.\nThey were hard to be seen with, and I used white threads in broad daylight.\nWhen she got close, it seemed she noticed the threads in front of her eyes, but it was already too late.\nUnable to overcome the acceleration, the girl’s body running into the threads was sliced by the threads.\n“Ugh, my head hurts.”\nIs it over?\nI held my throbbing head with one hand and kept rubbing my body with the other.\nIt’s already past autumn and heading into winter.\nEven though it’s broad daylight, being outside naked in this weather made me feel like I might catch a cold.\nI should ask the Author to get me some clothes.\n“Phew, by the way, what the hell is that?”\nIt wasn’t a normal appearance, no matter how I thought about it.\nA terrible appearance, as if it had just escaped from a lab in a horror game.\nShe wielded various abilities, ignoring the rule of one per person.\nWhat on earth is it?\n[Re-Read- Behind! Behind!]\n“?”\nBehind?\nThere’s no way she could have survived being sliced by my threads.\nIt’s a strength that could easily cut rocks even at the beginning of enrollment.\nUnless she went beyond being human…\n“What is that?”\nHer limbs should have been dismembered.\nThe girl, who had scratches but no major wounds, was still looking at me with a venomous gaze.\nI hurriedly attacked, keeping the threads floating in the air as much as possible, but only scratches appeared.\nThe girl’s body didn’t get sliced or anything.\n“Eek!”\nThump, thump.\nEvery time the girl approaches me, the threads slice her.\nIt was useless. Wounds definitely appear one by one, but I couldn’t stop her.\nThe closer the distance between the girl and me.\nThe closer the distance between me and my sins.\nI realized.\nThat there was nothing more I could do.\nI was simply powerless in front of this opponent.\nFinally, when the girl and I faced each other,\nShe gave me a sinister smile.\nAnd pain followed.\n“Cough…!”\n“Ah, sorry. Your left side was all bruised, but I believe in equality, so your right side is the only logical move..”\n“Ugh, ugh…!”\nI can’t breathe well.\nEvery time I gasp, I feel a pain as if my lungs are being torn apart.\nMaybe my ribs are broken.\nI tried to get up, realizing I had collapsed in pain without knowing, but it didn’t work well.\nI could only gasp in the pain I was experiencing for the first time in my life.\n“What the hell? You’re going to slump down like that from just this much?”\nThe girl looked at me in disbelief.\nIs she thinking that I can’t even endure this much pain?\nBut I couldn’t even counterattack the girl who looked at me as if pathetic and could only sit there slumped.\nBecause it was the first time I had been hit like this since coming to this world.\nBecause it was the first time I had felt such intense pain.\nI thought I was pathetic too, but my body wouldn’t move.\nI could only tremble like a leaf.\nMy body couldn’t get up again.\n“This is really ridiculous. To think Mir was killed by someone like this.”\n“Haah, haah…!”\n“Where did the girl who said she wouldn’t die obediently just a moment ago go?”\n“Cough, ugh…”\n“Enough. Die.”\nThe girl’s arm twisted again with a terrible sound.\nInstead of spreading wide to strike a large area, it took a sharp shape to pierce something.\n“Mir, everything is for you.”\nSquelch.\nFresh blood flowed down my cheek.",

      "content": "Feeling the onset of pain, I tightly shut my eyes.\nLike a child bracing for a needle, I prepared myself for the agony that was sure to come.\nYet, the stabbing pain from the weapon I had glimpsed before closing my eyes never arrived.\n\"...?\"\nConfused, I cautiously opened my eyes, blinking in disbelief at the scene before me.\nSiwoo was bleeding, right in front of me.\nHe had shielded me from the attack that I couldn't defend against.\nHe took the blow in my place.\n\"Why... Why... No, how...\"\n\"Sss... Ah, this hurts a bit...\"\nDespite the attack that pierced his shoulder, he smiled at me.\nIt had to hurt.\nIt had to be more excruciating than the bruise on my side.\nBut he didn't seem to care at all; instead, he was worried about me.\n\"I'm glad I made it in time, Arte. I wish I'd gotten here a bit sooner. You look like you're in a lot of pain.\"\n\"How... How did you get here...\"\n\"I told you, Arte. I'll always be by your side.\"\nAs he said that, the bracelet on Siwoo's wrist caught my eye.\n\"You shouldn't go to dangerous places alone. Got it?\"\n\"Who are you? Don't interfere. If you do, I'll...\"\n\"Watch out!\"\nJust as the girl transformed her hand to strike Siwoo again, a swift, sharp sound echoed, and she was sent flying.\n\"Hey! You can't just leave without saying where you're going!\"\nWhen did she get here?\nAmelia, who hadn't been visible until moments ago, had suddenly appeared and struck the girl with her spear.\nThen she turned on Siwoo, yelling.\n\"Where do you think you're going without a word?!\"\n\"Sorry. I felt I had to be here.\"\n\"Had to be here? What do you...\"\nAmelia's voice trailed off as she looked at me.\n\"Oh, having a good time, are you? You have quite the taste.\"\n\"It's not like that, Amelia. You know that.\"\n\"Fine, fine. Why are you so serious over a joke?\"\n\"Because this isn't the time for jokes.\"\nAh.\n...Come to think of it, I'm naked.\nThe pain had overshadowed my embarrassment, making me forget.\n\"Here, Arte. Wear this for now. Sorry, it's a bit dirty with blood.\"\n\"...Thank you.\"\nSomething was strange.\nMy heart wouldn't stop racing.\nWas it the excitement from the battle?\nOr was my body releasing chemicals to suppress the pain?\nAs Siwoo covered me with his own clothes, my heartbeat grew louder.\nThump, thump.\nI could hear the author's voice faintly, but my heart wouldn't stop pounding.\nThump, thump.\n\"...Hey, Yoo Siwoo. Is that the target? The one we're supposed to kill?\"\n\"Yeah. Probably.\"\n\"Wow, disgusting. Is it even human? I hit it with the intent to kill...\"\nThe girl who had been sent flying started to approach us again.\nNot only her arm, but her entire body seemed to expand and contract irregularly.\nShe was becoming something that could hardly be called human anymore.\n\"...So? Do you have a plan to win?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"What?! Then what do we do?!\"\n\"What else?\"\nThe girl crouched down like a sprinter ready to take off.\nA crouching start.\nAs soon as she moved, Siwoo grabbed me and turned.\n\"We run.\"\n-BOOM!\nUnable to control her speed, the girl crashed through the wall, leaving only a cloud of dust behind.\n\"Running is fine! I'm good at that! ...But what do we do if we keep running?! Everyone's busy fighting off those spiders! Dorothy is busy helping people! There's no one to help us right now!\"\n\"Who said that?\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"That there's no one to help. That's not true.\"\n-BOOM, BOOM!\nAs Siwoo and Amelia talked, the girl charged at us again, but failed each time, ending up crashing into the walls.\n...Someone to help?\nWho could he be talking about?\n\"They should be here any minute now...\"\n\"AWOOOOOOOOOO!\"\n\"?!\"\n\"Oh, they're here.\"\nFrustrated by her repeated failures, or perhaps realizing that this wouldn't work, the girl transformed her body again to strike us, but a large wolf suddenly appeared and bit her neck.\nIt seemed to have no effect, as the girl casually swung her fist, forcing the wolf to retreat to our side and transform into a human.\n\"...Why is she so tough? My teeth hurt.\"\n\"What... What are you? I thought you were dead... And what's with that form?\"\n\"That's how it is, rich girl. This form... Let's just say it's an ability.\"\n\"...Oh, whatever! You better explain everything from start to finish later! My head's hurting right now!\"\n\"Sure, sure. I'll tell you everything later.\"\n...Why is Lyra here?\nDid she notice I was staring blankly?\nShe looked at me and smirked.\nBut I knew it wasn't a mocking smile, thanks to the time we spent living together.\nLyra just wasn't good at smiling.\n\"You look like a mess.\"\n\"...Why are you here?\"\n\"I'm here to save you.\"\n\"Why would you...\"\n\"Why?\"\nI couldn't understand.\nLyra had no reason to help me.\nEven though I forced her to be my subordinate, I had tried to kill her.\nEven disregarding that, I had ruined her life.\nShe had been living a normal life until I drove her to a villain's organization out of my own inferiority complex.\nSo why would she come to save me?\nMaybe because of the ever-changing situation, I couldn't notice how incomprehensible my words would sound to her.\n\"If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have joined a villain organization out of inferiority.\"\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"If it weren't for me. If it weren't for the author, you could have lived a normal life as a hero.\"\nYes.\nIf it weren't for me.\nIf it weren't for the author.\nGiven she was considered a potential heroine, she must have had some potential.\nShe could have become a hero, living happily and interacting with people.\nBut I twisted all of that.\nI had suggested to the author to use her differently.\nTo turn her into a villain.\n\"You have no idea what you're talking about.\"\n\"What do you mean... Your life was changed! You could have lived a normal life, but now...\"\n\"So what if it did?\"\nI was at a loss for words.\nShe completely denied my premise.\n\"So what if it did? I know my life is a mess.\"\n\"But, but... You could have lived normally...\"\n\"That's not me.\"\nShe declared firmly.\nAs if she couldn't understand what I was talking about.\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm the one who reached out to the villains out of jealousy.\"\n\"But that was because of the author's changes... If the author hadn't interfered, you could have lived normally...\"\n\"I never wanted a normal life.\"\nWhich is why I turned out this way.\nShe said, stroking the wolf ears on her head with a bitter smile.\n\"Have you ever seen me before I entered the academy? Why do you think I would have lived normally?\"\n\"Because...\"\n\"Do you have some prophecy or something?\"\nI couldn't say anything.\nBecause it was true in a way.\nShe was destined to be a heroine.\n\"...Is this for real?\"\n\"It's similar.\"\n\"Huh. So, I could have not become a villain?\"\nA sharp voice pierced the air from behind Lyra.\nIt was Amelia.\n\"Hey, how long are you going to talk?! Didn't you come to help?!\"\n\"There's a snake girl over there! Just wait a bit!\"\n\"This woman is useless! You're much better!\"\n\"That's harsh?!\"\n\"Kill her first! Kill her! Aaaah!\"\n\"Eek! I almost died! What are you doing!\"\n\"As long as you survived!\"\n\"You trash! Do you even call yourself a hero?!\"\nLyra scratched her head, thinking for a moment before speaking to me.\n\"So, originally, I was destined to be a hero?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"And you twisted it to make me a villain? That's basically it?\"\n\"...Yes.\"\n\"So what's the problem?\"\n\"But...\"\n\"I never deeply wished to be a hero.\"\nDespite saying that, she seemed unsettled and started asking me more questions.\n\"One thing. Just one more question. When did you twist that prophecy or whatever? Elementary school? Middle school?\"\n\"Around two weeks after entering the academy. I don't know exactly...\"\n\"Did you know me before I entered the academy?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"The first time we met was at the place where you were learning swordsmanship after joining the academy?\"\n\"...Yes.\"\n\"And you already knew about that prophecy when we first met?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"This girl really had unnecessary thoughts...\"\n\"?!\"\nI was so taken aback by her reaction that I could only be swayed by her.\n...I thought she would throw me to that monster, demanding her life back.\n\"The first person I met predicted my past and future. This is... Our leader is dumber than I thought.\"\nLyra tapped my head with her finger.\n\"Don't judge people solely on first impressions. Got it?\"\n\"How does that have anything to do with this...\"\n\"It does. You thought I'd be a hero the moment you saw me. I've been jealous since I was young.\"\n\"But that's because of the author's settings...\"\n\"Look at this?\"\nLyra poked my side, seemingly annoyed.\n\"Agh...\"\n\"How can you confirm that's true?\"\n\"...There's no way to confirm.\"\n\"Listen carefully, dumb leader. I've lived this way my whole life, and this is my life. I'll say it one last time.\"\nMaybe she thought I was really struggling.\nLyra, who kept looking back, finally spoke to me.\n\"I am like this because of my choices. Not because of your silly prophecy. If you want to understand a person properly, you need to watch them for a long time, not just once.\"",

It can lead to such hardships.\nThe old me, who was jealous of those more talented, seemed foolish now.\nIf talent leads to a place where death is a constant threat, maybe it's better not to have it at all.\nThough, for some reason, I was here too.\n\"Are you alright?\"\n\"No...!

You're having a long conversation in this situation.\"\nIt really was nothing.\nI just snapped our leader out of her guilt-ridden stupor.\nShe was feeling guilty, thinking she had ruined my life.\nIt was funny.\nBut explaining it all wouldn't make her believe it, so I just waved off further questions.\nLuckily, she didn't press any further.\n\"...So? Thanks for coming, but do you have any ideas on how to take down that monster?\"\n\"Not really. I don't know.\"\n\"What?!\"\n\"We were called here by the investigator. We were secretly brought in and suddenly told to come here, which was quite shocking.\"\nThe reason was also laughable.\nIt was something like, \"It looks like something dangerous might happen, so come quickly.\"\nThere was someone willing to use a criminal's help even before anything had happened.\n...Not that I could talk, being here myself.\n\"The investigator? Oh. Teacher. Where is he now?\"\n\"Here.\"\n\"Oh, hi.\"\n\"Long time no see.\"\nWhen did she get here?\nI thought the surroundings were a bit blurry because of the dust.\nWas it because of her ability?\n\"We can't defeat that thing. We're just holding it off.\"\n\"What?!\"\n\"When Siwoo said a few days ago that we needed to bring in a free superhuman, I wondered what was going on...\"\nShe seemed so calm despite saying there was no way to resolve this situation.\nAmelia was understandably flustered.\n\"We can't beat it? Even with so many people?\"\n\"Of course. Our attacks don't work. What else can we do?\"\nHyul pointed to where Spira was fighting.\nShe was screaming and running, but despite the gaps she managed to find, the monster kept moving without a scratch, like a tank against infantry.\n\"I tried putting some water in its lungs... But it seems to breathe fine. It must have gills.\"\n\"Gills? Then it's not even human anymore, is it?\"\n\"Yes, it seems so. That's why it can run around like that.\"\nThe monster, which had been charging at Spira in a straight line, failed to hit her again and crashed into the wall.\n\"For some reason, it seems to have a lot of abilities. It's causing a processing overload. It's just a high-spec empty can.\"\n\"Indeed. Its movements have been too simple.\"\n\"If it has too many abilities, it's worse than having none. Its skill proficiency seems low, so we can still manage.\"\nSure enough.\nIf it were human, it would try different methods when the same one fails multiple times.\nBut this monster just keeps using the same method endlessly.\nAs if its intelligence had regressed.\n\"It's like a beast.\"\n\"We should call it a beast. It's hard to call it human anymore...\"\n\"What could have caused it to end up like that?\"\n\"...Ah.\"\nAt Hyul's musing, Amelia seemed to remember something and jumped up.\n\"The Crucible!\"\n\"...The Crucible?\"\n\"The thing the Übermensch aimed for when they attacked the academy! I heard it was lost, but maybe...!\"\n\"Now that you mention it, two of the Übermensch leaders are unaccounted for.\"\n\"One is here. So that means...\"\nIs that thing a mix of human and monster one of the missing leaders?\nCan't the snake woman even recognize her old comrade?\n...No, she couldn't.\nImagining that thing as her old comrade would be hard.\n\"It looks like it's melted down and fused various creatures together.\"\n\"Right?!\"\nThe Crucible, the Crucible...\nIf I think of it that way, the multitude of abilities makes sense.\nIf it fused many lives together.\nThen its appearance makes sense too.\n\"...Then we need to destroy the Crucible to solve this.\"\n\"But how do we find it? There's nothing that looks like it.\"\n\"It's the heart.\"\nA low voice resonated.\nAs we turned towards the voice, Siwoo had somehow joined us.\n\"...The heart?\"\n\"Yes. The Crucible is inside its body, where the heart is.\"\n\"How do you know...\"\nI stopped myself from asking.\nThis guy had some kind of intuition ability, right?\nHe knew even that?\nIsn't intuition supposed to be a sixth sense? This doesn't seem like a sense at all.\n\"But we still need to retreat first.\"\n\"What? Why?! If we defeat it now...\"\n\"Did you forget? The main force is in danger too.\"\n\"...Ah.\"\nHe was talking about the swarm of spiders.\nThey seemed to be barely holding them off, but there were a lot of injured.\n\"To defeat it, we need a big hit. Not small attacks.\"\n\"But what if there's no one in the main force who can do that...\"\n\"It doesn't matter. There may not be someone who can deliver the big hit, but there's someone who can help make it happen.\"\n\"...Dorothy.\"\nSeeing the three of them nod in agreement made me feel left out.\nShe must be one of our companions.\nIs she important?\nI decided to assume so.\n\"...By the way, where's Arte?\"\n\"I sent her ahead. She needed healing and wasn't much help here.\"\n\"Isn't that dangerous?\"\n\"She'll be fine.\"\nSeeing the certainty in his eyes, we didn't ask further.\nWe figured it was because of that intuition ability or whatever.\nThere was no other reason for him to be so sure.\n\"...Alright. Helping the main force is fine, but we can't all go.\"\nAmelia glanced at Spira, whose screams were getting weaker, and spoke.\n\"That thing seems to target whatever it sees, but...\"\n\"Which means it will relentlessly chase us.\"\n\"Exactly.\"\n...Someone had to stay behind.\nWe had to leave someone behind to help the others.\n\"It doesn't seem to tire, so helping the main force won't be quick. There's some distance too.\"\n\"I'll stay. I have ways to survive attacks...\"\n\"It used fire earlier. The mist will evaporate quickly.\"\n\"...\"\n\"I'll stay. I'm really fast, so it won't catch me easily.\"\n\"No.\"\nIn the midst of everyone volunteering, the boy quietly declared.\n\"I'll stay. You go ahead.\"\n\"Hey! I said I'll...\"\n\"You're fast, but you need to move a lot to dodge each time. You'll tire quickly.\"\n\"...Ugh.\"\n\"Compared to that, I don't need to move as much, so I'll be fine.\"\n\"But...\"\nAmelia couldn't continue.\nShe realized he wouldn't be swayed.\n\"You once told me. How can someone who abandons their friends aim to be a hero?\"\n\"Yeah! So I should...\"\n\"That's why I'll stay.\"\nThe boy who once dreamed of being a hero stepped forward.\n\"If anyone else stays, they'll die. I know it.\"\nSiwoo knew.\nThanks to an ability that was no longer just intuition. Even if he couldn't fully understand it himself, he knew.\nHe was the only one who could stay and survive.\n\"So I'll stay.\"\nIt would be tough.\nHe might die if things went wrong.\nIt wasn't just about holding out for an hour or two.\nHe might have to spend the whole day with that monster.\nA moment of distraction could cost his life.\nBut the boy decided to stay.\n\"Hurry up and go.\"\nBecause he knew that if anyone died because of that monster, the girl he loved would be heartbroken.\nThe girl who had finally found a chance to see the world might shut herself off again.\nSo Siwoo decided to stay.\n\"Come back quickly. I don't want to deal with muscle pain for too long.\"\n\"...Alright. Stay alive.\"\n\"Don't worry.\"\nAs Amelia quickly gathered the injured woman and fled, the monster's gaze naturally turned to Siwoo.\nThe human form it had shown earlier was almost gone.\nIf left alone, it would eventually become a horrifying beast.\nSiwoo's face twisted with pity.\nThe only way to save this person, who was losing their sense of self, was to put them out of their misery.\n\"...Alright, let's do this.\"\nThe boy who once dreamed of being a hero, no.\nThe young man who had become a hero, stepped forward.\nTowards a happy ending for everyone.",

      "content": "\"Pant, pant...\"\n\"Are you alright?! My goodness, you're covered in sweat. Here, here, we have an injured person! Healer!\"\nI pushed through the mental and physical agony to return to the battlefield.\nFortunately, despite the chaos, an anonymous superhuman quickly noticed my poor condition and I was swiftly treated.\nThey must be busy fending off that swarm of spiders.\nA mix of gratitude and guilt stirred within me, creating an indescribable feeling.\n\"Is this the girl?\"\n\"Yes. She seems to be in critical condition. Sorry to trouble you, but please take care of her.\"\n\"Go ahead. Be careful.\"\n\"I can't promise that. The situation is worse than expected.\"\nEvery breath and every movement sent waves of pain through my side.\nTrying to steady my breathing and manage the pain, the woman who had pulled back the clothes Siwoo had covered me with gasped in shock.\n\"...Bruises? Are you a traitor? Did those criminals...\"\n...A traitor? A criminal?\nTrying to process her words through the haze of pain, I realized what she was implying.\nOh, I see.\nBruises wouldn't form from the spider attacks.\nIf it were cuts or punctures, it would be different, but bruises?\nIt made sense to think I had been hit by someone nearby.\n\"...It's not like that.\"\n\"Be honest! What did those bastards do to you...\"\n\"I said it's not like that... I found the target. The villain hiding here. I was attacked by him.\"\n\"...!\"\nI hurriedly explained to stop the woman, who looked ready to charge off and tear someone's hair out if she found out who had hurt me.\n\"Right now, Siwoo is holding that person... no, that monster off by himself. We need to clear this area and call for reinforcements...\"\nSiwoo is holding off that creature alone.\nThe mere thought pained me, and I bit my lip hard.\nLooking down at my body, I saw that my bruised side, which had been turning blue, was slowly returning to its original color.\nThe pain was gradually subsiding.\nYet, even as the physical pain eased, my chest still ached with a dull, persistent pain.\n\"...Will he be okay?\"\n\"I don't know. He said he'd be fine, but...\"\n...Pathetic.\nI felt pathetic for needing Siwoo's help with such pain.\nSiwoo would have brushed off this level of pain like it was nothing.\nDespite having fought many times before, here I was, receiving care after just one attack.\nWasn't there a time when I insisted on making Siwoo a hero?\nHow arrogant.\n\"Don't be too hard on yourself.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Your face is filled with worry. Usually, kids like you make bad choices in that state. Are you feeling guilty for leaving him behind?\"\n\"...Isn't that the case?\"\n\"Maybe. If that's what you think.\"\n...That’s enough.\nShe nodded in satisfaction and began patting my side gently.\nI flinched, expecting pain and reaching to stop her, but there was none.\n\"Sometimes, it's okay to do what you want.\"\n\"But...\"\n\"Hmm, this might sound a bit odd, but... isn't he someone precious to you?\"\nPrecious, she said.\nI was about to nod reflexively, but paused, sensing a deeper meaning in her words.\nWas she talking about love?\n\"...I'm not sure.\"\n\"Really? But what about the other side?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"He stayed behind in that dangerous place to help you, right?\"\nOh.\nI realized what the woman was implying.\nI had understood.\n\"So, even if you don't think that way, he might.\"\nThinking back, it was always like that.\nSiwoo was always kind and gentle with me.\nEven when I had a panic attack at home, he protected me.\nHe must have been uncomfortable with someone invading his personal space.\nYet, he still cared for me.\nThinking about it, Siwoo had been looking at me more often.\nI thought it was out of concern that I might succumb to my anxiety.\nThat might be part of it, but...\nCould he love me?\n\"If that's the case, shouldn't you at least respond to those feelings?\"\n\"...Yes.\"\n\"Then hurry. We need to kill those horrible things to help him, right?\"\nShe gave me a smile and ran off to help other injured people.\nLove.\nSomething I hadn't considered. Or maybe I had ignored it.\nAs soon as I realized it, memories of countless events flooded back.\nSiwoo spent most of his time with me.\nI thought it was because I was watching over him, but maybe he chose to be with me.\nThinking back, Siwoo spent more time with me than with Amelia or Dorothy.\nI thought the heroine race hadn't started yet.\nBut maybe it had ended long ago.\n\"...\"\nI felt my face heat up.\nHow did my actions seem to Siwoo?\nI had trusted Siwoo, believing I wasn't the heroine.\nMaybe it was because, in this world, I had no one else to rely on but Siwoo.\nThinking back on all the things I did, I realized how they might have seemed to Siwoo.\nWhat did Siwoo think about all this?\nI couldn't fathom his thoughts.\n\"...Ugh!\"\nBut there was no time for embarrassment.\nEven though my face was burning, I needed to move right now.\nI had to deal with those creatures as quickly as possible to help Siwoo.\nI untied the clothes Siwoo had given me and, just like in the hero movies I had seen, I shot a web towards the building and let my body swing.\nDespite not being used to this action and almost running out of thread, I finally reached my destination.\nWithout caring about walking through the dorm naked, I ran to my room to change as quickly as possible.\nAnd as I hastily changed my clothes, I noticed something about the room.\n\"...Ah, that.\"\nLooking around the room, I realized there were no unfamiliar items.\nThat was Siwoo's cherished item.\nThat was something we bought together that turned out to be a bit of a white elephant.\nAs I looked around the room Siwoo and I shared, I realized.\nI had spent most of my time in this world with Siwoo.\n\"...\"\nWatching over Siwoo, being with him, living with him.\nIf I thought of my arrival here as a rebirth, then I had spent more than half my life with Siwoo.\nThat thought crossed my mind.\nAfter changing clothes and layering on another for the journey, I felt a shiver.\nMy body was trembling, probably due to heading back into battle so soon after healing.\nBut instead of succumbing to that tremble, I caressed the bracelet Siwoo had given me.\nThe precious gift from Siwoo.\n\"...This will be alright.\"\nIf it gets dangerous, Siwoo will come to help me.\nSiwoo will always be by my side.\nFeeling the trembling subside, I threw myself back into the battlefield.\nThe cold wind cooled my heated body, but my heart still burned hot.\nI acknowledged it.\nThere was no retreat now.\nI accepted that the bracelet Siwoo gave me provided more comfort than any transcendent presence like the author.\n...That I had fallen for Siwoo.\nI acknowledged that the feelings Siwoo had for me were the same as mine for him.\nI couldn't deny it.\nI might have fallen for him a long time ago.\n\"Damn it, there's too many!\"\n\"It's endless...\"\n\"Commander! At this rate, the front line will collapse! We're barely holding it together, but we're at our limit!\"\n\"...\"\nI bit my lip anxiously.\nNo matter how unruly, they were still my subordinates.\nI had managed to keep them alive, but it was reaching the limit.\nIt seemed I had overestimated our ability to handle this endless swarm.\n\"I thought we could hold out for three more hours...\"\n\"Are you crazy?! We've already held out long enough! This is a miracle as it is!\"\nLionel, desperate to protect his daughter, unleashed more lightning than usual.\nThe lightning shattered the beasts in its path, but only for a moment.\nThe gap was quickly filled as if nothing had happened.\n\"...Hmmm.\"\nWe could still fight.\nIt wasn't that we lacked the strength.\nI had estimated three more hours because I believed in their capabilities.\nThe problem was mental endurance.\nNo matter how many we killed, the endless wave kept coming, and doubts began to surface.\nCould we really hold them off?\nCould we survive this?\nThey didn't show it, knowing their mission and being ready to die here.\nBut no matter how much they ignored it, morale was dropping.\nRetreating was the right choice.\nWe would regroup a bit further away and fight again.\nThe numbers had reduced somewhat.\nA few more rounds of regrouping and we could finish this.\n...But I couldn't bring myself to give the order.\nTo retreat, I needed to leave some troops behind to buy time.\nThose who stayed would essentially be given a death sentence.\nBut the commander forced the words out.\nIt was his duty.\nTo sacrifice the few for the many.\n\"We have no choice. Retreat...\"\n-Swish.\nJust as I steeled myself to give the order, countless spiders at the front were suddenly cut down.\n\"W-What...\"\n\"...This is our chance.\"\nA girl descended, relying on a single thread in mid-air.\nWhile everyone else stared in bewilderment, the commander quickly assessed the situation.\nThat was his ability.\nTo deal with the root of this crisis, we needed to quickly secure this area.\nReinforcements were on the way.\nThe commander made a swift decision.\nWe had to end this here.\n\"Reinforcements are coming! A unit specialized in mass destruction! Hold out a little longer!\"\n\"Yeahhhhh!\"\nSeeing the spiders being cut down in droves before their eyes, hope began to rekindle in their hearts.",

      "content": "\"...My goodness.\"\n\"What in the world...\"\nThe superhumans, who were growing weary of the endless swarm of spiders, noticed something unusual.\nA girl had appeared just as they thought they couldn't hold on any longer.\nAround her, the spiders were being shredded at an incredible speed.\nAs they approached her, it looked as if the spiders couldn't get close, their bodies sliced apart like tofu.\n\"...Is it thread? She's laid out thread so that anything approaching gets cut to pieces!\"\n\"Everyone, stay away from the girl! Unless you want to cry over a lost limb!\"\nThe superhumans cheered at the arrival of someone with such an appropriate ability for the current situation.\n\"If we use the area around her as a refuge...! We can quickly get treated if we're injured!\"\n\"It's possible! We can hold them off here!\"\nThe threads extended around the girl, attaching to the rubble of collapsed buildings and creating traps.\nThough the threads began to lose effectiveness as the bodies piled up, more threads spread out from the girl.\nThis seemed to reduce the number of spiders swarming in, giving a glimmer of hope that they might hold out.\nAt that moment, they heard a howl.\n\"AWOOOOOOOO!\"\n\"A wolf? A beast? Damn it, not now...\"\n\"No! It's not a beast! Look over there!\"\nCrunch, crunch.\nEven superhumans couldn't avoid injury if bitten by those spiders.\nA single bite and the momentary pause could lead to a swarm attack.\nThat's why the front line was pushed back, to ensure maximum safety.\nBut that wasn't the case for the figure in front of them.\nA wolf walking on two legs like a human.\nSeveral superhumans gasped in shock.\n\"Wait. I've seen that in a book. Isn't that a werewolf...?\"\n\"...What? A werewolf? Didn't that species go extinct hundreds of years ago?\"\n\"AWOOOOOOOO!\"\nIgnoring the shocked superhumans, the werewolf howled.\nAs if to say that such minor injuries couldn't harm it.\nUnlike the front line, which moved back with the wave's pressure, the werewolf advanced.\nAnd soon, dark fluid began to ooze from within the wave. It was likely killing the beasts inside.\nTo crawl into such a dreadful place.\n\"...It doesn't seem to have any reason. Is it really an ally? Could it just be a coincidental beast?\"\n\"Don't worry. It's an ally. That's a transformation ability of a superhuman.\"\n\"What the...! You scared me...! Where have you been all this time...!\"\n\"I had some things to take care of. But it seems to have brought about something good, hasn't it?\"\n\"...Did you bring those superhumans?\"\nSpecialized in mass slaughter, just as promised.\nThey built walls with their abilities to fend off as many beasts as possible, moving and building walls again when they were broken.\nUnlike those who had gradually grown weary as the front line was pushed back, these superhumans didn't need a front line.\nOne was impervious to attacks, and the other couldn't be approached by the beasts without dying instantly.\n\"Thanks to you, we're saved. Even though there are only two of them...\"\n\"There aren't just two.\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"Over there.\"\nFollowing Hyul's gaze, they saw a woman with a snake's lower half, sobbing and cursing.\n\"Why do I have to be in this state...! Why am I in this state...! I'll curse you, curse you, curse you...!\"\n\"...Is she alright?\"\n\"She tends to exaggerate, so she'll be fine.\"\n\"AAAAAAAHHH! I almost died...!\"\nPerhaps she hadn't noticed the approaching spider.\nHer hair got caught in its mouth, but she managed to escape with only a few strands lost, avoiding serious injury.\n\"Hey, she should be sent to the rear. It's too dangerous here.\"\n\"Don't worry. Though she's not very reliable, exaggerates a lot, doesn't listen, and is always a burden...she's useful.\"\n...Is she really alright?\nDespite Hyul's harsh words, the snake woman blushed, perhaps feeling humiliated by the attack.\n\"She's still useful.\"\n\"How dare you try to kill me...! I'll never forgive you!\"\nHer eyes glowed yellow, her pupils briefly becoming reptilian slits.\nThe spiders in her gaze turned gray, their texture changing as if turned to stone.\n\"...Is that stone?\"\n\"She can create barriers with her attacks. It's a good ability.\"\n\"Yes, she can turn anything she focuses on into stone. However...\"\n\"However?\"\nAs they admired her ability, their curiosity was piqued.\nWas there a drawback?\n\"If she uses it too often, her eyes hurt, so she can't use it frequently... And she has to keep her eyes open to use it continuously...\"\n\"AAAAH! My eyes...! Why won't you disappear?! SAVE ME!\"\nDespite her powerful ability to turn spiders into stone, she was now rubbing her eyes and fleeing with her tail.\n\"That's what happens.\"\n\"...It's impressive, but...\"\n\"Yeah, but...\"\n\"Don't worry too much. She'll survive. She's always managed to.\"\nJust like with Übermensch, Hyul thought but didn't say.\nThere was no need to delve into that.\n\"Still, I didn't expect things to get this much easier with three more joining.\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"...Can I correct one thing? It's not three.\"\n\"Huh? Why?\"\n\"Because there's me. Four of us.\"\n\"What? But you can't...\"\nBefore he could finish, Hyul disappeared into mist.\nHe had previously complained that his ability was only useful for evasion against beasts.\nHe couldn't effectively fill the large beasts' lungs with water.\n...And only then did they realize these were the younglings.\n\"...Do spiders have lungs?\"\n\"I don't know. But they must have some respiratory system. And the younglings are much smaller.\"\nAs if confirming their thoughts, the mist settled in the middle of the wave.\nThe spiders, inhaling the mist and rushing towards the superhumans, foamed at the mouth and collapsed.\n\"Damn, that's terrifying.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nBut even such a fearsome ability was on their side.\nWith four superhumans joining, the burden noticeably lightened.\nIt wasn't just a feeling; the difference was clear.\nThe number of beasts drastically decreased.\n\"Finally, things are getting easier.\"\n\"Yeah, we've been through a lot. Just a bit more...\"\n\"Stop chatting and fight! We have a time limit! Finish this as quickly as possible!\"\n\"...Damn it. A time limit. I thought we'd finally catch a break.\"\nThe superhumans' faces fell at the mention of a time limit.\nWhat new information had the old man received to push them so hard?\n\"...No choice. Let's finish quickly and rest.\"\n\"Yeah...\"\nThey knew the commander had a reason for pushing them.\nThere must be a reason.\nThat old man was the only one who truly cared about them.\n\"Ugh... AAAAAH!\"\n\"...You seem to be in a lot of pain. Are you alright?\"\n\"Dieeee!\"\n\"Sorry, I can't grant that wish. I promised someone special I'd return to them.\"\nFire shot to burn me, arms swung to crush me, and water lashed out to cut me in half.\nBut I evaded with minimal movement. The more I moved, the harder it would be to endure.\nIt was cruel, but Siwoo had no intention of dying for the girl.\nTo keep his promise to the girl he loved.\n\"...Hmmm, how many more hours until the others arrive? Want to bet?\"\n\"Why... Why can't I hit you...!\"\nSiwoo didn't answer her frustrated question.\nIf she paused her attacks, it was good for him.\nBut her frustration didn't last long.\nRealizing I was the cause, she attacked more ferociously.\nShe must have thought I was predicting and dodging her moves.\nShe started attacking wildly.\nWhen I evaded all her attacks, she began to growl.\n\"...What's this now.\"\nWhere had it come from?\nA nameless beast was now beside the girl, glaring at me.\nThe girl, realizing she had an ally, smirked.\n\"...Fine. Let's see how long you last.\"\nSiwoo discarded his calculations of enduring all day.\nTwo of them.\nIt would be harder than he thought.\nBut he didn't give up.\nHe would return to Arte.\nThat was his promise.",

The piles of bodies, resembling mountains, were mixed with tattered clothes and threads, now useless.\n\"Hey, is everyone still alive?!\"\n\"Somehow...\"\n\"Damn it, finding the injured is a task in itself!\"\n\"Help! My leg is stuck! I can't move!\"\n\"Where's the healer?! Hurry, someone's dying here!\"\nWith difficulty, I moved through the spider carcasses.\nThe area was in utter chaos.\nPeople were shouting for help for their dying comrades, others were collapsed in exhaustion.\nHealers were rushing around, trying to aid the injured superhumans.\nWe had survived the horrific wave, but at a great cost.\nThe voices around me didn't celebrate the end; they were engaged in another battle against the aftermath.\n...This way.\nIgnoring the groans around me, I moved towards where my comrades had been.\n\"...Ah, I found them.\"\nIt didn't take long to locate them.\nLyra and Hyul.\nA relatively large clearing had formed around them.\nLyra must have created it.\nLyra didn't look well.\nShe kept retching like a sick patient.\n\"Uwek... Uwek...\"\n\"Are you alright?\"\n\"No, not alright. Bleh.\"\nWas she badly injured?\nI had seen her walk straight into the beast's wave.\nThough I hadn't been attacked, maybe there were poisonous ones?\nThose worries faded as I watched Lyra continuously poke her throat with her hand.\n...What is she doing?\n\"Wek, wek...\"\n\"...Is it that bad?\"\n\"If you're curious, why don't you try some of that puddle over there?\"\n\"I'll pass. I'm not foolish enough to try that after seeing this.\"\n\"Smart choice. It's truly disgusting. Wek...\"\nOh.\nLyra transforms into a werewolf when she uses her power.\nRecently, she had gained the ability to turn into a wolf, but becoming a werewolf made her lose her reason.\nShe must have drunk the beast's fluid while fighting and was now retching because the taste lingered.\n\"Ugh, so annoying. Why do I have to taste this when I don't even remember drinking it? Rotten fish would be better.\"\n\"Would you like some water?\"\n\"No, thanks. There's no water here, and I don't want to drink your body.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But thanks for the offer.\"\nWas she really considering giving her body...?\nDid she realize what she was about to do?\nHyul laughed awkwardly.\n\"By the way, what about that snake girl? Did she die? I mean, it was about time...\"\n\"Who said I died?! I'm not dead yet!\"\n\"Good. I knew you'd come out if I said that.\"\n\"...Oh.\"\n\"You thought you could slip away in the chaos?\"\nWhen had she been nearby?\nAnd how did Lyra know Spira was here?\nShe didn't have tracking or detection abilities like Siwoo.\nHad Spira really tried to escape in the chaos?\nSpira's face hardened, contrasting with Lyra's brightened expression.\n\"Come here before I turn you into snake wine.\"\n\"...Okay.\"\n\"No whining.\"\n\"...Yes.\"\n\"Good.\"\nUsually, it should be Lyra, a member of the canine family, being scolded like that.\nBut there was no time for small talk, so I walked slowly toward them.\n\"Oh, Leader, you're here... Oh, my.\"\n\"My goodness... That's quite bold...\"\n\"...\"\nSpira and Lyra exclaimed in shock.\nIt wasn't surprising.\nAfter fighting for hours, the sun was setting but it was still bright enough.\nWalking around naked would get such reactions.\n\"...Give me.\"\n\"What? Give you what...\"\n\"Your clothes. Give them to me.\"\n\"What?!\"\n\"Okay!\"\n\"Aaah!\"\nI wasn't in the mood to react to such exclamations, nor was I embarrassed to show them my naked body.\nSo I confidently borrowed Spira's clothes, with Lyra's cooperation.\n\"Eek! Give them back! It's cold...\"\n\"How do you put this on?\"\n\"...Haven't you used a bra before?\"\n\"No, I only wore a leotard.\"\nWearing a bra felt like admitting I was a woman, so I never wore one.\nBut now, it didn't matter.\nTo help Siwoo as much as possible, I needed to wear it.\n...The problem was, I didn't know how to wear one.\nI should have tried it before.\nAs I looked at the bra in my hands with a troubled expression, Lyra approached and took it from me.\n\"Raise your arms.\"\n\"Thanks.\"\n\"How is it?\"\n\"...Hmm, it's a bit tight.\"\n\"That's shocking... I have a decent chest too, you know! Going out like this... Ugh!\"\n\"Don't worry. No one will lust after your snake tail.\"\n\"That's too much!\"\nWould this be enough?\nI wore the bra to secure more thread, but I still felt uneasy.\nTo get to Siwoo quickly, I'd need to use threads. But if I used too much, I wouldn't have enough for the fight.\nAs I grew anxious, Hyul, who had been watching, spoke up.\n\"...Are you going alone?\"\n\"Yes. There's no other way.\"\nI knew Amelia was much faster than me.\nIf she carried me, we'd get there quickly.\nThe problem was, I didn't know her location.\nLuckily, I managed to spot their location before the bodies obstructed my view.\nThanks to that, I found clothes and a way to reach Siwoo.\nI felt like a soldier going to war with insufficient bullets, but I had no choice.\nIt shouldn't be too lacking.\n\"...If you head in the three o'clock direction from here, you'll find Amelia. Dorothy is with her.\"\n\"What? How do you know...\"\n\"My ability. I have a wide perception range, so I knew they were nearby.\"\nHyul smiled gently.\n\"You need both of them, don't you? Dorothy to defeat the monster and Amelia to get there quickly.\"\n\"...Thank you.\"\n\"Don't mention it.\"\nBack when I felt annoyance and irritation towards Hyul, had I killed him...\nWould I have been unable to bring Dorothy and Amelia?\nIt was unintended, but...\nI was genuinely glad we accepted Hyul as an ally.\n\"Amelia, Dorothy.\"\n\"Whoa! Where did you come from? And those clothes... Weren't they different earlier...\"\n\"No time for that. We need to go.\"\n\"...You mean Siwoo, right?\"\n\"Yes. Right now.\"\nShould I be thankful?\nThey knew Siwoo's situation, so no further explanation was needed.\n\"What about telling the others?\"\n\"Hyul will handle it. We need to go help now.\"\n\"Got it.\"\nAmelia tried to lift Dorothy and me, one on each arm, but I stopped her and used my power.\nI used part of the clothes to quickly create a thread ball around Amelia's waist.\nBig enough for two people.\n\"This will be faster. Dorothy, inside.\"\n\"...A ball?\"\n\"I made it as sturdy as possible. It might be a bit dizzying, but... Can you manage?\"\nDorothy nodded and climbed inside the ball, using the entrance I left open. I followed her in.\nGripping the handles inside tightly, I sealed the entrance with thread and told Amelia.\n\"Go now! As fast as you can!\"\n\"Leave it to me.\"\nThud, thud.\nAmelia must have been warming up. The ball tied to her waist shook briefly, then air rushed in through the small vent holes at an incredible speed.\n\"Whoa!\"\n\"How is it?! Can you handle it?!\"\n\"Faster! As fast as possible!\"\n\"Alright. Thank you for using the Amelia Express!\"\nAs if that wasn't her top speed, Amelia picked up the pace, and the ball shook so much even a superhuman would feel dizzy.\n\"I'll run at the fastest speed possible!\"\nWait for me, Siwoo.\nI'm coming soon.\n\"Huff, huff... You're persistent...\"\n\"Growl...\"\n\"Damn. If it weren't for you, I could have held out much longer.\"\nI did my best.\nThat thought circled in Siwoo's mind.\nHe had narrowly avoided death many times...\nBut in turn, his stamina was quickly depleting.\nHe wanted to dodge with minimal movement, which was possible when it was just the girl.\nBut the sudden arrival of the beast.\nThat one beast had drained his stamina rapidly.\n\"...Damn. I can't dodge this.\"\nSiwoo analyzed the girl's swing trajectory and the beast's bite position.\nIt was no longer possible.\nHe saw the best direction to dodge but his body couldn't follow through.\nThe girl's arm swung.\nHe dodged it but failed to twist his body in time.\nThe beast bit down hard on Siwoo's body.",

That's a relief...\"\nI managed to dodge.\nI evaded the beast's attack that aimed for my heart, barely avoiding a fatal wound.\nBut I had only avoided instant death.\nIn this state, even moving was difficult.\nSiwoo glanced at his side.\nBecause he had given his shirt to Arte, the wound wasn't covered and was clearly visible.\nBlood poured from the jagged wound caused by sharp teeth.\nSeeing the bright red color, I had a foolish thought about what my insides looked like.\n\"Your new friend must be hungry... You seemed close with that girl...\"\n\"...\"\n\"It doesn't matter if you don't answer! Grrr, I'll kill you... I'll kill you, and that girl will be sad!\"\nHer voice had completely changed since we first met.\nHad even her vocal cords transformed into those of a beast?\nIt seemed she still had some semblance of her mind, but it was only a matter of time before she fully transformed into a beast.\nBy then, she might have been easier to deal with.\nBut that was an irrelevant consideration now.\nI had no more means to hold on.\n\"Die!\"\nI said I'd return to Arte.\nWas it too much to promise?\nSiwoo watched the swinging arm, sighed deeply, and closed his eyes.\nThere was no way to dodge anymore.\n...But then, feeling a sudden sensation, Siwoo rolled sideways in surprise.\nJust in time to avoid the wildly twisting arm.\n\"?!\"\nWith a thud.\nAs if it were child's play, the girl was suddenly pushed away.\nIt probably didn't hurt at all.\nBut the girl, or rather, the monster wearing her guise, was helplessly pushed back.\nMaybe due to the sudden occurrence.\nLeaving the girl who had been pushed far away, Amelia appeared before me with a white sphere attached to her waist.\n\"The Amelia Taxi has arrived!\"\n\"I thought you were a bus?\"\n\"Just understand!\"\nOnly three of them.\nIt was a somewhat anticlimactic entrance, but Siwoo was genuinely glad to see their faces.\n\"You're here.\"\n\"Yeah, you held on... My goodness.\"\n\"Are you okay...?!\"\n\"I'm fine.\"\nI said I was fine to reassure them...\nBut it didn't seem to work.\nWell.\nEven I could see the wound was quite severe.\nMy head felt a bit dizzy, and I thought I might lose consciousness from blood loss.\nReluctantly, Siwoo admitted he was having a hard time.\n\"...Sorry, I said I could hold on, but it's a bit tough.\"\n\"Is this the time to say that?! Oh, what do we do. Emergency treatment... No, but the wound is too big... I'll bring someone who can heal you right away!\"\nAmelia, not knowing what to do, suddenly disappeared from sight, realizing she needed to bring a healer.\nShe had to return quickly.\nAs I sighed in relief, Arte approached with a bright face, which quickly turned pale when she saw my wound.\nHer complexion rapidly worsened upon seeing my injury up close.\n...She might have strange thoughts again.\nWould she think it was her fault again?\nI needed to reassure her that I was okay...\n\"I'm fine, so don't worry...\"\n\"It must hurt a lot, so bear with it. I'm sorry there's no anesthetic.\"\n\"What? Wait, why are you... Nghhh?!\"\nJust as I was wondering what Arte was saying, I realized.\nIf I stayed here, I was going to experience excruciating pain.\nSo it was better to leave.\nBut I couldn't move due to the deep wound, and Arte held me tightly, making it impossible to move. She then threaded a strand through my wound.\n\"Nghhh...\"\n\"...I'm sorry. But if we leave it like this, you might die before getting treated. Please forgive me.\"\n\"Nghhh...\"\nTo prevent me from biting my tongue from the pain?\nA cloth to bite would be good, but the clothes were needed for the fight.\nArte, looking genuinely sorry, brought her arm to my mouth.\nBut I pushed her arm away and bit a piece of my pants instead.\nNo matter how painful, I couldn't hurt Arte.\nAs the thread passed through the freshly wounded flesh, I felt like I would lose my mind.\nThen, I felt the warmth of the girl holding me.\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\"...Yes, thank you. But how did you do this?\"\n\"Oh, don't touch it. It's dangerous.\"\nAfter the pain subsided, Siwoo looked at his side and was greatly impressed.\nA thin white thread was neatly in place, as if it had always been there.\n\"Threads are used in medical procedures too. It's similar. It's like first aid.\"\n\"...Really? Amazing. It's perfect.\"\n\"I stopped the bleeding and ensured you wouldn't bleed out, but... There's a risk of infection, so it's not good to keep it for long.\"\nArte said with concern, urging me to get treated quickly.\nThough it was better than dying from excessive blood loss, the risk of infection made it less than ideal.\nSiwoo nodded at Arte's words and looked ahead.\nThe beast had returned, glaring at Arte.\n\"Grr, you...\"\n\"So, you're the one who hurt Siwoo.\"\nBut Arte's gaze was just as cold.\nI had never seen Arte so angry before.\nEven knowing her anger wasn't directed at me, it was intimidating.\nSeeing her like that made me think I should treat her well if we ended up dating to avoid her wrath.\n\"Dorothy, do it.\"\n\"Oh, yes, yes...!\"\nDorothy, startled by the sudden call, mumbled something and then nodded.\n\"It's done!\"\nArte didn't respond.\nI didn't know where she got them, but Arte was wearing unfamiliar, modest clothes and used her threads to quickly approach the beast.\n\"Don't you know that your attacks won't work on me...?\"\n\"Not now.\"\nThinking the beast was confident nothing could hurt it, Arte swiftly cut off its head.\n\"I'd love to take my time tormenting you, but we don't have...\"\n\"Arte, look out!\"\n\"?!\"\n\"Kyaa!\"\nI shouted to draw Arte's attention.\nLuckily, she reacted well to the unexpected situation.\nHearing my voice, she spread her threads around her like a protective wall, shredding the arm swinging at her.\n\"...You're alive? How?\"\nArte was shocked.\nShe had cut off the head without any hesitation.\nShe had made sure to decapitate it cleanly.\nBut such tactics didn't work on this beast.\nIt roared with a monstrous face, showing that losing its head wouldn't stop it.\n\"The heart, aim for the heart!\"\n\"Graaa!\"\nI informed everyone of the monster's weakness.\nI had no proof, but I knew.\n\"If we remove the crucible from its heart, it'll die! I'm sure!\"\nEven decapitation didn't stop it.\nThe only way to stop it was to remove its heart.\nBut realizing we were aiming for its heart, the beast started using all its abilities wildly while retreating.\n\"...Damn it, we can't get close!\"\nArte tried to slice through its heart with threads multiple times, but it was blocked.\nShe could only shred its quickly regenerating limbs or be thwarted by other abilities.\nIf this continued, we might lose it.\n\"We need to catch it now! We don't know what other abilities it might gain!\"\nAll those abilities were due to the crucible.\nIf we let it go, who knows what other powers it might gain.\nWhile it was still unfamiliar with using its abilities.\nThis was our best chance to defeat it.\nAs Siwoo pondered how to catch the beast, an idea struck him.\n\"...Dorothy. Use your ability on me.\"\n\"What? What are you planning to do?!\"\n\"I'm going to walk in.\"\n\"Into there?!\"\nDorothy looked at me like I was crazy.\nShe couldn't believe what she was hearing.\nI nodded.\nThere was no other way. My intuition screamed this was the way to end it all.\nThis was the path to a happy ending.\n...This was the way to remove the biggest threat.\nMy intuition whispered.\n\"...This is the perfect way to solve everything. Trust me.\"\n\"Ngh, ngh...\"\nI knew it looked like a suicide mission.\nI waited for Dorothy to consider it...\nIt didn't take long to get her confirmation.",

      "content": "\"You know, Arte. This might sound strange, but...\"\nI have to go in there.\nI told Arte this, but I wondered if she would even allow it.\nIt was a ridiculous thing to say, even coming from me.\nI glanced at my side.\nThe emergency treatment Arte had performed stopped the bleeding, but the white thread was now dyed red, indicating the severity of the injury.\nEven I knew it sounded absurd.\nBut there was no other way, and I desperately needed Arte's help to increase the chances of success.\nHer presence would help fend off the beast's wild attacks.\nBut how could I persuade her...?\n\"Okay. What do I need to do?\"\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"Do I need to cut off a limb? Or build a wall for you?\"\nArte looked at me with a bright smile, as if saying just tell her what to do.\nI was speechless.\nI had thought it would be hard to persuade her.\nI spent a long time wondering what to say to get Arte to help me.\nBut she smiled at me as if to say those worries were pointless.\n\"...You'll let me?\"\n\"Let you? I never planned on refusing.\"\n\"...Why?\"\nSiwoo was puzzled.\nArte had always relied on me, to the point of experiencing severe anxiety without me.\nYet, when I declared I would go to a dangerous place, she had no intention of refusing.\nSeeing a completely different side of Arte, I felt confused.\nArte chuckled and spoke to me.\n\"Because I trust you.\"\n\"...Trust?\"\n\"Yes, I trust you.\"\nTrust.\nThat was why she didn't stop me from walking into danger.\nArte said so.\n\"It'll be dangerous, of course. Walking through that chaos is crazy.\"\nArte watched as the beast, with a newly grown head, flailed wildly in confusion.\n\"You might get slashed just by approaching, let alone getting close.\"\nDespite saying such grim things, Arte didn't lose her smile as she looked at me.\nBut I wasn't worried.\nHer expression.\nHer smile directed at me was so beautiful.\nI couldn't help but be captivated.\n\"No matter what happens, you'll end up with me, right?\"\nShe raised the bracelet hanging from her hand and smiled.\nA soft, reassuring smile.\nHer trust in me.\nSeeing Arte like this, I nodded, almost entranced.\n\"Okay. What do I need to do?\"\n\"When I charge in, I need you to cover me.\"\n\"A simple yet difficult request.\"\n\"...Haha, sorry.\"\n\"No need to apologize. I have a score to settle with that creature.\"\nSiwoo felt that Arte had changed a lot.\n...It felt like a barrier had been crossed.\nLike she had moved past something.\nDorothy, too, looked at Arte with bewildered eyes.\n\"...Now that I think about it, isn't this the first time you've worked together with Siwoo?\"\n\"Oh? ...Is it?\"\n\"As far as I remember, yes.\"\nReflecting on her words, I realized it was true.\nDespite the many incidents and accidents, Arte and I had never fought on the same side.\nShe always went off to do something else.\nIn battles with event-like tendencies, we were always on opposite sides.\n...I see. This is the first time we're fighting together.\n\"Saying this might sound a bit odd, but... I feel happy.\"\nSeeing Arte's slightly blushing face as she spoke to me made me blush too, and I turned my head.\nSeeing this, Dorothy raised her hand apologetically and interrupted us.\n\"...I'm sorry to interrupt your cozy moment, but it's escaping.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nRight. We were discussing how to deal with it.\nI had wasted time without realizing it, and now the girl had grown so large that her human form was no longer recognizable, far away.\n\"Alright, Dorothy. Do your thing.\"\n\"Okay. Please come back alive and keep showing me those scenes right in front of me.\"\n\"Right in front of you... That's a bit...\"\nAs if it were a casual matter.\nLike taking care of a minor task, I finished my chat and approached the girl.\nTo bring an end to her story.\nSoon, I stepped into the area where the abilities wielded wildly by the girl were swirling.\nIt felt like stepping into an artificially created natural disaster.\nAs I took a step forward, Dorothy's enhancement kicked in, and I felt a terrible headache start.\nBut I didn't stop.\nStopping here would mean a gruesome death.\nFor Arte's sake, I couldn't die here.\nWith each step, blind flames, wildly swung arms, and sharp ice came at me.\nBut I didn't dodge. I moved forward, knowing they'd disappear before reaching me.\nI moved one step to the left to avoid the flying ice shards.\nThey landed where I had stood just moments before.\nArte used her threads to protect me, but the trajectory had twisted unexpectedly.\nArte's face hardened and then sighed as if she hadn't expected this.\nNo, I didn't see her.\nI knew it.\nWith a throbbing headache, I moved forward.\nMany attacks came my way, but none could harm me.\nWith Dorothy's enhancement, even a god descending couldn't harm me.\nAs the monster noticed I was approaching, it roared and tried to attack me, but all efforts were futile.\nIt didn't matter if it closed its eyes and attacked wildly, realizing I could read all its movements.\nI knew everything.\nHow the monster would move.\nWhere and how it would attack.\nEven if it didn't realize, I knew.\nThat was my ability.\nThis was the pinnacle of my ability.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nTo the monster, no, to the girl who lost her sanity and went mad, I apologized.\nIf I hadn't protected Arte, I might have ended up like this girl.\nFeeling a pang of sorrow, I still had to stop her.\nBefore receiving Dorothy's enhancement, I didn't fully understand why.\nNow, I understood clearly.\nI knew.\nTo permanently remove the writer from this world.\nI had to defeat this girl.\n\"Grk...?!\"\nSensing danger, the girl made an extreme choice.\nThe beast that had injured me.\nThe beast that had always been by her side met its end at her hands.\nYes, you'd do that and then absorb it.\nTrying to stop me with even greater power.\nBut that was meaningless.\nYou can't stop or ambush me.\nA sudden transformation turned the arm into a large mouth that tried to bite me, but I dodged effortlessly, already knowing.\nAnd then Dorothy would mutter.\n\"It seems like the attacks are avoiding Siwoo...\"\nLeft, up, down, a tail emerges. Up, down, right, right, left, right, up.\nI knew even the fleeting attacks in that moment.\nDespite the throbbing headache and the throbbing wound in my side, I dodged all the girl's attacks.\nAnd now.\nThe girl would stop her attack and jump back to create distance.\nI matched her timing and jumped into her arms.\nSlowly enough not to be noticed.\nBut fast enough to catch her.\nRealizing I didn't dodge and jumped with her, it was too late for her to respond.\nMy sword carved into the girl's chest.\n\"Grk...?!\"\n\"...\"\nA monster that wouldn't die even if beheaded.\nThe monster's death felt absurdly simple.\nAs I tore the heart, no, the crucible, from her chest with my sword, she collapsed like a doll with its battery removed.\n...Perhaps because the writer didn't anticipate this formidable enemy, there was no grand death scene.\nBut that wasn't the point.\nKilling this girl didn't end it.\nThe reason this world had changed.\nThe reason Arte had come to this world.\nThe person who wanted to plunge the world into chaos was still here.\nRight now.\nWhen he was most off guard.\nThis was the chance to sever him from this world.\n\"Amazing...! Are you hurt anywhere...?!\"\n\"Arte, I'm sorry.\"\nThat's why I didn't lower my blood-dripping sword and pointed it at the one I loved.\n\"Uh?! ...Wait! Was there something wrong...?! Like mind control?!\"\n\"...No. Stay still, Dorothy.\"\n\"What?! But...!\"\nDorothy, unable to grasp my intentions, looked at me with a bewildered expression.\nShe was surely thinking I had been compromised.\nBut Arte looked at me and smiled.\nThe most beautiful smile I had ever seen from her.\n\"Do what you need to do.\"\n\"...Are you sure?\"\n\"I told you before, didn't I?

I'll explain everything later.\"\nI wanted to explain to Dorothy, who didn't understand what was happening, but there was no time.\nI had to finish this quickly before the writer realized and took action.\n\"...Alright, but you have to explain everything to me later!\"\n\"Yeah. I'm sorry.\"\nMy apology wasn't meant for Dorothy.\nDespite the pain contorting her face.\nDespite it being unbearable, she was smiling at me, trusting me.\nArte was weak to pain.\nShe couldn't even move when she had two large bruises on her side.\nYet, she was enduring the pain of having her chest cut open by a sword and was smiling at me.\nHer face was scrunched up, but she smiled as if to say she believed in me.\n\"...This is it.\"\nThump, thump.\nIn my right hand, I held Arte's still-beating heart.\nNo, should I call it something that looked like a heart?\nSomething that was functioning as her heart was in my hand.\nThat would be more accurate.\n\"...\"\nI timed it right.\nAmelia would be here in 3... 2... 1.\n\"I'm here! Are you guys still alive...? Yu Siwoo?! What are you doing...?!\"\n\"Heal Arte first. Quickly.\"\nAs Amelia arrived, I swiftly cut the heart and placed the crucible in its place.\nAmelia was shocked, but the healer she brought would prioritize saving lives and start the surgery.\nThey'd think it was impossible to save someone with just a crystal instead of a heart.\nBut they'd soon realize that the crystal could function as a heart.\nWith another injured person, Amelia would fetch someone else.\nEverything was proceeding as I knew it would.\n\"Dorothy.\"\n\"Yes...?\"\n\"Release the enhancement in thirty minutes. I need to pass out for a bit.\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"Even if I pass out, keep the enhancement active. Thirty minutes, okay?\"\nAfter giving Dorothy all the instructions, I swallowed the heart I took from Arte's chest.\nThe metallic taste filled my mouth, making me want to spit it out immediately.\nSometimes, having heightened senses was a curse.\nBut I forced it down. Arte had trusted me and given me her heart.\nShe believed in me and went that far, so I couldn't just spit it out because it tasted bad.\nArte's heart was a bit too large to swallow in one gulp.\nAs I swallowed it all, I heard a voice.\n[W-What is this...? W-What should I do? How do I...?!]\nAnd then my vision went black.\n\"Uwaaah! What is happening...?!\"\nThe girl was flustered.\nShe thought she was about to witness the heartwarming love story of the protagonist and the reader.\nBut suddenly, the protagonist raised a sword and pulled out the reader's heart, then swallowed it!\nThis wasn't a slasher movie with blood everywhere.\nEating the heart of the one you love, what kind of madness was this?\nNo, there was something more important.\nIf this continues, I'll be expelled...!\n\"W-What should I do...? How can I go back?!\"\n\"There is a way to go back.\"\n\"Really?! ...Wait a minute.\"\nThe girl was confused.\nNo one else should be able to enter this place.\nIf another transcendent forcibly entered, the space would collapse immediately.\nThe girl looked in the direction of the voice and was shocked.\nThe boy she set as the protagonist.\nThat boy was standing in front of her.\n\"You can go back outside this world.\"\n\"...How are you here?\"\nThe boy definitely swallowed the reader's heart.\nThat should have cut off his connection with the reader and connected him to the boy.\nBut how?\nHow did he come here?\n\"Who knows? I don't.\"\n\"W-What?! That's impossible...!\"\n\"I just knew that if I did this, I could come here. I won't be able to come here again.\"\nThe boy spoke to the dumbfounded girl.\n\"...Well, that's not important. I'm sorry, but you need to leave. Think of it as the owner's tyranny.\"\n\"Haha...! I don't know how you got in here...! Do you think I'll leave?! Do you know how hard it was for me to get here?!\"\n\"I know.\"\n\"...What?\"\nThe girl regained her composure.\nWhile it was surprising that the boy came here, that was all.\nEven if he was the protagonist, she could kill him instantly.\nNo matter what he did, the boy wouldn't be able to attack her and would just die there.\nRegaining her confidence, the girl was once again bewildered by the boy's words.\n\"I know you found this world intriguing and invaded it.\"\n\"I know you forced a hole through and could only send your eye to avoid detection.\"\n\"I know you needed a person to hide that eye since it would eventually be detected.\"\n\"I know you crafted Arte's body for that purpose and hid your eye in her heart.\"\n\"How...how do you know that?!\"\nShe hadn't told anyone.\nNot even other transcendent beings knew this.\nYet this mortal before her was reciting all of it.\n\"It’s not right to intrude into someone else’s home and mess around.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Remember when you told Arte that she was like your eye? I didn't expect your eye to literally be inside her.

You set it, didn’t you? That something extraordinary would emerge if it grew to its full potential. Well, here it is.\"\n\"?!\"\n\"Don’t worry, I’m not a mind reader. You’re just too predictable.\"\nMind readers exist elsewhere.\nThe boy muttered, leaving the girl seething in anger.\n\"Stop lying! That can't be true!\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"To fully develop that, it would take at least two more years...!\"\nYes, that couldn’t be possible.\nWhen she could still influence the boy's settings.\nShe planned to have a major event around the third year to resolve the loose ends.\nShe calculated that with the boy’s protagonist-like rapid growth and the events he would encounter, it would take about two years.\nThere’s no way he could have become this strong already.\nThere were no enhancement events...\n\"...You really are dumb. No wonder Arte kept complaining.\"\n\"What?!\"\n\"Did you really forget?\"\nTap, tap.\nThe boy lightly tapped his head and spoke to the girl.\n\"You set it up. That in life-threatening situations, I grow.\"\n\"...?!\"\n\"Man, I can’t even remember how many times I almost died today. How many was it?\"\nI lost count after fifty.\nThe boy mumbled, smiling brightly.\nIn contrast, the girl’s face turned pale.\n\"Also, there’s Dorothy’s enhancement. That’s a big factor.\"\n\"Then... so what?!\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"No matter how strong you get, you can't kill me!\"\nBut the girl regained her confidence once again.\nA mere mortal couldn't hurt her.\nNo matter how strong he became, he was just a mortal strengthened by her settings.\nUltimately, he was beneath her.\nThe girl thought so, and the boy agreed.\n\"You're right. I can't kill you. I probably can't even attack you.\"\n\"Haha...! Exactly! Just a mere mortal...\"\n\"But I can make you leave.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Did you ever explain your ability to Arte? About Schrödinger’s cat? It was a pretty novel explanation.\"\n\"...What are you trying to say?\"\n\"Just wanted to share a similar story.\"\nThe girl couldn’t understand what the boy was saying.\nShe didn’t want to understand.\n\"Some scientist once said. If there’s a being that knows everything about the universe, it could explain every phenomenon and predict the future.\"\n\"What does that...\"\n\"You are worthy of being called a god. Though you have a bit of a childish side. So, what should you call someone trying to expel a god?\"\n\"...A demon?\"\n\"Right. Someone opposing a god is a demon. And coincidentally, there's a demon with such an ability.\"\nA demon that knows the present.\nLaplace's demon.\nThat’s what his ability was.\nThe boy smiled as he spoke.\n\"And you think that can send me out? How?\"\n\"It's not difficult. Why do you think I swallowed your eye?\"\n\"To get here...\"\n\"No. It’s unrelated.\"\nThe boy didn't lose his smile.\nWas it a mocking smile or a pure smile of accomplishment?\n\"You’re watching the world through my eyes now, aren’t you?\"\n\"...\"\nThe boy wasn’t wrong.\nThe girl’s eye was now inside the boy.\nSo, she could see what he saw.\nEven if he lost consciousness, she could keep observing his surroundings.\n\"Your ability is to manipulate the world as you see fit when you can't observe it.\"\n\"...What are you trying to say?\"\n\"It's simple.\"\nThe boy finally laughed out loud.\nAs if he couldn’t hold back his laughter anymore.\n\"If you see the beginning to the end of this world, what can you do?\"",

      "content": "\"...What?\"\n\"Congratulations. From now on, you'll be able to know everything about this world.\"\nThe boy introduced his ability as a demon. With a devilish grin, he spoke to the girl.\n\"So that your ability will never work again.\"\n\"Eek...?!\"\nPanicking, the girl quickly reviewed the current situation. Killing the boy right now? Impossible. If she did, the story would be completely ruined.\nShe wanted to see a sweet love story between the protagonist and the reader, not a tragic tale of regret and loss.\nBut leaving the boy alone meant he would continue saying the most terrifying things from her perspective.\nIf the boy's claims were true, if he could indeed make her powerless...\nThen he would probably take out the eye inside his body immediately.\nThat would be the end.\nThe world must have already sensed something was wrong.\nThe moment the eye was exposed outside the protagonist's body, the world would expel it.\nIt might hold on for a bit, but eventually, it would be ejected with no way back.\nThe world, having sensed an external threat, would strengthen its defenses further.\nNo one, not even the girl, would be able to interfere with this world again.\nCheckmate.\nThe word echoed in the girl's mind.\nWhat to do...?\nAt that moment, a thought flashed through her mind.\nDespite being called foolish by other transcenders, she was still a transcender.\nShe found a flaw in the boy's claim.\n\"...Yes! That's impossible!\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"You're a human! Knowing everything about the world would drive you mad!\"\nYes, that was true.\nEven transcenders sought entertainment in remote worlds to stave off boredom.\nWhat would happen to a mere human who knew everything about the world?\nIt couldn't be good. It couldn't be.\nPerhaps fueled by her desperate wish, the boy nodded at her guess.\n\"You're right. Knowing everything about the world wouldn't end well.\"\n\"Good! Then let's make a deal!\"\nWhat should she offer?\nThe boy banishing her was a huge risk.\nHe wouldn't use that card lightly.\nIt was a card close to a threat, implying he might actually go through with it.\nBut it was an effective threat for the girl.\nWhat should she offer to prevent the boy from showing her everything about the world?\nAs the girl racked her brain, the boy directly refuted her thought.\n\"But I never said I'd be the one knowing everything.\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"You'll be the only one knowing everything.\"\n\"That's impossible...! You have to experience it for me to experience it too! You know that!\"\n\"My ability is like an imprint in my mind.\"\nThe boy began explaining his ability out of the blue.\nWhat was he talking about?\nThe girl trembled, listening to his explanation.\n\"Oh, I should avoid this. Oh, that person is going to do this. That kind of feeling.\"\n\"...What are you trying to say?\"\n\"It's simple.\"\nThe boy smiled his devilish grin again.\nA smile that suggested he knew exactly what she was thinking.\nAs the girl felt unease creeping in, the boy continued.\n\"I'm human, and you're a transcender. If I knew everything, I'd go mad.\"\n\"Yes! So let's make a deal...!\"\n\"The problem is the same. I'm human, and you're a transcender.\"\nThe boy tapped his head and said to the girl.\n\"My brain can't handle all that information at once, but yours can.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"If I learn everything through my ability, it means you process it much faster.\"\n\"...I don't understand. You'd still learn everything eventually, even if slower.\"\n\"You're missing one crucial fact.\"\n\"...Missing what?\"\nThe girl's voice shook with fear at the boy's confident tone.\nHer argument was solid.\nShe would process information faster, but he would still go mad eventually.\nOr so she thought.\nUntil the boy spoke again.\n\"Thanks to your settings, my ability has grown this much. I faced multiple life-threatening situations at once, growing incredibly strong.\"\n\"...\"\n\"But that alone wouldn't have made my ability this strong. I needed help.\"\n\"Are you talking about Dorothy's enhancement? What about it...?\"\n\"You should've realized by now. It's a trick. I used my ability as a loophole.\"\n\"...A trick?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nThe boy's next words made the girl gasp.\nHer premise crumbled in an instant.\n\"When you become omniscient, I'll probably be watching the birth of the universe.\"\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n\"By then, 30 minutes would have passed since I passed out.\"\n\"...30 minutes?\"\n\"Did you forget? Before I passed out, I asked Dorothy to release her enhancement after 30 minutes.\"\n\"?!\"\nThe girl's mind went cold as ice.\nSweat trickled down her forehead.\nNow that she thought about it, when she was panicking, the boy was saying something to the heroine candidate.\nThey were having a conversation?\nShe had been too flustered to pay attention.\n\"After 30 minutes, the connection to Laplace's demon will sever. Naturally, I won't see beyond my processing limits.\"\n\"No way...\"\n\"Yes. While you're becoming an omniscient god, I'll be watching a fantastic cosmic documentary. The subject? The birth of the universe.\"\n\"No, please...!\"\nThe girl screamed, realizing there was no way to stop it.\n\"Don't worry about me. I have no desire to be enhanced by Dorothy forever.\"\n\"You, you...!\"\nThe boy teased her with an annoying grin, but she could do nothing.\nShe could only watch in frustration.\nAs he observed her, the boy waved his hand mockingly.\n\"Even if you illegally intruded, a guest is a guest. I should show you around our home.\"\n\"Stop it! Please! I admit I was wrong!\"\n\"Here we are. From the birth of the universe to its end. Enjoy the view.\"\n\"No! Please! I'm begging you! What do you want? I'll do anything! Just tell me!\"\n\"Sorry, I'm a bit busy. I'll join you at first, but you'll be on your own eventually.\"\nThe boy activated his ability with a smile.\n\"So, enjoy the journey. Have a good trip.\"\n\"No! Please! Noooo!\"\nEven as the girl screamed, the boy did not stop.\nA torrent of information flooded both their minds.\n\"Ar...te! A...e! Are you...?! Ar...e!\"\nAs my fading consciousness slowly returned to the voices around me, I began to wake up.\n...What was I doing?\nRushing to help Siwoo and then...\nWe fought the monster together.\nI gave Siwoo my heart...\n\"...Gasp!\"\n\"We did it! She's alive!\"\n\"I can't believe it actually worked...\"\nI was right to trust Siwoo.\nMy faith, my trust was rewarded.\nEven though giving my heart should have killed me.\nSiwoo saved me somehow.\n\"Arte, are you okay? Can you see my fingers? How many...?\"\n\"Where's Siwoo?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Where is Siwoo?\"\nI wanted to run to Siwoo right away.\nTo know how he saved me.\nTo ask why he needed my heart.\nTo share everything with him.\nBut Siwoo wasn't near me, so I searched for him.\nThe others looked at me with disbelief, but I didn't care.\nSiwoo, where are you?\nAlways by my side, where are you now?\n\"Are you really looking for him as soon as you wake up? He stabbed your heart...\"\n\"That doesn't matter. Where is he?\"\n\"Sigh...\"\nRealizing they couldn't reason with me, Amelia sighed deeply.\n\"For some reason, he's passed out. He won't wake up for a while...\"\n\"...I knew it.\"\nAmelia started to explain, but I stopped listening.\nI saw Siwoo.\nAs always, he was there for me.\nIgnoring Amelia's words, I got up and approached him.\n\"...Arte, are you okay? You must be exhausted.\"\n\"I'm fine.\"\nHonestly, it was still hard to walk.\nBut that didn't matter.\n\"Because you're here.\"\nSmiling brightly, I hugged Siwoo.\nAs long as he was here, I could endure any pain and hardship.\nThis pain was nothing compared to that.",

      "content": "\"···Is this really the time for that? You should be resting.\"\n\"Oh, Amelia. Hello.\"\n\"Yeah, hello. Glad to see you're okay.\"\nAs I held Siwoo tightly, I heard Amelia sigh exasperatedly from behind. Rest, she said.\nI am resting.\n\"I'm resting exactly like this.\"\n\"They say old habits die hard…\"\nHonestly, I felt a bit embarrassed. But I decided to be shameless. I knew how Siwoo felt about me, and I knew how I felt about Siwoo. So, shouldn’t I be doing my best to keep him close?\nJust as I was justifying my feelings to myself and hugging Siwoo, he suddenly pushed me aside and moved urgently toward someone else.\n…What?\nDid he just leave me?\nA wave of jealousy surged, but as I realized why Siwoo had rushed to the white-coated doctor, my heart warmed.\n\"How is Arte? Are there any side effects?\"\n\"···She's fine, as you can see. She should avoid strenuous activities for a while, though.\"\n\"I see. Thank you.\"\nHe was concerned about me.\nEven though his ability probably assured him I was okay, he needed the confirmation.\nIt felt good to be cared for.\n\"By the way, what did you put in her? It feels like my mind is breaking. Seriously, it’s replacing her heart.\"\n\"Well, it’s a very dangerous artifact. I’ll explain everything later.\"\n\"Fine. For now, she needs to rest and recuperate...\"\n\"···Ah, this noise is annoying.\"\n\"What?\"\nIn the middle of their conversation, Siwoo suddenly got irritated. Always kind, Siwoo was now snapping at someone, not an enemy but someone he had been talking to amicably moments ago.\nWas there a problem? Maybe he got hurt badly somewhere?\nPeople's personalities can change after a head injury.\nAs I anxiously pondered, Siwoo suddenly drew his sword.\n\"Hey, Yusiwoo?! What are you doing?!\"\n\"···Oh, no?\"\nI was the only one who could stop Siwoo. The others were unarmed, and I could subdue him instantly with my threads. But I couldn’t even think of using my ability on him, just staring anxiously.\nSiwoo wouldn’t do this without reason.\nI believed in him.\nMy grip tightened, and Siwoo glanced at me.\n\"Sorry, Arte.\"\nThen he plunged the sword into his own stomach.\n\"What's wrong with you?!\"\n\"···Ouch, this really hurts. My head’s spinning.\"\n\"Emergency! Emergency! Nurse! Nurse!\"\nThe scene felt like it was underwater, the noise muffled. What just happened? What was Siwoo doing?\nSiwoo got hurt. Why?\nHe hurt himself.\n\"Why, why…!\"\nWhat to do, what to do, what to do.\nSiwoo told me not to worry, so I believed in him.\nI only believed in Siwoo.\nThe doctor frantically rang the emergency bell and rushed to Siwoo to administer first aid. But Siwoo pushed him away and put his hand inside his own stomach.\n\"Hey…! Are you insane…?\"\n[Waaaaaah! Waaaaaah!]\n\"···What's that?\"\n\"Oh, this?\"\nThe object Siwoo pulled from his stomach shocked me so much I forgot he had just injured himself.\nThat thing. The voice from it was all too familiar.\nI couldn’t not recognize it. I heard it every day.\n\"···Writer?\"\n[Waaaaah! This is so unfair!]\n\"I was planning to take it out, but it was too noisy. The doctor is here, so it’s the perfect timing. Sorry for worrying you.\"\nDespite the pain, Siwoo looked at me proudly. Though I couldn’t fully understand, I guessed he was impressed I’d endured the writer's presence.\n…Siwoo was more amazing.\nThe doctor and others started to treat Siwoo’s wound, staring at him like they’d seen a ghost.\n\"Hey, does that not hurt?\"\n\"Of course it hurts.\"\n\"Then why are you so calm?\"\n\"Because it’s over now.\"\n\"···Over?\"\n\"Yeah, over.\"\nAmelia asked, but Siwoo wasn’t talking to her. He was smiling at me.\n\"Arte. Don’t worry anymore. There’s no writer to torment you.\"\n\"···What? What do you mean?\"\n\"The writer was in your heart.\"\n\"···?\"\n\"And I ate it and showed them everything. Now the writer can’t do anything.\"\nMy heart… eaten?\nHuh?\nI couldn’t understand what Siwoo was saying. But the object in Siwoo’s hand—the thing he pulled from his stomach—was emitting the writer's voice.\nThe writer was wailing.\nSiwoo’s words were true.\n[Waaaaah! We could have made a deal!]\n\"There was no way I’d deal with you. The moment you got inside, I’d already won.\"\n[So unfair…!]\nMesmerized, I took the object from Siwoo. It was covered in his blood, but I didn’t care.\n\"So, you cut out my heart…?\"\n\"Yeah. To separate you from the writer.\"\n\"···Is it true the writer can’t do anything now? How?\"\n\"It’s complicated, but yeah. The writer’s powerless now. They’ll probably vanish soon.\"\n[Waaaaah!]\nThe writer’s voice grew fainter. Siwoo’s words must be true, considering how sorrowful the wailing was.\n\"···Writer?\"\n[Sniff, sniff…]\nThough the writer didn’t answer, I could tell they were listening. They always had.\n…What was I going to do?\nI often wondered what I would do if the writer disappeared.\nWould I go mad?\nThe writer was a ridiculous and pathetic existence. They dragged me into this world without warning.\nIf I were the me who had just arrived, I might have thrown this heart on the ground.\nBut I didn’t.\nI had become accustomed to living here…\nAnd I had someone I loved.\n\"···Writer?\"\n[Sniff, sniff… yes?]\nThey were scared I might lash out. The writer was watching me cautiously.\nYeah, I see.\nYou enjoyed it.\n\"How about this, then? What if you create your own world?\"\n[My own… world?]\n\"Yes. You have friends, don’t you?\"\nFrom what they’d told me, I could infer the writer wasn’t alone.\nThe writer responded quietly.\n\"You could make a world where you can interfere all you want.\"\n[···My own world?]\n\"It wouldn't be just yours. You’d create it with others.\"\nLike in Greek mythology, with many gods.\n\"And you’d compete against each other. Not in direct fights, but by raising champions.\"\n[Champions…]\n\"Yes. Saints, heroes, champions. Call them what you like.\"\nThe writer treated this world as a story. So, why not make a game-like world?\n\"Without tragedies, it can always be fun.\"\nIf transcendent beings saw the world as entertainment, why not make it a literal game?\n\"Do you like the idea?\"\n[···Yes!]\n\"Promise me you’ll make a world without tragedies.\"\n[Of course!]\nTime was running out. The writer’s voice grew fainter, and the heart began to crumble.\n[Bringing you here was the best choice ever! Thank you, reader.]\n\"···.\"\nAfter the heart crumbled, the writer’s noisy voice was gone.\nThey were really gone.\n\"···How do you feel?\"\n\"I don’t know.\"\nIs this what they call bittersweet?\nThe writer was really gone. It felt lonely.\n\"···Thank you.\"\n\"Don’t mention it.\"\nSiwoo and I smiled at each other.",

      "content": "For a while after that, I couldn't see Siwoo at all.\nIt was all because of the doctor who had been incredibly focused on providing emergency care, ignoring everything we said.\nWhen she pressed the emergency bell, it summoned the medical staff waiting in the ward in an instant, and we were quickly isolated.\nHonestly, I felt a bit disappointed that I couldn’t stay with Siwoo longer, but...\nI quietly accepted it when they said if I didn’t rest now, I might spend the rest of my life in bed.\nTheir intentions were clear, trying to keep us apart, but Siwoo had thought it through and acted accordingly, so I didn’t resist.\nWith the writer gone and Siwoo out of reach, I initially worried about how I'd cope with the boredom, but...\nFortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, I ended up busier than ever.\n\"···Sorry.\"\n\"It's okay. We'll take it one step at a time.\"\nDorothy encouraged me with a calm smile.\nWas she being considerate, or did she really think it was fine?\nSighing, I looked at the recently graded paper.\nRed marks rained down like blood.\n\"But this... This is more shocking than I thought. We'll need to adjust our plans.\"\n\"···.\"\nDorothy spoke in a troubled voice, but I couldn't say anything. I just sat there, feeling ashamed.\n\"How have you managed so far?\"\nDorothy waved the paper in my hand, and I hastily reached out to grab it, worried someone might see it.\nBut Dorothy skillfully avoided my hand and kept waving the test paper, like she was showing me my own reality.\nEmbarrassment washed over me, and I covered my face with my hands.\n···I couldn't help but offer a small excuse.\n\"But... Most of the time, the writer handled things... They told me what I needed to know...\"\nYeah.\nI was learning the basics of this world, one step at a time.\nIt had been about a year since I landed here.\nA long time, or a short time, depending on how you look at it.\nHonestly, considering all that had happened over the past year, it felt like time had flown by.\n···Yeah, that's right. It must be.\n\"Sigh... That writer guy...\"\n\"···.\"\nDorothy had listened to my story about the writer and me, and surprisingly, she accepted it calmly.\nWas it because she hadn't experienced it herself, or did she not fully understand and just let it slide?\nI'm not sure.\nBut one thing was certain: Dorothy was more interested in me than in the writer, who could no longer affect anything.\n\"If you go out into society like this... Ugh.\"\nI’m not an idiot.\nFeeling a bit stung, I was about to say that I didn't need Dorothy to worry about me, but then I saw the red-marked paper in her hand and shut my mouth.\n···Dorothy had been shocked to learn I had only been in this world for less than a year.\nAnd that's how this started.\nLearning basic knowledge.\n\"How did you manage to attend academy classes without knowing these basics?\"\n\"I slept.\"\n\"···.\"\nWas it because of my half-closed eyes that no one noticed whether I was sleeping or not?\n\"Sigh...\"\nDorothy sighed, as if she found my future bleak, and I felt a surge of frustration.\nIt’s not fair.\nI mean, I came from a world where mana was only a figment of imagination, and I was suddenly dropped into a world where mana actually existed and people used it like superpowers.\nEven if using it was possible, I wouldn’t have known the theory behind it.\nI wouldn’t know what even elementary school kids learn here.\n···But to Dorothy, it must sound ridiculous.\nTo her, it would be like hearing that someone her age didn’t know their multiplication tables.\n\"Didn't you answer well when the teacher asked questions sometimes?\"\n\"···The writer told me.\"\n\"···.\"\nDorothy seemed to decide that this line of questioning was pointless and changed the topic.\n\"···Okay, let's assume you didn't know.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"But not knowing this is a bit much, isn't it?\"\nDorothy brought out another paper, also marked with red.\n···Seeing what was written on it, I instinctively turned my head away.\nEven I thought it was a bit much.\n\"How do you not know your menstrual cycle?!\"\nDorothy's voice rose in frustration.\nI looked around quickly, hoping no one had overheard the embarrassing topic, and tried to cover Dorothy’s mouth, but she was relentless.\n\"Well, it's just that...\"\nThe reason I didn't know my cycle was simple.\nI had never had one.\nHonestly, it wasn't something I paid attention to.\nBefore coming to this world, it was irrelevant, and after arriving here, daily crises kept me from thinking about it.\n···Since the writer created this body, I don't even know why I don't have periods.\nDorothy had been appalled when she discovered I didn’t know my cycle and took me to a doctor, but they said there was nothing wrong.\nRealizing that discussing this with me was pointless, Dorothy sighed deeply.\n\"Sigh... You don't even know basic makeup application...\"\n\"Well, isn’t that unnecessary? I think I look fine as is.\"\n\"No?! It’s very important!\"\nDorothy grabbed my cheeks and shouted.\nStartled by her unexpected reaction, I tried to pull away, but she held on tightly.\n\"I mean, you’re pretty as you are, but... You could be even prettier with makeup.\"\n\"I don’t nee-...\"\n\"Siwoo would like it, though.\"\n\"···.\"\nTwitch.\nDid I really need to learn makeup?\nI was considering dismissing the idea, but at the mention of Siwoo, I found myself reconsidering.\n\"Even if you don't usually wear it, doing it occasionally will drive men crazy.\"\n\"···Really?\"\n\"Yes. You think you don’t need it because you're already pretty? That's true, but...\"\nDorothy let go of my cheeks and continued.\n\"But when someone who usually doesn’t wear makeup does, it’s a whole different experience.\"\nI think I understand what she means, but...\nHonestly, I wasn’t sure.\nHow would I know, having never been in a relationship?\nHaving always lived a life far from romance, I couldn’t judge if Dorothy's words were true.\nMakeup, huh.\n\"Do you really think Siwoo would like it?\"\n\"Absolutely. You're already beautiful, and with makeup, anyone would fall for you.\"\n\"···I don't need that.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nWhen I firmly denied her statement, Dorothy's voice filled with confusion.\n\"···As long as Siwoo likes it, that's enough. I don't care what anyone else thinks.\"\n\"···.\"\nEven I felt my face flush from the bold declaration I had just made.\nAs long as Siwoo likes it.\nIt was a spontaneous outburst, but I didn’t feel like taking it back.\nIt wasn’t wrong, after all.\n\"···Is today the day you're being discharged?\"\n\"Huh? Oh, yeah, it is.\"\nWhy bring up my discharge all of a sudden?\nWe'd discussed it a few days ago, so there was no confusion.\nDorothy rummaged through a surprisingly heavy bag and pulled something out.\n\"···Makeup?\"\n\"Yes, makeup.\"\nPulling out makeup products mid-conversation, I was momentarily thrown off by Dorothy’s sudden action.\nBut then she made a suggestion.\n\"Would you like to learn how to use it?\"\n\"···Okay.\"\nIf it were the me who first landed in this world, I would have fiercely rejected the idea, even getting angry about why I needed makeup.\nBut now, I nodded.\nI had changed so much that I could almost be considered a different person from back then.\n\"Then how about I do your makeup today? Just to see how it feels?\"\nAfter a brief moment of contemplation, I nodded.\nHonestly, I was a little curious.\nI already had a pretty face without much effort...\nBut seeing how persistent Dorothy was, I thought there might be something more to it.\nAnd after a while, as Dorothy worked on my face for what felt like ages, just as I was about to lose patience, she handed me a mirror.\n\"There, all done.\"\n\"···Wow.\"\nLooking in the mirror, I understood why Dorothy had been so insistent.\nWell, it might sound like bragging, but...\nI looked really pretty.\n\"Pretty, right?\"\n\"Yeah. Very pretty...\"\nIt was amazing.\nShe just applied some stuff here and there, and my face changed so much.\nI was glad I let her do my makeup.\nWouldn't Siwoo like this look?\n\"···Ahem, ahem.\"\n\"Oh, sorry.\"\nMaybe because I was staring at the mirror for too long, Dorothy nudged me. Did she want the mirror back?\nI hastily handed it over, but Dorothy waved her hand dismissively.\n\"Oh, no. Not that...\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"It’d be a shame to wash it off after all that work... How about you keep it on for the day?\"\nKeep it on for the day?\n···After a brief consideration, I nodded.\nSure, it was a bit tedious, but Dorothy put in a lot of effort.\nWhile it was just tedious for me, it could be a masterpiece to Dorothy.\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Then... It’s almost time. Do you want to handle the discharge paperwork first? I need to clean up here.\"\n\"Sure. I'll be quick.\"\nAs Arte changed clothes and left the room, Dorothy wiped the sweat from her forehead and sighed.\n\"Sigh... She didn't notice...\"\nDorothy quickly sent a text to Amelia.\n\"Arte is coming up...

      "content": "“...Amelia? Long time no see.”\nAfter completing the discharge process, I saw Amelia and greeted her.\nShe had been so busy lately that I rarely got to see her, but now we had met.\n“What a coincidence. How have you b...”\n“...Who are you?”\n“What?”\nI was taken aback by Amelia’s response.\nThere’s no way Amelia wouldn’t recognize me, right?\nWhat on earth...?\nOut of habit, I almost called for the writer but stopped myself.\nThe writer was no longer there.\nI had become so used to relying on the writer whenever something confusing or unexpected happened.\nI was at a loss for words, trying to figure out what to say.\nThen, Amelia smiled and spoke up.\n“Sorry, just a little joke.”\n“...”\n“Ow, ow, I’m sorry! That hurts!”\nMaking me worry like that.\nI tugged hard on Amelia’s golden hair as punishment for her prank.\nAfter a while, I let go, and she rubbed her head, groaning.\n“Ugh, that hurt.”\n“Then why pull a prank like that?”\n“Well, at first, I really didn’t recognize you...”\n“...What?”\n“I figured it out quickly, but at first glance, you look different. You did your makeup, right?”\nSo it was because of the makeup.\nI thought I looked pretty, but was the difference that noticeable?\n“...Anyway, today’s the day you’re getting discharged, right?”\n“Yeah, I just finished the process.”\n“Good. What about the scar? You got hurt pretty badly on your chest.”\n“Thanks to the skilled medical staff, there’s no scar.”\n“That’s a relief. Be careful with Siwoo’s heart.”\n“Wh-what...!”\n“Am I wrong?”\nI closed my mouth as Amelia smirked and pushed her sunglasses up.\nShe wasn’t like this before.\nSince the incident ended, Amelia had been approaching me more freely.\nI liked that we were getting closer, but...\nThe fatigue I thought would disappear with the writer’s absence was coming from an unexpected source.\nSensing that continuing the conversation would only lead to more teasing from Amelia, I decided to change the topic.\n“...By the way, did you watch a spy movie or something?”\n“Huh?”\n“With the sunglasses and coat. ...Aren’t you cold?”\nThe weather had turned chilly, with a noticeable drop in temperature.\nWearing just a coat was enough during the day, but it would be cold at night.\nI looked at her with concern, and Amelia stammered, looking flustered.\n“Y-yeah...! Something like that... Ha-ha. Just wanted to get into the mood.”\n“...?”\nHer unusually intense reaction made me look at her more closely.\nAmelia started to sweat nervously.\n...Well, alright.\nI decided to let it go.\nEven if Amelia was up to something, it wouldn’t be as bad as the writer.\n“So? What brings you here?”\n“Oh, that...! Do you have any plans now?”\n“Well, I was planning to see Siwoo.”\nI had extended my hospital stay just to be discharged together with Siwoo.\nOur discharge dates were the same, after all.\nAmelia should know that too, right?\n“If you’re suggesting we hang out to celebrate, I’m sorry, but it’ll have to wait. I want to spend time with Siwoo...”\n“He left already.”\n“Huh? What did you just say...”\n“Siwoo left earlier.”\nDid I hear that right?\nI looked at Amelia, but she seemed confident, unlike her earlier flustered state.\n“He left?”\n“Yes. He completed his discharge and left.”\n“...When?”\n“About thirty minutes ago.”\nMy excitement plummeted.\nSiwoo had left first.\nWithout me.\n“...Do you know where he went?”\n“Well, he said he was tired and wanted to rest at home...”\n“Thanks.”\nI thanked Amelia and left the hospital.\nHuh, I see.\nHe left without me?\n...Unforgivable.\nI had planned everything to leave together, but he went home alone to rest?\nI was so excited to spend time with Siwoo.\nBut it seemed Siwoo didn’t feel the same way.\nWas I a burden to him?\nDid he want to be alone sometimes and left me behind to go home?\nWas the promise to leave together so insignificant to him?\nVarious thoughts swirled in my mind.\nHe had said he would always be by my side.\nI fiddled with the bracelet Siwoo had given me, trying to calm myself.\nFeeling slightly better, I headed to Siwoo’s house.\n“...Yeah, she’s on her way to your place. She should be there in about... thirty minutes? I’ll text you when she’s close. Got it.”\n“She’s on her way?”\n“Yeah. It’s finally happening. It’s been a long time coming.”\nAmelia and Dorothy watched Arte walking away, her emotions fluctuating between anger and sadness.\nSeeing her emotions swing back and forth made them feel guilty.\n“...Is this really okay?”\n“Probably... We might need to brace ourselves for a punch later.”\n“Sigh... It would’ve been better to do it normally...”\nDorothy sighed, anticipating the backlash they would face later.\n“If she finds out Siwoo’s discharge date wasn’t actually today, she might really lose it...”\n“We had no choice. We needed time to prepare.”\n“She might not just be angry... She might use a lot of threads...”\n“Ha-ha... Siwoo will handle it, right?”\nYeah, definitely.\nThis was all Siwoo’s idea, after all.\nThey began to rationalize their actions.\nThe fact that they were more eager than Siwoo to execute the plan because it sounded fun was... well, beside the point.\n“Since it’s come to this, we might as well enjoy it!”\n“...Right! Let’s go quickly!”\n“Alright. Amelia’s express transport...! This time, to Siwoo’s house!”\n“...”\nI stood in front of Siwoo’s house, staring blankly.\nSince I started living with him, I rarely noticed the curtains drawn over the windows.\nPeeking through the gap in the curtains, I could see it was getting dark, but there were no lights on inside.\n“He must be sleeping...”\nAccording to Amelia, Siwoo had come home earlier.\nWith the lights off, he must have gone to bed, exhausted.\nI quietly entered the house, careful not to wake him.\n“I’m home...”\nI muttered softly, hoping and not hoping at the same time that Siwoo wouldn’t hear me.\n...There was still no response.\nWas Siwoo’s house always this cold?\nAlthough it hadn’t been long since I started living here, it felt different.\nThud, thud.\nIn the quiet space, my footsteps echoed loudly.\nMaybe because of that feeling, I couldn’t help but think about how anxious I felt the first time I came to Siwoo’s house.\n“...”\n...Too much.\nHe said he would always be with me.\nDidn’t he like me?\nIf we set the discharge dates together, shouldn’t we leave together?\nNo matter how tired he was...\nWalking through Siwoo’s dark and cold house, my mind was filled with various thoughts.\nTo lift my spirits, I decided to go to bed early tonight. As I passed the living room...\nA soft light began to glow from one side of Siwoo’s house.\n“...Huh?”\nThe light seemed to guide me, leading the way.\nWithout thinking of an enemy attack, I followed the light as if enchanted.\nI didn’t fully understand what was happening, but I felt like I had to follow the light now.\nFollowing the gradually brightening blue light, I found myself in the backyard.\nAnd standing in the middle of the light was Siwoo.\nSo he wasn’t sleeping.\nWhat was happening?\nI had a million questions to ask him, but I couldn’t speak.\nI was overwhelmed by Siwoo’s presence.\nWas he nervous? I could see his hands trembling slightly.\n“Um, I’m a bit nervous. Dorothy and Amelia said events like this are important, so I tried to prepare...”\nMaybe because I had never done something like this before, it might seem a bit stiff.\nSaying that, Siwoo slowly approached me.\nMy mind was still in chaos, unable to grasp the situation.\nJust as I was about to ask what was happening, Siwoo spoke first.\n“...Arte.”\n“Y-yes?”\n“Would you... go out with me?”\nFinally, I understood everything.\nAh, Siwoo was confessing to me.\nSo that’s what this was all about.\nWanting to surprise me, he had secretly come home first to prepare.\nStaring at the ring Siwoo offered, I saw his hand trembling slightly.\n“...Oh.”\n“Arte...?!”\nTears streamed down my face.\nThey showed no sign of stopping.\nI knew Siwoo liked me.\nI thought I understood it fully, but...\nMaybe I didn’t.\nSeeing my tears, Siwoo looked flustered, and I grabbed his head and pulled him close.\n“Mm...!”\nOur first kiss was clumsy and awkward, just a simple touch of our lips.\nBut it filled me with a sense of fulfillment and warmth, as if I had the whole world.\nHow much had he practiced to confess his love?\nHow nervous must he have been, worrying about being rejected?\nIt was the first time I saw Siwoo, with his instinct, trembling like that.\nAfter the clumsy first kiss ended, I smiled at Siwoo.\nThe happiest smile in the world.\n“...Yes, I’d love to.”\nI hugged Siwoo again and kissed him, this time slowly and lovingly, confirming our love for each other.",

      "content": "“···?”\nI froze in my tracks, a strange sensation gripping me. My hurried steps came to an abrupt halt as I blinked at the unbelievable scene unfolding before my eyes.\n\"Where... am I?\"\nJust one blink. Or was it a single step? I couldn’t tell. My mind was too muddled to make sense of it. In what seemed like an instant, the place I had been walking just moments ago had transformed into something completely different, as if the world had shifted in a heartbeat.\n[Hello!]\n“···?”\nI stood still for a long moment, taking in my surroundings, but nothing changed. The landscape that had changed so abruptly still lay before me, leaving me in a state of utter confusion.\nWhat is going on? The bewilderment was overwhelming. Suddenly, a voice greeted me, breaking the eerie silence.\nFrantically looking around, I saw no one. The narrow alley I found myself in was completely deserted, a stark contrast to the bustling street I had been walking on earlier. There was no one who could have greeted me.\nA voice in an empty place.\nDeciding it was a dream, I tried to dismiss it.\n\"Is this a lucid dream...?\"\n[It’s not a dream!]\nWhenever I dream, my mind usually feels foggy, like everything is shrouded in mist. Yet here I was, fully aware and dreaming. Despite the persistent voice in my head telling me otherwise...\n\"Fascinating,\" I muttered, looking around with a sense of wonder. I clearly remembered everything I did today, but now it all felt like a dream. Just looking at the dark alley brought a strange joy. My phone had disappeared, but I didn’t care. I felt like I was experiencing something extraordinary.\nDo people who have lucid dreams always feel this way? I've heard they practice a lot to be able to dream like this. Maybe I should try it too, I thought as I continued to explore.\nThen, the voice in my head shouted again.\n[It's not a dream! How can I explain this…?]\n\"Ugh, this is annoying,\" I muttered. Where was the voice coming from? I wished it would just disappear, but nothing changed. In a lucid dream, shouldn’t I be able to control things?\n\"Hey, look at this pretty girl.\"\n\"What brings you here? Want to hang out with us?\"\n\"As if she'd want to. Dumbass.\"\n\"Maybe. Hehe.\"\nWhat now? Ignoring the voice, I noticed two thugs laughing and harassing a woman. Did I really have this much imagination? Their realistic appearance made me want to walk away.\n\"Hey, are you ignoring us?\"\n\"Feisty, huh? So that's how it is?\"\nI felt a bit sorry for the woman but didn’t intend to help. After all, she was just a dream character. She’d disappear once I left... right?\n\"···?\"\n\"You can't ignore us.\"\n\"When someone talks to you, you should respond.\"\nWhat were these guys doing? Why were they coming towards me? I had no intention of interfering.\n\"Ugh, this is getting annoying.\"\nMy body shook suddenly, and my vision blurred. It felt like something was holding me back. When I turned to look, one of the thugs had grabbed my wrist.\nWas it the sudden grip that made my wrist hurt? Wait, pain?\n\"Coming here uninvited, huh? Ignoring us isn’t gonna fly.\"\n\"I thought you were some superhuman. Turns out you're just a pretty face.\"\n\"If a regular person comes into this alley, they shouldn't expect to leave unharmed, got it?\"\nI barely heard the thugs’ chatter as I stared at the pain in my wrist.\n\"Not... a dream?\"\nDreams don’t hurt, do they? The thugs looked at me with a mix of concern and confusion as I muttered to myself.\n\"Hey, is she okay?\"\n\"I don't know. She seems out of it. But she's pretty, so she’ll sell well.\"\n\"Yeah, maybe.\"\nA girl? These guys were talking to a girl earlier, right? Realizing this, I quickly looked around. My eyes fell on the slender arm still gripped by the thug.\n\"Wait, what...?\"\nIt was then that I noticed the strangeness of my own body. All the oddities I had dismissed as part of a dream came rushing back to reality. The slender arm. The heavy chest and the lower viewpoint than usual. A delicate voice, low yet unmistakably female.\nChanges so significant that I couldn’t believe I hadn’t noticed them. The truth was clear: the girl these thugs had been talking to was me.\n\"This... what is this...?\"\n\"This girl still doesn't get it.\"\n\"We're lucky. She's even better than I thought. Hey.\"\nWhile I was still in shock, one of the thugs looked me up and down, his eyes filled with a predatory gleam. Realizing the danger, I tried to pull my arm free and run, but my new, weaker body couldn’t break free from their grip.\n\"Let go, let go...!\"\n\"Huh? What's this?\"\n\"Seems like she's come to her senses?\"\n\"Annoying.\"\nWhat’s happening? If this isn’t a dream, did I really move to this strange place in the blink of an eye? And why is my body different?\nI set aside these questions and struggled to escape, but my efforts only resulted in more violence.\n\"Ugh, ugh...!\"\n\"Stop struggling and stay still!\"\nThe blows weren’t severe enough to cause serious injury, but to someone unaccustomed to violence, they were painful.\nIt hurt. It hurt so much.\n[Hmm... This isn’t good. Getting beaten by these extras…]\nWhy is this happening to me? What’s going on?\nJust as tears of frustration began to well up, the voice in my head spoke again.\n[Reader, you need to get out of this situation!]\n\"Get out... how...?\"\n\"Shut up and stay still!\"\n\"Ah, ahhh...!\"\nRepeating the voice’s words out loud, one of the thugs kicked me harder, his eyes filled with malice. All I could do was curl up and endure their abuse.\n[Hmm... how do I explain this... You have something called mana. Do you understand?]\nMana? Inside my body? It was a pathetic explanation, but I had no choice but to listen. To survive.\nGrasping at straws, I tried to find this something inside me. Is this it?\n[Found it? Now, release it with a bang!]\nRelease it? How? The instructions were vague, but I followed them. The result was shocking.\n\"Ahhhh! My arm...!\"\n\"?! Are you okay?\"\n\"Fuck, shit...!\"\nWith a sharp sound, something thin and sharp cut through the air. A string? I watched in shock as a thin string fell in front of me, leaving a long cut on the thug’s arm. His hand, the one that had been hitting me, was severed.\n\"Crazy... Are you a superhuman? Why didn’t you do anything before?\"\n\"Are you okay?!\"\n\"No time for that! Kill her now!\"\n\"Hiccup!\"\nFear overwhelmed me. This unfamiliar place, the strange voice, my transformed body. I did the only thing I could think of. As the thugs moved to kill me, I followed the voice’s instructions again, more forcefully this time.\nThe result was horrifying.\n\"···Huh?\"\nWith a wet thud, pieces of flesh and blood scattered around. The man’s fingers, aimed at me, fell to the ground.\n\"Ugh...!\"\nSeeing the gruesome sight, I vomited. I didn’t know how I did it, but I knew one thing for sure.\nI killed them.\n[Hmm, more shocking than I expected…]\nAs I continued to retch, the voice in my head mumbled.\n[It was tough, but look! You’re safe now, right?]\n\"Ugh... safe...?\"\nRaising my head, I regretted it instantly. The bodies were gone. Disappeared as if they had never existed.\n[Reader, are you okay?]\n\"···.\"\nThat’s when I realized. This wasn’t just a voice in my head. It was something much more dangerous.\n\"What... what are you...?\"\n[Hehe, I used some power! Don’t worry, those were just dolls!]\n\"Dolls?\"\n[Yes, dolls! Extras that don’t even make it to the stage!]\nAfter that, the voice babbled on about how it had brought me here, wanting to make the world more exciting. Most of it was incomprehensible, but I understood one thing.\n\"···What should I call you?\"\n[Hmm... call me Writer!]\n\"Writer...?\"\n[Yes!]\nI looked around. The blood-soaked scene was gone, as if it had never existed.\nAnd that was how I first met the Writer.",

      "content": "\"···So? What’s the problem?\"\nAmelia sighed as she looked at the slumped figure of Arte.\nI thought all of this was over, and now I'd just be witnessing their lovey-dovey moments.\nBut no, apparently not. These two inexperienced lovebirds were struggling more than expected. Despite that passionate kiss…\nEven Siwoo, who I didn’t expect to be so forward, surprised me. They must have forgotten we were watching. Dorothy and I sure had a show to watch, though!\n\"Is your boyfriend abusing you or something?\"\n\"N-No! It's not that…\"\nArte flailed her hands in protest at my question.\nI never actually suspected that, though. Siwoo would never lay a hand on Arte. He almost died a few times trying to protect her.\nIt was just a question to get her talking. And sure enough, Arte seemed to resolve herself to speak up after a moment of hesitation.\n\"···It's just... Do you think I’m unattractive?\"\n\"What kind of nonsense is that?\"\nMy irritation spiked at her unexpected confession, and I poked her chubby arm.\n\"Ouch!\"\n\"I meant for it to hurt. Who told you such nonsense?\"\nArte twisted and tried to cover herself with her hands, but it was pointless. Her ample chest was impossible to hide with such feeble attempts. Besides, my ability is acceleration—I’ve never lost in a physical fight. Realizing she couldn’t stop my poking, Arte slumped, and I stopped.\n\"···So? Why do you think that?\"\nArte had never shown such a lack of confidence before. What on earth had happened?\nI could guess, though. It had to be because of Siwoo. He was the only one she wanted to impress.\nSure enough, Arte sighed deeply and said, \"I'm not sure if Siwoo really likes me.\"\nWhat kind of nonsense was that? I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.\nArte took my silence as a prompt to continue, \"Since we started dating, I… well, we've been living together, right?\"\n\"Yeah, and you were already living together before that.\"\n\"But nothing has happened.\"\n\"What?\"\nNothing had happened? What did she mean by that? Seeing my confusion, Arte blushed deeply.\n\"I mean... I tried to, you know, make a move… but he didn't respond.\"\n\"···Really?\"\nI couldn’t believe my ears. Arte, making a move?\n\"···Seriously?\"\n\"Y-Yeah…\"\nArte nodded, her face turning even redder.\n\"Wow, I see...\"\nWell, it wasn’t that surprising. Anyone who knew about their relationship probably expected Arte to be the one making the first move. But if she had, and now she was here asking for advice, it meant she had failed.\n\"Did you fail?\"\n\"···Yes.\"\nOf course. If she had succeeded, there would be no need for this conversation. She had tried to seduce Siwoo and failed, leading to her confidence plummeting.\n\"How did you try?\"\n\"I wore this. Crawled into bed with it…\"\nShe handed me a photo. Curious, I looked at it and was stunned.\n\"W-What the hell? This looks like something a slut would wear!\"\n\"S-Slut?!\"\n\"No, I mean… Look at this!\"\nThe outfit itself wasn’t the problem. A thin shirt and dolphin shorts—casual enough for home but revealing enough to be suggestive. But there was a bigger issue.\n\"You weren’t wearing any underwear? And you did this in front of Siwoo?!\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"And you crawled into his bed?\"\n\"I hugged him from behind.\"\n\"?!\"\nThrough the thin white fabric, a hint of pink peeked through. As a woman, I found the outfit scandalous. Arte had crawled into Siwoo’s bed in this, rubbing her ample chest against him.\nAnd yet, nothing happened?\n\"Is Siwoo… impotent?\"\n\"N-No! He’s not impotent…\"\n\"?\"\nHow do you know that? I looked at her with suspicion, and Arte, realizing her mistake, began to stammer.\n\"T-That is, I mean…\"\n\"Fine, he’s not impotent. Got it?\"\n\"···Yes.\"\nHmm. I wanted to tell her to just jump him, but seeing her blush, it seemed she was interested but still had some hesitation. Maybe she was thinking they should do those things because they were a couple now.\nThis was giving me a headache. Why was I the one getting these questions?\nLost in thought, I stared at the ceiling, wondering why I was even doing this. The more I thought about it, the more drained I felt.\n\"Sorry, I really don’t know.\"\n\"Oh… okay.\"\n\"Let’s talk about it tomorrow. I’ll bring Dorothy, too.\"\n\"D-Dorothy?\"\n\"The more, the merrier. And it’s not like we’re going to spread this around.\"\n\"Okay… Thanks.\"\n\"No problem. Can you go now? I have something to do.\"\n\"Sure. See you tomorrow.\"\nAs soon as Arte left, I slumped in the café chair, chewing on my straw. I didn’t actually have anything to do. I just didn’t want to do anything right now.\nWhy was I giving relationship advice?\nJust as I was wallowing in my thoughts, someone unexpected approached.\n\"Hey, Amelia.\"\n\"···Siwoo?\"\nThe very person I had just been discussing. Siwoo had come looking for me.\n\"How did you know I’d be here?\"\n\"Just had a feeling.\"\n\"Damn it…\"\nThat intuition of his again. He’d stopped training to enhance it because he didn’t want it to grow any further. It made sense. He was growing so fast he didn’t need to train anymore.\n\"So? Why did you come?\"\n\"···I need some advice.\"\n\"Advice?\"\nArte came to me for advice, and now Siwoo? I wanted to tell him to come back later, but then I remembered Arte’s consultation. This might be related.\nSiwoo hesitated before speaking, \"Living with Arte has been tough lately.\"\n\"···Tough?\"\n\"Yeah. It's a bit awkward to say, but Arte dresses pretty skimpy at home.\"\n\"···How do you know that?\"\n\"I just do. Continue.\"\nAfter casting a suspicious glance at me, he continued, \"It’s getting harder to resist her. What should I do?\"\n\"Why are you asking me?\"\n\"Because… you’re you.\"\n\"I’m a girl too, you know!\"\n\"Yeah, I know.\"\n\"···\"\nWhat does he see me as? Did he see me as some creature called Amelia instead of a woman?\nHis question, \"How do I deal with finding Arte increasingly attractive and harder to resist?\"\n\"I don’t know! Just go for it!\"\n\"?!\"\n\"Why are you asking me this? Just kiss and get on with it!\"\n\"Wait, Amelia. You seem a bit too worked up. Calm down…\"\n\"Calm down? Do I look calm? Just go have sex already! Ugh!\"\nMaybe because I shouted, we got kicked out of the café.",

      "content": "Lately, we hadn't been attending the academy. The reason was simple: the aftermath of the incident at the frontline.\nOur contributions had been significant enough that the academy suggested we take some time off to recover. Though our bodies had healed, they thought the young ones might still be struggling mentally from the traumatic events.\nGiven the scale of the incident, which nearly wiped out the frontline heroes, it made sense. The academy had granted us a break, understanding the unique circumstances of our involvement in such a perilous situation.\nAnd so, here I was, adjusting my outfit as I waited for Siwoo on a morning when other students were likely heading to school.\n\"···Amelia, are you sure this is okay?\"\n-Of course, it’s fine. How could it not be?\nAmelia's confident voice rang in my ears through the phone. She seemed convinced this plan would work, but I had my doubts.\n\"I’m not sure...\"\n-What’s not to be sure about?\nCan this really help me and Siwoo… with that? Honestly, I was skeptical. Trying to seduce Siwoo seemed unrelated to coming here. When I voiced my doubts, Amelia sighed heavily and scolded me.\n-Think about it, Arte. Why did you try to seduce Siwoo?\n\"Wahhh! Stop!\"\n-Amelia sighed deeply. Fine. Why did you try to seduce Siwoo in the first place?\n\"Why do you ask...?\"\nBecause I wanted to act like a couple. I wanted to do things that would make Siwoo happy. Because that's what couples do.\n-Exactly. You tried to seduce Siwoo for that reason, right?\n\"Yeah.\"\n-Then this is okay too, right?\n\"...Maybe.\"\n-Sure it is. You need to take things step by step.\nAmelia’s reasoning was sound. Sure, couples don’t just do that all the time. Today was our first time going out together somewhere alone.\n-I mean, you two haven’t even been on a proper date yet, and you're already jumping ahead...\n\"I’m not jumping ahead!\"\n-Right, right. Make sure to have dinner at home. A homemade meal has more impact than you think.\n\"I suppose...\"\nAmelia’s advice was spot on. A meal made by a loved one sounded incredibly romantic. Maybe it was because I’d never been in a relationship before that I had such fantasies.\nBut there was one big problem.\n\"There’s nothing in the fridge...\"\n-Really? I’ll have Grandpa deliver some groceries then.\n\"What? Is that okay?\"\n-It’s not a big deal. A few groceries aren’t expensive for me, you know that, right?\n\"···Thanks.\"\n-No problem. Just remember, you promised to make me a dress. Make it pretty.\n\"Leave it to me.\"\nWith the sudden free time, I didn’t have much to do. Ever since I fell into this world, all I had done was stalk Siwoo. Trying to play games felt awkward; I’d get bored quickly. Going out alone wasn’t appealing either.\nSure, spending time with Siwoo was fun, but I always felt like I was imposing on him.\nThat’s why I took up making clothes as a hobby. Manipulating threads was a perfect fit for me. At first, it felt awkward, but soon I got the hang of it, and Amelia even praised the intricate clothes I could make.\nPerhaps because she liked my work, Amelia demanded one of my handmade dresses in exchange for planning today’s schedule. While I was chatting with Amelia, Siwoo arrived much earlier than expected.\n\"Sorry, am I late?\"\n\"···! No, not at all! I just got here myself!\"\nThat was a lie. I had been so excited about our outing that I had left far too early. We lived in the same house, so he knew it was a lie.\nYet, I still lied, hoping Siwoo wouldn’t feel pressured, putting my selfish desire first. Siwoo, aware of my early departure, smiled awkwardly.\n\"We could have come together...\"\n\"I don’t want to!\"\n\"Why? It’s better if we arrive together.\"\n\"B-Because…\"\nI can’t say it. I can’t say I wanted to use that cliché line.\nSorry, am I late? No, it's okay. I just got here.\nThere’s no way I could say I came early just to use that line. Would Siwoo even understand? Even if he did, he’d probably look at me strangely.\nHonestly, it wasn’t as romantic as I imagined. I shouldn’t have come so early. It would have been better to come with Siwoo, chatting naturally on the way.\nAs I wallowed in slight disappointment, I failed to notice Siwoo’s affectionate gaze.\n\"Who were you talking to? Dorothy? Amelia?\"\n\"Amelia. Amelia, I’ll talk to you later… Oh?\"\nI was still talking with her, but the call had ended, leaving only a blank screen. When did she hang up? She was quick.\n\"Let’s talk about Amelia later. Today’s our first date.\"\n\"What’s this? Are you jealous?\"\nTeasing Siwoo for emphasizing our first date, I tried to hide my embarrassment. But his response was unexpected.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"···What?\"\nWhat did I just hear? Jealous? Siwoo? Of Amelia? Why?\n\"You’re mine. This is our first outing as a couple, so focus on me.\"\n\"Th-That’s…!\"\nMy face turned beet red instantly. What did Siwoo just say? What did I just hear? Happiness, embarrassment, and shock all surged through me.\nSiwoo watched my flustered expression and chuckled.\n\"Why are you so surprised?\"\n\"How can I not be! J-Jealousy... what is that...!\"\n\"Why? You’re pretty jealous yourself. Can’t I be too?\"\nHis voice was a bit higher, a playful smirk on his lips. That’s when I realized.\nSiwoo was teasing me.\n\"Y-You! Don’t joke around!\"\n\"Ouch, that hurts.\"\n\"I know it doesn’t!\"\nI knew it didn’t hurt him, but my face flushed even more as I realized he had tricked me. Where did he learn this?\nDesperate to change the topic, I hurriedly suggested, \"Ahem...! Let’s go in! We’re wasting time!\"\n\"Why? The aquarium can be enjoyed slowly. The show doesn’t start for a while…\"\n\"···! ···!\"\n\"Alright, alright.\"\nAfter a small squabble, the morning had passed, and people began to fill the area. Realizing the amused glances from others, I slumped in defeat.\nWhile Siwoo normally behaved, he could be quite mischievous at times. Pouting, I watched as he approached the aquarium entrance and spoke to the staff.\n\"Two tickets, please.\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Could we get the superhuman discount and the couple’s discount as well?\"\n\"Ah, yes. I’ll apply those.\"\n\"···Don’t you need to check anything?\"\n\"You two don’t need verification. It’s obvious you’re a couple.\"\nOh.\nThey had been watching. Of course, considering our commotion, not noticing would be odd. The staff’s remark about us being an obvious couple brought a smile to my face.\n\"Ahem… Is that so…?\"\n\"Yes. Seems like you haven’t been together long?\"\n\"Yeah, sort of…\"\n\"Don’t tease your girlfriend too much. It’ll be troublesome if she gets mad or upset.\"\n\"I’ll keep that in mind.\"\n\"Oh, sorry for holding you up. Enjoy your visit.\"\nWith a cheerful goodbye, the staff ushered us inside.\n\"Hehe…\"\n\"You’re happy even though we haven’t started the tour yet?\"\n\"It’s just… they said we look like a couple…\"\nA couple, huh?\nHearing that made me so happy. I couldn’t stop smiling as we walked into the aquarium.\n\"···Arte.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"There’s one thing you’re misunderstanding.\"\n\"Misunderstanding…?\"\nWhat was I misunderstanding? I looked at Siwoo, confused, and he grinned mischievously.\n\"I never said I was joking.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"So don’t smile so prettily here. I’ll get jealous if others see.\"\n\"···?!??!\"\n\"Focus on me, okay?\"\n\"Wait, what do you mean by…!\"\n\"It’s my first time at an aquarium. I wonder what’s inside. Shall we find out?\"\nAh.\nThey say in love, the one who falls first loses.\nThat’s a lie.\nBecause if that were true, I wouldn’t be blushing this hard.",

      "content": "“Where do you want to start? Should we explore the first floor?”\n“···Yes.”\nThis is exhausting.\nNot even ten minutes into our date, and I already felt drained from Siwoo's playful teasing. Before we started dating, he was always so cool and kind.\nBut lately, he’d taken to teasing me now and then. No matter how much I tried to stay calm, I’d end up blushing fiercely.\nUgh, it's too much.\nDoes he find my reactions that amusing?\n“You know, I find this a bit surprising.”\n“Surprising how?”\n“I didn’t know you liked fish.”\n“···?”\nSiwoo looked at me as if he found it curious. Liking fish? If I had to choose, I liked seafood, but that was as food.\nThis was my first time at an aquarium, and I had never really had the chance to see live fish before, so I didn’t particularly think I liked them.\nSo, liking fish? I had never mentioned anything like that.\n“Oh, you don’t? I thought you wanted to visit the aquarium.”\n“Ah…”\nThat was it.\nBecause I chose the aquarium as our first date spot, he thought I liked fish.\n“I don’t like them that much.”\n“Really? Then why…?”\n“I thought it would be a new experience. As you know, I lack common knowledge.”\nMore precisely, it was Amelia’s suggestion.\nShe had advised that since I was going out on a date, I might as well learn something new. Amelia had seen me struggle with Dorothy’s common knowledge questions once and probably thought of that.\nAt first, I thought it wasn’t a bad idea, but now I was second-guessing it.\nIt’s our first date. Shouldn’t we go somewhere more meaningful?\nI was worried Siwoo wouldn’t like it and kept glancing at him nervously.\n“I see.”\n“···You’re not mad?”\n“Me? Why?”\n“Because I chose our first date spot for personal reasons…”\n“You’re overthinking things.”\nTap.\nSiwoo lightly flicked my forehead. It didn’t hurt, but the sudden action startled me.\n“I would’ve liked wherever you wanted to go.”\n“···Why?”\n“Because you’re there.”\nHe always does this.\nSometimes, I feel down because I think I’m only receiving from Siwoo and never giving back.\nIn those moments, Siwoo always says something embarrassing like this.\n···It’s unfair.\nSaying things like that makes all my worries seem insignificant.\nIt makes me feel like everything will be fine as it is.\n“Come to think of it, this is your first time at a place like this, right?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Then I’ll choose the route. How about that? ···Here.”\nSiwoo naturally extended his hand to me.\nThe gesture seemed to say that everything would be okay if I just followed him.\nThat he would help me face any challenges ahead.\nHappily, I took his hand.\n“That was fun….”\n“Yeah, it was more impressive than I expected.”\nI’m exhausted.\nRunning around without a care and standing for so long must have taken a toll. After making a circuit of the aquarium, we sat on a bench provided for guests, and the fatigue began to set in.\n···Ugh, my neck hurts.\nAs I massaged my sore neck, I noticed Siwoo watching me with a smile.\n“···What is it? Why are you looking at me like that?”\n“Nothing, really.”\n“···.”\nSuspicious.\nWhen Siwoo smiles like that, it usually means he’s about to tease me. What’s he planning this time?\nI looked at him suspiciously, and sure enough, Siwoo spoke with a grin.\n“I’ve never seen you this excited before. Did you enjoy it that much, jumping around like a kid?”\n“We agreed not to talk about that!”\n“Did we? When?”\nSnicker, snicker.\nThe smile on Siwoo’s face showed no sign of fading.\n“I was really surprised. To think the great Arte Isis would act like a child over some fish…”\n“···.”\n“Alright, alright.”\nSiwoo was right. I had gotten too excited.\nI ran around marveling at everything like the little kids around us.\nI tried to explain myself.\n“But it was amazing…”\nWhen I heard “aquarium,” I thought there would be some interesting and beautiful fish. But this place far exceeded my expectations.\nFirst, the size of the tanks. Whatever they did, the aquarium’s size was beyond imagination. They must have used some supernatural abilities to create such a massive place.\nSecond, the creatures in the tanks. There were the interesting and ornamental fish I expected, but there were so many more fascinating creatures than I had imagined.\n“There were eels that puffed up like balloons, fish that breathed fire, fish that folded in half… and more!”\n“Calm down, calm down.”\nEven thinking back on it was exciting.\nHow could a fish breathe fire?\nAnd underwater, no less.\n“Some fish from dungeons have merged with marine life, resulting in more fascinating species.”\n“Ah…”\n“The ones you saw have monster blood but aren’t classified as monsters.”\nMore unfamiliar knowledge.\nBut I didn’t mind.\nBecause Siwoo was always there to explain things I didn’t know.\n“Hey, Arte.”\n“Yes?”\n“How was today?”\nHe must already know.\nI had been acting all giddy, and Siwoo had teased me about it.\nEven if I hadn’t, his intuition would have picked up on it.\nBut he still asked.\nDid I have fun?\nDid he want to hear it from me?\n“···What about you, Siwoo?”\n“Me?”\n“Yes. I had a great time.”\nI enjoyed myself. But did Siwoo?\nWas he bored looking at things he already knew?\nSiwoo’s answer dispelled my worries.\n“Yeah, I enjoyed it too.”\n“Eating out wouldn’t be a bad idea. You must be tired.”\n“Oh no.”\n“What about ingredients? There weren’t any in the fridge…”\n“I ordered in advance. Don’t worry.”\n“···Alright. I’ll go take a shower.”\n“Yes, look forward to it. I’ll prepare something delicious.”\nI understood Siwoo’s concern.\nHe worried I’d be tired after a long day out. But I really wanted to cook dinner tonight.\nAfter a date, having a delicious homemade meal by your partner’s hand is always special.\nI wanted to cook for Siwoo tonight.\nNot long after Siwoo went into the bathroom, I heard the sound of water hitting the floor, indicating he had started his shower.\n“···Alright.”\nAmelia had planned a perfect date.\nPlaying at the aquarium, eating a delicious lunch, watching the penguin and dolphin shows, and exploring the aquarium again before heading home.\nI couldn’t thank her enough. I’d have to express my gratitude next time I saw her.\n“Oh, I can’t waste time.”\nWhile Siwoo was in the shower, I needed to prepare the meal quickly. I opened the box Amelia sent.\n“What the…?”\nForget thanking her.\nWhat was she thinking?\nDesperately, I searched for other ingredients, but there was nothing else. Just some frozen food and canned goods.\nI couldn’t serve Siwoo, who’d be starving, such a poor meal. Not today.\n“···Sigh.”\nThere was no other choice.\nSteeling myself, I began to cook.\n“Hmm, it smells good. What are you making?”\n“Eel.”\n“Eel? Wow, sounds tasty. What are these?”\n“Ah, those are… oysters and abalone. I grilled them with butter and added some chives and ginger…”\n“What about this?”\n“Schisandra and black raspberry. I thought it would make a nice tea for dessert…”\n“Wait, isn’t this a bit…?”\n“Ah, ahaha… w-well, there’s also octopus and shrimp! Because we went to the aquarium!”\n“Hold on. Chives, eel, abalone, ginger, schisandra, black raspberry… Arte, this is…”\n“It’ll take a while, so please rest!”\nI pushed Siwoo out of the kitchen.\nHe must have realized it.\nI felt a wave of resentment towards Amelia.\nWhy did she send these?\nSiwoo would surely think something was up.\nMeanwhile, in Amelia’s room.\n“Grandpa, did you deliver the items properly?”\n“Of course. Who do you think I am?”\n“Great. Arte will definitely notice. But I wonder if Siwoo will get it.”\nAmelia leisurely sat in a rocking chair, popping grapes into her mouth.\n“I wonder what kind of face Arte is making right now?”\n“···Who knows.”\n“I’d love to see it in person, but I guess I’ll have to give up on that.”\nIf she could, she’d sneak into their house to spy, but that would likely make both Arte and Siwoo turn against her.\nSo Amelia contented herself with imagining their reactions.\n“Hmm, these grapes are delicious. I should have included some of these too. What a pity.”",

      "content": "“···How is it?”\n“It’s delicious, but…”\nI could tell by Siwoo’s expression that he had a lot to say.\nHe knows.\nOf course he does.\n“The ingredients are… quite suggestive.”\n“P-Please don’t say it out loud…”\nChives, oysters, abalone, eel, ginger, omija…\nAt first glance, the dishes on the table seemed like a variety of delicious meals. There was the mild salt-grilled eel, the spicy and savory gochujang soy sauce eel, and the sweet teriyaki-style Japanese eel.\nI had added ginger to cut through the eel’s richness and chives for a crunchy texture. There were butter and garlic-grilled abalone and oysters. Octopus, well-cooked until it turned red, and large shrimp grilled on red salt.\nFor dessert, I had prepared omija and bokbunja, traditional Korean berry drinks.\nThough these dishes appeared luxurious and delicious, they were all known for their aphrodisiac properties.\nIn other words, the message seemed to be: Let’s stock up on energy before the big event.\n“Arte.”\n“L-Let’s just eat first and talk later…”\n“Oh, okay.”\nThe food had to be good. I had poured my heart into these dishes, so they had to taste great.\nBut I couldn’t taste a thing. My mind was too distracted to focus on the flavors. Siwoo said it was delicious, but was he telling the truth?\nHow do I explain this…? Should I just be honest and say Amelia prepared the ingredients?\nNo, that would be pointless. Would Siwoo even believe me if I said that?\nEven though he had the ability to sense intuitions, he wasn’t as sharp as he had been when enhanced by Dorothy.\nWould he be able to tell if I was lying?\n“Actually, these ingredients were prepared by Amelia…”\n“I see…”\n“Please, eat a lot… Haha…”\n“Y-Yeah, it’s really good…”\nWhat kind of response is that?!?!\nHe just said, “I see”? What does that even mean? Does he think I’m lying or telling the truth?\nAnd saying “eat a lot” sounded weird too. It was like I was telling him to boost his stamina or something.\nSiwoo must have thought the same, as his response was awkward.\n“···.”\n“···.”\nAn awkward silence fell over the table again.\nClink, clink.\nThe only sound was the clinking of our utensils.\nIt’s been a while since a meal was this quiet.\nWe usually had lively conversations while eating, especially after a fun day out. I had imagined we’d be talking about today’s date, but the reality was far from what I had expected.\n···Wait, the date?\nWhat had Amelia told me before I left for the date?\nShe had said we needed to take things step by step. So we had the aquarium date.\nShe also said that eating a homemade meal would be better than eating out. Hence, she sent me these expensive ingredients.\n“Could it be…”\n“···Arte?”\nSo, Amelia had planned for us to have a romantic date to heat things up, then convinced me to make a homemade meal, which Siwoo would appreciate more than eating out.\nAnd finally, she sent ingredients known for their aphrodisiac qualities.\nI was sure of it now. Amelia had orchestrated this whole thing.\nWhen I asked her how to make the next step, she must have meant to do it when the atmosphere was right.\nHer mischievous smile flashed before my eyes.\n“Arte, are you okay?”\nAlright then.\nThat’s how you want to play it.\nSure, I had been thinking about taking that step, but I didn’t like the idea of following Amelia’s plan to the letter.\n“Arte? Why aren’t you saying anything? Are you sick…?!”\n“Siwoo.”\n“Why are you suddenly…? Weren’t we going to talk after eating? There’s still a lot left…”\nI grabbed Siwoo’s face and kissed him roughly.\nHis surprised expression filled my vision, and before I knew it, we were both out of breath, a thin string of saliva connecting our lips as we parted.\n“I’ve decided.”\n“D-Decided what…?”\n“I want you to take my virginity.”\n“W-What? Now? All of a sudden?! Wait, we were just eating!”\n“We can reheat the leftovers later.”\nI didn’t like this. Amelia probably expected us to finish dinner and then have a romantic moment.\nBut I couldn’t let things go exactly as she planned.\nEven if she was a friend and meant to help, I couldn’t follow her script completely.\nSiwoo is mine.\nOur first experience should be just between Siwoo and me. No one else should interfere.\nSo this had to happen now.\nAmelia’s plan had pushed me to act, but Siwoo’s lack of reaction to my advances was also to blame.\nYes, this is Siwoo’s fault.\nHow could he not respond to his pretty girlfriend’s advances?\nThe Writer had once assured me he wasn’t impotent, but…\nWho knows if the Writer made a mistake?\nSo this was a test. To confirm if Siwoo’s… function was working.\nI had to make sure, even if it meant forcing the issue.\n“W-Wait. Let’s talk this through…”\n“I’m not letting you go.”\nSensing something was off, Siwoo tried to get up and leave, but I couldn’t allow that.\nHis evasion skills were top-notch, but in such close quarters and with no room to maneuver, things were different.\nUsing an excessive amount of thread, I quickly transformed my clothes into threads that spread in all directions, pinning Siwoo’s hands and feet down.\n“C-Calm down, Arte. I don’t know why you’re doing this all of a sudden, but…”\n“This is your fault, Siwoo.”\n“···Mine?”\n“Yes, it’s your fault.”\nNo matter how much Siwoo struggled, the threads held him firmly in place. I grabbed his pants.\n“I’ve been trying to seduce you every day, but you never responded… You made me anxious.”\nI carefully pulled down his pants and underwear, glancing at his groin. It was slightly swollen.\nSo, Siwoo is still a man.\nThinking about what we were about to do must have excited him.\nI felt a thrill seeing Siwoo’s vulnerable state for the first time. I removed his remaining clothes and was taken aback by the sight of his erection.\n“What?”\nWas a man’s… thing supposed to be this big?\nLooking at Siwoo’s member, I thought back to my body before coming to this world.\nIt was much bigger than mine.\nWas this really going to fit inside me?\nI involuntarily measured its length with my hand and compared it to my lower abdomen. It almost reached my navel.\nNo matter how I looked at it, it was enormous.\n“···.”\nGulp.\nI swallowed nervously, daunted by the size.\nI had forgotten that Siwoo was designed to be the protagonist of a harem story. Naturally, he’d be well-endowed.\nCould this really fit inside me?\nSensing my hesitation, Siwoo tried to persuade me.\n“Arte, don’t push yourself…”\n“I’m not pushing myself!”\n···Ugh.\nI said that, but could this really fit inside?\nIt seemed too big to go in comfortably.\n“Phew, I can do this… I can do this…”\nCan I really?\nI remembered that it could hurt if I didn’t prepare. I shifted the crotch of my leotard aside and tentatively inserted a finger.\n“Ouch…”\nThe discomfort was greater than expected, so I quickly withdrew my finger.\n···I guess I’ve never done this before.\nEven inserting a single finger felt strange.\nHow would it feel with something that big?\nI was scared, but stopping here wasn’t an option.\nThis was something that had to happen eventually.\nRunning away now wouldn’t solve anything.\nI gently grasped Siwoo’s erect member.\nI knew squeezing too hard would hurt him, so I was careful.\nOnce it softened a bit, I could mix it with saliva and insert it with less pain.\n“A-Arte?”\n“I heard it hurts if you just put it in… So I’ll give you some service first.”\nI used the word “service” to see if Siwoo would like it.\nHis member twitched noticeably.\n···So he does like it.\nIgnoring his protests, I focused on the task at hand, determined to take the next step in our relationship.",

      "content": "The sound of flesh against flesh echoed through the kitchen.\nThwack, thwack, thwack, thwack.\nSometimes strong, sometimes gentle.\nBetween the rhythmically moving hands, the tip of the hot penis began to ooze a bit of white fluid.\n\"Does it feel good?\"\n\"Ugh, ugh···.\"\n\"Just leave everything to me···.\"\nHe looked so pleased.\nSeeing Siwoo enjoying himself made me feel proud.\nBut, it wasn’t as wet as I had hoped.\nHe seemed to be enjoying it, but...\nIn those erotic books and novels, this much would usually be enough to make things sticky.\nIt seemed that wasn’t the case here.\nThere was one surefire way to make things stickier with saliva, but···.\nDid I really have to do it?\nHmm···. Alright, I’ve decided.\nAny man would have a fantasy about this.\nThough I felt a bit, no, a lot of hesitation···.\nAs long as Siwoo liked it.\nBecause if Siwoo was mine, then I was also his.\n\"Lick, lick···.\"\n\"Ah, Arte? What are you···.\"\n\"···Strange taste.\"\nEven though it felt a bit odd to try it suddenly, as I moved forward a few steps, Siwoo seemed to notice the difference in sensation.\nThe taste was hard to describe, but I could bear it by thinking of it as a part of Siwoo.\n\"Arte, j-just wait a moment···. Ahh···?!\"\n\"Mm, slurp. Suck···. Slurp, slurp···.\"\nI took Siwoo’s penis into my mouth and exaggerated the sucking sounds on purpose.\nI didn’t know how well I was doing, this being my first time.\nI’d heard somewhere that being too clumsy could be worse than not doing it at all.\nHolding Siwoo’s member in my mouth, I thought of sucking on a popsicle and diligently worked at it.\nRolling my tongue and occasionally giving a deliberate suck.\nCurious about Siwoo’s reaction, I looked up at him.\n\"Nngh, Arte···. Ugh···!\"\nAh, it got bigger. I could tell since it was in my mouth.\nSiwoo must be really turned on by the sight of me servicing him.\nRelieved that he was enjoying it despite my inexperience, I smiled with my eyes.\nI continued to observe his reactions as I serviced him.\nAs my jaw began to ache, Siwoo spoke.\n\"Ah, Arte···. I’m about to come···! Pull back quickly···!\"\nI could see his hips rising slightly and his thighs tensing up.\nHe was about to climax.\nSensing this, I quickly slipped my arm into the space between his raised hips and the floor.\n\"Ah, Arte?! What are you doing?! Ahh?!\"\n\"Mm···!\"\nI hugged his waist tightly, thinking it might snap, and thrust my mouth forward.\nAs his member plunged deep into my throat, I fought the intense gag reflex.\nUnable to hold back, Siwoo ejaculated into my mouth as my throat contracted around him.\nAfter a moment, I realized I couldn’t maintain this state and released him.\n\"Cough, cough···. Huff, huff···!\"\nTears welled up in my eyes.\nWas it the backlash from holding my breath for so long? I gasped for air like a marathon runner at the finish line.\n\"Arte···. Are you okay?!\"\n\"Huff, huff···.\"\nMy mouth felt sticky.\nSiwoo’s semen had mostly spilled out or gone into my stomach, but enough remained to notice it in my mouth.\nAs expected of a harem protagonist, his stamina was no joke.\n\"Bleh···.\"\n\"Ah, Arte···?\"\nI opened my mouth wide, showing Siwoo the semen inside.\nUgh, sticky.\nDespite the slight aversion to swallowing it···.\nI gulped it down.\n\"?!\"\n\"Haa, haa···. Did it feel good···?\"\nEvery breath I took carried the scent of Siwoo’s semen.\nIt felt like my body was filled with him.\n\"···You don’t have to say it. Your body is honest enough.\"\nPerhaps excited by the sight of me swallowing his semen, Siwoo’s member was erect again.\nWith his precum, semen, and my saliva mixed together, it seemed like the perfect lubricant. It was time to start.\nLooking at Siwoo lying spread out on the floor, I took a sip of omija from the table.\nThe taste of the semen wasn’t as bad as I thought, but...\nWell, I wanted to kiss.\nThough I was fine with kissing after this, Siwoo probably wasn’t.\nHe wouldn’t want to kiss someone who had his member in their mouth.\nI thoroughly rinsed my mouth with omija and bokbunja, then climbed on top of Siwoo and kissed him.\nPressing my chest against his to let him feel my body as much as possible.\n\"Mmm, chu···.\"\nI could feel Siwoo’s gaze on my chest.\nDid he want to see more skin?\nSensing his desire, I used my ability to quickly remove the top part of my leotard.\n\"Phew···. I thought you might be impotent, but I’m glad that’s not the case.\"\n\"W-what?! You were thinking that?\"\n\"Of course. You didn’t react to my advances at all.\"\n\"I was just···!\"\nSeeing Siwoo’s member still hard before climaxing reassured me.\nYes, he was ready.\nI moved my leotard aside and showed Siwoo my slightly parted vagina.\n\"Can you see? Now, your thing will go in here.\"\nNo one had ever touched this place before.\nAfter showing him the evidence, I didn’t hesitate and lowered myself onto his member.\n\"Haa, haa···.\"\n\"Arte, are you okay?\"\n\"I-I’m fine···.\"\nI glanced down at our joined lower bodies.\nBlood flowed from my vagina, signifying my virginity was now Siwoo’s, and we were connected.\n\"Huff, huff···. Kiss me, please···.\"\nI begged Siwoo for a kiss to distract from the pain.\nSiwoo closed his eyes without a word, and we kissed for a while, still connected.\n\"···That’s enough for now.\"\nAs the pain of penetration subsided, I stopped kissing and lifted my hips slightly.\nIt still hurt a bit, but it was bearable.\nThe blood from my broken hymen had lubricated the inside, making it easier than the first time.\nInteresting.\nWas it because I was a superhuman, or was a woman’s body naturally this resilient?\nDespite the size of what had penetrated me, the pain wasn’t as bad as I thought.\n\"Today, just···. Feel me.\"\nI placed my hands on Siwoo’s stomach.\nThe feeling of his firm abs fascinated me, so I traced my fingers over them. Siwoo twisted slightly, tickled, which made me giggle.\nBut only for a moment.\nI began to move my hips slowly on top of Siwoo.\n\"Nngh, Arte···. Arte···!\"\n\"Yes, I’m right here. Your beloved is right here.\"\nOnce again, the sound of flesh against flesh echoed through the living room.\nBut this time, the sound was different.\nSticky, intense.\nA sound that would make anyone blush if they heard it.\nThe distinctive sound of two bodies joining filled the entire house.\n\"Haa, haa, ugh···.\"\nThis was my first time having sex in both my past and present life.\nI worried if Siwoo would truly enjoy it.\nBut seeing him struggle to suppress his moans, his gaze fixed on my bouncing chest, reassured me.\nFeeling at ease, I began experimenting with different movements.\nRotating my hips or kissing Siwoo while moving my hips.\nEach time, Siwoo’s reactions fascinated me.\nMy dependable, sometimes mischievous, but always caring lover.\nSeeing him react to every little thing I did made me happy.\nThe fact that we were connected was wonderful.\nGradually, the intensity and speed of my movements increased.\nAs I watched Siwoo’s face while moving my hips, he urgently spoke.\n\"Arte··· P-please pull out···!\"\n\"Hmm? Why?\"\n\"You know why!\"\nYes. I knew.\nSiwoo’s member, growing inside me.\nHe was about to climax.\nHe was asking to pull out, worried I might get pregnant.\nBut I ignored him and kept moving, hugging him tightly.\n\"Arte! It’s really dangerous?!\"\n\"It’s okay. I’ve never had a period.\"\n\"What?!\"\nYes, I’ve never had a period.\nI don’t know why. The author probably designed me this way.\nSo, I didn’t worry about contraception.\nWhat Siwoo feared wouldn’t happen.\nThough I wondered how we’d make a child...\nI’d think about that later.\nFor now, I wanted to enjoy this moment.\n\"And, if it’s your child··· I’d be happy to have it.\"\n\"···!\"\nRight after I said that.\nUnable to hold back any longer, Siwoo’s semen filled my womb.",

      "content": "\"You're so warm···.\"\nI buried my face in Siwoo's chest, smiling with happiness.\nI felt satisfied.\nSiwoo seemed pleased, too, as he had climaxed twice.\nThe sheer joy of making love with him kept me holding onto him for a while.\n\"Did it feel good?\"\n\"···Yeah, it did.\"\n\"That's a relief.\"\nKnowing Siwoo enjoyed it made me happy, too.\nIt felt like my skills were being recognized.\n···Well, there’s no one else I could show them to, so his approval was all that mattered.\nAs I smiled contentedly, Siwoo suddenly asked me,\n\"And you?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Did you enjoy it, Arte?\"\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\"Liar.\"\n\"···Huh?\"\nWhat was he talking about?\nIt wasn't a lie.\nHow else could I express this contentment and happiness?\nPerplexed by his words, I listened as Siwoo continued,\n\"You know, Arte. I've been holding back a lot.\"\n\"···Holding back?\"\n\"Yeah. A lot, even before we started dating.\"\nWas he thinking about the past?\nHe hugged me tighter as he spoke.\n···Wait, hugged?\nI thought I had bound his hands and feet with threads?\nI quickly glanced at where his arms should be, only to see the remnants of forcibly torn threads.\n\"W-what···? When did you get free···?\"\n\"Since we started living together, you have no idea how hard it’s been seeing you in such a defenseless state.\"\n\"W-what are you suddenly talking about···!\"\nI wriggled desperately to get out of his embrace, but it was no use.\nSiwoo held me tightly and continued,\n\"You didn’t wear underwear under those white clothes···. You cuddled up to my clothes with that innocent smile···.\"\n\"St-stop talking about embarrassing things like that! More importantly, let me go···!\"\n\"I wanted to treat you gently, so I held back.\"\nSiwoo had freed his legs and hugged me so tightly that I couldn’t move.\nIt felt good being in his arms, but also made me anxious.\n\"I even held back from finishing inside you, thinking you might struggle with pregnancy···.\"\n\"W-wait···. Are you listening to me···? Hello?\"\n\"I held back so much···!\"\nAh.\nHe wasn't listening.\nWhen I looked at Siwoo’s face, his eyes were slightly glazed.\n\"Hearing you say that makes it impossible to hold back···!\"\n\"W-wait···?!\"\nThunk.\nI heard a sound.\nSuddenly, I felt something different and looked down at our joined bodies.\nHad he gone that deep before···?\nThat couldn’t be right···.\nHe had filled me up just moments ago···.\nWhy did it feel deeper now?\nJust when I thought I had gotten used to it, this new sensation left me bewildered, and Siwoo’s hands moved to my buttocks.\nWhen he slightly bounced his hips and kneaded my butt, I let out an unexpected moan.\n\"Ah, hah···?!\"\nWhat was that?\nThat moan, did it come from me?\nWhat was going on···?!\n\"I've held back all this time, so it’s okay to let it all out, right?\"\n\"W-wait! Something feels off···! Just give me a moment!\"\n\"No, it's not off. I just want you to feel good, too.\"\nWith those words, Siwoo began thrusting into me vigorously.\n\"Ah, ah···. Wait, something's off···!\"\nI couldn't comprehend what was happening.\nWe had been having sex just moments ago, and we still were, but...\nThe sensations were entirely different from before.\nThe intense pleasure made it feel like my vision was flashing.\nMy back arched involuntarily, and my thighs tensed up.\nOverwhelmed by the sudden onslaught of pleasure, my mind went blank.\n\"Hng, ah···?! Ah···!\"\nI climaxed without even understanding what had happened.\nConfusion filled me as I tried to process it.\nWhat just happened?\n\"What was that···.\"\n\"Nothing special, Arte.\"\n\"Ah, ahh···. Wait, I just came···. Give me a moment···!\"\n\"You know my ability is intuition, right?\"\n\"Ah, ah, ha···! Wait···! Just···!\"\nAnother sudden climax hit me.\nSiwoo, having made me come twice in quick succession, lifted me and moved us to a different spot.\n\"Arte, you've never masturbated, have you?\"\n\"Why would you ask that?!\"\n\"There's no need to be embarrassed···. You've already shown me everything.\"\n\"T-that’s different!\"\nBlushing at his sudden intimate question, Siwoo said something even more shocking.\n\"You may not know your weak spots, but I do.\"\n\"W-what do you mean···?!\"\n\"I know exactly where you're most sensitive.\"\n\"Ah, ahh, ha, ah···!\"\nSiwoo thrust his fingers into my vagina while playing with my nipple, making me climax effortlessly.\n\"···See? I know you well.\"\n\"W-what’s this···. It’s unfair!\"\n\"Think of it as using my ability well.\"\nComplaining as Siwoo hugged me, he smirked and threw me onto the bed.\n\"Kyaa, kyaa···?!\"\n\"If we continue on the floor, your back will hurt.\"\nDuring our conversation, we had somehow ended up in Siwoo’s room.\nStruggling to steady myself on trembling legs, Siwoo climbed onto the bed and smiled at me.\n\"···Well, I can't guarantee your back won’t hurt even on the bed.\"\n\"No abilities! I’m against abilities! Don’t use them!\"\n\"Nope.\"\nSiwoo made me lie face down like a dog, a playful smile on his face.\n···I couldn’t smile. I could foresee what was about to happen.\n\"Arte, you're so cute that I can’t help using my ability.\"\n\"Ugh···! That’s unfair!\"\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"\nSiwoo, unable to hold back any longer, began thrusting into me from behind.\nThankfully, it seemed he didn’t intend to torment me like before, as he didn’t make me climax instantly.\nHe must have wanted to enjoy this for longer.\nSquish, squish.\nThe sound of our mixed fluids echoed lewdly as Siwoo’s semen and my arousal overflowed from my vagina.\n\"Ah, ah, ha···. Why are you so good at this···!\"\n\"Do you hate it?\"\nComplaining about Siwoo’s skill, he asked me back.\nHate it? How could I?\n\"As long as it's you, I love everything···.\"\n\"···!\"\nBlushing from my sudden confession, Siwoo began thrusting more vigorously.\n\"Ah, ah, ha···!\"\n\"Damn, damn···! Arte, you’re too sexy···!\"\n\"Ah, ha, ah···!\"\nUnable to respond to Siwoo’s words, I could only moan.\nWe continued to explore each other's bodies for a while.\nI explored Siwoo's body, and he explored mine.\nWe kept affirming our love through physical connection.\nMy brain was filled with pleasure, and I couldn’t think of anything but Siwoo.\nDid he feel the same?\nSeeing him excited by my body, kneading my buttocks and occasionally slapping them, I complained softly,\n\"I don’t like this position···.\"\n\"R-really? Sorry, was it too embarrassing?\"\n\"No, it's not that···.\"\nHonestly, I couldn’t say I wasn’t embarrassed.\nBut if Siwoo liked doggy style, I could endure the embarrassment.\nThere was another reason I didn’t like this position···.\nShould I tell him?\nIt felt a bit embarrassing to say it out loud.\nAnd the aftermath might be a bit scary.\n···But I had to say it.\nKnowing he’d stop immediately if I asked, I spoke in a small, pleading voice, almost like I was being coy,\n\"In this position, I can't see you···.\"\n\"···!\"\nAh, as expected.\nSiwoo got incredibly excited hearing that.\nHe instantly hugged me and lifted me up so we were face-to-face.\n\"Slurp, mmm···.\"\nI wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him again.\nOf course, there was a bit of calculation, thinking he’d like it as a man.\nBut beyond that...\nNot being able to see him bothered me.\nThat’s why I didn’t like doggy style.\nFacing Siwoo, kissing him, seeing his expressions of pleasure.\nIt made me feel so much better.\n\"···.\"\nI couldn’t resist how much I loved him.\nSo, I used my ability to unravel the remaining parts of my leotard once again.\n\"Arte, this is···.\"\n\"Hehe, instead of the red string of fate···. Think of it as the black string of fate.\"\n\"Yeah, that's romantic.\"\nAfter that, we didn’t speak for a while.\nWe were too busy exploring each other’s bodies and kissing passionately.\nThe long night had only just begun.",

      "content": "\"So bright···.\"\nHadn't I closed the curtains?\nI squinted against the bright sunlight piercing through my eyelids.\nWas it already morning?\nI felt strangely exhausted and wanted to sleep more, but once awake, I couldn't drift back to sleep.\nNo matter how much I tossed and turned, I couldn't get comfortable.\nFrustrated, I eventually gave up on trying to sleep.\nCovering my head with the blanket didn't help with the glaring light, but that wasn't the only problem disturbing my sleep.\n\"Water···.\"\nMy throat felt parched, and a raspy voice escaped my lips.\nIt felt like I had sung for hours in a karaoke bar the previous day.\nWas this what a sore throat felt like?\nThe dryness was unbearable, so I reluctantly tried to sit up to get some water, only to be met with the unpleasant sensation of a sticky bedsheet.\n\"Haa···.\"\nNo wonder I felt a bit chilly.\nThe bedsheet was soaked with sweat and other fluids.\nI wanted to put on some clothes, but in this state, it seemed impossible.\nWhen I touched my belly, I confirmed it; my body was covered in sticky fluids.\nI needed to wash up first.\nTurning my head, I saw Siwoo sleeping peacefully.\n···I felt a pang of irritation at how innocent he looked while asleep.\nHe had been so rough last night.\nMemories of the previous night flooded back, and my face turned red.\nI never imagined I'd make such sounds.\nPeople really can't predict everything.\nAs I watched Siwoo sleep, a scene from a novel or movie came to mind.\nThe one where the person who wakes up first kisses their partner.\nAfraid to wake him, I kissed his forehead lightly and got out of bed.\n\"Ughhh···?!\"\nI regretted it immediately.\nIt reminded me of the time I decided to go on a diet and joined a gym.\nBack then, I fought a daily battle with muscle soreness.\n···This pain was several times worse.\n\"My back···.\"\nIt felt like my back was breaking.\nOr had it folded in half?\nIt didn't matter. It hurt terribly.\nI was suddenly wide awake.\nMy legs trembled like those of a newborn fawn, and my arms felt weak, hurting whenever they moved up to my chest.\nI didn't want to move. I just wanted to crawl back into bed and cuddle with Siwoo.\n···But I needed water.\nI couldn't wait for Siwoo to wake up to quench my thirst.\nIn the end, I had no choice but to get up and move, holding my legs for support.\nI inched my way to the living room like a worm, bit by bit.\nI cursed the water jug in the middle of the living room.\nWhy was it there?\nGrumbling, I somehow managed to reach the water jug and grab it.\n\"Gulp, gulp···.\"\nI drank greedily, finally satisfying my parched throat.\nWhen the bottle was nearly empty, I looked around and was shocked.\n\"Wow···. What happened here···.\"\nSiwoo's room was covered in fluids.\nBut it wasn't just his room.\nThe living room was also a mess of dried and still-wet fluids and my scattered threads.\nEverything was sticky with fluids.\nSiwoo's scent filled every corner, giving me a good idea of the cause.\nHad we done it here, too···?\nI couldn't remember.\n\"How much did we do? Cleaning this will be tough···.\"\n\"Indeed.\"\n\"Ahhh?! ···Ugh!\"\n\"Are you okay?!\"\n\"It hurts···.\"\nStartled by the sudden voice behind me, I twisted quickly and regretted it instantly.\nOverwhelmed by severe muscle pain, I collapsed, groaning in pain.\nAs the pain subsided, I saw Siwoo looking at me with concern, repeatedly asking if I was okay.\n\"S-sorry···. I didn't mean to scare you···.\"\n\"···Hold me.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Hold me, and I’ll forgive you.\"\nWhen had he woken up?\nWhen I kissed him?\nOr when I was drinking water? Or when I was moving toward the water jug?\nIt didn't matter.\nI didn't care about the awkwardness of our situation.\n\"Hurry. You’re in better shape than me, right?\"\n\"O-okay···.\"\nSiwoo’s body was also sticky, but it didn’t bother me.\nBeing in my lover’s arms made me feel better despite the stickiness.\nHugging his solid body, I felt content and commanded like a child,\n\"To the bathroom! Let's take a bath first!\"\n\"Got it.\"\n\"I'm having trouble moving because of a certain beast. You need to wash me properly, okay?\"\n\"···.\"\nAh.\nI realized my mistake.\nSeeing Siwoo’s intense gaze, I knew.\nBut I was already in his arms.\nI didn't have the strength to run, nor could I move due to the muscle pain.\n···Not that I minded.\nSo, it was no surprise that we ended up doing it again in the shower.\n\"Ughhh···. I'm dying···.\"\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\"Don’t act like you’re not the culprit.\"\n\"Sorry···.\"\n\"No, you don't need to be sorry···.\"\nIt took a long time to wash off all the sticky fluids from our bodies.\nAnd I endured muscle pain the entire time.\n\"How do we clean all this up···. Haa···.\"\nHonestly, I didn't remember everything from my time with Siwoo.\nThere were moments I fainted from pleasure and times when we explored each other mindlessly.\nWe left traces of our activities all over the house without thinking about the cleanup.\nLooking around, the house was a mess.\nHow would we deal with this? Siwoo and I were both at a loss.\nAt that moment, my phone on the living room table lit up.\n\"Oh, a call.\"\n\"I'll get it.\"\nSiwoo, feeling responsible for my muscle pain, hurried to bring my phone.\nWell, he wasn’t wrong.\nIt was his fault.\nBut I couldn't find the words to say that.\nIt was just a peculiar feeling.\nBetter to let it be.\nSince moving was difficult, it worked out fine.\n\"···Hello?\"\nF-finally! Where have you been?! \"···Huh?\"\nAre you okay?! If you can’t speak, make a long sound for yes and a short one for no! Are you okay?! \"???\"\nStartled by the voice on the phone, Siwoo and I looked at each other.\n···What was this about?\n\"···What's going on?\"\nI thought you were kidnapped or something! \"Huh?\"\n-···Looks like you're okay. I was so worried···.\nAmelia sighed deeply, then started yelling.\nYou should have answered your phone! What were you doing?! \"Phone?\"\nYeah! Do you know how many times I tried to reach you?! ···She had been calling? When?\nChecking my call logs, I was shocked.\nAmelia had called me repeatedly over the past few hours.\n\"What the···.\"\nYou didn’t answer for three days! I almost called the police! \"Three days?\"\nAs Amelia said, my phone showed that three days had passed since our date.\n···Had we been at it for three days?\nThat's insane.\nNo wonder I was in so much pain despite being a superhuman.\n\"So, about your reader.\"\n\"Don't mention it···. I miss them so much···. Ah, reader, I miss you···.\"\n\"Here we go again.\"\nThe transcendents sighed.\nThis one had been crying ever since being forcibly expelled from an interesting place.\nShe seemed to have pulled herself together recently, proposing intriguing ideas that they joined.\nBut every time something about that world came up, she became depressed again.\n\"Seriously, I’m curious.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"That girl, she doesn’t menstruate. Can she have kids?\"\n\"Huh? Oh, that.\"\n\"Human women need to menstruate to have kids, right?\"\n\"I blocked it on purpose.\"\n\"···Really?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nThe foolish transcendent who had been expelled answered straightforwardly.\nIt was intentional.\n\"Since her soul was a human male, dealing with menstruation would be annoying. It would also interfere with watching the protagonist.\"\n\"···So she can’t get pregnant? You always said you’d make it happen.\"\n\"No way.\"\nProudly, the girl boasted.\n\"As soon as semen enters her womb, she has a 100% chance of getting pregnant. She can menstruate afterward!\"\n\"Oh···.\"\n\"Ah, the reader is probably having a great time with the protagonist right now···. I wish I could see it···. I didn’t want spoilers···.\"",

      "content": "\"···So, putting that aside, what are you making right now?\"\n\"Hmm? Didn't I explain it when we gathered everyone?\"\n\"No, I came in the middle because it sounded fun···.\"\n\"Ah···.\"\nShe sighed at the clueless one who joined us without knowing what was going on.\nWell, even I and the others were like that.\nTranscendents are drawn to anything that sounds fun, regardless of what it is.\nHe must have heard rumors of something interesting and just showed up.\n\"We're creating a world.\"\n\"···What? Creating a world?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Is that possible?\"\n\"It's a bit difficult, but··· we've seen results. You saw it too, didn't you?\"\n\"No, I thought there was some kind of gathering over there···. I didn't realize it was something you made.\"\nFeeling his admiration, I couldn't help but puff out my chest a bit.\nAhem, of course.\n\"It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.\"\n\"Really?\"\nThe others, like me, knew their fields better than anyone else.\nWe had never attempted to create our own world together.\nBut once a considerable number of us pooled our efforts towards a single goal, we soon found ourselves greeted by a newly formed planet.\n\"Then we can interfere with the world as we please now?\"\n\"No, not yet.\"\n\"···What? Isn't this a planet? Didn't we make it? Are you saying we can't go in?\"\n\"We made it, but it's still a prototype. This one will be discarded.\"\nIt wasn’t as hard as I thought.\n···But that didn’t mean it was easy.\nIf I told the reader how many planets had been created and destroyed, they’d be shocked.\nI glanced at the corner where the results of our trial and error were piled up.\nPlanets with failed temperature control, planets with incorrectly set atmospheres, planets so overcharged with life force that the planet itself became a living being.\nThe planets that didn't meet our criteria lay dying in that corner.\nSeeing those discarded attempts, the curious one asked,\n\"This one looks fine though?\"\n\"Ah···. It is. We’re almost done.\"\n\"Then why? Isn't it perfect?\"\n\"···There was a disagreement. We stopped at the last step.\"\n\"A disagreement?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nShe sighed deeply.\nThe memory of the argument that arose over the nearly completed world made her head ache.\nIt was frustrating to think we might have to scrap this nearly finished world.\nBut it wasn’t entirely incomprehensible.\nIf I were in their shoes, I’d have done the same.\n\"We confirmed it could support human life, solved most of the problems···.\"\n\"Then what’s the issue?\"\n\"They started arguing about the setting they wanted···.\"\n\"···The setting?\"\nI nodded miserably.\nYes, the setting.\nEach transcendent had their preferred worlds and insisted on their own visions.\nThey didn’t want to compromise on the first world we made together.\nThere were no concessions, no matter what.\nNo one wanted to miss the specialness of the 'first' world.\nMost of the transcendent beings helped build it, claiming their share and fighting to shape it according to their desires.\nIt was a never-ending fight.\n\"Ah, so that’s why they were fighting?\"\n\"Yeah. Some wanted a martial arts world, some wanted fantasy, some wanted urban fantasy···.\"\nTheir tastes were all different, and as transcendents, they rarely yielded.\nTheir powers were similar, and they couldn’t kill each other, so the fight went on indefinitely.\n···Thus, this world was to be discarded.\nWe couldn't see a future where it was completed properly.\n\"We need someone to manage it while mediating the arguments. If we leave it unattended until the fight is resolved, it’ll become a world we can’t interfere with.\"\n\"Ah···.\"\nIt’s like a pet kept by humans.\nIf you catch and leave it untamed, it’ll naturally return to the wild.\nWe created this world but hadn't fine-tuned it.\nBy the time the arguments were resolved and we checked on it, it would be too late.\nIt would have become a world beyond our reach.\nForcing it to completion wasn't possible either.\nIt required the cooperation of many transcendents.\nIf even one disagreed and backed out, the whole plan would collapse.\n\"···Then why are you here?\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"Don’t you have a preferred setting? Honestly, I’m starting to get a bit interested.\"\nI replied to the one gazing at the nearly completed world with greedy eyes.\n\"I don't mind any setting.\"\n\"···Really?\"\n\"Truly, it doesn't matter to me.\"\nThough a bit resentful of the suspicious look, I couldn’t blame him.\nIf I were in his shoes, I'd find it hard to believe too.\n···I couldn’t help it.\n\"As long as it's a happy world, I don’t care.\"\n\"A happy world?\"\n\"Yes, a happy world.\"\n\"···?\"\nHe looked at me, confused.\nWell, 'happy world' is a concept hard for us to grasp.\nTranscendents become desensitized to stimuli after experiencing many worlds.\nThey inevitably gravitate towards bloodshed and chaos to pass the time.\nSo, it was odd for them to agree on making a happy world.\n\"A world without tragedy, where people don't kill each other. That’s the world we decided to create.\"\n\"···Are you sure? That sounds boring.\"\n\"It's fine. We've already discussed it.\"\nMost of those helping to create the world were those who watched other worlds with me.\nThey agreed to make the world I wanted.\nIt was a promise I made with the reader.\n\"You seem to have a plan. Then it’s fine. ···I’m off.\"\n\"Leaving?\"\n\"Yeah. ···Hey, you guys! It’s got to be sci-fi···!\"\nI watched for a moment as another transcendent joined the argument, then turned back to the planet before me.\n···It felt like a shame.\n\"Honestly, it’s well made···.\"\nThe scenery was beautiful.\nThough the setting seemed a bit mixed, thanks to everyone’s input···.\nIt felt like a waste to just throw it away.\nEven if I wouldn’t see it again.\nDespite that, I felt an attachment to the well-made world.\n\"···Ah, I miss you.\"\nIt hadn’t been long since I parted from the reader.\nI already wanted to brag about what I had created.\nThose others were boring to react to.\nThey always looked at me like, 'Of course, you would.'\n···Of course, I knew it was impossible.\nBut I still wanted to show this world to someone other than the reader.\nA world so well-made.\n\"Is anyone watching?\"\nI looked around, seeing no one.\nEveryone was busy advocating for their desired genre, paying me no attention.\n···Good.\n\"This time frame··· should be fine.\"\nAfter compressing the world’s information, I sprinkled it onto a nearby world.\nSmuggling such trivial information was easy.\nSomeone in that world would likely accept this world’s information.\nIt could be published as a game, movie, or novel.\nEven just jotting it down in a personal notebook as a fanciful idea was enough.\nI didn’t want the world to be forgotten and unremembered.\n\"How will they react···.\"\nIt would be boring if they just accepted the information.\nA mischievous thought led me to add a small trick.\n···Done.\nWhoever fell for this trick would be lucky.\nNot that there was a guarantee.\n\"Hey! What do you think?!\"\n\"Yikes?! ···What?\"\n\"He keeps saying fantasy is better than martial arts!\"\n\"Well, it is.\"\n\"He must have muscles for brains! Don’t you get magic?!\"\n\"Martial arts have chi! It’s not all about brute force!\"\n\"Arguing over nothing again···.\"\nI sighed, hearing the sparks fly, and wondered if they heard me mumbling.\nOne of them turned and started mocking me.\n\"···Ha, right. What does someone exiled by their creation know?\"\n\"Yeah, seriously. Embarrassing.\"\n\"Hey! Did you say everything?!\"\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\"Fine···. I wasn't going to fight, but···! I can't take this anymore···!\"\nI joined their fight in anger.\nAnyone who could take such insults without reacting was a fool.\nThus began an endless, meaningless fight.",

How could I not eat it?\n···Though forcing myself to eat might have made things worse.\nBut it really was delicious. Truly.\n\"Maybe you should rest today and go tomorrow···.\"\n\"No, it's okay···.\"\nSeeing Siwoo's worried look, I shook my head.\nEven if I wasn't feeling well, I wanted to attend the opening ceremony with Siwoo.\n\"It's the first day back. I shouldn't miss it.\"\n\"···Hmm.\"\nSiwoo looked like he still thought it was better for me to stay home, but I smiled reassuringly at him.\nThere was no longer any urgent reason for Siwoo to train hard, but still.\nSiwoo wanted to be a hero.\nIf I stayed home, Siwoo would probably insist on taking care of me and skip the academy.\nMy reassuring smile eventually made Siwoo give up on convincing me.\n\"···Alright. But if you feel unwell, you must tell me.\"\n\"Don't worry.\"\nI responded to Siwoo's words while opening the wardrobe, revealing the academy uniform I hadn't seen in a while.\nIt brought back memories.\nI had worn this uniform all the time when I was attending the academy.\nAfter the writer disappeared, I hadn't had a reason to wear it.\nSeeing the academy uniform after so long made me feel like I was returning to the old days.\nThough it had only been about three months.\nI'd been wearing hospital gowns and casual clothes all this time.\n\"Ugh, tight···.\"\nI took off the dolphin shorts and white t-shirt I was wearing to change into the uniform.\nSiwoo was there, but...\nWe've seen everything of each other, so changing in front of him didn't bother either of us.\nSiwoo was more concerned about something else.\n\"Why don't you wear underwear···?\"\n\"But it's comfortable like this.\"\n\"You might get cold. Even though it's spring, it's still chilly.\"\n\"I'm a superhuman. It's fine.\"\nSiwoo worried unnecessarily.\nThere's no way I'd catch a cold as a superhuman.\n\"I wear it when I go out, so it's fine, right?\"\n\"A leotard isn't really underwear···.\"\n\"What does it matter? It's comfortable.\"\nSiwoo shook his head as if he had a headache, which annoyed me.\nIt's not like I went around without clothes.\nI wore a leotard when going out, so it should be fine.\nAnticipating a lecture on proper attire, I preempted it.\n\"···And most of my underwear is probably in the laundry anyway.\"\n\"Ugh.\"\n\"You beast.\"\n···Got him.\nSiwoo's face turned red as he stood there speechless.\nSensing that staying would lead to an undesirable outcome, he quickly left.\n\"Ahem, I'll go get ready. Come down when you're done.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nAfter Siwoo hurriedly left.\nI resumed changing clothes.\nI slipped on the leotard that now felt like a second skin, then put on the blouse.\nNext, I tried to fasten the skirt around my waist···?\nThe skirt···?\n\"Huh···?\"\nClick.\nClick, click.\nHuh.\nSomething's wrong.\n···The waist fastener keeps slipping.\n\"This shouldn't be happening···?\"\nNo matter how many times I tried, the result was the same.\nThe skirt didn't fit.\nThe skirt couldn't have shrunk.\nThis was a uniform I had worn before and hadn't altered with my threads.\nI remembered it fitting perfectly.\nSo why couldn't I wear it?\nCould it be···.\n\"I-I can't get it on···.\"\nClack, clack, clack.\nI worried the skirt might tear, but I kept trying to fasten it without adjusting the waist.\nAll my attempts failed.\nFinally, I had to accept a terrible truth.\n\"I-I gained weight···?!\"\nMemories of the recent break flooded my mind.\nEating, sleeping, going out.\nEating, sleeping, going out.\n···That was all I did.\nI didn't like exercising, so I didn't work out.\nI had no reason to use mana or my powers, so I stayed home and cooked.\nI made a lot of dishes because I wanted to feed Siwoo delicious food···.\n\"Did I eat too much···?\"\nMaybe it was all the tasting.\nWithout realizing it, I had gained weight.\n\"Arte! Are you ready? We need to go soon!\"\n\"C-coming···.\"\nAh.\nMy head was spinning.\nWhy hadn't Siwoo said anything?\nDid he not notice the gradual gain?\nI had to accept the fact that clothes I had worn just a few months ago no longer fit.\n\"Oh, it's been a while. You guys.\"\n\"Ah, Claire-sensei.\"\n\"Are you feeling better now?\"\n\"Yes, thank you for your concern.\"\nI barely heard the conversation between Siwoo and Claire-sensei.\nMy mind was preoccupied with my waist.\n···Why hadn't I noticed?\nOh, right.\nThe leotard was stretchy.\nThe clothes I usually wore at home were loose.\nI hadn't noticed the gradual gain.\n\"···Arte doesn't look well.\"\n\"Ah, yes. She's been feeling unwell lately···.\"\n\"I hope it's not a lingering effect from the battle.\"\n\"I hope not···.\"\nI gained weight.\nSo much that I couldn't fit into my old clothes.\nThe shock of that realization must have shown on my face.\nSiwoo and Claire-sensei looked at me with concern.\n\"I'm fine···. Haha···.\"\n\"···Hmm.\"\n\"L-let's head to class.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nI barely remembered what happened next.\nI was holding Siwoo's hand, thinking about how to lose weight.\n\"Oh, it's been a while. Are you feeling better now?\"\n\"Ah, yes.\"\n\"Why does Arte look like that?\"\n\"She's been unwell lately···.\"\n\"···Really? It seems like something else is wrong.\"\nOh, it's Amelia.\nShe might know how to diet.\nYes, she must.\n\"···Uh.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I gained weight···.\"\nMy hands trembled.\nIt was embarrassing to admit it out loud.\nBut maybe because it was so embarrassing, I felt a strong need to confide in someone.\nI told Amelia.\n\"How can I lose weight and keep it off···?!\"\n\"What? You gained weight?\"\n\"Y-yes···! My waist doesn't fit···! What do I do?!\"\n\"Oh, so that's why you were late···.\"\n\"Shut up.\"\nBut something felt off.\nI asked about weight management, and Amelia's eyes turned sharp as she looked me over.\n\"Doesn't look like you gained weight.\"\n\"B-but I did···! Really! My waist doesn't fit!\"\n\"What? It's hard for a superhuman to gain weight like that··· wait.\"\nAmelia, after looking me over, suddenly spoke to Siwoo.\nHer voice was unusually cold.\n\"Hey.\"\n\"Y-yes?\"\n\"Arte hasn't been feeling well lately, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Has she mentioned nausea, trouble eating, or feeling tired?\"\n\"How did you know···?\"\n\"Fuck.\"\nWith that, Amelia urgently left the classroom.\n\"A-Amelia. Where are you going···.\"\n\"Stay there! Don't move a muscle!\"\n···Using her powers, why suddenly?\nSeeing Amelia leave, Dorothy walked into the classroom.\n\"Oh, it's been a while.\"\n\"Hello.\"\n\"···Why did Amelia leave? Using her powers too. Class is about to start.\"\n\"Who knows. Maybe something happened···.\"\n\"I'm back!\"\n\"Whoa, you were fast···.\"\nHad she used her powers to the limit?\nAmelia, panting, handed me something.\n\"···What's this?\"\n\"Go to the bathroom and pee on it.\"\n\"Why suddenly···.\"\n\"Do it!\"\n\"O-okay···.\"\nWhat is this?\nA long, white object.\n···Pee on it?\nLooking at the object in my hand, it seemed like a test kit.\nAmelia's urgent reaction made me think.\nCould I have some unknown illness?\nIs that why she was so urgent?\nScared, I rushed to the bathroom.\nFollowing Amelia's instructions, I looked at the kit in my hand.\n\"···There's an extra line.\"\nI didn't know what two lines meant, but it seemed significant.\nDid it mean I was sick or not?\nFeeling anxious, I hurried back to the classroom.\n\"Arte? What's wrong? What's that in your hand···.\"\n\"Amelia! I did it! There are two lines, what does that mean···.\"\n\"You crazy bastard!\"\nAs soon as Amelia heard me, she hit Siwoo on the head.\nEveryone, including Claire-sensei, was shocked.\nAmelia then dropped a bombshell.\n\"How could you get her pregnant, you idiot! Didn't you use protection?!\"\n\"W-what···?\"\nPregnant?\nI haven't even had a period.\nLooking at the stick in my hand, it did resemble a pregnancy test.\n···Really?",

      "content": "\"···Pregnant?\"\nI heard someone mutter.\nTurning to the source of the voice, I saw everyone averting their gazes as if on cue.\nThey were all pretending not to have heard, but...\nThere was no way the superhumans hadn't heard Amelia's outburst.\nThey had all heard and were just pretending not to know.\nEveryone was aware of it.\nSiwoo, too, knew this and couldn't hide his shock.\n\"Wh-what···!\"\n\"It's two lines, two lines! You're pregnant!\"\n\"No, that's not···!\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Why did you say it here?!\"\nSiwoo frantically looked around.\nEveryone was pretending not to have heard, but...\nThey knew it was only a matter of time before the news spread.\n\"If this becomes a rumor···.\"\n\"Enough.\"\nJust as Siwoo was about to argue with Amelia, Claire-sensei stepped in.\n\"S-sensei···.\"\n\"It seems there's been an unfortunate incident. I'll take Arte to the hospital. Until then, please continue with self-study.\"\n\"Y-yes!\"\n\"···And, I expect you to keep this matter private. The truth hasn't been confirmed yet.\"\n\"Understood!\"\nClaire-sensei glanced over the students, then sighed deeply.\nShe must have known that despite her warning, such gossip was bound to spread.\nThe moment she left, the students would undoubtedly chatter about the incident instead of studying.\nAnd soon, the entire academy would know.\nArte Isis was pregnant with Yu Siwoo's child.\n\"And Yu Siwoo.\"\n\"Yes···.\"\n\"You too···. No, just wait here for now.\"\nClaire-sensei's voice was as stern as usual.\nIf you only heard her voice, it might seem like she was reserving judgment until the hospital visit, but her face said otherwise.\nClaire-sensei looked at Siwoo with an expression that screamed he had made a massive mistake.\n\"Sorry···. I didn't mean to cause this···.\"\n\"Y-you···!\"\nAmelia's apology sounded half-hearted, as if she hadn't anticipated this outcome.\nBut just like Claire-sensei, Amelia's face and voice told a different story.\nHer lips kept twitching as if she could barely contain her laughter.\n\"You did that on purpose, didn't you?!\"\n\"Oh, what are you talking about···. I was just so surprised.\"\nNo one believed Amelia's words.\nShe had shouted deliberately.\nEveryone was convinced of that.\n\"Who told you to rub it in our faces?\"\n\"Y-you···!\"\n\"I got tired of hearing about your lovey-dovey stories every day.\"\n\"That doesn't justify this···!\"\n\"Well, yes. I did try hard to get you two together···.\"\nAmelia grinned like a villain in a comic.\n\"But you two went too far. You should've considered how I felt listening to your sweet nothings every day.\"\n\"Ugh···.\"\n\"Don't worry. At least I won't make it seem like you're a rapist. I'll just say you two were too in love.\"\n\"Arte, come with me.\"\n\"Y-yes···.\"\nI wanted to tell her to stop tormenting Siwoo.\nBut I knew that speaking up now might make things worse, so I followed Claire-sensei out of the classroom.\n···Honestly, if the writer were still around, Amelia would probably have been the final boss.\nThat thought crossed my mind as I left the room.\n\"You're pregnant.\"\n\"R-really···.\"\n\"It's not definite yet, but it's likely a girl.\"\nClaire-sensei clenched her eyes shut.\nShe had expected this, but clung to a sliver of hope.\nBut now even that faint hope was dashed.\n\"A girl···.\"\n\"It's not certain. Come back in a month for a more accurate determination.\"\nI instinctively rubbed my belly.\nInside me was Siwoo's and my child.\nIt felt so strange.\nI had seduced Siwoo, thinking I couldn't get pregnant because I never had a period.\nI never imagined I would end up pregnant.\nI had fantasized about having Siwoo's child someday, but...\nI was more worried about whether it was even possible given that I never had a period.\n···But to be pregnant so soon.\nThe result was so different from my expectations that I was left speechless.\n\"Arte, it's awkward to say this, but···.\"\n\"I won't get rid of it.\"\nI cut off Claire-sensei's cautious suggestion.\nI knew what she was going to say.\nShe would suggest considering the future and possibly terminating the pregnancy.\n\"···But Arte. You must think carefully. If you keep the baby, we may have to recommend you drop out.\"\n\"···.\"\n\"You know how rigorous the curriculum is. It's hard to manage with a pregnant body.\"\nI understood what Claire-sensei was getting at.\nFrom the curriculum alone, it was clear that a pregnant student would struggle.\nEven in the first year, we had practical experiences like dungeon explorations and sparring.\n···Most of these settings were created by the writer.\nWhich meant the second year would be even tougher.\nWith the writer gone, the settings would naturally follow logical progression.\nThis year's curriculum would be harder than last year's.\n\"And, you know how sensitive the academy is to issues right now.\"\n\"···I know.\"\n\"Even so, will you keep it?\"\nClaire-sensei shut her eyes tightly.\nAs the cliché strict homeroom teacher, Claire-sensei.\nBut behind her strict exterior was a deep concern for her students.\nShe didn't like forcing such a choice on a student already in turmoil.\nSeeing her like that, I couldn't help but smile.\n\"Ahaha···.\"\n\"···?\"\nClaire-sensei looked puzzled by my sudden laughter, making me laugh again.\nIt made me realize once more that this world was real.\nPeople always show different sides of themselves.\nAmelia, our helpful friend, sometimes pranked us.\nClaire-sensei, always stern, bowed her head apologetically when broaching difficult topics.\nThese small details, unnoticed when the writer was around, made me feel the reality of this world.\n\"How do I process my withdrawal?\"\n\"···So, you've made up your mind.\"\n\"Yes. I can't erase the proof of our love.\"\n\"Haa···. Then at least you could've used contraception···.\"\n\"Ahaha···.\"\nThe strict tone was gone, and Claire-sensei grumbled at me.\nBut I could only laugh.\nI had never used contraception.\nI thought I couldn't get pregnant without a period.\n\"I never imagined I’d lose a student like this.\"\n\"I'm sorry···.\"\n\"No need to apologize. Siwoo must've been persuasive.\"\nBut he wasn't.\nI had seduced him, thinking I couldn't get pregnant.\nBut I couldn't say that, so I kept quiet.\n\"I'll keep an eye on Yu Siwoo for the next two years···.\"\nAh.\nI should've said something.\nIt looked like Siwoo was now on Claire-sensei's bad side.\n···Oh well, we'll manage somehow.\nWhispers.\nMurmurs.\n\"Haa···. As expected···.\"\nClaire-sensei sighed.\nAs we moved through the academy to process my withdrawal, students kept whispering and talking about us.\nApparently, the news about Siwoo and me had already spread throughout the academy.\n\"Those brats, I told them not to talk···. Just wait···.\"\n···I felt sorry for her.\nSuch a scandal on the first day back.\nAnd another rumor was bound to start soon.\n\"Arte?! Where are you going?! Running isn't good for you!\"\nI rushed towards our classroom.\nThe students' gossip didn't bother me.\nI wouldn't see them much anymore anyway.\nBut Siwoo wouldn't be in the same situation.\nPushing through the crowd, I entered the classroom and shouted,\n\"Siwoo!\"\n\"Arte?! What's the result···.\"\n\"I'm pregnant!\"\n\"I see···.\"\nBuzz, buzz.\nThe students' chatter filled the hallway.\nAt this rate, Siwoo would be seen as a villain.\nSo, I decided to boldly announce,\n\"Everyone, listen up.\"\n\"···?\"\n\"Siwoo didn't attack me! I attacked Siwoo!\"\n···Wait, that sounded worse?\nMaybe I shouldn't have said anything.\n\"Arte···.\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\"Haa···. Fine. Yu Siwoo, come along too.\"\n\"Y-yes···.\"\nAnd so, the first day back at the academy became my last day there.",

      "content": "Since then, nothing particularly special happened.\nOther than Claire-sensei constantly sighing and occasionally glaring at Siwoo after we arrived at the teachers' office.\n\"I'm sorry···.\"\n\"Good that you know.\"\nShe didn't look satisfied at all.\nIt seemed like Siwoo would have a harder time in class compared to others.\nBut I wasn't really worried.\nThere's no way Siwoo would struggle with just the second-year curriculum.\nSiwoo, who had survived even the most dangerous frontlines that only the top third-year students could reach.\nEven in that hellish place.\nNo matter how hard the teacher trains him, it won't be a problem.\nIt might be awkward, but it wouldn't be difficult.\n\"Things will get noisy again···.\"\nClaire-sensei rubbed her temples, looking pained, and sighed once more.\n\"You should've used protection at least. You two are quite famous, and this kind of scandal could cause a lot of trouble.\"\n\"···Huh? Famous?\"\n\"Don't tell me you didn't know.\"\nSiwoo and I looked at each other, blinking in confusion.\nFamous? Us?\nClaire-sensei sighed deeply again, seeing our reaction.\nIt was as if she couldn't believe we were unaware.\n\"Think about what you've done over the past year.\"\n\"What we've done over the past year···?\"\n\"Eliminating villains infiltrating the academy, dealing with monstrous beasts attacking the academy, defeating Übermensch officers, and resolving the frontline crisis···. You've handled quite a few major events.\"\n\"H-how do you know all that···?\"\nHow did the teacher know all that?\nOf course, as a teacher, she'd know about the internal academy incidents, but...\nShe knew about the frontline incidents and taking down Übermensch officers?\nSiwoo and I stared blankly at her.\n\"Don't you ever look at the internet?\"\n\"We don't really···.\"\nBefore heading to the frontlines, we were always busy because of the writer.\nThere were always incidents to handle.\nAfter those incidents ended, we didn't really use electronic devices.\nThere's no need to explain why.\nWe're in the teachers' office because of that.\n\"The information is already out. It's easier for information to spread than you think.\"\nArte Isis and Yu Siwoo.\nOn the screen Claire-sensei showed us, our names were displayed.\n\"I often tell people not to ego-search, but I didn't expect there'd be people who really don't.\"\nOn the device showing our names, countless posts were up.\nWho we were, what we'd done recently, our abilities, etc.\nWhile not perfect, the sightings and speculations were pretty credible.\n\"In today's world, information is hard to control. With such big incidents, it's no surprise people are interested.\"\nSiwoo and I hastily searched my name to check people's reactions.\nThankfully?\nIt seemed my identity as Arachne hadn't been discovered.\nAs I sighed in relief, the teacher showed us a site that had gathered information about Siwoo and me.\nThere were already posts about me being pregnant with Siwoo's child.\n···How did that spread so fast?\n\"The academy attack, the beast anomalies. These were unprecedented events. Experts are obsessed.\"\n\"Oh, so···.\"\n\"Despite limited information, the consensus is that you two resolved the incidents. The academy denies it, of course.\"\nI understood what the teacher was getting at.\nNo matter how much the academy denied it, no one believed them.\n···And it was true anyway.\nIn any case, our notoriety had risen significantly due to these incidents.\n\"Anyway, you're more famous than you think.\"\n\"···.\"\n\"And people who saw you two often suspected your relationship···.\"\n\"Now it's confirmed, right?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\n···What's the problem?\nIf everyone knows Siwoo is mine and I'm his, isn't that better?\nIt would stop unnecessary people from flirting with Siwoo.\nI didn't see any downside.\nMaybe that thought showed on my face.\nClaire-sensei sighed and spoke to me.\n\"Civilians being annoying is one thing···. But think about the villains.\"\n\"···Villains?\"\n\"Yes. Though the number has decreased thanks to Arachne, villains still exist.\"\n\"So what···?\"\n\"Villains come in two types: those who can kill with a clear mind and those who can't. The latter worries me.\"\nClaire-sensei looked at me with concern.\nThough I wouldn't be her student anymore, she didn't seem to care about that.\n\"Sometimes idiots wanting fame target people like you.\"\nSeeing her worried gaze at my belly, I understood what she was getting at.\nWas she worried someone might target me because pregnancy made me vulnerable?\n\"Don't worry, sensei. I'll be fine.\"\n\"That's not guaranteed···.\"\n\"No.\"\nI looked at Siwoo and smiled brightly.\nI appreciated the teacher's concern, but···.\nI had Siwoo.\n\"Siwoo will always protect me.\"\n\"···Haa, fine. Just bring me good news.\"\n\"Don't worry.\"\nI gave a bright smile to Claire-sensei.\nShe's a good person.\n···I wouldn't see her often, but if I ever get married, I'd definitely send her an invitation.\nAfter submitting my resignation to the academy, I returned home.\nNot to Siwoo's house, but to the Arachne base I originally used.\nBecause Claire-sensei's words made sense.\nI believed Siwoo would always protect me, but···.\nIt wouldn't hurt to be prepared.\nWhile Siwoo continued his academy life, I decided to stay with my Arachne comrades.\n\"Wow, this is so weird···.\"\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Look at this, Lyra. It's so weird. Oh···. There's a baby in here···.\"\nRub, rub.\nI felt Spira's hands rubbing my belly repeatedly.\nShe must have found it fascinating.\nShe didn't even notice Lyra's expression growing harsher.\n\"···If you don't stop, I'll cut off that tail.\"\n\"Eek! I'm not a lizard! It won't grow back! I'll stop!\"\n\"Haa···.\"\nLyra seemed to have a tough job.\nHandling a comrade so frivolous that you'd never guess she was once an Übermensch officer seemed familiar.\nShe must've done this many times.\n\"You have it tough.\"\n\"Thanks for noticing. ···Are you okay?\"\n\"I appreciate the concern, but I'm not that weak.\"\nHmm.\nLyra probably thought she was hiding it well, but···.\nShe seemed extremely curious.\nHer gaze kept drifting to where Spira was touching my belly.\n\"Do you want to feel it?\"\n\"···Is that okay?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nI wouldn't have let just anyone touch my belly.\nBut I trusted these comrades.\nThey'd never harm me.\nWhen I tapped my belly to signal it was okay, Lyra hesitantly approached.\nTrying to hide her curiosity must've been tough.\n···Honestly, I still found it strange myself.\nI never imagined I'd have a baby inside me.\n\"It's a bit swollen···.\"\n\"There's a baby inside.\"\n\"Boy or girl?\"\n\"Probably a girl. I'll know for sure next month.\"\n\"Huh···.\"\nLyra, intrigued, rubbed my slightly swollen belly, then pressed her ear against it.\n\"···Sorry, but you probably won't hear anything yet.\"\n\"Oh, really···? S-sorry.\"\nHer fumbling apology made me laugh.\nWho would've thought she'd soften so much from her once sharp demeanor.\n\"What's so funny···!\"\n\"Nothing, just.\"\nIt felt nostalgic.\nDid the writer want to kill Lyra?\nBut I didn't.\nEven though I didn't know how the writer would react.\nWas it a whim, or my last shred of conscience?\nLooking back···.\nMaybe it was one of the best decisions I made.\n\"How's your health?\"\n\"Ah, Hayul. Finished with classes?\"\n\"Just did.\"\nChecking the clock, I saw it was indeed the end of academy classes.\nIt would take at least ten minutes to get here from the academy.\n\"You're really fast···.\"\n\"My abilities might seem useless outside combat, but they're helpful.\"\n\"Haha···.\"\nI see.\nHe turned into mist and arrived.\n···No wonder I'd never seen him drive despite his high status.\nHe's efficient with his abilities.\n\"Spira. Stop that and get ready.\"\n\"···Ah, is it work time already?\"\n\"Yes. Hayul is here. It's you and Hayul today.\"\n\"Eek···.\"\nSpira let out a blatant groan, and Hayul glared at her.\n···That was definitely Spira's fault.\nHayul probably didn't mean anything by it.\n\"Then, take care of Arte.\"\n\"Don't worry. I'm strong now.\"\n\"···Very well. Then, Arte, congratulations on your pregnancy.\"\n\"Ah, thank you.\"\nWith that, Spira and Hayul left the house.\nToday, too, they'd be hunting villains.\nAnother typical day was passing by.",

I think I’d make a good aunt.\"\nSo shameless.\nI had a lot to say but didn’t speak out.\nWhere did the person who used to be afraid of me go?\nEven if it was a good change, it still felt awkward, remembering the past.\nWhether he knew this or not, Siwoo suddenly got excited, pressing his ear to my belly.\n\"Hey, hey! The baby kicked! The baby kicked!\"\n\"What? Out of nowhere, what are you talking about?\"\n\"Irene kicked! Didn’t you feel it?!\"\n...A kick?\nI didn’t feel anything.\nSiwoo’s serious face staring at my belly was comical, but I didn’t mention it.\nI focused all my attention on my belly.\nBut no matter how long I waited, I didn’t feel any movement.\n\"Siwoo, it’s probably just a mistake...\"\n\"Wait a bit longer. She’s probably being still because she doesn’t want to hurt her mom.\"\n\"No baby would be that considerate before they’re even born...\"\nThen suddenly, a soft thump echoed from inside my belly.\n\"Did you hear it this time?!\"\n\"...Unbelievable.\"\n\"It’s amazing. Does she know we’re talking about her?\"\nBoth of us knew that wasn’t possible.\nBut we didn’t care about such details, enjoying our talk about the baby.\nI forgot all about my boredom for a while.\nAfter some time, Siwoo asked me a question, as if he had just remembered it.\n\"Hey, boss.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"How do you want your daughter to grow up?\"\n\"Out of the blue?\"\n\"I’m just curious.\"\nHow do I want her to grow up?\nI never thought about it.\nI only thought about the fact that I had a child with Siwoo in my belly.\n\"How do I want her to grow up...\"\n\"Just say it lightly. Kids never grow up exactly the way we want them to.\"\nI knew that better than anyone.\nSeeing Amelia and her father’s relationship, who wouldn’t think that?\nLionel probably didn’t want Amelia to grow up exploiting him...\nMaybe because of our bond from the frontline incident and being one of his daughter’s few friends.\nHe always contacted me just when I was about to forget about him.\nMostly to vent, though.\nAmelia should respect her parents more.\nHer attitude, more relaxed than with her closest friends, was troubling.\nListening to her father read light novels was a bit...\n\"Artemis?\"\n\"Oh, sorry.\"\nWhat were we talking about again?\nOh, how I wanted my child to grow up.\n\"A free-spirited child.\"\n\"...Free?\"\n\"Yes. A child who’s not bound by anyone.\"\nSometimes I think about it.\nIf I didn’t have Siwoo, would I have lived my whole life as the creator’s puppet?\nWhenever I think about that, I hope our child won’t be like that.\n\"A child who can think and act on their own, not someone else’s puppet.\"\n\"It sounds easy but is quite hard to achieve, boss.\"\n\"Is it?\"\nI smiled awkwardly and stroked my belly.\n...It might be tough, but I hope she grows up like that.\nSiwoo and I talked until he returned from the academy.\n\"Daughter, when are you going to give me a grandchild?\"\n\"Ugh, Dad, I’m still an academy student.\"\n\"Being an academy student doesn’t mean you can’t marry. You’re an adult now; you can date and get married.\"\nI wanted to punch that smirking face but held back.\nI couldn’t hit him anyway with my current skills.\nHe’d dodge and mock me for such a weak attempt.\n\"Look, your friend already has a child. You should get a boyfriend and...\"\n\"Arrgh!\"\n\"Hahaha.\"\nI tried to ignore him, but it was unbearable.\nAttacking me mentally like this...\n\"That’s just them being weird! How could they get pregnant without even using protection...\"\n\"Daughter, I’m sad. It feels like I’ll die without seeing my grandchild...\"\n\"Why are you doing this to me!\"\n\"...Why?\"\nDad’s face, which had been laughing while teasing me, turned serious.\nLike he had something important to say.\n\"I haven’t forgotten about the embarrassing photo you secretly posted on my SNS a few days ago...\"\n\"For just that...\"\n\"Just that? Just that?\"\n\"....\"\n\"You know it’s not just that.\"\n\"Uh, well...\"\nI had nothing to say.\nI’ve been teasing Dad a lot lately.\nBut as the eldest daughter of the Lindbergh family, I decided to be shameless.\n\"That’s because you set up weird traps in my room last time!\"\n\"That’s because you read my book in front of me.\"\n\"That’s because you sprinkled water on my bed while I was sleeping and teased me for wetting it at your age!\"\n\"Remember that your actions triggered mine, daughter.\"\nDad and I realized that arguing about who started it would be endless.\nWe’d been like this since I was very young.\nNeither of us knew who started it.\nWe just retaliated when teased.\nThat was the only reason for our relationship.\nWe had no intention of stopping now.\nStopping first would mean losing.\nNo one ever said it, but we’d made that an unspoken rule.\n\"If that’s how you want to play... Just wait. You might cry like a baby next time!\"\n\"Haha, my dear. I might wet myself from fear...\"\nDad sniffled with a face that didn’t look scared at all.\nDamn, he’s teasing me again.\n\"Just wait... I swear by Grandpa’s name, I’ll make you cry...\"\n\"Then I swear by my father’s name that I won’t cry.\"\n\"Arrgh!\"\nI’ll never forgive him.\nI started thinking hard about how to tease Dad back.",

      "content": "\"Why... why did you do it?\"\nIgnoring the question, I glanced around.\nFamiliar faces surrounded me, forming a circle as if to trap me.\nNo, not as if — they really were trapping me.\nThough I wasn’t particularly interested, I recognized the faces of my classmates whom I had seen daily for three years.\nAmelia and Dorothy. And the recently added heroines whose names I couldn’t quite recall.\nSchool teachers and heroes from the frontlines, whom I had seen before.\nEven the elite forces of the association were here. Come to sever ties, I suppose?\nIt seemed they had gathered a lot of people for the so-called final showdown.\n...So, it failed.\nEveryone looked tired, with small wounds visible, but the number of people hadn’t decreased significantly.\nEven if Siwoo and the heroines were an exception, failing to deal with the extras was unacceptable.\nAnnoyed, I clicked my tongue softly.\n\"Since you’ve come this far, I’ll ask just one thing. What happened to the other Arachne members? They must have gone that way.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, I figured as much.\"\nThough no answer came, the silence was enough of a reply.\nThey must be lying somewhere as cold corpses.\n\"I should have killed them.\"\nAnnoyance flared, and I frowned.\nWhen I was still inexperienced.\nBack then, unable to abandon a sense of reality, I pitied those who moved and acted like people and spared them.\nI accepted them as comrades because they had nowhere else to go, thinking they might be useful someday.\n...But that was a mistake.\nWhat could I expect from those who couldn’t even handle extras?\n\"They were your comrades! How can you say that?\"\n\"Comrades? Them?\"\nHa.\nI couldn’t help but laugh at Amelia’s glare.\nComrades, she said? Ridiculous.\n\"Those who failed their mission are no comrades of mine.\"\n\"...Lies.\"\n\"Lies?\"\n\"You never thought of them as comrades from the start.\"\n\"That’s harsh... We’ve been through life and death together for years...\"\nI pretended to shed a tear, but no one gave me a sympathetic look.\nEveryone was just waiting for Siwoo to speak.\n...These humorless people.\n\"If you really considered them comrades, you wouldn’t have sent just three of them to face all of us.\"\n\"...Haha. Well, that’s true.\"\nI didn’t feel like denying it.\nShe wasn’t wrong, after all.\nWas there any need to consider mere puppets as comrades?\nThough I had a bit of attachment to those puppets...\nIn the end, they were just dolls, not humans.\nA bit regrettable, but parting with them didn’t mean much.\n\"Artemis, why did you change so much?\"\n\"Hmm... Looks like everyone’s here. Shall we begin?\"\n\"Answer me! Why did you change so much?!\"\nDesperation in his voice, Siwoo shouted at me once more.\n...I was going to ignore it.\nBut he seemed so desperate for an answer that I had to respond.\n\"Change, you say?\"\nFine.\nA fight right after meeting the final boss would be boring.\nA conversation with the hero is sometimes necessary.\nEspecially when the final boss was once an ally.\nA tragic and poignant dialogue between the former ally turned enemy always captivates the audience.\n\"I have never changed.\"\n\"That’s impossible. What about the time we spent together at the academy?\"\n\"...Oh, that.\"\n\"We solved cases together at the academy... We visited Amelia’s house... What about all those memories?\"\n\"They were fun.\"\nYes, they were fun.\nLife with Siwoo and the heroines was really fun.\nHow could it not be?\nA plethora of events and incidents prepared to entertain the audience.\nThe thrilling romantic lines between Siwoo and the heroines.\nIt was a bit challenging to coordinate everything.\nBut I truly enjoyed the world moving according to what I and the creator envisioned.\n\"Artemis, please. It’s not too late. Return to how you were...\"\n\"Seeing your joy without knowing I orchestrated it all was so amusing.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"...You didn’t notice? Hahaha! This is hilarious!\"\nI was genuinely surprised.\nI thought at least they had some suspicions, but they didn’t doubt it at all.\nIf they hadn’t doubted, of course, they wouldn’t have said it’s not too late.\n\"Didn’t you wonder why so many incidents occurred at the academy over the past three years?\"\nI laughed openly at the stunned faces.\nWhat was the gap between us?\nI thought they had some clue.\nI never imagined they were completely unaware until now.\n\"You... it can’t be...\"\n\"Yes, it’s true! Every incident you faced... I was behind it all!\"\n\"That can’t be...\"\n\"Haha, you actually believed Amelia’s father was killed by overseas mafia? It was a lie I casually told, but you believed it.\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"Oops, was I not supposed to say that?\"\nI covered my mouth as if I had made a mistake, but all I received were angry glares.\nWell, that’s understandable.\nNot only had I disrespected the dead, but I had practically admitted to killing that person.\n\"Ah, well, what’s done is done... Yes, I killed him.\"\n\"Don’t lie. Then... what about the tears you shed when he died...\"\n\"The tears? Ah, those tears...\"\nAmelia’s cry made me stop laughing and compose myself.\n...Hmm, is this enough?\n\"Amelia... Don’t be too sad. Your father would want you to be proud of his work.\"\n\"...You!\"\n\"Haha. My acting was quite good, wasn’t it?\"\nThe puppets’ faces twisted.\nThey must feel like I had dishonored the dead.\nWell, it’s true I dishonored them!\n...No, since they weren’t human, maybe dishonoring the dead isn’t the right term.\n\"Artemis.\"\n\"Oh... Looks like you’re finally ready to do it.\"\nSiwoo’s expression hardened.\nHe still seemed hesitant, but his determination to stop me was stronger.\nGood. That’s how the hero should be.\n...Let’s provoke him a bit more.\n\"It was fun, playing friends with you.\"\nI looked around again.\nWhat I saw was unmistakable hostility, different from before.\nJust a moment ago, they might have had a reason to defeat a great enemy but didn’t feel it.\nNow, seeing my actions firsthand, they understood the danger.\nThat this woman was a real threat.\n\"Good, good. It looks like everyone is ready.\"\nI’m glad.\nWe need enthusiasm for an exciting finale.\nEven though they were mere extras, they were useful in creating the atmosphere.\nThe protagonists, supporting characters, and extras alike all sent me cold glares.\nFinally, I realized this was indeed the final act.\nThe end of this world was near.\n\"Haha, hahahaha...\"\n\"...Hya!\"\n\"Wait! Don’t move hastily...\"\nSlash.\nAn extra, unable to contain his anger, rushed at me.\nSiwoo must have told them about my abilities, but what a fool.\nThat’s why you’re an extra.\nSiwoo tried to stop him, but there was no way to.\nAs you can see.\nLike a bug caught in a Venus flytrap.\nEasily, he fell into a trap.\nDying pathetically without even a scream.\nHis body and face separated.\n\"Now, shall we start the final act...\"\nI bowed to the unseen audience.\nLike greeting those who came to see a grand puppet show.\n\"Please, enjoy the show.\"\n\"...Damn it. Everyone, get ready! The battle has already begun!\"\nThe penalty of not being able to reuse a thread once pulled from my clothes was long overcome.\nSo, we can enjoy it to the fullest.\nThe creator would surely be pleased.\n\"Initiate the operation to eliminate the villain Marionette! Watch out for the invisible threads!\"\nThe blood-stained festival was just beginning.",

      "content": "\"Arte, you really don’t have to come...\"\n\"What? But...\"\nSeeing her droop her head so sadly broke my heart.\nI appreciated her coming to meet me every day because she missed me. I really did, but...\n\"It's just... your belly is getting bigger. It could be dangerous, you know?\"\n\"Don’t worry about that. I always have someone protecting me.\"\n\"Hello.\"\nLaira looked at me nonchalantly, a cold sweat running down my back.\nIf this continued, I’d be overwhelmed by Arte’s logic.\nI had to do something.\n\"But... Laira is already considered dead, right? If someone finds out she came to the academy...\"\n\"Don’t worry about that. I’m wearing a hat, and my appearance has changed a bit since my abilities improved. No one will recognize me.\"\n\"....\"\nI knew.\nIt had been over a month since Arte had started coming to pick me up after school.\nIf someone had recognized her, they would have done so already.\nWas it because of the werewolf genes? Or the slightly sharper features?\nOr maybe it was because everyone firmly believed she was dead?\nSeeing how no one recognized her despite the stares we got at the academy gates, it seemed safe enough.\n\"The others aren’t suitable for protection, so I can slack off and it’s not a bother. Don’t worry too much.\"\n\"O-Okay...\"\nI was in trouble.\nI couldn’t think of any more reasons to convince Arte not to come.\nI thought I had to say it properly today, but...\nLooking around, I heard whispers from students pretending not to look at us.\n\"Is that her?\"\n\"Wow, I thought it was a lie, but she’s really pregnant...\"\n\"How tough it must be at her age...\"\nUgh...\nHere we go again.\nI appreciated Arte coming, but the pitying looks from the students directed at her, and the judgmental looks at me as if I had done something wrong, were...\nHard to describe.\n\"Do you not want me to come?\"\n\"N-No, it’s not that...\"\nOf course, Arte noticed my reaction.\nAs embarrassing as it was to admit, she really cared about me.\nAs Arte’s face darkened, the people around us reacted more intensely.\nNaturally, not in a good way.\n\"O-Of course, it’s fine. Haha...\"\nIn the end, I couldn’t stop Arte from visiting today either.\n...Damn it. I’m going to be teased again. She should be here any moment now.\n\"Oh, Arte. Hi. Here to pick up your husband again?\"\nSpeak of the devil.\nSometimes I cursed my intuition.\nCouldn’t it be wrong just once?\n\"He’s not my husband yet...\"\n\"Our dear Siwoo is too scared to go home alone, so he asks his pregnant girlfriend to pick him up, huh?\"\n\"....\"\nAmelia’s constant teasing made me angry, but I couldn’t say anything to her.\nMy instincts warned that retaliating would only make things worse.\nIn this case, not reacting was the best option.\nKnowing Amelia’s nature, she’d get bored soon enough.\n\"Geez, you’re no fun.\"\nAs expected.\nLosing interest in teasing me, Amelia soon focused on Arte’s belly.\n\"It’s so amazing. People’s bellies get this big.\"\n\"You know how many times you’ve said that?\"\n\"What am I supposed to do? It’s amazing every time I see it. Aren’t you amazed? Your daughter is in there.\"\n\"...It is amazing.\"\nWell...\nAmelia was right.\nThe fact that there was a child that Arte and I created inside her was incredible.\nEspecially since I had never imagined having a child until last year.\nI could understand why she found it amazing every time she saw it.\n\"Aren’t you tired of that topic?\"\n\"I’ll never get tired of it. I could talk about it every day.\"\n\"Good grief. I wonder what you’ll think when the baby is born.\"\n...A baby.\nIt still didn’t feel real.\nThe fact that I was going to be a father.\nThat Arte and I were going to have a family.\n\"Enough chit-chat. Shall we head back now?\"\n\"...I suppose so.\"\n\"Yes. We need some time to ourselves without interruptions, right?\"\nArte’s smile as she held out her hand was mesmerizing.\nTime alone, huh?\nThinking about it, having time alone might become rare soon.\nOnce the baby is born, the child will always be between Arte and me.\nArte had mentioned feeling bored when alone recently...\nEven that boredom might be a luxury soon.\nIn a few months, our child would be born.\nI had heard that raising a child was quite exhausting, even though I hadn’t experienced it myself.\nIf that was true, then enjoying a peaceful walk home would become a rare event.\n\"Are you going to hold my hand or not? Mmph...\"\nImpulsively, I stole a kiss from Arte.\nHer hand in mine, I smiled brightly.\n\"Alright, Arte. Let’s enjoy our time together.\"\n\"...Really, kissing me in public like that? It’s embarrassing.\"\n\"Haha, sorry.\"\nI suddenly realized there were other students around us.\nLost in thoughts of Arte, I hadn’t paid attention to their reactions.\nLooking around, I saw many surprised faces.\nThey probably hadn’t expected such a public display of affection.\nI felt good, as if I had delivered a blow to those who whispered about us.\n\"Shall we go?\"\nFeeling good, I decided to do something I rarely did in public.\nI wrapped my arm around Arte’s, making it clear to everyone that we were a couple.\n\"What’s gotten into you? You don’t usually do this.\"\n\"Just felt like it today.\"\n\"...Hehe, I don’t know why, but it makes me happy.\"\nLooking around, I noticed some people’s expressions darkening.\nProbably wishing they had a relationship like ours?\nThe envious looks confirmed it.\nI didn’t feel guilty.\nThe constant whispering had been annoying.\n\"Shall we go, Arte?\"\n\"Yes, let’s.\"\nGiving a final smile to the teasing Amelia, I strolled away slowly.\nSoon, I heard the sound of grinding teeth behind us.\n\"Could you do that at home, at least?\"\n\"Seriously. Does the boss and Siwoo not feel embarrassed?\"\nHaha.\nServes them right for teasing us.\nTake it as your just deserts.\n\"Okay, this is good.\"\nI tasted the food I had prepared with the ingredients we bought before heading home.\nThankfully, it didn’t taste bad.\nI hoped Arte would enjoy it.\nAs I was thinking that, I heard a grumble from the living room.\n\"I can cook too, you know...\"\n\"Oh no.\"\n\"You must be tired from the academy...\"\n\"Sigh.\"\n\"....\"\nI stifled Arte’s complaints.\nI had no intention of making a pregnant Arte cook.\nI could cook, after all.\nAlthough my skills weren’t as good as Arte’s, thanks to my time living alone, I could cook well enough to serve others.\n\"It feels like I’m always just receiving...\"\n\"That’s not true.\"\nI knew why Arte always wanted to do something.\nShe felt indebted to me.\nBut there was no need for her to feel that way.\n\"You don’t realize how much you help me every day.\"\nSiwoo didn’t think he was in a superior position in his relationship with Arte.\nBut Arte was different. Maybe because Siwoo had helped her?\nIt seemed she had a compulsion to do something for him.\nI appreciated it and found it cute, but if it made Arte stressed, that was a different story.\n\"What do you mean...\"\n\"Arte. I help you because I love you and care for you. You don’t need to feel that way.\"\n\"But...\"\nShe was more stubborn than I thought.\nArte sometimes showed this side.\n\"And you’re giving me a huge gift soon.\"\n\"A huge gift?\"\nDid I prepare something like that?\nHer puzzled look was adorable.\nI gently rubbed her belly as I spoke.\n\"Yes. The huge gift of our child.\"\n\"....\"\n\"So, don’t worry and enjoy the meal. Okay?\"\nThough I said that, I was cautious as the quality seemed a bit lower than Arte’s cooking.\nArte, who had been looking at me with teary eyes, smiled.\n\"Haha, if only you hadn’t said the last part.\"\n\"Is that so? Sorry.\"\n\"...It’s really good. Thank you.\"\nHer heartfelt compliment made me smile, and she smiled back.\nIt was a time of tender moments with my beloved, something I had never imagined before.",

      "content": "That night.\nAs Siwoo was relaxing in his room, he heard a knock on the door.\n\"Can I come in?\"\n\"Arte? Of course, come in.\"\nI didn’t need to ask who it was. The only person who would knock on my door was Arte.\nOther members of Arachne were always stationed at our house, just in case of an attack because of Arte’s pregnancy.\nBut they avoided coming into my room.\n\"What's up?\"\nAt first, we stayed at the place Arachne used as a base, but Arte said she didn't like it there.\nShe didn’t want the baby to hear bad things.\nI didn’t understand at first, but after seeing the basement of that mansion once, I didn’t argue.\nIt wasn’t a pleasant place.\nInitially, the others would come into my room to chat, but less than a week into this arrangement, they stopped.\n\"Um, I was wondering if I could sleep with you tonight?\"\n\"Sleep with me?\"\n\"Yes. Is that okay?\"\nTo sleep together...\nDid Arte understand what she was asking?\nWhen I turned to her, I saw her blushing and looking away.\nShe was clutching a pillow to her chest like she was determined.\n\"That's not a good idea.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"You know why.\"\nIf we just slept, there would be no problem.\nBut would I really just sleep if I were in bed with Arte?\n...No way.\nI wouldn’t be able to resist.\nEven though she was pregnant, she was still incredibly lovely to me.\nKnowing that, we had decided to use separate beds for a while.\nArte should have known that.\n\"The doctor said it's fine during the stable period.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"As long as it’s not too intense, it’s actually good for the baby...\"\nDid she ask the doctor about this?\nArte's face turned red as if she were embarrassed by her own words.\n\"Still, it’s not a good idea.\"\n\"Why not?!\"\n\"Don't ask the obvious.\"\nI lowered my pants, showing her how excited I already was.\nHad she not realized how aroused I was?\nSeeing her hesitate, I took a step towards her.\nArte stepped back, and we repeated this until she was against the wall with nowhere to go.\nI pressed my erection against her belly.\nHolding her arms tightly, I kissed her hard.\nArte’s eyes showed surprise at the roughness of my kiss.\n\"Now do you understand?\"\n\"Uh, well...\"\n\"You know I've been really pent up lately.\"\nThe first time we made love, it went on for three days.\nI had been extremely sexually frustrated then.\nI wanted to cherish her so much that my pent-up desires exploded.\nThe house had been a mess, and it took a while to clean up.\nEven the smell lingered, and we had to keep the windows open despite the cold.\nThere were still some stains left from that time.\nArte had been so exhausted she could barely move for days.\n\"Do you want me to lose control like that again?\"\n\"....\"\nSince then, we hadn’t been so intense.\nBut now, after abstaining for a while, I was back to being sexually frustrated.\nI still wanted to cherish her, but I was reaching my limit.\nSeeing her like this, I knew I wouldn’t be able to hold back.\nIf I started, Arte would give in and let me have my way.\nHer disheveled appearance was too tempting.\n\"...For the sake of our child... Ugh?!\"\n\"...That’s not fair.\"\n\"Arte, wait a minute!\"\nShe caught me off guard.\nGrabbing my erection, she pulled me to the bed.\nIt didn’t hurt, but having her grab me so firmly was unexpected.\nI couldn’t resist and let her guide me to the bed.\nLying there, I urgently spoke out, genuinely worried for our child’s safety.\n\"Arte, think again. For the baby’s sake...\"\n\"Don't worry.\"\n\"How can I not worry? It’s our child!\"\n\"If your stamina is the problem, I'll just tire you out first.\"\n\"What do you mean... Ugh?!\"\nBefore I knew it, her hands started stroking me.\nI groaned, her touch driving me crazy.\nArte, now comfortably sitting by my waist, began to pleasure me.\n\"Arte... Wait... Oh god...\"\n\"It's okay. That's what I'm doing this for.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nThick, white fluid spurted from me, staining her hand and the bed sheets.\nArte looked at the mess with fascination.\n\"Wow, that’s a lot. You really were pent up.\"\n\"....\"\n\"What’s wrong?\"\nI felt a deep sense of defeat.\nThere were plenty of excuses I could make.\nI was too aroused, Arte’s technique was too good, or I had been holding back for months.\nBut none of that changed the fact.\nI had come too quickly.\nJust from her hand.\n\"Are you upset about that?\"\n\"I want to die...\"\nSaying it was just one round wouldn’t help.\nMy male pride felt shattered.\nSeeing me deflate after climaxing, Arte quickly realized why I felt bad.\n\"...Oh no, what should I do?\"\nShe seemed desperate to comfort me.\nBut no amount of comfort would make me feel better.\nEven if Arte didn’t tease me about it, I felt humiliated.\nTrying to make up for it, Arte hesitantly asked me,\n\"Um... Do you want to touch my breasts?\"\n\"...Yes.\"\nThat cheered me up.\nMaybe it’s okay.\nThis could happen to anyone.\nUsually, I last much longer.\nThis was just an accident.\nProving I wasn’t wrong, Arte started stroking me again.\nThis time, I didn’t climax quickly.\n\"How does it feel?\"\n\"...Good. You’re really good.\"\nI sighed softly.\nArte showed no sign of stopping.\nI was getting aroused again.\nFine, I’ll go along with her plan.\nI didn’t want to stop without having sex.\nSo I decided to enjoy Arte’s touch for a while.\nBut I didn’t want to just touch her breasts to feel better.\nI didn’t want to be the only one enjoying this.\nI burrowed into her embrace.\n\"Eek?! Why so suddenly... Ah!\"\n\"Suck, slurp. Hmm, no milk.\"\n\"Of course not! I’m pregnant but haven’t given birth yet!\"\n\"Aw, I thought there’d be some.\"\nArte looked at me in disbelief.\nBut I ignored her and kept sucking.\n\"Ugh... No matter how much you try, no milk will come out...\"\n\"Think of it as practice. Before you feed the baby.\"\n\"What does that... Ah!\"\n\"I can’t steal my daughter’s food... but you’re mine. I should enjoy it first.\"\n\"It won’t taste good...\"\n\"No, it’s delicious.\"\nLooking at Arte’s blushing face and her soft breasts from below, nothing could taste better.\nWe spent a long time pleasuring each other that night.",

      "content": "\"Huff, huff...\"\nSweat poured down my face.\nI had lost track of time while enduring Arte’s caresses and sucking on her breasts partly out of revenge.\nArte smiled at me.\n\"I think that should do it!\"\n\"Huff, huff...\"\nHow was she so good at this?\nThere had been times when Arte had given me handjobs before.\nBut when she got serious, I couldn’t withstand her skillful hands.\nHow many times had I climaxed already?\nThe floor was a mess, covered in my cum.\n\"Well then, now that you're all tired out...\"\nArte lay down on the bed carefully.\nShe smiled seductively at me, inviting me.\n\"Wouldn’t you like to try it here instead of with your hand?\"\n\"Arte, are you trying to tempt me?\"\n\"Hehe.\"\nI felt my half-limp member stiffen again.\nHer spreading herself open to entice me was too erotic.\nShe was doing it on purpose.\nArte had tempted me today when I suggested waiting until tomorrow.\nShe grinned, knowing she had me hooked.\nI sighed softly.\n...I felt pathetic for giving in to her temptation.\n\"We'll go slowly tonight.\"\n\"That’s a nice change of pace.\"\nIn the end, I couldn’t resist Arte’s allure.\nLike a sailor drawn to a siren’s song, I moved toward Arte and entered her.\nThere was no need for foreplay.\nShe was already slick with arousal.\n\"Ah, mmm.\"\n\"How does it feel? Are you okay?\"\n\"It feels a bit strange, but it’s okay.\"\nI inserted myself slowly, trying not to startle her.\nHer moans made me pause repeatedly, worried I was hurting her.\nArte must have thought I wasn’t enjoying it because I was too focused on her.\nShe wrapped her arms around me and whispered.\n\"It’s okay. You can move.\"\n\"Are you sure? It doesn’t hurt?\"\n\"Yes, don’t worry. You worry too much, even with your intuition.\"\n\"...\"\nI worry because it’s about the person I love and our child.\nArte’s teasing made me a bit sulky, so I started moving my hips slowly.\n\"Ah, mm, ahh, it feels so strange...\"\n\"Huff, huff...\"\nStrange.\nI felt it too.\nWe were having sex, but it felt different from usual.\nIt was still sex, but not like the sex we usually had.\n\"Kiss me, kiss me...\"\n\"Are you addicted to kissing?\"\n\"Don’t say that...\"\n\"Alright, alright.\"\nI teased her lightly, but I also found it hard to resist kissing her, so I obliged.\nUnlike our usual passionate kisses, I kissed her slowly, matching the rhythm of my movements.\n\"Mmm, ah, mmm, chu...\"\nIt was a strange feeling.\nWe had never made love like this before.\nWe were always chasing after pleasure.\nIf she weren’t pregnant, tonight wouldn’t have been different.\n\"Hug me, hug me tight...\"\nI pulled her close and kissed her deeply.\nFortunately, Arte didn’t seem to be in pain, so I started to relax and feel a comforting pleasure that enveloped my whole body.\nIt was different from the primal pleasure of exploring each other’s bodies.\nIt felt like we were truly connected, as if we were one.\nI looked into Arte’s eyes.\nShe seemed to be experiencing the same unfamiliar pleasure.\n...My member swelled inside her.\nUsually, I would lose control and start ravishing her at this point.\nBut now, instead of chasing primal pleasure, I wanted to deepen our connection.\n\"It feels strange...\"\n\"I feel the same.\"\n\"It’s like I can feel you more inside me, Siwoo. It’s so vivid...\"\nI felt the same.\nI could feel Arte much more clearly than usual.\nThe sensation of her walls contracting around me felt like it was coursing through my entire body.\nWas she feeling something similar?\nSensing my impending climax, Arte hugged me tightly and kissed me again.\n\"Mmm, huff, chu, ha...\"\nTime seemed to blur as we confirmed our love through kisses.\nEventually, we looked into each other’s eyes and nodded.\nNeither of us was satisfied with just once.\nThe unique pleasure and the comforting sensation enveloping us.\nWe continued to explore each other’s bodies slowly.\n\"Hehe.\"\n\"...Why are you laughing?\"\n\"It’s just... funny.\"\n\"What’s funny?\"\nUnlike our usual sex filled with violent pleasure, we were making love slowly, sharing light conversation.\nBut it was enough because we knew each other’s bodies so well.\n\"It’s just that we have a baby in there, you know?\"\n\"...So?\"\n\"I was just thinking what our baby would think if she knew it was her dad poking in there.\"\n\"You...\"\n\"Would she get mad and tell you to stop? Haha.\"\nI wanted to scold her, but I couldn’t help but feel a bit concerned.\n...She couldn’t possibly know, but still.\nI gently rubbed her belly and spoke.\n\"Hey, it’s Daddy...\"\n\"Haha, what was that?\"\n\"....\"\nI shouldn’t have said that.\nArte laughed, and I turned away, feeling embarrassed.\nShe grabbed my face, still smiling.\n\"Sorry, it was just too cute.\"\n\"...I’m not sulking.\"\n\"Yes, yes.\"\nUgh.\nAnyone could tell I was sulking.\nOf course, Arte knew too and kissed my forehead.\n\"Siwoo.\"\n\"Yeah? What?\"\n\"For the last part, can we go a bit faster?\"\n\"What? But...\"\n\"It’ll be fine if it’s just a bit. Okay?\"\n\"...I warned you.\"\n\"Hehe. Think of it as a request from your naughty girlfriend.\"\nI was sure.\nI’d do anything Arte asked for the rest of my life.\nBut I didn’t mind.\nWhat wouldn’t I do for such a lovely girlfriend?\nI focused on my intuition just in case, and it felt like it would be okay to speed up a little, so I began to move faster.\n\"Ah, mm, ahh, ah...\"\n\"Arte, Arte...\"\n\"Huff, huff, I love you, Siwoo. I love you.\"\n\"I love you too, Arte.\"\nWe whispered our love as we made love.\nWith our unborn child between us.\nThus, our small moment of intimacy continued.\n\"Haa.\"\n\"Why the sigh?\"\n\"Nothing, just feeling a bit lonely.\"\nLaira sighed, eating grapes in the kitchen.\nShe could hear the sounds of the two whispering their love.\n\"They really can’t live without each other.\"\n\"Why don’t you get a lover too? The boss wouldn’t mind.\"\n\"Easy for you to say.\"\n\"Why? It shouldn’t be that hard.\"\n\"You talk so lightly.\"\n\"Of course, it’s easy for me to say. I have no chance.\"\nLaira glanced at her lower body, and there was Spira's tail.\nRight, her entire lower body had been replaced.\nIt seemed she had taken a pill that transformed her lower half into that of a snake.\n\"Your... lower half changed too?\"\n\"Of course. Who would like this?\"\nSpira moved her tail around.\n\"Well, someone might...\"\n\"Sure, there might be someone who likes women with snake lower bodies. But I wouldn’t.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"How would you feel about someone who wanted to sleep with a werewolf?\"\nSomeone wanting to sleep with a werewolf?\nLaira imagined a man aroused by her transformed state.\n\"Ugh.\"\n\"See? I feel the same.\"\n\"That’s... a bit much.\"\n\"That’s why I gave up a long time ago.\"\nI couldn’t help but nod.\nSpira had her own struggles.\nI used to think she was just a leech, always hanging around and boasting about her resilience.\nMaybe I should treat her better.\n\"...You’re not thinking something weird, are you?\"\n\"Nothing at all.\"\n\"Let’s get some sleep. And please, no eavesdropping on Arte and Siwoo’s intimate moments.\"\n\"...You were the one listening the most.\"\n\"Ahem! That’s not true! I was just worried Siwoo might be late tomorrow!\"\n\"Sure, sure.\"",

Why can’t we see anything? It’s so frustrating.\"\n\"They designed it this way so even supers can’t see through it.\"\n\"...Why?\"\n\"To be considerate.\"\nConsiderate?\nSeeing the confused looks on the younger ones, Hayeon gave a wry smile.\nI’m getting old.\nI didn’t expect to be explaining this to others.\nHaving become accustomed to being a teacher, Hayeon explained.\n\"What do you think about childbirth?\"\n\"...What do you mean? It’s the process of giving birth to a child.\"\n\"Not the dictionary meaning, the feeling. What do you think of when you hear ‘childbirth’?\"\nFeelings, huh?\nLaira answered nonchalantly.\n\"Maternal and paternal love? A father crying while holding his child.\"\n\"Right. That’s the general idea. ...But what if it’s not?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Childbirth isn’t as beautiful as you might think.\"\nHayeon had learned this by chance.\nUntil she witnessed someone else giving birth, she had the same thoughts as these kids.\n\"A newborn is wrinkled. The process of giving birth can be shocking and nauseating to those with weak stomachs.\"\n\"...Really?\"\n\"Yes. That’s why it’s considerate.\"\nSeeing a baby covered in blood and other fluids is quite different from what’s shown in the media.\nA newborn isn’t as cute as you might think.\nNew parents, having never experienced childbirth, can be quite shocked.\nThey might think the wrinkled, messy baby from their wife’s belly is ugly and feel an abrupt chill in their affection.\nWitnessing the painful and raw process can leave some with emotional scars.\n\"On a joyous day, there’s no reason to let them have such a negative experience.\"\n\"Huh... that’s interesting...\"\n\"Isn’t it?\"\nHayeon watched a blonde girl who was eavesdropping.\nIt was fascinating.\nThat wrinkly bundle of flesh turned into such a beautiful young girl.\n...Though her personality didn’t seem to have inherited her father’s gentleness.\n\"Is that why we can’t hear anything either?\"\n\"That’s part of it.\"\nOf course, she didn’t think Siwoo would be that shocked seeing his child.\nShe had heard he once consumed Arte’s heart. He wouldn’t be disgusted by this.\nStill, there were hygiene issues, so he couldn’t go in.\n\"...Shouldn’t he be allowed in, though? He looks like he’s about to faint.\"\n\"...\"\nWhere had his intuition gone?\nJust as they feared he might actually pass out, the light above the door turned on and the delivery room door opened.\n\"Is Arte okay?! Is she alright?!\"\n\"Calm down for a moment...\"\n\"Is she okay?! Is there a problem...\"\n\"Ugh... you’re so noisy...\"\n\"Arte!\"\n...He rushed in quickly.\n\"Glad to see they’re close.\"\n\"Worried your students’ lives would get messed up?\"\n\"Of course. What teacher wouldn’t worry when a student has a crisis?\"\nClaire, who had rushed over upon hearing about the birth, sighed deeply.\nIt must feel like a huge weight lifted.\n\"Isn’t it the same for you?\"\n\"...Yes.\"\nHayeon didn’t argue with Claire.\nShe had started her teaching career out of revenge, but...\nSeeing Siwoo and Arte smile so happily, and that child who looked just like her father thumping Siwoo’s back and yelling...\nBeing a teacher was more fulfilling than she had imagined.\nShe felt proud.\n\"She’s so beautiful... our baby...\"\n\"...You think that’s beautiful? Seriously? Is your head okay?\"\nHe’s completely smitten.\nAlthough she hadn’t expected it, it seemed there was no need to worry about Siwoo being shocked.\nHe was staring at his crying daughter, repeatedly saying how beautiful she was.\n\"...Are you alright, Arte?\"\n\"Oh, Professor. I’m fine. The one who had it worse was waiting outside.\"\nArte laughed, looking at her boyfriend who was entranced by their daughter.\n\"It hurt, but seeing Siwoo more nervous than me made it easier.\"\n\"...I see.\"\n\"He knows I’m okay, but he still worries so much.\"\n...She was just as smitten.\nSeeing her laugh and call him cute despite the exhaustion made Hayeon think that.\n\"Arte.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Have you thought about returning to the academy? With your abilities, you could easily advance. You could be with your boyfriend. I’ll handle the rumors.\"\nWas she still hopeful?\nHad she forgotten the major event of the pregnancy, or was she just ignoring it?\nClaire started suggesting Arte re-enroll in the academy.\nArte’s abilities were too valuable to let go.\nBut Arte smiled and shook her head.\n\"Sorry, but that’s impossible.\"\n\"Why? Don’t worry about childcare. The academy has facilities for staff...\"\nClaire, shocked by the rejection, began to persuade her again.\nShe must have thought childcare was the issue.\nBut Arte shook her head again.\n\"I appreciate the offer, but it’s really impossible.\"\n\"Ha, fine. Pressing further would be wrong. ...But can you at least tell me why?\"\n\"It’s nothing special.\"\nConcerned for the baby’s safety.\nOr maybe worried about infections.\nArte glanced lovingly at Siwoo, who was cautiously watching their baby.\n\"I don’t think this will be our only one.\"\n\"...\"\n\"He loves this so much, I’m sure I’ll be pregnant again soon.\"\nThat made sense...!\nClaire and Hayeon nodded in agreement.\nIt seemed highly likely.\nSeeing how inseparable they were, it was hard to imagine them not having more children.\nWith the birth behind them, nothing would hold them back.\n\"So, Hayeon, I’ll be counting on you.\"\n\"...\"\nWas that an unofficial retirement announcement?\nShe was still nominally the leader of Arachne, but it seemed she wouldn’t be active anymore.\nFeeling a bit melancholic, Hayeon nodded.\n\"So, what are your plans now?\"\n\"My plans?\"\n\"Even with pregnancy, you won’t spend all your time on childcare. Do you have any plans?\"\n\"I don’t have long-term plans, but there’s something coming up soon.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yes. You have to come. And bring Dorothy, Claire, the frontliners, and all the classmates.\"\nWhat was she planning with so many people?\nShe just said she would minimize her Arachne activities.\nSurely, she wasn’t planning to kill them all.\nAs Hayeon pondered, Arte laughed and spoke brightly.\n\"We need to have a wedding!\"\nOh.\nRight, they hadn’t had a wedding yet.",

He might not even recognize you.\"\n\"Don't be silly.\"\n\"I'm serious. You don't know how stunning you look.\"\nI chuckled at Dorothy and Amelia's excited voices.\nThere’s no way that could be true.\nThey're exaggerating.\n\"You don't believe me? Fine. If Siwoo faints later, it's not our fault.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"\n\"...How do you feel, Arte?\"\nAmelia asked as she adjusted the veil on my head.\nHow do I feel?\n\"I don't know. What should I feel?\"\nHonestly, I didn't think a wedding held much significance.\nSiwoo and I were already living together as common-law partners.\nWe decided to have a wedding because of its symbolic meaning.\nIt felt right to hold a ceremony if we were going to spend our lives together.\nI didn’t think I’d be nervous at all.\n...But the reflection in the mirror told a different story.\nA woman in a pure white dress, holding a bouquet with slightly trembling hands.\n\"I didn’t think a wedding would mean much to me.\"\n\"Are you nervous?\"\n\"...Yes.\"\nIt was a mix of emotions.\nAnticipation, excitement, joy.\nAll these feelings swirled in my mind.\nI thought it was just a typical event everyone does.\nI didn’t expect to be this nervous about a wedding I took lightly.\n\"Of course you’re nervous.\"\n\"...I suppose.\"\n\"Sure. This is the day you announce to the world that this man is yours.\"\n\"...\"\nDeclaring to the world that Siwoo is my man.\nThinking that made me feel lighter.\nSiwoo being mine is a given.\n\"Wah, wah...\"\n\"Hold on. What’s wrong, sweetie? Need the bathroom? Hungry?\"\nIn the middle of getting ready, my baby started fussing. I quickly put down the bouquet and picked her up.\nNo bathroom... is she hungry?\nIt was about time for her to eat.\nBabies need to eat more often than you’d think.\nI loosened the top of my dress and brought Irene to my breast.\nHer fussing stopped, and the room was filled with the sound of her nursing.\nI don't know how much time passed.\nIrene pulled away and started making small, content noises.\n\"All done? Good girl.\"\nI patted her back until she closed her eyes, full and sleepy. I gently placed her back in her crib.\nShe was still young.\nShe fell asleep quickly after being put down.\n...So adorable.\nI proudly turned to the two women who were now staring at my daughter.\n\"Isn't she cute?\"\n\"...She’s adorable.\"\n\"She gets cuter every time I see her. Must be because she takes after her mom.\"\nOh, more nonsense.\nI quickly cleaned up and adjusted my dress again, not wanting to get sidetracked.\n\"...You’ve gotten good at this.\"\n\"Well, it’s been months.\"\nI wasn’t always this good.\nI spent many sleepless nights because of a fussy baby.\nAfter many trials and errors, I could now confidently say I was a capable mom.\nI could understand why Irene was crying after just a bit of fussing.\nI’d grown as a mother.\nFeeling proud, I straightened my shoulders.\nSee? I’ve got this.\nBut instead of complimenting me, Amelia and Dorothy just exchanged glances between me and Irene with strange looks.\n\"Isn’t this backwards?\"\n\"Backwards?\"\n\"Most people don’t calm a baby at their wedding.\"\n\"...Let's not talk about that.\"\nEven I thought it was a bit strange.\nA mom bringing her baby to her wedding.\nIt was unusual, but it was my reality.\nIgnoring my plea, they continued their conversation.\n\"I was so shocked when I heard she was pregnant with a second child already.\"\n\"Me too... How strong must their relationship be?\"\n\"At least she’s not showing yet. We’d need a new dress otherwise.\"\n\"Stop it! Don’t make fun of me...!\"\n\"Wah, wah...\"\nWe all froze and looked at the crib.\n...Did we wake her? Were we too loud?\nThis was bad.\nIf she started crying, she wouldn’t stop easily.\nWe were almost ready, but there were still a few things left to do.\nRealizing the gravity of the situation, we all stared tensely at the crib.\nThankfully, Irene didn’t wake up and drifted back to sleep.\n\"Phew... That was close...\"\n\"...Let’s be quieter.\"\n\"Yeah, let's. The wedding’s about to start. We can’t wake her.\"\nWe continued our preparations in silence.\nFixing my dress and adjusting the decorations for a few more minutes until there was a knock on the door.\n\"The ceremony is about to start! Are you ready? Amelia, come quickly! We need to check the equipment!\"\n\"Oh no, it’s time already.\"\n\"We’ll be going now. Good luck!\"\n\"Hey, don’t forget Irene!\"\n\"Oh, right.\"\nThey hurriedly left the room, heading to their respective places.\nDorothy went to where the guests were seated.\nAmelia went to the place where the wedding officiant stood.\n\"All set.\"\n\"Great. When the doors open, walk slowly as we practiced. Remember?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nThe wedding planner stepped out, and soon the music started, and the ceremony began.\n...The nerves that had subsided while chatting with them came rushing back, making my bouquet shake.\nI was nervous.\nBut it wasn’t just nervousness mixed with fear.\nIt was joy.\nThe joy of making unforgettable memories with Siwoo.\nThat joy made my hands tremble.\n\"Now, let’s welcome the beautiful bride!\"\nThe once noisy wedding hall was now filled with soft music as I took my first steps in my white shoes.\nStep by step.\nAs I walked, I saw the guests looking at me.\nDorothy, holding Irene, smiling from above.\nHayeon and Professor Claire, watching me in their formal suits.\nSpira, not paying attention as she eyed the drinks on the table, with Laira trying to stop her.\nClassmates gathered in one group, front-line heroes in another.\nAll the connections I’d made were here, looking at me.\nBut I couldn’t focus on them.\nSiwoo, waiting for me by the groom's room, was in front of me.\n\"...You look beautiful.\"\nSiwoo murmured, staring at me.\n\"You look handsome too, Siwoo.\"\nEverything we practiced for the ceremony vanished from my mind.\nWhoever said practice makes perfect lied.\nSiwoo’s suit, which I had seen many times, looked incredibly handsome.\nAnd Siwoo seemed as mesmerized by my dress as I was by his suit.\nBecause we had been staring at each other for too long, Amelia took over.\n\"It seems the groom and bride are so taken with each other that they’re in a daze. This wasn’t in the plan!\"\nLaughter erupted from the guests at Amelia’s half-serious joke.\nThat snapped Siwoo and me back to reality, and we were horrified.\n...We messed up.\nAmelia, deciding the script was useless, tossed her paper aside.\n\"Alright, let’s ask the bride and groom directly!\"\nThump, thump.\nMy heart pounded so loudly it felt like I could hear it in my ears.\nIf the author were still inside me, they might have passed out from the excitement.\n\"Do you pledge eternal love to each other?\"\n\"...Of course.\"\n\"I do.\"\n\"Then, seal it with a kiss.\"\nChaos.\nOur carefully planned ceremony was ruined by our mistake, leading to an impromptu kiss.\nBut I didn’t mind.\nI tossed the bouquet and embraced Siwoo, kissing him deeply.\nLet the world know of our love.",

Breakfast?\nHer stomach growled at the aroma, and she sighed, changing into her clothes.\nAfter all, today was her first day at the academy.\nGetting up early wouldn’t be a bad thing.\n“Oh, what’s this? My daughter is up early.”\n“Good morning, Mom… I was going to sleep more, but I smelled something delicious.”\n“You have a keen nose for food, don’t you? Just wait a little longer. Breakfast will be ready soon.”\n“Okay.”\nPeeking into the kitchen, she saw her mom preparing an unusually large amount of food.\nIt looked so tasty.\nMom’s cooking was always delicious, but today she seemed to be putting in extra effort.\nFeeling excited, she walked back to the dining table, where her dad was already seated with a cup of coffee.\n“Good morning, Dad. When did you get here?”\n“I’ve been here since before you woke up, Irene. You just didn’t notice.”\n“No way?!”\n“It’s true. You always sleep so much.”\nHer dad’s murmuring made her blush with embarrassment.\nHow did I not notice?\nSo embarrassing…\n“How can you achieve your dreams like this? You need to be diligent to become a hero.”\n“I can do it! I woke up early today!”\n“We’ll see…”\nHer dad’s teasing smile made her pout.\nHe was great, but sometimes he was too teasing.\nJust wait. From now on, I’ll wake up at this time and make him proud.\nBut given her past habits, she decided to change the subject instead of arguing.\n“I’ll change from now on, really.”\n“Where’s my little brother?”\n“He’ll be up soon. He’ll be surprised to see you up this early.”\n“Dad, you exaggerate too much.”\nEven if she woke up a bit earlier, it wasn’t such a big deal.\nHer thoughts were interrupted by her brother’s voice as he walked down the stairs.\n“…What’s going on? Why is my sister up? Am I still dreaming?”\n“Hey?! That’s too much!”\n“Huh. You really are up early, sis.”\nDarn it.\nWhy was her reputation so low in her family?\nEven if she woke up a bit earlier today, it’s not like she always slept in… which she did.\nHer brother always had to wake her up.\nShe had no defense.\n“Enough chatting, you two. Si-hyun, sit down. Time to eat.”\n“Yes, Mom.”\nThankfully, her mom finished cooking and they could move on.\nDish after dish, the table filled with a variety of delicious foods.\n“…What’s with all the food?”\n“I put in some extra effort today. It’s a special day, after all.”\n“Thanks to sis, we’re having a feast this morning.”\nIsn’t this too much?\nShe thought, but her mom’s smile made her decide to eat gratefully.\n“Thanks for the meal.”\n“Eat a lot.”\nThe hot food was so good that she was reminded of a family trip when they had marveled at the delicious food in a fancy hotel.\n“Mom, I always knew you were a great cook, but this is amazing…”\n“Well, I worked hard on it since yesterday.”\nHer mom’s proud smile made it seem like she was saying, “This is how good I am if I have time.”\nShe looked stunning, hardly seeming like a mother of two.\n“…Speaking of which, Irene?”\n“Yes?”\n“Are you prepared for the entrance ceremony?”\n“…Yes.”\nShe had practiced.\nShe had tried to make sure she wouldn’t appear awkward.\nBut would it be enough?\nHer uncertainty made her hesitate to answer.\n“…I’m sorry, Irene.”\n“Mom, it’s not your fault!”\n“But… you find it hard to make friends because of me.”\nShe couldn’t deny it.\nHer sharp, almost closed eyes were a genetic trait from her mom.\nBut she wanted to say it wasn’t her mom’s fault.\nShe wasn’t ashamed of looking like her mom.\n“Humph. People who get scared because of looks aren’t worth my time.”\n“Irene…”\nShe and her mom looked alike.\nSo much so that people often mistook them for sisters when they walked together.\nNot sisters, but mother and daughter.\n…Anyway, because they looked alike, she could see herself objectively.\nHer mom’s appearance was hers.\nWithout needing a mirror, she could see how others viewed her by looking at her mom.\nHer mom looked quite suspicious.\nHer half-closed eyes and gentle smile reminded her of a sinister character from a childhood cartoon.\nA smiling villainous mastermind.\nAnd if she opened her eyes wide, it looked even scarier.\nSometimes, her mom’s red eyes, though beautiful, seemed to harbor an ominous presence.\nI looked no different from my mom.\nFrom kindergarten to elementary, middle, and high school.\nShe was often shunned by her peers.\nEspecially as a child, it was worse.\nBy high school, kids were more considerate and just avoided her, but younger kids outright cried because she scared them.\nSome children even thought cartoons were real, crying that a villain had appeared next to them.\nIt was disheartening.\n…Darn it. Only depressing thoughts are coming to mind.\n“It’s okay! Things will be better at the academy! Mom, you made friends there too, right?”\nShe tried to sound cheerful to push away the gloomy thoughts.\nShe hadn’t made many friends, but she never blamed her mom for it.\nShe knew how much her mom loved her.\n“Well, Aunt Amelia and Aunt Dorothy were also academy friends, right?”\n“True…”\nMom’s friends, who occasionally sent her and her brother gifts.\nThey both said they made friends at the academy.\nWouldn’t there be someone like that for her too?\nThe academy was a place to train heroes.\nThere wouldn’t be many kids who judged others by their appearance.\n…Thinking of Aunt Amelia reminds me.\n“Hey, Mom.”\n“Yes?”\n“Why does Aunt Amelia’s expression change whenever she sees me?”\n“Change?”\n“Yes. She says strange things and her expression gets weird. What was it, ‘little bundle of flesh’? ‘Wrinkly’?”\n“…Don’t worry about it.”\n“Really…?”\n“It’s just that Amelia is single, that’s all.”\nI didn’t understand, but if Mom said it was okay, then it must be okay. I decided not to think about it.\n“At the academy, some teachers might react strangely… don’t let it bother you.”\n“Strangely?”\n“It’s just that you and I look very similar. The teachers might be surprised.”\n“…Oh.”\nTeachers who taught my mom might still be there.\nIt felt strange.\nGoing to the same school my mom attended, being taught by her teachers.\nIt wasn’t an experience everyone had.\nThe thought made me happy, and my brother spoke up.\n“But sis, shouldn’t you be leaving soon?”\n“What? What time is it… already…?”\nLooking at the clock, I was shocked.\nWas it this late already?\nI’d be late!\n“Mom! Dad! Sorry, I have to go!”\n“Take care.”\n“See you later!”\nStuffing a few bites into my mouth, I hurried upstairs.\nRunning or taking public transport would mean I’d definitely be late given the distance to the academy.\nSo there was no choice.\nOpening the window, I leaped out, transforming my hand into a thread to stick to the building’s wall and quickly move using the momentum.\nThe cold morning air messed up my hair a bit, but I didn’t care.\nBetter than being late.\nAfter a few minutes of moving with the thread, I arrived at the academy just in time and greeted a familiar face at the gate.\n“Claire! Hello! And goodbye!”\n“Oh, hello, Irene… she’s already gone. So fast.”\nClaire sighed.\nShe’s nothing like her parents.\nBut thinking about it, she smiled at the thought of having a student who resembled her old ones.\n“Now, the latecomers…”\nBang!\n“I’m not late, right?! Huh? Hayeon?! You’re my homeroom teacher?!”\n“…Call me ‘teacher.’ I’ll let it slide today since it’s the first day. Introduce yourself and come in.”\n“Phew…”\nHayeon’s look said it all.\nHow could she sleep so late and rush like this?\n…Knowing the teacher wasn’t always a good thing.\nFeeling awkward, I fixed my hair as I noticed the students staring at me.\n“Um, ahem.”\nIntroduction, introduction.\nTime to deliver the lines I practiced so hard.\nIt would be nice to make some friends.\nTaking a deep breath, I smiled at the students who might become my friends.\n“Hello, my name is Irene Isis! Just because I have squinty eyes doesn’t mean I’m a villain! Nice to meet you!”",

      "content": "Hello, everyone. This is 별불꽃 (Starfire).\n···There are so many things I want to say in this afterword. I don't even know where to start.\nSo I'll just talk about whatever comes to mind.\nIt might be all over the place···.\nBut I have so much I want to share with my readers. Please bear with me.\nLet's start with the simple reason why I began writing this novel.\nIt was nothing special.\nI wanted to read a story with a protagonist who uses this kind of power.\nI thought it would be unique to create a story while interacting with the author.\nThose were the small, insignificant, and random thoughts that led me to write this novel.\nThere wasn't any other reason.\nThe reason this novel is a pure romance (순애물) is also nothing special.\nMy previous work had no romance, so I was deciding between a pure romance or a yuri genre for this one.\nIn the end, I just went with pure romance.\nIn another universe, this could have been a yuri story.\nSome of you might be wondering about the plot.\nThere wasn't one.\nFrom writing the prologue to this afterword, there was no plot.\nWhen writing the prologue, I only had two things set:\nThe protagonist is a reincarnated TS (transsexual) female character who uses threads from clothes and is misunderstood as a villain.\nAnd she communicates with the \"author\" to create the story.\nThat’s it.\nI didn’t know what kind of ability Siwoo would have, who the author was, or how the two would end up together.\nAmelia, Dorothy, Hayul, Laira, Spira, the club president, and other numerous characters.\nNone of them were planned.\nIt all started from a blank slate.\nAll I had were Arte and the author.\nI'm reminded of a famous line from Bong Joon-ho's movie, Parasite.\n\"Do you know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all.\"\nThat's right.\nAlthough it wasn't intentional, it turned out exactly like that.\nI hadn't even decided on the protagonist's name until around the first or second chapter.\nI took inspiration from the Greek mythological prophet, Tiresias, who is perhaps the first TS character.\nThe story goes like this:\nTiresias was transformed into a woman after striking two mating snakes and lived as a woman for years until two gods visited them.\nZeus and Hera.\nThe gods asked, who enjoys sex more, men or women?\nTiresias answered,\n\"Oh, being a woman is nine times more enjoyable than being a man!\"\nArte Isis is an anagram of Tiresias.\nTiresias.\nArte isis.\nHaha.\nI thought about using this as a hint or reveal at some point, but it ended up only serving as inspiration.\nWhen Hayul asked if that was a prophecy.\nThat was the only time I used it. It's a bit disappointing.\nI had to come up with the name of the romantic interest while writing the story.\nEventually, I went with Siwoo, a common name in web novels.\nI decided on his ability impulsively: intuition.\nI think it was because the author explained their ability using the example of Schrödinger's cat.\nSo that's how it was decided.\nI can't remember which came first, the author's ability or Siwoo's.\nHowever, the fact remains that Laplace's demon was ultimately defeated by someone close to a god.\nThe author character was a bit of a sore spot for me.\nShe always got a lot of criticism.\nShe was called a nuisance, people asked when she would die, and they labeled her as annoying.\nI aimed to make her a character who was annoying but cute.\nBut when she was constantly criticized, I wondered if I had mischaracterized her.\nSince her existence was the reason I started writing this novel, I couldn't just change her.\nI had to continue with her, and luckily, there were quite a few who found her cute.\nLaira's name was inspired by Laira from \"Tales of Vesperia.\"\n\"Feel the glory of the new sun.\"\nA 5-cost 3/5 card that’s really annoying.\nDon't know what I'm talking about? That's okay.\n\"Miracle Priest\"···. You did well···. Ugh, my head.\nBut she didn't have any inspiration beyond the name.\n···Laira turned out to be a pivotal character in this novel.\nYou might remember the scene early on when Laira almost died at Arte's hands.\nI debated for a long time after writing that scene.\nShould I kill her or let her live?\nIn the end, I decided to let her live···.\nIf I had killed her, the story might have ended with a bad or normal ending rather than a happy one.\nThe grim parts might have been much longer.\nThat was a crucial scene where the entire direction of the story could have changed.\nAnd then there's Spira.\nShe was also supposed to die.\nI kept her alive because of the inspiration from Tiresias.\nThe idea was that even though Arte should have killed the snake, she spared it, and through Spira, everyone learns that they were all human and not puppets.\nThat was the idea.\nIn the Bible, the serpent gives Eve the forbidden fruit.\nI took inspiration from that.\nThe forbidden fruit is often seen as the fruit of knowledge.\nSo the snake (Spira) gives the fruit of knowledge (the truth that they were all human), and Eve (Arte) eats it and realizes the truth.\nThat was the concept.\nLooking back now that the novel is complete, it feels like a dead story.\nI could have explored Spira's story more if I had taken a slower pace.\nIt's a shame.\nNot having a plot led to this accident.\nIt might sound reckless, but I actually enjoyed it.\nI felt like a captain steering a ship called 실눈흑막 (Silnoonheukmak) with you readers as my crew, navigating through the vast, uncharted ocean.\nAnd as you can see, we made it safely.\nThank goodness.\n···Of course, there were challenges.\nBalancing a full-time job while writing was more difficult than I thought.\nEven though your encouragement kept me going, there were times when I had to take breaks because it was tough.\nIn the early days, I received a lot of harsh criticism.\nWhy is this TS?\nIt feels disgusting; put a tag on it.\nIsn't this gay?\nAt this point, I'm used to hearing those comments so often.\nBut back then, I got quite upset and even reported them to Novelpia.\nThere was a time when I called out to the PD for help.\nFor that, I am very grateful to the PD.\nIf I had truly broken down then, I might have stopped writing.\nLooking back now that I've completed this work, it turns out my mental fortitude was stronger than I thought.\nJust having someone to talk to and hear standard advice from helped a lot.\nThat aside, there were no other significant hardships.\nSometimes, writing doesn't come easily, but that's just part of being a writer.\nHmm.\nI'm not sure what else to say now.\nI have so much I want to share with you all, but···.\nIf I keep talking, it feels like it will never end.\nSo let's talk about the next project.\nThankfully, this time I have a rough plot.\nThe next work will also be set in an academy.\nHowever, this time the protagonist won't be a student.\nInstead, we'll follow the perspective of a teacher.\nNot just any teacher, though.\nYes? Then it's not a teacher?\nDon't worry. Even a counselor stationed in the academy is a teacher, right?\nIn 실눈흑막, there was a lot of feedback about Arte being reluctant to kill people.\nSo the protagonist in the next story is a kind kid? Also, I like kind protagonists.\nBut it would be a bit dull if it were just a counselor.\n···What if we add a touch of hypnosis?\nA teacher with a kind face who is always nice to the students.\nStudents who trust and follow this teacher.\nBut then the secret of the teacher's hypnosis ability is discovered.\nThe students, filled with betrayal, tremble with rage.\nThey trusted and relied on the teacher who always treated them kindly···!\nTeacher, did you really hypnotize us···!\nSomething like that.\nIsn't it good···? I like it···.\nOf course, this will require some build-up, so it will come out much later in the story.\nBut I could write several chapters just for that scene.\nSo, from now on, I'll be working on \"\nI Became an Academy Counselor.\n\" (\nread on Novelight\n)\nBut with a touch of hypnosis.\nWhen will it start?\nNext Monday.\nSomeone once said,\n\"You can sleep when you're dead.\"",
