      "content": "No one becomes evil without a cause.\nAt least I think so.\nBut that may not be the case for the novels I read. It reminds me of a certain romance fantasy novel.\nIn this novel, which is commonly referred to as a romance novel, several villains appear.\nAmong them was a person who piqued my interest.\nIt was Shael Azbel, the wicked woman who tormented the main character endlessly. She was a typical villainess who did evil deeds from a young age and interfered with the main character when she grew up.\nInterfering with the main character? If that was the case, her fate was predetermined.\nShael, the wicked woman, met a miserable end in the end.\nAn obvious development that anyone would expect. Still, I had one question.\n‘Why did she become a villainess?’\nGood parents, good fiancé, and she had a lot of money along with a noble status. She had it all.\nEvery cruel villain has a reason for being a villain. So I asked in the comment section.\n– Aren’t there any side stories about Shael?\nNEBWJ32:\nWhy did you suddenly leave him?\nropanjoa:\nMaybe she was jealous to see the male lead and the female lead conversing together???\n– What .. Why did she become a villainess?\ntjswkrwha:\nIt must be her nature!\nNo one spoke sympathetically.\nWell, most readers wanted to see the love between the male and female protagonists as an anecdotal story, no one wanted to know about the villainess’ past.\n‘What do you mean by nature?’\nAnyway, Shael, the reason I read the novel, died, and there was no more information about her.\nMy reason for reading the novel disappeared. So I stopped reading.\nAnd… what I saw before me was a luxurious room.\nI didn’t know that I would be possessing someone in the novel.\n***\nI looked around. Luxurious furniture, and mysteriously shaped houses. Strangely, his room was even more spacious.\nWhat was reflected in the glass window was a young man, with blue hair, dark blue eyes and distinct features. Next, the strong muscles come into view. It was a body that made it hard to fathom just how much effort he must have put into it. To match this, a stylish sword was placed at his side.\n‘…What?’\nI remained silent with my gaze fixed on the window. But that silence didn’t last long.\nKikiiik…\nIt was the sound of a door opening.\n“Eran, it’s time to go to meer Shael. I expect that you’re ready.”\nA man’s voice. And two familiar names, Eran and Shael. Shael was the villain of the novel I read, and Eran was the name of the fiancée of the wicked woman who would be killed by her.\nThe middle-aged man looked at me and called me ‘Eran’.\n‘…I became Eran Baslettt? So, does that mean I was transported in the novel?’\n“What are you doing, Eran? Wake up.”\nThe middle-aged man said. This man also had blue hair and dark blue eyes. I could easily guess who this person was. Perhaps his identity was Ezran Baslett, Eran’s father and the Duke.\nI found it very hard to comprehend the situation. Of course I did. To think that I would suddenly become the fiancé of the villainess in the novel! It was a situation which anyone would find hard to believe.\nBut I got up and answered. Because the only thing I was confident about was my ability to adapt.\n“Yes, Father.”\n“Yes, your betrothed is waiting. You must not keep your fiancée waiting. Come with me.”\nWe left the room with a fairly quick gait. Still, the time it took showed just how big the mansion really was.\nLeaving the large mansion, we got on the huge carriage. Its speed was incredible!\nAs I thought about what the hell had happened, we reached our destination. This time, it was a mansion of enormous size.\nA man who appeared to be a butler approached us and said.\n“Eran Baslett, the Lady is inside. I will guide you.”\nI followed the butler, who guided me to a door to a room.\nIt was a room that looked like it would be occupied by a high-ranking person. The situation was advancing so fast. Nonetheless, I knew only one thing. This was Shael Azbel’s room. So, it was the room of the wicked woman in the novel. I took a deep breath and opened the door.\nKikiiik…\n“You’re late.”\nWhat I saw, was a woman. And, I heard the woman’s voice too. It was a cold voice, as if it could freeze the surroundings.\n“Why the hell are you standing there in a daze?”\nHer light blue hair fluttered. At the same time, her sky blue eyes stared at me. It was a look that seemed to project her scorn.\n“Answer!”\n“Sorry, Shael.”\nI reflexively apologized when prompted. Then the eyes that were looking at me turned to the chair across from her.\nRecognizing the hidden meaning, I carefully sat down. A moment of silence lingered in the room. An atmosphere of deathly suffocation. Unable to bear the atmosphere, I was the one who spoke first,\n“…How are you, Shael?”\n“No.”\n“⋯”\nGoblin:\nPlease whitelist this site in your a*blocker to support the translation.

      "content": "A greeting I had come up with after much thought. Upon hearing it, her reply was a denial that she had spoken out at once without thinking. And then, silence reigned again. While I was contemplating whether to say\nmore, it was Shael who unexpectedly broke the silence this time.\n“It’s not fun.”\n“…”\nHer straightforward words portrayed the image of a wicked woman. Of course, it was still at a bearable level.\nLater, she even killed me, her fiancé. Thinking of that, I decided that something had to be done. Now that I was looking at her, she wasn’t even aware my gaze. She kept her frosty expression, but it struck me as sad.\n‘If I thing of her end in the novel…’\nMaybe this was a chance. My last chance to rehabilitate her, this villainess. If I rehabilitate her, it can prevent all kinds of tragedies, even wars. Above all, in this romance fantasy novel, I was the fiance of a\nvillainess. Her actions could harm me too. I could either live in seclusion or break off the marriage, but… who could ever live quietly after possessing a character in a novel?\nSo I made a vow. I will try to change her. I will change her…her evil-deed and her rude mouth. If I build up affection for her little by little and care for her, I’m sure that I will be able to change her.\nAnd then, six months passed.\nAs I expected, many things had changed.\nHowever, it was me who was changed by her, not her.\n* * *\n‘What, you’re going to change her by caring for her?’\nSay something that makes sense! How much effort did the fiancé had already made in the novel? Her parents, the Duke and Duchess, must have made great efforts for this cause as well. But instead of changing for the better, her words and actions got worse day by day.\n“Eran, you look like a squid again today.”\n“I see.”\n“No, now that I look at you again, even the evaluation of you looking like a squid seems to be an understatement.”\nObjectively, my face was very handsome. There were a lot of letters piled up in my room, I mean neatly.\n‘I’m going to lose my mind…’\nThere was no evil without a cause. I often repeated these words in my mind. Then, why was her words and actions getting worse and worse? She was neither abused nor discriminated against. It’s not that she didn’t receive the love of her parents. There was no way that a Duke’s daughter had any financial problems.\n‘In that case…’\nMaybe all this care, on the contrary, had harmed her. It was only natural that even young children would be scolded if they do something wrong.\nBut the villainess, Shael Azbel, was not. Let’s think about Shael’s situation. She was the daughter of a Duke. There were very few people who could criticize her personally in the first place. And the Dukal couple? They were pure in heart. The number of times they were angry with Shael in the first place could be counted on one hand.\nHer fiance? It was well known that the fiancé before the possession also took care of Shael.\nThe same goes for the “me” now, even though I’ve heard all sorts of harsh things. And, I can’t even think of any other people. Therefore, no one can scold the wicked Shael Azbel.\nIn other words, Shael was a girl who had never gotten a proper scolding.\n“Ah, the sword you gave me, but it seemed useless to me, so I threw it away on the street.”\n“…”\nShe threw away the present on the street. Actions and rude words that should not be done to the person who gave the gift. Even with such actions and words, everyone would only say warm words, far from reprimanding her.\nThen what should I do? I came up with a simple solution to this problem. I just need to play that role. It was a solution that could very well get me in trouble. It might be a choice that I would regret. But I couldn’t stand it any longer. Because it reminded me of all the things I’ve been through the few months.\n“Your hair is not the same as it used to be. Could it be that you are losing hair?”\nJust then, the wicked woman started being rude again. Mentioning “hair loss” is crossing the line. Even if it was true, the cause must be you. I took a deep breath and waited for the time to punish the wicked woman. Soon the opportunity came.\n“Are you washing your hair properly?”\n“Shut up, you bit*ch.”\n“…?”\nHer expression became incredulous at my words.\n‘Yes, it should be like this. Because I’ve been patient every time until now. Yes, I’ve endured it. It was a really tough time. But not from now on…’\n“What… what?”\n“Stop barking like a dog…” I said. “Could it be that your ears have been blocked? I should be able to dig them out with my skillful swordsmanship.”\n“…”\nShe replied with silence. Seeing the wicked woman’s puzzled expression, it seems that all my suffering so far has been compensated.\n“What, what!”\n“Oh, shut up.”\n“…”\nRehabilitate the villainess. It’s a vow I had made before. I will reach that difficult goal no matter what!\nThere is only one way to rehabilitate the wicked woman.\nIf the wicked woman is being rude, give her a proper scolding!\nGoblin:\nPlease whitelist this site in your a*blocker to support the translation.

      "content": "The wicked woman Shael Azbel looked at me. There was bewilderment in her eyes. I felt sorry for her for some reason, and I laughed.\nThen she spoke to me.\n“Why are you laughing all of a sudden? Rather, you should explain what the hell is with the remark you just made.”\n“What…? It makes me feel better when you look at me like that.”\n“…”\nNow Shael Azbel looked at me like I’m crazy. Of course, it wasn’t really because I was crazy that I felt good. It had a reason of its own. It wasn’t like the only thing I had endured was all kinds of bullying and cold gaze from this woman. However, when I threw away my patience and poured out my rage, her embarrassed look made me feel a lot better than before.\nThat look on her face made me feel really good. Maybe, it was the villainess that changed me. Maybe because I was the fiancé of the villainess, even I have become a villain with a strange personality. What made me feel that this was so absurd was the ridicule that she was directing at me.\n‘What the hell have I been doing all this time?’\nI have had many of such thoughts because all my efforts seem to have been in vain.\nLooking ahead, Shael’s expression was changing in real time. Her embarrassment was gradually turning to anger, but…\n’you deserve all that.’\nThat’s right, you should have done well when I was good. I put in a lot of effort. It wasn’t just that I tried to put up with her words and actions. I thought back to the very difficult past. It had been six months since I had possessed a character in a novel. It was a very painful time. If one day she opened up to me and became a good person, then I would not feel this miserable. All my great efforts ended up in vain.\nIn order to maintain the body I possessed, I had to spend every day exhausted from exercise. It was the same for my swordsmanship. It was fantasy world. Despite a world full of all kinds of mysterious potions,\nwounds covered my body every day. It was psychologically taxing when she ridiculed me for such a wound.\nI also learned magic. It’s only been six months since I came to this world, but I had gained the confidence that I wouldn’t lose in a fight with anyone my age. It was true that this body had great talent for all sorts of things. However, this was only possible because my efforts were also enormous.\nThat wasn’t all!\nI absorbed all kinds of knowledge like a sponge. I came from a completely different world, and the journey to acquire knowledge of completely different things was very long. I made those efforts for me to live well, but most of them were for her sake.\nThat made things even more bitter. The thing that scratched my heart was the words of the villainess who complained out of bewilderment.\n“That’s ridiculous, Eran.”\n“Is that so? Me too.”\n“If you ask for forgiveness right now, I’ll take care of it.”\n“Forgiveness?”\nShael demands for me to ask for forgiveness. Of course, I wouldn’t do that. Rather, it was she who should ask for my forgiveness.\n“Are you sure you won’t regret it?”\nThe meaning behind the question was simple. If I don’t ask for forgiveness right away, she will cause great damage to me. Let’s calculate possibilities. Will I be in danger if I don’t ask for forgiveness?\n‘Not at all.’\nMore than anything, I was convinced that if I give in to her here, I wouldn’t be able to change her. Trying to change her halfheartedly could do more harm than good. So what came out was a quick answer.\n“You don’t have to worry about it.”\n“Ha. No more chances.”\nShael Azbel sighed. Maybe it was a sigh she let out because she thought the person she was going to bully would disappear. She stood up straight away. The sound of a chair scratching the floor was heard in the room as Shael stood up. Considering that it was something she didn’t normally do, you could see how flustered she was.\nNext, it was the sound of my chair.\n“Don’t follow me.”\n“Don’t follow me. This hurt me a quite a lot as your fiancé.”\n“Why are you doing this?”\n“I’m worried about even a brief separation, Shael.”\nShael told me not to follow her. Still, it would not be proper for me to not follow her as she was my fiancé. Of course, I ignored her words and still followed her. After leaving Shael’s large room, we went upstairs. I had never been upstairs before. In the center of the upper floor, I could see a room larger than Shael’s.\nAs expected, this was the room of the Duke and Duchess of Azbel. It was the room of the head of household, Jespen, and his wife, Enella.\nShael knocked on the room.\nKnock-tock-!\nA rather violent knock for a duke’s daughter. Seeing this, I became even more sure that I did a good job.\nShael was not afraid of her own parents at all. From one perspective, it didn’t seem like much of a problem, but it was really not the case. Sometimes, scary parents were model parents. Otherwise, it would be difficult to correct a child who was going down a wrong path. Moreover, Shael was walking down an extremely wrong path, the path of becoming a cruel villainess.\nWhen Shael knocked on the door, the head of the household, Jespen Azbel, and his wife, Enella Azbel, came out.\nThe patriarch of the Azbel family, known for his magic, had the same hair color as Shael. It was sky blue hair, and the sky blue eyes were the same.\nI could tell at once that the mistress of the household, Enella Azbel, was Shael’s mother. The two of them looked so similar. But why couldn’t she inherit her kind personality? While thinking about that, the duke said to Shael.\n“Shael? Is something wrong?”\n“Father! I think he’s finally gone crazy. He suddenly cursed at me!”\n“Is that true, Eran Baslett?”\nHe didn’t even listen to his daughter properly and asked me. Aside from not scolding his daughter, wasn’t it very bad that he unconditionally believed Shael’s nonsense.\n“No. However… I could have made a mistake while talking with Shael, so I would be grateful if Shael could tell me what she was dissatisfied about.”\n“Obviously! You called me a bit*ch and a dog!”\nAt Shael’s words, the Duke made an absurd expression. Then he sighed and said.\n“Shael. Just stop it. Eran, I’m sorry my daughter is acting so rude.”\n“No, it’s okay. For Shael, this could be one of her expressions of affection.”\n“Hah? No!”\nThen the head of the household, Enella, spoke.\n“Shael. It’s very unbecoming.”\n“…”\nI don’t know if this was a scolding, but… it was something Shael heard from Enella, her mother, almost for the first time. Even the duke and his wife, who always said only nice things to Shael, couldn’t praise her for this.\n‘That’s right, you should have done well from the beginning. With my previous reputation as a proper noble. Did you really think that the Duke would believe that?’\nWith an unfair expression on her face, she headed back to her room. I too followed Shael into her room. This time it was the same sound of a chair scratching the floor. Of course, the intensity was stronger than before. I could see how angry she was.\n“Are you a dog?”\nAs if seeking revenge, Shael glared at me and said that.\nI raised my eyebrows at the wicked woman’s words.\n“Why are you smiling?”\nOf course, laughter would come out in funny situations. No matter how much I thought about it, it really was a good decision to pour my frustrations on the wicked woman.\n“Thank you for the compliment. We are a fitting pair.”\n“Ha, what… What?”\n“A bi*tch for a dog. What a fitting pair.”\nThis time she made an expression as if she had given up. She turned her head away as if she didn’t intend to talk to me. So I said.\n“Oh, seeing that you remain silent, it seems that you don’t dislike it.”\n“No, no. I don’t like it! You, get out of my room right now!”\nUsually, I am the one who wished for out meetings to end. But now, I somehow find it amusing that my words are bothering her.\nThat’s right. She only committed one-sided misdeeds, and she’s never had anyone who would talk back. There must have been only people around her who would act like a fool if she called them stupid, and act like a weakling if she called them weak.\nI have also been like that. But not anymore! If she calls me stupid, I’ll show her that I am a genius. If she calls me weak, I will make sure to show her how strong I am. Plus, it’s a lot of fun teasing her who’s never had her words disapproved.\nI do feel a little guilty about it, but… well, it’s for my plan to rehabilitate her, so it’ll be fine. Shael needs to suffer. Until she’s been hurt, she wouldn’t know what she’s doing wrong. Above all, it’s also for the sake of all I have been through. This is part of her rehabilitative process, with a bit of revenge mixed with fun.\n“We’re already having a lover’s quarrel. It seems like our relationship has grown closer.”\n“…”\nShael took a deep breath and fell silent. This time she didn’t even glare at me, and lay down on her table, then said,\n“You’re the worst…”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes!”\n“But so what… Isn’t there a saying that we were fated for each other?”\n“⋯.”\nWhen I said that, she glared at me as if it were unfair.\n‘That right, isn’t it?’\nCertainly we were fated for each other.\nA bit*ch and a dog.\nGoblin:\nPlease whitelist this site in your a*blocker to support the translation.

      "content": "My day starts with exercise. I also train in all kinds of swordsmanship and develops physical strength. It includes a very hard sparring session. Once I relax my body through some light exercise, the next step is magic. I learn useful magic in everyday life, like healing magic, as well as combat magic.\nNo matter how high a status I possess as the son of a Duke, this personal power itself will be indispensable someday. The last thing I do is study. I gather various knowledge to survive in this romantic fantasy novel. I had already finished reading several books. However, there was something rather unique about this particular book. It was a book called “Ways to Please a Noble Lady”.\nThis was a book that I had bought and read for my fiancée, the villainess, Shael Azbel. As a habit, I open the book. It said, [In order to please a noble lady, devote endless devotion. Then she will open up.]\nBut, did this work for Shael?\nNot at all. Reading this book was a mistake in the first place. Because she was not a noble lady, but rather a vicious villainess. While I was thinking that, I picked up another book.\n“999 Ways to Bully the Villainess”\nI didn’t know why this book existed.\n‘No, is it okay to publish a book like this in the first place?’\nStill, after giving it a thorough read, I found that it was indeed a good book. I was also able to find something that might be helpful. Anyway, this was a phrase that could be useful today.\n[When a villainess does something embarrassing, hurt her pride.]\nWhile thinking about these words, I headed to meet the wicked woman.\n***\nThe next thing after reading was the meeting with the evil woman. Across from me was Shael, looking at me with her wide eyes. Until this point, it was as usual. What would come next, was me using my heart and soul in order to please her. That too used to be one of my daily routines.\nBut not anymore.\nKhrudd!\nShe put the teacup down forcefully. It seemed to express that she didn’t like it. Because as she did that, she was staring at me at the same time. Usually, this would have been overlooked. Of course, now I couldn’t lose either.\nKhruddd!!!\nIt was such a loud sound that I doubted if it was the sound of putting the teacup down. If the sound earlier came from her teacup, this time it was mine.\n“I’ve won.”\n“…”\nThe wicked woman had strong pride. In other words, she would never be satisfied of the situation where she was losing. Even if it was a strange confrontation like this.\nSo the wicked woman raised the teacup again. This time it wasn’t for drinking.\nThen she knocked the teacup down.\nTaaagh! Taaagh!!\nIt was the sound of my teacup that immediately followed the sound of her teacup. The sound of her teacup was drowned out by the sound of mine.\n“Ahhh!”\nVoice of the villainess also followed soon after.\nYou might think that her voice stemmed from her frustration toward me, but not this time. Because the hot tea in her teacup had spilled onto her hands.\n“Ugh…”\nAh, the voice this time came did indeed from her frustration toward me. Yes, it was because I had defeated the villainess this time too.\n“Are you okay?”\nThe wicked woman immediately covered her hand and said.\n“It’s not okay!”\nAs I was about to get up thinking that maybe she had been burned, I heard another breaking sound.\nClang!!\nThis time it was the sound of her teacup. She did that not because of the burn, but because of her pride.\nBefore she could feel joy, she heard the sound of a teacup breaking again.\nClangg!!!\nIt was the sound of the teacup I threw. Of course, a teacup could not withstand such an impact.\n“…”\n“…”\nAnd then a moment of silence.\nHer silence was caused by the feeling of losing right after winning, and my silence was caused by this absurd situation. However, this silence was broken immediately. Because a few maids had come running into the room.\n“Ah, My Lady! What happened?!”\nThe maids immediately stopped enquiring about Shael’s safety. It was because they had finished their assessment of the situation after seeing the broken teacup in front of Shael.\nOne of the maids quickly spoke as she cleaned up the broken pieced of the teacup.\n“Call the healer now!”\nAs expected, she was the treasure of the Duke’s family. Even though she said nothing, the maid called for a healer.\n“No, I’m not hurt, so no need to call the healer. Leave!”\nIt was Shael who stopped the maids. She had a very frosty look, just like when she looked at me in the past. But Shael suddenly spoke up as if she had a good idea.\n“No. Don’t leave. Stay here.”\nAt the completely unexpected order, the maids had no choice but to wait.\nShael looked at me. This time, it was different from usual, in that she didn’t show a cold expression, nor an unfair expression, or even a resentful expression. But she grinned and just looked at me.\nIt was as if she was telling me she had beaten me.\n“Huh. I guess you’ll have to stay quiet now, Eran.”\nAha, she must have thought that I wouldn’t be able to talk back in front of the maids. Certainly, this was a bit troublesome. If I did such a reckless act like harassing the wicked woman in front of the maids, I would see blood. Nevertheless, I kept smiling.\nThat’s right, only bullying was impossible. However, it was possible to express affection. Because we were also betrothed.\n“Shael, you are beautiful today as well.”\n“What, you want to do that agai…”\nShe couldn’t help but swallow her words. It was because she had read the mood of the maids around her. One of the common interest amongst the maids was the story of love. This was natural. Most maids were at an age where they would dream of love.\nThe maids faces reddened and they focused their attention on Shael. It was as if they were eager to watch a good show.\n“…”\nThe wicked woman blushed. But she didn’t give in. Her desire to win was bigger than the shame.\nUnderstanding her feelings, I thought,\n‘If your desire to win is bigger than the shame… wouldn’t it be enough to make the shame bigger?’\nAnd then, I immediately went into action.\nI scooped the cake off the table and brought it to her mouth.\nOf course, there’s no way that self-respecting villainess would quietly accept this.\n“Oh, are you ashamed to eat in front of the maids?”\nIt wasn’t Shael who responded to my sentimental words. It was the maids.\nKyaaagh!\nUsually, the maids wouldn’t dare to make such noises in front of the wicked woman, Shael. But the maids couldn’t stand it because the two people in front of them looked so much like the two main characters in a romance novel.\nShael still remained silent in this situation. However, her reddened face represented her feelings.\n‘Eh, you still won’t make the maids leave?’\nAnd so, in order to increase the intensity of the shame, I got up and approached Shael.\n‘Ah, this time I will not only shame you, but I will also hurt your pride.’\nAs my face was barely touching her face, I whispered quietly into her ear.\n“So, you think you wouldn’t be able to defeat me without the help of the maids?”\n“…”\n“As expected, you’re a coward. Ah, I understand. Ever since you were little, you couldn’t do anything without the maid, so you seek their help here as well.”\n“…”\nAs I stared at Shael, she said to her maid.\n“You may leave.”\nThis was my victory again.\nIt really was as the book said. I pondered over what I had read again, [When a villainess does something embarrassing, hurt her pride.]\nIt was because the wicked woman had strong pride.\n***\nShael felt very angry. It was unfortunate that she had lost, but what was even worse that her hands had burns and she got scratches from the teacup. It was a serious matter to have a scar on her body, who was the treasured daughter of the Duke’s family. So the number of times she had been wounded could be counted on one hand. Even if it was an imperceptible scratch.\nOf course, that wasn’t the reason why Shael was unhappy about her scar. If she was wounded, she could apply a little potion. In the first place, there are many excellent healers in the Duke’s family.\nBut she thought otherwise. Even her imperceptible scars would be considered differently than others. Because they would treat her small wound as if it were a big scar. For example, even the maids who saw the broken teacup called for a healer. So when she usually gets hurt, she doesn’t tell anyone and hides it. Then she waits until it heals on it own.\nIt was like that a little while ago as well. She covered the wound so that her da*mn fiancé would never see it. As she stroked the place she was injured a moment ago, she couldn’t help but be surprised.\n“…”\nBecause the wound had completely disappeared. Such a short time had passed that it couldn’t have healed naturally. What immediately came to her mind was her own fiancé. Thinking back to it, when her fiancé whispered to her, she felt a warm feeling on her hand.\n“…”\nThe villainess Shael felt resentful.\nOnce again, it was because the wicked woman had strong pride.\nGoblin:\nPlease whitelist this site in your a*blocker to support the translation.

      "content": "The wicked Shael woke up. Sleep time was usually her favorite time… but it wasn’t this time. Because her da*mn fiancé appeared in her dream. That da*mn fiancé haunted her even in her dreams!\nAnd what made her even more resentful was that she couldn’t beat him even in her dreams. She felt that she was really so pitiful.\n“Haah…”\nThe problem was not only the dream. Thoughts about her fiancé often came to her mind even while going about her daily life.\n‘I even thought of him while eating!’\nOf course, it was never because she liked him. Rather, it was because she hated him so much. He was originally a person who she talked to as a way to vent her anger. However, two days ago, something went wrong. Yes, it was the day her fiancé called her a bi*tch and a dog.\nAt first, she was very surprised. She thought it was a mistake, and she questioned him again. Shael recalled the memories of that time.\n[“What… what?”\n“Stop barking like a dog…” He said. “Could it be that your ears have been blocked? I should be able to dig them out with my skillful swordsmanship.”]\nShe had no choice but to be silent. Of course, she immediately thought he would ask for forgiveness, then she would accept his forgiveness, and then, she intended to use it to torment him even more. Because there was no better target for venting her anger as well as that person. However, he showed a different reaction from the reaction he usually showed when he was bullied in the past.\nBy the way… he never begged for forgiveness. No, on the contrary, he proudly confronted her.\n[I should be able to dig them out with my skillful swordsmanship.] What kind of a concept is that?\nEverything changed after that. To the extent that she felt that Eran was just playing with her.\nNo, it was not just a feeling. It was clear that he was thinking of her as a toy. But the most amusing thing happened yesterday. She couldn’t even talk back, she just thought of Eran who whispered to her and the matter with the teacup.\n‘Why the hell did he come forward and secretly cast healing magic?’\nShe didn’t understand why he used healing magic in the first place, but even if he used healing magic, he could have teased and harassed her while doing it.\n‘So I can’t figure it out.’\n‘When I see my fiancé again, I will ask him why.’\n‘And I will bully him.’\n‘This time… I won’t lose.’\nWith that promise, Shael erased her thoughts about her fiancé. She stopped herself from constantly thinking about her fiancé and how she had lost to him. She somehow consciously tried to stop her thoughts regarding Eran.\nWhat hindered her resolution was the rumors spread out by her maids.\n***\n“What, Master Eran finally seduced the lady!?”\nIn a blind spot in the hallway, Shael heard something absurd.\nThe maids exchanged rumors like this in the mansion without fear in broad daylight. Originally, it was because it was time for Shael to be in her room. And what was even more absurd was the words that followed.\n“Yes, Master Eran scooped up the cake for her!”\n‘I swear, I never ate it.’\nShael felt embarrassed.\n“Master Eran even kissed her ear!”\nShe had never been kissed on the ear. He just whispered to her. When Shael tried to approach and scold the maids for spreading the strange rumors. It was her father, Duke Jespen Azbel, who came out of the\nblind spot on the other side. It was obvious how things would go now. The rumors of the maids would even reach Duke Jespen!\n“What, is that really true?”\n‘This is bad!’\nShael thought, as the maids exaggerated the rumors and informed Jespen.\n“Am I finally seeing my grandchildren?”\nJespen was impressed. He honestly didn’t like Shael’s personality… because she had been constantly being mean to Eran a lot of times. So he was very happy when he heard that rumor. He wanted to believe that the rumors were true.\nOf course, those rumors were never true. Because that never happened. And before Shael even could show up to deny it all, it was Eran Baslett who came out on the other side of the hallway.\nThen it was obvious what Jespen would say to Eran. He would ask him if Eran’s relationship with his daughter was going well. Shael believed Eran would deny it, and she had no doubts about that. But Eran Baslett, the culprit behind all of this and her enemy, gave a strange answer.\n“Oh, that’s right.”\nShael almost passed out. Because her fu*king fiancé spit out lies! She approached them while trembling with anger, only to see Eran sneering at her. Next was Jespen, who looked at her proudly, and the maids who were trembling in fear.\nShael thought,\n‘What should I do to get out of that misunderstanding?’\n‘No.’\nShael then thought.\n‘Can I really escape the misunderstanding?’\nThere was no way out of it. If she denied it, rumors would circulate even more exaggeratedly that she was ashamed to admit her relationship with Eran. So she chose silence. Part of the reason was that she didn’t want Eran to enjoy her misery. Her own misfortune was better than Eran’s happiness. Above all, so what if that kind of rumor spread? Eran hated her, and she hated Eran too.\nBecause now he had also endured the pain and affirmed the rumors in order to make fun of her.\n‘It’s a reasonable choice in its own way.’\nShael thought.\nHowever, the problem was that the rumor actually spread as if it were true.\n***\nI looked at Shael. After hearing such rumors, she just stayed still. The situation unfolded in an atmosphere in which she seemed to admit that what I said was true.\n‘No way, I didn’t expect you to answer with silence!’\nThen, it was not surprising that Duke Jespen confirmed this rumor to be true. It was the same with the maids. Perhaps, the rumors would grow bigger and bigger day by day.\nDuke Jespen immediately left Shael and me in Shael’s room and left. It was as if he wanted us to be alone.\nThe now familiar sound of a chair scratching the floor was heard again. It was sound I got to hear quite a lot these days. She must be suffering quite a lot.\n“Why the hell did you answer with silence there?”\n“…”\nShael answered with silence this time as well.\n“Did you really want us to be lovers?”\n“I guess that make sense!”\n“…”\nOriginally, she was looking at me with a strange expression, but now it was the opposite. Because now, I was staring at her with her bewildered expression.\n“I regret it, and it was an annoying mistake, so please don’t mention it in the future.”\n“Right, well…”\nOf course, I will mention it. I will mention it it tomorrow or a month from now on. And, the following year too. I mean, how could I not? I just got the perfect material to bully you.\n“So, what the hell was that yesterday?”\n“What are you talking about?”\n“My hand.”\nAh, I think she is talking about the time when I used healing magic on her hand.\n“I didn’t do it.”\nOf course, I lied.\n“Don’t lie to me. I’m from the Azbel family, a family famous for magic.”\n“How do I prove that I am not lying?”\n“…”\nShe was a wicked woman who blushed in shame because I was denying her claim. Now, she must be doubting her own claim as well. Now that I think about it again, actually, although she belonged to the Azbel family, she couldn’t even use magic that well. Because the villainess was also lazy. So, I spoke with the intention of making fun of her.\n“Yes, that’s what I did.”\n“Ha, that’s right. I knew it would be like this.”\n“That was a lie.”\n“…”\nShael glared at me. So, I admitted it again before the villainess got really mad.\n“Yes, I did that.”\nShael looked at me as I played with words and let out a deep sigh and said.\n“So, why the hell did you treat me?”\n“How can I let my fiancé be hurt?”\n“But you think it is alright to curse at your fiancé, calling her a dog and bi*tch?”\nOf course there was nothing I could say about that. But she was a villainess, did she not think about what she has been doing? Anyway, the villainess was selfish.\n“Isn’t it okay since it’s the truth?”\nIn other words, she was a real bit*ch, so it was okey to call her that.\n“I really hate you.”\n“Is that so?”\nShael glared at me again. Haah…it was a weapon I was going to use tomorrow, but I guess it can’t be helped now.\n“But, well… I don’t think you really hate me, seeing as you didn’t deny rumors that the two of us are finally in love.”\n“…”\n“By the way, there is no one in the duchy who doesn’t know about the rumors anymore.”\nNow Shael glared at me as if she was going to kill me. Then, she said with a look on her face as if she knew what was going on.\n“Heh, but it was you who affirmed those rumors first, so didn’t you hate me as well?”\nThe villainess counterattacked. She did know many ways to attack. And, it was a pretty good attack. However, the problem was that her opponent was me. The me who had already faced her attacks thousands of times.\n“There is a saying that married couples are of one mind. And, we are indeed engaged…”\n“What nonsense are you speaking, suddenly…”\nSo, my thought was the same as hers.\n“I mean that, I hate you too.”\nIt was a counterattack countering a counterattack.\nGoblin:\nPlease whitelist this site in your a*blocker to support the translation.

      "content": "We confirmed each other’s feelings.\nOf course, it was clear that the feeling in our hearts was not love, but hate, and it was not something any two fiancés would normally share. And now, we were staring intensely at each other. It was a look that would make anyone misunderstand. However, in this case, the stares were somewhat unique in that they did not express love, but contempt.\nShe glared at me. I also glared at her.\n“Is this a rematch after that thing with the teacup?”\n“…”\nShe answered my question with her persistent stare. Of course, it was also my gaze that answered her gaze again.\nIt was a very strange relationship. The two fiancés competed over sound they could make with teacups, and now they were having a staring contest. I didn’t know that I would possess a character in a novel and do childish things like this with a villainess. Perhaps even young couples had never looked at each other as passionately as we were doing now.\nWe continued to stare at each other like that without saying a word. Some time passed. Eventually, my eyes began to hurt. I am sure that was the same for Shael. Still, the sore eyes didn’t matter to Shael and me. Because there was something more important. The important thing was to win, and the reward was the opponent’s resentment. It would be such a sweet reward. So I couldn’t give up!\n“Why don’t you just give up?”\n“That’s what I want to say!”\nI said it, and the villainess answered. But neither of us gave up.\nTime passed again. The tea I was drinking lost its heat and cooled down. Now I had worked my eyes so hard that I had tears in my eyes. I was thinking that it would be nice if the other person quit. But there was\nno way anyone would give up.\nAs the cool tea was getting cold. Tears began to flow from Shael’s eyes. What was strange was that it was the first time I had seen the devil’s tears. Of course, even though the reason for the tears was somewhat peculiar.\n“To make a lady cry, what a mean man I am.”\n“Even your… tears are flowing.”\n“Is that so…?”\nIt might look a bit funny. Two twenty-year-old men and women were crying while having a staring contest.\nMy eyes were half closed now. Of course, the villainess was still staring at me with her eyes wide open. As expected, the villainess we indeed poisonous.\n“Open your eyes fully.”\n“…”\n“Or, you lose.”\nThat’s what the villainess told me. I couldn’t help but open my eyes completely again. Now my eyes were stinging. Even though we were already in tears. Then silence reigned. Because I couldn’t afford to concentrate on talking. I just endured while imagining a future where I would harass the villainess.\nKnock-tock-tock!\nWhat ended the silence was the sound of someone knocking on the door.\n“Come in.”\nThat’s what I said. Because the villainess was paying all her attention to the staring contest. Then the maids came in. It was for more dessert, which was nothing out of the ordinary.\nIt’s just… the maids’s expressions were different from usual. Because they saw something.\n“…!!!”\nThe silent clamor of the maids began as soon as they saw Shael’s tears.\nAh, Shael had never shed a tear. The tears of the villainess were hard to see and very precious. Of course, there was no way a villainess would easily show tears to others.\nOf course, now it had become cheap tears that could only be seen in a stupid staring contest.\nThe maids went out with quick steps. It was a look that made me want to smirk right away. Tomorrow, everyone in the ducal family would know of this.\n“Now rumors will circulate that you shed tears to hold me back, Shael.”\n“…”\nThe villainess still didn’t answer. It wasn’t because of the rumors that were going to spread. It was because the fight was still going on, while shedding tears. Is this really the vicious villainess in the novel, or is it because of my mood that I’m thinking like that\nWhat disrupted my thoughts were the desserts brought by the maids. It wasn’t because it looked delicious, but because something strange was in it.\nMy search magic had detected poison.\nLooking at things like this, she was definitely a villainess. To try to poison me at home by poisoning the food.\nIf you think about it, not only the protagonists in novels have to face trials. The villainess, Shael, also had to face many trials.\nOf course, the book didn’t give the content that much importance. In the first place, this was before the original work even started. In the novel, the villainess’s past was not properly dealt with.\nThat’s why the book only mentioned things like the villainess, Shael also had to face this and that, but dealt with it alone like a vicious villainess.\nIn the original work, the villainess must have avoided this poisoning in some way. It was highly likely that the method she used was poison detection magic like I did just now.\nBut what do I do now?\nIf I didn’t get rid of this dessert, Shael could be found dead tomorrow.\nUnlike in the original work, I will have to intervene. Furthermore, since I was the fiancé of the villainess, her death would have great influence on me as well. Perhaps the villainess in the novel sensed this through magic like me, but… not now.\nShe didn’t know how to use any magic. I even heard the Duke Jespen himself say that she had never been taught any magic. Then it was clear what I had to do. It was to prevent poisoning and eliminate the culprit.\nI’m trying hard to rehabilitate the villainess.\n‘So I can’t let this go.’\nI immediately brought the dessert in front of the villainess to me, and I had to close my two sore eyes.\n“It’s my win!”\nOf course, she was a villainess who was still pursuing her own victory.\n“Yes, it is.”\n“…”\nAs expected, it was time for the villainess to curse at me. But my expectations were wrong. She just asked me in a questioning tone.\n“Why did you take that?”\n“Oh, because it looks delicious.”\n“…”\nShael stared at me in bewilderment.\nTo take someone else’s dessert just because it looked delicious? It was surely an inelegant act that even a villainess wouldn’t do. Normally, she would have begun to insult me by now, but the villainess just stared at me. But why was the villainess not doing anything? It wasn’t the time for me to think about that.\nIt was natural. It was because I had to find out who was trying to kill the vicious villainess with poison. Once I find them, I would have to decide what to do with them.\n“I’m going somewhere for a moment.”\nI held the poisoned dessert in my hand. Then got up from my seat.\nDrrr!\nAs expected, the sound of the chair showed how hurried I was.\n***\nShael saw the dessert. It was the dessert the maids put in front of her. It was something she always enjoyed.\nIt’s just she felt something strange. It was through poison search magic.\nIt was the only magic that she had learned on her own. Because for her, learning magic was something annoying. She used to think that it wasn’t necessary for her to learn magic in order to survive. But she had no choice but to wake up.\nIt was because she had already eaten poisoned food several times.\nApart from the perpetrators, no one in the duchy knew about that.\nIt was because she overcame it alone. Even the poison was the same for Shael, who did not report her wounds and hid them. The terrible villainess did not tell others about her own suffering.\nAt first it was a weak poison. Of course, it was enough poison to kill a person. But she overcame it. As she endured her pain, she secretly took all sorts of medicines.\nThe reason she was able to hide her pain without revealing it was probably because she was a villainess who was more toxic than that poison. And she finally apprehended the criminal. Of course she didn’t get help from anyone here either. It wasn’t something hard for the villainess to chase away a weak maid.\nAfter that, there were several attempts. Of course, the villainess was more poisonous than those poisons. She overcame all poisons. After being poisoned so many times, she learned the poison detection magic herself.\nIn a way, it was natural. Because she also had the Azbel family’s blood flowing through her veins.\nSo when Eran took her dessert, she was really surprised.\n‘Will you really eat it?’\nOf course not. Her fiancé also knew the poison detection magic. It wasn’t something unexpected that he, a master of swordsmanship, would this type of magic.\nThe only thing that surprised her was why Eran was helping her. Even though they said that they hated each other and even had a strange contest he was helping her.\nSo even though she beat him in the staring contest, she didn’t feel like she had won. It was the same last time. The same thing happened when the teacup broke. Even then, as she was fighting her strange contest with him, Eran healed her hand.\nWas it pity? It never was. It wasn’t because he liked her either.\nBut she couldn’t figure out why.\nSo it was inevitable that the villainess would secretly follow her fiancee.\nIt was because the villainess had to know.\nGoblin:\nI'm busy with my exams at the moment, hence the lack of a schedule.

      "content": "The Maid, Astin, was a faithful servant of the Azbel family.\nShe was proud to be the duke’s maid and she was very satisfied with her life. It was because the maids of the Azbel family received better treatment than expected. It was not just the staggering level of salary for commoners. The Azbel family, who were also famous for magic, provided various magic to their maids.\nThe most noteworthy of those magics were teleportation magic. Members of the Azbel family used teleportation magic even to go to work. It was the same with the maids.\nThe mages of the family personally used teleportation magic. It was for the reason of safety. Azbel was a family famous for magic, but it was also a family that had garnered a lot of grudges. There was a chance that someone would take one of the maids family members hostage and cause damage to someone in the Azbel family.\nSo the maids were under contract magic that made them unable to even reveal that they were the maids of the Azbel family. Even so, they weren’t offended by this. Rather, it gave them a sense of security in being able to guarantee the safety of themselves and their family.\nIn fact, the Azbel family guaranteed the safety of both the maids and their families in the contract itself.\nThe maid, Astin, was also someone like that. She was able to ensure the safety of her only family, her sister, Estill, by the Azbel family.\nOne day, after doing her work as usual. It was time to finish her work as Astin, the maid of the Azbel family and become Astin, the only family member of Estill.\n“Estill?”\nHowever, the atmosphere, quite different from usual, felt dreary and cold.\nHer one and only sister had disappeared.\nShe immediately went through her room. What caught her eye was a letter.\n[Feed Shael Azbel this poison. The green one is poison, and the blue one is the antidote.]\nIt was a letter telling her to poison her young lady, Shael.\nIt instructed her to mix the poison in the a dessert with a strong scent and give it to Shael when she and her fiancé, Eran would meet. There was even an antidote in case Eran accidentally ate the poison. It was for this reason she had to be extra vigilant.\nAstin stopped her thoughts. Because she couldn’t make up her mind. But before long, she made up her mind.\nFrom then on, things progressed naturally.\nShe made the dessert. Then she put poison in Shael’s dessert.\nShe tried her best to look natural when serving that dessert in front of Shael. And then, she saw something that shocked her. She saw Shael in tears! After seeing that vicious Shael shed tears, Astin had no choice but to come to her senses.\n‘Oh, what have I done!?’\nCome to think of it, rumors have been spreading lately that Shael and Eran had fallen in love with each other.\nIt was rumored that the kind and understanding Eran Baslett had captured the wicked woman, Shael Azbel. When Astin looked at Eran with a sad gaze and saw Shael crying, she had a complicated thought.\n‘Can I take away their happiness for my own happiness?’\n‘Never!’\nEven though Shael had been rude to her all the time. That was something different, but taking away their happiness before it even started had a different weight. So she took out the antidote and stood at the door. However, what she saw through the crack in the door was Eran Baslett standing up with the dessert.\n‘He noticed the poison.’\nRather this was even better! It was because the antidote might not have been effective.\n‘I will beg him to rescue my brother.’\nEran opened the door and looked at Astin. However, she couldn’t easily say something like that to Eran.\n“You’re the one who did this, right?”\n“Sorry, sorry!”\nEran began to walk forward. It meant that she had to follow him. Astin followed Eran.\nThe hallway, which she would normally walked through in a minute, felt too long for her.\nAfter that, the situation unfolded naturally.\nEran asked, Astin answered. She revealed the details of the incident.\n“Please, save my little brother! I’m really sorry!”\nThat was what she said while lowering her head. She also knelt down. Even then, she felt it wasn’t enough, so she pressed her forehead to the floor.\n“Stand up.”\nThat’s what Eran said in a slightly cold voice. Astin got up right away. Because she was overwhelmed. Then, what she saw was Eran, who looked like he was about to bend over.\n‘Ah, you’re trying to draw a sword…’\nAstin closed her eyes tightly.\n‘Still, I and my brother had been living a good life. However, I wan’t able to save my brother in the end.’\n‘Why is he taking so long? Could it be that even the sound of the sword of the one with the blood of a master swordsman was different?’\nOf course not.\nWhen Astin opened her eyes. She stiffened for a moment. Because she couldn’t believe her eyes.\nEran Baslett’s knee, which she thought he would use to kill her, was on the ground.\n“Why, why do you?”\n“I’m sorry.”\nSorry? What the hell are you sorry for?\n“The fact that the location of the Azbel family’s maids was exposed… means that there was a spy in the Azbel family.”\n“That’s why…”\n“The Azbel family’s fault is also my fault. And… you’ve been under the mental confusion spell all this time.”\nAstin couldn’t understand. Of course, according to Azbel family’s contract, they guaranteed the safety of Astin’s family. However, the weight of Eran’s knee touching the ground and the life of Astin, a commoner, were different.\nHe said that she was under a mental confusion spell? Certainly, attempting to poison her lady was not a decision that would normally be so easy. However, a nobleman was not someone that should easily bend their knees. Above all, Astin tried to kill Shael.\nThe reason didn’t matter. If she tried to kill a noble, she must die no matter the reason. Because that was the principle. So Astin couldn’t believe it at all.\n“Your brother… I’ll save him somehow.”\n“…”\nShe couldn’t help but shed tears. Because she regretted trying to take away the happiness of such a person. In the rush to think only of her own circumstances, she almost made a selfish choice. No matter how strange the magic was, it couldn’t change what she had done.\nIt was then that Astin’s tears stopped. Because another sound was heard.\nKikiiik…\nLight blue hair. And the sky-blue eyes that looked at Eran and turned to her.\nShael Azbel looked at her and walked close. Now, she didn’t even say a word.\nAstin lowered her head. It was because she tried to poison Shael. She couldn’t bear to meet those two eyes confidently. Still, she had to lift her head up again. Because a situation similar to that of just now was happening again.\nAstin doubted her eyes. It was the same with Eran next to Shael. The wicked woman, Shael, bowed her head toward her.\n“I apologize for the Azbel family’s mistakes. I won’t hold you accountable for the poison.”\nIt was a completely incomprehensible situation.\nIt was Shael, the only daughter of a duke. Her head should not bow to a commoner. Because she was the woman who would carry everything in the duchy.\nSo Astin froze while standing still.\n***\nAfter following Eran, Shael saw a maid exchanging words with him.\nShe…\nShe was the maid who tried to poison her. She was also a maid who she had harassed. Shael listened to what her maid said without missing anything. Of course, she had no sympathy for her maid, Astin.\nShe tried to poison her. Then only outcome was death. It had been like that so far, and it will be so in the future.\nBecause your family was taken hostage? You were under a mental confusion spell? Those things were not valid reasons.\nWhat was the important thing was that she tried to kill her.\nThen she saw Eran bend his knee.\n‘Why on earth?’\nShael couldn't understand. From start to finish, she couldn’t understand the actions of her own fiancé.\nJust because he forgave her, does he think she will forgive her as well?\n‘Absolutely not!’\nShe opened the door. Because it occurred to her that she should punish that maid. And when she stood beside Eran on her knees. She couldn’t speak anything bad at all.\nOddly enough, her head was already down. And she was already apologizing to her maid.\nYes, this was because of her fiancé.\nBecause she felt defeated by her fiancé, who was on his knees apologizing on her behalf.\nWhen Eran was surprised to see her with her head down, she thought of something. It was the first time she saw Eran be surprised. But she had other doubts as well.\nNo matter how much she put her head down because of her dam*n fiance. The one she was bowing her head to was her maid. Normally, she would have been angry and left immediately.\n‘But why on earth do I not feel that way?’\nWas it because she finally began to accept her dam*n fiancé?\nThen, what kind of emotion was she feeling other than resentment? She didn’t know.\nThe villainess still didn’t know.\nGoblin:\nPlease whitelist this site in your a*blocker to support the translation.

      "content": "Shael and I reported this matter to our families.\nSomeone instigated to kill the bloodline of the duke, and a poor maid got caught up in it. The duke and duchess of the Azbel family, who loved their daughter, were furious. What happened next was obvious.\nTwo dukes move to find the person who touched the bloodline of the Azbel family. The Azbel family, famous for magic, and the Baslett family, famous for swordsmanship.\nIt was obvious that somehow they would catch the culprit. Because they were two dukes with power comparable to the imperial family.\nFor now, leaving the work to the two families, Shael and I were in Shael’s room as usual. However, it was a little different from usual. It was because there was a maid, Astin, with us. Astin shuddered at the strangely terrifying atmosphere.\n“It’s obvious that the Azbel family will find them first.”\nThat’s what the villainess told me. Of course, I couldn’t stay still. Even at this time, Astin was trembling as she shrank her body.\n“Isn’t it obvious that the Barsletts would find out first?”\n“It can’t be.”\n“…”\n“This is the Baslett family we are talking about, we are famous for our swordsmanship.”\n“The Azbel family is famous for magic too, right?”\nAstin stayed silent.\n‘Do I have to stay here?’\nThat is what she must be thinking.\nHowever, a crisis approached Astin, as the wicked woman made this docile sheep the scapegoat.\n“Astin, it’s only natural that the Azbel family will catch them first, right?”\n“Ah, that’s right, isn’t it?”\nAstin looked at me and said.\nThat is too much! If you ask the maid of the Azbel family about such a thing, it’s obvious that she would give you a positive answer. Even if she didn’t have a sense of belonging, no one would give a negative answer in front of their boss. Moreover, that boss was a villainess with a bad personality. Even with such a clear answer, the villainess was not satisfied.\n“I’m sure it is, heh. But, that’s not an answer I’m satisfied with, Astin!”\n“Hikk!”\nThe villainess glared at Astin as she talked like that. She caused Astin in too much trouble even after apologizing to her. Well, there’s no way the villainess would care about such things. She, was indeed, a wicked woman.\nShael demanded a definite answer from Astin, but…\nBut, of course, there was no way she could give a definitive answer. Because the blood of the Barslett family was looking at her as well. Astin, who was in a difficult position, shuddered at her misfortune.\nIt must be very difficult to be caught between two nobles. Moreover, it must have been even more shocking to Astin, who would have thought that Shael and I were affectionate, and would express only love.\nEven the safety of her brother could be in danger.\nBut, it didn’t matter to the villainess. The only thing that mattered to the villainess was to defeat me.\n“Astin.”\n“Yes, yes?!”\nThe wicked woman urged for the answer. At the words that were colder than before, Astin responded with a fright. However, it was me who saved Astin from a situation where she was about to cry.\n“Astin, go out.”\n“Yes..yes!”\nAstin stood up as if she had been liberated. She then hurriedly greeted us and ran out.\n“Why did you make her leave?”\n“If you ask such a question to the maid of the Azbel family, you will get an obvious answer.”\n“Are you afraid of losing?”\n“It’s not like that.”\n“It looks like that to me.”\nThe wicked woman laughed at me. So I asked her,\n“But, since when did you start to like Azbel?”\n“Since I thought I could beat you.”\nThe wicked woman gave an absurd answer. She didn’t say that she liked her from the beginning, but that she suddenly liked her because she thought she could beat me.\n“Haah, that’s absurd.”\n“Are you sighing in front of me right now?”\nNow she glared at me. But the snowball fight never started. Because there were strange rumors going around.\nThe rumor was about Shael, the villainess, who was seen crying while looking at me. By the time rumors started to circulate, it was also rumored that I, her fiancé, was very upset when she was almost killed by poison.\nThat’s why it was rumored that the Azbel family and the Baslett family moved together. If such rumors circulated, it was clear how the story would play out. It was thought that Shael and I have a relationship where we can’t live without each other, that we’re longing for love. That was what everyone in the ducal family was expecting.\nOf course, that was not the truth.\nThe villainess who gave up the snowball fight asked me a question.\n“Why the hell did you get down on your knees?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“You did something so outrageous, but you don’t know why?”\nI didn’t know what to answer, so I came up with an answer. Which was countering her with another question.\n“Then why did you bow your head too?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“It’s the same for me.”\n“…”\nA fitting counterattack. However, unexpectedly, Shael didn’t glare at me.\nMaybe she was really just thinking about the reason.\nIt wasn’t long before Shael spoke.\n“Why did I do that?”\n“How would I know about that?”\n“You’re really useless.”\nAh, now you’re glaring at me. It was the Shael as usual.\n“I can’t help you, and would you trust me more than yourself?”\n“That’s absurd.”\n“That’s what I want to say.”\n“Ha.”\nNow she had given up on the glare and didn’t even look at me.\nKnock-tock-\nWhat broke the brief confrontation was the sound of a knock.\nThere was only one reason to call us at this time. It was to inform us that the culprit who instigated Shael’s poisoning was finally caught.\n“Come in.”\n“Yes. The Baslett family has contacted us that the person who ordered the poisoning has been arrested.”\n“Okay, let’s go.”\nShael and I stood up right away.\n“Ah, the Barsletts caught the culprit. In the end, it’s my victory.”\n“Be quiet!”\nI’ll take this victory as a bonus.\n***\n“Estell!”\n“Oh, sister!”\nAstin hugged her brother.\nFortunately, Astin’s younger brother was unharmed. But it must have been very taxing on his mind, considering that he was just a little boy who had been taken hostage.\nThe man who committed the crime was tied up with ropes. Standing in front of the person was Shael and me.\nAt first, I wanted to stop Shael. It would not be good for her to see the execution. However, the wicked woman did not stop. Of course. There’s no way she would listen to my words.\nThe bound man saw us spoke up.\n“Kuh… kuh… to fail without being able to feed the poison… what a useless bit*ch!”\nI looked down and met his gaze. Even so, the eyes of the wicked man did not flinch. Rather, he looked at me as if he wanted to kill me.\nI could feel the pure evil in those eyes, with no sense of repentance. This guy just wanted to kill Shael for his own gain.\nIf the Azbel family fell into chaos, all kinds of criminals could run amok in the duchy. It was rather fortunate that he was like this. If he had a miserable reason for trying to kill Shael, I would have had to feel pity for him.\nShael… was looking at him with cold eyes. It was a gaze I would often see in the past. But after I began to retaliate, that gaze gradually became less frequent. People would feel the chill even from just looking at it.\nA wicked woman and a wicked man looked at each other. And the wicked man opened his mouth.\n“Kuh, keuhuh… you survived the poisoning like the terrible poisonous woman you are! You’re a woman who’s more poisonous!”\nEven at the last moment, he only spoke terrible words. Why the hell did this guy become such a villain?\nI couldn’t tell. It was too late to fix him, and he had committed too many sins. So, looking at this person, I thought of Shael’s future. Because Shael, who was the villainess in a romanic fantasy novel, would also face a similar fate like this. That Shael didn’t even admit her fault even in her last moments.\nYes. Just like this wicked man, she left only all kinds of curses as her will. So I had several thoughts. As much as she is the villainess, she is definitely rehabilitate.\n‘I will not let her meet such a tragic end.’\nI repeated that promise in my mind.\nThen Shael spoke.\n“That’s it? You have nothing more to say?”\n“You too. You will meet this same end. And say ugly words like me…”\nHe had nothing more to say about that.\n“Kill him. He’s not worth listening to anymore.”\nThese were the words of an infallible wicked woman. In her cold voice, there was deep disgust.\nWhat was visible behind was the sword of a knight, as the wicked woman punished the wicked man.\nAt this point, Shael looked very upset. In a way, it was natural to punish the person tried to kill her. It was also very natural to be unfeeling toward such a person. Even if she saw that miserable end.\nStill, I had a strange idea.\n‘Was it true that this wicked woman was angry only because he tried to kill her?’\nIt felt like there was a different reason. Come to think of it, she seemed more angry when she heard about her maid’s suffering than when she heard about her own poisoning.\nThere’s no way Shael, the villainess, would do that…\nWas she upset by the mental anguish her poor maid must had to suffer?\nOf course I couldn’t tell. Because the villainess was more poisonous than poison. If I tried to dive in that deadly poison, I would surely get hurt.\nI just hoped that the deadly poison would fade someday. In order to make that day a reality, what I had to do was somehow rehabilitate this villainess!\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Azbel family’s diligent maid, Astin, was finishing her work. At the moment, she was in the middle of her last work of the day, washing the windows. It was then that she found an open window. The window belonged to Shael Azbel’s room. So it was easy to tell who opened the window without even looking at it.\n“Lady?”\nWhat Astin saw was Shael, who had hid her face with a cloak. Shel was climbing through the window.\n“Uh, uh huh? Why are you doing that?”\n“Shh, be quiet!”\nShael, who made Astin quiet, looked around her and said.\n“Don’t tell anyone.”\n“Yes, yes?”\n“If you tell anyone, you’re fired.”\nAfter Shael said such threatening words, she confidently sneaked out of the duke’s mansion. No matter how many guards there was, it was possible for her to sneak out because the mansions size was very large.\nAstin was worried.\n‘Should I keep it secret as Lady Shael said?’\nHowever, it could put Shael in danger.\nThen she decided what she had to do. She went to meet Duke Jespen. Hearing the news, Duke Jespen called Eran, Shael’s fiancée.\n***\nA dark night, I was walking with the cold wind blowing on my body. My shivering body proved how cold the wind was.\nThe reason I had to walk around even in the cold was because of Shael.\n[Eran Baslett, my daughter sneaked out again.’]\nThat’s what Duke Jespen told me. So, the wicked woman went out in the middle of the night without the duke’s knowledge, and without any escort.\nShael was the blood of the Azbel family, which earned her a lot of resentment. Recently, she was almost poisoned. Thinking about that, I didn’t know what the hell the villainess was thinking when she went out alone.\nThen it was obvious what the duke, who loved his daughter to death, would ask me to do.\n[I want you to secretly follow her and protect her.]\nYeah, that was the command. It was a command that made me walk this late at night.\nSo I was following her and walking behind her. I was following her without even knowing whether it was just a casual walk or whether she had a destination. It was good that she was wearing a cloak that covered her face.\nI followed Shael as she left the ordinary road and began to walk along the flowery road. I didn’t understand why she choose to walk through the flower path. Surprisingly, the wicked woman liked pretty flowers!\nCome to think of it, there was a question I had asked her before.\n[Do you like flowers?]\n[Yes, I like it.]\nTo the question I managed to make up because I had nothing to say, she had answered insincerely. At the time, I thought that answer would be false. Was the villainess’ taste more normal than I thought? It was really surprising!\nAnd… of course, there was no way the villainess would be like that. She was just trampling the pretty flowers as she walked.\n‘Why are you stepping on innocent flowers?’\n‘Is the reason you like flowers… not because they are pretty, but because they are easy to trample on?’\nIt was a reason no one could even imagine. As expected, she was a villainess with a different way of thinking.\nThe wicked woman continued trampling the flowers, and I cast healing magic on the flowers and followed the wicked woman. Then the wicked woman suddenly stopped.\nTwitter..twitter…\nIt was because this time, she saw some little birds. Little birds were chirping cutely and walking around.\nShael was quietly watching the little birds.\nDid the villainess like cute birds? Will I discover the ordinary taste of the wicked woman this time?\nOf course, not this time either.\nThe wicked woman casually walked through the birds. The birds were frightened by her footsteps and flew away.\nFrood..deuk!\nShael continued her walk while appreciating the sound of the bird’s wings.\n“…”\nI couldn’t quite guess what she was doing. She trampled on flowers before, but now she did that to birds as well. It was the image of an infallible wicked woman.\nThe wicked woman stopped again. What else would she do? However this time there was nothing was in front of her. And, she suddenly looked behind her.\nShael was coming towards me. She had noticed me, so she came up to me and said,\n“Why are you following me?”\n“It was a coincidence.”\n“Ha, I noticed that you were following me earlier.”\n“I see.”\nThe wicked woman was better than I thought.\n“Don’t follow me anymore.”\n“How could I leave my fiancé alone?”\n“Haah.”\nShael began to walk again in silence. It was because she knew that there was no way I would give up. However, I couldn’t quietly follow Shael like that.\n“Where the hell are you going?”\n“It’s a secret.”\nAlthough she said it was a secret, she was still moving towards a destination. And, I would know eventually, as I was following Shael there. So I asked another question.\n“By the way… why did you trample the flower?”\n“Be quiet before I trample you too.”\nThe wicked woman spoke savagely, glaring at me.\n“You’ll have to be very careful while doing that.”\nThe villainess didn’t even listen to me and walked away.\n“Why did you do that to the cute birds?”\n“What did I do?”\n“Didn’t you walk through the birds?”\n“This is the Duchy of Azbel.”\nWhy did that information come out all of a sudden?\n“I own the land here, not the birds.”\n“…”\nI see?\n“I can’t understand your way of thinking.”\nI spoke and the villainess replied.\n“It sounds like a compliment to hear from you.”\nThen I said, “Normally, just because there are birds on their land, people don’t bother to walk through them.”\n“…”\nThe villainess remained silent. Well, she must have realized that what she said was nonsense. She just needed something to say to me.\n“When will you tell me about where you are going?”\nTuk-tuduk…\nThe answer to my question was the sudden sound of rain, and the gradual pouring raindrops.\nI made a temporary umbrella with ice magic. Then, I went to Shael’s side and covered her too. However, as expected, the villainess complained.\n“Stay away.”\n“How could I let my fiancé get drenched in the rain?”\nShael refused to be kind. But I would never had to accept things like that. Then I’ll just have to make her want that kindness.\n“Your hair isn’t what it used to be.”\n“What, what?”\nIt’s the same thing Shael said to me in the past. I said as I took the ice umbrella away from her.\n“It seems that you are suffering from hair loss.”\n“…”\n“Come to think of it, they say that being in the rain is a fatal to your hair.”\n“…”\nThen the villainess secretly clung to me as the she avoided the rain.\n“What are you doing?”\n“You said so earlier. How could you let your fiancé get wet in the rain?”\n“Didn’t you tell me to stay away earlier?”\n“…”\nOf course, I put it back on before she got mad. Only she complained again.\n“Can’t you make it bigger?”\n“The ice magic is difficult to maintain, so this is the limit.”\n“Useless.”\nThat’s not something you should say to the person who put it on you. Anyway, the wicked woman was selfish.\nIt was then I had an idea.\n“Then why don’t you learn magic yourself?”\n“It’s annoying.”\n“You’re just lazy.”\nThe villainess Shael didn’t learn magic. Considering that she knew how to use magic a little in this world, that must have been due to my intervention. Moreover, even if she had learned magic in the novel, her level was not that high.\nWell, if you use force against a wicked woman with a bad personality, that would have a very adverse effect. But, I still have many things ahead of me to do. So I need to use brute force.\nSince I intervened, there was no way she could overcome her ordeal the way she originally did. Making her learn her magic was my first priority. While I was thinking that, she suddenly started a fight.\n“You’re a dog..”\n“What is it, all of a sudden?”\nShael spoke to me with an expression as if she had a good idea. However, her words were dirty compared to the raised corners of her mouth.\n“Bas*tard.”\nThe second dirty word. I didn’t know what the hell was going on… but I couldn’t stand still.\n“You’re a bitch”\n“Puh, don’t you know anything else to curse with?”\n“It’s because I don’t have a dirty mind like you.”\nShe tolerated words that would normally cause her to react. Weird. Why did the wicked woman’s patience suddenly improve?\n“What the hell is that?”\nI was a wicked woman who ridiculed me even with such a question.\n“Not only your mind, but your mouth is also dirty.”\n“Yes, that’s good!”\n“Have you gone mad?”\nAt such a question, she suddenly took out an object hidden under her cloak. It was a marble the size of her fist.\n‘Woh’\nIt was marble that oscillated with blue magical energy. It meant that it had magic applied on it.\n“What is that?”\nShe grinned and put her hand on the marble. Then a sound flowed from the marble.\n[You’re lazy.]\n[You’re a bit*ch]\n[Not only your mind, but your mouth is also dirty.]\n[Have you gone mad?]\nWhat came out was my voice. The things I said earlier were recorded. And the content was not very good.\n“What?”\n“It’s a Serpent Orb that can only be found once a year. You can record your voice whenever you want. It’s impossible to manipulate.”\n‘Huh?’\n“So, in other words, you’re finished!”\nThe villainess laughed as she spoke.\nIt was a crisis indeed.\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "The wicked woman silently smiled at me.\n“Please erase it.”\nOf course, there was no way the villainess would erase it that easily. The wicked woman put her hand on the Serpent Orb again. Then my voice was heard again.\n[You’re a bit*ch.]\n“I’ve never heard anything like this from anyone.”\n“Everyone will think about that in their hearts.”\n“Ha, are you finished talking?”\nWell, it was true. If anyone met the wicked woman, they would chew all sorts of curses in their heart, but never say it out loud.\nAnyway, I didn’t expect this to happen. It was a huge crisis. How the hell did she get that stuff? She even said that it comes out only once a year. If so, it must have had an exorbitant price. Does the wicked woman want to defeat me to the extent of spending that much?\nWell, it seems so.\n“You apologize first, and I’ll erase it after seeing how you do.”\nThe villainess said while raising the corner of her mouth. She wanted to torment me all the time.\n“I will apologize if you erase it.”\n“Hah, can’t you grasp the current situation?”\n“Wasn’t I just telling the truth?”\n“What?”\nYes. Because it was true that she was indeed a bit*ch. Otherwise, did it make sense to start by arguing with me and then record only my words?\n“Wasn’t it you who said ‘Dog-like’ First?”\n“Me? Oh, I don’t remember.”\nThe villainess continues her pretense.\n“Did you get dementia after hair loss?”\n“I’m speechless, really. Ha…”\nThe wicked woman carefully placed the Serpent Orb inside her cloak. Then she said as usual.\n“You are… really the worst.”\n“So are you.”\nIf it was the usual, I would have responded more… but I stopped here because she found my weakness.\n“For now, let’s think about it after looking at how you do today.”\n“Okay.”\nTo be honest, I didn’t think the villainess would erase this easily, but… I had no choice and walked after her.\nHow many minutes did it take? We finally reached a street full of people. Shael walked on without hesitation as if she was familiar with the road.\nThen what I saw was a large building. The place she came to was the auction house.\n‘Could it be that she also bought the Serpent Orb here?’\nAs if to affirm my thoughts, she went straight into the auction house.\n“What are you buying?”\n“Something useful.”\nThe villainess didn’t even know what she was going to buy, she just wanted to casually spend the money.\nAs I entered the auction house, I saw many people. All I could hear was the loud voice of the auctioneer.\n[Welcome to the auction house. The auction will start soon, so please prepare.]\n“We have to sit over there.”\nWhat Shael pointed at was the in front of her. Seat number one in the front row. She was a villainess who was greedy for even the seat. I followed her and sat down next to her and looked at her auction listing.\nThere were many miscellaneous things, from all kinds of luxurious things such as swords, jewels, and treasures to things that were normally hard to find.\nI even saw some things I wanted to buy.\nThe villainess was also eyeing her list.\nDid the wicked woman have crazy spending habits? To be honest, I was feeling anxious. By any chance, if this engagement was maintained and I got married to the villainess… I will have to carefully manage my money.\n[Now, we will begin our first auction with this huge gem! It is a hybrid sapphire created by mixing several types of gems! Let’s start with 1 million gold!]\nWith the auctioneer’s signal, many noble ladies pressed buttons to start the auction.\nIt was definitely a very beautiful gem. If so, would the wicked woman be interested?\nUnexpectedly, Shael was not interested in jewelry. A few auctions went by like that. It was then that the villainess showed her interest.\n[This time it’s Heavy Pollen! When sprayed, the object temporarily gains weight. You can also secretly spray it on nasty people. Let’s start with 500,000 gold!]\nThe villainess immediately put her hand on her button. It was a sign that she would buy it.\n[No. 57. 700,000 Gold!]\n[Ah! Number 1 is 900,000 gold. That’s 900,000 gold!]\nThis number 1 was Shael. She immediately made a successful bid. Even in successful bids, she spent a ton of money.\n‘Why on earth would you pay that much money to buy something like that?’\nI couldn’t understand. No, I think I was able to guess where she would use that.\n“Where will you use that?”\n“It’s a secret.”\n“Do you want to spray that on me secretly?”\n“…”\nThe villainess remained silent. It was meant to tease me. Did she come here to buy things to annoy me, like the Serpent Orb that she might have bought here?\n[Ah, next is the Powder of Haste! It was created by the fairies themselves for people who only think and do nothing!]\nShael showed interest again.\n[Just by spraying it, you can make people temporarily do the things in their head without hesitation. How good is this?]\n[Starting at 700,000 gold!]\nShael who put her hand on the button right away. She was indeed a rich, wicked woman. Then, the winning bidder was determined.\n[Ah! Number 1 Will win the bid for 2.5 million gold!]\nI suddenly started to feel uneasy for some reason. Hopefully that won’t be used on me either.\nAnother auction started before my anxiety even went away.\n[This time it’s the Pill of Lies! If you feed it to someone, they will only tell lies! And, if they only tell lies, won’t you know the truth too?]\nThis time, the successful bidder was Shael again.\n[Finally here! Obedience Tree Sap! Of course, it’s impossible to make a target do something they completely refuse to do… but you can make them do anything else!]\n[Number 143, bid 2.5 million gold!]\n[Number 1, bid 2.7 million gold!]\n[Number 2, bid 3 million gold]\nNumber 1 Was Shael and number 2 was me.\n“What is it, why are you trying to buy it?”\n“Shouldn’t I have at least one thing to use against you?”\n“Haah.”\n[Number 1, bids 4 million gold!!]\nShael raised her bid from 3 million gold to 4 million gold. She was, after all, the jewel of the duke’s family. The duke was really giving a lot of money to Shael.\n“No more?”\n“…”\n[This is also a successful bid for Number 1!]\nMy total wealth was about 3.8 million gold. It was lower than the successful bid price that Shael immediately called. I was horribly defeated by the wicked woman in the battle of capital.\nAfter that, Shael bought quite a few things. The villainess… had a lot of money.\nAfter such a long time, she came out to the auction house and wandered the streets. However, something out of the ordinary happened.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Can’t you understand it when you see it? I am giving you something to eat.”\nThe villainess was handing me a sandwich. It was an absolutely unbelievable situation.\nEven so, I still received the sandwich. ‘Was the villainess getting better little by little?’\nAlthough Shael’s lips curled up…\n‘Ah, nothing will happen’\nI thought as I ate the sandwich.\n***\nShael was able to bid on several items. She was very happy, and there were many things that would help annoy her fiancé.\n‘Yeah, shouldn’t I try it since I bought it?’\nPondering the words of her auctioneer, Shael took out the Powder of Haste. She then sprayed it on the sandwich she just bought. It was meant to be given to Eran, her fiancé.\n‘Oh there’s a note…’\nThere was a side effect that he might become violent in case of overdose? Shael glanced over it.\nActually, she didn’t take it lightly. In case of overdose… there was also a caution that the effect would be reduced. Sharel’s strategy was like this— after Eran ate the sandwich, she would take out her Serpent Orb. Then she would demand that if he licked her shoes, she would erase the Orb.\nThat would be an act of complete submission. If it was the normal Eran, he wouldn’t do it, but…\n[Just by spraying it, you can make people temporarily do the things in their head without hesitation. How good is this?]\nYes, he would lick her shoes just by thinking. Of course, she wouldn’t erase the Serpent Orb just because he did that.\nThen she went straight into action, and Eran ate the sandwich without question.\nNow it was her turn to speak as she took out the Serpent Orb.\n***\nShael grinned and took out the Serpent Orb.\n“Why are you taking out that orb?”\n“Do you want me to erase it?”\n“Yes, are you going to erase it? Didn’t you promise to erase it if I carried your things today?”\nIt was a promise she made after the auction. Ever since then I have been carrying her luggage. Will the wicked woman keep her promise?\n“Ah. I’ve changed my mind. Lick my shoes, and I’ll erase it.”\n“What?”\nThe villainess was mocking me and waiting for me to act. Of course, I couldn’t do that.\nThen, I had one very good idea.\nIt was a good way to solve all sorts of problems. It was a way to motivate her unwillingness to learn her magic, and also to take away her Serpent Orb.\nShe was the one who said that she would erase the orb if I carried her luggage today. I wouldn’t even have thought of this idea if she didn’t break her promise. Honestly, I feel a little bit sorry for the villainess. But surprisingly, unlike the usual, it seemed possible because I didn’t feel guilty.\n‘Did I learn to be this vicious from the villainess?’\nI didn’t know what happened to my mind, but I couldn’t worry much about the wicked woman’s urging.\n“I won’t erase it if you don’t do it quickly.”\nWhat answered the wicked woman’s urging was a clear and elegant sound.\nChae…ae…ae…aeng!\nA long echoing metallic sound. Considering that it was a sound that could only be heard in the battlefield, this was a somewhat unique situation. As she heard the sound of my sword being pulled out, the wicked woman said in bewilderment.\n“Eran?”\n“Please give me the Serpent Orb now.”\n“What…?”\nIt was the first time I had seen the villainess look so flustered.\n“Haah.”\nI didn’t know who was the wicked anymore… but that wasn’t what mattered now.\nYes, this was the solution that would motivate the villainess to learn magic and take away her Serpent Orb as well.\nIf the villainess catches your weakness, use brute force.\nGoblin:\nThe next exams are quite difficult.

      "content": "“You’re the worst!” Said the villainess through her gritted teeth. She was obviously feeling indignant, as she stared at the Serpent Orb I was holding in my hand.\n“Hahahaha, that’s right. Thank you.”\n“Dog…”\nThe villainess was a bad girl who didn’t know that many curses. Well, I was sure that she didn’t have the experience of cursing many people other than me. No, I was sure that I was the only one. So I guess I could take that as a compliment. It’s a bit of a pity for the villainess thought…\n‘But I just can’t help it.’\nIf this Orb I currently had was shown to Duke Jespen… the engagement would’ve surely been broken. However, she didn’t do that.\nUnexpectedly, the villainess didn’t break up our engagement. Of course, it wasn’t because she was being considerate. It was probably because she had no one better to bully other than me. At some point I too had started to bully her, but she still didn’t try to escape by breaking up the engagement.\nBut what would’ve if she had caught my weakness? The wicked woman would’ve gradually reverted back to her former self. Then she would’ve become a villainess cruel enough to kill me, and then she too would’ve faced her own bad end. So, I guess it really couldn’t be helped? This was the best option after all. However, I really didn’t know how I came to the decision of pointing my sword at the villainess…\n“Please give it back!”\n“No. I will be confiscating it for the time being.”\n“Son of a bi*tch!”\nI didn’t plan to retort to her insult, and then I heard her whisper.\n‘Bad guy.’\n“I can only tell you that it is what it is.”\n“…”\nThe wicked woman swallowed her words. But after a while, she grinned. There was only one reason why she would do that. It meant that she had found another way to bully me. I didn’t know how the hell she’d bully me, as the wicked woman continued to grin. She continued to grin even while walking. Was she imagining the future when she was bullying me?\nThat was how we returned to the Azbel mansion. It was a trip with a fairly favorable harvest. It’s because I could witness her wicked tastes and her spending habits. And then, even though it was already evening, the villainess made a proposal.\n“Would you like some tea?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Is it wrong for me to have some tea with my fiance?”\nThe villainess suddenly offered to have some tea. Similar to how she had offered the sandwich from before. I didn’t have a reason to refuse her. So I followed her into her room. She poured us some tea. Just from the fact that the corner of her mouth was raised, I could tell that she had a reason behind doing this.\n“Are you planning something?”\n“Oh, no.”\n“…”\n“Don’t worry.”\nI couldn’t help but worry. Fortunately, she wouldn’t poison me. At most, she would use something she had bought at the auction house. It should be fine… because she didn’t buy anything that would harm me that much. The wicked woman gave me the cup of tea and I began to drink it. The villainess watched me closely as I did.\n“What are you looking at?”\n“Hmm, nothing.”\nAs soon as I completely emptied the cup, the wicked woman grinned. She laughed at me and said,\n“I hate you so much.”\nIt was something that was too unfit to say with a smile. Has the villainess finally gone mad?\n“What are you saying, all of a sudden?”\n“I hate you. Oh, and I want to break off the engagement.”\n“…?”\nIt was different from the usual. It felt kind of odd. What the hell was this wicked woman up to? First of all, I had to decide on what I had to say as well.\n“I don’t like you either.”\n“…”\n“Ah, and I also definitely want to break off the marriage as well.”\nThen she villainess went silent. Normally, she would sigh and curse at me, but not this time. She just stared at me without saying a word. It was as if I was the one who had cursed first. This made me seem as if was the bad person. Then, she asked in disbelief.\n“What, what…? Say it again!”\n“I hate you too.”\n“Ah, that…”\nThis time, the villainess stammered.\n‘Why the hell are you acting like this?’\n“You, get out.”\n“Yes?”\n“It’s because I don’t want to see you… leave!”\nThe wicked woman suddenly issues such an order. However, there was no emotion of resentment on her face. It was all so strange, very strange. I did indeed cured at her her many times. If that was the reason, it wouldn’t be strange to give me such an order, since she could be angry.\nBut not this time. Far from having an angry expression, she had a look of confusion. Same as when I pointed my sword at her. I couldn’t figure out her thoughts at all. So I left a parting comment and left.\n“Yes, that’s what I want to say as well. I don’t want to see you either.”\n“…”\nThe villainess remained silent this time as well. Was it because today’s incident was so surprising that she went mad? I didn’t know.\nTime will be short I left her in her room.\nGoblin:\nThe next exams are quite difficult. I had to study non-stop hence the lack of chapter releases.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Shael saw her fiancé pointing his sword at her.\n‘Isn’t this pure madness?’\n‘Heh, Eran also must have had his hair done!’\nShe thought.\nOf course, this particular situation was also caused by Shael’s own actions. It was happening because of the effects of the powder she had fed him. However, there was no way that the villainess would regret at her own actions. After Eran took the Serpent Orbs away, she thought.\n‘What can I do to punish this da*mn fiancé?’\nAgain, what came to her mind was one of the items she had bought at the auction. It was the Pill of Lies.\nShe carefully thought back to what the auctioneer had said.\n— [This time it’s the Pill of Lies! If you feed it to someone, they will only tell lies! And, if they only tell lies, won’t you know the truth too?]\n‘Yes, this is it. With this, I can punish my da*mn fiancé.’\n— [When using it, you should use it in very small amounts. If you use a lot at once, you will not only say the opposite, but also do the opposite.]\nThere were no room for errors this time. Thinking of the precautions, she split a tiny bit of the pill and mixed it into the tea. It was just the right amount. If Eran drank this tea, he would have no choice but to tell lies. So, when Eran finished drinking his tea, Shael planned to talk to Eran right away.\n‘I hate you so much.’\nShe wanted to start with this.\nUsually, Eran would insult her back. Of course it wouldn’t be like that this time. Because of the effect of the pills, Eran would say that he liked her. And after that, she would reject him and say she wanted to break off their engagement. Then she would ignore Eran.\nShael thought it was obvious what Eran would say next. Because of the dr*ug… he’d say that he didn’t want to break off the engagement.\nIn her head she imagined a scenario where she was rejecting her fiancé as he was clinging to her.\n‘Ah, it seems that the anger I’ve been feeling so far has lessened just from thinking about it!’\nAfter that, she would make fun of Eran for times to come.\n‘No, I will torment Eran for the rest of his life!’\nShe grinned and handed the tea to Eran.\n“Are you planning something?”\n“Oh, no.”\n“…”\nEran was feeling doubtful. As expected from an useless man, he acted clever only at times like this. However, Eran drank her tea right away. That was probably because she confirmed that there was no poison. However, it contained something that was much worse than a deadly poison!.\n‘Poohyot~’\nShael laughed inwardly as she sneered at Eran. She began to look forward to that future. She would never forget what was about to happen from now on.\n‘I’ll burn it into my memory!’\nShe thought, as she said to Eran.\n“I hate you so much.”\nShael waited for an answer.\n‘Now my fiancé… tell me something amusing!’\n“What are you saying, all of a sudden?”\n“I hate you. Oh, and I want to break off the engagement.”\nThis time, it was Eran’s turn to insult her back. But not this time. Eran’s mouth opened.\n“I don’t like you either.”\n‘Huh?’\nShael doubted her own ears. If that was a lie, then what Eran said to her was…\n[I like you.]\n‘How is that something realistic?’ Shael couldn’t believe it at all. Then, another word came from Eran mouth.\n“Ah, and I also definitely want to break off the marriage as well.”\n[I want to continue our engagement.]\nAt that, she thought for a moment.\n‘Yes, this might be because the dr*ug has not yet started to take effect.’\nSo she asked Eran again.\n“What, what…? Say it again!”\nThis time, Eran would surely say that he liked her.\n“I hate you too.”\n[I like you.]\nBut why the hell was she still hearing that?\nㅡ […if they only tell lies, won’t you know the truth too?]\nIt was then that the auctioneer’s words suddenly came to her mind.\n‘No, this can’t be true!’\n“Ah, that…”\n‘I have to ask again…’\nHowever, she couldn’t speak at all. It was because her fiancé was looking at her with quite a strange expression.\n“You, get out.”\n“Yes?”\n“It’s because I don’t want to see you… leave!”\nShe chose to run away. Because she didn’t feel like asking any more questions right away. So she asked Eran to leave the room.\n“Yes, that’s what I want to say as well. I don’t want to see you either.”\n[I don’t want to say that. Because I want to keep seeing you.]\n‘Ah…’\nThe villainess, Shael wanted to ignore the words her fiancé had just said. She felt defeated. Yes, her fiance has been acting like that since sometime. Whenever Shael tried to bully him, it was her who would be defeated in the end.\nEran got out of situation like these like a loach.\n‘He is the worst fiancé ever.’\nShael thought as she looked at the pills which she still had more than half left. Obviously this dr*ug was fake There was no dr*ug that could make people only tell lies. She could prove that by taking this dr*ug herself as well!\n“…”\nBut she couldn’t take the dr*ug.\n‘No way, what would I do if the dr*ug turned out to be real?’\nThe villainess was confused. All of this was happening because of her fiancé. Yeah, because of her dog-like fiancé!\nGoblin:\nOkay! My exam is over. Now it's time to give this project a proper schedule.

      "content": "A day had passed since Shael served me tea. At the moment, I was drinking tea with Shael as usual. However, even today, Shael seemed quite strange. It felt like she had lost her spirit. Of course, what bothered me most was when that will would return. Other than that, I had some other doubts.\n‘Why did this evil woman suddenly lose her spirit? Could it be because I pointed my sword at her?’\nHowever, she did keep insulting me many times after I pointed my her sword at her.\n“Why are you so down?”\n“It’s none of your concern.”\nAfter saying that, the villainess lowered her head. Seeing the evil woman who would always try to bully me act like that made me feel quite bad. What I wished for was her villainous wickedness to go away, but not her spirit to go away as well. Then, how can I get my usual wicked girl back? After thinking a bit about that, I immediately spoke to her.\n“You look stupid.”\n“Hahh?”\nAt last, the villainess glared at me as usual. Does this method really work?\nBut after a while, Shael lowered her head again. So, what method should I use this time?\nWhat came to mind was, magic. There were various types of magic in this world, and of course it also included some fancy magics as well. They were attractive magic that made you feel good just by looking at it. More than anything, I thought that it would be nice if Shael became interested in the magic and would want to learn it. Because she needed her own strength to protect herself.\nSoon a flame rose in my hand.\n“What are you doing all of a sudden?”\n“Fire magic. Isn’t it pretty?”\n“That’s not what I meant!”\nHer eyes were still focused on my hand. If you were someone from the Azbel family, which was a family famous for their magic, you would have lived your life watching magic until you got tired of it. But the villainess was different. Because up until now, the villainess had refused to learn magic. However, for some reason, the villainess in the novel does agree to learn magic.\nBut this was reality, not a novel. The villainess, Shael, was a living and breathing human being. And a lot had also changed because of my intervention. While thinking that, I continued to use my magic. A flower made of flame bloomed in my hand. I made it like that because the villainess liked flowers. Of course, the reason she liked flowers was because they were easy to trample, which was a bit unusual, but… I’m not going to go into that detail.\nThe flower bloomed in my hand. And, it was probably her favorite kind of flower as well. It was a flower made of flame that looked like a red rose.\n“Do you like flowers?”\n“Yes, I like it.”\n“You also like to trample flowers.”\nThe wicked woman looked at the flower in dismay.\n“Don’t trample this flower.”\n“Ha, do you think I’m an idiot?”\n“If you see a flower, you will usually just trample on it.”\n“…”\nShael glared at me. It seemed that my actions had caused her to slightly regain her usual spirit. So this time I had another idea. I thought of something that would help her some more. It was all to rehabilitate this wicked woman even a little.\n“How nice would it be if you just looked at it like this even then?”\n“Right now… it’s hot, so how can I do that?”\n“Even some common flowers have thorns that can hurt you.”\nShael remained silent.\n“If you just look at it, wouldn’t you be able to enjoy it longer?”\n“…”\nThe flower in my hand withered before she could answer. This time, what I made in my hands were small birds made of ice.\n“Do you like cute birds?”\n“I like it.”\n“So why did you walk through the flock of birds back then?”\n“What are you talking about?”\nI was talking about the time I was following this wicked woman. I saw the wicked woman trampling on the flowers, then mercilessly walk through the flock of little birds. The villainess stared at the little ice birds in my hand.\n“How nice it would’ve been if you had just looked at them like this even then.”\n“…”\nThe villainess remained silent. However, seeing that she didn’t snap at me like usual… I judged that it might have worked a little. Now it was time to suggest her to learn magic.\n“How about you start learning magic?”\n“It’s annoying.”\nOf course, it wouldn’t be easy to make the villainess agree to learn what she hated. Because the villainess was very stubborn.\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Shael couldn’t bully Eran as usual. The reason for that was, she kept thinking about the things that happened yesterday.\n‘This person didn’t actually hate me? I can’t believe it.’\nCome to think of it, Eran could directly break off their engagement anytime he wanted. After all, he was the son of a duke. However, Eran never tried to break off the engagement. Even when Shael ignored Eran, even when she bullied him.\nShe couldn’t figure it out.\n‘If Eran didn’t hate me, then why on earth would he use that foul language?’\n[You are a bi*tch.]\nShael recalled what Eran had said to her in the past.\nNo one could say that to someone they liked. Of course, it was natural that Shael could, because she, who was a villainess had no interest in liking anyone.\n“You look stupid.”\nEran said to Shael as she was lost in her troublesome thoughts. Yeah, no one would say things like that to someone they liked. However, Shael lowered her head again, because she felt as if Eran was saying this to comfort her.\nThis was utter nonsense!\n‘How could that word sound so soothing to me?’\nIt was then, a fiery rose bloomed in her fiance’s hand. He seemed to be using his magic for her spectacle. And then, Eran said something as he created small birds of ice in his hands.\n“How nice it would’ve been if you had just looked at them like this even then.”\nWhen she heard what he said, another thought popped into her head. Surely, what she did to the little birds would seem strange to him. The birds he liked so much were roaming on the ground, and she just casually passed through them.\n‘So what about this?’\n‘What the hell did he mean by saying that? If he was under the effect of the drug, it would make him only tell lies, and if that was real…’\nIt would mean that her fiancé liked her!\nThen why on earth did he curse at his own fiancé, and call her a bi*tch?\n‘No, why doesn’t he hate me in the first place?’\nShe couldn’t understand. She obviously thought that he hated her. Because she’s been bullying him for a long time. However, Shael decided to stop thinking about the matter for the time being.\n‘Okay, shouldn’t I just check if the effect of the drug is real?’\nSo she secretly took out the pills in front of Eran. Then she put more than half of the remaining pill into her mouth.\n“What did you just eat?” Eran asked.\nWhat he got in return was just the sound of Shael chewing a pill.\nShael looked at Eran. Now, she would say that she hated Eran very much. Because the claims about the effect of this pill was definitely fake. However, this action was one that she would regret very much.\n“I like you.”\n“Yes?”\nNo, it was an action that she would regret for the rest of her life. A twinkle shone in both of her eyes. This meant that the medicinal effect was real! But the important thing now was not the medicinal effect. What grabbed her interest was the reaction of her fiancé in front of her. Eran looked flustered after hearing her words.\n“That, this… so…”\nHe was so flustered that he couldn’t even speak properly.\n‘Oh, I have to make an excuse quickly! Quickly, I must say it was a joke.’\n“What did you just say?”\n“I really like you.”\nOf course, those words of excuse were also altered under the effect of the pills. Now, it was Shael’s turn to be speechless due to being so flustered.\n“What the hell are you saying?”\nHer fiancé got up and he was slowly approaching her.\n‘What should I do? Yeah, if words don’t work… I can just convey things with actions!’\nSo she decided to slap her fiancé who was slowly approaching her. After that, she planned to just run away.\n‘For now, I just have to stay alone until the effect wears off.\n’ Shael thought as she moved her hand towards her fiancé.\n‘Tashhh!’\nOf course, that sound was something Shael expected to hear in her mind. It was the sound of her slapping Eran’s cheek. She should’ve heard that sharp sound, but what she heard was something completely different than what she had expected to hear.\nPat…\nShe was just patting Eran’s cheek with her hand, like a lover. It was then that she remembered the auctioneer’s words.\n[When using it once, you should use it in very small amounts. If you use a lot at once, you will not only say the opposite, but also do the opposite.]\nCome to think of it, she swallowed more than half of the remaining pill whole.\n‘Oh, I’ve messed up!’\n‘Why the hell am I touching Eran’s cheek?’\nIf even her action were to be reversed, shouldn’t it have been something like moving arm back rather than touching Eran’s cheek? Oh how she resented the auctioneer.\n‘Can’t I just run away?’\nOf course, that was impossible. Rather, she moved even closer to Eran.\n“…”\n“What?”\nEran expresses his confused state through a question. At the moment, the two were looking at each other from an incredibly close distance.\nShael chose to remain silent. Eran was also silent. For a while, there was only silence .\nOf course, that silence was broken when Duke Jespen entered.\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "“I’m sorry I interrupted you.”\nThis was what Duke Jespen said to Shael and Eran, who were, at the time, “passionately” staring at each other. He turned his head to the side, but his eyes remained locked on his daughter. To think that Shael would be caressing Eran’s cheek! It was absolutely unbelievable. And, the corner of his mouth raised up before he knew it.\n‘To think that the rumor that Eran and Shael were in intense love was true!’\nShael had refused to talk about the rumor, which had caused others to believe it even more, but Duke Jespen himself couldn’t believe the rumor at all.\nShael stiffened at her fathers gaze.\n‘Why on earth did he come in now? This situation is so bad!’\n“Hmmm, if you want each other so intensely, shouldn’t you married?”\nDuke Jespen said while hiding his smile. Eran and Shael were only engaged, and the date of the wedding had not even been set. That’s why Duke Jespen had a lot of worries. However, with an opportunity like this, there was no way he would not take advantage of it.\n“It might take me a while to think about that.” Eran said with a troubled expression.\nHonestly, it wasn’t for his dedication to rehabilitate the villainess, Eran would have rejected it outright.\nShael was in a situation where she would mess up if she tried to say something, so she just chose to keep her silence.\n“I would like that.”\nOf course, even the decision to remain silent didn’t go her way. Shael’s mouth just moved on its own.\nAt her words, Duke Jespen grinned and said.\n“I don’t know how you made my daughter like this.”\n“…”\nEran was also taken aback by those words. Shael, who would normally enjoy his surprised expression, felt even more surprised than Eran was. She also felt quite distraught.\n‘If I can’t even be silent, what on earth should I do? I don’t know how long the medicinal effect will last…’\n“Then why don’t we set a date for the wedding in advance?”\nHearing her words, Shael thought.\n‘If the negative becomes the positive, wouldn’t the positive become the negative?’\n“Yes, I would like that.”\nBut even that was a wrong idea. In fact, it was a pill that would make people only tell lies. So no matter what she did, she would lie.\n“Yeah, hahahaha! I can’t be the only one should talk about this matter.”\nKikiiikㅡ\nDuke Jespen hurriedly left before Eran could even say something to stop him. Because Duke Jespen really wanted to see his grandchildren. Moreover, it was also because he thought that Eran was the only one who could accept Shael, who had a bad personality.\n“What should we do?”\n“What is it?”\nShe was supposed to remain silent at Eran’s question. Still, she asked back as if she didn’t understand what was wrong with this situation.\n“…”\n‘Da*n you auctioneer!’\nShael cursed the auctioneer in her mind. That guy only said that the dru*g would only make people tell lies, and that an overdose would reverse their behavior, but he didn’t mention that they would not even be able to remain silent.\n‘Someday, I will destroy that auction house.’\nInwardly, she swore vengeance against the auctioneer.\n‘Basta*d. Dog-like guy.’\n‘A guy worse than Eran.’\nThose were the biggest curses she could do.\n‘No, it would be wrong to say that he was a guy worse than Eran.’\nNo one could be worse than Eran. Because he was a crazy person who cursed at his fiancé all the time and even pointed a sword at her.\n“Shael?”\n“What?”\nIt was fortunate that she was able to speak normally at time like this. It was a comforting fact.\n“Have you gone mad?”\nEran insulted her again. Normally, she would have sighed and insulted him back, but now she herself was genuinely worried if she had really lost her mind.\n‘Why did I eat the pill? Even if I did, why so much?’\n‘Did I really have to test the pills?’\nNot at all. No matter how much she was doubtful about the medicinal effect of the dru*g, shouldn’t she have tried feeding it to someone else?\n‘No, even if I wanted to test the pills myself, why did I take that pill in front of Eran in the first place?’\n‘Imust have gone mad…’\nShael thought.\n“No, that’s normal.”\nBut Shael was someone who wouldn’t agree to the comment that she was crazy. Fortunately, Eran didn’t get the chance to look at her strangely. Because someone knocked on the door.\nKnock…tock…\n“Come in.”\nThe maid, Astin, came in. Judging from her blushing face, it was clear that she had overheard their conversation with Duke Jespen earlier.\n“The Duke is calling you.”\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "“Where are you going?”\nDuke Jespen looked at Shael and asked. The Duke was very surprised to see us go outside.\nWell, whenever I met Shael, we always spent time in Shael’s room.\n“I’m going to teach Shael magic. Will it be all right?”\n“Shael is learning magic? Is that true, Shael?”\nDuke Jespen didn’t believe it easily. Of course. Shael had never learned magic and refused to learn it even until now. In order to convince Shael to learn magic, the Duke must have put in a lot of effort, but it all ended in failure. It must’ve come as quite a shock when he heard that she suddenly decided to learn magic.\n“Yes, that’s right.”\nDuke Jespen smiled broadly after hearing Shael’s answer. He most likely thought that Shael was so enamored with me that she even agreed to learn magic.\nHowever, it was all thanks to yesterday’s incident caused by that strange pill. Of course, Shael also expected this and wrinkled her face. Whatever it was, it didn’t matter to me. In the first place, wasn’t it all her own fault? Why the hell did you take that strange pill?\nDuke Jespen smiled and went upstairs.\nI was sure that by tomorrow, the rumor that Shael and I fell in love would become even more consolidated.\nShael narrowed her eyes as if she had expected this as well. After walking a little longer, we arrived at the Azbel family’s magic training ground. We could see many mages belonging to the family currently immersed in training. Then their gaze gathered on the newcomers.\nThey looked at Shael and me and started whispering… I could already guess what kind of rumors would spread after this. There was already a rumor that Shael was finally conquered by me. And now, that rumor would not only be spread by the maids but also to the mages affiliated with the family.\nThe villainess, Shael, stopped them by glaring at them.\n“Look at this.”\nI handed out a piece of paper to Shael. It was a piece of paper with a simple magic circle drawn on it. It was the magic I wanted Shael to learn first.\n“What, what should I do?”\n“Think in your head and use magic.”\n“…”\nThe villainess glared at me in defiance. Then there was only one thing I had to do.\n[Yes, I like you.]\n[I love you to death.]\nI played the recording from the Serpent Orb. She looked annoyed. But of course, she had no choice but to give up her rebellious thoughts.\n“…”\nShael gritted her teeth and looked at the magic circle. She then closed her eyes and frowned.\n“I used it. What should I do now?”\n“It’s a magic that prevents burns. It must be used before using fire-related magic.”\nThis time, I gave Shael a piece of paper containing a magic circle of the same level as before. After receiving the paper, Shael immediately used the magic. A small flame rose from Shael’s hand, and it seemed like Shael didn’t like the heat.\n“Now that’s it, right?”\nOf course, that wasn’t the end. Certainly, Shael had a talent for magic, considering that she had the blood of the Azbel family, a famous mage family. So it was natural for her to do this this much. Even I, who suddenly possessed a character in a novel, quickly became stronger in a short period of time. It was thanks to the blood of the Baslett family, a family famous for their swordsmanship.\nThen, even if she disliked and rejected magic, Shael had grown up watching it all around her, so she could develop incredibly fast.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Ah. I am not doing anything.”\nContrary to what she said, Shael was subtly pointing the flame at me. I didn’t even teach her how to change the direction of the magic, she just learned it by herself to annoy me.\n“Can you even hurt me with that?”\nA huge flame that was incomparable to the small flame that on Shael’s hand formed on my hand. It caused Shael to freak out and she quickly backed away from me.\n“Yours is just an insignificant spark.”\n“…”\nThere was a saying that you had to use praise in order to teach a child. But that wouldn’t work for the villainess. In order to teach the villainess, I had to rebuke her.\n“Is that really the best you can do?”\nAlso, as soon as I provoked Shael, she started to focus on her hands. The flame in her hand gradually grew. It was honestly something amazing. As expected from the blood of the family famous for their magic.\nWhat took weeks for me to do, she did it in just one day. She was quite gifted in magic indeed. But she wasn’t satisfied. Of course, the villainess always set me as the standard.\n“That’s enough. Enough now.”\n“I can do more.”\n“It took me weeks to do that, so that’s enough.”\nEven with those words, the villainess didn’t put out the fire. The important thing for her was not to beat the past me, but to beat the present me.\n“Do you want to create a big flame that quickly?”\n“If I have to learn that anyway, isn’t it natural for me to learn it quickly?”\n“Then there is only one sure way.”\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "How to quickly improve your magic skills?\n“It’s simple, very simple.” I said as the sound of burning flame was heard from my hand.\n“You have to do this.” I said that as I moved the fire closer to her.\n“Ah.”\n“If you are a descendant of the Azbel family, you must about know this.”\nThere were many ways to acquire magic quickly. Among them, it was pretty easy to quickly learn fire-related magic. It’s just you had to suffer a lot.\nShe stared at the flames in my hand. She was sweating.\n“I don’t think that’s very safe…”\n“Why would you think that? Even if you’re hurt, I can use healing magic.”\n“…”\nThe villainess went silent.\nOf course it was all a joke. I wish she could learn magic quickly, but if I set her on fire, Duke Jespen will turn me to ashes.\n“It was a joke.”\n“I don’t think it was a joke.”\n“It was, because of this…”\nShe couldn’t argue more. It was because I pointed to the orb I was carrying in my arm.\nI can use this orb for the rest of my life, right?\nI approached Shael. Her hands were red. The reason was that even after using basic burn prevention magic, the flames were too strong.\n“Show me your hand.”\n“I hate it.”\n“Are you feeling ashamed of your fiancé who you love to death?”\n“…”\nThe villainess stared at me as if she wanted to kill me. I don’t know for how long I’ll have to be on the receiving end of those eyes in the future. I used a healing spell on her hand and said.\n“This time, try this.”\n“It’s annoying.”\nOf course, Shael had no way to refuse it. The ground in front of her rose. But the degree was very subtle. To the point where you wouldn’t notice unless you looked closely.\n“Is that all you can do?”\n“How about you try it too?”\nThe ground rose with a heavy sound. It looked about an inch tall. It was clearly recognizable at a glance.\n“How about this?”\n“I’m new, and you’re not.”\n“No. This is my first time using this magic.”\n“…!”\nThe villainess seemed startled.\n[Maybe I’m less talented at magic than this guy?] She must be thinking that. Of course, Shael was a great talent for doing that much in her first try. Indeed, as expected of the bloodline of the Azbel family. Honestly, she was learning at a speed that no one would be able to achieve.\nStill, I was able to maintain a clear difference from her…\nActually, this wasn’t the first time I’ve used magic. In fact, this earth type magic was my favorite. So, wasn’t it natural that I would do well?\nI managed to fool the villainess completely, because now she was using this spell with clenched teeth.\nTouching her ego seemed very effective as usual.\nI looked at the ground in front of her. Before, you had to look carefully to notice it, but not anymore. The ground had risen to the point where it was clearly visible. She was comparing the magic I used with her own. Of course, her magic couldn’t beat mine. I used my earth magic again and the earth rose higher and higher.\n“Really, this is your first time using it?”\n“Yes.”\n“…”\nThe villainess went silent again. But in order to heighten her enthusiasm, I must overwhelm her. The ground soared according to my will, and this time it was high enough to reach Shael’s shoulders.\n“It’s quite easy.”\n“…”\nThe villainess continued to remain silent. Now, this seems like the right time to console her.\n“But well, yours wasn’t that bad, Shael, you do have the talent.”\n“…”\nTo be comforted by someone who did something better than you. Perhaps it would be more effective than hitting Shael with a whip. Perhaps, from now on, she will devote herself to earth magic every day. Because she wanted to defeat me. But my expectations were proven wrong. She had… an eccentric mindset.\n“Sword. Then I want to learn swordsmanship.”\n“Yes?”\n“I’m going to learn swordsmanship.”\nWhat the hell does this mean? To think that she wanted to learn swordsmanship while leaving magic, which she had tremendous talent for.\n“Why do you want to learn swordsmanship all of a sudden? You have a great talent for magic.”\n“No, I need to learn swordsmanship.”\n“Why?”\nShe confidently answered my question.\n“I would be able to bully you better if I learn swordsmanship.”\nWas it okay to say such aggressive words in front of the person you want to bully? She was even smiling as if she was imagining a future where she was bullying me.\n“Is that so?”\nI thought while stroking the handle of the sword at my side. It seems that the time had come to bring out this famous sword again. The bad girl who didn’t listen needed a lesson.\nThat would be quite entertaining indeed.\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "At the training ground of the Azbel family. Only the clear sound of swords could be heard, and there— was a woman who did not fit in the place at all.\nIt was the villainess, Shael— who vigorously raised her sword.\n“Just swing it hard.”\nWhoop hoo…\nAs soon as I finished my words, Shael swung the sword hard. Apart from her physical prowess, she had a tremendous talent for swordsmanship. She had no hesitation with the sword. Anyway, a bad girl was in the end, a bad girl. If a normal noble lady was new to handling sharp things, she’d usually be terrified, but… Shael wasn’t.\nThe villainess didn’t feel afraid of swinging a blade.\n“Are you okay?”\n“Yes, great.”\nShael grunted and glared at me.\n“Am I doing better than you when you first learned swordsmanship?”\n“I’m not sure about that.”\nOf course not. She was doing a lot better than me when I was just learning swordsmanship. Putting her talent aside, unlike the villainess, I was terrified of blades.\n“I like it more than magic, it’s much better!”\n“Are you really from the Azbel family?”\nShe even enjoyed swordsmanship. Even though it was a good thing from the perspective of a teacher… I was now thinking about something different. What if, by any chance, the villainess used her powers to do bad things?\nAt first I thought she wouldn’t. Even now, I still thought so. But she was the villainess. In the novel, she was a villainess who even killed her own fiancé. So it was natural for me to be worried. Maybe not now, but what about later? In the distant future, she might use her powers to do some bad things.\nNow that I think about it, I really needed to prepare several insurances before reaching the ultimate goal of rehabilitating the villainess. So I had to make it my main priority.\nWhoop hoo…\nAlthough she knew that I was distracted, the villainess still swung her sword.\n“Ah, did you think someone like you could beat me?”\n“…?”\nThe villainess wanted to beat me and hurt my pride. But it’s a pity she has to face disappointment again.\nChae…ae…aeng!\nBecause I also drew my sword.\n“What are you doing?”\n“I with to have a duel with you.”\nIt was an absurd proposal. No matter how talented she was, she had just learned the sword. There was no way she could win. Of course, it didn’t really matter to me. The same was true for the villainess. The most important thing for the villainess was to defeat me.\n“If you manage to scratch me even once, I will admit defeat.”\n“…!”\nAnyway, Shael seemed to think it was something worth trying. She straightened her posture right away. Then she swung her sword. Except for her sloppy posture, her slash was perfect.\nThe sound of a sword cutting through the air was heard. But, her sword couldn’t reach me.\n‘But was it okay for her to swing the sword like this?’\nIf I hadn’t avoided it, it was a horizontal slash that would have split my body in two by now. Anyway, the villainess was indeed very fearless.\nChae…ae…aeng!\nThat was the sound of my sword blocking the sword she had suddenly swung. Now she’s even looking for chances to catch me off guard.\n“Is that all? It’s too easy.”\n“…”\nIt was a provocation that no one could ignore. Honestly, it wasn’t right to provoke someone who was learning swordsmanship for the first time. But that didn’t really apply to the villainess.\nAnyways, the villainess was sufficiently riled up by my provocation.\n“How about setting a penalty?”\n“Ha, a penalty? You really think you’re going to win?”\n“Yes, I am.”\n“…”\nShe fiercely stroked the sword. It was a silent threat. Do you want to intimidate me or kill me?\n“So, what is the penalty?”\n“How about a flick to the forehead?”\n“Eh, that’s it?”\n“Yes, it is.”\nIf the villainess laughed at me, it would be a yes, and if she frowned, I would take that as a no.\nWhen I looked at the villainess, she had a positive expression contrary to what she saying. She probably was imagining how hard she was going to hit me. That was made even clearer as she was even unwittingly wiggling her fingers and loosening her hands.\nStill I had to ask, “You don’t agree?”\n“No, I need to do that twice.”\nShe wanted to increased the penalty, as expected of a villainess. I gave her a nod of approval, and agreed to do it as she wished.\n“If you can manage to even scratch me within 10 minutes, it’s your win. If you can’t, it’s my win.”\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Shael nodded in agreement with my words. The villainess was surprisingly easy to fool. Did she really think she could win? I think it was because I had complimented her swordsmanship, saying that she was excellent, and gave her unfounded confidence. As expected, I can use my praise as a powerful weapon against the villainess.\nWhoop hoo…\nHeh, I wasn’t even ready yet. Shael really just swung her sword, not paying attention to my situation. Of course, the sword never reached me. It was the same for the following swings. When she swung her sword, I dodged. After repeating this for a dozen more times, we reached the time limit before I knew it.\n“Twenty minutes have passed, Shael.”\n“…”\nThe villainess silently approached me. It was time for her to take the punishment.\n“It may hurt a little.”\n“Don’t talk nonsense, do it quickly!”\nI punished her as she wished.\n“Jooh… that hurt so much!”\nShael resentfully complained to me. But so what? It was already spilled water. She accepted the bet and lost.\n“There is still one left.”\n“…”\nA louder sound than before was heard, and Shael glared at me while holding her forehead.\n“…”\n“The sound is quite clear.”\n“Haah… what?”\nIt wasn’t a compliment.\n“I meant that it seemed like there was nothing in your head.”\n“Let’s do it again.”\nShael said indignantly. Do you want to fight again?\n“How about three flicks this time?”\nI suggested to Shael, and she nodded her head without even thinking about it. Shael probably thought that she would win this time. I didn’t think she would accept it, to be honest. It was quite a mystery how the villainess’ mind worked. So, the sparring between Shael and I began again.\n“Ha!”\nThe result was obvious. Shael was defeated again. She covered her forehead and glared at me. She was giving me silent pressure, implying that she would kill me if I hit her hard. Of course, I couldn’t just let her have her way. Shael glared at me as she rubbed her forehead. I felt sorry for her, but I still wasn’t going to let her be.\n“What are you doing? We still have one more left.”\n“Ah…”\n“Aaagh!”\n****\nAfter practicing the swordsmanship, Shael followed Eran to her own room.\n‘Ah, my forehead is still sore. How is it possible to make it hurt so much with only one flick?’\nShael regretted making the bet. She had thought that she could win, and the she would do everything she could to cra*ck her fiancé’s forehead!\n“Looks like I’m going to have a hole in my forehead because of someone.”\n“That’s true. It’s a pity.”\n“…”\nShael vowed to sharpen her swordsmanship and win next time. The reason why she was able to make this resolution was also thanks to the fact that she really enjoyed learning swordsmanship. It was surprisingly not bad.\n‘I don’t know why. Is it because I might one day be able to cra*ck that guy’s forehead?’\nShe didn’t really know. All she could tell was that she enjoyed swordsmanship.\n“How could you hit your fiancé so hard?”\n“I properly adjusted the force.”\n“Don’t lie!”\nOtherwise, there was no way her forehead would still be so sore.\n“Would you like to get hit with a proper flick?”\n“…”\nThe villainess had no choice but to give in to Eran’s threats. But she had lots of time to get revenge in the future. She thought of the “Heavy Pollen” she had bought at the auction house. Heavy Pollen was something that made the body heavy.\nToday’s incident was just a ruse to draw Eran’s attention. So, she would definitely be able to win next time.\nWhile Shael thought about that, she silently walked alongside Eran.\nThey were walking from the Azbel family’s training ground to the Azbel family’s mansion. It was quite a distance. At the moment, Shael and Eran were on the path with flowers on both sides. It was also her favorite walkway.\nIt was the first time she had passed this place with Eran, her fiancé. She likes walking trails. She thought that if she came here with her goddamn fiancé, she would feel very bad.\nBut if she thought about how she felt right now…\nIt wasn’t a pleasant feeling. But it wasn’t as bad as she had thought.\n‘Is that because Eran is suitable for venting anger?’\nShe wasn’t sure how the things they did today become a way to vent her anger.\nShe was rather miffed by her fiancé. It was because recently she was feeling a completely unknown feeling. It was also a feeling she had been feeling a lot lately. And, she had that strange feeling whenever Eran would be around her. So, she tried to be mean to him.\n“Walk correctly, Eran!”\n“I am walking correctly. You should fix your eyes, Shael.”\n“…”\nShe canceled the evaluation where she thought that walking with Eran on this path wasn’t too bad. ‘\n‘Yes, going for a walk with my fiancé… feels more annoying than ever.’\nThe villainess complained as she stroked her forehead, which was still tingling.\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "A middle-aged man who had identical facial features as me was sitting on the other side of the dining table.\nIt was the Duke, Ezran Baslett.\nI was eating with him in an awkward atmosphere.\n‘I can’t eat properly.’\n‘Ah, it might be better to be with Shael. No, I’m sure it will.’\nEating in front of the father of the original owner of the body I possessed didn’t seem like something I could enjoy.\n“Eran, it sounds like there will be a banquet at the Mage Tower this time.”\n“A banquet at the Mage Tower, so you mean?”\n“Yes, it seems that the Mage Tower Lord has sent invitations.”\nI had no choice but to shake off my useless thoughts at once. Because I heard something very important.\nA banquet held at the Mage Tower. It was the stage of an incident that marked the beginning of the original novel. It was also an incident where Shael and the main character of the novel ran into each other. This was the reason why Shael harbored ill will toward the female lead. So, it was a rare opportunity to change the ending of Shael, the villainess in the novel.\nSo, I have to find a way somehow.\n***\n“I’m only saying this as a possibility. But, what if someone accidentally spills wine on you and stains your clothes?”\n“I will have to punish them.”\nI didn’t know what level of punishment the villainess was talking about. I only knew one thing. It was the fact that if I left her as she was, things would go the same way as it did in the original novel.\nThe heroine of the novel, Clie Ruspela, accidentally spills wine on the villainess, Shael Azbel. And as fate would have it, the villainess just happened to be wearing her favorite clothes on that occasion.\nIt was obvious what the villainess would do in that situation. She would insult Clie. She was a villainess who liked to harass even her own fiancé, who was one of the few people who truly cared for her. So, in a way, it was natural. Moreover, a commoner spilling wine on the daughter of a duke? It would be considered something unacceptable even if it was an accident.\nHowever, how could that commoner come to the banquet of the Mage Tower?\nThe reason was that the Mage Tower Lord had fallen in love with her at first sight. Even the crown prince, who had come disguised at the Mage Tower banquet, had a crush on the protagonist.\nThen how would things play out?\nThe villainess, Shael, would become a stepping stone for the heroine to stand out. The bad-tempered villainess was a powerful stepping stone that made the people sympathize with the protagonist.\nOf course, it was natural for Shael to be angry with the female lead, Clie. Any high-ranking noble would be angry if a commoner spilled wine on their clothes.\nHowever, in romanic fantasy novels, that fact was not important.\nThe target of the readers interest was Clie Ruspela, not Shael Azbel.\nIn the novel, everyone who came to the banquet at the Mage Tower pointed their fingers at Shael, saying that she was bullying Clie. This created a sense of mob mentality amongst the readers.\nNormally, it would’ve been unbelievable to do such a thing to the Azbel family’s precious daughter, but it was all made possible due to the absence of the Duke and Duchess Azbel.\nMore than anything else, the Mage Tower Lord, who held great power, was also on their side.\nPeople whispered, and even laughed at her when they saw Shael who had never danced before, dance improperly and unable to use magic even though she was from the Azbel family.\nPerhaps this was also the incident that forced Shael from the original novel properly learn magic. Of course, even that bit of magic was learned very roughly.\nConsidering how Shael hated learning magic, I could see how annoying this incident must have been to her. However, no readers except me paid attention to Shael. After that, Shael began to detest the heroine.\nThe Shael in the book began to walk the path of a typical villainess.\n‘Now, what can I do to prevent such a catastrophe?’\nIt was impossible to prevent her from going to the banquet of the Mage Tower. Because someone from the Azbel family’s lineage had to be present at the banquet in the Mage Tower.\nThe reason for that was that the Azbel family was famous for their high mana capacity. Of course, the Duke and Duchess of Azbel had to be be away for a political affair during this time as well. They wouldn’t be able to attend the banquet as they were traveling to distant provinces.\nIt was inevitable that Shael had to go to the banquet.\n‘Never, I will never be able to stop her from going there.’\nSo I had to prevent what Shael would experience at the banquet. The female protagonist will accidentally spill wine on Shael… I will be able to prevent that by sticking to her side.\nBut I don’t actually know what might happen. So I decided to prepare in advance so that Shael would not be laughed at. With that thought in mind, I said, “I heard that you are going to the banquet organized by the Mage Tower.”\n“I will do what I want.”\nOnly thorny words sprouted out from the villainess’s mouth. Apparently, she was able to sense something ominous. Well, her intuition was correct.\n“Let’s practice dancing, Shael.”\n“I don’t like it.”\nThe villainess hated dancing. Of course, I had something in my possession that was very persuasive.\n[Yes, I like you.]\n[I love you to death.]\n“…”\nShe looked at me as if she was going to eat the Serpent Orb whole.\n“I will use it until the day I die. So, please give up.”\nAt my statement, she had no choice but to get up.\nGoblin:\nI am going through a very stressful time in my life, so your support really helps a lot.

      "content": "We were at the Azbel family’s training ground again.\nShael’s eyes had a strange light, as if she was reliving the memory of the time where she had been flicked on the head by me. It was as if she was going to take revenge today. Anyway… I invited her to the dance.\n“Take my hand.”\nIt was an offer that would normally have been despised and rejected. However, Shael surprisingly did not refuse. No, rather she was grinning. It was a sign that Shael was about to start harassing me.\n‘What on earth are you so happy about?’\nShael held my hand. Unexpectedly, the feeling when I held her hand was new. It was quite cold.\nAnd… it was heavy.\nSince I was thinking about other things, Shael urged me on. It was a signal that probably meant, [Come on and teach me how to dance!]\n“Please follow my lead and move your feet in the same way.”\nShael did as I said and moved her feet after me. While dancing, a sound that was not expected in the situation echoed throughout the training ground. It was the sound of her heel hitting the ground.\n“What is this?”\n“What is this??”\nThe villainess answered my question with a question. It was a strange situation.\n‘Was it normal to hear that kind of sound when a person steps on the ground?’\nMoreover, the place she stepped on was right next to my feet. My foot was almost stepped on by the villainess!\n“Hmmnn. Let’s do that again.”\nWe resumed the dance, which had been forced to stop by Shael, who looked at me like an insane person.\n“…”\nThe sound of her heels stamping the ground continued to resonate. The place it hit was always right next to my feet. The villainess was clearly targeting me.\n‘Are you trying to pierce a hole in my foot?’\nFinally, the heavy vibrating sound started again.\nThe villainess stepped on the ground with all her might. She somehow seemed to think she would really be able to step on my foot.\n‘Of course, that not going to happen.’\nShe must have thought that she would hear my scream, but she heard something different.\nUdud… uk!\nIt was the sound of her heels breaking. The shoes must have been made by the attire mages of the Azbel family. The fact that it broke… proved just how much force she put into her feet.\n“Are you okay?”\n“No.”\nIt wasn’t because her leg was hurt when the shoe broke. The villainess seemed to be “not okay” in a different way. Yes, it was clear that she regretted not being able to step on my foot.\nI tried to lift Shael up from the ground, as I wanted to take her on the bench at the training ground.\nI tried to help her up, but I found it hard to my straighten my knees and almost collapsed.\nShe was ridiculously heavy!\nIt was then that a memory popped into my mind. It was a memory from the auction house. Yes, it was that Heavy Pollen or something. I remembered the auctioneer’s explanation.\n[This time it’s Heavy Pollen! When sprayed, the object temporarily gains weight. You can also secretly spray it on nasty people. Let’s start with 500,000 gold!]\n‘Aha, so you sprinkled that pollen on yourself!’\nIt was clear that the villainess herself had made her body heavy so that she could pierce a hole in my feet.\nShe must have asked the family mage to make sure that she herself would not be affected by the heavy weight. Come to think of it, she went somewhere for a while before coming to the dance practice.\nAfter thinking that far, I looked at Shael.\n“You’re heavy.”\n“I am light.”\n“You must have gained weight.”\nShael stood up and glared at me, ignoring the heel of her broken shoe.\n“Looking at it now, it seems that your figure has changed a little.”\n“…”\n“No, it seems to have changed a lot.”\nShael maintained her silence. Her expression became even colder than before. The expression on her face earlier was just because she was angry at being told that she looked like she had gained weight.\nBut not now.\nThe change in her figure was probably not due to the Heavy Pollen. She must be trying to convince herself that my words were lies. But so what? She had actually gained weight. Not enough to call her fat, but very slightly.\nPerhaps it was due to the food that she had consumed to relieve her accumulated stress. She, too, was aware of that fact.\n“Come to think of it, dancing is an excellent exercise for losing weight.”\n“…!”\nThat day, the villainess became my student and she learned to dance from me.\nThe villainess was surprisingly easy to handle.\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Mages belonging to the Mage Tower. They were treated the same as nobles.\nBecause only the very skilled mages could join to the Mage Tower. So it was only natural that they would be treated well.\nAmong them.. Aren Jaygers, the Lord of the Mage Tower, was a mage of great skill. He even once said that if the nobles bothered him, he would leave the empire at once. Even for the imperial family, it was not easy to touch him. Aren Jaygers possessed independent power through his overwhelming force.\nPeople often compared the power of the Mage Tower and the various dukes. The most common one amongst them was the Azbel family, a famous mage family. Of course, no one knew for sure.\nThe Azbel family had the Duke and Duchess of Azbel, who were excellent mages, and the Mage Tower, had the Mage Tower Lord. However, the power of the Mage Tower Lord was very mysterious. That’s why people secretly regarded the Mage Tower as more powerful than the Azbel family.\nSo what did the Mage Tower built by such a Mage Tower Lord look like?\n“This is the area where the Mage Tower is located.”\n“You had exaggerated it before, but it’s smaller than I thought.”\nShe looked at the tower and said.\n“It’s probably smaller than the Azbel family’s mansion. Shouldn’t it be at least bigger than that?”\n“That’s not the Mage Tower.”\n“…?”\nShael was looking at the wrong thing.\nThe size of the Mage Tower I pointed out was so huge that it couldn’t be compared to the Azbel family’s mansion that she boasted about just now. It was huge to the extent that it made me wonder how that was a even a tower.\n“Really, it’s size can’t be compared to the Azbel family’s mansion.”\nThat’s what I said.\n‘It was truly absurd!’\n“…”\nShael walked towards the Mage Tower without saying a word, her ears had turned red.\nThe Mage Tower was mysterious in a different way. There were many unique structures inside the tower as if to show the eccentric nature of the owner of the tower. We finally found the banquet hall after passing many of such structures .\n“That should be it, right?”\n“Let’s go.”\nI asked and Shael replied. She seemed to be bothered by the banquet. Well, the villainess had no social skills. The entirety of her human interactions were limited to me and the Duke and Duchess Azbel.\nShael stopped abruptly and looked at me.\n“…”\n“What is it?”\n“You seem to be thinking something strange.”\nThe villainess was strangely perceptive only at times like this.\n“I didn’t think anything that might be considered as such.”\n“Oh, is that so?”\nI had no time to give a reply. It was because someone was standing in front of Shael and me.\n“Eran Baslett and Shael Azbel. You are late.”\nThis person didn’t add honorifics before the name of the heirs of two dukes. He even spoke rude words about being late.\n‘Even though we aren’t late. Rather, we are early.’\nIt must have been a very long time before the banquet started. This person was just saying this to intimidate us. I could tell from the look on his face. He was looking at us with a very unwelcome expression.\nI looked at his face… it was quite a familiar face. It was because he was one of the people on the cover of the original novel. It was one of the main male characters in the original novel, Aren Jaygers.\nI was immediately convinced. If someone else was as strong as this person, they would be as arrogant as well. To the extent that they could afford to act in such a rude manner towards the heirs of the two dukes. I was about to greet the Mage Tower Lord. However, Shael was faster.\nShe said to the Mage Tower Lord.\n“You have no manners.”\n“What?”\nThe Mage Tower Lord questioned the villainess once again as if he hadn’t heard it clearly. There was no way the villainess would just let things go.\n“You dare…”\n“Ignorant.”\n“…!”\nThe villainess let out a sigh and passed by the Lord of the Mage Tower. The Mage Tower Lord glared at Shael as if he were going to kill her.\n‘Haah, it’s ruined.’\n“Then, we will be going. Have a good time, Aren Jaygers.”\n“…”\nHe silently glared at me even after my courteous greeting. It seemed that being with Shael had made the Mage Tower Lord hate me as well. Well, for now, I should just follow Shael.\n“You’d better stop!”\nThe Mage Tower Lord made me stop. Feeling somewhat uneasy, I immediately looked at the the Mage Tower Lord.\nMagical power was gathering in his hands. It was something that should be seen just before someone was preparing to use magic.\nThe Mage Tower lord, Aren Jaygers. He was a cold, and obsessive character. The kind which usually appeared in romantic fantasy novels. So in other words, he had a very nasty personality.\nHow could one of the main characters have a personality so nasty that he would resort to violence for such an insignificant matter?\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Actually, it’s very simple.\nIn the novel, the male lead only needed to be nice to the female lead. Rather, that duality became one of Aren’s charms that made him interesting for the readers. Fortunately, the Mage Tower Lord erased his magic.\nIt wasn’t because I had looked back. It was because the only existence that could stop the lord of the Mage Tower had come.\n“Ah, Mage Tower Lord?”\nIt was the female protagonist, Clie Ruspela.\nThe Mage Tower Lord, who was glaring at Shael and me as if he wanted to kill us, showed a smile. It was a completely different expression from before.\n“You’re not feeling well, so why are you here, Clie?”\n“Oh, it’s okay!”\nCough!\nClie coughed. Clie was the female protagonist who was terminally ill all her life. It was a setting often seen in romantic fantasy novels. Of course, also like a romantic fantasy novel, her ending was good. Because Shael, the villainess, would die… and Clie, who was terminally ill, would live.\nAren Jaygers approached Clie and hurriedly took her somewhere else.\n“She seems fake.”\nShael looked at them and said to me.\nBut surprisingly, it was true. Clie actually faked her own cough. It was possible that she must have come to take the Mage Tower Lord away because of the prince who had come to the banquet in disguise. So yes, her cough was not due to her illness.\nYou might think she’s a selfish protagonist… but that’s also one of the reason behind the novel’s huge popularity.\nIt was Shael’s rude words that woke me up from my thoughts.\n“We came too early.”\nThat was what she said as soon as she arrived at the banquet hall. It seemed that the villainess was angry. Since we had arrived too early, there were only a few people in the banquet hall. But this was all intentional.\nAnyways, it didn’t really matter. The Mage Tower with its eccentric owner… had all sorts of things to enjoy that didn’t match its name.\n“Please follow me.”\nShael followed me just to kill her time.\nThe inside of the huge Mage Tower looked as if a festival was being held. Many people were enjoying their leisure time in various kinds of shops.\n“What is that?”\nIt was only now that the villainess showed some interest. She pointed at a shooting range. It was a store where you could take the doll if you manage to hit it with an arrow.\n“Would you like to try it?”\nShael nodded her head and grabbed the bow.\n“I didn’t know you would like something like this.”\n“I thought it would be good if I practiced my archery skills.”\nShael answered me while drawing the bowstring.\nI immediately understood what Shael was talking about. Because she was staring at the doll as fiercely as she usually looked at me.\nThen, the sound of a doll being torn apart by the arrow she had shot was heard. It was, of course, where the doll’s eyes were.\n“You are cruel.”\nShe grinned and handed me the doll.\n‘It wasn’t a compliment.’\n“This is a gift, keep it.”\nShael was about to throw the doll on the floor, but as if she had an idea, she handed me a doll with a torn eye.\nThe first gift I received from the villainess was a doll with torn eyes. After I had no choice but to accept the doll, Shael went looking for other things to enjoy.\nWhat caught her attention this time was the place where one had to catch fish. In a moderately sized fishery, several catfish were released. It was a place meant to experience fishing.\n“Are you going to fish?”\nThe villainess nodded her head. As expected, I couldn’t figure out the villainess’s thoughts at all.\nShael threw the fishing line. I also sat down next to her and threw a fishing line. A catfish came and bit the bait.\nThe bait belonged to Shael. As soon as she started, she managed to catch one.\nSplash!\nTwo.\nSplash!\nAnd three.\nIt was way different from me who couldn’t catch even one. The villainess had talent in strange places!\n“Pugh, you can’t catch a single fish properly!”\nBefore long, Shael started to tease me. Shael pointed to my fishing line, which hadn’t been touched by the fish even once, and laughed. There was no way I could stand still after that!\n“Oh, yes. I see that you’re popular with catfish.”\n“…”\n“So you can get engaged to those catfish, not me.”\n“Haa. What do you mean?”\nIt was a catfish that answered Shael’s bewildered words.\nSplash!\n“Hey, it’s quite the strong one, it will be perfect as a groom.”\nShael could only glare at me.\nIt was fortunate though. Unlike my expectations, Shael genuinely seemed to enjoy this experience.\n‘Although there were some strange quarrels.’\nIf I successfully maintain the current situation…\n‘I will be able to prevent the tragic incident at the banquet hall without any problems.’\nI took Shael and headed to the banquet hall.\n***\nChang!\nI looked back at the ominous sound.\nA wine glass had shattered on the floor. It was the wine glass that the female protagonist, Clie, was holding.\nAnd in front of her… was Shael. Her clothes were stained with red wine.\n‘Oh, it’s ruined.’\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

I was taking care of one of my close relatives at the hospital and wasn't really in the right psychological condition. I will be releasing an extra chapter to make up for my mistake. I hope you understand.\nThe banquet at the MageTower was held over two days. Today was the first day of the banquet, and the banquet had just begun.\nIn the banquet hall, there were only people who had aristocratic background.\nMe and Shael were quietly keeping to ourselves in the corner. Shael was just annoyed, and I was there to somehow prevent conflict between Shael and the female protagonist.\nOf course, we couldn’t stay still like that for long.\nIt was because the Mage Tower Lord, Aren Jaygers, found us and approached us.\n“What are you doing?”\nI hurriedly approached the Mage Tower Lord and asked. I did that because Shael was about to open her mouth, and nothing good would come out every time he opened her mouth. I had expected that he would react violently as soon as he saw me, but the Mage Tower Lord seemed calmer than I thought.\nNo, rather he was smiling.\nIt was strange. Where did that Mage Tower Lord, who had such a terrible personality, go?\nRight at that moment, an ominous sound forced me to stop thinking.\nChang… crang!!!\nI looked back at the ominous sound. There was a broken wine glass on the floor.\nThe female protagonist, Clie, was lying face down on the floor. And… Shael’s clothes were red from wine.\n“Oh, that! Sorry! Sorry!”\n“…”\nIt happened within just a few seconds of the Mage Tower Lord approaching me.\n‘No, how could it be like that? It doesn’t make sense!’\nShael looked down at Clie, and said, “You did it on purpose.”\n“Eh, it wasn’t intentional! The floor is very slippery. I… I’ll help you get a new outfit from the dressing room!”\nThe Azbel family’s Lady Shael and the Mage Tower Lord’s eyes were pasted on Clie. However, the eyes of the other people at the banquet hall were focused on the two of them. Of course, it was a great blunder to spill wine on Shael, who was reputed to be a cruel villainess. It was a situation where every were waiting to see what would happen next.\nCough!\nIt was exactly at that moment that Clie coughed again. It was also at a point when she needed people’s attention. As if she wanted to arouse people’s sympathy.\nSomething was strange. No matter how pretentious the female protagonist Clie was in the original novel, it wasn’t to this extent.\nShe made mistakes, and kept coughing only in opportunistic moments. It certainly wasn’t something that a normal person would do.\nThen, the Mage Tower Lord in front of me moved. He walked over to Clie’s side. Shael coldly glared at the Mage Tower Lord. It was a situation where anyone could tell that the two were not on good terms.\nA completely unexpected thing happened at the very moment when I was thinking that something big might happen.\nThe ill-tempered Mage Tower Lord actually lowered his head!\n“I should have taken good care of the floor. I apologize.”\nShael just silently looked at the Mage Tower Lord.\nI couldn’t help but stare at him in bewilderment as well. That bad tempered Mage Tower Lord lowered his head? Even if it was for the sake of the female protagonist, it was really strange.\n“Apologizing by merely lowering your head? Get down on your knees!”\nThen, the Mage Tower Lord knelt down, without hesitation!!!\nPeople gasped for breath.\nIt was nonsense! That Mage Tower Lord knelt down on his knees?\nHowever, the truth was immediately apparent. People who were present immediately began to whisper some things about Shael. The Mage Tower Lord was instigating the people.\nI concentrated my magic and listened to what people were saying. I could hear people say that Shael made the Mage Tower Lord kneel down just because someone ruined her clothes. What followed was that people confirmed that Shael Azbel had a vicious personality.\nMost of these were words from the mages of the Mage Tower. Before things got even worse, I took Shael’s hand and led her away.\n“Come, Shael.”\nFortunately, Shael followed my advice. Or maybe, she was waiting for those words.\nShael and I walked silently until everyone was out of sight.\n***\n“Are you okay?”\n“What is it? I am fine.”\nUnexpectedly, the villainess looked calm. It was different from when she was trying hard to not lose to me. On the contrary, maybe that’s why, Shael didn’t seem the same. I didn’t know if she was really okay, but…\n“Puh, pouhh…”\nShael suddenly laughed.\n‘Was she really that shocked by what happened earlier?’\nIt was something that would definitely upset the villainess. Before the banquet, she got into a fight with the Mage Tower Lord, and during the banquet, her clothes were stained with wine, and people cursed at her. Moreover, she was forced to leave the banquet. It was a situation that would make anyone angry.\n“Ah, I feel much better now.”\nI couldn’t understand Shael’s behavior at all. Was she really upset? She did understand that she had suffered, right? No matter how ignorant the villainess was there’s no way she didn’t know that.\nAs I was looking at Shael with a puzzled expression, she spoke to me.\n“Look at this.”\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Previously, I accidentally posted the wrong chapter by mistake. I was in the hospital at the time, and the situation was quite stressful. Anyways, I would like to make up for it by posting this extra chapter. I hope you understand.\nWhat Shael gave me was a purchase certificate. It was something familiar. It was something I had seen at the auction house where she had bought a lot of strange things.\n“The Pill of Lies? Did you buy this again? No, where are getting that much money?”\nShael nodded her head.\n“And I fed it to him.”\n“No way…”\nI immediately understood who she had given the pills to.\n“Yes, I fed it to the Mage Tower Lord.”\n“…”\nThen, the reason why the Mage Tower Lord bowed his head and knelt down to Shael…\n‘It wasn’t to incite the people to curse at Shael?’\nI thought it was kind of strange at first. It was because no matter how there was a reason, I couldn’t understand why the Mage Tower Lord had to kneel. But when I heard that Shael fed him the pills, I was dumbfounded.\n‘She… she did something ridiculous!’\nThen, Shael asked, “Why did the Mage Tower Lord fail to detect something that even you could do?”\n“The Mage Tower Lord only uses combat magic.”\nThat was the unique trait of the Mage Tower Lord, Aren Jaygers. He had no interest in anything other than combat magic and earth-type magic that he learned to build the Mage Tower.\nThe Pill of Lies was at such a level that even a person who had just awakened to magic could detect it if he knew how to use detoxification magic. However, the Mage Tower Lord had no knowledge of detoxification magic. He only used combat magic.\nPersonally, I didn’t understand why the hell that kind setting had to exist, but there was indeed a reason for it. In romanic fantasy novels, the qualities of the main characters must be appealing to the readers. That setting was added to make one of the male protagonists, the Mage Tower Lord, susceptible to all sorts of strange dru*gs.\nIt was clear that the setting that the Mage Tower Lord could only use combat magic was in play in this situation as well.\nThinking back, the Mage Tower Lord’s body was trembling when he knelt down before Shael. It must have been because it was something he absolutely hated doing.\nI suddenly felt very sorry for the Mage Tower Lord. As expected, the villainess was evil.\n“So, I’m fine.”\nShael’s expression remained calm. She must’ve thought that since she succeeded in taking revenge on the\nMage Tower Lord, it was okay for her to have wine on her clothes or to be cursed at by people.\nHowever, it felt strange to me.\nWasn’t it strange that she was suddenly just okay with her favorite clothes getting stained and being cursed at by others?\nEven though Shael’s expression looked calm, her tone seemed different from usual. Contrary to her words and expression, it must be because she was also slightly offended.\n“But, I’m not okay.”\n“Why are you…”\nShe couldn’t finish what she was about to say. Because she couldn’t help but be surprised at what I had handed over to her.\n“What is this?”\n“This is a gift.”\nWhat I handed over to the villainess was a doll. It was just a normal doll. It was also the doll Shael gave me at the shooting range the other day. Its eye was torn by an arrow and for some reason Shael gave it to me. However, the doll’s eyes were now sewn in strange shapes. The reason for that was… I wasn’t very good at sewing.\nWhen Shael stopped by the dressing room, I quickly bought the necessary items and sewed the eyes.\n“…?”\n“Didn’t you give the doll you wanted to me because its eye was torn?”\nShael received the doll and watched it carefully. Then she said, “It’s sloppy. It looks ugly.”\nAnyway, the villainess had no common courtesy. She was able to spit out those thorny words to the person who gave her a gift.\n“And, it does have some resemblance?”\n“Are you referring to me?”\nShael smiled and looked at me.\n“Yes.”\n“Is this a compliment or an insult?”\n“I’ll be sure to use it to relieve my stress.”\nShael gave the wrong answer to my question. Then she abruptly said. “Oh, didn’t you say that I’m popular with catfish?”\n“Yes?”\nI did say that.\n[Oh, yes. I see that you’re popular with catfish.]\nI said that because she was making fun of me for not being able to catch a fish. But why was she bringing that up now all of a sudden?\n“Now that I think about it, I think it really is like that.”\n“Yes?”\nDid she realize what kind of nonsense she was spouting? Did she really admit that she was popular with catfish just now?\n“My fiance also looks like a catfish.”\n“…”\nShael was insulting me again.\nAnyway, the villainess was indeed quite narrow-minded. Was she still hung up on the things from yesterday?\nAfter she said that to me, Shael seemed to feel relieved as she walked away. That said, there was no way I could remain quiet at the current situation!\n“Is that so? Come to think of it, there is a saying that married couples look alike.”\n“What nonsense are you talking about all of a sudden?”\n“I am saying that you look like a catfish too.”\nThere was no way she could defeat me. Because I was also quite narrow-minded.\nI was the same as the villainess.\nGoblin:\nIntroducing RTV Level 2.

      "content": "The reason Shael had to attend the banquet at the Mage Tower was because of the long running contract between the Azbel family and the Mage Tower.\nThe Mage Tower would provide magic tools to the Azbel family, and in return, the Azbel family had to send a member from their lineage to attend the banquet at the Mage Tower. It was to suppress the curse placed on the Mage Tower using the presence of the lineage of the Azbel family, a famous family of powerful mages.\nThe suppression of the curse usually takes place on the second day of the banquet. So the banquet would also continue to the next day. Therefore, Shael has to attend the banquet tomorrow as well. It also meant that she would have to spend time in the Mage Tower until tomorrow.\n“What would you like to do?”\n“Let’s take a walk first.”\nShael looked like she was troubled, then she started walking around aimlessly. However, she suddenly stopped when she saw a huge building. It was the library of the Mage Tower. Shael was looking at that place.\n“Would you like to spend some time here?”\n“Yes.”\nShael answered without hesitation and then entered the library.\nThe Mage Tower’s library was more normal than I thought. The reason I thought that was because even outsiders could also use it. The books related to magic were only basic. Rather, there were many other types of books. I could see books on philosophy that usually wouldn’t fit in a place called the Magic Tower’s library, and it even had novels for simple entertainment.\nUnlike me, who thought there were nothing to read, Shael picked up a book without much hesitation. It was as if she had already decided on a book she wanted to read. She started reading the book after covering the cover of the book with another book. It looked very suspicious.\n“What kind of book is it that you have to cover it up like that?”\n“Don’t be needlessly curious.”\n‘Isn’t it natural that it would make me want to see it even more if you say that?’\nAbove all, she might be up to something strange. If she gets into some serious trouble at the Mage Tower, she might suffer a huge blow.\n‘No, I’m certain that she would get into some serious trouble.’\nWe have to rule out even the slightest possibility so that such a thing wouldn’t happen!\nI used Vision Magic on Shael’s back. It was a magic that created a virtual mirror and helped the user to see from the back of the target. I looked at the contents of the book she was reading.\n[Drink a lot of water. It’s one of the easiest looking yet surprisingly difficult ones. It is one of the essential elements to lose weight.]\nShael nodded her head slightly as if she understood while looking at the book. It was a book that I hadn’t really imagined she could read. When we were practicing our dance, I had said to Shael that she seemed to have gained weight. I hope she wasn’t doing it because of that…\nShael closed the book. Then she pulled out another book. It was a book called\n[100 Exercises to Develop Finger Strength]\nWhen I thought about why she had brought out this book all of a sudden, I immediately found the reason.\nTaaagh!\nI thought back to that fierce and clear sound. It was the sound Shael made when I flicked her on the forehead. It seemed that for Shael, getting flicked on the forehead by me was a matter of great humiliation. So now she seemed to be preparing for revenge, as she looked at the book with blazing eyes.\n[Repeat squeezing and stretching your hand 100 times.]\nIt was a sentence from the book she was reading.\nShael put her hands under the desk. She must’ve wanted to hide it from me. Of course, I was able to see her hand through the Vision Magic. Shael started wiggling both of her hands. It looked a bit funny. She repeated squeezing and stretching her hand as the book said. Of course, it was a little different from the book.\nShe repeated it ten times the number mentioned in the book— a whopping 1,000 times!\nAfter doing that, the villainess calmed her breath little by little so that I wouldn’t notice it. It was a testament to how much effort the villainess was putting into her revenge.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Why are you suddenly asking that?”\n“I’m done.” Shael stood up. She then spoke up as if she was asking me to follow her, “I need to drink some water.”\nDrink water. It was the method she had read in the book about losing weight. She was following the contents of the book she had just read.\nI handed her some water.\nGulp…gulp..gulp!\nShael continued to drink water. After all, she always did things excessively. Even when she was doing her hand squeezing and stretching exercises, she had casually jumped over the recommended amount in the book. Anyway, the villain didn’t know restraint. So I had to tell her.\n“Drinking too much can have adverse side effects. Trying to lose weight like that can actually harm your health.”\nI also suggested that I had seen the contents of the book she was reading as an added bonus. It was to put a little emphasis on my words. Because the villainess had to know that ‘I knew’.\nThe villainess was taken aback by my words.\n“No way?”\nIt must have been because I said that I had read the contents of the book.\n“It is good to exercise with restraint. It’s not good for your joints.”\nThe following words affirmed her doubts to some extent.\n“…”\nShael walked away in silence. Surprisingly, she didn’t get angry. It must have been due to the shame she was feeling right now. Indeed, it would be quite embarrassing if I did that with my hands 1000 times in front of other people.\nThe villainess’ face was red as she walked away in silence.\nGoblin:\nIntroducing\nRTV Level 2\n.

      "content": "The Mage Tower had a somewhat unique setting.\nAt night, outsiders were not allowed to move freely inside the Mage Tower. It was because of the curse it had received from the demons. Aside from the people who had learned the special magic of the Mage Tower, only the truly strong who were adept at handling magic were free from the curse of the Mage Tower.\nOtherwise, normal people would lose some of their senses, which included— sight, hearing, and even smell. Moreover, if they remain affected by it for a long time, they might even lose their senses forever. The setting in the novel was that the demons had so much resentment against Aren Jaygers that all the high-ranking demons cursed the Mage Tower in exchange for their lives.\nYou might think that this was a ridiculous setting, but it was also a setting created by the writer of a romantic fantasy novel. Perhaps they did it to develop the story of the Mage Tower Lord and the female protagonist.\nThat setting was also harmful for Shael. It was because she, who had the Azbel family’s magical power, had to visit the Mage Tower. She had to do it because the Azbel family’s magical power itself suppressed the demon’s curse. But why didn’t Aren, the Mage Tower lord, just move the Mage Tower to another location even though it was under such a curse?\nIt was exactly because Aren, the Mage Tower Lord was a very eccentric character. The setting made it so, and it would continue like that. Anyway, that’s why outsiders had to stay in designated rooms during their night at the Mage Tower.\nThe special magic of the Mage Tower was cast on the rooms so that the outsiders would be protected from the curse that could deprive them of their senses.\nMe and Shael were also following the guide and heading to the room that the Mage Tower Lord had designated for us.\n“Here it is. If you need anything, you can call me by pressing this button here. And as you know, you should never go out during the night.”\nThis was also because of the curse. Shael and I tried to enter the room. But I had to stop. Why did they guide both of us to the same room?\n“Are we supposed to stay in the same room?”\n“Yes? They were allotted according to what the Mage Tower Lost has instructed. Is there a problem?”\nThe guide responded at Shael’s words in bewilderment.\n“Please let me sleep in a different room from this person.”\n“Sorry. All accommodations are already full.”\n“This Mage Tower should be very big.”\nThis was also one of the setting for that damn novel. There were not many rooms in the Mage Tower. I don’t even know the reason why. If I had to guess, it must have been because of the chapter in which the Crown Prince, who had come secretly in disguise was beaten up due to the lack of rooms.\nThat was the setting that the writer had forcefully put in place in order to achieve that purpose.\n“The curse begins in 5 minutes. I think you should use this place for now.”\n“Then, go.”\nShael had no choice but to accept and told the guide to leave.\n“Basta*d.”\nPerhaps she was cursing the the Mage Tower Lord. No, I was pretty sure it was like that\n“Basta*d.”\nI think this was the first time that curse had come out of Shael’s mouth. Apparently, the villainess seemed to have learned a new curse word!\nShael headed for the door.\nKikiiik…\nIt was the sound of Shael opening the door.\nKoo-ung!\nThen she closed it again.\n“Why is there… only one room?”\n“…”\nIt seemed that Shael was firing some swear words at the Mage Tower Lord again.\nKikiiik…\nI opened the door that Shael had closed. It was because the curse of the Mage Tower would begin soon. It was a decent sized room. It was smaller than Shael’s room, but that was because Shael’s room way too large.\nThe Mage Tower Lord treated us better than I thought. The room was cleaner than expected. It almost made me wonder if it was the same Mage Tower Lord, who had the personality of a mad dog who even tried to use magic to attack Shael. He seemed to be a person with some common sense?\nIt might be because at tomorrow’s banquet, he would need the Azbel’s family’s, or more specifically Shael’s help. But if I think about it again… the Mage Tower Lord wasn’t a person who would care about such things.\n‘Ah, is it because of the Pill of Lies? Maybe he tried to assign some strange room and then said the opposite.’\nAnyway, there was food on the table, and books for leisure on the bookshelf. There were even magic tools for other conveniences.\n“…”\n“…”\nBut why was there only one bed?\nGoblin:\nIntroducing\nRTV Level 2\n.

      "content": "I looked at the bed.\nShael also stared blankly at the bed. Then she wrinkled her forehead and said, “I want to leave.”\n“No. The curse of the Mage Tower has already begun.”\nIt was as I said, the curse of the Mage Tower had already begun. Even if the Azbel family’s magical power could suppress the magic tower’s curse, that and her being cursed were two different things. Because Shael, who had only recently learned magic, was extremely lacking in magic skills.\n“I don’t care!”\nKikiiik…\nIt was the sound of Shael opening the door as she left her room.\nI had no choice but to follow her. My vision slowly got dark. My sense of hearing also diminished. However, I was able to regain my senses again through my magic. Of course it also consumed a huge amount of mana, so, I could only keep it up for a very short time.\nThump!\nIt was the sound of Shael hitting her head against the wall when she lost her sight. It sounded like it was incredibly painful.\n“Eh…”\nI quickly grabbed Shael’s hand, that she was using to cover her head in confusion and dragged her towards the room. Fortunately, I was able to enter the room before my mana was exhausted.\n“Are you okay?”\n“No. I feel sick in my stomach.”\nShael struggled to speak. Her breathing was strained and she was gasping for air.\nOf course, I was also quite spent. It was near impossible for even experienced guides to guide someone in the Mage Tower by holding their hands. Because they too would lose their senses at some point.\nIt was the same with teleportation magic. The inside of the Mage Tower was very wide. A clear destination must be prepared in advance before traveling long distances with teleportation magic. If you use teleportation magic without a clear goal, you’d just end up wandering around the Mage Tower, and losing your senses in the end.\nShael must have realized that, and she let out a sigh. Then she looked at the bed and said.\n“I have never slept without a bed.”\nThat was natural. Shael had grown up lacking nothing all her life. So she would never give up the right to sleep on the bed here as well. She was actually trying to get me to concede.\nBut would it be right for me to give up just because of that? No, it was natural not to do so.\n“Me too.”\nIt contained the meaning that I would not yield!\nShael pouted, as if she was annoyed. It was because Shael also knew how stubborn I could be. Although she could be quite stubborn as well, I would not lose to her.\n“What do you want to do first?”\nI changed the subject. It was too early to go to sleep anyway.\n“How about sleeping?”\n“Isn’t it too early to go to sleep?”\nShael awkwardly nodded her head.\n“Ah, it’s too early to go to sleep.”\nThe villainess answered with a flustered expression. Apparently, Shael felt ashamed at the matter of going to bed early. I couldn’t understand the villainess’ way of thinking as usual. But wasn’t it a bit strange if someone had a habit of sleeping this early? Even children stayed awake till this time.\nThe villainess sure does sleep a lot. As I looked at Shael strangely, she pointed at something and said.\n“What is that?”\nWhat Shael pointed out was a bundle of cards. It was a game in which each player would hold two bomb cards and ten normal cards, and then each player had to drew and discard each other’s cards. In that way, the first person to lose all the bomb cards would be the winner. It was a good way to pass the time.\n“How about we place a bet. The loser gets flicked on the head?”\n“…!”\nShael nodded her head as if she had been waiting for that. She then started passing out cards.\n“Mmm!”\nShael coughed. As soon as my gaze went to her mouth, she swapped one of her bomb cards with a normal card. She was obviously cheating.\nThen she said. “Let’s do it in threes.”\n“Yes. Let’s do that.”\nOf course, she never won. It was thanks to the Vision Magic that I had been using since earlier.\nOriginally, I would have done it in a fair way, but didn’t Shael also cheat?\nThuttt!\n“Aaah!”\nIt was a clear, crisp sound that showed just how empty her head was.\n***\n“Oh, I should be able to sleep well now.”\nIt was still not the time to sleep. But it seemed that the villainess had reached her limit.\nShael lay down on the bed. She was a very quick to do that. She must have done that to claim the bed before me.\nOf course, I also lay down next to her.\n“What are you doing?”\n“I am going to sleep. Is there a problem?”\n“No.”\nShael didn’t even glare at me. It must be because she was aware of what would follow.\n“Could it be that you want to sleep on that cold floor?”\nActually, the floor wasn’t that cold. But, there was no way the villainess would accept that.\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "“Haah. You should sleep on the floor.”\n“That is what I want to say.”\nShael raised her body from the bed and said, “I might get sick if I sleep on the cold floor”\nYes she could, but I couldn’t just give up like that. I would feel a bit bad if that happened. But, considering that I had healing magic, it wouldn’t be a big deal even if she really got sick. Anyway, what I had to do now was to provoke this villainess. Honestly, this seemed quite amusing.\nTo make the villainess do what I wanted, I had to provoke her.\n“I will sleep on this warm and soft bed. You can go down to the floor and sleep if you’re bothered”\n“…”\nShael laid her body back on the bed. She decided not to run away from my provocation.\nShe was indeed a villainess.\n“Don’t cross over this line.” Shael said as she wrapped herself in a blanket.\nIt was right next to where I was lying, and she occupied more than half of the bed. That was so unfair!\n‘Then wouldn’t it be okay to claim more space for myself?’\nI immediately moved my body so that I would cross the line she had set for me. It was very close to the villainess.\n“What, what are you doing!”\n“What’s the problem?”\nI confidently asked what the problem was. Shael glared at me. But she couldn’t help but turn her head in surprise, considering just how close we were.\n“Ha.”\nThe villainess seemed to have given up on this matter. But that wasn’t the end. The blanket was also another necessary resource I had to fight for. However, the villainess was taking it all by herself. The villainess was indeed a greedy woman. So, I pulled on part of the blanket she was covering herself with.\n“What is it this time!?”\n“Shouldn’t I also cover myself with a blanket?”\nSo this was the current situation—- Shael and I were in the same bed, covering each other with the same blanket. If anyone saw us, they might think we looked like a loving couple. Additionally, we seemed like a couple who would tell each other to dream about ourselves.\n“I hope you appear in my dream.”\nYeah, exactly like that! But something was strange. Those lovely words came from a place that didn’t suit them at all. Those were the words that the villainess had uttered. However, the words Shael immediately added were indeed the words suitable for a villainess.\n“… a dream in which you are crying because you were being bullied by me.”\nIt seemed that Shael wanted to take revenge in her dream. Then, as if another thought had come to her mind, she added.\n“Oh, and you should have a dream when I haunt you.”\nEverybody knew what would happen after that. So, I also told her.\n“Then you get beaten up by me.”\n“…”\nShael went silent. She wasn’t glaring at me as usual. She seemed to be asleep. She just went to bed and fell asleep. Wasn’t that too strange? Anyway, her sleeping posture looked a bit strange as well.\nShe was hugging something.\n‘What the hell are you hugging?’\nI turned around, and got up to check what it was. She was actually cuddling and sleeping with that doll. It was the doll she gave to me. It was the doll that I gave back to her after stitching its torn out eyes.\nAnd now, she was sleeping while hugging it. Adding to that, when the villainess slept, she unexpectedly didn’t seem like a villainess at all. However, when I saw the expression on her face, I almost laughed out loud.\nThe villained had a frown on her face even when she was sleeping.\nI raised the corner of Shael’s mouth and made her smile.\n‘Why do you have the face of a villainess even when you sleep?’\n“Much better!”\nSmile, not scorn. It suited Shael more than I thought.\nAt the moment, she didn’t seem like a villainess at all.\n***\n“Then you get beaten up by me.”\n“…”\nShael closed her eyes in response to Eran’s words. She was pretending to sleep. It was because it seemed like it would never end if she continued to reply to Eran’s words.\nYes, it absolutely wasn’t because she was sleepy.\nThen she heard a rustle. It was the sound of Eran getting out of bed. He slowly approached Shael. The reason he was doing that must have been to make sure she was really sleeping. Shael relaxed her face and stayed still. But she couldn’t help but frown in the end.\nIt was because she felt embarrassed to show Eran the doll she was currently hugging.\n‘Wouldn’t I look like a child?’\nBut she had to smile. It was because Eran raised the corner of her mouth that was pointing down.\n“Much better.” Eran said that. He looked at her smile and uttered those words.\n‘Is my smile really beautiful?’\nShael didn’t know.\n‘No.’\nShael never got complimented for her smile. She was only praised for her pretty face.\nIn fact, it was because Shael had never shown her smile to anyone else. However, there was no way Shael would know that.\nShe just thought in her heart,\n‘My fiancé is really weird.’\nThat was her conjecture.\nIt was truly a wrong conjecture.\nGoblin:\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Shael stretched her arms and got up. Then, she turned her neck as usual.\n“Ah.”\nHer fiancé was lying next to her.\nContrary to the strange looks he gave her for sleeping so much last night, Eran himself was still sleeping.\n“Wake up!”\nHe didn’t even move. It seemed like it would take quite a while for him to wake up.\nOf course, she wouldn’t bother to wait for that.\nShe put her finger close to Eran’s forehead and prepared to flick it. But she suddenly stopped.\n“Mmm…”\nShael removed her hand and began to practice fingers. She did the same for her wrists.\nWhen she thought that it was good enough. She put her finger close to Eran’s forehead like before.\nTuck!\nIt was a quieter sound than when Eran had flicked her forehead. And, she even did it with all her might.\nAs she was preparing for the next flick, unfortunately Eran woke up.\n“What is it?”\n“Wake up. I woke up a while ago.”\nActually, it happened a little while ago. Shael was just spewing out lies, naturally.\nEran raised his body. He stretched her out with a bewildered look.\n“You’re lazy.”\n“Ah, yes.”\nEran casually answered and got up from the bed. Apparently, he felt it was unfair that she had flicked on his forehead.\nBut that was a matter of great happiness for Shael.\nShe was in a good mood. It was a good way to start her day.\nEran suddenly grinned. He was looking at the stack of cards they played with yesterday.\nHe was probably planning to beat her up again using that a card game. It was clear to see.\nBecause his eyes were stuck on Shael’s forehead.\n“Do you want to play yesterday’s card game again?”\nShael pondered for a moment. Yesterday’s memory of flashed back into her mind. That alone made her forehead ache.\nBut she didn’t want to run away!\n“Yes, I will.”\nAt that, Eran opened his hand wide. Shael could understand the meaning.\nFive flicks.\nIt was a very big bet. If she got hit by all of that, she wouldn’t have any forehead left.\nHowever, when she considered the opposite case, it would be a very happy outcome as well.\nTherefore, Shael nodded her head.\nSeeing her nod, Eran grabbed the bundle of cards. But Shael quickly snatched them up.\nShe would be the one to split the cards!\n“I will split.”\n“Yes, go ahead.”\nShael split the cards. She now had one card in her hand. Eran had two cards. This was a battle that she had to win!\n‘I just lost yesterday because I had bad luck.’\nHer stupid fiancé. He was confident that he would win.\nNot knowing that Shael had one bomb card in her hand.\nShael stopped the corner of her mouth from curving up as she tried to stay calm. She was trying to catch her fiancé off guard.\nEverything was perfect!\nShe was determined to completely crush Eran. If you’re cheating, you have to do it flawlessly.\nWhen Eran was about to draw his own cards in the middle of the game. She tossed her own bomb card into the discard pile.\nEran didn’t notice as he was stupidly absorbed in the game.\n“This is my victory!”\n“Ah.”\nSeeing the discarded bomb card, Eran gulped. He was worried about his forehead.\nShael started to loosen up her hands again.\n“…”\nEran was unexpectedly quiet, as if he was watching something strange…\n‘Are you feeling intimidated just from watching me loosen my hands?’\nIt must have been quite intimidating for him. However, Shael quickly erased that thought.\nThe only thing that mattered to her was being able to flick Eran on his forehead.\nShael vigorously flicked.\nAck!\nEran still had his eyes closed. It was only natural considering that she still had four flicks left.\nShael waited for the right time. It was something she had learned from the numerous beatings she had received from Eran.\nIt hurt the most when you aren’t prepared for the flick!\nEran opened his eyes, wondering why Shael had suddenly stopped.\nNow!\nDaaak!\nAaah!\nShael laughed heartily. It was a feeling of immense joy. It was a happy thing for her that she could make her fiancé frown like that.\n“I still have one left.”\nThis was also something she had heard from Eran.\nAaagh!!\n“It hurts!”\nEran grabbed his forehead. Shael ignored Eran’s words and spoke.\n“Then let’s go now.”\n“Yes.”\nShael and Eran finished their preparations. Shael gave her doll to Eran. Same for her other luggage.\n“Carry it for me.”\nGoblin:\nIt’s storm season right now so please excuse some delays due to power outage.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "She did it because it was heavy.\nBut Eran, who would normally have objected and confronted her, obediently lifted the luggage.\n“…?”\nShael felt doubtful. Eran’s behavior had changed.\n‘Has my fiancé finally surrendered to me? I needed to check!’\nShael even found things she could throw away on purpose. It was the magic tool she often used.\n“Please get it for me.”\n[Do you have no feet?]\nShe was sure that he’d spit out those words, and would have just ignored it. But the words that came out of Eran’s mouth really surprised her.\n“Yes, wait here.”\nEran hurriedly went to fetch the magic tool handed it over to Shael.\n‘He really went to get it for me?’\n‘Is something wrong with his brain? No, his mind is finally back to normal!’\nEran’s personality had definitely become very defiant in recent times, and now he seemed to have gone back to how he was before.\nIt was definitely what she was hoping for. But, even without realizing it, Shael found it quite boring.\n‘Have I lost my mind as well?’\nShe thought.\n‘Why would I find such a nice situation boring?’\nShael shook her head.\n‘Okay, let’s just enjoy the situation.’\nShael decided.\nWhen Eran got her magic tool and returned, Shael asked Eran again. No, she ordered.\n“Bring me some water.”\nEran immediately brought water.\n“Please buy me an umbrella.”\nEran bought an umbrella as she said. There was no possibility of rain in this weather. No, there was no reason to carry an umbrella in the first place, since they were inside the Mage Tower.\nEran followed her words unconditionally.\nIt was boring. It wasn’t fun.\nSo Shael thought,\n‘Could it be that the Mage Tower Lord has cursed him?’\nIt was impossible for his personality to change overnight like this otherwise. Even if his personality did change, there was no way he would do some of the things she ordered him to do.\n‘Perhaps the Mage Tower Lord thought that the culprit who gave him the pills was Eran, so he might have placed a similar curse on him.’\nShael guessed.\nEran might be doing the exact opposite of what he wanted to do.\nSo Shael smiled and spoke up. Because she had a great idea.\n“Please return my Serpent Orbs back to me.”\nAs Shael expected, Eran followed her words.\nHe was about to hand the Serpent Orbs over to Shael. It was right at that moment, when she heard a clear and refreshing sound.\nAhh!\n***\n“He he…”\nShael was sleeping comfortably. She was also sleep talking… which was not something I expected a villainess to do.\nI could even see a happy-looking smile that I hadn’t seen before.\nIt seemed like she was having a good dream.\nI hope it wasn't a dream where she was bullying me like she said last night.\nFor some reason, I found it quite unpleasant.\nSo I punished her for sleeping while using the whole blanket.\nAhh!\nMy finger landed on Shael’s forehead.\nShael opened her eyes. Her eyes were still a bit hazy.\n“…?”\n“You must have been dreaming.”\nShael lowered the corner of her mouth that had been up.\n“…”\n“Just what kind of dream did you have that made you smile so happily?”\nShael just blankly stared into space at my question. Then she suddenly pointed to deck of cards.\n“That, let’s do it again.”\n“Yes?”\nIt was so out of the blue. She woke up and said let’s play the card game. Still, I nodded my head, because I didn’t intend to rile up her feelings today.\nIt was because of the banquet. In order to avoid conflict with the Mage Tower Lord, it was necessary to adapt to her mood.\nShe spread all five of her fingers. She was setting five flicks to the forehead as a reward for winning the bet.\n“Yes, I agree.”\nShe was swapping her card this time as well. It was the same as yesterday.\nBut I didn’t use vision magic to win this time. I would endure just until the banquet was over.\nIt was to keep things going the way she wanted until then.\nI also lost the game… as she wanted.\nShael started to flex her hands.\n“A precognitive dream?”\nShe murmured softly.\n‘Did she see this happening in a dream?’\nI couldn’t tell.\nShael was about to flick on my forehead.\nAuck!\nI tightly closed my eyes. Then, when Shael suddenly stopped, I felt curious and opened my eyes. Shael had been waiting for this moment.\nAaah!\nAaah!\n“I still have one left!”\nAaahh!!\nShael laughed as if she was satisfied and backed off.\nI, on the other hand, struggled to hold off my laughter. Because it didn’t hurt at all. Of course, I had to act the part, as I clutched my forehead to make her feel satisfied.\n“It hurts!”\nShael showed a mean smile at my words.\n“Then you should have just won.”\nThere was a lot I could say as she had won by cheating. Usually, I’d say something to refute her, but not this time. It was because I felt sorry for Shael.\n‘She got hit on the head quite a lot these days.’\nShael definitely wanted to flick five times. But she had completely forgotten about that.\nThe villainess was way too much happy that she had managed to hit me, and she was also laughing quite hard.\nThe villainess was stupid.\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "After defeating me, Shael’s mood was at its peak.\nIn a way, it was natural that she would be happy. She was desperate enough to learn those strange finger exercises, and she even did a warm up activity in order to properly flick my head.\nAnyways, here was very little time left before the banquet at the Mage Tower began.\nEven if the banquet at the Mage Tower started late, it would be because the villainess had slept more than usual.\nAt the moment, Shael was touring the inside of the Mage Tower as she wanted.\nShael handed me the doll, and her luggage.\n“What is it?”\n“Carry them.”\nShael was ordering me.\n“Do you have no feet?”\n“…”\nIt shouldn’t have been such a surprise, but Shael was taken aback.\nIf it’s not a request, wasn’t it natural for me to say such a thing in response to such a rude order?\nShael walked on without speaking. She was thinking deeply about something.\nThen she opened her mouth again.\n“Bring me some water.”\nAs expected, it wasn’t a request this time as well. She was giving me orders again.\nNo matter how much I needed to accommodate her mood today, I would never accept such behavior from her.\nIt was because Shael already had a bad personality, and doing that could make it even worse. She might develop more bad habits.\nBut I did as she said and brought water. Of course, it wasn’t plain water.\nShael took the water while smiling and made a strange expression as soon as she drank it.\n“Puheuk!”\nIt was the sound of her spitting out the water she was drinking. Actually, what I gave her wasn’t some ordinary water.\n“It’s sour!”\nShael glared at me.\n“I added some lemon juice because you didn’t seem to have any strength. How is it?”\n“…”\nShe didn’t answer me. It was because she was glaring at me like she usually did.\nIn the end, Shael made a moaning sound.\nThe villainess was indeed weak in the face of resistance.\n“Be prepared!”\nShe gritted her teeth as if she had vowed to get revenge. It seemed that another attack was necessary.\n“Actually, I also put my saliva in it. Did you like it?”\n“What!?”\nShael answered my question with a half question.\n“What nonsense…”\n“We’re fiancees, so it’s nothing wrong.”\n“Ha…”\nHowever, Shael did not give up. She was trying not to lose to me until the end.\n“So, do you want to drink my saliva too?”\nThat was a really disgusting remark.\nShael, who was disgusted by my words, counterattacked. She was confident of her victory. Of course, that wouldn’t happen.\n“Okay, good. Would you like to do it with a kiss?”\n“What? What?”\nShe said as she looked at me with disgust.\n“Just kidding. How could I do such a thing?”\nShael still couldn’t get rid of her doubts despite my words.\n“So, you should have just asked for the water, don’t give me orders.”\nShael narrowed her eyes and looked at me. But she wasn’t able to voice any refutations.\nBecause we saw someone passing by.\n“The Mage Tower Lord, are you sure that his personality has really improved?”\n“That’s right.”\nIt was the same Mage Tower Lord who had quarreled with Shael and me for no reason. So how was it possible to improve his nasty personality?\nThe reason was obvious. It was due to the Pill of Lies that Shael gave to the Mage Tower Lord.\n“Is the pill still working?”\n“If the duration is not over, then it should be. The Mage Tower Lord can’t use detoxification magic… and people who can get close to the Mage Tower Lord shouldn’t be able to use it either.”\nThat’s right, the only person who could approach the Mage Tower Lord was the female protagonist, Clie. The Mage Tower Lord also had a bad relationship with the other mages in the Mage Tower.\nApart from his hight magic skills, it was also because of his nasty personality.\nOf course there was a possibility that the Mage Tower Lord who took the Pill of Lies could approach them… but the probability that the mages would release it was small.\nOnly skillful mages could recognize the effects of medicine taken by others, and most of them also hated the Mage Tower Lord.\nSo even if they recognized the medicine, there was no way they would help the Mage Tower Lord.\nNo, even if the Mage Tower Lord wanted to approach a mage in the first place. He wouldn’t be able to do so due to the effect of the pill, and he would rather distance himself from them.\nBut the effect of pill wasn’t permanent. Someday it would wear out.\n“What if the Mage Tower Lord finds out that you drug*ed him?”\n“It’s okay.”\nIt seemed that Shael had already taken care of that.\n“I bribed the maid very generously. She’s on a long journey along with her family.”\nShe was a good schemer in her own way for a woman who had forgotten how many flicks she had to do. Did she really have a talent for being a villainess?\n“What if we still get caught? If it were the Mage Tower Lord, he would attack us with just suspicion as evidence.”\n“Then you’ll just have to stop it.”\nApparently, she had no talent for being a villainess.\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "The second day of the banquet began.\nIt was also the time when the role of the member of the Azbel family, Shael, would become very important.\nThe atmosphere of the banquet hall had changed from what it was yesterday.\nThe banquet hall, was situated at the heart of the Mage Tower. And at the center of the banquet hall, now stood a black pillar with an unpleasant aura.\nIt was a pillar that absorbed the curse of the Mage Tower.\nThe purpose of the banquet was to purify it with Shael’s magic and to circulate even a little bit of pure mana in the Mage Tower.\nI looked around.\nIt was to find the location of the crown prince. Then I found a person standing alone in the banquet hall that was filled with all kinds of distinguished guests.\nIt was the crown prince, Jerroch Edgars.\nEven though he had changed his appearance with his disguise magic, I could recognize him at a glance.\nIt was because he was staring intently at Clie, the main character, who was at the moment, standing with the Mage Tower Lord.\nIn the original novel, the crown prince suffers a devastating attack at night.\nThe reason was obviously the curse of the Mage Tower. In the novel, the Mage Tower Lord deliberately refuses to provide him with a lodging even though he realizes that he is the crown prince in disguise.\nHowever, now he seemed quite unharmed. Then, what could be the reason?\nIt was probably due to the dru*g that the villainess had given to the Mage Tower Lord. The Mage Tower Lord, who probably didn’t want to give the room to the crown prince, would have willingly given it to him under the effect of the dru*g.\nThanks to that, it felt like the novel and its development had changed quite drastically. I just hoped that I could somehow steer the situation for the better.\nThat’s how the ceremony began.\nShael, who had the Azbel family’s mana, stepped forward.\nShe placed her hand on the central pillar of the banquet hall.\nShael frowned. In a way, she was doing something good for the Mage Tower Lord, so she probably disliked it quite a lot.\nThat greedy villainess must already be planning to use this to increase her allowance for doing this.\nAs Shael sent her mana to the pillar, the dark pillar of the Mage Tower gradually lost its ominous energy.\nThe Mage Tower Lord also went to the pillar for the ceremony.\nIt was then that someone spoke to me. It was a very urgent tone.\n“Can you… help me?”\nIt was the heroine, Clie. She was trembling in fear and calling for my help.\n“What can I do for you?”\n“The Mage Tower Lord has become very strange! Suddenly, one morning, his personality changed.”\nClie rolled up her clothes. There were scars on her forearms.\nThey were wounds caused by magic.\nThere was no way the Mage Tower lord would do something like that.\nAren, the Mage Tower Lord had a nasty personality. However, he changed that personality only when it came to female lead.\nHe had always been very nice to Clie.\nAnd now, the Mage Tower Lord could only do the opposite because of the pills Shael gave him.\n‘Ah.’\nBefore I had time to say anything, the crown prince, Jerroch, approached us.\n“What is that wound?”\nJerroch took off his disguise and the cloak he wore to hide his face.\n“Eh, crown prince?!”\n“Shh. Quiet.”\nAs expected, her acting was excellent. Clie must have already known about the crown prince.\nIn our first encounter with the Mage Tower Lord yesterday, she even came to the Mage Tower to get attention of the crown prince.\nJerroch was gentle in nature. However, he had an extremely strong obsession with Clie, the female lead.\nFor example, the he had been staring at the female lead since yesterday.\n“That is the work of the Mage Tower Lord.”\n“…”\nCile was remained silent.\nThe prince’s anger was visibly reaching its peak. So I couldn’t say anything more.\nLet’s do a recap.\nPrince, Jerroch, was extremely obsessed with the female lead. He definitely wouldn’t let the female lead get hurt in any way.\nUsually, in a romantic fantasy novel, if the male protagonists started liking the female protagonist from the beginning, the novel would end very quickly.\nHowever, the reason this novel was able to go on for a long time was because the main characters had very different personalities.\nThat’s why the two of them would fight over trivial things from the beginning.\nBut this time, the Mage Tower Lord had hurt Clie.\nIn other words, there would be trouble.\n***\nShael had safely completed her role.\nThe dark aura had disappeared from the pillar before she knew it.\nThe Mage Tower Lord was still busy checking the pillar.\n“Shael. Do you remember how long the effect of the Pill of Lies would last?”\n“Yes, maybe six hours.”\nThen I have a question.\n‘Why the hell is the Mage Tower Lord still being affected by the dru*g?’\n“Then why is the Mage Tower Lord still acting like that?”\nShael showed a proud smile at my question. Then she stretched out both of her hands. She then folded and unfolded them again.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Twenty pills.”\nTwenty pills? For a moment I couldn’t understand what she was saying.\n“I gave Twenty pills to that dog.”\n‘Ah.’\nThe villainess… was indeed evil.\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "“Twenty?”\n“Yes, twenty.”\nFor some reason, I felt that the Mage Tower Lord was quite pitiful.\n‘No, in the first place, how did you secretly feed him 20 pills? Who the hell is that maid who was bribed Shael?\n’\n“She did it because I gave her a lot of money.”\nAs I looked at Shael in bewilderment and she answered.\nIt was a reminder of how terrifying the power money was!\nThe Mage Tower Lord was still affected by the pills, and the crown prince was closely observing Clie.\nHe was checking her for other wounds.\nI didn’t know how things would go after the crown prince finished checking that Clie was safe.\nIt was obvious that the crown prince would challenge the Mage Tower Lord to a fight. If so, would the Mage Tower Lord accept the fight in that state?\nHe might not even be able to attack the crown prince because of the of the Pill of Lies.\nIf I used magic to release the effect, he might rather suspect me of being the culprit and attack me.\nIt was a really headache inducing situation.\nFortunately, the purpose of the banquet was accomplished as the Mage Tower’s curse was suppressed through Shael’s mana.\nAfter the final dance, the long banquet would soon be over. And that final event would also begin soon.\nAs expected, soon, a beautiful music started playing.\nEveryone got up from their seats and started dancing.\nI also reached out to Shael. For now, I put off thinking about the Mage Tower Lord and the crown prince.\n“Grab it.”\nLuckily, Shael followed my lead. It seemed that letting her win was still having a positive effect on her mood.\nShael started to dance, following the movement of my feet. She seemed quite skillful. It was a huge improvement compared to when she first started dancing.\nIt made me think that maybe she had practiced alone.\n“You’ve improved a lot.”\n“Yes, I think I dance better than you.”\nAnyway, I think I gave the compliment in vain. As Shael began to boldly take the lead as if to show her own dancing skills in response to my words.\nThere was no way it was perfect. Although she had become quite proficient, Shael was still a beginner.\nShael’s feet were getting twisted. She was even on the verge of falling quite a few times. So she looked quite puzzled.\nFortunately, Shael didn’t fall. Because I supported her with my arms.\n“You really are quite good at dancing.”\n“…”\nShael blushed.\nAfter saying that she seemed to dance better than me, she immediately made a mistake, so it was natural for her to be ashamed.\nShael patted my hand and said.\n“As someone said before, I am heavy, so why don’t you let go?”\nShael was talking about the time I was teaching her to dance.\nAt that time, she was heavy because of the effect of the Heavy Pollen, although I did tell her that she looked fat. The reason I said that was to make her practice her dance.\nThe villainess was now bringing up that story again. She was a stupid villainess, but her memory was strangely quite good only in times like this.\n“I was joking when I said you looked fat.”\n“Do you think I would believe that?”\nShael denied my claim. But she seemed to believe me.\nActually, it was true that she had gained a slight weight, but that wouldn’t make a difference.\nShael was already quite thin, so even if she gained more weight, it wouldn’t matter.\n“You are actually very light. So there is no need to try to lose weight.”\n“…”\n“You don’t even have to do that exercise to lose weight.”\n“…”\nShael continued to keep her mouth shut. Her face was red, and shame was not the reason.\nI used magic to enhance my hearing. Then I heard a faint sound.\nHa..ha..ha…\nIt was a bit of a strange breathing sound. Shael was breathing very slowly so that I wouldn’t notice it. Apparently, the villainess had poor stamina.\n“Now that I see it, you do need to exercise.”\n“I’ll go drink some water.”\nShael, who would normally have objected to my words, went to drink some water. It was clear to see that she was having a hard time.\nWell, to be honest she not only had to dance, but also circulate her mana into the pillar of the Mage Tower.\nSo even if she didn’t dance, she would’ve been tired to some extent.\nGoblin:\nCheck out the other projects I’m working on in the project page.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "I looked around. People’s attention was not drawn to me and Shael.\nI had achieved my goal on my own.\nIt was a huge improvement compared to the original novel.\nIn the novel, Shael was at a banquet where everyone was happy, and she was mocked at every moment.\nThe reason for that was the instigation of the Mage Tower Lord. So, people easily came to hate Shael.\nMoreover, there were quite a few Mage Tower mages in the banquet hall.\nApart from not having a good relationship with the Mage Tower Lord, the mages of the Tower would have had to follow his orders. It was because they were well aware of the his nasty personality.\nThey targeted and mocked Shael for her dancing.\nIn the original novel, there was no way that Shael would’ve practiced her dance. Even when she practiced with me, she couldn’t dance properly. Therefore, it was obvious what would happen when the eyes of so many\npeople would be focused on her.\nIn the novel, she danced more sloppily than anyone else.\nSo, it was only natural that the people would mock Shael because of the instigation of the Mage Tower Lord. And the mages of the Tower who knew the character of the Mage Tower Lord treated her as a laughing stock.\nBut what about now?\nEven though she made some mistakes, Shael danced with good skill.\nThere was no way she would become a laughing stock. Above all, people were not paying attention to Shael at all.\nIt was because a different situation happened than it was in the novel.\nThe object of their attention was the Crown Prince, Jerroch Edgars.\nOriginally, he was supposed to have suffered from the curse of the Mage Tower because of the Mage Tower Lord. But now, he had taken off his disguise and the cloak with which he had covered his face with.\nMost of the people were already dancing, but the Crown Prince was still without a partner.\nThe prince must have been angry when he checked Clie’s wound earlier.\nBut he persevered.\n‘What was the reason?’\nThe reason must have been that he wanted to dance with Clie.\nBecause he must have judged that punishing the Mage Tower Lord should be done after dancing with Clie.\nEveryone was looking at him. Indeed, everyone wanted to know— who will the prince ask for a dance?\nHe hesitated in frustration as he looked at Clie.\nThe Crown Prince was obsessed with the female protagonist, Clie. He usually tended to act boldly, but also became extremely timid in such important situations.\nThat was the character of Jerroch Edgars.\nIn the original novel, Clie uses the Mage Tower Lord to make him jealous.\nAt the banquet hall, she would accompany the Mage Tower Lord. When she wanted to dance, she would go to the Mage Tower Lord, as she watched the hesitant Crown Prince looking at her without taking off his disguise.\nActually, the Crown Prince at that time couldn’t even take off his disguise due to the curse of the Mage Tower, which he must have suffered from at night.\nOf course, Clie, who was unaware of that, invites the Mage Tower Lord to dance.\nThat must have been the moment when the relationship between the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince began to fall apart.\nThe Mage Tower Lord was still near the central pillar.\nIt wasn’t to check the Mage Tower’s curse. Somehow, I could guess that it was probably caused by the Pill of Lies. Because the Mage Tower Lord would have wanted to dance with Clie as well.\nThe Mage Tower Lord, who wanted to get closer to Clie, would have to distance himself instead.\nClie was keeping an eye on the Crown Prince again this time. She will probably try to make the timid prince jealous in order to make him take action.\nHowever, there was no way Clie could go to the Mage Tower Lord like she did in the novel.\nBecause she got the wound on her forearm from Aren.\nThere was no way she would ask the Mage Tower Lord to dance.\nShe wouldn’t invite the Crown Prince to dance herself as well. She wanted make the Crown Prince make an offer to her first.\nThat was the character of Clie.\nAnyway, it didn’t matter to me. It didn’t look like a fight between the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince would happen yet.\nSo I decided to focus on Shael for now.\nAnd, it happened when I was about to invite Shael, who was drinking water, to dance again.\n“Hey, would you like to dance with me?”\nIt was Clie’s voice. Clie was asking me to dance.\n‘Nonsense!’\nIt was total nonsense!\nClie must have already seen us when Shael and I were dancing.\nShe even must have known that Shael and I were engaged. Because Clie was also quick-witted.\nAbove all, the meaning of dancing in the romanic fantasy novel was quite significant!\nIt was not just a simple matter of dancing. Only those who had a crush on each other or who were in a special relationship would dance together.\nIt also meant that they would not dance with people they had no relationship with.\nSo, asking me to a dance while I was with Shael, my fiancée, was something unimaginable.\nAs a result, people’s attention changed from the Crown Prince to me. As I, too, was the son of a duke.\nIt was the same with my fiancé, Shael. So it was only natural that people’s eyes would gather.\nThe Crown Prince was glaring at me with a frown on his face. That resentful look on his face, as if his lover had been taken away, was a bonus.\nThere was no way I would accept this request! I\nIt happened when I was about to flatly refuse Clie’s invitation.\nSomeone blocked my way. It wasn’t the Mage Tower Lord or the Crown Prince.\nI saw that familiar light blue hair that I see quite often.\nIt was Shael. Shael stood still as she stared at Clie. Even so, one could feel arrogance of a villainess.\nShe then said, “He is mine.”\nShael, who uttered words that no one had expected, smiled menacingly at Clie.\nGoblin:\nCheck out the other projects I’m working on in the project page.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Every eyes in the banquet hall was watching Shael and Clie.\nIt must have been for the rumor that everyone knew from the beginning that Shael’s personality was not good.\nBy the way, recently another rumor has been circulating as well.\nIt was the rumor that Shael had fallen in love with me.\nIt was a rumor that wasn’t true at all. Perhaps Duke Jespen had played a part in spreading that rumor.\nBut why did Shael say such a thing to Clie? The answer was simple.\nIt was because Shael hates Clie. She was the one who had ruined Shael’s clothes.\nShael must have thought that Clie’s actions were intentional, not an accident.\nSo did I.\nNo matter how you looked at it, it was hard to understand why she spilled wine on Shael during the short time I was talking to the Mage Tower Lord.\n“Eh, sorry! I didn’t know you already had a partner…!”\nClie bowed her head and apologized. Her shoulders were trembling. No, her whole body was trembling like that.\nIt was a pitiful figure that made everyone feel sympathy.\nNo matter what Clie really had in her heart, once she bowed her head, the opponent was bound to be defeated.\nShe exuded an air of someone who needs to be protected. So no one could harm her in front of the people.\nFor that reason, in the novel, Clie makes full use of her own strengths.\nAlthough I hadn’t read the second half of the novel, I did read the side story that was close to the end. And, I knew most of the contents of the book. So I knew what kind of character Clie was pretty well.\nIf it was the Clie that I knew, she would have bowed her head even if she didn’t feel sorry.\nThen no one could harm her.\nExcept for one person, Shael.\n“You should have already known.”\nEven in that situation, Shael still glared at Clie and pushed on.\nEven though warm music was playing in the banquet hall, the atmosphere had become cold.\n“Why did you suddenly become mute?”\nShael asked again while looking at Clie, who remained silent and only lowered her head.\nPeople in the banquet hall couldn’t help but be nervous.\nShael had instantly changed the atmosphere in the banquet hall.\nIt was at that moment, the music stopped. It was the signal to announce the end of the banquet.\nPeople looked at Shael and began to hurriedly leave the banquet hall. Watching the drama unfold wasn’t really important to them at the moment. They must have thought that if they remained there, she might take out her anger on them.\nThe rumors about Shael were not always very accurate.\nThey probably didn’t know about Shael’s strength. They must have misunderstood Shael as a mage of great skill.\nIt was only natural, considering that she was from the Azbel family. Moreover, Shael also infused her magic into the pillars of the Mage Tower at the banquet.\nSince she had completely cleansed the pillar of the ominous energy, the misunderstanding was inevitable.\nOnce some quick-witted people got out, others started moving as well.\nThe crowded banquet hall became quiet in an instant.\nConsidering that her meek behavior, which was also her strength, didn’t work, Cile must be feeling quite embarrassed. Because she never had any other strength beyond that.\nAt least it was like that in the novel.\nBut unlike what it was in the novel, Clie looked calm.\nIt was quite strange.\nThis Clie hadn’t had much contact with Shael yet. Even if she knew from the rumors that Shael had a bad personality, she should’ve been quite flustered considering that her methods didn’t work on a opponent for the first time.\nIt was strange for her to be so calm in such a bad situation.\nBut I had no choice but to erase that thought, as I felt a strange aura of magical power from somewhere.\nIt meant that someone had used magic.\nShael was in front of me. So it wasn’t her. It was neither the Crown Prince nor Cile.\nI could feel that magic power from the pillar in the center.\nIt belonged to the Mage Tower Lord, Aren Jaygers.\nHe had his fists clenched with his face down. The Mage Tower Lord wasn’t supposed to control his own behavior because of the Pill of Lies.\nNow that he was able to, it could mean only one thing…\nThe Mage Tower Lord, Aren Jaygers, had finally escaped from the effects of the dr*g.\nAren had taken twenty pills. Considering the duration of each pill, the effect couldn’t have worn out in only one day.\nFrom what I could feel from the magic power, the Mage Tower Lord had used Detoxification Magic.\nThe Mage Tower Lord wasn’t supposed to have learned the Detoxification Magic. However, he clearly exceeded the extent of my knowledge.\nAs for why he was able to use the Detoxification Magic, it was possible to use it even if one was under the effect of the Pill of Lies.\nIt was clear that Aren had escaped the effects of the dr*g.\nGoblin:\nCheck out the other projects I’m working on in the project page.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Koo-ung!\nAren hit the pillar with his fist. The loud noise was enough to show how angry Aren was.\nMoreover, it was a situation where Clie was watching.\nIt was possible for him to get a little irritated on the outside, but it was quite rare for the Mage Tower Lord to get this angry in front of Clie.\nHe was angry enough to ignore even that.\nWell, he must have realized that he had hurt the woman he liked under the effect of a strange drug. So it was natural that he would be angry.\n“It’s you…”\nThe Mage Tower Lord was pointing at the culprit who he suspected had drugged him.\nThe one the Mage Tower Lord was looking at was the Crown Prince!\nNo, maybe it wasn’t because of his heartache, but because he didn’t like the prince who looked at Clie all the time.\nHe was gathering mana in his hands.\nUnfortunately, the Crown Prince found himself in a situation where he would have to fight for no reason. However, the Crown Prince did not reveal his circumstances.\nThis was because the Crown Prince also wanted to fight with the Mage Tower Lord.\nThe Crown Prince drew his sword.\n“Oh, wait!”\nClie spoke up. However, Aren and Jerroch, who were already prepared to fight, payed attention to her words.\nAnd then, they started fighting.\nOf course, the Mage Tower Lord used magic, and the Crown Prince used his swordsmanship.\nThey were the male protagonists of romanic fantasy novels.\nIn the second half of the novel, they become so strong that those around them wouldn’t dare to approach them.\nOf course they made sure that Clie would be safe while they fought.\nAs soon as the fight started, the Crown Prince used an excellent protective magic tool to protect Clie.\nThe Mage Tower Lord cast his protection magic not on himself, but on Clie as well.\nIt was a bit odd.\nKwaang!\nI heard an explosion.\nIt was unbelievable that two people fighting could create such a sound.\nThe Mage Tower Lord’s magic was intense, and the Crown Prince’s swordsmanship was sharp.\nEven in the novel, the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince fought quite frequently.\nSo how did the female lead end the situation at that time?\nOnce again, Clie would utilize her methods. She used her weakness as strength each time.\nBoth the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince already knew that Clie was a terminally ill woman. So if she just coughed and looked unwell, they would stop fighting.\nBut now, Clie was quiet. She was just watching their fight.\nIt happened when I was preoccupied with watching her carefully, feeling the strangeness of her quietness.\nThe magic of the Mage Tower Lord was coming our way!\nIt was a sharp, and swift steel shrapnel.\nSince he had already cast enough protection magic on Clie, he was running amok with his magic.\nHowever, the steel shrapnel was pointed to Shael.\nShael was trying to stop it with the magic she learned from me. But that wouldn’t help.\nIt was the magic of the Mage Tower Lord. Moreover, that magic was one of the most powerful he had in his arsenal.\n‘I have to step in!’\nIt was too brief a moment to use magic. There was not enough time to pull out my main weapon, the sword.\nSo, I had to block it with my body!\nPooh-wook!\nIt was the sound of steel sinking into my body. Normally, protection magic would be enough to block it, but it was impossible to block it without preparation.\nThe magic of the Mage Tower Lord was very strong as expected.\nI couldn’t even bear even one of his attacks.\nStill, my consciousness began to fade. Fortunately, I was still able to hear a faintly audible voice.\nThe voice was mixed in with the sound of the huge battle between the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.\nㅡ You weakling!\nThat was Shael’s voice.\n‘You’re calling me a weakling?’\nIt was not something one would say to the person who blocked the magic on their behalf.\nAs expected, the villainess was indeed a villainess.\nㅡ Cough!\nThe next thing I heard was the sound of coughing. It was Clie.\nThen the roaring sound stopped.\nThe Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince didn’t care even when I was injured, but they stopped fighting at the sound of Clie’s coughing.\nIt’s a pity that it happened only after I was injured…\nIt was fortunate though. I was able to immerse myself in my fading consciousness.\n***\nIn a quiet atmosphere, warm sunlight was streaming in through the windows.\nLooking around, I judged that the place where I was lying was the hospital room.\nA bandage was wrapped around my abdomen where the steel shrapnel had been lodged.\n“If you’re going to pass out in one shot, why the hell did you try to block it?”\nI heard someone’s voice next to me. That voice filled with sharpness belonged to Shael.\nGoblin:\nCheck out the other projects I’m working on in the project page.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "“If you’re going to pass out in one shot, why the hell did you jump in?”\nShael said coldly. She had an atmosphere that reminded me of Shael from the past. The atmosphere before I scolded her, and called her a bit*ch.\nShael was waiting for my answer.\n“If I had had time to draw my sword, I wouldn’t have passed out.”\n“Oh, is that so?”\nShael said in a tone as if she didn’t believe my excuse.\nIt was true though. I belonged to the bloodline of the famous swordsman, the Baslett family.\nIf I had had time to pull out my sword, I could have avoided the situation where I had to faint.\nEven though I knew how to use magic, it wasn't my area of expertise.\nShael was still glaring at me.\n“Are you really that worried?”\n“No.”\nOf course, Shael directly denied my words.\nI had nothing more to say, so I looked around to escape this awkward atmosphere.\nIt was a fairly large hospital room. On the table in the corner were medicines that seemed tasteless at first glance, and packs of unknown juices.\nAs if Shael noticed my gaze, she grinned and said.\n“The doctor told you to take them all.”\nShael pointed to the piled up items on the table. They were exactly the packs of all kinds of medicines and juices I had seen.\nThe amount was unbelievable!\nIn the first place, I had a big wound on my stomach, not a disease. I didn’t really need to take all those medicine.\nThe wound wasn’t so deep that it could threaten my life. Even if it would be burdensome to treat it with healing magic, it wasn’t something that required me to take that pile of medicines.\nI really didn’t want to take those medicines.\nIt was as if Shael had read my mind. So it was only natural that the villainess would try her best to make me take those medicine.\nShael put the packs of medicines and juices beside my bed with her own hands.\n“Eat everything.”\nIt was indeed a staggering number of medicines. There seemed to be more than twenty pills, which even exceeded the number she made the Mage Tower Lord take.\nNo, it didn’t even come close to that!\nThere were also several kinds of concentrates made from various herbs.\n“You gave the Mage Tower Lord twenty pills, but why are you giving me medicines that make it difficult to even count them all?”\nShael nodded her head. She tore off the wrapping paper of the medicine herself. She took my hand and started to place the pills on top.\nNo, she started piling them up.\n“How many are you going to give me!”\nShael didn’t stop at my words. It wasn’t until quite a few pills piled up that she stopped. By that point, there were heaps of pills on my hand.\n“I will die from an overdose.”\n“People don’t die that easily.”\nI had no choice but to put the medicine in my mouth. Fortunately, there were no medications that had side effects just because I took a lot of them.\nStill, the villainess served them to me herself, so I couldn’t just throw them away.\n‘No, would she really care about me?’\nThat thought left me as soon as I started to chew the pills.\nShael didn’t even give me water, so I was just chewing on those bitter pills.\nI glared at Shael with a bitter taste in my mouth.\nShael smiled at my angry gaze in response.\nI swallowed the pills with difficulty. Now I needed something to rinse my mouth with. Even though I had already swallowed it all, I could still feel the bitter taste.\n“Water. Please give me some water.”\n“There is no water, but I do have something similar.”\nShael started giving me the juices that were placed next to my bed.\nShe… she wanted me to drink those herbal concentrate instead of water. Was this really the way you should treat a patient?\nBut I couldn’t say anything.\nChewing those countless pills was more painful than I thought. It was too bitter and frustrating. I felt like I had to drink something right now.\nIt was also impossible to use magic related to water. Drinking water produced from mana would have no effect.\nIt would just give me the feeling of swallowing the air.\nThere was no other way. So I started drinking the concentrate she gave me.\nBut it also didn’t work. The concentrate this evil woman gave me was very bitter as well. It was disgusting!\nThis, too, was clearly what this wicked woman was aiming for.\n“They say that bitter things is good for your health.”\nShael must have noticed my suffering, she was saying things that scratched my mind.\nI was injured in order to save her, but the treatment I was receiving was preposterous!\nSo, I decided to sacrifice my body for revenge! And, the method was simple.\nI had to deceive the villainess!\n“Ah, this juice is more delicious than I thought!”\n“…?”\n“Is there any more?”\nGoblin:\nCheck out the other projects I’m working on in the project page.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Shael’s smile slowly faded away. Then she put on a puzzled look.\n[It can’t be like that…]\nShe must be thinking that. Therefore, to make her even more flustered, I endured the pain and started gulping down another glass of juice I had grabbed from her hand.\n“This juice is quite sweet.”\nIt was something the villainess liked, so it was just the right bait.\nYes, Shael liked sweet food.\nSo, this was the best way to stimulate her curiosity.\nShael stared at me with disdain.\nThen she secretly grabbed the juice that was lying next to my bed and took it into her hand.\n‘Stupid villainess!’\nShe never thought I would dare to act in such a situation.\nShe took the juice to her mouth. Then she started drinking.\n“Fheghehe!”\nThe Villainess was weak against bitterness.\n“Disgusting, what are you doing in front of a patient?”\n“…”\nShael couldn’t even refute my words, and she made a moaning noise.\nAfter some time passed, the wicked woman came to her senses. She didn’t glare at me.\nShe was pondering something. Presumably, she was looking for another way to annoy me.\nThen, Shael called someone to bring food.\nIt was more of a feast than a meal!\nShael started putting food in front of me as well. However, unlike the ones placed in front of Shael, they were quite shabby.\n“What is it?”\n“Eat. They say that eating is good for your health.”\nOf course it was. In front of me, there was food that could only be good for the body. In other words, they were tasteless!\nShael proudly began to eat the well-prepared food by herself.\nSo I launched a counter attack, “Feeding only healthy food to me shows just how much you really love me.”\nAt my words, Shael stopped eating and started to cough. She then glared at me again.\nBut she stopped, then she started to think about something.\nSuddenly Shael laughed and started giving me some side dishes as well.\nIt was strange. There was no way she would succumb with a single word!\nIt was an absolutely unacceptable situation.\n***\nWhen Eran was hit by the magic attack instead of her, Shael doubted her eyes.\n‘Why on earth did he block the magic for me?’\nIt wasn’t like Eran was under some kind of spell when he was hit by the magic.\n‘Come to think of it, he was always like this…’\nEven when she had injured her hand when the teacup broke, even when she was in danger of being poisoned.\nEran had always helped her.\nSo Shael got mad at Eran for making her think so many complicated things, and got all kinds of bitter medicine and put them in his hospital room.\n‘I will definitely make him eat them all, and make him feel the bitter taste!’\nAnd as expected, she was able to feed Eran quite a bit of those bitter pills.\nOf course, Shael fell for Eran’s trick and had no choice but to drink the bitter juice.\nSo the next thing she came up with was food. She herself would eat the delicious food, and she was going to give Eran tasteless food on the pretext of improving his health.\nAs planned, she gave Eran some shabby food and then started eating delicious food by herself.\nThen Eran spoke up while looking at her.\n[Feeding only healthy food to me shows just how much you really love me.]\nAt Eran’s words, Shael was taken aback. How could he say something like that so casually?\nShe couldn’t swallow her food properly, so she started to cough. Then she glared at Eran, and thought.\n‘Yes, he was like this every time.’\nWhenever she tried to bully Eran, it would end up backfiring on her.\nShael had never seen Eran panic.\nSo she began to think.\n‘Then, in what way can I embarrass my fiancé?’\nShe began to think back to the one time when Eran was flustered.\nThat was when she had accidentally taken the Pill of Lies and said something strange. She had said that she loved Eran.\nAt that time, Eran had panicked!\nSo Shael decided to use that method again.\nWhat she had said that at that time, was also due to the medicinal effect of the Pill of Lies, and she had felt very ashamed.\n‘What if I did that now?’\nSimilar to what happened in the past, she would be able to see the bewildered look on Eran’s face!\nSo she changed her strategy. She had to do and say something embarrassing to her fiancé.\nShael immediately took action and gave Eran a side dish. As expected, Eran looked puzzled as he stared at her.\n“What is it?”\nEran even spoke up as if he was in doubt.\n‘Yes, this is it!’\nShael wanted to embarrass Eran even more.\n‘In that case, what should I say?’\n[He is mine.]\nSuddenly, she remembered what she had said to Clie at the banquet hall.\n‘Yes, that’s it!’\nSo Shael acted on her thoughts, while anticipating the expression her fiancé would make.\n“Even if you have a bad personality, you belong to me.”\nIt sounded as if Eran was her own property. It was a statement that would shock anyone.\nIt was at that moment, Duke Jespen entered the room.\nGoblin:\nThis is a sponsored release. Thank you\nLe Lu\nfor sponsoring 10 Chapters!

      "content": "[Even if you have a bad personality, you belong to me.]\nThe villainess was uttering shocking words!\nShael spat out those words and waited for my reply.\nIt was a similar situation that happened once before. In response, I used Detection Magic.\n‘Could it be that she took another one of those strange pills again?’\n‘No. It seems that she didn’t take any such pills. Then, is she acting crazy?’\nShe acting like “that time” again.\nRight at that moment, the sound of the door opening was heard. Shael stared at the door with her eyes wide open.\nIt was Duke Jespen. He had entered the room without knocking.\nEvidently, Duke Jespen seemed to have heard Shael’s words, as his mouth was wide open at the moment.\nWell, Shael’s remarks were just that shocking. Absolutely unbelievable!\nHe was definitely surprised, but then, the corners of his mouth slightly raised up.\nHe looked at Shael, and muttered.\n“Amazing…”\nIt was clear to see what he was surprised by, and Shael couldn’t even make an excuse.\nYes, that was what she said herself. How could she have any excuse?\nShael chose to remain silent as her face blushed red.\nDuke Jespen began to look around the room. He was looking at the many medicines lying next to my hospital bed.\nHis inspection didn’t end with just the medicine. Next to it were packs of herbal juices. The sheer amount must have been quite surprising.\n“I wonder how worried she was, there are so many medicines!”\nActually, Shael brought these medicine to feed me something bitter.\nDuke Jespen misunderstood it as Shael being worries about me.\n“These are… I wanted to… make him eat something bitter…”\nThat was Shael’s excuse. Then she stopped her mouth halfway through.\nIt was an excuse no one would believe. You wanted to make me eat something bitter, then why did you bring so many medicines?\nIt was nonsense!\nThe Duke of Jespen held back his laugh at his daughter’s clumsy excuse.\n“So, what is with this delicacy?”\nDuke Jespen was looking at the side dishes I was eating. Even Duke Jespen, who normally ate hearty meals, was surprised by the food.\nThis, too, was a part of that wicked woman’s plan to eat alone and tease me. Even I was taken aback when she suddenly gave me some side dishes.\n“These are…”\nThis time, Shael couldn’t even make an excuse. She just remained silent and with her blushing face. Apparently, the villainess was feeling ashamed.\nA shocking statement, tons of medicine, and a hearty meal.\nDuke Jespen seemed to have felt satisfied with the situation and asked me.\n“I heard that there was some kind of accident at the Mage Tower.”\n“Yes. Somehow, we got caught up in the mess.”\n“Preposterous! That greenhorn from the Mage Tower must have acted recklessly again.”\nI knew who he was talking about when he used the word “reckless”. It seemed that Duke Jespen was also aware of the Mage Tower Lord’s nasty personality.\nHowever, that title was surprising. A greenhorn? Doesn’t it make the Mage Tower Lord look like some weakling?\nBut come to think of it, it was also true. No matter how powerful he was, the Mage Tower Lord, who was not yet at his peak, would be considered weak compared to Duke Jespen.\nDuke Jespen had an eerie grin on his face.\nThe members of the Azbel family were considered very kind. Well, except for Shael.\nThey were so kind that I could count on one hand the number of times they scolded the wicked Shael.\nEven in the novel, it was said that all members of the Azbel family except for Shael were kind.\nHowever, there was something I found out after being transferred in this novel.\nTheir personalities were sometimes different. I noticed it when I got in tough with the people around me.\nAt the moment, Duke Jespen was smiling like a villain.\nHe nodded his head as if he had vowed to take revenge on the Mage Tower Lord. Suddenly, his expression softened. This time, it seemed that he was thinking of something other than the Mage Tower Lord. Then he looked at Shael and said.\n“Shael, would you mind stepping aside so I can talk to Eran for a moment?”\nShael stood up obediently.\nPossibly, it would have been too embarrassing for her when Duke Jespen heard the shocking remarks earlier. In response to his request, which she would normally have resisted, she rather obeyed and left the room.\nNow, I was having a private meeting with Duke Jespen.\nDuke Jespen was thinking about something.\nHis thoughts were obvious. He was probably thinking about how to help me and Shael further out relationship.\nDuke Jespen really wanted to see his daughter’s wedding soon.\n“…!”\nThen he suddenly opened his eyes.\nThe Duke Jespen, who had been thinking pleasantly before, had disappeared, and he inquired with a trembling voice,\n“Is it possible, that you really are going to live as Shael’s captive?”\nGoblin:\nThis is a sponsored release.

      "content": "He was asking a question I hadn’t expected.\nTo live as Shael’s captive? Not at all. But why the hell is this question popping up all of a sudden?\n[Even if you have a bad personality, you belong to me.]\nIt was only then that I remembered the words Shael had spoken before. They were words that evoked the feeling that Shael and I had come to like each other. But Duke Jespen seemed to have come up with another interpretation of these words.\nAs Shael said, what if I had to obey Shael as her captive?\nDuke Jespen was probably thinking of such an outrageous notion.\nAs I was dumbfounded and unable to answer, Duke Jespen said.\n“No.”\nI won’t live as a captive. In fact, it would be the opposite.\nRather than being her captive, it would be Shael would become my captive.\nIt was something that was natural.\nDuke Jespen didn’t just want Shael to marry me, he also wanted me to be the one who would stop Shael from going astray.\nSo I told Duke Jespen, who was waiting for my answer.\n“Rather, it would be Shael would become my captive, so you don’t have to worry about that.”\nThen Duke Jespen let out a long sigh as if he was relieved.\nIt was quite amusing if you think about it. I said that his daughter was going to become my captive, but he was pleased with it.\n“So that means you will marry Shael.”\nDuke Jespen asked again. He was waiting for my answer this time as well. It seemed that he wanted to hear my thoughts about the matter regarding my marriage with Shael.\n“Yes, someday I will.”\nIt was quite an obvious answer. I lowered my head so that Duke Jespen wouldn’t be able to see my expression. However, what I said was true to some extent. I had to get married in order to get the requited time it would take to rehabilitate that wicked villainess.\nBefore coming to this world, I was one of the few people who had a lot of affection for Shael who was a character in a novel. And, I had already put in a lot of effort for Shael.\nI haven’t been able to find a noticeable change in Shael’s character yet, but compared to the novel, where Shael’s personality would have become more and more vile, she had made quite a lot of progress.\nMoreover, if Shael, the villainess, wasn’t properly rehabilitated, many people would suffer because of her.\nI didn’t want to see the members of the Azbel family mourn over the miserable ending that the villainess Shael would face one day.\nAbove all, I would never give up on a promise I made once.\nSo I gave a resolute answer. Although it sounded a bit cliche, it was full of confidence.\nDuke Jespen nodded in satisfaction. Then he glanced at the door of the hospital room and began to smile.\n***\nShael left the hospital room at Duke Jespen’s request.\nHowever, at the moment, she was doing something that would surprise anyone who saw it\nUnlike a proper noble, Shael was now standing with her ear pressed to the door of the hospital room. She had even used the Stealth Magic that she has recently learned to hide her presence.\nWhat Shael didn’t know that even though it worked for Eran, it wouldn’t work for Duke Jespen.\nThen she heard a voice.\n[Is it possible, that you really are going to live as Shael’s captive?]\nIt was Duke Jespen’s voice.\nIt’s content made Shael almost open the door without realizing it. But she bit her lip and barely held herself back.\nAnd the words that followed made Shael bite her lips even more.\n[Rather, it would be Shael would become my captive, so you don’t have to worry about that.]\n‘What nonsense is that?’\nShe wanted to open the door and walk in right away!\n‘Does he have no shame?’\nBut she stopped her thoughts. Because she, too, had made a similar kind of absurd remark just before. Shael decided to just clear her head and focus her ears on the faint sound of their voice.\n[So that means you will marry Shael.]\n‘What?’\nShael frowned in embarrassment. But what followed was even more shocking!\n[Yes, someday I will.]\nThat was what Eran said. Of course, Shael had thought Eran would refuse.\n‘But why the hell did Eran say something like that?’\n‘Rather… who want would even want to marry that guy?’\nMarriage wasn’t something that would happen just because one person wanted it. Where did Shael’s own opinion go and what gave Eran the courage to say such a thing with such conviction?\nShael thought,\n‘Marry Eran? I hate it!’\nHowever, another thought suddenly occurred to Shael.\n‘What if Eran marries someone else?’\nShe hated that too.\nIt wasn’t because she liked Eran. It was because she couldn’t bear to see Eran be happy. Shael wanted to torment Eran forever!\nBut that was impossible. If she doesn’t get married, she would pass the marriageable age someday. If that happened, then the engagement would be broken.\nRight now, the two families had to continue their bloodlines. So there was only one option left for her if she wanted to torment Eran forever.\nIt was a marriage.\nWhat would be the difference if she ended up marrying Eran? It was only that Shael would be able torment Eran forever. Other than that, nothing would change..\nAt least, it was like that in Shael’s opinion.\nThinking of that, her marriage with Eran didn’t seem too bad to Shael.\n***\nMy wound had completely healed.\nI couldn’t even find a scar. And finally today, I was able to get out of that boring hospital room.\n“Did you say that the Mage Tower Lord challenged Duke Jespen to a duel?”\nA shocking rumor reached me.\nGoblin:\nThis is a sponsored release.

      "content": "I couldn’t just sit still in the hospital room.\n‘I wonder how Duke Jespen knew of that Mage Tower Lord’s nasty personality.’\nThrough my conversations with Shael, I was able to find out about the relationship between Duke Jespen and the Mage Tower Lord. It’s said that ever since becoming the Mage Tower Lord, Aren Jaygers has often challenged Duke Jespen to a duel.\nUntil now, Duke Jespen had ignored the Mage Tower Lord who was picking a fight with him. It would have been like that in the novel as well.\nBut not anymore.\nAccording to rumors, it is said that the Mage Tower Lord had challenged Duke Jespen to a duel again. And Duke Jespen accepted it.\nAs the deadline approached, I headed straight to the arena with Shael.\nThe arena was huge. It was absurdly huge for a place where only two people would fight.\nA lot of people came as spectators.\nHowever, I noticed something strange. The Mage Tower Lord would hide his power in front of the general public as much as possible. He did it because of the female lead, Clie.\nIn the novel, Clie hated it when the Mage Tower Lord got into fights. So, the Mage Tower Lord fought most of his fights in private.\nOf course, if the Mage Tower Lord got really angry, even Clie’s displeasure wouldn’t work.\nSo, did the Mage Tower Lord become so angry that he ignored Clie’s wishes?\nContrary to my thoughts, the Mage Tower Lord seemed calm. No, he seemed to be having fun. He seemed happy at the fact that his fight against Duke Jespen was finally happening.\nThen why the hell was he okay with fighting in such a crowded place?\nTo find an answer to that, I looked at Clie, who was sitting far away. She didn’t seem to care much about the fact that the Mage Tower Lord would be fighting. She just sat there, expressionless.\nAlthough was somewhat suspicious, I dismissed the thought for now.\nThe battle between the Mage Tower Lord, Aren Jaygers and Duke Jespen was about to begin.\n***\nThe fight started at the signal of an elder..\nMage Tower Lord, Aren, was gathering mana in his hands. But, Duke Jespen just quietly watched on.\nIt was a battle between mages. No one in the spectators seat could know the final outcome of the fight. They just cheered for the spectacle that they would never see again.\nAren was the first to strike. He hurled a giant steel shard at Duke Jespen.\nThe onlookers were so overwhelmed by the display that they even forgot to cheer.\nBang!\nThe steel shard thrown by Aren, lost its strength and fell to her floor of the arena. Seeing this, Aren began to gather his mana again. Speed was the lifeblood of magicians’ battles. Life and death depended how fast you could attack and how fast you could block.\nSo the Mage Tower Lord, Aren, had ground to be confident in this fight. In the first place, Aren became the Mage Tower Lord due to his rapid magic casting.\nOf course, the intensity of the battle was quite excellent. People gasped and clapped at the Mage Tower Lords steel magic and Duke Jespen, who stood still like an immovable monolith.\nAren stared at him while mana concentrated in his hand. The Duke must be scheming something. So it wouldn’t be that wise to just rush into battle.\n‘Why the hell are you just standing still?’\nContemplated Aren, as he looked at Duke Jespen wasn’t even gathering his mana.\nAren thought of Clie who was watching over him. Then he arrogantly said, “Never, I will never lose!”\n“Don’t play around, why don’t you get serious?”\nDuke Jespen let out a sigh at his arrogant remark.\n‘Is that something you should say to your elders.\n..'\nDuke Jespen raised his hand. He pointed at Aren. Then something in the air shot towards him.\nIt was an unknown curse magic.\nMaybe the Duke was aiming for the fact that Aren didn’t know how to use Detoxification Magic, and he was only able to use combat magic.\nHowever, the incident at the banquet hall had given him the ability to use it.\nHe grinned. Then, as if showing off, he took Duke Jespen’s curse magic head on.\nHe had a ring that was handed down from the previous Mage Tower Lords. It only had one function, repelling all kinds of curse magic. It was the reason why he could not learn detoxification magic.\nHe had taken it off for a while during the banquet and was severely punished for it, so he had been wearing the ring all the time.\nDuke Jespen’s curse magic was dispelled as soon as it touched Aren.\n“It won’t work…”\nHe was about to tell Duke Jespen that his curse magic wouldn’t work, but he noticed that Duke Jespen was shooting wind magic at the ring.\nAren quickly dodged it. If the ring is taken away, he would be cursed!\nEven though he had learned the Detoxification Magic himself at the banquet hall, it was still quite weak. It was not enough to repel Duke Jespen’s curse magic. So he had to protect the ring. Of course he was sure that he’d be able to do that. That’s why Aren didn’t learn Detoxification Magic.\nAren looked down at the ring for a moment, and at that fleeting moment.\nQuaaagh!\nAren was nearly knocked out by a rock that flew from somewhere.\n‘Was he quietly waiting for the chance?’ Thought Aren as he stood up, while holding his stance.\n“Shi*t!”\nHis side hurt. He had been careless. However, if the Duke used that amount of mana in such a short interval, the recoil should have been quite large.\nAren looked at Duke Jespen and began to prepare his magic. But he had miscalculated, as he soon discovered that a hot fireball was flying towards him.\nTouuu!\nAren quickly summoned steel to block it. That wasn’t the end. Duke Jespen also invoked Gale Magic!\nA mysterious curse, a huge rock, a hot fire ball, and now the Gale Magic.\n‘Is this the power of the head of the famous mage family?’\nHwaaah!\nThe wind was sharp and cold as it scratched Aren’s body. Wherever the wind passed, it only left behind red scars.\nAren was enduring the wind that attacked him with his bare body.\n“Oh, heh.”\nHe didn’t use magic to defend against the wind. He was enduring the pain and gathering his mana.\nGoblin:\nCheck out the other projects I’m working on in the project page.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "It was a magic that he treasured and cherished. A magic that compressed huge steel shard and shoots it at high speed. If it penetrated Duke Jespen’s body, Aren’s victory would be certain.\nIt was also a magic that could lead to the death of Duke Jespen. Of course, it didn’t matter to Aren. It was common for people to die in duels.\nWhen the wind finally stopped scratching him. Aren stabilized the mana he had been gathering. Then he looked at Duke Jespen before him.\nHe was watching Aren with a look of pity, as he stood still as before.\n‘That arrogance will be the cause of your defeat. No, it will lead to your death!’\nThought Aren, as he aimed a small piece of steel shard at Duke Jespen’s heart.\nDuke Jespen still remained as motionless as before.\n‘Yes stay like that…’ Aren thought while shooting the magic.\nThere was no countermeasure against it. No matter how fast you summon a defensive magic, you can’t block this magic with anything half-hearted! It was such a strong and fast magic.\nAnd the destination of that magic was the heart of Duke Jespen.\n‘He will die.’\nPooh! Swoowook!\nThe small steel shard pierced Duke Jespen’s heart, as blood flowed out from the other side.\nIt was Aren’s victory, Duke Jespen’s defeat, and death!\nHe had been looking down on Aren and being careless. That was Duke Jespen’s sin.\nAren finally laughed.\n“Keuk, heuheu…”\nHe laughed at Duke Jespen, who was now slumped over.\n‘Well, you should have taken it seriously.’\nAs usual, Aren stroked his ring. It was an old habit that Aren did every time he won a duel.\n‘The ring!’\nThe ring was missing!\nIt must’ve happened when he was enduring the Gale Magic from Duke Jespen. It was clear that the ring had been taken away at that time.\nAren turned his gaze to the fallen Duke Jespen. Then he walked towards him with haughty steps.\nHe was feeling very dizzy. It seemed that he had lost too much blood. But even then, he was only thinking of getting the ring back from Duke Jespen.\nAren his tired body to walk forward.\n“…”\nThen the one who fell down was him!\nDuke Jespen, who had been pierced through the heart, was still standing where had been. He couldn’t find any scars on him. Even the wound from when he had apparently been pierced through the heart had completely disappeared!\n“What the….”\n‘The curse. Was it the curse of Hallucinations?’\nThe Duke had somehow taken his ring away and he was cursed.\nAren looked at Duke Jespen.\nTooung!\nIt was the sound of a ring being snapped. Duke Jespen gave the broken ring back to Aren. Aren quickly grabbed the ring. The curse was completely lifted and his dizziness disappeared.\n“Do you want to continue?”\nDuke Jespen asked him. But, Aren didn’t answer.\nHe checked his remaining mana. Only a small amount of mana remained.\n‘It’s disgraceful!’\nHe couldn’t even inflict a single wound!\nAren squeezed out the remaining mana he had left. He used it to strengthened his own body. His pride didn’t allow him not to be hurt. Even if he was wounded by his magic, he intended to rush forward and punch the Duke in the face.\nThuong!\nIt was the sound of Aren stepping on the ground and pushing forward. His body, which was strengthened by squeezing all remaining mana, was extremely fast and strong.\nHowever, before he knew it, Duke Jespen had appeared right in front of him. He was the same as before, just staring at Aren.\nDuke Jespen was not ready for his magic this time. And, judging by the presence of the ring, Aren wasn’t cursed again.\nAren threw up his fist.\nThup!!\nAren thought.\n‘With a sound this loud, he wouldn’t even be able to show his face in public for a while.’\nHowever, contrary to Aren’s thoughts, it was the sound of Duke Jespen’s fist striking Aren’s face.\nThen, Aren unsightly fell on the ground. He had lost consciousness.\n***\nI watched a brutal battle.\nDuke Jespen continued to give Aren a chance. And…\n‘Was he even considering him as an opponent?’\nIt wasn’t as if he was trying to bully the Mage Tower Lord, he was really giving him a chance. It just showed how kind Duke Jespen really was.\n‘Is it really like that?’\nBlood wouldn’t lie, and it seemed like I finally understood a little bit about where the wicked character of the villainess came from.\nOf course, the problem with the villainess was that unlike Duke Jespen, her personality was dirty even in normal times.\nI looked at Clie, who was sitting far away. She was covering her mouth with her hand.\nWas it to cover her surprise?\nNo, she was laughing in ridicule. She was laughing at the fainting Mage Tower Lord?\nHowever, considering what happened during the banquet, it was understandable. But she was ignoring even the Crown Prince beside her. I became curious and watched Clie carefully.\n“Where are you looking?.”\nThat was what Shael said after confirming my gaze toward Clie.\nGoblin:\nThis is a sponsored release.

      "content": "“Where are you looking?”\nI was startled by Shael’s words. Shael was asking me in cold words. She already knew that my gaze was on Clie!\nShael looked like she was in a bad mood.\nIf you think about it, it kind of made sense. No matter how much she didn’t love me, anyone would feel bad if their fiancé stared at another woman. Even I also wouldn’t like it if Shael stared at another guy.\nAnd, Shael had another reason to not like it, because the woman I was looking at was also the woman who spilled the wine on her dress.\n“I think you were looking at that woman.”\nShael pointed at Clie with her hand.\n‘What should I say? Should I deny it?’\nTo that end, Shael’s words were full of confidence, so I couldn’t.\nIn the end, I just said anything that came to mind.\n“I was just curious about how she could be friends with both the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord.”\n“It wasn’t that kind of look.”\nIf excuses didn’t work, the right answer would be to attack! So, I asked Shael.\n“Are you jealous right now?”\n“Haa?”\nShael, who had been watching me more closely, immediately withdrew her gaze. As expected, for a villainess like her, an attack was the answer rather than an excuse.\nThen, Shael looked at the Mage Tower Lord and said.\n“Good.”\nI laughed.\nSome onlookers who knew of the Mage Tower Lord’s dirty personality also seemed to have similar feelings as Shael. Although they were afraid that the wizards of the Mage Tower would see him, they hid their expression.\nSome people who had only heard of the Mage Tower Lord were sympathetic to him.\nWell, he did pass out, looking really pathetic.\nMoreover, they didn’t know the real reason why the fight between Duke Jespen and the Mage Master was happening. All they knew was that the Mage Tower Lord had challenged Duke Jespen to a duel.\nBecause the fact that I was injured by the Mage Tower Master is unknown except for Duke Jespen, the main characters in the novel, and Shael.\nI didn’t know what would happen if this was passed on to Ezran Baslett, who was my father.\nEven the imperial family couldn’t easily touch the Mage Tower Lord. So would it be different for a duke?\nYes, they indeed could take action if they had good reasons. My injury seems to have been that good reason.\nEven though the Mage Tower Lord had great power, it was the same for the Dukes.\nThe power of the Mage Tower was not purely in the hands of the Mage Tower Lord yet. He would indeed have great power with overwhelming force in the distant future, but not yet.\nOf course, he still had quite a lot of power, but it was far from enough if the opponent was a Duke. So, I didn’t know what the situation would be like if the matter spilled over to Duke Ezran.\nWhat if the Mage Tower Lord was expelled?\nIf so, the development would be very different from the original novel. It was only natural that the identity of one of the male leads would change. The mage who would sit in the seat of the Mage Tower Lord would also change. Do any of the mages of the Mage Tower, who were crazy about magic, possess a normal thought process?\nThere was a high probability that the replacement would have a similar personality as Aren.\nMaybe even worse!\nSo, it was better for Aren, who had an inhibitor called Clie, to be the Mage Tower Lord. Even though his personality was nasty, he’d be easy to deal with than others.\nHe was a necessary existence. He had power that would be of great help even in the war in the future.\nMy injuries were not revealed to the outside world for those reasons. Honestly, it was quite unfair, but I was able to forget it because of what had happened just now. Because the Mage Tower Lord was beaten to a pulp.\n“How much did you eat?”\nShael was eating desserts that looked too sweet even at first glance. She was eating them before the duel started, and was eating even after it ended.\n“What is it?”\nAs if asking what the problem was, Shael asked back.\nCould it be that she was doing this because I told her that she didn’t need to lose weight because she was very light?\nShael was unbridled. Even though she was thin, it wouldn’t be good for her health to eat too much.\nMoreover, even though the fight was over, it was not yet time to get up.\nIt was because Duke Jespen suddenly brought in the family mages to perform a magic performance.\nIt seemed that Shael was going to continue eating the desserts until the spectacle was over.\nBut, I had to put a stop to the villainess’s gluttony!\nSo, I said to Shael.\n“You’ll gain weight.”\n“Didn’t you say that I was already very light?”\nI couldn’t refute her because I really said that.\n“It’s not good for your health.”\n“I am healthy.”\nStill, Shael didn’t listen to me. So I chose another way to deal with her.\nI had to fight poison with poison!\nGoblin:\nThis is a sponsored release.

      "content": "So, I would use a dessert, to control her consumption of desserts.\nI started tearing off the wrapping paper of the box lying next to me. It was my appeasement measure to control the villainess in case of an unexpected event.\nIn the original novel, there was a mention of a dessert shop that the villainess liked. Clie also liked that place, so the two of them often ran into each other.\nIt was also the place where the villainess went every day. She could have just ordered a maid to bring it for her, but she would go there personally because she wanted to eat it right after it was made.\nI was able to remember that information and went to the dessert shop the villainess loved so much.\nThen I learned all the recipes they had for preparing deserts. Strangely, the dessert shop disappeared after that.\nSo there was no way the villainess would have tried this dessert.\nI opened the box and handed a cupcake to Shael.\n“Try it.”\n“…?”\nShael looked at the cupcake, then she took a bite and started eating the cupcake in a hurry. The cupcake was gone in an instant.\n“Where did you buy it?”\n“I made it myself.”\n“…”\nShael went silent and just stared at me. Evidently, it was an unspoken signal for more.\nTo that, I said with a friendly smile.\n“If you stop eating other sweets for today, I’ll give you another one for dinner.”\n“You better.”\nIt wasn’t something one would say from the recipient’s point of view. However, the villainess had finally stopped her gluttony, so I didn’t say anything. Of course, in return, she’d have no more desserts for the time being.\nAt least until tomorrow, she would have to endure.\nI smiled inwardly at Shael and looked around.\nI looked at Clie with a sidelong glance. I needed to figure something out.\nClie had been ignoring the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord for some time now. It was the same even at the moment. She wasn’t even looking at the Crown Prince who was sitting next to her.\nClie was a terminally ill female lead who would eventually be cured of her illness. She was shrewd and had a personality that knew how to exploit her own weakness. However, Clie was acting slightly differently from the original novel.\nI needed to find out why. I doubted that my intervention was the cause. Up until now, I tried to keep other things from changing other than the things that only affect Shael.\nI could think about a number of reasons for her strange behavior.\nFirst of all, what if someone possessed Clie just like me?\nHowever, that assumption was difficult to establish.\nThe Clie that I am looking at now had maintained all of her original habit. The posture of tapping the handle of the seat with the fingers of the right hand and resting the chin on the left hand. It was similar to the cover of the romanic fantasy novel. In the writer’s words, that posture was her habit. So, if someone did indeed possess her, there was no reason for them to retain that habit.\nWasn’t it just a matter of curing her disease and connecting with one of the male leads who liked Clie?\nOf course, even so, the possibility that she was a possessor couldn’t be ruled out.\nHowever, I had another assumption that had a greater probability.\nWhat if the female protagonist was a regressor? In the second half of her novel, it was said that she could only return back in time once with the enormous holy power she later possessed.\nI didn’t understand the reason for that setting, which was completely implausible.\nBecause I didn’t read the ending and side story at all.\nHowever, I was just inferring that the current female protagonist might have regressed using her holy power.\nIn the meantime, Clie stood up. She seemed to be heading for the restroom.\nThis was an opportunity! A golden opportunity to have a talk with Clie.\nI had no intention of intervening with characters other than Shael, but I needed to know how the situation would develop.\n“I’m going to go to the restroom for a moment.”\nShael nodded her head. Fortunately, the restroom was out of sight from the spectators seats.\nI went straight to the restroom, and was able to see Clie, who had gone behind the wall.\nBut, before I could catch up, she went into the bathroom.\nI couldn’t just enter the women’s restroom, so I had to wait outside.\nHowever, Clie came out of the restroom. It was less than three seconds after she had entered.\nAs if she had been waiting for me, Clie proceeded to walk towards my direction even though her seat wasn’t this way. It was also quite strange. There was no doubt that something was different from the original.\nThen, Clie spoke to me.\n“Ah, isn’t it Lord Eran?”\n“Yes.”\nNow, how should I interrogate Clie?\nAfter thinking about it for a while, I was about to say something to her, but someone interrupted me.\n“What are you doing?”\nIt was Shael.\nIt was quite a confusing situation indeed. Doesn’t it look like that Clie and I were secretly meeting each other after prior arrangements?\nEven in such a situation, I couldn’t help but laugh out loud. It was because a small amount of powdered sugar could be seen on Shael’s lips.\nIt was something I had used when making the desserts.\nDid she eat them all in such a short amount of time?\nGoblin:\nThis is a sponsored release.

      "content": "Shael and Clie faced each other. It was Shael who spoke first.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Yes?”\nClie tilted her head as if she didn’t understand. At Clie’s reaction, Shael turned to glare at me.\n‘What should I say?’\nIt was clear that the opportunity to interrogate Clie had passed by.\nSo getting out of this situation was the priority now.\n“It’s not what you are suspecting.”\nIt was true. Even though I deliberately followed Clie, it wasn’t because of what Shael was thinking.\nShael let out a sigh and glared at Clie. Then she took my hand and turned around to leave.\nShael started dragging me away. It happened when I was about to follow her as Shael wished. I heard Claire’s voice.\n“Ah. You dropped this bracelet!”\nClie was holding a pure white bracelet in her hand. However, I didn’t wear a bracelet.\nI couldn’t help but be surprised when I checked the bracelet properly. The bracelet Clie was holding was a bracelet that looked quite familiar.\nIt was the unique snake-shaped bracelet that was on the cover of the romantic fantasy novel. I was able to remember the details because it played a pretty important role in the story.\nIt was a bracelet of holy power that would appear in the mid-to-late half of that romanic fantasy novel.\nThis bracelet would give the wearer enormous holy power and become its source. What’s more, it was a tremendous artifact that even contained various mysterious functions.\nIt served as a surveillance item, and could store various magic. Even if the bracelet was far away, Clie, the owner, would be able to call it back.\nAnyway, it seemed that my assumption was not wrong. Clie must have regressed.\nOtherwise, there was no way this bracelet would appear at this point.\nI looked at Clie. She had a shy smile on her face.\nI must not make a mistake. I had to manage my expression properly.\nThe reason was simple.\nThis bracelet was a big topic because of the owner’s decision. It’s a bracelet that allowed its owner to gain enormous holy power, so it’s natural.\nClie, who was loved by the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord, would eventually take possession of the bracelet. And the owner of the bracelet was decided before Eran Baslett was killed by Shael in the novel.\nTherefore, the Eran Baslett in the novel should have known about the existence of this bracelet.\nSo I immediately understood why Clie was giving this bracelet to me. After she regressed, she must have felt a change from Shael and me.\nClie was looking at me.\nI wonder if Clie thought that I, too, had regressed with her for some reason.\nIf I accept this bracelet, it will be like admitting that I, too, had regressed. Of course I wasn’t a regressor… but… a possessor.\nBut it seemed that it was already too late. Clie, who was quite intelligent, was convinced of this.\nI couldn’t let things go beyond my knowledge. I didn’t really want to intervene in the original plot, but at this point, Shael would get caught up in it again if I didn’t.\nIf I had this bracelet, I could try anything.\nI could talk to Clie, or find other ways to do things through the bracelet. That would be beneficial in many ways, so I received her bracelet she was handing over to me.\n“Yes, thank you.”\n“Yes!”\nClie answered with a bright smile.\nReplying back with a smile, I turned around and walked away.\nFortunately, I was able to get away from the dazzling Clie and contemplated on her reasons for doing the things she was doing.\nShael, who was beside me carefully looked at my bracelet and asked, “What is that bracelet?”\n“Ah, this is a bracelet I happened to get some time ago. I think I dropped it at some point.”\nIt was an excuse because the clothes I was wearing didn’t have pockets.\nWas she feeling suspicious of a bracelet that suddenly appeared? However, Shael didn’t have much interest in what I wear, so it should be alright.\n“Why didn’t you just focus on eating sweets while watching the magic show?” So I was able to change the subject.\n“You didn’t have it before.”\n“I did have it.”\nHowever, the villainess continued to be suspicious. So what I had to do was attack. Like I’ve always done.\n“By the way, what are those powders in your mouth?”\n“…?”\nI personally wiped the powder off Shael’s mouth. Then I said to Shael.\n“Could it be that… you secretly ate the desserts?”\n“…”\n“Looking at your reaction, it seems that I am right.”\nShael remained silent. As if she was reflecting.\n‘Why is this shameless villainess reflecting on things like this?’ Well, it might be because if I get mad, she won’t be able to eat those desserts anymore.\nIt was a very eccentric reason.\nEven then, the proud villainess glared at me out of the corner of her eye, as if the situation was not to her liking. Then she said, “What are you going to do about that?”\nAs expected, she was a villainess with a trashy personality. Stealing my desserts and spitting out such words? She had an absolutely trash mindset.\nSo I immediately punished her.\n“I won’t give it to you for a week.”\n“Ah.”\nAt those words, Shael took her glaring eyes away from me. She just moaned and put on a sad face.\nOkay. In order to somehow get Shael and Clie to meet, there was a setting in the novel called a “Dessert Shop” that Shael would have loved to death.\nHowever, perhaps her love for it was so great that it was beyond what I thought. Because, the next moment, Shael opened her mouth to speak in a low voice, “Sor… y.”\nPerhaps she meant to say that she was sorry. But the words did not carry on to the end.\nIt was only one word, sorry.\nBut it was a huge surprise. No matter how much she liked sweet things, she tried to utter words that meant that she was reflecting!\nEven if she stopped half way, it was a big deal!\nI guess this could be useful!\nI arrived at the arena and took out another box.\nGoblin:\nCheck out the other projects I’m working on in the project page.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "As she showed signs of remorse, I planned to give her another cupcake to Shael.\nBut the box was empty.\nI was sure that there supposed to have been quite a few of them in the box.\nThen the culprit was obvious.\n“I won’t give you anymore this month.”\n“…”\nAt my words, Shael was just maintained her silence.\n***\nShael looked at her fiancé, who was currently lost in his thoughts.\nHe was staring at that repulsive woman.\nIt was the woman that spilled wine on her dress and acted brazenly.\nIt was a woman named Clie Ruspela.\nTo her annoyance, Eran was staring at that woman for a while now.\nShael, who was quite quick-witted, immediately understood the reason.\nIt was because of the Crown Prince, who was sitting next to Clie.\nEran was jealous of the Crown Prince. It was evident that Eran was bewitched by his woman, Clie.\n“Where are you looking?”\nEran was startled by Shael’s question and looked at Shael.\nShael pointed at Clie and said.\n“I think you were looking at that woman.”\n“I was just curious about how she could be friends with both the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord.”\nEran answered Shael’s question. But, she was sure that he was lying.\n“It wasn’t that kind of look.”\n“Are you jealous right now?”\nShael sighed at Eran’s words and looked away from him.\nWas she feeling jealous?\nNot at all!\nShe just couldn’t bear to see Eran be happy. She planned to make Eran suffer all his life.\nMoreover, it would be terrible if Eran became happy with that woman.\nShe was the woman that spilled wine on her dress and acted brazenly!\n‘I won’t let that happen!’\nThought Shael.\nShael began to organize her thoughts while eating her sweets.\nAt that moment, Eran, who was nagging Shael, suddenly took out a cupcake.\nHe then handed the cupcake to Shael.\nAfter receiving the cupcakes from Eran, Shael started to eat it.\n‘Delicious!’’\nIt was different from anything she had ever eaten. Somehow it was strangely delicious.\nShe felt that she had to find out where something so delicious came from. So Shael asked Eran.\n“Where did you buy it?”\n“I made it myself.”\nHe made this delicious thing yourself?\nIt was another reason to torment Eran for the rest of his life.\nAt that time, Eran suddenly stood up. He said that he had to go to the restroom.\nFeeling uneasy about something. Shael felt like she had to follow Eran.\nShe quickly opened the box Eran was hiding, stuffed the dessert into her mouth, and started walking.\n‘Ah, delicious.’\nShael walked while savoring the desserts. Then, she found Eran and Clie.\nIt was as if they were having a secret meeting, behind Shael’s back. There was no way Shael would let this go unnoticed, so she immediately interrupted them.\nThen she took Eran’s hand and tried to get beck to their seat. However, Clie handed a bracelet to Eran.\n‘A bracelet Eran had dropped?’\nIt didn’t seem like it at all. Shael had never seen that bracelet before. Clie used that as an excuse to hand over the bracelet to Eran.\nIt was obvious that she intended secretly give that gift to Eran, while avoiding Shael’s eyes.\nShael became lost thought as they retuned to the arena. While Eran was talking to her, she was in anguish.\nAnyway, the situation might be a little dangerous!\nA scene flashed across her mind. Eran was smiling happily while hugging Clie.\nIt was terrible!\nShe couldn’t bear to see Eran be happy. But it was already too late to prevent that. They had exchanges a bracelet in front of Shael’s eyes!\nAs for Shael, she had to come up with some kind of plan.\nA plan to torment Eran for the rest of his life.\nShael began to think seriously. Before long, she was able to come up with a great solution.\nA simple yet difficult way to put the shackles on Eran.\nIt was marriage.\nIt was a way that would surprise anyone. But Shael didn’t care.\nIn the first place, Shael had no interest in marriage. Even after she married Eran, she would continue to torment Eran as she was doing now. Of course, there was no way she would develop affection towards Eran.\nThe Azbel family and the Baslett family needed a heir to carry on the family line, but it didn’t matter to Shael.\nShael was planning to throw away that enormous responsibility from the start. So she had nothing to lose.\nWouldn’t the future be similar to the life she was living so far?\nOn the contrary, she had a lot to gain.\nA toy that she could torment for the rest of her life, and a servant who would make her delicious desserts she had never eaten before. And, all the misfortune was for Eran.\nShe would laugh at Clie, by taking Eran away from her.\nShael even thought about the possibility, if one day Eran asked her for a divorce.\nShe would throw these word at him:\n[Don’t you love me anymore?]\nMarriage had a great significance in this world. An easy divorce was impossible. Even more so if he had the status of a duke.\nThe villainess started planning a strategy.\nThe name of the operation was— “Scam Marriage!”\nGoblin:\nThis is a sponsored release.

      "content": "Shael began to worry. How, could she pull off that “Scam Marriage”.\nShe thought back to what she had heard a few days ago. It was her memory of the moment in the hospital room, when she overheard the conversation between Duke Jespen and Eran.\n[So that means you will marry Shael.]\nEran gave an unexpected answer to Duke Jespen’s enquiry, it was something which he wouldn’t have affirmed in front of Shael.\n[Yes, someday I will.]\nYes, Eran agreed with that statement. It was also an answer that surprised her when she first heard it.\nIt was the same Eran who had cursed at Shael, saying that she was a bi*ch, so why the hell did Eran reply like that?\nThen, did Eran become that confident in his ability to break the shackles of their marriage?\nHowever, that fact was also quite unclear. Since he was in front of Duke Jespen, he might have said something he didn’t mean at all. Even if what he had said was true, Shael’s strategy wouldn’t be that easy to implement.\nBecause Eran’s ‘someday’ could mean a fairly distant future.\nAbove all, Shael didn’t intend to mention the word ‘marriage’ to Eran first.\nShael was a villainess with self-respect!\nEven if the marriage was a fake marriage aimed to torment Eran, she wouldn’t propose it first.\nIt had to be Eran who asks for her hand in marriage first.\nWasn’t that obvious? It would determine who was above, who would be below.\n‘So I have to make Eran ask for marriage first.’\n‘No, I should make him beg instead of ask for it!’\nShael thought of a way to do that as well. There was only one way. It was to make Eran fall for her!\nHowever, there was no way Shael knew how to do that. Rather, Shael’s actions up until now must’ve made him hate her. Despite that, she was confident that she could seduce Eran without the help of anything else.\nThat much was natural, but…\nBut, Shael got up from her seat. She wanted to find something that could help her.\nThe first place Shael headed was the library. The Azbel family’s library. Shael usually didn’t like books very much, but recently she had been getting a lot of help from books.\nFrom the books on losing weight to books on strengthening her fingers. Those were the books she had read in the Mage Tower’s library.\nShael started looking for books that might help her this time too.\nAnd, one such book caught her eye.\n[Ways to Charm People and Develop Affection]\nEven at a glance, it seemed like a book that could be of great help to Shael. Of course, she didn’t really want to act affectionately towards Eran, but…\nBut, Shael picked up the book. Sudden changes were frightening things. What if she treated him affectionately at first and then, she suddenly changed?\nShe could already imagine the torment Eran would feel from that.\nShael didn’t stop with just one book. She started looking around again.\nThis time, another book caught Shael’s eyes.\n[999 Ways to Develop a Relationship between a Man and a Woman through Pushing and Pulling]\nTaken with the interesting title, Shael picked up the book.\n‘Ways to develop a relationship between a man and a woman through Pushing and Pulling?’\nThe title of the book was completely incomprehensible. It might even mean something completely different to what she was thinking.\n‘If the meaning of this title is anything like my own thoughts, then I will be able to push Eran incredibly well.’ Shael thought. ‘I can even push him off the edge of a cliff!’\nOf course, the title of the book didn’t mean such a thing at all.\nHowever, there was no way that Shael, who was ignorant of such matters, would know this.\nOn top of that, Shael’s relationships with other people wasn’t great. She hadn’t even properly talked to the maids about such matters.\nOnly Shael, after picking up that book, would think that the relationship between a man and a woman was such a strange thing.\nNow she had two books. However, to Shael, it seemed a bit lacking.\nShe was a greedy villainess. So, she went in search of another book.\n[999 Hot Ways to Seduce a Man] (G: Where are these books coming from?)\nShael took out her book without realizing it. Unlike the previous two books, she picked it because of the stimulating title.\n‘Yes, this is perfect.’\nShe hugged the books and headed for her room.\nThese books would give her the knowledge she needed. These books were the foundations upon which she would construct her grand plan.\nShe has arranged the books in the order in which she had picked them.\nThen grabbing the first one, Shael opened the book.\nFlutter…\nShael started reading the book.\nThere was still quite a bit of time before Eran arrived. She had enough time to read a book. So, she should be able to properly prepare.\nThe first thing mentioned in the book was cooking.\nShael stopped reading, because she had never cooked before.\nThen she opened the book again.\n[The important thing is not the taste of the food. Sincerity in cooking the food is important. Even if it doesn’t taste good, he or she will enjoy your dish.]\n‘The taste is not important.’\nShael immediately started reading more.\nGoblin:\nThis is a sponsored release.

      "content": "Many recommended dishes and recipes were written in the book. Among them, her favorite was the cookies.\nShael went straight to the Azbel family's kitchen. She kicked out the cooks. She then started pulling out the ingredients.\nShe started following the recipe exactly as it was in the book.\nGradually, cookies that didn’t seem that bad on the outside were being made.\n[Please add a tablespoonful of sugar.]\nShael ignored that instruction from the recipe and added five tablespoons of sugar.\n‘If it’s a cookie, shouldn’t it be sweet?’\n‘No, maybe even five spoons aren’t enough.’\nSo Shael added five more spoons. Then she started following the recipe again.\nBefore long, a sweet smell began to waft from the finished cookies.\nIt was the completion of a batch of perfect and delicious cookies!\nShael returned to the room with her cookies and started reading again.\nShe finished reading the book before she knew it. As she closed the book, she heard a knock on the door.\n‘It must be Eran.’\nKnock-tock!\nShael, who had already hidden the books, stood up from her seat and opened the door.\nIt was something she had just read in the book.\n[During meetings, go open the door and greet the other person.]\n“Please have a seat.”\nShael even pulled a chair for him to sit on. Eran sat down in his seat, and looked at Shael with a suspicious gaze.\n“What’s with these cookies?”\nEran asked while looking at the cookies on the table.\nShael spoke up according what she had read in the book.\n“Ah, these are the cookies I made myself. Try it.”\nEran looked at Shael in surprise and picked up a cookie, then took a bite.\nWhile thinking about the contents of the book, Shael kept her eyes on Eran.\n[When feeding homemade food, keep your eyes on the other person.]\nIt was something that was emphasized over and over again in the book.\n“It’s delicious.”\nIt was a success!\n“It’s very tasty, so try it.”\nSuddenly, Eran handed a cookie to Shael. He wanted her to eat it as well.\nShael, who also wanted to eat something sweet, readily received the cookie.\nThe cookie was very sweet and delicious.\nOf course, it wasn’t as delicious when compared to Eran’s cupcakes she ate the other day, but it was still pretty good. Shael thought that she seemed to have a talent for cooking.\nThe batch of cookies slowly disappeared before she knew it.\nAfter that, Shael began to recall the content of the book again.\n‘What to do next..’\n[When there is nothing to do, keep an eye on the other person]\nNow she had to keep an eye on Eran.\nEran was also looking at Shael with an expression as if he was in doubt.\n[If the other person also looks at you, smile warmly.]\nNow she had to smile warmly. But it didn’t come that easily to Shael.\n‘What does a warm smile look like?’\nShael frowned, but she was able to smile. Even if she had to force herself.\n‘A little awkward, but perfect.’\nAt least that’s how Shael thought anyway.\nMaybe before long, she might even be proposed to by her fiancé!\n***\n“Ah, these are the cookies I made myself. Try it.”\nI picked up a cookie that Shael said she had made himself.\nI felt a bit uneasy considering that Shael had made it herself.\nSo, I took a cautious bite..\nAs expected, my prediction wasn’t wrong. Cookies were too sweet.\n‘Isn’t this just a lump of powdered sugar?’\nShael was looking at me. She must have purposely added more sugar and given it to me.\nIt must be like that.\nAnyway, was she doing it because of what happened the other day?\nOr, was it because he didn’t make her any desserts?\n“It’s delicious.”\nI lied to induce Shael to eat the cookie as well.\nThis wicked woman will be tricked by my words and would also eat these tasteless cookies.\n“It’s very tasty, so try it.”\nI handed a cookie over to her, while claiming that it was delicious, and Shael also picked it up.\nThe villainess was easily tricked by me.\nOddly enough, Shael started eating the cookies as if they were delicious.\n‘Is she acting in order not to lose to me?’\nI couldn’t tell.\nSuddenly, the cookies disappeared. Shael, who started eating later than me, ate most of them.\nLooking at the empty cookie bowl, I felt Shael’s gaze again.\nShael was looking at me.\nNo, she was staring.\n‘Is this because her forced yourself to eat cookies?’\nIf that was the case, then it would have been better if we had stopped halfway.\nI couldn’t understand Shael’s way of thinking.\nThen, Shael, who was staring at me, suddenly frowned. The corners of her mouth went up and then her down again.\nAfter repeating it several times, what Shael produced on her lips was, a sneer.\nThe villainess was sneering at me.\n‘Why is she doing this?’\nGoblin:\nCheck out the other projects I’m working on in the project page.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "I didn’t do anything except tell her to eat the cookies, but the villainess was sneering at me.\nIt was an action that would make anyone curious about the reason why. Didn’t she even think that the cookies tasted good?\nBut I accepted it normally. Because it was a common thing for this wicked woman to sneer at me.\nOf course, it was also a common thing for me to fire back in response.\nTherefore, I said to Shael, who was still sneering at me.\n“Would you like to go for a walk?”\nObviously, it was an offer Shael would reject. In fact, we had never had a proper walk outside before.\nSo I prepared to get something out of my pocket. It was a Serpent Orb. A Serpent Orb containing Shael’s dark history.\nHowever, what Shael said next was quite unexpected.\n“Let’s go, then.”\nShael accepted my offer. An offer she would normally have turned down without even thinking about it.\nI felt doubtful about Shael’s behavior and thought that something about her had changed, but for now, I followed Shael and got up.\n“Where are we going?”\nThat’s what Shael asked me.\n‘Yes, where should we go…’\nActually, I was just going to use the Serpent Orb and say something to make fun of the villainess who was sneering at me.\nBut, who knew that the villainess would agree to go out with me so easily? I wonder what made her change her mind.\nThat’s right!\nThe last time, didn’t I go to the auction house and the Mage Tower just because Shael wanted it. I was forced into it! So, it would only be proper for me to choose a place that I would enjoy.\nMoreover, it would also have to be a place that would help me improve the villainess.\nCome to think of it, the villainess’s stamina was particularly bad. She became tired quite easily even when she danced in the Mage Tower.\n‘And, she also ate a lot of sweets…’\nI was quite worried about her health.\nThe villainess needed exercise.\nSo what I chose was mountain climbing. Climbing would help the villainess with her poor stamina.\nShael didn’t know that and silently followed me.\nWe went through the teleportation magic circle in Azbel Plaza.\nFortunately, a teleportation magic circle was set up even to the mountain range of the Azbel territory, which required a lot of magic stones.\nShael glared at me after taking a look at the huge mountain in front of us.\nBut when our eyes met, she removed her glaring eyes and looked straight ahead as if nothing had happened.\nShe normally would have glared at me several times and turned around saying she wanted to go back to the mansion right away. But, it seemed that Shael’s personality had softened a little.\nI couldn’t figure out why.\n‘Ah! Did she really want to eat the dessert I made?’\nIt was a good reason.\nIn the book, there was even a setting where the villainess would’ve loved the dessert to death.\nIn the magic bag I was carrying, there was also the dessert that Shael wanted.\nMaybe she was acting like that after realizing that.\nFirst of all, I started climbing the seemingly endless mountain with Shael.\n“It’s hard.”\nIt was 30 minutes after we started climbing. We couldn’t even see the top yet.\nBut, Shael frowned at me, saying it was difficult.\nKeeping an eye at Shael’s frown for quite a while, I could tell that Shael was able put up with her displeasure for a longer period of time than I had previously thought.\nIf it were the usual Shael, she would have expressed dissatisfaction as soon as she had a hard time.\n“Let’s go down.”\n“No.”\nI wasn’t struggling at all, and Shael was the only one struggling, but not to the extent that her breathing turned rough.\nSo if we went down now, the exercise won’t have any effect. It would be meaningless to come here at all.\nAt my words, Shael started climbing the mountain again. This time too, Shael followed my words.\nBut that was short-lived.\n“I want to go down. Climb it yourself.”\nAs usual, Shael was expressing her dissatisfaction again. She was different from before.\nThe villainess had been following my words until now, but finally she had returned to normal.\n‘Is it a good thing?’\nI don’t know.\nFirst of all, I opened the magic bag to bring out the secret weapon. What I took out was a box of cookies.\nThis, too, was made with a recipe from a dessert shop that Shael would’ve loved to death.\n“Here, try it.”\nI took out a cookie and handed it to Shael.\nShael took a bite. I’ve been waiting for that\n“…!”\nThen Shael raised her eyes and looked at my cookie box. I smiled at Shael and started climbing the mountain again.\nIt was a silent threat! If you don’t climb the mountain, then I won’t give you more cookies.\nShael followed me without a word. I also climbed the mountain without a word.\nThen, Shael broke the silence first.\n“I can’t walk anymore.”\n“If you make it to the top, I will give you the cookies.”\n“Cookies.”\nOf course, the villainess followed suit. In regards to her words and other actions, I laughed out loud.\nIt was natural for the villainess to reply with a glare.\nThe Shael, who had been following my words without any rewards, completely disappeared.\nNow she was just doing my bidding for the reward— the cookies.\nGoblin:\nThis is a sponsored release.

      "content": "Shael and I were on top of the mountain before we knew it. A cool breeze blew from everywhere. It was a rewarding climb in its own way.\n“Please eat.”\nI handed a cookie to Shael. The cookies were disappearing pretty fast.\nWell, not as fast as the time when Shael ate all the cupcakes without my knowledge.\nThese cookies were different!\nAt my words, Shael started glaring at me with the cookie in her mouth.\n“At least you’re being useful for now…”\nAre you saying that I’ll be no longer needed when the cookies are gone?\nThe villainess was being really straight forward now.\nTherefore, I had to tone her down a bit.\n“Okay, now we have to go down.”\n‘If you climb a mountain, isn’t it natural to go down?’\nShe showed a bewildered reaction as if she hadn’t thought of that.\nThen Shael, who was sitting on a rock, said, “Because of someone, my legs can’t move.”\nIt seemed that Shael had even overworked her legs for cookies. I didn’t expect that she would tire out her legs that much.\n“The I’ll just leave you here.”\n“What?”\nOf course I was joking. I pointed to my back so that I could carry Shael.\nShael, who hesitated for a moment, saw that the sky getting dark and leaned on my back.\nI began to descend the mountain with Shael on my back.\nIf this was a novel, this kind of scene would be considered a romantic scene.\nBut, it wasn’t the same for Shael and me. Rather, it would be a bloody scene.\nI could imagine Shael frowning at the back.\nNo, Shael would definitely be like that. I could tell without looking at her face now.\n“You’re heavy. You should stop eating sweets.”\n“Ha…”\nThe villainess glared at me, and I also fired back. It was a daily routine that had began from that day.\nI just laughed out loud, because I felt strange about the repetition of this eccentric daily routine and the fact that I was getting used to it.\n***\nKikiiik!\nIt was the sound of a door opening. Without knocking.\nDuke Jespen was entering Shael’s room.\nIt was to move his daughter, who had fallen asleep in the chair, to her bed.\nThen Duke Jespen checked the books on Shael’s desk. He found it strange that Shael, who hated books so much, was reading books.\nHowever, Duke Jespen couldn’t help but be surprised when he checked the titles of the books.\n[999 Ways to Develop a Relationship between a Man and a Woman through Pushing and Pulling]\n[999 Hot Ways to Seduce a Man]\nDuke Jespen jaws almost dropped to the floor in surprise at the bizarre title of the books.\nHis precious daughter was making her own efforts to connect with her fiancé.\nHowever, there was no way Shael could easily succeed.\nAs a father, how could he just watch this situation go on?\n‘I have to do something!’\nThought Duke Jespen.\n***\nShael was tearing up the book.\nThe book, which used to be titled [Ways to Charm People and Develop Affection] had been reduced to such a state that even the title was unrecognizable.\n‘I did it at the risk of shame, but there was no progress at all!’\nActually, it was Shael, who didn’t follow the contents of the book at all from the time Eran told her to keep climbing the mountain, but…\nShael had endured as much as she could, in her own way. However, in Shael’s opinion, this book wasn’t helpful at all.\n‘Oh, except that I was able to master the recipe for sweet and savory cookies.’\nOf course, that wasn’t Shael’s purpose.\nShael pulled out another book.\n[999 Ways to Develop a Relationship between a Man and a Woman through Pushing and Pulling]\nFlutter!\nShael opened the book. She then began to skim through it.\n[First of all, you have to push the target away. You need to make your target feel your cold side.]\n[When the other person is talking, look at them coldly and answer them.]\n[It’s also important to look at them as if they’re annoying.]\nLook at Eran coldly and answer. And look at him like he’s annoying?\nShael asked herself,\n‘Isn’t that what I usually do to Eran?’\nShael suddenly had the urge to tear the book apart right away.\n‘Are these really behaviors that help develop relationships between men and women?’\n‘Not at all!’\nThought Shael.\n‘No, what if these words are true…’\nShael felt hesitant.\nSo, she continued turning the pages.\nAgain, what she read in the book was what she had been doing to Eran from the start.\nThe impatient villainess closed the book without bothering to read more.\nThe she though,\n‘Let’s read the next one.’\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "The book that made Shael feel embarrassed was torn to shreds.\nOf the books Shael had picked out, only one remained.\n[999 Hot Ways to Seduce a Man]\n‘Yes, I liked the title of this book from the beginning.’\nThe other books didn’t have a title as interesting as this one.\nThis time, Shael was strangely confident for herself.\nFlutter…\nShael started reading the book. As expected, this time it wasn’t as bad at all.\nDifferent from the previous books she had read, there were many tips that would be very helpful to Shael.\nAt some point, the clock pointed to the time Eran would come.\nShael, who had already familiarized herself with the contents of the book, began to devise her own strategy.\nFirst of all, Shael started to change her clothes.\n[To captivate men, wear thin clothes.]\nWhat Shael chose for this was a thin dress. There wasn’t much exposure, but it was quite thin. That’s why she chose it.\nNext, Shael prepared a pair of high-heeled shoes as well. This was also mentioned in the book.\nIt was a perfect preparation!\nShael waited for Eran. Before long, Eran came in.\nEven that short amount of time felt like a long wait for Shael. But, the time had finally come.\nShael pondered over the contents of the book.\n[Please act differently than usual.]\nThat was a really difficult task.\n‘How exactly should I act?’\nFirst of all, Shael said something different than usual.\n“Go out.”\nIt meant that she wanted to go out together. Adding to that, it was a suggestion that she wouldn’t normally make at all.\nEran tilted his head at those words.\n“Isn’t it too much to ask someone who has just arrived to leave?”\n“…”\nEran had misunderstood Shael’s words.\nThe word “Go out” was interpreted to mean that only Eran should leave the room, not to go out together.\n“Let’s go out together. Because it’s boring here.”\nAt those words, Eran, who was staring at Shael in surprise, stood up. Shael also got up and left the room.\n[Be proactive.]\n‘Be proactive?’\nShael walked while contemplating on the part that had been emphasized in the book.\nHer pace, which should have been leisurely, became faster. Shael started walking ahead of Eran.\nShe was doing it in order to lead where they would be going. First of all, Shael started walking toward the Azbel family’s garden.\nTagak!\nShe was wearing a higher heel than usual, so it was making a sound she wasn’t used to. Originally, she would have worn shoes with a much lower heel than this one.\n‘Maybe that’s why I feel especially uncomfortable?’\nEran was watching this carefully.\nAs mentioned in the book, would high heels really work for Eran?\nShael didn’t know.\nAt that moment, she shuddered as they were walking towards the garden.\n‘Did I wear the thin clothes for nothing?’\nThe weather was colder than Shael thought.\nWheeiing…\nA cold wind blew. The wind hit Shael’s body.\nNevertheless, Shael didn’t give in, and she continued walking towards the garden.\nThen Shael had no choice but to stop. It was because she felt a presence behind her.\nIt was Eran who was following Shael. He was standing right behind Shael before he knew it.\n“Why are you wearing that stupid outfit in this weather?”\nAfter saying that, Eran put his own coat on Shael.\nShael grinned. It happened as it was in the book.\n[If your target sees your thin clothes and lends you a coat, that’s a success. It means that he has a lot of feelings for you.]\n“What are you laughing at? Please walk before I take it away.”\nEran’s words were thorny as usual.\nDespite the words that she would normally have refuted, Shael remained silent.\nFinally, she got some meaningful results by following the book!\nIt made Shael feel better. As if to show Shael’s mood, her steps became even faster than before.\nTagak!\nTagak!\nIt was the sound of Shael’s heals.\nEran and Shael, who were walking silently, could only hear that sound.\nHowever, another sound was added to it.\nIt was also the sound of Shael’s shoes as well.\nAt the strange sound, Shael looked at her shoes. The heel of her shoe was broken.\n“You need to lose some weight.”\nEran said after checking Shael’s shoes. Shael’s mood, which had improved for a moment, rapidly worsened.\n“It’s because the shoes are cheap.”\nIt was a lie. The shoes looked precious even at a glance.\nEran stopped Shael from continuing to walk and made her sit on a nearby bench.\nHe held Shael’s shoes and cut them with his magic to make walking easier.\nGoblin:\nThis is a sponsored release.

      "content": "When Eran gave the shoes back to Shael, the distance between them became very close.\nShael thought,\n‘This is my chance!’\nShael quickly thought of the contents of the book.\n[[If your target is within your reach, tug on his tie.]\nShael quickly reached out her hand towards Eran’s chest, where his tie would be.\nHowever, when Shael carefully checked Eran’s chest with her eyes, she couldn’t help but panic.\n‘Didn’t Eran usually wear his tie every time?’\nBut not this time. Eran wasn’t wearing his tie.\n‘Why?’\nHowever, it was already too late for such a question. Shael’s hand had nowhere else to go, and it caused her to lose her balance.\nThen, without realizing it, Shael’s hand fell on Eran’s chest!\n‘Eran’s chest is surprisingly solid…’\nIt was a strange situation that others would easily misunderstand.\nEran and Shael faced each other.\n“…”\n“…”\nA moment of silence. Before Shael could even take her hand back, Eran spoke up.\n“I didn’t expect you to have such a taste.”\nEran was talking while laughing.\nFeeling ashamed of her action, the villainess stretched out her hand again.\nThis time, it was to grab Eran by the collar.\nHowever, the situation did not go the way Shael wanted.\nShael’s hand fell on Eran’s chest once again.\nEran’s strong chest made it impossible for her to even grab him by the throat.\n“…”\nFeeling that the situation was turning weird again, Shael quickly removed her hand. Then she started walking as if nothing was wrong.\nShe gave Eran an extra glare as a bonus for making fun of the with his nasty mouth.\n‘Should I tear that book apart as well?’\nAfter thinking for a while, the villainess shook her head.\nCome to think of it, wasn’t it all her own mistake?\nShe should have checked properly that Eran was wearing a tie. What a stupid mistake to make.\nShael said herself,\n‘This time I will definitely not make a mistake!’\nShael started walking, vowing to perfectly execute her plan.\nSuddenly, she saw the garden.\nAt the same time, the time for the next step had come!\nThe garden was a place perfect for romance.\nUsing the narrow street Shael decreased their distance, and came closer to the wall.\nShael suddenly pushed Eran toward the wall. She then began to simulate the scene she had seen in the book in her mind.\n‘Left hand on the wall, with Eran in-between.’\nIn the book, it was an act that was referred to as ‘Climbing the wall’.\n[Keep your eyes on the target and place your left hand on the wall. Then, look down and stare deeply into their eyes. If your target blushes, it’s your win.]\n“…?”\nIgnoring the startled Eran, Shael tried to look at his eyes.\n‘Didn’t it tell me to look down and stare deeply into his eyes?\nBut she couldn’t. Rather, it was Eran who was looking down at Shael, and she was just looking up at him.\n‘Was he this tall before?’\nShael was taken aback. This wasn’t in the plan, and Eran’s face didn’t turn red, rather he was making a shocked expression.\nShael, who was supposed to look down at Eran with a deep gaze, started dodging her eyes in confusion.\nHowever, there was no way Shael would back down!\nShael quickly revised the old plan. She could do it due to the way she had been living.\nIn Shael’s mind, a perfect plan was formed before in an instant.\nOf course, the urgent plan was not perfect.\nBut it didn’t matter to the villainess, she carried out the plan she had revised without thinking.\nShael’s left hand touched the wall. Then she kept Eran between her and the wall.\nAs a result, Eran suddenly found himself trapped in Shael’s arms.\n“…”\n“…”\nShael, who was silent for a while, looked at Eran. Then she immediately lowered her head.\nNo, she had no choice but to do so.\nThe reason being, the distance was too close.\nIt was a natural result, as she was basically leaning against the wall with her arm wrapped around Eran.\nThe current situation was very different from what Shael had imagined and planned.\nOriginally, according to the picture in the book, she was going to gaze deeply at Eran, while keeping him between herself and the wall.\nHowever, the current situation was quite different compared to the picture in the book.\nIn the current situation, it looked as if Shael was hugging Eran.\nEran’s body, which had different proportions than she had expected, was the reason for such a debacle.\nKyaaa!\nKyaaagh!\nUnknown to the two, the maids and Duke Jespen who had witnessed the situation began to clamor.\nShael lowered her head and thought.\n‘This weakling who lost consciousness from just one attack of the Mage Tower Lord, a moth who often quarrels and doesn’t even give me his dessert. My fiancé…’\n‘This person, was his shoulders this wide?’\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Duke Jespen just happened to see Shael and Eran while passing by the garden with the servants.\nEran and Shael would normally be in Shael’s room.\nSeeing Shael’s expression, Duke Jespen was convinced. This situation was Shael idea!\nIt seemed that Shael herself had suggested that they should go for a walk together.\nAnd looking at Shael’s expression again, he understood that she was planning something.\nAfter confirming that fact, Duke Jespen began to activate his mana.\nThe servants stood still, holding their breath, as nn incredibly complex magic circle was drawn next to Duke Jespen.\nWhat kind of magic was he trying to use?\nTo the servants, the shape of the magic circle was rather familiar.\nIt was teleportation magic!\nDuke Jespen suddenly disappeared.\nThen he appeared again. He was gone for less than 5 seconds.\nThere was a chair in Duke Jespen’s hand, and he held a plate of sweet cookies in his other hand.\nIt was obvious, the reason Shael liked sweet things was because of heredity. It was in her blood.\nDuke Jespen sat in his chair and started snacking on the cookies while watching Shael and Eran’s budding romance.\n‘I’m sorry for Shael, but isn’t this the Azbel family’s garden?’\nIt was wrong for them to do such a thing in public in the first place. As it was a place where many members of the family walked around.\n“…!”\nIt was at that moment, Shael pushed Eran to the wall. She faced Eran and placed her left hand on the wall. It was an amazing scene!\nDuke Jespen began stuffing even more cookies in his mouth.\nSeeing this, the butler on the side frowned and began to sweat.\n“Do you want to eat?” Duke Jespen’s eyes widened as he spoke to the butler.\n“Gwa, it’s okay, My Lord.”\nAt some point, Shael had hugged Eran, and Duke Jespen almost shed tears of emotion.\nKyaaa!\nHe also began to clamor along with the voices of the maids, but before he knew it, the cookies had disappeared.\nShael was still hugging Eran.\nSatisfied with Shael’s boldness, Duke Jespen smiled happily and left.\nIf Shael found out about this, he would be in big trouble.\nBut when he thought back to the scene, Eran’s face had only showed his bewilderment. Eran’s face didn’t turn red.\nIt was clear that Duke Jespen’s help was required in this matter.\nApparently, he had to move forward with the operation.\n‘But not now.’\nThe Duke of Jespen walked to his wife, Enella Azbel.\nIt was because even Duke Jespen was hungry for love after witnessing the relationship between Eran and Shael.\n***\nShael took her arms away from the wall.\n‘Why the hell are you doing things like this?’\nShe made me walk behind her before, and this time she was even hugging me.\nIt seems that Shael’s mind has been going crazy lately. No, she was weird from the beginning, but…\n‘To think that she’d do such a things in the middle of the day.’\nShael’s face was red. The ignorant villainess seemed to have finally realized that there were many servants around.\nAfter taking a moment to carefully choose my words, I asked Shael with the usual tone,\n“What the hell was that?”\n“…”\nShael stayed silent at my words and walked toward the garden.\nAt the same time, she glared at the maids who were staring at Shael.\nThe maids quickly left the garden.\nBecause of that, only Shael and I were present in the garden right now.\nThe Azbel family’s garden was very large. It was so big, it could be called a forest.\nShael walked towards the pond in the center.\nHer face was still red. Clearly, the villainess was still feeling ashamed.\n‘Well, it deserves it.’\nI stopped making fun of Shael and started walking behind her.\nThe villainess liked to step on the beautiful flowers. So, I had to use healing magic to fix the flowers.\nWe arrived at the pond before I knew it. There I saw a familiar fish that I had seen with Shael the other day.\nIt was catfish.\nJust like at the Mage Tower, the catfish were friendly towards Shael this time as well.\nOriginally, there shouldn’t have been any such fish in the pond. But since there was an abundance of catfish here, it seemed that Shael was behind it.\n“I don’t think it was originally there, but did you release it by any chance?”\nAt my words, Shael nodded her head.\nIt seemed that my guess was correct.\n‘Could it be that the catfish suited the villainess’ taste?’\nI couldn’t understand her taste at all.\nShael stared blankly at the catfish. She just quietly stood still.\nIt was a very elegant scene. Except for the fact that the target she was looking at was a catfish.\nStill, it was the first time I felt the human side of Shael.\nJust a few days ago… didn’t she step on the flowers she said she liked and scared the birds?\nJust looking at her stand quietly like this made me feel something new about Shael.\nIt’s just… I couldn’t understand why she was staring at the catfish.\nNo, looking at it like this, catfish did look somewhat cute.\n‘Have I also become weird because of the villainess?’\nPlop!\nA powerful catfish came right in front of Shael.\nIt seemed a bit awkward, but on the contrary, it looked quite cute.\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "This drew Shael’s attention as well. Shael began to look at the catfish carefully.\n“I like this guy.”\n“What do you mean?”\nYou mean to take it to the mansion and raise it? If so, it was a reasonable hobby in its own way. Compared to trampling on flowers or harassing wild birds.\nHowever, Shael’s words that followed shattered my imagination.\n“No, let’s eat it.” (G: there’s an innuendo here, did you get it?)\n“Yes?”\n‘You want to eat it?’\nDidn’t she just stare at it, and call it cute?\nEven after doing that, you want to eat this cute little guy?\nAs she said, Shael snatched the tail of the catfish that was pacing in front of her. She was really quick to to put her thoughts into action.\n“It would be better to grill it, right?”\n“…”\nI didn’t answer. I was just sending a silent prayer towards the poor catfish who was going to lose its life.\n‘Rest in peace, Mr. Catfish.’\nI didn’t bother to stop Shael. She just wanted to eat her own fish, what could I say to that?\nSo the reason Shael was staring at the catfish and called this one cute because she was choosing which catfish to eat? At least I would like to take it that way.\n‘Yeah, let’s assume she did it to decide which catfish to eat.’\nWithout any opinions, I walked along with Shael, who was walking while holding the catfish.\nThe catfish was running rampant to escape Shael’s grasp. Immediately following that, the poor fellow lost its life as a result of Shael’s magic.\n“Cruel.”\n“You have to do that to eat it.”\nI shut my mouth at Shael’s words. Come to think of it, this was also a big improvement!\nIf it was in the original novel, wouldn’t the she have slowly dried the catfish and killed it painfully?\nThinking that way made me feel that Shael was doing good.\nAs Shael walked along the pond, she suddenly grinned.\nI immediately had a foreboding feeling.\nBecause it was a signal the villainess sent before harassing me.\nThe wicked woman moved her gaze towards the pond.\nThe water in the pond was gushing into the air.\nIt was magic. Before I knew it, the water was rushing towards me.\nEven though I hurriedly spread the Ice Wall to block it, it couldn’t stop my clothes from getting soaked.\n“…”\n“Pffttt!”\nShael laughed at me. Then it faded soon after.\nA shadow was falling on Shael before she knew it. It was another rush of water from the pond.\nAnd the water continued to pour.\nShael was drenched before she knew it. Even her hair was drenched wet.\nHowever, the villainess didn’t look angry.\nWhy? Because I was soaking wet too.\nOf course, I used another magic to tease Shael, and my clothes suddenly became dry.\nShael couldn’t use this type of magic yet.\nShael stared at my already dry clothes.\nI sighed and sneered at her, then started walking.\n“What are you doing? Are you not coming?”\n“…”\nThe villainess didn’t walk and made a silent protest.\nSo, I had no choice but to dry Shael’s clothes as well. I had to do it because the weather was very cold.\nWe came back to the mansion before long. After putting the catfish in the storage, I came to Shael’s room.\nAfter breathing in the outside air and clearing my head, I started looking around Shael’s room.\nIt was a very spacious room, with a huge door, and a huge desk.\nEverything seemed huge and extravagant.\nEven the windows looked quite luxurious.\nThen something caught my eye. Something that was completely out of place in this huge and extravagant room.\nIt was a teddy bear. It was the teddy bear with one eye sewn up that I gave her at the Mage Tower.\nIt was placed on Shael’s bed.\n“Do you still have that doll?”\n“…”\nIt was quite a surprise. Shael still hadn’t abandoned that doll.\nI didn’t comment on it any more, as I felt like Shael would throw the doll away if I said more.\nThe sun was setting before we knew it.\nDark night was enveloping the Azbel family’s mansion.\nIt was also time for me to go.\nHowever, for some unknown reason, Shael was looking towards her bed.\nThen she walked over to her bed and pulled the blanket off. What was inside, was a book.\nShael opened the book for a moment, and quickly started flipping through the book.\n‘What the hell are you doing?’\nUnable to hold back my curiosity, I used Vision Magic.\n[If night falls…]\nI couldn’t read more. It was because Shael closed the book.\nShael tucked the book under the blanket again.\nThen she got out of the bed and came to me.\nShe was grinning. It was an ominous sign, something she did before harassing me.\nShael came right in front of me before I knew it.\nAfter thinking for a while, she opened her mouth to say a few words. Words that were very shocking to my ears.\n“Do you want to eat catfish?”\n‘What?’\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "After saying such shocking words to Eran, Shael took Eran to the Azbel family’s dining room.\nEran just followed Shael in flustered state. And… after eating the cooked catfish, Shael and Eran returned to the room again.\nShael recalled another instruction from the book she had covered with a blanket.\n[After that, suggest the target to go to bed.]\n‘Suggest him to go to bed?’ Shael followed the instruction and said to Eran.\n“Go to bed.”\n“Yes… yes?”\nHonestly, she didn’t really want to say it, but it was something instructed in the book. And, it was also a part that was emphasized as being really important!\nIgnoring her fiancé, who had frozen in place like an idiot, Shael headed to her bed.\nLifting off the blanket, she reached out her hand for the book.\n[999 Hot Ways to Seduce a Man]\nShael wanted to know what she had to do next, as she still hadn’t read the latter part yet.\nShe opened the book and began to read.\n[If the opponent accepts it…]\nShael tore the book to shreds after reading the rest. Before long, the state of the book had changed beyond recognition.\nIf she had known that it would be like that, she would have torn it apart from the start!\nIt was something so obvious that anyone could have predicted it, but not Shael. She was a villainess who had no interest in dating at all.\nShael regretted her past decision to follow the instructions of this book, and racked her brain to think of a plan to get rid of Eran.\n***\nShael suddenly tore the book in front of her to shreds, and at the moment, she looked quite absent-minded.\nThen she came to her senses and told me.\n“Get out.”\n“Didn’t you just tell me to go to bed?”\n“Out.”\nThe villainess kept changing her words. And this isn’t even my house, so normally, I’d just leave, but…\nFor some reason, I felt like I shouldn’t. Adding to that, I felt quite offended by her sudden change of words.\nYou embarrassed me by telling me to go to bed and now you’re kicking me out so coldly?\n‘There’s no way I’ll just quietly leave!’\nSo I pointed at the torn book Shael was hiding with her hand.\n“Is it because of that book?”\n“Never, no!”\nShael shook her head in denial. It was a strong reaction, but it was obvious that it was a lie.\nThat book was the reason for Shael’s erratic behavior.\n“Then, can I have a look?”\nShael quickly covered the torn book in response to my words. It was clear that that book was a source of great shame for Shael.\n“No!”\n“I won’t see it if you let me sleep on the bed.”\n“…”\nThe villainess glared at me in response.\nThinking that the villainess might burn the book, I cast a protection spell on the book.\nSeeing this, Shael looked at the book in bewilderment. Now, she had no choice.\nWhen I acted as if I was checking the torn pieces of a book, Shael had no choice but to give in.\n“Then, go to another room and sleep.”\n“I won’t. I like it here.”\nThen, as I was about to walk towards the torn book, Shael stopped me in a fright.\nIt was my victory!\nThat’s how I was able to stay in Shael’s room. Normally, it would have already been time for me to leave Shael’s room.\nTo be honest, I did think I had acted a bit too rash, but…\n‘It’s the villainess fault!’\nI struggled to rationalize.\nAnyway, everyone in the Azbel family would notice if I slept in another room.\nThere might even be a rumor that Shael had suggested that I sleep at Azbel Mansion\n‘No, wouldn’t such rumors spread even if I sleep here?’\n‘I don’t know.’\nThere was also a huge sofa in Shael’s room. I walked over to the sofa and sat down.\nIf I declared that I would sleep on the bed like we did in the Mage Tower, it was almost certain that Shael, who had been enduring until now, would leave the room. In fact, she was probably thinking about leaving the room even now.\nBecause the situation was different from the Mage Tower, in which there was risk of being cursed after leaving.\nIt’s a pity that I had to sleep on the sofa, but it was still something I had to do.\nShael was already lying on the bed. Oddly enough, she didn’t lie down with her back facing towards me.\nShael lay down in a way she could see me. Normally, she would’ve slept with her back turned because she wouldn’t want to see me.\n“What is it?”\n“What is it?”\nWe asked at the same time.\n“Why are you lying down this way?”\n“It’s to make sure you don’t do something weird, so don’t worry.”\n‘Ah, was it like that?’\nThe villainess was treating me like a perve*t.\n“So it isn’t because you love me?”\nTo be honest, it felt a bit embarrassing, but it was a good counter for the villainess.\nAt that, Shael glared at me and turned her body around.\nAnyway, the villainess was easy to manipulate.\nLooking closely at Shael, I saw something unexpected.\nIt was a doll that protruded a little out of the blanket Shael was covering herself with.\nI think she slept like that even in the Mage Tower.\n‘Could it be that she has always been doing that?’\nIt was completely uncharacteristic for someone like Shael.\nAfter some time passed, I could heart a soft sound of breathing from Shael.\nAt the same time, I used a magic that could block out sound.\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

It was part of my nightly magic training session.\nEven if I had used the sound blocking magic, I had properly controlled the area of effect so that, as the magic caster, only I could hear the sounds.\nI’ve been doing this magic training since I was injured by the Mage Tower Lord.\nI had realized that only training in the morning wasn’t enough.\nEveryday after breakfast, I had to come accompany Shael, so I didn’t have enough time to practice magic.\nThat’s why I started practicing at night while reducing my sleep time.\nAfter some time, drowsiness enveloped me before I know it. And, I too, leaned back on the sofa and began to fall asleep.\n***\nThe sunlight shined through the windows. The huge windows began to light up Shael’s room.\nI immediately got up from the sofa. I woke up a bit early today, and considering how long she had slept in the Mage Tower, there was no way that Shael would wake up at such a time.\nIt would probably take a few more hours for her to wake up.\nAfter stretching, I used the sound blocking magic again.\nIt was time to start practicing magic.\nSuddenly, I felt movement from Shael, who was on the bed.\nIt seemed that Shael was now awake.\nSo I asked her, “Are you awake?”\nOf course, there was no need to turn off the sound blocking magic. The sound blocking magic only erased the sounds coming from objects within a certain range. And, I was able increase or decrease the range at will, so she’d be able to hear me if I wanted her to.\n“Yes, so you can leave.”\nShael wanted to kick me out right away. And she was doing that while she still remained lying down.\nJust as Shael said, I prepared to leave the room right away. It would be a bit of a headache if someone found out that I had slept in Shael’s room.\nTwo young adults sleeping in the same room? It was obvious what kind of misunderstanding it would cause.\n“Yes, I will. But unlike in the Mage Tower, you woke up pretty early today.”\n“…”\nDespite my teasing, Shael remained calm. Normally, she would have made up some excuse saying that she only woke up late because it was at the Magic Tower.\n‘Something is strange.’\nI approached Shael. Then I put my hand on Shael’s forehead. It was hot like a fireball!\nAnd now, for that reason, I felt like I had to stay here.\nAnyway, it seemed to be a valid reason for me to stay. Without me, the villainess would have to endure the pain all by herself.\nShe was a villainess who only cared about of her own interests. But strangely, she turned into a fool only when she became sick.\nUnless we use holy magic, even healing magic wouldn’t be able to cure a fever like this in a short time.\nIf I inform Duke Jespen of this, he’d find someone with holy magic right away… but Shael wouldn’t like that.\nIf the Duke became worried, he might bring a lot of people with him.\nIs that the reason why Shael chose to suffer alone?\nThen, I should stay by her side to take care of her.\nI found a towel in Shael’s room and using my magic, I put the cool wet towel on Shael’s forehead.\nThen I even started using magic to make her feel more comfortable.\nTherefore, the pain caused by the fever seemed to have disappeared. But, she might still feel a bit weak..\nHowever, Shael said to me with a frown on her face.\n“I’ve never asked for anything like this, so please leave.”\n‘Is she in a bad mood because I am the one taking care of her?’\nBut she continued before I could give a reply.\n“I don’t need it, so remove the magic.”\nShael was refusing my help.\nI wanted to take out the Serpent Orb containing the villainess’s dark history, but doing that to a sick person felt a bit inappropriate. So I used another excuse instead.\n“Don’t worry, I’m not doing this because of you. This a part of my magic practice. Coincidentally, you are a perfect practice partner.”\nI was the one saying it, but I also knew that it was all nonsense without any meaning at all. It made me feel a bit embarrassed.\n“Practice with something else!”\n“I won’t.”\nShael let out a sigh in response.\nAnd, I decided to speak first before she could pester me again. In such situations, all I had to do was, attack.\nSo I pointed to the doll placed next to Shael and asked.\n“Rather, what’s with this doll?”\n“…”\nIt was a doll with one eye sewn up. It was the doll I gave her in the past.\n“None of your business.”\n“I am just glad that you liked something I gave you and kept it close to you like this.”\nAt my words, the villainess had no choice but to shut her mouth and fall silent.\nSo, I was able to successfully stop the villainess from trying to contradict me.\nIt was at that time, I felt a faint vibration in my pocket.\nThe source of the vibration was the bracelet that the female lead, Clie, gave me in the past. I had kept the bracelet in my pocket just in case.\nI did it to limit its surveillance capabilities. It made me feel strange when I thought that someone could be watching Shael and me through the bracelet.\nNow, Clie could only hear my and Shael’s voice through the bracelet.\nI didn’t worry too much about that, as it was written in the novel that she would only be able to tell that someone was talking, but wouldn’t be able to hear the details.\nThe bracelet continued to vibrate for some time. Then someone’s voice was heard. That voice belonged to Clie.\n[Eran, can we meet today?]\nShe was speaking in a fairly intimate tone, with zero formalities.\nIt was very different from when she gave the bracelet.\nThe way she was speaking felt very strange.\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "[Eran, can we meet today?]\nI went silent for a moment at the words I heard from the bracelet.\nAt the same time, I thought back to the excuse I had given to Shael in the arena. I said that it was a bracelet that I happened to get some time ago.\nBy the way, she must’ve heard Clie’s voice coming from the bracelet, right? There was even a sense of familiarity in her tone.\nIf that was the case, it was obvious what Shael would misunderstand.\n“…?”\nShael looked at me in bewilderment and tilted her head as if she didn’t know why. She looked calmer than I had originally thought.\nIt was strange. No matter how much she hated me, she shouldn’t be calm in a situation like this.\nIt was then that I remembered something!\nAs soon as I woke up, I remembered using sound blocking magic to practice my magic. And the sound blocking magic blocked even the voices emitted by the communication magic from nearby objects.\nExcept for the voices of people who were really close.\nThat’s why Shael couldn’t hear Clie’s voice. It was fortunate indeed!\n[What is it? Are you busy?]\nClie’s voice was heard again. This time, it sounded even more intimate.\nHer purpose was quite easy to guess.\nIt was clear that she was trying to separate Shael from me. It was as I had expected, it was true that Clie had regressed.\nIt was also only natural that Clie hated the villainess, Shael.\n[Eran.]\nHer voice could be heard over and over again. In my mind, I could imagine Clie laughing as she transmited her voice to her bracelet, intending to tease Shael.\nI tried to ignore it and kept my composure. Fortunately, the bracelet soon quieted down.\n“I’ll go bring some medicine.”\nBefore Shael could answer, I hurriedly left her room.\nAfter I distanced herself from Shael’s room, I pulled out the bracelet and said, “What are you trying to do?”\n[What is it?]\nClie was acting as if she didn’t understand what the problem was.\nI let out a deep sigh and strengthened my magic.\n“I will contact you later, please be quiet.”\nI strengthened the sound blocking magic so that even I wouldn’t be able to hear the voice from the bracelet.\nFirst of all, I calmed down my excitement and headed for the Azbel family’s storage room.\nI had to leave the room in a hurry, so I said I would bring some medicine as an excuse.\nThere were many medicines in the storage of the Azbel family. Even various types of brews, which looked precious at first glance.\nSuddenly, I remembered something from the past.\nWhen I was injured by the Mage Tower Lord. Shael made me eat a lot of bitter medicine.\nIt seems the time had come for me to take revenge.\nI felt reluctant to take it without permission, but it wouldn’t matter if Duke Jespen found out anyway. He might even praise me for taking care of his daughter.\nI took out medicines and brews that had no side effects and headed to Shael’s room.\nShael wasn’t lying down like she was just before. She was now sitting on the bed.\nI handed the medicines and brew to Shael and said, “Please take these.”\nWith that, my revenge began. I was feeding her something that would be good for her health anyway… so I don’t even feel that guilty.\nOf course, there was no way Shael would easily eat these bitter things.\n“I don’t like it. I am not sick!”\nShael refused.\nI thought about threatening her with Serpent Orbs, but for now I decided to use another weapon.\n“If you finish this, I will give you the cupcakes I made tomorrow.”\n“…”\nAfter thinking for a while, Shael started taking her medicine. Perhaps the taste was more bitter than she thought, and Shael frowned at me.\n“So, why did you wear thin clothes in such cold weather?”\nI was talking about yesterday’s incident. She was wearing thin clothes in that cold weather, it’s no wonder that she caught a cold.\n‘But didn’t I put a coat on her? It doesn’t make sense to say she caught a cold because of thin clothes.’\nThinking of that reminded me of another incident.\nIt was the memory of when Shael splashed water on me. More importantly, what happened after she did that.\nAs revenge, I also splashed water on Shael using magic.\nEven though I dried my clothes soon after… Shael was drenched with water in that cold weather, so it would be normal for her to catch a cold.\nI quickly urged her to take more medicine before Shael remembered that as well.\nThis time, I handed the brew to Shael.\n“Take this too.”\nShael was reluctant for a moment, but then she gave up and started drinking the brew.\nThe villainess had a weakness that I could use for the rest of my life. The power of dessert seemed to be greater than I had expected.\n“Ah, is that enough?”\nShael asked as she handed me the glass of brew she had emptied with difficulty.\n“Don’t leave a drop, drink it all.”\n“This is fine!”\nShael began to complain. Of course, there was no way I would let her go that easily.\nI would make her drink that brew no matter how much she complained.\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "“Then I won’t give you the dessert.”\nAt my threat, Shael glanced at me once, and she had no choice but to completely empty the glass.\nJust when Shael was about to complain again.\nKikiiik!\nThe door was pushed open.\nThere weren’t many people in Azbel’s family who could enter Shael’s room without knocking, as she wouldn’t allow just anyone to enter her room as they pleased.\nNo, there was only one person. In fact, Duke Jespen was the only exception.\nOf course, the Duke would choose a set time to check on his unruly daughter, and even Shael couldn’t do anything about it.\nTherefore, Duke Jespen could enter Shael’s room without knocking only at those set times.\nAnd, this was one of those times.\nI knew that we were in trouble when I saw, Duke Jespen mumble with a shocked face.\n“No way…”\nIt was easy to guess what he was thinking.\n[Did he sleep in Shael’s room? Could it be that they slept together?]\nIt was a situation where anyone would ask such a question. It was still early in the morning, and I was still in Shael’s room. Moreover, in order to give Shael her medicine, I was even sitting on Shael’s bed!\n“It seems I’ve interrupted you.” Duke Jespen seemed to have confirmed something and said.\nHearing that, Shael panicked and tried to open her mouth in a hurry.\nKikiiik!\nBut, Duke Jespen had already gone out without even giving her time to make excuses.\n“…”\n“It’s your fault!”\nShael blamed me.\nNormally, I would object, but this time I remained silent.\nHe was a kind man, but Duke Jespen had the habit of sharing the news about us everywhere… so rumors would surely spread.\nTherefore, I had to stay silent for Shael, who was going through a hard time. She would have to continue to stay at the Azbel family, and would continue to have a hard time.\nWhereas, I would only need to suffer when I come to see Shael.\nSo, I continued to nurse Shael, all the while ignoring her disdainful glance.\nAfter some time, Shael’s condition improved. It was due to the effective medicine I had given her.\nTo add to that, Shael was also a mage. So it was natural that she would get better quickly from a common cold like this.\nIt was still morning, and people were starting to wake up.\nSo I had to get out of here before that happened.\nIf I didn’t, rumors might spread before Duke Jespen even opened his mouth.\nAfter confirming that Shael was asleep, I left the room.\nIt was time for my day to begin again.\n***\n[Shael’s POV]\n(G: Some readers seems to be confused about the POV changes, so I’ll be doing this from now on. I’ll also edit the previous chapters.)\nEran seemed suddenly taken aback.\nShael looked at Eran’s pocket, which he was currently staring at.\nEran’s pocket was slightly bulging. Evidently, there was something in his pocket.\nShael could guess what it could be. It was probably that bracelet, which was given to him by that woman named Clie.\nShael quickly began to assess the situation.\nBeing a member of the Azbel family, Shael decided to concentrate her magic on Eran’s pocket, and she noticed that there was a flow of mana in the pocket.\nEran was using magic as well!\nShael quickly used Control Magic. It was a magic that prevented her from being affected by the magic used by her opponent.\nThen she heard a voice.\n[What is it? Are you busy?]\nIt was Clie’s voice.\n‘Was that bracelet… not a gift, but a means of communication?’\n[Eran.]\nNow, her tone seemed quite intimate.\nShael became furious!\nOf course, it wasn’t because of jealousy.\nShe wasn’t feeling well, but she had to listen to that voice. And that voice was calling her fiancée’s name in such an intimate manner?\nA person she disliked and her fiancé were secretly contacting each other?\nEven Shael, who didn’t like Eran, felt her mood turn bad.\nBecause it wasn’t a situation anyone would like.\nShael was in a bad mood to begin with, and now it got even worse.\nShe organized her thoughts and before she could give Eran a piece of her mind, he hurriedly left her room to bring her medicine.\nSo Shael cooled her head and began to ponder.\n‘How can I do this properly?’\nShe didn’t want to end it with just expressing her anger. So she had no answer other than to defeat him!\n‘But if the two are completely in love, why is Eran still coming to the Azbel family?’\nFirst of all, it was necessary to find out the nature of the relationship between Eran and Clie.\nTherefore, Shael decided to put up with the situation for the moment.\nWhen Eran returned, Shael continued to behave as usual.\nAnd when her body finally felt a bit better, Shael closed her eyes and waited for Eran to leave.\nEran finally left her room. It was also a chance!\nShael opened her closet. She found the clothes she had secretly prepared for the auction house.\nIt was clothes that commoners would wear and a cloak to cover her face.\nAnd, she even used the magic that could erase her presence.\nAfter completing her preparations, Shael started following Eran.\nGoblin:\nI am feeling a bit fatigued lately, so please excuse the delays.\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Leaving Shael’s room I walked out of the Azbel family’s mansion.\nI could use teleportation magic in the Azbel family, but it wasn’t good for exercise.\nThe territory of Azbel, a famous mage family, was very suitable for magic even when it came to its environment. The quality of mana in the air was different from other places. So it was a good environment for exercising.\nMore than anything else, I didn’t like exercising in the Baslett Estate because it was so dull.\nAt the moment, it was just the right time for a good run. Since it was early in the morning, not many people could be seen.\nI left the mansion so far behind that it was out of my sight. Then I took out the clothes from the magic pouch.\nIt was clothes commoners would wear.\nThe aristocrats in this world usually valued face very much, so they couldn’t they just go for a leisurely walk whenever they wished.\nIf I went for a jog in my usual clothes, everyone would just stop and stare.\nSo, whenever I went for a run, I would change into clothes that were inconspicuous.\nEven if it was a bit annoying, it’d be relatively quick if I used magic to change clothes.\nI changed my clothes and started running at a light pace. The goal was to reach the Baslett family’s mansion.\nThat distance wasn’t close. However, it was possible because my stamina was quite good.\nIt happened when I was trying to slowly speed up.\nI had no choice but to stop. Because I felt like I was being followed.\nI didn’t immediately turn my head, but was able to check behind me through Vision Magic.\nSomeone wearing a cloak was following me from far away, while using the magic that could erase their presence.\nHowever, the fact that I had noticed them meant that the strength of the magic was quite weak..\nI used magic that enhanced my senses. Then, I hear a peculiar voice.\n[Hah…heh…hh!]\nIn case I would hear it, the person was quietly gasping for breath.\n‘Is the person having a hard time chasing me?’\nI certainly did run for quite some time.\nDue to that fatigue, it seems that the person couldn’t afford to focus on the presence erasing magic.\nSo I could immediately guess who the opponent probably was.\nIt must be Shael. And soon, my guess was proven to be true.\nAs if chasing me was extremely difficult, she slowly lifted the cloak covering her face.\nShael was following me with a frown on her face.\nA chill ran down my spine!\n‘Did she hear Clie’s voice coming from the bracelet?’\nIf Shael had used control magic, it would have been possible.\nI tried to deny that possibility and thought of the bracelet in my pocket.\n‘I think I should give up trying to meet Clie today.’\nJust then, the bracelet vibrated. In case Shael could hear it, I strengthened the sound blocking magic and used on it.\nThis time, even Shael’s control magic would be useless.\nSince I added all sorts of magic, Shael won’t be able to hear my words anymore.\n[Young master Eran?]\nClie’s voice was heard. Unlike before, she was using an honorific title with my name.\nShe must be doing it knowing that Shael wasn’t around me anymore.\n“Not today. Let’s talk again tomorrow.”\nAt my words, the bracelet that had been quiet for a while glowed again.\n[Then, could you bring me three months worth of this medicine?]\nClie told me the name of her illness and asked me to bring her some medicine.\nShe was suffering from an incurable disease, and she needed medicine to keep her condition from deteriorating even further.\nOf course, according to what happened in the novel, the incurable disease would be cured in the future.\nBut I had a question.\nEven if buying the medicine was impossible for Clie, who was a commoner, if she asked the male protagonists, she’d be able to get the medicine for the rest of her life.\n‘I don’t know why she is asking me. Is it an excuse for us to meet?’\nStrangely, Clie was avoiding the male protagonists, and that might be the reason why.\nAfter saying yes, I put the bracelet on. I thought I should buy some medicine before meeting Shael again today.\nNow it was time to focus on Shael.\nShe was still following me.\nI wonder if Duke Jespen would be worried about her if he noticed that Shael was gone.\nHe probably knew that I was with Shael, considering that he saw Shael and I together in the morning.\nSo I think it would be nice to make her exercise while I have the chance. I quickened my steps and started running aimlessly.\nUnexpectedly, Shael didn’t give up and still followed me. At last, my efforts were having an impact!\nWhen Shael frowned as if she was about to give up, I slowed my pace down.\nAfter some time, it seemed that Shael was ready to give up. So I turned around and walked over to her.\nShe hurriedly pressed her cape down and tried to walk past me.\nShe might think it was natural… but it wasn’t at all.\n“What are you doing?”\n“…”\nThen Shael took off her cloak.\nI thought she would hold out a bit longer, but to my surprise, she was very quick to surrender.\n“Aren’t you really tired after running like that?”\n“…”\nShael still remained silent. So I sighed and said to Shael.\n“Please follow me.”\nShael had been suffering since dawn, and all she took after that was medicine.\nShe must be quite hungry.\nIt was early in the morning, so there shouldn’t be any restaurants that was open.\nFortunately, there was a simple snack in my magic pouch.\nI sat down on a suitable bench in the park and opened the magic pouch.\nGoblin:\nAgain, I am feeling a bit fatigued these days, so please excuse the delays.\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "First of all, what I handed to Shael was a rather plain looking bread.\nShael, who wanted something sweet, looked disappointed.\nThis, too, was made with a recipe from a dessert shop that the villainess would have liked.\nThe bread in Shael’s hand was gone before I knew it. But Shael still seemed hungry.\n“More, please.”\nI looked at Shael disapprovingly. Now, the only thing left in the magic bag was sweets.\nIt wouldn’t be very good if she stuffed these things in her mouth on an empty stomach in the morning.\nAfter all, it hadn’t been that long since Shael recovered from the fever.\nAs if she knew that I was worried, Shael, who has a bad personality, started glaring at me.\nAt that time, we heard someone someone else’s voice.\n“Heh heh, youngsters these days… this expression of affection is just too much.”\nIt was an old man who was passing by.\nHe was saying something that no one would dare to say to us. But not in this situation.\nThe reason was the way Shael and I were dressed at the moment. Out outfit was something that no aristocrat would usually wear. Who would think that a pair of nobles would walk around dressed like this?\nShael wrinkled her brows. The villainess had no respect for the elderly, so in response, she tried to open her mouth to retort.\nHowever, before she could do that, another voice was heard.\n“Sister, you are shy!”\n“What?”\nThe voice came from the old man’s side. It was a cute childish voice.\nIt belonged to a girl, no more than eight years old. She was looking at Shael while holding the old man’s hand.\nFor the villainess, it didn’t matter if her opponent was young or old, she had to retort!\nFortunately, the villainess was very hungry at the moment, so she didn’t try to curse at the child.\nBecause she knew that I won’t give her any dessert if she did that.\nFirst of all, Shael started to deny it.\n“No, why don’t you go where you were going?”\n“Lie!!”\n“No.”\n“But, your face is red!”\nIn the end, the villainess couldn’t win against a child. And the old man eventually left with the child.\nThe villainess even made an excuse that her face had turned red due to anger.\nAnyway, Shael spoke up after cooling off for a while.\n“I’ll have to get her on her knees. I’ll have the knights of the Azbel family conduct a search through the territory.”\n“Then I will never give you any dessert again. Why are you so hung up over the words of a child?”\nActually, it was also true that the other side said rude words first, but she shouldn’t have reacted to their words so seriously.\n‘No, in the first place, who would make someone kneel for something like that?’\nUnless you were an aristocrat with a dirty personality, it was usually something to laugh at. Unfortunately, the problem was that Shael was one of those aristocrats with a dirty personality.\nShael pondered over my words for a moment and then said,\n“I need to increase the education intensity for the children of Azbel territory.”\n“Ah, yes.”\nThe villainess, who had no interest in the territory, finally became interested. All for getting revenge on a child.\nIt was a truly absurd situation.\n***\nLater that day.\nShael and Eran were in Shael’s room again. Except for what happened this morning, it was a normal day.\nEran’s eyes were closed as he sat in his chair.\nEran often looked quite tired, but it seemed that his fatigue had accumulated quite a lot.\nAs Eran had completely fallen asleep, Shael was still sitting in her room drinking her tea.\nThen, her eyes fell on Eran’s magic pouch.\n‘Didn’t he take out the Serpent Orbs from there?’\nAs most magic pouches do, the capacity wouldn’t be that large, but… even so, Shael reached towards Eran’s magic pouch.\nAnyway, Eran had made her take bitter medicine by threatening to not give her any dessert.\n‘I don’t care even if he finds out.’\nShael thought in her heart..\nTherefore she opened Eran’s magic pouch without his consent.\nWhat Shael saw was a change of clothes and the she desserts wanted.\nShael took out the bread and ate it.\n‘It’s delicious!’\nHer fiancé was sleeping soundly, unaware that his things were being robbed.\nAfter sending a ridiculing glance towards Eran, Shael happily pondered over what to eat this time and began to rummage through the magic pouch.\n“…?”\nShe found a strange thing. It was a container she hadn’t seen before because it was covered by the clothes.\nEran always carried his magic pouch, and she could also tell that the magic pouch contained items that Eran would always need.\nThe clothes and desserts were part of that. Eran must have always carried the desserts because of her.\nSo was this strange container.\nFilled with curiosity, Shael opened the container.\nIt was full of pills. They were pills that seemed to have strong effects even if they looked like normal medicine for good health.\nShael felt doubtful.\n‘What the hell is this medicine, why is he carrying it around in his magic pouch?’\nShael took some pills out of the container. After she closed the magic pouch, she took the pills and left the room. Then she went to the best pharmacist belonging to the Azbel family.\n“This pill, find out what kind of medicine it is. Within tomorrow.”\n“Yes, yes!”\nThe pharmacist didn’t dare to refuse Shael’s order.\nAfter that, Shael returned to the room.\nIt was time for the normal daily life to begin again.\nGoblin:\nAgain, I am feeling a bit fatigued these days, so please excuse the delays.\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "I heard the sound of the door closing. Shael had come in. It looked like Shael had gone somewhere during my short nap.\n“What is it?”\nFrom the time she entered, Shael had been carefully observing me. As if she was preparing for an interrogation.\n“You seem really tired lately, don’t you?”\n‘Of course I am. It’s because I am working hard on my training even while sleeping.’\nI should have taken a nap later, but I couldn’t because I was had to buy Clie’s medicine.\n“For some reason, you asleep a lot.”\nI couldn’t tell her the truth that it was because I am always busy training. And the reason I trained so hard was due to the fact that I was knocked out from just one attack from the the Mage Tower Lord. Shael might ridicule me if she knew that.\nShael still didn’t take her eyes off me.\n“Your body seems weak.”\nThat’s what she told me next.\n‘Are you calling me weak?’\nShe was the last person who could call me weak, because Shael always made got tired very quickly due to her lack of stamina.\nSomething similar happened even this morning, when she secretly following me.\n“I don’t think the person who secretly followed me and panted all the way should say that to me.”\n“I didn’t.”\nShael lied as if she was right and sat down. She, of course, was still staring at me like before. And, then she said, “Come to think of it, it looks like your hair loss problem has gotten a little worse.”\n“Yes?”\n‘Did it really get worse?’\nIt was clear that the villainess was determined to torment me. But, this time, it wasn’t the atmosphere wasn’t the same as usual.\nShael looked quite serious. Unlike the other times when her only goal was to ridicule and bully me.\nOf course, that didn’t mean that I was going to take her insults lying down.\n“I think it’s because I’m someone who has a brain.”\n“Hah.”\nEven after I said that, Shael just let out a sigh and kept her eyes locked on me.\n“If you are hiding something, tell me quickly.”\nNow she was questioning me.\n‘Could it be that the observation was a preparation for this interrogation?’\nThen, why was the villainess interrogating me in the first place?\nShe even followed me in the morning.\nIt was then that an assumption popped into my head.\nShe must have somehow heard Clie’s voice from the bracelet.\n‘Did she really hear it?’\nI tried to deny it in the morning, but now that things had come to this point, I was starting to feel a little nervous.\nCommunicating with Clie, who Shael hated so much? And it even happened in front of her!\nIt was obvious that this was an act that the villainess would hate to death!\n“What am I hiding?”\nBefore Shael could argue, I hurriedly pulled out my magic pouch. It was time for me to bring out the secret weapon— the dessert to silence the villainess.\nI handed several kinds of snacks to Shael so that she wouldn’t be able to speak.\nThere were so many that even I couldn’t remember just how much I had made.\nSo it was enough to catch Shael’s attention.\nShael looked at me and the dessert for a while, then… she picked up one of the cookies as if she hadn’t really been tempted.\nI thought she would take a bite in a hurry, but her action was slow, as if she was deeply troubled about something.\nOf course, after taking a bite of the cookie, Shael began to enjoy the dessert as if she had forgotten what she was doing earlier.\nAs if she had forgotten that I was in front of her.\n***\n[Shael’s POV]\nShael returned after leaving the medicine she found in Eran’s magic pouch with the pharmacist.\nThe she asked Eran who seemed to have just woken up.\n“You seem really tired lately, don’t you?”\nShe was very curious about what the medicine was, so she decided to asked.\nThe pharmacist of the Azbel family was quite competent and she would come to know the results before long, but Shael couldn’t wait.\nShe decided to be straight-forward, and ask him directly.\nHowever, she got no answer, it was clear that Eran was behaving quite cautiously, and was hiding something from her.\nSo Shael decided to continue.\n“Your body seems weak.”\n“I don’t think the person who secretly followed me and panted all the way should say that to me.”\nEran decided to insult her in return, but… that wasn’t enough for Shael to stop.\n“If you are hiding something, tell me quickly.”\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "It was then that Shael became sure about something.\nEran was perplexed! It was such a rare sight that even she had seen it only a few times.\nIt was clear that he had something to hide.\nHe even brought out the dessert she cherished so much to keep her from prying any further.\nShael picked up one of the cookies. Eran was trying to shut her up using these delicious desserts.\n‘Does he consider me a fool?’\nShe was about to continue questioning Eran while eating the cookie. But, she couldn’t, it was just so sweet and delicious that she couldn’t take her mind off of it.\nIn the end, Shael was defeated by the dessert. So she couldn’t interrogate Eran anymore.\nActually, it wasn’t possible to beguile people’s spirits with dessert, but…\nBut this was something different. It felt like it was inevitable that Shael would fall for the taste of these desserts.\n“…”\nFor some reason, her pride was hurt, and Shael just spent the rest of their time in silence.\nWhen Eran left at the usual time, Shael went straight to the pharmacist with whom she had left the pills for examination.\nShe had said she would be back for the results the next day, but… Shael couldn’t wait for that long.\nShe quickly found the pharmacist, and asked, “ What did you find out about medicine?”\nIt was a single precise question.\nAnd, the pharmacist gave an instant reply. She was a pharmacist who knew the character of the villainess, so she had analyzed the ingredients as soon as possible.\n“It is a medicine for blood clotting disease caused by mana. The medicine can’t cure it, but it slows things down a bit.”\nA blood clotting disease. It was a disease that Shael had never heard of, so she continued to stare at the pharmacist, prompting her to give a detailed explanation.\nThe pharmacist, who was thoroughly prepared, spoke again.\n“We only know that blood clotting disease is caused by mana, but the exact cause is unknown. Aside from the medicine, the patient can also feel better by exercising in the air filled with pure mana.”\nShael hough of the time when she had climbed the mountains in the Azbel teritory with Eran. The air at that place was was filled with pure mana.\nAfter Shael’s thoughts were over, the pharmacist continued.\n“Avoiding sweets and getting plenty of sleep can keep the patient in good shape at least for a little while. In fact, there are many other ways besides these. Taking this medicine is just one of them.”\n‘Eran doesn’t seem to like sweet things very much.’\nWhen Shael had given Eran a cookie she had cooked herself, Eran had eaten that delicious, sweet cookie with a frown on his face. Shael wouldn’t have noticed it if he had eaten it with a calm expression on his face.\n“What are the symptoms of the disease?”\nThe pharmacist became curious at Shael’s successive questions.\n‘Could it be that she has this disease?’\nBut the pharmacist immediately denied the possibility. Duke Jespen checked Shael’s health condition on a regular basis. So there’s no way that Shael would have that disease.\nIf Shael was really afflicted with the disease, the Duke would surely search all over the place to find a cure for her.\nThe pharmacist said with a sigh of relief.\n“First of all, the patient’s body will get weak… and they’ll sleep a lot. When things get worse, they’ll have a really bad fever.”\nFor a member of the Baslett family, which was lineage of master of swordmen, Eran was knocked out by a single spell.\nEran even fell asleep in front of Shael earlier. Shael had also notice that he seemed quite fatigued lately.\n‘I don’t think he ever had a fever, but was it still early?’\nFor the moment, Shael stopped her thoughts and focused on the pharmacist’s words.\n“After suffering a fever, they’d get strangely healthy.”\n“Getting healthy?”\n“Yes.”\nAt that, Shael tilted her head.\n‘Then doesn’t that mean that it was a disease that wouldn’t be a problem.’\nBut the pharmacist’s words didn’t end there.\n“And die within a week.”\n“Still, if they practiced the methods you mentioned earlier, would it be okay?”\n“They are just stopgap measures. It slows down the deterioration, but it doesn’t stop it.”\nShael asked back, “Then, how should we cure it?”\nAs the pharmacist of the Azbel family, she knew about all kinds of diseases and cures. So it was possible for her to know about how to cure this rare disease.\nAt Shael’s words, the pharmacist took a deep breath before speaking.\n“…”\n***\nThe main characters in the original novel had strange personalities.\nNo, in fact, many romantic fantasy novels were like that.\nThere might be some male protagonists who were kind and docile, but most of them were not.\nMost of the male protagonists had dirty personalities and were obsessed with the female lead. Male protagonists with such a personality were usually very popular.\nIn the original novel, the role of Crown Prince Jerroch Edgars was exactly that. He was overly obsessed with the female protagonist and longed for love.\n‘Why is he here?’\n“What are you doing with Clie?”\n“…”\nIt was a strange situation.\nClie’s bracelet wasn’t that powerful, as it wasn’t possible to have a prolonged communication through the bracelet.\nYou could communicate with few words at most. So we agreed to meet at a restaurant.\nThe problem was that when I was sitting with Clie, the Crown Prince suddenly appeared.\nIt was clear that Jerroch was tailing Clie.\nClie was also staring at Jerroch in bewilderment.\n‘Should I just give her the medicine and leave?’\nConsidering the awkward situation, I didn’t know.\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "At the moment, the Crown Prince was glaring at me. And Clie sitting next to him.\nI found it hard to even open my mouth in the eerie atmosphere. But still, I forced my mouth to speak.\n“First of all, take this.”\nI handed the medicine container to Clie. It contained the medicines Clie had asked me to bring.\nThe Crown Prince looked at it in surprise.\n“What does it have in it?”\n“…”\nClie remained silent. As if she didn’t want to talk about the disease.\n‘Could it be that the Crown Prince doesn’t know about Clie’s illness?’\nIn the original novel, the plot started with the main female protagonist informing the male protagonists about her illness, but since Clie had undergone numerous changes, that might have changed as well.\nStill, I couldn’t help but be curious.\nIf she didn’t get the medicine on time, it could’ve been of great harm to her health.\nI could’ve taken advantage of the opportunity when the Crown Prince was gone to deliver the medicine, but that would be impossible.\nIt was because the Crown Prince seemed determined to follow Clie around for today.\nBut the words that came out of Clie’s mouth made me panic.\n“It contains medicine.”\n“Is it because of the blood clotting disease? Why didn’t you ask me?”\nSo it seemed that the Crown Prince knew about Clie’s illness.\nThen I couldn’t understand why Clie asked me for medicine. But looking at Clie’s expression, I was able to make a rough guess.\nAlthough she remained expressionless, a hint of anger was revealed on her face.\nIf Clie was a regressor, it was clear that she had experienced something unpleasant in the future.\nAnyway, I got up from my seat.\nIt was because the Crown Prince was staring at me for some time. It’s not good to offend a bad-tempered male protagonist for no reason.\nI just wished good luck to Clie, who was going through a hard time.\n“Oh, be careful!” Clie said in reply.\nThe girl, who had been expressionless for a while because of the Crown Prince, went back to normal in a blink.\nTo be honest, I really wanted to make sure whether Clie really had regressed or not, but… today didn’t seem like the right time.\nIt was important, because in the original novel, the storyline of the main character, Clie, and the villainess, Shael, were often intertwined.\nIt was obvious that Clie had changed a lot from the original, but there was no way that the development seen in the book would be completely reversed. So an opportunity would come again.\n“I will see you soon.”\nAs if she had the same thoughts, Clie said.\nBut was it okay to say that in front of the Crown Prince?\nFor now, I left my seat without questioning it.\nNow, it was time to meet Shael as usual.\n* * *\n“What is it?”\nThe main character and the Crown Prince had troubled me not long ago, and now it was time for Shael to do the same.\nI thought I was going to spend time in Shael’s room as usual… but suddenly, Shael sat me down at her desk.\nThen she pointed at the paper on the desk.\n“Write down the dessert recipes.”\nThe villainess was making outrageous demands from me. There was no way I could grant that request!\nIt was the villainess’s only weakness! How could I give it away that easily?\nIf I gave the recipe to the villainess… I would no longer be able to control her with the desserts.\n“I won’t.”\nI strongly rejected.\nWhen it came to Shael, I knew that she would keep asking for it as usual.\nBut this time it was different.\n“Okay.”\nAs soon as I refused, Shael tore up the paper. The villainess gave up very easily.\nAbandoning the recipe for the dessert you loved so much… so quickly?\nHowever, Shael softly muttered something so that I wouldn’t be able to hear.\nBut I was able to hear it.\nIt was thanks to a habit I had developed for some time.\nWhenever the villainess did something to me, I habitually used magic to amplify my senses.\n“Then, I can’t help it.”\n‘What?’\nBefore I could express my confusion with question, Shael spoke up.\n“Go to sleep.”\n“Yes?”\n“Now.”\n‘Sleep?’\nCome to think of it, in the original novel, the villainess, Shael used poison to kill Eran Baslett.\nI got anxious without knowing why. In fact, compared to the novel, the current villainess could be considered really kind, but… when it came to the matter of my life and death, the story could be different.\n‘She wouldn’t try to poison me while I’m sleeping, would she?’\nI couldn’t believe it, but when she suddenly ordered me to sleep, all sorts of thoughts come to mind.\nApparently, Shael had heard Clie’s voice coming from my bracelet yesterday.\nI thought she had already gotten over it, but it was clear that she was going to punish me today.\nI immediately opened my magic pouch. I had prepared piles of desserts for today as well.\nTo be exact, I had especially prepared the desserts to cool Shael’s anger.\nI quickly brought the deserts out on the table. It was an urgent situation, so the desserts piled up on the table before I knew it.\nAnd, before long, there was nothing more to take out of the magic pouch anymore.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Please eat.”\nI urged Shael to eat the desserts.\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "After tilting her head for a moment, Shael nodded her head and started eating the desserts.\nFortunately, I felt relieved that the situation turned out well. But on second thought, I think I brought out too many desserts.\nShael was happily enjoying it…\nNow that I camly think about it, she might get sick if she ate them all by herself. In the first place, sweets weren’t something that was good for the body. So I also reached out to take some of the desserts.\n“Stop your hands!”\nThat’s what Shael said before I could even grab one of the desserts, and stare at my hand.\n‘I gave them to you, but I can’t even eat it?’\nNo matter how evil she was, this was going too far!\n“I made these, so isn’t it a bit too much to stop me from having one?”\nAt my words, Shael shook her head in disapproval. She even moved some of the desserts away from in front of me.\nWhat an evil thing to do!\nSo, before Shael could stop me, I quickly picked up one of the cookies.\nBut the cookie never reached my mouth.\nFluph!\nSuddenly, the cookies were burned to ashes. They disappeared without even leaving any crumbs behind!\n“…”\nAnyway, it seemed like she had used magic. Should you use magic in a situation like this?\nBut she did it with amazing skill. Casting a spell in such a distance should be quite difficult.\nIt seems that Shael had grown tremendously in a short period of time.\nThen, I tried to move my hand to find another cookie.\n“…?”\nSuddenly, the desserts were gone. It was an amazing speed. Several times faster than usual.\nActually, the speed at which Shael was eating wasn’t that fast. But was clear that she was eating in a hurry because she didn’t want to give me anything.\n‘Why is she doing this?’\nObviously, it wasn’t like this the last time I gave her desserts.\nWhenever I tried to take a dessert, she would send me a stern look, but I wouldn’t stop just from that much.\nThe villainess was behaving in a way that made it hard for me to understand her intentions.\nThe next thing Shael did was equally confusing.\nShe gave me a magic tool.\nIt was a magic tool that provided air containing a bit more pure mana when held against the face.\nShe was just casually giving it to me, but I couldn’t figure out why.\n‘Could it be for my health?’\nI decided to ask Shael right away.\n“Could it be that you are giving this to me because you were concerned about my health?”\nOf course, that couldn’t be the case.\nAfter thinking about my words for a while, Shael spoke.\n“I gave it to you because I don’t want to breathe the same air, so please be quiet.”\n“Ah, yes.”\nI decided to use the magic tool as she wished, then fired back at the villainess as a bonus.\n“I don’t like that either, so I will use it.”\nNow it was time to savor Shael’s reaction. However, I couldn’t see the angry expression I was hoping to see.\nRather, Shael, she was putting on an expression as if she had won.\nI didn’t have anything more to say to Shael.\nIt was the first time in a while I felt like I had lost to her.\nDuring the moment of silence, Shael raised her head as if she suddenly remembered something.\n“Go to sleep now.”\n‘She’s doing it again.’\nI sighed heavily and directly asked Shael.\n“What do you plan to do while I sleep?”\n“…”\nShael didn’t respond to my words. She just headed towards her own bed.\n“I’ll sleep too, then it’ll be fine, right?”\n“…Yes?”\nWithout even waiting for a reply, Shael laid down on her bed and closed her eyes.\nShael was really sleeping.\nHowever, if I also slept… you never know what would happen. Maybe, I would never be able to wake up forever. It was obvious that something bad would happen.\nAfter looking at Shael for a while, I looked around her room. I noticed a piece of paper beside Shael’s bed.\nMany things were written on the paper.\nIt wasn’t Shael’s handwriting. However, I was able to see that it had a stamp showing the writers identity as the pharmacist of the Azbel family.\nㅡSleep a lot.\nㅡBreathe the air filled with pure mana.\nㅡ Avoid sweets.\nThere were several lines written on it. Even if you look at it, they were all things that were good for the health.\nIt was clear that the pharmacist wrote it down for Shael, who was supposed to have no interest in my health.\nIt also matched the actions Shael wanted me to do, but… it must have been a coincidence. Because the villainess wasn’t the type to care about my health.\nI saw Shael sleeping, then I lowered my gaze to the paper once more and looked at Shael again.\nThen I noticed something, Shael was disobeying her pharmacist’s advice.\nㅡ Always keep your body warm.\nShe was hugging the doll as usual, but she didn’t cover herself with a blanket. Come to think of it, she ate a lot of sweets as well.\nI covered Shael with a blanket. And then, a thought occurred to me.\nThe villainess was really hopeless.\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

But it still made a sound.\nAnd, at the same time, a rustle was heard from the bed.\n“Aren’t you going to sleep?”\nThat was what Shael said as soon as she woke up. She seemed to have been deeply asleep, but…\n‘Could she have been acting?’\nI got chills!\nIf I had really fallen asleep as the villainess had suggested, what kind of disaster would I have had to suffer?\nShael, who was looking at me, stood up and said.\n“Then let’s go outside.”\nShael made another suggestion. It seemed that she had finally realized that I wasn’t willing to sleep here.\nTo be honest, it was also hard to accept Shael’s sudden suggestion to go outside…\nBut it was a better suggestion than before.\nAt least there was less possibility of being killed in my sleep.\n“Yes, let’s go. Where would you like to go?”\n“…”\nShael pondered for a moment.\n‘Could it be that she made such an offer without even thinking about where she wanted to go?’\nThen Shael opened her mouth.\n“Let’s go to the zoo.”\n“A zoo?”\nAt my question, Shael nodded her head.\nThe villainess suggested going to the zoo.\nTo be honest, it was a proposal that I never expected she could make.\nI was flustered but still followed Shael.\nShael was heading to the Azbel family’s teleportation area.\nIt was a place full of mana with teleportation magic circles drawn everywhere.\nWe arrived at the teleportation field before long, and at the same time, Shael frowned at something.\nIt was because Duke Jespen was present, and was staring at Shael.\nIt was clear that Shael would feel embarrassed about this situation.\nI didn’t know whether he knew it or not… but Duke Jespen still continued to stare at Shael.\nI mean, it kind of made sense why he would stare like that.\nThe villainess had come to this particular teleportation field by her own will, a teleportation field that didn’t lead to places Shael would normally go.\nDuke Jespen looked at me for a moment and then nodded as if he understood. Then gave a approving smile before he disappeared.\n“…”\nShael, who was staring at the place where Duke Jespen was just a moment before, started looking for a suitable magic circle for us.\nShe chose a magic circle that would lead to the zoo.\nIt was a magic circle that was quite massive for something that would lead to the zoo.\nCome to think of it, there were rumors that Duke Jespen was a great romantic.\nThe Azbel couple must like going to the zoo a lot.\nThanks to that, I think we could go to the zoo more comfortably.\nShael activated the magic circle. Then, before I knew it, Shael and I were at the zoo.\n“So, what animal do you want to see?”\n“I didn’t ask to come because there was an animal I wanted to see.”\nUnlike what she said, Shael started walking at a certain direction. It was clear that she did want to see something.\nKrrrrrttttrrrr!\nI heard a gradual vibrating sound. When I focused my eyes on the source of the sound, I saw a group of dolphins.\nThey look similar to what I saw in my previous life. The only difference was that, these dolphins were flying through the air.\n“Magic Dolphin?”\nThere was an explanation on the sign.\nThey were species that exhaled high-quality mana while floating in the air?\nThey worked like a kind of natural air purifier. In fact, I could feel that mana quality of the zoo was a lot better that usual when I got here.\nNow I know that these dolphins were the reason why the whole zoo had good quality mana.\nShael was silently admiring the dolphins.\nIt was clear that she was captivated by the mystery of the dolphins flying through the air.\nHowever, the words that came out of Shael’s mouth were enough to make me panic.\n“That’s not good. Rather, catfish would be better.”\nTo say something like that, she was indeed a villainess.\nAfter Shael said that, she started walking again.\nBut this time, it was different. Unlike her walk to see the dolphins, it was a walk without a destination.\nI and Shael started walking around the zoo, curiously looking at the animals.\nThere was no way that Shael, the villainess, had been to the zoo a lot, and it was the same for me who had just possessed a character in a fantasy world.\nSo it was natural for us to be captivated by the charms of these exotic animals.\nIn the meantime, I saw animals that looked like elephants. People were throwing food at them.\nThe sign said, [They eat just about anything.]\n‘They eat just about anything?’\nI immediately pulled out my magic pouch, and quickly started sifting through it.\nTo be honest, I thought there wouldn’t be anything left because I gave everything to Shael earlier, but fortunately there was a box of cookies left.\nIt was thanks to the fact that it was hidden by my clothes.\nI took out a cookie and threw it at the elephant-like animal. Then, the animal reached out and ate it in one bite.\nIt was a really cute animal. To the point where I wanted to make more desserts for it.\nSo it was only natural that Shael would also be interested.\nNo matter how evil she was, she should also enjoy its cuteness.\nShael looked like she wanted to eat the cookies herself. But I couldn’t let Shael eat them all\n“Please take it.”\nI said, while handing a cookie to Shael.\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "I gave her the cookie with the intent of feeding the animals.\nThen, when he looked at the animal again after handing the cookie to Shael. I hear a crunching sound from the side.\n“…”\n“…”\nI quickly looked back at Shael. And yes, the cookie I gave to Shael was gone.\n“Did you just eat it?”\n“…?”\nShe must be so embarrassed that she couldn’t even say anything.\nWell, the villainess… wouldn’t be kind to the animals.\nEven if it was a cute animal. So, she ate the cookie instead. Yeah, she wouldn’t like to show kindness animals indeed.\n‘Absolutely, and wanting to eat cookie herself was probably not the reason…’\nAfter barely organizing my thoughts, I said to Shael.\n“I guess it’s nothing.”\nThen I walked on, trying to ignore the animal that was staring at me eagerly as if it wanted more cookies.\nThen we walked around the zoo again, and I was able to see an animal which seemed quite intriguing.\nIt was a small puppy.\nA pure white puppy with a very cute appearance. However, the small size and cute appearance did not imply a docile personality.\nKaeng!\nThe little guy started barking while glaring at Shael.\nOf course, even if it was a cute puppy, there was no way that the villiness would be kind towards it\nAs expected, Shael also glared at the puppy, and said, “Hehh, tiny worm…”\nAs if understanding Shael’s words, the puppy began to struggle against the cage.\nAs if to prove that this was indeed a world in a fantasy novel, the puppy suddenly transformed into beast even bigger than Shael.\nThe beast’s face became ferocious, and thick veins were visible on its angry face.\nKhuuuong!\nEven though it looked cute, there was a reason why it was locked in a sturdy cage.\n‘Honestly, even I was a little scared.’\nBut Shael was still glaring at the unknown beast.\n‘Seriously, does she have no fear?’\nIt was then, the beast barked again.\nKhruuung!\nThis time too, it was a sound that almost made me faint. I calmed down my nerves and asked Shael.\n“What are you doing?”\n“What is it?”\nAt some point, Shael had hid behind me, and was using me as a shield.\nShe was really fast. To the point where I thought that if there were to be a fight, Shael would run away while using me as bait.\nCould it be that she was so frightened earlier that she couldn’t even run away and stayed still?\nAnyway, this was an opportunity. A good opportunity to tease the villainess.\n“Are you… scared?”\n“No, I’m not!”\nShael answered confidently. But she still stayed behind me. So I provoked her again.\n“Then go ahead.”\n“…”\nShael pondered for a moment, then spoke up.\n“If you can go first, I will too.”\nUsually, I would confidently walk ahead and make Shael come too, but… I couldn’t do that this time.\nIf I really did, I was sure that my soul would just fly away.\nAs it was being kept in the zoo, there were magic circles attached on the beasts body that were not there when it was a small puppy. But that didn’t mean that I could be assured.\nIf I go next to it right now, I felt like it would tear my limbs apart.\nOf course, since it was being kept in the zoo, safety would be guaranteed with all kinds of magic, but it was still a scary thing?\nI just turned around and started walking away without saying a word.\nShael also followed me.\nWe fought against each other quite a lot. But, this time it was a draw.\nWe succumbed to one beast…\nWhile we were walking around while ignoring the prior incident, I heard a familiar voice.\n“Ah, it’s the very shy sister!”\nIt was the voice of the child we had met in the past, when I was giving dessert to Shael, who was starving while tailing me.\nTo be honest, her words had embarrassed Shael quite a bit.\nThis time as well, she had recognised us because Shael and I were wearing the same clothes commoners wear.\nShael changed clothes because she didn’t like people’s attention, and I changed into normal clothes because it would be strange to wear nice clothes alone.\n“You…”\n“Are you alone? What’s your name?”\nBefore Shael could speak, I asked the child.\nIt was strange for such a young child to wander around alone without her family.\n“Yes! My name is Kayla!”\nThe child, named Kayla, replied with a bright smile. Then she added,\n“I have about five more hours to play before I get back!”\nWhy was a five-year-old child wandering around alone in the zoo?\nFortunately, security here was quite good, and seeing that she was also wearing a tracking bracelet, I didn’t feel like she was going to lose her family.\nThere was also no such thing as a car in this world, so there was no need to worry about getting involved in a car accident.\nStill I didn’t want to leave the child alone, so I held out my hand to Kayla.\n“Then, stay with us until then.”\n“Alright!”\nKayla happily answered as she held my hand. She even held Shael’s hand, who hadn’t even reached out.\nShael frowned and tried to let go of her hand. But Kayla looked back and forth between me and Shael, then she said.\n“Dad, Mom!”\nIt was a shocking remark!\nThen, she secretly looked at Shael.\nIt was clear that the mischievous girl was making fun of the embarrassed villainess.\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "“Now, what…”\n“Then let’s go!”\nKayla led Shael and me by the hand. She was quite strong for her age, despite her childish appearance.\nI think she was too strong.\nShael was dragged along, helpless against Kayla’s strength, and I also had no choice but to follow Kayla.\nOf course, there was no way the villainess would quietly follow. Shael was making a face as if she was about to say something…\nSo, I quickly took out the Serpent Orb. Confirming that, Shael hardened her face.\nIf I were to play the recording in the Serpent Orb… even this innocent child would make fun of Shael.\nAnd so, I was able to barely stop the evil woman from pouring out abusive words on the innocent child.\nThat’s how we ended up following Kayla. I also noticed all the warm gazes we were getting from the surroundings.\nKayla had light blue hair. It was the same color as Shael’s. And she was even holding both of out hands.\nSo it was natural for people to see us as a family— a happy family.\nShael could do nothing but only glare at them. Because she was busy just keeping up with Kyla, who was very strong.\nWe walked around the zoo for a while like that.\nThen, we saw the small puppy I had seen with Shael before. It was the puppy that turned into a huge beast when it was angry.\n“…”\n“Wow, cute!”\nNot knowing that Shael and I were frozen in silence, Kayla proudly walked towards the puppy.\nKaeng!\nThe puppy barked the same way when it saw Kayla, and it would soon turn into a beast of enormous size.\nI told Kayla before that could happen.\n“Kayla, how about seeing other animals first?”\nShael, who was next to me, was also unconsciously nodding her head.\nBut Kayla didn’t stop. She even started petting the puppy!\nThere was no way that guy with a bad personality would like it.\nKaeng!\nThe puppy started to struggle. It was a sign that he was about to transform.\nBut this time it was different.\nThe puppy, who had been staring at Kayla for a while, shrunk his bloated body and became quiet.\nThen he lay down and tried to act cute.\nKouuu! Koouuuu!\n“Be nice. Be kind!”\n“…”\n‘Does that beast discriminate against people?’\nHe mercilessly turned into a beast in front of me and Shael, but this time he started acting cute.\nNo matter how much Shael glared at him, it was strange.\nWasn’t it barking at Kayla just a little while ago?\nAnyway, it was fortunate. If the situation from before happened, Kayla might start crying.\n“Huh? It’s cute… why aren’t you coming?” Kayla looked at Shael and asked.\nOf course, even with these words, Shael still remained stiff.\nKayla turned her head and again looked at the little beast in front of her eyes.\n“Wrinkle! I wish I could have you. But I’ll give you a name!”\n‘She’s even give it a name? To this ferocious beast from the zoo?’\nTo be honest, I didn’t like the name either.\nIt was clear that Kayla, similar to the villainess, had a peculiar personality.\n“Come on, pet it!”\n“No, it’s okay, let’s look around the other places.”\nThankfully, Kayla agreed with my words, and Shael exhaled as if she finally felt relieved.\nKayla walked over and held Shael’s hand, then said, “I want to stay in the zoo, let’s go somewhere else!”\n“No.”\nShael shook her head, denying Kayla’s offer.\nKayla looked at me. Same with Shael. They both seemed to ask for my opinion.\nActually, as Shael said, it would be correct to walk around the zoo a bit more.\nI came here at Shael’s suggestion.\nAnd, in the first place, in the world of this novel, the person I considered the most important was Shael.\nHowever, I couldn’t easily refuse Kayla’s offer.\nIt was because I felt a strange sense of familiarity from her.\nMaybe I was taken by Kayla’s cuteness in this short amount of time. So I came up with the best solution.\nIt was an offer that would satisfy both Kayla and Shael.\n“I heard that there is a villa owned by the Azbel family near here. How about we go there?”\nShael frowned at those words. So I quickly added, “I’ll make you some desserts.”\nThere was no way Shael would reject this offer.\nThis time she turned her gaze to Kayla.\nKayla also nodded her head in approval.\nActually, taking a child to a villa without permission from her parents was something I was reluctant to do, but…\nThe weather was getting colder.\nHonestly, I didn’t know why they left such a young child alone in this weather\nApart from safety, children needed love.\nIn addition to that, for some reason, I kept feeling like it was going to be okay.\nThese were the reasons I was able to take Kayla to the villa.\nGoblin:\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "The villa of the Azbel family.\nAs expected of a duke’s villa, it was enormous.\nIt had a magic cast over it so that only those allowed could enter. Through Shael’s presence, Kayla and I were able to enter as well.\nIn fact, I wondered if Kayla would be surprised by the size of her villa, but… surprisingly, Kayla didn’t seem to care too much.\n‘I think she said that she was five years old, didn’t she?’\nIt was fortunate though. I was worried that, after seeing the size of the villa, she would feel awkward around Shael and me due to our status.\n“Follow me.”\nAs soon as we entered the villa, Shael brought me to the kitchen.\n“Do you want me to make dessert the moment we walk in?”\n“Yes.” Shael answered confidently.\nStill, since it was my suggestion, I had to keep my words.\nWhen we arrived at the kitchen, Shael stood still and started watching me.\nShe probably wanted to watch me make the dessert, it was clear she was trying to figure out the recipe.\n‘Is this why the closer we got to the kitchen, the better her mood became?’\nFor now, I let Shael watch me from behind and started making the desserts.\nThe villainess thought that she could memorize the recipe, but it won’t be possible.\nThere were so many ingredients in this world of fantasy novel, and most of them were quite unique. The delicious desserts Shael wanted were prepared from most of those unique ingredients. So, a slight discrepancy, different from the quantity, would create a completely different taste.\nTo begin with, Shael had a bad memory, and that would definitely create a huge difference if she tried to replicate this recipe.\nThanks to that, I was able to confidently start making dessert in front of Shael.\nApparently, Kayla, unlike her young age, also knew how to cook. So she started making something by herself.\nAnd the villainess who was worse than a kid continued to disturb me.\n“Why did you use this so much?”\n“That’s good enough.”\n“The more sugar the better, right?”\nI tried to ignore her.\n“These cookies look good, so make more.”\nShe shamelessly wanted me to make more.\n“Haah. If you spray this much…”\nThe villainess’s random advice made me sigh.\nHowever, there was no further follow-up. It was because I threw the cheesecake I had just made into Shael’s mouth.\nThat cheesecake should have enough flavor to satisfy the villainess.\nThen I said to Shael, who had stopped interrupting me and was busy eating cheesecake.\n“You seem to hate it, so I will give all of these to the servants of the villa.”\nShael, who was enjoying the cheesecake, was taken aback for a moment, then she said.\n“Ah, looking at it now, it looks fine.”\n“It’s too late. I won’t make cheesecake anymore.”\n“…”\nShael went silent for a moment at my words.\n‘Now, how can I tease her more…’\nRight at that moment, support fire arrived. It was from Kayla.\n“Am I doing it right?”\n“Yes. Of course. Would you like a piece now?”\n“Ah! Thank you!”\nYum.\nKayla puts the cheesecake in her mouth in front of Shael. I even handed Kayla the cookies I had made in advance.\nIt was also Shael’s favorite cookie, and that too went into Kayla’s mouth.\n“Oh, delicious!”\n“Yeah, isn’t it delicious?”\n“…”\nShael just stared at me in silence.\nI glanced at Shael and took the dessert I made, then headed to the dining area. I took the desserts and food that Kayla made as well.\nFor food made by a five-year-old, these dishes looked very good.\n‘Why should a five-year-old know how to cook in the first place?’\nShe seems to be a very smart kid.\nI put the desserts I made on the table, as well as the desserts and food made by Kayla.\nThen Shael started eating only what I made.\nAnd, when I was about to eat a dessert… she snatched the dessert right before I could grab one.\nShe was, indeed, a greedy villainess.\nShael was eating only my dessert, and it seemed that it had made Kayla very upset, and she handed Shael her cookie.\n“Try eating what I made!”\n“…”\nShael started to hesitate.\nTo be honest, I didn’t think Shael would want to eat something other than the things I made.\nSo I carefully took out the Serpent Orb and showed it to Shael.\nIt meant that, she had to eat it. I couldn’t let her reject such a cute child’s demands.\n“It’s more delicious than what you ate!”\nIt’s more delicious than the one I made? It was some amazing confidence.\nTo be honest, it’s amazing that a five-year-old was that confident.\nI don’t know why, but I felt a bit competitive. It was similar to when I argued with Shael.\nShael took the cookie and took a bite, then her eyes widened.\n“How is it?”\n“…”\nAt Kayla’s question, Shael choose to remained silent.\nI quickly said, “As expected, wouldn’t the one made by your fiance taste better?”\n“…”\nShael didn’t even respond to my words. She just put more cookies Kayla made into her mouth.\nIt was easy to guess what it meant. It meant that what Kayla made was more delicious than I thought.\nIt took a long time for Shael, who was intent on eating the cookies to finally lift her head and speak again.\nKayla looked at me with a sly smile, and Shael looked at me and said.\n“Your sole use as a fiancé is gone.”\n‘What?’\nGoblin:\nPlease point out any mistakes if you find one.\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "‘My sole use as a fiancé is gone?’\nIt was easy to understand what Shael meant by that.\nIt meant that the desserts made by Kayla tasted better than anything I made.\n“…”\nWithout saying a word, I reached out for the cookies Kayla had made.\nOf course, the greedy villainess didn’t even give up that single cookie.\nShael said to Kayla. “You… work at my Azbel Mansion”\nShael’s words were not an offer, but a command.\nI was worried that Kayla would be scared, but… the situation I was worried about didn’t happen.\nRather, Kayla confidently said, “I don’t want to!”\n“…”\nShael was taken aback by the quick rejection. And I carefully brought out the Serpent Orb so that Shael could see it. I had to warn her that she couldn’t just threaten an innocent and young child to do something for her.\nShael, who glared at me once, opened her mouth again.\n“I’ll give you any amount of money if you agree to work for the Azbel family.”\nKayla turned her head away without listening to Shael’s words. Then she glanced at me, as if she was sending a signal.\nExchanging glances with Kayla, I said in a tone that seemed as friendly as possible.\n“Kayla, how about working for my family?”\n“Alright!”\nKayla immediately nodded her head.\nActually, it wasn’t a serious proposal. It was just a false proposal to make fun of the villainess in front of us.\nKayla seemed to be aware of that as well.\nShael froze for a moment.\nAfter showing a slight grin, Kyla opened her bag and started looking for something in it.\nKayla pulled out a deck of cards. It was a card that felt very familiar to both me and Shael.\nIt was similar to the card game was played in the inn of the Mage Tower.\n“If you beat me in this game, I’ll do whatever you want! Instead, if I win, you have to go wherever I want!”\nShael hastily nodded her head, and Kayla raised the corners of her mouth.\nLike Kayla, a smile also bloomed on the villainess’s face.\nAt the same time, I let out a deep sigh.\nIt was natural, because there’s no way the villainess would play the game in an honest manner.\nEven if her opponent was a child.\nFirst of all, the rules of the game were the following— each player will hold two bomb cards and ten normal cards, and each player will draw and discard the opponent’s cards.\nIn that way, the first person to lose all the bomb cards would be the winner.\nShael started handing out cards. I checked the cards in Shael’s hand through Sight Magic.\nShe had one bomb card, where there should have been two, and she had eleven normal cards.\nIt was clear that there was at least one duplicate card.\n‘Does she even have a bare minimum of conscience left?’\nThe answer was, no.\nIt was clear that the villainess had thought she would easily win by discarding that single bomb card.\nThat’s how the game started. And I carefully observed the situation.\nShael drew Kayla’s card for the second time. But at that moment, Kayla suddenly rose from her seat.\n“I won!”\n“…?”\nTwo out of ten. It was a very tough to pull it off in a row.\nFurthermore, Kayla had quickly taken the two cards that had already been drawn and tossed them into her deck.\nThe stupid villainess became dazed. She had lost even though she cheated.\nI quickly turned on my Vision Magic and confirmed Kayla’s deck.\nThere were twelve normal cards, and the two bomb card, which should have been there, didn’t exist.\nKayla proudly stood tall with an innocent smile.\nShael didn’t even consider that a five-year-old could also cheat in the game.\nIt was fight between a villainess and a bad girl, and the victory went to the cute bad girl.\n“But don’t worry, I’ll cook a lot for you later too!”\nThe girl even knew how to show sympathy.\nKayla then took Shael and me by the hand and led us out of the dining area.\nI followed Kayla, who was sticking out her tongue, and the villainess, who was defeated by Kayla, also had no choice but to follow her.\nI was highly doubtful that Shael would be willing to abide by her end of the bet, but… came to think of it, there was another possibility.\nThe villainess still hadn’t given up on hiring the little pastry chef!\nIt was clear that she would try to convince Kayla to work for her.\nShe is only five-year-old, but… it seems like I have a lot to learn from Kayla.\nFor example, Kayla was still smiling innocently, and the villainess was pretending that she hadn’t noticed her deceit.\nWe followed Kayla and left the villa. Kayla walked as if she had already decided on her destination.\nThere were quite a few teleportation fields in the Azbel family, which was a family famous for their magic.\nAnd, the place Kayla was headed was one of them.\nYou had to pay money if you wanted to use it.\nThere was no way that the money would be burdensome to Shael and me, who belonged to ducal families.\nKayla eagerly looked at Shael once we arrived front of the teleportation circle, where we had to pay the entrance fee.\nShe was asking Shael to pay the entrance fee. She must have realized that Shael was incredibly wealthy through the villa she had been to earlier.\nIt was a rude request, but… it didn’t really matter since Kayla had won the bet with Shael earlier.\nGoblin:\nA few people are complaining that this novel doesn't have a serious tension, but dude… this is a slice-of-life with a fluffy romance, what did you expect would happen?\nPlease point out any mistakes if you find one.\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "The condition of the bet was that we had to go to whatever place she desired. Of course, Kayla had also secretly cheated, but… wasn’t that the same for Shael?\nSo it was a reasonable request. In the first place, Kayla was cute, so it was worth watching the show from the sidelines.\n“Can you pay the entrance fee?”\nShael thought for a moment and said to me.\n“Why me?”\n‘Why was she asking me? Did she completely forgotten that it was she who lost the bet?’\nIt was clear that the villainess was showing her ego to a five-year-old child.\nAnd just when I was about to take out the Serpent Orb, Kayla opened the bag she was wearing, and pulled out a bunch of cookies.\n“I can give you these.”\n“…”\nShael kept her mouth shut for a while and thought about the proposal. No, it was more like she was trying to bargain!\nIt was clear that the villainess was aiming for something of more value.\nKayla laughed and put her hand into the bag. What she pulled out this time were two sheets of paper.\n“These are the recipes for the cookie and muffin you just ate! I’ll give you these. How does that sound?”\n“…!”\nShael was visibly surprised. It was the same for me too.\nTo Shael, Kayla’s dessert were more delicious than mine. So it was obvious what would happen if she gave her those recipes. From then on, I will no longer be able to appease the villainess through dessert!\n“Okay, let’s go.”\nShael replied without ant deliberations. She agreed with an unstoppable speed!\nI had no money with me. I had used up all the money I had in my magic pouch to buy Clie’s medicine.\nI didn’t put more money in it because I found it annoying at the time.\nAnd now, the recipes fell into the hands of the villainess because of that.\nEven if there were only two types of desserts in the recipe, the villainess will never get tired of them and will enjoy them forever.\nWhat should I do now?\nFirst, I decided to go with Kayla. Because there was still plenty of time. So I will come up with a way somehow.\nKayla pointed to one of the magic circles.\n“Over there! Le’t go there!”\nWhat Kayla pointed out was the teleportation magic circle leading to the Fahebrus Beach.\nWe entered the magic circle together, and arrived at the beach.\nUnlike the Azbel estate, the weather here was warm.\nIn fact, that was the special feature of the Fahebrus Beach. It had warm weather all year long.\nI knew that because it was also mentioned in the original novel.\nWe walked along the beach with Kayla.\nAnd, even in the middle of our walk, Shael was holding the recipes tightly like it was her treasure.\nShael didn’t carry her magic pouch because she felt it was annoying. And because of that, I’ll soon have a chance to steal the recipes. I must grab that chance when it here!\nTo be honest, I was feeling quite reluctant to dispose of them, which she seemed to treasure so much.\nBut, I had to do it. If I didn’t, then it would be impossible to appease (control) Shael through desserts.\nAnd, if that happened, it would be difficult to prevent Shael’s personality from further deterioration.\nAt the moment, the only option I had left was to intimidate (blackmail) her through the Serpent Orb.\nHowever, it would be more convenient to appease (control) the villainess through desserts than intimidate (blackmail) her.\nIf I failed, then Shael would gradually go down the path of the villainess, and I was almost certain that I would also have a miserable ending like the original novel!\nNo, Shael and I, both will face a horrible end.\n‘I need to steal the recipes!’\nI walked along the beach, while repeating that in my mind.\nThen, what method could I use?\nIt just so happens to be that this was a beach. And, it was the right place to get rid of recipes on paper sheets.\nSo there I had to find an appropriate method.\nUnaware of my internal agony, Shael and Kayla were happily walking along the beach.\nKayla cheerfully said, “Let’s go into the water!”\n“What?”\nShael shook her head.\nThen Kayla smiled and said, “If you play with me, I will write down all the recipes for the dessert you ate today!”\n‘You shouldn’t do that!’\nBefore I could say anything, Shael nodded her head.\nI had no choice but to use waterproof spell on Kayla.\nShael also learned how to use waterproof magic, so she began to eagerly cast the spell.\n“What are you doing?”\n“What is it?”\nShael was casting waterproof magic on the recipes again and again.\nIf she had left it on land, I was going to secretly blow it away with wind magic.\nThe villainess could be surprisingly thorough in preparation only at times like this.\nLooking closely, it was a 20-fold magic circle! It was simply an overkill.\nThen Kayla suddenly said, “Oh, over there, a catfish! There are catfish!”\n“Catfish?”\nThis was another feature of the Pahebrus Beach. It had good mana quality, so you could see various types of fish in the water. Even if it was a freshwater fish like catfish.\nAnyway, I don’t know why, but it seemed to have a deep connection with mana.\n“Cute!” Kayla said.\n‘Cute?’\nAlthough I also felt that way as well… but that wasn’t the general consensus.\nShael was also nodding her head as if agreeing with Kayla’s words.\nIt was an absurd situation. But I couldn’t stay silent.\nThe villainess’ attention was now fixed on the catfish, and we were in the water.\nIt was a great opportunity. It was a chance to steal Shael’s recipes.\nI must steal the villainess’ treasure!\nNo, I have to get rid of it!\nGoblin:\nPlease point out any mistakes if you find one.\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Shael’s attention went elsewhere for a while.\nAs soon as I confirmed this, I prepared the necessary magic spell. I was thinking of suddenly splashing the sea water at the recipe in her hand, while she wasn’t paying attention.\nOf course, she was protecting the recipe even now, but I’m sure I could succeed.\nBut before I could do anything, Shael looked at me.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Nothing.”\nI quickly canceled the magic I had prepared. She was strangely quick-witted only at times like this, and thanks to that, I missed my chance.\nAfter we were done with catfish viewing, we followed Kayla, who had started walking again.\nTo make sure Kayla wasn’t tired, we walked along the beach just enough to submerge up to our knees.\nIt was obvious that the villainess, who had poor physical strength would struggle to walk in water.\nIt wouldn’t be long before her stamina runs out. However, the villainess’s patience ran out before her physical strength.\nShael looked bored.\nWe were walking along the seashore and nothing that could interest her happened.\nUnfortunately for me, and fortunately for Shael, I was walking next to her.\nTo the villainess, I was a high-performance toy to relieve her stress.\nI felt uneasy for no reason. So I checked Shael’s side through Vision Magic.\nShael was secretly forming a magic circle, while acting as if she wasn’t doing anything.\nThen, Shael used the magic.\nSuddenly, the sea water started to get a little hotter.\n‘Are you kidding me?’\nFortunately, she didn’t use magic that would affect Kayla.\n‘At least she has a minimum of conscience left!’\nNo, if Kayla hadn’t been an excellent cook, she might have suffered from the villainess’s wickedness as well.\nAnyway, the villainess was only making the sea water around me hot.\nThis was the Fahebrus Beach, which had warm weather all year long.\nFortunately, the sea water was quite cool, but… not anymore.\nIt became hot because of the villainess’s magic. It wasn’t hot enough to kill me, but it was hot enough to drive me crazy.\nI started thinking of a way to get revenge on the villainess.\n‘I can make the hot water cool again, or, I can make the sea water around the villainess hot in return, but…’\nAnyways, I was preparing several magic circles to counter Shael. It was a kind of magic circle related to ice.\nBut I noticed that the villainess was also preparing for my attack in advance.\nTherefore, I decided to do things a bit differently.\nShael was walking fast to avoid touching the hot water around me. So I quickly caught up with her.\nThen I grabbed Shael’s hand to make sure she doesn’t run away.\n“What are you doing!”\n“What?”\nShael glared at me as if she wanted me to let go. But I couldn’t let it go.\nBecause, I wanted the villainess to also suffer from the hot water.\n“We’re engaged, so what’s wrong with holding hands?”\n“Haah.”\nShael sighed and created an ice magic circle.\nShe must have wanted to return the heated sea water to normal.\nHowever, after thinking for a while, Shael canceled the magic circle, then she looked at me and grinned.\nIt was an evil smile.\nIts meaning was simple— let’s suffer together!\n“…”\n‘…”\nI walked in the hot sea in silence. It was fortunate that it was not hot enough to cause burns.\nBut it was really too hot, so it was only natural that Shael and I would turn red.\nI didn’t know what the hell we were thinking.\n‘Are we stupid?’\nBut we still kept walking.\nThe one who couldn’t stand it first and normalized the temperature of the water would be the loser… or at least Shael seemed to think that way. I was sure of that.\nIf I used Ice Magic, the villainess would think she had won. So I had to endure!\nIt was then that I heard Kayla’s words.\n“Big Sister, your face is red! Is it because you are holding Big Brother's hand?”\nAt that, Shael quickly withdrew her hand, same for her magic.\n‘She gave up so easily?’\nIt didn’t match with the usual persistent villainess. But it seemed that the water was too hot for her, so she just let go without saying a word.\nWe walked like that for a while.\nShael was gradually getting tired. The reason for that was the magic, which she had just used.\nHer stamina wasn’t that good in the first place.\n“Kayla, would you like to get some rest?”\n“Oh, just a little more!”\nKayla walked like that for a while longer.\nPlop!\nKayla suddenly bent down.\nI was taken aback by her sudden action, but it seemed she had found something.\n‘Ah, she found a pretty conch?’\nShe was indeed a pure child.\nKayla was laughing as if she was satisfied.\n“Alright, let’s go to the teleportation station now.”\n“Already?”\nAt her question, I nodded.\nThe time to part with Kayla had come.\nActually, I’d like for us to stay longer, but it had to be done since would be a nuisance to Kayla’s parents.\nWe headed to the beachside teleportation station and returned to the Azbel territory’s teleportation station.\nKayla turned her head to Shael.\n“See you later!”\nAnd while saying so, Kayla gave Shael a hug.\nThere was no way the villainess with her bad personality would accept that.\nBut, Shael didn’t push Kayla away.\nShe just frowned, but soon she made an expression as if she had a good idea.\nGoblin:\nPlease point out any mistakes if you find one.\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "It was clear that she was planning to entice Kayla to come to the Azbel family’s mansion one day.\nThen Kayla looked at me, then she hugged me and handed me a small box.\n“Is this…?”\n“A gift!”\nIt was not an ordinary gift. I was sensing a tremendous amount of mana from the small box.\nI wasn’t even able sense it before Kayla handed it to me.\nSensing that it was something strange, I immediately opened the box.\nWhat I saw was a golden pearl.\nI immediately turned my head towards Kayla. But Kayla, who was in front of me a moment ago, had disappeared.\nSo I hurriedly asked Shael, “Kayla! Where is she?”\n“I was about to ask you that as well…”\nFortunately, I was able to find traces of using magic. Tracing Kayla’s mana signature, I hurriedly spoke to Shael.\n“Let’s go to the mansion first.”\nShael nodded and we went to the teleportation magic circle leading to the mansion. Shael agreed so readily because she wanted to cook the recipe as soon as possible.\nAfter confirming that Shael had entered the mansion, I immediately turned around and started running.\nI must find Kayla!\nThe pearl Kayla gave me was the reason I was feeling so desperate.\nThis was a world of a romantic fantasy novel with no logic. This was a world where the male protagonists had strange personalities and just a cough from the female protagonist could resolve everything.\nBut most readers didn’t really care. Because it was all about fun.\nSo there were a lot of things with settings that made no sense at all. And one of them was a golden pearl that could be found on the Fahebrus Beach.\nA pearl that allowed its user to travel to the past at any point in time for 3 days.\nIn other words, it was an incredibly cheat item.\nIn the original novel, the only person who would use such cheat item was, of course, only the main character, Clie.\nBut now, it was in my hands. I was so sure of it, because I could feel a massive amount of mana flowing out of it.\nThis pearl was exactly the item that was mentioned in the novel.\nAnd it was Kayla who gave me this pearl.\nSo, naturally, a question popped into my head.\nShe has the same hair color as Shael, and incredible strength for a five-year-old.\nEven that ferocious beast became tame in front of her. She was similar to the villainess, and had a weird taste.\nAnd, most importantly, it was the desserts she cooked. The desserts that the villainess liked more than the ones I made.\nThose were the reasons why I was feeling doubtful. So I ran while thinking about Kayla’s actions.\nAnd then, I was able to find Kayla. She was waiting for me, holding an old journal.\n“Kayla.”\n“Take it!”\nKayla passed the old journal to me. It was a journal written in my unique handwriting.\nMy doubt was gradually replaced with confidence, and I immediately used detection magic.\nIf my guess was right, Kayla’s parents wouldn’t have let her come unprepared, or without any protection.\nHowever, the detection magic found nothing. In response, I poured all my mana into using the detection magic.\nThen, I saw many magic circles stacked on top of Kayla’s body.\nThere were protective magic circles that I couldn’t even grasp the power of.\nSo, there was a reason why the ferocious beast became quiet.\nSuddenly, my doubt became a certainty, and I looked at Kayla.\nKayla looked at me as well.\nI said, while gazing into Kayla’s eyes.\n“Kayla Baslett.”\n“No! Kayla is my alias.”\nAt those words, I looked at the child again. If the name Kayla was an alias… I had to ask for her real name, not an alias.\nBut the child shook her head. Rather, she asked me instead.\n“Can you guess?”\nShe had a familiar smile that was similar to Shael.\n‘She’s asking me to guess her name?’\nHow would I guess her name without any clues? It was impossible.\nBut, maybe what I had to do was not guess.\nIf I’m right… if this child is really going to be born because of me… then her name will also come from me.\nThen what would be a good name? I didn’t want to just casually think up a name without any thoughts.\nBut there was one name that immediately popped into my head. It was like fate.\nIt was something no one could understand. Naming a child was a matter of a moment’s thought.\nHowever, I was convinced that it had to be this name.\nI said at the same time, reflecting on the name that I would’ve come up with someday.\n“Ruelle.”\nThe child just quietly watched me. She was waiting for me to say more.\nSo I said, while engraving each letter in my heart.\n“Ruelle Baslett.”\nRuelle finally smiled.\nAt the same time she smiled, her body began to glow with a golden light. And suddenly, Ruelle disappeared.\nShe had returned to the future. To be precise, to the future me.\nI looked at the vacant seat where Ruel had been sitting a moment ago, which was still glowing with light.\nThat’s one more reason to rehabilitate the villainess.\nIt was now my goal that I had to achieve somehow.\n***\n[Shael’s POV]\nShael was walking around her mansion.\nThen Shael lowered her head. It was to check if the recipe was safe.\n“…?”\nThe recipe, which was obviously fine a few moments ago, had turned into a blank piece of paper. However, Shael didn’t get angry.\nBecause she had memorized the recipe.\nActually, she didn’t remember the exact quantity. But she remembered the ingredients and order.\n‘Wouldn’t the taste be similar even if I added more than the intended amount?’\nSo Shael was able to walk happily.\nGoblin:\nPlease point out any mistakes if you find one.\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "Ruelle gave me an old journal before she left. It was obvious that this journal contained information that would be of great help to me.\nThe first thing I noticed was the preservation magic cast on the journal. A great amount of effort was put into casting the strong preservation spell considering that it was just a journal.\nAnd I could see why as soon as I opened the journal. From the very first page, the information written in detail were very important.\nThis journal was about the matter of going back to the past.\nIf Ruelle traveled to the past, it might change the happy future. No, it was bound to change.\nEven slight changes could make a huge difference.\nBut there was a very simple way to prevent that change.\nIt was related to the pearl that Ruelle gave me. I had to hand that pearl over to Ruelle, who would one day be born.\nIf that happens… what happened to me now will happen to me in the past again.\nIt was clear that the future me had also sent Ruelle with the pearl for that very reason.\nIn other words, in all timelines, I would meet Ruelle from the future. Then, time would flow as it should, and eventually, Ruelle would be born, then I would have to make her travel to the past again.\nWas all this actually true?\nI didn’t know.\nTo be honest, it was complicated enough to make my head hurt.\nBut the journal I received from Ruelle was written in a way that was only possible for me. So I simply decided to believe it.\nFlutter!\nNext, I looked through the other pages of the journal.\nThere were many things written in it. Some of them were recipes for the deserts that Shael would be obsessed with.\nAfter I was done with reading, I closed the journal.\nMy head still continued to hurt. It might be because of the fact that I had to pour out every ounce of my mana to detect the magic spells cast on Ruelle’s body.\nI couldn’t return to the Baslett estate in my current condition. I needed to take a break.\nTherefore, I went in the opposite direction, and my destination was the Azbel family’s mansion.\n***\nThe kitchen in the Azbel family’s mansion.\nThere, someone was concentrating on cooking, which was an incredibly unusual sight.\n“What are you doing?”\n“I’m making muffins. Can’t you see?”\n‘I can see that, but that wasn’t the reason why I asked the question…’\nUsually, this was the time of the day when the Azbel family’s cooks should’ve been engrossed in demonstrating their skills.\nBut, Shael was the only one cooking here instead.\nIt was clear that the villainess had kicked out the other cooks from the kitchen.\nShe was their employer, so it probably didn’t matter what she did.\nAnyway, that wasn’t the point.\nWhat I was worried about, was that Shael was making muffins without a recipe.\n“Where is the recipe Kayla gave you?”\n“It turned into a blank piece of paper.”\nCome to think of it, Ruelle hugged Shael right before they parted ways. It was clear that she must’ve swapped the papers at that time.\nAs expected, it must’ve been Ruelle’s doing.\n“I’ll make the muffins for you later, so why don’t you go to your room first?”\nI suggested it because it was impossible to make perfect muffins without a recipe.\nAt those words, Shael gave a confident smile.\n“I don’t need you anymore. From the ingredients to the order, I memorized everything.”\nShe arrogantly spoke, as if she was proud of herself.\nWhile doing so, Shael pointed to the ingredients piled up in the corner.\nObviously, they were the ingredients for the muffins from the recipe Ruelle had given her.\nBut, there were also some strange ingredients mixed in it. They were ingredients that one should never put into a muffin, such as — Ganellajet powder, Gapriet root, Baniel’s juice, and more.\nShe must have done that by mistake.\n‘Could it be that she memorized only the first few letters?’\nThat must be it!\nAnd, I was sure I knew why.\nBecause the villainess didn’t have a good memory.\nI instinctively frowned at the thought of what it would taste like.\nThe villainess noticed that and said with a grin, “Please sleep while using the air purifying magic tool.”\n“…”\nI didn’t find that it would be worth it to give a reply to that, so I asked, “Then, I don’t have to prepare the desserts from now on?”\n“…”\nShael remained silent for a moment.\nShe only knew about two recipes, and there was no way the villainess would be satisfied with that.\nSo she couldn’t hastily nod her head at my question.\nThen, the villainess shamelessly shook her head.\nBefore I could say anything more, Shael turned her head as if she were going to start cooking.\nThe problem occurred after the villainess started cooking.\n“Bring me that.”\n“Here you are.”\nI couldn’t refuse an order from Shael, who was so engrossed in cooking.\n“Take this away.”\n“Yes.”\n“Leave this too.”\nThe villainess was taking my help for granted. If we go on like this, there would be no end to it.\nSo I prepared to bring out the Serpent Orb.\nHowever, Shael no longer gave me any orders.\nAt the moment, the villainess was concentrating on cooking alone. Normally, she would continue to make me do chores.\n‘What is she even doing?’\nAnyway, it was a good thing for me.\nI leaned against one of the pillars and started to rest while keeping an eye on Shael.\nShael was working hard at making muffins.\nBut, the wrong ingredients aside, their order was also messed up.\nGoblin:\nSpecial Event!

      "content": "I sighed and looked out the window. Some time passed like that.\nSuddenly hearing a metallic sound I turned my head at Shael, and she casually handed me a tray.\nSomething was placed on top of it.\nIt seemed that Shael had finally finished cooking.\n“Would you like to try it?”\nShe was offering me muffins that she was obsessed with without even trying them first. It was very surprising.\nBut, it wasn’t long before I found out why.\n“Are you asking me to eat this?”\nAn object too strange to be called a “muffin” was placed on the tray. It looked like you would get sick after eating.\nActually, it was the expected result.\nShael, who couldn’t even remember the order of cooking, had no way of knowing the amount of the ingredients.\nMoreover, some of the ingredients were wrong in the first place.\nAnd the result was obvious.\nTherefore, the villainess handed me the muffins first.\n“Your fiancé worked hard to make it for you, why are you rejecting it? How would you feel if your fiancé refused to eat something you worked hard for?”\nI barely held myself back from cursing out loud. The villainess treated me as her fiancé only at times like this.\n“Take it.”\n“I don’t like it.”\nWhen we were having a brief confrontation like that, the door to the kitchen, which had been firmly closed, opened.\nKikiiik!\nThe one who entered, was Duke Jespen. He was smiling as if he was excited about something.\nAnd, seeing Shael handing me a muffin didn’t seem to be the reason.\nIn that case…\nIf it wasn’t for Shael, there was only one other person he would smile for. It could only be related to his wife, Enella Azbel.\nDuke Jespen, who confirmed that we were here, quickly put the ingredients he was holding into the magic pouch.\n‘Did he come here to cook for Enella?’\nIt was clear that Shael and I interfered with his plan.\nDuke Jespen’s expression hardened for a moment, then he opened his eyes wide as he looked at the tray containing the muffin Shael had prepared.\n“…!”\nHe was looking at the “things” as if he wanted to eat it.\nLooking at his expression, Shael handed a muffin to Duke Jespen.\nDuke Jespen ate the muffin with an emotional look of on his face.\nI mean, those muffins didn’t look appetizing at all. But…\n“Delicious!”\nThe words coming out of Duke Jespen’s mouth was completely different from what I expected.\n‘Is that thing delicious?’\nTo be honest, I couldn’t believe it. Could he be lying for his daughter?\nShael also looked at Duke Jespen with a questioning gaze.\nThen Duke Jespen spoke, “It is clear that it resembles the excellent cooking skills of my lovely Enella.”\nHis words sounded quite sincere. So, it seemed like Duchess Enella also cooked for him.\n‘He really thinks that those weird looking muffins are delicious?’\nThen Duke Jespen continued with a tone that was filled with a sense of urgency.\n“Enella! I miss Enella. I have to go!”\nThen, Duke Jespen hurriedly left.\nFeeling strange for some reason, I amplified my hearing with a bit of my restored mana.\nHeukk! Kuk! Kuhk!\nIt was the sound of Duke Jespen coughing.\nThe love Duke Jespen had for his daughter was great. He managed to eat that ‘thing’ with a straight face and even called it delicious.\nFortunately, my future daughter, Ruelle, was a good cook!\nI turned my head to look at Shael.\nAfter watching her muffins closely for a moment, Shael stood up from her seat while holding her tray, and started walking toward her room.\nI also followed Shael to her room.\nSuddenly, we were sitting facing each other in Shael’s room.\nShael reached out for the muffins on the table. She then took a bite of the muffin.\n“…”\nShael, who was frowning on her face, placed the muffin back on the tray. At the same time she stared spouting words of excuse.\n“I definitely got the ingredients and the order right.”\n‘Not at all. The ingredients were strange, and the order was messed up.’\n“Is that so?”\n“The recipe must be wrong.”\nThat, too, was not true. But I didn’t bother to correct her.\nWhy?\nBecause it wouldn’t change anything, even if I did.\nIt was clear that even if I gave her a proper reason, the villainess wouldn’t take it seriously.\nEven when faced with a difficult situation, she wouldn’t try to find a solution. She’ll just blame someone else.\nThat’s just how the villainess was.\nSo she’ll just blame something else this time as well.\nI had already expected that.\nBut, not this time.\nShael, who remained silent for a moment, opened her mouth.\n“You will make the desserts from now on.”\nShael was actually looking for a new way. Then she added with a serious expression, “Forever.”\nI looked at Shael with a strange expression.\nThen Shael grumbled, “There is nothing else you can do anyway.”\nShe didn’t forget to add an insult along with it.\nBut I didn’t really care.\nResisting the laughter that was about to leak out, I also spoke to Shael.\n“Yes, I’ll make it for the rest of my life, so don’t worry.”\nTo make dessert for the rest of my life.\nIt was a strange promise that would make anyone laugh.\nGoblin:\nPlease point out any mistakes if you find one.\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "“Then, please make it now.”\n“…”\nI immediately felt the intense urge to cancel the promise I had just made.\nAnyways, Shael continued to stare at me with an eager expression.\n“It’s a little late now. We will do it next time.”\n“I think my father came to the kitchen to cook for my mother.”\nShael was talking about what happened a while ago. Certainly, it was clear that Duke Jespen had come to the kitchen to cook food for Duchess Enella.\n‘But why are you saying that now?’\nConsidering Shael’s attitude towards me, it was completely unreasonable to compare me to Duke Jespen.\nBut I couldn’t refuse Shael’s eager eyes. Instead, I made a suggestion targeting her health.\n“Actually, I have some leftover cookies from before. If you take herbs from the Azbel family’s storage and eat them, I’ll give you the cookies.”\nSo, if she wanted to eat something bad for her body, she would have to eat something good for her body first.\nShael frowned at my suggestion.\nShe was someone who hated bitter things. But Shael still nodded her head. It was because she liked sweets more than she hated bitters.\nAt some point, cookies and herbs were placed in front of Shael.\nShael looked at the herbs for a while, then said, “Do I really need to eat this?”\n“Yes.”\nShael stayed still for a while. I also kept waiting for her to make a move.\nAnd, it happened when I closed my eyes just for a moment to regain some energy.\nThe cookies had disappeared before I knew it!\nOf course, the herbs were still in place.\nIt was obvious who the culprit was.\n“Why are you acting so childish?.”\n“What?”\nI let out a deep sigh.\nThen I stuffed the herb into the villainess’s mouth.\n* * *\nAfter spending time with Shael like that, I headed to Baslett Estate, and finally arrived at my home.\nIt was a day full of extraordinary things.\nI met my future daughter, and made a strange promise with Shael.\nMy body was tired. But I didn’t want to fall asleep like this.\nI sat down at my desk and opened the journal Ruelle had given me.\nIt was a journal written by my future self. I could tell just by looking at the handwriting.\nSo it was obvious that there were things in it that would help me in my endeavors.\nMost of the content were recipes that Shael would like.\nThe rest of the journal only contained some meaningless advice.\nㅡ Unconditionally accept and drink the drink Shael gives you.\n— Make lots of desserts for Shael.\nAnd more…\n— When you become the head of household, give up your work and devote all your time to Shael and Ruelle.\nㅡ When you receive a love letter from someone, do not ignore it, but punish the sender with a curse.\nMany of the advice were all very bizarre.\nAre you telling me to accept the drink Shael gives me? What the heck are you thinking?\nWhy did you make so many desserts for Shael? Even now, I’m worried about that bad girl’s health.\nFor now, I skipped the advice I couldn’t understand. And…\nFinally, I found something that seemed important.\nㅡ Stay away from Clie.\nStay away from Clie. It was written that way in the journal and it gave no reason why.\n‘Would it kill you to write down the reason?’\nAnyway, it was the advice I had to take seriously, considering it was a journal that my future self had written and sent. So I closed the journal and began to think about what the real meaning of the advice I read earlier would be.\nI wanted to see Ruelle again somehow. I wanted to achieve my goal of rehabilitating the villainess.\nIf that happened, I would be able to see Ruelle for sure. In fact, if the present differs even slightly from the future, Ruelle’s existence may also become something uncertain.\nBut that probably won’t happen. Because this was a fantasy world with no sense of logic.\nClie also went back to the past and performed various actions, but her children remained the same.\nIn the first place, the future me must have been convinced for some reason.\nOtherwise, there was no way he would send Ruelle to the past.\nSo I felt relieved, and carefully placed the journal in the magic pouch.\nTing!\nAt that moment, the envelope I had placed at a corner of the desk started to ring. Inside it was the bracelet that Clie had given me before.\nI had thought that the bracelet wouldn’t ring anymore because all the magical energy it had accumulated had disappeared. Since I wouldn’t be contacted anyway, I put it in an envelope and left it unattended so that it wouldn’t be seen by anyone.\nIt had gathered enough mana before I knew it, and it was functioning again.\n[Young Lord Eran. Are you there?]\nInstead of answering, I thought about the advice I had just read in the journal.\nThe advise to stay away from Clie.\nIn that case, I wondered if it would be better to stop keeping in contact.\nGoblin:\nPlease point out any mistakes if you find one.\nIf you want a more severe (spicy) rehabilitation of multiple villainesses, you can check out my other project, Pushover Extra Trains the Villainesses.\nWant to read more?

      "content": "The voice continued to flow out from the bracelet.\n[I know you are there.]\nClie said in a confident tone.\nI chose to remain silent. But, she continued to speaking.\n[Two days ago, a tea party was held by Countess Prarel. There I met the Young Lord’s hidden daughter.]\nClie said something completely unbelievable!\nShe was saying that she met Ruelle two days ago?\nThinking about it again, I found that there was indeed something strange about this incident. The duration of the pearl that Ruelle used was about 3 days.\nThe first time Shael and I met Ruelle was on a park bench. But then we separated right away.\nAfter that day, we met each other again today. But the time Ruelle and we spent together was only about five hours. So, what was Ruelle doing for the rest of the time?\nIt was something I needed to investigate in detail.\n***\n[Duke Jespen’s POV]\nDuke Jespen was talking to a man called Viscount Gileon.\nViscount Gilleon opened his mouth to speak, “Duke Jespen, I heard a rumor that make absolutely no sense.”\n“What happened?”\nDuke Jespen was carrying a box of cookies. In fact, he usually didn’t do anything rude like eating cookies when he was talking to someone. But this time, it was different.\n“Someone is circulating an absurd rumor, saying that, Lady Shael and Young Lord Eran have a hidden daughter!”\nDuke Jespen nodded his head, as if he wanted him to continue.\n“From what I heard, a lost child came to the tea party in Countess Prarel. Then she claimed to be the daughter of Young Lord Eran and Lady Shael.”\nViscount Gileon took a moment to catch his breath before speaking.\n“It is even said that the young child demonstrated the magic of the Azbel family and the swordsmanship of the Baslett family.”\n‘But it was obviously a false rumor!’\nViscount Gileon knew Shael’s personality very well. It was hard for him to believe that she would fall in love with someone.\nIn fact, it was possible to have a child even if there was no love. But… Eran was an aristocrat who he only heard good rumors about, so there was no way Duke Jespen would’ve let Eran be if he tried to harm his daughter.\nSo when Viscount Gileon got to know about it, he immediately came to inform Duke Jespen about the rumor.\nHe was a noble, and he was also someone who respected Duke Jespen a lot.\nHe thought that Duke Jespen would be furious if there were bad rumors about his daughter.\nBut, it didn’t seem like that was the case at all. Rather, the Duke was just nodding his head. It seemed like knew about the rumors from the start.\n“Duke Jespen?”\n“That rumor is fine, so leave it alone.”\nDuke Jespen said while eating the cookies.\n‘Leave the rumor be? However, wouldn’t that make it seem like the rumors were true?’\n“If the rumor is left unattended, the road to her marriage will be blocked!”\n“It’s okay because Eran is there.”\n‘But that is only an engagement.’\nGileon knew that even that engagement was due to the villainess’s prank.\nDuke Jespen added, “Anyway, Shael’s path to marriage has been blocked for a long time.”\n“Because of her personality and stubbornness.” Duke Jespen whispered under his breath.\nViscount Gileon said in surprise, “Then can’t you…”\n“Yes, what you think is pretty much right. I’m going to see Enella, so you may leave.”\n‘Finally, he wants to do something.’\nThat was what Viscount Gileon thought.\nBut he had a question,\n‘What is Ezran Baslett, the head of the Barslett family, not blocking the rumor?’\nActually, Duke Jespen was quite weak in dealing with rumors. He spent most of his time at the side of his wife, Enella. So he didn’t have much interaction with others.\nBut as far as Gileon knew, Duke Ezran was quite adept at dealing with the rumors. So that begs the question.\n‘Why was Duke Ezran remaining silent about a rumor that was potentially blocking Eran’s marriage path?’\nThe reason was unknown.\nAnd, the questions didn’t end there.\n‘To think that the overprotective Duke Jespen would act like this.’\nViscount Gileon simply left the Azbel estate with a head full of doubts.\nDuke Jespen still remained seated, and then he smiled,\n‘Things are progressing quite smoothly.’\nIt was a smile very much suited for a villain. At the same time, he reminisced about what had happened a few days ago.\nA child who looked exactly like Shael when she was at that age, came to visit Duke Jespen. And, that child claimed to be his granddaughter!\n‘Coming from the future, honestly, I considered it to be impossible…’\nBut, for some reason Duke Jespen was sure that the child was his granddaughter.\nAt the same time, his granddaughter asked for several things.\nOne of those requests was to create a teleportation magic circle towards the zoo.\nIn fact, the teleportation magic circle was there from the beginning.\nIt was because Duke Jespen liked to travel with Enella to various places. Once he heard the request, he made the magic circle towards the zoo even stronger.\nTurning a blind eye to this rumor was also something requested by his granddaughter.\nAnd at the same time she made those requests, she also gave a box of cookies to Duke Jespen.\nJust thinking about the cookies, Duke Jaspen reached out for the cookies his granddaughter had given him.\nCrunch!\n‘It’s delicious!’\nIt was worlds apart from the muffins Shael had given him.\nTo be honest, Duke Jespen’s wife and daughter had no talent for cooking.\nBut his granddaughter was different. His granddaughter obviously had a talent for cooking!\n‘Fortunately.’\nDuke Jespen thought as he ate the cookie with relief.\nGoblin:\nSuffering from fever, headache, and runny nose… so pardon any mistakes.\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also motivate me by buying me coffee at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "[Eran’s POV]\n“For what reason?”\n[That child showed us the Azbel family’s magic and the Baslett family’s swordsmanship.]\nClie was saying that, Ruelle claimed to be my daughter at a tea party where all the ladies were present.\nTo be honest, it was indeed very shocking. If she claimed to be my daughter in front of all the guest at the tea party, I don’t know how many people had seen it.\nBut I remained calm at Clie’s words.\nThere must have been a reason why Ruelle did that. So I couldn’t hastily say anything since I didn’t even know why Clie was saying all this to me.\n“Let’s talk later.” So I ended the conversation and put the bracelet, which was still active, back into the envelope.\nThat incident will happen before long. I thought about the incident from the original novel, where Clie and Shael would come face to face.\nAnyways, for now, I lay down on the bed.\n‘Fortunately, Duke Ezran is not at home.’\nPerhaps we won’t be seeing each other for a while.\nAs the head of the Baslett family, Duke Ezran was very busy.\nThanks to that, I had no need to make excuses about the rumor. So, I felt no immediate urgency.\n‘What the hell is the meaning of the advice written in the book?’\nAnd, thinking about why Ruelle would do something like that, I fell asleep.\n***\nThe next day.\n“There are rumors going around that you and I have a daughter.”\n“…?”\nShael tilted her head.\nCertainly, it was an absurd rumor, and I had my doubts about why it was spreading so fast.\nEven though Ruelle actually claimed to be my daughter at the tea party, I didn’t expect rumors to spread this fast.\nShael and I, belonged to mighty ducal families. So I thought the rumor would spread in secret… but that wan’t the case at all.\nThe rumor had spread all over the place. To the extent that even I, the party involved in the rumor, had heard of it. It was thanks to the quick-witted informant of the Baslett family.\nThe rumor was more detailed than I thought.\nShael usually didn’t appear in public that much. And apparently, the reason was because of the child. People found it very suspicious. And several other reasons were added to it as well, which reinforced the rumor even more.\nWhen Shael heard about the rumor, she frowned, and along with a slightly puzzled expression.\nOf course, anyone would feel bad feel if they suddenly heard that there was a rumor that they had given birth to a child in secret.\nBut soon, Shael’s expression improved.\n“Aren’t you in a bad mood?”\n“Why would I be?”\nShael asked back as if she didn’t understand why.\n‘What do you mean why? You were the one who was frowning a moment ago!’\nI had to know what she was cooking in her head.\n“How do you feel about being accused of having a child you don’t even have?”\nAfter thinking for a while, Shael just nodded her head with a sneer on her face.\nIt was the look she showed when she bullied me.\nSo I asked again.\n“Are you really okay?”\n“Yes.”\n“The rumor wrongly accused you of having a child you don’t have. Maybe there are even more strange rumors going around.”\nShael smiled and confidently raised her head.\n“No way, do you care about rumors like that? It’s not like we really have a child.”\n“…”\nOriginally, Shael should have been more upset than I was. But when she said that, I didn’t give a reply, instead, I asked Shael, who was grinning at me.\n“You are acting as if the rumor is a good thing. Isn’t it?”\n“Am I?”\nStill, Shael didn’t bend.\nThen how could I make the villainess bend?\nSimple. I had to make her hear the rumors herself!\nAfter thinking about it, I got up from my seat.\nAt the same time, I took out a dessert, and shook it in front of Shael.\n“I’ll give it to you if you go somewhere with me today.”\nSo it was natural that the villainess would follow me.\n***\nThe place Shael and I headed to was a dessert shop belonging to a famous merchant.\nIt was a place where only wealthy nobles and commoners came to buy desserts. And, most of them would know about the rumors about me and Shael.\nSince it was about the hidden daughter of the two engaged nobles from two ducal families, the rumor was already widely known to the public.\nIndeed, numerous high-ranking noble families had seen the magic of the Azbel family and the swordsmanship of the Baslett family that Ruelle had used. So no matter how absurd the rumors were, people had no choice but to believe them to some extent.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also motivate me by sponsoring chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "I was sure that even now, the rumor was a hot topic among many people.\nIt was also for that reason why I came here. I wanted to let Shael experience the rumor first hand.\nFor obvious reasons, Shael and I wore robes to cover our bodies.\nWe first started by walking around the building. But unfortunately, no one here was talking about the rumor.\nA moment after that, I saw the dessert shop. It looked quite fancy, and it’s appearance was enough to attract the attention of Shael, who loved desserts.\nShael entered the dessert shop and immediately started choosing desserts.\n“Do you really want to eat this much?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then I guess I won’t have to serve you dessert later.”\n“Don’t worry, I will eat that too.”\nAnyway, the villainess was greedy.\nShael sat down with dessert in her basket.\n“Won’t you give me one?”\nThe villainess replied me with a glare…meaning she wasn’t going to give me any.\nActually, I could just buy some dessert for myself, but I couldn’t, because Shael interrupted me for some reason.\nCrunch!\nIt was the sound of Shael eating a cookie. Normally, she would put on a happy expression, this time she frowned.\n“It doesn’t taste good.”\n“Not tasty?”\nThat couldn’t be!\nThey don’t have this lavish building for nothing, and the desserts here were said to be quite delicious.\n“It’s your fault!”\nIt was easy to understand what Shael meant by that. It was clear that Shael had become accustomed to the taste of my dessert before she knew it.\nThat was the reason why the villainess in the novel was so obsessed with the dessert shop where I got the dessert recipes.\n“So it’s my fault? That’s disappointing. Then I guess from now on, I won’t serve you any desserts.”\n“You promised to do it for the rest of your life.”\n“Did I?”\nWhen I was busy with my minor skirmish with Shael, I heard someone talking from behind me.\nㅡ Rayel, did you hear that famous rumor these days?\nㅡ I think I know what rumors you are talking about. And I saw it happen with my own two eyes!\nThis was a famous dessert shop. So it was also natural that it was a good place for wealthy young ladies to chat. For example, the two young ladies behind us.\nShael hardened her face, as if she had guessed which rumor they were talking about.\nㅡ She was a very cute kid, and she had the mana that only flows in the blood of the Azbel family… so cute!\nㅡ Even if she had the Azbel’s mana and magic… is it really true?\nShael quietly said, “She must have seen it wrong.”\nI nodded at Shael’s words.\nThen the gossip of the young ladies continued.\nㅡ I rather want to believe it’s true. It’s so romantic! To think that Lady Shael, who had such a bad personality, was finally conquered by Young Lord Eran.\nㅡ If it’s real why aren’t they getting married already?\nShael nodded her head. It seemed she wanted the young ladies to realize that the rumors couldn’t be true.\nㅡ Maybe Lady Shael forced herself on Young Lord Eran!\nㅡ Puh, that makes some sense.\nI also hardened my face like Shael. ‘Why the hell do you think that makes sense?’\nㅡ But Young Lord Eran sure is pitiful.\n— Well, that’s not true.\nShael stood up from her seat. It was clear that she wanted t to tell them something.\nBut I quietly said, “Do you care about rumors like that?”\n“…”\nThat was the thing Shael told me earlier. At those words, Shael sat down again.\nThe young ladies’ conversation continued.\n— Ah, I also saw them at the banquet of the Mage Tower.\nㅡ How was it?\nSomething about the banquet at the Mage Tower? I became curious\nㅡ Young Lord Elan was staring at Lady Shael… and he couldn’t take his eyes off her.\nI did that to prevent Clie from spilling her wine on Shael.\nThere was no opportunity to make excuses.\nThe young lady spoke again with a voice mixed with excitement.\nㅡ He looked at Shael very lovingly! I thought honey was dripping from his eyes.\nㅡ Kyaa~\nThat was not the case at all. But the problem was that the bullsh*t showed no signs of ending.\nSo, I got up from my seat to correct that nonsense. But before I could do that, Shael opened her mouth.\n“No way, do you care about rumors like that?”\n“…”\nI gave the villainess an opportunity to counter attack, which made my face red with shame.\nThe villainess’ attack was more lethal than expected.\nOf course, Shael’s face blushed with shame as well.\nAnd so, Shael and I just glared at each other with blushing faces in silence.\nGoblin:\nI'll be active on Discord from now on.\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also motivate me by sponsoring chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "The voices coming from behind us stopped. Then Shael immediately got up from her seat, left the dessert store, and started walking.\nI started following Shael.\n“Where are you going?”\n“I don’t know.”\nShael’s face was still red with shame, and it was clear that she was trying to to hide it.\nOf course, there was no way I would easily let the opportunity go!\nShael quickened her steps.\nI also sped up and chased after her.\nIn the end, Shael entered a magic tool store.\nIn fact, as a famous mage family, the Azbel family also produced numerous magic tools, but they were not for amusement like the ones in this magic tool store.\nShael didn’t have much interest in these magic tools either, as she started to walk around while looking at the magic tools with curiosity.\nThen, she reached out her hand towards a certain magic tool.\n“I need to buy one of these.”\nIt was a sleep magic tool.\nIn fact, it was a magic tool with similar effects to sleeping pills. But… why the hell was she buying that?\nEven it’s price was quite expensive.\n“Why on earth would you want to buy that?”\n“You don’t have to know.”\nCome to think of it, Shael recently tried to put me to sleep. And, it wasn’t once or twice…\nI just couldn’t figure out why.\nMeanwhile, Shael started walking in search of another magic tool.\nThis time, she stopped in front of a magic tool that grabbed even my attention.\n‘A gag?’\nAnd, it was one that was designed to put on a person!\n‘Why the hell is something like that here?’\nI guess there were people in this world with some unique tastes in things. Anyways, I didn’t need to bother myself with these things.\nBut I had no choice but to bother myself with that thing.\nWhy? Because Shael reached her hand towards the gag.\n“Why?”\nShael didn’t answer my words. Rather, she put the gag in her basket, and then reached out for the magic tools beside it.\nThey were other magic tools on display next to the gag. Of course, I didn’t have to be a genius to guess that they wouldn’t be ordinary either.\nAnd that guess was perfectly correct.\nAs I stared at Shael with shock, she put a rope that could be used for suspicious purposes and a pair of handcuffs that prevented one from using their mana in her basket.\nNow the basket contained the following “unique” items— a sleep magic tool, a rope, and a pair of handcuffs.\n‘Why are they selling things that look like they could be used in suspicious purposes at this store?’\n“…”\nAs I maintained my silence, Shael headed to the counter.\nWhen the cashier saw the items in the basket, he kindly reminded,\n“Ah, these items are not supposed to be used for strange purposes. May I ask why you want to buy them?”\nShael pointed at me and opened her mouth without thinking, “I want to use them on this person.”\n“Ah! You were a pair of fresh lovers!”\n‘She’s going to use it on me?’\nDid I hear it wrong? No, that’s probably not the case.\nAnd, the transaction was over before I could say anything.\nWhat the hell! They sold these things after just asking about the purpose?\nThe world of this romance fantasy novel was indeed very illogical.\n“What the hell are those things?”\nStill, Shael didn’t answer, and kept walking.\nNext, Shael went into an accessory shop, and I had no choice but to follow Shael inside.\n“What are you buying?”\n“Anything.”\nI walked through the store with Shael.\nThe store had many expensive things ranging from necklaces to precious rings. It all looked gorgeous and noble.\nIt was then that a pair of rings caught my eye. They were rings with blue jewels that were shining with a blue light.\nIt was a pair of very beautiful rings. Even Shael, who wasn’t usually interested in jewelry, became interested once she saw them.\n“It looks like a pair of couple rings.”\n“That’s right.”\nIt was unusual for Shael to show interest in something other than dessert. So, it was only natural that I would want to buy it. But…\n[5 million gold.]\nBut, why is it so expensive?\nI swallowed my saliva. I didn’t expect it to be this expensive, even if it was studded with jewels.\nIn fact, it was more expensive than all my possessions!\nYes, I was from a ducal family, but that didn’t mean that I was rich. I received only a few gold coins every month as allowance, and of course, that was not nearly enough for this.\nActually, the Baslett family could be considered as quite poor even though it was a ducal family.\nAs I was lost for words, Shael picked up the pair of rings. Then she took it to the counter.\n‘Is she going to buy both of them for herself?’\nFortunately, that wasn’t the case, as she handed me one of the rings.\n“Take it.”\nEven as I thanked Shael, I wondered,\n‘Why is the villainess giving me such an expensive gift?’\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also motivate me by sponsoring chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "It was a good thing for me, but honestly, I couldn’t help but tilt my head.\nAfter confirming that, Shael spoke. “It’d be weird to wear both pairs.”\n“Yes, it would, wouldn’t it…”\nTo be honest, I couldn’t understand why she really did it. Obviously there must be some other reason. But I didn’t bother to ask.\nBecause, if I did that, I was sure that she would take back the ring she gave me as a gift.\nInstead, I spoke to Shael, who was wearing the ring on the ring finger of her left hand.\n“Wearing it on the ring finger of your left hand signifies an oath of love. Did you know?”\n“…”\nShael’s face hardened. There was no way the villainess who was ignorant about the matter of love would know things like this.\n“I didn’t wear it in that sense.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Also, I don’t believe in things like that.”\n“I see.” I gave a quick reply. At the same time, I also put the ring on the ring finger of my left hand, then I showed my hand to Shael.\nShael hesitated for a moment and hardened her face, then spoke up, “Put it on the other finger.”\n“Why would I do that?” I asked a question mixed with a slight laugh.\nIt caused Shael to frown at me.\nPerhaps because she realized that I would never wear it on the other finger.\nShael sighed and pulled out the ring from her ring finger. This time, she wore the ring on her index finger.\nSo I said to Shael, “By the way, wearing a ring on your index finger means you want to marry your fiancé.”\n“…”\nOf course, it wasn’t really the case. In fact, I didn’t even know what it meant to wear a ring on your index finger.\nI wasn’t an accessory expert, so there’s no way I knew that.\nBut that wasn’t the point. The important thing was that I managed to trick Shael.\nShael stretched out her hand again to remove the ring from her index finger.\nHowever, I opened my mouth before she could do that.\n“Didn’t you just say that you don’t believe in these things?”\n“…”\nShael glared at me and opened her mouth to speak with a grumpy expression.\n“Be quiet, or I’ll take the ring back.”\n“…”\nI had no choice but to be quiet, and I walked with Shael without saying a word.\nAt some point, Shael had worn the back on her ring finger.\n***\n[Shael’s POV]\nShael put the ring on her ring finger.\nBut as Eran said, if that meant an oath of love, so it would be a little bit problematic, but… she wanted to wear it on her ring finger for some unknown reason.\nIn the first place, as she had said earlier, Shael didn’t really believe in such superstitions.\nShael proudly walked with the ring on her ring finger.\nShe could feel Eran’s gaze, so she wanted to launch a minor attack..\n“I don’t attach much importance to things like rings.”\n“Yes. Is that so?”\nThe way Eran spoke was slightly sarcastic.\nSo Shael added, “I don’t care about the rumors I heard at the dessert shop a while ago.”\n“You say that, but your face turned very red when you heard the rumors.” Eran retorted.\nEran counter attacked as usual, and since he seemed to be right in the first place, she couldn’t even refute it.\nEran’s offensive continued. “It’s rumored that we have a daughter in secret… there were also rumors that it might be because you pounced on me.”\nEran talked as if he was making fun of her.\nThe back story that Shael may have pounced on Eran and gave birth to his child, was something the young ladies at the dessert shop they had visited earlier had theorized.\nShe should have scolded them as soon as she heard it.\nUnfortunately, she couldn’t do that because of Eran. So for now, Shael decided to focus on the task in front of her.\nShael looked at Eran who had a smile on his face, and began to think.\nShe had to come up with a plan to silence her annoying fiancé.\nShe could threaten to take back the ring she gave him as a gift.\nShe could also mention the rumor that Eran had looked at Shael passionately at the banquet hall of the Mage Tower.\nBut they were too weak as a weapon. If she had to compare, they were like small arrows.\nAnd, to defeat Eran at once, she needed a massive weapon like a cannon ball.\nShe thought hard about how she could get back at Eran.\nAt last, a great weapon was forged in her mind, and she opened her mouth to speak.\n“Be quiet before I pounce on you, just like the rumors say I pounced on you.”\n“…”\nEran’s mouth opened and closed at her words and his face flushed red. It seemed that he was very embarrassed.\nIn fact, it was the kind of comment that would make anyone blush in embarrassment.\nBe quiet before I pounce on you… was a fatal and unconventional attack by the villainess.\nShael felt as if she had defeated Eran.\nUsually, she would have ridiculed and made fun of Eran… but she couldn’t.\nThe reason was simple.\nShael’s attack was so powerful that… even she herself was blushing.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also motivate me by sponsoring chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "After making Shael hear the rumors with her own ears, the purpose of us coming out this time had been achieved.\nAnd, Shael was also done with buying the things she wanted, so we left the store.\nIn the bag Shael was holding, there were things she had bought earlier.\n“So, what are you going to use those items for?”\n“I told you earlier.”\nYes, I did hear her say that she would use them on me.\nBut, the question was…\n‘Why the hell would you use a sleep magic tool, rope, and handcuffs on me?’\n“Have you developed some kind of strange fetish?”\n“…?”\nShael tilted her head at my question. Fortunately, it doesn't seem like she’ll use them for the purpose I am thinking about.\nFor now, I stopped asking questions about magic tools. Now I wanted to ask where we were going next.\nI was the one who had offered that we should go out, and we couldn’t just go around and enter random stores.\n“Where do you want to go now?”\n“Over there.”\nThe place Shael pointed to was a magnificent building. This one, too, seemed to be owned by the company that owned the previous store.\n‘A theater?’\n‘It can’t be…’\nBut there it was, a movie theater that should only exist in real life. And, it looked terribly out of place.\n‘Does this even make sense?’\nI didn’t think there was any mention of a movie theater in the original novel.\nAnyways, why am I even bothering to make it an issue when this was a world without any sense of logic from the start.\nBut I still couldn’t get rid of the strange feeling of deja vu.\nNormally, I wouldn’t pay any attention to trivial things like this.\nOf course, this was a world of a romantic fantasy novel that didn’t have any sense of logic.\nThe Mage Tower Lord was defeated without even getting the chance to Duke Jespen even once.\nThe male protagonists had strange personalities.\nIt was all very strange and illogical. So what was wrong with it having a movie theater?\nBut my head continued to throb.\nFor some reason, I thought of the bracelet Clie had given me. After confirming that the bracelet was at full mana capacity, I had kept it in my pocket, because I didn’t know what might happen in the future. Who knows when I might need it.\nAnyways, I was a person who liked plays and movies, so the existence of a movie theater was rather a good thing.\nI went to the theater with Shael, and before long, I let out a deep sigh.\nBecause I saw two familiar forms— Clie and the Crown Prince.\n‘Is this why I suddenly thought of the bracelet?’\nI didn’t know. But there was no way the bracelet would suddenly pop into my mind just because Clie was nearby.\nAnyway, I had thought that Clie seemed to hate the Crown Prince, but contrary to her behavior, it seemed like she was comfortable enough to come watch movies with him.\nMaybe she was forced. Maybe she was deliberately spying on me through the bracelet.\nI didn’t have the time to worry about those things, since I had more important things to do.\nFirst, I quickly blocked her view to prevent Shael from spotting them.\n“What would you like to see?”\n“Anything.”\nShael gave the most difficult answer in the world.\n‘You’re fine with anything?’\nSo, I pointed to fantasy films and started asking questions.\n“How about this?”\n“I don’t like it.”\n“What about this?”\n“I don’t like that either.”\nThe fantasy genre was out of the equation.\nThis time… I pointed to romance movies that wouldn’t suit the villainess.\n“I don’t like it.”\nA quick rejection. Even the horror movies I pointed to next were also rejected.\nBefore I knew it, I had suggested everything in the theater except for a few movies.\nAnd Shael rejected all of them.\n“If you don’t want to watch anything, why the hell did you want to come to the theater?”\n“You haven’t suggested everything yet.”\nShe was right. There were still a few movies left that I hadn’t suggested to Shael.\nThe reason being, the genre wasn’t that appropriate.\nBut Shael pointed to a movie without looking at the title.\n“Let’s watch this.”\n“…”\nI went silent.\nYou could just tell from the title that it was a strange movie. It was definitely not a movie a couple should watch on a date.\n‘No, it should be the most appropriate one, right? Hahh, I don’t know…’\nAfter noticing my expression, Shael turned her head to check the title of the movie.\n[The Lady, Her Fiancé, and the Bon*dage of Love]\nAfter I confirmed that Shael was embarrassed, I asked, “Does that fit your taste?”\n“…”\nA moment of silence, I was able to see the villainess blush red in shame.\nAs she should, since it was a situation where anyone would feel ashamed.\nNo matter how much Shael was ignorant about these things, she should’ve at least looked at the title of the movie.\nShael withdrew her hand from pointing the the movie, and casually pointed to a normal romance movie.\n“That’s about right. I would love to see this.”\nUsually, I wouldn’t make fun of Shael more than that, but, I had no choice but to say more.\nIt was because of the magic tools in Shael’s bag— sleeping magic tools, a rope, and handcuffs.\n“No way! Are those magic tools for…”\n“No!”\nAfter that, I turned my head to check the title of the movie again.\nIt had the “Fiance” and the “Lady” as its two main leads.\nIt perfectly fit the relationship between me and Shael.\n“But the title of the movie, is [The Lady, Her Fiancé, and the Bon*dage of Love].”\n“That…”\nShael couldn’t speak more than that.\n“There must have been a reason why you suddenly asked me to come to the theater.”\nShael couldn’t answer this time either.\nLooking at Shael’s red face, I could tell that this wasn’t what she intended, but… you never know.\nIn the first place, I had my doubts about her buying those magic tools.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also motivate me by sponsoring chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "But I was a good fiancé!\nI had been enduring the nasty character of the villainess for years, so I could endure her having at least one such bizarre preferences.\n“I will respect you having that kind of preference.”\nBut, that didn’t mean that I would have to be submissive.\n“But, let me tell you, I prefer doing the tying rather than being tied.”\n“Ha.”\n“I can’t concede that much.”\nShael glared at me.\nI didn’t know what that meant. Was it because my remark had crossed the line, or was it because she wasn’t willing to concede that role?\nAnyways, I looked at the title of the movie Shael had pointed out with a smile.\n[The Lady’s Seduction of the Young Lord]\nIt was a movie with a title that would provide me with many opportunities to make fun of Shael.\n* * *\nThe movie theater had more convenient features than I thought. Some of the features couldn’t be seen even in modern times.\nFor example, if you want to talk to the person next to you, there was a magic tool that you could activate so that others can't hear you.\nHowever, something felt strange. I should have just skipped over it, but the noise control magic tools installed on the floor felt very familiar for some reason.\n‘It’s not a big deal.’\nI tried to shake off my thoughts and focus on Shael.\nThe cookie jar I had given to Shael was completely empty before I knew it.\n“Stop eating.”\nShael shook her head, and expressed a strong refusal.\n“It’s no use even if you shake your head. I won’t give you any more.”\n“I even gave you a ring.”\n‘Did you give me a ring for this?’\nTo think that Shael was exchanging an expensive ring for some cheap dessert.\nShael looked at me eagerly. Now she was asking for more!\nThe villainess’s usual ferocious expression was gone, and only a cute desperate expression remained.\nAnyway, the selfish villainess only put on a cute face when she wanted something.\nOf course, I directly ignored it. Thanks to that, I was able to immerse myself in the film.\n[The poor Lady lost her fiancé, but got him back through a contract with the Demon King!]\nShael started to show interest in the movie as well.\nAnyways, why the hell would the Demon King appear in a fluffy romance movie?\n“Is there really such a thing as a Demon King?”\nA Demon King?\nThere were also demons in this world, so I didn’t think it would be strange that there would be a Demon King.\nBut I shook my head at Shael’s words.\nThere was no mention of it in the original novel. So if I really thought about it, there was a high chance that there wasn’t one.\nAfter shaking my head, I immersed myself in the movie again.\n[What are these medicine, Renaella. I don’t need so many for a wound like this.]\n[They have no side effects, so quickly take them.]\nIn the movie, the female lead put a heap of medicine on the table.\nIt was indeed a bit too much, comically so. And it caused the people watching the movie laugh out loud.\nBut, it wasn’t the same for Shael. Her face hardened. She must have recalled the memory where she gave me similar amount of medicine.\nNo, she amount of medicine she had given me was even more than the amount shown in the movie.\n[The more you eat, the better the effect will be. So take them, because it will help the wound.]\nThe female lead spoke with a face full of worry.\nI looked at Shael, and she immediately shook her head. It looked like she was denying that was the reason she had made me take all those medicine.\nOf course, there was no way I would easily let this opportunity pass!\n“You were worried about me, so you gave me so many medicine.”\n“No.” Shael stopped talking after a simple denial.\nThe reason she had given me the medicine must have been to make me suffer from the bitter taste.\nBut Shael was well aware that it was an absurd reason to say out loud.\n“You also gave me medicine once. Was it because you were worried about me?”\nInstead, the villainess started attacking me as well, similar to the times when I usually fought back.\nAnyway, it seemed that Shael was gradually learning from me.\nThen she stared at me and showed a proud smile. The villainess was waiting for me to admit defeat.\nI also smiled and counterattacked, “Yes, that’s right. I give it to you because I was worried, so why did you give it to me?”\n“What…that’s…” Shael became perplexed.\nSo I decided to attack her more, “So you gave me the medicine because you were als worried about me?”\n“…”\nShael didn’t answer. It was because she had no excuses, so she couldn’t even strike back.\nAt that moment, even the movie started to help me.\n[This, what is this?]\nThe female lead pressed the male lead against the wall, keeping him in between.\nIt was a familiar scene.\nIt was similar to what Shael did to me at the Azbel family garden.\n“Come to think of it, you did that to me as well.”\n“…”\n“Looking at it now, you seemed to have done them all to me.”\nShael didn’t answer. So I turned my head towards Shael, who seemed to be lost in thought.\nIt was obvious what she was thinking about. She must be looking for a way to strike back at me.\nThen, Shael’s mouth, which had been closed for a while, finally opened.\n“Be quiet or I’ll pounce on you.”\nIt was something I had heard not long ago. The villainess was now recycling her attack.\nTo be honest, I had to admit that I had panicked the first time she said it. I mean, anyone would be embarrassed if they heard something like that.\nIt was clear that Shael was aiming for that effect again by uttering such an absurd thing.\nA sneer had formed on Shael’s face before long. At the same time she had become confident of her own victory. However, that didn’t last long.\n“I see. Then I guess we’ll be seeing our daughter soon.”\nThe villainess was counterattacked!\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also motivate me by sponsoring chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "We left the theater. Now, I should avoid running into Clie and go home.\nI walked alongside Shael, while checking my surroundings through sight magic.\nAnd then I finally noticed, that my efforts were in vain from the start.\nClie was watching Shael and me from some distance.\nFortunately, the Crown Prince was not around Clie. But that didn’t make the situation any better.\nAs Shael and I moved, Clie seemed to be secretly following us.\n‘Why was she suddenly following us?’\n“…”\n“…?”\nWhen I stopped walking for a moment, Shael tilted her head.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“No…nothing.”\nBut Shael didn’t stop her questioning. The villainess was unusually quick to notice some thing at times like this.\n“Tell the truth.”\n“It’s nothing, really.”\nAs it was always with the villainess, she didn’t believe me.\n“Let’s go back to the Azbel family now.” I said, ignoring Clie’s presence and moved my steps.\nI didn’t want to meet Clie just yet. It was due to the advice written in the book, and there’s no way Shael would like Clie.\nHowever, the villainess directly rejected my proposal.\n“No. Let’s walk a bit more.”\n“Yes.”\nI had no power to refuse her.\nUsually, Shael was the type of person who didn’t really like to wander outside.\nOnly days like today were different.\nWhen I looked at Shael with a questioning gaze, I found that her face had turned frosty.\n‘No way, did she notice Clie?’\nMaybe she did. Shael could be very perceptive at times like this.\nIn the first place, Clie wasn’t even trying to hide that had while following us.\n“Come on.”\nI confirmed my guess from her words filled with anger. Shael had indeed noticed that Clie was following us.\nI let out a sigh and walked along with Shael.\nClie still continued to follow us.\nI couldn’t understand why the hell she was doing that.\nBut before long, I had to erase that thought. No, I had no choice but to erase it.\n“What is it?”\n“Be quiet.”\nBecause Shael had suddenly grabbed my hand!\nOf course, it was something she would never do if it was the usual villainess.\nBut the situation was different now that Clie was following us. It was clear that Shael was conscious of Clie and held my hand.\nTo be honest, I didn’t understand why she would have to hold my hand just because Clie was watching.\nBut, when I thought about it again, it wasn’t something unexpected.\nIf, by any chance, Shael had heard the sound of my bracelet, she would think I was in private contact with Clie.\nFrom Shael’s point of view, Clie and I were acting in a way that anyone would be suspicious of.\nIn addition, Shael hated Clie to death. So, she must have decided to hold my hand, even though it would be shameful.\nShe was even showing off the ring on her left hand.\nI decided to speak up while I was being dragged by Shael’s right hand, “How about going slowly?”\n“Slowly?”\nI immediately closed my mouth at Shael’s expressionless face.\nShael was indeed very angry.\nWell, it was natural, since Clie, who she hated so much, was following her.\nTo be honest, it was already very fortunate that Shael didn’t bother to go confront Clie. If it was the original villainess from the novel, she wouldn’t be able to stand it and she would have gone to torment Clie.\nThen, Shael frowned. I noticed the look on her face. It was the look she made when she wanted to find a way to annoy me.\nThis time, the target wasn’t me, it was Clie.\nThen, Shael came up with a method and directly put it into action.\n“What…”\nShael had embraced my arm! Even if it was in front of Clie, it was a shocking action!\nThat villainess embraced my arm?\nAnyway, it seemed that the romance movie she watched earlier had influenced Shael. From holding hands to embracing arms. Everything was executed in the order they appeared in the movie.\nIt kind of made sense, since Shael didn’t have any other way to know about such things except for the movie she just saw.\nKewk!\nA dog on a leash passed by Shael and me. When Shael saw that, she seemed to have an inspiration.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Wait.”\nShael rummaged through the bag of things she had bought in that store. And the things in that bag were all unusual items.\n“Why are you taking that out now?”\n“Come here.”\nShael took out the rope and lifted it. Her eyes were on the nape of my neck.\nA chill runs down my spine.\n“No!”\n“I gave you a ring too.”\nI do appreciate the ring, but…\n‘isn’t that the same as wrapping a leash around a person’s neck? Just like the dog that just passed by?’\nHowever, Shael’s seemed firm in her intention. Then with a deep sigh, she handed the rope over to me.\nOf course, it wasn’t for me to tie the rope on my own neck.\n“Come here.”\n“…?”\n“You have to tie me up.”\n“What, what?”\nAnyway, the villainess was being selfish again. She was telling me to tie the rope around her neck!\nSo, I directly refused.\n“Didn’t you tell me that you will respect my preference? You can’t break your words.”\n[I prefer doing the tying rather than being tied.]\nActually, I had said it as a joke, but who knew that this would happen.\n“…”\nShael remained silent.\nNo sane person would do something like that in public.\nBut… I had forgotten that Shael was crazy.\n“Go on.” Shael nodded her head.\nIt didn’t matter if Clie was still following us… to think that she would go this far.\n‘Maybe she really has strange preferences?’\n“It was just a joke. How can I tie a rope around your neck in public? You’re not a dog.”\n“I’m not joking.” Shael said as she held out her neck. “You can’t? Surely, you’re not spineless wimp, right?”\nShe was even provoking me.\nI must say, it was a very effective provocation!\nAs a result of that provocation, I tied the rope around Shael’s neck before I knew it.\nIt was fortunate that it was a thin rope. Thanks to that, it looked like she was on a leash.\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "‘Why are we doing this?’\nI walked with that thought in silence for a moment while holding onto the rope tied to Shael.\n‘Is this the right thing to do?’\nI didn’t know.\nA child whispered to her mother.\nㅡ Mom, look over there! That pretty sister is on a leash!\n— Shh, shh! Don’t look at them!\nShael’s face went red with shame. It was the same for me too.\nI couldn’t believe that we were doing this on the street where everyone was passing by.\nKhawk!\nEven the leashed puppy, who was in a similar situation to Shael, barked at her as if it was mocking her.\nShe seemed be feeling extremely ashamed and it also seemed like her provocation plan went out of her mind for a moment. Now she should agree to give up due to the shame.\n“It would be better to untie the rope.”\n“…”\nThe villainess looked troubled. Should she give up the ropes due to the shame, or endure the shame to defeat Clie?\n“I had previously insulted you as a bi*tch, but now it turned out to be true.”\nAt my provocation, Shael, who was pondering between the two options, gave an answer.\n“Untie it.”\nShael finally gave up. However, after staring at the ropes for a moment, she appealed to me as if it was unfair.\n“Tie yourself up too.”\n“Yes?”\n[An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. I was tied up, so you should be tied too.]\nThat’s what Shael insisting on.\n“Are you crazy?”\n“…?”\n[Why did I get scolded?] Shael looked at me in bewilderment.\nOf course, I had no answer.\nI just continued walking without speaking.\nClie was still following Shael and me. Since she had been following us so persistently, I became curious.\n‘Do she have something important to say?’\nThen she should’ve just used the bracelet.\nI couldn’t even guess the reason. But soon, an opportunity came. It was a chance to talk to Clie.\nShael was pointing to the restrooms nearby.\n“Yes, I will wait.”\nShael went into the bathroom.\nAt the same time, I glanced in the direction of Clie, and before I knew it, Clie was right in front of me.\nI was the one who was supposed to approach Clie, but she came to me instead. So, we must end the conversation. Because Shael could come out of the bathroom any moment now.\n“Why are you following me?”\nThat wasn’t the only thing I was curious about. If she was following us, another question would be, why she was making it so obvious?\n“Well, aren’t you going to answer?”\nClie smiled like a snake.\nFeeling uneasy, I cast a sound blocking spell around us.\nIt would be a disaster if Shael overheard the conversation.\nClie remained silent. She seemed to be waiting for the right time. I guess there won’t be any more conversations.\nShael would be out soon. Before she did, I had to make Clie leave.\n“We’ll talk later, so leave for today.”\nHowever, Clie still waited for something in silence.\nThe situation was turning dangerous by the second!\nFeeling that something was terribly wrong, I opened my mouth again. However, I couldn’t utter any words!\nThe faint holy power that Clie was emitting was now weighing down my body.\nEven though it was a faint holy power, it was enough to make me feel pain.\nAt some point, the sound blocking magic I had cast disappeared due to Clie’s holy power.\n‘Was the holy power such a strong force in the original novel?’\nNo.\nIt was just a power that helped Clie survive the incurable disease and helped heal someone.\nIt was never a power with such brute force.\nIt’s not that Clie couldn’t use magic in the novel, but she couldn’t use magic through holy power like she was doing now.\nSo it was clear that something was wrong. The holy power was still suppressed my voice.\nIt was then, Clie suddenly opened her mouth to speak,\n“I love you too, Young Lord!”\nShe was suddenly saying nonsensical words. And she also added the word ‘too’, to make it sound as if I had said that to Clie first.\nI couldn’t help but notice the sinister ulterior motive behind those words.\nBecause Clie’s eyes locked behind me.\n‘Shael!’\nShael must be watching us.\n‘What the hell is she doing! I have to tell her right now…’\nI was still being suppressed by Clie’s holy power and couldn’t speak. Holy power shouldn’t be able to suppress or cancel mana like this!\nI could just imagine what would happen in the future.\nEven if Clie left and I gave Shael an explanation.\nEven if I told the truth, it would only seem like a lie.\nShael, who knew that I had been communicating with Clie through the bracelet, would never believe me.\nEven when Clie was following us, I had been pretending not to know.\nShael could be unusually smart only in situations like this, she might have noticed that I was pretending not to know.\nMost importantly, what was suppressing my voice was not mana, but faint holy power. If she was using mana, my excuse would’ve been more believable.\n[Clie used magic on me so I couldn’t speak.]\nEven if it was a meaningless excuse, it would’ve worked. Because it would mean that my magic skills were worse than Clie.\nBut what was suppressing my voice was a faint holy power. Not only would it be hard for Shael to sense it, but holy power didn’t have that kind of power in the first place.\nAfter coming to this world, I had studied the holy power to a great extent, so it was a fact I was sure of.\nTherefore, this was an extremely dangerous situation!\nA situation that the main characters in a cringy novel would normally go through.\nAfter that, all sorts of misunderstandings would arise.\nBut I wasn’t the main character in a cringy novel.\nWhile looking at Clie, who was showing a sly smile, I raised my middle finger.\nAnd, I moved my mouth at the same time.\nEven though she couldn’t hear the words because I was suppressed by the holy power, that was enough.\n[Bit*ch]\nI didn’t know if I was being too rude, but… that didn’t really matter.\nMy personality was like that. I prefer being rude rather than being suppressed.\nI mean, I even cursed at my one and only fiancé.\nBut this time, it wasn't enough!\nAfter thinking for a moment, I reached out my hand toward the scabbard.\nGoblin:\nThis is sponsor chapter 1 of 10, sponsored by\nGroggy\n!

      "content": "Chae-ae-aeng!\nIt was the sound of me drawing my sword.\nAt that refreshing sound, Clie looked at me in bewilderment.\nBut that was only for a moment as Clie carefully changed the flow of the output.\nDense holy power hovered around Clie, who had finished grasping the situation in seconds.\nI became nervous. Compared to the faint holy power that had blocked my voice earlier, it was an incomparable amount. And, Clie’s holy power wrapped around my body before I could even react.\nI could feel the weight on my body. It was to the point where my body couldn’t move properly.\nClie was smiling again. Even though I had drawn my sword, she seemed to regard me as not much of a threat.\nShhhing!\nSince I couldn’t even move my body properly, I put back the sword I had pulled out. I was convinced that I shouldn’t fight.\nThe holy power that Clie possessed was too powerful. It was something completely different from the original novel.\nPerhaps even Duke Jespen would have trouble contending against the current Clie.\nI didn’t actually unsheath my sword with the intention of cutting her down. I was just angry, and I did that as a threat.\nBut now that things had come to this, such threats were useless.\nThinking that my life might be in danger, I had to control my anger.\nIt was natural to control your anger in front of a strong person.\nFirst of all, I had to gather information.\nWhen I unsheathed the sword, Clie also erased her holy power.\n“As far as I know, holy power doesn’t have this kind of power.”\n“Yes, that’s right, Young Lord.”\nThen what kind of holy power did you use?\nClie seemed to understand my question, “Because I am special.”\n‘Of course you’re special. Because you’re the main character of the original novel. Still, that force makes no sense!’\nLeaving aside the fact that there was no such force in the novel, the strength of that force was unusual. Its emergence was completely out of the blue.\nIf Clie had had that kind of brute force in the novel, the novel would have ended quite early, since the heroine had the power to beat the villainess by herself.\nAnyways, I felt the need to change the topic. Because the bracelet, which was supposed to be the source of Clie’s holy power, was in my magic pouch.\nIf Clie used her retrieval magic, she would be able to retrieve the bracelet from anywhere, but I should be able to block the retrieval magic.\nBecause in the original novel, Clie had her bracelet stolen by Shael as well. Of course she had no way to break or destroy it even if she had it.\nIt was because the item was said to be very sacred, and it allowed it’s user to possess enormous holy power.\nBreaking it couldn’t be that easy.\nBut, since I already have it, wouldn’t it be possible to do something about that?\nAnyway, it seemed Clie wouldn’t give me an answer even if I asked her about her astonishing increase in power.\nSo I asked another thing instead.\n“Why are you doing this to me and Shael?\nWithout answering my question, Clie asked back. “Why are you so devoted to her?”\nWhat she was asking about was the reason for my devotion. It was quite obvious that the object of that devotion was Shael.\n“At the banquet hall, and even in this situation…”\nClie’s voice turned faint at the end as she continued to speak.\n“Even in the past.”\n‘The past?’\nSo did Clie regress as I had expected?\nThen the past that Clie was talking about right now… must be from the point of view of the original novel.\nAfter speaking, Clie stared at me in silence. She was waiting for my answer.\nWhy was I so devoted to Shael?\nThe Eran Baslett from the original novel must have been devoted to Shael because of his good nature.\nThen what about me? I wasn’t as good natured as Eran Baslett from the novel.\nWhile reading the novel, I was just a bit more interested to the story of Shael, and became curious about why she became a villainess.\nHowever, what was the reason now that I had become a part of the novel?\nOf course, if I succeeded in rehabilitating the villainess, only good things would happen. But I didn’t really have to do it that urgently.\nBecause I had the status of being the son of a duke. Even if I abandoned Shael and separated from her, I could live an affluent life.\nBut I would never do that. The reason was simple. So I spoke clearly to Clie, who was still waiting for my answer.\n“Shael is cute. Unlike someone who is like a snake.”\n“Pffft!” Clie asked back with a laugh, “Do you really think so?”\nCertainly, it was a statement that would make anyone doubtful. But there were many moments I could think of where Shael was exceptionally cute.\nOur pitiful battle of pride with a teacup.\nThe times when she asked for desserts.\nAnd the times when she secretly ate the desserts.\nSo I said while pondering over Shael’s actions.\n“Everything she does is cute. Oh, and I also need to see my daughter.”\nClie looked even more bewildered compared to when I had unsheathed my sword earlier.\nI mean, she had already seen Ruelle, so she would probably think that we might really have a hidden daughter.\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "Maybe that’s why she looked even more bewildered. Of course, it wasn’t much of a concern to me.\n“Now I want to ask. What happened with the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord?”\nBecause it seemed like she hated the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord, and only wanted to use them. So I had to ask that question.\n“They are boring.”\nBoring? Maybe she got tired of them and abandoned them. I couldn't understand the meaning behind the answer.\nThat answer didn’t help me at all.\nAnyways, there were many things I wanted to ask, but I couldn’t.\n“…”\nBecause Shael, who had already come out of the bathroom before I knew it, was standing next to me.\nHer face was strangely red.\nShe must have heard everything I said, and she must have come out because she couldn’t stand the shame.\n“…”\n“…?”\nThen I was taken aback by Shael’s behavior. Because Shael, who had been lost in her thoughts for a while, suddenly held my hand! Just like she did when Clie was following us.\nThis time she even crossed her arms around me. It was the same order as before.\nFortunately, there was no catastrophic actions similar to when she had taken out the rope.\nClie, who was watching this closely, opened her mouth.\n“I won’t mind… for now. Because it doesn’t seem like the right time yet.”\nClie said coldly. Then she turned around and started walking away.\nI immediately turned my head to Shael.\nShe had created a magic circle!\nAs soon as I confirmed this, I hurriedly said, “Ah, please stop!”\n“…”\nShael was preparing to strike Clie at the back of her head, but I was able to stop her in time.\nClie had disappeared before I knew it. Fortunately, it seems that the dire situation had safely passed.\nBut…\n‘She said she won’t mind for now?’\n‘It sounds more like a murder notice.’\nThe current Clie’s weapon was not only the strengthened holy power unlike how it was in the original novel.\nFor one thing, Clie could also use the male protagonists, the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.\nSince she was the female lead, she must have been favored not only by them but also by many people.\n‘Am I in trouble?’\nI didn’t know. But no matter what, Shael and I were also descendants of dukes.\nI think we should be safe for a while. I just have to find a way during the time I have.\nI took out the magic pouch and looked at Clie’s bracelet. It was the bracelet that was the source of Clie’s powerful holy power.\nShe didn’t try to take this bracelet back even if she could use the retrieval magic.\nShe knew that was impossible to break the bracelet. So she was probably using it to track me down and talk to me.\nIf I manege to somehow break this bracelet, I would be able to erase the overwhelming force of the holy power that she demonstrated out of the blue.\nClie seemed really confident that she had the power to confront us.\nBesides that, I also had a feeling that this bracelet wouldn’t break that easily, but I guess I’ll have to find some way.\nIn the first place, breaking the bracelet was not really going to solve the main problem.\nBecause Clie had the support of the male protagonists who would one day posses tremendous power.\nSo the best solution would be to resolve it through dialogue.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Nothing.”\nI put the bracelet back in the pouch. I was distracted and had taken out the bracelet in front of the villainess.\nI had to change the subject before she could get mad at me.\n“How long are you going to keep holding my arm?”\n“Ah…”\nShael hurried away from me. Then she said, “You need to explain what happened.”\n“Let’s go to the Azbel Mansion.”\nThere was no way the quick-tempered villainess would accept it. But, unexpectedly, the Shael obediently followed my suggestion.\nAnd on the way to the Azbel family, when we reached a street corner, Shael suddenly used magic to spill water on me.\nHowever, the magic was slower than usual, so I was able to avoid it.\n“Ah, what is it all of a sudden?”\nIt didn’t take me long to realize why she was acting like this.\nShael must have heard the conversation between Clie and me.\n[Shael is cute. Unlike someone who is like a snake.]\nI said that. When I finished thinking, Shael barely opened her mouth to speak.\n“What did you mean?”\nAt those words, I recalled more of my conversation with Clie.\n[Everything she does is cute.]\nYeah, that’s what I said.\nIt was clear that the villainess was now questioning my remarks.\nGoblin:\nThis is sponsor chapter 2 of 10, sponsored by Groggy!

      "content": "“…”\nShael glared at me, and waited for my answer.\n‘Isn’t this also kind of cute?’\nI didn’t know either. No, it seems a bit like that.\nShe didn’t seem cute when she tried to harass me, but… during those times I just looked at the results.\nAnyways, regardless of how I felt, my answer would remain the same.\n“Yes, you are cute.”\n“…”\nI answered Shael’s question with an affirmation. I mean, I had to answer that way regardless of my opinions and how cheesy it sounded.\nBecause I wanted to see Shael’s embarrassed face.\n“Why… why?”\n‘Why?’\nI couldn’t give a reply. I also had a thing called shame. It’d be a little too much to say something like that in front of the person in question.\nAfter a moment of silence, Shael spoke again.\n“You have very strange tastes.”\nWell, she’s kind of right. I mean who would call a villainess who bulled him, cute?\nI also thought that my tastes were indeed quite strange. Of course, the villainess herself was no different, she also had strange taste.\nWhat kind of young lady liked catfish and trampled on flowers as a hobby?\n“You have strange tastes too.”\n“…?”\n“Isn’t that why we are engaged to each other?”\nShael shut her mouth. She let out another sigh and lowered her head. This time she talked about a completely different topic.\n“I was not serious about attacking you…”\nShael couldn’t even finish her words and blushed in shame. As for why she was suddenly talking about it, the reason was simple.\nIt was due to the conversation I had with Clie before.\n[Everything she does is cute. Oh, and I also need to see my daughter.]\n‘Is that why she’s saying that?’\nOf course I knew that it also might be a joke to annoy me. Otherwise, there’s no way the villainess would say such a thing to me.\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes.”\nBut I wasn’t joking.\n“I wasn’t joking when I said that.”\n“…!”\n‘I have to see Ruelle again.’\nAt my words, which was enough to make anyone blush if they heard them, Shael spoke as if she was taken aback.\n“So you want us to have a child?”\n“Well, isn’t that what you suggested first?”\nEven if it was a joke, it was Shael who had said it first.\nHowever, hiding my true feelings, I had no choice but to add.\n“It was actually a joke.”\nI had to make that choice, because Shael was making an increasingly suspicious face.\n“Ha…”\nI was able to make the villainess sigh as a bonus. But that wasn’t the end.\nAs usual, the villainess was thinking about how she could torment me.\nIf I made her feel embarrassed, she will definitely try to take revenge on me.\nWell, she can try. At the same time, I will be able to make fun of the villainess even more.\nHowever, the words that came out of Shael’s mouth were something I didn’t expect.\n“You are cute too, Eran.”\nI reflexively put my hand on the scabbard, and almost drew my sword.\nBecause it was such a disgusting remark!\n‘I’m cute?’\nActually, I knew that she wasn’t serious at all, and she was just lying to make fun of me.\nBut, I still felt offended. I think I now know a little bit about how Shael felt when I teased her.\nBut I barely endured it. And, I knew what I had to do to counter that.\nI had to come up with more embarrassing and cheesy remarks that would make the villainess feel even more ashamed.\nI told the villainess who was appreciating my flustered expression.\n“But I’m less cute than you.”\nI forcibly moved my motionless mouth and spoke up. It was a statement that was cringy enough to hurt even me. But I had to endure!\nBecause the remark that hurt me also caused enormous damage to the villainess.\n“What, what….”\n“What, do you have any problems with that?”\n“…”\nChing!\nIt was then that I heard a voice from behind. It was the sound of something falling.\nShael and I looked back with an ominous feeling in our hearts.\nWe were right in front of the Azbel family’s mansion… and we didn’t pay attention to people around us.\nAs expected, ominous feeling hit the bullseye!\nIt was Duke Jespen!\nDuke Jespen dropped the magic tool he was holding and was staring at Shael.\n“Amazing…”\nIt was obvious why he said that. It was clear that Duke Jespen overheard my conversation with Shael.\n“You are cute too, Eran.” He repeated Shael’s remark.\n“…”\nAt that, Shael lowered her head. She couldn’t even make an excuse.\nGood timing!\nDuke Jespen had listened to that embarrassing conversation, so I thought I could tease Shael more effectively.\nThe appearance of a reliable ally would be of great help in defeating the wicked villainess.\nBut contrary to my thoughts… Duke Jespen wasn’t on my side.\n“I’m less cute than you.”\nDuke Jespen, who had been blurting out embarrassing things behind our backs, added as if he had suddenly realized something.\n“I learned a useful thing from Eran. I should use it on Enella.”\n“…”\nDamn it!\n* * *\nInside Shael’s familiar room.\nIt’s been a rough day.\nWe encountered Clie, the heroine of the original novel, and I experienced her overwhelming power holy power.\nTo be honest, I was still a bit dumbfounded. I didn’t know what would happen if I became hostile to Clie.\nGoblin:\nI think I should be more transparent about the reason why I have been shamelessly asking for more support from the readers.\nDuring the previous pandemic, my family business was pretty much destroyed. I am still a student and I did my best to support them, but it was far from enough. After the pandemic, my father did something stupid and got our family into a lot of debts. Then the economy crashed. And now, those debts have become knives hanging above our necks.\nOriginally, the amount I manage to earn should've been enough to keep the family afloat. But, that isn't possible due to the debts.\nI'm trying my best and doing whatever I can to survive, that includes swallowing my pride and asking people for money.\nAnd, I will be doing that again.\nIf you are reading this, please help if you can, no matter how small the amount.

      "content": "Now, what should we do next?\nEven now, although I had entered Shael’s room, I just couldn’t erase that agony. So in Shael’s eyes, I must have looked tired.\n“Are you tired?”\n“No.”\n“Go to sleep.”\n‘Absolutely not! Who knows what you’ll do if I did that.’\nAs I shook my head in disapproval, Shael carefully looked at the paper she was holding and nodded her head.\nI couldn’t use vision magic anymore since the villainess had earned about the existence of sight magic, and she was protecting the paper from my sight.\n“What are you reading? Let me see as well.”\n“No.”\nI got up from my seat. Every time Shael looked at that paper, she made strange requests to me, such as telling to go to sleep or use a breathing magic tool.\nI raised my head to take a peal and got quick glance at the contents of the paper.\nㅡWhen you are tired, you have to go to sleep quickly.\nㅡIt would be helpful to keep the body still when sleeping.\nㅡ Getting a massage is a great help in circulating one’s mana.\n‘What are these suggestions for?’\nI didn’t know. Still, they were not something strange, so I decided to let it pass without much thought.\nAfter taking a look at Shael’s paper, I was about to go back to my seat, but Shael tripped me.\nAt the same time, Shael climbed onto me so I couldn’t move.\n“What are you doing? What is this?”\n“Be quiet.”\nIt’s a situation where no one would be able to keep quiet.\nHowever, I had no choice but to stay quiet. Because Shael took out a familiar type of magic tool. Its true identity was the sleeping magic tool she had bought earlier.\n“Wait!”\nI wanted to resist, but I couldn’t. Apart from the fact that I was extremely tired, Shael was now sitting on top of me, so I couldn’t even think properly.\nI fell into a state of light sleep after that.\nFortunately, it was only a light sleep. When I opened my eyes again, it didn’t seem like that much time had passed.\nBut there was a big problem.\n“What is this?”\nI had handcuffs on my hands, and the ropes wrapped around my body. She was even using a military grade magic tool that neutralized the opponents mana!\nNo matter how cautious I was, I didn’t expect that she would use one of the magic tools the Azbel family developed.\nI felt helpless.\nThe rope was tightly wrapped around my body and couldn’t be torn by force.\n“Please release me.”\nThe villainess showed a mocking smile. It’s meaning was simple— she won’t release me.\nIt was a situation where I couldn’t break free, and there’s no way the villainess would release me.\nI didn’t know why the hell she tied me up, but… there is a saying that if you can’t avoid it, then enjoy it.\nI gritted my teeth and said to Shael, “Didn’t I tell you that I prefer to tie rather than be tied?”\n“Ha.”\n“I think I said in the beginning that I wouldn’t concede that much…” I couldn’t finish my words.\nKi kiiik!\nBecause the door that was firmly closed, suddenly opened.\nIt was a similar situation that usually happened very often. And even the person who opened the door was the same as usual.\nIt was Duke Jespen.\nHe looked at me in amazement as I was tied up.\n“Kheum, excuse me.”\nKikiiik…\nDuke Jespen quickly left.\nShael and I had no choice but to remain silent.\n***\n[Duke Jespen’s POV]\nDuke Jespen left Shael’s room.\n‘I’m glad they are alright.’\nHe was worried that Eran and Shael might quarrel.\nHe really didn’t want to see that happen. Because of that, he often went in and out of Shael’s room without knocking.\nIn fact, he wanted to witness the lovers quarrel between two fresh lovers.\nAnother reason was his longtime friend, Duke Ezran, who had lost his lively personality after he lost his wife.\n‘If the two of them had a serious fight, I would feel very sorry for him.’\nAfter losing his beloved, Duke Ezran’s personality had changed enough to make you think that he may have lost his emotions.\nDuke Jespen felt pain in his heart whenever he though of Duke Ezran.\nBecause if Duke Jespen also lost his wife… he would end up in a similar state as him as well.\n‘I suddenly miss Enella.’\nDuke Jespen thought as he turned towards Enella’s residence.\n[Didn’t I tell you that I prefer to tie rather than be tied?]\nHe recalled what Eran said while he was tied up.\nHowever, Duke Jespen could not sympathize at all.\n‘It’s better to be tied than to to the tying…’\nWasn’t that a matter of course?\nHe reached Enella while relishing his thoughts.\n[I’m less cute than you.]\nHe wanted to use the words he had learned on Enella.\nTo do that, he had to first be praised as being cute.\nDuke Jespen approached Enella.\nAt the same time, he showed off his maximum charm.\n“Jespen?”\n“Yes, Enella.”\nAfter staring at Duke Jespen for a moment, Enella opened her mouth.\n“That’s gross.”\nOn that day, Duke Jespen locked himself in his room and didn’t come out.\nGoblin:\nThis is sponsor chapter 3 of 10, sponsored by Groggy!

      "content": "Shael looked down at me. I couldn’t understand why the hell she was tying me up for.\n“…?”\n“Stay still.”\nShael started poking my forearm while holding the rope.\n‘What is she going to do again this time?’\n“It tickles!”\n“Close your mouth.”\nThe villainess silenced me and started pressing her arm against my forearm.\nIt was as if she wanted to give me a massage.\nWhat suddenly came to mind was the paper Shael was looking at earlier.\n[Getting a massage is a great help in circulating one’s mana.]\nIt seemed that suggestion was written in it.\n‘Is she just following the suggestions on that paper?’\nThen I need to figure out what the suggestions are for.\nI asked Shael while pointing to the paper with my gaze.\n“What is that paper for?”\nShael didn’t answer my question, and produced a magic circle.\nSuddenly, the paper turned to ashes and scattered on the floor.\nOh well, it looks like I’ll have to focus on Shael, and I’ll have to give up on finding out about the paper.\nBut I was still quite curious. Even if it was suggested on the paper that a massage would be beneficial, it was still surprising that Shael decided to give me a massage.\n‘Well, it’s not a big deal. As long as it stays like this, let’s enjoy just it.’\n“I think my right shoulder is quite stiff.”\n“Don’t… order me”\nDespite what she said, Shael followed my words. But I was a bit disappointed.\n“Please knead the stomach a little more.”\n“…”\n“Oh, go a bit lower.”\nI feel better than I thought. Maybe it was because I’m tired, it felt very comforting.\n“How do you like this, then?”\nShael stared pinching my back. I couldn’t even resist because I was tied up with a rope.\n”I’ll be quiet, so please don’t pinch me!”\nStill, it was fortunate that she didn’t burn me with magic. Before long, Shael stopped pinching me.\nBut at the same time, Shael got up from her seat and walked at the place where I had put my magic pouch, and she directly opened my magic pouch!\nNo, is she stealing my things in front of my eyes?\nFortunately, the pearl that Ruelle had given me was inside my chest pocket.\nIt was an item that I should never lose, so I was carrying it with all kinds of protection magic.\nI think I did a good job by not putting it in the magic pouch. It would be a serious issue if the villainess ever found out about the pearl.\nBut it wasn’t like there wouldn’t be any damage. The serpent orb that I used to control the villainess was in the magic pouch.\n“I’ll be taking my things back.”\n“…”\nI couldn’t say anything and had no choice but to watch as my leverage was taken away. Well, that thing belonged to Shael from the start, so it was okay.\nEven though I lost a tool to intimidate the villainess, there was still another weapon called dessert.\nAs Shael naturally took out the dessert from my magic pouch, she asked, “What about the medicine?”\n“…?”\n‘What? I don’t know what you’re talking about.’\n“Well, it’s nothing.”\nIt was a suspicious question, but I had no choice but to ignore it. It would be embarrassing if I said more, and Clie’s bracelet, which was supposed to be hidden under my clothes, was discovered.\nFortunately, Shael took out all the desserts from my magic pouch and closed the magic pouch with satisfaction.\nWith the cupcake in her mouth.\n“Do you like it?”\n“Mmnh.”\nI couldn’t tell what she was saying.\n***\n[Shael’s POV]\nEran went home.\nNormally, she’d just lie on the bed without thinking about anything and go to sleep, but for some reason she was feeling quite bored.\nShael left her room as she stretched. When she came upstairs, she met Enella Azbel, her mother.\nAs soon as Enella saw Shael, she asked, “When are you planning to marry Eran?”\n“…”\nShael couldn’t give an answer.\nShe actually wanted to say that she had carried out a scheme called ‘fake marriage’ with Eran, but… when she tried to say that she would marry someday, her mouth didn’t open that easily.\n“We can clearly see that you love Eran.”\n“…!”\nPerhaps expecting Shael’s rebuttal, Enella entered her room before Shael could even open her mouth.\nShael frowned and also headed for her room. However, in the end, Shael shook her head and moved her steps to Azbel family’s library.\n[We can clearly see that you love Eran.]\nThat was what Enella said.\n‘But, it’s obviously not true!’\nShael shook her head in denial.\nGoblin:\nThis is sponsored chapter 4 of 10, sponsored by Groggy!

      "content": "But Shael still wondered what it meant to be in love.\nHaving seen her parents, she seemed to know a little bit what it was, but… she had no knowledge of human relations at all.\nEven when other young girls enjoyed reading romance novels, she didn’t.\nSo Shael started looking for the books about love in Azbel family’s library.\nShe chose the books that seemed interesting, and returned to her room, then started reading the books.\nIt was a good time for her to read, as she was bored without her toy to relieve her stress.\nAs she thought of that, Shael, who was opening her book, frowned.\nBecause one of the lines from the book said,\nㅡ If your partner isn’t around, but you keep thinking about that person, that’s the beginning of love.\n‘Absolutely nonsense!’\nShael frowned at the page.\n‘I was just thinking about how to bully Eran.’\nAt the same time, she tore apart the page she was reading.\nShael convinced herself that the page didn’t exist in the first place.\nThen she casually flipped through the pages again.\nㅡ If you often feel worried about your partner, you may be in love with that person.\n‘Worried? I’ve felt it many times with Eran. But that was mainly due to the dessert.’\nSo Shael judged that this, too, was nonsense.\nAfter tearing the page into bits, her gaze fell on the next page.\n— Contrary to what young ladies think, if they fall in love, they tend to quarrel a lot with their partner. The more they like their partner, the more they will quarrel with them.\n— However, it is a common characteristic of love that the quarrel does not last long.\nIn Shael recalled an argument with Eran in her mind.\nAs usual, if Shael started a quarrel with Eran, he would also fight back. But most of the quarrels seem to have ended very quickly, or it ended with Shael’s defeat after falling for Eran’s temptation of dessert.\nAfter finishing her thoughts, Shael tore the page again, and pouted her lips.\nThe books she choose were always very strange. So she added restructuring of the Azbel family’s library in her list of things to do.\nShael also tried to burn the book, but she barely endured it and continued reading.\nMaybe something might come up that would be of help to her.\nShreet!\nShaelI continued to tear the pages that annoyed her.\nShe closed the book due to the fatigue.\nAt the same time, Shael held her breath. Because before she knew it, more than half of the pages had disappeared.\n“…”\nShael shook her head in denial.\n‘It’s clear that the book is wrong!’\nIf it wasn’t, there’s no way the contents of the book would overlap with Shael’s actions to this extent.\nShael turned her head to open another book.\nShael started reading, hoping that this time she would find out something meaningful.\nㅡ Don’t care about trivial disputes. If that person loves you, he too will repay you with some petty revenge.\nShael’s face hardened for a moment.\n‘This sentence…’\nShe didn’t know why, it seemed to be a situation that had happened to her and Eran every time.\nㅡ As long as it is not something that is harmful, that person will always give you the right to choose.\nShael remembered the time when she went to the cinema with Eran. He gave her the choice to pick the movie they would watch.\nNot just when it came to movies, but in everything except desserts.\nShael hated to admit it, but… dessert was indeed harmful to the body.\nShael closed the book in embarrassment.\nShe didn’t want to read any more. There were only things in the book that were confusing, not helpful at all.\nBut, in the end, Shael couldn’t erase her doubts.\nShe, of course, somehow convinced herself that her own behavior being similar to the book was just a coincidence.\nHowever, Eran’s actions, which were also similar to the contents of the book, couldn’t be easily overlooked.\n‘If the contents of the book are true… does Eran love me?’\n“That’s nonsense!”\n‘But then, why didn’t Eran break off our engagement, and why is he never seriously upset by my antics?’\nShael was curious about the reasons. Of course, she wouldn’t be able to find out about those reasons just by asking Eran.\n‘Then how can I find out?’\nThe troubled Shael jumped up from her seat, and opened a drawer.\nInside, she saw a vat of strange liquid.\nIt was something she had bought from the auction house.\n[Finally here! Obedience Tree Sap! Of course, it’s impossible to make a target do something they completely refuse to do… but you can make them do anything else!] (G: She got it at chapter 9)\n‘This is it!’\nBut the smell was just too strong. Eran, who hated bitter things, would definitely refuse to drink this tree sap.\nSo she needed a method.\nShael’s eyes flashed.\nThe villainess began to make an elaborate plan.\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "Ezran Baslett, the biological father of the body I was possessing came to meet me.\nA conversation with him was always very awkward.\n“I heard that today is Shael’s birthday.”\n“Yes, so I was preparing a present.”\nDuke Ezran nodded.\nEven when he told me about Shael’s birthday, he seemed calm. To the extent that no emotion could be found in his expression.\nIn reality, the only other family member we had was an aunt.\nIn the novel, Eran had only his father as his family. It was really sad.\n‘Someday, I’ll have to get rid of the awkward atmosphere with Duke Ezran.’\nBut before that, I had to first rehabilitate the villainess.\n* **\nShael was looking at me, but she wasn’t glaring as usual.\nThe villainess was looking at me as if she wanted something from me.\nToday was the villainess’s birthday. And I knew what the villainess would want.\nShe wanted desserts.\n“Today is my birthday.”\n“Is that so?”\nI replied as if I didn’t know, and I was doing that for a reason.\nI also had a birthday a few months ago. Of course, the villainess didn’t wish me anything.\nActually, the Shael then and Shael now had slightly different personalities, but… still, I couldn’t help but feel sad. But it was okay. Because my revenge for that had now begun.\n“I’m sure said something to you last week.”\n“Ah. I guess I didn’t hear it because I was distracted.”\nShael looked at me with a gloomy expression. Even though her mouth was closed, I could hear what she wanted to say.\n[Then what about my dessert?]\nIt looked like she was about to say that out loud.\nHowever, before Shael’s grim expression turned to anger, I pulled out a box.\nShael raised the corner of her mouth.\nThe reason was simple. Because that box was the one I usually put dessert in.\n“Ah.”\nShael quickly took the box and opened it. Then the corner of her mouth, which had been raised, went down.\nWhy? Because the things Shael was expecting was not in that box.\nActually, I did prepare a present. It’s just that I didn’t want to give it to Shael that easily, for she didn’t give me anything on my birthday.\nNo, the villainess bullied me even on my birthday. So doing this much should be just fine.\nJust like how the villainess bullied me on my birthday, I also wanted to do the same.\nShael looked into the box for a moment before opening his mouth.\n“Where is my dessert?”\nSurprisingly, Shael didn’t get angry at me. I thought that she’d glare at me as soon as she saw that the box was empty.\nThat should be enough. A good child should receive a present.\nI brought out another box which I had prepared for Shael, who still looked quite depressed.\nNo, I just showed it to her.\n“This box contains desserts.”\nBut it wouldn't be free.\nIf you receive a gift, it is only natural to express your gratitude.\n“Please say thank you.”\nActually, it’s wasn’t a good thing to force someone to express their gratitude, but… the villainess needed to be taught how to do that.\n“Thank you?” Shael immediately said.\nI couldn’t help but be surprised. Considering the character of the villainess who usually didn’t give thanks, it was very fast!\n‘Did the power of desserts reach such a level?’\n“…”\nHer words felt more forced than sincere. That alone was satisfying. If it was the same villainess from a few months ago, she would have glared at me for pulling such a prank.\nI was embarrassed, but I had no choice but to hand the box over to Shael.\n“Here you are.”\nShael happily opened the box. There were as many desserts as she wanted.\nBut it wasn’t the dessert that caught Shael’s attention.\n“Is this?”\n“That is also a gift.”\nWhat Shael took out of the box was a necklace. I chose one with a blue jewel because it matched Shael’s eyes.\n“It’s a gem that can be enchanted, so I’ll give you some enchantments that might help later.”\nAfter that, I looked at Shael and waited for her to speak.\n“Thank you.”\nI was very satisfied. The silent threat to take away the dessert worked, but still, considering the villainess’s dirty personality, it was a huge improvement.\nThut!\nShael suddenly closed the box. She didn’t eat any dessert.\n“…?”\n“Sorry, but I’ll eat it later.”\n‘She’ll eat them later?’\nI couldn’t believe it. Shael, who loved dessert so much, wanted to eat them later.\n“…?”\nAs I was expressing my doubts, Shael stood up from her seat.\nShael carefully placed the box of desserts on the table and picked up a box that was already on it.\nShael opened the box, revealing numerous wine bottles.\n“Do you like alcohol?”\n“No.”\nAs Shael said, I’ve never seen her drink any wine. Even if she had to, she only took a sip once in a while.\nSo I became curious.\nGoblin:\nThis is sponsored chapter 5 of 10, sponsored by Groggy!

      "content": "Shael must have a compelling reason if she suddenly put aside the matter of eating desserts, and wanted to drink wine.\n“Why are you suddenly interested in drinking wine?”\n“Nothing in particular.”\nBut I was sure that there must be a reason for her strange behavior. It was because Shael didn’t look at my eyes while speaking. She was dodging my gaze.\nAnyways, it won’t matter even if I drank a little. If necessary, I could use magic to get rid of the alcohol from my system.\nHowever, what Shael brought out was a very strong wine, which would be impossible to get rid of even with magic.\nHowever, I couldn’t refuse.\nToday was Shael’s birthday. I didn’t want to reject Shael’s offer.\n“Drink.”\nShael tipped the wine bottle and poured wine into my glass. The color of the wine, which looked poisonous even at a glance, came into my sight.\n“Aren’t you also going to drink?”\n“…”\n“I am feeling suspicious for some reason.”\nIt was a reasonable conjecture on my part, since there were no wine glasses placed in front of Shael.\nAs I pointed that out, Shael brought another wine glass as if she couldn’t help it.\nThis time I poured wine into her glass.\nWhat followed was silence. Because no one tried to touch their glass of wine.\n“Why aren’t you drinking?”\n“That is what I want to ask.”\nShael, whose face had hardened, acted as if something was not working out for her.\n“Then let’s drink at the same time.”\n“Yes, that’s good.”\nAfter saying that, we raised our wine glass at the same time. I even placed it on my mouth. But, the amount of wine was not reduced.\n“What is it?”\n“This time, drink for real.”\nShael really started drinking wine. I also started drinking wine along with Shael.\nMy glass was empty before I know it. Then Shael filled it up again. I also poured wine into Shael’s glass, which was empty.\nThat’s how the wine bottles piled up.\nThe first bottle, the second bottles, and finally the third bottle.\nShael suddenly asked, “Are you drunk yet?”\n“I am not drunk. And that’s what I want to ask you.”\nShael looked drunk. But it was natural, because she drank such a strong wine.\nEven I, who usually enjoyed drinking, also got a little drunk.\n“Ah, I read it in a book.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Oh, a drunk person, they don’t admit that they are drunk.”\nThat’s right. They deny it because they are drunk.\n“So, you said you weren’t drunk, so you’re drunk too?”\n“Are you drunk?”\n“No… hick… I’m not drunk. Never.”\nShe seemed quite drunk. The saying that drunk people don’t want to admit that they’re drunk was certainly a fact.\n“Then now, to the next… plan…”\n“Did you just say the word ‘plan’?”\nShael answered without hesitation.\n“Yes, the plan. It was too obvious to put in alcohol, so… I was going to take it out when you became drunk.”\n‘What kind of nonsense is this?’\nAt the same time, Shael rummaged through her pockets, and what she took out was a small bottle filled with a strange liquid.\n“Did you say you were drunk?”\n“I didn’t say that.”\n“It’s okay to be drunk from wine, so drink this.”\nOf course I would never drink that. Its smell was nasty, which also made me not want to drink it.\nIt reminded me of the advice that was written in the journal Ruelle had given me, but I didn’t think that I should drink this juice. Even with just one glance, it was clear that she wanted to torment me with the bitter taste of the juice.\nShael opened her mouth, and what she said didn’t really match our current situation.\n“I though that if I drink alcohol, I would forget about the taste of the desserts.”\n“…?”\n“So I forcibly stopped myself from eating the desserts and drank alcohol.”\n‘Is that why she didn’t eat the desserts? Is she afraid that she would forget the memories of enjoying the desserts?’\nThen that was a truly absurd reason.\n“So, quickly drink this.”\n“…”\nI received the unknown bottle from Shael.\n‘Is it juice? So what kind juice is it?’\nI didn’t know. It’s not poison, but… to be honest, I didn’t want to drink it.\n“Drink!”\n“…”\nI handed the bottle to Shael with a smile on my face.\n“If you drink first, then I will too.”\n“…”\nWhat it meant was that I wouldn’t drink unless she did.\nHowever, Shael nodded her head. It meant that Shael accepted my offer. On top of that, she added without forgetting. “Thanks for the meal.”\n“Yes?”\nShael took thee bottle from my hand before I knew it. Then she opened the cap and drank all the juice.\nIt was over before I could even stop her.\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "Shael crumpled her face. She deserved it.\nWhat Shael had just drank was the juice that smelled bad from earlier.\n“…”\n“Are you okay?”\n“No.”\nOf course, there’s no way she’d be okay after drinking that!\nHer head must also be aching from being drunk. Why did she have to drink that in the first place?\n“I’ll get you some water.”\n“Not water, that…”\nWhat Shael pointed out was the box I had given her. Was asking for the dessert.\nShe wanted to combat the bitter taste with dessert instead of water!\nI couldn’t understand her way of thinking. Anyways, I handed a cupcake to Shael.\n“Here you are.”\nShael hurriedly ate the cupcake. After some time passed, I asked her.\n“So, what was that strange liquid just now?”\nIn fact, I asked the question without expecting an answer, as Shael would never do that. No matter how drunk she was, she would instinctively refuse to answer.\nContrary to my expectations, Shael responded quickly. “Sap.”\n“I don’t know that? I meant what kind of sap was it?”\n“What more do you want?”\nShe wasn’t acting. It seemed that Shael had indeed forgotten what it was. As if she had an headache, Shael placed her hand on her head for a moment, and said, “Ah! The Obedience Tree Sap.”\n‘Obedience Tree Sap?’\nIt was a familiar name. Because I saw Shael buy it at the auction house.\nAnd now, since Shael drank it, it means that Shael has no choice but to obey my words!\nSo she will have to answer my words without lies.\n“Why did you try to feed that to me?”\n“…”\nShael seemed reluctant to answer. But she had no choice but to open her mouth due to the effect of the Obedience Tree Sap.\n“To find out if you love me.”\n“Yes?”\nAbsolutely incomprehensible words.\n‘Did she want to make me drink the Obedience Tree Sap to find out if I loved her?\nTo be honest, I felt quite embarrassed. What Shael said just now was honestly quite cringy.\n“Why did you suddenly want to know about that?”\n“I read a book, so I think you love me.”\n‘What kind of nonsense is this?’\nIt seemed that she was spouting out nonsense because she was not only under the effect of the Obedience Tree Sap, but also alcohol.\nAnyways, I questioned Shael for more information.\n“Aside from that, was there any other reason?”\n“Yes.”\nI looked at Shael in silence, waiting for an answer.\nShael replied, “To see if you are cheating on me…”\n“…”\n‘To see if I was cheating on her?’\nI frowned.\n‘What the hell kind of nonsense is this?’\nBut it wasn’t long before I noticed the problem. It was clearly because of what happened with Clie.\nNo matter how much I drew my sword in front of Clie, I couldn’t completely erase Shael’s doubts.\nWhat’s more, she had heard me and Clie communicate through the bracelet.\nSo it was necessary to tell Shael the truth.\n“I’m not cheating on you, so you don’t have to worry.”\nAt my words, Shael nodded her head. Things seemed to have settled for now.\nUnder the effect of alcohol and strange tree sap Shael’s mind seemed to be wandering in and out of reality, so I choose to remain silent for now.\nThe silence continued for a while, and I was the first to speak up.\nIt was because I wanted to retrieve the serpent orb that Shael had taken from me when I was tied up by her.\n“Give me the serpent orb that you took back.”\n“Yes.”\nShael frowned at my words. However, she had no choice but to agree due to the effects of the sap.\n“Here.”\n“Good job.”\nI activated the serpent orb, but there was no sound.\nI could easily guess the reason why. Shael must have erased her dark history from the orb.\nIt was a bit of a waste, but it didn’t matter.\n‘I mean all I have to do is record it again.’\nSo I said with an evil smile, “Since I have to record it again, would you like to tell me that you like me?”\nI felt a bit sorry for doing this to Shael, but… this is all for her own sake. Because when the villainess commits her misdeeds, I needed a way to stop her.\nIt was needed to tackle any unforeseen situations. I needed more persuading measures than just desserts.\nTo put it bluntly, I also wanted to bully Shael.\n“I like you.”\n“Good job.”\nI recorded Shael’s voice into the serpent orb with a smile.\nShe might try to steal the serpent orb again, but she doesn’t seem to realize that the situation was going against her now that she’s drunk.\nBut this was not enough.\n“Tell me that you love me too.”\n“I love you.”\nIt was also recorded in the serpent orb. As a result, the countermeasures to prevent the villainess’s evil deeds had become more solid.\nThe next course of action would be to improve the health of the villainess. Because Shael ate a lot of sweets.\nThere were many healthy herbal supplements in Shael’s room. As soon as I saw it, I laughed out loud.\nShael didn’t like herbal supplements, but she was keeping all these herbal supplements in her room, and I seemed to know why.\n“No way, did you bring them to feed me?”\nShael nodded her head. Before I could ask further, Shael spoke again,\n“I brought it to get revenge for making me take those bitter medicine the past.”\nGoblin:\nThis is sponsored chapter 5 of 10, sponsored by Groggy! (5/10)\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress. So please help if you can. No matter how small the amount, anything will help.

      "content": "“I see.”\nI made her take the medicine because I was worried about her health, but Shael wanted to make me take them because she wanted to see me suffer .\nIt was quite sad, but it was okay. Because now, it was Shael’s turn to feel the bitterness!\n“Please eat it all.”\nShael spent a long time eating the herbal supplements.\nI then said to Shael, who was eating the bitter herbs, “I don’t think the dessert I brought will be good for your health, so I’ll give it back to you later.”\nThis time, Shael opened her mouth as if to retort. It seemed that she didn’t want to lose the desserts no matter how drunk she was. However, I didn’t give her the chance to complain.\n“I will not accept objections.”\nThe effects of Obedience Tree Sap seemed to be better than I thought.\nThen time slowly passed.\nThe clock was telling me that it was time for me to go.\nAfter confirming that, I said to Shael, who was obediently sitting on the chair.\n“Please accompany me to the hallway.”\nOriginally, she would never agree to do that, but Shael had no choice but to obey.\nAfter that, Shael and I walked to the front door of the Azbel family’s mansion..\nJust as I was about to tell Shael to go back to her room, Duke Jespen appeared.\n“…!”\nDuke Jespen opened his mouth in amazement.\nIt was a natural reaction. Because Shael had never accompanied me to the front door before.\nAt the same time, Duke Jespen joked, “Shael, since you accompanied Eran all the way here…”\nI sensed something! It was something very ominous! And that ominous feeling proved to be right.\n“… then how about you give him a hug?”\nAs soon as she heard those words, Shael hugged me!\nShe did that before I could even dodge it.\n“…!”\nDuke Jespen looked at the scene in awe. It was the same for the maids who were not far away.\nSigh… it looks like another rumor was going to spread again in the Azbel territory.\n***\n[Shael’s POV]\nShael hurried back to her room. She had to stay away from people for a while because of that darned Obedience Tree Sap. It would be a disaster if she were to meet someone in the state she was in.\nShe was able to do that because her drunkenness was gone from what happened just before, and now she was able to make normal judgments.\n“Haah!”\nShael let out a sigh after she was finally left alone.\n‘I did something stupid.’\nShe even let her damn fiancé acquire her weakness!\nSuddenly Shael’s eyes fell on the honey water and dessert box placed on her table.\nEarlier, Eran had left for a while and went to the bathroom. It was clear that he had brought the honey water for her at that time.\nHe said that he would also take away the dessert, but fortunately he seemed to have left it behind.\n[It will help with your hangover, so please drink it.]\nHe even left a note.\nShael drank the honey water. She actually didn’t want to drink it, but she had to do it because of the Obedience Tree Sap.\nAt the same time, looked at Eran’s note and thought,\n‘What is this all about?’\nIt was because of Eran.\nWhen it came to Eran, she was doing the actions that were listed in the book.\n‘It’s not fair!’\nShe didn’t achieve her goal after all the dinking and Eran’s even made her say strange things.\nShael recalled what happened just before. She remembered the things Eran made her say.\n[I like you.]\n[I love you.]\nHe made him say those words. He even recorded them with the serpent orb that Shael had previously taken from him. And that wasn’t the end!\n[Shael, since you accompanied Eran all the way here, then how about you give him a hug?]\nAfter thinking Duke Jespen’s words, Shael let out a sigh.\nThe Obedience Tree Sap reacted to his words, and she hugged Eran.\nShael’s face turned red with shame, when she recalled the scene in her head.\n‘I will never forget today’s disgrace!’\nShael vowed that she would get her revenge…somehow.\nAnd then, something suddenly came to Shael’s mind. It was one of the characteristics of the Obedience Tree Sap that Shael had just drank.\n[Finally here! Obedience Tree Sap! Of course, it’s impossible to make a target do something they completely refuse to do… but you can make them do anything else!]\n“…”\nEven though she didn’t have a good memory, but she remembered that explanation very clearly.\n‘It’s impossible to make a target do something they completely refuse to do?’\n[I like you.]\n[I love you.]\nThen what about those things she had said before?\nDid that mean that she didn’t say those things purely under the effects of the Obedience Tree Sap?\nAt the same time, she remembered what was written on all the torn pages of the books she had read before. A lot of things from those books overlapped with Shael’s actions.\nShael shook her head to get rid of her thoughts, and she lay down on her bed. Then she said to herself,\n‘I’m tired now, so it’s normal that I’m having such strange thoughts.’\nShael hugged the doll that she had always kept next to her as a habit. However, Shael suddenly jolted awake and had no choice but to shake off the doll she was hugging.\n‘This is also the doll Eran gave me!’\nThat damn fiancé of hers had deeply infiltrated her life before she knew it!\nShael couldn’t even fathom how deep he had gotten.\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "The next day, I came to Shael’s room as usual. But I found Shael glaring at me, for no reason at all.\nWell, I guess there might be a reason, considering what happened yesterday.\nFirst of all, I asked Shael with an embarrassed face, “Why are you doing that?”\n“Are you pretending that you don’t know?”\nI went silent.\nCertainly, it was true that I went a bit too far yesterday. I ordered Shael, who had no choice but to obey my words due to the effect of that strange tree sap, to say some strange words which I recorded in the serpent orb.\nBut I was confident that it wasn’t me who was the one at fault. It was Shael who attempted to make me drink that strange sap first, and it wasn’t like I forced her to drink it.\n“Now, return the serpent orb.”\n“I don’t want to.”\nShael didn’t give up easily despite my rejection. Well, it was natural, considering that her dark history was recorded there.\nTherefore, I decided to launch a counter attack!\n“Come to think of it, I remember why you tried to make me drink the Obedience Tree Sap.”\n“…”\n“You said you did it because you wanted to know if I liked you.”\nShael went silent for a moment. I mean, I would have shut up in shame as well if I was in her shoes.\nThen Shael broke the silence, “Because of the alcohol, I don’t remember what happened yesterday.”\nThat must be a lie. Just a moment ago, she had been glaring at me and demanding that I return the serpent orb.\n“I don’t even know anything about this Obedience Tree Sap you mentioned just now.”\nShael was acting as if she had forgotten about even the Obedience Tree Sap she was trying to make me drink.\nThat must be a lie too.\nHer face stiffened and her eyes avoided my gaze. Shael habit of telling lies was showing on her face. This time, that habit became more prominent.\n“You don’t remember anything except the wine you drank.”\nShael nodded her head.\nIt was honestly a bit pathetic, considering that her acting was not good enough. So I decided to torment Shael to the fullest.\n“Did you know that when you get drunk, you tell your true feelings?”\n“Why are you saying that all of a sudden?”\nI sent her a teasing glance and said, “You begged me not to cheat on you.”\n“I didn’t say that.”\nStill, Shael continued with her bad acting.\nSuch an act made me laugh under my breath. Still, I continued my attack while barely holding back my laughter, “Then do you remember what you said after that?”\n“…”\nShael shook her head.\nAnother lie? Then prepare for the next attack!\nThis time, I wanted to completely destroy the villainess’s bad acting with solid evidence!\n[I like you.]\n[I love you.]\nIt was Shael’s voice which originated from the serpent orb. At that, Shael made a puzzled expression again.\nShe was acting as if she really couldn’t remember. She showed an amazing acting skill that was different from just before.\n“No way, are you going to deny even this?”\n“There is no way I would say something like that. Please give return the serpent orb to me.”\nShe was acting shameless even in front of solid evidence!\nI was astounded by the level of shamelessness she could reach.\nNow, even I began to wonder if she had really forgot.\n***\n[Shael’s POV]\nThe day after drinking alcohol with Eran.\nShael sat up on her bed while clutching her throbbing head.\n‘Something happened yesterday…’\nShe drank with Eran, and she also remembered that she did it to make Eran drink the Obedience Tree Sap.\n‘And what did I do after that…’\n[So, drink it quickly.]\nShe handed over the Obedience Tree Sap to Eran. Eran received it. And if everything went according to her plan he would have drank it.\n‘Of course that didn’t happen.’\nShael was convinced of that, and began to mull over the events that followed after. But no matter how much she thought about it, she couldn’t remember anything.\nShael got up from her bed and started looking for the serpent orb. After feeding Eran the Obedience Tree Sap, she wanted to record all of Eran’s words with the serpent orb.\nHowever, the serpent orb were nowhere to be seen!\n“Ah!”\nIt was then that a memory popped into Shael’s mind.\nIn that memory she was handing the serpent orb to Eran.\nShe must have fallen for Eran’s ticks after getting drunk and had the serpent orb taken away.\nIf she had been successful in making Eran drink the Obedience Tree Sap, she would have been able to get it back, but that would be impossible.\nBecause Shael at that time was drunk and not in a normal state of mind.\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

She didn’t do anything well, and she foolishly wasted that good opportunity.\n‘No, actually, there was only one thing I remember.’\n[I’m not cheating on you, so you don’t have to worry.]\nBut that was all. It must have been what Eran said after drinking the Obedience Tree Sap, so it was a harvest in its own way, but that result that was not enough for the utilization of the Obedience Tree Sap.\nAt that time, Eran said to Shael. “You begged me not to cheat on you.”\n“I didn’t say that.”\n‘Obviously, I wouldn’t have!’\nEran looked at Shael, who was in agony and laughed.\nIt was next that Eran took out the serpent orb with a slight smile.\n[I like you.]\n[I love you.]\nShael hear her own voice coming from the serpent orb.\nUntil yesterday, that serpent orb had belonged to her. In other words, those words from the serpent orb were recorded during she was drinking with Eran yesterday.\nAnd serpent orb couldn’t be manipulated.\n“…”\nShael couldn’t help but panic. She didn’t know why she said those words.\nNo matter how drunk she was, there’s no way Shael would say such embarrassing words!\nSo she just kept denying it.\nAt the same time, she convinced herself that she only said that because she was drunk at that time and wasn’t in a normal state of mind..\n***\nAnd again the next day.\nShael woke up feeling tired. She couldn’t sleep, recalling the conversation she had with Eran after drinking the Tree of Obedience.\nBut no matter how much she thought about it, she couldn’t come up with an answer, and her head kept throbbing.\nThere was no harvest despite all the hard work.\nAnd, just as Shael was about to give up trying to recall what happened, a memory popped into her head.\nA memory where she was hugging Eran began to emerge in Shael’s mind in detail.\nShael shook her head and tried to clear her thoughts, but even that was no use.\nShe remembered the feeling of burying her face in Eran’s chest!\nIt was too vivid a memory to be an illusion.\n“Wh… why!”\n‘Why the hell would I do that?’\nNot only that. It was the same for the things recorded in the serpent orb. She had done something she would never do.\nShe hated to believe it, but Eran said that she even begged Eran not to cheat on her.\nThen, Eran’s words came to Shael’s mind again.\nIt was as if Eran was by her side, [Did you know that when you get drunk, you tell your true feelings?]\nIt was also something she had read in a book.\nSoon, Shael shook her head.\nShe vowed that the next time she went to Azbel family’s library again, she would tear up the pages of that book as well.\nShael finished her preparations and looked at her watch.\nEran would come early today.\nShe had woken up late, and the clock pointed to the time Eran was supposed to come.\n“…”\nBut Eran didn’t come. Even though the time for Eran to come had already passed.\nTo be honest, only a little bit of time had passed, but to Shael, the difference was significant.\nShael again convinced herself, ‘I am feeling this way because I have no one to bully. I am looking forward to it because I am bored.’\n‘It’s obvious. There is no other reason than that.’\nKikiiik!\nHearing the sound of the door being opened, Shael spoke without even looking at the door.\nBecause it was obvious who had came in.\n“You’re late!” Shael said in a dissatisfied tone.\nNormally, some lame excuse would have come back as the answer.\nBut this time it was different.\n“Eran can’t come today.”\nWhat she heard wasn’t Eran’s voice full of excuses. It was Duke Jespen’s voice.\nShael reflexively opened her mouth to ask, “Why?”\n“He seems to be suffering from a high fever. He told me he might not be able to come tomorrow as well.”\n‘Is Eran suffering from a high fever?’\nShael immediately stood up from her seat.\nIn her head, she thought back to the words the Azbel family physician had said to her in the past. (G: in chapter 36 part 2)\n[First of all, the patient’s body will get weak… and they’ll sleep a lot. When things get worse, they’ll have a really bad fever.]\n[After suffering a fever, they’d get strangely healthy.]\nAnd after that.\n[And die within a week.]\nA trial she had thought would never come, was finally here.",

      "content": "Shuuuuat!\nThe sword I swung cut through the air. It was nice to hear that sound, but I wasn’t satisfied.\nDuke Ezran, who was watching me from the side, also shook his head as if he was not satisfied.\n“I don’t understand what to do.”\n“Create a mental image, then project it on the sword.”\nIt sounded easy when he said that. But…\n‘“Create a mental image, then project it on the sword? I don’t know what the heck that means!’\nFirst of all, I tried to do as I was advised, I created a mental image, and at the same time, I swung my sword.\nShuuuuat!\nBut the result was the same. And the subsequent attempts gave similar results.\n‘I have to succeed quickly!’\nThe reason I was trying so hard, was because I wanted to imbue Aura into the sword.\nAs it was in the case of all fantasy novels, there was something called ‘Aura’ in this novel as well.\nOf course, if you master it, you would become stronger.\nAfter confirming my powerlessness during the encounter with Clie, I felt like I also needed to improve, so I increased the intensity of training.\nHowever, I couldn’t feel Aura at all. So, I asked Duke Ezran, who was now standing next to me.\n“Could you give me a demonstration?”\n“I can’t.”\n“…”\nDuke Ezran walked away after saying that. There was no way that the duke, who was a master swordsman couldn’t unleash his Aura!\nIn the original novel, Eran Baslett, whom I possessed, had also learned how to use Aura at a young age.\nBut, I didn’t resent Duke Ezran.\nDuke Ezran was always emotionless, and he didn’t even ask me why I wasn’t able to use my Aura all of a sudden.\nI couldn’t understand why he didn’t.\nI couldn’t even guess the reason for the perpetual gloomy expression on his face. The original novel didn’t deal with Duke Ezran that much, so it was quite hard for me to see through him.\nMaybe he wasn’t interested in the existence of Eran Baslett. Or, maybe Duke Ezran wasn’t interested in anything in general.\nAnyways, that wasn’t what mattered now. My priority was to somehow develop my own power.\nShuuuat! Shuuuat! Shuuuat!\nThat night was filled with the sound of my sword cutting through the cold wind.\nAnd then, I ended up catching a cold.\n***\n“…?”\nI had no choice but to open my eyes that were about to close due to the fatigue. It was because someone had broken into my room!\n“Shael?”\nIt was Shael. She sat down on the chair in front of my bed, and looked at me as if she was observing me.\nI was going to rest at home today instead of going to the Azbel family. But, she came here instead.\n“Why are you here?”\n“You’re my fiancé, can’t I come over?”\n‘You are a selfish villainess who is my betrothed only in name.’\nI laughed and told Shael, “You may catch a cold.”\n“It’s okay. I am not a weakling.”\n‘Does that mean I’m a weakling?’\nThat’s not something anyone should say to a sick person.\nHowever, I didn’t counter attack due to being preoccupied with another thought.\n‘Why did she come all the way here?’\nIf it was the Shael from a few months ago, she wouldn’t have cared if I was sick.\n‘Could it be because of the dessert?’\nThe dessert I gave her yesterday might not have been enough.\nIf something happened to me, Shael would never get to eat my dessert.\nTo be honest, it was a very insignificant reason, but it was possible because Shael liked desserts so much.\n“No way, did you come because you were worried about me?”\n“…No, go to sleep.”\nSo that didn’t seemed to be the case. As I expected, it seemed that she came because of the dessert.\nI felt a bit angry when I thought of that reason, and at the same time, I was feeling quite bored, so I decided to make fun of Shael.\n“Cough!”\nI deliberately made a loud coughing sound. So that Shael wouldn’t be able to ignore it.\n“…!”\n“Water, some water…”\nNormally, this request would have been casually ignored. But as soon as Shael heard this, she hurriedly left the room. It was clear that she went to fetch water as I requested.\n‘Is this really alright?’\nMy conscience was pricked, but I felt good when I thought that the cold Shael would accept my request so easily. It gave me feel like I had conquered her.\nKikiiik!\nShael entered the room carrying water.\nEven though she had a frown on her face, she still brought the water!\n‘Does she want to eat dessert for the rest of her life that much?’\nI didn’t know. Either way, it was a good thing for me.\n“Drink.”\n“I can’t move my hand.”\nThere was no way a cold would render your hands unusable, so I was spouting total nonsense.\nOf course, Shael, who was in a hurry, didn’t doubt it.\nAs I gazed at the water eagerly, Shael brought the cup directly to my mouth for me to drink.\nThe feeling of having everything done for me… felt quite good.\nAt this point, I was finally able to understand why Clie kept intentionally coughing in front of the male leads.\n“Thank you.”\n“…”\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "I didn’t forget to say thank you.\n‘Now, what should I do next?’\nAs I was thinking that, something good caught my eye.\n“I want something sweet.”\nI said while I glanced at the box on the table in the middle of the room.\nFollowing my gaze, Shael brought the box and started taking out the desserts.\n“Please feed me.”\n“…”\nEarlier, Shael brought me water without any objections, but this time, she looked at me with her eyes full of suspicion.\nWell, it was a fact that someone’s body wouldn’t suddenly stop functioning just because they had a cold.\nShael picked up a dessert and stretched out her hand towards my mouth, “Here.”\n“I want to eat that too.”\nWhat I pointed out with my eyes was a cupcake. It was something Shael liked the most among my desserts.\nShael looked at the cupcake as if she wanted to eat it, but she fed it to me in the end, “Here…”\n“As expected, this is the most delicious!”\nI didn’t forget to give a proper evaluation to Shael, who was eagerly looking at the cupcakes.\nSome time passed, and the desserts were now completely gone. I ate so much that my stomach started to hurt. I didn’t even leave a single dessert for Shael.\n“I need to walk for a while.” With those words, I got out of bed\n“…?” Shael just tilted her head in bewilderment.\n“Aren’t you coming?”\n“But you said you couldn't even move your hands!”\nIn fact, I didn’t expect that she would really believe that lie. It’s not like I’ve got some kind of fatal disease.\n“After eating the sweets, I suddenly gained strength.”\n“…”\nI just gave Shael an absurd excuse, then I left my room while ignoring the silent Shael.\nThen Shael had no choice but to follow me, “You look quite energetic.”\n“It’s because my condition has improved a lot.”\nActually, even when I was in bad shape, it didn’t hurt that much. I decided to rest at home because I was a little tired and I was afraid that I would pass on the cold to Shael.\nNow that Shael had come to visit, all of that didn’t matter anymore.\n“I’m feeling much better now, so I’ll be fine.” I said while I walked down the aisle with Shael.\nAnd, while passing through the corridors of Baslete Estate, Shael pointed to something and asked, “What’s that?”\n“That is an heirloom.”\nIt was a piece of paper that had various protective magic circles intertwined around it. It was do dense that you couldn’t even see the contents.\n“What kind of paper is it?”\n“I don’t know.”\nI did ask Duke Ezran once. But, I didn’t get an answer. I only got a cold rejection as a response.\nI guessed that it was some secret swordsmanship manual belonging to the family, but I couldn’t bear to ask for it. Because I couldn’t even use my Aura.\nIt’s been over half a year since I had come to this world, but I still couldn’t master it.\nWhen we passed by the heirloom and left the Baslett family’s mansion.\nShael asked me, “So where are we going?”\n“There is a place that I like.”\nWe walked towards the garden of Baslett Estate. Then I went deep into the garden with Shael.\n“Why are we coming here all of a sudden?”\n“We are here.”\nDense trees stretching all the way to the sky. And the flowers and grass filled the surroundings with a warm atmosphere.\nIt was like a secret hiding place. It was a helpful place for me, who hated walking around the Baslett family’s mansion because of the somber atmosphere.\nThe chair in the middle was big enough for Shael and me to sit together.\n“Isn’t this a great place?”\n“I guess so.”\nIt was so beautiful that even Shael couldn’t deny it.\nWe remained silent for a while and soaked in the peaceful atmosphere.\nIt was a place that gave me new emotions every time I came here. I didn’t know why, but I found it even better now that Shael was here with me.\nAfter that long silence, I spoke to Shael, “Tomorrow I will go to the Azbel Estate, so you don’t have to come here.”\n“No.”\n‘You don’t even want to meet me anymore?’\nHowever, what Shael said next was quite unexpected.\n“I’ll be back tomorrow too.”\nShael said that she would come, and she said it quite readily. Maybe the pretending to be sick today had a bigger effect than I had thought.\n“And…”\nI continued admiring the scenery and waited for what she wanted to say.\nAfter thinking for a moment, Shael opened her mouth again.\n“If you die…”\nWhat came out of her mouth was quite brutal…\nTaking my eyes off the tree, I had no choice but to focus my attention on her.\n“…I will kill you.”\n‘If I die, she will kill me?’\nIt was a contradictory and brutal statement.\n‘Is it because she thinks that I am sick?’\nI couldn’t hide my laugh and said to Shael, “Yes. If so, I can’t die, because I am afraid of you.”\nIt was the only answer I could give to the villainess’s cute threat.\nGoblin:\nThis is sponsored chapter 8 of 10, sponsored by Groggy!

      "content": "Kikiiik!\nShael entered her room without knocking.\nUnlike the usual, where I had to go to the Azbel family, Shael came to the Baslett family instead, just as she had promised yesterday.\n“You are late.”\n“I’m not late.”\nWe exchanged similar words as before, only our roles had reversed.\n“What would you like to do today?”\n“What about the body?”\nShe replied my question with a completely different question.\n‘She must think that I am still suffering from the cold…’\nOf course, I was completely healthy. It was a common cold at best, it wasn’t enough to weaken the body of a swordsman.\n“I’m fine now.”\n“…”\nAt my words, Shael lowered her head to confirm if I was really healthy.\nIt seemed that she didn’t believe me.\nNow that was quite hurtful! She didn’t trust me at all even though we’ve been together for a few months now.\nTherefore, I decided to bully Shael to my heart’s content today.\n“Let’s go.”\n“Don’t go out. Wear this and go to sleep.”\nWith those words, Shael handed me an air purifying magic tool.\nI don’t know why she did, but she kept ignoring me afterwords.\n“If you are not going out, I will go out alone.”\n“…”\nShael’s primary goal was my dessert. So she had no choice but to follow me.\nAfter a short preparation, we left the Baslett family’s mansion and walked around the Baslett territory. To be honest, I didn’t want to come here with Shael. It would’ve been better to walk around the Azbel territory, which was much richer overall.\nOf course, that didn’t mean that the streets of Baslett territory were not attractive.\nNow that I thought about it, there were many unique sights which could only be seen here.\n“Where are we going?”\nWhere? I wasn’t sure either. I couldn’t find a new place to visit. It was because there were so many places I visited with Shael these days.\n“Today I just want to wander around aimlessly.”\n“Okay, then.”\nI was about to enter an alleyway with Shael, but someone shouted from behind.\n“Hey, youngsters!”\nShael and I were dressed in the usual nobleman’s clothes. So there was no way someone could’ve carelessly shouted at us, but contrary to my expectations, it was an old man who seemed to be a fortune teller.\n“What?”\n“…”\nThere’s no way Shael would like this. It’d be a problem if it upset Shael, so I needed to leave quickly.\n“I see a death in the near future!”\n‘Haah? There he goes with his nonsense…’\nI let out a sigh and spoke to the old man. “I’m not interested, so I’ll be leaving.”\n“More, tell me more.”\nSurprisingly Shael showed interest in the fortuneteller’s nonsense.\nThat Shael, who was rude to the extreme, was politely talking to this fortuneteller!\nIt left me speechless.\nI, on the other hand, came from a modern era, so I didn’t believe in the fortuneteller’s nonsense.\n‘How can she be fooled by such things so easily?’\nI couldn’t understand. No matter how stupid Shael was, she seemed to be quick-witted when it came to things like this.\nI had no choice but to remain silent and listen to the conversation between Shael and the fortuneteller.\n“In one week. No, maybe that death will come sooner.”\n“In the near future or within a week?”\nI wanted to tell Shael that it was better not to believe in these things, but this was indeed a rare chace to see Shael embarrass herself, so I put it off for the moment.\n“Is there any way to escape that death?”\n“To be honest, it is impossible.”\nThe old man took a deep breath, and opened his mouth, “But there is one way to avoid it.”\n“What is that?”\n“I can’t say it because it might ruin that possibility.”\nShael glared at the fortuneteller.\nI couldn’t help but laugh. The fortuneteller was asking for money.\nI paid for Shael, who was waiting for the fortuneteller’s words.\n“Tell me.”\n“Looks like that man has a way out of this.”\n“…?”\nAt the fortuneteller’s words, Shael looked back at me.\n‘Did she really believe this bullsh*t? Did she become a fool instead of a villainess?’\n“By the way…”\nAt those words, Shael looked at the fortuneteller. She was showing absolute trust in the word of this old man.\n“Are you guys in a relationship?”\n“No. There is no relationship.” That’s what Shael said.\nI felt it was wrong and corrected it, “We are getting married soon.”\nIt was true, since we were already engaged.\nSince Shael was speaking politely, I did the same as well.\nShael glared at me for a moment, but thanks to the fortuneteller’s next word, I was able to easily get away with it.\n“Then, how about drawing out these cards?”\nAt the same time, the old man held out a card.\nAnd, Shael suddenly pulled out a card with a concerned expression.\n“What does this mean?”\n“You’ll know later. So you’d better be on your way.”\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress. So please help if you can.

      "content": "‘Did I hear it wrong?’\n“Did you just say that?”\nShael nodded her head.\nI couldn’t believe it was real. No, it didn’t feel like it was real, because it was such an unrealistic answer.\n“Are you going to go back on what you said?”\n“…”\nShe was even provoking me!\nBut I wasn’t so impatient as to succumb to the provocation. To be honest, marriage couldn’t be that simple.\n“It was a joke.”\n“It wasn’t for me.”\nShael still continued to attack me. At this point, I has many doubts. If someone really wanted to get married, don’t they usually do it with an excited expression on their face?\nBut not Shael. On the contrary, she had the usual devilish smile on her face.\n‘Is she trying to make fun of me?’\nIt was clear as day that she was! Otherwise, there’s no way she’d take a joke so seriously.\nTherefore, I decided to change my tactic.\n“Okay, let’s do it. Let’s get married. Should I tell the Duke right away tomorrow?”\nIf I go this far, Shael would surely be embarrassed and she would have no choice but to reject it. But the villainess’s way of thinking was beyond my imagination.\n“No, I should tell him today.”\n“…”\nI felt that something was going terribly wrong. Shael wasn’t joking at all!\nAlthough her intention seemed quite suspicious.\n“No. Because it was a joke, of course.”\n“Why do you keep changing your words?”\nTo be honest, I had nothing to say to that. It was because I had been in the wrong the moment I said that unfortunate joke. So I saw no need for shabby excuses.\n“Do you like me?” I threw a huge curveball at Shael. And the effect was great as well.\n“Now, what are yo…”\n“Otherwise, there’s no reason to take such a joke seriously, is there?”\n“…”\nOf course, Shael couldn’t answer my words. There must have been some kind of despicable reason for that.\nThat’s how the matter came to an end. Without saying a word, I took Shael and walked down the alleys of Baslett Street.\nAt last the clock pointed at the time I wanted. So I changed my aimless steps and headed somewhere.\n“Where are you going?”\n“I heard there is a festival nearby.”\nI wanted to make our time at the Baslett family as enjoyable as possible, so I knew where to go in advance. It just happened to be that a festival would be held at another territory next to the Baslett territory.\n“Pleorin family is famous for their fireworks.”\n“Pleorin?”\nShael, who had no social skills, didn’t seem to know about other families.\nAs I continued chatting with Shael in the Baslett family’s carriage, we arrived at Pleorin’s estate before I knew it.\nThe place was crowded with people. Shael and I wore plain clothes that we had prepared in advance, so we were able to go unnoticed.\n“We still have a little time before the fireworks display.”\nThat didn’t mean there were no others spectacles. Since there would be a lot of people, of course, it also attracted the attention of merchants. So there were a lot of different kinds of stalls.\n“Let’s go over there.”\nThe place we went to had all kinds of scrolls for enchantments.\n“I think I can use some of these on the necklace you gave you for my birthday.”\n“Yes.”\nThe Azbel family was sure to have much better magic scrolls, but… I didn’t want to disappoint Shael, who was full of expectations.\n“What is this?”\n“Ah, it’s a protection-type scroll!”\nAs soon as Shael heard the merchant’s explanation, she pointed to another scroll. However, we couldn’t find the scroll Shael wanted.\nThese were mere street stalls, so it was natural that there wouldn’t be many scrolls that would meet Shael’s expectations.\n“I’ll take this one.”\n“Yes, thank you!”\nShael quickly bought one of the scrolls and used it on her necklace. That scroll was a tracking-type scroll.\nThen Shael looked at me. It meant that she wanted to designate me as the target to the tracking.\n“What the hell are you going to do with a tracking magic?”\n“You can’t refuse.”\nIt seemed that I had no choice but to accept it. A lot of money disappeared due to an insignificant scroll.\nNow Shael would know my location at all times.\nAfter simply filling our stomach, I looked at my watch. It was time for the main attraction.\nA small firecracker exploded in the air.\nJust when everyone focused their attention, the head of the Pleorin family came up to the building located high up. Then he began to speak loudly, using sound amplification magic.\n“Thank you for visiting the Fireworks Festival in the Pleorin Territory! After the small ceremony following my speech, the real fireworks show will begin.”\nIt was quite different from the original festival. From what I know, the fireworks would have started as soon as the speech was over.\nLord Pleorin continued, “Isn’t it boring to have an event that just repeats itself every time? So I prepared something special for the couples who came to see the fireworks this time.”\nAt the same time, a butler next to Lord Pleorin removed a curtain, revealing a very large jewel!\nIt was a jewel whose size was comparable to that of an elephant.\n“Can you see it!? It is a truly stunning gem. But that’s not all that makes this gem special.”\nLord Pleorin touched the jewel, but there was no response.\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "Next, Lady Pleorin also put her hands on the gemstone.\nThen the gemstone vibrated and emitted a weak light.\n“I think there are people who has already guessed it. You’re right! It is a gemstone that shines and vibrates the more we think about each other.”\nIt was truly a gemstone for lovers.\nHowever, just because you think about each other a lot, doesn’t mean that you’re in love. So what’s the use of doing this?\nAnyway, considering the gemstones size, it was obvious that the Lord Pleorin had made a huge investment in it.\nTo make the next festival overflowing with crowds, they must be investing endlessly. Even the item the Lord took out as a reward was also something quite rare.\n“A pair of exclusive rings of restriction will be given to the pair who will be able to make the gemstone shine the brightest!”\nIt really was a precious item, but, I didn’t know if that really was a good thing. It was a ring that had appeared in the original novel, so I know it well.\nIf you put it on your partner, that ring had the ability to restrict you from talking to people of the opposite gender, excluding the person wearing the other ring and blood relatives.\nTo be honest, there was nothing but loss if you wear it. Once you put it on, you can only take it out with your lover’s permission.\n“Can I buy that ring with money?” Shael said with shining eyes.\n“Let’s just participate.”\nI had no choice but to participate. Most importantly, I didn’t even think that we would be able to win against other couples in the first place.\nThe competition started like that. And before I knew it, it was Shael and my turn.\n“Wow!!!”\nThe lovers that went ahead of us put their hands on gemstone. The gemstone then began to emit an intense light. The most intense light I had ever seen.\nSeeing that, I became convinced. So I told Shael, who had high expectations.\n“We can’t win.”\n“…”\nShael and I stood in front of the gemstone. Anticipating the obvious outcome, I put my hand on the gemstone.\nWooooo!!\nUnexpectedly, the gemstone shined and resonated more extensively than ever before. But, I couldn’t help but feel despair.\n“…”\nIt was true that I usually thought a lot about Shael, but… did this even make sense?\n‘I’m sure Shael doesn’t think much of me, right?’\n“Amazing…” The Lord Pleorin, who was speechless for a moment, opened his mouth “They think of each other even when they sleep! It seems that the owners of the rings has been decided!”\nAs expected, something was wrong with this thing!\nBut the event was over before I knew it, and, the owners of the rings of restriction was decided.\n“Please wear it.”\n“…”\nShael was already wearing the other one. After thinking about it for a while, I had no choice but to wear the ring.\n‘Is this really alright?’\nI didn’t know. After all, my future was already assured. So, maybe it will be just fine.\n***\n[Shael’s POV]\nIt’s been three days since Shael went to the fireworks festival in the Pleorin Territory with Eran .\nAs time passed, Shael’s mood gradually got weirder. It was because Eran would die in a few days time, just as the physician had predicted.\n‘No, maybe faster.’\nJust as the fortune teller had said.\n[I see a death in the near future!]\nThe physician's advice and the fortune teller’s words didn’t leave Shael’s head.\n[In one week. No, maybe that death will come sooner.]\nAs she hugged the doll Eran gave him, Shael thought, ‘From now on, I won’t be able to eat those desserts.’\nThat should’ve been all. It was just some dessert.\nNo, actually, dessert were really important, but… just because Eran didn’t exist didn’t mean she couldn’t eat dessert.\n‘I can also receive a dessert recipes from Eran through blackmail.’\nBut Shael couldn’t do that.\n[Leave a dessert recipe as your dying will.]\nShael couldn’t even imaging saying such shameless words. Maybe the Shael from a few months ago would have no problem saying it, but not her current self.\n“…”\nShael erased the complicated thoughts in her head. This was all happening because Eran, who was her stress reliever, didn’t come.\nSo Eran was bad!\n‘I still have to wait for another hour or so…’\nShael felt annoyed and buried her face in her doll.\nBut that was only for a moment.\nShael suddenly felt a strange sensation. She felt like she heard the sound of something brake in the mansion.\nThe Azbel family’s mansion was protected by all sorts of magic, there was no way that an assailant could’ve get past them.\nIn the first place, Duke Jespen was present in the mansion, as well as the other great mages. So Shael continued to listen.\nThen, little by little, she heard the screams of the maids.\nIt was clear that something was wrong. What was even more strange was that no one was coming to protect Shael.\nIf there was a danger to the mansion, the most important thing to protect in the Azbel family was Shael. So, this was a really strange thing.\n“…?”\nShortly, Shael got up from her seat and looked for Duke Jespen’s magic circle surrounding the mansion.\nThe magic circle that Duke Jespen had put the most effort into making was now shattered!\nIt could mean only one thing.\nSomeone had broken the magic circle. And if they had that level of skill, they would be a great powerhouse.\nShael left her room holding the doll Eran gave her.\nShe couldn’t feel holy power that well. But the holy power enveloping the Azbel Mansion was powerful enough for even Shael to notice.\nGoblin:\nThis is sponsored chapter 9 of 10, sponsored by Groggy!

      "content": "Morning.\nI was doing my swordsmanship training as usual. It was indeed quite pleasant to take a break after a grueling day.\nThe only problem was… Duke Ezran was standing right in front of me.\n“Did you master the Aura yet?”\n“I think it will take some more time.”\nA moment of silence. I thought the awkward atmosphere would continue… but, it was Duke Ezran who broke the silence.\n“Did you say you were curious about our family heirloom?”\nThe heirloom.\nStrangely enough, there were not many things that could be considered as heirlooms in the Baslett family. To the point where I was curious about the prestige of the duchy.\nAnd, one of them was the paper I saw in the hallway of the mansion with Shael. What Duke Ezran was referring to now must also be that paper.\n“Yes, I am curious.”\nBut, what Duke Ezran said in response was absurd, “You must have heard of the Demon King.”\n“…?”\n‘Why is he suddenly talking about that?’\nWhile thinking that I nodded my head.\n“The Demon King exists.”\n‘I see.’\nI didn’t quite understand what that had to do with heirloom.\nDuke Ezran continued with his characteristic expressionless face, “I hope that answers your question.”\n“…”\n‘How is that considered an answer?’\nI couldn’t continue to ask because of the gloomy atmosphere.\nAfter that, the awkward atmosphere continued.\n***\nAfter the conversation with Duke Ezran, I prepared to go to the Azbel family. Thanks to finishing my training earlier than usual, I would have more time to play with Shael.\nAnd soon, I could even see the Azbel family’s mansion. However, I couldn’t help but doubt my eyes.\n“…!”\nBecause I could feel the strong holy power that could be felt even from a distance!\nAs soon as I confirmed that, I ran at full speed. At the same time, I couldn’t help but gasp.\nOf course, there were many mages in the Azbel family, which was a famous family of mages.\nHowever, at the moment, all of those mages were lying unconscious on the ground. It was the same with the servants belonging to the Azbel family.\nFortunately, they were still breathing. However, the person who attacked them must have entered the Azbel family’s mansion already.\n“Fu*k!”\nIt was obvious who had attacked them. The holy power that hovered over the bodies of mages was entirely different from normal holy power. It was potent to an absurd degree!\nIt was because Clie who possessed that power defied all common sense.\nAnd with that conclusion, I took something out of my magic pouch.\nIt was Clie’s bracelet. If I can destroy it, I should be able to make Clie’s holy power disappear.\nWith that thought in mind, I struck at it with my sword.\nKaaang! Kaaang!\nHowever, even if I tried to hit it with all my strength, it didn’t even leave scratch!\nI was about to try some more, but…\n‘It’s impossible, so don’t bother trying.’\nI heard Clie’s voice from the bracelet.\nCertainly, it seemed quite impossible for me to destroy it.\nBut I was still doubtful.\nEven though I wouldn’t be able to do it right now… that didn’t mean that the bracelet couldn’t be destroyed.\nAlso, I couldn’t figure out Clie’s intentions. There was no reason for Clie to give me her fatal weakness.\nAnyways, I didn’t have the time to stop for a chat for now, so I put the bracelet wrapped in dense holy power back into the magic pouch, and quickly entered the Azbel family’s mansion.\nI had to let out another gasp. Because the fierce and strong magic circle from Duke Jespen had disappeared!\nKooung!\nIntense sounds of clashes were coming from upstairs. Their source, was probably the fight between the mages of the Azbel family and Clie.\nI threw the bracelet of holy power on the floor so Clie couldn’t track me, and headed for Shael’s room.\nKikiiik!\nOpening Shael’s room, I found that it was empty.\nShael, who would normally have spoken to me in a harsh tone, was not in the room.\nIt made sense.\nThe mansion was under attack, so no one would stay still in the room. Even if it was that lazy Shael.\nBut I couldn’t understand it. What if… what if Shael had already met Clie?\nClie didn’t take the lives of the wizards and servants of the mansion. But even so, there was no guarantee that she wouldn’t harm Shael.\nI pictured the worst situation in my head. I was out of breath, but I tried to take one deep breath and calm myself down.\nAnd when I turned to look for Shael. I was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief.\n“What are you doing just standing there? Why aren’t you running away!”\nThat rough and familiar tone belonged to Shael.\nBut I couldn’t help but harden my face.\nAt the moment, Shael was holding one of the strongest magic scrolls produced by the Azbel family along with the doll I had given her in the past.\nI could guess why Shael was holding the magic scroll.\nIt was a magic scroll used in battles. Shael didn’t give up no matter what enemy she would encounter. She didn’t want to evade a battle that even a villainess couldn’t win.\n“Get out of the mansion, quickly!”\n“Aren’t you coming with me?”\nAt that, Shael showed me the magic scroll she was holding in her arms.\nAs I expected, it was clear that Shael was determined to fight against Clie.\n“No. Even the mages of the Azbel family were subdued.”\nNo matter how many precious magic scrolls she used, it would be difficult to inflict significant damage on Clie, who even the mages of the Azbel family couldn’t defeat.\n“Then you want me to run away?”\n“We can’t help it.”\nShael shook her head.\nAs expected, that stubborn wicked villainess wouldn’t listen to me. But I couldn’t waste any more time, so I forcibly lifted Shael up and started running.\n“What are you doing!”\nI didn’t even answer Shael’s question. Because the sounds coming from upstairs had stopped!\nClang!\nTo head to the entrance of the mansion as quickly as possible, I broke the window.\nI could see the servants who had fallen unconscious.\n“…”\nShael, who had been spitting out her displeasure, shut her mouth at the sight.\nI said that to Shael. “Do you have any scrolls related to communication? If you ask for support…”\n“I tried… but it doesn’t work.”\nAs expected of the venomous female protagonist, she was thorough.\nFortunately, Shael and I were on the verge of finally leaving the Azbel Mansion.\nHowever, that hope was thoroughly blocked.\nTuong!\nWe suddenly hit something. The holy power surrounded the outside of the mansion like a protective shield!\nI tried swinging my sword at it, but I couldn’t break it in the end.\n“…”\n“If we use the magic scroll…”\nGoblin:\nThis is sponsored chapter 10 of 10, sponsored by Groggy!

      "content": "Shael didn’t finish what she wanted to say.\nEven Shael could tell that the magic scroll wouldn’t be enough to break this barrier produced from the mighty holy power.\n‘Does this even make any sense?’\nOf course not. There was no such a thing as logic in this world.\nBut Clie’s holy power was strangely strong. Although she had the bracelet as a weakness, even that was impossible at the moment.\n“What are you going to do with that level of swordsmanship?”\n“…!”\nClie’s voice came from behind.\nI hid Shael behind me, glared at Clie and said, “Don’t come closer.”\nAt my words, Clie just laughed.\nI put my hand on the scabbard, and asked Clie, “Why are you doing this?”\nIf Clie had really regressed, then it was normal for her to hate Shael, but there was no need for her to raid the mansion. She could’ve just waited for the time when Shael left the Azbel mansion.\nAt that moment, Shael stepped in front of me. And…\nQuuong!\nShe activated the magic scroll.\nFollowing that, all kinds of magic started pouring down on Clie.\n“…”\nHowever, Shael’s shoulders, which were proudly held high, drooped. Because none of the magic that she had cast managed to reach Clie.\nThe holy power that emanated from Clie began to wrap around Shael.\nSeeing that, I stood in front of Shael, but nothing has changed.\n“…!”\nSo had to pull out my sword.\nChae…ae..aeng!\nI unsheathed my sword with the determination to endure even a little bit.\nBut even that was only a fleeting moment. Because Clie’s holy power wrapped around the sword and crushed it with an overwhelming force.\nShael, who had already lost her consciousness, fell down.\nI could only hear a faint breathing.\n“Young Lord, would you like to try more?”\n“…”\nI remained silent as I hugged the collapsed Shael. It was a situation where there was no hope anymore.\nHowever, I didn’t let go of a last hope, and asked Clie to get more information, while looking at the bracelet Clie was now wearing on her hand.\n“Last question. Why did you give me that bracelet that should be the source of your power?”\nNo matter how much she needed a way to contact me, I couldn’t understand why she handed me her fatal weakness.\nIf I ever managed to break the bracelet of holy power, Clie would lose all her strength.\n“It won’t break anyway. I ordered the Crown Prince to use the treasured scroll from the palace.”\nWhat Clie was talking about was an enhanced scroll that was said to be the treasure of the imperial palace.\nIf the Crown Prince really used that on the bracelet, it would certainly be impossible to break it.\nIt was something I had seen in the original novel as well. Anything that reinforcement scroll was used on wouldn’t break, no matter how weak it was.\nEven if it was just a piece of paper.\nBut I didn’t believe that there could be a thing such as a perfect reinforcement scroll.\n“I see.”\nBut…\n‘Did the Crown Prince really use the reinforcement scroll on the bracelet?’\nI didn’t know the answer either.\n‘But if it’s that obsessive male lead…’\nThen his thought process could be easily predicted.\nAnyone would be able to tell that the bracelet was expensive from the first glance. It was not something that Clie, a commoner, should be able to easily obtain.\nThe Crown Prince must have thought of that as well.\nClie could’ve only gotten such an expensive and precious bracelet from the Mage Tower Lord\nThat obsessive Crown Prince also must have come to such a conclusion.\nSo I was doubtful if he really used the reinforcement scroll on the bracelet.\nBut what use was that information my current situation? The bracelet had already fallen into Clie’s hand.\nMe and Shael were also in immediate danger.\n“Shael…”\nShael’s faint breathing began to diminish even more.\nI don’t think Clie intended to kill her right away. But no one knows what Clie would do to Shael.\nI clenched my teeth while holding Shael even tighter.\nI had to figure out a way.\nPerhaps noticing my anguish, Clie said, “What are you so sad about? It’s her destined ending.”\n‘Her destined ending…’\nSo she was really here to kill Shael.\nCertainly, the end of the villainess in most novels would be quite miserable.\nBecause the ending of every novel in that genre would be the death of the villainess.\nI thought so too.\nIf the main character kills the villainess, that would mark the end of the novel.\nThere would always be a miserable end to the evil villainess who always acted selfishly.\nLike a river flowing in a set path, it was a natural fact.\n‘But…’\nNot anymore.\nIn the first place, the Shael right now… could no longer be called a ‘villainess’.\nWhich villainess would worry about her fiance, even if it was for some desserts.\nI looked at Shael, then I turned to look at Clie, who was still exuding intense holy power.\nAn absolute power. If the novel had had that kind of a troupe, then it would have ended even before it began.\nI felt choked by the overwhelming force. But it wasn’t like there was no other way.\nAn eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth.\n‘So… I, too, will just have to obtain things that are not logical at all.’\nWIth that thought, I rummaged through my shirt and found something.\nIt was the small pearl that Ruelle gave me.\nI thought I would give the pearl to Ruelle, whom I would meet someday.\nBut now, I had no other choice.\nThe pearl that allowed one to travel to the past for 3 days. If I used it now, I didn’t know how the future would change.\nIf I went back to the past, the pearls I had right now would disappear.\nBut… I will protect the future somehow.\nThat happy future where I would chat and laugh with Shael and Ruelle.\nI activated my mana, and it began to react with the pearl.\nThen the pearl emitted a golden light.\nClie’s eyes turned wide and she tried to frantically wrap her holy power around me, but…the pearl had already been activated.\nBarely calming my trembling heart, I opened his mouth to say,\n‘FU*K YOU!’\nBut I couldn’t.\nThe ring of restraint I shared with Shael started to block my words.\nI wanted to spit out swear words in a cool manner, but I guess it wasn’t meant to be.\nStill, it didn’t matter.\nThe next time we meet again, it wouldn’t just be a matter of swearing. I would also avenge what I suffered due to her holy power.\nBut before that.\nThe destined end of the villainess.\nI would change that miserable and terrible end.\nGoblin:\nSorry for the delay.

      "content": "I saw a familiar path. And… I saw Shael walking next to me.\n“Why are you acting like that all of a sudden?”\n“…”\nThe golden pearl given to me by Ruelle allowed me to stay in the past for 3 days at a desired point in time.\nUsing that, I returned right after the fireworks festival in the Pleorin Territory.\nExactly 3 days ago.\nThere was a very good reason why I choose this point in time.\nEven if I went back to the distant past, Clie would already have holy power. So I decided it would be a good idea to go back to the nearest point in time.\nIf I went too far back in the past, the future might change drastically, and that wouldn’t be a good thing.\nFortunately, there wasn’t two of me at the same timeline, as it commonly happened in many time traveling stories.\nI guess the pearl made sure that there would be only one physical existence in one timeline. In Ruelle’s case, she didn’t yet exist in my current timeline, so the pearl sent back both her soul and physical existence. On the other hand, the pearl only sent back the soul, or the memories in my case.\nAnyways, I unconsciously hugged Shael, because what happened a while ago was still quite fresh in my mind.\n“Why… what!”\n“This is the price of the dessert you stole.”\nAnyways, I had to let her go since she looked like she was on the verge of getting annoyed.\nNow, I had to come up with a way to defeat Clie.\nAfter a moment of thought, I came up with two methods. One was to break the bracelet, while the other was to prevent Clie from curing her disease.\nHowever, it would be near impossible to prevent the event where her disease would be cured.\nIn the original novel, the Crown Prince bought a seemingly insignificant pair of earrings with a large sum of money from an auction and gifted them to Clie.\nThe auctioneer claimed that the earrings had the ability to cure any disease.\nThat claim which apparently seemed like a scam, turned out to be true, and it really cured Clie’s disease!\nAs expected of a romantic fantasy novel… Clie’s illness was cured by the combination of the male lead’s affection towards the female lead and an absurd coincidence.\nTo be honest, I wanted to leave a comment asking what kind of crappy development was that after reading it.\nAnd now, maybe Clie already had the earrings. I even thought of a plan to go back to the distant past and get the earrings myself, but… to begin with, I didn’t know where those earrings came from.\nSo the best way to defeat Clie was to break the bracelet of holy power. I still had the thing in my magic pouch.\nOf course, that was impossible for now as well.\nFirst of all, I need to figure out the reason why Clie suddenly attacked the Azbel family.\n“Have you done anything weird lately?”\n“…?”\nOf course, the reason must be related to Shael. So I started questioning Shael, who was giving me a blank look.\n“I don’t do weird things.”\n“What did you do yesterday?”\n“You’ve been with me the whole time.”\nIt was true that I spend most of my day with Shael. But that didn’t mean we stay together all the time.\nAs I urged her to speak, Shael opened her mouth.\n“After I spent time with you, I stayed in my room the whole time.”\n“…”\nI kept changing the time period and continued asking, but I couldn’t get any useful answers. So this time I changed the question.\n“Then, have you left the Azbel Mansion without me in the past few days?”\nAfter thinking for a moment, Shael nodded her head. She really seems to have gone out.\n“I was out only once.”\n“What did you do during that time?”\nI listened with rapt attention. Hopefully I would be able to find something out.\n“I went to the auction house. Why are you suddenly asking me all this?” Shael tilted her head.\nI casually ignored the question.\n‘So she went to an auction house. Could it be that she met Clie there?’\n“Who did you meet at the auction house?”\n“I didn’t meet anyone.”\nThe next question was obvious.\n“Then what did you buy at the auction house?”\n“Why are you asking that?”\nI didn’t bother to answer Shael’s question. Instead, I decided to use Shael’s weakness.\n“If you tell me, I’ll make you a lot of desserts after we return to the Baslett Estate.”\nI wanted to entice Shael, and at the same time I wanted to keep her at the Baslett family so that she wouldn’t be exposed to the same danger as before.\n“Do you think I will listen to you because of that?”\nHowever, Shael’s action was the exact opposite of what she said, and she pulled something out of her pocket.\n“I bought this. Keep your promise.”\n“You say that you won’t listen to me, but your action is different.”\nShael glared at me in response.\nIgnoring that, I shifted my gaze to her hand.\nWhat Shael had taken out of her pocket was… a small pill.\nIt must have been a while since she bought it, judging from the state it was in.\nAnd, it seemed to be some kind of medicine.\n“What kind of medicine is that?”\n“…”\nDesserts or her pride? Shael, who was having trouble choosing between them, said. “It’s…not… a medicine.”\nIt was obvious that it was a lie.\nAfter letting out a sigh, I spoke to Shael. “If you don’t tell the truth, there will be no dessert.”\n“…”\n“Ah, I will also broadcast the contents of the serpent orb in the Azbel family.”\nFinally, Shael said with a disgruntled expression, “It’s a medicine that will knock anyone out.”\n“…”\n‘Why did she buy that?’\nI didn’t know.\nIt was something that had a lot of nefarious use.\nAnd, the fact that she probably wanted to use that on me, gave me goosebumps.\nAnyways, it wasn’t that important at the moment.\n“Did you buy anything else besides that?”\nAt my question, Shael brought out something from her pocket again.\nI felt immediately felt short of breath, and almost choked.\nWhat she brought out were the earrings I had seen in the illustration of the original novel.\nAnd, they were the same earrings that would cure Clie’s disease!\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "To think that the thing that was most important to Clie was now in Shael’s hands!\n“That, why did you…”\n“Do you want to take a look?”\nShael held out the earrings to me.\n‘Why on earth did Shael have the earrings that the Crown Prince should have bought and given to Clie?’\nNo, I needed to know why Shael bought them in the first place. The money they cost was too much even for the Crown Prince!\n“Why the hell did you buy that?”\n“Ah…no reason…”\n‘For no reason?’\nHowever, after thinking for a bit, I nodded. It was because the villainess often bought strange things on a whim.\nAnyway, now that I got what I wanted to know, I headed towards the Baslett Estate.\n***\nI took Shael to Baslett Mansion under the pretext of making desserts.\nAfter leaving Shael in my room with the desserts, I came out alone.\nI hid the magic pouch with the bracelet in a secret place so Clie wouldn’t see it, and entered the room where Duke Ezran was staying.\n“What happened?”\n“I need help.”\nDuke Ezran looked at me as if asking me to say more.\n“Please lend me your strength. I need to destroy a certain thing. It can’t be done unless we use the Baslett family’s Aura…”\nIn order to destroy Clie’s bracelet, I needed to find a way somehow.\nEven if I were to give Clie the earrings that would cure her disease, I didn’t know how things would turn out.\nI didn’t even know if the earrings were the reason Clie attacked the mansion in the first place.\nAnd, Duke Ezran was the person who had the most possibly of being able to destroy the bracelet. When it came to applying immense strength on small objects, Duke Ezran would have a superior advantage over Duke Jespen.\nIn my opinion, it would be difficult to destroy the bracelet with Duke Jespen’s power, as magic was weaker than swordsmanship in terms of instantaneous cutting power.\nSo, Duke Ezran was my last hope.\n“No.”\nUnexpectedly, Duke Ezran shook his head.\nI earnestly asked him back, “Can I ask why?”\n“I have already said that I can’t use Aura.”\n“…”\nEven with that resolute statement, I couldn’t really understand. The Duke of the famous swordsman family couldn’t use the Aura?\nEven Eran Baslett in the novel could use it. No matter how much I thought about it, there was no reason why Duke Ezran wouldn’t be able to use his Aura.\n“So, you may leave.”\n“Yes.”\nBut I couldn’t say anything to Duke Ezran.\nThe way he spoke was very serious. It was to the point where even I thought that maybe he really couldn’t use Aura.\nIn the first place, his expression seemed to be sincere rather than false.\nTherefore, I left Duke Ezran’s room and headed to my room where Shael was at the moment.\nI thought she had already eaten all the desserts, but surprisingly, there were still some desserts left!\nMore than half of it to be exact.\n“Could it be that you left my share?”\n“…?”\nShael shook her head as if I was stupid for asking something like that. That’s true, there’s no way the villainess would leave some desserts for anyone.\n“Were you eating sparingly?”\nKhhmph!\nAt that question, Shael cleared her throat.\nLooking at her reaction, that seemed to be the correct answer.\nI sighed.\nI felt fatigued.\nI have been struggling both mentally and physically quite a lot lately.\nWhat’t more I had already given Shael the desserts. So, I also lost that leverage for the moment.\nBut the next thing Shael said to me made me regain my strength.\n“I’ll give you at least one cookie. Because you said it didn’t contain much sugar.”\nEven though she was only saying that she’d give me just one cookie. It made me feel strangely proud at how far I managed to change her.\nIf it was the original villainess, she wouldn’t give anything away to others. Shael had changed a lot thanks to my efforts.\nHonestly, it was quite funny.\nJust one cookie was enough to convince me that I was making progress.\nAt the same time, I thought while eating the cookie Shael gave me,\n‘I absolutely don’t want to lose Shael.’\n“Come. I need to practice my Aura.”\nThere was not much time.\nI had only 3 Days.\nNo, maybe even less than that.\nIf I couldn’t destroy the bracelet by tomorrow… I would have to run away with Shael.\nI didn’t know how things would turn out once we did.\nSo, before that happens, I had to awaken the Baslett family’s Aura that had the ability to cut anything in two!\nIf the Crown Prince really didn’t use the reinforcement scroll on the bracelet, it would be worth trying with the Baslett family’s Aura.\n“Do you want to do that right now?”\n“Yes, I have to go to practice right now.”\nShael asked while tilting her head, “You still can’t use it?”\n“…”\n‘Do you think it’s easy to apply Aura into a sword?’\nThose with the blood of the Barslett family required a lot more effort to awaken it. In return, the Aura they would awaken would be a lot stronger compared to others.\n“Isn’t it just a matter of swinging the sword around?”\n“Your words make no sense.”\nI said it to make her stop, but I didn’t know why, Shael’s words seemed strangely familiar.\n[You come from a family famous for swordsmanship, but you can’t use Aura yet?]\n[Fu*k, what am I doing wrong!]\n[Why are you doing that?]\nMy voice sounded quite harsh. Even so, it didn’t feel cold.\n[I won’t give you any desserts if you mess with me again, so why don’t you shut up!]\n[That’s… absolutely not!]\nSuch a conversation suddenly appeared in my mind.\n‘Did I have this conversation with Shael before?’\nI didn’t know!\nHowever, grabbing my throbbing head, I walked toward the Baslett family’s training ground.\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

What kind of aristocrat would stick dessert in their mouth like that?\nI let out a sigh and nodded my head. However, I had one more thing to do before practicing Aura.\n“Could you give me the earrings you just showed me?”\n“Here.”\nShael, who had now swallowed the dessert, began to rummage through her pockets.\nI was worried that she wouldn’t want to give it to me because it was quite expensive, but that wasn’t the case.\nUnexpectedly, Shael obediently handed me the earrings.\nThese were the earrings that cured Clie’s disease in the original novel.\nOf course, they were very important to Clie. So I needed to keep them safe.\nFor now, it seemed that these earrings were the reason why she attacked the Azbel family.\nFirst of all, I kept the earrings in my magic pouch, then I drew out my sword to practice Aura.\n“Let’s do it!” Shael instructed.\n‘I was planning on doing it anyway.’\nAnd so, I swung my sword to practice aura with Shael on my side.\nSheeeik!\n“You need to swing harder.”\n“…”\nAs Shael said, I swing my sword with more strength.\nSheeeik!!!\n“Get your posture right.”\n“…”\nI didn’t get angry at Shael’s backseating as she was doing it to help me.\nSheeeik!!!\n“It was totally wrong this time too!”\n“Is that so?”\nI almost hit her with my sword. Still, I barely managed to hold myself back.\nSheeeik!!!\nAs my sword cut through the air, Shael continued to blabber on.\nI had to do something!\nSo this time, I spoke first.\n“I won’t give you any desserts if you mess with me again.”\nI couldn’t just swing my sword at my fiance.\nBut, still, Shael continued to blabber on.\nI see, so that’s how it was! it was necessary to punish her.\nSo after stopping the sword swing, I approached Shael.\n“What, what!”\nShael hastily covered her forehead when suddenly I raised my hand. She must’ve thought that would flick her forehead like I used to do in the past.\nBut, she was wrong!\nThe place I was aiming for was her cheek.\n“Wh…what are you doing?”\n“Maybe it’s because you ate a lot of dessert, your cheeks are quite plump.”\n“Muet mne glo mnow!” (Let me go now!)\nOf course, now she would try to hit my hand repeatedly and defend her own cheek.\nBut, it didn’t go as I was expecting.\nShael also put her hand on my cheek.\nNow we we’re both pinching each others cheeks.\n“What are you doing?”\n“I don’t know.”\nIt was fortunate that there was no one at the Baslett family’s training ground.\nAs soon as they saw Shael and I come in, they moved away.\nWe stayed like that for a good few minutes. During that time, which was short but long at the same time, Shael and I continued pinching and pulling each other’s cheeks.\nI finally took my hand off Shael’s cheek, feeling ashamed of what I had been doing.\nShael’s cheeks were now red.\nI didn’t really pull that hard, but the villainess’s cheeks were much softer than I had expected.\nShael laughed and said to me, “It looks good. Your cheeks are very, very red.”\nI didn’t feel too ashamed but listening to Shael’s words… I also felt my cheeks turn red.\n“So are yours.”\n“Mine are not like that.”\nThe crimson sunlight fell on the Baslett family’s training ground, and Shael and my cheeks continued staying red.\nWe spent our time together in such a reddened world.\n***\nA long time passed before I knew it, and it was already evening.\nIf it was the usual, it would’ve be the time for Shael and me to separate.\nI gave Shael some dessert, and brought her to my room.\n“You should stay at Baslett Mansion today.”\n“…?” Shael expressed her doubts.\nShe must be wondering why I was suddenly telling her to sleep in the Baslett Mansion\n“Why?”\n‘Why?’\nIf Clie attacked the Azbel family again, it would be another catastrophe.\nThat’s why I must never let Shael out of my sight for at least the next three days. If we stay at the Baslett Mansion, at least we’ll be able to get away.\nUnlike the time when the situation was urgent, I would be able to use the teleportation circle while the knights of the Baslett family buy us time.\nThen how should I convince Shael? Desserts might be effective in intimidating her, but… this time I wanted to play a prank on Shael.\nSince I’ve been through some difficult things, I needed to heal my spirit while harassing Shael.\n“There are certain strange rumors in the Baslett family.”\n“What are the rumors?”\n“There are rumors that ghosts roam the mansion at night.”\nOf course it couldn’t be true.\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "There were no such rumors going around the Baslett family’s mansion.\nShael snorted and said, “Haa, do you believe those rumors?”\n“It’s not a rumor. I also hear strange noises every night. You will probably hear it soon…”\nJust as I was about to finish my words, a strange sound was heard from outside the door.\nHee~ Hee~ Hee~\nAt that creepy sound, Shael’s entire body stiffened.\nOf course, only I knew that was the sounds came from the knights of the Baslett family.\n[Young Lord, is there anything we can do to help you make the Young Lady fall in love with you?!]\nThat was the request made by the knights who I used to fight together.\nI agreed without hesitation, and instructed them to make creepy sounds when Shael and I enter the room.\n“…”\nShael remained silent.\nI was worried that Shael would recognize the voice because she tended to be strangely perspective in these sort of situations.\nAnyways, the knight’s voice was quite creepy, so I think she was tricked.\n“…there’s no way I could be afraid of something like that.”\n“In that case, I think we can go to the teleportation station not far away from my room.”\n“Please accompany me there.”\nI shook my head with a sneer, and said to Shael, “Then you can just sleep here. Because I contacted Duke Jespen in advance.”\n“What, no way!”\nShael stood up from her seat. She squeezed her hand to get rid of her fear, then she boldly opened the door to leave.\nKikiiik!\nThaaddd!\nThen, she shut the door again.\nIn fact, the rumors about ghosts was just the cherry on the top, and I didn’t have to do anything to prepare the main course.\nAt night, the Baslett family’s mansion became terribly frightening.\nUsually a Duke’s mansion should have enough resources to leave the lights on even at night.\nHowever, it didn’t apply to the Barslett family.\nIt is said that after the death of Duke Ezran’s wife, the atmosphere in the mansion became gloomy.\nThere’s no way that Duke Ezran, who lacked any human emotions, would care about the atmosphere in the mansion.\nThere was not much mention of the Baslett family in the novel, so these were the facts I found out after I was sent here.\n“What is the atmosphere like?”\nEven though the atmosphere was scary, it wasn’t like you couldn’t go out. So, it seemed that the villainess was weak against scary things.\n“Weren’t you going to Azbel Mansion?”\n“…”\nOriginally, Shael would have shook her head right away. However, after thinking for a while, she sat down on my bed without giving an answer.\nIt meant that, she decided to sleep in my room.\n“Get out.”\nThen, the villainess’s wicked nature was revealed. She wanted to kick out the owner of the room!\nFor a moment, I wasn’t able to say anything because I was so dumbfounded, and using that chance Shael made herself comfortable on the bed.\nI contemplated on what I could do to retaliate and I also lay down on the bed, right beside where Shael lay.\n“What are you doing!”\n“This is my bed.”\nEven the bad-tempered villainess couldn’t refute my words. In the end, she just silently turned her body around.\n“I couldn’t even use it.”\nShe just fired a small provocation towards me as a bonus. There was no way that kind of provocation would work for me.\nSuddenly, I felt somewhat strange, and a sense of déjà vu hit me when I heard Shael’s words.\nI frowned and began to ponder.\n[You come from a family famous for swordsmanship, but you can’t use Aura yet?]\n[Don’t be a bother.]\n[Now what?]\nNext, I remember the sound of my voice mingled with ridicule.\n[I won’t give you any desserts if you mess with me again, so why don’t you shut up!]\n[Ha, I’ve been looking for a dessert shop that has desserts that taste similar to that great one!]\n[Then why don’t you just go eat there? I won’t prepare any desserts in the future.]\n[That’s a little…]\nI was immersed in trying to ponder over that all-too-familiar conversation. But, I had no choice but to stop it.\nBecause Shael talked to me.\n“I can’t sleep because I don’t have my doll.”\n‘The doll? Is she referring to the doll I gave her as a gift?’\nIt seems that whenever Shael slept, she slept hugging that doll.\nSo I playfully said to Shael, “Then, would you like to sleep while hugging me?”\n“…don’t talk nonsense.” Shael turned her head and said to me.\nThen I said while looking at Shael’s face, “Come to think of it, you didn’t really object to sleeping in the same bed with me.”\n“…!”\nShael was taken aback as if she had never thought of it.\nLooking at Shael’s face, which I could see clearly even in the dark room, I said, “Your face turned red.”\n“Yours too.”\n‘My face turned red?’\nI didn’t know if that was true. However, I could at least tell that what Shael said next was a lie.\n“And… about my cheeks, they’re because you pinched my cheeks.”\n“Is that so?”\nIt was a ridiculous excuse.\nI laughed and told Shael, “If so, it’s the same for me.”\n“…”\nThe night continued to deepen in the Bassett Mansion, which had it’s usual somber atmosphere.\nBut, thanks to Shael by my side, I couldn’t feel the bitterness I usually felt.\nGoblin:\nSponsored chapter by someone.\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "[How many times do we have to come to the theater?]\n[I can’t live without this, and you said you would give me dessert as well.]\n[Then be sure to keep that promise.]\n[People around us are paying attention, so be quiet!]\nI woke up feeling a bit stuffy. I think I had some kind of a pleasant dream, but… I couldn’t quite remember.\nIt’s because someone had disturbed my sleep.\nI couldn’t even sit up. Because Shael was currently hugging me instead of that doll.\n“Shael…”\nShael, remained unmoving at my call. The villainess valued her sleep, so it was quite natural.\nIn fact, it was me who had woke up too early in the first place. Normally I would let her sleep, but not now. If I wasted even the slightest amount of time, I wouldn’t be able to make the Aura work.\nUnless Duke Ezran used his aura, I was the only one who could break Clie’s bracelet.\nSo I had to wake Shael up.\n“Don’t wake me up!”\n“Then put your arm away.”\nAs expected, there’s no way that wicked villainess would listen to me. Rather, Shael held me even tighter and buried her face in my arms.\nSo I had to punish her.\nTutth!\nAaah!\n***\nAfter training for a while, I came to my room to pick up Shael to have our breakfast.\nShael was reading a book. It was evident that she had made use of the Baslett family’s library.\n“What are you reading?”\n“This…”\nShael held out the book she was reading.\nIt was a book about the Demon King. It was a story passed down like a legend in the world of this romance fantasy novel.\nThis was a familiar story. The movie I saw at the cinema with Shael was also about the Demon King.\n“Why are you reading this?”\nI asked the villainess as soon as I saw the book. I never thought that the villainess would be interested in a story like this.\n“Look here…”\nShael showed me the part she was reading.\nI read the part she pointed out.\n[The Demon King can even bring the dead back to life. It is because they have the power to make anything happen. But to do such a thing, of course, there is a price.]\n“It says that the Demon King can bring the dead back to life.”\n“So what do you want to say?”\nIt was a story I didn’t care much about. That legend couldn’t possibly be true.\n“They can bring the dead back to life!”\n“Do you really believe that?”\nShael nodded her head.\nStill, I wasn’t stupid enough to believe such a thing, and said, “Everyone dies.”\n“…”\nIt was natural for people to die. But as soon as Shael heard me, she frowned.\nWas it because she was afraid of dying? Was that why she was looking at a strange book like this?\n“If you die, that is the end!”\n“Then, what can we do? You can’t stop someone from dying.”\n“Still…”\nShael was still unable to let go of the book.\nAnyways, we headed to the Baslett Mansions dining area.\n“…”\nAnd the silence continued.\nBecause Duke Ezran, who usually ate with the knights, was eating alone.\nOf course, we couldn’t just ignore the man. So I led Shael to sit in front of him.\n“I’m glad that you seem to be on good terms.”\n“Yes, Duke.”\nShael spoke up before I could say anything.\n‘How come she’s being so polite?’\nIt seemed that the villainess had really changed. No, maybe it was because she was a bit afraid of Duke Ezran?\nBecause his face was emotionless enough to make me question whether he had any at all.\n“Shael Azbel.”\n“Yes!”\nHearing Duke Ezran’s cold voice, Shael trembled and answered.\nI too was feeling nervous in my heart as I waited for Duke Ezran’s next words.\n“When are you going to get married? Eran is waiting for you.”\n“…!”\nThe words that came out of Duke Ezran’s mouth were in the end, about marriage.\nAnd, who said that I was waiting to marry Shael?\nI was indeed prepared to marry Shael, but I had never said that in front of Duke Ezran.\nSo, Duke Ezran was just hastening my marriage with Shael for no reason at all!\nAfter hearing Duke Ezran’s words, Shael replied, “Marriage…”\nShael kept quiet.\nI was sure Shael would express her refusal to marry me. But, as it was with the villainess, she made a statement that I could never imagine.\n“We’ll do it soon.”\n‘What is she saying? No, you aren’t even going to ask me for my opinion?’\nMarriage was not something you can decide on your own!\nWhat an absurd conversation, and the conversation continued without giving me a chance to intervene.\n“Yes, then you must have plans for children.”\n“…”\nShael remained silent again. Of course she wouldn’t agree to that.\nSo I spoke to Duke Ezran instead of Shael, “We are thinking of having one son and two daughters.”\nShael glared at me, it must be because I said something without asking for her opinion.\n“I see.”\n“…”\nAnd, the awkward silence ensued.\nShael, who couldn’t stand the atmosphere, suddenly asked, “Duke, have you heard of the Demon King?”\nThe story about the Demon King again? I let out a deep sigh inside.\nIt seems that Duke Ezran was also very interested in the Demon King.\n“The Demon King?”\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "“Yes, the Demon King.”\n“He has a very nasty personality. But at the same time, I am also grateful to him.”\n“…”\nShael tilted her head. Because Duke Ezran was talking as if he personally knew the Demon King!\n“Then, do you also know about the legend that the Demon King can even bring the dead back to life?”\n“Are you referring to the legend where one has to pay a certain price in return?”\nShael nodded her head.\nThe two continued talking about such a ridiculous legend in such a serious manner.\nI mean, at this point, even I became a bit interested.\nThe legends about the Demon King.\nAs far as I knew, it was a very simple legend where someone had to pay a great price to save their beloved with the power of the Demon King. They were allowed to turn back time and save the person they wanted to save.\nHowever, it was all suspiciously convenient, there was no way that a Demon King would be that kind.\nSo, of course, that wasn’t the end. As expected of a Demon King, he continued to inflict all sorts of trials on the person.\nThinking about the legend, Duke Ezran muttered with a frown, “That legend…”\nIt was the first time I saw his expression change.\nIn the end, Duke Ezran didn’t finish his words.\nAnd, the awkward meal continued.\n***\nOnce again, at the Baslett family’s training ground.\nI was still swinging my sword to master the Aura.\nShael was observing me as she did before.\n“Why are you working so hard?”\nI had no choice but to work hard. Because time was running out!\nAlthough there was still some leeway before Clie attacked the Azbel family, there was no guarantee that everything will go as expected.\nI couldn’t rule out the possibility that Clie might attack the Baslett family right at the moment.\nSo I decided that today would be the last day of my Aura training. If I didn’t succeed in mastering the Aura by tonight and failed to destroy the bracelet… I was planning to take Shael to a distant place and hide away for a while.\nIf Clie attacked the mansion, I could use the teleportation circle to escape while the knights hold her back.\nI wasn’t exactly sure if the knights of the Baslett family would be able to buy me enough time.\n“The Aura… I have to succeed somehow.”\nBefore swinging the sword, I thought back to the conversation I had with Duke Ezran some time ago. Of course, it would be wise to follow the advice given by the head of the famous swordsmanship family.\n[Create a mental image, then project it on the sword.]\nThat was the only advice Duke Ezran gave me. But, suddenly another memory appeared in my mind.\n[Father, how on earth do you use your Aura?]\n[I use it while thinking of Daria.]\n[So you think of mother. Then should I think of Shael?]\nThe memory ended with Duke Ezran’s laughter.\nShael looked at me and said, “What happened?”\n“Nothing.”\n“You look sick. How about stopping and taking a break?”\n“I’m okay. I can’t rest until I succeed.”\nIgnoring my aching head, I raised my sword.\n“Then, be sure to succeed this time.”\nThe sword I had lifted remained facing the sky. Because my head started aching again!\n[This time, be sure to succeed. Because I want some dessert.]\n[Haa, I don’t think I’ll ever succeed if you continue to bother me.]\n[What if you still succeed? Would you like to make a bet?]\n[The one who loses will fulfill the winner’s wish.]\nIn my memory, the other Eran was also raising his sword to the sky. After that, he struck down his sword to vent his anger at Shael. And, the sword that cut through the air contained a blue Aura!\n[See?]\nThe Shael in my memory proudly sneered at Eran.\nAnd with that, the memory ended.\n“…”\nMy head hurt!\nI was in great pain.\nBut I still kept my sword pointed up at the sky.\nThen, I lowered my sword, based on the experience in that memory.\nI though of Shael, who was playing pranks on me and it made me feel emotions that I couldn’t understand.\nChwaaang!\nWhat I saw, was a blue Aura!\nIt was the thing that I thought I would never be able to succeed in. But here it was, blanketing my sword as it cut through the air.\nIt was something worthy of being called the ultimate weapon of a swordsman.\nI was immediately convinced of something. With this, I now had the power to destroy Clie’s bracelet!\n“Let’s go to my room.”\nAfter taking Shael to my room, I took out Clie’s bracelet that I had previously hidden.\nThe bracelet of divine power gave off a soft glow.\nHoping that the Crown Prince hadn’t used the reinforcement scroll on it, I took out my sword.\n“Please…”\nThe moment of truth had finally arrived.\nIt was time to see if the Baslett family’s Aura was really as powerful as it was said to be.\nAfter imbuing the blue Aura on my sword, I hit the bracelet with all I had.\nClang!\nAs expected, the Crown Prince really didn’t use the reinforcement scroll on the bracelet!\nThe bracelet started to crack before I knew it.\nSo I swung my sword again.\nClang!\nThe bracelet finally broke apart!\nI let out a sigh of relief and sat down.\nBut that wasn’t the end of it all.\nThe faint holy power left in the bracelet began to surround me.\nI didn’t try to dodge it. I didn’t know why, but I didn’t feel any danger from it.\nI was gradually losing consciousness due to the effect of the holy power, but I was sure that it wasn’t something harmful.\n[Does this make sense?]\n[Wha… what!]\nWhat I saw was Shael and me. The memories were faint, but they started to come back again and again.\n‘Is it the memory of Eran Baslett from the novel?’\nThat seemed right. But more than that… I was sure of another fact.\nThese were the memories of Eran Baslett, a character from the novel.\nAnd at the same time, these memories also belonged to me.\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "(G: This chapter might seem a bit confusing to some, but trust me there is a reason why its written this way. Everything will make sense by chapter 63.)\nBaslett Mansion.\nIt had the usual bright atmosphere all around.\nAnd, the ducal family was having a conversation in the dining room, as usual.\n“Is it true that you succeeded in mastering the Aura, Eran?”\n“Yes, Father.”\nMy father looked at me proudly. Even my mother, who was next to me, was looking at me happily.\nThen my mother opened her mouth, “How did you end up mastering it?”\n“I can’t say that…” I can never say it! The fact that I succeeded in mastering the Aura while being angry at Shael’s provocation.\n“As I said, I mastered my Aura while thinking of Daria. Then you…”\n“…”\nAt the same time, my father smiled and looked at me. The reason he brought out that fact in this situation was simple. He meant that the success of my Aura had something to do with Shael.\nI couldn’t help but nod my head. Because it was true.\n“As expected.”\n“Yes.”\n“Go to Shael quickly.”\nI was kicked out without much resistance.\n***\n“You are late.”\nAs if thinking back to what happened last time, Shael mocked me and accused me of being late.\nI, of course, didn’t take it seriously and just answered causally, “I’m not that late.”\nI mean, I really wasn’t that late in the first place.\n“How long are you going to speak to me that way? You’re not a child.” She complained.\n“Do you not like that about me?” I asked in return.\nOf course she wouldn’t like it. If you want to be respected, you have to respect the other person first.\nHowever, that wasn’t the case when it came to Shael, my fiancée.\nShe had a personality worthy of being called a villainess. She had all kinds of eccentric hobbies, and she also had a strange mindset.\nI couldn’t help but think back to the past.\n[How are you feeling today?]\n[I was feeling quite good. Seeing you made me feel sick.’\n[I see…]\nIt was a time when I was being harassed by this wicked woman on a regular basis.\nFrom sudden insults, to utter disregard of my feelings. She used to act rude to the extent that it was hard to believe that she was the daughter of a Duke.\nThe villainess Shael treated me as a target for venting her anger. And, she did it for one entire year!\nSo I decided to change as well.\n[Please stare at the wall today.]\n[Fu*k you!]\n[…. what did you… just say?]\n[Can you keep your mouth shut? If that’s difficult, should I sew it with my sword?]\nThinking back to that time made me laugh. Because Shael’s reaction was really interesting.\n[Wha… what!]\n[I’m not good at sewing, but if I do it with a sword, I think things will go well. After all, I am quite adept at the art of swordsmanship.]\nThe day, I expressed my anger at the villainess for the very first time.\nAnd starting from that day, everything changed.\nIt was quite difficult at first, but after some time, I got used to the role.\nIf Shael wanted to bully me, I would bully her back, and sometimes I did it even before she could.\nIt took us a while to get to the state of relationship we currently had with each other.\nIf there was problem… it would be that Shael and I both had strange tastes.\nIn other words, we were a perfect match… and it didn’t take us long to became closer and closer.\nIt was really something absurd.\n“So, what is your wish?”\n“What wish?”\n“You said that if I succeed in mastering the Aura, I will have to grant you one wish.”\n‘I didn’t forget. But to think she actually forgot.’\nThinking that to myself, I laughed at Shael.\nShael, unaware of my thought, said with a grin, “First, make me some dessert.”\n“Didn’t you say you found a dessert shop that has a dessert that tastes similar to mine?”\n“It wasn’t exactly the same. And, a commoner I dislike goes to that dessert shop all the time.”\nSo she wasn’t going to go the anymore, well, I should just give her the dessert.\nAs usual, I brought out a dessert for Shael.\n“Is that enough?”\n“…”\nWhile eating the cupcakes, Shael muttered something to herself and then shook her head.\n“You’re acting like that again.You should have given me some. What a pig.”\n“Then drink this.”\nShael handed me a bottle of strange juice.\nThe juice had a color that made you feel the bitter taste just by looking at it.\n‘What is this?’\nAnyway, whatever it was, I was sure that would never like it.\n“I don’t want to.”\n“Drink it.”\n‘Was it something poisonous?’\nNope, that’s not the case either. I already applied poison detection magic, but I couldn’t feel any poison.\nIn fact, it was impossible to detect high-level poisons with my level of poison detection magic, but… there was no reason for Shael to poison me in the first place.\nShe might be wicked woman with strange tastes, but after I changed my method, our relationship had gotten much closer in its own way.\nIf I died, no one would make desserts for her.\n‘Ah, would she go to the dessert shop that she said has a similar taste to my dessert?’\nBut even that would be impossible. Because my dessert would still be better!\nIt was a fact I was very certain of from Shael’s reaction.\n“Yes, give it to me.”\nShael handed me the bottle full of juice.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also motivate me by sponsoring chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "I took the bottle and opened the lid.\nA strange smell immediately wafted up to my nose.\nShael also frowned due to the smell. To think that she was trying to feed me something like this, yet she herself was frowning at the smell.\nDrrr!\nI got up from my seat while holding the bottle with one hand.\n“Wha…what are you doing?”\n“Let’s see what kind of juice it is.”\n“…!”\nI squeezed the juice into Shael’s mouth while she was eating dessert. Since it wasn’t poison, she’d be fine… probably.\nSoon, there was only a little juice left. So I thought she would spit out the rest, so I said, “Swallow it all.”\nAfter hearing my words, Shael really began to swallow the juice. It was something unbelievable!\nFeeling quite strange, I asked Shael, “What kind of juice was it, did you really swallow it without any resistance?”\n“The sap of the tree of obedience.”\nEven from the name, the juice seemed unusual. No matter how you think about it, it wasn’t something that seemed to be used for a good cause.\n“What does it do?”\n“The juice can make someone obey any command.”\nSomehow, it didn’t make sense for her to be this honest. It was evident that it was due to the sap of the tree of obedience.\nRealizing her mistake, Shael covered her mouth with her hands, but… that was useless now.\n“Remove your hand and answer.”\n“Yes.”\nShael was really following my words! She couldn’t resist!\nI suddenly had a thought,\n‘This situation is an opportunity that might never come again!’\n“Are you waiting for me to come these days?”\nIt was really a cringy question, and I almost grabbed my head in shame.\nI mean, even though I had received letters from many noble ladies due to my status as the heir to a ducal house, I had never really been in a relationship.\nSo I wasn’t used to saying these kind of words. However, I wanted to ask in order to make fun of Shael later.\nIf Shael was really waiting for my arrival every day, that information would be something quite useful.\nAlthough I had a weapon called dessert, I wanted to have something else to annoy Shael.\n“Yes.”\nShael couldn’t overcome the sap’s effect, and she answered my question.\nThen, I started thinking of the next question, and decided on something after giving it a lot of thought. It was a fairly unconventional question.\n“Do you hate me?”\nI wanted to ask if she liked me, but I couldn’t because of shame. Still, this question should have give me the answer I wanted as well.\nThe moment Shael was about to open her mouth and give an answer, Duke Jespen suddenly entered the room, like he usually did.\nDrrr!\n“Eran, Shael. I’m glad you seem to be on good terms.”\n“Of course, Duke. Isn’t it natural considering that we are fiances?”\nI spoke to Duke Jespen, who was looking at us with a smile, and turned to ask Shael, “Right, Shael?”\n“…”\nI spoke without the usual honorific that was commonly used among nobles.\nShael just nodded her head at my question.\nDuke Jespen said with a smile, “Okay, then I suppose I will get to see my grandchildren soon!”\nHe then gave Shael a satisfied look, and quickly left the room.\n“…”\nAnyway, let’s continue from where we left off.\nBut, I didn’t want to repeat the previous question. I didn’t want to know Shael’s feelings using some kind of strange tree sap.\nInstead, I was inspired by Duke Jespen’s parting words and I said to Shael, “If, by any chance, we have a child later…”\n“…?”\n“Whose personality would it resemble more?”\nOf course, Shael would definitely avoid this question, since it was a question based on the premise that a child would be born between me and Shael.\nBut it seemed that the potency of the sap of the tree of obedience was quite great.\n“It must be more like my personality.”\nIf that really ends up being the case, I think I’d have to go find a place to cry.\n‘My child will have such a dirty personality? No way!’\nShaking my head, I said to Shael. “Being similar to my personality should be fine. If so…”\n“…”\n“A name. What should we name it?”\nActually, I knew that we shouldn’t be hasty in naming it, but… I couldn’t resist the urge when I thought about my future with Shael. In the first place, me and Shael had somewhat similar personality so that didn’t really bother me.\n“Name?”\n“Yes, a name. I really wish it would be a girl.”\nActually, having a son would also be fine. But I think it would be really cute if our daughter ended up looking like Shael. Of course, I also hoped that her personality didn’t resemble hers.\nShael, who had no patience, quickly opened her mouth. She came up that precious name without a moment’s thought. “How about Ruelle?”\n“Ruelle.”\nIt was only a moment of thought, however, Shael and I were convinced. We wouldn’t be able to think of a better name than that!\n“It’s a pretty, cute name.”\n“Isn’t it?”\n“I don’t think there can be a better name than this.”\nWe made up our mind right away. Yes we were a bit impatient, but I was sure that we were a pair that really suited each other.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also motivate me by sponsoring chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "At a theater with a gloomy atmosphere.\nShael and I were watching a play with a scary story.\n“I liked the theater better before this…” Shael continued to complain with a dissatisfied tone.\n“How many times do we have to come to the theater?”\n“I can’t watch this, and you said you would give me dessert as well!”\n“Keep that promise.”\nShael was speaking in a rather loud voice.\nThere were many people in theater. So of course, talking so much would mark us as a nuisance.\n[Ah, it would be nice if we could chat together while watching the play.] (G: speaking in the background.)\n“People around us are paying attention, so be quiet!”\nAs expected, there’s no way that Shael would be considerate towards others and keep quiet.\nShe was about to open her mouth to speak again, but I was well prepared, shoved a cookie right into her mouth.\nSo, she had to close her mouth again.\n“If you are going to talk, can’t you speak quietly like me?”\nShael glared at me. Then she began to munch on the cookie immediately afterwards, forgetting all her previous complaints. Of course, was all thanks to the excellent taste of the cookie I had just shoved in her mouth.\nMaybe the sweet snack relieved some of Shael’s anger, so she told me while holding back her dissatisfaction, “It would be nice if there were noise control magic tools, so that it would be easier to talk.”\n“That’s nonsense.”\nIf they wanted to do that, they would have to spend a lot of money for just a theater.\n“Then…”\n“Stop talking nonsense and focus on the play.”\nI simply ignored Shael’s words and focused on the play. But that was only for a moment.\nMaybe due to being annoyed that I cut her off, Shael began to drink water to cool off.\n“Puha…”\n“Is that the water I was drinking?”\n“…” Shael glared at me.\nIt was indeed the water I was drinking from the beginning, but it does seem really selfish of me to stop her when she is thirsty.\n“It’s a joke, so drink it.”\nWell, no it wasn’t. I actually a lied. Blatant lie!\nShael was fooled by my words, drank to her heart’s content.\nAnd when the play came to an end, I told Shael, “Ah, now that I think about it, it was indeed the glass I was drinking from.”\n“..!”\nI stood up from my seat while appreciating the surprised look on Shael’s face.\n“You did it on purpose!”\n“Not at all.”\n“Yes you did… you are smiling!”\nShael persistently pursued me. As expected of a villainess who can’t stand her own loss, Shael handed me the water and said, “I won’t lose, so please drink it too.”\n“Yes.. yes, I’ll do that.”\n“…!”\nAs soon as I received the glass from Shael’s hand, I drank it all in a few gulps. I even smirked at Shael, who was embarrassed by my action, while holding the glass to my mouth.\nAfter I was done, I didn’t forget to make fun of Shael, “Does this count as an ‘indirect kiss’?”\n“What nonsense!”\nI didn’t answer Shael’s words. I just put my mouth on the glass again, and it was exactly on the place shael had put her mouth to drink.\nOf course, there was no way Shael would let it continue. Just because she had a dirty personality, didn’t mean that she had no sense of shame.\n“Give it back!”\n“Nope.”\n“You’re strange!”\n‘Strange?’\nIt was a bit too harsh to call me that, and she was even qualified to call me that.\nBecause Shael had acted even more stranger than me in the past.\n“Who tried to feed me some strange tree sap?”\n“That…”\n“Didn’t you try to make me do something strange?”\nI didn’t know if that action could be counted as malicious, but it was obvious that it was strange.\n“Well, if you really think so, I have a question.”\n“…?”\n“Didn’t you intentionally drink from the water glass that I drank from?”\n“No!”\nShael shook her head in denial. She was adamant on proving that I was the one in the wrong but she wouldn’t be able to defeat me with just that.\nShe had tried to feed me some strange juice in the past, so she did something wrong to me first.\n“Then why were you trying to feed me that sap of the tree of obedience that can make someone do anything?”\n“…”\n“To make someone do anything, no matter how I see it, it’s quite strange.”\n“Ah, no.”\nAs expected, Shael couldn’t confidently say that I was in the wrong anymore.\n“Come to think of it, when I asked if you were waiting for me lately, you nodded.”\n“…”\n“Isn’t that strange?”\nShael shook her head again. She was still holding strong. It seemed that the shameless villainess hadn’t let go of her old personality yet.\nBut the thing I was going to say next, would defeat her for sure!\n“We even named our future children.”\n“That…”\n“You even insisted that she would resemble you personality more.”\n“Shut up!”\nAs expected, the last one was a threat.\nNormally, I would have stopped here. But I continued to make fun of Shael.\n“In the end, I also hope to see my daughter much earlier.”\n“I want to see my daughter soon. I think she will be very cute.”\n“Say something that makes sense.”\n“I was being serious when we gave her a name.”\n“…”\nAt that point, Shael’s face had reddened from shame.\nI was worried that she’d flare up, so I brought out another dessert.\n“Shael.”\n“What?”\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also motivate me by sponsoring chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "“Hmmph!”\nWhen I called her name, Shael replied with a snort full of complaints, and then pouted to show that she was angry.\nSome might find it a bit harsh, but it didn’t seem that way to me at all. I only saw a grumpy cute woman.\n“If you don’t want to eat it, then I will give it to someone else.”\n“You can’t do that!”\nShael, who was acting as if she wouldn’t talk to me, snatched the dessert from my hand.\n“Is it delicious?”\n“Yes… no! No.”\nShael tried to hide her true thought that she instinctively revealed.\nI barely held back my laugh and continued to walk along with Shael.\nBefore long, I spotted an accessory shop beside the road. Well, since I had teased Shael a bit too much, I guess I should also give her a gift to balance things out.\nWith that thought in mind, I walked towards the accessory shop, but Shael asked, “Why are we going there all of a sudden?”\n“Just wait.”\nTelling Shael, who expressed her doubts, to be patient, I turned my attention to a pair of rings.\nThe pair of rings would go exceptionally well with Shael and me. They each had a softly shining blue gem embedded in them.\n“This is perfect. I would love to share them.”\n“Yes, I see.”\nShael also nodded her head as if she had forgotten her anger.\nSatisfied with her reaction, I proudly checked the price tag.\n[5 million gold.]\nThey were expensive, but not for me.\nThe Baslett family was a ducal family with high prestige, and immense wealth. Moreover, the value of the numerous heirlooms in the family must be enormous as well.\nTherefore, the amount of gold I received every month for maintaining my dignity was quite a huge amount.\nAfter completing the transaction, I handed the other ring to Shael.\n“You like it?”\n“No… yes.”\nShael tried to deny it at first due her grumpiness earlier. But because the ring was so pretty, she didn’t do that in the end. It was also thanks to the sweet dessert that might have relieved her anger a little.\n“Then let’s go back to Azbel Estate.”\n“Yes.”\nAfter some time we arrived at the Azbel family’s mansion.\nDuke Jespen, being quick-witted, smiled as he recognized the rings that Shael and I now shared.\nShael must have been annoyed by that, so she grabbed my arm and headed for her room.\nThat’s how time passed.\nAnd, our everyday life continued as usual.\nI continued to enjoy my days while drinking tea with Shael.\nShael, who used to bully me, had changed quite a lot.\nIn fact, it wasn’t that Shael didn’t try to bully me anymore. It’s just that I was able to accept Shael’s bullying as a cute prank.\nHowever, just like everything else in the world, even Shael and my happy days didn’t last forever.\nBecause sadness was meant to come in between happy days.\n[Please allow him to carry the poison detection magic, so that he can detect poison no matter how stong it is.] (G: Again in the background.)\n“Young Lord, I have brought you some tea.”\n“Yes. It seems that the scent is different from usual?”\nIt was a strange scent. It seems to be similar to the tea I drank in the imperial palace when I was young.\nAt the moment, I was waiting for Shael, who had gone to have a talk with Duke Jespen.\nSo, in order to pass the time, I decided to have some tea.\n***\nThe memory abruptly stopped!\nCovering my throbbing head, I tried not to miss a certain blurry scene.\nThen, I saw an expressionless Duke Ezran kneeling down on the ground in front of a dark silhouette.\nI saw the dessert shop that Shael loved to death in the original novel. There, Shael sobbed while receiving something from Duke Ezran.\nI saw the villainess struggle while trying to steal the bracelet of holy power from Clie.\nThen, I saw a piece of paper and a journal with my handwriting placed in front of Shael, who had managed to take the bracelet, and she was writing something down on the journal.\nAnd then, the memory came to an end.\n***\nMy body felt stiff and my head ached.\nI opened my eyes with difficulty, and I found myself at the Baslett family’s hospital room.\nAfter breaking Clie’s bracelet, I must have fainted for a while.\n“…?”\nI saw Shael sleeping with her head propped up on my stomach!\nI wanted to hug Shael right away because of the memories I had just seen in my dream, but I didn’t.\nBecause Shael looked very tired and emaciated.\nI left the room after carefully placing Shael on the bed. Even though it was quite early in the morning, the physicians belonging to the Baslett family were all busy working.\n“Ah, Young Lord!”\n“What, why?”\nSuddenly, a doctor exclaimed with shock, and came up to me after taking a deep breath.\n“Young Lord, are you feeling well?”\n“Of course I’m fine. Why are you acting like that?”\n“You have been unconscious for 15 days!”\n“What!?”\nSo, I’ve been passed out for 15 days?\n‘Was the aftereffect of breaking the bracelet of holy power that great?’\nWell, I didn’t mind it that much, considering it allowed me to experience some really happy memories.\n“Young Lord, you need to rest!”\n“Okay, stop making a fuss and go.”\nI came back into the hospital room from earlier. I sat next to Shael, who fell asleep, and looked at her.\nI didn’t know how worried she must have been since I had remained unconscious for 15 days.\n‘No, would the villainess even worry about me?’\nI would know the answer to that question soon enough.\nBecause a pair of sky blue eyes were looking directly at me.\nShael made an expression of disbelief for a moment, then let out a cute cry.\n“Ah!”\n“Did I wake you up? You look tired. Get some more sleep.”\nAs expected, there was no way the villainess would listen to my words.\nInstead of going back to sleep, Shael suddenly pounced on me and gave me a hug!\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems these few months, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "The hug came as quite a surprise.\nTo think that the wicked villainess would hug me on her own volition! I found it quite hard to believe.\nIt seemed that me being unconscious for 15 days caused great concern to Shael.\n“…”\n“…”\nI didn’t say anything. Because Shael was frozen while holding me, and I also became frozen like Shael.\nNormally, I would be calm and thinking of a way to make fun of Shael for doing something stupid.\nPerhaps I became an idiot as well…\nI barely spoke to Shael, “Are you okay?”\n“Ah!”\nShael hurriedly let me go, with her face blushing red.\nI wanted to make fun of Shael. It was clear that she hugged me without even thinking about it. But looking at her serious face, I couldn’t make myself do it.\n“Explain.”\nSuddenly, she asked me to explain something. It was really unreasonable to ask me that without even mentioning what to explain.\nShael added, “Didn’t you have blood clotting disease?”\n“Did you say the blood clotting disease?”\n“Yes. I’m sure of the name, I heard it from a physician…”\nIt was an incurable disease. And it was a real one, because the name of the disease Clie was suffering from was the blood clotting disease.\nI also bought Clie medicine for blood clotting disease in the past.\nSo I became curious. There’s no way I had the blood clotting disease. So it was clear that Shael was misunderstanding something.\n“What do you mean by that? Why would I have the blood clotting disease?”\n“Obviously. You had the medicine for the blood clotting disease the other day, right?”\nMedicine for the blood clotting disease? There’s no way I would have had it.\nExcept for when Clie had asked me to buy it.\nI felt even more doubtful, so I asked Shael right away, “Did you open my magic pouch?”\n“… yes.”\nSo she did. Then I became even more confused about why Shael was so sure about it just from that.\nWhile I became speechless due to my confusion, Shael said, “There were times when you looked tired, and there were times when you suddenly had a high fever…”\n“It’s all a coincidence. And I was carrying the medicine for the blood clotting disease due to a certain circumstance.”\n“What is it?”\nI couldn’t say that it was because Clie had asked me to buy it for her. So I just ignored Shael’s question.\nShael gave up on the question due to my silence and asked, “Then, why did you suddenly lose consciousness for 15 days?”\n“…”\nI didn’t know what to say. I didn’t think she would believe me even if I told her that it was because I broke the bracelet of holy power.\nI couldn’t find a suitable excuse for suddenly losing consciousness for over 15 days.\n“Answer me!”\n“I won’t.”\nI chose to attack Shael instead of making excuses, and just like Shael did earlier, I also jumped on her and hugged her.\n“What…!”\n“You did it too, then why can’t I?”\nThe selfish villainess struggled to get out of my embrace. In fact, she didn’t even seem to be trying that hard.\nAnd, there was no way I would easily let go of her.\nI began to think while holding Shael. It was about a memory I had recalled while I was unconscious.\nIt was the hidden memory from the original novel, in other words, the original timeline. I remembered that I was Eran Baslett in the original timeline.\nI was poisoned and died. Perhaps the culprit behind it was the Crown Prince. No, I was sure it was him!\nA person powerful enough to make a maid of the Azbel family, who boasted great loyalty, poison someone, it could only be someone like him. Additionally, only a powerful person would have the guts to kill me, who was the only son of a famous swordsman.\nI could also guess the reason why he did it.\nOf course it was because of Clie!\nI was able to figure it out without even thinking about it.\nSince I was the fiance of the villainess, of course the past me also had contact with Clie.\nMaybe I also had a private conversation with Clie in order to ease the conflict between Clie and Shael. And the Crown Prince, who always stalked Clie, would have seen it.\nSo it was natural for the obsessive prince to misunderstand.\nIn fact, it was really quite difficult to misunderstand, considering I already had a fiance. I even had the status of the heir of a duke. It was basic common sense that I wouldn’t be attracted to some commoner like Clie.\n‘But I shouldn’t apply common sense to him.’\nBecause that Clie-crazy basta*d tried to kill even the Mage Tower Lord. Not only that, he tried to kill all the men who had private conversations with Clie.\nSo what if I was a man who already has a fiance? The moment I had a private meeting with Clie, the obsessive male protagonist, the Crown Prince, became enraged.\nThe Mage Tower Lord could keep himself safe through the Mage Tower’s excellent protection and his powerful battle magic, but… I didn’t have any of that.\nI didn’t even learn any proper magic, so I couldn’t detect such a powerful poison at the time.\nBefitting a male protagonist who was perfect in everything except for his personality, the Crown Prince must have completely gotten rid of all the evidence so that no one would ever know that he was the person responsible for the poisoning.\nOnly Shael, who was close to me, would have noticed that.

      "content": "Instead, Shael tried to save me.\nIt reminded me of what I saw when I passed out. It was the scene of Duke Ezran on his knees in front of a dark silhouette.\nIt was obvious what that dark silhouette was.\nIn order to save me, Duke Ezran paid a price to the Demon King.\nAnd the price was —\n‘He wouldn't be able to use Aura.’\nThe words that I had dismissed as lies were true!\nIn addition, the Baslett family was strangely lacking in heirlooms and wealth despite being a ducal family.\nNow, all of that made sense. Except only one— why did Duke Ezran hand over the wish given to him by the Demon King to Shael.\n‘Well, I’ll figure that out later.’\nAnyway, because of that, Shael stole the bracelet of holy power from Clie.\nDespite all his powers, the Demon King wasn't a god, and it would’ve been impossible for him to save a dead person just because a price was paid. Therefore, he must have needed the bracelet of holy power that possessed vast amounts of holy power.\nIn the original timeline, Shael didn’t try to steal Clie’s bracelet on a whim, she had a reason!\nThe next thing I remembered was the paper placed in front of Shael.\nWritten there, were the wishes Shael wished for me.\n[Please allow him to carry the poison detection magic, so that he can detect poison no matter how stong it is.]\nIt wasn’t for no reason that I studied magic diligently as soon as I was sent to this world. Maybe that was the reason why I read the novel in the first place.\n“Please make the theater he loved a better place.”\n[Ah, it would be nice if we could chat together while watching the play.]\nA movie theater with features that didn’t fit in the world at all. It also made sense why the theater provided sound-blocking magic tools which were quite expensive.\n[I hope I can see my daughter much earlier, who I didn’t get to see in the end.]\nOur daughter came from the future for a reason.\nAs for the journal that Ruelle gave me at that time.\nI thought it was written by the future me. Of course, I would, since it was in my handwriting, but… I didn’t.\nBecause in the memory, it was Shael who was writing the journal using my handwriting.\nI read it over and over and thought a lot about contents of the journal, to the point I had memorized it all.\nThe contents I had thought to be connected with Ruelle, were all nonsense written by a foolish Shael.\nThe recipes for the desserts must have been added by Shael, who somehow managed to get them.\nAnd the meaningless advice in the second half.\nI could understand them now.\nㅡ Unconditionally accept and drink the drink Shael gives you.\nIt must be because Shael tried to make me drink the sap of the tree of obedience and failed.\nNo, rather, in that memory, I fed the sap of the tree of obedience to Shael instead.\n— Make lots of desserts for Shael.\nOf course Shael wanted to eat my dessert.\n— When you become the head of household, give up your work and devote all your time to Shael and Ruelle.\nㅡ When you receive a love letter from someone, do not ignore it, but punish the sender with a curse.\nWhen I think that all of those advices were written by Shael, it fit perfectly!\n“…”\nI was the Eran Baslett mentioned in the original novel from the very beginning!\nMaybe the reason I read the novel was because of Shael’s wish to save me.\nI sorted out my thoughts and released Shael from my embrace.\n“While I was unconscious, were you worried?”\n“Ah, Neyo. Not at all.”\n“Oh, I see.”\nShe was the same dishonest villainess.\nI pretended to be angry and left the room.\nEven though it was dawn, I needed to go see Duke Ezran. Because I wanted to know more about the past.\nAbove all, he knew about the Demon King.\nSeeing how all of Shael’s wishes had come true, I had to know how much price he had to pay.\nWhen I reached his study, a knight approached me, and asked, “Young Lord Eran! Are you finally awake?”\n“Yes. Where is my father?”\n“Ah, he went somewhere a while ago. He instructed you to spend time with Lady Shael when you wake up.”\nUnfortunately, it seemed that the conversation with Duke Ezran would have to be postponed.\nStill, I couldn’t get rid of all the complicated thoughts.\nThe Crown Prince poisoned me.\nThe Mage Tower Lord was antagonistic towards Shael and me.\nLastly, Clie, who attacked the Azbel family in the past.\nEven assuming that Clie had now lost her strength, all of those were difficult trials to overcome.\nTherefore, it was necessary to prepare for the future.\nI had too many things on my plate.\nBut before that, I needed to take care of the most important person to me.\nOf course, that person was Shael.\nAnd at the moment, that Shael was secretly following me. The reason was simple.\n[While I was unconscious, were you worried?]\n[Ah, Neyo. Not at all.]\nI came out of the hospital room pretending to be angry at Shael’s dishonest remark.\nI kind of feel sorry for Shael, who must have suffered quite a lot while I was unconscious, but my main priority was to change the dishonest personality of the villainess.\nTherefore, I spoke in a moderately loud voice so that Shael, who was following me, could hear it.\n“I have nothing to say to her.”\nI glanced at the direction of Shael, and found that she was staring at me in bewilderment.\nThen I added, “I’m starting to get tired of being patient now. Oh, should we break off the engagement?”\nThuudd!\nShael, seemingly shocked by my words banged her head against the wall.\nBarely holding back my laughter, I began to devise a plan to correct her dishonest personality.\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "In my room.\nAt the moment, I was facing Shael.\nI said something quite provocative a few moments ago, and Shael, who was following me at the time, had heard it.\nAnd thanks to that, Shael was now paying extra attention to me.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Oh, nothing…”\nThe villainess continued staring at me.\nI didn’t expect my plan to be this effective, it was really quite amazing!\nTo the point where I was beginning to think that maybe I was a bit too harsh.\nI barely held myself back from apologizing to the now agonizing Shael, considering that I too had to suffer for quite a long time because of her.\nHonestly, I didn’t intend to hold onto that grudge anymore, but… I needed a rational reason for doing this.\nBecause, I wanted to experience more of the cute side of Shael while she looked after me.\nShael looked at me and said. “That…”\n“What?”\n“Ehhem..umm…”\nShael shut her mouth.\n‘Why did you say such a thing?’\n— I could easily guess what she wanted to say.\n[While I was unconscious, were you worried?]\n[Ah, Neyo. Not at all.]\nAt Shael’s dishonest words, I pretended to be angry and left the hospital room.\nBecause of that, it was clear that the villainess wanted to say something despite her shame.\nThen, Shael took a deep breath and spoke, “I should have been worried.”\n“…”\nWhat do you mean you should have been worried? It’s the same as saying that you were not worried.\nOf course, it was a bit disappointing, but it was still a huge improvement.\nEven so, I didn’t want to tell Shael the truth.\nInstead, I decided to give her some compensation, considering that she couldn’t eat my dessert for 15 days.\n“Please follow me.”\n“Yes? Yes!”\nShe answered twice! That’s how nervous Shael was.\nStill, maybe her tension would be relieved soon.\nI went to the Baslett family’s kitchen.\nIt was still quite early, so the cooks of the Baslett family hadn’t come to work yet. Thanks to that, Shael and I were able to use the cooking room alone.\n“Why are we here?”\n“I will make dessert for you.”\nDuring these 15 days, Shael, who had been waiting for me, seemed to have become quite frail. So I wanted to give her some food full of nutrients.\nWith that thought, I started cooking, while Shael found a seat and sat down.\nHowever, she suddenly stood up from her seat.\nI thought that she wanted to give me some useless advice as usual, but this time it was different.\n“I can help.”\n“Yes?”\nShael held out her hand towards me. It seemed to mean that she was asking for work.\nEven though I knew the meaning, I hesitated.\nThe last time Shael cooked, she ended up making that strange cookie. So of course she was terrible at cooking.\nIn the first place, it was rare for the nobles in this world to cook for themselves.\n“I will do it myself.”\n“No, I will help too.” Shael strongly insisted.\nI had no choice but to give in.\nEven if she couldn’t cook, she could at least help me with fetching the ingredients.\n“Fetch me some sugar. Just sprinkle a little bit on the cupcakes.”\n“Yes.”\nAnd soon, I found out that it was the worst mistake I could make.\nI gave her the simple work thinking that Shael could do it, but… at some point, the cupcakes were entirely covered in sugar!\nI mean, I should’ve expected that, since Shael didn’t know the meaning of moderation.\nAnd now, the cupcakes looked too sweet to eat.\n“What is this?”\n“Why?” Shael tilted her head as if asking me what she did wrong.\nI also continued my questioning, “If you sprinkle so much sugar, how on earth will you eat it?”\n“…?”\nShael looked puzzled for a moment before picking up the cupcakes. They were extremely unhealthy.\nAnd, before I could stop her, she took a bite of the cupcake.\nThen she said to me while eating it, “What’s wrong with it?”\n“…”\nFrom now on, I must keep my eyes on Shael all the time. Because I didn’t want her to ruin her health with so much sugar.\nAnyways, I sighed and continued cooking.\nOf course, as before, Shael continued to “help” me.\n“Oh, I will do this.”\n“Go ahead.”\nThe cucumbers, which had been thoroughly washed, turned into powder before I knew it.\n“Of course this has to be heated, right?”\n“…”\nShhhhhssst!\n“Ah…”\nThe dough turned to ashes and disappeared after burned by Shael’s magic.\nBut, that wasn’t the end. Shael was still continued to diligently help me.\nShe said that she would do a good job, but she was horrible at it.\nAnd I couldn’t stop her.\nI became worried that we won’t have anything to eat if I let this carnage continue. So I asked Shael. “Could you rub my shoulders while I cook?”\n“…”\nIt was a request that the villainess would definitely refuse.\n“That sounds like it would be really helpful.”\nHowever, Shael simply nodded her head!\nShael stretched out her arm to overcome the height difference between us and began to rub my shoulder.\nIn that way, I was able to finally finish cooking with the villainess.\nGoblin:\nI am going through some financial problems, which is giving me a lot of stress.

      "content": "Shael picked up one of the cookies and handed it to me.\nTo think that such a thing was possible!\nIn the past, she didn’t even allow me to touch her desserts.\nBut, not anymore.\nNow, Shael didn’t mind if I also ate the desserts.\nAs I took the cookie and ate it, Shael opened her mouth, “That…”\n“What is it?”\n“Maybe…”\nShael looked at me and said, “Are you angry?”\nWas I angry? Not at all.\nDid she think that because of what I said when she was following me?\nBut the question was too sudden, and Shael was staring at me more than ever before.\nI looked at Shael in confusion, and she said, “You’re different than usual.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I don’t know.”\nShe didn’t know why?\nWell, I could understand why Shael felt that way.\nWhen Shael was helping me with cooking… (of course, she didn’t really help me) I had suddenly asked her to massage my shoulders.\nIt might've seemed quite strange, since I suddenly asked for such a favor while she was helping me with the cooking. I mean, although she really wasn’t that helpful, Shael did want to help me.\nOf course, it was also possible that Shael, who has a strange way of thinking, wouldn’t find that strange at all, but… I sighed as I looked at the sugar-covered cupcakes.\n[I have nothing to say to her.]\nThen, some time ago, when Shael was following me, I had said such cold words. So of course, it might also cause her to feel that way.\nI looked at Shael, who continued to stare at me with a sullen expression.\nAnyway, it seemed like the time had come to stop playing around.\nI began to think about what to say to Shael.\nWhat kind of words can brighten her sullen expression?\nUsing a bunch of cheesy word would be too embarrassing. So I needed to say something that wouldn’t be too embarrassing and express my true feelings at the same time.\nSo I came up with a good idea. I wanted to first make Shael confused and then happy.\nAnd so, I said, “Actually, I have a girl I love.”\n“…!”\nI didn’t tell her who the girl was.\nFeeling shocked, Shael asked me, “Whh…who?”\n“Are you curious?”\nShael nodded her head.\nSo, I threw a clue for Shael who was now curious. It was a really simple and easy clue. Just enough for her to figure out who that person was.\n“First of all, she has a very bad temper.”\n“…”\nI was sure that Shael, who was quick-witted, would understand the meaning of my words…no, come to think of it, Shael only became stupid in situations like this.\nShael, who remained silent for a moment, struggled to open her mouth.\n“It will be difficult to be with someone with a bad temper.”\n“Is that so?”\nIt didn’t matter anyway. These days, the bad-tempered villainess was getting cuter and cuter.\nThen I spoke to Shael, who still didn’t get the clue.\n“She is a person who really likes dessert. She really loves the desserts I make to death.”\n“…”\nShael, who was ignorant, didn’t understand what I was saying this time as well.\nShe just spoke with a dissatisfied expression, “If you marry a bi*ch like that, you will become a slave who only makes dessert!”\nWould I end up being used as a dessert slave in the future?\nIt didn’t matter.\nAs long as Shael enjoys it, I can make her any number of desserts.\nAh, of course, for Shael’s health, I will have to make them in moderation.\nBy the way, Shael called the girl ‘a bi*ch’. She was unintentionally cursing herself!\nI looked at Shael, and laughed, then I tried to make it even more obvious.\n“Sometimes she’s really cute when she speaks a lot of nonsense.”\n“What’s so cute about speaking nonsense?”\nShael sounded really dissatisfied. At the same time, I heard a faint whimper.\nNow Shael even started to cry!\n‘Isn’t this really bad?’\nShael was more ignorant than I thought!\nSo, in order for Shael to notice it right away, I gave a huge clue.\n“She is also the girl who is always by my side.”\n“…”\n“She is still with me.”\nAt this point, even a braindead fool would notice.\nIf the girl was with me right now, it could only be Shael. So Shael must have noticed by now.\nI waited for Shael to say something.\nAfter some time, Shael finally opened her mouth, “Is it the… female knight from the Baslett family?”\nA female knight from the Baslett family? How could that be possible?\nI could only sigh.\nAnd, as I was about to tell her the truth, Shael spoke without giving me a chance to open my mouth.\n“Don’t cheat!”\nThen she glared at me.\nLooking at it now, the girl I love was… really very ignorant.\nGoblin:\nThis month is proving to be a really difficult one, but I can see a way out in the next month.

      "content": "“Don’t cheat on me!”\nThose words from the tearful Shael made me go silent. Don’t cheat… it was quite an amusing thing to say.\n“I don’t think…”\nI tried to tell Shael that I had no reason to cheat, but I couldn’t even finish what I wanted to say.\nBecause Shael shoved one of her cupcakes into my mouth.\nAt the same time, I heard Shael’s harsh voice, “Shut your mouth!”\n“…”\nI mean, I couldn’t even open it anyway. It was thanks to someone putting sugar-covered cupcakes in my mouths. It was so sweet that it made me frown,\n‘Just how much sugar did she put in?’\nNow that it was in my mouth and I was able to taste it, it seemed that Shael had added not only sugar but also other seasonings without my knowledge. I could taste the strange combination of flavors that couldn’t be expressed in words.\nBecause of that, I couldn’t speak any more. So for now, I decided to listen to Shael’s complaints.\n“There were times when we went out together.”\nShael began to complain about her pent up resentment.\nHer reason was simple.\nIn Shael’s mind, I was the cheating bad fiancee.\nBy the way… have we ever gone out together? Even though it was somewhat true, it made me laugh.\nShael was talking as if we went out together because we were in a special relationship.\nAnyways, after barely swallowing the cupcake she had shoved into my mouth, I said, “Originally, if you are a normal person, you go out together even if you are not in a special relationship.”\n“We are not normal people.” Shael retorted.\nThat was right as well. Because the villainess’s way of thinking was far from that of normal people.\nIn the past, Shael would never go out with anyone other than her family. No, the number of times she went out with her family could be counted on one hand.\nBut I couldn’t figure out why I was included in it.\nShael added, “I even hugged you.”\n“…”\nIndeed, we did that a few times.\nThe first time was in Azbel family’s garden, when she suddenly pushed me against the wall.\nNext, she unexpectedly hugged me when I woke up after being unconscious for 15 days.\nAnd right after Shael hugged me, I had hugged her as well.\nI couldn’t say anything this time because it was true. I was just waiting for an opportunity to tell her the truth.\nMaybe Shael took my silence as my inability to refute her words? So she continued to spit out random nonsense.\n“We’ve even spent one night together…”\nIt was an extremely embarrassing thing to say. I mean, Shael’s face was already blushing red.\nIt was fortunate that the Baslett Mansion had good soundproofing.\nAnd, of course, what Shael said this time was true as well. But I felt that it was really unfair to me.\n“I didn’t do anything.”\n“Liar!.”\nI looked at Shael with visible confusion. Why would I be lying?\nBut, Shael confidently said, “You slept… while hugging me.”\nIt was the opposite!\nIt was she who mistook me for her doll and hugged me! Not the other way around!\nClearly, Shael was trying to accuse me with a really selfish mindset.\nThe problem was… even that seemed extremely cute.\nIt was a strange way of thinking.\nI seem to have changed quite a lot.\nSince I was laughing, Shael said with an anxious expression, “I even confessed to you!”\n“Yes?”\nI was sure that was something that had never been heard before. Has Shael ever confessed to me?\nIt couldn’t be true!\nThat had to be the case!\nIf Shael really confessed to me… there was no way I’d ever forget it.\nBut Shael answered my question. Before I knew it, my magic pouch was in Shael’s hand.\n“…”\nWhat Shael took out of my magic pouch was a serpent orb, and after taking a moment to prepare herself to face the shame, she activated it.\n[I like you.]\n[I love you.]\nShe let the recording play out a few times, then turned it off in annoyance. Then she looked at me as if she wanted an answer from me.\n“Is that… a confession?”\nShael nodded her head.\nShe did it under the effect of the Tree of Obedience Sap, and she did it under my command.\nIt was absurd to call it a confession.\n‘Is she doing all this because her sla*ve who will give her desserts for the rest of her life was about to escape?’\nSo I said to Shael, “Can that even be considered as a confession?”\nWith those words, I looked at Shael.\nIt was fact that even Shael couldn’t deny.\nBut Shael made a really sad expression.\nWhile I was taken aback, she said, “Have you been just playing with me?”\nThe atmosphere suddenly changed.\nI wondered if I should just tell her the truth— that she had misunderstood.\nBut, that probably wouldn’t work.\nGoblin:\nMy Dear Patron!

      "content": "In the first place, I wanted to convey my true feelings in a perfect atmosphere. If I said it now, I was pretty sure that Shael would dismiss my words as lies.\nInstead, I spoke to Shael, “How can I do that? I was always serious about you!”\nIt has been like that since the very beginning. Even after I cursed at her and began my retaliation.\nI mean, how can I not be serious when dealing with Shael?\nAnd so, I waited for Shael’s reaction.\nShael, who was holding her breath, spoke to me, “Then, why did you have an affair with that female knight!”\nAt Shael’s accusation, I wiped the cold sweat that was dripping down my forehead.\nThe villainess really had a strong power of imagination. In her mind, the nonexistent female knight of the Baslett family had become a real person!\nSo, I quickly tried to clear up Shael’s misunderstanding.\n“I have never had an affair with a female knight!”\nHowever, Shael immediately found a loophole in my words.\n“If it’s not a female knight…is she a maid from the Baslett family?”\nOf course it couldn’t be like that!\nAnyways, I decided to be direct, so that she wouldn't misunderstand anymore,\n“Lately, I haven’t talked to any woman except for you.”\nIt was true.\nI had been so busy with my training and planning that I didn’t have the time to talk to any woman other than Shael. Except for the time I met Shael, my schedule was really packed to the brim.\nAll I had been doing were practicing my swordsmanship, training my magic, cooking for Shael, and reading books to gather more information.\nExcept for Clie, whom I had talked with through the bracelet a long time ago, I hadn’t really talked to any other woman.\nThe conversation with Clie was an important matter for both my and Shael’s survival. So I had to do that.\nMaybe this time Shael would understand my meaning?\nI’ve never had a conversation with any woman except for her. Then who would be the woman I love?\nBut Shael didn’t notice.\n“I guess so.”\n“Yes, what?”\nI had no choice but to express my doubts about Shael’s remark.\nThat’s right, it was as if Shael had expected it from the start!\nAnd then, I finally understood the reason why.\nThe Ring of Mutual Restriction. It was the ring Shael and I shared.\nThe ring allowed one to set as many restrictions as one wished so that the target wouldn’t be able to communicate with the opposite sex, except for the person wearing the other ring.\n“It’s not that you didn’t talk, it’s just that you couldn’t. It’s because I’ve put a restriction on you from talking to any other woman.”\nHonestly, I was at a loss for words. I never dreamed that things would turn out like this.\nWho would have predicted such a situation?\nAs expected, no one would!\nI remained silent with a puzzled expression on my face.\nThen Shael spoke, “And because of that, are you talking to me about the woman you love?”\n[Because you couldn’t take the ring off without my permission.]\nI could tell that's what she wanted to say.\nI looked at Shael, and saw the good old smirk of a villainess.\nIt was the same smile she showed when she used to bully me. It was a smile I hadn’t seen in a while.\nShael continued to say, “Don’t worry.”\n“…”\n“Because I will never allow it!”\nThen she revealed the sneer of a classic villainess.\nNo, it was quite different from usual. Before I knew it, it had become a grin of a snake!\nI used to be the villainess’s nemesis in the past, but not anymore.\nAt the moment, my nemesis was Shael.\n“No.”\nI no longer cared about the right mood, and tried to open my mouth, determined to tell the truth—\n‘the woman I love is you!’\nI was going to say that… but I couldn’t. Because Shael shoved another cupcake in my mouth.\nI hurriedly chewed the cupcake and tried to tell Shael my true feelings.\nBut I couldn’t.\nThe cupcake Shael gave me was overly sweet, more than the cupcake I ate earlier.\n“Water, some water…”\nCoughing continuously, I drank the water Shael handed to me. Then I barely managed to calm my mind and tried to tell Shael the truth.\n‘The woman I love is you!’\nI wasn’t able to open my mouth as well.\nBecause I suddenly began to feel extremely drowsy.\nI looked up to see Shael’s smiling face.\nIt was then that I remembered something. I was a conversation we had in the past.\n[What kind of medicine is that?]\n[A dr*ug that will knock anyone out.]\nI had a hunch. That the water I drank had that dr*ug in it!\nIsn’t that too harsh to use that on someone who was unconscious for 15 days?\nWell, I did play a joke on Shael first.\nBut fortunately, she bought the dr*ug at the auction house, so there shouldn’t be any problems with my health.\nI was certain about that fact, since Shael would’ve never used it on me otherwise.\nBut that didn’t matter at all.\nI looked at Shael’s smile and fell in love with her all over again.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also motivate me by sponsoring chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "I woke up feeling really stiff, and unable to see anything.\nBecause something was covering my eyes, and my whole body was tied up!\nIt was a similar to the time when Shael had tied me up to steal the serpent orb.\nAdditionally, I couldn’t say anything because there was something stuffed in my mouth.\nFortunately, my ears were free.\nAs I slightly moved my body, I heard Shael’s voice.\n“Ah, are you awake?”\n“…”\nI remained silent, because there was something stuffed in my mouth. And Shael’s following words made me even more bewildered.\n“If you are awake, talk to me.”\n“…”\nMy whole body was tied up, and I couldn’t even move my mouth. So how do you expect me to do that?\n“Ah!”\nFortunately, Shael noticed her stupid mistake and took off the blindfold.\nI sent a signal to remove the thing stuffed in my mouth, but…\n“No.”\nShael directly refused.\nI wanted to clear up the misunderstanding right away, but thanks to this situation, I think I’ll have to put it off.\nThodd!\nIt was the sound of Shael closing a book.\nThe book was quite thick, and I was unable to read the title of the book.\n‘Why is she reading a book?’\nIt wasn’t long before I got the answer. Because Shael suddenly approached me and reached out her hand.\nPat!\nIt was the sound of Shael putting her hand on my head.\nFrom the way Shael’s arms trembled, I could tell how nervous she was.\nFrom the way her face turned red, it was clear that Shael was feeling ashamed of such an act\nThen, I heard Shael say.\n“You did well.”\n‘What on earth did I do well?’\nWhat’s with that sudden and unexpected compliment!\nAnyways, after that awkward compliment, Shael started continued patting me.\nAnd so, I noticed right away. It was definitely something Shael had learned from that strange book!\n“How does it feel?” Shael asked.\nOf course I couldn’t answer. Because I still had the cloth stuffed in my mouth.\nSo I winked at her, and fortunately Shael finally took it out.\nFinally, I was able to speak!\n“Now, if you untie me too…”\n“Please answer first.” Shael insisted.\nAnd, I answered at once, “It felt pretty good.”\n“Is that so?”\nIndeed, it felt really good to have my head stroked by Shael. Although I also felt that I was being treated like a pet.\n“Pretty good isn’t enough.”\n“Heh?”\nShael suddenly stood up from her seat and grabbed the book she was reading before.\nShreeet!\nAnd tore off a page from the book!\n‘Why is she doing that?’\nMoreover, that book must have been from the Baslett family’s library.\nI kept my silence as I watched Shael’s violent actions.\nTime passed, as Shael continued to flip through the book, then she suddenly stopped.\nShael hesitantly opened her mouth, and I heard her trembling voice.\n“Today…”\n“…?”\n“You look cute…”\nEventually, Shael shut her mouth, as her body trembled with shame.\nSoon after that, she tore off another page from the book again!\nThen, Shael took a deep breath and tried to relax.\nSo I said to Shael right away, “Now untie the rope.”\n“…”\nShael looked worried. At the same time, I noticed that her expression looked a bit sad.\nThe serpent-like smile she showed me while giving me the dr*ug just now was gone.\n“…”\nI took a careful look at the silent Shael.\nShe seemed as if she would start crying at any moment.\nShael must have been worried about me, who was passed out for 15 days. Because when I woke up, she reflexively hugged me.\nThen she suddenly found out that her fiance was cheating on her. Of course, that was just an illusion stemming from Shael’s misunderstanding.\nAnyways, it was a situation where anyone would be sad.\nIn fact, it even made her cry!\nI really didn’t want to say it while being tied up with a rope. But I didn’t care anymore.\nThe thing that was most important to me was Shael, not my pride.\nTherefore, I hastily spoke up before Shael’s expression changed even further.\n“Do you love my desserts?”\n“…?”\nShael tilted her head in confusion at my sudden question. But, despite that sudden question, Shael, who loved to eat dessert to death, just nodded her head.\nAt the same time, I recalled the conversation we had before Shael tied me up.\n[She is a person who really likes dessert. She really loves the desserts I make to death.]\nI thought about that conversation and said to Shael, “You really like my dessert.”\nShael nodded her head, as if to say ‘why are you suddenly asking me this?’\nBut I continued before Shael could even put it into words.\n“You have a very bad temper.”\n[First of all, she has a very bad temper.]\nIt was another one of the things I had said before passing out.\nShael frowned at me.\nAnyone would react that way if someone said something like that to their face.\n“What are you saying…”\n“Still, you’ve become much kinder these days.”\nShe helped me with cooking, which she clearly wasn’t very good at.\nShe felt sad for me, who had fainted for 15 days.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also motivate me by sponsoring chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "I was sure that the villainess Shael had changed.\nThat cruel villainess had become a girl complaining about love before she knew it.\nSo a good girl needed a reward.\nTherefore, I spoke to Shael while recalling the conversation I had with her before.\n“Sometimes you do really cute things.”\n[Sometimes she’s really cute when she speaks a lot of nonsense.]\nShael suddenly looked down. Her face turned red in embarrassment. No matter how ignorant she was, my words should have reminded her of our conversation from a while ago.\nOf course, I had no intention of waiting for her to panic. So I said right away.\n“You have always been by my side.”\n[She is also the girl who is always by my side.]\nShael was always in my mind. In order to rehabilitate the troublesome villainess, I put in an immense amount of effort. And that effort didn’t end in vain. As a result of my sincere efforts, the villainess had now changed.\nThinking of that, I opened my mouth to add, “I plan to be by your side in the future as well.”\n“…”\nShael sighed.\nAfter giving her some time to calm down, I said, “Do you understand now? The girl I love is…”\nA girl who liked my dessert and had a bad temper. A girl who was sometimes cute and always by my side.\n“Not a female knight from the Baslett family.”\n“…”\n“She’s not even the Baslett family’s maid.”\nThen who could it be? There was only one.\nThe girl that captivated me from the time I first read the novel. So I said it clearly, as if reciting her name.\n“She is Shael from the Azbel family.”\n“Ah!”\nMy fate after I came to this world… no, my fate from the distant past was finally bearing fruit.\nThe journey wasn’t a pleasant one. I went through many unfortunate things, and I made Shael feel sad.\nI also went through a lot of hardships.\nFrom the training that went on every single day, to the bullying of the villainess.\nBut I didn’t give in.\nRather, I just kept doing my best. Even though the process was never smooth.\nSo, obviously, the ending would be perfect. I was sure of that.\n“That…”\nMy heart pounded when I heard Shael’s words. Then I looked up at Shael, holding my breath, unable to calm down. Seeing Shael’s cute face made me laugh like an idiot.\nShael’s face had turned bright red in contrast to her light blue hair.\nHer face was representing her feelings. Shael felt the same way as me!\nI was relieved by that fact and asked while glancing at the rope that was still tying me, “Could you please release me?”\n“Do… don…”\nShael muttered incoherently. Of course, she knew that my words were the truth, without any lies.\n“Don’t lie…”\nNevertheless, she claimed that my words were lies. It was probably because she was feeling shy.\nI had already expected such a situation. But what Shael said after that was something I had never expected.\n“…”\nShael took a deep breath, as she was preparing herself for something important.\n“I think I love you too.”\nShe thought that she loved me.\nShe was far from being direct, but it was very much a Shael-like confession.\nOf course, I was satisfied with Shael’s confession.\nI never thought that Shael would express her feelings so quickly.\n“…”\nShael looked at me. She wasn’t glaring at me like she usually did.\nI also turned my gaze to Shael, and Shael turned her head away.\nI though back to the old memories. It the time when I first met Shael after coming to this world.\n[I don’t want to see you, so please stare at the wall today..]\n[Yes.]\nThe villainess had turned her head away saying she didn’t want to see me.\nBut it was different now.\nShe didn’t turn head away because she didn’t want to see me.\nIt was because she wanted to hide her blushing face.\nI could tell by looking at Shael, who was looking sideways at me.\nHer face was definitely red.\nLooking at Shael, I again though about our past.\n[Shut up bit*ch!]\nThere was a time when I cursed at her, and called her a bit*ch. I even threatened to sew up her mouth with my sword.\nIt was the worst beginning for a relationship between lovers.\nI mean, what kind of lovers would have started from a relationship where they cursed at each other?\nBut there was a saying, and it suited us quite well.\n“There is a saying that you become attached after fighting.”\nShael’s eyes widened, then she smiled, and replied as if she sympathized with my words.\n“We fought quite a lot.”\nThat’s right. Because the fights with the villainess were quite terrifying.\nBut thanks to that, Shael and I were able to build a strong bond.\nAnd from now on, it was time to explore our accumulated affection.\nGoblin:\nThe next few chapters are so sweet that even I, a half-dead person chuckled to myself.

      "content": "An awkward silence.\nJust a moment ago, I was appreciating the excellent soundproofing of the Baslett Estate. But not anymore.\nIn the silent and calm atmosphere, the awkward situation with Shael continued.\n“…”\nShael looked at me.\nI also looked at Shael, but that was only for a moment.\nAs soon as our eyes met, we turned our heads away.\nFinding the situation unbearable, I decided to change the subject, “Please, untie the rope first.”\n“Ah!”\nFortunately, Shael untied the rope without any objections, and I was finally able to freely move my aching body.\nAs I was stretching my body, Shael asked, “Now, what should we do?”\nI wanted to ask that question as well.\nWe had just confirmed each other’s feelings.\nAfter I conveyed my feelings, Shael also did the same, and now we were officially lovers.\nSo what should we do next?\nWhat should I do?\n“Should we do the things lovers usually do?”\n“…”\nWhat do ordinary lovers usually do?\nGoing out together, holding hands, hugging and kissing.\nAnd, except for one of them, Shael and I had already done them all, and more!\nStill, it would be better to try them again step by step from the beginning.\nAfter thinking about it, I suggested it to Shael, “First of all, how about holding hands?”\nI thought it was the most normal thing that lovers did.\nIn fact, Shael and I had already held hands.\nBut now, it would be different. Because now, we would be doing it as real lovers.\n“Hold hands?”\n“Yes, let’s do that”\nShael looked at my hand and spoke with a shy expression, “That’s… too early.”\n“…”\nWas it too early?\nI didn’t know. No, in the first place, didn’t we hold hands several times before?\nAnyways, I still nodded. Because I wanted to respect Shael’s opinion.\n“Then, what should we do?”\n“Let’s say greet each other first.”\nGreet each other? It was the most basic thing people did while meeting a stranger.\nI didn’t know if it was normal to suddenly greet each other in this situation, but… since Shael wanted to do it, I could only agree to it.\nSo I cleared my throat a few times and opened my mouth, “Nice to meet you?”\n“No.”\nNo?\nShael shook her head in response to my greeting, which I did with great difficulty, bearing a great amount of shame.\nWhen I looked at Shael with doubt, Shael pointed to the door and said, “Do it right. Go out and come in.”\n“Okay.”\nIt was strange, but it would be a pain to say otherwise.\nKikiiik!\nAs Shael said, I opened the door and went out. Then, after taking a few deep breaths, I went back into the room.\nKikiiik!\n“Welcome…”\nI got nervous at Shael’s trembling voice.\nIt was the first time I had heard Shael say welcome.\nWhen I thought back to the past, the voice of the villainess always sounded very cold.\n[You’re late.]\nShe would say that even if I wasn’t late. That’s how the villainess used to greet me.\nSo now, hearing Shael’s new way of greeting, I couldn’t help but feel an entirely different feeling from before.\n“Long time no see.”\nObviously, I couldn't make her wait. So I reflexively said that.\nIt was a very awkward greeting.\nIt’s just a greeting, but I felt very nervous.\nI mean, it was normal to be that way, considering that we were quite unique as lovers.\nWe went out together and held hands.\nWe hugged each other and slept in the same bed.\n‘Now that I think about it…’\nWe’ve never had a proper greeting. It was something that anyone would find funny.\nShael seemed to have recalled the past as well, as she smiled and said, “Please have a seat.”\nI sat down on the chair as instructed. Then I waited for Shael to say something, but she didn’t.\nShael, who looked nervous, remained silent with a blushing face.\nSo, I had to take the initiative again.\n“What do we do now?”\n“How would I know?”\nWell, Shael must be a stranger when it came to relationships. But it was the same for me as well.\nSo the silence continued.\nIn the end, it was Shael who opened her mouth first.\n“I read in a book that couples exchange passionate glances with each other.”\nAs soon as she finished her words, Shael looked at me intently.\nI, too, stared at her, and said, “Like this?”\n“I don’t think so.” Said Shael and turned her head away.\nI could understand how she was feeling.\nIt felt like being tickled.\nIt was a completely different sensation, where even looking at each other seemed unbearable.\n[What are you staring at?]\n[You’re doing something strange again, it’s pathetic!]\nI recalled the memories of the past. Back then, we stared at each other as well.\nActually, it was more glaring than looking, but now… we couldn’t even do that properly.\nBecause whenever I looked at Shael, I felt ashamed for some reason.\nOf course, I did have the capacity to endure that much.\nBut with just how cute Shael was behaving at the moment, it was honestly quite difficult.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also motivate me by sponsoring chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "I looked at Shael again.\nHer body was slightly trembling, which showed just how embarrassed she was.\nHonestly, she like a cute little animal.\n‘Have I fallen for Shael that much?’\nI smiled at that thought and said to Shael, “There is no need to rush. We have lots of time.”\nBut Shael didn’t seem to like what I said and she looked at me with a frown on her face.\n“No, I will definitely succeed.”\n“Alright then…”\nI looked at her again without hesitation.\nShael turned her head away again. It was a typical Shael-like behavior.\n“Again!”\nThen she turned her head to look at me again.\nI also returned a passionate gaze to Shael.\nThis time, Shael didn’t turn her head away like before. She was so embarrassed to meet my gaze that she turned her whole body!\nThen she said again, “Do it again…”\nWe were at a fairly close distance as Shael and my gaze met each other.\nJust before, we couldn’t hold on for even 30 seconds and failed…but this attempt was quite different.\nIt was a result of Shael and my excellent determination!\nTime passed by faster than before.\n“Isn’t this considered enough?”\n“Hmmn…looks like it worked.”\nShael had clearly reached her limit.\nNormally, I would have made fun of Shael, but…I also nodded my head.\nI decided to refrain from doing so because I made Shael feel sad earlier.\nIn fact, I myself was reaching my limit.\nIt was quite difficult to look at Shael from so close. Specially after confirming each other’s feelings, it was rather difficult for me to deal with her.\nBecause of that, I tried to pass the time by talking.\nBut, perhaps she didn’t have enough yet, Shael opened her mouth to say, “Can we hold hand now?”\n“Didn’t you just say that it was too early?”\n“If you don’t like it, then don’t.”\nOf course, I would like it! But I was overthinking too much.\nWe became a pair of foolish lovers after confirming each other’s feelings.\nWe had a hard time greeting each other, and we barely even managed to make eye contact.\nAnd now, to hold hands right away. Of course it would be difficult!\nShael, who didn’t think that much, confidently said, “Grab it.”\nShael handed over the responsibility to me. I did what she said, and stretched out my hand.\nUnlike before, when we held hands without hesitation, I acted very slowly and cautiously.\nAnd, I failed to hold her hand. Because before my hand could even reach her, Shael took her hand away.\n“Can’t you do that faster?”\n“…”\n“Don’t act like a coward!”\nI don’t want to hear that from the person who had just taken back her hand.\nBut still, I didn’t scold Shael.\nThe reason why Shael took her hand away wasn’t because she hated it.\nI could tell from her blushing face, and her trembling hands.\nI smiled at that fact and asked Shael, “Can you do it?”\n“Of course I can!”\n“Then, let’s try it”\nAs Shael extended her hand, I withdraw mine. The roles had changed from before.\nSo, there was no way Shael could succeed in holding my hand.\nAnd, as expected, Shael groaned.\n“…”\n“What are you doing?” I asked.\n“…”\nShael glared at me in response.\nFinding the situation quite amusing, I said, “You also couldn’t look at me properly just a moment ago.”\n“…”\n“You’re just glaring at me now.”\n“You took your hand away!”\nI didn’t.\nAnyways, her trembling had finally stopped.\nSo I extended my hand towards Shael instead. Then our hands which I thought would never reach, connected with each other.\n“Ah…”\nBut that was only for a moment. Because Shael blushed and took her hand away again.\nI, too, trembled for some reason due to Shael’s nervousness.\nIt was a really frustrating situation. No one should go through such a difficult process for just holding hands.\nAnyways, I was aware that the situation between Shael and me wasn’t normal. It was difficult for us to even look at each other. So, it was indeed quite funny.\nWhile I was looking at Shael, I heard her voice.\n“Stop staring!”\n“Okay.”\nAt the same time, Shael turned her head away again.\nIt was also for a simple reason…because she was feeling shy.\nI wanted to hold Shael’s hand and hug her right away, but…I managed to endure it.\nGoing too fast was not necessarily a good thing.\nAbove all, it would be fun to remove Shael’s shyness step by step.\nActually, even I felt a bit ashamed.\n“…”\nShael, who had turned her head the other way before, looked at me as I was lost in my thoughts.\nThen I woke up and met Shael’s eyes, causing her to avert her gaze again.\nThis was a funny situation.\nIt was also a frustrating situation.\nAnd above all, it was a very happy situation.\nWe became a pair of fools…the happiest fools in the world.\nAt the same time, we were fools who loved each other more than anything else.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can, and you can also support me at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "I said to Shael, who I had caught staring at me once again.\n“Do you want to go out with me? I heard that there is an art gallery that opened recently.”\nI had conveyed the feelings in my heart, and also confirmed Shael’s feelings as well.\nIt might have seemed frustrating in the eyes of others, but I was able to express my affection for Shael at long last, and the process was both simple and… very difficult.\nSo now, I wanted to take a walk outside with Shael. Because I wanted to enjoy the changes in our relationship with Shael.\nTo be honest, I didn’t have that much time in my hands to keep playing like this.\nBecause, the Crown Prince, the Mage Tower Lord, and Clie— those three beings would surely threaten both my and Shael’s future.\nPerhaps Clie had lost her powers. I could tell just from the fact that nothing happened to Baslett and Azbel families while I was unconscious.\nHowever, there was no guarantee that there would be no other threats. The Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince both had great influence as well as personal strength. Additionally, Clie also had excellent personal connections.\nAnd they were not the only things I had to worry about. There were many cheat-like items that would appear in the future, and they were all powerful enough to threaten Shael’s safety.\nMoreover, an Imperial Festival would be held soon. And the rewards from any kind of competition would always be extremely powerful items.\nFor example, the love potion. If two people drank that thing, it was an elixir powerful enough to make them fall in love!\nThe reason why they were giving away such a dangerous item as a reward for the Imperial Festival was simple— it was a competition. It was a competition to show off the participant’s love.\nAnyways, I didn’t want the love potion to fall into the wrong hands.\nSo first, I needed to make a plan.\nIf Clie got her hands on the potion, that would be a matter of great trouble.\nI didn’t think that Shael and I would ever feel the need to drink that potion. Because from now on, I would never be separated from her.\nBut even so, the potion was a threat. It would be a big issue if Clie managed to seduce not only the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince, but also some other powerful person.\nIf that happened, the situation would be hopeless.\nI had to use the pearl during my confrontation with Clie before.\nAnd, it allowed me to travel to a point exactly three days prior to the event. Of course, the pearl had disappeared after I had used it. So now, I had nothing I could call a ‘backup’.\nFortunately, Clie couldn’t steal the love potion in advance. As the reward of the Imperial Festival, it would be directly under the protection of the Mage Tower and the Imperial family.\nFurthermore, according to the novel, they would only give the love potion away after the Imperial Festival was over. So the love potion probably hadn’t even arrived in the Empire yet.\nI just hoped that Clie wouldn’t steal the love potion before then.\nSo, until the Imperial Festival began, I was planning to spend a happy time with Shael.\nI also instructed the servants to inform Duke Jespen that I had woken up, so that he wouldn’t worry.\nAnyways, when I asked if she would like to go out, Shael questioned, “Isn’t it raining?”\nCertainly, as Shael said, it was raining outside… but I didn’t want to stay in the mansion.\nMaybe it was because I was stuck in bed for 15 days, my body felt quite stiff.\nThat’s why I took Shael and left the Baslett family’s mansion with an umbrella in my hand.\nThrough the pouring raindrops, Shael and I walked with our bodies protected under one umbrella.\nShrrrrrr!\nThe rain started getting stronger, and I soon found out that one umbrella wouldn’t be enough.\nI could use magic, but…I didn’t bother.\nI was my first date with Shael after confirming our feelings. I wanted to make Shael’s heart flutter as much as possible.\n‘What do the main characters in novels usually do at times like this?’\nAsking that in my head, I used the umbrella to protect Shael as much as I could.\nI wanted to make sure that not a single raindrop would fall on Shael.\nAs a result, my right shoulder got drenched right away.\nIt worked, as Shael hurriedly asked, “What are you doing?”\nThen she added with a dissatisfied expression, “Why are you acting so stupid!”\nHer beloved was covering her with an umbrella in the rain instead of himself!\nWasn’t she supposed to feel emotional?\nI really didn’t know.\nSimilar to Shael, I was also someone who learned about love through books.\nShael opened her mouth again, “It’s raining, so come closer.”\nMy heart skipped a beat when I saw her blushing her face.\nI wanted to make Shael’s heart flutter… but she made my hear flutter instead.\nI was taken aback by her cute reaction and Shael, who noticed my condition, got closer to me.\n“…”\nThe sound of loud rain was supposed to bring good fortune, but despite that, the atmosphere became quite awkward.\nAs if she wanted to get rid of the awkwardness, Shael spoke up, “I’m bored.”\n“Then, would you like to continue what we were doing before?”\nThe art museum, which was our destination, was still quite far away.\nSo, what more could I suggest to Shael?\nIt was to do the thing that lovers would do.\nShael asked in bewilderment, “What should we do?”\n“Would you like to hold my arm?”\nIn fact, she had already held my arm once before. It was back when Clie was following us.\nOf course, it was obvious that it would be difficult to do that now.\n“This… like this?”\nInstead of holding my arm, Shael, who had become timid, placed her only fingers on my forearm.\nI smiled and teased her, “Where did that brave personality from before go?”\nFrom holding hands to holding arms, we continued to go through such hardships.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Now that’s frustrating.\nNo matter how many times I make a move on Shael, she ends up hesitating because of her shyness.\nSo I decided to use my most effective weapon, “If you do it right, I will give you desserts.”\nI still had the leftover desserts from before in my magic pouch.\nOf course Shael wanted to eat them as well, but…\n[Let me eat.]\n[No!]\nEating too much deserts would be bad for her health.\nI thought that Shael would immediately grab my arm, but…nothing happened at all.\nShael cleared her throat and asked, “Dessert…?”\n“That’s right. I’ll give you the dessert I put in the magic pouch.”\nNow hold on…I think Shael’s voice sounded strangely nervous for some reason.\n‘Could it be…?’\nTo prove my guess, I quickly checked the magic pouch in my hand.\nThe leftover desserts were all gone!\n“…”\n“That…”\nI think something similar like this happened before. Shael had finished all the dessert in the short time that I went to the bathroom in the past.\nAnd, it was the same this time as well. During the short time I was unconscious, all the leftover desserts went into Shael’s stomach.\nAny, for the time being, I decided to remain calm, cool, and collected.\nI would just have to do something without the desserts!\nI had made many mistakes lately, so I didn’t want to do this…but if Shael’s health depended on it, I had no other choice!\nShael understood the meaning of my expression and said. “Between us…”\n“…”\n“Why should we differentiate between what’s yours and mine?”\nNow where did that Shael who couldn’t even hold my hand because she was embarrassed go?\nThis Shael, who secretly ate all the dessert, was easily spitting out cheesy embarrassing words.\nEven with that excuse, I didn’t show any signs of being persuaded.\nSo Shael fell into a dilemma and muttered, “Normally, it would have been enough to convince you…”\n“Is that so?”\n‘I’m sorry, but I am doing this for your own good, so that you wouldn’t eat so much desserts.’\nI would have to punish her for eating the deserts sooner or later.\nCome to think of it, there was indeed something suitable.\n‘Should I try mint chocolate?’\nI disliked it a lot, no I hated it. So, I wanted to feed Shael as well.\nIt was unlikely that such a thing would exist in this world, but if I create it, it should be enough.\n“I will serve you a new dish soon…as a gift.” I told Shael, hoping for my sweet revenge.\nAfter a while, we saw the art gallery, which was our destination.\nI entered the art gallery expecting to spend a happy time with Shael.\n***\n[Clie’s POV]\nTung!\nClie kicked a stone on the ground. It was the expression of just how angry she was.\nEven though she only kicked a small stone, her ankle hurt quite a lot.\nShe was annoyed at her own sick body, which was the source of her suffering. Her body had become very strong after she obtained the bracelet of holy power.\nNow that was a thing of the past. Because the bracelet of holy power was destroyed.\nIt was Eran Baslett’s doing.\nWhat’s more, even her only chance to cure the disease was taken away.\n“…”\nThe imperial family was very busy with all sorts of events that would be organized in the future, and there was currently a power struggle in the Mage Tower. So she was having a hard time with meeting the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.\nNo, in fact, she was avoiding them.\nIf she met the Crown Prince, then she would have to spend time with the imperial family for a while.\nThe fact that the Mage Tower Lord was in love with Clie was a fact known to all the mages of the Mage Tower. And, the Mage Tower was full of people who hated the man. So, spending time with the Mage Tower Lord, who had many enemies was also a bad decision.\nBecause of that, Clie wasn’t able to do anything for a while.\n‘The Love Potion…’\nIt was her only chance to get revenge on Eran Baslett.\nThe Imperial Festival was not that far away, so Clie could only wait for that.\n‘What if I contacted the Crown Prince or the Mage Tower Lord and told them to find the potion, or inform them of the existence of the love potion?’\nIt was obvious how things would go.\nIf that happened, they would make her drink the potion instead.\nSo Clie came up with a set of plans.\n‘First of all, it’s necessary to become friendly with various powerful people…and, I have to do something about my illness, and take care of my body.’\nSo Clie gathered up her patience and came to the zoo in the Azbel territory.\nThe zoo had animals that purified the mana in the air, and because of that, it had the purest mana in the empire.\nThere was no other place that healed Clie more than the zoo belonging to the Azbel Family.\nKeww!\nSuddenly, she heard a deeply unpleasant sound. It belonged to a very cute looking puppy with pure white fur.\nDespite being so cute, it was kept in a sturdy cage, tied to a leash and placed in a corner.\nOf course, that wasn’t the only reason Clie disliked the puppy.\n“What a stupid thing.”\nEven thought Clie’s mind was exhausted, she could still sense the unpleasant magic of the Azbel family from the little beast.\nIt was clear that someone with Azbel blood had cast a spell on the little beast.\nTung!\nTak!\nFeeling even more annoyed, Clie kicked a stone on the ground, and it directly hit the little beast in the cage.\nClie, who was watching the puppy from a short distance, frowned; wondering why they used such a sturdy cage to confine such a measly beast.\nHowever, she soon lost interest, then she turned around and tried to leave the place.\nKrrrrrrawghh!\nSuddenly, Clie heard a loud sound that was incomparable to that of a moment ago.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Shael and I arrived at the art gallery located in the Baslett’s territory. Then, we began to appreciate the numerous paintings on display.\nShael, who was looking at the painting beside me, said, “If I draw this, it would be much better.”\n“Is that so?”\nI was sure that her personality had gotten a lot better, but…she was still Shael, who seems to have a little bit of a villainous side to her. But even that seemed cute to me now. I felt like I had been brainwashed by Shael’s cuteness.\n“I kind of like this painting.”\n“…”\nI turned my head in anticipation to see just what kind of painting managed to satisfy Shael.\nIt was a painting of some delicious-looking cupcakes.\nShael was pointing at it, while showering it with praise. At the same time, she looked at me earnestly.\nI could immediately figure out what Shael she was getting at.\n“Even if you look at it like that, you will get no desserts for a while.”\n“Why?”\n“You should think about your health.”\nEven in a world with fantastical magic, there was no magic that could cure a disease completely.\nSo, for Shael’s health, it was necessary to ban desserts for a while.\nShael, who noticed my strong will, asked, “Even if I do this?”\nShael tilted her head and reached out to hold my hand. It was an extremely cute gesture.\nLooking at her blushing face, it was easy to guess how difficult that action must have been for Shael.\nOf course, considering her health depended on it, there was no way Shael’s cuteness would work on me!\nSo I decided to go on the offensive and spat out words that was most likely to hit Shael’s pride, “You’ll get fat.”\n“…!”\nOf course, that was one of the things Shael doesn’t want to hear the most.\nAnyways, leaving the trembling Shael behind, I pointed at a painting and said, “I see a painting I like, so let’s move.”\nHowever, that casually spoken word was a fatal mistake. The painting I was pointing to was a portrait of another woman.\n“Do you like that woman?” Shael asked, pointing to the woman in the painting.\nThe woman in the painting had red hair, with nice features. She was indeed a beauty. She gave off an impression that was the complete opposite of Shael, who used to be a villainess.\nSince I said I liked the portrait of that woman, of course Shael wouldn’t be in a good mood.\n“It was a joke.”\n“I don’t think you were joking.” Shael said with a rough voice, and glared at me with a frown on her face.\nIt was the visage of a villainess I hadn’t seen in a long time.\nI broke out in a cold sweat and said to Shael, “How can I like another woman?”\n“You just said that.”\nBefore I could make an excuse, Shael added, “Now I know what kind of woman my fiance prefers.”\n“…”\n“You prefer a woman who is the exact opposite of me. A woman with red hair…a woman with a completely different feel than me.”\nI gave up on giving any excuses. Instead, I decided to express my love for Shael. “I like light blue hair.”\nA clear sky blue.\nActually, I didn’t know that I preferred that hair color before… but now I was sure that light blue hair was my unwavering preference. The reason was simple. Because Shael’s hair was light blue.\n“…”\nShael’s face blushed red, but that didn’t mean that I had earned her forgiveness. She was still pouting with her head turned aside.\nWhile giving me an annoyed look, Shael said, “Then, let’s go to Azbel mansion and make me some dessert.”\nAll I could do was nod my head.\nShael smiled the moment I agreed, then she started walking while holding my hand.\n“..?”\n“Let’s go see another painting.” She suggested.\nIt was a completely different voice from before that sounded angry. It even sounded like she was happy.\nI also seemed to hear a low-pitched hum!\nAnyways…the situation was obvious.\n‘I was fooled.’\nI was fooled by Shael, who just wanted to eat dessert. The oblivious Shael became unusually clever Shael when it came to desserts.\nAfter a happy time at the art museum, Shael and I headed to the Azbel family’s mansion.\n* * *\nThe Azbel family’s mansion.\nEven though it’s been a long time since I last came here, I felt welcome at the mansion.\nDuring the time I was unconscious, I caused Duke Jespen to worry a lot.\nSo, after sending Shael to the room first, I had a long conversation with Duke Jespen.\nAfter that, I went into Shael’s room as usual.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Kikiiik!\n\"Welcome.\"\nI heard Shael's voice as soon as I entered the room.\nEven though we were only apart for a short while, that voice seemed genuinely happy to see me.\nI smiled at Shael's warm welcome as I settled into the chair.\nHowever, I didn’t know that my smile was bound to fade soon after.\nBecause…\n\"You were supposed to make desserts.\" Shael complained.\n\"Ah, I forgot.\"\nThat was the promise I had made with Shael earlier at the art museum. I had unintentionally fallen for Shael's trick—a promise that I deeply regretted, as it concerned Shael's health.\nWith an excited smile, Shael led me to the Azbel family's kitchen.\nI had no choice but to follow her there, given her earnestness in wanting to eat desserts.\nHowever, Shael's health was at stake, and indulging in sweet desserts would definitely affect her body.\nTherefore, I had to devise a plan to protect Shael's health and maintain my promise.\nBefore long, I came up with an ingenious plan.\nI would make the dessert Shael longed for utterly tasteless, to the point of being inedible. By consistently making bland desserts, I hoped to dissuade Shael from waning to eat more of them.\nIt was a natural way to make Shael refrain from eating dessert.\nYes, I had to admit that I was a bit afraid of Shael’s reaction after eating the tasteless dessert.\nBut so what!\nTo me, Shael's health came first!\nAnd so, I left out all the sweeteners and avoided ingredients that would be harmful to her body. Typically, unhealthy foods tasted great, but what I prepared were healthy yet dreadfully tasteless desserts.\nI took a moment to taste the desserts before handing it to Shael.\nAs expected, it was completely flavorless.\n\"Please hurry up!\" Shael urged.\n\"Here you go…\" I replied, imagining her reaction.\nPerhaps she'd demand that I make the desserts again, or I might end up at the receiving end of that evil glare from her once more.\nIf Shael, who adored desserts, found mine unpalatable, she might seek other options.\nShael picked up one of the cupcakes and took a bite before asking, \"Won't you eat?\"\n\"I don't really want to eat…\" I answered, though I had a question in mind.\nContrary to my expectations, Shael didn't display any displeasure after consuming the tasteless dessert.\n‘Is it an act?’\nI wondered.\nShe might be pretending to enjoy it to spare my feelings, just as I had done for her in the past.\nHowever, Shael then reached for one of the cookies, and proceeded to crunch it with a happy smile.\nWell…it was clear; Shael genuinely liked my desserts!\nIt puzzled me quite a lot, as I hadn't used any sweet ingredients at all.\n\"Do you like it?\" I couldn't help but ask, given her delighted expression.\n\"Of course, it's delicious!\"\nAgain, I was left baffled.\nShael continued to enjoy my tasteless cookies, she was even eagerly eyeing my portion of the deserts.\nI couldn't bring myself to eat them, opting instead to watch Shael savor my creations.\nBefore I knew it, the plates with desserts were nearly empty, and I could hardly believe the speed at which Shael had devoured them all.\nThen she spoke up, \"Bring more. No, bring them all.\"\nI hesitated but eventually gave in to her enthusiastic request. After all, the desserts I was making now were harmless for her health.\nAs long as Shael's well-being was ensured, I could continue making them forever.\nI worked quickly to prepare more desserts.\nEven though they still remained unappetizing to me, Shael eagerly indulged in my desserts, wearing a genuinely happy smile.\nIt was a sight that brought me comfort just by observing it, and a sudden realization dawned on me.\n‘Ah!’\nI thought,\n‘Shael didn't really love desserts for their sweet taste and flavor, she only loved them because they were made by me, even the tasteless ones!’\nIt was only now that I, a fool, understood that obvious fact, that—Shael's love for sugary treats was an extension of the love she felt towards me.\n\"Take your time eating. If it's not enough, I'll make more.\"\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can. You can also support me and sponsor chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "Shael kept on eating the desserts I made.\nI became intoxicated by the spectacle, and it wasn't long before the dessert plates were empty.\nShael glanced at me, the message in her eyes was clear—she wanted more dessert.\n‘Well, it's not bad for her health anyway, so she could have as much as she liked…’\nI assured myself.\nBut this time, I wanted to try something new.\nA particular dish had popped into my mind—the mint chocolate-flavored cupcakes.\nIt wasn’t that hard to make, and soon, it was ready.\nAnticipating Shael's reaction, I handed her the plate.\nWould she spit it out before I could even swallow a bite? Or would she glare at me again?\nPerhaps she would playfully feed me the cupcakes in return.\nRegardless, I was sure Shael's reaction would be adorable and entertaining.\n\"How is it?\" I asked her, expecting her response.\nShael took a bite of the cupcake, and took her time to carefully savor it, so her mouth too busy to give an answer. After that, she just kept eating that cupcakes, and she seemed to be more interested in the cupcakes than in the conversation.\nThe cupcakes disappeared in no time, and she asked again, “More please.\"\nI couldn't help but wonder if she found them delicious. I knew Shael liked my desserts, but the current situation was quite puzzling. So I decided to ask, \"Is it delicious?\"\n“…?”\nShael nodded her head, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.\nIt left me somewhat perplexed. No amount of love could achieve such a feat.\nEven the most skilled chefs in the Azbel family struggled to satisfy Shael's taste buds.\n‘Maybe Shael has a unique palate.’\nI spent some time on making more of the mint chocolate cupcakes while ignoring Shael's request\n***\nLater, in Shael's room.\nWe found ourselves sitting across from each other just like we used to.\nThe atmosphere was somewhat awkward, as it was the first time we had sat down in Shael's room after we confirmed our feelings.\nShael finally broke the silence, her expression somewhat unnatural, and she couldn't even make eye contact with me as she remarked, \"The weather is nice…\"\n‘Had Shael ever discussed the weather with me before?’\nI couldn't recall any such conversation.\nWell, it wouldn’t have seemed that strange of a conversation if it wasn’t for the fact that the weather wasn’t nice at all. It had been raining all day, and we even had to use an umbrella. The view outside the window still displayed a sky filled with dark clouds.\n\"Did you say the weather was nice?\" I inquired.\n\"What kind of food do you like?\" Shael asked, quickly shifting the topic.\n‘Now that was fast…’\nI thought, as I answered, \"I like cheesecake.\"\nBut Shael followed up with, \"What is your favorite hobby?\"\n\"I enjoy fishing.\" I replied again, feeling quite strange.\nShael stared at me as if she were trying to discern something from my responses. It was evident that there was more to her gaze than met the eye.\nSo, I decided to add, \"Come to think of it, it seems that Duke Jespen wanted to meet you.\"\nActually, he didn’t.\nI didn’t want to lie like this, but…Duke Jespen would like it for sure, considering that his unfilial daughter didn’t even properly communicate with him after she returned from the Baslett family.\nDuke Jespen would certainly understand my intentions if I sent his daughter to suddenly meet with him.\nShael tilted her head with a puzzled expression. Then she suddenly got up from her chair, glanced at something, and turned back to look at me, her face quite tense as she finally sat back down.\nIt was clear that there was something she didn't want me to discover, and I needed to investigate it in further detail.\n\"Aren't you going?\" I prodded.\n\"Come with me.\" she replied.\nI contemplated on how to send Shael alone, \"I'm tired, so I'll get some sleep. I think Duke Jespen said he wanted to discuss something about our engagement…\"\nI figured that mentioning our engagement would pique Shael's curiosity and she wouldn't be able to resist.\nAnd it worked as I had expected, since Shael quickly got up, opened the door and left the room\nAs soon as she left, I moved to where Shael had been gazing. There, I found a piece of paper with Shael's small, neat handwriting.\n– What kind of food do you like?\n– What is your favorite hobby?\nThose were the questions Shael had asked me just before.\nIt was unusual for her to inquire about such personal matters. The Shael I knew had never shown an interest in knowing about our personal preferences.\nSo now, as she was trying to open up to me, I understood it must have been quite difficult for her to express herself.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "The paper was like a script.\nIt was Shael's script for asking me everyday questions.\nReading what was written helped to ease my nerves. So I continued to read the questions Shael hadn't asked yet.\nHow much do you exercise? What is your favorite thing? Those were very common questions, and I hadn't given them much thought until now.\n‘That's right! These were the kind of questions ordinary people would exchange.’\nBut the next question was quite different.\nWhat was your relationship with the commoner named Clie?\" Is there anything you want from me? I tried to imagine Shael’s face when she was writing such a thing.\nThe handwriting, which had started neatly, had become irregularly jagged before I knew it. It was clear that Shael was feeling uneasy when she wrote these questions.\nWhat do you like about me? There were even questions that made her question her own attractiveness.\nShael was anxious!\nHave I been with another woman in the past and whether I wanted something from her were the subjects of those questions. If you looked at those questions, it was clear that Shael was experiencing from a serious lack of self confidence.\nShael had seemed composed and happy with me just a moment ago…so it was my mistake to not notice her anxiety.\nPerhaps it was only natural.\nShael was not good at handling human relationships. No matter how happy she was with me, she couldn't avoid the constant anxiety that engulfed her, due to our past.\nShael knew that I had been in contact with Clie.\nEven before I confessed to Shael, she suspected that I was in love with another woman.\nMy absence for 15 days must have hurt Shael's emotions as well.\nEverything was my fault, even if it wasn't intentional.\n‘So, I have to make it right!’\nI thought while grabbed a pen from Shael's room.\n\"I'm not good at using cheesy words, but…\"\nIf Shael's happiness was at stake, the situation was different.\nFor Shael's sake, I could become a bit more sentimental.\nSlowly answers to Shael's numerous questions began to take shape.\nAfter filling out the paper, I put it back to its original place.\nAfter a while, Shael finally returned after talking with Duke Jespen.\nNow it was time to enjoy Shael's blushing face.\n***\n[Shael’s POV]\nShael looked at Eran.\nNow that she had finished her conversation with Duke Jespen, she was ready to continue her barrage of questions she had for her lover.\nShe turned her gaze towards the script and asked, \"How much do you exercise?\"\nHowever, Shael suddenly closed her mouth. It was because she discovered something extremely embarrassing written below the question.\nThe handwriting didn’t belong to her.\nI spend most of my day exercising, to gain the power to protect the woman I love. Shael lowered her gaze, and found that other questions also had answers written below them.\nWhat was your relationship with a commoner named Clie? We are enemies, so you don't have to worry. And, it didn't end there.\nIs there anything you want from me? It would be nice if we could spend even a little bit of time together without any distractions. Shael sighed.\nWhat do you like about me? Everything about you is cute. Leaving one question unread, Shael turned her head away.\nIt seemed like her face would burst in shame if she read the script any further.\n\"…\"\nShael had written the script because she was having difficulty in articulating the questions to Eran. It was also because she didn't want to feel ashamed in the slightest.\nHer plan was simple—\n‘If I can just read the script without thinking too much, I wouldn't feel embarrassed.’\nHowever, in the end, it wasn't that simple.\nInstead, when Shael saw what she had written, it only made her face turn redder with shame.\nNo, perhaps Shael felt even more ashamed than ever.\n\"Your face is all red. Are you okay?\" Eran asked with a teasing smile.\nShael replied with a grunt, \"No it’s not!\"\nShe wouldn’t admit defeat!\nEven if she felt embarrassed…she wouldn't blush just from thinking about Eran.\nShael, still chewing on her past thoughts, managed to turn her head back to see the answers she hadn't seen yet.\nBeneath the messy handwriting due to her flustered mood, Eran’s handwriting was clear to see, as if it indicated his firm will.\nWhat is your favorite thing? Shael Azbel. This time, too, it was Shael’s complete defeat.\nShael’s flushed face conveyed the news of his victory to Eran.\nGoblin:\nThis month is proving to be a really difficult one.

      "content": "I made some desserts for Shael, who was cooling off her blushing face.\nNo matter how healthy a dessert may be, I didn't really want her to eat any more today…but seeing Shael's red face made me change my mind again.\nI wanted to experience it a little bit more.\nAs Shael reached out for the desserts, but I didn't just place the cookie in her hand like I usually did\n\"…?\"\n\"I will feed you. Come closer.\"\nShael shook her head in fright.\nIt was natural. She must have been feeling a lot of shame over what happened just now.\nDespite Shael's refusal, I still held the cookie in my hand and waited for her to take a bite, like a fisherman casting bait.\n\"…\"\nShael slowly approached the bait, her eyes fixed on the cookie, and it was close enough to touch her lips.\nHowever, the cookie didn't go into Shael's mouth.\nI removed my hand before she could take a bite.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Let's try again.\"\nAfter hearing what I said, Shael refocused her attention on the cookie (bait).\nIt was a childish prank, and Shael would have reacted… if not for the cookie right in front of her eyes.\nTherefore, I managed to save my skin without any incident.\nFinally, Shael placed her cookie in her mouth.\nShe took the bait!\nI smiled broadly and embraced Shael, who had come closer.\nIt was perfect— such a big catch wouldn't have been possible without a show of patience.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"What's the problem?\"\nAfter speaking proudly to Shael, I held her even closer.\nShael, who had initially rejected me out of shyness, was now just frozen in silence.\nOnce again, it must have been due to the shame.\nOr, maybe Shael wanted to savor the moment as well.\nEither way, it was a win for me, as I could hold Shael a little longer.\nI cleared my thoughts and focused on Shael.\nIt seemed my empty heart had been filled.\nI could feel the warmth, enough to make me feel cozy.\nPerhaps Shael's shyness had transformed into warmth. Otherwise, there was no way I could feel this comfortable.\nNext, I began to explore Shael's slender body. It was surprising how slender she was despite consuming so much desserts.\nHer body seemed too fragile for someone who had been called a wicked villainess.\nShael's initially nervous and trembling body gradually relaxed.\nMy own heart was still pounding.\nWe enjoyed a long hug without speaking, and it was clear we were both content in each other's arms.\nIndeed, it was quite fortunate.\nWhen our eyes met for a moment, I noticed Shael’s blushing face.\n\"Your face is very red.\"\n\"You too!\"\nI wondered if my face was as red as Shael's.\nIt probably was…just like Shael.\nAnyways, hugging her made me happy.\n\"Ah…\"\nThe hug, whether it was short or long, eventually ended.\nShael seemed to regret it as she let out a sigh, but then she cleared her throat and returned to her seat as if she came to her senses.\nWhen I took a deep breath and looked at Shael, I couldn't help but show a foolish laugh.\nHowever, Shael grabbed one of the cookies, and reached out with a sheepish smile, just as I had done before.\n\"Eat.\"\nShael was also casting her bait.\nWith determination, I approached Shael with the intention to get even closer.\nI bit the cookie in her hand and ate it.\nYet, despite eating the cookie, she couldn't bring herself to hug me. Her fidgeting fingers expressed her inner turmoil.\nShael's hesitance frustrated me. So once again, I was the one to embrace her.\n\"Ah!\"\nI had to flip the script—and get caught on my own.\nShael was feeling shy, but still, she couldn't refuse me.\nHer already red face became even redder.\nThen I kept holding onto Shael, ready to have a conversation.\n\"Eat.\"\nShael wanted me to eat more cookies.\nThe situation mirrored the one before, and it was easy to guess what it meant.\nAnyways, I welcomed Shael's bait.\nWe spent our time doing silly things like that and time seemed to fly by.\n\"It's getting dark…” I said to Shael, and she just grumbled a little.\n“Thanks to someone hugging me until I could barely breathe.”\nDespite my teasing, Shael responded with a smirk, as if she had won some kind of unspoken battle.\nThen, after gathering her thoughts, she spoke up, \"Isn’t it getting dark?\"\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "“What do you want to say?”\n“It’s time for you to go to home.”\nCertainly, it was. Originally, I would have returned to the Baslett Estate around this time.\nBut not anymore.\n“I won’t leave even if I die.”\n“…”\nI would never leave her. Until I find more information about Clie, I had no intention of parting with Shael.\nPersonally, I wanted to spend the whole day with Shael.\nI smiled proudly at Shael and sat down on her bed.\n“No…”\n“What is the problem?”\nWe had already slept together on the same bed many times before. The places where we slept together were various– from the Mage Tower to the Baslett family’s mansion.\nWe even confirmed each other’s feelings. So there was nothing strange about my behavior.\n“You have to go…”\n“I’ll leave tomorrow morning. I’ll make you dessert as soon as I wake up.”\nShael’s face, which had been making an expression of rejection as usual, loosens up.\nShael nodded her head and opened her mouth, “Then…it’s alright.”\nApparently, you can sleep with someone with desserts.\nTo be honest, it was quite funny.\nPerhaps the shy Shael needed an excuse—a reason for her to agree with me.\n“I’ll talk to the Duke for a while and then come back.”\n“Yes.”\nI then talked to the Duke Jespen and went through a brief preparation.\nAs usual, I walked towards Shael’s room where she was waiting for me.\nKikiiik…\nEntering the room I found Shael lying on the bed. I naturally walked toward Shael’s bed.\n“Sleep in another roo…”\n‘Sleep in another room.’\nShael was probably about to say that, but I stopped her from speaking more.\nShe already knew that I wouldn’t do anything wrong.\nAnd, she must be thinking that she should at least show some signs of refusal.\nYou could tell just by looking at the place on the bed she had prepared for me to sleep.\nI lay down next to Shael.\nShael was lying with her back turned to me.\nNevertheless, I was sure…that Shael’s face must be blushing red.\nI could see the parts of a teddy bear in Shael’s embrace. It was the teddy bear I gave her in the past.\n“Are you hugging a doll?”\n“Why, what’s wrong?”\nIt was quite funny when I thought about it. From the time I first gave her the doll, she continued to sleep while hugging it like that.\nEven while she insulted me and said that she hated me, she still slept while hugging the doll I gave her.\nA smile naturally formed on my mouth while thinking about Shael’s insignificant yet cute behavior.\nAs I thought about my memories, Shael’s body, which was stiff due to her being nervous, finally relaxed.\n“Are you asleep?”\n‘Is she sleeping already?’\nWhat an incredible speed!\nIt was hard to accept, since I was finding it quite hard to sleep due to my pounding heart.\nAnd, Shael, who was so shy, had already fallen asleep.\nShe must have been very tired. She must have suffered a lot because of me during those 15 days.\nIt was hard to believe that so many things happened in such a small time.\nAnyways, I closed my eyes, and tried to sleep. All the while thinking about what I would do tomorrow with Shael.\nBut suddenly there was a sound of tossing and turning beside me.\nShael, who had been sleeping, had turned her body around!\nNow she was facing me.\nHer arms, which had let go of the doll, embraced me instead, and before I knew it, I had become a substitute for a doll.\n‘Is this her sleeping habit?’\nAnyways, it was a good thing for me, as I would be able to feel the happiness I had felt before.\nI tried to close my eyes again while being surrounded by that pleasant feeling.\nHowever, I suddenly noticed that Shael’s breathing seemed quite irregular.\n‘Is she really sleeping?’\nNo matter how you look at it, she wasn’t.\nI could also tell by the way her arms twitched as she held me.\nAs I continued to observe Shael, her eyes slowly open. She was looking at me by opening her eyes ever so slightly.\nAs soon as our eyes met, Shael hurriedly closed her eyes and exhaled softly, pretending to be asleep.\nI looked at Shael with a smile.\nShael’s body began to flinch. Maybe she was becoming nervous about being caught.\n‘What will she do now?’\nIt was simple. She would cheat.\nShael, who had been frowning as if she was looking for a way out, gently opened her mouth.\n“…zzzzzz.”\nShael made an unnaturally cute sound.\nDid you think I would be tricked if you made a cute sound?\nWell, it was correct to say that the onomatopoeia associated with sleep was usually the sound ‘zzzzz’.\nBut the issue here was that she was literally making that sound!\nWho would be fooled by that?\nShael couldn’t control the corners of her mouth from rising up.\nIt’s clear that she was thinking that her performance was perfect.\nI couldn’t stop laughing at her insignificant yet cute action and decided to play a prank.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

Shael, who looked disappointed, closed her eyes again.\n‘Is she disappointed because it wasn’t a kiss?’\nBut I didn’t want to waste my first kiss in such a way. I wanted to make it special.\nAnyways, finally done with my little game, I closed my eyes, I hugged her.\nI continued envisioning our future together.\nA future where Shael would express her affection without reservations…a future of happiness.\nPerhaps Shael's shyness would change over time.\nOne day, we wouldn't need to pretend anymore.\nI hoped for a future where we could express our love confidently.\nWith those thoughts in my mind, I drifted off into a peaceful sleep.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

There’s no way I could’ve gained that much weight.’\nShe thought.\nIt was clear that Eran was mistaken…\nHowever, Shael still tightened her stomach without realizing it. It was to prove that she hadn’t gained weight.\n\"Ah…now that I see it again, she does seem a bit too thin…\"\nAnd, there were immediate results!\nSoon, Shael was relieved and was able to relieve her tension.\nThen she heard words that made her face stiffen again.\n“You’re cute.”\nHearing Eran’s words, she barely held herself back from frowning.\n\"I know you're not asleep.\"\nEven after those sudden words, Shael was able to continue her act.\nBecause she was convinced that her acting skills were perfect.\nShe continued her rhythmic breathing as if she was still sleeping.\nShael performed an even more perfect performance in order to deceive Eran.\nThen Eran blew in her ear and touched her cheeks.\nShe wanted to get up right away and pull Eran’s cheek, but…she endured it with great patience.\nThe next moment, she felt something touch her lips.\nIt was something very soft, and Ahael instinctively sensed what it was.\nIt must be Eran’s lips!\nShael was taken aback, but soon she regained her composure.\nShe couldn’t do anything with her pounding heart…but she still did her best to respond\nOf course, Shael was able to grasp the situation after briefly opening her eyes, and she spit out Eran’s hand in disappointment.\nAfter that, Eran tossed and turned while looking at her and finally fell asleep.\nShael was finally able to breath a sigh of relief.\nThere was just one problem—Eran was sleeping while hugging her.\n‘I’m obviously tired, but I can’t sleep.’\nShael though to herself.\nIt was a day where a lot of things happened. So it was natural to feel tired.\nFrom the start, Shael was feeling quite sleepy… but, she could ignore Eran who was so close.\nEven though her body was comfortable, her mind wasn’t.\nShe could tell by touching her own face, where she could still feel the heat.\nSleeping so close to Eran was something she was finding hard to adapt.\nShael opened her mouth, barely holding back her trembling heart.\n“H..hey…”\n‘I have to tell him to get up and put his arms away…’\nShe wanted to do it herself, but it was difficult for her to remove Eran’s arm.\nIt was because Eran was hugging her too tightly.\nEven so, Shael couldn’t understand her current situation.\nIt was a situation where she couldn’t properly use her power and her words wouldn’t come out of her mouth.\nJust because Eran was hugging her didn’t mean those things would be impossible.\nSoon, the annoyed Shael opened her mouth again.\n“Hey, your arm…”\nBut she swallowed back her words.\nBecause when she tossed and turned, Eran hugged her even tighter.\n“…”\nShe couldn’t even speak anymore.\nIn fact, she could wake Eran up right away, but…she didn’t want to.\nThe reason for that was unknown, even to Shael herself.\nShael took a deep breath.\nEven so, she exhaled her breath quietly so as not to wake Eran.\nIt was the first time Shael stayed up all night.\n* * *\n[Duke Jespen’s POV]\nDuke Jespen stared at the letter in his hand with a worried expression.\nThen he opened his mouth, “My sister is coming.”\n“…Rayel is coming?”\nEnella asked to make sure she had heard right.\nDuke Jespen responded by nodding his head.\n“Yes. When do you suddenly leave the empire?”\nHe suddenly received a letter saying that his sister would be returning to the Azbel territory.\nThe reason for her return was the bad rumors were circulating about Shael.\nRayel had left the Empire so early that she would never have seen Shael except for when she was a baby.\n‘By the way… how did rumors about Shael circulate even outside the Empire?’\nIt was clear that something was wrong.\nEven if the rumors about Shael were bad, it wasn’t to that extent.\nNot only that.\nIt wasn’t a good time for such rumors to spread, especially considering that the Imperial Festival would be held soon.\n‘Before that, I would have to attend the Blessing Meeting of the Holy Kingdom.’\nEven if you thought about other minor events, rumors like that were rather lethal.\nDuke Jespen sighed.\nAfter that, he couldn’t help but let out an even bigger sigh.\nBecause the letter was giving him a strange feeling.\nPufffh!\nThe letter suddenly exploded, and a musty raccoon’s stench spread across the room.\nEnella frowned and said, “Jespen.”\n“Yes, Enella?”\n“Quickly throw that thing away!.”\nHe was kicked out from the room with the raccoon’s smell.\nDuke Jespen sighed again as he used magic to get rid of the stinky smell.\nHis older sister had always been playful and had a strong personality.\nAnd Shael also had a bad personality and was very stubborn.\n‘I am worried about their meeting…’\nBut he believed that Eran would do a good job.\n‘Please, he has to…’\nDuke Jespen prayed.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

It seemed that she had woken up earlier than me.\nHonestly it was quite hard to believe that she was awake, due to the fact that Shael usually slept a lot.\n“Let me go…”\nShael tried to lift my arms.\n‘Who was the one that hugged me first last night?’\nI thought.\nStill, I didn’t want to release Shael. I only hugged her even tighter.\nAfter that, I lowered my eyes to appreciate Shael’s cute face, which should be blushing red.\n“…”\nAs expected, Shael’s face was indeed red. It was quite the pleasurable experience.\nShael shyly asked, “Are you going to hug me all morning as well?”\n“What if I do?”\nShe was the one who had embraced me first, and I was confident that she knew it as well. So I had sufficient leverage to demand compensation.\nTherefore, I told Shael, “I need to get some more sleep.”\n“Get up.”\nEven when Shael said that, I still closed my eyes. It felt really cozy when I hugged her.\n“Wa…wake up!”\nI didn’t respond to Shael’s request, which was mixed with irritation, and took a deep breath as if I was sleeping.\n“I know you’re not sleeping…”\n‘Yeah… same as you.’\nI let out a small breathing sound in response.\n“Zzzzz…”\nTo be honest, I felt quite embarrassed…but still, I let out the unnatural and awkward noise so that Shael could hear it.\nEven though it was embarrassing, the results were good. Because, as soon as Shael heard the sound, I could feel her stiffen.\nShe was probably thinking about what happened last night.\nShe must be wondering if I was awake.\nShe must have realized that her acting was clumsy.\n“Ahh…umm…”\nI could tell from Shael’s trembling voice that she was flustered.\nAnd, so I spent a long time hugging Shael while pretending to be asleep.\n* * *\nAfter spending time while hugging Shael, it was time to have breakfast.\nI completed a brief preparation with Shael.\nAfter that, we left Shael’s room and walked around the Azbel family’s dining room.\nOn the way, we found Duke Jespen, who was walking across the hallway.\nHe saw us and spoke up in a happy voice.\n“Eran!”\nThen he smiled and added, “I heard that you spent the night in Shael’s room.”\n“…”\nI had no choice but to remain silent.\nAlthough nothing happened…we were not even married yet and I still spent the night with Shael.\nEven though I was her fiance, this was still considered to be improper.\nHowever, Duke Jespen was smiling happily as if he liked the situation, and his gaze fell on Shael.\nI also turned my head to look at Shael.\nShael’s face was more red than ever. She was making an expression as if something embarrassing happened last night.\n‘Yeah, it does seem quite inappropriate…’\nSpending the night together in the same room, and Shael blushing like that, would be enough to cause a misunderstanding.\nMaybe Shael was thinking about last night, when she pretended to be asleep and hugged me.\nBut, it would look different in the eyes of others.\nSo it was obvious what Duke Jespen would think.\nAnyone would be suspicious of such a situation, let alone someone like Duke Jespen, who tended to overthink.\nDuke Jespen turned his head, and looked at me.\n“…”\nHe was about to say something, but in the end, he kept his mouth shut.\nIt was obvious what he wanted to say.\nIt must’ve been about Shael and my marriage.\nAnd, it was also clear that he stopped talking so that Shael and I wouldn’t feel burdened.\nHe did mention it a few times before, but…that was probably only a half-hearted joke.\nHowever, it was different now.\nNow that Shael and I were openly expressing our passionate affection, we should seriously think about getting married.\n‘Getting married to Shael…’\nIt would make me very happy.\nMy daily life that wouldn’t be much different from now would continue.\nNo, it would be somewhat different. That much was clear after Shael and I confirmed our feelings for each other.\n“I’ll be leaving first.”\nWhile I was silently contemplating on our future, Duke Jespen went towards the Azbel Mansion’s dining room first.\nIt gave Shael and me a little time to talk.\nI immediately asked Shael,“How do you feel about marriage?”\n“Marriage…”\nOf course, it made Shael blush, so I gave her time to think about the matter.\nAfter some time, Shael opened her mouth.\n“…”\nYes, it only opened. But, perhaps because of shame, Shael was unable to say anything.\n“You’re not a carp… so stop grasping for air.”\nI threw a playful remark at Shael and headed to the Azbel family’s dining room.\nKikiiik!\nAs we entered the dining room, we found Duke Jespen in his designated seat.\nAnd next to him sat Duchess Enella.\nAs Shael and I sat across from each other, Duke Jespen said, “I’m glad that you seem to be okay.”\nIt seemed that Duke Jespen had worried for me. It was because I was unconscious for 15 days.\nWhen I nodded my head to show that I was fine, Duke Jespen said with a smile on his face.\n“Shael was so worried that she refused to even come home.”\nAt the words of Duke Jespen, I turned to look at Shael.\n‘Was she that worried?’\nEven though I woke up after 15 days, I found Shael right in front of me, so I didn’t think much of it, but…\n‘Was she worried because of that prediction?’\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "I felt sorry for Shael, but also grateful.\nMy gaze fell on Shael’s hand, which was gently placed on the table.\nUnable to hold back, I held Shael’s hand.\n“…!”\nShael responded by shaking her body.\nDuke Jespen and Duchess Enella, who were watching us, sent me a meaningful gaze.\nBecause Shael’s hand, which I was holding, was on the table, it meant that Duke Jespen and Duchess Enella could see our overlapping hands.\nOf course, it wasn’t that important to me. I proudly held Shael’s hand and grinned.\n“Hoo…!”\nWhat I heard was an exclamation from Duke Jespen. It was in response to the fact that Shael was not rejecting my touch.\nDuke Jespen, watching us enviously, also held Duchess Enella’s hand next to him.\n“…”\nDuke Jespen had a mischievous smile.\nAnd, as if feeling a sense of competition, he looked at Shael.\nThis time he placed his hand on Duchess Enella’s shoulder. The distance between them was so close that it could almost be said they were hugging each other. Then he looked at me and Shael.\nIt felt as if he was saying, ‘You guys can’t do this?', even though Duke Jespen didn’t utter those words.\nNo matter how good their relationship was, it wasn’t proper to display such a level of affection in front of their daughter and her fiance.\nTherefore, Duchess Enella sighed and spoke up.\n“Jespen.”\n“Hmm?”\nDespite Duchess Enella’s words, Duke Jespen didn’t stop. He coughed and continued looking at me and Shael.\nShael, looking like her pride was hurt by Duke Jespen’s actions, began to move. I understood Shael’s signal.\nEven though her face was red, she made a face as if asking me to do something.\nTherefore, I also hugged Shael as well.\n“…!”\nDuke Jespen was surprised. Even at that close distance, Shael didn’t reject me.\nDuke Jespen, making an expression as if he couldn’t lose, moved closer to Duchess Enella, but fortunately, Duchess Enella intervened, preventing the situation from escalating.\nDuke Jespen, showed a regretful expression, but suddenly, his expression became serious, and finally he opened his mouth.\n“I recently received a letter, saying that my sister, who had left the Empire, would be returning.”\n“…?”\nThis was the first time I had heard of it.\nEven in the novel, nothing like this ever happened.\nBut, it was understandable, since the story of the Azbel family wasn’t that detailed in the novel.\nThinking to that point, I listened to Duke Jespen’s words with attention.\n“Rayel Azbel. No, it should be Rayel Tarden now.”\n“Why do you look so upset?”\nI asked, studying Duke Jespen’s expression. After all, if it was his sister, then she should be his family.\nAnd considering his personality, the Duke should be smiling from ear to ear.\nBut to think that he was making such a troubled expression at the prospect of his sister’s visit, whom he hadn’t seen in a long time.\nI became sure.\nThat person named Rayel Tarden was obviously not a normal individual. She must have a unique personality.\nI turned my head to Shael, but Shael also seemed puzzled.\n‘Even Shael doesn’t know about her?’\nIf so, it was easy to guess how eccentric Rayel Tarden was.\nTo leave the empire for such a long period of time, rejecting her identity as a member of the duke’s household?\nShe must have had an unconventional mindset.\nAfter that, Shael and I questioned Duke Jespen further to learn more about Rayel Tarden.\n***\nDuke Jespen and Duchess Enella, who were conversing, left first.\nShael and I remained in the dining room.\nIt was time to treat Shael to a dessert.\nI took out a cookie and handed it to her.\nPerhaps thinking that this would lead to another warm embrace, Shael ate the cookie, her face blushing.\n“…?”\nHowever, I didn’t hug Shael, though I wanted to.\nIt was Shael who gathered her courage so that she could embrace me on her own. Her hand gently rested on my shoulder, inching closer to me.\nIf she moved a little closer now, it would be a perfect hug…but it wasn’t an easy thing for Shael.\n“…”\nJust a bit more, if Shael could muster her courage, she would be fine.\nI cheered for her in my heart, hoping she could confidently hug me, putting aside her embarrassment.\n“I can’t…”\nShael uttered her frustration.\nAs she pondered how to endure her shame, I sensed someone approaching.\nA woman’s voice reached my ears.\n“You must be Shael.”\nWe immediately turned our heads at the speaker.\nA woman with sky-blue hair and eyes that symbolized the Azbel bloodline appeared before us.\nRayel Tarden.\nShe perfectly matched the image of Rayel Tarden described by Duke Jespen.\nAfter a moment of thought, the woman spoke.\n“I have come to take you away.”\nWith a mischievous smile, she added, “There are rumors that the Empire is changing the law to make breaking engagements easier these days.”\nShael, on the other hand, looked at the woman with a bewildered expression.\nIt was the first meeting of two women who would be in conflict with each other.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "I was pretty sure this woman was Rayel Tarden. She was exactly as Duke Jespen had described.\nShe had a lively tone for a middle-aged woman.\nShael must have noticed that she was Rayel Tarden as well, but she still spoke with an aggressive expression on her face.\n“Who are you, why are you here?”\n“Who am I? I am your aunt, my dear cute niece.”\n“I don’t remember having an aunt.” Shael answered with a frown on her face.\nI tried to stop Shael in case a fight would break out, but I couldn’t, because Shael stopped me by shoving a cookie into my mouth.\nFortunately, Rayel Tarden didn’t lose her smile despite Shael’s aggressive behavior, and said, “You say that you never had an aunt. But as far as I remember, you used to follow me around as a baby?”\nIt was true. Duke Jespen had already told us about that.\nHe said that when Shael was young, she and Rayel used to stay together all the time.\nBut Shael said as if she wasn’t convinced. “I don’t remember.”\n“I feel sad. I also changed your diapers…”\nShael looked at me and hurriedly shook her head.\nEven if she didn’t, I knew that the statement was false.\nIt was because Shael belonged to a family mages which had developed various kinds of magic, including the cleaning magic. So there was no way the Azbel family would use diapers.\nAlso, there was no way Rayel Tarden, who wasn’t even a maid, would change diapers for her niece.\nRayel Tarden, who seemed to have finished speaking, suddenly reached out her hand, and grabbed a cupcake I made for Shael.\n“Looks delicious.”\n“That!”\nOf course, Shael would react aggressively. Because she was someone who loved my dessert to death.\nIn particular, the cupcakes Rayel was holding were also the type of dessert that Shael particularly liked a lot.\nDespite Shael’s reaction, Rayel Tarden took a bite of the cupcake.\n“Ugh!”\nThen she looked at the cupcakes disapprovingly.\nThe reason was quite obvious.\nFor Shael’s health, I didn’t add any sweet ingredients to those are desserts at all. So even a five-year-old would know that dessert without sugar wouldn’t be delicious.\n“What kind of cupcake tastes like this? There is no sugar at all.”\n“Yes. It doesn’t taste good.”\nShael continued to eat the dessert even after saying that to Rayel Tarden.\nOf course, that was a lie.\n‘If it’s tasteless, then don’t eat it.’\nShael’s lie had such a hidden meaning.\nIt was a cute lie.\nSeeing Shael enjoying my dessert, Rayel Tarden opened her mouth.\n“Well, it suddenly looks delicious as well.”\n“…!”\nAt the same time, she picked up and ate the cookie that Shael had reached her hand to eat.\nThen she frowned at the tasteless cookie, and said, “It’s indeed delicious, so I should eat it all.”\nI had already heard from Duke Jespen that Rayel Tarden could be quite playful.\nLooking at it now, it was indeed a correct assessment.\nFacing such a situation I let out an involuntary sigh.\nShael’s body trembled and she opened her mouth to say, “They’re mine!”\nAfter that, she did something that made me sigh even more.\n“Hummp!”\nShael put all the cookies into her mouth with an amazing speed.\nI wonder just how she managed to do such a thing!\n“…”\n“…”\nRayel made an absurd expression as she looked at Shael, who was absorbed in eating all the dessert.\n“No, how could you eat those tasteless things…”\n“Nomn, day armn thasti.” [Translation: No, they are tasty.]\nShael, who had a whole cookie in her mouth, spoke with a strange pronunciation.\nIt must have been quite painful to shove in that many cookies all at once, but Shael’s expression looked quite happy.\nAs Shael acted like that, Rayel Tarden asked in a cold sweat, “Did you have breakfast yet?”\n“I just finished eating.”\n“So you were not starving…”\nAfter muttering that, Rayel looked at the dessert placed in front of Shael.\nThen Rayel moved the desserts to the corner of the table using her magic.\nIt meant that the time for dessert was over. It was now time to talk.\n“For now, we’ll talk about the rumors floating around in the Empire later…”\n“…?”\n“I am very curious about your relationship. Have you two kissed yet?”\nShael frowned at the question, but stayed silent. However, her expression was enough to answer Rayel’s question. Because Shael’s face was red, signifying that—\n‘We haven’t kissed yet…’\nRayel Tarden understood Shael’s meaning right away.\n“So you haven’t tried it yet.”\n“…”\nAfter that, Rayel Tarden began a barrage of questions.\nAnd, Shael’s face stayed red the whole time.\n* * *\nWhile I was talking to Rayel Tarden, I suddenly heard a soft breathing sound from Shael.\nIt seemed that at some point, Shael had fallen asleep.\nShe did look particularly tired today, but… I didn’t know why.\nShe should have slept enough.\n‘Could it be that she secretly did something all night?’\nAnyway, it was a good opportunity.\nIt was a good chance to hear all the rumors about Shael that were circulating beyond the Empire.\nIf I had asked Duke Jespen, he would be worried about Shael and me, and he would’ve hidden the rumors and tried to solve them alone.\nWhen I asked her about the rumors, Rayel Tarden opened her mouth, “There are several bad rumors going around about Shael.”\n“I was roughly expecting that.”\n“Yeah, but the rumors aren’t the problem.”\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "“Then what’s the problem?” I looked at her with a questioning gaze.\n“The rumors about Shael weren’t good in the first place.”\n“That’s true…”\nShael was the villainess. So of course the rumors about her were bad.\nNo matter how socially awkward she was, she must have attended a tea party where numerous young ladies gathered at least once. And, considering her original personality, she couldn’t have been well liked by the young noble ladies present at those parties.\nIt was something I could understand just by thinking about what happened in the banquet hall of the Mage Tower.\nRayel Tarden remarked, “I did some research before coming to the Azbel family. The movements of various aristocratic families are suspicious.”\nClie, the heroine, had a wide network of people, so she must have something to do with that.\nRayel’s words continued, “It seems that the Mage Tower and the Imperial Family are gradually cutting off communication with the Azbel family.”\nIt was obvious what that was for.\nI frowned as I listened to her words.\n“The Azbel family’s magical power and prestige has become so great that it’s being considered a threat. If that’s the case then…”\nWe should be safe for now. But that probably wouldn’t last long.\nIf you make too many powerful enemies, things were bound to turn for the worse. It didn’t matter even if the Azbel family and the Baslett family were powerful ducal families.\nIn addition, the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince would only become stronger with time, and they were destined to hold mighty power in their hands.\nFurthermore, they were, according to Clie herself, both mentally ill.\nClie herself was the heroine of this world. She was quick-witted and made friends with many influential aristocrats.\nWhat’s more, she could’ve seduced many other men besides the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.\nBreaking the bracelet didn’t end the fight. Now, it was the time to deal with Clie’s connections.\nAfter waiting for me to finish my thoughts, Rayel suggested, “So, it would be better not to go to the scheduled Blessing Meeting and the Imperial Festival.”\n“No, I have to go.”\nIt won’t change anything if we avoid it.\nFirst, I need to meet Clie.\nIf we don’t go to the Blessing Meeting and the Imperial Festival, I might lose those cheat-like items that could change the flow of the confrontation. That’s why I shouldn’t avoid it.\nAs if my firm will was conveyed, Rayel Tarden, who had been watching me silently, opened her mouth.\n“You’re quite brave…”\nShe nodded her head in agreement, but then she suddenly shook her head and asked, “But why are you two so shy with each other even when you’ve been engaged for such a long time?”\nIt seemed that Shael and I, who had just confirmed out feelings, didn’t meet Rayel Tarden’s standards when it came to intimacy.\nI personally thought that her standards were way too high.\n“Tsk…” Rayel clicked her tongue and pulled out something from her magic pouch.\nIt was a bottle of some kind of potion.\n“Why don’t you take this and use it?”\n“What does it do?”\n“It’s no fun if I tell you that.”\n“Then I won’t accept it.”\nThe potion looked quite suspicious at first glance, so of course I refused.\nBut Rayel used her magic, and the potion appeared in my pocket before I knew it!\nAs I raised my hand to take out the potion, I heard Rayel’s voice.\n“Wait. Isn’t that the Ring of Mutual Restriction? Why do you have such a precious thing?”\nIn spite of my refusal, Rayel Tarden approached me.\nI didn’t worry that she would take it, since I can’t take off the ring without Shael’s permission anyway. If I hastily tried to remove the ring, Shael might make me unable to talk to women forever.\nIn fact, it was already like that now…\nBut sometimes Shael gave me freedom to speak. That’s why I was able to talk to Rayel Tarden just now.\n“Let me see.”\nHer eyes narrowed, as she began to check the ring I was wearing.\n‘She is indeed the blood of the Azbel family.’\nThe words of Duke Jespen come to my mind.\n[My sister has a peculiar personality and she can be quite playful.]\nAgreeing with that statement in my mind, I decided to push her away.\nHowever, I heard someone’s voice next to me.\n“What are you doing!?”\nThe voice belonged to Shael.\nAnd, I felt the atmosphere turn cold.\nWhat Shael was looking at, was Rayel Tarden holding my hand.\nShe was definitely misunderstanding something.\nIn fact, Rayel Tarden was already married, and considering her age, there was no chance that there’d be something between us, but…\nHowever, Rayel Tarden had played quite a lot of pranks since she had arrived, and Shael, who tended to be dense in such situations, would surely misunderstand.\nIn my opinion, Shael might also be feeling jealous.\nThen I heard Shael say, “…go away old woman!”\nNow, that was some inappropriate words to say to your own aunt.\nAfter that Shael hugged me.\n“Haaa…”\nI couldn’t help but sigh.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Rayel Tarden turned her head to Shael’s voice.\n“What did you call me just now?”\n“Old woma…”\nBefore Shael could finish her words, I hurriedly approached her, grabbed a cookie and shoved it in her mouth.\nAnd Shael continued to munch on the cookie as she stopped talking.\nIt was quite an embarrassing situation.\nDuke Jespen had already talked about Rayel Tarden’s eccentric personality in detail.\nAnd during this encounter, I also got a good idea about her personality. So I shouldn’t let Shael fight with her.\nAs they belonged to the Azbel bloodline, both Shael and Rayel Tarden had an excessively eccentric personality. It I let thing continue like that, Rayel may not necessarily come to hate Shael, but she may end up playing a lot of pranks on her.\nSo I wanted to prevent their conflict.\nUnaware of the seriousness of the situation, Shael spoke with a strange pronunciation while chewing on the cookie, “Hmmnn…mdelmnishious…” (Translation: Hmmm…delicious!)\n“…”\nShe seemed to have forgotten about her earlier anger thanks to the cookie.\nThen, I turned my head and talk to Rayel Tarden.\n“…”\nAnd, I couldn't speak!\nI immediately figured out the reason why.\nRing of Mutual Restriction was humming and trembling each time I attempted to speak.\nIt was Shael’s doing. She made it impossible for me to talk to another woman using the Ring of Mutual Restriction.\n“What is it?”\nIt only allowed me to speak with Shael.\nAnd, she spoke to me with a smile, “What is it? It’s a punishment.”\n“Whatever you are thinking, it’s all a misunderstanding.”\nIt was Rayel Tarden who wanted to see the Ring of Mutual Restriction.\nSo, I turned to Rayel Tarden to confirm that fact…and I sighed.\n“…”\nBecause she had already disappeared. She left me to deal with the situation alone.\nClearing my thoughts about Rayel Tarden, I spoke to Shael, “But isn’t this too much?”\nI couldn’t even have a single conversation with someone of the opposite sex. It’s not like I really wanted to, but I definitely needed to talk to the opposite sex for many other important matters.\nThe Blessing Meeting would be held soon, and Clie would be present at that place.\nShe was one of the reasons I wanted to go to the Blessing Meeting. Once there, I had to have a serious talk with Clie. If I left her as it was, I wouldn’t know how things would go.\nTherefore, this situation was very inconvenient for me. So I earnestly asked Shael, “Let’s take off the Ring of Mutual Restriction for now, please.”\n“I hate it.”\nOf course she would hate it. Because in Shael’s eyes, I now looked like a playboy.\nSo, I needed a conciliatory plan to convince Shael. I had to use the thing she loved to death!\n“I’ll get you some desserts.”\nNow, she would definitely agree to my request.\n“No.”\nMy expectations were wrong…as Shael resolutely shook her head, and glared at me.\n‘It seems that I am more important than the desserts.’\nAlthough that fact was good…but it didn’t make the situation any better.\nThe Blessing Meeting would be held soon, and I couldn’t go to the Blessing Meeting in my current state.\nSomehow, I had to take off the Ring of Mutual Restriction\nThis time, I decided to threaten Shael.\n“Then I will use the Ring of Mutual Restriction as well.”\nAnd, it would prevent Shael from talking to other men.\nHowever, it was useless.\n“Sure, go ahead.”\n“…”\nFrom the start, Shael didn’t talk to men other than her father.\nI was amazed at Shael’s limited human relationship once again.\n“Let’s go to the room for now.”\n“I understand.”\nFor now, I followed Shael.\nFor the rest of the time, I would have to somehow find a way to get the Ring of Mutual Restriction off.\n* * *\nShael’s room.\nWe sat facing each other.\nAnd, there were many desserts on the table.\nIt was just like any other day—I would talk with Shael, and she would eat the desserts I made.\nHowever, the pressure I felt from Shael was different from usual.\n“Please eat.”\nI said while handing a cookie to Shael.\nToday, I made quite a lot of desserts.\nEven Shael, who usually devoured all of my desserts, should be surprised at the amount.\nBecause today, I needed to ease her mood.\nI had to take off the Ring of Mutual Restriction in order to address the issues at the Blessing Meeting.\nWith that in mind, I said to Shael who was eating the cookie, “Do you know that the Blessing Meeting will be held soon?”\n“Yes, what about that?”\n“I remember that you were very reluctant to attend the Blessing Meeting.” I continued.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "I remember that we were supposed to attend the Blessing Meeting in the past as well. It was before I turned the table on Shael, and she still had a bad personality.\nUnsurprisingly, the Shael at that time had ignored the event. So this time, she probably wouldn’t want to go as well.\n“So, I will be attending the Blessing Meeting by myself.”\nIf I did that, then maybe I would be able to meet Clie.\nAlthough I didn’t know if I would be able to meet the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.\nAnyways, it wasn’t just them. I might even be able to meet people who were friends with Clie, whom I don’t even know. Because Clie, who was a conniving little bit*h, would’ve made friends with many people.\nMoreover, it was an event that Shael hated quite openly. So the members of the Blessing Society must be quite dissatisfied with her as well, and they might join hands with Cile to conspire against us.\nThey would do it knowing full well that we were the descendants the two dukes.\nIt was because they were a group mentally abnormal people. It would be more appropriate to call them fanatics rather than believers. In addition, Clie herself had an insane amount of holy power due to the bracelet of holy power. So she must have made friends with many of their believers.\nI didn’t know what those believers could do. Even if they didn’t have much power, I needed to be careful.\nThey might be able to harm us from a blindspot.\nTherefore, I had to prepare.\nFirst of all, I had to meet Clie before the situation escalated even further.\nIf, by any chance, a battle breaks out, I’d be able to protect myself at the very least.\nHowever, it would be another matter if Shael went with me. It was natural for Shael, who had recently learned magic, to be overconfident, and do something careless. So, I would have to be extra careful.\nI waited for Shael’s response while pondering on that fact.\nShe swallowed the cookie with an annoyed expression and opened her mouth, “It doesn’t matter.”\n“Didn’t you hate the Blessing Meeting? So you don’t have to go.”\n“Then you can’t go either.” Shael said while eating another dessert.\nAnd I immediately answered, “I have something to do there, so I have to go.”\n“What is it?”\nI couldn’t give a reply. No matter how much I thought about it, there was no valid excuse I could give her.\nWhile the silence continued, Shael suddenly spoke up, “Then I will go too.”\nShe raised her eyes as if expressing her firm intention. Even her mouth, which was busy eating dessert, had stopped.\nI nodded my head, and reluctantly agreed, “I understand.”\nIt was because I could see her firm will to go to the Blessing Meeting, which I wouldn’t be able to change no matter what I said or did.\nAnd so, I decided to stop worrying for now, and let her comfortably eat the desserts.\nI could continue the conversation once she finished eating the desserts.\nBut then something even more ridiculous happened.\n“I ate it all.”\n“Did you say you ate everything?”\nI gave her the desserts not too long ago, but…now she’s saying that she ate it all!\n‘That’s virtually impossible!’\nI quickly looked at the table to check if that really was the case, and…\n“…?”\nDeserts were still there. She hadn’t even eaten all of the cupcakes that she loved so much.\nEven though she ate a little, it was far from being finished. Most of the desserts had remained untouched.\nAlso, Shael would never leave so much desserts for my share.\n‘Is she really full right now?’\nI didn’t think so. Rather, I bet she was still hungry.\nIn the first place, she would have eaten all of the dessert even if she was full.\nI wondered if I had heard it wrong, so I asked Shael, “There are still many desserts left.”\n“Yes, what about that?”\n“There are also desserts that you haven’t touched.”\nShael nodded her head.\nSo she intentionally didn’t eat them!\n“…”\nActually, it wasn’t a big deal for a noble lady to leave dessert. However, it would be a whole another matter if that noble lady was Shael.\nBecause Shael really liked my dessert.\n“Are you angry?”\n‘Is she protesting?’\nDid she refuse to eat the desserts because I said that I would attend the Blessing Meeting alone?\nMaybe it was because of what happened with Rayel Tarden?\n‘That’s probably not the case.’\nThere was no way Shael would refuse to eat the desserts just because of that. She even agreed to go to the Blessing Meeting with me.\nShael answered my question, “I’m not angry.”\n“…”\nI carefully looked at Shael’s face.\nShe did have an awkward expression, even so, she didn’t look angry.\nIt wasn’t that the desserts were tasteless either.\nThe person in question was none other than Shael, who was devouring the desserts until just a moment ago.\nFurthermore, it seemed like she wanted to want to eat the desserts even now.\n‘Then what is it?’\nI began to worry.\nIt’s not that she’s angry, and she’s still hungry, also she didn’t dislike the desserts as well.\nI was unable to understand Shael’s inner thoughts.\nIt was the first time I had come across such a difficult situation.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "It was a situation that couldn’t be easily figured out.\nI looked at the dessert Shael hadn’t devoured yet and asked, “By any chance, have I done something wrong?”\n“…?” Shael tilted her head.\nIn other words, I didn’t do anything wrong.\nStill, I had no choice but to ask her again. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to find out the reason why Shael wasn’t eating my dessert.\n“Is it because I asked you to remove the Ring of Mutual Restriction?”\nShael just slightly frowned upon hearing about the Ring of Mutual Restriction, but that was all she did.\nSo the matter with the Ring of Mutual Restriction wasn’t the cause either.\nHowever, Shael suddenly asked back, “Why are you asking me to remove the Ring of Mutual Restriction?”\n“Wouldn’t it be inconvenient in certain situations?”\nI couldn’t just tell her the truth, so I made an excuse. It also meat that I wanted to talk to people of the opposite gender.\nHowever, that excuse didn’t work for Shael. In my opinion, it wasn’t even a very good excuse in the first place.\n“You want to…flirt.” Shael said with a cold expression. Her face flushed red, as if she thought of me as some kind of playboy.\nI quickly spoke up before Shael’s face turned red enough to explode, “No!”\n“Don’t lie!” Shael continued to glare at me.\nIt was a cold gaze I hadn’t seen in a long time. So I needed a way to cool her anger.\nBefore Shael could interrogate me further, I picked up a cookie, which was her second favorite dessert after cupcakes. Then I reached out to Shael, intending to feed her the cookie.\n“I won’t eat it.”\n“Your dear fiance’s arm is starting to hurt.”\nShael looked at the cookie. It was the same old cookie that she didn’t eat. But that wasn’t important, the important thing was that I was the one feeding it to her.\nShael sighed as if she couldn’t help it and came closer to me. As usual, Shael bit the cookie I gave her and ate it. After she was finished, Shael calmly, paused as if she was waiting for something.\n“What are you doing?”\n“…”\nShael looked at me with an annoyed expression, then she patted her own chest with her hand.\nIt meant that she wanted me to hug her.\nI understood the meaning right away, but I pretended to be confused and asked, “I don’t know what you mean.”\n“…hug me.”\nIt was the first time I heard Shael’s straightforward remarks.\nTherefore, I gently hugged her, just as Shael asked.\nShe did something very brave, and it was my own way of complimenting her.\nShael buried her face in my arms. At the same time, I heard her faint voice, “You will always be mine.”\nIt was a sudden and earnest expression of her feelings. Her voice, was nothing like a woman who was once called a villainess.\nI think I had conveyed my won feelings several times before, but it always turned out like this.\nI couldn’t stop Shael from worrying.\nOf course, I also understood that Shael’s worry was because of her love for me.\nIf Shael was feeling insecure in her heart, then it was my responsibility to erase her anxiety. Thinking about that, I said to her, “Of course I will. Except for Shael Azbel, I have never hugged anyone.”\nAnd, I will continue to do so.\nI hugged Shael even more tightly, to express my feelings through my action.\n“Of course. It should be like that.” Shael’s grumbled with a bright red face.\nIt was something incredibly cute!\nAfter a while, Shael returned to her seat.\nI originally wanted to continue the matter about the Blessing Meeting, and wanted to convince her to remove the Ring of Mutual Restriction, but…I was sure to be scolded by Shael if I spoke about that again.\nAnyways, I would worry about that later. First of all, I wanted to find out about Shael’s condition.\nI already confirmed that Shael wasn’t fed up with my cookies.\nSo I had a question—why wasn’t she eating them?\nI was worried that Shael might be suffering from some health issues.\n“Are you sick?”\n“I don’t feel sick.”\nShael answered as if it were natural, but I didn’t believe her words. Because Shael didn’t care whether her body was sick or not.\nTherefore, I approached Shael. This time, I didn’t hug her, instead I carefully observed her body. Then I backed away and remarked, “…is it because you’ve gained weight?”\n“…!”\nGoblin:\nAs I said in the Discord chat, I was dealling with some troubles. So I am late.

      "content": "Shael’s expression hardened as if she was slightly surprised. Then she quickly shook her head.\nI was suspicious at first, but after seeing her strong reaction, I became even more convinced.\nShael opened her mouth as if to make an excuse, “I don’t have any belly fat. I’m so slim!”\n“Is that so?”\nFirst of all, it was true that Shael was slim. To the point that it made me worry.\nStill, having belly fat was another thing. No matter how skinny she was, having a bit of belly fat was normal.\nAfter all, she was not some kind of skeleton.\nHowever, I didn’t bother to tell that to Shael, and approached her. Then I reached out my hand towards Shael’s stomach, where I was able to feel a very little bit of belly fat.\nShael immediately blushed, but not me. Rather, I wanted to let out a sigh.\nNo matter how you look at it, Shael’s body was way too thin.\nI wanted to make her ear the desserts right away, but…before that, I spoke to Shael in a playful tone.\n“What is this cute belly fat?”\n“…!”\nShael face turned even more red, as she tried to make excuses by opening and closing her mouth, but she couldn’t because of the shame. Then she hurriedly rose from her chair, and said. “I…I’ll drink some water.”\nIn the end, she chose to run away.\nThat much was clear, considering that the drinking water was already on the table.\nIt was a blatant lie no one would believe. However, pretending to fall for Shael’s sloppy lie, I simply nodded my head.\nKikiiik!\nShael quickly escaped from the room.\nI couldn’t stop myself from laughing at her cute gestures. Then I turned my head towards the dessert Shael had left for me.\n“…?”\nSuddenly, something interesting caught my eye.\nIt was a piece of paper lying on the chair where Shael was sitting just before.\nIt was a familiar piece of paper. It was the paper that served as a kind of script, on which Shael wrote down the questions she wanted to ask me.\nI wanted to read the paper again, so I lifted the paper carefully so as not to tear it.\nTrrrrp!\nWhat I saw was Shael and my handwriting.\n[What is your favorite thing?]\n[Shael Azbel.]\nIt was something that made me feel ashamed no matter how many times I read it. I took a slow breath and looked at another question.\n[What kind of food do you like?]\nWhat was my answer to this question? I thought back to the memory in my head.\n‘What kind of food do you like?’\n‘I like cheesecake.’\nThat’s what I had answered. When I lowered my head again, I saw Shael’s handwriting clearly indicating that fact.\n[Cheesecake!]\nUnknowingly, a smile appeared at the corner of my mouth. It was as if Shael couldn’t contain her feelings while writing the fact, so she added an exclamation mark at the end.\n‘Was she that happy from knowing about my favorite food?’\nAs I though about it, I couldn’t lower the corner of my mouth that had previously gone up, and I had no choice but to put the paper down with a smile.\nKikiiik!\nShael came into the room again, with the same hurried, and quick steps. It was clear that she was worried that I might have seen the paper.\nMeanwhile, pretended not to know anything and kept my expression clam, turning my head towards the dessert Shael didn’t eat.\nIt was hard to understand why Shael was so keen on not eating these desserts, but…it would be a waste to just throw them away, so I decided to finish them myself.\nHowever…\n“…”\nI suddenly noticed something even more interesting.\n‘What kind of food do you like?’\n‘I like cheesecake.’\nAnd, among the desserts Shael didn’t touch…was a cheesecake.\nIt was something Shael left for me!\nIt was only then that I realized why she didn’t eat these desserts.\n‘Then, what about other things besides the cheesecake?’\nI was able to understand the reason without thinking too deeply.\nShael was ridiculously shy when it came to expressing her affection. And, if she only left the cheesecake for me on purpose, it would seem too obvious. So, she wanted to hide it.\nThat was how Shael usually did things.\nAnyways, I reached out for the fork and ate some of the cheesecake.\nThe cheesecake melted in my mouth, minus the sweetness, which I avoided for Shael’s health.\nSo of course, it was tasteless.\n“Do you like it?”\nIt was a cheesecake without any sweetness. Even so, it made me smile.\n“It’s delicious.”\nThe taste of the cheesecake was indeed very delicious.\nIt was because Shael’s affection felt sweeter than the bland cheesecake.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "The day of the Blessing Meeting.\nI was walking through the so called “Holy Land” with Shael. It was the place where the Blessing Meeting was being held.\nWhile I was in anguish about what awaited me at the Blessing Meeting, I heard Shael’s voice, “What are you walking so slow?”\n“Oh, I had something on my mind for a moment.”\n“Don’t think of anything else.”\nCome to think of it, I could feel the subtle changes in my relationship with Shael even while having a walk.\nOriginally, Shael used to just ignore me and walked ahead.\nBut not anymore. Now, Shael and I were walking together.\nIf I slowed down even by a little bit, Shael slowed down as well. If I walked fast, Shael also matched my pace.\nThat alone made me feel good and laugh out loud.\n“Why are you laughing like that? Are you stupid?”\n“We should look around the souvenir shop of the Holy Land.” I diverted her attention to another thing before her word got more rude.\nMy diversion was successful, as Shael really moved towards the souvenir shop.\nI also followed her into the souvenir shop.\nInside, various kinds of items were on display.\nAfter looking at the items for a while, Shael pointed to one of the books.\n“That book looks quite interesting.”\nIt was a book with a title that made me doubt my eyes.\n‘What the…is it really okay for them to sell things like this in a place like the Holy Land?’\n“I want to buy it.”\nI couldn’t stop Shael from directly buying the book.\n“Why are you buying something like that?”\n“It’s a secret~”\nShael was clearly teasing me. And, that gave me goosebumps. Because I felt there was a high possibility that the contents of the book would be applied on me in the future.\nAfter that, Shael continued to look at other things.\n“Oh…a button equipped with magic to detect lies.”\n“It may not be that accurate.”\nThere really was a kind of magic that could detect lies. Still, like all cheat-like magic, it required a lot of mana. So, there was no way you could perfectly emulate such a powerful magic with a button.\nBut Shael didn’t listen to me and still bought the button.\n“…”\nThen she turned her head to look at more strange things.\n“Oh look! If you make a wish every night, it is said that the cross will make your wish come true.”\nI tried to recommend a normal thing to Shael.\n“Hmmm, I should buy it.” Shael smiled as if she was satisfied.\nFinally, I left the souvenir shop with Shael.\n“Come on, hurry up.”\n“Okay.”\nNow it was time to go to the cathedral where the Blessing Meeting would be held.\n***\nAfter walking for a while, we reached our destination.\nIt was a massive building with a grand atmosphere.\nIt was so huge that I couldn’t even see the entirely of it at a glance!\nIt was the cathedral where the Blessing Meeting of the Holy Land was being held.\nOverwhelmed by the atmosphere, Shael and I entered the cathedral.\n“We must stay together.” I said to Shael once again.\nThe Blessing Meeting of the Holy Land was a sacred ceremony, and the qualifications for attending it were quite peculiar.\nYou couldn’t just attend it because you were rich, powerful, or an aristocrat of the Empire.\nYou could participate only if you were invited to the event, and the standard for that invitation was young age. So that’s why only Shael and I were able to come to the Blessing Meeting.\nShael opened her mouth in reply, “Of course.”\nThen she gently grabbed my arm.\nIt was really cute and it helped me relax my tense nerves, however, someone suddenly approached us and started talking to me.\n“Are you Eran Baslett from the Baslett family?”\nThe man was a believer belonging to the Holy Land, and judging by his clothes, he had a fairly high status in the Holy Land.\nI could feel the obvious lack of respect in his tone, as well as the coldness in his gaze.\nAnyways, I nodded, and the man gestured with his chin, again without a shred of politeness.\nIt meant that he wanted me to follow him.\nIt seemed as if he didn’t care about the aristocratic status of the Empire, and he expressed his views very openly, and arrogantly.\nFor now, I decided to agree, since I didn’t want to cause a scene from the very beginning.\nAlso, Shael had ignored all the previous invitations for the Blessing Meeting in the past, so I had already expected that something like this would happen.\nHowever, Shael didn’t think the same.\n“Did all the believers in the Holy Land have lack of manners?”\n“…”\nPerhaps the man didn’t expect some to say such a thing so blatantly, the expression on his face hardened.\nAnd, it wasn’t just him.\nFrom the moment we entered the cathedral, many people’s eyes were set on us.\nAnyways, I had to quickly stop Shael.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "“Shael.” I spoke up.\n“Hnmm?”\nFortunately, Shael nodded in response and stopped talking.\nIt wasn’t perfect, but I successfully passed the first crisis of the day.\nAs I followed the man in silence, we saw a tower built with white bricks.\nThe man pointed at the tower and said, “This is the Tower of Good Deeds. It will show your faith towards the benevolent god.”\nIt was something that I hadn’t seen before at the Blessing Meeting. Well, it was probably due to the fact that I didn’t really get to come this far in the past.\nThe man gestured.\nUnderstanding the meaning, I put my hand on the tower and it began to hum and tremble. After that, there was no other change.\nThe man was surprised and remarked, “I didn’t know you had such a strong faith!”\nUnlike before, he was using a polite tone.\nAs expected of a fanatic, faith was everything to them.\nThis time, Shael stretched out her hand toward the tower.\n“…”\n“…”\nThe pure white tower was suddenly stained dark!\nWell, it was only natural, considering that Shael didn’t believe in god at all.\nAfter the color of the tower changed, I felt the attention of the other believers concentrate on us.\nAmong them, I saw a few even frowning.\nThey were openly showing their disapproval towards Shael.\nIn the Empire, a high status could be used a strong shield.\nNot in the Holy Land.\nI judged that it would be better for us to leave this place. So I grabbed Shael’s hand and prepared to leave.\nHowever, someone hurried up to the man who was guiding us.\n“Jack! A commotion is happening in front of the cathedral.”\n“What did you say?”\n“Someone is making a fuss while claiming that he is the lord of the Mage Tower of the Empire.”\nNow that was surprising news!\n‘The Mage Tower Lord. He’s at the entrance of the cathedral?’\nIf so, I couldn’t rule out the possibility that Clie and the Crown Prince were also present at the Blessing Meeting.\nI calmed my breath while closing the distance with Shael even more. I had to prepare myself for anything.\nThe man, who had been conversing for a while, turned to us and said.\n“I’m sorry. It seems that I have to take care of something urgent. I will make sure that another believer can guide you.”\n“It’s alright, we are not in a hurry, so you can just take your time to deal with the urgent matter.”\nI replied, as I also needed some time to discuss some matters with Shael.\nEver since Shael dyed the tower dark, the eyes of many believers were fixed on her.\nAnd, their eyes were filled with a look of disgust.\nAlthough Shael didn’t care that much about the opinions of others, it must be bothering her…she must be hurting.\nSo I wanted to console Shael in order to make her feel better.\nAs soon as the believers left us alone, I asked her, “Are you okay?”\n“Eh…what is it?” Shael tilted her head.\nI didn’t know what Shael was thinking, but still, one thing was certain—I felt sorrow for Shael.\nThe only thing she did was refuse to participate in the previous Blessing Meetings, but she never really caused any harm the believers. She hadn’t done anything wrong enough to deserve all the cold gazes.\nI glared at the believers so that they would no longer send hateful glances at Shael, and then I hugged her.\nThis hug served a completely different purpose than the usual, as I only wanted to protect her.\n“Wha…there are people around us!”\n“So what? We are already engaged.”\n“Hmmph…”\nShael only grumbled in response, so I asked once again, “Are you really okay?”\nJust before, when that believer was acting discourteous towards me, Shael seemed more offended than me, and she even confronted them for it. But this time she was calmly accepting all the rude behavior aimed towards herself.\nI mean, contrary to how she usually acted, Shael was quite soft-hearted, so she might be hurting inside, while hiding her pain.\nHowever…\n“I really don’t mind.”\nBefore I could say anything in response, Shael spoke up again, “Just…”\nHer face, which had turned red in shame, became even more red.\nYet her words were the exact opposite.\n“…just hug me more.”\nIt was something that was completely out of my expectations.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Inside the huge cathedral.\nThousands of believers could be seen worshiping with their hands clasped together.\nOf course, not everyone was the same. There were also others who were not believers—like me and Shael.\nThanks to what happened just before, I was currently enjoying the feeling of my cute fiance in my embrace.\n“I’m bored.” Shael muttered.\nIt was only natural for her to feel that way considering that we have been praying for over half an hour already. And, from my experience with the previous Blessing Meetings, we would probably have to spend a much longer time here.\nStill, we had to persevere.\nCountless believers had gathered in this place and they were engrossed in prayer, so we wouldn’t be able to leave our seats even if we wanted to.\nTherefore, I whispered in Shael’s ear, “For now, focus on the prayer.”\n“…”\nThen I closed my eyes and engrossed myself into the prayer. That way, Shael would have no one to talk to, and she would have no choice but to do the same.\nAfter some time passed, I checked on Shael by slightly opening my eyes.\n“…”\nI found Shael staring at me from a very close distance. She wasn’t praying herself, and she was observing the way I was praying.\nI was almost startled, but I managed to hold it in.\nIt wasn’t long before Shael also put her hands together.\nFinally, Shael had made up her mind to join the prayer.\nI couldn’t help but laugh at the cute gesture.\nHowever, less than a minute later, Shael’s eyebrows started to quiver.\nIt was a signal that Shael had reached her limit.\nI guess it couldn’t be helped.\nAnd so, in the cathedral where everyone else was praying, I continued to hug Shael.\n* * *\nOur accommodation provided by the Holy Land.\nThey called it accommodation, but they were nothing but several high class inn that the organizers had prepared for the occasion.\nThe two of us were spending time at one such inn.\nI did a thorough investigation, and it turned out to be a very secure accommodation.\nI wanted to keep Shael safe during the event, so I brought a lot of protective magic tools from the Azbel family.\nOnce I was done setting them up, I judged that I could now leave Shael alone. It would be best for us stay together, but…the person I wanted to meet was the Mage Tower Lord. So, it would be better for me to do it alone.\n“Shael, I’m going to buy some ingredients for preparing desserts.”\n“I want to go too…”\n“I will be back as quickly as possible. Aren’t you hungry? It will be quicker if I go alone.”\nStill, Shael frowned and looked at me with suspicion.\nFortunately, I had one more excuse to convince Shael.\n“The Ring of Mutual Restriction is also active. So the things you are worried about won’t happen.”\n“Ah, I see.” Shael nodded her head.\nThe Ring of Mutual Restriction, which I thought would only be a disadvantage, was now useful to reassure Shael.\nI let out a sigh of relief and left the room. Then, I started running as far as I could.\nSoon, I reached the huge cathedral. It was the place where the Blessing Meeting was being held. The place was quite enormous, and it won’t be easy to find the Mage Tower Lord. So, I approached one of the believers and started talking to them.\nI began the conversation with simple religious chatter, but soon I was able to lead the conversation towards the whereabouts of the Mage Tower Lord.\n“Is the Mage Tower Lord here by any chance?”\n“Hmm…the Mage Tower Lord? Perhaps he is in the reception room. It’s that big door over there.”\nFortunately, I was able to find out the whereabouts of the Mage Tower Lord without much suspicion.\n‘Is this here?’\nI approached the door the believer pointed to with utmost caution.\nThump!\nHowever, someone suddenly opened the door and came out with an angry expression.\nIt was none other than the Mage Tower Lord!\nAt the moment, he looked quite angry and the only thing that could make the Mage Tower Lord so angry would have to be something related to Clie.\nThe Mage Tower Lord stopped to look around and spotted me. Then before I knew it, he rushed straight over to me.\n“Eran Baslett.”\n“Nice to meet you. Aren Jaygers.”\nThe Mage Tower Lord was speaking impolitely to the son of a duke, and the son of a duke was speaking politely to the Mage Tower Lord.\nIt was a funny situation, but at the moment, I didn’t want to aggravate the Mage Tower Lord. So, I didn’t show any discomfort towards his rude behavior.\nI thought that the guy would continue to act rude towards me, but the Mage Tower Lord spoke to me in a surprisingly modest manner.\n“The Baslett family is a family of famous swordsmen. So, it should be normal for you to have a panacea as an heirloom, right?”\n‘A panacea?’\nThere was nothing of the sort back at the Baslett Estate. In the first place, the Baslett family was quite poor compared to other ducal house.\n“We have none. Can you tell me what you’re aiming for?”\nFar from getting angry at my question, the Mage Tower Lord made a sad face. So, I felt a little more confident to say, “It must have something to do with that woman I saw you with in the past, right?”\n“You…” The Mage Tower Lord frowned in irritation.\n“Maybe I can provide some help.” I pushed the conversation forward.\n“…”\nThe guy still refused to speak, so I continued, “I don’t have any ulterior motives. I just want to become acquainted with the Lord of the Mage Tower, it will benefit me as a noble in the future.”\nI had to show that I was interested in him rather than Clie.\nThe Mage Tower Lord could do anything when it came to Clie. And, he was in a situation where he is asking for help. So at the moment, I had the initiative.\nThe Mage Tower Lord frowned, and finally, after a moment of thought, he opened his mouth,\n“There is a disease that Clie is suffering from. It is a disease that I can’t cure no matter how hard I try.”\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "The Mage Tower Lord seemed devastated, as if he was the one suffering from the illness, and continued,\n“She was taking medicine and increasing the amount bit by bit. But…”\n“…”\n“Recently, she seems to have been neglecting her medications.”\nAs expected, after obtaining the Bracelet of Holy Power, Clie was slowly decreasing the amount of medicine she was taking. What’s more, she was also getting the medicine through me as well.\n“In addition, recently she was bitten and injured by a vile beast. So the symptoms of the disease got worse and worse.”\nNow, that was unexpected…Clie’s illness seems to have gotten worse than I had expected.\nAnyways, for now, I shook off my thoughts and focused on the Mage Tower Lord.\n“If I let it continue like that, she will suffer from a high fever sooner or later.” The Mage Tower Lord was just absentmindedly muttered to himself.\nHigh fever, the last symptom of blood clotting disease. In that case, even after the upcoming Imperial Festival was over, Clie should be able to hold on for a few more days.\nIt meant that I couldn’t relax just yet.\nSuch was the nature of a dramatic romance fantasy novel.\nIt wouldn’t be strange at all if another cure suddenly appeared other than the earrings. And of course, Clie would know the information about it one way or another\nAnyway, I was able to get a lot of information.\n“Clie suffers from a blood clotting disease. By any chance, if the Barslett family have any information about the disease, pass it on.”\n“Okay. If I find anything that can help, I will send someone to inform you.”\nI nodded and replied to the Mage Tower Lord, whose words seemed more like an order than a request.\nNow then, it was about time I went back to Shael.\n* * *\n[Shael’s POV]\nAs Shael entered their accommodation with Eran, she was still unable to shake off her thoughts from a while ago.\nAfter some time, Eran suddenly said, “Shael, I’m going to buy some ingredients for preparing desserts.”\nOf course, Shael suggested that they should go out together.\nHowever, Eran made all kinds of excuses and left the room by himself.\n‘It looks suspicious.’\nShael thought in her head.\nEran was wearing the Ring of Mutual Restriction, so he wouldn’t be able to talk to someone from the opposite gender.\nEven so, Shael couldn’t erase her anxiety.\nEran’s actions seemed quite hurried. So it was obvious that Shael would choose to follow him.\nShael kept her eyes on Eran, who suddenly started to run. His speed was too fast for someone who just wanted to go buy some ingredients for dessert.\n‘I was right to follow him…’\nShael was became sure of her choice.\nHowever, Eran sped up to the point where Shael couldn’t even keep up, and eventually, she lost him.\n‘Wait, don’t I have that tracking magic?’\nIn the past, in the Pleorin Territory’s fireworks festival, she had enchanted Eran’s necklace with a tracking spell.\nThanks to that, she was able to keep following Eran.\nAnd, once she found him, Eran was having a conversation with Aren Jaygers, the Mage Tower Lord.\nSomehow raising her senses using magic, Shael began to eavesdrop on their conversation.\nFirst, she heard Eran’s words, “It must have something to do with that woman I saw you with in the past, right?”\n‘A woman? If it’s a woman who stays with the Mage Tower Lord, then…’\nSheal knew her as well. It could only be that woman named Clie.\nNext, Shael focused on the words of the Mage Tower Lord.\n“There is a disease that Clie is suffering from. It is a disease that I can’t cure no matter how hard I try.”\nAt the same time, Eran’s serious face caught Shael’s eyes. At the words of the Mage Tower Lord, Eran frowned even more. It looked as if he was in deep worry. It seemed that he cared about the well-being of that woman named Clie.\n“…”\n‘Come to think of it, before Eran came to the Blessing Meeting, he tried his best to remove the Ring of Mutual Restriction, something that would prevent him from conversing with the opposite gender…’\nA feeling of uneasiness surrounded Shael’s heart.\nBut recently, Eran and Shael’s relationship had gotten a fresh start. They were living a happy life each and every day.\nEven so…Eran had kept a strange distance from Shael. He had been like that ever since he woke up from the coma.\nEven when Shael gave him a huge chance, Eran refused to kiss her.\nIn fact, Eran just wanted to cherish his relationship with Shael, but there was no way that Shael, who was ignorant of such matters, would understand that.\nAbove all, Eran has always had many secrets.\nFrom being secretly in contact with that woman, to the time that woman was following them…Eran never gave Shael an accurate explanation.\nYes, Eran did draw his sword against the woman.\nBut Shael knew it well, that it was probably something he did to fool her.\n“No, probably not.”\nUnbeknownst to Shael herself, she was talking to herself like an idiot.\nThen she bit her lips and listened closely to the conversation so as not to miss anything.\n“Clie suffers from a blood clotting disease.”\nTing!\nIt was the sound of the cross Shael had bought at the souvenir shop in the Holy Land falling out of her pocket.\nIt was something that was supposed to make a wish come true, and Shael had made a wish to spend her time with Eran forever.\nHowever, when the clear sound of the cross resounded, a certain memory popped into Shael’s mind.\nIt was a memory about a medicine Eran had kept in his magic pouch.\nBecause of that, she even misunderstood that Eran was terminally ill. Fortunately, Eran didn’t contract that disease.\n“…”\nAt the time, Shael was overjoyed at the fact that Eran would continue to live and didn’t ask why he had been carrying that medicine.\nNow that she thought about it again, it was indeed quite suspicious…considering that it was the medicine for the same blood clotting disease!\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "After talking with the Mage Tower Lord, I quickly went back to Shael.\nOn the way, I also bought the ingredients for the desserts in order to avoid any suspicions.\nAs soon as I entered the room, I was greeted by Shael’s voice.\n“You’re late. Did you really go out to buy ingredients?”\nIt seemed like she had been waiting for me for a long time, as she gave me a sharp stare, with eyes full of suspicion.\nI didn’t know why, but her words gave me goosebumps!\n“I stopped to have some talk with the Mage Tower Lord.”\nThat’s why, I told the truth. Even though I couldn’t tell her the contents of my conversation with the Mage Tower Lord, I didn’t really want to lie to her about anything.\n“…is that so.” Shael nodded her head in response.\n‘She’s not asking what happened?’\nIt was quite unexpected. If it was the usual Shael, it wouldn’t have been strange for her to ask questions about what happened with the Mage Tower Lord.\nAnyways, I halted my thoughts for now. Because Shael had suddenly held out her hand.\n“Please come here.”\nMore accurately, her hand was reaching out for the bag full of ingredients for the desserts.\nI handed the bag to Shael, thinking that she just wanted to see what I had bought, but she didn’t even look at what was inside.\n“…what is it?”\n“Follow me.”\nUnexpectedly, Shael headed to the kitchen attached to the room. As a duke’s daughter, she must have never had to put on an apron, but she put on the apron with the air of an expert.\nHowever, contrary to her skillful actions, the apron was turned inside out. She even adjusted her hair, which was tied in two pigtails, to one ponytail.\nThen she spoke to me with a serious expression, “Cut the vegetables.”\n“Are we not making the desserts?”\nShael nodded her head.\nAn unexpected answer, but I also felt the firmness in Shael’s expression. So I took grabbed some vegetables, and began to cut them without any further questions.\nNow that I think about it…aren’t the roles reversed?\nOriginally, I should’ve been the one to cook, and Shael would have just “helped”. It was the norm, because Shael was not good at cooking at all.\nOf course, this “attempt” from Shael was quite admirable, so I didn’t bother pointing that out.\nTrying to cook would be a good experience for Shael as well.\nI swiftly pealed and diced the vegetables and handed them over to Shael, who then plopped them all into the stew she was apparently “cooking”.\nSoon, I was able to feel the spicy scent wafting over from the stew.\nThey were all from the various spices that were placed all around Shael.\n‘I don’t think she put the spices in proper amount.’\nAs I was thinking about it, Shael, who had been glancing at me from time to time, handed me a bowl of “stew” she had “cooked” along with a spoon.\n“Try it.”\nUsually, Shael would’ve felt embarrassed to do such a thing.\nAnd currently, she was blushing as well. Nevertheless, it was quite unexpected that she was offering me to have a tasting without feeling embarrassed.\n“Aaahn…”\nShael made a cute sound as if she was telling me to open my mouth.\nAnd, I unconsciously took the spoonful of “stew” in my mouth and ate it.\n“How is it”\n“I think you added a bit too much spice.”\nI thought that Shael would immediately proclaim that her cooking was the best and would ignore my opinion.\nHowever, Shael immediately added water to her stew.\nAnd, I couldn’t help but stare at Shael’s changed behavior with wide open eyes.\nAfter that, Shael asked me for my opinion a few more times.\nA few questions and a few answers later, Shael’s cooking gradually came to an end.\nIt wasn’t long before the mysterious “stew” was completed.\nTo be honest, it didn’t look that appetizing, and it was the same for the taste.\n“Try it.”\n“I understand.”\nI ate a spoonful of the spicy-looking stew. It was obvious that it would be tasteless, so I was going to swallow it as soon as I put it in my mouth.\nBut I didn’t…because the stew tasted a lot better than I thought!\nAfter taking another spoonful of the stew, I looked at Shael.\n“…”\nShael was frozen and silent.\nAt the moment, she seemed quite anxious, as if was worried about the result.\nShe wanted to ask if the food was good, but then she looked down at the stew as if she wasn’t confident. It wasn’t how Shael would usually act at all.\nIt was hard for me to watch her suffer like that, so I said, “It’s very tasty.”\n“…really?”\nI immediately nodded to assure her. It was for the sake of lifting Shael’s mood, but also because the food really was delicious.\n“To the extent that I want to eat it for the rest of my life.”\nUsually, such a compliment would’ve been enough to make Shael blush.\nBut this time, she didn’t.\nShe just looked at me as if she was lost in thought.\n‘What’s wrong?’\nI didn’t know. I even complimented her for how delicious the food was.\nI tried to think differently,\n‘Is my praise the problem?’\nThat could be true as well, because Shael had a unique way of thinking.\n“I’m speechless.”\nSo I remarked without much thought, and after that, I added in a hurry.\nGoblin:\nThis chapter was supposed to come out yesterday, but I was going through some issues at the time, and I didn't have the time to translate.

      "content": "“It was so delicious that I was speechless.”\nI had to put extra emphasis of on the word ‘delicious’, since Shael was shrinking up as if she were a cute little animal.\n“…”\n“Really delicious!” I remarked again.\nIt was only then did she stop that devastatingly cute gesture. I felt like an idiot for not noticing it earlier.\nAnd so, I continued to eat in silence.\n“…”\nSuddenly, Shael took a deep breath, it seemed as if she wanted to say something, but couldn’t. She seemed to be struggling with her emotions, her gaze fixed on me.\n\"What is it?\" I asked, encouraging her to speak.\nShael’s voice slightly trembled, and she cryptically spoke up,, \"You're eating well…\".\n“…?”\nAfter that, she nodded to herself as if she had accomplished something difficult.\n‘You’re eating well? Is that some kind of compliment?’\nI didn't quite understand what she meant, but looking at Shael’s blushing face, I became convinced.\nYou’re eating well—it was the only compliment that Shael could give me despite feeling ashamed.\nAnyways, it seemed that Shael has been acting strange since a while ago. So I looked at Shael with a questioning gaze.\nShael looked back at me as well, and the corners of her mouth raised up unnaturally.\nIt was a familiar situation—similar to the time when Shael gave me some cookies.\nAt that time, Shael had also looked at me and raised the corner of her mouth in the same way\nThe only difference was that, back then, she was glaring at me, and now she must be trying to smile.\nIndeed, things were quite different now.\nI shifted my gaze away, avoiding eye contact with Shael. The situation felt awkward, and Shael's sudden change in demeanor left me perplexed.\nAnd, I didn’t even have time to think about the reason, because Shael suddenly handed me something without any warning\n“What is it? I’m eating…”\n\"It's for you…\" Shael said, giving me a considerable sum of money, enough to cover my expenses for several months. The amount reflected the wealth of her family, the Azbels.\nI needed time to comprehend the situation, but Shael didn't give me a chance to process it.\n\"I can even provide you with pocket money…\" She said, her tone determined.\nShe’ll provide me the money. Did that mean that I should receive pocket money and use it?\n“If I practice cooking some more, I can make it even more delicious.” Shael earnestly explained as if she persuading me.\nI listened in silence, trying to grasp Shael's intentions. It was evident that something was bothering her, and we needed to have a conversation once she had calmed down.\nThe food Shael had prepared disappeared quickly.\nShe pointed at the empty bowl and asked, \"Was it enough?\"\n“It was enough…” I responded.\nSuddenly, her lack of confidence vanished, as Shael proudly stood up, her posture impeccable, and said,\n\"Then, wouldn't I make a great wife?\"\n‘Where did that come from?’\nI was taken aback by her unexpected words, chuckling in response. Then I noticed her apron, which was still inside out, and decided to tease her.\n\"Hmm, then you should start with the apron…\" I said while looking at the apron.\n“Ah!”\nShael hurriedly fixed her upside-down apron.\nWell, she was done cooking, so shouldn’t she be taking it off instead?\nAnyway, I could tell that Shael was still nervous. Even the apron she had fixed was in a state where the strings were tied in a strange way.\nI didn’t point it out. Instead, I got up from my seat to fix Shael’s apron.\n“You can’t even wear an apron properly.” I teased, trying to lighten the mood.\n“…”\nAs I fixed the laces that were not properly tied, I noticed Shael's expression change. She seemed to be struggling with her emotions, her eyes reflecting unknown feelings.\nThen, she smiled, it was the same smile she showed when she would find something to get back at me. But this time the feeling behind it was decidedly different.\n“You too.” Shael said that, and at the same time, she stretched out her hand toward my chest.\nI looked down, and noticed an improperly tied tie. It seemed that I was in so much hurry that I didn’t even notice the state of my tie.\nShael continued to fix my tie with her unskillful movements.\nDespite being a young noblewoman, she found such a simple tasks challenging. Yet, her careful gestures moved my heart.\n“This should be enough…” Then she confidently muttered, her voice laced with unspoken emotions.\n“You are a wonderful wife.”\nI didn’t know why I suddenly said that…but, I thought I was right.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "After Shael straightened my tie, I sat down.\nOnly then did Shael feel the shame and her face blushed.\n‘Why is she behaving like this so suddenly?’\nOf course, it felt good that Shael was being so considerate of me, and the food Shael made for me was very delicious. But, I still felt worried.\nIn fact, Shael started to act like this right after I met the Mage Tower Lord.\n‘Did she follow me?’\nI didn’t know, and it wasn’t like my conversation with the Mage Tower Lord was something strange in the first place.\nAlso, I had moved really fast, so there was no way Shael could’ve kept up with me.\nI tried to think more, but…I had no choice but to erase my thoughts at Shael’s next words.\n“I love you…” Shael said with a trembling voice.\nAfter saying that, she looked at me as if she was waiting for my answer.\nIt was very sudden, but I also responded, “I love you too.”\n“…”\nShael took a deep breath to calm herself down. She then fired back her words as if she wanted to compete with me, “…I love you more.”\nAfter she was done, she looked at me proudly. Then she lowered her head again, averting her gaze.\nThe atmosphere turned somewhat awkward.\nI wanted to give a reply, but before I could say anything, Shael opened her mouth first, “I love you even more!”\n“…”\nI was stunned at the outburst, not knowing what to say.\nNoticing my reaction, Shael finally realized what she had done, and lowered her head in shame.\nAnd, the awkward atmosphere continued…\nShael turned her head to look at the mountain in the distance with a blushing face, and I appreciated her cute reaction.\nIn the end, it was Shael who stood up first.\n“…let’s go for a walk.”\n“Okay.”\nWe were done with all the events of the Blessing Meeting that we were supposed to attend for the day. And I wanted to spend some time together at out accommodation, but if Shael wanted to go out, I had no intention to refuse.\nAnd so, here I was, following Shael, who was walking ahead of me. Then, she suddenly stopped, gave a cute cough, and looked at me.\n“What is it?” I asked, but received no answer.\nThen, suddenly, I felt a warmth in my hand.\nShael, who was usually quite shy, had held my hand on her won initiative.\nI also respond by doing the same.\nSoon after, Shael trembled and hurriedly walked while holding my hand so as not to show her blushing face.\nAnd, we both turned silent.\nShael, who seemed to have found a suitable conversation topic, opened her mouth to ask, “What is that tree in the middle of the cathedral?”\nAs she said, there was a huge tree inside the cathedral, its branches stretching towards the ceiling.\nIt was just like any other ordinary tree, with the only difference being that there were small paper notes hanging from its branches.\nI had already seen the tree before, so I explained,\n“I heard that the tree came from the seed given by the Holy Lord. There is also a legend that if you write down your wish on a piece of paper and hang it up on its branch, your wish will come true.”\n“Do you believe that? It sounds quite childish…”\nContrary to what she said, Shael was giving the tree an interested look. She seemed quite eager to write a wish on a paper and hang it on the tree right away.\n“Would you like to try it?”\nShael immediately nodded her head.\nAfter taking a piece of paper that was placed in front of the tree, I gave it to Shael.\nI myself didn’t really want to do it, since I had done it alone when I came to the tree without Shael.\nAfter Shael was done with writing her wish, we approached the huge tree. It was so huge that Shael gasped in surprise.\n“Where do I attach it?”\nCountless pieces of paper were already attached to its numerous branches. So we would have to find a place to attach it somehow.\n“Put it on the highest place.” Shael said as she handed me the paper.\nOf course, she wouldn’t be satisfied with just any place, it had to be the highest one!\n“…”\n“…ah, and you can’t peak at my wish.” Shael hurriedly added.\n‘It’s annoying, but…’\nI still wanted to do it. I, who had done it before, also hung my paper on the highest branch of the tree using my magic.\nAnd so, I received Shael’s paper, and put on the highest branch of the tree.\nI was curious about the contents of the paper, but I managed to control myself since Shael was watching me like a hawk.\n“Hmm..let’s go.”\nAfter confirming that I had hung the paper, Shael began to hurriedly walked away.\nIt was very sudden, but I couldn’t help but smile since she was still holding on to my hand, and asked Shael,\n“What is it?”\n“I don’t know.”\nThe reason Shael was doing this was obvious. It was clear that she had placed an embarrassing wish on the tree.\n“What did you wish for?”\n“Don’t ask.”\n“Actually, I’ve already checked.”\n“…!”\nI felt Shael tightening her grip on my hand, so I had no choice but to spit out the truth right away.\n“It was a joke!”\nAfter glaring at me once, Shael suddenly reaches out and pointed at something with her hand.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "It was a solution for Shael, who didn’t want to think about the wish anymore.\nThe cathedral, expansive enough to rival a town in size, housed various structures within, and the one Shael indicated was particularly notable—a magnificent edifice, its purpose remained elusive due to the unique architectural style of the Holy Land.\n“…”\nWe went in without saying anything. Perhaps it would be correct to say that I was dragged in, as if were being pulled by an unseen force.\nThe interior was illuminated by a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, casting light even in the absence of occupants. Rows of Hyaan flowers, symbolizing the Holy Land, adorned the space, accompanied by numerous seats and blue candles, setting an ambient atmosphere.\n‘A wedding hall.’\nI mused to myself, captivated by its beauty. Thanks to the Blessing Meeting, the hall appeared deserted, allowing us to explore undisturbed.\nUpon inspecting the hall, my attention turned to Shael, who still engrossed in her emotions. Without even intending to vocalize my thoughts, I found myself saying, \"I like this place.\"\n“I agree.”\nShael replied, seemingly caught off guard. Her subconscious response mirrored my own, and as realization dawned, she gritted her teeth.\nI thought that if I gave her some time, she would calm down, but strangely, as time passed, Shael’s face became more red.\n\"You didn’t…\" She muttered, her voice barely audible.\n\"What is it?\" I inquired, sensing her discomfort as I drew nearer.\nShael attempted to shield herself by crossing her arms, “The wish.”\n“…?”\n“You didn’t read it…” She began, her words trailing off, then she averted her gaze, resembling a delicate creature in her agitation.\n‘Why is she suddenly acting like that?’\nI wanted to ask, but…if I did, it seemed that it would agitate Shael even more, so I decided against it.\nInstead, I continued to hold Shael’s hand, as we ventured onward.\n* * *\nWe returned to our accommodation provided by the Holy Land.\nI wanted to walk more, but it was impossible. I was worried about Shael’s blushing face after seeing the wedding hall. So I wanted to let her get some rest.\nOnce Shael settled on the couch, my plan was to prepare dessert for her.\nSo now was the time for Shael to be very happy.\nAs expected, Shael glanced in my direction, expecting dessert. Her eyes looked like they were asking me to bring dessert right away.\nKnock! Knock!\nHowever, Shael's anticipated happiness was interrupted by a knock at the door.\nLeaving Shael to sigh in disappointment, I answered the door.\nKikiiik!\nBefore me stood the butler of the Baslett family, bearing a weighty box.\n\"Young Lord, I came as you said.\" He announced.\nHaving tasked him before the Blessing Meeting, I acknowledged his efforts and dismissed him.\nDuke Ezran, my father, had been absent from the house to take care of some responsibilities. Therefore, I now had to take care of the administrative side of things in the territory.\nDespite wanting an undisturbed time with Shael, her propensity for sleep allowed me to address paperwork while she rested.\nWhen Shael inquired about the matter, I had explain my nighttime activities.\nMeanwhile, the butler was done with unpacking the documents from the box—starting with all sorts of papers, and piles of letters that were sent to the Baslett family.\n“Good job. You may leave.” I asked the butler to return, and found Shael rummaging through the box.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Let me help you.”\n“It’s okay, you don't have to.” I assured, but Shael's attention was already fixed on a stack of letters. Among them, an unusually ornate letter caught her eye—a missive clearly intended for more personal matters.\nRecognizing the nature of the letter, I inwardly sighed.\nThough engaged to Shael, the status of the Baslett family attracted unwanted attention. These letters, presumably from noble ladies seeking a connection, posed a potential threat to our relationship.\n\"Make an excuse…\" Shael said, with cold eyes, her demeanor markedly different from moments ago when she blushed and avoided my gaze.\nGoblin:\nThis chapter was supposed to come out yesterday, but I had to deal with some issues (as I so frequently do) and, by the time I was done, I didn’t the energy to do anything.

      "content": "A moment of silence prevailed. However, Shael's intense gaze disrupted the peace in the atmosphere.\nTo appease her, I quickly offered excuses, \"I belong to a ducal house, so I often receive random letters targeting my status.\"\n\"I am also of the duke’s blood, but I have never received such a letter before.\" Shael retorted.\n‘Of course you didn’t!’\nRumors about Shael’s bad personality were well known across the land, and Duke Jespen, her doting father, would have prevented such a letter from ever reaching her.\nAnyways, this was a crisis. Though unintended, the situation threatened to displease Shael.\n\"Go to your room and do your work.\" She instructed, handing me the box of documents.\nAnd, it seemed that she had already taken away all the letters.\nIn an attempt to escape Shael's disapproving gaze, I accepted the box and retreated to my room, sighing. Although I avoided the immediate situation, I was uncertain how to ease Shael's anger.\n‘Why are there so many documents?'\nThe upcoming Imperial Festival piled up paperwork in the box, a volume that even Duke Ezran would find overwhelming.\nAs I flipped through the documents, the sound of fluttering papers from across the room indicated Shael was examining all the letter.\nShrrrrrttt!\nThen, I heard the sound of the letters being torn, which repeated for a while until eventually stopping.\nOnly then could I focus on the documents. Noteworthy among them was information about the Kingdom of Perin next to the Empire, particularly a document about the Baslett family’s villa.\n‘I’d like to go there with Shael for a vacation in the future.’\nConsidering Shael's inexperience, strengthening our relationship seemed opportune. It was a silver lining in an otherwise challenging situation.\nKnock! Knock!\nAs I envisioned my future trip with Shael, a loud, seemingly angry knock interrupted my thoughts. It was clear who was on the other side.\nI calmly walked towards the door, but before I could, Shael opened the door and entered.\nUnable to suppress a laugh, I questioned, \"Did you want something?\"\n\"Nope.\" Shael smiled and handed me a reduced box of letters, \"I didn’t touch the important letters, so please read them all.\"\n\"Okay…\"\nThump!\nBefore I could respond, she closed the door with a moderate force that carried a hint of playful anger. I looked at the box Shael gave me, anticipating a challenging day due to the already numerous documents.\nObserving the accumulating letters, it became clear the task wouldn't be completed in a single day. And here I was yearning to spend time with Shael after finishing work promptly.\nSetting aside those thoughts, I picked up a letter.\n[Anabtieune Vazerasleinaim]\nThe sender's name, Vazerasleinaim, was unfamiliar. I had memorized most of the noble family names of importance, but this one was unusually long.\nNo, why is the name so long in the first place?\nPuzzled, I read the letter.\n[There is a rumor going around the social sphere. Rumors about Eran Baslett’s dirty character. They say men who cheat are not popular. Rumor has it that Young Lord is a cheater, is that true?]\nInsults aimed at me were scattered throughout the poorly formatted letter with no indication of the recipient.\nUpon seeing the introduction, I immediately recognized the true sender– Shael.\nEven with an attempt to blur the handwriting intentionally, I couldn’t be deceived. The contents revealed Shael as the sender.\nAfter scrutinizing the letter Shael had diligently written, I turned my attention to another letter.\nThis one was entirely different.\n[Anielaine Abrezvelaintrumpet.]\nRecognizing the sender, I couldn't help but laugh. Apparently, Shael has lost her naming sense.\nSuppressing laughter, I read the content.\n[I am Anielaine, who runs a clothes shop.]\nAs expected, the letter deviated from proper format, portraying the sender as a clothes shop owner.\n[Young Lord, I watched the sweet meeting between Young Lady Shael and Young Lord. It made me want to give my all for the love of the two of you. That’s why, as an excellent wedding dress craftsman, I want to try making a wedding dress for Young Lady Shael. I wrote a letter asking for this.\nWould you be kind enough to tell us when your marriage with Young Lady Shael will be held?]\nA letter inquiring about marriage, expressing a desire to craft a wedding dress without any prior formal arrangements. Again, it was evident that the true sender was Shael.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can. You can also support me and sponsor chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "I finished reading the letters. However, I didn't expect that it would affect me in such a way.\nSo I read the letter once more.\nIn order to savor the emotion, I contemplated the contents and crafted a reply for Shael in another letter.\nSoon, the letter to Shael was complete—an earnest expression of my feelings for Shael, who had been exhibiting peculiar behavior lately.\nActually, I intended to use this later to calm her down.\nI couldn't help it, as the letters conveyed something significant—Shael was still feeling insecure..\nAlthough I could have simply handed it to Shael by opening the door, but I refrained. Because I knew that Shael, who was curious about my reply, would eventually open the door and come in herself.\nAnyways, I had also found a peculiar contract enclosed in the box Shael had given me.\n‘What could this be?’\nI took out the contract hidden among the letters, and read it. It bore the distinctive writing style that could only belong to Shael.\n[Eran Baslett is forbidden from coming into contact with the opposite gender except for Shael Azbel.]\n[Eran Baslett will make dessert for Shael Azbel every day.]\n[Eran Baslett will get Shael Azbel’s permission before he has a meeting with anyone.]\n…(omitted)…\n[Even if Eran Baslett becomes a duke, he will give more priority to spending time in the Azbel family than his work.]\nShael's handwriting, previously straight, became increasingly curved. It must have been due to the shame she was feeling as she wrote.\nFrom the contents, it was obviously a contract embodying Shael's wishes. On the reverse side, there was even a place for signature.\n‘Isn't this contract ridiculously unfair?'\nThere was nothing in it that was advantageous towards me, yet I signed it anyways. And, it was something I was determined to fulfill. If this could offer even a modicum of stability to Shael, it would be to my advantage.\nKikrriiik!\nAs soon as I finished signing, the door swung open.\nConcealing the signed contract, I questioned Shael, \"What is it?\"\n\"The butler told me to hurry and get a reply to the letter. It's been quite a while, so, of course, you wrote a reply, right? I heard that the letter from the clothing shop is particularly urgent…\"\n\"I wrote a lot.\"\nThe butler told her to hurry? Nonsense!\nThe butler must have already returned to the Baslett family.\nI pretended to believe her lie and handed the reply to Shael, along with the contract.\nKikrrriiik!\nHowever, Shael left before I could even give the contract to her.\n\"She must be quite anxious…\"\nAnyway, since I sent a reply, sooner or later, I would be able to see her blushing face.\nAwaiting Shael's reaction, I started perusing the remaining papers to pass the time.\n***\n[Shael’s POV]\nShael hurriedly walked over, and pressed herself against the room's wall, wanting to get as far away from Eran as possible.\nThen she looked at the reply in her hands.\nUpon checking, the response to the letter she had sent, posing as the clothing shop's owner, was there. Shael took a deep breath and began reading the letter.\n[I will think more about the wedding dress. First of all, I want to respect Shael's opinion more than mine.]\nShael frowned. She didn't care about the wedding dress anyway.\n[Would you be kind enough to tell us when your marriage with Young Lady Shael will be held?]\nYes, it wasn't the wedding dress that mattered. The answer to this question came first!\nBut there was nothing related to it. It was so strange that Shael doubted her eyes.\nShe stared at the letter in disbelief, making a sullen expression. Her raised head was already facing the floor. Shael's hand, holding the letter, trembled. A constant feeling of uneasiness ran through her mind.\nEver since witnessing the conversation between the Mage Tower Lord and Eran, as well as the numerous letters aimed at her lover had left Shael in distress.\n\"…\"\nWhat if, by any chance, the doubt turn out to be true?\n‘It would be clear to anyone that I was acting suspicious. In fact, I deserve it. I have been bullying Eran for a long time.’\nIf she thought back to her memories of the past, no matter how much Eran tried to get close to her, she would always insult him. Anyone would get tired of such a vile behavior.\nFeeling sad, tears welled up in Shael’s eyes.\nShe kept feeling sad over trivial things. She felt that she was stupid. She felt pathetic for shying away from doing things that other people wouldn't mind doing.\nShael continued to curse herself inwardly, and lowered her hand holding the letter to erase even a little bit of the miserable feeling she had in her heart.\nAnd after she calmed down, she would go to Eran, hiding her true feelings, saying she wanted to eat desserts.\nIt was then that a clear sound awakened the darkness in Shael's head.\nTooung!\nSomething fell from the letter Eran had handed to her, making a clear sound as it collided with the floor.\nShael focused her eyes, blurred by her little tears.\nAnd, she noticed a ray of golden light illuminated by the light of the lamp.\nThe ring, which had arbitrarily illuminated Shael's hazy mind, rolled on the floor.\nGoblin:\nI have been sick for the past three days, so I couldn’t post any chapters.

      "content": "I heard light footsteps near the door, indicating that Shael was walking in front of it.\nHowever, she wasn’t opening the door, so it was clear that she was nervous. The reason for that was most likely due to the ring I had placed in the letter I had given to her.\nIt wasn't the same ring I had bought at the accessory shop in the past; this one had a golden jewel that softly shimmered in the light. So, even someone like Shael would have understood the significance of that ring, and the letter itself also conveyed a message about marriage.\nKnock! Knock!\nShael knocked on the door; then without even waiting for permission, she opened it and entered the room.\nUpon entering she looked at me blankly, as if she wanted to say something.\nExamining Shael's hand, I noticed the ring, which was yet to adorn her finger. So I remarked while looking at the ring, “It may be difficult to get married right away, but it is something that will happen eventually.”\nI had to say that despite giving her a ring. Although I felt sorry for Shael, but it was also true that it was too early for such a joyous occasion. I had to resolve everything related to Clie first.\nFor now, I decided to express my honest feelings to Shael, who appeared uneasy, even though I knew she might express dissatisfaction.\nContrary to my thoughts, Shael nodded as if she understood, and said, “Then, take the ring back.”\nIn contrast to her previous childish fights, Shael approached me in a more mature manner. The distance was so close that we could feel our breath.\nThen, Shael pulled my arm, and I reluctantly got up from my seat to follow her.\nHer destination was the bed.\n“Go to sleep.”\n“There are things we haven’t finished yet…”\nShael cut me off with a glare.\nHelpless, I threw myself onto the bed, and Shael lay down next to me.\n“What the hell is this?”\n“…”\nI didn't even hear her response. When I checked on Shael, she was already asleep with her eyes closed.\n‘Was she that sleepy?’\nI was immediately convinced of the fact. It was actually quite normal for Shael, who usually slept early, especially considering the events of the day.\nI wasn't sleepy yet, but Shael was sleeping while holding my shoulder, and I didn't want to wake her.\nReluctantly, I closed my eyes, quietly hugging Shael, and easily fell asleep.\n***\nMy eyes opened early in the morning, before the sun was yet to rise.\nShael, who slept a lot, was still asleep.\nAfter looking at Shael's face and waking up my hazy mind, I carefully stood up from the bed so as not to disturb her.\nI needed to check the documents; even though I wanted to spend time with Shael, I had to attend to paperwork while she slept.\nLeaving the room, I glanced at the documents on the desk in the living room.\n‘It’s time to work…’\nDocuments gradually diminished over time, and usually, I would handle them without complaint.\nBut boredom crept in, as I kept thinking about wanting to see Shael.\nAt that moment, the door opened.\nKikiiik!\nShael opened the door and came out. Despite just waking up, she looked at me with a clear gaze.\n“What are you doing?”\n“What? I'm handling the Baslett family’s papers.”\n“…”\nShael glared at me with dissatisfied eyes, expressing a discontent I couldn't understand.\n“Hmmph!”\n“Eh?”\nShael gave a short snort and went back into the room, clearly dissatisfied.\nI continued to work on the documents, contemplating the possible reasons for her dissatisfaction. Strangely, I subconsciously rose from the chair.\nI wanted to speak with Shael.\nKnock! Knock!\nAs I knocked on the door, I heard the sound of Shael moving inside the room.\nEventually, Shael's voice came through the door.\n“What?”\n“May I come in? I’ll work on the papers later…”\n“No, go work on them now.”\nI was immediately convinced.\nShael was expressing her displeasure because I hadn’t spent time with her and had gone straight to checking the documents upon waking up.\nShe didn’t directly verbalize her displeasure. Perhaps she thought it would make her appear weak if she admitted it aloud.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "From my perspective, the situation seemed unfair.\nShael's actions seemed quite outrageous. Despite that, I found myself chuckling at her adorable behavior.\nHaving noticed that I was still standing in front of the door, and Shael urged, \"Go.\"\n\"I won't.\"\n\"Eran Baslett, go check the Baslett family’s documents!\"\nShael daringly used both my first and last names, hinting at her own frustration.\n\"There must be many important matters concerning the Baslett family.\"\nShael's words were blunt, yet behind the closed door, I sensed her waiting for my response.\nSo how could I alleviate Shael’s anger?\nWith a hand on the stubborn doorknob, I remarked, \"This isn't Eran Baslett.\"\nSimultaneously, I swung the door open, catching Shael off guard.\nIgnoring her surprised expression, the first words out of my mouth conveyed my true feelings to Shael.\n\"I came as Shael Azbel's lover!\"\nThis was a statement I had never voiced so brusquely before, and it initially made me cringe.\nNevertheless, I felt a peculiar satisfaction.\n“What are you doing…”\nShael subconsciously cried out, but even while looking bewildered, she managed to contain her surprise. Blushing, she raised her head, but her mouth remained tightly closed.\n\"Why, is there a problem?\"\nShael remained silent, quite different from her usual self. Unlike the previous day, when she was open and communicative, Shael closed her mouth as if she didn’t want to talk to me.\nIt made me feel embarrassed, leaving me in quite a bit of distress.\nDid this mean she was unwilling to communicate further?\nSuch thoughts would be embarrassing for anyone.\nIn reality, I hadn't done much wrong. In order to spend a little more time with Shael, all I wanted to do was peruse the documents without her knowledge. Trying to understanding the reason behind her sadness required a multitude of complex considerations.\nWas she behaving like that because she wanted to see me as soon as she woke up?\nIf so, it was an unexpectedly endearing motive—something that would dumbfound anyone who heard it.\nHowever, Shael's actions didn't surprise me too much. From the start, Shael had a unique way of thinking.\nCompared to her acts of stepping on beautiful flowers and bullying cute birds, this admission was like an angelic gesture.\nDespite the confusion surrounding the situation, all doubts dissipated when faced with the adorable Shael.\nIn any case, my course of action was clear.\nIf Shael was upset, I needed to fix her mood. If she felt sad, my goal would be to make her happy.\nSimilarly, if Shael remained silent, I had to coax her into speaking.\nAs I approached the silent Shael, she initially turned her head away, seemingly unaffected.\nHowever, that changed as I closed the distance even more, almost within touching distance.\n\"Are you going to keep silent?\"\n\"…\"\nNormally, she would have protested with a blushing face.\nBut this time, she remained silent, her cheeks trembling as if in defiance.\nGrasping Shael's soft cheek, I tried to elicit a reaction, but she stubbornly kept her lips sealed. Her fighting spirit intensified, and she refused to succumb.\nShael's lips parted, producing a teasing sound of wind—a clear provocation.\nI gazed at her rosy cheeks, softer than before, and then at her tightly sealed lips.\nHer lips looked soft, and I noticed the subtle scent of grapes, the fragrance unique to Shael. Despite her attempt to turn away, Shael's body subtly faced me.\nEach small detail endeared her to me.\nShaking off distracting thoughts, I focused on Shael. It wasn't the time to be distracted; I wanted to ease her heart.\nShael's lips parted once more, their softness evident.\nHowever, this time, different thoughts occupied my mind—an overwhelming desire to claim Shael's lips, to press mine against hers.\nI doubted anything would ever make me feel this embarrassed.\nBut the thought continued to race through my mind.\nGoblin:\nAs you know, I have been sick for the past few days, so I couldn’t post any chapters.

      "content": "I managed to look away from Shael’s lips, but she already seemed conscious of my gaze upon her. This was evident from the fact that Shael’s mouth, which had been firmly closed to avoid speaking, remained open.\n“Ah,” Shael expelled a silent breath. Then, she closed her mouth and fell silent, signifying that she would leave the difficult task to me. Next, Shael tightly closed her eyes, turning her head towards me as if granting permission.\nI, too, closed my eyes and approached Shael. It was a very tense yet exciting moment. However, ki*ssing Shael was not as easy as it sounded.\nCertainly, by this point, I should have made contact with Shael’s lips, but for some reason it wasn’t happening. Feeling uneasy, I opened my closed eyes and slowly looked at Shael, only to find that she was slowly withdrawing her head.\n“What are you doing?” I inquired.\nShael remained silent. Her shyness was apparent, creating a moment of uncertainty.\nPerhaps, Shael might not be ready for it yet. Suppressing the amused look on my face, I approached Shael, giving Shael more time to confirm her feelings.\nHowever, that naive notion was soon dispelled.\n“I'm not stupid…” I heard Shael’s voice, and simultaneously, Shael grabbed my shoulder. Then she began to approach me.\n‘Wasn't it you who pulled her head away first?’ I couldn't articulate that fact because Shael's face was getting closer and closer by the second.\nShael, closing her eyes, halted as she trembled, facing the challenge of her own shyness.\nIt was a tense moment for both of us.\nYet, I didn't want to let the situation pass just because of nervousness.\nI grabbed Shael's shoulder as she stopped, and our lips met.\nIt was the moment I had anticipated.\nWe released each other's shoulders, holding onto each other closely as if craving more connection. It was only then that I could truly feel the sensation of ki*ssing Shael. Despite the surreal situation, Shael's warm and soft lips made me accept it as reality.\nI could faintly feel Shael’s breath, and Shael exhaled gently, wondering if her breath could reach me.\nSuppressing a laugh, I found myself in the same state as Shael.\nSuddenly, I felt something on my arm. Shael’s hand, previously hovering aimlessly, grabbed me. Shael's shaking hand conveyed strength and determination not to let go.\nA resonant bell marked the morning in the Holy Land, disrupting the moment.\nShael calmly continued ki*ssing me despite the loud sound.\nEmbracing Shael's waist, I felt strangely content with the unbelievable situation.\nI could feel Shael’s breathing, initially soft, gradually became rougher.\nI tried to pull away due to Shael's increasing discomfort, but Shael held the back of my head, preventing me from breaking the ki*ss.\nI attempted to pull away again, but only Shael remained adamant, never letting me go.\nThe heat on our faces intensified, and it was fortunate that the window was open, allowing the wind to cool the heated atmosphere. Without it, my faces would have also turned as red as Shael's in embarrassment.\nShael drew closer, and I wondered about her expression. Was she ki*ssing me calmly, or did she feel ashamed with her blushing face?\nEven though the wind cooled the heat, my face might also be quite red.\nAs if she read my hearst, Shael drew even closer. And, in order to respond to her actions, I embraced her even more. However, still curious about Shael’s expression, I slightly opened my eyes.\nYet I couldn’t keep them open for long and closed them again.\nAs it turned out, Shael was also attempting to open her eyes, and after meeting her gaze, I felt embarrassed and had to close my eyes again\nTime itself seemed to stop. However, the throbbing hearts indicated the passage of time, as we savored the ki*ss in a calm atmosphere.\nIt was only after some time had passed that Shael and I separated.\nI remained silent.\nFeeling the embarrassment, I empathized with Shael, who seemed to have lost her ability to speak.\n\"Let's go out.\" I said.\nActually, I wanted to ask Shael how she felt after the ki*ss, but I was too distracted, and the words just escaped my lips.\nShael couldn't respond with words, but she stood up from her seat, indicating her agreement.\nThere was still some time left before the Blessing Meeting concluded. I wanted to dissipate the awkward atmosphere between us and get some fresh air. It was especially true for Shael, whose face still radiated heat.\nAnd so, we left the accommodation.\nAs the wind blew, a slowly walked forwards and asked, \"Where would you like to go?\"\n\"It was delicious.\"\nI had asked where she wanted to go…but Shael responded with a completely unrelated statement.\nHer blushing face indicated that she was aware of what she just did, but the words she said couldn’t be taken back anymore, leaving her face as red as ever.\nWell, perhaps she responded abruptly due to her distracted state of mind. So, I didn’t tease her for it.\nWhen Shael's face improved somewhat, the fragrance of flowers reached us. Following the fragrance, we reached a gigantic cathedral in the Holy Land.\nThe place was a garden filled with rare flowers, fitting for a Holy Land.\nShael, aiming to break the awkward atmosphere, pointed at a flower and said, \"I like this flower.\"\nIt was a type of flower I had never seen before, emitting a small amount of white light. Under the flower, there was a sign for explanation.\nShael read it aloud, \"Moon Wind Flower. According to legend, it gazes at those around who crave love the most…\"\nThe flower seemed to be gazing at Shael. Shael alternately looked at me and the Moon Wind Flower, creating a playful interaction.\nI couldn't help but laugh at Shael's cute actions and asked, \"What's the point of forcing it to turn?\"\n\"Is it not meaningful enough?\" Shael replied confidently, then took my arm and led me to look at other flowers.\nAlthough I also wanted to appreciate the flowers, the next event of the Blessing Meeting was about to begin, and time was slipping away.\nSo I had to inform Shael, \"The next event of the Blessing Meeting is about to start.\"\n\"So?\" Shael asked, seemingly indifferent. She evidently wished to skip the uninteresting event.\nActually, the Blessing Meeting wasn't that crucial. The upcoming even wasn't mandatory for us as well. Initially, I decided to attend the Blessing Meeting to conclude the matters related to Clie.\nHowever, Shael, who lacked patience was hampering my plans. So I attempted to convince her, saying, \"Still, as a guest, wouldn't it be better to stick to the Blessing Meeting schedule? It's a matter of politeness.\"\n\"Politeness?\" Shael smiled, adopting a challenging expression. \"Someone who doesn't even adhere to the Holy Land’s rules is talking about politeness?\"\n\"Rules?\" I inquired, though I knew there were rules. I couldn't deny breaking them. I remained silent, and Shael continued, \"Isn't it a rule in the Holy Land to forbid the expression of affection between a man and a woman?\"\nI froze at Shael's words, as they hit uncomfortably close to home.\nShael approached me with a sly smile, placing her finger on my lips.\n\"Three times, please,\" She said, blushing after her bold statement.\nIt was a cute threat, one that I had no choice but to comply with.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "I did just as Shael had instructed— three ki*sses.\nDespite it not being our first time, each ki*ss felt as exhilarating as the first, leaving me contemplating the foolishness of my own racing heart.\nI could feel her breath tremble with anticipation, and when I embraced and ki*ssed her, Shael quivered with emotion.\nKi*ssing Shael was always exciting, and this time was no different.\nAfter a considerable amount of time had passed, it was now time to conclude the prolonged ki*ss.\nI erased the lingering feelings of regret, and ended the ki*ss.\nEven after sharing the ki*ss, Shael blushed naturally.\nFeeling that the time was right, I asked Shael, \"Can we go to the Blessing Meeting event now?\"\nShael shook her head in response, displaying a hint of displeasure.\nI accepted her refusal, understanding that if she didn't feel comfortable, I couldn't force her. However, before I could respond, Shael retrieved something from her pocket.\n\"Focus…\" she urged, presenting a blue ring attached to a chain. Shael waved it enticingly, catching my attention.\nIt was evident what the ring was intended for. Despite Shael's attempts at deception, I recalled the title of the book she had purchased – a book that undoubtedly featured such a ring.\nObserving Shael's actions, I realized she hadn't even properly read the book. The use of magic to manipulate the mind couldn't be achieved with a single ring, especially considering Shael's casual approach to such matters.\n\"What are you doing?\" I inquired.\n\"You might start to feel a bit dizzy…\" Shael responded, looking at me with eagerness.\nFeeling somewhat compelled, I focused on the ring with blurred eyes.\nShael seized the opportunity, placing the ring on me.\nConfused by her bold actions, I pulled back my hand.\n\"Give me your hand,\" She requested.\nI complied, feeling like an animal being examined.\nShael's gaze was akin to that of an owner looking at a pet. As if complimenting me, she reached out and stroked my hair.\nShael's eyes gleamed with anticipation.\n‘Is my acting convincing?’\nI mused, as Shael seemed to want me to fall for her trick.\n\"Don't remember everything about an hour from now,\" Shael whispered with a sly smile, attempting to control the situation.\nAlthough I barely contained my laughter, I still focused on her words.\nShael, who was confident in her hypnosis abilities, then gestured with outstretched arms, seemingly inviting an embrace.\nAnd so, I surrendered to Shael, allowing her to continue with her plan.\nShael's current bold expression contrasted with her typically shy demeanor. Thanks to the supposed hypnosis, Shael openly expressed her love, believing I wouldn't remember.\n\"Ki*ss me…\" Shael requested, directing my lips towards hers.\nI reciprocated by first initiating a hug, but she interrupted the process.\n\"Stop it now,\" She insisted.\n\"I dislike it…\" Shael responded, a brief surprise overcoming her, quickly replaced by a lingering embarrassment.\nUndeterred, I approached Shael and ki*ssed her on the lips.\nAfter the prolonged ki*ss, I softly inquired, \"What?\"\n\"You tricked me…\" Shael questioned, \"Have you been conscious all along?\"\nI chose not to respond directly, letting my silence affirm her suspicions.\nShael's face flushed with shame.\n\"Say something!\" She urged, seeking an explanation.\n\"Did you want to ki*ss me that much?\" I evaded a direct answer.\n“…”\nTo say I tricked her was an overstatement. Who was the one who tried to trick me first?\nAfter giving time for the frantic Shael to calm down, I asked, “By the way, I have a question for you.”\n“What is it?”\nIt was something I’ve been thinking about since last night. I wanted to find out the answer together with Shael.\n“If there is someone who threatens your life. What would you do?”\nI was of course talking about Clie.\nIn the previous timeline, Clie must have gone through a through a hellish experience because of Shael. So she must hate her to the extreme.\nSo, I wanted to ask Shael for her opinion. Because it wasn’t just my problem.\nIn the first place, the most important thing to me was Shael. It someone posed a danger to Shael, I had to get rid of it. What Shael did to Clie in the previous timeline was unrelated to the current Shael.\nBut there was a problem.\n‘Will Clie really let us go without any resistance?’\nClie lost her powers and was running out of time, but still, I couldn’t relax.\nIt was a world where all kinds of improbable objects existed. So we couldn’t rule out the possibility that Clie would be able to harm us. Maybe there was another item that could cure her disease. If that was the case, it was obvious what would happen. We would have to go through the same experience again.\nBut I couldn’t act hastily.\nThe Mage Tower Lord and Crown Prince was still on Clie’s side. So I had to be careful in everything I do.\n‘If I hand over the earrings and make a contract of some sort, wouldn’t she leave me and Shael alone?’\n‘Nope…that’s a stupid idea.’\nAs I brushed away that thought, I heard Shael’s voice.\n“Am I the only one whose life is being threatened?” Shael asked as she looked at me.\nThe question was whether I was included in the target of the threat.\n“Perhaps, I’m also included.”\n\"Then we have to punish them…\" Shael asserted, her words carrying a sense of determination.\n\"And what if it’s dangerous?\" I questioned, contemplating our future.\n\"Then, we should live together in a quiet farm-like place for a few months,\" Shael proposed, suggesting an extreme but thoughtful choice.\nShael's words resonated with me, offering clarity on our next steps. The potential threats involving improbable objects could be countered by using similar items. As I pondered future strategies, my focus returned to Shael.\nThe wind blew, and I observed Shael standing gracefully, her expression reminded me of the past.\nThere was much to be done, such as addressing issues with Clie, correcting Shael's habits, and contemplating our impending marriage.\nAs I looked at Shael, I could predict her next actions after spending considerable time together. Shael, seemingly aware of my inner turmoil, had a mischievous glint in her eyes.\n\"Actually, I didn't want to ki*ss you,\" Shael confessed, struggling to contain her laughter. She even feigned anger, placing her hand on her waist, but her actions betrayed her true intentions.\nAnyways, regardless of what plans she had, I would welcome it with open arms.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Shael looked at me with a provoking gaze.\nShe said that she didn’t want to ki*ss me, however it was far from the truth.\nI, of course, didn’t do as Shael wished. I only jokingly replied, “Is that so? Then why did you ask for the ki*sses first?”\n“…”\nShael bit her lips, and glared at me as if telling me to forget about that right away.\nI nodded in agreement.\nFirst of all, I needed to know why Shael was doing this.\n“Okay. So what do you want to say?”\n“Hmm…it’s that I didn’t want to ki*ss you.”\n‘So, what?’\nShael made a sad expression, then, she made a remark that made me look like a bad guy.\n“I think you forced me.”\n“…”\nNow who was it that wrapped her arms around the back of my head so we wouldn’t be able to part our lips?\nIt was Shael!\nIt was also Shael that approached me first, and after that, she asked her for a ki*ss.\nIn fact, she had seduced me!\nSo, there’s no way she really didn’t want to ki*ss me.\nEven now, as she complained about the supposed injustice, she could hide the smile on her face.\nAnyways, I suddenly became curious as to why Shael was doing this. While I was lost in my thoughts, I heard Shael’s voice.\n“So, take responsibility.”\n‘Responsibility?’\nAs if to answer my question, Shael spoke up again.\n“Please pay me back for the 10 ki*sses you forced on me.”\nI almost laughed out loud, as I looked at Shael in admiration for her supposed ‘genius’ plan.\nAnd by the way, ten ki*sses? I definitely didn’t do it 10 times. I probably did it five times at most.\nShael knew that too. So it was clear that she was lying. It was a scam!\nOf course, I would gladly welcome such a scam. It was a scam that was very easy to deal with. But I couldn’t do that right now, as I was worried about Shael’s blushing face.\n“How about after taking a break?”\n“…no.”\n“Please wait a little while, I will pay back double with interest.”\nThen, Shael nodded as if she understood.\n* * *\nAfter taking a little break, I tried to ki*ss Shael.\nHowever, unexpectedly, Shael, who had been clearing her throat for a while, grabbed my hand and led me somewhere else.\n“Don’t you want a ki*ss?”\nShael didn’t answer that question. She just smiled and shook her head in silence.\nAnyway, it was impossible to tell what she was thinking. It could be perceived from all sorts of things she did for a ki*ss just a little while ago.\nSo Shael and I skipped the events of the Blessing Meeting and wandered around the cathedral. From the garden of the cathedral to the park of the cathedral where all kinds of statues were up for display.\nShael stopped in front of the huge stone statue of a woman, “What is that?”\n“A statue of a goddess that symbolized love.”\nDescriptions were written under the name of the goddess, and Shael, who was reading it, raised her head to look at me with an eager expression on her face.\n“What is it?”\n“I want to hear the old confession…again.”\nIt left me speechless. Just imagining it reminded me of the embarrassing memories of that time. I didn’t immediately comply to what Shael said, and asked, “Why do you want to hear that all of a sudden?”\n“We did it while tied with a rope.”\n‘Yes. That’s right!\nBut who was the person who tied me up?’\nAnyways, it was also an insufficient reason to say that she suddenly wanted to hear a confession.\nPerhaps knowing that, Shael, who had not been able to raise her head in shame, opened her mouth.\n“If I want you to do it, do it.”\nNow it was an order, and the option of refusal didn’t exist. Therefore, I had no choice but to follow Shael’s orders.\nShael started waiting for me to speak. I confirmed that fact, and tried hard to move my lips.\nIt was only three words.\nWords that had already been said before. But I still found it very difficult to say them. It was to the extent that it was difficult for me to even open my mouth.\nI just had to say I love you.\nBut before I could do it, I heard a voice that was not mine.\n“I love you.”\nThat voice belonged to Shael.\nShael, who had a shy expression on her face, spoke with more difficulty than I did.\n“Me too.”\nI couldn’t lose, so I also conveyed my feelings.\nAfter those words, the atmosphere became awkward. In order to find something to say, I turned my head towards the sign that had all the information about the statue of the goddess.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "“No, don’t look at it!”\nI failed to read the explanation because Shael hurriedly covered the sign with her body.\nIt was a bit suspicious to say the least, but then again, she often found it fun to needlessly disturb me.\nStill, I was a bit intrigued because of her sudden intense reaction, but I didn’t try to check it forcefully.\nI planned to check it again someday, but right now, I wanted to spend time holding Shael’s hand.\nI couldn’t even open my mouth because of the atmosphere and grabbed Shael’s hand. However, Shael naturally opened her mouth as if she had completely forgotten about the incident from just before.\n“It took you long enough…”\nAgain, she said something that was beyond my scope of comprehension, and before I could ask, Shael added.\n“You have to pay the interest…you have to pay it back.”\n‘So it was about a ki*ss.’\nShe had asked me to repay my so called “debt” in ki*sses before. But I put it off because of her blushing face.\n“It was ten ki*sses, and roughly five hours passed….if the amount doubles every hour, then…”\nFeeling bewildered at Shael’s words, I couldn’t help but ask, “Less than four hours have passed. Even so, why the hell does the amount double every hour?”\nI did promise to pay her back with interest. But that didn’t included the fact that the amount would double in an hour.\nShael didn’t care and just ignored my question. She seemed to be too focused on the calculations as she opened her mouth.\n“The amount should be 320.”\n‘320!? Where did she get that from?’\nWell, it was not an impossible amount. But, kissing someone 320 times sounded a bit absurd.\n‘Won’t our lips wear out?’\nHowever, Shael continued talking as if she didn’t care about my worries, “Hmmm…the number 320 is a bit inconvenient…”\nThe expression on Shael’s face changed, and at first glance, I identified it as the classic sneer of a villainess.\nHowever, it still seemed quite cute smile in my eyes. Nowadays, Shael would often glare at me from time to time as well, but I thought of them as her own clumsy way of expressing her affection.\nAs I was lost in my thoughts, Shael opened her mouth, “1,000 times would be nice.”\nHer words prompted me to look at Shael with a bewildered expression. As I was taken aback by the unexpected claim, Shael spoke up as if she was making an excuse.\n“As they say, more is better.”\n“There is also a saying that too much can be bad.”\nShael didn’t respond to my words. She just continued to stare, and before I knew it, the distance between us had gotten smaller. And adding to that, Shael also stuck out her face.\nIt was the kind of situation where I was unable to refute Shael’s words anymore.\nIt was also the moment when 1,000 ki*sses turned into 999 ki*sses.\nThe atmosphere was quiet and warm, and a thought passed through my mind in that warm silence.\nWhatever the situation, if Shael asked for it, I wouldn’t hesitate to ki*ss her.\nShael should have known that too. And so, she had created this situation.\nIt was because she was shy. So she decided to go through so much trouble so that she could ask for a ki*ss while enduring the shame.\nIt was an absurd way of thinking. But even that made me feel that she was cute.\nShael carefully removed her lips and locked her eyes with mine. Then she showed a sweet smile.\nI, too, couldn’t help but smile in return.\n“There are still a lot of them let…”\nThen she approaches me as if urging me to pay her back.\nThen I suddenly had a strange thought,\n‘It would be better to call her a loan shark than a villainess…’\nAs if to prove me right, Shael suddenly added,\n“Ah, that number is 2,000 now. Because it feels like six hours have passed.”\nOf course, there was no way that six hours had passed. So naturally, Shael was lying.\nIt was like that before, so I’ll try to put it aside. But, where the hell did the ki*ss we just finished go?\nIt was clear that Shael had intentionally ignored it.\nThis time, Shael initiated the ki*ss. And again, our lips locked.\n“…”\nIt was a debt that turned from ten to two thousand in a matter of hours. I was also not allowed to do any kind of protest. Also, any amount that I paid back would be ignored.\nThat’s right, Shael was a vicious loan shark. It was so absurd that it didn’t make any sense.\nBut the one in debt was me. So of course, I had no choice but to welcome it with open arms.\n‘Two thousand ki*sses.’\nShe already had my heart.\nSince I had already given her everything, I had nothing to offer as collateral.\nBut…I must pay her back.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "It was time for the Blessing Meeting to conclude. Regrettably, I couldn't participate in the event's second half, but the upside was the creation of many memories with Shael.\nNow, it was time to return to the Azbel family, standing before the stables housing horses of fine build.\nI got on a horse, and suggested to Shael, “Please ride behind me.”\n“…wouldn’t a carriage be a better option?” Shael asked.\n“Riding a horse isn’t as bad as you think.” I responded.\nShael expressed displeasure; after all, it was I who stopped her from using the teleportation station, as well as the horse carriage.\nNevertheless, I felt a sense of pride. All of this was to create lasting memories with Shael and satisfy my selfish desire to be close to her.\nHowever, when Shael attempted to mount the horse, it resisted. She glared at the stubborn creature and remarked, “You better be good!”\n“It will be fine in a little while. It must be because it’s not familiar with you…” I reassured her.\n“…it wasn’t like that when you were riding it.” Shael pointed out.\nWell, it was true; it never refused to let me ride.\n‘Did it notice Shael’s reluctance?’\nAlthough I was confident that it would adjust, Shael interpreted it differently. “…no way.”\n“What it is now?” I asked.\n“It’s a mare…” Shael observed.\nWhile this was true, it wasn’t the point. Was she perhaps jealous of even animals? It was indeed a peculiar notion.\n“It’s just an animal. Don’t worry and get on.” I urged.\n“…” Shael hesitated, creating a nuisance for the coachman who lent us the horse. We were still in the stable even though it had been quite some time since we borrowed the horse. In a place where the aristocratic influence had weakened, I could sense impatience from the coachman's gaze.\nApproaching the horse with a frown, Shael spoke with a glare, “I kissed this person over 100 times today!”\n“Hey, what are you…” I stammered, bewildered by her absurd words. Although true, it made me feel somewhat ashamed.\nThe coachman, too, looked quite bewildered.\nIn an attempt to salvage the situation, I quickly picked up Shael and left the stable, chiding her, “Why would you say that to an animal?”\n“What’s wrong with it?” Shael responded awkwardly.\nObserving her confident demeanor, I was also struck by a thought.\nConsidering it from another perspective, what if a male horse only entrusted his back to Shael and rejected me?\n‘…it would bother me.’\nI reasoned. While I didn't mind being rejected, if it concerned Shael, it would feel wrong.\nUnderstanding that, I enjoyed the warmth of Shael hugging me from behind. However, one thing couldn't be easily overlooked. Shael was now ignoring the horse, and when it struggled, she even glared at it, an act that needed correction.\nDespite Shael's recent loveliness, some of her habits remained unchanged. It made me wonder if she still felt remorse for the flowers she had trampled in the past while we were walking around.\nEven if the horse initially behaved a bit oddly, it was still an animal. If Shael treated it kindly from the start, everything would’ve been fine. Thus, I aimed to correct Shael’s behavior. Shael had trampled flowers and bullied innocent birds, and it was time to rehabilitate her.\n“Wouldn’t it be nice it you gently stroked it’s back?” I suggested.\nShael didn't respond audibly, but I sensed her reluctance. Ignoring her reservations, I continued, “You’re making a face that shows your feelings, meaning that you don’t want to do it. You must be dissatisfied with me for saying something you hate.”\nAfter hesitating, Shael finally spoke, “…why me?”\nI couldn’t find a suitable answer, because it wasn’t something she had to do as a must. I mean even if Shael committed bad deeds habitually, I would stick with her and help her change.\nUnexpectedly, Shael's left hand, which held me, moved to stroke the horse. The horse stopped running and began to enjoy Shael’s touch. Sensing an opportunity, I took Shael off the horse and suggested, “How about a hug? Interacting with animals feels pretty good.”\nInteracting with animals would be beneficial for personality development. It would also be helpful for Shael, who rarely spent time outside her family and with me.\nDespite my request, Shael hesitated. She only stared at me with a furrowed brow, not acting on my suggestion.\n“…tell me more reasons,” She demanded.\n“Will you deny my request?” I asked.\nShael nodded but promptly rejected my proposal.\nAttempting to persuade her, I said, “You said you loved me more than I loved you.”\nWhile my love for Shael was significant, what Shael said was true.\n“…so?” she asked.\n“The person who falls in love first, is the loser.” I explained, while I rummaged through my pocket, extracting a contract. Then I handed it to Shael. It was a contract that Shael had created for the journey, a contract that allowed no contact with people of the opposite gender except for Shael Azbel.\n“I signed it.” I confessed.\nShael blushed, looking away, but her eyes remained fixed on the contract.\n“…then give it to me.” She requested.\n“There is no benefit to me, is there?” I pointed out.\nAware of the lack of advantages for me, Shael blushed even more but kept her eyes on the contract.\n“Benefits, I want some.” I demanded.\n“…what benefits do you want?” She inquired.\n“You tell me. What will you give me?” I asked in return.\nShael hesitated before shyly confessing, “Shael…Azbel?”\nAn awkward silence ensued, the warm air of the Holy Land transforming into a chilling atmosphere.\nWell, it seemed advantageous enough for Shael to keep these provisions, to the point of imbalance. Handing over the contract, I saw Shael smile as if she was doing me a favor, shaking off her reluctance and quietly embracing the horse.\nBefore the hug concluded, I stated, “It’s an animal, but I think you should treat it with respect and praise.”\nResponding to my words, the horse thrust its face toward her, trying to lick her face. However, Shael recoiled, stating, “You can’t do that. Because I only allow one person to do that.”\nHer following words were spoken with a blush that embarrassed even me, “It looks pretty.”\nPuzzled by this unusual compliment, I wondered if Shael was doing it as a sign of respect. This thought seemed unbelievable, given her typical attitude.\nWith this, Shael and I continued in silence.\n***\nAfter spending some time with the horse, I urged it to run faster.\nSoon, an imperial festival accessible to all, regardless of social status, would take place. Before that, a gathering of all nobles would occur, and given the spread of rumors about Shael, I felt a sense of urgency.\nMy destination was a boutique, which was famous among the nobility. If we dressed in attire befitting lovers, we could enjoy the festival and abate some of the rumors surrounding Shael.\nWhile lost in thought about creating a happy time with Shael, I felt her hugging me from behind. Everything seemed fine until I realized that Shael was surreptitiously groping me.\nI gritted my teeth, silently enduring it due to my well-defined abs.\n‘Is she trying to put her hand in the suit?’\nDespite this discomfort, I remained silent, and Shael, seemingly unaware of my distress, asked, “…what about this potion?”\n“What did you say?” I replied, struggling to hear over the wind and Shael’s quiet voice.\n“It’s nothing.” She quickly dismissed.\n“…”\nNonetheless, it sounded as if she was flustered, likely due to her focus on her actions rather than my response.\n‘It shouldn’t be that important…’\nI thought, while enjoying the cool breeze and thinking about spending a happy time with Shael.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "As I rode my horse, a pleasant scent filled the air, emanating from brightly blooming flowers in the wide plain.\nIt reminded me of Shael, or more precisely, Shael's unfortunate tendency to trample on pretty flowers.\n\"I’m hungry…\" Shael exclaimed from behind, prompting a request to rest.\nDismounting my horse, and helped Shael get down as well.\nShael fixed her dress and walked through the field of wild flowers. Although her actions weren't intentional this time, it also held true that she was carelessly trampling on the beautiful flowers.\nConsidering this bad habit persisted even in the Holy Land, I felt the need to address it promptly.\n\"Why are you stepping on a flower?\" I questioned.\n\"I didn’t step on it, there was a flower where I put my foot.\" Shael confidently replied.\nWell, she always had a unique way with her words.\nSuppressing a laugh, I continued, \"Even if it wasn’t now, didn’t you trample the flowers whenever you saw them?\"\nShael nodded confidently, unbothered by my criticism.\nTherefore, I tried to convince her, \"Look at the flowers blooming everywhere. How pretty are they? Not only do they look good, but they also smell good.\"\n\"Is that so?\" Shael questioned my words, and it occurred to me that perhaps even flowers seemed disgusting to someone with such unique taste.\nFortunately, that wasn't the case.\nShael's dissatisfaction stemmed from a different issue, as she voiced, \"I don’t think you’ve ever complimented me like that before.\"\n\"Compliment?\" I was taken aback.\nShael, who had been talking about flowers, shifted the conversation to an unexpected direction.\nIt took me a moment to grasp her line of thought.\n‘Is it a problem for me to say that the flowers were pretty?'\nAfter a brief internal confirmation, I realized the severity of the situation.\nWe had been expressing affection for each other, and I couldn't control Shael's jealousy over trivial matters. Yet, it was also a heartwarming realization that her love for me had grown.\n\"Why are you silent?\" Shael's stern voice brought me back to the present.\nBefore I could respond, she added, \"I’ve been with you for a long time, and I didn’t receive any of such compliments. Yet you saw the flowers for the first time today and immediately called them beautiful. Why is there such a double standard?\"\n\"No…it’s just flowers. I absolutely have no other intention.\" It was a reflexive excuse, but it didn't take long for me to realize what Shael really wanted to hear.\nAs she waited for my words, I finally mustered an appropriate response, \"You are very pretty.\"\n\"That’s more like it.\" Shael responded, a hint of satisfaction in her demeanor.\n\"It just…I didn’t think it was important to mention such an obvious fact.\" I added, attempting to maintain a playful tone.\nShael, who had been glancing at me, nodded her head as if she had achieved her goal. Afterward, she naturally took my magic pouch and started eating dessert.\nI felt the occasional chirping of birds all around us. So I crushed a cookie, and spread it around little by little.\nHowever, I could also feel Shael’s grim gaze beside me. She was being deprived of one of her desserts, so she might be feeling hostile towards the birds as well.\nWell, Shael always tended to casually interrupt any gathering of cute birds she might find in her walks, but this time she also had a motivation.\nI intended to prevent that from happening, so I handed Shael a basket of crushed cookie crumbs and said, “Would you like to try it?”\nShael took the basket, and kept watching the birds for a while, and I realized my mistake right away, as something similar had happened before; the basket I gave to Shael was empty before I knew it.\nI should’ve predicted it, but in a moment of carelessness, I failed.\nAnd, before I could say anything, I heard Shael’s excuse, which was mixed with obvious lies.\n“I gave it to the birds.” She shamelessly lied.\nI raised an eyebrow, asking, “Is that so?”\nThen, I noticed the cookie crumbs on her mouth. The question didn't need to be asked because the answer was obvious. So I just kept staring at Shael, who kept making excuses.\n“It was a pretty bird.”\n‘A pretty bird? Could it be that she compared herself to a pretty bird?’\nAfter that excuse, Shael blushed, probably remembering the compliment I gave her a little while ago.\nIt felt very cute.\nNext, I stared at the bread crumbs on her mouth.\nSo I approached her, holding back the laughter that was about to leak out, and I said, “A pretty bird indeed, but…it’s also quite cute.”\nShael blushed as if she understood the meaning behind my words.\nAfter that, we continued our journey until we reached the Imperial boutique.\n* * *\nFinally, we arrived at our destination, the imperial boutique.\nIt was a boutique recommended by one of the Baslett family’s knights. Moreover, it was a boutique whose owner was a very high ranking nobility. So, it was safe to say that it had many clothes of good workmanship.\nShael complained as soon as she saw the boutique. “It's too shabby.”\nI responded, “It’s better than a fancy boutique. I heard that the owner is the mother of Duke Prell, so you should be polite.”\nI had heard that, due to her eccentric personality, the owner lived alone in a boutique. She was old, but I had heard that she possessed excellent military prowess, befitting the blood of a duke, and she didn’t allow any escort.\nUpon entering the boutique, I couldn’t deny that the interior was quite elegant. Its size was quite wide as well. As expected of a boutique with good reputation, there were many luxurious clothes at a glance.\n“The atmosphere is gloomy. I’d rather go to an abandoned house,” Shael remarked while she looked around.\nSince she had lived in Azbel family all the time, she must be feeling quite accustomed. Actually, it was true that the atmosphere was gloomy.\nThen I felt a presence approaching us.\nIt was an elderly woman, walking towards us with a cane as her support. The woman gave us a ferocious look as she remarked, “It’s shabby you say? And did you say that it would be better to go to an abandoned house?”\nThe owner must have found Shael’s comment quite rude.\nEven I thought that Shael’s words weren’t very appropriate either, so I couldn’t say anything, and noted that I would have to correct that habit someday.\nIn addition, I shouldn’t increase my enemies from the start. Even though she was living alone in a boutique, the owner had the blood of a ducal family. Considering the soon-to-be social gatherings and imperial festivals, it was important to build a close relationship with the Duke Prell.\nFor now, I needed to apologize for Shael’s rudeness, “I’m sorry for being rude. There was no intent to belittle.”\n“Oh, you are quite polite…unfortunately you met the wrong mate.” The owner, who had said that, turned around, as if she unwilling to sell us anything.\nThump!\n“You may leave!” Said the owner as she hit the wooden desk beside her. Then she left the place.\nShe must’ve used quite the strong force, as the desk cracked with a single hit!\nI could understand why she was running a boutique by herself. Personality-wise, she was eccentric, and her temper was quite inappropriate for her age.\n‘So the rumors were right.’\nStill, I didn’t want to give up.\nShael was the first to commit the rudeness, so she should be the one to apologize. So, I tried to talk to Shael first.\nBut before I could do that, I heard was Shael’s voice, “Shall we go somewhere else?”\n“…?”\nI thought she would spit out a series of complaints about the owner. But Shael didn’t complain; she suggested going somewhere else.\nSuddenly I noticed something interesting, and I immediately understood the situation, “Are you scared?”\n“…no…no way!.” Shael stammered.\nAnyway, it seemed right.\nShael was feeling scared!\nHonestly, it was quite funny.\nBut on second thought, it was quite natural. Shael was not used to such treatment. She was someone who grew up with all the convenience in the world, so she was truly bad at dealing with such situations.\nIt the same in the past, when I first talked back at her, she couldn’t do anything.\n“Let’s go.” Seeing her current state made me laugh.\n‘Is this the same Shael, the renowned villainess?’\nI didn’t know. In front of my eyes, there was only a cute princess.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can. You can also support me and sponsor chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "Shael had been persistently demanding to leave the boutique.\nIn response, I gestured toward the dress positioned at the center of the room, the most striking wedding dress I had ever seen. Despite its apparent unfinished state, the dress exuded a sense of perfection.\nAfter scrutinizing the dress, Shael withdrew her earlier complaints. Even I acknowledged that the beauty of the dress had the power to mollify Shael's discontent.\nAdorned with light blue frills, the dress seemed tailor-made for Shael. I couldn't help but desire to witness her wearing it at our wedding.\n“…”\nExpressing admiration, Shael finally admitted, “It’s pretty.”\n“I think so too. I really want to buy it…”\nThe real challenge, however, lay in convincing the owner to sell it, especially after Shael's earlier impolite remarks.\nAs I contemplated our next move, Shael took the initiative.\nKnock-tock!\nThe sound of Shael carefully knocking on the door filled the room, and she spoke up.\n“Please sell it.”\nThough Shael's request carried a semblance of politeness, it was evidently a failed attempt. The door remained unresponsive, a natural outcome for not apologizing first after making rude comments.\nSteering Shael away from the door, I suggested, “First of all, it would be good to ask for forgiveness for what you said earlier.”\nIdeally, I hoped Shael would reflect on her actions and apologize on her own, but the situation demanded a more immediate approach. Shael, who had never been proficient at offering apologies, presented a challenge.\nApproaching the door, Shael began, and just before she could say anything, the door swung open.\nThe owner, who had previously displayed a fiery temperament, now wore a thoughtful expression. Unexpectedly, she responded, “You are being a nuisance. Why haven’t you left yet?”\n“Sorry for my mistake earlier…”\nShael's apology, though somewhat forced, seemed to acknowledge her fault. Contrary to my expectations, the owner, who had been confrontational earlier, now seemed contemplative.\n“…hmm.”\nTo my surprise, the owner did not erupt as I had anticipated. Instead, she seemed to be considering something. Finally, she spoke, “Then, can you help me with something?”\nThe unexpected turn of events worked in our favor. With the owner in a better mood, there was a possibility of obtaining the yet-to-be-finished dress lying in the boutique.\nHowever, our optimism was short-lived. The owner, while placing a sizable box on the floor, set a condition, “If you get this all sewn up, I will accept your apology.”\n“…”\nThe box contained a mountain of clothes, each with torn sections, making it clear that the task ahead was formidable.\nBefore further discussion, the owner left the room, leaving us to deal with the daunting pile.\n‘Did she just pass her the chores us…’\nRumors about the owner's eccentric personality seemed accurate.\nI and Shael resigned ourselves to the task, silently sitting down and beginning the tedious process of sewing.\nPredicting Shael's unfamiliarity with the task, I instructed, “For now, watch what I do and follow me.”\nEmploying various magical aids, I proceeded to mend the torn clothes at a deliberate pace, offering Shael an opportunity to learn.\nOnce the clothes were haphazardly stitched, I asked, “Can you do this by yourself?”\nShael, however, remained silent, her expression one of confusion.\nTurning my gaze, I discovered that Shael had already skillfully sewn several garments.\n“…?”\n“What?” Caught off guard, Shael questioned my expression.\nHer ability to sew was unexpected. Puzzled, I inquired, “When did you start learning?”\n“…I have been able to do it since I was little.”\nSurprised by this revelation, a sudden thought occurred to me.\n“Then why didn’t you sew the teddy bear I gave you?”\nShael's response was dismissive, “Wh..why would I? It was a doll I didn’t pay much attention to…”\nAmused by her nonchalant attitude, I considered the possibility that the teddy bear held more significance to her than she let on.\nWith newfound admiration for Shael's skills, I expressed my desire to hug her. Despite the hostess's potential disapproval, I indulged in the moment, embracing Shael while she continued her diligent sewing.\nAs the pile of clothes dwindled and the bottom of the box became visible, the owner returned, carrying a large box.\n“Finished?” She inquired, visibly surprised at the neatly sewn clothes.\nIt seemed that her plan to tease us about our assumed inability to sew was thwarted. Yet still unfazed, the owner walked over, hands behind her back.\n“…cough!”\nA deliberate cough interrupted the moment. Concerned, I approached, only to realize that the owner was faking it.\n“Are you okay?”\n“I’m fine.”\nDismissing Shael's suggestion to see a doctor, the owner eventually accepted her advice, acknowledging her intentional cough.\nIn return for our efforts, she agreed to sell the dress and promised to send it to the Azbel family once completed.\n* * *\nAt the Imperial Palace, a social gathering was underway—a prelude to the Imperial Festival where nobles gathered to strengthen friendships.\nAlthough these gatherings were generally inconsequential, my focus was on dispelling the rumors surrounding Shael.\nDespite efforts from Dukes Ezran and Jespen, the rumors persisted, fueled by the involvement of the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord. The gossip had extended to include false speculations about my relationship with Shael.\nIn an attempt to address the rumors, Shael and I attended the social church, a place where nobles congregated. While I didn't anticipate physical confrontations, the challenge lay in dispelling the unsettling gossip that had spread throughout the aristocratic circles.\nPlacing a likely fatigued Shael in her carriage, I found myself idling in front of it.\nSuddenly, a woman approached, addressing me with an unusual demeanor.\n“Oh, isn’t it Young Lord Eran?”\nThe encounter marked a turning point, signaling the beginning of a new challenge.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "I wore the most annoyed expression I could muster and leaned back against the carriage, opening my mouth.\n“What is your business?”\n“I came here to say hello. Young Lord.”\nIn fact, I'd never spoken to her before, so her current actions could only be termed as shameless. I was certain her intentions weren't noble, evident not just in her gaze but also in her peculiar behavior.\n“I am Perl of the Paerious family, the major ore supplier to the Baslett family.”\n“Is that so?”\nUninterested, I cut off the unnecessary self-introduction. I aimed to avoid any situation that might lead to Shael misunderstanding.\nDespite the potential hurt to the pride of a noble lady, Perl pressed on with the conversation.\n“By the way, where is Young Lady Shael? Is she in the carriage while making the Young Lord stand outside?”\nIn essence, she implied that Shael was being abusive towards me, her fiance. The woman’s comment hinted at an underlying intention to separate Shael and me.\nSuch words were typically left unsaid. I surmised that the rumor about me being unable to break our engagement due to Shael exploiting some weakness was the reason for Perl's audacity. The absurdity of such a rumor testifies to how wild gossip had become.\nI responded with truthful words.\n“Since we ki*sed quite a lot, she is tired and sleeping.”\n“…?”\nIt was an unexpected answer.\nFor a fiancée unable to dissolve the engagement due to his weakness being exposed by a vile villainess, it was an absurd response.\nNevertheless, Perl persisted, seemingly undeterred.\n“You can tell me the truth. Without that, there’s no way you’d be outside the carriage sighing alone…”\nI had stepped out to cool my flushed face from kissing Shael, and I hadn’t sighed. This woman was making her won convenient assumptions.\nI took a deep breath to compose myself. Even if her behavior was based on the rumors and ignorance, it was also true that she lacked manners.\nOf course, such people existed in the world. Raised in the gilded confines of a noble family, they lacked a sense of propriety. The discovery of a rich iron vein and the rise of the Paerious family likely played a role in Perl's audacity.\nAs I frowned, Perl, sensing something was amiss, said, “Oh, I forgot to go to meet my father. See you at the Social Gathering shortly, Young Lord.”\nNo, she hadn't realized something was wrong. Was there something I needed to attend to?\nI sighed and retreated into the carriage. First and foremost, I wanted to check on Shael inside.\nShael was still asleep. I desired to watch her a bit longer, but alas, I had to wake her up.\n“The Social Gathering is about to start. You should wake up now.”\nShael nodded in her sleep, naturally falling into my arms.\nSuddenly awake, she spoke, “This smell…”\n“What smell are you talking about?”\n“It smells like perfume.”\nIt seemed the smell of perfume had lingered even if we exchanged just a few words. Shael's keen sense of smell detected even the faintest details.\n“Someone came over to greet me. Naturally, I treated her coldly and avoided conversation as much as possible.”\nI made a clumsy excuse, which Shael would probably find hard to believe.\nContrary to my expectations, Shael nodded.\nHer response was quite unexpected indeed, considering that I had conversed with another woman without her knowledge.\nAt the same time, I felt gratitude, as it also meant that Shael had placed her complete trust in me.\nAnd I vowed never to betray that trust.\nFirm in my resolve, I entered the imperial palace with Shael.\n***\nThe grand imperial palace hosted the Social Gathering.\nEveryone, in a display of their nobility, donned vibrant clothes.\nShael and I entered inconspicuously, trying not to attract attention. Yet, attention was inevitable, given the recent rumors about Shael.\nThe only relief was the absence of the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord.\nHowever, that was all. The situation was dire, evident in the hushed conversations around us.\n‘Usually, they wouldn’t be able to do these things so openly.'\nAs many scrutinized us, the rest also got courage and sent us unabashed stares.\n“Let’s go to the corner and pass the time.”\nOf course, I didn’t plan to just confine ourselves to a corner. The purpose of attending the Social Gathering was to dispel the rumors surrounding Shael.\nThe plan was simple– demonstrate that Shael had become somewhat kinder. Show people the depth of our affection and validate our relationship.\nAfter clearing my thoughts, I looked to the side and saw Shael pouring wine into her glass.\n“Why do you want to drink when you are weak? It’s an important day, so you should keep your sober mind.”\n“I’m not weak.”\nIn the end, Shael, who ignored my nagging, followed me with her wine glass. She had poured more than expected, so I planned to snatch the wine glass after she drank about half of it.\nOddly enough, Shael didn’t drink the wine she poured.\n‘If you’re not even going to drink, why did you even take the wine? Does it feel cool to carry around a wine glass?’\nI didn’t know. Shael’s way of thinking was beyond my comprehension. Still, I was relieved that Shael didn’t plan to drink too much.\n“Please sit down.”\nAs we settled into a corner, several onlookers gathered, their gaze fixed on us.\nAmong them were the offsprings of the Duke of Anyden and the Count of Paerious, led by Perl Paerious, whom I had encountered earlier.\nAll members held high status, their families boasting outstanding wealth and influence. So I had to be careful.\nNotably, the Duke of Anyden's family had a had a bad relationship with the Azbel family.\nI concentrated my mana, enhancing my senses. Even so, it was not enough, so I resorted to a magic scroll to eavesdrop on their conversation.\n“Look, she is enjoying wine alone. Poor Young Lord Eran…”\n“What can he do? She is someone who even troubled the good Duke Jespen.”\n“I heard that she even harassed a commoner at the Banquet Hall of the Magic Tower.”\n“I had a conversation with Prince Eran earlier, and he seemed eager to break off the engagement.”\nI deactivated the sensory magic, not wanting to hear more. It made me want to approach them and stop the conversation. Yet, that might not be wise.\nI exhaled, gathering my composure.\nSensing my anger, Shael spoke, “Your face is red.”\n“It’s because it’s hot. I’ll go get some fresh air.”\nA nearby balcony provided an escape.\nAs I entered, the voices slandering Shael were muffled by curtains.\nHowever the unwanted voices persisted as someone also approached the balcony.\nIt was Perl Paerious, who was among those cursing Shael.\n“Oh, what a coincidence.”\n“…” I didn’t respond.\nI shot her an annoyed look, silently urging her to leave.\nYet choosing to remain oblivious to my displeasure, Perl grinned, “It was a pity that I couldn’t say goodbye just a while ago. I guess it’s fine now, Young Lord Eran.”\nConsciously aware of Shael beside me, Perl continued, “I hope next time we will have a chance to talk alone.”\nThe two of us had a conversation without her knowledge—a remark that blatantly scratched at Shael’s inner turmoil.\nIt seemed the Paerious family failed in properly educating their children.\nTurning my head, contemplating how to handle the ill-mannered Perl, I noticed Shael frowning. She teetered on the brink of losing her temper. Her left hand, the one that held the wine glass earlier, trembled. Now, she seemed poised to splash wine on Perl.\nQuickly, I reached out, intercepting her. I even confiscated the wine glass Shael held.\n“…!”\nShael panicked, as if unaware I would do this. She exchanged bewildered glances between the wine glass and me, seemingly unable to fathom that I had taken it away.\nPerl did not conceal her sneer. She even had a look on her face as if she had won.\nHowever, that triumph was short-lived.\n“Ah!”\nA bright red picture was drawn using empty space as a drawing paper.\nSoon, Perl’s white dress was stained red as the spilled wine drenched her.\n‘…no.’\nTo be precise, it splattered.\nSeeing Perl's expression, the opposite of moments ago, brought a refreshing feeling.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Truttt!\nA droplet of wine from the soaked dress fell to the floor, creating a distinct sound.\nOther than that, an eerie silence prevailed…\nNeither I, Shael, nor even Perl in the front could bring ourselves to speak.\nPerl stared in disbelief at my wine-splattered hands.\nWhen the dripping wine ceased, Perl muttered in bewilderment, \"Wha…what…?\"\nPerl glanced at me, as if expecting forgiveness through an apology. I coldly ignored her gaze and redirected my attention to Shael.\nShael had a firm grip on my arms, and, much like Perl's expression a moment ago, a smirk adorned her face.\n‘Everything seems fine now.'\nBut it wasn't fine a little while ago, as Perl had needlessly provoked a conflict.\nFrom the moment we entered, a group led by the Duke of Anyden had given Shael a few unfriendly stares, and she had also overheard things that would be normally difficult for her to tolerate. So my concern for Shael was only natural.\nTherefore, I asked Shael, \"Are you okay?\"\n\"Oh, it’s okay!\"\nHowever, the response didn't come from Shael; it belonged to Perl, who was now drenched in wine.\nI had clearly directed my words at Shael. So, even if Perl was dimwitted, there was no scope for a misunderstanding.\n‘As I thought, there was something off about this person…’\n\"Not you. I'm asking Shael.\"\n\"…\"\n\"It’s not okay.\"\nFinally Shael responded, but her answer made me involuntarily smile.\n‘Is it really not okay?'\nIn response to Shael's words, I shot her a questioning look.\nThen Shael remarked, \"If it were me, I could have spilled it more naturally, making it seem like a mistake.\"\n‘Am I being evaluated on my wine-spilling skills?'\nShael sounded like some kind of a wine-spilling expert.\nAnyways, I responded to Shael's comment with a vacant smile, then I turned to Perl and said, \"What are you doing? I need to spend some intimate time with Shael.\"\n\"…!\"\nLetting Perl go meant that there was a possibility that she could openly criticize Shael in front of the crowd. Nevertheless, I didn't care. From the outset, Perl had consistently belittled Shael.\nI intended to put an end to those rumors somehow.\n\"Ha!\"\nPerl, exhaling a deep sigh as if utterly dumbfounded, turned away.\nIn contrast, I exhaled happily.\nThis incident seemed to have helped me release the stress that had built up for the first time in a while. Even though there were still adversaries outside whom I couldn't handle, their reckoning would come sooner or later.\nWhile laughing for a brief moment, I heard Shael say, \"Wait!\"\nShael intercepted Perl as she was about to leave, then continued, \"My wine, bring another cup back.\"\n\"…\"\nPerl frowned at Shael's request and left her balcony.\nHmmm…I have to think of a few way to remedy the situation.\n\"We should go inside now.\" I suggested.\n\"Yes. I need to use the washroom for a moment. The wine splashed on me too.\"\nExiting the balcony with Shael, I, in a wine-drenched dress, observed Perl engaging in conversation with other nobles. And, their discussion's topic was evident.\nAvoiding their gazes, I headed to the washroom with Shael.\n\"I'll wait outside.\"\n\"Sure.\"\nShael entered the washroom. Frankly, I was worried, since Shael was in a space beyond my sight.\nDespite being a washroom in the imperial palace with stringent security and having equipped various protective artifacts, I couldn't shake off my concerns.\n‘I'm still anxious. What should I do?'\nI stared at the washroom, heightening my senses as much as possible. Although it was something quite rude, but I couldn’t help it.\nTuk! Tuk! Tuk!\nFootsteps echoed in the washroom, and I could pinpoint their exact location.\n‘In front of the entrance?'\nShe hadn't even entered the washroom properly, yet Shael stopped right at the entrance.\nThen, I saw Shael peeking her head out. And I turned away to avoid making eye contact with Shael.\n‘Is she spying on me?'\nLeaving me alone deliberately as she goes into the washroom?\nA dreadful notion crossed my mind—the ‘Ring of Mutual Restriction.'\nIn the boutique, I had been able to converse with the owner with Shael's consent. But what about the conversation with Perl?\nI consistently wore the ring, meaning Shael had permitted the conversation.\n‘Did she forget to set the Ring of Mutual Restriction since the boutique?'\nPossibly. But more than that—the assumption that Shael was ‘keeping an eye on me' seemed reasonable.\nEven now, Shael left me alone and went to the washroom. It reminded me of the incident in the carriage. Despite Shael being present, I engaged in a conversation with another woman without her knowledge; there's no way she didn't know about it.\nBeyond trusting me, Shael was exceptionally possessive and jealous.\nShael's peculiar behavior had me on edge. It appeared I needed to be more cautious than usual during social gatherings.\nAside from dispelling rumors about Shael, perhaps it was best to refrain from conversation altogether.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "My promise, unfortunately, didn't last long.\nThose aristocrats who had earlier demeaned Shael were now making their way toward me. They were the same cluster of people who had engaged Perl in conversation\nIt seemed that Perl had excused herself to change her dress, leaving her absent from the group.\nAmong them, the son of the Duke of Anyden introduced himself, saying, “I'm Denes from the Anyden Family. I've been wanting to talk to you for a while. Nice to meet you.”\n“I am Eran Baslett. Did you want something?”\nThey conversed with Perl, whom I'd ‘accidentally’ spilled wine on, leaving me uncertain about how to navigate the situation.\n“I heard that the Young Lord’s fiancé spilled wine on Perl. So it seems that you must be having a hard time too.”\nIt seemed the information had been relayed with a slight twist, suggesting it was Shael, not me, who had spilled the wine.\n‘Well, it must have been a bit difficult to say that it was me.’\nMy reputation for good behavior probably contributed to the confusion. Furthermore, blaming Shael would have been more convenient for them. They might have aimed to stir trouble for her by spreading such rumors.\nIt was quite a serious situation, especially given the high status of those before me.\nThough descendants of the Duke of Anyden, their family held a similar prestige to the Baslett and Azbel families. Unlike what I did with Perl, I couldn't simply walk away; I had to tread carefully not to make enemies.\n“Recently, the Empire has been introducing a system for divorce and breakups. What do you think, Young Lord Eran?”\nThis remark seemed directed at Shael and my engagement.\nConsidering the relationship between the Anyden family and the Azbel family, he likely brought it up thinking it would benefit me to end the marriage with Shael.\nFor now, I chose silence.\nThen, Denes Anyden continued, “By the way, where did Lady Shael go, leaving you alone by yourself?”\n“Don’t worry, she will be back soon.”\n“I see. By the way, my sister is also at a marriageable age…”\nHe brought up the topic of the marriage breakup and his younger sister who was currently at a marriageable age, revealing his thoughts quite explicitly.\n“I have a good relationship with Shael, so you don’t have to worry.”\n“Really? I honestly don’t understand.”\nYou don’t have to understand; what the hell is your problem?\n“Tort*uring commoners. Since childhood, she has been a nuisance to all kinds of people. She even threw wine on another noble.”\n“…”\n“Everyone in the Empire points the finger at your fiance.”\nDenes Anyden continued without giving me time to answer.\n“To be honest, Young Lord Eran, she is an inadequate woman. If you need to, know that you can ask the Duke of Anyden for help.”\n“…”\nWhat should I do? Even if I try to express my feelings toward Shael, it seems to be of no use.\nThe rumors about Shael weren't the only concern. The Anyden family, at odds with the Azbel family, would undoubtedly seek to sever the relationship between Shael and me.\nStaying still, for now, seemed the wisest course of action.\n‘…but.’\nI couldn’t just sit idly and listen to their conversation. It was excruciating to hear them disparage Shael, especially knowing she was nearby.\nDo I have to listen to them throw insults at Shael over and over again?\nIt was honestly quite heart-wrenching. Even for me, enduring such vitriol would be tough, let alone for Shael.\n“What difficulties do you have? Are they forcing the Baslett family using some dishonest means?”\nI attempted to voice out a retort with a slightly agitated tone, however…\nTuk!\nTuk!\nFootsteps echoed from the bathroom. Due to the sound of Shael’s approach, I had no choice but to stop the things I was about to say.\nShael arrived by my side, probably aiming to provide support in my distress.\n“What kind of nonsense are you spouting? Why should we separate when we have already created a bond…”\nShael's voice, sounded more like the villainess of the past. And naturally, what followed was a few of her trademark deceitful lies.\n“I already have a child with Eran!”\nIt was a lie I couldn’t do anything about, one that wouldn’t dispel the rumors surrounding Shael.\n‘So that’s how it should be…’\nYes, I wasn’t the only one, it was also Shael’s ordeal as well…\nI laughed, thanks to Shael, I was able to clear my clouded mind.\nHow can I dispel the rumors about Shael and get revenge on the nobles who slandered her?\nA brilliant plan started to form in my mind.\nAnd, from now on, it was my turn.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "At Shael’s words, the onlooker’s eyes widened in disbelief.\n“What are you saying…!”\nThose were Denes Anyden's words. Simultaneously, he looked at me, silently urging me to say something.\nSo, I responded with action.\nI hugged Shael beside me.\nA hug amidst many onlookers. Soon, Shael trembled, glancing at me but finding no words.\n‘Who initiated this?’\nIt was Shael. Her voicing it first would have led others to misconstrue it. So, I decided to vouch for Shael's sake.\nAt that moment, Denes wore a look of disbelief.\n“No, that’s absurd!”\n“We're soon to be wed, so what's the issue?”\nMy words were tinged with a touch of sincerity yet crafted falsely, and I also took the chance to embrace Shael more tenderly.\nDenes then appeared even more puzzled.\n‘Well, if it's the son of the Duke of Anyden, it’s justifiable that he’d have some inside information.’\nHe must have received information about Shael's and my interactions from a few months ago. It was the time when I would gaze passionately into Shael’s eyes while she blatantly ignored me.\n“Didn't you see the spilled wine on the other young lady? Why would you choose a woman with such a rude behavior?”\n“You were the one who provoked the argument. Besides, Shael is strong-willed but not ill-intentioned.”\nA woman with a bad temper wouldn't politely request dessert for herself or refrain from teasing for a kiss. Frankly, one might say I too had even more of a bad temperament, unlike Shael’s lovable nature.\nIt was an easily deducible truth. Unbeknownst to me, my fondness for Shael grew.\n“She's unexpectedly endearing. She gets outrageously jealous, and beneath her strong facade, she's bashful.”\nI said it while holding the hand of Shael, who was still breathing deeply with shame.\n“She's even pinching my arm in embarrassment.”\nI pointed at Shael, who was pinching her arm as she listened, narrating with sincerity in my tone.\nWhispers slowly ensued as my words spread.\n“You've got a point.”\n“Huh, showing that level of affectionate embrace in front of everyone?”\n“Seeing her current expression, it seems probable?”\nThe rumored courtship between the offspring of the dukes, believed to be akin to companions. It was enough to capture the attention of many.\nDenes frowned, ready to speak more about Shael’s bad reputation.\nBut before that, I took the lead.\n“I heard you were married a few years back already. I am sure that the bond between Shael and me will surpass yours.”\n“Ha! I have a good rapport with Helen!”\nThe agitated man fell silent. Then contemplating something, Denes spoke with a confident grin.\n“The Imperial Festival is just three days away. The festival will unfailingly distinguish the most devoted lovers in the empire…”\nTrue. The Imperial Festival identified the most devoted lovers.\n“So, let’s make a wager. Who will prove the stronger bond at the festival.”\nIt seemed a foolish bet. What was the point of such a wager?\nDenes looked quite certain of his victory. He was hell bent on denting the Azbel family’s standing in the aristocratic society.\n“Once the defeated Imperial Festival concludes, why not kneel and offer an apology?”\nAs expected, he proposed something that could implicate nobility’s honor.\n“If you add one more condition, I'll consider your bet.”\n“What could it be?”\n“The loser has to fulfill one of the winner’s wishes.”\n“Oh, splendid!”\nDenes agreed without hesitation. Given that many had overheard, there was no retracting the bet.\n‘I regret not discussing this with Shael beforehand.’\nRegardless, attending the Imperial Festival was inevitable. Given the reward, I had to participate unconditionally. Even if the situation differed from the novel, I was confident of a certain victory.\nThe bet had been established.\nHolding Shael’s hand, who still breathed deeply with embarrassment, I stated, “Then, let's depart.”\nIt seemed the rumors about Shael and me would peak tomorrow, with numerous nobles observing. Leaving was a prudent decision. However, events unfolded differently.\nAs I prepared to pass Denes, I witnessed a wine glass slipping from his hand.\nThe intended target was Shael. Deliberate, feigned carelessness. Yet, the contents never reached her.\nChack!\nInstead, the wine Denes had scattered splattered fiercely over his attire. It was Shael’s swift magic.\n“What…!”\n“You seem overheated. I didn’t realize you’d douse yourself in wine.”\nShael's words accompanied her gaze at Denes' stained clothes. A wicked smile underscored her statement.\n“You lack any resilience; I didn’t expect you to handle much.”\nFrom blatant derision, Denes flushed red, revealing his agitation.\n‘I didn't anticipate this way of dealing with the antagonist. Standing by her side, she's more dependable than anyone else.’\nMy thoughts focused on Shael, who barely concealed her mockery.\nFinally, the nobles who had been disparaging us were far enough away that they were out of sight. Only then did Shael voice her dissatisfaction with me.\n“Why did you agree to the bet for the Imperial Festival?”\nI had no plausible explanation. Kneeling, apologizing, and fulfilling wishes.\nIt wasn't a wager to be taken lightly.\nTaking such a bet without consulting Shael was certainly a mistake, and she had every right to be angry.\n“Sorry. I acted impulsively. I was convinced that we would win without a doubt.”\nTruthfully, I had no intention of honoring the bet even if I lost. Noble honor held no significance to me.\n“Even if you lose, can’t you just renege on the bet?”\n“Yes. we will win anyway, so it won’t matter.”\nLike me, she didn't concern herself with the honor of nobility. Fortunately, she accepted without much scolding.\n‘Of course, that’s not the only reason.’\nThe rewards of the Imperial Festival were more important than anything else. I wasn’t certain about others, but in the novel, the ‘love potion’ was awarded.\nUpon confirming their profound love, they were made to drink the love potion to deepen their connection.\n‘I made sure to drink it immediately to prevent its misuse.’\nYet, did I really need to consume the potion?\nThe person in the original novel who received this potion managed to steal it without drinking it.\nHowever, using it was a conundrum. A potion controlling minds shouldn’t be used recklessly.\nYet…\nThe scenario differed if the targets were those who had tormented Shael and me to death.\nFirstly, the Mage Tower Lord. Constant clashes with Shael and me were a testament to his antagonism. But that wasn’t all.\nI'd heard that the Mage Tower Lord had been at odds with the Azbel family since losing to Duke Jespen.\nConsidering a dire situation, what if the Mage Tower Lord surpassed Duke Jespen's might? That volatile madman might commit unspeakable acts for sure.\nThe next consideration was the Crown Prince. Though I hadn't interacted with him much, his recent blatant antagonism against me was noteworthy.\nAbout half of the Baslett family’s recent financial troubles were attributed to the Crown Prince.\n‘That's not the end of it.’\nRecalling a past life memory of breaking Clie’s bracelet and peering inside.\nI died from drinking poisoned tea.\nA potent poison undetectable even to someone of my elevated level took my life instantly.\nNo matter how I considered it, only the imperial family's lethal poison came to mind. The only person who could have killed me was the Crown Prince, fueled by jealousy for Clie.\nEven without delving into past events, the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord were formidable threats. If Clie spread gossip about me to them, they would likely seek my demise.\nSo, I needed something. And the ‘love potion’ was the tool to use.\nA love potion ineffective without mutual affection.\nIt should work on the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince because Clie didn't love them.\nConsidering this, I devised a brilliant plan.\nIt was a plan to plunge the despicable Mage Tower Master and the Crown Prince into the depths of despair.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "[Clie’s POV]\nThe medical room at the Imperial Palace.\nA woman was lying on a bed so luxurious that one could admire it just by looking at it.\nThe woman was Clie.\nBeside her, who was grunting, two ladies from the duke’s family were sitting and having a conversation.\nOne of the ladies was the daughter of the Duke of Prell and the other was the daughter of the Duke of Anyden.\n“Clie, how are you feeling? I heard that you kept losing consciousness after you had a fever.”\n“I think the heat is still the same. I think you should get some more sleep.”\n“Yes, I will get some rest.”\nContrary to her words, Clie didn’t close her eyes.\nRather, her eyes shined with a slight curiosity as she inquired, “I heard you went to the gathering. Did something happen?”\nAt Clie’s words, Severa Anyden opened her mouth.\n“Hah…I heard that Shael Azbel quarreled with my brother. She even spilled wine on people.”\n“Wine?”\nClie quickly turned her head. She had been unconscious for about two days due to a high fever, and her head was beset with constant headache.\nThe relationship between the Duke of Anyden and the Duke of Azbel was aind to fire and water. So she felt it was important to know the details from Severa Anyden.\n“Then, there seemed to be friction between Young Lord Eran and Shael Azbel. The two of them didn’t seem to get along.”\nIt was part of the rumors that was in circulation. This time, the daughter of the Duke of Prell, who was next to Severa Anyden, opened her mouth.\n“That bad-tempered woman doesn’t posses even a shred of elegance.”\n“This is interesting. By the way, I have something to ask you about the Imperial Festival.”\nClie quickly changed the subject.\n‘If the rumors didn’t work out, I needed to come up with a plan first before I lose consciousness again.’\n“I heard that the family of the Duke of Anyden will manage the rewards of the Imperial Festival. Can I see that first?”\n“Reward from the Imperial Festival? The Emperor will give it to us on the same day, so I don’t even know what the reward is.”\n“Ah, it’s because I am curious.”\nAfter that, Clie looked at the ring Severa Anyden was wearing and said.\n“Apart from the Lucius Ring, I received other rings from the Crown Prince…”\n“It is possible to show it. Yes.”\nClie smiled.\nThings went according to plan.\nA plan to steal the Love Potion.\nOf course, if she just asked the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince, she could get her hands on it right away. But there was no way she could tell them about the Love Potion. So, she had to make use of noble ladies who were friendly and easy to deal with.\nThe daughter of the Duke of Anyden was not the only safety device. The daughter of the Duke of Prell next to her would also participate in the festival with the same goal.\nSince she had previously won the festival with her show of affection, there was no way Eran Baslett would be able to win.\nClie smiled as she enjoyed the sunlight streaming into the medical room.\n* * *\n[Eran’s POV]\nI took Shael to the exit of the banquet hall. It was natural that many eyes would be focused on us. However, we didn’t have to react to their gazes.\nThe only thing I did was to give Shael a warm look so that they wouldn't create more ridiculous rumors.\nNow, the things to be done in the banquet hall was roughly over. So from now on, I had to prepare for the Imperial Festival that was to be held three days later.\n“I have to meet with Duke Jespen.”\nFirst of all, it was necessary to entrust Shael to Duke Jespen.\nI couldn’t buy some necessary things in front of Shael, and I couldn’t leave her just anywhere. Coming out of the banquet hall, I saw Duke Jespen nodding his head as if he was bored.\n“Duke, where did Lady Rayel go?”\n“I don’t know. My sister is always like that, so it doesn’t matter.”\nIt was rather fortunate. It was because I kept thinking about that potion, which she had given me of her own accord.\nA potion that seemed expensive at first glance.\nIn fact, I lost the potion she gave to help Shael and me, so my conscience pricked whenever I saw Rayel Tarden.\nDuke Jespen looked at me, who had gone silent for a moment, and opened his mouth.\n“Eran, is there something wrong?”\n“Nothing. I have a place to go to for a while, so could you protect Shael?”\nDuke Jespen nodded his head eagerly. It was probably his first time spending proper time with his daughter.\nSo it was bound to be an enticing proposition for him. Now, I just had to convince Shael.\nOf course, Shael wouldn’t just believe it if I said that I wanted to go somewhere alone.\n“Quickly come home.”\nBut contrary to my expectations, Shael coolly nodded her head. It was strange that she didn’t even ask any questions.\n‘Anyway, it’s to my advantage. I won’t be able to go there with Shael.’\nI must never go there with Shael.\nThe black market that the Crown Prince secretly created to make money.\nConveniently, it was a place not too far from the Imperial Palace.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "I hadn’t had the chance to go there until now because Shael didn’t want to let me be alone that often. So now that I had the chance, it became my first destination.\nWhen Shael and Duke Jespen were so far away that they couldn't be seen, I retrieved a camouflage magic tool from my magic pouch—a device designed to alter my appearance, and erase my presence as much as possible, so that no one would recognize me.\nUnless you were a super strong person, recognizing me, even if you saw my face, would be impossible.\nAfter that, I hastened my steps.\nThe entrance to the black market, cunningly disguised as an ordinary diner, finally came into view. I entered and greeted the proprietor at the counter.\n“What would you like to eat?”\n“I want to savor honey rabbit and enjoy some strawberry wine.”\n“Oh, you can head down there for that.”\nFortunately, it unfolded just as I had read. As the password was apt, the proprietor pointed towards the hallway beyond the counter.\nTo be extra careful, I even wore a mask.\nAs I traversed the hallway indicated by the proprietor, I beheld countless people.\nThere were more people than I had anticipated.\n‘Most of the people who use the black market are wealthy merchants or unscrupulous nobles.’\nGiven that it was right after the banquet hall opened, the black market was bound to be teeming with people. Perhaps the Crown Prince could also be blending in with this massive crowd.\nA gambling hall, a tavern, a black market where secret items could be bought and sold—these were the establishments the Crown Prince had established.\nRegrettably, I also had to engage in transactions in this place.\nI pondered my options and pressed forward.\n* * *\n[Shael’s POV]\nEran’s dependable figure blurred into the distance.\nSoon, Eran became so distant that Shael couldn’t discern him.\n“Finally….”\n“…?”\n“I can spend time with my adorable daughter…”\nIt was Duke Jespen. He wore a joyous smile that could bring tears to one’s eyes.\nUnfortunately, Shael didn’t reciprocate that smile.\n“Provide me with some camouflage artifacts.”\n“Camouflage artifact? Are you playing hide and seek?”\n“Even magic that obliterates traces.”\nThat’s what Shael uttered with a sigh.\nHowever, Duke Jespen couldn’t resist finding it endearing. He handed the camouflage artifact to Shael without inquiring why. He also bestowed upon Shael the magic that erased signs.\nPoof!\nShael’s hair color shifted, and her appearance changed so dramatically that even Duke Jespen couldn’t recognize her. Yet, in Duke Jespen's eyes, she remained cute.\nNext, Duke Jespen witnessed Shael's retreating back.\nShael, who had turned away coldly, hurried in the direction Eran had taken.\n“I’ll be back in a little while.”\n“Sha, Shael? Me, me too…”\nGiving no response, Shael left Duke Jespen behind and pursued Eran.\nWhile Duke Jespen chased after Shael, that was inconsequential to her. The crucial matter was the destination Eran was hastening towards.\nAs his lover, Shael had always been fixated on observing Eran. She kept her eyes on his gestures, postures, and even the most minute changes in his expression.\nThat’s why she noticed…\n‘As expected.’\nShe had suspected that something was fishy, and it turned out to be true. Eran was planning on doing something on his own as he utilized his camouflage tools.\n‘A restaurant?’\n‘Did he plan to find a decent restaurant on his own? Then why would he need a camouflage tool to enter a restaurant?’\nHowever, Shael was able to find out the reason soon after.\nEran exchanged some words at the counter, and entered a seemingly suspicious hallway.\nActually, it was an unremarkable hallway, but to Shael, it appeared extremely suspicious.\nIn the end, Shael followed Eran into the restaurant.\nThe proprietor addressed Shael, “What would you like to eat?”\n“Cupcakes.”\n“Yes? Our restaurant doesn’t offer desserts.”\nThen it was an ordinary restaurant.\nShael pointed to the hallway where Eran had just entered and said, “I want to go in there.”\n“Ah! That’s a place only employees can access.”\nChrang!\nShael didn’t respond to the proprietor’s words with words. Instead, the sound of gold coins scattering on the checkout counter was heard—signifying that it was by no means a small amount.\n“Uh, huh…?”\n“Not enough?”\n“Oh no! If this is enough… I’ll let you in. But you’d better wear this mask.”\nWearing the mask she was handed, Shael swiftly walked down the hallway where Eran had entered.\nA throng of people.\nFacilities that didn’t match their outward appearance. It was a facility that even the unsuspecting Shael would find suspicious.\nShael's eyes gleamed, and she commenced searching for Eran.\nHe had used a camouflage tool, but Shael had already seen Eran after he had used it. So there was no way that Shael wouldn’t be able to find him.\nAnd soon, Shael was able to locate Eran.\n“Haa?”\nShael’s sighed, flabbergasted at the sight of the place where Eran had entered.\nIt was a gamb*ling house.\nShael hurriedly moved her steps, as she intensified the magic that Duke Jespen had given her and changed her appearance of the mask.\nIt was time to catch her fiance on the verge of straying.\nAnd, she had to discipline her errant fiance.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "First of all, since it was a bla*ck market, there were a lot of things that seemed unsavory to me. However, it also had a lot of things that could help me fight against the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord.\nI took out a catalog with items that will be sold shortly after in the auction and looked at it.\nAs expected, there were many necessary items. A magic tool that erased mana and removed scent, and a medicine that promoted the absorption of medicine. There were a lot of things I had to buy, and many other things I wanted to give to Shael.\nIt was worthwhile to take the risk of separating from Shael. But it didn’t meant that it would be easy.\n‘It’s too expensive.’\nI had prepared as much money as I could. But I didn’t have enough money to buy everything I needed on the bla*ck market. It was mostly because I spent a lot of money on Shael.\nIf I had to think about it, the Baslett family’s finances were in jeopardy these days because of the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord.\nAnyway, the situation wasn’t looking that good. It was to the point where I wouldn’t even be able to buy the things that were of utmost necessity.\nRight at that moment, there was a place that caught my eye. It was a ga*mbling den right next to the bla*ck market.\n‘It would be nice if I could earn a little bit of money.’\nThe timing was also right. Shael had allowed me to take off the Ring of Mutual Restriction at the banquet hall saying that she didn’t want to spy on me, and then she foolishly forgot about it. So I now would be able to ga*mble against any opponent.\nAs soon as I finished my thoughts, I headed to the casi*no.\n‘I think I’ll just have to catch one money bag.’\nMost of the people in the bla*ck market were wealthy merchants or aristocrats.\nIf I could find just one stubborn person who didn’t like to lose among them, it would be possible for me to save enough money to buy everything I needed on the bla*ck market.\nAs I was carefully watching the people around me, I suddenly heard someone talking behind me.\n“Would you like to play with me?”\nIt was a woman that gave me a familiar feeling. But I didn’t give it a deeper thought.\nI could feel a bit of mana from her clothes, so it was clear that she was a noble lady from a noble family. Therefore, the probability that she had no knowledge of ga*mbling was very high.\n“Let’s do that.”\n“You better be prepared.”\nAfter that, things moved quickly, and we chose to play po*ker.\nHowever, midway through the game, the woman frowned at me.\n‘Is her hand bad?’\nIf that was the reason, her expression would be considered too revealing. Feeling suspicious about that, I bet fewer gold coins.\nObviously, I didn’t think it would lead to an assured victory.\n“You win.”\nBut oddly enough, the victory was mine. Even after that, the woman continued to reveal everything through the various kinds of expression on her face, and everything kept happening according to those expressions.\nIf the woman frowned, I bet a large amount of gold coins. On the other hand, I bet less gold coins if the corner of the woman’s mouth went up.\nAnd, before I knew it, I had won a small pile of gold coins. It seemed like I had caught a huge money bag.\n“I won again!”\n“Do you want to play more?”\n“We need to play more!”\n“Is that so? But I don’t want to play more.”\nI wish I could have earned some more, but I still got up from my seat, leaving the woman alone. Excessive greed wasn’t a good thing.\nI still didn’t have enough money, but it would be good to find someone else.\nAnd then I saw it.\nSomeone else was also approaching out table. The man had drunk so much that the smell of alc*hol wafted all around him.\n‘It’s another big fish.’\n‘I can’t ignore it…’ I thought, while looking at the woman and the drunkard.\n‘Maybe I can earn more money.’\n* * *\n[Shael’s POV]\nShael let out a sigh.\nShe wanted to warn Eran of the dangers of ga*mbling and punish him for going astray. And for that reason she approached Eran, who was looking for a ga*mbling partner. She had the confidence to overcome Eran perfectly.\nHowever, Shael lost miserably. She thought he wouldn’t be used to things like this, but Eran turned out to be a skilled player.\nActually, it wasn’t like that at all, but at least in Shael’s opinion, it was.\nAfter that, Shael planned to follow Eran while vowing to punish Eran properly. She had to keep an eye on what Eran was up to. But someone interrupted Shael.\nIt was a man with a well built-up physique.\n“What do we have here? It looks like you lost a lot of money little lady. Wouldn’t it be a loss to stop ga*mbling there?”\nShael silently expressed her refusal, but the man didn’t back down. He might have lost his mind from all the ga*mbling and alc*hol, and with his hand on his axe, the man was making a silent threat.\nConsidering that the place was the bla*ck market where everyone's identity was unknown, the man didn’t think anyone would be able to stop him.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Shael hadn’t been worried at all; a protective spell safeguarded her against any potential danger.\nDuke Jespen, concerned for his daughter’s safety, had fervently cast a protective spell on Shael in his pursuit, then disappeared to who know where.\nThe sheer amount of mana utilized in the spell could render even the Mage Tower Lord powerless.\n“Are you ignoring me? Lost all your money already?” The thug taunted, but Shael arrogantly brushed him off, focused on pursuing Eran.\nUnlike Shael, determined to chase after Eran, the persistent thug continued bothering her, even extending his hand toward her. Any closer, and the protective magic would activate, repelling him.\nYet, the situation demanding the protective magic never arose. Someone had intervened between the thug and Shael.\n“What are you doing?”\nShael’s view was obstructed by a dependable figure with a reassuring voice—Eran’s. He tightly gripped the thug’s arm, preventing him from reaching Shael.\nEven under the influence of her camouflage magic tool, Eran remained Shael’s protector.\n“It's none of your business!” The thug protested.\n“You should consider leaving.” Eran advised, exerting more force in his grip.\nDescended from renowned sword masters and recently reaching a higher level, Eran possessed ample strength to deal with mere street thugs. And he twisted the thug’s hand to near breaking point.\nRealizing his mistake, the thug shot a fierce glare at Eran before hastily fleeing.\nAfter dealing with the thug, Eran glanced at Shael, his gaze carrying something meaningful.\nHowever, Shael, concealed by an excellent camouflage magic tool, knew Eran wouldn’t recognize her. And that's precisely why she disliked his actions.\n‘Why is he saving someone other than me?’\nHer annoyance stemmed from the fact that her current identity was that of a stranger to Eran. A similar situation might happen anytime in the future, with some other random woman on the streets.\nShael detested the scenario where a woman other than her blushing for Eran above all else.\nMeeting Eran’s eyes once more, Shael, previously irritated, now felt uneasy. The cause was the avarice evident in Eran’s gaze, as if he desired something from her.\n‘Why?’\nWhat did Eran want from her? She couldn’t fathom if Eran had seen through her cover despite Duke Jespen’s exceptional magic and tools.\nWhile pondering, Shael couldn’t shake off the idea that perhaps he'd ask for her contact or to spend time together.\nUsually, she'd have happily agreed, but the current situation was different.\nTo Eran, the current Shael wasn't Shael but a woman using camouflage magic.\n“Hey.”\n“Yes?” Shael responded.\n“My wrist is hurting. I need to buy some medicine for treatment.”\nShael reflexively pulled out her wallet, ready to give Eran money for the medicine. But had Eran even been injured by that drunkard?\nBefore Shael could voice her protest, her money was already in Eran’s wallet.\nTrying to voice her complaint, Shael was beaten to it by Eran.\n“I almost faced a major problem.”\n“…?”\n“Is there a reward? Preferably a larger amount.”\nReward money? She didn’t want to give in, but she opened her wallet nonetheless, feeling like Eran's personal bank.\nWith a satisfied smile, Eran accepted Shael’s money. Counting it, he sighed, “This isn’t enough.”\n“What?”\nSurely she must’ve heard wrong. Shael questioned Eran, doubting her ears.\nEran's subsequent answer only perplexed Shael more.\n“If you triple it, I'll consider it a proper reward.”\n“What?”\nShael’s wallet opened again, unable to resist Eran's earnest gaze.\n“That’ll be enough.”\nAs if Eran had acquired all he needed, he turned away, leaving Shael to stare at his back.\nAt that moment, Shael felt relieved.\nShe'd worried about Eran treating other women better, but it seemed unfounded. Eran, despite his kindness to Shael, behaved like a trash towards other women.\nNot just any trash, but the lowest of the low trash one could find in the world.\nOddly, Shael relished it. Her mouth, once downturned in anxiety, now turned upward.\nHowever, she also made a silent promise to herself—never to entrust Eran with her finances.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Duke Jespen sighed heavily. He was wearing his camouflage magic tool, and it was the same with Eran in front of him.\nDuke Jespen moved his gaze to Eran, who had a pile of gold coins were placed in front of him. Most of them were gold coins belonging to Duke Jespen.\n“Look, is it not okay to play one more round?”\n“I can’t recommend you to do that, but I can give you one more game.”\nAnd the result…was devastating.\nEran, who relentlessly took the gold coins, turned around and left, his visage fading into the distance. He headed towards the black market, ignoring Duke Jespen, who continued to give him a pitiful look.\n“Haahh…”\nDuke Jespin looked at his empty wallet, and let out a sigh.\nThe beginning of this tragic event was quite simple.\nIt started when he was following behind Shael, and found Eran, who was ga*mbling against Shael. Intrigued by the spectacle, Duke Jespen wanted to compete against Eran in ga*mbling as well.\nTherefore, just to be safe, he poured an enormous amount of mana into Shael and created a protective magic circle. Then he cast a magic that would send a signal to Duke Jespen even if it sensed the slightest danger.\nDuke Jespen knew very well that Eran wasn’t someone who would come to such a place to do something strange. Thanks to that, he was able to ga*mble with Eran, who had stolen Shael’s money.\nAnd then, he was robbed of all his possessions…a whopping one month’s worth of his allowance!\nThe truth was, Duke Jespen had live on allowance he received from his wife, Enella. It was a sad situation for a duke of the wealthy Azbel family.\nAlas, he had nothing to say in the matter. If he was given authority over the Azbel family’s finances, the Azbel family’s mansion would be filled with Shael and Enella’s dresses.\n‘I wanted to buy a dress for Shael…’\nHowever, it was still too early to give up!\nDuke Jespen took out a communication magic tool. It was a communication magic tool that connected directly to Enella. Soon, he heard the voice of his lovely wife from the magic tool.\n[Jespen?]\nDuke Jespen felt nervous without realizing it. But he still mustered up the courage!\n‘I absolutely have to buy Shael’s dress today!’\n“I used up all my allowance…”\n[Crrreet!]\nThe connection of the communication magic tool cut off before he could even finish talking.\nHowever, Duke Jespen didn’t feel bitter. In fact, he felt scared with the thought having to tell Enella about the use of his allowance in the future.\nAnd so, with a heavy heart, Duke Jespen trudged out of the black market.\n* * *\n[Eran’s POV]\nI extorted quite a lot of money from that proud noblewoman. Still, I didn’t feel sorry. When that woman ga*mbled, she tried to cheat and refused to admits defeat.\nAnd now, she was even secretly following me.\nTo sum it up in a word, she was a woman who lost her senses.\nSo I felt no guilt.\nNext, I found another money bad.\nIt was a middle-aged man who seemed to be hidden by some kind of magic tool. The man seemed to be from an aristocratic family as well, judging from how proud and confident he was acting.\nAnyways, I managed to extract quite a lot of money, so much so that I couldn’t hide my excitement, probably because I hadn’t done such a thing before.\n“Look, is it not okay to play one more round?”\n“I can’t recommend you to do that, but I can give you one more game.”\nUnsurprisingly, the following game ended in my victory.\nThis man had a similar atmosphere to the woman earlier. To the point where I wondered if they belonged to the same family. Anyway, it was a good thing for me. Thanks to that, I was able to earn enough money to buy the things I needed on the black market auction.\nAnyways, the black market auction was about to begin. Since I was ready, I went to my seat and sat down.\nThen a woman sat down right next to me.\n“You again?”\n“Don’t talk to me.”\nIt was the money bag from before. She was the woman from whom I had robbed money in ga*mbling and extracted a lot of money as reward.\n“You even took my money. Don’t you think it was too much?”\nShe was right. However, I had Shael, and I didn’t want Shael to talk to other men, so I needed to refrain from talking to other women as well.\n“I didn’t take it, I received it as compensation.”\n“Ha.”\nI hoped the conversation would stop at this point. Unfortunately, contrary to my hopes, the woman continued to talk.\n“I see that you are quite an expert at ga*mbling.”\n“I am not an expert.”\n“I just saw you doing it.”\n“You must’ve been hallucinating.”\nEven after that, the woman continued to blabber on. So decided to just ignore her.\n[The honored visitors of the black market. The auction is going to start soon, so please take your seat.]\nAround the time the woman’s voice started hurting my ears, the black market auction began.\nThe auctioneer started introducing the items one by one. As expected from the black market, most of the items had sketchy backgrounds.\n[It is the Potion of Intoxication that greatly increases drunkenness. Not only that, but it contains ingredients that make it impossible to get rid of drunkenness even with magic!]\nIt would be quite helpful in my plan to to deal with the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord.\nI put my hand on the button.\n[Number 42, 280,000 gold.]\n[Number 72, 300,000 gold!]\nNumber 72 was me. It was a pretty painful expense, but it was worth it.\n[Uh! Number 71, 1.3 Million gold!]\nNumber 71 was the woman next to me. She was a money bag who threw her money away by ga*mbling.\nAnd the money bag was now trying to buy an item worth 300,000 gold at several times the price.\n“Do you want to fight me?”\n“No? Because that is something I need.”\n“I see.”\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can. You can also support me and sponsor chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

It would be nice if it was, but it wasn’t necessary.\nThe potion was auctioned off to the woman.\n[The next item is the Dew of Purification, which completely removes any scent and erases any traces of magic!]\nThis time my eyes burned with passion. This item was something I had to have no matter what. It was the most important thing in my plan.\n[Number 38… 800,000 gold!]\n[Ah, number 72 here makes an overwhelming difference with 2 million gold!]\nI called that bid to express my intention to buy the item no matter the price. However, the auction still did not stop.\n[Hhoo, 4 million gold! Number 71 has bid 4 million gold!]\nI involuntarily turned my head to the side. And the woman, who was number 71 gave me a nasty sneer.\nIt was a familiar sight, but I tried to ignore it and opened my mouth.\n“Can’t you yield this one time?”\n“Unfortunately, I can’t. I need it too.”\nI nodded my head and immersed myself in the auction. But I couldn’t buy the Dew of Purification.\nIn fact, I didn’t have 4 million gold to begin with, so even if I couldn’t get the Dew of Purification, there were other things I had to buy.\nI finished my thoughts and looked at the catalog. A potion that slows one’s ability to think, and rare fruit that weakens one’s ability to stay patient. There were still plenty of other things I had to buy.\n[The next item is…]\nIt was an auction for the special potion I needed to buy. But, once again, I couldn’t with the bid.\n[Once again, the item goes to number 71!]\nIt was because the woman next to me kept targeting the things I wanted to buy.\nI exercised patience and held back my anger.\nIn the end, all the things I wanted were taken away by the woman.\n* * *\n[Shael’s POV]\nShael looked at Eran with a triumphant smile.\nEran couldn’t win anything, and she had won all the items. He was poor, and she was wealthy. It was the so-called power of money.\n“Can you give me only the Dew of Purification?”\n“Hmm. I shall see what you can offer and think about it.”\nShael took Eran to the bar next to the black market auction.\nIf it had been any other woman, Eran probably would have ignored Shael, but she was able to lure him out with the item she bought at the auction house.\nAt the same time, Shael also had many doubts.\n‘Why do these things matter so much to him? To the extent that he would follow a woman he doesn’t know to a bar.’\nShe was curious about why and how Eran wanted to use such items. Furthermore, she even cooked up several scenarios where Eran would have to use those items in her mind.\n‘The dew that removes any scent and erases traces of magic.’\nWhat’s more, there was also that suspicious potion she found in Eran’s pocket while they were riding a horse together.\nAs Shael hadn’t had the chance to be separated from Eran, she couldn’t ask the Azbel family pharmacist about the potion yet, but Shael knew.\nSurely, that potion must have been prepared to be used on her.\n“What do I have to do?” Eran asked, his impatience clear in his voice.\n“I’ll give it to you if you get on your knees.”\nShael wanted to see Eran on her knees, looking with disgust at the woman he hated. Truthfully she did it in a moment of impulse. But when she saw Eran gritting his teeth, Shael felt sorry for him.\n‘Was it too much?’\nNo, it was an order that Eran would never have followed in the first place.\nHowever, just as Shael was about to cancel her order.\nThudd!\nEran got down on his knees!\nShael couldn’t help but be surprised,\n‘Those items are this important to him?’\nAfter the moment of surprise faded, it was replaced by a pleasant sense of conquest.\nAt the same time, she also felt quite annoyed. Because now, Eran was essentially on his knees in front of a woman other than her.\nAfter that, Shael had a thought that she would test Eran. Seeing him go this far, it seems that the items were really important to him.\n‘How should I test him…hmm.’\n“I got down on my knees. Will you give it to me now?”\n“You’re quite handsome, so give me a ki*ss.”\nOf course, it was an order Eran would definitely reject. Therefore, Shael thought it would be okay because she would be able to see Eran’s funny reaction.\n‘Will he draw his sword? Or, perhaps he would slap me on the cheek…’\nNo matter how he did, Shael would be satisfied with the result. Because those actions would be the proof of his love for her.\nHowever, the situation didn’t go as Shael wished.\nUnexpectedly, Eran was approaching Shael with a passionate look in his eyes!\nIt was a similar to how Eran usually did when he wanted to ki*ss her. He was really trying to ki*ss another woman!\nFacing such a reality, Shael poured all the curses she could think of at Eran.\n‘You…bad man! You perv*ert!\n’\nShael wanted to cancel the camouflage magic tool right away and catch Eran in the act, but she couldn’t do that.\nFirst of all, receiving a kiss from Eran was the priority. After that, would be the time for retribution!\nIn fact, Shael couldn’t even move because she was feeling so nervous, and used all her remaining energy to close her eyes, waiting for Eran to ki*ss her.\n“…”\n‘Does he feel guilty towards me?’\nPerhaps he was feeling hesitant, Eran was not as quick to ki*ss her like he usually did.\nJust like that, quite a bit of time passed, and nothing touched Shael’s lips except for empty air.\nSoon, Shael opened her eyes, which had been tightly closed.\nShe thought that she would still find Eran standing right in front of her, but the man was nowhere to be found.\nOnly the empty space welcomed Shael…and that wasn’t the only thing missing.\n“Ah…?”\nThe things she had won while teasing and harassing Eran at the black market auction, except for the Potion of Intoxication, the other items were all gone!\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "I earned a lot of money.\nNot only that, but I was also able to get the items I had thought I wouldn’t be able to get.\nAdmittedly, I owed all that to the woman who was practically a walking money bag. However, I didn’t really feel any kind of guilt. In the first place, it was the woman who first initiated the quarrel.\nEven so, as a gentleman, I felt a little bit sorry. Then I thought about it from another perspective.\nWhat if I didn’t get those items?\nPossibly it could lead to the failure of my plan, and thereby spell a string of troubles for both me, as well as Shael. So it was no big deal that I ripped someone off of some things and money.\nAfter I perfectly rationalized my actions, I released the camouflage magic tool. I even undid the magic that erased my presence so that Shael could find me.\nThen I felt a wave of mana from a certain direction, and it was accompanied by a magnificent and strong aura…both of which was quite familiar to me.\nThey belonged to the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince. At the moment hey were coming toward me, at full speed.\n‘There’s no need for them to do that…it’s not like I’ll run away.’\nI needed to meet them in order to carry out my plan anyway. Even if I had to fight them, I had the confidence to run away.\nBoom!\nThe Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince appeared in front of me in an unnecessarily grandiose manner.\nPerhaps they were in distress due to Clie’s illness, so they looked at me with tired but annoyed eyes.\n“What do you want?” I asked.\n“I heard you have a cure for the blood clotting disease.”\nIt was clear that they had heard it from Clie. But they didn’t bring up the matter of ‘earrings’.\nThat’s right. It would be troublesome for Cile if I found out that earrings were the only cure.\nIf it were me, I also wouldn’t have told the male protagonists about it either. They were quite unreliable, and they were only obsessed with their own agendas.\nThe Mage Tower Lord opened his mouth, “Last time, at the Blessing Meeting, you said that you had no cure for such ailments. Was that a lie?”\n‘Don’t you think what Clie told you could be lies instead?’\nOf course, I couldn’t expect such feats of intelligence from these two clowns. To them, Clie’s words were everything, and it was an essential order they had to follow.\nI could feel their eyes filled with madness.\nHowever, there were many ways out of the situation. Rather, it was a win-win situation for me. The perfect situation to throw them the first bait for a plan I have had in mind.\n“There is a cure that I found out after listening to the Mage Tower Lord and reading the family book recently.”\n“I see. Let’s go to the imperial palace first.”\nThe Prince drew his sword.\n‘Is that a threat?’\nI wasn’t afraid, but still, I had to admit that the guy was powerful.\nThe Crown Prince and the Magic Tower Master were achieving tremendous growth, befitting the male protagonists in the novel. If they were give a bit more time, they would have the ability to take the world under their feat.\nTherefore, it was necessary to make my plan a success and get them away from Clie.\n“It takes quite a long time to produce a cure for blood clotting disease.”\n“Stop the bullsh*t.”\n“It’s not bullsh*t. In fact, I was preparing the ingredients for the cure.”\nThey glared at me in disbelief. But I had the advantage in this situation.\n“If you don’t believe me, you can ask that woman named Clie. But, there won’t be enough time to make the cure.”\nIf it was now, Clie would probably be unconscious. It was probably the worst phase of the blood clotting disease.\n“How long will it take to make this cure?”\n“About four days for preparing the ingredients. And another four days for the manufacturing process.”\n‘That should be enough time for Clie to die…’\nHowever, there was no way that the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince would accept such a delay.\n“What? Then you should just give us the recipe…”\n“I will never divulge the secret of my family even if you kill me.”\n“Ha!”\nThe Crown Prince grabbed his sword, but it was only for a moment. For now, he couldn’t do anything to me as I had essentially taken Clie hostage.\n“Above all, my manufacturing will be the fastest. That’s what I can guarantee.”\n“Eight days is too long. Cut it down to five days.”\nNow that Clie’s life was under my control, they were treating me with a little courtesy.\n“It is possible if you help me find the ingredients.”\n“What is that ingredient?”\n“There are two difficult to get ingredients. I need the juice of the royal cactus from the Alcala Desert and the blood of the Vanil Bear from the Puel area.”\nBoth of these materials were extremely difficult to obtain. Because the places were either too hot or too cold.\nBut if it were these two clowns, they would go get the ingredients themselves. There was no way the male protagonists would yield their actions for Clie to others.\n“I will try to get it within today.”\n“No. You should bring the ingredients near the end of the Imperial Festival. They are ingredients that lose their efficacy over time.”\nOf course, I didn’t need them at all, but I had to mention them in order to make my claim more believable.\n‘Ah, what it this feeling of happiness?’\nI thought while trying hard not to smile.\nAnyways, the conversation ended with a bloody threat to destroy the Baslett family and the Azbel family if the cure was not produced in time.\nAnd so, my plan to punish them had taken a step forward.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "I met up with Shael and Duke Jespen again.\nDuke Jespen excused himself to give me and Shael time together.\nEven though not much time had passed since I had been separated from Shael, the corners of my mouth went up in delight as soon as I saw her.\nShael, on the other hand, showed an expression exactly the opposite of mine. She seemed to be rather annoyed.\n“Did something happen?”\n“Yes. Something very serious happened.”\nIt shouldn’t have been anything serious, since Duke Jespen must have been by Shael’s side during the time I wasn’t here.\nRather, she must be mad at me for going somewhere alone.\n“We’d better leave soon. Is there a place you want to go?”\nI received no answer. When I checked Shael’s gaze, I found her looking at the bag I was holding in my hand. The bag contained items from the black market. I couldn’t put them in the magic pouch because it was already filled to the brim with desserts.\n“What are those things?”\n“I happened to buy them along the way.”\n“With your money?”\nMy conscience was pricked, but I struggled to nod my head. That woman said she would give them to me if I got down on my knees, so it’s not like I stole them.\nActually, I felt a bit sorry, but I couldn’t help it. I didn’t know what would happen if I couldn’t buy the items and my plans went awry. So I just asked for forgiveness in my heart.\n“Haahhhm…”\nShael let out a sigh.\nDid she think I spent too much?\nHowever, I was not yet done with the spending. There were still things I had to buy. One of them was a protective magic tool that could be purchased in the imperial palace.\nIt cost a whopping 5 million gold!\nHonestly, I had almost given up on getting the item due to its price, but it wasn’t impossible now that I had saved so much money. Still, I wish I could gather a little more money.\nWith such thoughts, I pointed my gaze at Shael.\n‘Would she lend me some money?’\nAs I directed my earnest eyes at Shael, she seemed to have noticed my gaze, and pulled something out of her pocket.\n“Look at this.”\n“Is this…a photo?”\nIt was a picture of a woman.\n“Ah, this person…”\n“Looks like she’s someone you know?”\nThere was no way I didn’t know. The photo Shael pulled out contained the woman I had seen at the gambling house a while ago. She was the money bag who gave me an enormous amount of money and as well as the items.\n“I know her.”\n“What is your relationship?”\nShael suddenly took out a photo of that woman and was now asking about our relationship. It was necessary to find out the reason why she was asking such a question, since she had no friends and no social skills. So there was no chance that she was friends with the woman in the picture.\n‘Did they get into a fight while I wasn’t there?’\nAnyway, it was obvious that Shael and the woman in the picture were on bad terms. It was a fact that could be understood just by looking at Shael’s crumpled face.\n“No, first of all, you should tell me what kind of woman this woman is rather than your relationship.”\nShael asked with a cold voice.\nI realized that I had to give a well thought out answer. At the same time, this was also an opportunity!\nAn opportunity to score points for Shael by slandering the woman in the picture. In the first place, the woman was rude and ruthless, so I had no reason to feel guilty.\nAfter thinking for a while, I came up with a response Shael would like the most.\n“She is a money bag.”\n“Money…bag?”\n“She is a rude woman with a bad personality.”\n“…”\nShael stared at me with a livid face, and the corners of her mouth must be twitching because she was trying to hold herself back from smiling.\nConvinced of the fact, I continued to slander the woman to my heart’s content.\n“What about her personality?”\n“Just being around made me feel annoyed. It was to the point that it was fortunate I hadn’t drawn my sword.”\nActually, it wasn’t that bad, but I had to say that in order to make Shael feel better.\nShael’s face stiffened, and her lips began to twitch as if she was holding back her smile.\n‘Is this enough?’\nNo…it wasn’t!\nSo I decided to curse that poor money bag even more for the sake of lifting Shael’s mood.\n“She even looked at me with a shady gaze.”\n“Shady…” Shael muttered under her breath.\n“It was very creepy. It’s what social churches call gaze molestation. I suffered from that.”\n“Gaze molestation…”\n“My heart still trembles…I guess I’ll have to spend my money and calm my heart.”\nShael turned her head, trying to hide her expression. It was clear that she was trying hard to not lift the corners of her mouth.\nIn other words, Shael’s mood was at its peak because I had slandered the woman in the picture. Even if that wasn’t the case, she must feel some resentment towards that woman, and it was obvious that she had sympathy for me.\nAt this rate, wouldn’t I be able to borrow enough money from Shael so that would be able to buy that expensive protective magic tool?\n‘No, I’m sure it’s possible!’\nShael was the daughter of the wealthy Azbel family, and she had accumulated a lot of money due to the fact that she didn’t travel outside too much since she was young.\n“By the way. I have something I want to buy, so could you lend me some money?”\nAlas…I had made a mistake. It would have been better to just ask for the money than to borrow it.\nShael wouldn’t be spending that money anyway, and even if she did, it was obvious that she would spend it to buy strange things.\nWhat’s more, the Baslett family was also very poor, so I didn’t even know how I would be able to return the money I would be borrowing from her.\nAnd so, I tried to make eye contact with Shael with pitiful eyes and tried to entice her to just give it to me as a kind of allowance.\n“Shael?”\nContrary to my expectations, I felt a stare cold enough to freeze my heart.\nIn the end, all of the money I had taken from the money bag was confiscated by Shael.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "In the end, I had all my money confiscated by Shael.\nAs I sighed at my lighter purse, Shael pulled something out of her magic pouch.\n“What book is that?”\n“It’s a book I picked up from a place.”\nIt was a clean-looking book that she had apparently picked up from somewhere. Glancing at the cover of the book, the book was titled—[The Evils of Ga*mbling]\n‘Does she know that I went to the ga*mbling house?’\nHowever, I became confused. I used magic to erase the my presence and had disguised myself with a magic tool. Even when I looked around from time to time, I didn’t see Shael anywhere around me.\nThen a simple assumption came to mind. It might be possible that Shael was acquainted with the woman in the picture. And, that woman may have said something about me to Shael after she followed me until I undid my camouflage magic tool.\nIf that woman had the capacity to spend that much money, she would of course have good magic tools and magic to follow me secretly.\n“They say ga*mbling is not good.”\n‘Who doesn’t know that?’\nShael began reading the contents of the book as if she were giving me a lecture.\n“If you become addicted, you will keep thinking about ga*mbling, and it is said that the operation of mana is also hampered in that state.”\n“I see.”\n“It is said that ga*mbling has a great influence on family discord!”\nAs if emphasizing the dangers of ga*mbling, Shael speaks with strength at the end. It was an accent that she usually didn’t use.\n“So, if someone asked you to ga*mble, shouldn’t you decline right away?”\nShael lectured with a mournful voice and earnest eyes.\nAs I was speechless from the absurdity of the situation and couldn’t answer properly, Shael held my hand nervously.\nI couldn’t think of answering Shael. It was because of the thoughts floating in my head while I was looking at Shael.\nI thought it was cute.\nShael, who was restless at the thought that I had become a ga*mbling addict, was immensely ‘cute’. It was overwhelmingly cute!\nAnd, I wanted to bully this cute Shael. So I responded, determined to act like a scu*mbag for now.\n“Still, I think I will.”\n“Yes?”\n“I can get money, and I can also have fun. It kills two birds with one stone.”\nShael listened to me with her mouth wide open. Then tried to convince me after she came to her senses.\n“You will also lose money!”\n“Well, if I play with a stupid opponent, I won’t lose.”\n“Yeah, but…”\nShael closed her mouth. She seemed to have nothing to say. So now, it was time for me to go on the offensive!\n“Actually, I have a lot of money, so I can lose it. Wouldn’t it be enough to have fun?”\n“Fun…”\nI wanted to explain after playing around for a bit. But seeing Shael’s embarrassed expression for the first time in a long time made me happy. So I wanted the prank to go on longer!\nAfter chatting with me for several minutes, Shael shook her head as if she had surrendered, then pulled something out of her magic pouch.\n“By the way. I need you to explain the usage of this potion.”\nThe potion I thought was lost was actually in Shael’s hand. It was the potion that Rayel Tarden had given me in the Azbel household.\n‘Was it a potion that was useful for lovers?’\nActually, I didn’t get any explanation when I received it. And when I asked her about it one day, she only said that as an explanation.\nAnyway, it must be some kind of strange dr*ug. But I couldn’t say that to Shael. If I said that, it was clear that Shael would have me drink the potion.\n“I can’t remember. It seems to be some sort of medicine, so it would be better to just throw it away.”\nShael nodded, after that, she immediately opened her mouth, “So about ga*mbling…”\nOnce again the lecture begun, and I continued to appreciate the cute Shael.\n* * *\n[Shael’s POV]\nShael was heading to her room with a bottle of wine in her hand.\nOn the way, the figure of Duke Jespen caught her eye.\n“Father?”\nShael felt strange. It was because Duke Jespen, who would normally stick close to Enella and never be apart, was standing alone in front of the room he shared with Enella with a gloomy expression on his face.\nWhen Shael tried to call out to her father, she heard Enella’s voice from beyond the door.\n“Jespen, you are not allowed to come in until the number of days equal to the gold coins you ga*mbled has passed.”\n“That, the number of day equal to the gold coins…” Duke Jespen’s face turned pale.\nShael didn’t pay much attention to the event and tried to return to Eran. Then a thought that had been tormenting her all day, popped into Shael’s head.\nOf course, that though was about Eran.\n‘Who the hell did her good Eran learned to ga*mble from?’\nNow it seemed that the culprit was not far away. In fact, he was close to her all along!\nAfter seeing Shael, Duke Jespen opened his mouth, “Hmm, Shael. Would you like to have a cup of tea with your father?”\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can. You can also support me and sponsor chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "Since he was unable to spend time with his beloved wife, Duke Jespen decided to spend some time with his lovely daughter now that he had the chance.\nHowever…\n“Hmph!”\nShael didn’t respond to that request, as she proudly turned around, and calmly walked to the room where Eran was.\n“Sha…Shael?”\nShael could hear Duke Jespen’s desperate cry, but she couldn’t help it. Her father had to be punished for dragging Eran down a bad path.\nNo, even if that wasn’t the case, Shael wanted to spend her time with Eran. In fact, this was a more important moment than any other time.\nPlop!\nShael opened the wine bottle that she was holding in her hand. It was a wine that was particularly known for its strength.\nAnd then, she added the Potion of Intoxication in the bottle.\nThe potion was something Shael had bought on the black market auction before. It was something that prevented drunkenness from being shaken off with magical power, and made it impossible for even a superhuman to overcome the drunkenness.\nIt was perfect!\nShael held the wine that was supposed to make Eran drunk in her left hand, and she held a small potion in her right hand. It was the potion she found while riding with Eran in his clothes.\n[I can’t remember. It seems to be some sort of medicine…]\nEran made such an excuse. However, he must have known the use of the potion.\nIt would be convenient if she requested the help of the pharmacist in the Azbel family. However, Shael planned to make Eran speak directly about the use of the potion by getting him drunk.\nShe wanted to scold Eran, who seems to be addicted to gamb1ing these days.\nAnd, she would also fulfill her personal interest.\nA very perfect plan!\nShael smiled with satisfaction and headed towards Eran.\n* * *\nThe situation went according to Shael’s plan.\nShael passed the wine to Eran, and Eran drank it.\nActually, Eran must have noticed something strange in the wine glass. But he had great faith in Shael, so he drank the wine without question.\n“Go ahead, drink.”\nEven though his throat was quite sore, Eran, drunk, unable to refuse Shael’s order and emptied his wine glass.\n“Mmm…” Eran groaned.\nUnlike usual, Shael saw Eran’s face flushed red. It meant that her covert operation had succeeded.\nShael spoke to Eran, expecting to see a new side of him, “Are you okay?”\nEran’s eyes stayed on Shael. After staring at her face for a moment, he finally opened his mouth.\n“Money bag?”\n“…?”\nShael doubted her own ears. What did Eran say to her now?\nMoney bag?\n‘This is nonsense. I must have heard wrong…’\nShael listened to Eran’s words, hoping to hear something else.\n“You are the money bag who gave me money at the gamb1ing house.”\nShael tried her best to deny it, but in the end, she had to accept it. Eran had mistook her for the woman she had become using the camouflage magic tool. That’s why Eran was now calling her a money bag.\nShael compromised with reality. She then resolved to ask Eran something she had always wanted to know.\n“What is your thoughts about the woman named Shael?”\nOf course, the woman in question was Shael herself. But she wanted to put on a graceful performance, just like when she used her camouflage magic tool, and asked Eran about his evaluation of herself.\n“Shael is cute. Of course appearance isn’t everything, her personality also matters…”\nShael blushed at her lover’s burdensome words. Even though she didn’t ask for more, Eran continued to speak.\n“She is so lovely that I feel like I’m addicted to her. And…”\nA few minutes passed like that…and praise continued to flow out from Eran’s mouth.\nShael was on the verge of dying of shame.\n‘This person…why is he saying such embarrassing things?’\nEran, who usually refrained from saying such things, saying something this cheesy.\nThe intensity of shame Shael was feeling made her want to die. However, the corner of Shael’s mouth still pointed upwards. It was obviously embarrassing, but Shael still felt good without knowing why.\n“Oh, come to think of it.”\nFinally Eran stopped praising Shael, and she felt a little sad about that, but it wasn’t too much. She wanted to hear what he wanted to say next.\nShael waited and waited for Eran to finish his words.\n“I really wanted to meet you again…”\nShael startled and shuddered at the words.\n‘Did he want to meet another woman?’\nThere was no word more irritating to Shael than that. She waited for Eran’s words, puffing up her cheeks to hold back her anger.\n“Because my Shael took all my money. So, I need to get some money again.”\nHonestly, there couldn’t be a more trashy remark than this. It wouldn’t be strange if Shael just reach out her hand to slap the guy. But Shael wasn’t in a bad mood, rather, she was smiling shyly.\nEran had used the word ‘my’ while taking about her. It was as if he was bragging about his feelings for Shael to another woman.\nWhat’s more, Eran just wanted to extort more money from the supposed woman.\nThis new side of Eran was thrilling and new.\nAnd, Shael set her eyes on Eran as she vowed to dig through all of his intentions and secrets.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Shael observed Eran’s outstretched hand, as Eran, mistakenly identifying Shael as the money bag, sought to borrow some money.\nChoosing to disregard the confusion, Shael retrieved a bottle of potion, the very one she had found in Eran’s possession in the past.\n“Do you know what this potion is for?”\nEran nodded his head. Proving that contrary to what he had previously said, he knew what the potion was for.\n“What is it for?”\n“Why would I tell you that?” Eran retorted.\nShael didn’t answer Eran’s words. She took out her heavy wallet and handed a gold coin to Eran.\nThen Eran opened his mouth without any refusal.\n“I heard it’s a potion that helps love. I don’t know the details either.”\nA potion that helps love. It was obvious who the potion was for.\nIt was for Shael.\nBut Shael didn’t feel happy.\nIt would be fine even if Eran didn’t use these things.\nShael felt a bit disappointed, and she put the potion in her pocket. She would use it as a reminder that she would have to punish Eran once he was sober.\n‘Looks like the matter of the potion is solved for now.’\nShael thought as she looked at Eran, and frowned.\nDid Eran divulge secrets to another woman that even she was unaware of?\nThis warranted punishment!\n‘How should I punish him?’\nReflecting on past experiences with Eran, particularly when he had subjected her to a barrage of head-flicks, Shael approached him, contemplating the suitable punishment.\nBefore Shael’s could reach her, Eran grabbed Shael’s wrist.\n“You can’t, because Shael hates this.”\nEran was reluctant to come into contact with other women.\nHis words eased Shael’s mood, and forgetting her anger as if she had become a fool, she decided to ask\nEran about another subject.\n“You’ve been worrying a lot lately. What is it about?”\nThe question was followed by another gold coin. And before long, Eran opened his mouth.\n“It was because of that damn Mage Tower Lord and Crown Prince.”\nIt was an answer that Shael had no choice but to pay close attention.\nEran had a conversation with the Mage Tower Lord without Shael’s knowledge. However, Shael didn’t know the details of the conversation between Eran and the Mage Tower Lord. And today, she would be able to unravel the mystery.\nSo as not to forget Eran’s words, Shael focused her everything on Eran with bated breath.\nEran’s expression turned sad. He had a sullen expression on his face, as if he were remembering a sad past.\nEran, who only showed his dependable side, was now showing such a weak side.\nShael’s heart shook. It was to the point where she wanted to protect Eran.\nEran had such a sad expression on his face. It was clear that the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince had somehow harmed Eran.\nShael couldn’t bear to ask a question that would remind him of such a past, so she asked Eran.\n“Hmm, it looks like you’ve been preparing something lately. What is it for?”\n“It’s for a cure. The cure requested by theMage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.”\nIt was a matter she had never heard from Eran’s mouth before. Therore, Shael questioned about the cure Eran mentioned just now.\nUsually drunken people mixed lies with their words. There was no way that only the truth would come out of Eran’s mouth when he was very drunk.\nHowever, Shael believed Eran’s words and repeated them in her head.\n* * *\nA cool breeze rushed in and touched my face.\nThrough that, I shook off my tiredness and barely opened my eyes.\n‘I think I drank wine with Shael.’\nI didn’t remember anything after that. All I vaguely remember was saying something to Shael with a sad expression.\n‘What did I say?’\nMy head felt as empty as a white drawing paper. Even if I drank wine, it shouldn’t have affected me this much, so it seemed that Shael had fed me something strange again.\nI didn’t think there was anything really strange in it. Even when I sipped the wine and felt weird, I just gulped it down in one go.\n“Mmm…”\nIn that case, it would be right for me to ask herself, but I didn’t want to wake Shael for now. I got out of bed and opened the door. Then I saw the maids of the Azbel family busily themselves and moving around.\nFeeling strange, when I followed them, I saw Duke Jespen.\n“Duke, what is going on?”\n“You’re finally awake, Eran.”\nOddly enough, there was a bit of sympathy in Duke Jespen’s gaze as he looked at me.\n“Don’t worry. I cut off communication with the Mage Tower in order to make things even harder for the Mage Tower Lord.”\nThat was an answer I didn’t understand at all.\n“It would make things hard for the Mage Tower to not get any magic tools from the Azbel family which they must use at the Imperial Festival, so they must be busy working.”\nI tried to nod my head at the dignified tone of the Duke of Jespen. Previously, the Mage Tower Lord had minimized the exchanges with the Azbel family in order to relieve Clie’s irritation.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "And now, considering the minimal exchange that was abruptly cut off, the damage to the Mage Tower must be substantial.\nCertainly, the same holds true for the Azbel family. I couldn’t fathom why Duke Jespen terminated the exchange even at his own expense.\nWhen I directed a questioning gaze at Duke Jespen, seeking further clarification, he responded.\n“I heard that the prince is very interested in mana stones. So I collected all the mana stones exported to the imperial family.”\n“Can I ask why you suddenly did that?”\n“You’d better ask Shael about the details. Oh, check the letter in the office, too.”\nAbandoning the deal between the Mage Tower and the Imperial Family was advantageous for me, given my intense dislike for the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince. Yet, Duke Jespen’s actions puzzled me.\nFollowing Duke Jespen’s suggestion, I went to the office.\nA substantial amount of gold coins and two letters lay there.\n‘The senders… the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince?’\nNervously, I opened the letter. As I hastily read the contents, I found, once again, only incomprehensible text.\n‘A payment for the cure for blood clotting disease? When did I asked for that?’\nHowever, it was clearly written in the letter that I had requested a fee.\nAlthough I needed the money, my conscience stung. Contrary to the letter’s claim, I had no intention of creating a cure.\n‘Still, if the other person is the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince, the story will be different.’\nIt was rather convenient.\nI even felt a sense of relief even thought those two clowns must have been angry with me. Those two believed that I could manufacture a cure, so they probably wouldn’t bother me. Still, I needed to find out how things were unfolding.\nNaturally, the cause must have been Shael.\nStraight back to the room where Shael was sleeping, I observed her peaceful slumber.\nI didn’t wake her up, and with my back to the sleeping Shael, I gazed out the window and contemplated my future.\nThe Imperial Festival was two days away. Since I was inebriated and slept for an extended period, I had roughly one and a half day remaining.\nI felt a bit nervous.\nMy revenge against the female and male main characters in the novel would commence at the Imperial Festival.\nThe anticipated tension, expected to linger for hours, dissipated quickly due to the warmth I felt behind me.\nShael was embracing me from behind. Although she usually did so, today Shael’s hug felt refreshing.\n“Are you awake?”\n“Don’t worry.”\n‘Don’t worry?’\nIt certainly wasn’t the response I was expecting for my question.\n“Because I will punish the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince somehow.”\nI was convinced by Shael’s words. It was evident that I had made a mistake while I was drunk.\n‘I must have expressed my feelings of unfairness toward the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord.’\nEven now, I didn’t like the Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord. If things went awry, they would be completely obsessed with Clie, and they might come to harm me.\nOf course, that was unacceptable.\nThe focus of my concern was Shael. I was so enraged that my body shuddered just thinking about what Clie had done to the Azbel Mansion in the alternate timeline. So, if I were drunk, it wouldn’t be strange if I cursed at the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.\n“I think I spouted strange lies while I was drunk.”\nI felt relieved thanks to Shael, who promised to punish them. However, I couldn’t leave it like that.\nUntil the plan was over, we shouldn’t offend the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince as much as possible.\nDuke Jespen’s severing of communication with the Mage Tower and the imperial family was also related to this, so the Azbel family would suffer a loss.\n“Don’t lie.” Shael hugged me tighter.\nI gave up talking about it. Even if I said it, Shael wouldn’t change her mind. Because Shael, who was usually ignorant, was quick to notice at times like this.\nStill, it wasn’t too bad. It was as if the stress I had endured so far was blown away by Shael’s embrace.\n“You seem to be having a hard time even in your dreams.”\nI laughed when I thought of Shael, who must have been worried while watching me sleep. But this time, Shael’s worries were misplaced.\n“Don’t worry. In my dream, I robbed the money bag again.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Every time when I said something, she put a gold coin in my hand.”\nAs if she didn’t like that I had a dream involving another woman, Shael who was holding me and pinched my arm.\n“You seem to be meeting her too much. That money bag might fall in love with you.”\nThat won’t happen. Because I took so much money from her.\nI laughed at Shael’s cute jealousy.\nFor a while, we conversed, and Shael healed my heart.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "The day the Imperial Festival began, I yearned to immerse myself in the festive ambiance. In the carriage, I found myself alone with Shael, heading towards the festival’s starting point.\n“What is it?” Shael asked while shooting me a questioning look.\n“Nothing.”\nI hesitated, my mind occupied with the plan that I had been brewing for a while. The Imperial Festival marked the initial stage of my strategy, making me nervous yet determined.\n‘The Mage Tower Lord and Crown Prince won’t be there, right?’\nI reassured myself, believing they had left in search of ingredients for the cure, and would be absent during the festival. If I could enjoy the festivities with Shael and achieve our common goal, everything would fall into place.\n“What about our father?”\n“Did you say father?”\n‘Is she talking about Duke Ezran?’\nShael didn’t seem embarrassed by my question at all. Her nonchalant demeanor was quite impressive.\n“Looks like he’ll be back soon. I think we can see him after the Imperial Festival is over.”\nI was looking forward to that moment as well. If the memory I glimpsed after breaking Clie’s bracelet held true, Duke Ezran had paid a great price for our sake.\nSimultaneously, a pang of sorrow struck me. If only saving lives came at a lesser cost– what could he have possibly offered to the Demon King?\n‘You can tell just by looking at how gloomy the Baslett family’s mansion is, which is different from what had seen in my memory.’\nThe mother of Eran Baslett was present in my memories but she was now absent. The thought overwhelmed me, and I pushed aside those emotions to concentrate on Shael.\n“Are you okay?”\n“…?”\n“Just thinking about my father.”\nEvery encounter with my father had been fraught with awkwardness, almost suffocating. Having lived with my aunt before being transported to this world, connecting with a parent was a challenge.\nA challenge to be overcome in the future. The sudden thought triggered memories of events before possession.\n‘I wonder if my aunt is doing well.’\nLonging gripped my heart, injecting a sense of complexity and sadness. Again, I sought solace by diverting my attention to Shael.\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the wagon’s vibrations ceased.\nWe had finally reached our destination.\n* * *\nGiven the Imperial Festival’s significance, the area around the imperial palace buzzed with activity.\nWealthy merchants secured seats for business, and families set up stalls to showcase their unique products.\nThe Baslett and Azbel families were no exception.\nShael and I found ourselves amidst the Baslett family’s servants, preparing for the festival.\n“You were famous for your swordsmanship.”\n“Yes, that is correct.”\n“But why are you selling food and not swords?”\n“I know a certain noble lady from a famous mage family who prefers dessert over magic.”\nShael fell silent.\nLeading her inside, I directed the maids, then gathered ingredients to craft cotton candy for Shael.\n“Would you like to try it?”\n“I don’t think it will taste as fluffy…”\nDespite her protest, the sweet scent proved irresistible to Shael. The inevitable outcome unfolded as she succumbed to the sugary delight.\n“Oh, it’s delicious.”\n“It will be so delicious that it will go viral.”\nShael agreed, but confusion lingered. Selling cotton candy for a day couldn’t cover the cost of renting such a colossal building.\n“Food isn’t everything. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have rented a building this large.”\n“What else do you have?”\n“See for yourself.”\nAdjacent to the simple food stall, stood a space resembling a gamb1ing hall.\nShael raised an eyebrow, understandable given the financial struggles of the recently impoverished Baslett family.\n“There’s a betting arena. The Baslett family is wagering a significant amount.”\nMidway through her third cotton candy, Shael grasped my hand.\nUnfazed, I laughed heartily as we exited the building.\n“Now, let’s go and get ready.”\nNavigating through the bustling crowds proved challenging, but thanks to our building being in the center, we didn’t have to travel far.\nFamiliar faces from the Holy Church greeted me, including Denes of the Duke of Anyden, enjoying the festival with his apparent spouse.\nPerhaps spotting me, he approached without hesitation.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "“Isn’t this Young master Eran?”\n“Nice to meet you. I hope you didn’t forget about our bet.”\n“Hahahaha, of course. But the winner is already decided, so you better be prepared.”\nDenes Anyden left after talking with a confident expression.\nIgnoring his smug face, I looked around, and realized just how grand the venue was. It’s size could only be describes as gigantic. And, it was also the place that would hold the event which would determine the Empire’s purest lovers.\n‘We must win!’\nNo, I was sure that we would win. Even just looking at the original plot of the novel, I could be sure of that because the event was treated as quite important. There would be a stone statue that determined whether you are truly passionate in love, as well as a sword that determined how pure your love was.\nNot only that. Items that could measure the amount love would be taken out from the storage of the Imperial Palace, and will be used at the Imperial Festival.\nThere were so many treasures that I couldn’t even remember properly, so I wasn’t sure what else would be used in the festival. The only certain thing was that they would use some of the most incredible items to make sure that there would be no doubts about the results.\nThat was the unique setting of the romance fantasy world I was now living in. A setting that prioritized fun rather than logic.\nHowever, I liked the setting exactly because it was fun.\nAnyways, Shael and I had the conviction that we would win the Imperial Festival in our hearts.\nAs I thought about the Imperial Festival, I felt Shael resting on my arm. Did she feel uneasy about the bet with Denes?\nI wanted to ease her worries, and said, “Don’t worry, we will definitely win.”\n“I think so too.”\nShael sighed for a moment before continuing her words, “It didn’t seem like they were worried at all…”\n“Isn’t it because they are foolishly sure that they will win?” As I responded to Shael’s words, I thought of Denes, who had a confident expression on his face.\n‘It must be because of unfounded confidence?’\nIt must be so. Of course it was!\n“The Anyden family will manage the rewards.”\nShael must have said it out of concern, but her words didn’t end there.\n“I heard that they also helped with the preparations for the Imperial Festival…”\n“Is that true?”\nI caught my breath at Shael’s terrifying words.\nWhat if what Shael said was true?\nThen I couldn’t rule out the possibility that Denes knew the details of the Imperial Festival.\n“If the Anyden family helped with organizing the festival, shouldn’t they be barred from participating in the festival?”\n“It doesn’t matter. Well, the reward for winning is not that important anyways.”\nShael’s response almost made me choke on my breath. The reward this time would be a rare Love Potion you know! It was very important!\nWell, it was normal for her to think that, considering the rewards from all the previous Imperial Festivals didn’t have any particular value in the eyes of the nobility.\nMoreover, the festival was organized purely for the purpose of amusement, so it was not an event that emphasized fairness. It meant that Denes could participate in the festival despite being a part of the organizers.\n‘Now this is quite troublesome…’\nIf I lost the bet, I would have to kneel down and grant the winner’s wish.\nOf course, I, who had no sense of honor, would never put it into action…but it was also true that it would harm my reputation.\nNot only that, but the Baslett family would lose money they were betting on.\nMost importantly, I would lose the Love Potion!\n‘Even if it’s a test to prove pure love, the story will be different if you know the contents in advance.’\nIt was only natural that you could get good results through preparation.\nOn the other hand, I also couldn’t remember the specifics of the Imperial Festival from the novel. It was because I only paid attention to the parts where Shael appeared in the story.\nEven if I remembered all the details of the event, the contents of the Imperial Festival would have been changed due to my intervention.\nIn other words, there was no solution to this problem.\nI remembered Denes’ confident face from before, and felt quite nervous. So there was a reason why he seemed so confident!\nAnd now, all I could do was hope that Shael and my love would be overwhelmingly huge.\n“Do you think your hands and feet are shaking at the thought of the money you gamb1ed on who will be the best lovers in the Empire?”\n“It’s not like that.”\n“No. I read in a book that a trembling body is a side effect of gamb1ing add1ction.”\nAs if Shael was threatening me, she continued, “And, in order to punish such a gamb1ing add1ct, should I intentionally lose the festival?”\n“Is that so? Then, since I am concerned about someone getting diabetes, I will also stop preparing desserts.”\n“That’s not fair!”\nListening to Shael’s chattering voice, I felt a little relieved, and pinched Shael’s puffed cheeks. It helped me calm down my nerves, as I waited for the Imperial Festival to begin in earnest.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "At last, the event to determine the best lovers in the Empire began.\nThe setting was a slightly elevated area in a wide plaza.\nThe host, standing there, spoke into an amplifying magic tool.\n[An event to determine the best lovers in the empire is about to begin! Those who have made reservations for the event in advance, please come here!]\nI moved as the host pointed. Around me and Shael, were several other couples, who wanted to participate in the event.\n‘Still, it’s not as many as I thought.’\nWell, there wouldn’t be much to gain from winning. Having to display affection in front of so many people was also a problem. That being said, it was by no means a small number, so I felt nervous.\nThe host seemed to anticipate this, as there was a mechanism in place to eliminate participants from the start.\n[You have to pass by the stone statue in front of you and make it light up in order to participate in the event!]\nAs far as I remembered from the novel, this stone statue played a role in determining whether love was still alive. If your heart was slightly attached to others or if it was cold, the stone statue wouldn’t emit light. Perfect for lovers like Shael and me who had just confirmed our feelings.\n“Shall we go?” I asked.\n“Yes.” Shael nodded.\nOf course, Shael and I passed through. Keeping your love alive was challenging, and quite a few people were eliminated from the start. Indeed, this was quite a difficult test.\n‘With this, I can find out who among the people I know made it through.’\nI quickly turned my head to look at the participants. I spotted those who won in the original novel and Denes Anyden, who made a bet me. They too easily passed the first test.\n“My father is here…” Shael suddenly spoke up.\nAs she said, Duke Jespen had already passed his first test with Duchess Enella. Although they probably didn’t participate in the original novel, it seemed like they joined after seeing Shael and me.\nDuke Jespen, who also noticed us, approached and said, “You participated as expected.”\n“I heard that the Azbel family is preparing a magic show. You don’t have to oversee it?”\n“It’s okay. Of course, the most important thing is to let the Empire know of my love for Enella.”\nAs Duke Jespen spoke, he was caught and dragged away by Duchess Enella.\n‘Looks like there are a lot of formidable competitors.’\nDenes Anyden, who likely knew the festival’s contents in advance, and the passionately in love Azbel couple.\nShael, sensing my thoughts, opened her mouth, which had been closed until now.\n“With mother and father as participants…we might lose.”\n“No, are they really that good?”\nShael, who was confident just a moment ago, changed in an instant.\n‘Is the Ducal couple really that deeply in love?’\nEven so, they were a middle-aged couple. The hotter the love, the faster it cools down. So, I was relieved and focused on the host.\nFinally, the second test began.\n[This is the second trial! This sword is a sword that confirms pure love!]\nIt’s a pity, but in this case, the concept of first love was very important!\nIn short, if there was a memory of loving others, it meant defeat. There couldn’t have been a more difficult and eccentric test.\nOf course, there was no way that the love between Shael and me wasn’t pure. So it was only natural that we passed through it easily.\nAfter that, many trials were repeated. Lovers played games that could only be passed when their hearts were aligned, and sometimes they were made to share a warm hug.\nThey even shared a hot kiss in front of a huge crowd.\nIt was never easy to show affection in front of others, so not a few people dropped out.\nMost of the tests were of great difficulty. By this point, there were very few participants left.\n[Ah! There are now four pairs of lovers left.]\nIt was as the host said. Except for Shael and me…the Azbel couple, Denes Anyden and his wife, and the daughter of the Duke of Prell who won the event in the original novel and her fiancé.\nEveryone was a formidable opponent.\n[The last test is to put your hand on a special pillar! According to legend, this pillar was created by the Goddess of Love herself!]\nIt didn’t look like an ordinary pillar. It was because the mana it was flowing out was unusually pink.\n[I will tell you what role the pillar plays. Now, I want you to focus.]\nThe host and the woman next to him put their hands on the pole. Then a number appeared on top of the pillar.\nIt was the number 11.\nThe host, taking a deep breath and smiling shyly, approached the woman next to him, then he kissed her lips.\n“What are you doing all of a sudden?”\n“Ha ha ha! Contrary to how serious the host seems, he has quite the passionate side!”\nLaughter erupted from the spectators under the stage.\nTo be honest, I couldn’t understand what the hell was going on either.\nAfter some time, the host, who had been silent, raised his hand to touch the pillar again.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "It was only then that I was able to realize the host’s intention.\nA while ago, the number was ’11’, and now it changed to ’12’.\n[There must be many people who have noticed. You’re right! If you put your hand on this pillar, it will show you the number of times you k1ssed your lover during the week!]\nThe host turned his attention to the remaining participants. It meant that the final test should now begin.\n‘I’m sure we’ll win this one very easily…’\nShael had been flirting with me for a k1ss for some time now. Not only that, but I also wanted to k1ss Shael over and over again. As a result, Shael and I k1ssed so many times that my lips started to hurt.\n‘If it’s only a week, then…’\nIt should easily exceed 200 times, and if we’re lucky, it may even exceed 300 times!\nEven if it’s just 200 times, you have to k1ss about 28 times a day. So this was an test that could only be a victory for me and Shael. Not only would we win, but we would also receive the admiration of all people. T\nOf course, there would also be people who would point fingers at the result as manipulation.\nI mean, what kind of couple would k1ss 200 times in a week? To be honest, it would normally be impossible.\n‘The problem is that Denes Anyden should already be aware of this. I bet he came here after k1ssing his partner over 200 times.’\nNo, he must have done it a 100 times so as not to seem suspicious. Obviously, he would…it had to be.\nBecause if he lost at the event, he had a lot to lose.\nFirst of all, we focused on the event.\nThe ones who got to go first was the daughter of the Duke of Prell and her fiancé.\nThe number ’30’ appeared on the pillar, similar to how it was in the original novel.\nIt was by no means a low number. They might have become the best lovers in the empire with that kind of number, if it wasn’t for Shael and me.\nNext was the Azbel couple.\nWhen they put their hands on the pillar, many people gasped admiration. It was the same for the host.\n[Ah! 48! A number beyond the 30 has appeared! As expected, the Azbel couple are still going strong!]\nThose two…are they really a middle-aged couple?\nIf they had been a little younger, they might have overpowered even me and Shael!\nIt was said that the Azbel couple had an unusually passionate relationship, and now it seemed it was true.\n“Young Master Eran, I hope you haven’t forgotten about the bet.”\n“Of course, I remember.”\nGiving a confident sneer, Denes Anyden headed to the pillar with his partner.\nIt was the most trembling moment for me. If he had known the contents of the event in advance, he might have intentionally k1ssed his partner a lot.\nNo, I was sure he did.\nI was hoping that the number wouldn’t exceed 200. Maybe Shael and I would have a little over 200 on the pillar.\n“Ah!”\nUnfortunately, my wish didn’t come true. Rather, a number that exceeded my wishes was engraved on the pillar.\n[Ah, ah! No! Is this possible? 348!? Huh, I don’t know what these two have been up to all week!]\nIt was as many as 50 times a day!\nSo, even if they weren’t sleeping, they had to k1ss twice every hour!\nAs I was lost in my thoughts, I saw Denes sneer at me.\n‘This is too much…’\nThere was no way we could win. I thought we’d get a decent number. But to think that they would get a number that exceeded my expectations.\nShael, who was next to me, opened her mouth, “Now it is our turn.”\n“Sorry. It seems I made a stupid bet without even thinking about it.” I apologized to Shael.\nEven if I didn’t keep the promise of kneeling down and granting Denes’ wish, I would still lose the love potion, which I was important for the plan. My head began to ache at the misaligned situation. I was also worried about Shael, who hated to lose.\n“Yes, yes…let’s go.”\nI thought that she would accept my apology in a gloomy manner, but Shael didn’t even make eye contact with me, as if she had done something wrong.\n“What’s wrong?” I carefully asked.\nShael, however, didn’t answer. She ran forward and stood in front of her pillar.\nSo I had no choice but to follow Shael and stand in front of the pillar.\n‘How should I steal the love potion without winning the event. If I don’t get the love potion, I would have to revise my plan…’\nI put my hand on the pillar with Shael, with complicated thoughts in my head.\nThe audience couldn’t help but marvel. Even the host’s voice was filled with a feeling of great disbelief that I hadn’t heard before.\n[Uh, huh? Maybe it’s broken?]\nI quickly turned my head to check the surroundings. The first thing I saw was Shael, whose face was dyed red in embarrassment.\n“What is this! Nonsense!”\nThe second I heard Denes’ protest. The smile on his face had changed to one of horror.\n“Huh…I must learn from this.”\nThe third was Duke Jespen’s admiration.\nThen, I looked at the pillar which had caused such a strange situation.\nAnd, I too had no choice but to open my mouth at the pure absurdity of the situation…where a different number of digits was clearly engraved on the pillar.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "As soon as I checked the pillar, I immediately turned my head to look at Shael.\nShael turned her head away, unable to meet my eyes like she did just before.\nI couldn’t even ask why she was like that. The reason was that my surroundings had become too noisy.\n[What kind of situation is this? Not a year, but an astonishing 1,204 k1sses in a week!]\nAlong with the host’s words, suppressed gasps and murmurs could be heard among the audience.\nAs the host said, the number ‘1,204’ was engraved on the pillar.\n‘What is this number? Is the pillar broken?’\nHowever, apparently that wasn’t the case at all, as it could be understood just by looking at the mana emanating from the pillar. The host also assured that the pillar wasn’t broken.\n[To think…someone could k1ss 172 times in a day…]\nI was glad the plan didn’t go awry, but to be honest, I was kind of feeling really ashamed.\n[It’s unbelievable, but it seems that the Empire’s greatest lovers has been born!]\n1,204 k1sses…made us the best lovers in the Empire. It was something that no one could deny.\nThings moved very quickly after that, as Shael and I came into the waiting room to get our reward. Only then was I able to ask Shael about the situation.\n“What the hell happened? You should also tell me why you are avoiding my gaze from earlier.”\nShael maintained her silence, and her blushing red face made me hesitate to ask more questions about the matter.\n‘Wait, could it be?’\nRecently, Shael looked quite tired. And if I thought about it, from that point on, Shael stopped asking me for k1sses.\n‘Actually, she hadn’t really stopped.’\nThat explanation was something I could accept. If it was the original Shael, she would have asked for dozens or hundreds of k1sses. And that also might be the reason why my lips felt strange every time I woke up.\n“For some reason, it felt like bitten by mosquitoes every time I slept.”\n“Please close your mouth.”\nI did what she wanted. Anyway, thanks to Shael, I was in a situation where I benefited.\n‘Of course, I’ll have to tease her properly later.’\nAfter smiling at Shael, I looked ahead.\nDenes Anyden was coming with the reward for the event. After all, his family was helping with the event.\n‘Now I can easily take the potion.’\nOriginally, someone else would be tasked to come and give it to us. However, Denes himself brought the potion and came alone. It seemed that the bet I had made with Denes had produced the expected result.\nThe loser had to get down on their knees, and grant one of the winner’s wish. In short, Denes was doing this so that he wouldn’t have to kneel in front of the people. It was natural, because kneeling in public was no trivial thing for nobles.\nAnd thanks to that, I would be able to take the potion quite easily.\n“Ha ha ha. I never thought you could k1ss 1,204 times in a week.”\n“Because I am very close with Shael. So it’s not that strange.”\n“First of all, this is the reward of the event. I honestly don’t know if this is real, but they say it’s a love potion.”\n“Can I take it home?”\n“It’s a potion that can be used in various strange ways, so you have to drink it right here.”\nAlright, now it was the time to use the wish.\n“I don’t want to drink it here, so I’ll take it home.”\n“Oh, no. Didn’t I tell you why you must drink here?”\n“Yes, but you haven’t forgotten about the bet, right?”\nDenes frowned.\nI, on the other hand, showed a smile.\n“Okay then, I’ll be take it home.”\n“Keugh…”\n“By the way, you do know that it won’t just end with this, right?”\nI looked at Denes with a dark sneer. It was the trademark smile of Shael, who was a villainess in the past.\nThud!\nDenes Anyden got on his knees.\n“Shouldn’t you do more?”\n“Ah, yes. I apologize for the rudeness back then.”\nIt was a satisfactory result.\nYes, I did want to torment Denes a bit more, but there was no time to waste, so I walked out of the room with Shael, who had a calm expression on her face.\n‘Now…’\nIt was time to execute the most important part of the plan. Even the clock was pointing to the right time.\n‘I can’t take Shael with me, so I need someone to protect her.’\nAs I was thinking about it, I saw someone who would protect her…it was Duke Jespen.\n“Eran, Shael, you’re amazing! I never thought Enella and I would lose. To think it would be 1,204 k1sses…”\n“Ha, ha ha. It’s a coincidence. We were just lucky enough to win.”\n“You just don’t coincidentally k1ss 1,204 times in a week.”\nI thought so too. But, who knows what Shael next to me was thinking.\nAnyway, I entrusted Shael to Duke Jespen. Fortunately, the Azbel family’s magic demonstration was imminent, and the Baslett family also needed me, so I was able to leave without any troubles.\nI was even able to unseal the Ring of Mutual Restriction. It was thanks to Shael’s consideration for the management of the Baslett family.\nNow, it was the time to meet the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.\nThe end of the tedious battle was approaching.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "I put the things brought by the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince in my magic pouch. They really managed to bring everything, even the hard to get ones.\n“Good. With this, things will go the way I want.”\n“Yes, I wish you could create a cure right now.”\n“Okay. But… I need something more.”\nTheir face crumpled at my words. They must have traveled to deserts and cold regions to find fresh ingredients, so it was understandable.\n‘It must have been very difficult.’\nI could tell just by looking at their appearance. They must have already been in a terrible condition because of Clie, but they endured the fatigue and went to those extremely harsh areas.\n“First of all, it would be better to listen while drinking this juice.”\nAnd so the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince didn’t refuse my offer. Rather they quickly picked up the cups and drank the juice. It was juice made from fruits and water bought at the b1ack market auction. A potion that slows one’s ability to think, and rare fruit that weakens one’s ability to stay patient. It was also a juice with a very small amount of Dew of Purification added in, so that they wouldn’t notice anything strange.\nI didn’t give them the love potion right away, because even if I put in all the Dew of Purification, they might notice something strange.\n“This is pretty tasty. So, what about the cure?”\nI had thought about the reasons I would give in my mind in advance, and rambled on. The reasons were pretty convincing so they listened to me with conviction.\n‘Now the effect of the juice must be taking effect.’\nBecause they’ve heard so much, they’ll probably get thirsty.\nIt was only then that I brought out the most important thing in this plan. It was the love potion I received as a reward after winning the event.\n“Looks like you’re thirsty. Would you like to have some of this drink?”\nOf course, normally they would be doubtful. However, after all the fatigue and drinking the strangely effective juice, they didn’t even doubt my suggestion and drank the potion.\nAs soon as the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince drank the potion, they fell asleep with their heads on the desk.\nThe plan worked!\nIt was a complete success. It was something that could be understood by looking at the magical powers of the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.\n‘Was it too much?’\nProbably not. I could tell just by looking at the weapons the Crown Prince was carrying and the magic tools the Mage Tower Lord was carrying.\nThey would have tried to ki1l me if things had gone a little wrong.\n‘In addition, I saw the names of the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince in the reservations for the Azbel family’s magic performance.’\nIf I didn’t stop them here, the Azbel family would have met a terrible end.\nThe Mage Tower Lord couldn’t beat Duke Jespen in the past, but the current Crown Prince and the Mage Tower Lord were quite strong.\nAnyway, the plan worked. So, it was time to meet the original heroine, Clie.\n* * *\nI came to the imperial palace with the gold medallion I took out of the Crown Prince’s pocket. When I showed the gold medallion, the knights of the imperial family opened the door to me without even suspecting a thing.\nMy destination was obvious. It was the hospital room where Clie was being kept. It was easy to find with the guidance of the servants.\n‘There’s no need to knock.’\nKikiiik!\nI deliberately opened the door with force. It was a disrespectful act for a noble, but I heard nothing in response.\nClie was sleeping even during the day. It seemed that she was still suffering from a fever because she didn’t take her medicine properly. That’s why she didn’t wake up from the loud noise.\n‘A letter?’\nThere was a letter next to Clie. It was a letter that seemed to be for the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.\nOf course, I had to read the letter.\n“Hhmmph.”\n[If he can’t make a cure, ki1l him and go to the Azbel family to find the earrings.]\nOf course, there was no direct mention of who to ki1l. But to those who were aware, it was the same as an order to ki1l me.\n‘But it’s already too late.’\nIf she wanted to find the earrings, she should have informed them in advance when she was fine. Although Clie was clever, she failed in the end because she didn’t trust the ones on her side.\nWell, it was to my benefit, so it didn’t matter.\n“Should start now?”\nThut! Thut!\nI turned on the light and knocked on the desk to get Clie to wake up.\nClie’s eyes finally opened.\n“Prince?” Clie, who couldn’t see me properly because of the bright environment, asked.\nAnnoyed that she had been woken up with a loud voice, she frowned, but she let out a flirtatious voice to impress the Crown Prince.\nI wanted to break the silence, and opened my mouth, “The Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince won’t come to you from now on.”\n‘The male protagonists you use to your heart’s content went to experience another genre other than romance and fantasy.’\nI didn’t want to think about that scene any more, so I looked at Clie.\nAs soon as she heard my voice, the expression on Clie’s turned ugly.\nI liked that look on her face, and a smile naturally formed on my mouth. It was a smile that Shael, the villainess, used to give a lot.\nIf anyone saw it, they might mistake me for a villain.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "It was a very different situation from what I had been expecting.\nClie, who had always maintained her composure, gulped her saliva, unable to hide her nervousness.\n‘Of course, that quick-witted heroine wouldn’t just give up that easily.’\nI could immediately tell that it was all just an act. She was doing something under the blanket from an angle I wouldn’t be able to see. As expected, there was an ulterior motive.\n“Is that a magic tool to summon the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince?”\nClie didn’t respond. Probably because she didn’t get any response from the magic tool.\n“Unfortunately, they can’t come anymore.”\n“How…”\n“Hmm.”\nWhat should I say? I didn’t want to tell her what I had done to them.\n“They both like women who are filthy and selfish, so I introduced them to partners with similar taste.”\nIt stung my conscience a little, but it wasn’t exactly a lie either. They both had similar personalities, so they’ll get along just fine.\nClie erased the expression from before, and made a pitiful look on her face, “Ugh, Young master. I’m sorry for being rude in front of Shael before. Young Master might have misunderstood…”\nA rude act she had committed in front of Shael. She was probably referring to the time when she said strange things like liking me in front of Shael. She was even making a pitiful expression to arouse the feeling of pity.\nIt wouldn’t have been strange for any other men to fall for her lie. But, unfortunately the opponent she was facing was me. Except for Shael, there was no woman who could control me at will.\n‘Honestly, it laughable…’\nI almost died from Clie’s scheme and then regressed. In addition, I saw the letter that was placed next to her bed, telling the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince to ki1l me.\nIt was an apology full of ulterior motives from Clie, who didn’t know that I had read the letter.\n‘It wouldn’t be fun if I immediately rejected the apology.’\nHope could be a painful thing if it was denied at the end. Therefore, it was a situation I was grateful for, as I wanted Clie to suffer the pain I had been through.\nI relaxed my expression a bit, as if I had been affected by her excuse, “Is that how one should apologize?”\n“Ah no!”\nClie pulled off the blanket and sat up in a hurry as if she was eager do something. Then she got down from the hospital bed, which couldn’t even be called a hospital bed, and quickly fell to her knees.\nAnd so, here she was, lowering her head in defeat.\n‘It feels refreshing.’\nHowever, I couldn’t smile.\nThe reason was Clie’s outfit. She was wearing clothes that exposed a lot of skin, only covering some of the important parts.\nTo be honest, it was unpleasant. If Shael was present, she would have covered my eyes in fright.\n“Get up, cover yourself with the blanket again and lie down on the bed. Your current appearance is disgusting.”\nClie, who felt the irritation expressed by my words, stood up as I said. Clie was acting slowly as if trying to figure out my sudden change of mood.\nAnd, right at the moment Clie stood up and was facing me, the door to the hospital room, which had been firmly closed, opened.\nKikiiik!\nAs I saw the person opening the door, my eyes widened.\n‘Shael!’\nThe person who opened the door to the hospital room was Shael, who I thought was with Duke Jespen.\nShael’s face contorted as she checked the inside of the hospital room.\nShe had walked in right at the moment Clie was standing facing me. Clie’s clothes were revealing quite a bit of skin, and to make the matter even worse I had come to Clie’s hospital room after saying that I was leaving to help the Baslett family.\nThis was the imperial hospital room, and Shael shouldn’t have overheard any conversation because of the excellent soundproofing. So it was inevitable that Shael would misunderstand.\nAnd so, I had to explain the situation, “Shael, that’s…”\n“Ah, Young Lady Shael! Let me explain!”\nClie hurriedly cut me off.\nI couldn’t even react properly due to the confusing situation. Looking at Shael’s distorted face, my brain froze, and Clie took the opportunity to continue speaking.\n“Young Master just came to visit the hospital! Uh, that’s right. And, Young Master didn’t do anything…”\nShe continued to speak with a smile as if she was helping me.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Obviously, Clie was doing all of that to inflate Shael’s anger.\nAll the while, she would turn her head slightly to look at something. What she was looking at was the letter she had written for the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.\nThe envelope of the letter was torn, so she must’ve realized that I had read the letter.\nClie secretly turned her eyes towards the letter once more. She must be thinking of a way to get rid of the letter before Shael could read it.\n‘Anyway, things didn’t go the way I wanted, but I’m going to vent my anger at least a little bit.’\nClie wanted to distract Shael and buy herself some time. The way she was acting proved that. And her plan seemed to have paid off quite well.\nShael looked more angry than usual, and I could see that the anger was directed at me.\nTogak! Togak!\nShael approached me. It felt like my heart froze at Shael’s cold gaze. As she got closer, I could see Shael’s hand rising little by little. So I closed my eyes tightly as if I had become an idiot.\nTogak! Togak!\nFinally, the sound of Shael’s shoes came close. My hearing, strengthened by my mana, could even detect the sound of Shael lifting her arm vigorously.\nI closed my eyes even harder, enduring the endless anxiety, while preparing my cheek to be slapped by Shael’s palm.\nTaashp!\nAnd a sharp sound flowed into my ears. However, I didn’t feel any pain.\nThe source of the sharp sound was also not me.\nFeeling strange, I opened my eyes, only to see Clie, who was clutching her flushed cheeks, and Shael with her raised hand.\n“Eh, huh?”\nClie was stunned, as if her head wasn’t working properly as she said to Shael, “I…I have done nothi…”\nBefore Clie finished speaking, Shael moved her arm again.\nTaashp!\nA louder sound rang out than just before.\nClie couldn’t offer any resistance and fell face down. The disease must have weakened her body, so it was a natural result.\n“It’s the payback for spilling wine on my dress.”\nThe villainess had a cold gaze, as she continued her words without giving Clie time to catch her breath.\n“I want to do the same to you.”\nShael’s eyes turned to Clie’s attire.\n“But, it would be a waste of wine if I poured wine on that body.”\n‘Is Shael recycling my insult? It seems more effective than mine.’\nI couldn’t help but admire Shael’s skill in insulting others. But I soon had to stop my admiration, because Shael’s eyes turned to me.\n“Sha, Shael?”\nSimilar to when she had slapped Clie on the cheek, I saw Shael holding her hand up.\n‘Now it’s my turn…’\nI tried to close my eyes tight like before. But fortunately, what I was worried about didn’t happen.\nShael reached out her hand to cover my eyes.\n“Eh..what you are doing?”\n“You can’t look at a thing like that.”\nIn short, she didn’t want me to look at Clie.\nI wanted to laugh at Shael’s sudden act of cuteness, but I barely held it in because of the situation. Now that I was aware of that fact, I tried to get Shael to remove her hand. But I couldn’t, because she seemed to be doing something else.\nChwaaarh!\nI felt Shael activate her mana and at the same time, I heard the sound of splashing water. The water was so cold that even I, who couldn’t see anything, could feel the chill.\n“Kyaa!”\nAt the same time, Clie’s scream was heard.\n‘She doesn’t even know how to scream properly…’\nI got goosebumps at Shael’s creepy behavior without knowing why. Anyways, now that she was done with what she wanted to to, Shael should allow me to look, so I said while Shael’s hand was still covering my eyes.\n“I understand, please let me look.”\nBut it seemed that I was completely wrong. On the contrary, Shael was covering my eyes even harder, as if I definitely wasn’t allowed to look.\n“Why, why are you doing that? You’re hurting my eyes!”\n“Bah, because I sprayed the water like an idiot, her clothes are now transparent…”\n‘What are you talking about?’\nThe arrogant and cold villainess from earlier had disappeared, and now Shael’s voice seemed quite agitated.\n‘I came here because I wanted to take revenge, but…’\nMy plans were ruined by the villainess.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "A few minutes passed.\nIt was only then that Shael released my eyes.\n“Since when have you been following me?”\n“I can’t tell you that.”\nI didn’t know how Shael knew where I was. However, it was clear that she had the means to track me down, and even if she didn’t, she could easily have followed me.\nAnyways, the important question right now was something else…what if Shael had been following me for a long time?\nShe might know what I did to the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.\n‘Well, it doesn’t it matter even is she knows…’\nBesides, Shael might even like it. Because Shael hated the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince as well.\n“That…”\nClie wanted to speak up, but then looked at me and Shael, and remained silent as if she couldn’t find a way out of the situation.\nAnd so, the silence continued, until I broke it.\nI pulled out a rope I had prepared in advance. It was a rope so strong that it couldn’t be easily untied or cut even with magic. Of course, Clie, whose body was in a weakened state, wouldn’t be able to do that.\nAfter tying Clie’s wrists with the rope, I tied the other end of the rope to a sturdy-looking pole. To guard against an unexpected situation, I also removed all the magic tools and scrolls in the hospital room. It was to keep Clie from escaping while I was away.\n“What, what are you doing!”\nIgnoring Clie’s plea, I took Shael’s hand and led her outside.\nKikiiik!\nI opened the door to the hospital room and came out. It was necessary to achieve the purpose I had in mind in advance. Currently, due to the Imperial Festival, there were only a few imperial knights left around the hospital.\nOf course, it still didn’t make sense that there would only be a few knights in the hospital of the imperial palace.\n‘It must be because of the Crown Prince.’\nThat crazy obsessive male lead would have hated the fact that there were other men in the building where Clie was. That’s why he put Clie in a quiet place such as this one.\nIn fact, it would be more correct to call this hospital a building near the imperial palace rather than the imperial family’s hospital.\nThat’s why there were no knights except for the entrance. Placing the knights at the entrance was for the purpose of security, and that was the extent that clown could allow.\n“Where are we going?”\n“I’m looking for something…a door to be exact.”\nAnd, as I had expected, not far from the hospital room, I saw a majestic looking door.\nEven at first glance, it looked like it would be a door of a room used by a high-ranking person. Of course, only the Crown Prince could use this room.\nI opened the door, easily dispelling the protection magic. And I was able to achieve my purpose as soon as I entered the room.\nIt was a diary.\nA diary that seemed to have been written by the Crown Prince was lying on the desk. In the diary, there should be names of people close to Clie, as it was in the original novel.\n‘As expected.’\nI found a list full of some familiar names, along with their relationship with Clie . There were also names that were crossed out. The owners of those names were people who had “disappeared” due to unknown reasons. As expected of that idiotic male lead, he was ki1ling men who had a close relationship with Clie one after another.\n[Eran Baslett.]\nIt had my name as well.\nThe names that were not yet crossed out belonged to the people the Crown Prince judged dangerous to deal with, or he would deal with later. Anyways, the information would be useful. But, I couldn’t take the diary with me, so I wrote the names of people close to Clie on paper and kept it with me.\nI was also quite surprised with how he wrote the nature of my relationship with Clie in the diary. He seemed to have thought that we were quite close.\nOf course, that couldn’t be more far from the truth.\nAnyways, I was doing something suspicious, so I expected that Shael might ask what I was doing, but she just stood next to me in silence.\nI was a little touched. It meant that I had her unconditional trust.\n“That should be enough. Let’s go back to the hospital room.”\n“Yes.”\nUnsurprisingly, Clie was still confined to the hospital bed. Now I would have to make her unconscious and take her to the Baslett family for further punishment.\n“Ah, ugh!”\nI was about to untie the rope, but had to stop, because there was an intruder.\nTak! Tak! Tak!\nNo one was supposed to have access to this place, but it seemed someone still came here.\nBefore long, a voice was heard from outside.\n“Clie, are you feeling well? I brought some good food to help with the fever.”\nIt was a voice I knew. It was Kaeson, the leader of the Imperial Knights, one of the most outstanding knights in the Empire.\nFrom what I saw in the prince’s diary, he was a man who was quite close to Clie. He still some use to him, so the Crown Prince hadn’t ki1led him yet.\n“Ka, Kaeson!”\n“I heard voices in the hospital room, so I though you woke up.”\nIf I don’t think of a solution soon, Kaeson would probably open the door and come in.\nAs if to prove that statement to be true, Kaeson’s knocking on the door intensified.\n‘As expected, there were quite a lot of people she had seduced.’\nAnyway, the situation was dangerous.\nI wouldn’t lose to Kaeson, but if I had someone to protect, the situation would change.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "So I decided to take action right away.\n“You better keep your mouth shut.” I raised the scabbard of my sword and threatened Clie, whose eyes widened in surprise.\nMy actions must’ve surprised even Shael who was standing next to me, as I usually didn’t act with such ruthlessness in front of Shael, but unfortunately I had no choice.\n“…!”\nClie let out an inaudible sigh of resignation.\nI didn’t pay attention to that and quickly swung the scabbard down on her neck.\nThut!\nI knocked her out using a moderate amount of strength, and put the scabbard back at my waist.\nIt was only then that Shael, who had maintained her silence, opened her mouth, “What, what are you doing?”\n“If I didn’t knock her out, she would definitely scream as soon as I open the door.”\n“Yes, but…”\n“It very similar to that merciless slap on the cheek, so don’t think much of it.”\nAfter a short conversation with Shael, I opened the door to the hospital room.\nThe Knight Commander Kaeson was still standing outside.\n“You, why are you here?”\n“The Crown Prince have requested the Baslett family for a cure that is helpful in treating the patient’s illnesses. The treatment process is currently ongoing, so don’t disturb us.”\nAs soon as I finished speaking, the Knight Commander expressed genuine gratitude, and withdrew. It was fortunate that this guy was much easier to deal with than the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.\nShael looked at me with her mouth wide open.\n“You hit her on the head with your scabbard and said you came here to heal her…”\n“There is a saying that a good beating is the best medicine. So, I said the truth.”\nI gave Shael a witty response and approached the now unconscious Clie. In order to make sure that Clie’s disappearance wouldn’t be discovered, I had to make it seem like she had left on her own.\nEven if a few knights saw me, it would be fine, because no one would believe that a honorable descendant of a high-ranking ducal family would go out of his way to kidnap someone. In fact, it didn’t even matter if it was revealed that I had kidnapped Clie.\n‘Perks of being a descendant of a high-ranking ducal family.’\nUnless the opponent was someone like the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince, there was no one who could be my opponent. So, I was able to return to the Baslett family without worrying about meeting other people using the teleportation device I had taken from the Crown Prince’s room.\n* * *\nAfter that, things moved quickly.\nFirst of all, Clie, who was unconscious, was imprisoned in the Baslett family’s prison. I even used magic tools to restrict her actions in order to prevent anything unforeseen from happening.\nOf course, my revenge wasn’t over yet, but first I wanted to relieve the fatigue from the festival.\nSince my father, Duke Ezran said he’d be coming back today, I needed to prepare. So Shael and I spent time eating dessert, and making out as usual.\nThen I started looking through some paperwork for the Baslett family.\n“So the gamble was successful?”\n“Yes, as you said, I bet a lot of money, so I made a lot of money as well.”\nIt was thanks to me and Shael’s victory at the Empire Festival, it would be possible for the people of Baslett estate to live a slightly more affluent life.\nAs soon as the matter of gamb1ing came up, I felt Shael glaring at me, but I couldn’t help it. So I tried not to look at Shael and focused more on my butler.\n“The head of the family said that he would be back today.”\n“Yeah, I know that too.”\nToday, I wanted to have a serious talk with Duke Ezran, so I was feeling a little nervous. I thought that’s all the butler had to say, but I saw him hesitating, as if he had something more to say.\n“What is it?”\n“Actually, we just got a strange transaction request.”\n“What is the request?”\n“It was a request to buy the Baslett family’s swordsmanship manual.”\nThat kind of business was of great help to the Baslett family’s finances. It was a business where we sell a few of the swordsmanship manuals belonging to the family at high prices.\n“What is so strange about the transaction? Did they ask for an important swordsmanship manual by any chance?”\n“No. Rather it is the opposite. Actually…”\nThe butler held out a swordsmanship manual. It was a book that detailed one of the sword techniques of the Baslett family. However, it was not an important sword technique, nor was it very useful in battle, so I became a bit confused.\n‘This is indeed a bit strange…’\nAs if understanding my confusion, the butler responded, “There is someone who wants to buy this swordsmanship manual for 10 million gold.”\n“What!?”\nI thought I heard it wrong, but I didn’t. The butler was nodding his head as if to confirm it.\n“No, why would anyone want to buy a sword technique that cleanly cuts off a body part?”\n“I don’t know as well. Since it usually requires a lot of mana, it is said that the sword technique can allow the user to amputate parts of the body cleanly without any pain.”\nI didn’t understand it at all, but it would benefit me none the less, I had no reason to refuse.\nA sword technique for cutting off body parts. Of course, it was a completely unpopular sword technique. I would be very happy if I could sell it for 10 million gold.\n‘But still…I feel like it’s something really disgusting…’\nAt the same time, I felt strangely refreshed. It gave me a similar feeling of getting revenge on Clie and those two male protagonists. It greatly lifted my mood.\nAfter ordering the butler to sell swordsmanship manual right away, I continued to spend time with Shael.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Baslett family’s prison.\nThis place had a cold, dreary atmosphere, and in one of the cells of the prison, Clie was being held captive, still unconscious.\n‘What should I do now?’\nWhen Clie’s blood clotting disease reached its peak, she developed a high fever. After that, she would make an unexpected recovery, and after living a healthy for about a week, she would die.\nSo if left unattended, Clie would be dead within a week. And at the moment, her fever was slowly dropping, indicating that she was getting closer to her eventual demise.\nOf course, I don’t want it to end things like that.\nWhen Clie broke into the Azbel family. She obviously could have caught me and Shael right away, but she let us escape.\n‘Considering how fast she appeared just a moment later, she must have been to playing with us.’\nInvading the Azbel family in the first place was a mortal sin. So Clie had to be punished!\nThat’s why I took a risk and acquired the list of people close to Clie from the Crown Prince’s room.\n‘The territory closest to the Baslett family, should be the territory of Count Tedel…’\nIf Clie escaped, she would go to the territory of Count Tedel. Because it was also the family with the most people who supported Clie.\nThe Count Tedel family was also an important family in the original novel. So I should be able to handle them quite easily.\n‘It should be easy.’\nI came up with a plan to completely shatter Clie, and sent a letter to Count Tedel. I also prepared some magic tools to use on Clie.\nAnd, thanks to meticulous planning, the situation went according to my wishes. It would have been more perfect if not for Shael, who was glaring at me from the side.\n“Could it be that my fiancé, who caused me so much suffering at the Imperial Festival, have forgotten to pay me back just because the festival is over.”\n“You have never suffered.”\nAs soon as I returned to the Baslett family, I spent quite a lot of my time with Shael. Of course, we couldn’t be together all the time because I had to take care of some things and prepare for my revenge against Clie.\nFurthermore, Duke Ezran would be returning soon, so to be honest, I didn’t have much time to spend with Shael.\nIn the first place, did I make Shael suffer at the Imperial Festival?\nObviously not!\nRather, I was the one who went through all the suffering. To be precise, the me of the past, who was secretly k1ssed by her every night.\n“You k1ssed me every night…come to think of it, did you do it for the Imperial Festival?”\n“Ha, yes. Next time, I will aim for five digits.”\n“If you do that, our lips will wear out!”\nI mean, it not like I didn’t like it.\n‘For now, spending time with Shael is the priority.’\nIt was natural. Because my most important treasure was Shael.\nWe walked around the Baslett family’s mansion together, and made Shael’s favorite dessert. We also talked together in the garden, which was my favorite place in the Baslett family’s mansion.\n“No, did Duke Jespen really gamb1e?”\n“It’s real. My mother is lecturing father for that.”\nShael looked at me, as if realizing that her fiancé also gamb1ed, she also began to lecture me, and I responded to her lecture in a composed manner.\nSuddenly, Shael asked me with a serious expression, “I heard that your father is coming back soon.”\n“Yes, he is.”\n“Looking back at it, we used to be really awkward around each other.”\nShael looked at me as if was feeling hesitant to say something.\nIt was quite rare for her to make such an expression, so I assured her, “You can speak freely.”\n“It’s strange. What the hell happened between you two to make things so awkward?”\nThat was a bit of a difficult question to answer. Even though I regained my memories after breaking Clie’s bracelet, my relationship with Duke Ezran remained quite distant. So I began to evade the issue in any way I could.\nYou could say that our relationship had become awkward, or you could say that it was like that from the beginning.\nBut, I didn’t want to keep it a secret from Shael. Even if it hurt me, I just wanted to tell her the truth.\nIt seemed that at some point, I began to see Shael not only as a woman I loved, but also as someone I could rely on.\n“I was raised by a very kind person…”\nBefore I came to this world, I didn’t have any parents, and I lived with my aunt all my life. She was the perfect embodiment of kindness, and motherly love. She raised me like her own son, and I treated her as my mother.\nAnd so, I told Shael about something from before I came to this world.\n“She is not here right now….but I grew up relying on only one person, so it’s awkward for me to lean on someone else.”\nIt must be completely incomprehensible to Shael, who didn’t know the truth of my existence. However, she acted differently than I had thought.\nShael’s expression became a bit sad, as if she was trying to empathize with me.\n“I’m also sad that I can’t see your mother….”\nShe was talking about Daria Baslett…the wife of Duke Ezran and the mother of Eran Baslett.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "It seemed that Shael had mistaken the person I mentioned for raising me for Daria Baslett.\n‘Well, I guess it’s only natural for her to think that way.’\nIf anyone could have raised Eran Baslett, it could be the only be his mother, Daria Baslett.\nMy heart ached for some reason. I also had a strange feeling. I didn’t want to leave even the slightest misunderstanding with Shael. So it would be right to clear up the misunderstanding.\nStrangely, I didn’t want to…and I listened to Shael’s words, struggling to resist grabbing my throbbing head.\n“How was she?”\n“She was kind. and at times very strict.”\nShael nodded her head as if telling me to speak more. She was clearly quite interested in hearing about her.\nTherefore, I decided to tell Shael more of the stories about my aunt.\n“She really liked drinking tea. You could say she was addicted to it.”\nCome to think of it, there was something that surprised me as soon as I came to this world. The Baslett family, famous for their swordsmanship, had a surprisingly large number of tea cups and various types of tea.\n‘The strange thing is, no one in the Baslett family likes tea very much.’\nI only saw Duke Ezran drinking tea alone from time to time. Thanks to that, I was able to enjoy various types of tea with Shael, which benefitted me quite a lot.\nAs I thought about those matters, the memories with my aunt began to flood back to me.\n‘What did she like more…?’\n“She was also very fond of gardening.”\nI thought of the Baslett family’s gardens. If my aunt saw the place where Shael and I were currently sitting, she would’ve been very happy. I didn’t see anyone go in and out of this place except for Shael and me, but strangely this place was always quite well-maintained.\n“Your mother had a lot of good hobbies.”\nIt was actually my aunt. But, I didn’t try to correct her anymore. I just nodded gently and looked up at the high sky.\nDense trees covered the sky. Even so, the bright sun was shining down on me.\nAs I looked up at the sky, I was enveloped by a sudden feeling of warmth.\nThe source of that warmth, was Shael. She was hugging me as if she was trying to soothe me.\nI too leaned closer and hugged her back. And so, we remained in each others embrace for a while.\nShrush!\nSuddenly, I sensed a presence in the dense bush not far away. It was none other than Duke Ezran. However, I didn’t separate from Shael. I didn’t want to be disturbed for now.\n‘I’ll be able to talk to him soon.’\nI had a lot to say to Duke Ezran, and a lot to hear.\nAt the same time, I had to solve the awkwardness between us, and I wanted to know about what happened to the Baslett family.\n‘And…’\nI had to change my mindset where I kept thinking of him as ‘Duke Ezran’. I needed to think of him more as a family member.\nIt was going to be a very difficult thing to do, and I felt a little nervous, but as soon as I hugged Shael more, I felt relieved.\n* * *\n[Duke Ezran POV]\nDuke Ezran stepped away from the garden.\nIt was Daria’s favorite place, so he came to take care of it quite often, but thanks to Eran, he didn’t have to.\nBut that didn’t mean that coming to the garden was meaningless.\n[She was kind. and at times very strict.]\n[She really liked drinking tea. You could say she was addicted to it.]\n[She was also very fond of gardening.]\nDuke Ezran was satisfied listening to Eran’s story.\nIn Eran’s story, Daria seemed to have lived a pretty happy life. Fortunately, the price he had paid for everything in the past seemed to have worked out.\nDuke Ezran remembered the past. He thought of the time when he made that deal with that dark being. It was a deal that took everything from him, but it also gave many things back in return.\nDaria seemed to have lived a satisfying life as well.\nEven so, Duke Ezran was unable to feel anything. He didn’t even have the ability to resent the existence that took away those emotions.\n“Kh-kheuph!”\nDark red b1ood flowed from Duke Ezran’s mouth as he continued to cough.\nThe color of the b1ood, which was getting darker by the day, was a sign that the disease that was getting worse. It was an unknown incurable disease he had acquired as one of the terms of bringing Eran back.\nHowever, despite the suffering, Duke Ezran’s expression still remained calm, and he walked towards his office to handle the matters of the Baslett family.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "I felt the world shake.\nNo, to be precise, it was me who was shaking.\nIn the awkward atmosphere, I looked directly at Duke Ezran.\nHe too was watching me with calm…empty eyes.\nTherefore, I decided to speak first in order to break the ice, “Father, it has been a while…”\n“Yes, indeed it has. I haven’t seen you in weeks.”\nThe conversation stopped at that…and the atmosphere, which had warmed up a little, seemed to cool down again.\nI managed to squeeze all my strength and said, “I have regained all the memories.”\nAt those words, Duke Ezran nodded his head. It obviously should’ve been a matter of great surprise. However, his expression didn’t reveal a single bit of emotion.\n‘As expected, I guess I was right.’\nIn the memory I had experienced after breaking the bracelet, Duke Ezran was able to use the Aura, but now he couldn’t. The most important thing in producing the Aura was emotion. So it was obvious what Duke Ezran had lost in the process of saving me.\nFurthermore, that wasn’t even the most important thing that had been lost.\nThe Baslett family’s mansion had lost its former bright atmosphere. The biggest reason for that was the absence of Daria Baslett, the wife of Duke Ezran.\n“I am aware of the situation. Still, I want you to tell the story yourself.”\n“Unfortunately, I can’t do that.” Duke Ezran shook his head.\nIt was as I thought. There was no way he could talk about the past. It was obvious that there would be some sort of restriction. If there wasn’t, I’m sure he would have told me long ago.\nDuke Ezran’s temporary disappearance must have been related to those restrictions as well. It was just a pity that I couldn’t grasp the situation more than that.\n‘Still, there are many things I have to do right now.’\nI wanted to treat Duke Ezran as my father.\nHowever, before I could say something, Duke Ezran spoke to me first.\n“But you don’t have to worry too much. Just be careful of one thing…cough!”\nSuddenly, Duke Ezran stopped talking with a cough. Then he frowned as if he was feeling uncomfortable, and rose from his seat.\n‘B1ood..?’\nBlood began to pour out little by little from Duke Ezran’s mouth.\n“Ehh, are you okay!?”\n“It’s okay. Looks like I swung my sword a little too hard during this week.”\nI didn’t ask more about the issue. Because it seemed like Duke Ezran didn’t want to talk about it at all. In fact, I was able to guess the reason why he suddenly coughed up b1ood.\n‘Perhaps it’s because of the restrictions.’\nHe must have coughed up blood for trying to say something related to my memory. In that case, it would be the right choice to stop the conversation here for now. It would be better to try to come up with a solution later.\nAfter confirming that Duke Ezran had entered his room, I sighed.\n‘Should I go and comfort Shael?’\nNo…first of all, I had to take care of the Baslett family’s paperwork that had piled up so that Duke Ezran could rest.\n* * *\nWhat caught my eye was the documents piled up like a mountain.\nAfter turning my head and looking at the documents piled up next to me, I could clearly see the hardships that lay ahead.\n“Where is Shael now?”\n“The Young Lady is waiting for you in your room. She told you to come see her when you were done.”\nThe Baslett family’s butler said that in response to my question.\nThere was a simple reason why Shael, who never wanted to be separated from me, had left me alone and was now waiting in my room.\n‘It was because I said I wanted to help my father.’\nNo matter how clingy Shael was, she wouldn’t interfere in such a matter.\nI, of course, had my doubts because she had given up so easily. However, it should be all right since I could just lighten her mood with dessert later.\nAnd if that didn’t work, a few k1sses from me was guaranteed to Shael feel better.\nTherefore, I looked at a letter, while imagining Shael puffing out her cheeks all alone in the room.\n“Has this family ever sent a letter to our family?”\n“I believe no. There was no particular point of contact between us, and I was unaware of their existence prior to this.”\nThe butler also tilted his head in confusion. Since he was devoted to the Baslett family, his opinion was quite trustworthy.\n‘Then it’s indeed questionable…’\nIf even the butler was confused, it could very well be an important letter. In fact, it could be something urgent. This letter not only looked luxurious, but also had a sophisticated magic circle to maintain its privacy.\nTherefore, I didn’t delay and opened the letter. Then I saw the words scribbled on it.\n[Eran Baslett.]\nIt began with the direct mention of my name…proving just how rude the sender was.\n[Unfortunately, we couldn’t participate in the Imperial Festival. But we want to prove our love.]\nI couldn’t understand what this meant…\n‘Did the person write the letter while drunk?’\nWith growing doubts, I looked down and read the rest of the letter.\n[Eran Baslett, we challenge you! Let’s decide the Empire’s Best Lovers!]\nIt has already been decided that the best lovers in the Empire was me and Shael. We proved it with our pure love, and above all else, with a ridiculous number of k1sses…1,203 times to be exact.\nNo one could possibly hope to defeat Shael and me after that.\nSo it was all outrageous!\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "‘Who the hell sent me this letter?’\nI quickly checked the letter one again. It was only then that I was able to notice something familiar.\nThe letter had the same mana signature of the Mage Tower Lord and it had the same handwriting as the diary I had stolen from the Crown Prince’s room.\nBoth of the things were contained withing the same letter. Furthermore, it was also mentioned that they were the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince at the end of the letter.\nMy face wrinkled. I thought I would never see them again, but now they were harassing me with letters.\n‘That’s crazy. Let’s choose the best lovers in the Empire? Does 1,203 k1sses look like a joke to you?’\nI tried to tear up the letter of the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince, who I myself had pushed down a dark path. Anyways, I didn’t want to think about them any more.\nTo be honest, I was disgusted and didn’t want to see what they were doing behind the scenes.\nBut unfortunately…the eyes I had trained as a swordsman read even the phrases I didn’t want to read.\n[We have doubled the 1,203 k1sses you boast about!]\n“Fnck!”\nUnbeknownst to me, a curse came out of my mouth.\nThe butler standing next to me looked at me in amazement.\nShrrrrt…fasasak!\nI immediately tore the letter to shreds. Then I tried my best to fix my crumpled face and said to the butler.\n“From now on, do not accept letters from the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.”\n“Pardon? Was that letter from them?”\nSuddenly, a memory from a while ago popped into my head. That letter had a strange family name as well.\nIt was clear that the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince had sent me the letter like that so that I wouldn’t ignore the letter.\nI focused on my work while cursing at them in my heart. However, in the letters that followed, the chronicles of the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince continued.\n[Do you know? I heard that a certain genre of novels where genders are switched are popular in the Empire these days.]\n[So the Master of the Mage Tower Lord made a very big decision.]\n‘It’s a letter from another family.’\nBut why is the sender the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince?\nI burned the letters sent by the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince to ashes. After that, I had no choice but to stare at the innocent butler. Because I couldn’t hold back the anger that piled up every time I read a letter.\nThe butler was taken aback by my gaze, “It seems…it seems that they are continuing to send letters using the\nname of another family.”\nAs expected, it was correct. Then the letters couldn’t be ignored. Because we shouldn’t ignore an important letter. So there was only one thing I could do.\n“Let someone else review future letters.”\n“Yes. As you wish!”\nI felt sorry for the person who would be incharge of reading the letters, but I couldn’t help it.\n* * *\n[Shael’s POV]\nShael raised her head with a satisfied smile.\nIn front of her, the butler of the Baslett family was giving a report while sweating profusely.\n“Young Lady, as you had instructed, I handed the letter to the Young Lord.”\n“And so?”\n“After reading the letters, he said he would entrust the letters to someone else from now on.”\nHehehe!\nShael let out a creepy laugh.\nThe butler watched Shael and asked her a question, “He said that the sender of the letter was not the Young Lady, but the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince. Could it be that there was a mistake?”\n“No, everything is as it should be. You can go now. Eran should be done with the work, so tell him to come here.”\nThe butler hurriedly nodded his head and left the room.\nEven then, Shael continued to smile with satisfaction. Then she turned her head and looked at her desk.\nA pen was placed on the desk along with luxurious stationery. Furthermore, there were magic tools procured from the Mage Tower to deceive Eran more precisely.\nThe letter was written in the Crown Prince’s handwriting. However, it was written by none other than Shael.\nIronically, it was the worst masterpiece that Shael, who had read the diary written by the Crown Prince, had ever created by forging his handwriting.\nThe beginning of the situation was rather simple.\nShael had previously made Eran drunk using the Potion of Intoxication. In that state, Eran had told her about all his plans. That’s how Shael was able to know about what he wanted to do with the love potion.\nIt was a shocking plan, but it was rather beneficial to Shael. Thanks to that, she was able to use it to spend more time with Eran.\nHonestly, she felt a bit reluctant to write the letters. But that didn’t matter. Because it was more important to spend time with Eran.\nKikiiik!\nJust then, Eran entered the room. He was making a face as if he was annoyed by something.\n“What happened?”\nShael asked Eran as if she didn’t know anything.\n“Nothing…”\n“Really? Come here at once.”\nAs Shael said, Eran came closer and she took him in her embrace.\nEran seemed to be feeling quite fatigued, so Shael thought that now they would be able to be together all day.\nAnd so, Shael nodded her head in satisfaction.\nHer plan worked perfectly.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "The sound of the chain scraping the floor reached my ears.\nIt meant that Clie, who had been unconscious, had finally woken up.\n“Hhngh, this is…”\n“Are you awake? Just how long did you stay unconscious with just one blow to the head?”\nA slight frown appeared on Clie’s face, but she quickly managed to erase that expression.\nSeeing her lips twitch, I could tell that Clie was hiding her true feelings, she had no choice but to do it.\nAt the moment, she was constrained with iron chains, and all sorts of magic tools. She was in a situation where she had to be polite even if she wanted to curse at me.\nSo things were as it should be…except for the fact that, at the moment, Shael was standing by my side.\nFor that reason, I couldn’t “harass” Clie as I wished.\n“Shael, we should leave.”\n“No. I have to do something…”\nAfter that, Shael took something out from her magic pouch. It was something I had seen in the Holy Kingdom. While on our way to the Blessing Meeting, Shael had bought a lie detector.\nIt was just a magic tool meant for the purpose of having fun. Naturally, there was no way that such a thing would have the ability to detect other people’s lies.\nHowever, Shael showed the lie detector to Clie.\n“Wha…what is that?”\n“This entire time, I was curious about why you poured wine on me back then…”\nWas it not enough to slap her in the hospital room before?\nNow Shael was asking Clie with an annoyed expression on her face.\n“Eh..that was by mistake.”\nCreeb!\nThe moment Clie gave her reply, the red light on the lie detector magic tool turned on. It meant that Clie’s words were lies.\nTaaashhhk!\nClie’s head turned to the side due to the force of Shael’s sharp slap.\nEven so, Shael’s anger didn’t seem to subside.\n‘Come to think of it, it seems that Shael hates Clie more than I do.’\nClie had spilled wine on Shael’s favorite dress for no reason, and she even tried to ruin our relationship. Shael also knew that Clie was the source of the strange rumors about her running rampant throughout the empire. Furthermore, there were many other instances where Clie tired to harm her as well. So from Shael’s point of view, Clie was her enemy.\nShael continued to ask, “I heard you tried to do something strange to the Azbel family as well. Is that true?”\n“Oh no..never!”\nClie had no choice but to deny it. She would definitely suffer if the lie detector tool judged her claim to be a lie.\nTing!\nAnd, the lie detector judged Clie’s words to be true. For Clie, it was quite fortunate.\nTaaashk!\nHowever, Clie’s head turned to the other side all the same.\n“The lie detector tool is broken.”\n“….”\n‘What should I say…as expected of the villainess?’\nThe villainess’s ability to tease and harass opponents was excellent. To be honest, I was grateful to Shael for acting like a klutz only in front of me.\nAnd so, similar sharp sounds continued to resound in the Baslett family’s prison. I was able to leave the prison only after Shael felt hungry after a while.\nBut Shael didn’t go to the dining area. She stood still and quietly grabbed my wrist.\n“What is it?”\nAt the moment, Shael was bending her mouth as if she had something to say to me.\nThen I directed my gaze, which was on Shael’s mouth, towards her hand. Because Shael was hiding something from me with her hands behind her back.\n“There are a lot of things that needs to be clarified. For example, this…”\nShael held out the thing she had been hiding.\nIt was a something I recognized…a potion to be exact.\nIt was the potion that Rayel Tarden had given me in the past, saying that it would help with matters of love.\n“What is it?”\n“What is it? It’s a potion I stole from your pocket.”\nI thought I had lost it, but apparently it was taken by Shael. Honestly, I didn’t want to use it, but still kept it with me thinking that it might be of use in some other matters.\n“Oh, then give it back…”\nClang!\nThe potion that fell from Shael’s hand, then shattered and spilled on the floor.\nI was dumbfounded by the incomprehensible situation, but I couldn’t help but wake up to Shael’s passionate gaze.\n“I heard it’s a potion that helps with matters of love.”\n“I don’t remember ever saying that.”\nIn the first place, I had never taken out that potion in front of Shael. But then I remembered another thing.\n‘You said that when you were drunk.’\nI cursed the me from the past for drinking the wine Shael had given me without question. Anyways, I stopped worrying over spilled milk, and silently waited for Shael to continue speaking.\n“You don’t need anything like this.”\n“I don’t know what you mean.”\n“So…”\n‘Hmmm?’\nAfter clearing her throat several times, Shael continued to say, “You don’t have to use this for our love.”\nI was finally able to understand the meaning behind Shael’s words.\nShe had mistaken that I was trying to use the potion because I wanted her to love me. Therefore, she was conveying— ‘there’s no need to use these things to get my love, don’t worry, I’ll give you enough love anyway.’\n‘That’s absurd…’\nI was being scolded for something I didn’t do…and then she said such a thing with a trembling voice and bright red cheeks.\nHonestly, it was a very Shael-like thing to do. But that’s why I rather liked this situation quite a lot.\nAnd so, I took her in my embrace and continued to enjoy the moment.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "However, Shael looked up at me as I embraced her, and put her hands on her waist.\n‘There’s still more things to be scolded for?’\nThis time, I felt a more stinging gaze than before. It was to the point where it made me feel a little tense.\n“Follow me.” The shy voice was suddenly gone, and a gloomy voice was heard.\nWith a trembling heart, I gulped and followed Shael.\n* * *\n[Shael’s POV]\nShael scolded Eran for trying to use a strange potion to get her love.\nAnd now, it was time to scold him for another matter. In fact, it was a problem for which she had to scold Eran no matter what!\n‘Gamb1ing.’\nEran seems to be addicted to gamb1ing lately. So Shael wanted to make Eran experience the horrors of gamb1ing.\n“Follow me.”\nInnocent Eran followed Shael without knowing anything.\nShael entered Eran’s room and took out the poker cards she had prepared beforehand. Her strategy was simple—beat Eran, to the point he would feel the despair induced by gamb1ing.\nShael, who had studied poker rigorously, was confident. She, who was previously defeated by Eran while in disguise, didn’t even know the rules of the poker game. She even thought of a contingency plan in case she was defeated by Eran.\nTherefore, Shael was able to confidently say to Eran, “You seem to like gamb1ing. Let’s wager some money and try it.”\n“I don’t know what’s going on…but I guess I’ll do that…”\nShael took out a large sum of money and put it in front of Eran. The amount was a paltry sum to Shael, but not to Eran. If he lost, Eran would surely taste the bitter taste of despair.\n“Let’s get started.”\n“Okay.”\nImagining a future in which Eran with an innocent expression would be brutally defeated, Shael proceeded to play poker with Eran. However, things didn’t go as she had expected. Rather, the situation was heading in the exact opposite direction.\nObviously. Eran should’ve lost, he had to. However, Eran kept winning again and again.\nAnd, it was Shael who kept losing.\n“Do it again.”\n“Okay.”\nShael bet a large sum of money, vowing to use a last-ditch contingency plan if she lost again.\nThe result was obvious.\nIn the end, Shael lost again.\nAnd so, Shael finally decided to make use of the contingency plan she had been saving from the start.\n“It’s my first time playing this game called poker. Let us pretend I haven’t lost so far, and do it again.”\nOf course it was a lie. Because she had practiced it over and over against a maid.\nBut Eran didn’t know that. So it was alright!\nAnd so, Shael was able to hold her head high and looked at Eran in the eye.\nNow that she had activated her plan, she would be able to win back the money Eran had won. Then she’ll be able to play the game again, and again.\nHowever, Eran suddenly opened his mouth so say, “I am also new to poker.”\nThat wasn’t true. Eran had played poker with Shael before, when she was in disguise.\nShael hurriedly refuted Eran’s words, “I heard that you also gamb1ed.”\n“I have gamb1ed, but I haven’t played poker or anything like that.”\nAt Eran’s shocking remark, Shael had no choice but to remain silent. After seeing Eran’s dignified expression, Shael’s silence grew more still.\n‘He…’\n“I am an honest man.”\n‘…is dishonest to his core!’\n* * *\nIn the end, Shael confiscated Eran’s entire fortune.\nThe Baslett family’s finances would come under her control anyway, and Shael didn’t even spend money\nunless it was related to Eran, so it didn’t matter.\nHowever, Shael was still feeling annoyed. She wanted to change Eran, but it seemed to remind him of the fun of gamb1ing instead.\nTherefore, in order to vent her anger, Shael came to the Baslett family’s prison with a lie detector.\nIn fact, it was more out of curiosity than out of anger. Shael had seen that woman flirt with Eran on quite a few occasions, and she was very curious about the matter.\n“What do you want?”\n“I came to find out about what you thinks of Eran.”\nThe quick-witted Clie quickly turned her head around and gave Shael the perfect answer.\n“I really hate the Young Master. I don’t find him attractive in the first place…”\n‘Eran isn’t attractive!?’\nThasssht!\n“Uggh!?”\nClie received a slap in response, causing her cheek to turn red. She then quickly realized her mistake, and spoke to Shael, who was waiting for her answer.\n“Urgh, actually, the Young Master is attractive. Even in social gathering, most of the people think well of the Young master. Of course, being a lowly person, I dare not yearn for Young Master…”\nObviously that was the perfect answer. By mentioning that Eran was attractive, she made up for her earlier mistake and also made it clear that she didn’t like him.\nBut Shael thought differently.\n‘Eran is attractive?’\n‘No! I am the only one allowed to find Eran attractive and have his affection!’\nThhhaaassht!\nWith another slap, Clie’s cheek, which was already red, turned even redder.\nA look of bewilderment appeared in Clie’s eyes. She didn’t know how to deal with the situation, and she failed to grasp exactly what was going through this crazy person’s head.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "[Clie’s POV]\nClie opened her eyes and shuddered.\nIt has been quite a while since she suddenly became healthy. Indicating that there was not much time left for her to live.\n‘I have to quickly find a way.’\nThe cold iron chains and the quiet Baslett prison hampered the thoughts of someone as quick witted as Clie.\nKrrrr-chhh!\nSuddenly, there was a sound of the iron door opening, indicating that someone had entered the prison.\nAs Clie raised her head, the figure of a person came into her view.\nIt wasn’t Eran Baslett, and it wasn’t Shael Azbel either.\n“Seniela?”\nIt was Seniela, the daughter of Count Tedel. She was one of the people Clie had built up a close friendship as a part of her contingency plan. As soon as I saw her, Clie felt hope rise in her heart.\nHouse Tedel mainly specialized in t0rturing all kinds of criminals in the empire.\nIt was clear that Eran had called her to punish Clie. In other words, for Clie, who had a deep friendship with Seniela, it was an opportunity that would never come again.\nIn fact, even if the Baslett family was closer to House Tedel than Clie, she was confident in her chances of negotiating with Seniela. Because Clie had something Eran didn’t have. She was in possession of a certain information vital to House Tedel.\n“Clie, long time no see. Who knew you’d end up here.”\n“Yes. Somehow I ended up being framed…”\nClie carefully looked at Seniela’s expression. Befitting a member of a family specializing in t0rture, even Clie couldn’t easily see through Seniela’s thoughts. Anyways, it was certain that she would be able to receive Seniella’s help unconditionally.\nHowever, things went differently than Clie had thought.\n“Ahh-arrrghhh!”\nShe was assaulted with an excruciatingly painful sensation, but there was no abnormality with her body at all. It was an ingenious magic for t0rture that would leave no external evidence.\nIf it wasn’t for the fact that the person suffering was Clie herself, she would have clapped in admiration.\n“Why are you doin…aarrhghhh!”\nClie couldn’t even finish her words, as even more painful sensation flooded her mind, and she immediately realized something was wrong. Because she could feel genuine malice in Seniela’s actions.\nTherefore, Clie decided to use the last resort.\n“I finally got information on a cure for you brother’s illness!”\n“You make me laugh. It must be another poison, not a cure.” Seniela continued, “To make us keep feeding my younger brother poison and offer to find a cure for him who wasn’t sick in the first place, all to make use of the Tedel family.”\n“…..”\n“Don’t you have anything to say?”\nClie kept her mouth shut, and refused to respond.\n‘Did she find out about the poison? There’s absolutely no way she could. They wouldn’t be able to detect it even if they invited the best doctor in the empire.’\nBut Seniela’s expression seemed to mean that she was confident in her claim.\n‘Then how did she know?’\nClie couldn’t find an answer to that question. Because Seniela’s t0rture continued, until the moment she fainted.\n***\nClie struggled to opened her eyes, and she was greeted with the cold silence of the prison.\nPreviously, she hated the silence, but not anymore. Clie felt relieved at the fact that she would no longer have to feel that pain, and let out a sigh of relief.\n‘Now I’ll be able to rest for at least a day.’\nHowever, once again, things didn’t go the way Clie had thought.\nSomeone entered the Baslett family’s prison again.\nClie stopped the tears she was shedding in misery and raised her head.\nThe person who entered the prison this time was another familiar person. Similar to Seniela, they had become aware of the truth. As a result, they didn’t help Clie, they just vented their anger and left.\nThere was a son of a promising merchant, a commoner with a low status but with great wealth, and other members of aristocratic families Clie was trying to build friendships with.\nAll of them entered the Baslett family’s prison, and t0rmented Clie. No matter how many times she begged, no matter how much she tried to offer, nothing changed.\nThe tower of lies Clie had built was collapsing in on herself.\nKrrrr-chhh!\nSomeone entered the Baslett family prison yet again.\nClie trembled, her mind at the brink of destruction.\n‘Who is it? Who will it be this time?’\nShe couldn’t even imagine who could it be. There were many who held a grudge against Clie. Her sins were numerous and vile.\nEven so, she couldn’t undo her deeds. It was already too late for that, and she would have to experience the punishment.\nFinally, the footsteps came closer.\nClie slightly raised her head, but that was enough to identify who the person was.\nTherefore, Clie just kept her gaze fixed on the floor.\n“That’s right, you shouldn’t have messed with me and Shael.”\nIt was the voice of Eran Baslett.\nThe voice she hated the most pierced Clie’s ear.\n***\n[Eran’s POV]\nI found a list in the Crown Prince’s room, and was amazed by what I learned from the list.\nEven if Clie had a formidable talent for socializing, this was an absurd number.\nUsually, people from proud aristocratic families wouldn’t even meet Clie. So obviously something was wrong.\nAs a reader of the original novel, I was able to find the reason quite easily.\nClie had used their weaknesses to build those friendships. She used the people in need of something, and harmed people who were in good health for her own benefit. Those were things you shouldn’t do as a human being.\nClie was treating them as her tools.\nAnyways, thanks to that list, I was able to destroy Clie even more brutally.\n“That’s right, you shouldn’t have messed with me and Shael.”\nClie remained silent.\nNo, she was forced to remain silent.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "She wasn’t able to speak properly due to the agony, and the only thing the current Clie could do was frown.\nRecalling what she did to me in the past timelines, I turned around and nodded to Seniela Tedel, who also had a grudge against Clie.\nIt was time to end it.\nBut I didn’t want to get my hands dirty. It wasn’t that I was feeling reluctant, I just wanted to spend more time with Shael today.\nHonestly, it was a pity to send Clie off like this. There were many people who held a grudge towards Clie, and their resentment wouldn’t end in a short time.\nBut I couldn’t help it. Clie’s body was at its limit, suffering from all sorts of t0rment.\nSeniela, noticing my signal, approached Clie.\nAnd finally, the one thing that haunted me and Shael disappeared from the world.\nThe fight had finally come to an end.\n* * *\nAfter finishing the work, I headed to the Azbel Estate.\nI had sent Shael to the Azbel family in case she entered the prison again.\nHowever, I ran into someone right in front of the Azbel mansion.\n“What are you doing here?”\nThe woman I ran into was the money bag who I had robbed of money at the b1ack market. She was also the woman who had left a strong impression on my memories.\n‘Why did this woman come to the Azbel family?’\nShael had once showed me a picture of this woman.\n‘Could it be that this woman was someone she knew?’\nThen I needed to kick the woman out. Because I couldn’t let such a strange woman stay close to Shael.\n“So you still remember me?”\n“Yes. Should I say that I remember you as a b1tch, a woman with no ethics.”\nThe money bag glared at me.\nYes, I was the first to insult her, but I didn’t feel that bad about it. The woman had tried to cheat in gambling, and then b1ackmailed me with the items I wanted to buy on the b1ack market.\nThe woman had a really nasty personality, and no moral principles, so the insult was well deserved.\nOf course I did something bad as well. I had stolen the things she had bought from the b1ack market. However, the woman had haphazardly bought those item to quarrel with me in the first place, so I didn’t feel guilty at all.\nAfter staying quite for a moment, the woman spoke up, “I am close friends with Shael.”\n“Friends?”\n“I have to tell Shael all the weird things you did.” Said the woman, nodding her head.\nThen the woman’s attire caught my eye. It was indeed a luxurious attire. I couldn’t see the woman’s face, but she was probably a member of a nobility. It wouldn’t be strange at all to say that she and Shael were friends. But I still didn’t believe the woman’s words.\n“Isn’t that funny? My Shael has no friends at all.”\n“…..”\n“She has a bit of a bad personality. Who would have any friends with that personality?”\nIt was true. There was no way Shael had friends. Of course there won’t be any in the future as well.\n“So, you think Shael has a bad personality?”\n“Yes.”\nOf course, her personality had improved compared to the past. But even now, she did some bad things from time to time.\nNot to me though.\nAnyone would evaluate her as someone having a bad personality. Even Duke Jespen, her father couldn’t say that Shael’s personality was good.\n“So why don’t you leave? You better not come to Azbel family again.”\n“Haaahh…”\nThe woman did not answer me and sighed. Then she began to caress something in her pocket.\n‘Magic? No, she’s deactivating a magic tool.’\nThis money bag was by no means an ordinary woman, so there was a chance that she could use offensive magic tools against me.\nI unfolded all sorts of situations in my head, and remained vigilant just in case.\nPuong!\nHowever, something unexpected happened. When the woman deactivated the magic tool, her appearance began to change with a sound.\n“Eh…”\n“You say I have a bad personality?”\nI heard a familiar voice. It was the voice of Shael who was with me every day.\nThe money bag was Shael? The woman I was swearing at just before was Shael?\nIt was a completely unexpected situation. So I froze in place and remained silent.\n“Because I have a bad personality, I have no friends?”\n“Actually, it’s not because you have a bad personality, but because you don’t like building friendships with others.”I squeezed all my strength and managed to spit out the answer.\n“Hmm.”\nShael seemed to agree. But that was only for a moment.\n“I am a b1tch, a woman with no ethics?”\nThe fortunate thing was that Shael had a smile on her face. It was clear that Shael wanted to make fun of me.\nThanks to that, I was able to relax.\n“I think…a woman with ethics wouldn’t fight her fiance.”\nShael touched my arm and asked, “Is that so?”\nHowever, I only realized my mistake after checking Shael’s gaze, as I could feel Shael’s stern gaze.\n‘Sh1t!’\nI was too careless. My mind was currently in a state of exhaustion from wandering around the Baslett family’s prison all day today. That’s why I said something without thinking properly, and spit out my inner thoughts without realizing it.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Shael blinked her eyes, and frowned as if she was doubting her ears.\nIt was the same for me. I didn’t even know that my mouth could be so bold.\n‘Of course, it’s true that you’d be considered without ethics if you behaved in a rude manner towards your fiance…’\nBut, the problem was that I had said it outloud. Therefore, I tried to salvage the situation while avoiding Shael’s intense gaze.\n“By the way, it seems like I haven’t made dessert lately. Would you like to have some desserts?”\nIf it was the usual, Shael would have nodded immediately at the very mention of desserts.\nHowever, the current Shael did not react at all; far from reacting to me, she even intensified the gaze that was\nglaring at me, and also pouted out her mouth.\n‘She looks like she’s really p1ssed off. How do I get myself out of this?’\nI couldn’t think of a good way, and the she was staring at me, it seemed that Shael was really upset.\nI mean it made sense. She just heard her fiancée say that she woman with ethics. To be honest, even if I was beaten to death, I wouldn’t have anything to say in return.\n‘Anyway, I’ll have to deal with this no matter what.’\nOf course, Shael’s anger would be relieved with time. But I didn’t want to wait for that long. It would be okay to apologize, but it was clear to me that Shael would keep it in her heart. So I needed a way to resolve the matter once and for all.\n‘Is there any way?’\nI thought as I turned around and followed Shael, who was walking toward her own room.\nAt that moment, a pair of objects flashed into my mind. The item I had given to Shael when we went to the Holy Empire’s Blessing Meeting.\nIt wasn’t the right time, but I did give one of the rings to Shael before, we just hadn’t put them on yet.\nMine was in my magic pouch, and Shael’s was supposed to be in her room.\n‘I have to make the plan work, and I want to tell her at the right time.’\nThe proposal.\nI think I will be able to convey my feelings that I couldn’t convey in the past. And so, I went into Shael’s room, planning under what circumstances I would convey my feelings.\nAs expected, the ring I gave her was placed in her room. Shael’s room was the safest place in the Azbel family, and all sorts of magic circle was protecting the ring.\n“What do you want to do now?”\nShael turned her head away and ignored my words.\n‘Is she angry enough to ignore my words even after all this time has passed?’\nI felt strange for some reason, but that wasn’t important. I needed to get Shael out of the room for the plan to work. If that doesn’t work, I had to somehow steal Shael’s ring.\nI heard that such things tended to be more effective in an anxious atmosphere. So the first step in my plan was to steal Shael’s ring. Next, when Shael would be struggling to find the ring, I will properly put it on her finger and convey my feelings.\nHowever, getting Shael out of her room was a problem. Since she was ignoring my words, the normally easy matter had become more difficult.\nOf course, I knew Shael well. So I knew the proper way to get Shael out of her room.\nDrrrrrt!\nIt was the sound of me getting up from my seat. After standing up, I headed for the door, causing Shael to tilt her head as if she had forgotten how angry she was.\nDrrrrrt!\n“…..”\nThen Shael too got up from her seat without a word.\nShe got angry and acted as if she would never speak with me again, and as soon as I got up, she followed me.\nIt was an attitude that made me laugh.\nEven as she followed me, I felt that Shael’s puffy cheeks were cute. She was behaving exactly the way I had expected.\nAnyway, things were going well for me. I went to the garden, and Shael followed me there as well.\nAfter coming to the garden, I walked all over the place to make Shael tired, then sat down on a bench, and I closed my eyes. I passed the time pretending to be asleep, naturally ignoring Shael, who was sitting next to me.\nThen I felt a sudden weight on my shoulder. Turning my head, I found Shael leaning on me, apparently sleep.\n‘Heh… she’s sleeping on my shoulder while she’s supposed to be angry?’\nAnyways, it was good for me, so it didn’t matter..\nGently leaving Shael on the bench, I got up from my seat. Then I stroked the sleeping Shael’s head once and headed to her room.\nAs soon as I entered the room, I approached the ring that Shael had kept there.\nThe ring was protected by all sorts of magic, but it wouldn’t work on me.\nThere was no way Shael’s magic could harm me. I knew her magic well, and in the first place, Shael’s magic skills were worse than mine.\n‘It’s done.’\nAfter putting Shael’s ring in my magic pouch, I headed to the bench where Shael was asleep.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Then I woke Shael up and went back to her room together.\nKikiiik!\nAs soon as you open Shael’s room, you would see the ring. So, no matter how ignorant she was, Shael would be able to notice the absence of the ring.\nHowever, Shael’s reaction was different from what I thought. She was completely oblivious to the fact that her ring was gone.\n‘Is she acting? I bet she didn’t notice that I stole the ring.’\nAnyway, it was obvious what I had to do.\n“I don’t see the ring that was always on your desk.”\n“Really?”\nShael confirmed that the ring was missing. After that, she started walking around the room as if trying to find the ring.\n‘She doesn’t look as anxious, but I’ll have to make do with that…’\nI couldn’t do anything else about it, because there was no way to cancel the plan anymore. I just caressed the ring that I had taken out of my magic pouch, hoping that Shael would be satisfied with my feelings.\nAnd, the moment Shael seemed tired of looking for the ring. I took out the ring and said to Shael.\n“I found the ring. Looks like it fell in the corner…”\nShael just stood in front of me, as if she was waiting for me to say something more.\nI wanted to say the words I have in my head, but I couldn’t.\n‘She knew that I stole the ring.’\nShael didn’t even seem angry anymore, so it seemed like all of this was a part of her plan.\nI erased the words I was going to say for the sake of naturalness, and changed my posture, determined to convey my feelings directly to Shael, who was waiting for me.\nKneeling on my left knee, I raised my head to look at Shael.\nIt was the first time in my life that I had done it. Even so, it didn’t feel strange.\nWith a weak smile on my face, I said as I held Shael’s left hand with my hand.\n“Somehow, it seems a little late.”\nIndeed, I had made Shael wait for quite a long time. I wanted to do it after I ended all that matters with Clie. But today was as good a day as any.\nCome to think of it, I should’ve done it sooner rather than waiting for the right situation to propose, as Shael has always been waiting for me to express my feelings.\nAnd now, I couldn’t even create the right situation for the marriage proposal like I wanted. Still, I was determined to finish it properly. There was no need for words full of rhetoric.\nI put the ring on Shael’s ring finger and opened my mouth.\n“Let’s get married.”\nI just used direct words that contained my sincerity.\nShael gave a satisfied smile.\nI was worried that it might have sounded a bit too simple, but the expression on Shael’s face eased my heart.\nLaughing, the corners of Shael’s mouth suddenly parted, as she struggled to create a beautiful smile.\nAfter repeating it several times, Shael pursed her lips to say something to me who was waiting for her response.\n“Of course. Did you mean not to?”\n“…..”\nI was a bit taken aback by Shael’s unexpected response.\nCrying with a very happy heart, or accepting the marriage proposal with a wide smile…wasn’t that usually the case?\nI couldn’t help but be at a loss for words at the confident, calm, yet shameless appearance of Shael.\n“I did, always…”\n“Then come. I will tell my parents.”\n‘Don’t you have anything else to say?’\nShael cut off my thought and asked me to follow her.\nFor some unknown reason, I felt quite sad. It reminded me of the villainess from the past who always ignored my opinion. The villainess who always ignored me and always got ahead of me when we walked together.\nI frowned as I recalled that bleak past.\nHowever, it wasn’t long before I got back my smile.\n‘The back of her neck is red…’\nBecause I noticed that the back of Shael’s neck was more red than usual as she headed towards Duke Jespen’s room.\n“Come quickly!”\nLooking back at it now, Shael had urged me to follow and calmly walked forward, but she always matched my pace.\nI realized that when I noticed that Shael’s stride length was shortening. I could see her hands trembling, and I could see her body stiffening up.\nAs soon as I realized that, I understood why she had suddenly turned around and started walking. It must be because she didn’t want show me her reddened cheeks.\nIt wasn’t that she was ignoring me, it was because she couldn’t think properly due to the shame.\nA happy smile appeared on my face, as I followed her at a reasonable distance.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Just before reaching Duke Jespen’s room, Shael’s face gradually regained its usual color.\nI sped up and caught up with Shael, who was ahead of me, and grabbed her hand.\n“Let’s go together. There’s nothing wrong with going together.”\n“Yes, yes.”\nIt was silence after that. The long hallway of the Azbel family mansion was dominated by nothing but silence.\n‘What should I do?’\n‘How can I lift her mood?’\nIt was hard for me come up with a solution.\nI shifted my gaze to Shael and looked at her pouting lips.\n‘Wah…this is bad…’\nAnd so there was only one thing I could do. I hugged Shael and took her lips. I didn’t know if this will help erase her resentment, but I did it anyways.\nFirst of all, I wanted to k1ss her, and secondly, Shael usually liked it when did. So I had to take a chance.\nBut it seemed that Shael wanted a k1ss more than I thought, as even after several minutes, Shael didn’t try to part her lips.\n‘Is it right that I’m doing this in the hallway?’\nNo one would say anything to Shael and me, but it was still quite embarrassing.\nI felt a bit embarrassed. But Shael, who always blushed and avoided such things, only became bolder at times like this. Anyways, I was able to finish the long and deep k1ss with Shael only after I felt my neck going numb.\nThud!\nAt the same time, I heard the sound of something fall.\nLooking around, I discovered Duke Jespen. It seemed that he had dropped a few magic tools on the ground and had covered both of his eyes.\n“Kuhmm…is it over?”\n“Yes, yes. It’s…done.”\nI felt a tsunami of embarrassment wash over me. I also felt a bit resentful at Shael for not letting go of my lips quickly.\n“Wonderful!”\n“…..”\n“Could it be that all of those 1,203 k1sses were such long k1sses?”\nShael confidently nodded her head.\n‘No, why is she nodding her head for that?’\nIf it wasn’t for Duke Jespen in front of me, I would have given Shael a good flick on the forehead.\n“Wonderful! But I won’t lose. I will work hard with Enella…”\nDuke Jespen, who was looking at his lovely daughter, suddenly stopped his gaze on the ring Shael was wearing, and opened his mouth wide in surprise.\nTherefore, I decided to make things clear.\n“I decided to propose.”\n“I see…”\nDuke Jespen calmly nodded his head, but before long he looked at Shael and me as if he was happy.\nI didn’t even have to say more, because Duke Jaspen was nodding his head in satisfaction.\nIt made sense, considering we were already engaged.\nSince Duke Jespen was aware of Shael’s personality, he must have been waiting for Shael and me to confirm our feelings before things became official. And now, since that wish had finally come true, Duke Jespen must be feeling quite moved.\n“Let me prepare the wedding hall.”\nThose words revealed Duke Jespen’s sincere feelings. He wanted to see his daughter’s marriage in a grand and luxurious place. In addition, it also revealed that he wanted to help his daughter’s marriage as much as possible.\nUnfortunately, however, Shael and I couldn’t accept those feelings.\nBecause Shael and I had a place in mind. It was the wedding hall we saw while touring Holy Land.\nAs I was hesitating over how I should bring the matter up, Shael suddenly spoke up, “There is a wedding hall that we have already chosen at the Holy Land.”\nShael was so busy watching me that she didn’t even look at Duke Jespen properly, and said such heartless words.\n‘Isn’t that a bit too heartless?’\nDuke Jespen continued to send an earnest glance at Shael, but there was no way that would work. Therefore he could only give on the wedding hall, spoke again, “The wedding dress! I shall prepare a very pretty dress!”\nWe had bought a wedding dress at the dressing room we went to before. So, unfortunately, even the dress was already decided.\nDuke Jespen was quite desperate to do something for his daughter, but then he noticed the meaning in my gaze.\n“Eh…even the dress is already decided?”\nDuke Jespen shook his head as if he was speechless, and remarked, “I underestimated the preparedness of the Empire’s greatest pair of lovers, boasting 1,203 k1sses…”\nDuke Jespen seemed quite dispirited at the reality.\nEven then, he smiled happily at the news of Shael’s marriage, but he felt depressed again because there was nothing he could do to contribute.\nAnd so, the doting father continued to repeat that expression for several moments.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

She just blushed and turned her head away.\nAs I continued to stare at her like that, Shael let out a sigh, and glared at me again. She seemed to be feeling extremely shy, and wanted me so stop staring at her.\nOf course, there was no way I would listen to her, and tired to counter Shael’s glare with a strange proverb.\n“There is a saying that married couples are of one mind.”\n“What are you saying all of a sudden?”\n“So after all, I am yours and you are mine. There’s no harm if I just stare at you, right?”\nShael, who couldn’t bear to refute, approached me. Then she stretched her hand to pinch at my cheek.\n“Can I pinch my husbands cheek like this?”\n“You can.”\n“…..”\nI wanted the relationship between us as a married couple to be more comfortable than that.\nAnyways, I noticed Shael’s thoughtful expression when I brought up the proverb. However, that thoughtful expression changed the next instant. It seemed that she was planning something.\n“Then you shouldn’t gamb1e, right?”\n“I don’t understand why you suddenly brought up the matter of gamb1ing.”\nObviously, Shael wanted to use this logic to make me give up gamb1ing.\nHowever, not matter what she said, I would never stop gamb1ing.\n‘Of course not!’\nWhy? It was because I knew the future.\nThe current timeline had only covered about half of the plot of the original novel. So I would be able to have a huge advantage in gamb1ing.\nFor example, I would be able to guess the winner of any popular tournaments in the empire with the knowledge I had of the future.\nUtilizing that knowledge would be of great help to the Baslett family’s finances, which have been going through tough times lately. I might even be able to help the wealthy Azbel family.\nAs I was lost in my thoughts about gamb1ing, Shael grumbled.\n“You said that married couples are of one mind.”\n“Why are you bringing that up here?”\n“I hate gamb1ing, so you shouldn’t be gamb1ing either.”\nTo be honest, she was right. Still, I couldn’t give in to Shael’s words. I had to gamb1e, and I also wanted to annoy Shael.\n“Then I should be able to gamb1e to my heart’s content for a while.”\n“Why?”\n“It’s because we aren’t married yet.”\nRealizing that fact, Shael hardened her face.\n“So far, you’ve been using the word marriage a lot…”\nI watched Shael’s expression change in real time, and laughed.\nShael looked at me and said, “If we really become a married couple, you should prepare yourself.”\n“Hmmm, prepare myself? What do you mean?”\nShael followed up with some scary words, “There is a proverb that says that couples do not stop fighting.”\n“…..”\nI imagined that future in my head—I was teasing Shael, but in the end, I was getting scolded by her .\n“However, there is a saying that a fight between married couples is similar to cutting water with a knife.”\n“Really?” Shael, who was watching me with a smile, opened her mouth, “Then will it be safe even if I cut it as hard as I can with a sword?”\n‘Wait. Is that really true?’\nI felt a cold sweat run down my back at Shael’s ominous words.\nOf course, Shael must be saying that as a joke.\nFor some reason, it seemed to me that my future would be like being held captive by Shael. However, that future made me happy.\nWhatever future it was, I’d be able to enjoy it as long as I was with Shael.\nAnd now, that future was not far away.\nThinking about the future made me smile in genuine happiness.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "In the end, I was the one who was defeated by Shael.\nI had no choice but to make a promise not to touch anything related to gamb1ing from now on.\n‘It’s a pity that I missed out on making a fortune.’\nSince Shael hated it so much, I couldn’t help it.\nI was worried about the Baslett family’s finances, but fortunately, Shael said that the Azbel family would provide support to the family little by little.\n‘Then, all that’s left is to tell the Barslett family about this directly.’\nFinally, I came out of the Azbel family mansion with Shael, still full of joy and happiness.\nOur next destination was Baslett Estate.\n* * *\nThe Baslett family had a completely different atmosphere from the Azbel family.\nUnlike the Azbel family, who were making a ruckus about the news of our marriage, the Baslett family was silent.\nFrom the beginning, the people of the Baslett family, who were obsessed with the way of the sword, was like that, but today the silence was particularly severe.\nAnd, I understood the reason why as soon as I met the butler.\n“Young Lord! You are finally here!”\n“Why is the atmosphere like this?”\n“The lord is ill. He coughed up blood a little while ago while watching over the swordsmanship of one of the knights.”\nI had seen Duke Ezran coughing up blood before. At the time, I thought it was due to the restriction placed on him to prevent the leakage of secrets…but now it seemed that it wasn’t the case at all!\n‘I have to do something about it.’\nAs I was lost in my thoughts, I heard the butler’s words.\n“I couldn’t deliver the news quickly because the family lord told me not to do so.”\n“From now on, just tell me right away.”\nAfter talking with the butler, I headed to the room where Duke Ezran was resting.\n“It will be fine. There are many excellent medicinal herbs in the Azbel family.”\nShael tried to comfort me as she looked at me to check if I was feeling down.\nMy heart, which was anxious, suddenly calmed down from Shael’s actions.\nIt wasn’t long before I saw Duke Ezran’s room.\nI knocked on the door with tension in my body.\nKnock! Knock! Knock!\nDuke Ezran gave permission to come into the room.\nKikiiik!\nI opened the door.\nAt the same time, my eyes fell on Duke Ezran.\nHis condition was worse than I thought. His forehead was dripping with cold sweat, his arms were shaking as if it were cold, and his eyes were half-closed from exhaustion.\nThere was no change in his expression, but his body was expressing his condition.\n“Ahh, are you okay?”\n“I’m just tired from practicing swordsmanship.”\nHe was lying. His condition was too severe to be called tired due to intense training.\nThere was a reason why the butler had an anxious expression on his face.\n“If you don’t have anything more to say, then get out.”\nAs soon as I heard Duke Ezran’s words, I began to worry even more.\n‘Would it be correct to ask some questions here?’\nI could make the situation worse by asking something rashly. Duke Ezran had vomited blood while trying to reveal something to me about my memories of the past timeline. So, I decided to tell him the news about Shael and me.\nI had sent a letter in advance, but he probably wasn’t able to check it due to his condition.\nTherefore, I said while holding the hand of Shael, who was standing still next to me.\n“I decided to marry Shael.”\nDuke Ezran turned to look at us, his eyes struggled to express his emotions.\n“It took you long enough. Congratulations nonetheless. Hurry up and inform the rest of the Baslett family of this news.”\nNodding his head, Duke Ezran closed his eyes again, clearly exhausted from the fatigue.\nYes, I will make sure to ask him once I solve the problem.\nKikiiik!\nIt was then that someone opened the door and entered the room.\n‘He came in without knocking?’\nThere was no way something like that would happen unless it was very urgent. However, the huge variety of medicines the person was carrying showed the seriousness of the situation.\n“Hhh…Young Lord?”\n“Is my father’s condition serious? I want you to tell me the situation too.”\n“That’s actually…”\nThe physician turned to look at Duke Ezran, who was already asleep.\nHis breathing was regular.\nThen physician lowered his voice and said, “Milord is suffering from an unknown and incurable disease. His condition is quite severe…”\nIf even a physician from a ducal house didn’t know about the disease, then it could be regarded as a disease that no one in the empire would know about as well.\nThe physician and Shael must have known that, and their expressions turned gloomy.\nAs we were lost in the gloom, the sudden voice of Duke Ezran was heard.\n“What does it matter? Eran will have to take over everything anyway. So it shouldn’t pose a problem at all.”\n“Milord…”\nThe physician approached my father with medicine in an attempt to save him somehow.\nHowever, Duke Ezran shook his head as if it was unnecessary. Then he asked everyone to leave the room except for me.\n“First of all, congratulations on your marriage to Shael. It’s just a pity that I don’t have much time left.”\nDuke Ezran kept his expression calm even as he spoke such sorrowful words, like he usually did.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "However, I actually had the means to cure Duke Ezran.\nDespite that, a feeling of sadness flooded my heart, and a sorrowful expression appeared on my face. The reason for that was Duke Ezran’s expression, which seemed unnaturally calm even in such a dire situation.\n“There should be a way to cure the disease…”\n“No, further attempts are pointless. I looked for a cure in various places in the world, but found nothing.”\nDuke Ezran cut off my words, then he thought of something and fell into agony.\n‘There really is a way to cure the disease.’\nLooking at it now, Duke Ezran also had an erratic side to him.\nBefore I could say anything more, he spoke up again.\n“Recently, a report came in that the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince has disappeared.”\nI had no choice but to remain silent in response, because I was the one responsible for their disappearance.\n“In the past…no, they had disappeared like that once before.”\nIt was quite easy to understand what he wanted to convey. He was talking about the timeline in which I died from poison and Shael and Duke Ezran suffered a lot. But that past was now gone.\n“You never know what they will do, so you’d better be careful.”\nAs soon as he finished speaking, Duke Ezran coughed several times, and spit up b1ood.\n‘As I thought…’\nDuke Ezran’s illness was getting worse every time he recalled the events of the past timeline.\nDiscarding my thoughts about the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince, I first reached into my clothes and took out my magic pouch. Inside the magic pouch was a pair of earring. It was the earrings Shael bought with the intention of curing me.\nThe earrings had the ability to cure all the ailments, and it was the same magic tool Clie had been searching for in the past.\nIn other words, these earrings were the only thing that could completely cure Duke Ezran’s illness.\nI approached Duke Ezran and put the earrings on his forehead.\nThe earrings gave off a red glow, and with that, the disease that had been eating away at Duke Ezran should have been cured.\nIt was only then that I was able to ponder what Duke Ezran had said just now.\n‘The Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince had also disappeared in the past timeline?’\nIt was an intriguing information. The reason they had disappeared in the present was because I gave\nthem the love potion.\n‘Then what exactly happen in the past timeline?’\nA terrifying assumption came to my mind.\n‘Could it be that they disappeared in the past timeline for similar reasons?’\nI shook my head, thinking that it was absurd, but the rationale for that assumption kept popping up in my head.\nClie could have lived a happy life if she chose between the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince, but she still returned to the past using the Bracelet of Holy Power.\nAfter returning, she began to hate the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince quite openly.\nIn fact, there were many instances in the original novel that showcased the ambiguity in the relationship between the Mage Tower Lord and the Crown Prince.\nAt first, I didn’t think it was a big deal, thinking that it was a troupe that targeted a certain type of readers.\nActually, there were many readers who insulted the author for adding certain things in the original novel, but there were also many readers who responded positively through comments.\nI still remembered many of such comments I had seen in the comment section.\n[Well that was a quite…unexpected. I for one support how it ended. Don’t read it if you don’t like it. It’s just pathetic to insult the author for his writing.]\nCome to think of it, as the comment said, there were a lot of comments criticizing the author for disguising the novel as a different genre.\n[I say that it’s the reader’s fault for not reading the novel properly…lol! You can say that the male protagonists end up mutually helping each other in the end, so it’s absolutely not a misunderstanding. Isn’t it great that those bad-tempered male protagonists end up working together?]\n‘There was something strange about those comments for sure…’\n[Hey guys! Let’s not spoil it for the other! It’s a nuisance to readers who haven’t seen it yet. Let me tell you, this is a perfect novel to the end, and it’s a very good novel with gag elements, so you can read with confidence!]\n‘But why does the back of my head tingle?’\nI even thought that it was rather fortunate that I transmigrated without being able to read the novel to the end.\nAnd, I even felt that Clie was quite pitiful for experiencing such misfortune.\nHowever, I still didn’t regret ending Clie’s life.\nThere were so many things that Clie did wrong. She didn’t just target me and Shael, but also harmed Seniela of the Tedel family, who almost lost her little sister due to Clie’s plans. There was also that merchant who almost lost his entire fortune.\nBesides them, Clie harmed numerous noble families and commoners for her own benefit. So there was nothing to regret.\n‘Still, she’s quite pitiful indeed.’\nI pressed my throbbing head and erased those thoughts.\nLooking ahead, I saw Duke Ezran, who had shaken off his visibly fatigued body.\nIt meant that the earrings had successfully cured his illness.\nNow, it was my turn to ask about the events of the past that I was unaware of in more detail.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "Duke Ezran’s eyes widened.\nIt made sense. His body, which was sore and tired just a while ago, was suddenly full of energy.\nJust looking at his appearance, you could tell Duke Ezran’s condition was getting better by the second. There was no way Duke Ezran didn’t know that.\n“I don’t understand…how can this happened.”\n“Didn’t I try to tell you? There is a way to cure it.”\nI fixed my eyes on the earrings I had given to Duke Ezran.\nDuke Ezran, noticing my gaze, touched the earrings.\n“Those earrings can cure any disease.”\nThe notion itself seemed absurd, but Duke Ezran, who had already experienced the effect, nodded and accepted my words.\nAfter taking a deep breath, I asked him, “I want to know how you got sick and why.”\nI had roughly guessed the truth. It was clear that it was due to the contract he had made with the Demon King.\nBut I didn’t want to stop there. I wanted to hear more details.\nIf the disease was a shackle that prevented him from talking about the past timeline, he should be able to speak freely now that the disease had been cured.\nDuke Ezran stayed silent for a moment, then said, “As you might have guessed, I had made a deal with the Demon King. In order to make things ‘interesting’ he gave me an incurable disease that eats away at life, and gets worse every time I bring up matters of the past and try to help you.”\nDuke Ezran put his hand near his heart, as if he was checking his own body condition.\nOriginally, he would have felt something wrong with his body because he directly brought up the matter of the deal, but now that his illness had been cured, and his body was fine.\nBefore long, Duke Ezran opened his mouth again, “That’s why I couldn’t do anything until now. My body used to grow weak when I said something that was related to the deal or did something to help you.”\nNow that I think about it, Duke Ezran had never helped me no matter how dire the situation was. However, he would always drawn himself in Baslet family’s work so that I could have spend time with Shael.\n‘So that’s the only way he could help…’\nWhile I was living a happy life with Shael, Duke Ezran continued to work while fighting his illness.\nI bit my lip, barely keeping myself calm. It was not the right time to express those feelings. I had to wait at least until I heard all of Duke Ezran’s story.\n“I would like to hear more about the deal with that Demon King.”\nDuke Ezran, again remained silent for a moment, then opened his mouth.\n“A lot of things were sacrificed. I don’t want to go into detail.”\nI had no choice but to be silent.\nEven when the constraints were lifted, I knew why Duke Ezran refrained from talking about the matter.\n‘It must be because of me.’\nSince it was a deal to revive a person, many things must have been sacrificed in the transaction. It was clear that he was reluctant to talk because he was worried that I would blame myself for it.\nActually, I didn’t even have to ask. Because I already knew about what had been lost due to the deal.\nDuke Ezran had lost his Aura. Not only that, unlike the memories I had experienced after destroying the bracelet, the current Duke Ezran seemed a bit too cold and emotionless. It was a situation that could only be explained by the notion that he had lost his ability to ‘feel’.\nIn addition, Daria Baslett, who was my mother, was absent.\nThat too must have happened because of me.\nAfter thinking about that, I couldn’t raise my head properly in front of Duke Ezran. He had sacrificed everything for me and endured immense pain.\nEven so, I felt awkward in front of him and avoided the matter, so it was difficult to give him a dignified look.\n“I am…sorry.”\nAll I could do was sincerely apologize to Duke Ezran, who had lost everything because of me.\nDuke Ezran still looked at me without showing any emotion.\nMy heart ached as if it was being torn apart. That said, I didn’t want to end it in an awkward way.\n“There is one thing I don’t understand. Can you please explain?”\nDuke Ezran didn’t answer my words. But it wasn’t that he was ignoring it, as he nodded his head in response and opened the drawer next to the bed.\nWhat Duke Ezran took out was a teacup with an antique and unique pattern and a photo.\nThe picture was painted with my favorite place, the garden, where I spend my time with Shael.\nIn the picture, Duchess Daria and Duke Ezran were drinking tea with a smile on their faces.\nDuke Ezran glanced at the photo and looked at me, “You should be familiar with her.”\n“Eh…”\nWhen I checked the picture he took out, all the doubts in my heart turned to conviction, and I remembered the time before I came to this world, and the face of my aunt who had raised me appeared in my mind.\nThen I moved my eyes to the teacup that Duke Ezran had taken out.\nIt was teacup with a familiar design. I had seen teacups with similar designs in my previous world.\nThe Baslett family had several types of tea even though no one liked it. They were the kinds of tea I had been drinking all the time even before I came to this world.\nThen, there was the garden, which had been beautifully maintained and rarely visited by people. It also had a similar shape to the one I had in my memories.\nEven though I didn’t like gardening very much, it was still my favorite place to spend time.\nIn the picture, Daria Baslett was sitting in the garden, and she was drinking her tea in a position familiar to me, with her left hand resting on her chin.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "They were similar to my aunt’s habits.\nAfter finishing all these thoughts, I looked at Duke Ezran in cold sweat. I wondered if my doubts, which were now turning into certainties, were actually correct, and if so, what the hell happened.\nI wanted Duke Ezran to validate my conjectures.\n“You are right.”\nDuke Ezran, who saw through my thoughts, spoke mechanically, while awkwardly raising the corner of his mouth.\n“So there is no need to be sorry.”\n“Transmigration…”\n“That was what Daria also wanted.”\nI was speechless. It was partly because of the complicated and unbelievable situation, and partly because of the sad feeling spreading through my heart.\n‘So, the aunt who raised me was the woman called Daria Baslet in this world?’\nIt was a heartbreaking fact.\nAt the same time, I felt sorry for Duke Ezran. It meant that when Duke Ezran was leading a miserable life, I had been living a terribly happy life.\nWhen I struggled to open my mouth, Duke Ezran who spoke first.\n“If you’re going to be sorry, you’d better make it up to Shael. Shael must have suffered more than anyone else.”\n“I see…”\nI had already made that decision I before, but I further solidified my decision to make Shael happy forever.\nWhat I felt as I made my decision was an infinitely complex emotion.\nDuke Ezran waited for me without a word.\nI quickly made up my mind and tried to keep my composure. It was useless to express my feelings. Rather, it would be good for Duke Ezran to quickly recover and talk.\nAfter taking a few deep breaths, I was able to ask him more.\n“Why did the Demon King agree to make such a deal.”\nI couldn’t help but wonder.\nThe deal that Duke Ezran made with the Demon King was quite confusing. It was saving someone’s life, and taking important things in return. However, in that transaction, there was nothing that would benefit the Demon King. It was just a transaction full of conditions that would make Duke Ezran suffer.\nThe answer was simple.\n“To make people suffer. It’s what the demons usually want and go crazy to get.”\n“Suffering…”\n“Of course, there is no need to blame them. Rather, I am grateful that he accepted the deal.”\nThen Duke Ezran pondered something more before continuing.\n“And I didn’t understand it properly, but he said that he wrote novels as a hobby”\n“Novel…?”\n“I heard that he would write a novel for women. I don’t know what nonsense he was talking about, but he said that it would make a lot of people suffer in the end.”\nIt was a complicated matter, conscious of that fact, Duke Ezran added, “He said that it he would enjoy it a lot, so he accepted my deal, even if it seemed like he would suffer losses.”\nThat was a rather interesting thing to say, and it was also quite amusing.\nA Demon King, a being who liked to make people suffer, wrote novels for others to read.\n‘Wait…’\nSuddenly, I was hit by a notion and thought about the original novel.\n‘How was the ending of the original novel?’\nI didn’t get to read it. However, through the conversation with Duke Ezran, I was able to guess that the ending was certainly not a good one.\nEven before I had this conversation with Duke Ezran, I realized some of it while thinking about the comments from the earlier chapters in the novel.\n‘So, does that mean the novel was written by the Demon King aimed at women?’\nThen, the possibility became even greater. Since he said that he liked to make people suffer, then suddenly changing the ending in an unexpected manner would make more sense.\nThen, one more terrible assumption came to my mind.\nBefore I came to this world, I liked to read a lot. Naturally, I had read many webnovels during that time.\nThere was no guarantee that all stories would be perfect. There were many novels that stopped serialization, and there were novels that suddenly changed genres.\nWhat kind of comments did they receive?\n[You ba*tard writer, suddenly changing the genre and turning it into a sh1tshow…let’s see who reads your next work hahahaha!]\nThe interesting thing was that their popularity wouldn’t decrease even after all the backlash.\nI remembered another comment about a novel that started as a pure love genre, but changed nearing the end.\n[No, why does the female lead abandon the male lead and get together with another man? If that’s the case, why did you put the pure love tag? Why does it have the harem and pure love tags together?]\nThere were quite a few novels that were criticized for having strange developments at unexpected points of the story. However, strangely, some of those works boasted undiminished popularity.\nIf what I thought was correct, the original novel must have been of the same type, where proper information remained hidden due to the comment section in the first chapter being already flooded with overwhelming troll comments.\nThat’s why it was very popular. If the ending of the original novel really changed, many readers would have suffered.\n‘But what if it’s the work of the Demon King?’\nHe must have enjoyed making so many people suffer.

      "content": "The Azbel family and the Baslett family were busy preparing for the wedding.\nEven though there are still a few days left before the ceremony, the family tried their best to make the wedding as grand as possible.\nFor the wedding venue, we decided to use the place I had seen with Shael at the Holy Land. The wedding venue was much larger than I thought, and Shael and I didn’t have a lot of friends we could invite.\nOf course, since wedding invitations were sent to the main members of the families that mainly traded with members of the Azbel and Baslett families, there was no way the wedding would be modest.\nShael and I were just thinking about the future, planning, and waiting for a beautiful marriage.\n“Even though there are still several days left, I am nervous.”\n“I’m not like that at all.”\nThat was Shael’s answer. Contrary to her answer, of course, Shael’s hands were shaking. It was clear that she was also looking forward to marriage as much as me.\n“There is bound to be tension. We will be having a wedding at the wedding hall you saw back then, we also have a very pretty dress.”\nA dress that was commissioned at the dressing room. It was a dress that made me smile and made me feel happy just by looking at it.\nIf Shael wore that dress, it would put a tremendous strain on my heart.\n‘I want to see her in that dress right now, but…’\nI somehow endured it. For the happiness of the future that will come slowly but surely.\n“Let’s just get out. Father and Duke Jespen will be waiting for you.”\nDuke Jespen and Duke Ezran would be coming after some time.\nShael and I would soon become a married couple. Therefore, both families were supposed to get together and have a meal together.\nKikiiik!\n“…?”\nShael gave me a questioning gaze. The reason was that she must have felt my attitude was more cautious than usual.\nIn response, I took Shael’s hand and stepped down the stairs of Baslett Mansion.\n“What are you doing?”\nShael asked while holding my hand.\nShe had a valid reason to ask such a question. Because I was acting overprotective, and treating Shael as if she was a treasure.\n‘As I recalled the memories of the past in more detail, so I can’t help but act like this.’\nThe guilt I felt for Shael was what made me do that, and the conversation with Duke Ezran was the trigger.\nDuke Ezran wasn’t the only one who suffered in the timeline where I died.\nShael must have gone through hard adversity too. I couldn’t even fathom how much pain Shael must have felt.\n‘I was the reason she was obsessed over Clie’s Bracelet of Holy Power in the original timeline and tried to take it away…’\nShael, who lost her fiancé and stole the Bracelet of Holy Power from Clie in order to save me. I don’t know how painful and heartbreaking it must have been. Even in the original novel, Shael had a miserable ending.\n‘After fulfilling her wish through the Bracelet of Holy Power, she must have come to a disastrous conclusion soon after.’\nIf I didn’t feel sorry for Shael who did so much for me, that would be ridiculous. So I spoke to Shael, who was still standing on the stairs and glaring at me, with the guilt growing in my heart.\n“What if you accidentally slip on the stairs?”\n“I can walk just fine on my own, so watch out for yourself.”\nShael couldn’t bear to get mad at the person who cared about her, so she grunted and passed me by.\n“It is alright to worry about something, but, don’t do anything weird.”\nThen snapped at me with such a remark.\nI followed her, feeling my love for her grow even more.\nI felt happy just walking down the hallway with Shael.\nTime passed before we knew it, and we arrived at the large dining room in the Baslett Mansion.\nDuke Jespen and Duchess Enella were seated already. It was the same with Duke Ezran.\nI thought it would definitely create an awkward atmosphere. Because Duke Ezran’s personality was quite different from Duke Jespen’s.\nStrangely, however, the atmosphere wasn’t too bad. It was thanks to the friendship between Duke Jespen and Duke Ezran that was stronger than I thought.\n“Ezran, it’s been a while since I saw you, and your complexion seems to be better than before.”\nDuke Jespen said with a grin.\nSince he had been cured of the disease he had been suffering from, Duke Ezran had a brighter complexion than before.\nAnd so, we talked about many things.\nI was able to obtain a lot of information that would help strengthen the relationship between the Azbel family and the Baslett family, which had been close in the first place, and also received advice on how to better the Baslett family’s difficult financial situation.\nSuddenly Duke Jespen mentioned something strange.\n“Actually, something strange happened some time ago. Someone is destroying books in the Azbel library.”\nAnd, Shael, who was eating dessert next to me, started coughing.\n“Is something wrong?”\n“Oh, no…nothing.”\nAfter exchanging some words with Shael, I spoke to Duke Jespen.\n“It must be a big issue. Aren’t there some important books in the Azbel family’s library?”\nDuke Jespen, who tilted his head, said with a frown on his face.\n“Only books related to romance were damaged.”\nFirst of all, I was glad that the important books were safe. But, books related to romance? Why are only those books being damaged?\nIt was difficult to understand, and I didn’t want to understand.\n“I found out today, and it’s the same with the Baslett’s library. Some of the books are torn out as well.”\nDuke Jespen pulled out some books. Most of them were books from the Baslett family’s library.\nAs he said, a lot of pages were seriously torn out.\nIt wasn’t a big deal, but I was curious and checked one of the books.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "There was the only intact page that was not torn.\n[To get closer to your lover, one of the ways is to bully him.]\n[If the person you like is swearing at you as if they hate you, you need to think about it the other way around. Rather, it could be that he is interested in you.]\nAs soon as I read the text, I was convinced.\nTurning my head, I pointed my gaze at Shael, who was eating dessert next to me pretending not to know anything.\n‘Did she leave only the pages she likes and ripped out the other pages?’\nI admired the cute Shael’s actions. Barely holding back my laughter, I just turned a blind eye to Shael’s secretive actions.\nNext came a conversation about my future with Shael. It was also the time when Duke Jespen raised his voice most fervently.\n“I don’t want to bring out this matter already, but…the Azbel family and the Baslett family needs someone that posses both the bloodlines.”\nDuke Jespen looked back and forth between Shael and me.\nI spoke on behalf of Shael, who was silent because she couldn’t overcome her shame.\n“Of course we agree. However, we would like to have a year or so to happily spend our time together.”\n“I see.”\nDuke Jespen nodded his head. It was a reasonable statement, so he seemed to understand it too.\nOf course, I wanted to see my daughter as soon as possible, but it was a matter decided after careful consideration. Because if you have a child as soon as you become a married couple, you won’t have the chance to enjoy the newly married life.\n“Even so, I think it would only take a year at most.”\n“…..”\n“By the way, the Basletts have a lot of great wines.”\nWhat that statement conveyed was simple.\n“So, you…”\nDuke Jespen’s words were interrupted by Shael’s stare, and the conversation about the matter ended with that.\nAfter that, Shael and I walked back towards my bedroom. No matter how much time passed, her blushing face didn’t return to its original color.\nEven though the conversation had already ended, but it’s contents still stayed in our hearts.\nAn awkward atmosphere lingered between us. So I had no choice but to be the one to break the silence.\n“Let’s go in.”\n“I’m sorry.”\nAs soon as we entered the room, Shael couldn’t overcome her embarrassment and turned around with her back facing me.\n“Okay, I’m going to go to the bathroom for a while.”\nAnd, Shael finally chose to escape.\nIt was honestly a good thing, because my condition was not much different from Shael’s. But there was one thing I was mistaken about. Shael didn’t run away, she fought back.\nShael said she was going to the bathroom, but when she came back to my room, there was a wine bottle in her hand.\n“….”\nShael set the wine bottle down on the table.\nIt must’ve required incredible courage for her to do such a thing, so I couldn’t back down as well.\nI gently put the wine glass in the room on the table and tilted the wine bottle.\nThe red-tinted wine filled the wine glasses. Even as the wine glasses overflowed, Shael and I remained silent.\nSoon Shael and I lifted our wine glasses without a signal. There was no need for side dishes. Because we were already aware of the intent in the other’s eyes.\nI was worried that I might lack the resolve to take that step, so I carefully drank the wine.\nAs I raised my head, the ceiling seemed to be closer than it should be. I couldn’t tell if it was because of the a1cohol or if it was because of my erratically beating heart.\nThe wine glass was soon empty.\nIntoxication lingered, exhalation filled the air, and the circulation of blood sped up.\nMy body felt strangely hot, and the ceaseless beating of my heart felt uncontrollable.\nAfter a mustering up the courage, I took Shael in my embrace.\nAs soon as I felt her soft body in my arm, the nervousness from before vanished.\nIt wasn’t long before our lips met, and the final wall collapsed, as we finally united as one.\nA warm atmosphere filled the room, and the cold night air provided even more comfort.\nThe dizzying and long night continued.\n* * *\nI opened my eyes feeling refreshed, and felt the weight on my body.\nAt the moment, Shael was using my stomach as a pillow to sleep.\nThe irregular sound of Shael’s breathing felt harsh, as if to show her fatigue.\nI would normally look at Shael with a smile, but I couldn’t because of the strange sleeping posture.\n“Let me sleep, please. Can I use the bed…”\nShe muttered under her breath.\n“Then sleep.”\nWas she awake or she was just talking in her sleep?\nShael, who was muttering strange nonsense, fell asleep again.\n‘Use the bed?’\nOf course it wasn’t bad. I was more than willing to serve as a bed for the villainess.\nShael tossed and turned while muttering something in her sleep, but her sleeping posture still looked quite uncomfortable.\nAs I pushed Shael aside a little, something fell off to the bed.\nTooung!\nIt was a cross.\nThe cross she bought when we went to the Holy Land’s Blessing Meeting.\n‘Did it say that the cross will make it come true if you make a wish every day?’\nIf Shael, who had no patience, had been carrying the cross and wishing to it everyday, it was obvious what that wish could be.\nIt must have been a wish related to me.\nI took the cross that Shael had been carrying with her all this time and made a wish as well.\nI wished for a happy future.\n‘I’m still happy, but…’\nI hope that one day we can have a happier family.\nI made the wish, and turned my head to look beyond the window. The golden rays of sun shined upon my face, as if to signify the arrival of a bright future.\nPutting the cross back in Shael’s arms, I closed my eyes, and smiled.\nFor some reason, it felt like the arrival of a small and precious gift.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can.

      "content": "The silence felt even more awkward than the day I first confessed my love for Shael.\n“Is there anything you would like to eat?”\nNormally, Shael would have overcame her shame by saying something like, [D-dessert…]\nHowever, this time Shael didn’t answer at all, she just kept opening and closing her mouth repeatedly.\nIf she kept acting like that, Duke Jespen might find out what happened last night. Because that person was very adept at reading his beloved daughter’s emotions.\n“Let’s go for a walk first.”\nThere were only a few days left before the wedding. As soon as we decided to get married, we immediately set a date for the wedding.\nOf course, there was no need to rush.\nUntil the day comes when we would be together, we could just spend time taking a walk.\nAnd so, I walked down the hallway of Baslett Mansion with Shael.\nThe Baslett family was very busy. But, it was a pity that we had no one to invite to the wedding.\nI realized it while thinking about the people I would invite for the wedding, but Shael and I had a very few people we could call friends. No, it would be right to say that there were none at all.\nWhen sending wedding invitations, I just stayed silent and froze.\nDuke Jespen, who saw through it, broke into a cold sweat and gave us words of comfort.\nIt was fortunate that there were many members of the Baslett family and the Azbel family.\nAs I was contemplating if there was anyone to send a wedding invitation to, I heard Shael’s voice.\n“What is it?”\n“I was wondering if there was someone I could send a wedding invitation to.”\nI didn’t really have to worry so much because there were members of the two duke families. Still, it was a pity that Shael and I couldn’t invite anyone directly.\nShael tilted her head.\nIt seemed that Shael hadn’t even thought about the matter. Still, it was a once-in-a-lifetime event. So shouldn’t it be important?\n“You have no one to send.”\n“Isn’t that the same for you?”\nIt was also Shael’s fault that I couldn’t make friends with anyone else in the first place. I used each and every day of my life to improve myself in order to satisfy the wicked villainess, Shael, and even spent my spare time with her.\nEven now, despite her personality becoming a little milder, I couldn’t even make a single friend because Shael wouldn’t like it if I talked to anyone else other than her.\n‘Still…’\nThere would be no such thing in the future. Shael filled my loneliness by herself, and I would have a family one day as well.\n“I will just live like this from now on.”\nThat thought seemed to be the same for Shael. We made a promise to each other that we would confidently live without any social interactions. It was a really funny promise.\n“That is such a ridiculous statement.”\n“I said I would play with you from now on, are you dissatisfied?”\n“Just like last night? To be honest, I am quite satisfied.”\nShael blushed.\nMy words must’ve made made ger think about yesterday’s events.\nAnyways, as if we were following the traces of the past, we toured the places we had traveled together before our love blossomed.\nFirst of all, we visited the Azbel family mountain range. It was a mountain where I had to carry Shael because she hurt her legs.\n‘Is Shael’s physical strength still as bad?’\nYes it was.\nProven by the fact that she was now panting and gasping for breath. At the same time, she was giving me a pitiful gaze.\nAnd so, it was inevitable that I had to carry her on my back. I did it in the past, and it was difficult for me to refuse Shael’s request now.\nAt the same time, I couldn’t stop myself from teasing her.\n“You seem to be heavier than before.”\nI immediately felt a pinch at the nape of my neck. But even in that, I could feel her consideration for me. The fact itself made me laugh.\nI was conscious of it before, but Shael had changed quite a lot. It seemed that all the hard work I had done so far had paid off.\nThe villainess from the novel became a woman who couldn’t live without me, and her cold personality that would argue with anything that walked on legs had disappeared.\nActually, she still had a little bit of the past coldness. But I was satisfied with the fact that the coldness was not directed toward me, or toward someone innocent.\n“Even if I become heavy, you won’t be able to get away.”\nI showed a foolish smile at Shael’s shameless words…\n‘At this rate…would I smile even if Shael bullied me?’\nI wondered when I became so stupid. However, it didn’t feel bad, so I smiled again.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to support me if you can. You can also support me and sponsor chapters at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "It meant that I fell in love with Shael.\nThe cute villainess didn’t even know that, and she continued to give me tight hugs as if she was trying to tease me for daring to tease her.\n“Since when did you like me?”\n“That is a very sudden question.”\nUnlike the words that unconsciously said, I was thinking about the answer to Shael’s question in my head.\n‘When did I start liking Shael?’\nI failed to pinpoint a the time, and couldn’t find an answer.\n‘What made me fall in love in the first place?’\nIf I couldn’t find the answer, looking back at the past events might help.\n‘What made me fall in love with Shael?’\nEven that was not an easy question to answer. so I decided to think some more about the past.\nThe very first thing that came to my mind was that I used to hate Shael. Of course, I felt a slight affection towards her when I read the novel, but that changed after coming to this world.\nIt was natural. I spent six months suffering from her abusive behavior, but what I got as compensation was even more abuse.\n‘The first time when things began to change was probably…’\nThe time when I first scolded the villainess. She became flustered more easily than I thought, and revealed her cute side. It was the first time I discovered Shael’s charm. I could feel the indescribable cuteness in\nher behavior, and my affection began to rise from then on.\nThe affection accumulated every time we insulted each other, until the point it reached a new level. So, the question of when did I fall in love was not appropriate.\nI didn’t even know when I started to love Shael.\nI knew that I fell in love at some point, and I was aware of the amount of my love. It was bigger than anything\nelse, bigger than the tallest mountain.\nRecalling my love, I answered Shael’s question.\n“I don’t know.”\nI couldn’t see her expression because I was carrying Shael on my back.\n‘Is she making an annoyed expression?’\n“…stupid.”\nShael said with a grunt.\nEven so, I didn’t feel any feeling of contempt from her voice.\nOf course I didn’t want to lose, so I asked Shael in return.\n“Then, when did you start to love me?”\nShael went silent. And the answer she finally came up with was a bit clumsy.\n“Mooo…I don’t know.”\n“Stupid.”\nIt was only natural for me to return the words I had received just a moment ago\n“How can someone be stupid for something they might not know?”\n“Who said that I was stupid in the first place?”\n“That and this are different.”\n“It looks the same to me.”\nAnd so, the random childish squabble continued.\nAs always, in the end we happily reconciled with a smile.\n* * *\nA few days passed.\nEven though it was a short time, those few days felt like eons of time to me.\n‘\nAnd….’\nFinally today.\nThe day had come when Shael and I would be forming a firm bond.\nIt felt the pounding heart in my chest, and even though it was still early in the morning, my body wasn’t tired.\nOn the contrary, my eyes were bright and my whole body was full of energy.\n‘Shael is sleeping.’\nHere I was, feeling nervous about what’s to come, and she was immersed in a sweet sleep?\nOf course I didn’t wake her up. I just raised my hand and patted her head.\nAfter that, I pictured the future in my head…and even in my imagination Shael was still sleeping like she was now.\n‘It’s a sight I’ll keep seeing in the future.’\nIf that was the case, I would whisper softly to Shael, who fell asleep in the future.\n[How long are you going to sleep by yourself? I wonder if you are tired of kissing me secretly last night.]\nThen, when Shael wakes up, she’ll come up with strange excuses, and she’ll even laugh while arguing with me.\nIt was a very happy future that I had no choice but to look forward to.\nI hugged Shael so that she could sleep more comfortably. My shadow cast over Shael’s body as if it wanted to protect her.\nYes, it was a warm shadow. It was a fact that could be understood by looking at Shael, who had a warmer smile on her face\nClosing my eyes, I put a warm smile on my face, just like Shael.\nThe sunlight warmed up my emotions, which were already burning hot.\nThe ticking grandfather clock made me look forward to the wedding that I was still looking forward to so much.\nThe end that would announce a new beginning was approaching.\nIn other words, it would be a time when true happiness would blossom into a bright flower bud, nourished by our combined efforts.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to read more chapters, and you can also support me by donating at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "The Holy Land was dyed in white.\nShael and I were walking together on a place that was like a white canvas.\nOur destination was the wedding hall that we had seen before while attending the Blessing Meeting. It was the place where Shael and I would be forming an eternal bond.\nThe people of the Holy Land hated us because of Clie’s machinations, but thanks to the wealth of the wealthy Azbel family, we were able to rent the wedding venue.\nThe rumors spread by Clie had faded away quite a lot as well, so it wasn’t that much of a troublesome matter.\n‘Anyway, the important thing is that today is my wedding day with Shael.’\nWhen I recalled the fact that I had been reminding myself several times, a broad smile appeared on my face.\nI was acting like this, so what kind of expression was the shy Shael making?\n‘She must be making a silly face…’\nI turned her head to look at Shael for a definitive answer. However, my prediction was not correct.\nShael wasn’t making a silly face, she was pouting her lips as if there was something wrong.\n“What is it?”\n“We are late, hurry!”\nIn fact, there was quite a bit of time left before the ceremony began. We also purposely left early to spend\ntime together before the ceremony.\nThe wedding hall was still being prepared by the family members. So there was definitely something strange about Shael’s words.\n“You look like you are hiding something.”\n“Oh, no…nothing.”\nAs I turned my head to take a look, Shael blocked my way as if she was trying to cover something up.\nOf course, with her small body, she couldn’t block my vision. And, what appeared in my sight was a stone statue that Shael had been trying to hide.\nIt was the statue of the Goddess of Love. It was same the Goddess statue we saw when I and Shael came to the Blessing Meeting.\nCome to think of it, Shael had suddenly urged me to repeat my confession in front of the statue of the Goddess. After recalling that memory, I could understand why Shael was trying to hide the Goddess statue.\n‘There was a legend that if you confess in front of the Goddess statue, your love will last forever.’\nIt was a legend I saw in a book I read before coming to the Holy Land. That was the reason why Shael was ready to bear the shame and demanded that I confess again. And that was also probably why she was covering the statue of the Goddess now.\n“Looks like you’re covering the Goddess statue.”\nShael shook her head.\nBut looking at her reaction, it seemed that my guess was correct.\nAnyways, I couldn’t just waste the opportunity to tease Shael, so I opened my mouth.\n“There was a legend that if you confess in front of the Goddess statue, your love will last forever..”\n“Don’t speak.”\nAs she realized that I already knew about the legend, Shael glared at me.\nI stroked Shael’s head a few times and didn’t stop walking.\nAs time passed, I saw a large tree. Like the statue of the Goddess, it was a tree I had seen before.\n‘I hung my wish on the tallest branch of this tree.’\nShael had written her wish on two pieces of paper. I still remembered it quite vividly.\n“Do you remember hanging the wish?”\n“Of course.”\n“Did you wish for us to be able to start a family together?”\nTo make things clear, it was the wish I had written on the paper.\n“How can you know that!”\nBut looking at Shael’s reaction, it seemed that she also written the same thing.\nI could see Shael’s blushing cheeks, so I could tell.\n‘So Shael wrote the same wish as me.’\nOf course, Shael wrote down one more thing. But, I decided not to look into it. Let’s save the rest for the future.\nI tried to ignore Shael who was poking me in the back and headed towards our destination.\nSoon, a huge wedding hall crowded with familiar people caught my eye.\nThe members of the Azbel family and the Baslett family greeted us with happy smiles.\nNow, the preparations for the wedding were complete.\nAfter spending some time with Shael, who wanted a long hug in the middle, there was not much time left until the guests arrived.\nWe went into the ceremony hall together, calming our trembling hearts as much as possible.\n* * *\nI took a deep breath and stared at the mirror.\nI carefully inspected my whole body, worried about whether there was any dust on it. Everything was fine except for the beating heart that I couldn’t control.\n“I’m so nervous.”\n“Young Lord, you look splendid. You have to leave the waiting room soon…”\nI couldn’t pay attention to the butler’s words. The thoughts about Shael had indiscriminately taken over my mind.\n‘Is Shael okay?’\nShe must be more nervous than me. Still, she’ll be smiling brightly.\nIn my mind, I pictured a nervous Shael. I missed her quite a lot. It was quite a strange feeling since it hadn’t been that long since I parted with Shael.\nAt that time, the signal that the preparations were over was heard.\nI forcibly pulled my still nervous body, and walked forward.\nThe wedding hall finally entered my view.\nI could see the mages of the Azbel family casting light magic, and the swordsmen of the Baslett family standing in rows.\nI turned my head and looked at them all. I was able to feel their good will towards the event.\nWhen my wandering gaze reached a certain place, my mouth hung open.\nI saw Shael walking with Duke Jespen in her wedding dress.\nAs soon as I saw her, my heart, which had been pounding with tension, stiffened for an instant.\nShael was so beautiful. More beautiful as usual. She was prettier and more elegant than ever before.\nShe had an elegant and noble aura about her very being, and it enthralled my mind.\nWhen I came to her senses, Shael was already in front of me.\nI almost reached out and gave her a hug. Because I felt that Shael, who was looking at me, was unbearably cute.\nDuke Jespen, standing next to Shael, smiled.\n“The best lovers in the Empire.”\n“Thank you.”\n“I won’t say anything long. I believe that you will live a good life even if I don’t say anything.”\nThat was a moving statement. However, Duke Jespen seemed like he was feeling nervous as well.\n‘Why does Duke Jespen seem more nervous than me?’\nThanks to that, I was able to calm my trembling body a bit.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to read more chapters, and you can also support me by donating at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "I thanked Duke Jespen and held Shael’s hand.\nI felt Shael’s warmth. I could feel the warm support from our parents gazes, and not only that, but everyone at the wedding hall was sending their fervent blessings.\nThen we stopped in front of the Bishop of the Holy Land who would be officiating our wedding.\nThe Bishop opened his mouth to say all the good things he was supposed to say.\nEven though it was disrespectful to the Bishop of the Holy Land, my ears were completely oblivious to the words he was saying with such passion.\nThe reason for that was all my attention was now set on Shael. That seemed to be the case for Shael as well.\nShael sent me a look, as if she was trying to say something.\n[Why don’t you concentrate!]\nI was able to interpret the meaning of that look even if I couldn’t hear her.\n[Isn’t it the same for you?]\nI also told Shael with a lool of my own.\nI could see Shael frowning slightly, as if she had understood what I was trying to convey.\n[Your face is red. I think you’re really nervous.]\n[Speak for yourself.]\nWe had several more of such conversations that we could convey without words. We could hear the beating of our hearts louder than the voice of the officiant. It must be the same for Shael as well.\n“….kiss!”\nAnd finally, I was able to hear something. To be exact, I only heard one word.\nI knew at least that it was time for Shael and I to kiss each other.\nI turned her head towards Shael. Shael was already looking at me and raising her head.\nAt some point, Shael’s and my lips touched.\nOnly then did my tense body calm down, and my trembling hands became firm. My ears, which had been unable to hear anything except for the sound of my heart, became so sensitive that I could even hear the flow of air, and even more warm heat enveloped my body.\nA sweet and hot kiss.\nA lovely kiss that could fill the pure white Holy Land with the love of Shael and I, full of colors.\nIt was an infinitely long, satisfying kiss.\n* * *\nWhat came after, was a repetition of our happy daily life.\nShael and I were eating dessert together.\nAcross from us sat Duke Jespen. In front of him, was a single dessert as Shael had allocated, and in\nfront of Shael and me, there were piles of desserts.\n‘Isn’t this too much?’\nI felt pity for Duke Jespen, who was thrilled that Shael had given him a piece of her dessert.\nThen Shael handed me a cupcake and she said, “This is delicious. Try it.”\nIt was as Shael said. In my opinion, these cupcakes were quite delicious.\nI also held out one of Shael’s favorite cookies and held it out to her.\nShael took the cookie into her mouth, munching on the cookies as if to savor the sweetness. Then she frowned and shook her body.\n“Eh…”\nThere was no way Shael would hate my cookies. In other words, there mush be something was wrong with Shael.\nI calmed down and patted Shael on the back. I\nUsually, Duke Jespen would’ve rushed to get the Azbel family doctor right away. However, this time his eyes opened wide, and his mouth hung open.\n“Ho, maybe…!”\nDuke Jespen gasped in astonishment.\nAnd that astonishment was transferred to me before I knew it. Then a possibility came to my mind.\n‘Couldn’t it be a child?’\nBut that couldn’t be the case. Because Shael and I had put off our family plans.\nExcept for that one steamy night, she had been on birth control.\n“Ugh!”\nBut, as if denying my thoughts at once, Shael’s nausea came again.\nI didn’t have time to think further.\nWhen I came to my senses, the Azbel family physician called by Duke Jespen had already arrived.\nThe results came quickly.\n“Good news! It is as the head of the household said, the Young Lady is with a child!”\nIt was a news with an impact that could make everyone in the Azbel family faint.\n* * *\nI was sitting on the sofa and looking at Shael’s belly.\nI couldn’t believe that there was a small life in that small place.\nWe were about to have a child.\nI would finally be able to see Ruelle.\nI laughed at the happy though. Yes, the family plans that we had planned in advance have been disrupted, but what about it?\nThe important thing was that I would become a father.\nThere was just one thing I was curious about.\nAs we had planned, we tried to avoid having a child as much as possible.\n‘Was it possible to have a child just from one night?’\nAnyways, it was a very happy thing. I couldn’t wipe away the smile on my face .\nBut still, I asked Shael to satiate my curiosity.\n“I am very happy. But haven’t we been using magic tools to avoid having children?”\nShael nodded her head. Certainly, we used magic tools.\n“Ah, maybe the magic tool was defective. It would be a good idea to check it in case we need to use it again someday.”\nShael tilted her head, opened her mouth.\n“The magic tool is fine.”\n‘So you’re saying that I misused the magic tool?’\nShael opened her mouth to respond to me, who was suspicious.\n“It must have happened on that night.”\n“So the first time we…”\nMy memories of that night was fresh. That night when we drank wine and lost control. Still, I had maintained a bit of my reason, and had only proceed after Shael had confirmed that it was a safe day.\n“Didn’t you say it was a safe day?”\n“It was.”\nI became even more curious. But seeing Shael nodding her head even now, it didn’t seem like she was telling a lie.\n“What could’ve happened?”\nWhen I raised my question, the expression on Shael’s face changed.\nThe corners of her mouth went up, and formed a naughty smirk. Then she gently stroked her belly, as she shamelessly proclaimed.\n“It was a safe day to have a child.”\nHonestly it was an enchanting sight. I cherished the scene before me and looked back at our past memories.\n[Shut up, you bit*ch.]\nIt all began with an insult…along with a promise to rehabilitate the wicked woman.\nBut now, I didn’t consider that woman a bitch.\nShe was now my one an only wife.\n“How shameless…”\nI looked down to tease Shael. However, Shael was already asleep.\n‘Isn’t this unfair?’\nStill, it was a Shael-like thing to do, so it didn’t matter much. Rather, I liked Shael’s shamelessness and found it quite lovable.\nI felt the wind blow. So I got up to close the window. I didn’t want Shael to catch a cold.\nOut of the window, I could see the horizon stretching far and wide into the distance.\nThe stars above were loftily emitting light.\nEven though it was far away, the starlight coming through the window felt quite soothing.\nThe starlight enveloped us. As if blessing the birth of a new life.\nThe window was closed. Nevertheless, the starlight filled the room with a happy atmosphere.\nI hugged Shael who was lying on the bed and closed my eyes. It seemed that the warmth we felt at the wedding hall was still covering our bodies. The warmth that would never be lost.\nIn the future, whenever I look back on the warmth of that time, happy memories will come to my mind.\nSo, eternal and endless happiness will be with us in the future.\nWe will have a family full of happiness, and sometimes we will have trivial arguments, but in the end we will laugh and talk.\nI was sure…\nGoblin:\nThere you have it…the end of Chapter 113, marking the end of this sweet and lovely novel, Rehabilitating the Villainess. I must say, it ended in a satisfying manner, without needlessly dragging on. It left no regrets.\nHowever, there are still 5 more side stories to go. I call them side stories, but they are more like the continuation of the story, focusing more on the cute Ruelle.\nAnd after that, I will give my farewell speech for this novel, as well as talk about the project that will be taking RTV’s place.\nThank you all for all your support throughout this journey.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to read more chapters, and you can also support me by donating at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "I was heading to the Azbel family’s mansion while holding Shael’s hand.\nAll actions requited extreme caution. Shael must never hit anything, and she must not slip!\nA leaf appeared in front of Shael.\nEven if it was a leaf, if it was in front of Shael, it should be considered as a huge obstacle!\n“Please stop.”\nAfter carefully blowing away the leaf with magic so it wouldn’t touch Shael, I grabbed Shael’s hand again.\nBut Shael didn’t move her body as if her feet were glued to the ground.\n“Is something wrong?”\n“You’re being too overprotective.”\n‘Overprotective?’\n“You don’t know how fragile a human life is. Even if you step on the wrong leaf…”\nShael didn’t listen to me and moved on.\n“If you keep doing that, I will use my magic.”\n“That, you can’t do that.”\nUsing magic is a very strenuous exercise. So using magic was no good. Because intense and extreme exercise can’t be good for pregnancy.\nI managed to get Shael to sit on the bench while she was threatening to use magic.\nAfter that, it was time to have a happy time.\nI gently put my hand on Shael’s belly and felt the child move little by little.\n“You can stroke it harder.”\n“No.”\n“….”\nI couldn’t. Because strong stimulation would not be good for the child.\nActually, it was okay if I did. But I was very worried. In the first place, I was satisfied with being able to feel the child to this extent.\n“I can feel it moving.”\n“Really?”\nShael also put her hand on her stomach. Then the child’s stopped moving.\n“Boo, I guess it’s because its feeling shy.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes. Of course, its mother would be better than its father.”\nI couldn’t help but laugh at Shael’s forced excuse. The same was true of Shael, who pitifully made such an excuse.\n“I hope to see it soon.”\n“I am so nervous.”\nAs Shael said, it has already been several months since we found out she was pregnant. Nevertheless, I hardly ever got used to the fact that I would became a father.\nI became overprotective of Shael, and whenever I felt her baby move, I made a fuss about it and did stupid things.\nLately I’ve been acting like an idiot.\n‘Shouldn’t Shael be in a bad mood?’\nOf course, Shael, threatened to use magic if I acted too overprotective of her. It seemed like an threat close to a joke. Even now, Shael was holding out her hand, asking me to lead her by the hand again.\nBut still, I was worried. Although she seemed alright on the outside, on the inside, she might not like my stupid behavior.\nWhile I was suffering from a complex mental agony, it was Shael who erased my agony cleanly.\n“Aren’t you cleaning?”\n“…?”\nI came to my senses at Shael’s words and looked ahead. There was a pile of leaves in front of Shael.\nShael saw it and was asking me to blow them away. I couldn’t help but feel suspicious.\n‘Is she doing this on purpose because it looks like I’m worried?’\nI could tell from the way Shael was looking at me.\n‘It seems like I should make some desserts for Shael…’\nIt was a trade of sorts.\nSince Shael was pregnant, I gave her as little desserts as possible.\nActually, it didn’t matter because I could make a dessert that wasn’t harmful to the body, but…I didn’t.\nAs for Shael, she only ate the dessert made by me, so she didn’t touch anything else. So, essentially she was banned from having any desserts.\nAnyways, I took Shael’s hand and led her to the dining room of the Baslett mansion. However, the dessert I had prepared in advance was nowhere to be seen.\nThis situation was quite familiar. Because something like this happened in the past as well.\nAnd the culprit, was obvious.\n“Did you eat desserts because you couldn’t stand it again?”\nShael’s answer was obvious.\nObviously, she would make an excuse, saying, [I was hungry…so what else could I have done?]\nHowever, Shael’s answer exceeded my imagination. Rather, her words were more than enough to convince me.\nShael put her hand on her bloated belly and looked at me with pitiful eyes. Then she gave me a bewitching smile.\n“My Ruelle…wanted to eat the dessert made by her dad.”\n‘This is…’\nIt was a battle I had no choice but to lose.\nIn the end, I made Shael another batch of desserts.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to read more chapters, and you can also support me by donating at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "After Shael was found to be pregnant, time passed very quickly.\nHer stomach grew bigger by the day, and finally, the precious life came out into the world.\nOur baby girl began to cry loudly as soon as she was born.\nAnd then, as she grew a little, she came to have a striking resemblance to Shael.\nShe had sky blue hair reminiscent of clear river water and a pair of blue eyes. She was such a cute daughter that I couldn’t take my eyes off her. She was absolutely adorable!\nOf course, we named her Ruelle.\nTime passed quickly as I watched my lovely daughter grow up.\nAt some point, Ruelle was five years old.\nShe loved to listen to me read her stories. Even now, she was eagerly listening to a storybook while sitting on my lap.\nWhen I turned my head, I found that Shael was lying on our bed, sleeping soundly. Even when she was sleeping, she had her head facing towards me.\n‘She seems happy.’\nI stroked Ruelle’s hair. Then, when I removed my hand, Ruelle’s head also followed. Meaning, she wanted me to stroke her hair more.\nI had no reason to refuse. I was more than willing to stroke such a cute daughter’s hair.\nAccording to Ruelle’s request, I put my hand on Ruelle’s head and continued to read.\n“In some aristocratic families, they call daddy ‘father’ for the sake of dignity.”\nI knew they did that, but I couldn’t understand why they would teach such restricting titles to their cute children.\nAristocratic society was indeed quite complex.\nRuelle spoke in a sullen voice.\n“Should I do the same?”\n“No, you don’t have to. You can call me whatever you want.”\n“Yes, daddy!”\nThe way she called me made me laugh.\nThen Ruelle shifted her gaze to the children’s book, meaning she wanted me to continue.\n“How far have I read…”\n“Hmm, it’s the scene where Alice meets the stranger!”\nRuelle pointed at the page with her dainty finger.\n“A stranger wearing a black robe attacked Alice. She hurriedly ran away, but the stranger pulled out a sword and charged at Alice.”\nAs I read the contents, I noticed that Ruelle seemed to have gotten quite anxious.\nIn fact, this story had a happy ending, but young Ruelle didn’t know that. To her, who has a strong sense of immersion, the current content must have seemed quite serious.\n“Ruelle, are you okay?”\n“Yes!”\nRuelle, who wiped away her tears and nodded her head vigorously, and held up the book.\nI wanted to hurry up and reach the part we could see Alice defeating the bad stranger\nKrrrrrrt…\nBut I heard a small yet sharp sound.\nRuelle’s tiny hands were tearing the storybook ever so slightly.\n“The stranger wearing a black robe…”\nThe page I was reading just now was slightly torn. Because of that, the sentence was also divided in half.\n“…failed to harm Alice.”\nAfter reading that I looked at Ruelle. Because I was feeling curios why she was tearing the page.\nRuelle held her head upright and put her hand on her waist. Then she proudly said, “Done!”\nIt meant that she had successfully dealt with the bad guy. The process of tearing up the page and separating the word ‘stranger’ from ‘Alice’ was her way of saving Alice.\n“Uhh…”\nI thought she would stick her head out for a head pat, but contrary to my thoughts, Ruelle just stood still in a daze.\nTherefore, I moved my eyes along Ruelle’s gaze…\n[The stranger readied his sword again…]\nApart from the previous sentence, the sentence below was also divided in half.\n[…and ran towards Alice.]\nThis time, not only the bad stranger, but Alice, the heroine of the story, was also split in half.\nRuelle, who was dazed for a moment with a cute appearance, came to her senses. Then, a small amount of mana gathered in her hands.\nEventually, as Ruelle waved her hand, the torn pages were quickly fixed. The page was now restored to its original form.\nI had seen Ruelle use magic before, but I was still impressed. To think she could use such complex magic at the young age of five. It was clear that she inherited Shael’s talent for magic.\n“Whoops!”\n“What’s wrong?”\nAgain, I followed Ruelle’s gaze just like before.\n[A stranger wearing a black robe attacked Alice.]\nThe line that Ruelle had torn was fixed again thanks to Ruelle’s magic.\n“Hmph..the bad guy appeared again…”\nLooking at it now, Ruelle didn’t just inherit Shael’s magical talent. It was clear that she had inherited even Shael’s eccentric nature.\nSuddenly, I felt something on my body. When I turned my head, I found that Shael, who had been sleeping on the bed, was at some point was dozing off leaning against me.\nAnd so, the happy daily life of a strange yet close-knit family had begun.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to read more chapters, and you can also support me by donating at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "After reading a storybook to Ruelle, I woke up Shael who had fallen asleep, while leaning on my shoulder.\nRuelle immediately hugged her mother, and enjoyed her embrace.\nShael also warmly embraced Ruelle.\n‘It’s amazing every time I see it…’\nI didn’t expect Shael’s maternal love to be so great. To be honest, one couldn’t say that Shael’s personality was good. Nevertheless, Shael’s love for Ruelle was endless.\nThanks to that, Ruelle was able to grow up receiving deep love from both me and Shael.\n“I finished all the books!”\nWhen Ruelle showed off her achievement with a cute voice, Shael responded by patting Ruelle’s cheek with a loving gaze.\nJust looking at them warmed my heart.\nI, too, tried to snuggle up and enjoy a happy embrace. However, as always, Shael teased me with a mischievous smile.\n“You’ve became the duke now, so shouldn’t you have work to do?”\nShael’s words reminded me of my current identity.\nYes, as Shael said, I was now the Duke of House Baslett.\nDuke Ezran, who had been working hard for a long time, finally decided to pass down the position of the head of the family. The process went smoothly because I had been taking care of the work for some time now.\nBy the way, when I get busy with work, Shael would pout with inflated cheeks.\n‘It’s such a Shael-like thing to do.’\nI couldn’t help but give Shael and Ruelle a warm hug.\nBut, as if reminded by Shael’s words, Ruelle’s eyes widened as if she thought of something fun.\n“I want to go on an errand!”\n“An errand?”\nRuelle nodded her head.\n‘Errand…\n’\nEven if it wasn’t a request from Ruelle, I was thinking of introducing her to the outside world someday. But that wasn’t the case now. Ruelle was still only five years old. Let alone running errands, Ruelle had to lead a safe life in the mansion.\n“Oh, can’t I?”\n“It is possible.”\nContrary to my thoughts, it was impossible for me to refuse when facing Ruelle’s earnest gaze.\nWe had numerous safety measures anyway.\nFrom a ring that tracked her position, to a necklace that was enchanted with great protection magic…no one in the in the Empire would be able to harm her.\nIn the first place, I was also planning to follow Ruelle.\nRuelle looked up at me with sparkling eyes. It was a gaze that wanted to know what she would have to do.\n“Wouldn’t buying milk be all right?”\n“Yes!”\nThe reason why we chose milk for Ruelle’s errand was simple. She loved to drink milk.\n“Then tomorrow…”\n“Let’s go today!”\nRuelle said with a cute tone. Of course, there was no way I could refuse.\nI gave Ruelle enough money to buy milk, then gave her the ring and the necklace for her safety. That alone should be enough, but I also put a separate protection spell on her because of my overflowing worries.\n“I’ll be back!”\nUnlike Shael, who was slow, Ruelle moved quickly, and left the mansion.\n‘Is this really alright?’\nA child running errands at the age of only five. Still, there was nothing to worry about.\nLess than 10 seconds after Ruelle left the mansion, Shael and I left as well. Even though we didn’t talk to each other, we implicitly executed the same action.\n“We’d better follow suit now.”\n“Yes, we should.”\nAnd so, we left the mansion.\nWe saw Ruelle was walking through the field, murmuring to herself.\nIt was a scene fatal to the heart.\nRunning around to catch butterflies, smelling the scent of the pretty flowers, Ruelle walked on to complete her mission.\n“So cute.”\n“Of course. Whose daughter do you think she is?”\nThat was Shael’s answer, probably indicating that she was cute herself.\n‘It’s true, so it doesn’t matter.’\nAnyway, that wasn’t something that was important now.\nNow I fixed my eyes on Ruelle, who was moving at a brisk pace.\nAt some point, Ruelle arrived at the plaza of the Baslett family’s estate, where there were quite a few people.\nRuelle walked on, brightening the somber atmosphere of the Baslett’s estate with her presence.\nIt felt like Ruelle was the moon in the night sky, making me feel a strange sense of pride.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to read more chapters, and you can also support me by donating at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "[Ruelle’s POV]\n‘Oops!’\nRuelle shook her head, waking herself up from the reverie of fun.\nShe had almost forgotten today’s goal while looking at the flowers!\n‘I have to buy milk for as an errand!’\nHowever, Ruelle’s goal wasn’t just completing the errand. It included examining the environment outside the Baslett family’s mansion, which she didn’t get to experience that much.\nRuelle increased her speed, trying to somehow engrave the scenery around her with eyes. Suddenly, she saw passers-by passing by.\n“Hello!”\nLike her daddy said, she didn’t skip greetings. The people tilted their heads because she was wearing a luxurious dress, but Ruelle didn’t care. She was just doing her best to follow her father’s words.\n‘Ah!’\n[Ruelle, friends are important, so it’s good to try and make friends with good people.]\nRuelle, finally recalling her father’s advice, turned her gaze and looked around her.\n“Oh, how are you?”\nShe tried to talk to the ant that was roaming below, but the ant didn’t talk like they did in the fairy tale.\nRuelle looked around her once more. But she couldn’t see a child her own age.\nWhen the disappointed Ruelle let out a weak sigh, someone came into her field of vision.\nIt was a girl with brown hair.\nShe seemed much older than Ruelle, but that didn’t make her an adult.\n‘That’s it!’\nThis was a rare opportunity!\nA chance to make a friend. Someone not from another aristocratic family who only valued her for her status.\n“Hi! Wh-what’s your name?”\nRuelle cheerfully greeted the girl with great enthusiasm. It was a perfect greeting, even though she almost stuttered her pronunciation.\n“I-I’m… Kanna.”\nBut the answer wasn’t perfect, as the girl responded in a trembling voice, filled with fear.\nFeeling strange about the fact, Ruelle raised her head and looked more closely at Kanna.\nKanna’s gaze was pointing to Ruelle’s dress.\nIt was only then that Ruelle realized what was wrong.\nAt the moment, she was wearing a pure white dress with blue frills. It was something that only nobles could afford to wear.\n‘What should I do?’\nAt this rate, it would be impossible to make friends. Kanna wouldn’t even properly look at her, and continued to stand still with a lowered head.\nFirst of all, Ruelle decided to tell a harmless lie to make a friend.\n“I-I picked this dress up off the ground!”\n“Yes, yes!?”\nAdmittedly, telling a lie was harder than she thought.\n“Huh!”\nRuelle took a brief deep breath.\nAfter calming herself down, she looked at Kanna with great expectations, but the other party didn’t seem to believe her words.\nWell, a dress she picked up from the ground wouldn’t be this clean. There was no way a dress like this would’ve been left on the ground.\n‘What should I do, Daddy?’\nShe tried to call her father internally, but there was no answer. What she heard instead was Kanna’s nervous voice.\n“Are you Lady Ruelle of the Baslett family? I remember seeing a glimpse of you at a festival before…”\nApparently, making friends was quite the difficult ordeal.\nHowever, Ruelle didn’t give up and earnestly spoke up, “I am not Ruelle Baslett!”\nIn order to make herself sound convincing, Ruelle decided to double down on the lie.\nRuelle looked back at her memories.\n‘When Mommy lies to Daddy, what does she do? Yes! She pouts her lips each time and looks away.’\nRuelle was able to figure out right away that it was a lie, but her Daddy, Eran, kept getting fooled.\nRuelle chewed on that fact, pursed her lips, and looked away.\n“Duke of Baslett is not my Daddy!”\nShe even pouted after she said it. It was a perfect lie!\nHowever, seeing that Kanna still didn’t seem to be convinced,  Ruelle took another breath and added more lies.\n“My Grandpa is definitely not the Duke Azbel!”\nAfter that, Ruelle gasped for breath. To her, telling lies was more difficult than using magic.\nHowever, there was one other thing that suddenly popped into Ruelle’s head.\n[Ruelle, you shouldn’t lie.]\nIt was something her Daddy used to tell her quite a lot. Because of that, Ruelle had no choice but to open her closed mouth again.\n“Actually, my Daddy is Duke Baslett.”\nRuelle’s confident expression went through a drastic change.\n“It’s also true that my Grandpa is Duke Azbel…”\nIn Ruelle’s head, her perfect lie had crumbled to pieces.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to read more chapters, and you can also support me by donating at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "[Daddy Eran’s POV]\n“Haahh…”\nThe scene of Ruelle confessing the truth after telling an awkward lie was soul crushing.\nI had no choice but to let out a groan. Because Ruelle’s appearance was so cute.\n“Then I’ll go…”\nThe sight of Ruelle leaving after a disappointing greeting made my heart even more sad.\nI almost lost sight of Ruelle. There’s tracking magic anyway, so it didn’t matter even if she was out of our sight.\n“She will arrive soon.”\n“Yes. I’m glad that Ruelle’s errands will end safely.”\nAs Shael said, at some point Ruelle was at the entrance of a large store. Then the smart Ruelle chose three bottles of milk properly to complete the errand, and showed a confident smile.\n* * *\n[Ruelle’s POV]\nRuelle brought three bottles of milk and brightly stood at the counter.\n“Give me this!”\nOne bottle was for the errand, and the other two were for ’emergencies’.\nAfter paying for the milk, Ruelle lightly left the store.\nThe goal of running errands has been achieved. However, in order to properly complete the errand, the milk had to be properly brought to the mansion.\nRuelle embraced the milk. It was in order to somehow keep the milk safe.\nOf course, it didn’t go as Ruelle had planned. A bottle of milk still slipped down while Ruelle was changing her posture.\nWow!\nThe bottle fell with a sharp sound, and the milk splattered on the floor.\n“Ah…”\n‘What a waste of milk. If I had known this would happen, I would have drank the milk as soon as I bought it.’\nThought Ruelle, as she gave a light bow to the unfortunate milk casualty and boldly turned around. Then she saw the girl she had seen earlier. It was the girl named Kanna.\n“Want one?”\n“Ye-yes…”\nUnknowingly, Ruelle handed a bottle of milk to Kanna.\nKanna accepted it without hesitation, and Ruelle smiled happily.\n‘Maybe we could be friends someday.’\nRuelle affirmed to herself and continued her journey towards the Baslett Mansion.\nShe passed a hill.\n“Huh-up…”\nRuelle was in good shape, but she was still a five-year-old, so it was difficult.\nNext was a long, long field.\nThe road was not difficult. However, Ruelle found it difficult to reach the end of the field.\n“Heck…”\nYet she didn’t give up. She wanted to complete the errand somehow.\nAnd so, hugging the last remaining bottle of milk even more, Ruelle walked on.\nThen, she finally saw the mansion. At this point, the success of the errand was confirmed.\nThen it was necessary to clean her sweaty body. She didn’t want to show this to everyone in the mansion.\nAt times like this, drinking milk would be perfect. And, there was a bottle of milk in Ruelle’s hand.\nAnd at some point it was heading towards Ruelle’s mouth.\n“Kyaha!”\nIt was cool and refreshing.\nThe glass bottle, at some point, became empty. Ruelle ended up drinking every drop of the milk.\nRuelle came into Baslett’s mansion with a bright smile one her face.\n“Mom!”\n“Ruelle…”\nRuelle tried to hand her mom the milk.\n“Ah…”\nHowever, the last bit of milk had already gone into Ruelle’s stomach.\n“Ooh, the milk is gone…”\nIn Ruelle’s mind, someone who didn’t succeed in running errands was a bad person.\nRuelle looked at Shael with her eyes asking what she should do.\nAnd, her mom said to her with her mischievous smile, “If you ask Daddy to make you dessert, I will take care of this.”\n“Yes!”\nA fire flashed in Ruelle’s eyes.\n‘I will ask Daddy for dessert!’\nIt was easier than anything else for Ruelle.\nShe immediately ran to the Baslett family’s office room, where her father would be.\n* * *\n[Daddy Eran’s POV]\n“Make me some dessert!”\n“Dessert?”\nI was a bit taken aback at Ruelle’s sudden request.\nWe had arrived right before Ruelle arrived at the mansion. So I thought Ruelle would arrive in a somber state.\nAfter all, she couldn’t stand it and drank all the milk, effectively failing at completing the errand.\n‘Why so suddenly though, and what kind of dessert?’\nFirst of all, it was Ruelle’s request, so I had to do it. I decided to make dessert for Ruelle without even thinking of refusal.\n“…?”\nBut Ruelle didn’t eat the dessert and called Shael over.\nShael sat down at the table and started eating the dessert.\n“It’s delicious.”\n“Drink!”\nThe pair of mother and daughter remarked.\nThere was indeed something strange about the situation, but since I could see their happy smile, I ignored it.\nThe most popular was the cupcakes. At some point, there was only one cupcake left.\nIt was Shael who picked it up first.\nBut Ruelle was looking at the cupcake as if she wanted to eat it as well.\n‘Usually, a villainess wouldn’t give it to anyone.’\nThen, a surprising thing happened…Shael handed the cupcake to Ruelle.\nRuelle, who happily took a bite, looked at me and Shael alternately and asked, “How did Daddy and Mommy come to love each other?”\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to read more chapters, and you can also support me by donating at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "How did Shael and I fall in love?\nFirst of all, my first meeting with Shael was while drinking tea.\nFrom the beginning, Shael gave me a cold look and bullied me. But when love started to sprout in earnest, that changed for the better.\n[Shut up, you b1tch!]\nMaybe that was the beginning. The beginning of the relationship between the aggravated me and the villainess who had no manner.\n‘But how am I going to tell Ruelle about that?’\nI could never say that to my precious daughter.\nPerhaps noticing my gaze, Shael put on a mischievous smile before she said, “Your father started by saying that I was a b1tch.”\n“Shael.”\nTo say such a thing. It was a remark that would make Ruelle, who was sensitive, cry as soon as she heard it.\nI waited for Ruelle to speak.\nBefore long, Ruelle woke up, and said, “That’s so romantic!”\n“Romantic?”\n“Yes!”\nTo be honest, I was embarrassed by her reaction. Although she was my daughter, I was a little curious about Ruelle’s state of mind.\n“You called Mommy a puppy! You’re just saying that she’s cute!”\n“Yes.”\nEven Shael had a puzzled look on her face, as she looked at Ruelle strangely.\nIn my opinion, Shael Had a strange way of thinking that was just as strange as Ruelle’s, so I only laughed.\nBut Shael’s mischief didn’t end there.\n“Uh, he even pointed his sword at your Mommy.”\n“A sword…!?”\nRuelle looked at me. It was a slightly questionable gaze, but eventually the feelings in that gaze changed.\n“That’s so romantic!”\nWhy on earth was it romantic?\nEven though I exchanged glances with Shael and had a silent discussion, the question was not resolved.\n“Ruelle, why is that romantic?”\n“Because it’s a story about Mommy and Daddy!”\n“Aha…”\nAs expected, Ruelle’s way of thinking was peculiar. She was indeed  Shael and my daughter.\n* * *\nAfter spending time with my family, I started working in my office over a glass of wine.\nFirst of all, I had to review a letter from the family selling ore to the Baslett family.\n‘That’s not good at all.’\nThe content of the letter stated that they wouldn’t have any more deals, which was not good for us.\n‘I need to have a talk.’\nBut there was a problem. I lowered my head, and looked at the Ring of Mutual Restriction I shared with Shael.\nIt was a magic tool that restricted you from talking to the opposite sex, except for the lover you share the ring with and the same bloodline. In short, it was an incredibly inconvenient thing.\n‘Let’s just ask to remove the ring altogether.’\nSince I had to ask Shael’s permission every time something like this happened, it was getting a bit annoying.\nIt would be better to persuade Shael to remove the ring.\nKikiiik…\nI opened the door without knocking. Shael was coming into her room hugging Ruelle.\n‘I have to say that I want to remove the ring first.’\nBefore that, something caught my eye. It wasn’t the Ring of Mutual Restriction I was wearing, it was the other Ring of Mutual Restriction that Shael was wearing.\n‘Come to think of it, did Shael ever say she wanted to take the ring off?’\nNo matter how you think about it, Shael never said she wanted to take the ring off.\nWhen I looked back at my memories, Shael was always wearing the ring. If that was the case, I would become the bad guy for taking off the ring dozens of times.\n“What it it?”\nI once thought I was being held captive because of Shael’s jealousy. But that was my mistake.\nShael was doing more than that, she loved me all the time.\nAnd, because I got used to her love, I was starting to feel annoyed. Nevertheless, Shael continued to show me an infinite amount of love…in her own way.\nI was living a happier life than I thought. Therefore, I was able to give a smile that was fresher than ever, holding back the tension.\n‘A vixen.’\nI couldn’t even properly perceive what I was saying because my head was in a mess.\n‘Did I get drunk from the wine I drank a while ago, or from the love I shared with Shael?’\nI couldn’t figure it out.\nThe only thing that came to my mind was the conviction that this kind of life would continue in the future.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to read more chapters, and you can also support me by donating at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "“Whooh…”\nI let out a heavy breath and put down the exercise equipment. It was my habit to exercise just before the sun started to rise.\nAfter becoming a duke, I was very busy, but I still didn’t stop.\n“Daddy, I want to go to Azbel Estate!”\n“Okay, let’s go today.”\nStill, after seeing Shael and Ruelle’s face, the fatigue in my whole body disappeared completely.\n“Oh, I want to visit the place where Mommy and Daddy got married!”\n“Since it was at the Holy Land, it would be difficult to go there right now.”\nRuelle pouted, then nodded her head and hugged me.\nI couldn’t help it. Because I was too busy to go to the Holy Land. Still, I should be able to go as far as the Azbel Estate.\n“I want to go…”\n“Then, I’ll replace it with a story for now.”\n“A story?”\nI had prepared many stories to satisfy Ruelle. They were about how we confessed again in front of the statue of the Goddess, and made a wish on a large tree.\nI passed on those memories to Ruelle.\nThanks to Ruelle’s lively reply, we were able to have a satisfying conversation with each other.\n“What was written on the wish attached to the tree?”\n“I wished to start a happy family together.”\nRuelle expressed her admiration with a sparkling gaze.\nThen I suddenly remembered something else. My wish was similar to Shael, but Shael had attached two wishes. Then what kind of wish did the other piece of paper have?\nI was curious about the answer. So I looked at Shael with a questioning gaze, and soon after, Shael noticed it.\nHowever, I didn’t get an answer right away.\n“I am very curious.”\n“No.”\nI wanted to find out somehow. Likewise, it had also sparked Ruelle’s curiosity.\n“Mommy, I want to know!”\nShael still respond with a silent refusal. W\nHowever, Ruelle, who was quick-witted, had her won methods when it came to dealing with Shael. Her bright eyes turned teary-eyed, and she said, “Hnng, I’m curious…”\nThe crying performance was excellent.\nIf it were me, I would have given everything to Ruelle while facing such a weapon.\nHowever, Shael’s personality was strong.\nNot even Ruelle’s cuteness could defeat Shael.\n* * *\nAfter finishing the happy conversation with my family, we began our preparation to leave the mansion.\nI gave some dessert to Shael and Ruelle and climbed the huge Baslett family’s carriage together.\nFrom now on, the day began in earnest.\nThe first task of the day was a visit from the Azbel family as Ruelle wanted.\nThe destination was soon in sight, and I looked at the Azbel family’s mansion, which was extremely familiar to me by now.\nBefore we even entered the mansion, we found Duke Jespen welcoming us with a wide smile. And his eyes were fixed on Ruelle.\n“Grandpa!”\n“Ruelle, you have grown so much since I last saw you!”\n“Didn’t you see me a week ago?”\n“Yeah, that’s right…. but in my world, it feels like years have passed.”\nDuke Jespen, who made a sentimental remark, hugged Ruelle. The smile did not disappear from his lips.\nAt the same time, he used most of his magic to cast a protective magic circle on Ruelle.\nDuke Jespen cared for Ruelle to an extreme level, and Ruelle too always reciprocated this with a smile and a display of cuteness.\n“Ruelle.”\nMadame Enella called Ruelle quietly. Ruelle left Duke Jespen’s hug and went to Duchess Enella.\n“Ru-Ruelle?”\nEven when Duke Jespen called for Ruelle with all his might, Ruelle was already in Madame Enella’s arms.\n“Keuk…”\nThen Duke Jespen brought out a thick book, and began to read. It was a book unlike anything I had read before.\nDespite such show of effort, I only offered a small silent prayer for Duke Jespen, who had Ruelle’s love taken away by Duchess Enella.\n“Ruelle. Do you know what this is?”\nDuke Jespen, who put the book away, took out a bribe. In his hand, there was now a box full of drawing tools that Ruelle would love.\n“Wow, I heard crayons!”\n“Yes, it is a gift, so accept it.”\nDuke Jespen seemed to be expecting Ruelle’s happy expression.\nJust looking at Ruelle’s smile would give him satisfaction, but it didn’t quite go according to what Duke Jespen had expected.\nIt was because Ruelle suddenly became busy with the crayons.\nWhile Duke Jespen was depressed, Ruelle was just scribbling here and there on a paper with a crayon.\n“It’s done!”\nFeeling rising anticipation, I looked at the picture drawn by Ruelle.\n“Uh, um… that’s really well drawn.”\n“Yes, Daddy!”\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to read more chapters, and you can also support me by donating at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "To be honest, the drawing wasn’t that good. When it came to drawing, Ruelle seemed to have inherited Shael’s talent.\nI could see some human figures, but I couldn’t tell who they were.\n“You draw very well, just like Shael. Especially, I feel good because you have drawn grandpa quite well.”\n“She’s Mommy…”\nDuke Jespen’s eyes widened.\nAnd Ruelle stared at the painting with a sullen expression on her face.\nIt was a major mistake on Duke Jespen’s part, so he hurriedly pointed to the other human figure of the picture.\n“Ah…it seems that I was distracted by your cuteness. Yes, I will be sure to get it right this time…”\nBut Ruelle’s mood didn’t improve.\n“Hing!” She made a cute sound and hugged Shael.\nMeaning that the Duke had again got it wrong.\nShael glared at Duke Jespen as if she was trying to scold him.\n“That, of course, this is Grandma.”\nRuelle’s expression turned more sullen, and she left Shael’s embrace.\nThe person where she arrived this time was me.\n“It’s father…”\nAnyway, it seemed that even Shael couldn’t decipher Ruelle’s picture correctly.\n‘My family is a bit unusual…’\nAfter that, I comforted Ruelle with my dessert. Then we went on a picnic with Shael and taught Ruelle how to make dessert. Of course, I was very careful when teaching Ruelle about dessert. I didn’t want to hand over my secret recipe to her.\nThat’s right, if Ruelle became better at making desserts than I was, controlling Shael’s dessert consumption would become difficult.\nAs we spent our time, the sun had gone down before I knew it.\nRuelle blinked her eyes and began to doze off in Shael’s embrace.\n“Alright, I will now have to take care of some paperwork.”\n“Please do your best and come back.”\nI stretched my stiff body, and walked towards my office on Baslett Mansion, which was only a short walk away.\nEverything in the office was luxurious. The desk was made of precious wood, and the chair was comfortable. The bookcase was huge, full of many rare books and documents.\nHowever, my own situation could only be said to be shabby.\nI let out a deep sigh. Paperwork from the family was piled up in front of me. It was something that had to be finished within today.\n‘Originally, I would’ve made a dessert for Ruelle in advance at this time of day before going to bed.’\nBut today I couldn’t, because the situation in the Baslett family had been very busy lately. The paperwork was really important, so I couldn’t pass them on to anyone.\nStill, I couldn’t shorten the time with Ruelle. Because I wanted to create happy memories that Ruelle, who was still young, would remember even when she grew up.\nWith that thought in my mind, I started working.\n* * *\nI suddenly opened my eyes.\n‘Did I fall asleep while doing the paperwork?’\nOf course, it didn’t matter because the work was completed to some extent. So now  I had to start exercising.\n‘Should I start playing with Ruelle right away?’\nMy body seemed to be screaming from exhaustion. Thinking about it, maybe my body had reached the breaking point, considering that I had been working till dawn every day and exercised in the morning.\nAnd when Shael, and Ruelle woke up, I spent time with my family.\n‘Still….’\nI relieved some of my fatigue by taking a short nap. Until now I had been able to endure thanks to my near superhuman body. So it should be fine today as well.\nI was already used to the current routine because it was repeated day after day. It was hard, but I could endure it because the mental happiness was greater than the fatigue.\nI made up my mind and started doing familiar things again. I worked out, and then I got ready to see Ruelle and Shael.\n“Ruelle can finally use healing magic.”\n“Daddy, look at this!”\nToday, my body was particularly tired.\n‘But…’\nJust looking at Ruelle and Shael seemed to dispel that thought.\nThe corners of my mouth, which had been pointing downward, gradually turned upward, and I was able to open my arms wide as usual.\nNevertheless, it seems that the gradually accumulating fatigue of the body had finally catching up.\n“What is…?”\n“Oh, Daddy?”\nMy eyelids were heavy, and my vision was foggy. I couldn’t even reply to my daughter’s worried voice. I couldn’t hear hear anything properly and my lips wouldn’t move.\nMy eyelids, which I tried so hard not to close, finally completely covered my pupils.\nThe only thing I could do was surrender myself to the rushing fatigue.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to read more chapters, and you can also support me by donating at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "I struggled to open my eyes.\nI felt something cold on my forehead. It seemed to be a wet towel that Shael had put on my forehead.\n‘Did I pass out?’\nI didn’t take care of my body properly and collapsed in front of my family.\nI felt sorry for Shael and Ruelle. It might have been a big shock to Ruelle, who was still young.\nI tried to quickly get up, and it was then that I felt something small in my arms.\n“Ruelle?”\nRuelle was sleeping in my arms. So I should be relieved, but I had no choice but to breathe out a sigh.\nBecause Ruelle, who always smiled when she slept, was frowning. That meant that she was shocked by my passing out.\n‘Let’s try not to wake her up…’\nI was trying to get up, but  I felt something again and I lowered my head. A warm stream of mana was emanating from the sleeping Ruelle’s hand.\n‘Come to think of it, I heard her say that she succeeded in using healing magic right before I passed out.’\nRuelle was continuing to use healing magic that she had barely succeeded in learning for me.\n‘My daughter, but she is so kind.’\n“Hnng, Daddy. Don’t die…”\nShe was even talking cutely in your sleep!\nI patted Ruelle’s head several times and calmed her mana down. I wanted to stay by The Ruelle’s side, but now I had to check on Shael. With that thought in mind, I got up from the bed.\n‘Where is Shael?’\nI had collapsed from overwork, so if it was Shael, she would have been as worried as Ruelle. She could have gone to buy all sorts of medicines, worrying a lot for nothing.\n‘So I have to find he quickly.’\nShe wasn’t in our bedroom with me, and it was the same in Ruelle’s bedroom. I also didn’t find her in the garden or in the dining room.\n“The Mistress is in the office!”\nAt last, I was able to find out where she was thanks to one of our maids.\n‘Why did she go to the office?’\nMaybe she was burning all the documents so that I wouldn’t be able to work in the future. That possibility, was extremely possible. Worried, I hurried to the office and opened the door.\nKikiiik…\nAs the maid said, Shael was in the office. She was sleeping with her chin resting on the desk.\nFortunately, there didn’t seem to be any trace of dangerous magic being used.\n‘Now what the hell is this?’\nA neatly arranged bundle of papers caught my eye. They were the paperwork I had to finish.\nAnd, a large amount of them were placed in front of Shael in a perfectly processed state.\nShael did all the work for me!\n“Hooo…”\nI checked one of the documents, and let out a sigh of admiration.\nShael’s skills were surprisingly good!\nI couldn’t pass the documents to anyone because it contained important information, but if it was Shael, I could trust her. Anyway, Shael went through all sorts of hardships because of me.\n“Umn…”\nShael was drooling in her sleep. And before I could even approach her, Shael’s eyes fluttered open.\n“Are you okay?”\n“That is something I should be asking you.”\nFor some reason, her current atmosphere reminded me of the Shael of the past. The atmosphere of a bloody villainess. But ironically, I found the atmosphere to be quite cute.\nIt was for that reason that I let out a foolish laugh, and asked, “Hmm, then what about the trash underneath?”\n“Stop exercising, I ate them all.”\nCanned food that contained ingredients which were good for muscles. I had been eating them in the past, but now they were all empty, and piled up on the floor.\n‘All my protein is gone!’\n* * *\n[Ruelle’s POV]\nSeveral years have passed.\nRuelle’s height grew rapidly, and her magic skills also showed tremendous development.\nShe has been using healing magic since she was five years old. After several years, she now had the ability to use all kinds of magic.\nAt the moment, Ruelle was wandering around the Holy Land alone.\n‘Daddy and Mom will be worried, but…’\nAnd she already missed her cute younger siblings. But since she wouldn’t be here for too long, it didn’t matter.\nAnyway, Ruelle was safe. She had brought many protective accessories, and in the first place, her own magic skills were excellent.\nToday, Ruelle’s goal was something special.\nIt was the paper that her mother had attached to the top of a huge tree in the Holy Land. Even thought a long time had passed, the paper with the wish written on it should be safe.\nAfter walking for a while, Ruelle finally saw the tree that her Mom and Daddy had visited in the past.\nIt was definitely a huge tree. It was an impossible height to reach without using magic.\n‘It should be at the very top.’\nA smile of anticipation bloomed on Ruelle’s face, and a magic circle appeared on her hand.\nRuelle quickly directed her gaze to the tree. She sifted through a bunch of papers with her vastly improved eyesight, then she tore off the one’s she was looking for.\nFinally, there were four papers in Ruelle’s hands.\nThey were the papers that her Daddy and Mom had written down their wishes on. She did find another piece of paper, but she didn’t pay much attention to it for now.\nRuelle immediately unfolded the papers.\nFirst of all, there was a wish written in her Daddy’s handwriting that said, [I wish to build a happy family together with Shael.]\nNext, a similar wish was written in her mother’s handwriting.\n‘Then next!’\nIt was the time to reveal her Mom’s long-hidden wish. So Ruelle quickly unfolded the paper.\n[Please make Eran’s wish come true.]\nIt was a wish that revealed her Mom’s shy heart. Even looking at her handwriting, it was evident that she wrote her letters in a hurry.\nOf course, Ruelle was a bit disappointed. She wanted to know her mother’s embarrassing secret.\nRuelle pursed her lips and returned the three papers to the top of the tree.\nNow she wanted to attach her own wish at the top of the tree. She wanted to attach her precious wishes next to the wishes written by her Mom and Daddy.\nBut before that, there was a pepper she hadn’t opened yet.\n“This?”\nShe unfolded all the papers that her Mom and Daddy had written. So it was clear that this paper belonged to someone else.\nGoblin:\nPlease consider becoming a Patron at Patreon to read more chapters, and you can also support me by donating at BuymeaCoffee!

      "content": "In fact, it would be proper for her to put it back in place without unfolding it, but Ruelle felt a strange urge to read it.\n“Eh, I’m curious!”\nRuelle boldly unfolded the paper.\nWhat she found was not some words, but several more sheets of wide paper inside the folded paper.\nIt was surprising that so many things could fit in the small piece of paper. So it was clear that the person who did it used the space magic.\nHowever, the moment she saw the writing on the papers, Ruelle opened her eyes wide in surprise.\n“My handwriting?”\nNo matter how you look at it, the writing on her paper was her own. However, Ruelle was confused. She had no memory of doing such a thing.\nRuelle quickly read the papers, feeling the outpouring interest.\nFirst of all, there were a few recipes.\nThey were recipes for making desserts. Very similar to the ones her Daddy made.\nNext, there was an instruction about forging a certain journal.\nRuelle don’t know why, but it said that she had to pass it on to someone.\nTo forge the said journal, it was necessary to carefully observe a certain someone’s handwriting.\nThe last one was about a golden pearl.\nThe pearl was supposed to have a very mysterious ability related to time. The information on the paper was about the location of the pearl, which was said to be the only one in existence, but if you destroyed a certain ‘bracelet with strong holy power’, you could produce another pearl with the fragments.\nRuelle read the paper again as if to engrave it in her head. And soon, a light shone in her eyes.\n‘It seems that I can personally observe the beginning of love between my Daddy and Mom.’\nThen, Ruelle turned around. She originally wanted to put the paper back on the top of the tree, but it seemed like it had to be postponed for a future time.\nNo, maybe it would be more correct to refer to it as the past.\n* * *\n[Daddy Eran’s POV]\nI looked at the sleeping Shael with her head tilted at an angle.\nThe sunlight was shining down on us, and even though my broad frame shaded her, Shael still had a frown on her face.\nTherefore, I hugged her and shaded her so she could sleep more comfortably.\n‘Where is Ruelle?’\nThen I subconsciously thought about Ruelle. She had suddenly disappeared a few weeks ago. Fortunately, she returned safely, but to be honest, there was no guarantee that such things wouldn’t happen in the future.\nThat said, it didn’t seem like nagging Ruelle would work. Because she was an adventurous kid.\nA while ago, she asked me for fragments of the ‘Bracelet of Holy Power’ that I had kept just in case, and she also kept staring at my handwriting every time I worked.\n‘Perhaps she’s just being curious…’\nIt wasn’t strange for her to leave the mansion alone at any time without an escort. So both me and Shael put a ridiculous amount of protective magic circles on her so that no one could hurt our Ruelle, and it was the same for Duke Jespen.\nThat’s why even if the strongest knight of the empire tried, he wouldn’t be able to harm Ruelle. Moreover, Ruelle herself had excellent skills in casting magic.\n‘Now that I think about it, Ruelle also possessed excellent dessert making skills.’\nHonestly, it was a bit suspicious.\nI did teach Ruelle about how to prepare desserts. However, I didn’t teach Ruelle the proper recipe for my dessert.\nBut since a few weeks ago, the desserts Ruelle made started to look like mine, and even tasted better than mine.\n‘Is it the difference in talent?’\nAnyway, it didn’t matter since Ruelle was now within my sight.\n“It’s so warm here!”\nRuelle, who was now quite tall, walked over, along with the two other children following behind her.\nThe first was a girl with blue hair and sky blue eyes, and then a boy with sky blue heir and blue eye.\nTo me and Shael, they were the most precious treasures. The rewards of our two lifetimes of suffering.\nAnyway, I couldn’t believe that Ruelle could stay away from home without my knowledge, leaving such cute younger siblings behind.\n“Come here!”\nThe children ran into my embrace in perfect order.\nI showed a satisfied smile. It was because the shade that had been covering Shael had grown larger.\n“Daddy!”\nI lowered my head at Ruelle’s cute voice.\nShael and the other children were sleeping, and Ruelle was giving me a curious look.\n“Daddy, did you and Mom have a good relationship from the beginning?”\n“Of course. After all, I promised to marry her from the beginning.”\nActually, it was really bad, but I couldn’t tell that to Ruelle. Because it might be too shocking for her\n“I see!”\nI heard Ruelle’s giggling laughter for some reason, but she ended the conversation by hugging her entire family.\nAt some point, white clouds began to block the sun, putting us all in its shade.\nAfter some time, Ruelle also closed her eyes, and I started stroking the whole family on the head one by one.\nAfter doing this, I felt rather calm. If someone smiled at my touch, it also made me smile.\n“I’m not a kid, so why do you keep stroking my hair?”\nShael woke up at some point and pouted her lips. But contrary to what she said, Shael didn’t reject my touch.\nShe simply stretched out her hand, and started stroking my hair, as if she didn’t want to lose to me.\nWe continued our gentle touches as if we were having a competition about who would give up stroking first.\nShael glared at me, and I looked down at Shael with a deep smile.\nShael had a strong competitive spirit, so she wouldn’t give up that easily. But soon she nodded her head and dozed off, then woke up shaking her head as if she didn’t want to lose this strange competition.\nThe funny actions were repeated over and over again, but in the end, we stopped. There was no loser, as Shael and I both ended up winning the competition.\nThat’s why Shael and I were able to fall into a blissful sleep, with our smiles as our reward.\nAuthor’s Review:\nHello, this is Odanti.\nRehabilitating the Villainess has finally come to an end.\nI still can’t believe this situation right now as I’m writing a review after finishing a novel. I experienced a lot of things while writing the first novel for the first time in my life.\nFrom the beginning to the end, there were many things that I was unsatisfied with.\nWhenever I found something lacking while reading the comments, I tried to note it down, but the amount was disastrously large.\nI was worried, but I’m really proud that I finally finished writing the story.\nThank you so much for sticking with me until the end, even though it was a novel that showed my immaturity here and there!\nYou are supposed to write what you feel while writing a review, but I find it quite difficult.\nAnyway, I will just talk about what comes next.\nOf course, I will continue to write without folding. I don’t know if I have talent as a writer, but my enthusiasm for writing definitely makes up for what I lack as a writer.\nSo I’ve been thinking a lot about my next project…(he talks about his plans for his next novel. Not relevant for us.)\nI’ll end it here.\nI hope to see the readers again someday, and hope that only happy things will happen to the readers.\nThank you!\nTranslator’s Review:\nRehabilitate the Villainess is the first novel I have translated completely since the time I decided to step foot on this path. Honestly, just like the author my head feels empty. I can’t seem to find anything to say.\nFor me, this novel is more than just a project. Something more than just written words on the pages. It helped me when I was going through a terrible time of my life by connecting me with some of the most kindest people on earth. Those people decided to support a complete stranger on the other side of the internet, just because they liked to read this novel, just because they wanted to keep a sinking stranger afloat.\nSo yes. I am without words. I just want to thank you all for your support. I know I say this quite a lot, but I really mean it every time I say it. Every bit of your support have helped, and still helping me survive. So the only way I can express my feelings is by doing a better job, and saying thank you.\nNow for the future. I will be removing RTV Level 2 and RTV Level 3 from the patreon page. The RTV Level 1 will be changed into a $5 RTV Appreciation option available on the page for those who wants to keep supporting me.\nThe next project that will take RTV’s place will probably be– I Picked Up an Amnesiac Witch (IPUAW).\nThis is an interesting novel with regression, romance and fantasy elements. There is a harem, but it’s quite well written. The romance is a big focus of this novel so I think it will be a good read for the most of us.\nSee you all at the next chapter release.\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website. Come back and continue reading tomorrow, everyone!",
