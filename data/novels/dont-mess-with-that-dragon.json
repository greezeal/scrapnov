      "content": "Chapter 1: Chapter 1: The Wandering Kobold\nAfter the rain, the forest became even more sweltering, and the air was filled with a rotten smell, the decay emanating from leaves falling on the ground and decomposing rapidly by microorganisms. Mosquitoes, flies buzzing all around, emerged from damp corners, leaving a swollen bite that was both painful and itchy.\nVini, the Kobold leader, wandered despondently through the woods, ignoring the mosquitoes biting him. He leaned on a bone that was half the height of a person, pushing aside huge saw-like scythes to open a path forward, his tattered clothes marked with blood.\nBehind him followed six or seven Kobolds, all looking emaciated and dispirited. One among them was a mother, cradling an infant Kobold that had only been born a few months ago.\nKobolds grow quickly, reaching a developmental stage akin to two or three-year-old human children within months; they can speak and walk, but the journey was tough. The Kobold mother bore the fatigue and carried the child in her arms.\nThis was a ragged crew fleeing desperately, enveloped in a shroud of sorrow, uncertain of where the future lay. Even the little Kobold sensed the unease, timidly gazing at the unfamiliar woods. With the adults silent, she dared not speak, only clinging tightly to her mother, hungry after a day without food, she pretended to eat by nibbling on her finger.\nThe Kobold mother was clearly malnourished, her body frail and skinny. Feeling the child move in her arms, she knew it was hunger. She rummaged through her pocket and took out a shrunken green fruit.\nThe young Kobold’s eyes initially brightened, but upon seeing the shriveled Kawa fruit in her mother’s hand, she turned away in disappointment. The fruit was bitter and astringent, barely better than tree roots; she simply couldn’t swallow it.\nThe Kobold mother appeared somewhat at a loss, powerless amidst her emaciated frame.\nWalking ahead, Vini witnessed this scene, his dog head drooping down,\nhis heart plummeted to an all-time low.\nThis group of Kobolds originally belonged to a Beastman Tribe settled over a hundred miles away in a northern forest. Though their status was barely better than slaves, they could at least survive by eating coarse grains and vegetables.\nHowever, due to the power struggles among the tribe’s upper echelon, they were discarded like pawns and forced out, left to find a means of survival elsewhere.\nYet the outside world proved even harsher, with ferocious Magic Beasts, hostile living conditions, and extreme scarcity of food pushing these Kobolds to their limits.\n\"There’s a lake ahead. We’ll rest there and then look for food.\"\nUpon hearing Vini’s words, the Kobolds breathed a sigh of relief. After such a long trek, they were exhausted.\nPassing through the bushes, the Kobolds arrived at the lakeside. The lake was small, just the size of a pond. Through the clear water, one could see many fish swimming beneath. But no Kobold dared to enter the water to fish, even drawing water was done carefully at the edge.\nThis lake was too calm, and based on past experiences, the calmer a place, the greater the danger it conceals.\nThe lakeside was densely populated with towering trees of unknown species. Vini led a few young and barely robust Kobolds to search for food in the surroundings, not daring to venture too far.\nMeanwhile, the Kobold mother with her child and an elderly Kobold with a leg injury stayed behind, gathering dry twigs, lighting a fire, and ceremoniously using their tribe’s most precious possession, a stone-carved stone bowl, to boil water.\nA temporary camp was established by clearing away the grass, which could easily cut like saw blades.\n\"Mama, where are we going?\"\nWhen the Kobold mother had lit the fire and boiled the water in the stone bowl, and everything was in place, the young Kobold finally voiced her timid question.\n\"Don’t worry, Nina, we’re going to a wonderful place. Once we get there, we’ll never go hungry again.\"\nThe Kobold mother gently touched the little Kobold named Nina and said softly.\n\"Then can we have bones to eat every day?\"\nNina’s eyes widened, reflecting the sunlight with bright pupils, causing drool to trickle down her mouth.\nWhat’s referred to as bones were the last remnants of meat the crew had ten days ago, actually just bones left over from a hunt long ago, crushed into a tough paste.\nBack then, the Kobold mother, malnourished, couldn’t produce breast milk and had to forcibly wean Nina. That was the most delicious meal Nina had since she started eating solid food, having to rely on those bitter and astringent Kawa fruits thereafter.\n\"Yes, we’ll have bones to eat every day, and we’ll never go hungry again.\"\nThe Kobold mother’s nose tingled with sentiment as she pulled Nina over, clutching her tightly in her arms. Behind Nina’s sight, tears streamed from the eyes of the gaunt-faced Kobold mother.\nShe couldn’t tell the child that she didn’t know what lay ahead, that they might die of hunger tomorrow from lack of food or stumble into some Magic Beast’s domain and become prey, nor cry in front of the child, holding her desperately instead.\nThe old Kobold with the broken leg watched this scene dumbfoundedly, a hint of sadness crossing his gaze as well.\nThis is the plight of the weak in the Kawa Forest, doomed to the uncertainty of life, struggling every day at the survival line, particularly for this group of loser Kobolds, consisting mostly of the old, weak, sickly, and injured, without knowing where they might disappear into the forest.\n\"They’re back!\"\nNot long after, Vini and the other Kobolds who went out to forage returned elatedly, carrying several plump, gray rabbits. The rabbits struggled constantly, but Vini clutched them securely, while the tribe members bore unknown fruits hanging from their bodies.\nThey couldn’t help but rejoice, for the forest near this lake was a treasure trove, allowing them to finally have a full meal after half a month.\nAfter a hearty meal, the Kobolds lay scattered on the ground, enjoying the rare bliss of being well-fed, while the nearby firelight flickered.\nVini lazily lay on the grass, basking in the sun, a piece of foxtail grass in his mouth.\n\"Perhaps we should just stay here. This place is simply a paradise, with fruits everywhere, rotting on the trees. Those gray rabbits are so dumb, easily catching several at a time. This place is truly like heaven!\"\nVini chewed the foxtail grass, his dog head riddled with concern.\nHowever, such a treasure land could hardly be claimed by such a weak group as them. Were there no ferocious, predatory Magic Beasts nearby?\nThinking of this, having just regained strength after being fed, Vini used the Kobolds’ Talent Ability, sniffing the air.\nOne sniff was enough to send Vini into a sudden leap, as his nose led him to gaze toward a towering ancient tree, dozens of meters high beside them.\n\"Oh, finally discovered? Hmm, little Kobolds have you entered my domain, did you have my permission?\"\nAn ancient, solemn voice with a trace of ridicule reverberated like thunder in the air, oppressive and overwhelming like a mountain on Vini, forcing him to lie on the ground trembling all over.\nAtop the towering tree’s branches, that shadow unfurled enormous wings, casting a bluish glow, lightning arcs sparking across the fearsome Scale Armor, the giant wings eclipsing the sunlight, casting a vast shadow over the whole group of Kobolds!",

      "content": "Chapter 2: Chapter 2 Blue Dragon Austin\n\"Dragon! Dragon! Dragon!\"\nAll the kobolds were crushed to the ground by the oppressive dragon’s might, their entire bodies trembling violently due to an instinctive fear that occupied their minds, leaving their dog-like heads completely blank.\nThe kobold leader, Vini, felt as if his heart had dropped into an icy abyss in the dead of winter, cold seeping from the inside out, bringing him unparalleled despair!\nThey’re going to die; fleeing this far only to end up with such a result.\nIn addition to despair, Vini felt an indescribable bitterness; no wonder this place was so peaceful, no wonder the food was so abundant yet no fierce hunters were in sight, it turns out this was a dragon’s territory!\nIn the past, with their keen sense of smell, they would have naturally detected the dragon’s scent before entering this territory. Unfortunately, exhausted and ravenous from barely escaping, they had no energy left for caution.\nRegrettably, it’s too late to say anything now.\nEverything is over!\nJust as Vini the kobold leader closed his eyes to await death, the Blue Dragon Austin spread his membranous wings on a giant tree, whipping up a gust of wind before lightly landing on the ground.\n\"I’m asking you, little kobolds, dare to trespass in my territory, are you ready to be eaten?\"\nThe gigantic Blue Dragon looked down with a trace of mockery in his voice.\nEven though he was only born for less than two years and was still in his juvenile phase, his body had unscathed grown close to two meters tall, standing before these frail kobolds like a massive beast, capable of easily tearing them apart.\n\"No, no, no, Dragon, dear Dragon... we, we...\"\nUnder the pressure to survive, Vini forced his dog head to raise, his brain working at an unprecedented speed to find an excuse for the situation, and suddenly, his mind lit up.\n\"Dear Dragon, we are here to seek allegiance to you! Your renown has spread throughout the Forest Land, and we, admiring your fame, have finally arrived in your domain after many hardships, hoping to pledge ourselves under your command and become your retainers...\"\nThe kobold leader, Vini, thought quickly on his feet, speaking smoothly for once, puffing out his chest as if sincerely loyal and eager to be taken under protection.\nAustin circled around the kobold leader Vini with interest, his gaze causing a cold sweat to break out on the kobold.\nAs for what this guy said, Austin didn’t believe a word.\nTwo years ago, he was just a nerd earning a meager salary in a concrete jungle, enjoying reading novels and idling his days away, until one day, he woke up in a cold, dark place. After struggling to break through a white wall, he discovered, to his astonishment, he had transformed into a creature.\nA Blue Young Dragon,\nThe moment he saw sunlight, the Dragon Race heritage told him his name, Austin.\nWhat had become of his unreliable parents, and why had they left a Dragon Egg in a cold, grassy corner? Austin had little room for such thoughts. For the past two years, his sole focus had been on survival in this world.\nThough the Dragon Race’s inherited memories told him that dragons were life forms favored by the Divine, destined to become rulers of the sky even if they idled around for a hundred years, that was a matter for adulthood.\nNo creature is particularly strong in its young age, and when Austin had just hatched, having polished off the egg shell, he might have managed to emit a one or two-volt current at best, possessing the combat prowess of nothing more than a small cat from his previous life, and a pet cat at that.\nTo survive, for two years Austin remained cautious, stealing bird eggs, gnawing on tree bark, engaging in all manners of sneaky, underhanded acts, even resorting to eating dirt when driven by hunger, thus living the once-proud Blue Dragon’s life as the disgrace of the Dragon Race.\nHow could he possibly have gained a good reputation in such circumstances? Moreover, wary of the endless emergence of magic beasts in the forest, Austin’s activities during these two years were confined to a ten-mile radius. It wasn’t until his body rapidly grew, gaining some combat ability, that he began clearing out nearby beasts, claiming around a one-kilometer territory.\nAnd as for these kobolds at hand, it was obvious they’d strayed into his territory in their flight.\n\"Should I just get rid of them?\"\nAs he gazed at the kobolds crouched on the ground, this thought flashed through the mind of Blue Dragon Austin.\nHis smooth growth to this point was inseparable from his discreet development strategy.\nWere news of a Blue Young Dragon’s presence in a certain area to spread, those seeking the title of \"Dragon Hunter,\" not to mention the forest’s magic beasts eager to taste dragon meat, would not hesitate to come and devour him whole, bone and all...\nReflecting on that terrifying imagery, Austin’s gaze towards the kobolds became even deeper, causing Vini to lower his dog head further.\nFortunately, Austin ultimately decided against killing them.\nHe spread his membranous wings, his voice filled with dragon’s might resonating in the air:\n\"Very well, I accept your allegiance, but you must know that only those with value are worthy of my protection. If one day you fail to show your value, you’ll be eaten, understood?\"\nHis menacing head moved directly in front of kobold leader Vini, fine sparks dancing over the ghostly blue scales, leaving Vini petrified with his mind blank.\n\"Un-understood!\"\n\"Good, follow me!\"\nAustin spread his wings, flapping powerfully to create a gale on the ground, lifting his entire body into the sky.\nHe didn’t look back at the newly acquired retainers, but he sensed their exhilaration as they eagerly followed his shadow through the forest, rushing towards the Dragon’s Nest.\nIn the Dragon Race’s inherited memories, kobolds are among the continent’s lowest classes, where even a massive tribe of thousands seeking allegiance to a dragon would face disdain, let alone these few scattered individuals.\nFor these bottom-tier races struggling for survival, becoming a strong entity’s vassal is considered a blessing.\nAustin’s acquisition of these retainer subordinates was not out of sympathy; he certainly had his reasons.\nPerhaps there was the inclination of having struggled alone for two years, of feeling something upon seeing intelligent life.\nBut more than that, it was Austin’s striving for strength development.\n\"Blood Wolf pack, you are done for!\"\nThinking of those loathsome enemies, a flicker of deep light flashed through Austin’s pupils.",

      "content": "Chapter 3: Chapter 3 The Art of Management\nBlood Wolves, a large group of beasts roaming the nearby forest, numbering in the hundreds, led by the Blood Wolf Leader, which has already entered the domain of low-tier magic beasts.\nA year ago, when Austin was out hunting, he nearly fell prey to that pack of Blood Wolves. It was the most dangerous moment in Austin’s life as a dragon, and he holds a deep-seated memory of that pack of Blood Wolves.\nIn the past year, Austin had several encounters with that pack of Blood Wolves but was always forced to flee in embarrassment.\nIf it were one-on-one, Austin has ninety percent confidence in snapping the neck of the Blood Wolf Leader, let alone a regular Blood Wolf.\nHowever, every time the Blood Wolves move, they come in droves, making it impossible for Austin to fight them alone, which has only increased his hatred for them day by day.\nMoreover, the rampage of this Blood Wolf pack has severely affected the nearby ecology, forcing Austin to find a way to eliminate them.\nAnd these Kobolds will become Austin’s best soldiers to deal with those beasts!\nOf course, that is after the Kobolds have undergone military training.\nAustin flew ahead, leading the group of Kobolds to a more hidden cliff bottom.\nThis is a steep cliff, with trees densely covering the vertical cliff face, hundreds of meters high, hiding a very secretive cave entrance amid the foliage that one cannot see without careful observation.\nThat is Austin’s lair. Standing at the cave entrance and looking out, one can have a panoramic view of the vast green sea forest, with an exceptionally pleasant view.\nThe six or seven Kobolds enthusiastically became the first batch of Austin’s clan, building their new home at the foot of the cliff.\n...\nTime flew by, and ten days passed quickly.\nIn the initial few days, Austin didn’t have any requirements for the Kobolds, letting them settle in by themselves.\nThe Kobolds first found many dry branches from the forest and used them to build a simple wooden hut on a giant ancient tree over a hundred meters tall. The ground was infested with snakes, insects, and rodents, making it unsuitable for living, especially during rainy days when the whole house could easily collapse into the mud.\nThen, they covered the top of the tree branches with thatch, thus creating a temporary dog den, looking like a messy nest growing on the tree.\nOf course, this is only a temporary transitional house. If they truly settle down, they will naturally build better ones in the future.\nUnder the simple settlement, Nina tiptoed and labored to help her mother hang the giant vines on the trees to dry.\nThese are the items Austin ordered to be collected. Although the Kobolds didn’t know why the Blue Dragon wanted these things gathered, as the lord and master of the Kobolds, they just obeyed orders.\nFor this one and only command from the Dragon so far, the Kobolds did well, deliberately bringing back old vines whenever they went out to gather resources.\n\"Mom, will we live here forever?\"\nSeparating the crossed vines, Nina’s small hands suddenly slowed down as she whispered to her mother.\n\"Hmm, Nina?\"\nThe Kobold mother turned her head inexplicably and found Nina looking back at her, her eyes earnest as she said:\n\"Mom, I like it here. Let’s live here with the Dragon from now on, okay?\"\nBecause Austin could regularly eliminate predators within a kilometer or two, food was abundant nearby, with various fruits and numerous small herbivorous animals. Every time the Kobold leader led the clan out, they returned fully loaded.\nAlthough according to the customary rules on the Seta Continent, clans must turn over at least eighty percent of their harvest to the lord, even the remaining twenty percent is far better than their life during their wandering days.\nAs for the Kobolds wisely turning over their harvest, Austin did not refuse. Even though the Kobold’s contributions were negligible to him, and they struggled to survive on the remaining twenty percent; Austin still accepted it.\nBecause it concerns an art of management.\nIn his previous life, Austin had heard a classic case.\nTwo startups, one offered ten thousand a month salary when hiring employees. Since this salary was higher than the average of three thousand, initially, employees were very grateful to the boss and worked hard. But a year later, with no salary increase, employees were less grateful, and two years later, when the company decided to lower the salary to eight thousand due to management issues, employees became generally dissatisfied, worked passively, and some even considered resigning, even though the monthly salary was still far above the market average.\nThe other startup offered a starting salary of three thousand but raised it every six months. Employees were very grateful, and two years later, the salary increased to eight thousand. When the company faced difficulties, employees worked together to help the company overcome them.\nIn both two-year scenarios, with the same final salary and encountering difficulties, the situations were vastly different, demonstrating the art of management.\nThe same applies now; Austin could have outright refused the \"taxes\" he deemed insignificant, but that would plant a seed of discord in his future rule.\nOf course, the Kobolds had no idea about the Blue Dragon’s thoughts.\nIn the dark, they were immensely grateful to Austin, feeling incredibly fortunate to have encountered the incredibly benevolent Blue Dragon.\nAccording to customary rules on the Seta Continent, clans must turn over at least eighty percent of their harvest. In other places, it’s often ninety percent or even ninety-five percent or more.\nIn the Beastman Tribe where this group of Kobolds once lived, they had to turn over every last bit of their harvest to the tribal chief.\nCompared to that, Lord Austin seemed like a father deity incarnate, a Divine Envoy sent by heaven to save them.\n\"Nina doesn’t want to eat those bitter and astringent Tsumu berries, doesn’t want to eat those tree barks, and doesn’t want to sleep in those cold and damp hay piles...\"\nNina timidly looked at her mother, whispering.\nFor Nina, the past few days had been the happiest of her life, like a dream.\nLiving in a house felt so comfortable, and filling her stomach felt like this; the world’s best-tasting thing wasn’t bones, but something called meat...\nSince she could remember, they had been fleeing, living a life of hunger and uncertainty.\nNina didn’t understand what being part of a clan meant; she just didn’t want to return to the past and hoped such days would last forever.\n\"Nina...\"\nThe Kobold mother bent down, holding Nina in her arms, wanting to say something but unable to find the words, her voice somewhat choked.\nDays slowly passed by ordinarily without any conflict or war.\nWith ample food, the Kobold group grew stronger after nearly a month of rest and recovery, no longer appearing as gaunt as they did a month ago.\nAnd once the Kobolds had recuperated, Austin began his military training plan.",

      "content": "Chapter 4: Chapter 4 Training (Part 1)\nA month later, when the group of Kobolds had recovered considerably and settled under the Dragon’s Nest, Austin chose a sunny day to gather all the Kobolds.\n\"From the moment you decided to become my Clan, your life and death were no longer your own. As you enjoy my protection, you must also pay an adequate price. I do not need worthless individuals. If you wish to stay here, you must show your value!\"\nWith azure wings unfurled, coupled with a domineering declaration, Austin began the first step of training his Clan.\nThe memories from the Dragon’s Race inheritance told him that the area he was in was the Kawa Forest in the southern part of the Seta Continent, covering millions of square kilometers. The dreadful tropical rainforest climate halted the advance of the vast northern human territories, and even the Elves, who loved forests, abandoned this massive Kawa Forest as a discarded shoe.\nThis was a land of savagery, an untamed wilderness with rampant Magic Beasts in the deep forest. Only the lowest beast tribes, money-loving Adventurers, and bankrupt wanderers from the war-torn Civilized Land would come to the edges of the Kawa Forest seeking a living. The activity of intelligent beings slowly eroded this vast, endless forest.\nAustin knew very well that the dangers of this world were far beyond imagination. Even with a mature soul inside, it was a result of his own hard struggle that he had grown to this point as a Blue Young Dragon.\nAs age and physical development demands grow, the food and materials like Magic Crystals that Austin needs for growth will become increasingly large.\nOn this Seta Continent, the growth needs of dragon hatchlings are typically the responsibility of adult Dragons. However, Austin was just a Young Dragon that emerged from a Dragon Egg thrown into a bush corner by some irresponsible parents, and everything in the future could only depend on himself.\nDuring the immature stage of dragons, the variety of magic-power-containing resources needed for growth was astronomically high. As a Young Dragon, its combat power simply wasn’t enough for a dragon cub to collect independently, and Austin was no exception.\nFor the sake of future growth and to eradicate those detestable Blood Wolves from his territory, Austin had no choice but to rely on the strength of his subordinates.\n\"No choice, who told me to be an orphan dragon? I’ll have to build my own army.\"\nAustin knew very well that compared to other intelligent beings or powerful Magic Beasts, his biggest advantage before becoming an adult was the memories of his past life.\nThose modern scientific military training methods, knowledge of scientific industrial civilization, gunpowder and other weapons...\nOf course, the only thing he could use right now was the method for training an army.\nFrom the inherent Dragon Race memory, Austin learned that the combat mode between races in this world was still at a Western Middle Ages level from his past life.\nEven if there were Warrior Mages with Extraordinary Abilities on the Seta Continent, when two Lords went to war, except for a small elite core troop, most of the army consisted of peasants, who not long ago were working the land, using manure forks for brute force combat, engaging in peasant skirmishes.\nPerhaps those powerful Kingdoms on the northern Civilized Lands would perform differently, but here in the Kawa Forest, with equal combat power, a disciplined army could sweep through the defeated and homeless scattered throughout the forest.\n\"The strength of the masses is limitless, and combined with the Extraordinary Power of this Magical World, if organized into a disciplined army, I can establish a foothold in the vast Kawa Forest. As for firearms, gunpowder, industrialization, and so forth, at least a stable base is needed for development.\"\nIt was precisely because of this that Austin placed great importance on training his first group of Clan members.\nIf he could cultivate them into an army with a modern sense of discipline, it would be like planting a seed. In the future, as the followers increased, they could continuously grow based upon this foundation.\n\"This small step is the first giant leap in my conquest of the Seta Continent!\"\nAustin was brimful with confidence and ambition.\nThen, very quickly, he wilted.\nReality proved that Austin oversimplified some things.\nThis was a painful realization that he reached after a morning of shouting, becoming hoarse from yelling in anger and frustration.\nIn the medieval era, it wasn’t unreasonable for lords to drive peasants, armed with manure forks and untrained, onto the battlefield.\nThose peasants, who labored day in and day out, with minds full only of surviving, were oppressed by their lives into stupidity and ignorance, unable to read scripts or understand orders. Cultivating their sense of discipline was as hard as training a Knight from childhood.\n\"Do you have crap in your heads? How many times do I have to repeat it! Why can’t you tell left from right?\"\nAustin jumped in exasperation, roaring loudly.\nThe Kobolds below trembled in fear, yet it availed nothing.\nTurning around ended in a mess, marching in step turned into chaos.\nPreviously, Austin didn’t understand what chaos meant, but now he did.\nHaving seven Kobolds stand in a line and take two steps forward resulted in chaos.\nMost aggravatingly, the Kobolds trembled when scolded loudly, but they would forget all instructions once turned around.\nAustin was so angry, he multiple times contemplated biting them to death.\nThe first day’s training was extremely ineffective, with absolutely no progress.\nAs the sun set, that evening, after a day of torment, Austin returned to his lair, lay inside the cave, and gazed hopelessly at the starry sky beyond.\nWhen reading novels in the past, it seemed easy seeing the Protagonist train an army, flipping to the next Chapter for it to be complete. But experiencing it personally, he truly realized the difficulty involved.\nSometimes Austin wished he had a system in his body, something like a game, where just a touch of his finger would bring forth a well-trained army.\nUnfortunately, he didn’t.\nOnce again, Austin missed the days on Earth, doing his job, with nothing to worry about, just aimlessly muddling through life would be so nice.\nHe didn’t know which irresponsible guy brought him here, not only struggling daily but even trying to do one thing was so hard.\n\"I’ve taken note of this grudge, and if I ever meet them, I will surely castrate them, hmph.\"\nAustin snorted as he lay on the ground, snickering internally.\n\"Great Dragon, are you there?\"\nAt this moment, from below the cave’s entrance, a tender voice called out. Austin poked his head out to see the only Kobold child among his Clan, Nina, holding something in one hand and struggling to climb up using a tree branch at the cliff’s edge with the other hand.",

He then stretched his neck and picked her up into his mouth.\nWhen that fearsome dragon head got close, Nina was visibly scared for a moment, but soon calmed down, allowing Austin to carry her into the Dragon’s Nest.\nAs soon as she landed, Nina curiously looked around.\nIt was a massive cave about eight or nine meters high, with a smoothed-out ceiling and a floor covered with a layer of dry twigs. On top of the twigs was a layer of dry straw, forming a simple dragon nest.\nNina appeared somewhat disappointed because, in her imagination, a dragon’s nest should be wealthy, with gold and silver everywhere, surrounded by sparkling clear crystals.\nBut this dragon nest before her was evidently quite poor.\n\"Hey, kid, what’s that look in your eyes? Why are you here? Hurry up and speak, or else I’ll change my mind and swallow you. Aren’t you really afraid I’ll eat you?\"\nAustin discontentedly snorted, baring his teeth and claws, grumbling.\n\"No, because Master Dragon is a kind dragon.\"\nNina said in a timid voice.\n\"Hahaha, a kind dragon. Kid, if you spread those words around, you’d probably get laughed to death by the next day!\"\nAustin burst into laughter. In this world, although dragons aren’t considered great villains, they definitely aren’t seen as kind. It’s not uncommon for adult dragons to vent their displeasure by wiping out a human village for fun, especially for him, one of the Blue Dragons, deemed wicked among the Five-Colored Dragons.\n\"Tell me, where am I kind?\"\nAustin looked down mockingly at this anxious little kid.\n\"I, I...\"\nNina stood there with folded hands, appearing uneasy, like a pupil who had done wrong before a teacher.\n\"Forget it, if there’s nothing else, just get lost.\"\nSeeing Nina’s appearance reminded Austin of today’s unpleasant memories. Those stupid kobolds acted the same way after making a mistake. For a moment, Austin lost interest in teasing this little kobold any further.\nSo he waved a paw at her, making a gesture to shoo her away.\n\"Well...\"\nNina took a deep breath, brought out a small piece of cooked ash-grey rabbit meat wrapped in leaves, and handed it to Austin.\n\"Master Dragon, everyone disappointed you today. I’m here to apologize.\"\nNina looked at the small piece of meat in her hand, her eyes clearly filled with reluctance, but she had brought it out.\nIt must have been her portion of the food. To Austin, it might just be enough to stick between his teeth, but to her, it was the most precious food she valued, specifically saved.\nPerhaps in her world, meat was the thing that could make people happy and forget their worries. As long as they ate meat, it would make Master Blue Dragon forget those unhappy things, and it would make everyone happy.\n\"This damn world...\"\nThinking of the children from his previous life, spoiled by their parents and unaware of hardships, then looking at Nina, struggling for survival since birth and finally settling down amidst precarious winds and rains, Austin couldn’t help but curse inwardly.\n\"Alright, I’m not angry at all, you can take it back.\"\nAustin waved his paw, showing an indifferent attitude toward that small piece of meat.\n\"Then Master Dragon won’t drive us away?\"\nNina’s eyes lit up, like stars, her tone filled with joy.\n\"Hmph, I’ve protected you all for over a month now. If I drive you away now, wouldn’t I be at a huge loss? During these days, you’ve been eating my food and using my resources in my territory, don’t think of leaving before I break even!\"\nAustin lifted his head, speaking with a lofty and proud tone.\n\"Thank you, Master Dragon!\"\nIn her exhilaration, Nina tiptoed and planted a kiss on one of Austin’s scales, then blushing furiously, she dashed away.\nThough the cliff was steep, it was full of trees growing on its surface, with branches crossing each other. Austin, used to walking on it before learning to fly, had already paved a path.\nWatching as Nina safely descended to the ground via that path formed by the intertwined tree branches, Austin also retracted his neck.\n\"Damn it! I’m a transmigrator from the Celestial Dynasty, a great scholar who has read through volumes of books, I refuse to believe I can’t train these soldiers!\"\nAlthough frustrated over the day’s training results, Austin forced himself to sleep.\nReflecting on the day’s events, perhaps he was too aggressive initially. For this, he had already come up with a solution.\nThe next day, training continued.\nBut unlike the first day, the second day’s training focused solely on building foundations, with only one training content: standing at attention.\nFrom the lessons of the previous day, Austin deeply understood that one must learn to stand before learning to walk.\nStanding at attention served both to straighten out the kobolds’ lazy habits and to initially instill a sense of teamwork among them.\nAustin didn’t forget to provide incentives, such as reducing the day’s harvest submission if they stood at attention for a few hours. With this condition introduced, the kobolds’ training efficiency increased by more than fifty percent.\nWith incentives and pressure, this standing at attention was trained for a full three days.\nAfter three days of training, the seven kobolds finally managed to stand with a semblance of murderous aura, though it was just for show, as they would fall apart the moment they moved.\nThe next step was to teach these foolish kobolds to recognize left and right.\nThis was extremely challenging for illiterate kobolds, who would forget it in an instant even after several repetitions. Despite all of Austin’s intimidating and enticing efforts, it was to no avail.\nIn the end, the solution came from a humorous anecdote Austin recalled from his past life. During the revolutionary period, recruited farmer soldiers always confused left and right, until a general made them take off their left shoe, with the left foot barefoot and the right foot shod, allowing them to quickly grasp directions.\nTo deal with the kobolds, Austin employed this method, with a modification, by tying a vine around each kobold’s left hand for training.\nThe third step was marching. With the foundation of the previous two steps, this step was much easier. After a few days of effort, the kobolds at last learned to march neatly, moving more like a squad of professional soldiers.\nThis adjustment proved remarkably effective, embedding the recognition of left and right into the kobolds’ instincts within days.\nThe fourth step, the final one, was practicing with wooden spears, learning a few simple offensive and defensive maneuvers. Thanks to the previous foundational work, this military training was evidently more successful than before.\nQuickly, the kobolds became proficient and practiced well.\nIn this manner, nearly a month passed swiftly.\nIn that wide forest clearing, the kobolds lined up in neat rows, gripping wooden spears, striking and retracting in unison, exuding an aura of disciplined bravery.\nAfter nearly a month’s effort, Austin’s first troop was finally trained and formed.",

      "content": "Chapter 6: Chapter 5 Before the Cold Winter\nThe kobold troops Austin put tremendous effort into creating, how capable are they in combat, even Austin himself is unsure. But at the very least, they exude a formidable presence when they simply stand there.\nEven when compared to those elite knight orders on the civilized land, the well-trained demeanor of this group of kobolds does not fall short in the slightest.\nOf course, Austin knows well that the formation of any army requires a trial by blood; only an army nurtured through bloodshed is truly elite.\nWhile Austin was pondering this issue, the kobold leader Vini cautiously approached him.\n\"Master Austin, the cold winter will arrive in just a few days. Could we halt the training for a few days as we need to store enough food before the cold winter sets in?\"\nThe kobold leader Vini, appearing troubled, spoke as he approached Austin.\nThe continuous training over the past month had already impacted the kobolds’ production activities, even though Austin reduced a significant portion of the yield they had to hand over due to training rewards. However, the training time greatly compressed their production time, and until now, this group of kobolds has not stored enough food to survive the winter.\nIn this Otherworld, the principles of the seasonal changes are not the same as those in the world Austin was in before.\nIn Austin’s previous world, the reason for the change of seasons was related to Earth’s axial tilt and the elliptical orbit around the Sun. Due to the axial tilt, it is summer when the Sun is directly over the Tropic of Cancer and winter when it is directly over the Tropic of Capricorn.\nBut this world is completely different. According to the inherited memories of the Dragon Race, the climate changes on the Seta Continent are caused by the periodic influence of magic power tides.\nTake the Kawa Great Forest as an example: for nine months of the year, the Fire Attribute Magic Power tides dominate the land, making the entire Kawa Great Forest feel like it’s trapped inside a furnace. Meanwhile, the Water Attribute Magic Power tides in the extreme south also continuously erode the land, resulting in a massive amount of rainfall due to the clash between hot and cold, creating that unique tropical rainforest landscape.\nBut in the last three months of the year, the Fire Attribute Magic Power of the Seta Continent recedes, and the Water Attribute tides from the ocean surge, causing the air to cool rapidly due to the passage of Water Attribute Magic Power. The entire Kawa Great Forest will then be shrouded in a cold spell of Water Attribute Magic Power, with snow blanketing the land and ice sealing ten thousand miles.\nDespite the existence of magic power, an extraordinary factor, in this world, preventing many trees in the Kawa Forest from shedding leaves or withering under the cold’s erosion, maintaining a semblance of prosperity, food scarcity is inevitable during the three months of cold winter.\n\"The cold winter...,\" Austin silently mused to himself. The cold winter every year is the most dangerous, yet also the safest, time in the Kawa Great Forest.\nThose predators who did not store enough food during the summer would be tormented into madness by long-term hunger, desperately seeking food in the ice and snow.\nHungry and injured beasts are often the most dangerous.\nBut at the same time, in the ice and snow, the heavy snow covers all traces. As long as one does not venture out carelessly, hiding in caves generally means safety.\nAt that moment, Austin also recalled the cold winter from a year ago, when his lack of understanding of this world and inadequate preparation almost resulted in his death, turning into a dragon corpse that winter.\n\"I will grant your request, but every three days, you must conduct a concentrated training for one day. Also, be prepared; tomorrow, everyone will gather for an outing to hunt. This time, the opponent won’t be little rabbits. Carelessness could mean death.\"\nAustin’s authoritative voice echoed in the air, and looking at the shadow cast by that massive body, the kobold leader Vini involuntarily swallowed his saliva and said:\n\"We will comply with your orders, Master Austin.\"\nWith that, the kobold leader Vini respectfully retreated.\n\"Cold winter, this might be an opportunity...\"\nAustin did not forget that his deeply resented enemies were still living comfortably elsewhere.\nThe Blood Wolf pack, it’s about time to avenge those grudges...\nDuring the summer, the entire Kawa Forest is covered by lush trees, making it difficult for Austin to find the traces of those beasts.\nBut in the cold winter season, finding the trail of a pack of Blood Wolves became much easier, especially since Blood Wolves, as magic beasts, do not have the habit of storing food. Despite the winter, they also need to hunt to survive.\nHowever, although these kobolds are quite well-trained, dealing with a hundred Blood Wolves led by a low-tier magic beast is still very dangerous.\nBefore that, this kobold \"army\" needs to be sufficiently blooded!\nAnd Austin has already found the first opponent for these kobolds to sharpen and temper their blood.\nIf they undergo enough practical combat beforehand, then this winter will mark the end of the Blood Wolf pack!\nA fierce gleam flashed across Austin’s pupils before he turned and returned to the Dragon’s Nest.\n....\nTime flew by swiftly. After receiving the orders to go to war, the kobolds seemed a bit flustered, but the result of a month of training was quite evident. At the very least, these kobolds had already learned about strict obedience to orders.\nThe next day, as the sun rose,\nseven kobolds stood neatly together holding long Wooden Spears, waiting for Austin’s arrival. Their stance was imposing, making them seem rather formidable.\nAmong this group of kobolds, the only kobold child, Nina, sat inside a tree house, worriedly looking down at them.\nDuring training, except for Nina, even the crippled old kobold had to join. This time, too, everyone except Nina was to go on the expedition.\nAustin flared his wings and soared down from the Dragon’s Nest, looking down at the \"army\" he painstakingly built, nodding in satisfaction, feeling a sense of fulfillment rising within him.\n\"It’s just a pity that weapons are a major issue.\"\nBoth Austin and the kobold troops were veritable paupers, without even a single piece of iron between them. The kobolds still had to use stone tools to make various implements during production.\nThe spears they held were created by arduously hacking down some hard, straight trees with a Stone Knife, then shaping them on stones.\nOriginally, in Austin’s imagination, these kobolds should wield a Wooden Shield in one hand and a Wooden Spear in the other, ready to attack and defend, transforming into a killing machine through mutual cooperation.\nTo realize this idea, Austin had long ordered the kobolds to gather vines so that when making Wooden Shields, they could use the tough vines for reinforcement. But at the last moment, they found they had no suitable iron tools to cut wood and make qualified wooden shields. Helplessly, they had to make do with training using only the Wooden Spears.\n\"When I have time, I’ll need to quickly develop copper refining, iron-smelting, and other metallurgical work....\"\nWith such a thought in mind, Austin landed on the ground with a thump, the sand and dust kicked up by the airflow sweeping across.\n\"This time’s operation is to eliminate the crocodiles entrenched in that nearby lake. Given your training, working together against those stupid beasts shouldn’t be a problem. I don’t want any accidents, understood!\"\nHis authoritative voice rang like muffled thunder, shaking their spirits and souls.\nUpon hearing this target, the kobold group visibly stirred but quickly regained their composure, thanks to a month’s worth of rigorous training.\n\"Good, then let’s move out!\"\nAustin nodded in satisfaction, his azure wings unfurling, causing his entire body to swell by more than twice its size. With a whoosh of wind, his body ascended into the sky, flying towards a lake with the orderly kobold troops following closely behind....",

      "content": "Chapter 7: Chapter 6: A Small Attempt\nAustin’s destination was the lake where the Kobold first appeared within his territory to rest.\nBack then, the Kobold’s instincts weren’t wrong; beneath the seemingly calm surface of that lake lay great danger, hidden were a group of fierce Ghost-headed Crocodiles.\nThese crocodiles have faces as ghastly as evil spirits, hence they are called Ghost-headed Crocodiles.\nOne to two meters long, the Ghost-headed Crocodiles lurk underwater, and whenever large herbivores come to drink, they suddenly burst out from beneath the surface with rows of enormous, hideous teeth. Their powerful jaws can snap the prey’s neck in one go, dragging it into the water.\nEven though Austin and this hard-trained group of Kobolds, dubbed an \"army,\" are no match for such fierce underwater Hunters.\nDiving straight into the water recklessly, with only seven Kobolds and a still juvenile Blue Young Dragon, or even more Kobolds and Blue Young Dragons, would merely be like dropping meat pies from the sky for the Ghost-headed Crocodiles, gobbling them up without leaving any bones.\nNaturally, Austin is not foolish enough to lead this team of Kobolds into the water to fight these fierce beasts head-on.\nNo creature is perfect; even the mightiest beasts have their weaknesses.\nThese Ghost-headed Crocodiles are no exception.\nThe Ghost-headed Crocodiles can lurk beneath the surface for hours without emerging, but they are not fish, they are amphibians. They can only stay underwater for a bit longer than other creatures, unlike fish which can truly live underwater, so they need to come to the surface periodically to breathe and sneak up onto the shore to rest in hidden corners.\nMoreover, these Ghost-headed Crocodiles have a very fatal weakness - they are easily angered and vengeful.\nOnce, when Austin was desperately hungry, he tried to snatch a Ghost-headed Crocodile’s prey, and as a result, the angry crocodile chased him all the way to the Dragon’s Nest. Had the Dragon’s Nest not been built on a sheer cliff, making it impossible for the crocodile to climb, it might have continued the pursuit.\nEven so, the Ghost-headed Crocodile lingered beneath the cliff for hours before leaving.\nNow, this weakness has become Austin’s best weapon against them, and the source of his confidence in dealing with those creatures.\nOf course, Austin would never admit that his choice to pick these Ghost-headed Crocodiles as the Kobolds’ first combat target was due to the grudge with that particular crocodile from before.\n\"There are at least a hundred Ghost-headed Crocodiles in this lake. If they can all be wiped out and the crocodile meat turned into jerky, this alone would meet the Kobolds’ food needs for over a month. Moreover, clearing these Hunters would make the lake a major food source in the depths of winter.\"\nAustin gripped the branch of a large tree by the lakeshore with his claws, standing on it, watching the calm lake below, secretly contemplating in his heart.\nThis trip wasn’t just for avenging the past insult but also to prepare food for the cold winter and for future planning.\nNot to mention the meat of those hundred Ghost-headed Crocodiles, the fish beneath the lake itself is a rich resource.\nWhen the cold winter arrives, ice and snow will freeze the lake’s surface. Just by making a hole in the ice, the oxygen-deprived fish underwater will naturally swarm, becoming an easy food source for Austin and his subjects.\nMoreover, eliminating those Ghost-headed Crocodiles will turn the lake into Austin’s crucial fishery, continuously providing him with fish meat in the future.\nAustin stood on the tree trunk, overseeing the lake from above while his trained Kobold team was hidden below, each gripping their Wooden Spear, somewhat nervous.\nTime slowly ticked by, and the lake remained calm, occasionally with schools of fish swimming through the semi-transparent waters.\nAustin wasn’t at all anxious; according to the Ghost-headed Crocodile’s routine, this was their hunting time. Patience would eventually lead to those crocodiles surfacing to \"breathe.\"\nSure enough, not long after, a surge of murky water suddenly emerged at a spot on the lake’s surface.\n\"Here they come!\"\nAustin immediately perked up as he watched the water splash, and a terrifying-looking head emerged, spraying white mist from its nostrils.\nMost of its body remained submerged, with only its head visible on the surface, breathing.\nAfter breathing for a while, the Ghost-headed Crocodile leisurely paddled towards the shore, slowly crawling out of the lake into a corner obscured by waist-high wild grass, disappearing into the vegetation.\nSeeing this, Austin sneered, signaled the Kobold behind to prepare, flapped his wings, landed on the ground, and picked up a rock weighing a pound or two, then flew up again.\nHe circled once in the air and then dove towards the patch of grass!\nWhoosh!\nThe gale whipped up, causing even the trees to bow. After calculating the distance, Austin released the rock from his claws, hurling it into the grass with immense Power.\nInside the grass, the Ghost-headed Crocodile had just lain down to rest when a rock fell from the sky, hitting its head squarely.\nIn a bewildered daze, another rock fell from the sky, striking it again.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nThe Ghost-headed Crocodile, now aware that something was messing with it, burst out from the grass in a fit of rage.\nNot far ahead, a Blue Young Dragon stood facing it.\nIts forepaw raised its middle finger, beckoning it provocatively.\n\"Come and get me if you can!\"\nThough the Ghost-headed Crocodile had no idea what the damned Blue Young Dragon’s provocative gesture meant, its infuriating demeanor fueled the already furious crocodile’s rage, making its eyes turn blood-red.\nRumble!!!\nThe Ghost-headed Crocodile, eyes bloodshot, charged with all its might, kicking up a cloud of dust, barrelling towards Austin like a tank.\nIts eyes blazed with fury, its presence like a god slaying when facing gods, and a Buddha vanquishing when facing Buddhas!\nYet as it closed in, Austin swiftly flapped his wings, conjuring a whirlwind to lift himself into the air,\nshouting loudly:\n\"Stab!\"\nThe Ghost-headed Crocodile barely had time to react, unable to halt its momentum, as several sharp Wooden Spears pierced through the air to meet it head-on.\nUnder the tremendous impact, those sharp Wooden Spears pierced straight through its thick armored skin without any resistance.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nIn a series of dull thuds, six or seven Wooden Spears crisscrossed, instantly piercing through its body, leaving it skewered through and through...",

      "content": "Chapter 8: Chapter 7: Cleanup\n\"Huff, huff!\"\nKobold leader Vini was gasping for breath, staring at the blood-soaked, lifeless, sinister giant beast before him. Even though it was dead, its ferocious appearance still made Vini’s heart tremble, his legs quiver, and his hands gripping the wooden spear continued to shake, as crimson blood dripped onto the ground.\nWhen that Ghost-headed Crocodile charged up earlier, its menacing aura was so terrifying that he almost thought he was about to die.\nKobolds are among the lowest races on this continent for a reason. Naturally thinner and weaker than other creatures, they often lack an advantage in conflicts, which has nurtured a cautious and timid nature, making them fearful at the slightest rustle of leaves.\nThus, in the eyes of other intelligent beings, kobolds are practically synonymous with cowardice, perceived by many races as only marginally braver than goblins, as the once daring and courageous kobolds likely have already died off.\nIf it were before, even if Vini, as the leader of the kobolds, encountered such a rampant beast, he would have turned and fled at the first opportunity.\nBut after more than a month of training, facing the aggressive charge of the Ghost-headed Crocodile, although Vini’s mind went blank at that moment, his trained instincts made him unconsciously stay put, and upon receiving Austin’s command, he reflexively thrust out the long spear.\nIf Vini were the only kobold, such an impact would have sent him flying along with the wooden spear, but with the support of the other six, they easily withstood the Ghost-headed Crocodile’s forceful blow, while using that powerful momentum to pierce the sharp long spear into the crocodile’s body, securing the first kill against this fierce beast.\nDrip, drip...\nBlood seeped from the wound, trickling down the long spear to the ground.\nUntil this moment, the group of kobolds hadn’t yet realized that with just one simple thrust, the beast that could have easily wiped them out in the past was killed.\nSeeing the lifeless, fierce Ghost-headed Crocodile’s body on the ground, the kobolds felt as if they were still dreaming.\n\"Very good, I thought there might be some mishap on your first battle, but you did well.\"\nA voice, deep like thunder, echoed beside them. Unbeknownst to them, Austin had landed by their side, stirring up swirling currents of air.\n\"Quickly tidy this up and prepare to hunt the next one. I hope you continue to maintain this level of performance.\"\nLooking at the kobold team gradually coming back to their senses, Austin nodded silently to himself.\nUncertain if it was his imagination, after truly being stained with blood, this group of kobolds seemed to have undergone an inexplicable transformation, even their gazes turned sharper.\nThe feeling Austin got was as if this team of kobolds, through the baptism of this hunt, had successfully become a qualified army.\nWith the success of the first hunt, the subsequent sweeps progressed very smoothly.\nThe strategy remained consistent: wait for the Ghost-headed Crocodile to surface, Austin would fly into the sky to \"lure\" it, and then the kobolds would unite to slay it.\nThe seven kobolds, having undergone special training for over a month, displayed extraordinary performance in this real battle. Their teamwork became increasingly seamless, and those fearsome Ghost-headed Crocodiles were pierced by their long spears before they could even reach them.\nWith each killing, the kobolds’ coordination improved.\nIf this were a game, you would see the experience numbers +1, +1, +1... rapidly increasing over the heads of the kobolds.\n...\nThree days later, by the same reservoir by the lake.\nAfter three consecutive days of eradication, the number of Ghost-headed Crocodiles lurking beneath the reservoir was reduced to a few. They were nearly wiped out, leaving only a handful of stragglers.\nMeanwhile, the ground beside the reservoir was stained with a faint dark red, the result of the massive amount of Ghost-headed Crocodile blood flowing and coagulating on it, spreading a bloody odor.\nSo far, one hundred and thirty-two Ghost-headed Crocodiles have perished here. The crocodile meat hung on the kobold house fronts as cured meat, and their skins were crafted into Crocodile Armor worn by the kobolds.\n\"Alright, take a break and sharpen your long spears a bit. After today, we should be able to clear this reservoir.\"\nAfter slaying yet another reckless and irritable Ghost-headed Crocodile, Austin glanced at the kobolds behind him and spoke in a heavy voice.\nThe kobolds deftly pulled the wooden spears from the Ghost-headed Crocodile’s body, then handled the corpse simply and tossed it into a wicker basket filled with crocodile bodies, each finding a stone to sharpen their dulled wooden spears again.\nThis routine had been repeated many times over the past three days. Even though these spears were made from wood as hard as ironwood, they were still wood and couldn’t endure more than a few uses before deteriorating.\nIt’s largely due to these wooden spears that the extermination of the Ghost-headed Crocodiles took three days.\n\"Damn, I wonder if there are any copper or iron mines nearby. We need to start metallurgy as soon as possible...\"\nThis inefficiency was evidently becoming intolerable for Austin, and wooden weapons came with significant limitations, far inferior to those made of copper or iron. To strengthen his subordinates, copper and iron were indispensable.\nTime slipped by quickly, and soon the kobolds had rested enough and resharpened the wooden spears.\n\"Very well, get ready, we’re starting.\"\nLooking at the neatly lined kobold team, Austin couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride welling up within him.\nAfter these three days of refinement, just by standing there, this group of kobolds exuded a sense of fierce bravery after being bloodied, which bolstered Austin’s confidence in that plan to capture the Blood Wolf pack during the cold winter.\nFollowing the routine, they then slew three more Ghost-headed Crocodiles, but afterward, the entire area around the reservoir remained calm, with not even the slightest ripple.\n\"Master Austin, could it be that the Ghost-headed Crocodiles in this reservoir have been completely wiped out?\"\nAt this moment, Vini, reeking of blood, cautiously approached Austin and asked.\nWaiting throughout most of the day, until near sunset, there was still no sign of a Ghost-headed Crocodile in the reservoir, yet the fish in the lake seemed to sense that the fierce predators had disappeared, gathering in schools to float at the water’s surface gulping for air.\nAll signs seemed to indicate that the Ghost-headed Crocodiles in this reservoir had been thoroughly exterminated and that the entire lake was safe. After all, Ghost-headed Crocodiles are amphibious creatures, unable to stay submerged for too long.\nAs the sun set in the west, the sunlight cast golden ripples on the lake surface, making everything seem so beautiful.\nHowever, for some reason, a foreboding shadow loomed in Austin’s heart.",

      "content": "Chapter 9: Chapter 8 Magic Beast\nThe feeling came strangely. After keeping watch here for most of the day, it had already exceeded the time the ghost-headed crocodile could lurk underwater. In theory, this lake should be free of ghost-headed crocodiles now.\nBut why does my heart instinctively sense a great danger beneath the calm lake surface?\nIs there truly danger, or is it just a deceptive shadow cast by the mind?\nAustin stared at the serene lake surface, bowing his head in contemplation.\nNext to him, the Kobold leader Vini remained silent, obediently waiting for any orders from Lord Austin. Through the experiences of recent days, Vini had developed unprecedented admiration and obedience towards his patron.\nInitially, when Austin was training them, the kobolds, though they dared not express it openly, were somewhat disgruntled in heart. These seemingly pointless training sessions occupied much of their time for finding food, leading them to think of Blue Young Dragon Austin as someone who simply liked to trifle unnecessarily. Yet, they accepted it considering the benefits of companionship and exemption from certain dues during training.\nHowever, the moment they managed to effortlessly kill the fierce ghost-headed crocodile, which once could easily chew them up in an instant, through trained cooperation, all dissatisfaction within the kobolds vanished immediately.\nIt turned out that even naturally weak kobolds like them could kill beasts far stronger than themselves!\nIt turned out the power they could harness was far beyond their imagination!\nAnd towards the Blue Dragon Austin, who brought about this change, all the kobolds now held him in the highest reverence, as if he were a deity.\n\"It would be great if the ghost-headed crocodiles here could never be fully killed!\" Vini silently mused while looking at the undisturbed lake surface before him.\nThe feeling of weak defeating strong through easy hunts over these past few days had deeply enchanted him.\nMoreover, within just three days of encircling, the ghost-headed crocodile meat obtained was already enough to last them a month.\nThis was despite having handed over a portion to His Highness.\nThe kobolds felt nothing but immense gratitude for handing over the spoils, rather than discontent.\nAfter Austin generously waved it aside, only taking fifty percent of the harvest, the kobolds couldn’t help but admire His Highness Blue Dragon Austin greatly, considering him the best and most benevolent lord in the world. If the kobolds’ loyalty was measured at 100, after these days of developments, it had likely surpassed the limit, reaching 110.\nIf possible, Vini hoped the ghost-headed crocodiles within this lake could never be entirely eradicated.\n\"This year’s cold winter will probably pass without experiencing hunger, and maybe a few more newborns could be added to the tribe during the freeze...\"\nJust as Kobold leader Vini’s thoughts spread and envisioned a bright future, Blue Dragon Austin suddenly instructed solemnly:\n\"Go catch some live prey, such as earthy-gray rabbits or pheasants, bring them over.\"\n\"Yes, Your Highness Austin.\"\nVini took the order and left, although unaware of the purpose; he only needed to implement the orders.\nEven with the kobold resettlement affecting nearby animals to some extent, extinction had not occurred. Shortly, two kobolds approached, holding a fluttering wild chicken and a leg-kicking earthy-gray rabbit.\n\"Tie their feet with vines and throw them into the lake.\"\nVini followed Austin’s instruction without questioning the reason.\nThe two animals were soon thrown into the lake, not sinking, struggling fiercely on the water surface, causing splashes.\nOn the shore, everyone held their breath with anticipation.\nSoon, as if exhausted, the small animals struggled weakly, seemingly about to sink. Just as Kobold leader Vini contemplated asking Austin if they should pull the prey back up.\nAt that moment,\nBOOM!!!\nSuddenly, a massive wave erupted on the water surface, and a ghost-headed crocodile, twice the size of an average one, with leathery skin glistening darkly like steel armor, ferociously burst out from underwater. Its gaping mouth with saw-like fangs gleamed coldly, swallowing both small animals in one bite.\nSPLASH!!!\nHuge water streams surged and rolled, as the giant ghost-headed crocodile sank back into the depths, disappearing once more. The muddy water below billowed up, churning the entire lake reservoir into murkiness.\nThe kobolds on the shore gazed in horror at it all, feeling their minds go blank. This colossal size far exceeded any ghost-headed crocodile they had previously slain, rendering it even more ferocious.\nKobold leader Vini felt cold sweat streaming down his back, regretting his earlier belief that all ghost-headed crocodiles in the lake had been eradicated, unaware of a more terrifying one hiding beneath.\nVini glanced at Austin in admiration.\nAustin remained oblivious to the thoughts of the kobolds behind him, his heart had already sunk into a pit.\n\"Magic Beast! This is definitely a true Magic Beast!\"\nThroughout three days, Austin had never seen this ghost-headed crocodile appear, meaning it had been lurking underwater for at least three days!\nIf not a Magic Beast infused with magic power, it couldn’t possibly break the biological limits, surviving underwater for such a long time like a true aquatic species.\n\"Should I give up...\"\nAustin pondered internally.\nThis ghost-headed crocodile was likely a leader within its pack, akin to an elite in a game, with a size slightly larger than Austin himself. Austin was not entirely confident in defeating it.\nYet, Austin’s original intention of clearing this lake reservoir, besides seeking revenge and hunting for winter food, was mainly to establish a fishing site for a continual source of fish meat. Having spent so much effort, Austin was reluctant to abandon it.\nAfter weighing the gains and losses in his heart, Austin quickly made a decision.\n\"Take the gamble!\"\nThe ghost-headed crocodile’s strength was immense, the force of this leader one presumably greater. Even if Austin was bitten, he might survive only after a layer of skin peeled off. Considering its size, Austin’s chance of winning in a direct confrontation was likely less than thirty percent.\nHowever, as the saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.\nThis was a Magic Beast, not like any of the fierce beasts Austin had hunted before. In recent days, Austin clearly felt his body’s magic power beginning to grow, needing more material containing magical power.\nShould he devour this ghost-headed crocodile, Austin believed his own power would achieve higher levels, possibly unlocking a second magical technique.\nMoreover, this ghost-headed crocodile was not invulnerable. The difference between humans and beasts truly lies in wisdom, doesn’t it?",

      "content": "Chapter 10: Chapter 9: The Hunt\nThe Blue Young Dragon Austin recalled and speculated that the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader should have two weaknesses.\nFirst, in the past three days, the Blue Young Dragon led a group of Kobolds to slaughter the Ghost-headed Crocodiles in the lake, and the leader of the underwater Ghost-headed Crocodiles did not appear or take any action, allowing the other Ghost-headed Crocodiles to be slaughtered without any sense of crisis.\nThis indicates that it is likely to have low intelligence and a low sensitivity to danger.\nSecondly, the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader is also a Ghost-headed Crocodile, so it is likely to retain the trait of being easily angered and vindictive like ordinary Ghost-headed Crocodiles.\nHaving identified the weaknesses, the next step is to arrange the battle tactics.\nTime flew by quickly, and soon it was the second day.\nThe sun hung high in the sky, the vast sky was a deep blue, like a massive, translucent ice block, crystal clear and immaculate.\nThis is the prelude to the coming of the cold winter. Soon, the cold current of Water Magic from the sea will overpower the Fire Attribute Magic Power on the continent, sweeping across the entire sky and earth.\nAt this time, by the lake reservoir, about twenty meters from the water surface, the Blue Young Dragon and several Kobolds were covering the traps they had dug overnight with a thick layer of leaves as camouflage.\n\"You should be aware of the power of Magic Beasts. Follow the plan, but if things don’t look good, I allow you to retreat first.\"\nThe Blue Young Dragon said in a heavy voice. Having witnessed the might of the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader yesterday, Austin had no absolute confidence in hunting it, and he did not want to see the Kobolds he’d painstakingly trained suffer losses because of it.\n\"Alright, let’s begin.\"\nWith Austin’s command given, two Kobolds placed bloody, fist-sized pieces of meat on the ground every two steps, extending all the way to the edge of the lake reservoir, then threw the last pieces of meat in their hands into the water before quickly turning around and leaving.\nThe water surface was calm for a moment, then the sound of rushing water was heard, and a powerful current surged from the lake’s bottom, stirring up a massive amount of silt.\nEnticed by the scent of food, the leader of the Ghost-headed Crocodiles at the lake’s bottom couldn’t resist coming out, swallowing the meat in the water in one gulp.\nAs it was about to dive back into the water, it suddenly saw another piece of meat on the shore.\nPerhaps because it was the absolute apex predator in this part of the lake, it had been many years since any creature dared to offend them. The Ghost-headed Crocodiles had no natural enemies, so they didn’t have to consider anything else. Moreover, being the strongest Ghost-headed Crocodile leader, it didn’t think twice, swaggered onto the shore, swallowed the meat in one gulp, and then saw another piece in the distance...\nFollowing the trail of food, the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader slowly crawled away from the lake reservoir, its gaze finally resting on a pile of fallen leaves in front of it, where a fresh deer leg lay quietly.\nThe Ghost-headed Crocodile leader hesitated not for a second and leisurely crawled over.\nThe dark scale armor shimmered with a metallic luster. In this area, it was the invincible overlord and didn’t have to worry about any enemy harboring ill intentions against it.\nWithout any surprises, the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader fell directly into the trap.\nBang!\nThe \"ground\" suddenly collapsed. Beneath the seemingly solid layer of fallen leaves was a pit over a meter deep, with sharp wooden spikes embedded in it. The Ghost-headed Crocodile leader tumbled straight down.\nThe Ghost-headed Crocodile was completely caught off guard, its massive body crashing into the pit, rolling down and directly hitting the sharp wooden spikes at the bottom.\nHowever, the expected sight of blood splattering did not occur. The defense of the Ghost-headed Crocodile’s dark scale armor was too strong. The sharp wooden spikes couldn’t even leave white marks before being crushed.\n\"Everyone ready, go!\"\nAt this moment, accompanied by the order of the Kobold leader Vini, a line of Kobolds suddenly stood up from the grass a few meters away, ran to the edge of the pit in a few steps, and while the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader was still dizzy from falling into the pit, they thrust wooden spears down in unison.\nYet, to no avail.\nThose wooden spears couldn’t penetrate the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader’s scale armor at all!\nFeeling the pain, the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader raised its head, seeing the Kobolds above who kept stabbing it.\nAlthough this pain was negligible to the Ghost-headed Crocodile and caused no harm, the sensation was like a mouse defecating on your head. The Ghost-headed Crocodile leader felt offended, and not just merely offended, a surging fury erupted inside.\nRoar!!!\nOn its ferocious head, its eyes suddenly glowed red. It opened its terrifying mouth, revealing sharp, cold teeth, and roared at the sky.\nIn an instant, a sonic wave burst forth from the ground, and the Kobolds facing this roar were immediately pushed back several steps, almost stumbling to the ground.\nBut that wasn’t the end,\nA dark glow emanated from the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader’s body. With one swipe of its claw on the pit’s wall, the solid dirt collapsed like tofu, as if an Iron Armor Giant Beast had torn through the pit, climbing up from the underground, raising billowing dust.\nThe Kobolds, just recovered from the soul-shaking roar, saw the furious Ghost-headed Crocodile leader tearing out of the pit, charging towards them like an out-of-control iron-clad car.\n\"Not good! Stab!\"\nWith the terrified command of the Kobold leader Vini, the Kobolds instinctively jabbed forward with their spears in unison.\nSeeing the approaching spear forest, the Ghost-headed Crocodile’s fury intensified, its tail swinging as it charged, smashing the incoming spears with its tail that was like an iron hammer carrying formidable power.\nCrack, crack...\nThe crisp sound of breaking resonated continuously, with no exception - the wooden spears snapped and shattered one by one. Behind, the Kobolds holding the spears were shocked to the ground by the enormous force, instantly flying away and crashing heavily.\nAs the Kobolds landed far away, wailing in pain, the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader took another step toward the Kobolds, aggressive and massive like a steel giant hand.\nJust as the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader was about to reach the Kobolds, ready to kill and eat these pesky creatures that dared to attack it,\na large shadow suddenly fell from the sky, covering it completely without any warning.\nIn an instant, an extremely dangerous feeling descended upon the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader’s heart, the innate instincts sending shivers through its entire body.\nYet before it could react,\nThe Blue Young Dragon, having been lying in wait for a long time, seized the moment, darting across the sky like a black lightning. It brought a swift and intense gale as it landed on the Ghost-headed Crocodile’s body, its two steel-like claws precisely piercing into the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader’s spine, clamping onto that spinal cord like iron pincers...",

      "content": "Chapter 11: Chapter 10: Magic Beast Crystal Core\nRoar!!!\nBlood splattered violently, and the intense pain surged from its back, driving the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader mad. Strands of black Magic Power emanated from its body, letting out a terrifying howl that created a gust of airwaves, causing the withered leaves on the ground to whirl upwards, while the surrounding trees rustled and bent downwards.\nThe Kobolds, having finally managed to stand up in the distance, faced this sonic impact completely unprepared, as if confronting a tidal wave, causing them to involuntarily stumble backwards and fall to the ground.\nBut it wasn’t over yet; the unprecedented pain had already drowned out the scarce rationality of the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader.\nBang bang bang!\nThe continuous booming sounded like rolling thunder as the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader kept slamming the ground, which shattered and cracked like tofu, causing a series of violent tremors and a torrent of dust to rise.\nWatching this terrifying scene, the Kobolds in the distance could no longer enter the battlefield.\nThe Ghost-headed Crocodile leader thrashed violently, attempting to shake the Blue Young Dragon off its back, but to no avail.\nThe crocodile’s body joints prevented it from twisting its tail or striking its back with its joints, which meant it had no means of threatening an enemy on its back.\nAt this moment, the Blue Young Dragon, with its two dragon claws gripping the spine of the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader, thrust its ferocious head out and bite down hard on its neck.\nMeanwhile,\nCrackle!\nOn the surface of the Blue Young Dragon’s ghostly blue Scale Armor, arcs of electricity suddenly flashed, sparkling in the air. Electric currents traversed along Austin’s body, surged into the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader, immediately causing deep tremors and paralysis, making its entire body tremble.\nElectric Shock Paralysis,\nThis was the first Talent Magic Austin awakened a year ago, and to this day, the only Magic he had mastered.\nThis talent seemed weak, but in reality, Austin’s phenomenal growth in height within just two years was not unrelated to him using this Talent Magic to exercise and stimulate his physical growth.\nAt this moment, this Talent Magic also became a powerful means to deal with the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader.\nRoar!!!\nUnder the old wound, there were new injuries. After successive heavy blows, the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader was utterly deranged.\nIt crazily slammed the ground, its madness even breaking through the paralysis caused by the electric current, with massive Power making the entire forest feel like it was going through an earthquake, the ground cracking wide open like a spider web, and it charged wildly like an uncontrollable heavy truck.\nCrack crack...\nTrees were successively smashed and fell, trunks broke, sending wood chips flying, and enormous dust clouds swept up.\nHowever, this was merely the last burst of madness from the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader.\nSure enough, after smashing through three large trees in succession, the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader was utterly exhausted, all its strength pouring out like a flood, staggering two more steps before it finally could no longer support its body and collapsed with a thunderous crash.\nAll the while, the Blue Young Dragon remained firmly pinned to the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader’s back, unmoving.\nSeeing that the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader’s life force had vanished, Austin didn’t immediately release his hold, but instead waited several minutes to ensure it was truly dead before loosening his jaws and claws.\n\"Your Highness Austin, are you alright?\"\nAt this time, the Kobold leader Vini ran over, enduring the discomfort in his body, and looked at the lifeless Giant Beast under Austin’s feet, his eyes still lingering with residual fear.\n\"I’m fine, you did very well.\"\nThe first time he encountered these Kobolds, they were timid and cowardly, but after these months of transformation, they had already become a competent army.\nIn facing such ferocious enemies, they were not intimidated, instead organizing two counterattacks and courageously facing such a formidable opponent.\nIf it were other Kobolds in this world, likely, they would have scattered and fled the moment they saw the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader.\n\"The seed has been planted.\"\nGlancing at the Kobold leader Vini beside him, Austin thought silently.\nIn the future, when more Clan members are gathered, with these Kobolds at the core, continually driving the training forward, it will definitely be possible to build an invincible army with iron discipline.\nOf course, that will probably be something for a long time to come.\nThe Blue Young Dragon turned its attention back to the corpse of the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader in front of him and felt a faint stirring in his heart towards the corpse.\nA desire, a desire to devour.\nAfter pondering for a moment, the Blue Young Dragon extended its sharp teeth towards the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader’s head, pressing down with its massive dragon claws, then suddenly yanked upwards, and the head of the Ghost-headed Crocodile was ripped apart like a rag.\n\"Is this...\"\nInside the bloody head, a sphere the size of a ping-pong ball, resembling a gel-like solid, gleamed with a dark luster, with strands of Magic Power diffusing and turning into wisps of black mist.\n\"A Magic Beast Crystal Core? No, it’s only a Crystal Core Prototype. This creature was about to condense into a real Magic Power Crystal!\" Austin’s eyes flashed with a trace of astonishment, along with a hint of excitement.\nFrom the inherited memories, he learned that in this world, Magic Beasts are broadly divided into nine levels based on the extent of Magic Power in their bodies.\nAnd among Magic Beasts of the same level, combat capability varies, and those that can form Crystal Cores are invariably top-tier monsters among the same level of Magic Beasts.\nBased on the estimation of the Magic Power within this Ghost-headed Crocodile leader, it was at roughly the second level range, but if its Core matured completely, it might awaken Talent Magic, its combat strength potentially rising directly to the level of a third-tier Magic Beast.\nOf course, to Austin, it didn’t matter whether this Ghost-headed Crocodile advanced; what mattered was that this Crystal Core represented extremely rare Magic Power Resources.\nAnd the growth of the Dragon Race during its juvenile stage requires the consumption of massive amounts of Magic Power resources!\nWithout a moment’s hesitation, the Blue Young Dragon picked up the unripe Crystal Core and swallowed it whole.\nBoom!!!\nAt the moment the Crystal Core Prototype entered the Blue Young Dragon’s stomach, the Dragon Race’s powerful digestive capability immediately broke down the Magic Crystal, releasing a torrent of Magic Power that coursed through its body along the blood vessels.\nRoar!!!\nAt that moment, Austin felt as though there was a molten mass flowing within his stomach, and the intense pain made him roar involuntarily.\nMeanwhile, as that torrent of Magic Power coursed throughout his body, entering each cell, the Blue Young Dragon’s aura soared ever higher, creating a whirlwind on the ground.\nAt the same time,\nCrackle!\nArcs of electricity danced around his body, crackling noisily, like hundreds of birds chattering simultaneously...",

      "content": "Chapter 12: Chapter 11: The 2nd Talent Magic\nA surge of magic power spread from the stomach like magma, burrowing into the blood vessels and then merging into every part of the body.\nWith the influx of magic power, the Blue Young Dragon seemed to break through a certain boundary, and the aura suddenly swept away, catching the nearby Kobold off guard and knocking them back.\n\"His Highness Austin!\"\nAll the Kobolds stared wide-eyed at all this, but seeing the electric arc sparks leaping outside his body, none of them dared to approach him.\nHowever, soon Austin’s aura calmed down, and the surrounding anomalies vanished as well.\nAt the same time, whether it was an illusion of the Kobolds or not, the Blue Young Dragon seemed to have become stronger, and the color of his scale armor appeared to have deepened.\nSimultaneously, the Blue Young Dragon slowly opened his eyes, a sense of enlightenment surging in his heart.\nJust now, he had awakened his second talent magic.\n\"Thunder Strike Technique, huh...\"\nAustin focused his mind, and the magic power inside him began to circulate along a fixed circuit, immediately stirring the air in front of him as the magic power moved.\nIn the next moment,\nBoom!!!\nA bolt of lightning suddenly descended from a clear sky, as if tearing through the air, striking a large tree in front of him.\nIn an instant, white light flashed, and the entire tree burned fiercely in a very short time, its branches and leaves turned to ashes, leaving only a few massive charred trunks standing quietly, continuously emitting white smoke.\n\"Hiss, what power!\"\nSeeing the scene before him, even Austin couldn’t help but gape in shock.\nThis talent magic was far stronger than the first useless ability he awakened, Electric Shock Paralysis, which couldn’t attack at a distance. Just the power produced by Thunder Strike Technique, if Austin were to use it on the previous Ghost-headed Crocodile leader, it would surely be crippled or killed.\n\"It’s a pity that while the Thunder Strike Technique is incredibly powerful, it also consumes a lot of energy, and being able to use it even once in battle is considered good.\"\nFeeling that more than half of the magic power in his body was almost depleted, Austin couldn’t help but smile wryly.\nNevertheless, having awakened his second talent magic, Austin’s strength significantly increased, at least he now had a very formidable trump card up his sleeve.\n\"With this, I’m more confident in dealing with that group of beasts.\"\nRecalling the pack of Blood Wolves still lurking nearby, a cold glint flashed in the Blue Young Dragon’s eyes.\nThe Ghost-headed Crocodiles in the lake reservoir have already been cleaned out, and next, it’s time to clean up the site, especially the corpses of those slain Ghost-headed Crocodiles, which need to be made into smoked meat before they spoil.\nThis smoked meat is naturally a product of the knowledge and experience Austin brought from his previous life to this world.\nIn this otherworld, the Kobolds have no effective means of food preservation, or rather, for these races living at the bottom of the continent, maintaining their own survival is tough enough, and having leftover meat to store is virtually impossible. During the harsh winters, the most they could eat were nuts picked from the forest in the summer, starchy tree roots, fruit seeds, and some wild rice and wheat, but more often they relied on grass roots and bark to barely get through one cold, hungry winter after another.\nLacking the need to store meat naturally means they didn’t know how to preserve leftover meat.\nIf not for Austin’s guidance, the Ghost-headed Crocodiles from the past two days probably would have already gone bad.\n\"You guys go do your own thing, no need to mind me. And, you did well today. Aside from this one Ghost-headed Crocodile leader, the rest are your brave rewards.\"\nAustin pointed to the Ghost-headed Crocodile’s corpse on the ground and said to the Kobold leader Vini beside him.\nThis Ghost-headed Crocodile leader was a Magic Beast; besides the Magic Beast Crystal Core in its head, its body also contained quite a bit of magic power, so Austin certainly couldn’t afford to waste it lightly.\n\"Thank you for your generosity, His Highness Austin!\"\nThe Kobold leader Vini exclaimed gratefully, deeply appreciative of the Blue Young Dragon.\nSubsequently, under the leadership of the Kobold leader, the Kobolds skillfully packed the dozen or so Ghost-headed Crocodile corpses into a basket and carried them back.\nNext, they would gut the dead Ghost-headed Crocodiles, with their solid muscles being cut into pieces and placed into a furnace for smoking, to be made into smoked meat.\nThe tough crocodile skin would also be peeled, processed, and dried, made into a dozen sets of armor to protect the Kobolds, with the rest stored in the warehouse. If one day they ran out of food in the harsh winter, they could cut it down and boil it as winter survival food.\nAs for the innards, the Kobolds didn’t let them go to waste either, squeezing out the residues from the intestines and stomach, boiling it into a large pot, and eating it nonetheless. Though it didn’t taste as good as meat, to these often-starving Kobolds, it was already a rare delicacy.\nSoon, beneath the Blue Young Dragon’s lair, in the fledgling village the Kobolds had hastily set up, all the Kobolds were bustling about, with even the Kobold child Nina doing her utmost to help. Everyone was making preparations for the upcoming winter.\nCooking smoke curled upward, and although this so-called village only had one or two simple huts made of straw and thatch, it had a cozy homey feel to it.\n...\nMeanwhile, while the Kobolds were using their wits and courage to prepare for the winter,\nbeside the lake reservoir, after determining there were no fierce predators in the lake reservoir that could threaten him, Austin leapt into the water, diving to the lakebed.\nSince this reservoir could support a Ghost-headed Crocodile leader, a Magic Beast potent enough to form a Magic Beast Crystal Core, there might be some hidden secrets below.\nAustin jumped straight into the water. The underwater was slightly dim, the churning muddy water obscuring his view, but the dragon race’s eyesight well compensated for this shortcoming, allowing him to still see the scene ten meters away under such dim conditions.\nUnder the dim water, a huge shadow slowly submerged, causing the surrounding fish to scatter and flee in all directions.\nSeeing the density of fish underwater, Austin estimated in his heart, roughly guessing that even if he did not catch any food throughout the entire winter, the fish resources in this lake reservoir would be enough to support him through the cold winter.\nOf course, the Blue Young Dragon wasn’t down there looking for fish.\nThe lake reservoir was very deep, Austin roughly calculated that he had swum at least a hundred meters down, but still couldn’t see the lakebed, while the nearby fishes appeared to be getting bigger.\n\"So deep...\"\nThe Blue Young Dragon’s brow furrowed slightly, he wasn’t a fish, even with a dragon race’s strong body, he couldn’t stay underwater indefinitely, especially since the deeper he went, the pressure in the water grew stronger.\n\"How exactly did this lake form?\"\nSeeing the astonishing depth of the lake reservoir, and recalling the location of this reservoir on land, Austin suddenly discovered some clues.\nThe area around this lake was clearly a vast plain, and there was only a tiny river leading into this lake reservoir.\nWith such a geographical location, such a small river, it was apparent that this lake reservoir couldn’t have formed naturally...\nGazing at the profoundly dark lakebed below, Austin pondered for a moment, gritted his teeth, flapped his wings, creating massive splashes of water, and then darted down towards the lakebed like an arrow...",

      "content": "Chapter 13: Chapter 12: The Secret of the Lake Bottom\nWhen they reached two hundred meters below, the water pressure rose exponentially. Just as Austin felt he couldn’t hold on any longer, he suddenly saw a faint blue light emerge from the pitch-black lakebed.\n\"Have we arrived?\"\nThe Blue Young Dragon’s face lit up with joy, and it sped toward the lakebed.\nIn just a moment, Austin felt as if he had entered a magical world. On the ground of the lakebed, dandelion-like plants swayed with the current, emitting a ghostly blue glow.\nOne after another, they connected into a patch, illuminating the entire lakebed.\nAt the same time, the seeds of the \"dandelions\" detached from their mother plants, gathering together with the water flow to form radiant bands resembling the Milky Way. They hovered in the blue world above, drifting upward with the wind.\nThe tiny lights, upon reaching a height of over ten meters, seemed to exhaust all their energy and extinguished. Immediately, schools of fish, coming from unknown places, darted down to devour them.\nThe blue dandelions absorbed unknown energy from the lakebed to grow and glow, releasing seeds that rose with the water flow, only to be devoured by strange fish, forming a peculiar symbiotic system.\n\"This is...\"\nThe vast blue light reflected in his pupils, illuminating the entire world.\nAnyone who had never witnessed this scene could hardly imagine the grandeur and wondrous beauty of this world.\nEven Austin was stunned for a long moment by this scene.\n\"What exactly are these dandelions? And what lies beneath the lakebed to sustain these strange plants’ growth...\"\nA cascade of questions surged in Austin’s mind as he flapped his wings and darted toward the lakebed.\nHowever, just when the Blue Young Dragon entered the blue light band area, the dandelion seeds on Austin abruptly exploded, and ghostly blue flames spread across the Blue Young Dragon’s scales, roaring with the ferocity of an overwhelming blaze, as if intending to engulf Austin.\n\"Oh no!\"\nFeeling a sharp pain coursing through his body, Austin’s face changed dramatically. Just as the blue flames were about to envelop him, he frantically flapped his wings and fled upward.\nThe turbulent water oscillated until he exited the blue band range, and only then did the blue flames on Austin’s body extinguish completely.\nEven so, the scales of the Blue Young Dragon turned pitch black, as if they had been singed by smoke and fire.\n\"What on earth is this thing!\"\nGrimacing at the pain and looking at the extensive burns on his body, Austin gasped.\nNo wonder the fish chose to consume the extinguished dandelion seeds from above; these things were surprisingly dangerous. Even Austin, with his Dragon Race body, was so beleaguered upon contact. If ordinary fish had been touched by it, they likely would have been reduced to ashes.\nAustin gazed intently at the fantastical fairy tale world beneath him. If he hadn’t personally tested it, he wouldn’t believe that such dazzling beauty concealed such terrifying threats.\nThe sea of light below continued to sway gently with the current, quietly emanating brilliant rays. The light bands that Austin had disturbed gradually returned to their previous order and appearance, as if nothing had happened.\nAfter watching for a long time, Austin felt only a heavy sense of threat and a faintly peculiar sensation from that sea of light; he discovered nothing else.\n\"Forget it, I’m not capable of unraveling this mystery now, but someday, I will uncover everything.\"\nRealizing he couldn’t stay beneath the lake any longer, Austin glanced deeply at the sea of light below before turning away.\nThe ghostly blue dandelions continued to quietly spread their tiny lights, extinguishing after hovering over ten meters high, only to be devoured by eager fish.\nEverything was as usual, as if nothing had occurred.\nHowever, Austin didn’t notice that those fish which had devoured the \"dandelion\" seeds briefly showed a weak blue glow between the scales beneath their bellies, flashing quickly...\n...\nAs time passed, the cold winter days drew nearer. The vast blue sky became even clearer and more azure, like a gigantic block of ice, with visible cold spreading across the heavens as if sealing the entire sky.\nThe Kobolds filled their days completely. After the morning’s routine drills, they spent every remaining moment gathering food. Although they had already collected enough provisions to survive the cold winter, an inherent instinct drove them onward.\nMemories from their ancestors reminded them that every cold winter brought unbearable hunger, and only by preparing more food could they survive the harsh winter season.\nTo prevent blizzards from eroding their shelter, the simple houses once on trees had been relocated to the ground. Wooden stakes were pounded in, sturdy branches reinforced the construction, and straw was woven with vines and tied to the poles.\nMeanwhile, beside the houses, a small warehouse was built right against them. Inside, a layer of dry straw was laid on the ground; on top of that were pieces of sun-dried and hardened crocodile skin. Above lay several large baskets of smoked meat and nuts, seeds, and various wild grains gathered from the forest.\nWith the arrival of cold winter, the trees in the forest also cycled through their final stages, releasing fruits born from nine months of stored summer energy. This time was when the Kawa Forest was richest in food.\nEvery time the Kobolds ventured out, they returned laden with goods, rapidly filling warehouses. They amassed supplies far beyond their winter needs.\nSeeing the warehouses overflow with food, it was said that one day the oldest limping Kobold in the tribe opened the warehouse doors and, gazing at the bounty, couldn’t help but cry.\nThe sight was like a dream; in the old Kobold’s decades-long life, they never imagined that something only dreamt of would become reality.\nEverything was improving. With time on their hands, the Kobolds even constructed a fence around the houses, faintly giving the appearance of a tribe.\nTime meandered on, and a few days later,\nthe world changed color overnight.",

      "content": "Chapter 14: Chapter 13: The Arrival of the Cold Winter\nThroughout the night, the cold wind roared like a demon, and the icy chill swept across the heavens and earth. All living beings trembled under the divine might of nature.\nThe pitch-black sky seemed to collapse, the biting wind howled with snow as sharp as knives; on this night, countless unprepared creatures perished in the darkness.\nThe violent blizzard raged all night long.\nThe next morning, as the sun rose, Austin poked his head out of the cave.\nAll he could see was an endless expanse of white, even the sky was white.\nThe once vast sea of green was now covered by thick white snow. The giant ancient trees, with leaves not yet fallen, had long icicles hanging down, shimmering with a crystalline glow, like sharp ice spikes.\nIf some animals happened to pass underneath and accidentally hit the trees, they might be skewered into porcupines by the falling icicles in the next second.\n\"It feels like the world changed overnight!\"\nJust yesterday, the sun was high in the sky, though the heavens had already taken on an icy hue, the heat was enough to make one sweat. But today, the endless earth was already blanketed in snow.\nThis miraculous transformation from summer to winter in an instant was still fascinating for Austin, who had crossed into this world for over two years.\n\"Indeed, such a winter is quite cold.\"\nOn the first day of the cold winter season, the residual chill carried by the passing Water Attribute Magic Power lingered in the air, making the first few days exceptionally cold. Even with Austin’s powerful Dragon Race body, he could feel the icy chill piercing his scales.\n\"Never mind, the food is enough for a few days; I might as well stay cozy in the nest for a while.\"\nLooking at the icy world outside, Austin shifted in his nest and ultimately decided against leaving the warm dragon’s lair.\nJust as the Blue Young Dragon was about to pull his head back for another nap, a loud and orderly military command sounded from the cliff bottom.\n\"One-two-one, one-two-one, one-two, one-two, halt...\"\nAustin poked his head out and saw, beneath the cliff, thin smoke rising from the few simple wooden huts of a village, and on the snowy open ground, perhaps out of habit from over a month’s military training, the kobolds did not slack off despite the arrival of the cold winter; instead, they continued their morning training as usual.\nStanding at attention, marching in step, turning left and right, spear-holding and shooting exercises—various tactical movements.\nThe biting cold wind swept through from above, and the breath from their mouths condensed into icy mist in the air. Despite having fur to resist the cold, the kobolds still shivered when standing at attention.\nHowever, even without Austin present, the kobolds trained rigorously in the cold winter, without a hint of negligence.\nSoon, their bodies warmed, sweating, and white mist rose into the air.\nThe kobold leader, Vini, gazed at the group training habitually even in the cold winter, feeling greatly satisfied.\nDuring the month-long training period, Austin had instilled in them a behavioral habit of discipline. Although their physical fitness wasn’t impressive, their discipline had formed a genuine \"army\" prototype.\n\"Under Lord Austin’s leadership, the glory of the kobolds will illuminate the entire continent!\"\nHaving experienced over a month of various events, Vini firmly believed this.\nThis was not just wishful thinking. The other kobolds also sincerely believed that, under Lord Austin’s leadership, they would undoubtedly head towards a better future.\nHaving been in the so-called \"Great Tribe\" in the north, the kobolds came to realize how respectable and profound Austin’s knowledge was.\nNo one could imagine, just after a mere month’s training, a weak group of kobolds underwent an unprecedented transformation, successfully slaying beasts several times fiercer.\nNeither would anyone have thought that, with Austin’s simple guidance, the kobolds could peacefully get through this cold winter without worrying about food.\n\"Well done today, everyone. Dismissed!\"\nWith a series of tactical movements completed, the morning training was over, and Vini dismissed the group.\nIn the cold winter season, unless compelled by necessity, the kobolds usually did not venture outside.\nOnly by huddling together for warmth and minimizing winter expenditures could they conserve more food to survive the dreaded cold winter.\nHowever, having relocated here and become Austin’s subordinates, the kobolds had stocked up on more than enough food and naturally did not need to huddle in corners for \"hibernation.\"\nTo better build the village, the kobolds planned to head to the forest to cut down suitable trees with stone axes. By the time summer arrived, they would dry them out for suitable building materials. Simultaneously, to fend off the cold, they needed to gather more dry wood to improve the simple village’s survival conditions.\nJust as Vini, too, prepared to leave and get to work, a massive shadow suddenly descended from the sky, fanning the snow into a swirling storm.\n\"Your Highness Austin...\"\nSeeing the Blue Young Dragon arrive, Vini was initially startled, but quickly responded with a respectful address.\n\"Yes, you did well. I saw it from above.\"\nTraining continuously during the cold winter showed that this group of kobolds already possessed the necessary military qualities, making future tasks that much easier.\n\"All belongs to the glory of Your Highness Austin.\" Vini placed his right hand on his chest, his voice filled with devotion.\n\"No need to be humble; I merely laid the groundwork.\"\nAustin shook his head. During the month-long training, he personally led at the start, but later, once the kobolds knew the training content, he left most of the training to Vini, the kobold leader, himself not being one to steal the limelight.\nJust as Vini wanted to say something, Austin continued:\n\"By the way, Vini, do you kobolds have any cultivation or combat techniques?\"\nThis question had just occurred to Austin.\nActually, while dealing with the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader, Austin had realized the kobold’s limitation: their bodies were too weak. Even well-trained, they could not withstand powerful Magic Beasts.\nThe only way was to elevate the kobolds to extraordinary beings, much like ordinary humans becoming Knights through cultivation, acquiring Extraordinary Power to truly contend with formidable entities.\nHowever, achieving self-cultivation was no easy task, with one major difficulty being the need for suitable cultivation techniques.\nUnfortunately, the Dragon Race’s inheritance only included world knowledge, and due to the unique nature of Giant Dragons, they didn’t require any cultivation techniques to grow into the Legendary Sanctuary. Thus, Austin had no knowledge of this area and decided to ask Vini.\nIf Vini truly had kobold cultivation techniques, imagine a legion comprised solely of kobold Professional Knights—what a terrifying force that would be!",

      "content": "Chapter 15: Chapter 14: Searching\nWhen Austin first met Vini and the others, they looked like a group of refugees.\nThe cultivation and battle techniques that can systematically enhance one’s own strength are not something an average person can possess. According to Austin’s estimation, even among the numerous scattered Beastman tribe bases in the Kawa Great Forest, only the medium-to-large tribes with a population exceeding a thousand truly possess them.\nThus, the Blue Young Dragon did not place much hope in Vini, merely seeking some information from him.\n\"Cultivation and Battle Techniques?\"\nAs expected, upon hearing this, Vini pondered quietly for a moment before shaking his head.\n\"I’m sorry, Your Highness Austin. When we fled, we were merely low-level members in that Beastman tribe, not familiar with the details. But I did hear within the tribe that the tribal leader, Bear-Paw Leader, was already High Tier Bronze. If it’s that tribe, they should have cultivation and battle techniques and such.\"\nHigh Tier Bronze corresponds to a combat power of at least third-level magic beast strength, even the current Austin is no match. Of course, it’s impossible for that leader to capture Austin.\nHowever, such a truly extraordinary ability user is not someone ordinary people can deal with. Perhaps it would take a thousand or two thousand people to exhaust its strength to kill it.\nYet, if the tribe Vini mentioned truly possesses cultivation and battle techniques and such, then the tribe would not have only the leader as an extraordinary. Other extraordinary elites must exist besides him, plus the numerous ordinary Beastmen within the tribe—this kind of power is not something Austin can provoke at present.\n\"However, one day there shall be a battle!\"\nThough aware of the disparity in strength, Austin still couldn’t forget it. Though now there seems to be little conflict between the two, as things develop, the Great Tribe where the kobolds once stayed is bound to become a roadblock.\nTo prepare for the future, the Blue Young Dragon asked the kobold about the situation of the Beastman tribe.\nYet the Blue Young Dragon still overestimated this group of kobolds.\nAs one of the lowest races on the continent, the kobolds were also at the bottom tier within that Great Tribe, struggling hard along the line of life and death daily. Their impression of the tribe was limited to being very smelly, very dirty, very large... As for how many extraordinary professionals were inside, Vini didn’t know. The size of the tribe and its population were unclear to Vini, but he knew there was a lot.\nThe inquiry results were almost fruitless—not completely without gain.\nAt least Austin knew there was a strong neighbor to the north, which was over a hundred kilometers away.\nThis was inferred from Vini’s words. According to him, they were expelled by the Beastman tribe and traveled south for almost two months, amounting to at least hundreds of kilometers.\nThis could be considered a rare piece of good news—a considerable distance separating them, less concern about conflicts before growing stronger.\nMoreover, that large Beastman tribe serves as a barrier, resisting those Adventurers from the Central Earth Civilization Continent and various bankrupt peasant wanderers seeking gold within the Kawa Great Forest, providing Austin with a certain degree of safe space for growth.\n\"However, although the large Beastman tribe in front provides safety, it also limits development here... It seems I’ll have to find a time to explore nearby and see if any smaller tribes can be annexed.\"\nThough the Beastman tribe ahead repels much danger, it also blocks the influx of fresh blood.\nRelying on the seven adult kobolds under Austin, even if kobolds have considerable reproduction ability, forming a thousand-strong army would still take at least ten to twenty years, which Austin can’t accept.\nFortunately, within the Kawa Great Forest, tribes are numerous, countless Beastmen live here forming various large and small tribes. So as long as Austin expends some effort, he won’t lack enough population for development.\n\"Alright, go about your business.\"\nThinking of this, Austin casually gave an order, then spread his wings and soared into the sky, the airflow sweeping up numerous snowflakes.\n\"Yes, Lord Austin.\"\nAfter respectfully seeing the Blue Young Dragon off, Vini, finding nothing happening around, also began to join in the work of building the home.\n...\nHigh above, the cold wind howled.\nThe lingering cold air from the cold front swept through the heavens and earth, and carelessly plunging into that dispersing cold current might instantly freeze one into an ice statue.\nBut the robust body of the Dragon Race afforded Austin the benefit of ignoring such dangers; at most, encountering the chill would make him shiver, but his life wouldn’t truly be at risk.\nThe Blue Young Dragon was flapping its wings at several hundred meters altitude, its large eyes staring at the snow-covered earth below.\nTo increase his clan’s population and expand influence, Austin personally set out today. During a heavy snow, he went out searching for traces of small Beastman tribes around his territory to gather them under his banner.\nMany people make strong power. Utilizing the kobolds he trained as the core, then training and reforming newly joined clanspeople, his power must inevitably soar quickly.\n\"Such a beautiful scene—only the first one or two months can wander freely.\"\nSnow blanketed the earth like a thick quilt, the entire land covered in white, giant ancient trees adorned with crystal ice spikes, reflecting dazzling light.\nIt’s the beginning of the cold winter season, due to the sudden chill, those fierce magic beast hunters are just fed and curling up in their dens unwilling to come out. It’s the safest time of the year in the Kawa Great Forest.\nA little later, those magic beasts will have consumed most of their fat reserves, and without sufficient preparation, the fierce wild beasts, driven by hunger, will leave their warm dens—either freezing to death in the icy world or fortunately encountering another living creature on the snowy land. Driven mad by hunger, they’ll relentlessly attack and devour each other, at which point the Kawa Great Forest becomes most dangerous.\nDuring his first cold winter after rebirth, Austin nearly perished in that frigid season.\n\"This snow is too thick. I hope to find other traces before that.\"\nThe Blue Young Dragon sighed inwardly, flying north about twenty miles but still failing to find any trace of tribes or villages.\nPerhaps they’re there, but the snow has covered up the tracks, leaving Austin without results.\n\"Though the initial cold winter season is safe, the snow makes it difficult to find traces of other beastman tribes... Let’s fly another ten miles, if still no sign, forget it.\"\nWith determination set, the Blue Young Dragon flapped its wings quickly toward the distant sky.",

      "content": "Chapter 16: Chapter 15: Rout Soldiers\nA range of thirty kilometers is not small; in the previous world, it would have been about the size of a city, taking an hour or two even by car.\nHowever, perhaps due to the arrival of the cold winter, all creatures were hunkered down in their nests, not venturing out, and as a result, the Blue Young Dragon flew all the way without gaining any results.\n\"Damn it, it seems we can only let the Kobolds search slowly later.\"\nHaving gained nothing, Austin did not continue to fly forward but directly returned. After another hundred miles or so, he should reach the place the Kobolds mentioned as the Great Tribe, and the present Blue Young Dragon had no intention of running around stirring trouble.\nOn his return trip, Austin did not follow the original route back but took a wide detour, returning from another direction.\nAlthough the chances of discovering other tribes were slim, it’s always good to cast a wide net and search more areas.\nSubsequently, the Blue Young Dragon was immensely grateful for his decision.\nWhen he flew back to the old nest from another direction, about ten kilometers from the nest, he saw thick smoke rising from the mountains not far away.\nIn this cold winter, the probability of natural fires is almost zero.\nWhere there’s fire and smoke, it represents the activities of intelligent life in that place, either Beastmen or humans, and judging by the situation in the Kawa Great Forest, evidently, the former is more prevalent.\nHowever, that column of thick smoke was quite grand...\nAustin flew forward swiftly, harboring various thoughts.\nIn no time, Austin flew above the mountain from which the smoke was rising.\nWhat appeared before him was a village that had just experienced the ravages of war.\nThe whole expanse of snow-covered white land in that area was mucked up, dirty snow mixed with muddy water frozen into ice, stained with dried blood, but there was no corpse to be seen.\nThis tribe seemed to have just endured a \"battle.\"\nThe victor was evidently quite frugal, taking away all valuable items. The scattered five or six simple wooden huts were first dismantled, whatever could be taken was taken away, even the beams supporting the houses were dismantled and dragged away. Ultimately, whatever had no value was burnt to ashes.\nAustin hovered above a few times but did not discover anything of value, not even a person, as if they had already withdrawn.\nThe Blue Young Dragon pondered for a moment, hovered around a few times, and finally landed on the ground.\nEverything around was chaotic; Austin was no Sherlock Holmes, unable to deduce anything. However, from the ruins of those houses, he could simplistically guess that the population gathered here wouldn’t exceed thirty people. As for the main kind of Beastman, that’s something the Blue Young Dragon didn’t know.\n\"Hmm, although there are bloodstains, they’re not extensive—probably not many died, it looks more like they were expelled from the tribe after a defeat, or maybe captured entirely...\"\nIf it had been a brutal blood feud slaughter, the battlefield wouldn’t be so easily tidied up.\n\"Let’s search nearby; there might be some clues.\"\nResolute in his decision, Austin flapped his wings and soared into the sky.\nIf I can find scattered people and incorporate them into the Kobolds’ ranks, this would greatly benefit the expansion of Austin’s forces.\nEven if this battle resulted in the tribe being captured and annexed, finding the victor’s tracks and planning slowly in the future wouldn’t be a bad idea.\nAfter all, capturing populations through war is much faster than the natural breeding of Kobolds.\nThe Blue Young Dragon turned in the air and followed the trails on the ground.\n....\nMeanwhile.\nIn the Kobold village beneath the Blue Young Dragon’s nest, a group of Kobolds was preparing lunch.\nOn the mud-brick stove was a giant stone pot, with raging fire below boiling the water inside.\nThen, eight pieces of smoked ghost-headed crocodile meat were taken from the storeroom, not washed to avoid losing the oil on the meat, directly thrown into the stone pot to cook, then adding wild grains previously harvested along with some dried wild vegetables. After simmering for about half an hour, the wooden lid was lifted, and a big pot of aromatic food was ready.\nDue to the smoking on the surface of the meat, the whole pot of soup looked somewhat black, and with the wild grains not husked, it tasted smoky and scratched the throat.\nThis kind of food, in Austin’s view, was the worst kind of dark cuisine, but for these Kobolds, it was the most abundant food.\nHaving oil and meat and still being able to eat to fullness, this kind of life was something they never enjoyed before.\nEspecially during the cold winter, in previous cold winters, Kobolds managed with just one meal a day, consisting of dry grass roots.\nUsing bamboo ladles, the stew from the stone pot was scooped out into each Kobold’s wooden bowl. Then, the Kobolds gathered in groups, slurping the food down.\nThe aroma of the food permeated several hundred meters around.\n...\nAt this moment, a mile away from the Kobold village in the dense forest, a ragged team was fleeing in distress.\n\"Chief, Chief!\"\nThe Fox-faced Man, Quik, hurriedly caught up, grabbing the arm of the tribe leader, a strong Lizardman, who was frantically running ahead.\n\"Chief, we’ve run far enough; Simon’s group shouldn’t be able to catch up, let’s rest for a bit!\"\nFox-faced Man Quik looked somewhat grim; this tribe was a small newly established one this year, led by Lizardman Rodney, who once punched a forest lion to death before Quik’s eyes.\nIt was seeing Lizardman Rodney’s strength that motivated Fox-faced Man Quik to assist him in establishing a small tribe, gathering other Beastmen to share warmth and collectively survive the dangerous cold winter.\nBut who knew that as soon as the cold winter arrived, a nearby Jackal Wolfman Tribe would accuse Rodney’s group of encroaching on their territory, directly attacking the village Rodney and his people had spent most of the summer building.\nThe Jackal Wolfman leader was a Jackal Wolfman named Simon, a transcendent being, approximately Bronze Lower Tier. Despite being the lowest level of transcendent being, for Quik and other Beastmen, he was akin to a superhuman, his very form comparable to the leader Lizardman Rodney in size.\nWithout suspense, the tribe Rodney established was easily defeated by the Jackal Wolf People, expelled from the village, along with their food gathered over the summer falling into the hands of the Jackal Wolf People.\nIf it weren’t for the Jackal Wolf People valuing the food more than these defeated gravely injured individuals, they would likely have been slaughtered entirely.\nNonetheless, even as things stood, Lizardman Rodney and his group dared not linger, fleeing in panic for nearly ten kilometers.\n\"Lord Rodney, everyone is tired. Let’s find a place to rest first.\"",

Just go and rob some; there should be Beastman Tribes nearby. I refuse to believe every tribe has Extraordinary Professionals like the Jackal Wolves!\"\nRodney said fiercely, swinging the War Axe in his hand, which whistled.\nAt this time, the morale of the crowd slightly improved.\nYet Fox-faced Quik felt even more hopeless in his heart, for robbing did seem like a good plan, but they still needed to find a target!\nThose small tribes were usually well-hidden, especially in this icy winter; most tribes had already entered hibernation and wouldn’t go out to show traces. How to find targets in the vast, snowy land?\nHowever, just as Quik was about to speak, he suddenly caught a whiff of a scent.\nThe smell of food, the smell of meat.\nLooking around, it was obvious everyone had smelled it too.\n\"Hahaha, heaven indeed doesn’t forsake us. Let’s go and rob to our heart’s content!\"\nRodney laughed loudly, holding high the War Axe, leading the Beastmen as they walked toward the source of the food aroma.\nQuik was about to say something, but his stomach growled, the hunger surged in his heart, pressing down his words.\nA group of ragtag soldiers cautiously passed through the forest, the aroma in the air growing stronger, making mouths water.\nLogically speaking, being able to eat meat at the start of the cold winter season meant the tribe’s food supplies were ample, and their strength wouldn’t be too weak, not something this group of remnants could provoke.\nBut clearly, the hunger in their stomachs overcame their fear of the potential foe.\nPassing through a patch of woods, the Beastmen crouched in a small hollow, secretly observing the \"Great Tribe\" at the cliff’s bottom in the distance.\n\"How is it? How many Beastmen are there? How strong are they?\"\nRodney patted the Fox-faced Quik beside him and asked.\nThough driven by hunger, this did not mean Rodney lost his reason, foolishly leading people into another tribe’s camp just to die. At least he needed to assess the opponent’s strength.\n\"Lord Rodney, this...\"\nThe Fox-faced Man stared at the simple tribe below the cliff, his voice somewhat hesitant.\n\"Their number seems to be only seven... no, seven and a half.\"\n\"Seven and a half? Are you joking?\"\n\"No, I counted; there are indeed seven, seven Kobolds, and one Kobold child. Look, their village has only two houses; one should be a food storage warehouse, and that kind of wooden house can hardly fit ten people at most. I shouldn’t have miscounted.\"\nThe Fox-faced Man hesitated for a moment but still confirmed.\n\"Seven Kobolds? Then how could they have such good food?\"\nEven Rodney didn’t believe it, and Fox-faced Quik couldn’t believe it either.\nKobolds are one of the lowest races on the Seta Continent, weak and without special skills; when did they live so well, even with meat?\n\"No matter!\"\nLeader Lizardman Rodney turned to the group of ragtag soldiers behind him and shouted:\n\"You see! Ahead are merely seven Kobolds; for the sake of food, charge together!\"\nRodney flipped over the hill, raised the War Axe high, and charged at the Kobold village, followed by the hungry Beastmen, who also jumped out and rushed down.\nA gathering of assorted troops charging together; for a moment, there was a feeling of mighty momentum like thousands of troops.\nThe Kobolds, eating food, felt the ground tremble and immediately discovered the incoming Beastmen from afar.\n\"Enemy attack! Rise up!\"\nThe Kobold leader Vini reacted first, shouting swiftly, tossing aside the wooden bowl, and grabbing the Wooden Spear by the wall.\n\"Grab your weapons, assemble, and form ranks!\"\nAt Vini’s command, the Kobolds reflexively picked up Long Spears and assembled, forming a neat line with sharp spears protruding.\nBy this time, Lizardman Rodney was rushing at them, swinging the War Axe.\n\"Kill!\"\nRodney roared angrily, brandishing the War Axe aggressively as he charged at the Kobolds ahead.\nDespite these Kobolds acting strangely upon seeing someone much taller than them, instead of fleeing in panic, they stood still like some strange formation.\nBut that didn’t matter; Rodney believed as long as he charged into the Kobolds’ ranks and killed one or two, the rest would inevitably flee in panic, leaving their collected food in Rodney’s hands!\nRodney was very brave; mere Kobolds—did they think they could overturn the tables?\nThen,\nhe was utterly stunned.\n\"Stab!\"\nAccompanying a loud shout, the spear formation thrust forward, and Rodney’s vision blurred.\nThud, thud, thud!\nLong Spears tore through the air and pierced into his body, blood splattering, with immense force propelling him into the air.\nRodney, with his strong physique, ran faster than the tribe members behind him; when he clashed directly with the Kobolds, his tribe members were still about ten meters away.\nWhen Rodney was overwhelmed and flung into the air by the opposing Kobolds immediately, the Beastmen behind stepped on the brakes hard, bodies rolling clumsily and dropping onto the snowy ground.",

Well, it’s like this now.\nWith the strongest tribal chief as the core, leading a few trusted aides charging at the front, no discipline is needed, no tactics required, but the leading aura must be formidable and fierce.\nAs long as the tribal chief can cut down a few opponents first, the morale of the subordinates behind will soar, rushing forward in a frenzy to slaughter and defeat the enemy.\nIn fact, it’s nothing more than the street brawl style battles from Austin’s previous life, where nothing matters except for momentum.\nIf the momentum is established, then victory in battle is achieved.\nIt was precisely based on this that Rodney, upon seeing the Kobold village and knowing its strength, confidently jumped out.\nIn his mind, with his size towering above those Kobolds and his hard-earned Iron Weapons, it should be a simple matter to rush in, slay one or two Kobolds, and secure victory, shouldn’t it?\nWith this thought in mind, Rodney charged forward at full speed.\nAnd then,\nRodney crashed headlong into the well-organized ranks of the Kobolds, emerging battered and bloodied.\nHe could easily defeat a single Kobold, and even a large group, but against a group of Kobolds with army discipline and seamless cooperation, his defeat was certain.\nWhen Rodney was struck and sent flying, all the charging Beastmen were thrown into disarray, coming to a sudden stop.\nEven though there were only seven Kobolds in front, their orderly formation and lined-up Long Spears presented a copper wall and iron bastion, exerting an immense pressure akin to a gate of hell ahead.\nAfter all, their leader, the strongest Lizardman Rodney, was impaled and sent flying right in front of them!\nAll the while, the opposing Kobolds stood motionless, their formation undisturbed by a single misstep.\nIn fear and astonishment, the rapidly charging Beastmen ground to a halt, many tumbling and rolling on the ground in confusion, turning the entire Beastman group into a panic-stricken, headless flock of flies.\nSeeing this opportunity, Vini was certainly not going to let it slip and immediately gave the order:\n\"Raise spears, charge!\"\nThe Long Spears were lifted in unison, and the Kobold ranks charged forward in perfect order.\nThat unit, filled with iron discipline, was like a blade, invincible and unstoppable, causing Rodney’s Beastman subordinates to collapse at once, fleeing in panic and disarray.\nHowever, having already suffered a great defeat against the Jackal Wolf People earlier and fled here, they were already exhausted. By now, they were spent forces, unable to flee far.\nMore of the Beastmen collapsed in the snow, exhausted, and were subsequently captured by the Kobolds.\nThis conflict, rather than being a battle between Austin’s Kobold clan and the defeated Rodney Tribe, was more akin to a one-sided brawl.\nIn less than a minute, Rodney’s subordinates had completely collapsed, were annihilated, and became the captives of the Kobolds.\n\"Get to the corner, hands on your head, no looking around!\"\nOver twenty Beastmen were captured by the Kobolds and placed in a corner. To prevent escape, seven Kobolds stood guard with weapons, continuously patrolling and tightly monitoring the Beastmen in the corner.\nThe fate of these Beastman captives was to be decided only upon Austin’s return.\n...\nMeanwhile,\nTwenty or thirty miles away from the Dragon’s Nest, in a certain mountain range, a Blue Young Dragon soared above the sky. Its sharp eyes spotted a simple village built in a hidden mountainside location, over a kilometer away.\nIf not following the tracks on the ground and the wisp of smoke rising from the village, Austin might never have found the village’s location.\n\"A tribe made up of Jackal Wolf People?\"\nAustin landed on a large tree atop a distant hill, gazing at the village across the mountainside, calculating silently.\nOrc tribes surviving in the Kawa Great Forest usually mixed with other types of Beastmen. A single-race Beastman tribe was rare.\nUnless there was something special about this Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\n\"I’ll note it down, and deal with it when the opportunity arises.\"\nJudging from the range of this tribe, there should be about a hundred Jackal Wolf People living there, which was quite a force. Even if the seven Kobolds under Austin were well-trained, sheer discipline would be futile before hundreds of their kind.\nMoreover, in terms of physical strength and combat, Kobolds were clearly weaker than Jackal Wolf People.\nThis Jackal Wolfman Tribe was beyond what Austin could \"devour\" at the moment.\n\"But this Jackal Wolfman Tribe is somewhat close to the territory. To launch a surprise attack before they discover the Kobolds, early planning is necessary.\"\nIf these Jackal Wolf People discovered the Blue Young Dragon lurking nearby, they would surely prepare. Austin didn’t think his mere presence would dominate, making the Jackal Wolf People bow in submission.\nIf it were an adult dragon, perhaps these Jackal Wolf People might willingly submit to its clan.\nBut for a Blue Young Dragon, its power indeed fell short. It might take over a hundred years to fully grow, especially as a wild orphan dragon, making its comprehensive strength even weaker.\nIn this world, strength was supreme, especially for intelligent beings struggling for survival in such Barbaric Lands.\nTo conquer these Jackal Wolf People, Austin’s only way was to capture them, bringing them under his command.\n\"Their strength is a bit too much for now, but no hurry. Since a gathering place has been found, there should be other Beastman Tribes nearby. First, annex some smaller Beastman Tribes.\"\nHaving made up his mind, Austin took flight, preparing to return to the nest.\nBut as he soared up, his sight unexpectedly caught an irregular basketball-sized stone, half-buried in the soil, showing a greenish hue on its surface.\nInitially, Austin overlooked it, but as he turned away, a thought struck.\nA green stone?\nIsn’t this Copper Ore?!!!\nThe silhouette of the Blue Young Dragon sharply turned back, landing on the ground, and grasping the stone with his claw to inspect it closely.\nIt’s indeed Copper Ore!\nMoreover...\nAustin suddenly recalled something, and his claws began digging into the ground, unearthing several similar pieces of Copper Ore. Furthermore, he discovered that beneath the soil lay more and larger Copper Ores, almost integrated with the entire mountain range!",

      "content": "Chapter 19: Chapter 18 Transformation\nThe color of copper ore comes in many varieties: yellow, gold, blue, green, and several others.\nWhat left the deepest impression on Austin, however, was this green copper ore before his eyes, because in his past life, he had seen a remarkable person on video handcraft various tools and refine copper and iron in the wild.\nHis admiration for the video creator was so profound that Austin remembered the steps and refining methods very vividly.\nAt that time, he had also fantasized that if one day he were to traverse back to the primitive world, possessing this skillset might help primitive people enter the iron age ahead of time and dominate the primitive world.\nHe hadn’t expected life’s unpredictability, finding himself truly in a situation where this knowledge could be utilized, although he didn’t actually travel back to the primitive world.\n\"I didn’t expect there to be copper ore here, and from the looks of it, quite a substantial amount too.\"\nAustin stared at the copper ore before him, his eyes flickering as thoughts rapidly churned in his mind.\nIn this barbaric zone far from the civilized continent, items like copper and iron were exceptionally precious, with many large tribes of over a thousand people still stuck in the stone and bone tool stage. The few iron weapons they had were defective goods traded from the civilized continent.\nConveniently, Austin recalled the steps from that past-life genius who refined copper and iron by hand in the wild.\nIf he could seize this place and start a large-scale copper and iron refining industry, then arming his clan with copper weapons and clad in copper armor, combined with a well-trained army, wouldn’t they sweep through the entire Kawa Great Forest?\n\"In that case, this place cannot be easily abandoned.\"\nInitially, Austin had planned to wait until his forces were stronger before waging war against and annexing the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, but now it seemed imperative to make them an imminent target.\n\"I will return!\"\nThe Blue Young Dragon took a deep look at the distant Jackal Wolfman Tribe, spread its wings, ascended into the sky, and disappeared beyond the horizon, while the jackal wolf men, reveling in their victory, remained blissfully unaware...\n....\nIn the Dragon Nest Territory.\n\"His Highness Austin, thanks to you, the invading enemies have been defeated and captured. Whether to kill or keep these captives, we await your decision.\"\nKobold Vini stood before Austin, reporting everything that had transpired in the territory to Austin, quietly awaiting his response.\nLooking at the respectful Kobold Vini beside him, Austin felt quite speechless.\nHe had gone to great lengths to search for new clan members, but returned empty-handed. Although he unexpectedly discovered copper ore, it was only after braving the cold and traveling dozens of kilometers.\nYet these kobolds seemed to have captives delivered to their door while they feasted at home.\nSuch is the hardship of the dragon’s life; truly full of unpredictability!\n\"We shall transform them first, then incorporate these beastmen.\"\nA heavily wounded Lizardman Rodney lay dormant, alongside a Fox-faced Man, two sturdy Lizardmen, seven chaotic kobolds, and ten goblins, forming a total of 21 beastmen. If he could annex and absorb them, Austin’s clan strength would triple!\nOnce these beastmen were integrated into the kobold ranks, Austin would be able to organize a nearly thirty-strong beastman army, providing him with confidence against nearby Blood Wolf packs and even the nearby Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\n\"Transform?\"\nThe Blue Young Dragon’s thoughts were, of course, beyond Vini’s hearing, rendering him somewhat puzzled by the term.\nBased on past experience, defeated captives were either killed by their conquerors or enslaved as tribe members, so what did transformation mean?\n\"Yes, transform them.\"\nFor Austin, manpower was an incredibly valuable resource, not to be wantonly discarded. As for enslaving, that would result in extremely low production efficiency, which Austin could not accept.\nIncorporating them post-transformation into the current Kobold military system was the approach most beneficial to Austin.\nAs such, on orders from the Blue Young Dragon, a rigorous transformation process began for these captives.\nIn the early days, these captives were divided into three groups according to race, fed only half-full each day, and tasked with heavy labor dawn to dusk. Exhausted, they would collapse into sleep upon returning to their shacks.\nThe various tasks of tree-felling, hut-building, and wooden spear crafting became ordeals too agonizing for the captives to bear.\nEspecially after one day, when Austin noticed the new captives had littered the nearby forest with waste, he immediately ordered Kobold leader Vini to build a latrine at a distance, provoking much discontent among the captives.\nIn Austin’s plan, his clan’s population had surpassed thirty, within his manageable territory of a kilometer radius. Continuing with the old nomadic gathering methods was unsustainable.\nThis meant that raising the beastmen’s civilization level from gathering to agricultural civilization was imperative.\nIn the bountiful Kawa Great Forest, wild rice and wheat were not uncommon and were primarily used by Kobolds for winter storage.\nGiven the climate within the Kawa Great Forest, if they could collect and plant rice seeds collectively, supplemented by communal livestock breeding, it would yield enough to sustain the clan’s survival under Austin.\nAfter the cold winter season, Austin planned to teach this clan the slash-and-burn method of farming to support the growing population.\nThis latrine under construction wasn’t just for hygiene but was also a critical component in post-winter land cultivation.\nThe world had yet to develop a fertilizer industry, and dung was the best fertilizer in these times.\nBut during this cold winter, the frozen earth was as hard as steel. Attempts to dig with wooden sticks only resulted in lost sticks and mere pot-sized depressions.\nFortunately, Lizardman Rodney’s leader had an iron axe, promptly claimed by the kobolds as spoils of war, which enabled the creation of more wooden tools, sparing the captives from digging with stones or bare hands.\nEven so, each day’s labor left the captives utterly fatigued.\nThis coincided with Austin’s goal of wearing out these captives’ energy to the fullest extent, ensuring they never had a moment of idleness.\nFollowing several days of high-intensity toil, these beastmen had been worn out of all vigor and resistance. As the village beneath the Dragon’s Nest finally began to take shape, most of the work was complete.\nThe next step initiated the second phase of transformation.",

      "content": "Chapter 20: Chapter 18 Military Training\nIn the cold winter, large snowflakes fluttered from the sky. If you stayed outside for too long, you’d turn into a snowman.\nAnd at this moment, in the village beneath the Dragon’s Nest, amidst the colorful snow, stood such shivering snowmen.\n\"You bunch of trash, waste, scum! Polluting the air while alive, and wasting land when dead! Do you have shit for brains?\"\nKobold leader Vini stood in front of a group of prisoners, shouting curses loudly, looking very spirited.\nAt this moment, facing more than twenty shivering prisoners, and the eyes filled with fear and awe, Vini felt his life had reached its peak.\nEven though he didn’t understand what polluting the air and wasting land meant, those curses were learned from Austin back in the day.\nBut it was indeed very satisfying to curse like this,\nThinking back to when they were training, they were also cursed at by Austin until they doubted their very existence.\nBut now, finally someone else could enjoy the same treatment.\nSeeing someone suffer the same fate as they did back then, it felt like drinking a cold cola on a hot summer day, refreshing from head to toe.\nHowever, what Vini didn’t know was that everything he was doing inside the Dragon’s Nest was seen by Austin.\n\"This guy...\"\nSeeing Vini’s proud and complacent look, Austin slightly shook his head, already considering whether to add some burdens to this guy in future training.\nAt this time, the transformation of these prisoners had reached the second step.\nAfter wearing down the various thoughts in their hearts through heavy labor, the next step was military training.\nIn Austin’s previous life, military training was a necessary pre-academic training for middle school, high school, and university students.\nThis training not only brought new classmates closer but also cultivated a sense of discipline among them, having many benefits.\nAustin’s purpose for using military training as the second step of transforming prisoners was also due to this.\nThrough strict training, these prisoners would develop a collective sense of discipline.\nAnd by enduring tough military training together, these newly joined prisoners would develop a sense of collective honor towards Dragon Nest Village, bringing them closer to integrate these Beastman prisoners into Austin’s rule.\nThis was also the fastest way for the Blue Young Dragon to absorb these Beastman prisoners.\n....\nIn the morning, as the sun just rose, a team started running around the entire Dragon Nest Territory, shouting as they ran:\n\"Strive to reform, become a new person!\"\nIn the middle of the team, Goblin Gulu took a deep breath, the chilling wind felt like ice knives entering his throat, but his moving body was hot and sweating, his lungs seemed to burn, and under the contrast of the cold wind, there was an extraordinary sense of comfort.\nAfter completing the fifth lap of the morning run, with an order:\n\"Line up, fall in!\"\nA group of Beastmen who just finished the morning run automatically formed into three queues, arranged in three even lines, from shortest to tallest.\nGoblin Gulu mixed in with the Goblins, returning to his place in line, keeping perfect order.\nIn fact, he didn’t remember which row or column he belonged to, but as soon as the line was there, he could find his spot, it became instinctive.\nAt the very start, Gulu had no idea of his spot, and it was the same for other Beastmen.\nWhen Coach Vini told them to form ranks, they all huddled together randomly, uneven in height, gathered chaotically.\nNaturally, Vini got furious, and as a result, they all went without food for the morning.\nLater, everyone remembered.\nFirmly remembered.\nIn this Kawa Great Forest, food is always the most important thing.\nHunger is the main theme for the bottom races living on this continent.\nBeastmen have strong reproductive abilities, especially those of lower races like Goblins and Kobolds, even stronger.\nBut in this Kawa Great Forest, the lower races with strong reproductive capabilities haven’t conquered the whole forest, only clinging to a corner, because of the omnipresent famine.\nEvery year during the cold winter, half of the Beastmen living in Kawa Great Forest starve to death, as nature uses extremely cruel laws to maintain the life cycle of this world.\nThe craving for food seems to be ingrained in these Beastmen, and it was precisely because of this that when Vini cut off their morning food, all the Beastmen desperately memorized their lineup positions, completing Vini’s demands with incredible efficiency.\nUnfortunately, although Vini rewarded them with a meal of meat the day after due to their efficiency, he later often threatened them with famine, making all the Beastmen suffer.\nHowever, under such effective means, together with the assistance of seven \"old-timers\" who had undergone military training, this group of Beastman prisoners underwent a significant transformation within a month, forming the prototypical shape of a \"military.\"\nMoreover, this military prototype could directly integrate into the previous team of seven Kobolds, truly forming a collective, greatly enhancing the power of Austin’s Clan.\n\"Attention, at ease, attention!\"\nLooking at the rows of Beastmen standing straight like trees, unmoving, Vini nodded slightly, then looked at the morning sun on the horizon, calculating in his heart.\n\"It’s not time yet, stand for a few more minutes.\"\nAfter the morning run, it’s breakfast, but apparently, these Beastmen ran a bit fast, it’s not meal time yet.\nBut it’s okay, standing for a while is fine.\nIt trains the Beastmen’s discipline and their patience, after all, how nice is that?\nHowever, compared to Vini’s leisurely \"inspection\" on the side, Gulu in the queue felt like dying.\nInside the village’s stove, the firewood was burning fiercely, and the aroma of the food steaming in the stone pot wafted out with the white mist, sneaking relentlessly into his nose, causing the worms of gluttony in his stomach to tremble, and almost making his mouth water uncontrollably.\n\"Big head root, Tsumugi fruit, Valley Fragrance, and... meat?\"\nBefore these Beastman prisoners completed their transformation to become part of the Blue Young Dragon’s Clan, of course, they couldn’t be given the best food.\nIt was basically chewable tree roots, edible fruits, and grains made into a large pot.\nThat taste.....\nCould only fill the stomach.\nBut today, it seemed like there was a rare addition of smoked meat.\n\"Ancestors of the Goblins, why does time pass so slowly!\"\nGulu dared not move a muscle, but internally he was constantly wailing.",

      "content": "Chapter 21: Chapter 19 Food Crisis\nAfter training was over, it was time for breakfast.\nEach Beastman held a wooden bowl, neatly lining up to orderly approach the stove for breakfast.\nThose who got their meal first did not start eating immediately.\nIt wasn’t because they weren’t hungry or for any other reason, but because of the collective consciousness that Vini mentioned. They are a collective, so they eat together.\nOnce everyone had taken their share, they all sat on two long logs. Only after the last companion sat down did the Beastmen start devouring their food.\nThat breakfast was exceptionally delicious.\n\"Burp!\"\nGoblin Gulu burped, a white mist emerging from his mouth.\nFor him, since birth, he’d never known the feeling of being full; his memory was always of a hungry belly.\nBut during these days of captivity and transformation, Goblin Gulu finally tasted the sensation of a full meal.\nAlthough this life of captivity wasn’t particularly pleasant, with aimless toiling each day until exhaustion, compared to his previous days, Goblin Gulu clearly preferred the period of his captive life.\nHe even thought that if these days could last forever, it would be wonderful.\nA person who’s used to hunger will never want to return to those starving days after experiencing the taste of a full meal.\n\"His Highness Blue Dragon is truly benevolent!\"\nRecollecting the political lessons, the Kobold leader told them:\nAll our happiness stems from His Highness Austin; only His Highness Austin can save us; it is thanks to the benevolence of His Highness Austin that we can have a happy and wonderful life...\nand so on and so forth. Goblin Gulu found himself deeply agreeing with these words.\nHowever, Goblin Gulu didn’t know that with continuous brainwashing, both he and the other Beastmen, even the Kobold leader Vini, developed a wholehearted worship towards the Blue Young Dragon.\nAnd as time went on, this worship would one day evolve into an unparalleled fanaticism for Austin.\n...\nJust as Goblin Gulu reminisced about past hardships and present circumstances, the Kobold leader Vini approached Austin with a troubling issue.\n\"His Highness Austin, if things continue like this, we won’t have enough food. Should we halve the food portions for the captives? Otherwise, we won’t make it through this harsh winter.\"\nVini’s face looked rather conflicted, carefully considering his words as he reported to the Blue Young Dragon.\nBefore the cold winter season, the Kobolds had actually prepared enough food to get through it, but who knew twenty or so Beastmen, having lost their tribes and escaped, would join later. Austin decided to transform and incorporate them into the Kobold army system.\nThis caused a direct increase nearly threefold in population, significantly increasing food consumption.\nAlthough they gained a large amount of meat when they besieged the Ghost-headed Crocodile, and the Kobolds had prepared well before the cold winter,\noriginally only needing food for seven and a half people, suddenly an additional twenty-one required consumption four times the initial calculation. Yet, the Blue Young Dragon was unwilling to reduce the captives’ food.\nThus, a food crisis loomed over the Kobold tribe.\n\"A food crisis...\"\nUpon hearing Vini’s detailed report, the Blue Young Dragon pondered silently.\nHonestly, he hadn’t noticed this situation either.\nBut solving it wasn’t that difficult.\n\"There’s no need to reduce the food portions for those captive Beastmen. As for food shortages, wasn’t there a lake reservoir filled with fish from when we exterminated the Ghost-headed Crocodile? After daily training, spare some time for them to fish there for food.\"\nBack then, when clearing the Ghost-headed Crocodile, the Blue Young Dragon had already planned to utilize fishing in this lake as a food source during the scarce winter.\nHe also planned, after the cold winter, to see if he could start a fishing industry in that lake.\n\"Fishing? But the lake has already frozen over with thick ice! Even if we break a hole, no one would dare to jump into the water in this weather.\"\nVini thought about the scene: in the icy world, a group of Beastmen, armed with stones and sticks, breaking a hole in the ice, then selecting a Beastman to jump into the water to fish. The result was that, just after one dive, the chilling water would freeze the person stiff, and after laboriously climbing back up, they’d already become a \"popsicle.\"\nVini quickly shook his head, dismissing such a terrifying thought from his mind.\n\"His Highness Austin, that method really won’t work!\"\nThinking about how each dive into the water to catch fish would freeze a Beastman to death, the voice of Kobold leader Vini trembled slightly.\nThe Blue Young Dragon glanced sideways at Vini, who barely counted as a competent lackey standing in front of him, his eyes looking as if he was gazing at an idiot.\n\"You don’t need to jump in, just heat up a hole on the ice with fire, and the fish under the water will float up. You can also pour hot water down that hole to gather the fish faster, and then you just catch them from above.\"\nThe cold winter’s chill had sealed the entire lake surface with ice, and the air in the water below was constantly being consumed. During the whole freezing season, the fish under the water were in a state of hypoxia.\nBy opening a hole in the ice layer, those oxygen-starved fish would naturally flock over.\nAs for pouring hot water, that’s because the fish can’t withstand the frigid temperatures, and boiling water contains more oxygen than the water under the frozen lake surface.\nThe warm currents and oxygen rapidly spread to the surroundings beneath the lake, hastening fish gathering.\nCatching fish by opening holes in winter was a technique Austin had seen on TV in his past life.\n\"That’ll do?\"\nVini said, his tone cautious, his voice a bit hesitant.\nWould fish really gather just because a hole was opened? Were they really that dumb?\n\"Just do as I say. If it doesn’t work, come back to me.\"\nAustin shook his head, not bothering to explain further.\nNo wonder the numerous Beastman races in the Kawa Great Forest lived in hunger; many things were yet undeveloped, living in ignorance, their lifestyle resembling the ancient ape-man civilization of Austin’s previous world.\n\"Didn’t you have plenty of vines left from your previous gathering? Use those vines to weave a basket, and then you can catch fish from above the hole using the basket.\"\nAfter thinking a bit, Austin continued:\n\"After you’re finished fishing, don’t forget to reseal the hole with ice before you leave, otherwise, the next time you make a hole, you won’t catch any fish.\"\nSealing the hole was to ensure the fish beneath the lake become hypoxic again, facilitating fish gathering for future fishing sessions.\n\"Also, you need to speed up your training; time is running out. This time, the enemy you’re dealing with is not as easy to kill as the previous Ghost-headed Crocodile. Carelessness could lead to death.\"\nThe cold winter had already lasted more than a month, while the Blood Wolf pack Austin planned to eradicate still roamed freely around their territory.",

      "content": "Chapter 22: Chapter 20: Breaking Ice on the Lake\nIt’s not just that Austin is petty and vindictive, begrudging the Blood Wolves for nearly leaving him stranded there. Having such a group of hunters wandering within Austin’s territory is ultimately a threat.\nIf the Dragon Nest Village intends to expand its development in the future, this Blood Wolf pack must be eradicated.\nAnd during the cold winter, it is the easiest time to track down the Blood Wolf pack.\nHunters like the Blood Wolves don’t have the concept of storing food for the winter. Even in the cold season, the Blood Wolf pack has to venture out to hunt, which provides Austin with the optimal time to find them.\nFor the elimination of the Blood Wolf pack, the sooner it is done during the cold winter period, the better. Recently, while Austin was flying out for hunting, he had already spotted traces of some hungry and ferocious hunters venturing out. If the eradication of the Blood Wolf pack later attracts other hungry and mad wild beasts, that would not be good.\nThe more the action is delayed, the more dangerous it becomes.\nFortunately, the captured Beastmen have mostly completed their training now, integrating into the Kobold military system, greatly enhancing the strength of Austin’s clan underlings.\nAt least, with the number of forces doubled, the confidence to face the Blood Wolf pack has increased significantly.\n...\nNot to mention that the Blue Young Dragon was constantly contemplating how to deal a severe blow to the Blood Wolf pack and frequently ventured out to search for enemy traces.\nOver at the Dragon Nest Village, efforts began to address the lack of food.\nThe next day, there was no more snow, the clouds in the sky had all settled, and the entire sky resembled a massive ice cube, a vast expanse of blue.\nIn the Dragon Nest Village, a joint military exercise took place early in the morning, with the previously trained Kobolds also participating.\nRanks stood neatly like steel, forming an unyielding formation. Long spears waved in unison, their simple movements exerting significant visual impact, with shouts echoing across the skies.\nThe newly integrated Beastmen, although untested by blood, with the fusion of experienced Kobolds, weren’t expected to lack much in combat power.\nAfter the military exercise, instead of the anticipated military training, the Beastmen, following the command of Vini the Kobold, took up their tools and went to a nearby frozen lake.\n\"Mom, is fishing in winter really that simple?\"\nAmong the team, the little Kobold Nina also joined in, helping to drag a wooden basket woven with vines on the side.\nThe basket was as tall as she was, swaying side to side as she walked, yet she refused help. During the cold winter, Nina found herself doing very little, which made her feel uncomfortable being idle, so she volunteered to come and help this time.\n\"This was personally instructed by His Highness Austin, so it should be possible.\"\nThe mother Kobold appeared slightly hesitant. However, those who had been the earliest followers of Austin had long regarded the Blue Young Dragon as a deity, with unwavering faith in the Blue Dragon’s words. Despite some doubts about catching fish so easily, they followed Austin’s instructions without hesitation.\n\"Yes, for sure the Blue Dragon’s words are correct.\"\nNina nodded promptly. Sometimes, what children believe in is purer than adults.\nIn some sense, the earliest Kobold clans, intentionally cultivated by Austin, had become the prototype of his fanatic followers.\nThe lake wasn’t far from the Dragon Nest Village, and soon, the group of Beastmen arrived at the frozen lake.\nThe cold winter chill was indeed severe, covering the entire lake with a thick ice layer. Vini walked a circle on the lake, feeling the ice beneath his feet was quite solid.\nVini looked around the white expanse, exhaled into his palms, releasing white mist into the cold breeze that dissipated in the air.\n\"Where exactly should we dig the hole? Oh well, since His Highness didn’t specify, let’s just pick any spot and start digging.\"\nHaving no other options, he randomly chose a spot near the shore and called over the Beastmen to help dig a hole.\nChoosing the shore was out of concern that during the digging, if the ice cracked and they fell into the cold water, they could easily climb out.\nUnder Vini’s command, the Beastmen divided into three groups, each working within the outlined circles nearby to continuously chisel the ice.\nSince the hole didn’t need to be very large, too many people crowded together would hinder the process, thus dividing them into three teams worked perfectly.\nHowever, after the Beastmen pounded the ice with all their might, even the strongest Lizardman using a sharp rock could only chisel out a bowl-sized dent, still far from reaching the ice beneath the lake water.\nAs for the short and slight Goblins, it was even more laborious.\n\"This...\"\nFaced with the steel-hard ice in the cold winter, Vini the Kobold leader was speechless.\nNo wonder no Beastmen had discovered this method to catch fish before. First, when the cold winter hits, the Beastmen mostly stay in their dens and don’t venture out. Even when starving and forced outside looking for food, who would bother wasting energy to dig through the ice layer? Yet how did His Highness Blue Dragon know about this method?\nVarious thoughts flashed through Vini’s mind, but he soon brushed them aside. The priority now was to dig the hole and catch fish; otherwise, the cold winter would be hard to endure.\nFortunately, Austin gave another method for digging holes on the ice surface. Earlier, the plan was to use stone tools to try chiseling a hole simply; now, that approach seemed unfeasible.\n\"Go to the forest and find fallen dried branches to prepare for burning.\"\nWith no other choice, they had to use the method suggested by His Highness Austin.\nSoon, a Beastman returned from the forest carrying a bundle of dry branches. Fortunately, in the cold winter, the moisture within the dry wood had already settled, making it decent firewood.\nBut when the bundle of dry wood was piled onto the ice, Vini the Kobold leader faced another major issue.\nThey couldn’t light the fire.\nIn the extremely low temperatures outside, with the cold wind blowing, the heat generated by striking stones quickly dissipated into the air, making it impossible to start a fire.\nHelplessly, they sent a Beastman back to the Dragon Nest Village to bring fire using wood.\nDuring this process, due to rushing or the kindling quickly burning out before reaching the lake, the fire went out several times.\nHowever, good things come with perseverance, and they finally managed to start a fire on the ice.\nWatching the fire on the ice surface, burning fiercely, melting the layer beneath, the Beastmen quickly drew out the melted water using leaves and other means, repeating the process, about ten minutes later, a pit about the size of a stone basin, around ten centimeters deep, appeared on the ice.\nThrough the thin ice layer at the bottom of the pit, the water underneath was already visible.\n\"Bring a Wooden Spear.\"\nRemoving the firewood, they grabbed a Wooden Spear and jabbed it into the thin ice layer at the bottom of the pit.\nCrack!\nWith a crisp shattering sound, the last layer of ice fragmented like glass, revealing the flowing water beneath. The Beastmen all leaned in to look.\nThe hole had been made, would they succeed?",

      "content": "Chapter 23: Chapter 21 Successful Capture\n\"How is it? Have any fish come over?\"\nOne by one, the Beastmen poked their heads out, looking toward the hole, their eyes filled with anticipation.\nThey saw the ice hole, the size of a stone basin, with calm lake water below, not a ripple in sight, as if even the water had frozen to death, unmoving.\nAll the Beastmen held their breath, not daring to make a sound.\nA minute passed, ten minutes passed, half an hour passed...\nThere was nothing.\nA group of Beastmen eagerly waited near the hole, the falling snow almost turning them into snowmen.\nOne couldn’t say there was nothing; through the hole, one could still see some shadows swimming leisurely beneath the surface, each fish about the size of a Kobold. However, the imagined scene of countless schools of fish rushing to the hole for oxygen did not occur.\nThe fish that gathered here basically didn’t surface, any slight movement caused them to flee.\nThere was, however, a Goblin who, during this time, speared a half-pound fat fish, but that was it.\n\"It’s not bad; having sharp-eyed Beastmen guard the hole daily can still yield some meat...\"\nThe Kobold leader Vini felt a bit disappointed in his heart, but although the bountiful catch His Highness Austin described wasn’t realized, it was at least a food source.\nOne must know, in the cold winter, being able to find any food is already very good.\nBeastmen shouldn’t be too greedy.\n\"Leader Vini, what next...\"\nAll the Beastmen turned their gaze to Vini, waiting for his next idea.\n\"First, widen these holes and then get a few people to take turns spearing fish here.\"\nThis matter still needs to be reported to His Highness Austin, but to overcome the food scarcity crisis of the cold winter, His Highness Austin would likely not oppose it.\nHowever, the ice hole appeared somewhat small, and it needed to be widened to operate smoothly; otherwise, it’d be inconvenient.\n\"Let’s do it this way...\"\nAlthough this trip didn’t completely solve the Dragon Nest Village’s food crisis, being able to find a relatively stable food source in the cold winter was already great. His Highness Austin’s knowledge was astonishingly profound, truly worthy of being born noble among the Dragon Race.\nJust as Vini was preparing to lead the team back, he suddenly realized he had forgotten something.\nHot water,\nAh yes, hot water!\nEarlier, he was so nervous that he even forgot about this.\nThe Blue Young Dragon had mentioned yesterday during a conversation that pouring hot water down might speed up the fish gathering.\nBut... does this work?\nA trace of doubt crossed Vini’s heart, but he quickly snuffed it out; His Highness Austin was absolutely correct, whatever His Highness believed was sure to be right.\n\"You guys go back to the village and boil a bucket of hot water.\"\nRandomly pointing at a few Kobolds, Vini instructed.\nWhile those Kobolds went back to the village to boil water, Vini led the Beastmen to widen the hole.\nWith a hole already there, smashing ice along the basin-sized opening’s edge made it faster than before, no need for fire to melt it.\nShortly after, they had smashed the ice to create a hole about half a meter wide. Then Vini ordered that the rattan basket they brought be submerged into the lake water through the hole. The rattan basket was tied with rattan strings, so when fish swam in, a quick pull could catch them. It was much better than spearing fish.\nHowever, the fish underwater were not fools; after catching them a few times with this method, it became very difficult to catch more fish.\nHopefully, the hot water method works, Vini felt a bit anxious.\nSoon, a few Kobolds came hurriedly carrying a stone basin steaming with hot water.\n\"Alright, quickly come over and pour it down!\"\nVini instructed the Beastmen nearby to make way, and the Kobolds lifted the steaming hot water and poured it down the ice hole.\nSplash!\nVigorous waves surged up, shrouding everyone present in heavy mist.\n\"How is it? Any results?\"\nClearing away the mist, the Beastmen eagerly craned their necks toward the hole.\nThe rippling waves gently settled, and the mist over the water gradually dissipated.\nYet, amid their hopeful gazes, nothing unusual happened in the lake water inside the hole.\n\"Sigh.\"\nVini sighed, and the Beastmen around him looked deflated.\nIt seemed the hot water method was unfeasible.\n\"Forget it, let’s head back first.\"\nJust at that moment,\nSplash!\nSuddenly, the sound of surging water erupted, and the lake water within the hole noticeably surged.\n\"What was that just now...\"\nVini hadn’t yet reacted when, simultaneously, the splashing water resounded again, but this time it didn’t immediately settle; instead, the rippling waves continued to churn.\n\"Fish, fish!\"\nShadows quickly rushed over from beneath the ice, gathering at the hole’s edge.\nThe surrounding Beastmen excitedly pointed at the densely packed fish swarming the hole, shouting loudly.\nThe lake water beneath the ice hole was occupied by a dense school of fish appearing out of nowhere. Some even jumped out of the water, and one accidentally fell on the ice, quickly caught by a nearby Beastman.\n\"Successed!\"\nThe Kobold leader Vini breathed a long sigh of relief; there was now hope for food this cold winter!\nThough he didn’t understand the principle, nor why pouring a bucket of hot water attracted so many fish, it didn’t hinder Vini from following Austin’s guidance and reaping unprecedented success.\n\"Raise the basket!\"\nTaking advantage of the mass of fish gathered, Vini quickly ordered the previously submerged rattan basket to be pulled up.\nSplash!\nA great amount of water flowed down through the basket’s gaps, leaving a large number of fish flapping inside.\n\"Great!\"\nWhen the basket was pulled up, Kobold Vini looked inside, seeing it half-full with big and small fish bouncing at the bottom, and couldn’t help but smile.\nMeanwhile, the fish gathered at the hole seemed unaware of their kin disappearing, still eagerly swimming over, filling the gap left by the basket-caught fish, occasionally jumping out of the water.\nSeeing this scene, all the Beastmen felt reassured, thinking they could now eat well and get through this cold winter.\nAn indescribable joy surged in the heart of every Beastman, a joy of harvest, an excitement of looking forward to better days.\nEver since their birth, cold winters in their memories were spent in hunger, but now seeing hope of eating meat daily made them thrilled beyond measure.\nAt the same time, in the hearts of many Beastmen, the respect for His Highness Austin, who suggested this method, increased once again, elevating his status further.",

      "content": "Chapter 24: Chapter 22 Crisis Strikes\nA bountiful harvest during the cold winter season made the entire Dragon Nest Village excited at this moment. Obtaining a sufficient food source during the resource-scarce winter season was something the Beastmen couldn’t even imagine in their past experiences.\nBut now they had indeed succeeded, and seeing the way the fish swarmed at the bottom of the lake, it would take quite a while to catch them all. At least it could provide enough food for the tribe to get through the cold winter, and all of this felt like a dream.\nGetting enough food from the lake reservoir meant that the Beastmen no longer had to worry about starving during this winter. It also meant that before the arrival of the scorching summer, these Beastmen could freely reproduce, allowing the tribe’s population to grow naturally by next year.\nA group of Beastmen carried several baskets of fish and returned to the Dragon Nest Village. After that, the Beastmen repeated the process a few more times, fishing until the initial hot water completely neutralized by the cold water and the warm current disappeared, causing the fish to scatter and leave, before they finally stopped.\nHowever, just these few attempts provided enough fish to sustain these Beastmen for nearly ten days.\nOn the way back, the Beastmen were in high spirits. Compared to their previous hesitation, every Beastman now bore a smile on their face.\nSpurred by the moment, they even started singing loudly.\nAt this time, the sun was setting, casting a layer of yellowish glow over the white earth. The shadows of the departing Beastmen, elongated by the sunset, weaved back and forth.\nReturning to the Dragon Nest Village, the entire village became busy.\nAlthough the extremely low external temperature during the cold winter acted as a natural refrigerator, preventing food spoilage to some extent, the fish still needed to be processed.\nAs the Beastmen were busy in the ice and snow, the Kobold leader Vini came before Austin and reported everything that happened today to him.\n\"Is that so...\"\nAfter breaking the ice hole, it wasn’t the oxygen influx that attracted the fish schools, but rather the hot water that did the job.\nAustin contemplated for a moment and vaguely guessed one or two reasons.\nThis might indeed be the result of the varying environment in the Otherworld; perhaps due to the mysterious plants at the lake bottom, the area beneath the ice wasn’t severely lacking in oxygen. However, the fish at the lake bottom were also cold-averse, and under such circumstances, it wasn’t impossible for them to instinctively swim towards warmer areas. Thus, when the hot water was poured, it gathered many fish. Coupled with the cold stunting their reactions, it allowed the Beastmen to easily harvest them.\n\"You all did very well; you’ve worked hard all day today, so take a day off and no training tomorrow.\"\n\"Yes, Your Highness is merciful.\"\nWatching Vini’s departing figure, the Blue Young Dragon already began plotting in his heart how to deal with the lurking pack of Blood Wolves nearby.\nWhile out today, he discovered the footprints left by those beasts nearby. Although he hadn’t actually seen them, Austin believed those beasts approaching here surely had bad intentions.\n\"The cold winter has lasted for over a month now, and it’s likely harder to find food. Hmph, let’s take care of them within these few days!\"\nHaving made up his mind, the Blue Young Dragon then yawned.\nHe’d been feeling drowsy these past few days, and Austin clearly felt his body had grown slightly, with his magic power beginning to grow slowly.\n\"Is this about to be a slumber?\"\nThe Blue Young Dragon pondered quietly. From the Dragon Race’s memories, a Young Dragon’s slumber was a necessary phase of growth, easily sleeping for years.\nBut Austin, unlike those Young Dragons with parental care, estimated that sleeping for one or two years might not starve him to death, but he’d probably end up as excrement among the other fierce beasts.\n\"Fortunately, I can still control it.\"\nPerhaps due to crossing over, Austin’s spirit was stronger than an ordinary Young Dragon, allowing him to resist such sleeping impulses.\nDuring the slumber period, he could remain awake and active, though his nighttime sleeping hours increased.\nForget it, sleep first, deal with the Blood Wolf Demon Beasts in a few days.\nThough staying awake during the slumber period wouldn’t affect development, the drowsiness was indeed tormenting. Soon Austin surrendered to his instincts, lying down within the Dragon’s Nest and fell into a deep sleep.\n...\nMeanwhile, within the Dragon Nest Village.\nHaving finally processed all the fish amid this ice and snow wasn’t without getting wet; the cold water felt like icy thorns. The Beastmen’s hands and feet had become chilled, yet each Beastman, upon seeing the processed fish hanging on sticks, turning into fish-sicles under the cold wind, wore a satisfied smile.\nAfterwards, the Beastmen lit a great bonfire in the middle of the village, hosting a primitive bonfire feast using the offal left from processing the fish.\nIn this cold winter, eating hot food, surrounded by the bonfire, they sang and danced.\nThis harvest was worth celebrating for all the Beastmen.\nDuring the festivities, a few Beastmen presented a primitive wrestling match to celebrate. Some Kobold couples made eye contact under the firelight and took the matter into their own hands, showing no concern for the other Beastmen around.\nThe Beastmen didn’t possess human concepts of shame, remaining in a primitive state. Affairs between male and female Beastmen were akin to handling elimination issues at the beginning without caring about the venue.\nIf it weren’t for Austin’s anger, ordering the establishment of toilets, and mandating the Beastmen to solve personal hygiene there, the entire tribe might have been littered with \"landmines.\"\nThe entire banquet was harmonious and continued until late at night, only then did the Beastmen finally return to their houses and retired to sleep.\nAs the last Beastman lay down, the whole village calmed, with the firelight quietly dancing.\nApart from the increasingly loud wind outside, there were no noises.\nThe cold wind howled outside, the wailing sound seemingly resembled cries of ghosts and wolves around.\nAt this moment, when all the Beastmen were asleep, unbeknownst to them, something was happening slowly.\nThe sleeping Beastmen naturally didn’t know, the fishy smell emitted during their fish processing was carried by the cold wind, drifting over snow-capped forests, spreading over ten kilometers and entering the nostrils lurking beneath the snow-laden grass.\nUnder the leadership of a large silhouette akin to a bison, covered in blood-red fur resembling burning flames, shadows cautiously followed the origin of the fishy smell.\nBefore long, outside the silent Dragon Nest Village, shadows began to move within the dark forest, encircling the Dragon Nest Village from all sides, with occasional green flashes.\nSilently, the deeply asleep Beastmen were utterly unaware...",

      "content": "Chapter 25: Chapter 23 Night Raid\nIn the deep of night, a biting cold wind howled, echoing with ghostly wails.\nIn the darkness, among the blood wolves, the Blood Wolf Leader, with a body as robust as a calf and fur as if dyed in blood-red flames, stared at the village illuminated by flickering firelight up ahead, baring its sharp, cold teeth.\nHundreds of blood wolves beside it shifted their gaze with gleaming green eyes toward the leader, waiting for its command to charge forth and tear apart the seemingly fragile village!\nToday could truly be called the blood wolves’ lucky day.\nHaving gone without a hunt for three consecutive days, their stomachs growled with hunger. To obtain enough food, the Blood Wolf Leader had even led the pack into the dreaded territory of the Blue Young Dragon.\nUnexpectedly, just as they ventured into that area, an alluring fresh scent wafted through the air, guiding them here.\nLooking at the village ahead, the enticing aroma of food drifted out, making their mouths water.\nAbout thirty Beastmen, along with an abundance of food.\nThis was a feast!\nThe Blood Wolf Leader bared its mouth, white vapor puffing out as corrosive liquid dripped onto the ground.\n\"Roar!\"\nA low growl reached the ears of all the blood wolves.\nThis was the signal to attack!\nAbout thirty Beastmen, though troublesome, they were confident they could slaughter these opponents for food, and together with the fresh fish, wiping out this village would see them through the cold winter!\nAlthough the village had that detestable smell, the Blood Wolf Leader couldn’t care less about that.\nWith its command, countless shadows emerged from the darkness, surrounding Dragon Nest Village from all sides. They moved with extraordinary silence, making not a sound, and in no time, they had slipped over the village’s crude fences, stealthily approaching several wooden houses.\nSilence,\nDeathly silence.\nInvisible, a terrifying killing intent permeated, quietly seeping into every corner of the darkness, with danger looming silently.\nInside the houses, the Beastmen were oblivious to the impending danger, their snores vying as they remained in a deep slumber.\nYet, just as the blood wolf pack encircled the houses, with a few wolves preparing to slip inside and kill the Beastmen,\ncreak!\nThe door opened, and Goblin Gulu rubbed his eyes as he stepped out of the house.\n\"Jeez, it’s so cold. Does His Highness Blue Dragon have to build a toilet? In weather this cold, we used to do our business directly in the nest...\"\nAwoken by his bladder, Goblin Gulu got up to go to the toilet, shivering as he was hit by the cold wind. He couldn’t help but grumble inwardly.\nThe construction of the toilet was troublesome for those Beastmen. In the cold of night, handling hygiene requires passing through the unsheltered courtyard, enduring the cold wind for a good while.\nHe was about to step out when Goblin Gulu suddenly froze.\nOn the white ground ahead, shadows surrounded the village, pairs of green-glowing eyes all focused on him.\nGulu was stunned. The blood wolves creeping toward the house paused as well.\nThe air suddenly grew quiet,\nthen,\n\"Wolves! Wolves!\"\nGulu burst back inside, slamming the door shut with a bang, his shrill voice piercing through the night sky.\nAt the same time, the wolves outside reacted as two strong blood wolves charged ahead, ramming into the door.\nBam bam!\nThe flimsy wooden door shook, about to shatter, scaring Gulu senseless as he pressed against the door with all his might.\n\"Quick, get up! Wolves! Wolves!\"\nGulu’s screams and the banging on the door finally roused the slumbering Beastmen, with Kobold Leader Vini waking first. Seeing the wolves outside lunging at the cabin through a crack in the door, his dog eyes narrowed sharply.\n\"Everyone, get up! Form up!\"\nWith the familiar, loud military order, the Beastmen instinctively stood up, quickly shaking off their drowsiness.\n\"Rodney, Dickens, Eleanor, you three grab wood and charge out, everyone else follows behind!\"\nThe three named were the strongest Lizardmen.\nThere was little hesitation; a month of military training had induced a reflexive obedience to commands.\nThe three hulking figures, nearly two meters tall, each grabbed a wooden log used as a seat, opened the door, and stormed out together.\nThe wolves originally preparing to assault the cabin were caught off guard as the behemoths rushed out, the objects in their hands slicing through the air, directly sending the wolves flying.\nThe blood wolf pack prowling and circling outside recoiled in fright, retreating some distance, and growled lowly.\nBy this time, the Beastmen had rushed out of the house, clutching the Wooden Spears usually used for training and leaning against the walls of the building.\n\"Form up, defend against the enemy!\"\nWith a command, the formation swiftly adapted,\nshort ones at the front, tall ones at the back,\nleaning on each other, spears bristling, forming a hedgehog-like circle in no time.\nOutside, the hundreds of blood wolves surrounded the Beastmen, prowling at the boundary, growling in a display of menace.\nMeanwhile, the Blood Wolf Leader, hidden among the wolf pack, looked at these different breed of Beastmen, both in reaction and demeanor, instinctively feeling uneasy, as if it had overlooked something.\nIn the past, they had besieged Beastman tribes before.\nBut among the Beastman tribes they had encountered before, never had they seen Beastmen react this way.\nIn previous attacks on Beastman tribes, once discovered, the strongest Beastman leader would charge out, followed by a chaotic mass of Beastmen. Once they overwhelmed and killed the strongest Beastman leader, the rest would crumble and flee.\nBut now, the strongest one among these Beastmen not only didn’t charge out but stood still with a stick in hand.\nThe Blood Wolf Leader suddenly felt a wave of unease, but the hunger for food suppressed the discomfort rising from within.\nJust mere Beastmen!\n\"Awooo!\"\nThe Blood Wolf Leader howled into the sky, and the surrounding blood wolves’ eyes flared with red light, growing frenzy and violent, immediately charging ferociously toward the Beastmen.\nIn an instant, shadows surged like a tide...",

      "content": "Chapter 26: Chapter 24 Departure\nAustin was not particularly a military enthusiast before crossing, nor was he any military expert, so he didn’t quite understand military tactics.\nBut even being a military illiterate, one would still learn some basic maneuvers from modern society, such as now, the circular long spear formation where the kobolds leaned on each other, is the best way to face these wolf packs.\nInitially, one of the purposes of the Blue Young Dragon gathering the clan was to deal with the wandering blood wolf pack nearby, so during the military training process, this circular formation was often trained, showing complete order.\nLong spears stood like a forest, and more than thirty Beastmen ranged from short to tall, resembling a giant hedgehog.\nThe Kawa Great Forest is still an undeveloped barbaric land, and what’s more, the place where the Blue Young Dragon nests lies in a very secluded corner. When had these blood wolf packs ever witnessed such a formation?\nThey only regarded it as inexplicable behavior driven by fear, as the wolves growled lowly and charged forward eagerly.\nIf these wolves had seen the power of military formations in the civilized land, they would never attempt to assault such a tight formation, but alas, these blood wolves have not.\nThen, they smashed into the long spear formation, experiencing a severe blow.\nSplatter splatter splatter!\nAmid the successive dull sounds of long spears piercing into flesh, scalding fresh blood splattered, with the fierce blood wolves charging initially being impaled by the sharp spears in a short time, becoming dead wolves. The rear wolf pack continued to charge, but those bloody spears blocked them, making no progress.\nAfter three successive failed assaults, the blood wolf pack finally feared, staring at the corpses under the dense spear formation, the rear wolves halted, slowly retreated, keeping a distance, and looked at the iron wall-like defense line in fear, emitting low growls.\nThe blood wolf pack perpetually roamed but dared not charge again.\nThe Beastmen didn’t move an inch; beneath them lay the piled bodies of over twenty blood wolves from the previous assault, with blood spilling all over, but not a single blood wolf had penetrated the Beastmen’s dense formation, none were injured.\nThe two parties confronted each other. At this moment, among the wolves, the Blood Wolf Leader gazed at the unscathed Beastmen, feeling unprecedented rage.\nDuring its past encirclement of Beastman Tribes, it had never suffered such massive damage.\nMore than twenty casualties among its subordinates constituted substantial harm to their group.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nAmidst the earth-shattering roar, the Blood Wolf Leader’s full body seemed to ignite with blood-colored flames, transforming into a blood-colored bolt of lightning that darted out from among the blood wolf pack.\nIn a normal wolf pack, the alpha wolf is the most cunning entity, staying hidden within the pack, rarely moving easily to attack.\nBut this blood wolf pack is not a normal wolf pack, maintaining wolf pack habits, yet still being a group of magic beasts.\nAmong magic beasts, the strong are revered.\nThe alpha leader can only be the most powerful existence within the blood wolf pack!\n\"Careful!\"\nThe commanding Vini at the Beastmen group’s center only managed to glimpse a flash of blood-colored lightning before the giant figure arrived before them.\nFacing the imposing Blood Wolf Leader, the Beastmen were instantly startled, but their hands and feet instinctively swung the long spears here, several wooden spears pierced through the air, thrusting towards the Blood Wolf Leader.\nBut this time, they faced a real magic beast!\nWith a swipe of the Blood Wolf Leader’s claws, the piercing wooden spears made a snapping sound, breaking under great force, with the immense power crashing into the Beastmen, sending several flying.\nThe entire spear forest circular formation immediately showed a gap, the rear blood wolf pack howled madly upon seeing it, and with frenzied glints flashing in their green eyes, charged together alongside the Blood Wolf Leader.\nIf the blood wolf pack pushed through the breach, the entire spear forest circular formation would surely collapse, and the Beastmen would become lambs slaughtered by the blood wolves.\nFortunately, the kobold veterans who experienced encircling the Ghost-headed Crocodile reacted, quickly moving towards the gap, sealing it.\nPreviously smashing and breaking the wooden spears, the Blood Wolf Leader who sent several Beastmen flying leaped away urgently upon seeing this, but the rushing blood wolf pack from behind couldn’t brake in time, crashing directly onto the wooden spears, becoming skewered like candy-coated fruits.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nSeeing its kind once again die before these peculiar wooden spears, the Blood Wolf Leader completely enraged.\nA thunderous roar exploded in the open land, visible waves of air surged, sweeping forth, raising a gale on the open ground.\nAt this moment, the Beastmen array, having been somewhat shaky due to the previous breach, appeared ready to collapse under this horrifying roar.\nIf the Blood Wolf Leader attacked once more, this spear forest circular formation couldn’t withstand, it would be submerged by the blood wolf pack!\nIn the perilous moment, a thundering roar echoed in the sky, the shadow rapidly enlarged.\n\"You beasts dare come here!\"\nAustin, awakened from sleep by the Blood Wolf Leader’s howl, furiously swooped down from the Dragon’s Nest.\nOriginally, the Blue Young Dragon intended to trouble those beasts in a few days, but unexpectedly they came first?\nUnacceptable!\nWith massive wings carrying terrifying force swooping down from the sky, arcs of electricity sparked among the scales, stirring a huge gust.\nBang bang bang!\nSeveral blood wolves on the snow couldn’t dodge in time, immediately being flung away, like rag dolls smashed over ten meters away, ending lifelessly.\nThe Blood Wolf Leader, twenty meters away among the wolves, observed the descending figure in the field, still deeply enraged at the losses from this venture, but reason told it not to linger longer.\nEspecially since that bothersome big guy had also arrived.\n\"Awoo!\"\nDecisively, the Blood Wolf Leader howled skyward, signaling retreat.\nWith the wolf howl reverberating in the air, the wolves perpetually circling the Beastmen group, attempting attacks, gazed at the Blood Wolf Leader, scattered and swiftly departed, the previously dense wolf pack faded into the darkness like a tide.\n\"Bastards!\"\nWatching the blood wolf pack vanish into the dark forest, Austin wanted to pursue but ultimately stopped, angrily glaring at the place in the distance where they disappeared.\nIf they lured the tiger from the mountain, then his hard-earned Beastman \"army\" would be done for.\nRight now, the priority is to figure out the Beastmen’s damage situation and mitigate losses.",

Several simple wooden huts had holes punched in them from the earlier Blood Wolf raid, allowing cold wind to sweep in.\nA group of Beastmen were cleaning up the aftermath, carrying the injured Beastmen into the huts, and using simple tools to repair the huts that had been damaged by the wolf pack, at least blocking the openings.\nThe Blue Young Dragon landed in the midst of the scene, glanced around at the tragic situation, suppressed the fury in his heart, and asked Kobold leader Vini with a deep voice.\n\"How many of our people were injured?\"\n\"Reporting to His Highness, three of our people are severely injured and incapacitated, and eleven are lightly injured, with wounds caused by Blood Wolves, but they don’t seem to be serious.\"\nThe severely wounded were those who faced direct impact from the Blood Wolf Leader, and the lightly wounded were mostly bitten by Blood Wolves when they rushed out of the huts without weapons initially, or caught by wolf claws during the pack’s assault.\nDespite the densely packed wooden spear formation being effective against the wolf pack, under high-intensity pressure, it was inevitable that some Beastmen were accidentally injured.\n\"Fortunately, a Goblin discovered the tracks of the wolf pack first when they went out to relieve themselves; otherwise, if they’d snuck into the houses, it would truly have been a disaster.\"\nTalking about this made Vini shiver with fear, imagining the devastation if those beasts had quietly entered the houses. The Beastmen would surely suffer heavy losses without even having time to form a defense, let alone considering any counterattack later.\n\"The village guards were careless. Remember to assign people for night watch in the future. I don’t want incidents where the enemy sneaks in and is barely discovered afterward. Also, give credit to the Goblin who first warned us.\"\nThis incident served as a harsh reminder to Austin that places like the Kawa Great Forest are far from peaceful.\nAlthough he chose a rather isolated spot for the nest, surrounded by terrain that offered some safety, experiencing such attacks in the environment of the Kawa Great Forest isn’t rare.\nThis Blood Wolf attack was somewhat fortunate, just as the Goblin discovered their approach while relieving themselves; otherwise, the Beastmen sleeping at night might have been caught off guard.\n\"Yes, Lord Austin, but there’s one more thing...\"\nVini lowered his head in acknowledgment, a hint of hesitation in his tone.\n\"What’s the matter?\"\n\"We found while cleaning up that the food in the storeroom was stolen by the wolf pack.\"\nToday’s catch from fishing throughout the day, along with the leftover smoked meat of Ghost-headed Crocodile, was mostly taken by the Blood Wolf pack.\nDuring their retreat, the Blood Wolf Leader even made sure to take the food, and in the chaos within the village, nobody paid attention to this detail. It wasn’t until tidying up afterward that it was found the storeroom was nearly empty, leaving only some cereal grain and fruit seeds.\n\"Hmph! Those beasts!\"\nUpon hearing Vini’s explanation, Austin finally understood why the Blood Wolf pack attacked the tribe; it made sense that he noticed their tracks nearby. They likely came here due to food shortage, attracted by the fish scent when Beastmen were fishing and processing catches during the cold winter.\nGiven the sensitivity of the Blood Wolf’s nose, they couldn’t ignore the scent left by Austin’s activities nearby, yet they still invaded, clearly disregarding the presence of the Blue Young Dragon.\n\"For food, use these Blood Wolf carcasses to hold out for now. If it’s not enough, fish in the lake’s reservoir. As for those beasts, we’ll deal with them in a few days.\"\nWith over twenty Blood Wolves, Austin providing undistributed resources would sustain the Beastmen’s food supply without issue for a few days.\nOnce the injured Beastmen recover, that will mark the death of those beasts!\nThe following days entail recuperation and recovery.\nFrom this attack, three Beastmen were seriously injured, including one of the Lizardman fighters struck by the wooden spear wielded by the Blood Wolf Leader, akin to a heavy hammer hitting several Beastmen head-on, even breaking several ribs, leaving them to gasp on the ground.\nFortunately, the Beastmen’s life force is astonishing. Recovery wouldn’t be a problem after ten days to half a month of rest.\nAustin personally visited the wounded, specifically instructing Vini to take good care of the three severely injured Beastmen. They were heroes of the Dragon Nest Village, and it was crucial they recovered their health quickly.\nHowever, what the Blue Young Dragon didn’t know was that his casual exhortation profoundly impacted the captive Beastmen within the Dragon Nest Village.\nIn the harsh Kawa Great Forest, severe injury equates to death.\nIn other Beastman Tribes, losing mobility and the ability to acquire food would deem someone invaluable.\nDue to food scarcity, wounded Beastmen incapable of gathering food either starve or perish in agony, as no Tribe would squander limited reserves on those without value.\nBut Austin was different. His soul originated from another world, holding views entirely distinct from this one.\nMoreover, under his guidance, sufficient food was obtainable even in icy conditions, eliminating any need to deprive injured Beastmen of their rations.\nBesides, Austin currently needed to continuously expand the population of his growing Clan forces as, when the cold winter passed, developing land near the territory would require substantial manpower—how could he afford to easily abandon any Beastman.\nThe three severely injured Beastmen received excellent care, instantly causing a significant stir within the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nIn their past memories, the practice of abandoning wounded immobile Beastmen to fend for themselves was entirely reversed, as His Highness Austin not only personally visited the huts to offer comfort but also praise their valor, specifically instructing leader Vini to take good care.\nAll Beastmen watched all this unfold, fixing their gaze upon Austin.\nAt that moment, each Beastman present felt a sensation impossible to describe with words.\nIt was from that moment, a profound sense of belonging and unwavering loyalty toward Austin surged within all Beastmen’s hearts.\nIf prior attachment to Dragon Nest Village was due to ample sustenance, then now, it was further stirred by the Blue Young Dragon’s behavior, truly winning their hearts.\n\"A soldier dies for the one who knows them,\"—this saying encapsulates the inner conviction of all the Beastmen present.\nA seed of loyalty was planted within each Beastman’s heart, and it’s imaginable that, over time, this internal strength will grow into a towering tree.\nThen,\nWhere the spear points, nothing can withstand!",

      "content": "Chapter 28: Chapter 26 Provocation\nIn the snow, the Blood Wolf Leader casually bit to death a small deer that had come out to forage, shook its head, and looked up at the vast expanse of white land in the distance. The sunset was setting, its afterglow emitting the last rays of light, gradually dimming away.\nBy the reckoning of time, the cold winter season was almost in its final phase.\nThe last hours before dawn were evidently the darkest moments.\nDuring this final period, lacking food, fierce beasts that had starved for two months would be driven by hunger to leave their dens, wandering everywhere, hunting anything they could see alive.\nDuring this time, even the Blood Wolf Pack dared not roam freely, staying in their lairs as much as possible to minimize time spent outside.\nOf course, as the top hunter in the nearby area, the Blood Wolf Pack didn’t need to worry too much.\nGiven their agility, encountering a hunter of equal standing, even if they couldn’t win, they could still outrun them.\nThe real threat came from enemies in the sky, and those terrifying Magic Beasts that could casually crush them to death, threats which were not many even in the vast Kawa Great Forest.\nAnd once they really encountered one, it would be the time for their total annihilation.\nThe Blood Wolf Leader climbed onto a high snow mound, looking at the scattered Blood Wolf subordinates around, nodding silently.\nIt had been nearly ten days since the last attack on the Dragon Nest Village,\nalthough that raid was one of the rare instances where the Blood Wolf Pack suffered heavy losses, the gains were enormous. At least after bringing back the meat from the storehouse, the subordinates had grown considerably fatter these days, alleviating the previous food crisis, making it a huge gain.\nPerhaps, once they were short of food again, they could make another attempt in that dragon’s territory, to see how dragon meat tasted.\nSuch a thought suddenly arose in the Blood Wolf Leader’s mind.\nIn the next action, they would definitely move with more confidence. If it weren’t for that pesky Goblin sounding the alarm, the losses wouldn’t have been so heavy.\nAlso, after witnessing the Beastman’s spear formation, the Blood Wolf Leader wised up, never foolishly charging forward again.\nRegarding prey, having suffered once, it would never suffer a second time.\n\"Awoo!\"\nThrowing away various thoughts from its mind, the Blood Wolf Leader howled to the sky.\nIt was calling its subordinates.\nWith sunset already at hand, it was time to return to the lair.\nFigures flitted through the forest, following the path back to the lair.\nBut right then,\nWhoosh!\nSuddenly, a fierce wind arose, a massive shadow broke through the snow-laden forest from the sky, gigantic iron claws tearing through the air, scattering electric sparks in the emptiness, grabbing a Blood Wolf before the pack could react, soaring skyward again.\nWith a tremendous twist, the Blood Wolf caught in mid-air was immediately twisted with terrifying force, accompanied by the snapping of bones, the spinal column inside the Blood Wolf was shattered, the skull fractured, no longer making any sound.\nAt this moment, the shadow in the sky loosened its claws, and the lifeless Blood Wolf plummeted down like a cannonball toward the Blood Wolf Pack.\nBam!\nThe Blood Wolf’s corpse tumbled several times on the ground, scattering bursts of snowflakes, causing the surrounding Blood Wolves to scatter.\nAt this moment, the massive shadow in the sky turned, suddenly swooping down again upon a gathering of Blood Wolves.\nThe Blood Wolf Pack had no time to evade, once more a Blood Wolf was taken, and the shadow repeated its trick, twisting the neck of the Blood Wolf in its claws before dropping it from the sky.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nThe Blood Wolf Leader erupted with fury, roaring skyward, visible waves of air surged upwards, rippling out as rings of waves.\nThe shadow in the sky was none other than the Blue Young Dragon Austin!\nThe Blood Wolf Leader felt immeasurably angry, relying on aerial combat advantage to hunt, such tactics were employed only by that shameless Blue Dragon.\nA year ago, the Blood Wolf Pack had suffered greatly from this shameless dragon, if not for later plotting and giving that dragon a hard blow, the Blood Wolf Pack would have long been harassed incessantly by this shameless dragon.\nIt’s like while you were hunting and walking, a big fly kept buzzing overhead, occasionally giving you a bite.\nAnd a year later, encountering the annoying tactic once again, the Blood Wolf Leader immediately became furious.\nHowever, the Blood Wolf Leader’s anger did no good, Austin repeated the same tactics, once again hunting a hapless Blood Wolf.\nAt this point, the repeatedly attacked Blood Wolf Pack finally gathered rapidly, leaning on each other to form a dense pack that as soon as Austin descended again, several Blood Wolves would surely leap onto him to bite and fight.\nIn response to this pack formation, Austin was not annoyed, leisurely flying back and forth in the sky.\nA pack of wolves, once gathered, was no longer something a lone wolf could compare to.\nThis formation, even Austin dared not to recklessly dive down.\nDon’t think because these beasts can’t fly that they pose no threat to Austin, in fact, the Blood Wolves’ jumping power was quite astonishing, and with mutual assistance they could use a fellow pack member as a stepping stone to perform a double jump.\nA year ago, it was only due to carelessness that he was almost trapped by these Blood Wolves.\n\"No rush, after all, these Blood Wolves have no long-range attack methods, eventually there will be a flaw.\"\nAustin was leisurely flying above, while the Blood Wolf Leader roared furiously below, yet to no avail.\nAfter half an hour, the Blue Young Dragon had been flying in the sky all along, sometimes landing on large trees to rest, without hunting further.\nAfter confronting the Blue Young Dragon for over half an hour to no avail, eventually, the Blood Wolf Leader helplessly led the Blood Wolves back to their lair.\nHowever, just as they moved, revealing a flaw, the Blue Young Dragon in the sky launched another rapid assault, swiftly hunting a wandering Blood Wolf using the speed of a Blood Wolf.\nRepeatedly, Austin hunted a total of nine Blood Wolves, and each time after twisting the head of a Blood Wolf, he would throw the dead body towards the Blood Wolf Leader.\nUnder such provocation, the humiliated Blood Wolf Pack, and even the Blood Wolf Leader, was finally overtaken by rage.\nNine of them,\nA whole nine! Were all killed using such shameless methods by that detestable Blue Dragon!\n\"Roar!!!\"\nAlmost explosive anger roared from the Blood Wolf Leader, announcing a war against the Blue Dragon.\nFrom this moment, they would never rest until one of them perished with this shameless Blue Dragon!\nSeeing the shameless Blue Dragon in the sky escaping fearfully in a direction, the enraged Blood Wolves below, their anger burning away reasoning, pursued relentlessly in the snowy ground.\nToday, that dragon must be turned into a dead dragon!",

      "content": "Chapter 29: Chapter 27: Trap\nThe Blue Young Dragon soared through the sky, a series of shadows trailing across the snow behind it. Although the dragon posed no threat from above, the pack of Blood Wolves pursued relentlessly.\nUnder Austin’s relentless provocation, the Blood Wolf Leader was utterly enraged, chasing him with unyielding determination.\nIn the midst of this fierce chase, it didn’t take long for the Blue Young Dragon to dart ahead to a critical canyon passage. Before them, towering cliffs stood, with steep mountains on either side forming a narrow ascent to the sky.\nThough the Kawa Great Forest is the largest primeval forest in the southern part of the Seta Continent, its landscape within is diverse, with mountains, hills, canyons, cliffs, and basins. The tropical rainforest-like climate allows ancient trees to flourish, making the vast region appear flat.\nSuch canyon terrains are not uncommon within the Kawa Great Forest.\nAustin, without the slightest pause, tilted his body slightly, and with a whoosh, a gust of wind swept him into the canyon.\nThe Blood Wolf pack, engulfed by rage that burned away their reason, charged in without hesitation, rumbling closely behind.\nAustin’s continuous provocations had made them so angry they lost all caution.\nJust as the last Blood Wolf followed the pack into the canyon.\nOn one side of the mountain, a Goblin observing everything below picked up a sharp Stone Knife and smashed it fiercely against a tightly drawn vine. The vine snapped with a crack, and suddenly, a latch at the peak released, causing a massive pile of rocks, ice, and snow to tumble down from atop the mountains on both sides of the canyon.\nIn an instant, it was as if the earth shook and the mountains trembled.\nRumble!!!\nAmidst the deafening roar of thunderous rolling, the entrance of the canyon was immediately sealed and covered by the falling mass of rocks, ice, and snow. The canyon’s entrance was completely blocked at that moment!\nThe colossal vibration instantly snapped the enraged Blood Wolf pack to their senses, causing them to stop in disarray, frantically scurrying like headless flies.\nThe Blood Wolf Leader looked up at the sky, just in time to see the path behind them obstructed by falling ice, rocks, and snow, cutting off their retreat completely.\nThis is bad!\nThough not highly intelligent, the Blood Wolf Leader sensed danger at that moment.\nThat shameless Blue Dragon must be plotting something!\nSure enough,\nAt the narrow canyon’s exit, unbeknownst to them, a group of Beastmen armed with Long Spears had appeared, completely sealing the canyon’s exit.\nA group of Beastmen, moving in unison, holding Long Spears, slowly advanced toward them.\nIt was as if a mighty mountain’s pressure swept over them.\nThe Blood Wolf Leader’s pupils shrank suddenly,\nThe painful lesson from that night’s attack was still vivid in his memory. In the face of such dense spear formations, they had suffered severe injuries!\nThis terrifying formation was their natural nemesis!\nBut now, with their retreat cut off and their advance blocked, and sheer cliffs on both sides, there was no other escape route ― they were completely trapped here!\nThe only way to survive was to face the Beastman Long Spear Array ahead. Only by breaking through this array could they possibly survive!\nThe overwhelming pressure, following the orderly advance of the Beastmen, drove the Blood Wolf pack to involuntarily retreat.\nThat day’s disastrous scene was still fresh in their memory.\nMeanwhile,\nIn the sky above the canyon, the Blue Young Dragon flipped and soared to a protruding rock edge, looking down at the Blood Wolf pack trapped below, driven back by the Beastman line. It grinned viciously.\n\"You filthy beasts, you’re doomed!\"\nTo entirely eradicate this pack of Blood Wolves, Austin had put in a tremendous effort.\nUnlike the previously exterminated Ghost-headed Crocodiles, which had grown accustomed to reigning over reservoir-like lakes and had temperament flaws easy to exploit, the Blood Wolves were cunning hunters.\nAfter the previous ambush failure, the Blood Wolves, who had experienced the army’s might, wouldn’t foolishly repeat the same mistake. As soon as the Beastmen positioned themselves in the open, the Blood Wolves would avoid direct confrontation rather than charge and die.\nGiven the Blood Wolves’ swiftness, if they chose not to engage, the Beastmen could do nothing.\nThus, to maximize the advantage of his clan, Austin aimed to force the Blood Wolves into an impasse where they had no choice but to charge the Beastman Phalanx, thereby potentially eradicating the pack.\n\"Thank goodness I loved reading ’Romance of the Three Kingdoms’ in my past life, or I’d have no way of dealing with these beasts.\"\nReflecting on his near-perfect strategy learned from his previous life, Austin couldn’t help but feel a bit proud.\nThe Blood Wolves’ cunning couldn’t surpass human wisdom.\n\"It’s just a pity the terrain doesn’t allow it. Otherwise, using rocks and snow to cover the back and front and having Beastmen throw stones from the mountain sides would be much safer.\"\nThis canyon wasn’t an ideal narrow-slit structure; the cliff distance from the entrance to the exit grew wider.\nThe entrance could be sealed from above, but the exit couldn’t; it had to be guarded by an ambush of Beastmen.\nThis would inevitably lead to some damage.\n\"Well, there’s no such thing as perfection in this world. Burying these beasts here is already enough!\"\nAustin had considered using his aerial advantage to slowly wipe out the Blood Wolf pack.\nBut this method failed a year ago.\nWhen Blood Wolves gathered in groups, Austin’s dive-bombs were met with densely packed Blood Wolves leaping up to latch onto him, biting fiercely.\nA year ago, Austin nearly died to this pack tactic, proving it ineffective against the Blood Wolves of this world.\nNow, after painstaking efforts, he had lured the Blood Wolf pack into this dead end,\nas long as he could annihilate these beasts completely. Even if the Beastman army suffered damage, the Blue Young Dragon could bear it.\nMoreover, with him keeping an eye on the Blood Wolf Leader from above, coupled with the Beastmen’s extensively trained army, any damage wouldn’t be too severe.\n\"Attack!\"\nThe Blue Young Dragon roared, its massive form descending from the sky, hovering low, stirring up a fierce whirlwind with gusts of air.\nThe Beastman lineup received the command to advance, the sharp Long Spears standing aloft, pressing forward in unison, pushing towards the Blood Wolf pack ahead.",

      "content": "Chapter 30: Chapter 28: Slaughter\nThe beastman ranks steadily closed in, the panicked blood wolf pack continually retreating, yet their path was ultimately blocked off by rocks and snow, rendering escape impossible.\n\"Awoo!\"\nThe Blood Wolf Leader’s eyes flashed a blood-red hue, and it let out a long howl towards the sky, the sound echoing through the heavens.\nThis was its order to the wolves,\nAttack!\nThere was no way back, only forward to carve a bloody path.\nBam bam bam!\nUpon hearing the leader’s command, the wolf pack immediately gathered together, charging fiercely toward the beastman ranks ahead.\nEach blood wolf bared vicious teeth, sweeping forth like a tide, ferociously attacking the beastman array in front.\nFacing the charge of over a hundred wolves, if it were any other beastman tribe in the Kawa Great Forest, they might have fled in panic.\nYet these Austin clan members, rigorously trained and forged in bloody battle, stood firm as steel.\n\"Stab!\"\nAs the blood wolves drew close, a command rang out, and the sharp long spears thrust forth, the leading wolves crashing into a solid wall, blood splattering as eight or nine immediately fell beneath the spears.\nBut this did not scare the blood wolves; the pack kept charging forward, directly attacking the beastman formation.\nIf it were during that night raid days ago, the wolves’ relentless attack would have torn open the beastman ranks, leading them to break apart.\nHowever, Austin had made adjustments to the beastman ranks for today’s battle.\nBecause of the canyon’s width, Austin’s beastman forces were divided into three lines. The front line was a group of ten goblins.\nShort goblins holding spears in one hand, and a half-person-high rattan wooden shield in the other, served as makeshift gun shield soldiers.\nGiven the goblins’ stature, the first line was not intended to do much damage; their spears mainly deterred the blood wolves’ advance, while their shields protected the lower body, blocking wolves outside the formation.\nBehind them were the taller kobolds and lizardmen in the second and third rows, tasked with damaging the wolves.\nThe short goblins ahead did not hinder the spear attacks of the second and third lines.\nThus, the three lines intertwined their attacks, transforming the beastman army into a grinder within the canyon, exterminating the blood wolves.\nBlood wolves kept charging, but hitting the collaborative killing machine, the canyon filled with blood splatter, the wolves unable to even approach the beastmen.\nIn just over ten minutes, more than half the wolf pack was lost.\nAt this point, the Blood Wolf Leader, commanding from behind, began to panic.\n\"Roar!!\"\nThe Blood Wolf Leader let out a raging roar, visible airwaves rising.\nThe massive blood-colored figure dashed ahead, streaking like thunder over its wolf subordinates, heading toward the beastmen’s formation.\nAt the previous raid on Dragon Nest Village, the Blood Wolf Leader almost broke open the ranks with a single strike.\nThis time, it intended to repeat the strategy, leading its followers to completely crush the beastman army!\nYet as it leapt high, blood-tinted phantoms flickering between its claws,\nCrash!\nSuddenly, a shadow fell from above the canyon, steel-like talons tearing through wind and thunder, blasting toward the airborne blood wolf.\nBoom!\nThe Blood Wolf Leader had no time to react, being hit with enormous force, sent flying like a cannonball.\nBang!\nThe Blood Wolf Leader crashed heavily to the ground, rolling several times, its mind blank.\nYet at this moment, Austin seized the advantage, swooping down from above with claws tearing the air, aiming at the wolf leader’s head.\nSeeing their leader in danger, the blood wolves around immediately sprang up, leaping at the descending Blue Young Dragon.\nWith blood wolves ascending, even Austin dared not trap itself in encirclement, forced to beat its wings, lifting itself against the torrent to ascend.\nThe Blood Wolf Leader, crashed to the ground, also regained clarity from dizziness.\nIt shook its head, looked up at Austin flying above, its blood-red eyes full of murderous intent.\nHowever, the Blood Wolf Leader refrained from madness, refocusing on the slaughtering beastman ranks advancing before it, its body trembling, emitting a low roar.\n\"Roar...\"\nTraces of blood-colored mist rose from its wolf body, the blood-hued fur now fluttering, an invisible pressure spreading, the blood wolves backing off to leave space.\nThe Blood Wolf Leader’s entire body seemed ablaze with blood-colored flames, rising with immense momentum, mouth opening, its form growing savage.\n\"Is this... Talent Magic?\"\nThe Blue Young Dragon hovering above suddenly sensed a foreboding.\n\"Watch out!\"\nAustin urgently warned, but at that instant, a sphere of yellow flame appeared from the Blood Wolf Leader’s mouth, spewing forth like a cannonball.\nBeastmen barely reacted as the basketball-sized fireball streaked across the sky, striking the beastman ranks.\nBoom!!!\nUpon hitting the ranks, the fireball erupted, igniting a three-meter-long flame, raising immense heat waves.\nAlthough the fireball hit the goblins’ wooden shields, its powerful shockwave and scorching flames blasted open a gap in the beastman ranks, nearby goblins fell, life uncertain, surrounding beastmen severely burned.\n\"Awoo!!!\"\nSuccessful from the strike, the blood wolves grew frenzied, charging the beastman ranks anew.\nSimultaneously,\nThe Blood Wolf Leader opened its mouth again, blood mist rising from its body, threads of energy gathering in the air.\n\"Damn!\"\nAustin, poised to attack, saw ordinary blood wolves eyeing it as imminent threat, ready to leap should the Blue Young Dragon drop to a reachable height.\nAny descent could mean those wolves pouncing without fear, tangling Austin persistently.\n\"Blast it!\"\nAustin fiercely outraged, as it prepared to descend and fight, eyeing the focused, unmoving blood wolf leader conjuring its Talent Magic, an idea suddenly sparked in the Blue Young Dragon’s mind.",

      "content": "Chapter 31: Chapter 29 Annihilation\nIf it were just a normal wolf pack, Austin alone would be enough to massacre hundreds of wolves, without the slightest worry that ordinary wolves in a chaotic battle could harm him. Although he was only a two-year-old super young dragon, dragons are still dragons, and scale armor defense is not something ordinary beasts can damage.\nBut this pack of blood wolves is not an ordinary wolf pack. Within these blood wolves flows the extraordinary aura of magic beasts, capable of piercing Austin’s scales, which have yet to fully develop.\nTo be classified as a magic beast already makes them vastly different from ordinary beasts.\nEven though Austin could ignore one or two blood wolves, if an entire pack pounced, even the blue young dragon would have no choice but to flee. Otherwise, if he got entangled by four or five blood wolves and was then attacked by their leader, whose power rivals that of a Tier Three magic beast, escape would be impossible.\nIt is precisely because of his apprehension towards the elite guards surrounding the blood wolf leader that Austin dared not descend from the sky easily.\nBut at this moment, when Austin saw the blood wolf leader close its eyes to gather a talent magic, he suddenly remembered that he was no longer the young dragon from a year ago without long-range attack capabilities.\nBack then, the blue young dragon had only awakened the first talent magic called Electric Shock Paralysis, forcing him into close combat.\nBut now, he had awakened a second talent magic.\n\"The Thunder Strike Technique causes a lot of commotion before it’s ready, making it likely for this cunning beast to dodge. But now, perhaps I could...\"\nAustin had previously considered whether he could directly use his newly awakened second talent magic to seriously injure the blood wolf leader. However, considering the blood wolf leader’s cunning nature, directly using that talent magic might result in it dodging and leaving Austin’s efforts in vain. Moreover, even at his peak, he could only use the Thunder Strike Technique once or twice, so he initially had no intention of using that magic.\nYet now, circumstances had changed, and perhaps he could use this opportunity to launch a surprise attack.\nWith this thought, the blue young dragon immediately soared into the air, using the wind to glide into the rocky walls on either side. His iron-like dragon claws tore through the rock layers on the sides as if they were made of tofu, causing large chunks of rock to fall from the sky, crashing onto the blood wolf pack.\nThe blood wolf leader was alarmed by this commotion, looking up at the sky in frustration as the sand and stones poured down like a waterfall, though it did not cause any harm, it disrupted its process of gathering talent magic.\n\"Roar!\"\nThe blood wolf leader let out a low growl but was not further provoked by the blue young dragon, standing still in place to once again gather its talent magic, ignoring the changes above.\nSeeing the blood wolf leader beneath ignoring the changes above and refocusing its magic power, Austin’s mouth curled into a grim smile.\nWhat the blood wolf leader hadn’t noticed was that under the cover of the dust from the falling rocks, the magic power within the blue young dragon’s body began to circulate. At some point, the moisture in the air began to rise, and amidst the large rocks falling, an occasional electrical spark flashed in the air. The atmosphere began to ionize with the circulation of magic power, silently gathering terrifying power.\nAt that moment, the blood wolf leader remained unmoving, threads of magic power extended from its body, accumulating in front of it into a mass of flame emitting intense heat, continuously growing larger, as though even the air was burning and warping.\nAs a result of the blood wolf leader’s Fireball Talent Technique, an opening had been created in the beastman ranks, and under the assault of the blood wolf pack, they were already on the verge of collapse, barely maintaining their stand.\nIf the blood wolf leader’s talent magic were to strike the already crumbling beastman formation again, the next moment their ranks would be breached entirely, drowning in the blood wolves!\nJust as the flames gathered before the blood wolf leader, the forming flame ball was about to be launched,\nBOOM!!!\nA thunderclap suddenly resounded throughout the canyon in what seemed like a clear sky, an enormous peal of thunder echoing mightily.\nThe blood wolf leader immediately sensed an imminent threat of disaster enveloping it, as if it were about to face the abyss of death, causing its fur to stand on end.\nHowever, before it could react, a thick bolt of lightning suddenly descended from the sky, tearing the air and striking its body instantly.\nZZZAP!!!\nThe thunderbolt hit the blood wolf leader squarely, electric arcs scattering in every direction, and the surrounding blood wolf elite were struck by the lightning, turning into charred remains.\nStruck directly by the thunderbolt, the blood wolf leader was overwhelmed by a terrifying electric current, its entire body engulfed in flames, and the fireball it had been about to launch lost control and exploded violently.\nBOOM!!!\nWith a loud explosion, flames surged eight or nine meters high, the terrible shockwave sweeping out like a torrent, the ground shattered into web-like cracks, and fragments of stone scattered like bullets in all directions, affecting over a dozen nearby blood wolves. They were swept away by the shockwave, their fates unknown.\n\"Good!\"\nHigh above, the blue young dragon’s eyes gleamed brilliantly as his Thunder Strike Technique struck home, not only severely wounding the blood wolf leader in an instant but also causing its talent magic to explode uncontrollably, killing it, while gravely injuring nearly one-third of the remaining blood wolf pack.\n\"Kill!\"\nSeeing the blood wolf leader struck down and the blood wolf pack reeling from the explosion, the previously faltering beastman army was galvanized, like caged tigers unleashed, crushing towards the panicked blood wolf pack.\nSimultaneously, having lost the blood wolf leader’s intimidation and with his strength nearly exhausted, Austin also descended from the sky, joining the fray to annihilate the remaining blood wolves.\nWithout their leader, and pushed to the edge of desperation, the remaining blood wolves went berserk, frenziedly attacking Austin and the beastman army.\nYet the combined strength of the two forces was beyond what they could challenge.\nSoon, the entire blood wolf pack was completely wiped out, without a single one left alive.\n\"What a pity. If they were intelligent beings capable of communication, there might have been a chance to subdue them. But since they’re just beasts, it’s not worth it.\"\nWithin the canyon, with wolf corpses scattered everywhere, the beastmen began to clear the battlefield. Austin stood in the center, licking the blood off his claws, gazing at the bloody scene before him with a slight sigh.\nUntil the very last moment, these blood wolves were fiercely attacking and biting, rendering any attempt at communication or subjugation impossible, forcing him to slaughter them all.\n\"There should be wolf pups in the wolf’s nest, so perhaps raising these magic beasts isn’t just a daydream.\"\nAn idea flashed in Austin’s mind, already deciding to explore the wolf’s nest.\nHowever,\nwhat matters most now is that....\nAustin shifted his gaze back to a charred corpse significantly larger than the other blood wolves, a thirstful look glimmered in his eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 32: Chapter 30 Harvest\nCrash!\nThe Blue Young Dragon flapped its membrane wings, soaring upwards with the airflow, gracefully crossing more than ten meters to land beside the corpse of the Blood Wolf Leader.\nDuring the growth of a young dragon, a large amount of magic crystals, magic ores, and other magic power materials are needed. It is through the absorption and digestion of these vast magic resources that adult dragons can stand at the pinnacle of this world.\nFor other young dragons in their early years, the resources needed for growth are naturally provided by their parents. Unfortunately, Austin is an orphan dragon, and everything depends on himself.\nAt first, Austin chose to build a nest and camp nearby, largely because the area was resource-poor with few fierce hunters roaming about, making it more suitable for his own growth.\nThis advantage allowed the Blue Young Dragon to barely survive until it was two years old, but naturally, a place of poverty had its drawbacks, which was the scarcity of magic power resources.\nOver two years, apart from some magic potions occasionally found and the magic beast crystal core swallowed after the last hunt of the Ghost-headed Crocodile, and the body of the Ghost-headed Crocodile Leader, Austin hadn’t acquired any other magic power resources.\nThe more magic resources are absorbed and digested, the stronger the power of the Dragon Race.\nThis Blood Wolf Leader before him, at least a top-tier two, had battle power nearly reaching tier three, and the magic power it contained was certainly not inferior to that of the Ghost-headed Crocodile Leader, and it might even form a magic beast crystal core.\nThe Blue Young Dragon opened its fierce maw and tore apart the head of the Blood Wolf Leader.\nSure enough, within the skull, a crystal core emitting a faint red glow hovered silently.\nA magic beast crystal core, a true magic beast crystal core, unlike the prototype inside the Ghost-headed Crocodile Leader back then!\nWithout any hesitation, Austin swallowed it in one bite,\nThe digestion ability of the Dragon Race was sufficient to let the Blue Young Dragon completely digest this vast source of magic power.\nWith one gulp the magic beast crystal core was swallowed down, simultaneously Austin took a look at the Blood Wolf Leader’s corpse before him, and in a few bites, he ate it and swallowed it into his belly.\nGulp!\nThe meat, containing strong magic power, entered his belly and was digested by the powerful digestion ability, while the previously swallowed crystal core of the Blood Wolf Leader also dissolved and melted in the stomach, surging waves of immense magic power running through his blood vessels, fusing into his muscles.\nIn that instant, Austin felt as if magma was flowing through his veins, the scorching pain like a tsunami drowning his mind.\nAt the same time, waves of aura rose from his body, the surrounding air ionized to various extents, arcs of electricity and fire crackled and jumped in the air, a hurricane swept in all directions.\nAfter a while, all the anomalies dissipated.\nAustin looked at himself, feeling as if his entire body had grown by over ten centimeters at this moment, his scale armor becoming more profound, with tiny electric currents flickering through the gaps between the scales, reflecting the sunlight around him.\n\"The magic power within my body has increased by at least twenty percent!\"\nFeeling the overwhelming power within his body, Austin murmured to himself.\nIf previously he could use the Thunder Strike Technique only once or twice in a battle, now he would be able to use it at least two to three times, and he would be able to wield the two talent magics more skillfully, with their power also seeing some enhancement.\nNot only that, the Blue Young Dragon clearly felt that the scale armor on his body’s surface had become more solid, his overall strength had increased by at least thirty percent or more!\nAnd this was just part of it.\nThe magic core within his body and the blood wolf leader’s bones and blood hadn’t been completely digested, the magic beast crystal core had only melted about half, with a lot of meat remaining, needing further digestion.\nWhen Austin fully devours and digests the Blood Wolf Leader, his overall strength could be improved by at least fifty percent.\nAlthough no third talent magic had awakened, this improvement in strength was already quite impressive.\n\"Indeed, only by devouring materials containing magic power can a dragon grow the quickest before reaching adulthood!\"\nOf course, if too much is devoured, the young dragon would need to sleep to digest the magical food, thus reducing the efficiency of digestion and growth.\nAustin shook his head, dispelling the many distractions in his mind.\nWhat’s important now is handling the aftermath properly.\n\"Vini, how are the casualties?\"\nThe Blue Young Dragon turned his head to ask the Kobold leader Vini, who was commanding the Beastmen to clean the battlefield beside him.\n\"Your Highness Austin, except for one Goblin who was burned to death by the Blood Wolf Leader’s talent magic directly, there are six severely injured, eleven lightly injured, and the rest are basically fine.\"\nUpon hearing Austin’s inquiry, Vini quickly and respectfully replied.\nAfter devouring the Blood Wolf Leader, Vini instinctively sensed that the Blue Young Dragon before him exerted a more tremendous pressure, even feeling a slight trace of draconic majesty from that aura.\n\"Very well, you all did a good job, the casualties were beyond my expectations.\"\nAustin nodded, accepting the casualty rate, as the Blood Wolf pack was no simple group of wolves.\n\"Clean up the battlefield and prepare to return, don’t forget to bring back the Goblin who died in battle, for they died for us. Build a grave next to the Dragon Nest Village, always remember these warriors who spilled blood and sacrificed their lives for us.\"\nFollowing Austin’s command, the Beastmen quickly swept through the canyon.\nEach Beastman had their duties, soon completing the cleanup of the canyon battlefield. The team achieved a great victory and mighty triumph as they proceeded back towards Dragon Nest Village.\nThose hundreds of wolf corpses lying on the ground were piled onto Vine Shields, bound with vines to make a makeshift sled and pulled back to Dragon Nest Village, similar treatment was given to the heavily injured, sitting on Vine Shields pulled back to the village by uninjured Beastmen.\nLuckily, from the ambush to returning to the village, they didn’t have the misfortune of encountering any fierce hunters, although some famished hyenas were drawn by the smell of blood upon return to the village, upon seeing the Blue Young Dragon soaring down from the sky, they scrambled away chaotically.\nThe Beastman army returned safely to Dragon Nest Village unharmed.\nUpon return to the lair, Austin picked several keen-scented Kobolds to track the Blood Wolf pack’s trails and locate their den.\nUnexpectedly, within the Blood Wolf’s den, the Blue Young Dragon discovered a tree that remained lush in the heavy snow, and found a few blood-red fruits on its branches, fruits containing magic!\nPerhaps the formation of the Blood Wolf pack was related to the lush tree amid the cold winter, Austin then planned to move this tree to his own nest for protection after the cold winter passed.\nAside from the magic-containing tree, Austin also found a skin-and-bones mother Blood Wolf and over a dozen hungry, howling young wolves in the den.\nMaybe it was because Austin had become stronger, awakened a trace of draconic majesty, or perhaps with the Blood Wolf pack absent, the mother wolf growled aggressively yet with fear at the arrival of the Blue Young Dragon.\nBut as Austin approached, the mother Blood Wolf finally let out a strange cry, lying on the ground in surrender.\nThus, the Blue Young Dragon naturally took the mother and young wolves back to Dragon Nest Village for breeding, and come next summer, these fierce hunters would certainly add more power under Austin’s command.\n```",

      "content": "Chapter 33: Chapter 31: Situation\nThe blood wolves, the most cunning and cruel hunters, in the extreme hunger of the cold winter, would even tear apart and kill the old and weak of the tribe as food.\nAmong the blood wolves, there is only a sense of pack mentality and no family concept, so Austin is confident in taming these young wolves.\nOnce these young blood wolves grow up, they will not only help the beastmen clear various ferocious beasts near their territory, but when the blood wolf tribe multiplies enough to be strong, they can select some robust beastmen to train as wolf cavalry.\nWith bows and arrows as weapons and the powerful mobility of the wolf pack, the combination of the two forms this advanced unit, which is undoubtedly a deadly weapon in this jungle.\nIn such jungle warfare, it almost proves to be invincible.\nHowever, realizing such a wolf cavalry army is still some distance away in the future.\nAfter feeding some food to the emaciated mother wolf and the ten or so hungry young wolves, the young wolves became less resistant to Austin and the kobolds.\nThus, under the guidance of the Blue Young Dragon, the mother wolf and the young wolves were brought back to Dragon Nest Village.\nThis cold winter season, with a great victory over the blood wolf pack and the fish caught in the lake reservoirs, there was no shortage of food in the Dragon Nest Village, and they could bear the cost of feeding these creatures.\nBefore leaving, the beastmen searched the entire Blood Wolf Lair.\nUnfortunately, apart from some white bones, the whole lair contained nothing of value. However, Austin did find quite a few fruit pits on the ground, which were the seeds of the fruit from the nearby magic tree.\nThese fruit pits seemed worthless and did not contain any magic power, but Austin still instructed the beastmen to collect them.\nOnce the cold winter season passes, and it is time to clear and plant in the Dragon Nest Territory, these fruit pits could be planted; perhaps in the future, more magic trees might grow, yielding more magic-infused red fruits, constituting a substantial magic resource.\nAs for the tree beside the blood wolf lair, Austin intends to leave it in its place and see if it can be transplanted next to the Dragon Nest Territory after next year’s hot summer.\nAfter cleaning the Blood Wolf Lair thoroughly, Austin and the beastmen returned to the Dragon Nest Tribe with their harvests to begin a phase of recuperation and rest.\nThe battle had thoroughly exterminated the blood wolf pack wandering around the Dragon Nest Territory, and henceforth, there was almost nothing in the entire territory that could threaten the Dragon Nest.\nHowever, after that bloody battle, the Beastman Tribe also suffered significant losses. Although only one goblin died on the spot due to being directly hit by the Blood Wolf Leader’s talent magic, many other beastmen were severely injured.\nPlus, after the beastman formation was blown open by the pack of blood wolves in a frenzy, many beastmen were injured, and the strength of the Dragon Nest Village dropped to its lowest point.\nFortunately, the battle exterminated over a hundred wolf packs, not only solving the immediate food problem for Dragon Nest Village; the wolf pelts provided also made life warmer for the beastmen in the village during the cold winter, so there were no major issues.\nThe time has reached a little more than the second month of the cold winter season, as the end of the cold winter approaches, hungry fierce beasts have begun to appear frequently wandering near the Dragon Nest Territory, attacking the village, just without any magic beasts attacking.\nMoreover, ever since the night raid by the blood wolf pack on Dragon Nest Village, they had built a simple fence around the village, with beastmen guarding it every night, so the few attacks by fierce beasts were detected early by beastmen, with no damage inflicted.\nNonetheless, Austin instructed the beastmen to reduce their time spent outside, mostly staying within the Dragon Nest Territory to prepare for the plans post-cold winter next year.\n\"Simply surviving by hunting and gathering cannot sustain or support a large population.\"\nFrom the evolutionary history of human civilization in past lives, it is known that for a clan’s power to grow and prosper, it must eventually settle down and develop agriculture to sustain a larger population and develop a more substantial civilized power.\nHowever, in this world, particularly in the Kawa Great Forest, perhaps due to various reasons or the presence of extraordinary power, the many beastman tribes living in the Kawa Great Forest have not transitioned to an agricultural settled development and remain in the hunting-gathering civilization stage.\nEven those tribes active at the edge of the Kawa Great Forest, bordering human territory, do not have the concept of agriculture and animal husbandry. From the mouth of the fox-faced Quik, it was known that those great tribes, due to population issues, could not gather enough food from the forest. Thus, when cold winters come, great hordes of beastman tribes spill out of the Kawa Forest like a flood into human civilization’s frontier to plunder.\nOver a thousand years of mutual slaughter and skirmish have stained every corner with blood, making the frontier region where the Kawa Great Forest meets the Civilized Continent renownedly feared by humans, called the Bloody Defense Line.\nDuring the thousand-year war, humans gradually built a giant Great Wall, spanning thousands of miles across the Bloody Defense Line, to block the southern beastmen from the Kawa Great Forest.\nAccording to the fox-faced Quik, with the successful construction of the Bloody Great Wall and the formidable Iron-blooded Duke guarding the border, in recent years, the large beastman tribes at the Kawa Great Forest border have rarely been able to breach the Bloody Defense Line to enter the human realm, and their situation hasn’t been good.\nMoreover, due to poor conditions in recent years, the major beastman forces north of the Dragon Nest Tribe have had continuous conflicts, even going to war several times.\nHowever, none of this currently concerns Austin, and he did not ask the fox-faced Quik how he knew about these matters.\nThose major beastman forces have tribes numbering over a hundred thousand, and even golden or legendary realm powerhouses exist within, not something Austin, with his small group, can provoke at this time.\nIn these last days of the cold winter season, although Austin has reduced the beastmen’s excursions to avoid attacks from hungry beasts,\nit does not mean that the beastmen idly stayed in the Dragon Nest Village. In addition to daily training and catching fish, the beastmen had gained another task.\nThat was to create tools like hoes and wooden shovels, in preparation for next year’s farming season.\nAt the same time, they must preemptively fell down some trees in nearby wooded areas, so that after the cold winter, the dried fallen trees can be set alight, creating clearing land ready for the cultivation of various wild grains.",

      "content": "Chapter 34: Chapter 32: Reclaiming Wilderness\nAdhering to the principle of not spoiling the nest, the Blue Young Dragon did not allow these beastmen to randomly cut down trees near Dragon Nest Village, only cleaning up the area surrounding the village a little.\nSmall changes were beneficial for improving the living environment of the beastmen, while not causing the natural barrier to be overly cleared; having some trees surrounding as protection was still very effective.\nAs for lands to cultivate and farm, they found a flat area not far from Dragon Nest Village and near a water source. Austin marked out an area of about twenty acres, intending to start cultivation there in the coming year.\nUnder Austin’s command, the beastmen arduously chopped down the ancient trees one by one. Fortunately, when the Lizardman leader Rodney attacked Dragon Nest Village, the Blue Young Dragon confiscated an iron axe from him, greatly speeding up the tree-felling process.\nOtherwise, without iron tools, even if it was just ten acres of land, these beastmen using stone and bone tools would probably take a month to clear it.\nIn the icy snow,\nA small piece of land had already been cleared, with several strong beastmen hanging ropes made of vines on the tree tops, and the massive ancient tree trunks had been mostly axed down. Following the kobold Vini’s command, the beastmen quickly grabbed the ends of the ropes.\n\"One, two, three... pull!\"\nWith the rhythmic command, the beastmen quickly seized the rope ends and pulled forcefully.\nGroaning!\nThe tree, already half-chopped, broke with a miserable sound under the powerful traction, collapsing with a crash as the beastmen at both ends quickly scattered.\n\"Alright, take a break, we’ll continue later.\"\nVini wiped the sweat off his forehead, seeing the beastmen were exhausted, suggesting a short rest.\nAlthough it was cold winter with ice and snow, the heavy exercise had left every beastman sweating profusely and panting heavily.\nThe Kawa Great Forest had been formed for countless years, and these trees were at least as thick as one could embrace. Although they had an iron axe, chopping down a tree still required enormous strength.\nFortunately, after these trees were felled, they could be left alone. As the Blue Young Dragon said, after the cold winter, these trees on the ground would dry out and could simply be burned down.\nHowever, the remaining tree roots were problematic. After the trunks were chopped, the stumps remained firmly rooted in the soil.\nAccording to the Blue Young Dragon’s plan, after farming and cultivation in this area, wild rice and other crops would be planted. The soil needed leveling, and during this process, the roots would be a hindrance.\nThere was no way around it, they could only avoid them, allowing them to slowly rot in the ground over the years.\n\"Farming, is it really feasible...\"\nLooking at the resting beastmen scattered around, Vini suddenly had this thought.\nFarming was said to be the exclusive knowledge of humans on the northern Civilized Continent, and throughout history, no one had seen beastmen who could farm.\nBeastmen usually obtained food through hunting, gathering, or plundering from other tribes; tribes relying on farming for survival and development were almost nonexistent.\nThis was related to the beastmen’s way of life and environmental conditions. Additionally, the beastmen’s coarse mindset couldn’t comprehend the humans’ intricate farming knowledge, resulting in beastmen not developing agriculture.\nAlthough Vini was puzzled by the Blue Young Dragon’s plan, he continued to execute it unwaveringly.\nThe events of recent days—slaying the ghost-headed crocodile, ice-fishing, hunting blood wolf packs—had made the beastmen blindly believe in the Blue Young Dragon.\nEven if Austin’s decisions were wrong, they would follow through without a doubt.\n\"Once rested, we’ll continue working. After finishing this tree, we’ll have a meal!\"\nAfter resting on the ground for a while, Vini called out loudly, finding another snow-laden tree and beginning a new round of work.\nMeanwhile, as the beastmen were enthusiastically working,\nAustin stood on a hill not far away, looking down at the beastmen diligently clearing the trees in the flatland.\n\"It’s been two days, and only this much has been cleared. It seems metallurgy must be developed quickly.\"\nCurrently, the beastmen’s tools consisted only of the war axe seized from the Lizardman leader Rodney and some stone, wood, and bone tools, severely affecting work efficiency.\nThough, with the Blue Young Dragon’s power, joining the clearing work would increase the speed several times over.\nNot to mention the power within, even a Thunder Strike Technique could char a huge tree.\nBut who was he?\nHe was the lord of these beastmen, their superior.\nIn this world, there was no such thing as a lord doing the work personally.\nHe was the boss, not a nanny.\nMoreover, farming and clearing were vital for the beastmen’s future food source, but dispensable for the Blue Young Dragon.\nThe clan’s development required its efforts and struggles to overcome difficulties and ultimately achieve results rather than Austin assisting and growing them prematurely.\nEven if the target of clearing twenty acres this cold winter couldn’t be achieved, Austin wouldn’t personally help.\nThough the Blue Young Dragon could easily solve the current development difficulties, the clan would someday reach a point where Austin couldn’t intervene. Cultivating the beastmen’s independent challenge-facing ability was better than relying on his strength and always living under his protection.\nBlue Young Dragon’s goal in developing the clan was for someday when the clan could protect him and gather various Magic Power materials necessary for his growth, not to keep them under his protection permanently.\nHe didn’t have the heart of a benevolent saint for the masses.\n\"I remember the refining technique, but the ore is a problem.\"\nEven though Austin remembered the steps to refine copper and iron by hand from his past life watching wilderness survival experts, lacking ore was like cooking without rice.\nThe only clue was that a mountain range near the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, about ten miles away, had abundant copper ore.\nHowever, from the beastman prisoners’ accounts, that Jackal Wolfman Tribe had over a hundred people, almost two hundred, with an extraordinary leader, which couldn’t be easily swallowed by Austin’s clan.\n\"Population, how should the population be increased?\"\nWhile the Blue Young Dragon pondered, he suddenly noticed the Fox-faced Man Quik leading a few kobolds on patrol nearby, preventing the disturbance from attracting hungry wild beasts.\nAustin had a sudden thought; perhaps the Fox-faced Man Quik knew how to quickly increase the tribe’s population.",

      "content": "Chapter 35: Chapter 33: Methods of Recruiting Population\nNot long ago, when the orc captives were fully integrated into the Dragon Nest Village system, the Blue Young Dragon also put on a political show, meeting and talking with each newly joined orc.\nHe also learned that Quik, the fox-faced man, served as a key advisor in the Lizardman Tribe, and during their conversation, he inadvertently learned from Quik about the current situation at the border of the Bloody Defense Line at the edge of the northern Kawa Great Forest.\nAt that time, Austin felt that Quik must have some background, but since the fox-faced man didn’t say anything, the Blue Young Dragon couldn’t be bothered to ask.\nNow seeing Quik, Austin suddenly remembered that Rodney’s small gathering tribe seemed to be the one he was responsible for recruiting, and surely he knows how to gather population, a point he had inadvertently overlooked.\nThinking of this, Austin spread his wings and soared into a torrent of air, flying towards the direction of the fox-faced Quik.\nThe noise from the orcs clearing land and cutting trees was not small, and it could potentially attract those hungry beasts, hence Quik and his men patrolled the area to prevent sudden attacks by vicious beasts that could result in casualties.\nQuik was leading three or so kobolds in a patrol nearby when suddenly a chill wind swept over them. Thinking it was a beast attack, he panicked, only to see a massive shadow descending from the sky.\nIt was indeed the lord of the Dragon Nest Village, the Blue Dragon Austin.\n\"Greetings, Your Highness Austin.\"\nSeveral orcs bowed in salute, clearly showing genuine respect, and Quik did the same.\nFor those simple-minded orcs like kobolds, goblins, and lizardmen, joining the Dragon Nest Village meant not only having enough to eat but occasionally enjoying a hearty meal, making their lives increasingly better. With the success in two skirmishes, the Blue Young Dragon’s status in the hearts of many orcs rose higher and higher.\nThough they couldn’t articulate it well, they held immense respect, admiration, and support for the Blue Young Dragon.\nQuik, however, saw something deeper. This Blue Young Dragon was very different from other tribal leaders. From this humble Dragon Nest Village, he saw immense development potential.\nIt was precisely for this reason that Quik, the fox-faced man, had previously revealed some capabilities, hoping to catch Austin’s attention.\nAnd now, he seems to have succeeded.\n\"You guys go on patrol first, Quik stays behind. I have something to discuss with him.\"\nThe Blue Young Dragon landed, retracted his wings, and spoke from above in a low voice.\n\"Yes!\"\nSeveral kobolds respectfully agreed and then left.\nGlancing at the respectfully standing Quik, Austin went straight to the point:\n\"Quik, I’ve heard that when Rodney established his tribe, you helped organize and plan. Now I want to increase the population of Dragon Nest Village, what do you suggest we should do?\"\nIn fact, Austin instinctively sensed that Quik, the fox-faced man, had some thoughts; he wasn’t as simple as other orcs and seemed to be more cunning.\nSure enough, in just a short time, he had already mingled here and climbed to the position of a squad leader.\nBut that’s okay. As long as he is loyal to Dragon Nest Village and doesn’t betray it, it doesn’t matter.\nHowever, the inherent nature of orcs of different races is different. Now, with few people, it’s not noticeable, but in the future, when the clan’s numbers grow and the orc types become complex, it would be best to manage them separately by division of labor.\nThis thought suddenly flashed in Austin’s mind.\nBut there’s no rush for now. For now, the unified management and unified work during military training is still fine and doesn’t need reform.\n\"Your Highness, the best way to increase the population is to annex other orc tribes.\"\nQuik pondered for a moment, then replied.\n\"Previously, I went out to explore, and besides the Jackal Wolfman Tribe that defeated you, I haven’t found any other gathering places. So, do you have any leads on other nearby tribes?\"\nSince Quik answered this way, Austin felt he must have a plan in mind.\nSure enough, Quik replied:\n\"Yes, as far as I know, there should be more than a dozen tribes within a hundred miles of this Dragon Nest Territory. If we can annex and absorb them all, forming a large tribe of a thousand people is not a problem.\"\nIn a desolate place like the Kawa Great Forest, with mountains to the east and west, small tribes often gather, but typically, a tribe only consists of twenty or thirty people banding together for warmth, posing little threat to the Dragon Nest Village with the Blue Young Dragon in charge.\n\"How far is the nearest tribe? Is it far?\"\nAustin was noncommittal. Regardless of the tribe’s power, if annexation is the goal, the journey should also be taken into consideration.\n\"Well... I remember there are two or three goblin and kobold tribes nearby, with about ten to twenty people, but when I encountered them, it was already a year ago. I don’t know if they’ve migrated or perished from starvation and disbanded since then. Apart from those I remember, the jackal village seems to be the closest to us...\"\n\"Very well, Quik. I’m giving you a task to contact those goblin and kobold tribes you mentioned and see if they can be incorporated. As for that kobold village, we’ll discuss it later.\"\nIf they cannot be incorporated voluntarily, then naturally, they’ll be defeated and taken captive.\nOf course, whether they voluntarily submit or are conquered, military training is an essential threshold.\n\"Apart from this, are there any other methods?\"\nNot long after the start of the cold winter, Austin once flew out to search for nearby orc tribes, but ultimately found nothing except the unexpected discovery of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nAlthough due to the early start of the cold winter, orc tribes mostly stayed in their nests rarely coming out, making it hard to find traces, Austin didn’t have much hope in the few tribes Quik mentioned.\nIn a year’s time, such small tribes of ten to twenty people probably already perished.\n\"Another method would be to send up smoke signals to gather people. However, the orcs who come will mostly be the old, weak, sick, and wounded, and it’s rare to find strong orcs.\"\n\"Smoke signals? What’s that?\"\nAustin was taken aback, clearly having no recollection of such a method.\nAnd it was only after careful inquiry that Austin understood that these smoke signals were a way unique to the Kawa Great Forest to gather wandering stray orcs.\nThe so-called smoke signals involve burning some wet firewood at a high place to produce tall pillars of smoke, visible from afar, similar to beacon lighthouses.\nAnd when the wandering stray orcs in the forest see the pillars of smoke, they know there are people there. Those desperate or starving orcs would make their way towards the smoke, hoping to try their luck and see if the tribe there would accept them.",

As the clans grow and multiply, if the population exceeds what the tribe can bear, part of the tribe’s people will automatically split off to wander and make a living elsewhere.\nThese Beastmen, whether old, weak, sick, disabled, or strong teams, form numerous wandering individuals among the Kawa Great Forest.\nTypically, these wanderers struggle arduously outside for a period before disappearing into a corner of the forest—either becoming fodder for wild beasts, starving beside a waterhole, or eating poisonous fruits and collapsing next to trees to become fertilizer.\nOnly a few lucky individuals manage to find suitable land to settle down and begin to survive and reproduce, or are accepted by other Beastman Tribes to become one of them.\nA towering smoke fire attracts these wandering Beastmen across the forest as a beacon coordinate.\nThe natural smoke and the smoke made by intelligent humanoids are significantly different; distant Beastmen seeing smoke columns naturally know there’s Beastman activity there.\nIt’s said that initially, wandering Beastmen, dressed in rags and famished with cold and hunger, would automatically walk towards the direction of rising smoke because it represented the location of a Beastman Tribe where they might find vitality, if lucky.\nLater, it evolved such that when large tribes had enough food but lacked population, they would burn a big smoking fire at their gateway to let distant wandering Beastmen see it and come to take refuge.\nAfter many years of evolution, this unique method of recruiting population gradually formed within the Kawa Great Forest.\n\"Using this method, however, creates too much commotion and easily attracts hostile tribal forces, thus inviting danger.\"\nAt this point, Quik discreetly glanced at Austin but said no more.\nClearly, if this method is used to attract people, then the Dragon Nest Village will easily be noticed by the nearby Jackal Wolfman Tribe, thus inviting danger.\n\"You don’t need to worry about the Jackal Wolfman Tribe; just proceed with action.\"\nRegarding the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, even if the Jackal Wolf Leader is a Bronze Level Extraordinary Professional, Austin is fairly confident of wiping them out with enough sacrifice.\nHaving devoured the Blood Wolf Leader, his strength now far surpasses its previous level.\nIf those Jackal Wolfman Villages lack sharp Iron Weapons, they probably can’t even breach his defenses, with only the Jackal Wolfman Leader posing some degree of threat to him.\nGiven this power comparison, if the Jackal Wolfmen dare to attack, Austin’s strength combined with his subordinates are enough to swallow this bunch.\n\"If they indeed come looking for trouble, considering they must be swallowed eventually, might as well make the first move earlier.\"\nWith his enhanced powers, Austin no longer fears the Jackal Wolfman Tribe as he once did.\nAnd if he can recruit enough people within this period, even if the Jackal Wolfman Tribe doesn’t attack, he plans to lead his team to merge and attack them.\n\"Yes, Your Highness Austin.\"\nFor the decision of Lord Blue Young Dragon, Fox-faced Man Quik naturally complies without objection.\nThus, on the same day, with the Beastmen’s united effort, they chopped surrounding trees at a nearby high hill and made a smoke tower similar to a blast furnace using mud.\nThe idea of the smoke tower was proposed by Austin. Initially, Quik planned to burn dry wood inside and pile damp hay leaves and branches on top to create thick smoke, but Austin felt this was inefficient, and he intended to start refining copper using a blast furnace soon, hence he had them make such a blast furnace.\nThe blast furnace’s purpose is not only to burn wet wood to create thick smoke but also to produce qualified charcoal.\nMoreover, Blue Young Dragon recalled how, in ancient times in his past life, armies communicated using wolf smoke signals, so he ordered some wolf dung from the abandoned Blood Wolf Lair to be placed into the smoke furnace during ignition to increase the smoke, making the smoke column visible from afar.\nAfter several days of bustling activity, the first fire was finally ignited in the blast furnace,\nThe wind was not strong that day, thus a massive smoke column rose into the air, visible even from more than ten miles away in the forest as a spectacular smoke pillar.\n\"Hope everything goes smoothly,\"\nGazing at the just-built blast furnace standing two to three meters high, Austin said inwardly.\nWith everything ready, sending someone to wait assuredly was all that was needed.\nDuring this period, numerous tribes might have already entered a food shortage, likely forcing many Beastmen to leave their tribes in hunger to find something edible in the icy and snowy wilderness.\nIf no fortunate encounters occur, those expelled Beastmen will either freeze or starve, with only one in ten surviving the cold winter.\nAnd this smoke column serves as a beacon of hope for those famished and cold wandering Beastmen, attracting Beastmen with no worry they won’t come; however, the quality of Beastman recruits might not be high, likely consisting of skin-and-bones elders, weak, sick and disabled, and if too many come, Dragon Nest Tribe’s food might also face certain problems.\nRegarding this method of recruitment, Fox-faced Man Quik wasn’t particularly in favor, but since it was Lord Austin’s decision, he would naturally comply.\nAustin’s chosen location for Dragon’s Nest was indeed remote, though in his two years of growth, he encountered wandering Beastmen while hunting, but back then he was struggling for survival and didn’t pay heed, and truly approaching his Dragon’s Nest were only Kobold Vini and his group.\nAs for Rodney’s homeless group, they were attracted solely by the Kobolds’ fishing smell, proving Austin’s precise choice of nest location.\nThough it provided Blue Young Dragon a great environment for growth, it simultaneously hindered his subordinate Clan’s pace of expanding strength by attracting population.\nIndeed, on the first day the smoke column rose, it attracted wandering Beastmen in the Kawa Great Forest.",

      "content": "Chapter 37: Chapter 35: Siblings\nCold, hungry.\nIn the icy world, all that could be seen was a boundless white expanse.\nThe big tree above was laden with thick snow and ice, with sharp icicles hanging down, extremely sharp.\nAt this moment under the tree covered with snow and ice, a small figure of a Jackal Wolf Person was carrying another young Jackal Wolf Person on his back, struggling through the thick snow.\nStepping on thick snow, sinking deep into it, the resistance of the snow hindered the small Jackal Wolf Person’s steps. Both toes had become numb from the cold, but he still gritted his teeth, holding tightly to the young Jackal Wolf Person on his back, showing no intention of letting go.\n\"Brother... can we... survive...?\"\nA weak voice came from behind, like a fragile flicker of light that might extinguish at any moment in the storm. Meng Bi couldn’t even feel the breath of his sister behind him.\nHis heart tightened at this moment,\neven deeper was a profound despair toward the boundless world of snow ahead.\n\"It’s okay, Aisha, we will definitely survive.\"\nMeng Bi gritted his teeth, his lips turning bluish-purple.\nHe suppressed his somewhat rapid breathing and spoke with strength and resolve.\n\"Aisha, you have to hold on. Didn’t you love eating meat the most? Soon, we’ll have meat to eat. Then we’ll find a warm grass nest, light a bonfire outside, let the flames burn all night, and we won’t fear the cold anymore. Do you remember those red flowers? I remember you loved that valley filled with red flowers, saying that when the wind blew, it was like a sea of red. Winter will soon pass, and when the snow melts and the weather warms, the plants will grow, and the valley’s flowers will bloom again. Then you can run on it like the wind...\"\nAs he spoke, tears welled up in Meng Bi’s eyes. He clenched his teeth to forcibly prevent himself from crying.\nHis feet had been walking in the snow for a long time, trembling, as if they might collapse at any moment.\nBut he still stood firm, walking step by step, leaving a trail of footprints behind him as he staggered forward with determination.\n\"Yes... Is that valley still there...\"\nOn Meng Bi’s back, Aisha, with her weak breath and dry eyes, suddenly glimmered with light, as if seeing that fiery red sea of flowers, seeing the mountain wind sweep across the land, the sea of flowers swaying, and herself running on it.\nThat was her happiest time.\nBack then, their parents were still around. She had just been born and once ran outside, accidentally entering that valley.\nThe nest was warm back then, and they had food every day. They weren’t starving like now. She could run with the wind across the sea of flowers in the valley, with her brother close behind.\nWhen did it all change?\nThe light in Aisha’s eyes slowly dimmed.\nWar suddenly broke out. Another tribe attacked them, and their parents died in the battle. She and her brother, Meng Bi, were captured by another tribe.\nBeing captured was more like becoming slaves, disposable slaves.\nThey had to work hard every day, but never received any food.\nIt seemed that in the eyes of the victors, not killing them was merely because they couldn’t be bothered to lift a knife, leaving them to die from hunger and exhaustion.\nIf it hadn’t been for Meng Bi accidentally running into the tribe leader’s warehouse during the chaos and stealing a large piece of jerky, they would’ve starved to death during the cold winter long ago.\nHowever, food eventually runs out. Even if they ate the large piece of jerky sliced with tree bark and grass roots, it inevitably got eaten.\nThe new tribe leader didn’t give them food, and soon after the start of the cold winter, the tribe seemed to face a food crisis. They planned to slaughter the captured slaves as provisions, which Meng Bi overheard secretly, prompting him to escape with Aisha when the guards were off guard.\nYet, the new tribe was like Hell, and staying there meant losing their lives.\nHow kind could the icy expanse of nature be to them?\nDuring the cold winter, Beastman Tribes often expelled a portion of the Beastmen to fend for themselves in the frozen wilderness. But even then, in such circumstances, only one in ten survived, let alone the two underage Jackal Wolf People?\nCold, hunger, starving beasts...\nAll sorts of dangers sought to keep them in the snow forever. Relying on bark and grass roots, they struggled to survive and continued trekking south.\nNo direction, no goal, taking it step by step, not knowing what tomorrow would bring.\nHad it not been for the luck of finding a frozen dead wolf during their escape, they would’ve perished in the wind and snow already.\nBut good luck would not accompany a person for long.\nNot long after, battered by wind and snow, with hunger and cold, Aisha, who was still very young, fell ill, lost the ability to move, and grew increasingly weak without sufficient nutrition.\nMeng Bi wouldn’t give up. Aisha couldn’t walk, so he carried her.\nBut what use was that? The cruelty of nature wouldn’t be moved by their perseverance. It was cold; it was merciless.\nNow, the Jackal Wolf siblings were at the brink of life and death.\n\"Brother, let me go... I can’t go on... Without me, you can survive...\"\nEven in her enfeebled state, Aisha could sense the current situation.\nShe knew her brother loved her deeply, but persisting like this would just drag him into death.\nAbandoning her, he still had a slim chance of life.\n\"Aisha, I won’t allow you to say such things again. Trust me, brother will definitely take you to that good place where we’ll have enough to eat, warmth to stay in, where there will be no more hunger and cold. That dream place, it must exist!\"\nMeng Bi’s eyes were completely red, large drops of tears falling, his voice choked with sobs.\n\"Brother, stop lying to me... Let me go... I know... I can’t survive this cold winter... If you have the chance... go back and take a good look at that valley full of red flowers for me, okay? I was the first to discover that place...\"\nA hint of proud smile appeared on Aisha’s pale face,\nbut her voice became weaker, softer...\nHer head was dizzy, about to fall into sleep.\n\"Aisha, hold on, listen to your brother, you must hold on, okay?\"\nThe choked voice echoed, icy cold wind blowing against him, Meng Bi felt something was about to depart.\nHe knew his sister needed rest,\nin this icy weather, she needed a warm bonfire, she needed some warm food.\nBut he had none,\nnothing at all.\nA vast white land, a cold, chilling despair.\nJust as he was sinking into total despair, a magnificent column of smoke suddenly rose from a distant hill.",

We have a chance to survive, we can live!\"\nHis pupils opened wide, as if he had found a glimmer of hope in a sea of despair.\nIn this icy and snowy land, that smoke could definitely not be naturally formed; where there’s smoke, it means there are people.\nPreviously, Monty had heard from the elderly among the Beastmen that some Great Tribes, when needing to expand, would light a big fire on nearby mountaintops, creating huge columns of smoke, burning for several days and nights, representing the tribe’s intention to attract new members.\nIn this icy and snowy land, Monty’s feet were swollen and numb from the cold, staring in the direction of that column of smoke. For the first time, he felt alive, with a direction.\nAisha weakly blinked, already too exhausted to speak.\n\"Hold on, Aisha, brother will surely save you!\"\nMonty gripped his little sister tightly on his back, stepping slowly toward the distant smoking mountain top.\nHe did not rest, even though he was already very tired,\nSurviving solely on roots and bark, Monty was almost at the brink of exhaustion.\nHe feared that if he sat down, he would never get up again.\nAnd his sister Aisha, the only hope, was to reach that smoke-filled mountain top, find those Beastmen, and beg to join their tribe. Only then would Aisha have a chance.\nHe could not afford to delay even for a single moment.\nHis feet felt as if filled with lead, stepping through the thick snow, as if they might never come out, his sister on his back felt unbearably heavy, waves of fatigue washed over him, threatening to drown him.\nBut Monty’s steps never paused, his heart held only one breath, propelling him forward—to save his sister!\nStep by step... step...\nHis vision began to blur, the biting cold penetrated from his feet up, bone-chilling, and Monty swayed in the snow, seemingly ready to fall at any moment.\nNever had he felt the distance that lay ahead, so close yet so far.\nHis consciousness blurred, his body moved mechanically forward, driven only by the indomitable will deep within.\nTime passed unnoticed, Monty didn’t know how long he had walked, how far he had traveled, until he reached a point near the mountain base, accidentally tripping over a stone buried in the snow, falling with a thud.\nHe was so close to the summit.\n\"Damn... ultimately couldn’t make it?\"\nHis sight blurred, a profound unwillingness filled his heart, as Monty lay on the ground, facing the mountain top, reaching out helplessly.\nYet in the end, the hand fell, his consciousness plunged into darkness.\nBut in the final moment before his awareness slipped, he seemed to hear a voice.\n\"Captain, there seems to be someone there!\"\n...\nSeveral days after the smoke rose, the mountain top attracted many stray Beastmen wandering in the Kawa Great Forest.\nKobolds, Jackal Wolf People, Goblins, Centaurs, among others, various types of Beastmen came; just five days saw nearly twenty Beastmen arrive, though they were mostly elderly, weak, and ailing outcasts, whom their tribes couldn’t support and had expelled.\nLooking frail, skin and bones, it was clear they hadn’t eaten well, mostly old and weak, several Beastmen collapsed unconscious on the snow along the way, fortunately, the patrol saw them and brought them back.\nThough these Beastmen were not in good physical condition, and Quik considered them a waste of food, merely adding burden to Dragon’s Nest Tribe.\nYet the Blue Young Dragon decided to take them all in, as after hunting the Blood Wolf packs, there was plenty for them to survive the cold winter, and fish from the frozen lake reservoir could provide adequate food.\nFor Austin, food was never an issue.\nFurthermore, for his plans for the coming year, he needed a lot of manpower to solidify his strength, naturally, the more people the better, so he took in all Beastmen coming to the White Smoke Mountain, regardless of age or frailty.\nOf course, they wouldn’t be directly integrated into Dragon’s Nest Village.\nThese newly allied Beastmen, after resting and regaining strength with enough food for a few days, underwent the same special training as those in Dragon Nest Village.\nOnly by passing similar military training could they fully integrate into Dragon Nest Tribe.\nWith the trained older Beastmen as instructors, new Beastmen, post-initial training, merged into the Dragon Nest Village’s Beastmen ranks, rapidly enhancing the tribe’s strength.\nAt this initial stage, Austin did not intend to implement any other governing methods, directly instituting a military state rule. In this world, there was no concept of human rights or freedom; as long as the Beastmen lived better, the subordinate forces would burst with strongest power.\nAs the white smoke column rose, numerous starved and cold wandering Beastmen gathered toward the signal mountain top, joining Dragon’s Nest Tribe’s ranks.\nHowever, as time passed, the number of wandering Beastmen slowly decreased, until it stabilized at one or two joining daily, determined by the white smoke column’s visible range; initially quite attractive to many.\nBut once the wandering Beastmen within visual range were absorbed, further arrivals depended on luck to enter the smoke’s visible zone and be drawn in.\nWhen the high furnace birthed a column of white smoke reaching the sky, it also produced quality charcoal; Austin promptly ordered Beastmen to build a wooden house beside it, storing charcoal there. When the time was right, and ore was available, refining copper and iron would proceed there.\nTime flowed slowly by, the cold winter’s departure was imminent.\nNewly joined Beastmen began arduous military training under old Beastmen’s guidance, after which they helped clear plain trees, and built their own homes. More physical tasks than any Beastman in any tribe did, only in Dragon Nest Tribe, everyone ate well, mostly having meat, which delighted new Beastmen, counting the moments to mealtime whether working or training.\nWith the influx of manpower, sufficient hands allowed Dragon Nest Tribe’s guard patrol numbers to increase, sometimes preemptively clearing local fierce wildlife, like tigers and leopards, ensuring Dragon Nest Tribe’s safety.",

      "content": "Chapter 39: Chapter 37: A New Day\nWhile lighting a white smoke column to attract wandering Beastmen, the Fox-faced Man Quik also followed the Blue Young Dragon’s command to visit those small tribes he remembered. Unfortunately, aside from a very secluded Goblin Tribe with only about ten people left, the rest had disappeared, perhaps migrated or perished in this harsh wilderness.\nHowever, even with just a dozen Goblins, combined with the wandering Beastmen attracted by the white smoke column, the population of the Dragon Nest Tribe had reached over seventy and was continuously increasing.\nSufficient manpower is the foundation for the great development of the territory.\nAlthough the surge in population created some tension in food supply for the Dragon Nest Village, with enough hands, the elder Beastmen in the Dragon Nest Tribe organized teams to hunt the hungry and dangerous fierce Hunters within a ten-mile radius, ensuring the safety of the Dragon Nest Tribe while also increasing the tribe’s food supply to a certain extent.\nBefore this, Austin had already carefully scouted the area around the Dragon Nest Territory to ensure there were no overly dangerous Magic Beasts. With the battle power of the Beastman military formation that had been baptized in blood, exterminating mere beasts was no big deal.\nEverything was proceeding in an orderly fashion.\nMilitary training, tree felling and land reclamation, charcoal burning, fishing, house building, and the like became the daily tasks of the Beastmen in the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nIf it were any other Beastman Tribe, they wouldn’t venture outside during this time unless the food supply was exhausted. Some Beastman Race tribes would stay inside all day during winter to reduce heat loss, with the entire tribe’s dwelling as silent as a grave, activity tracks buried under heavy snow, silent as night.\nBut the Dragon Nest Tribe was different; since they could use knowledge from the past life to obtain enough food, Austin naturally wouldn’t allow the Beastmen to waste time. The tasks that could be completed during the cold winter were tackled during this period to prepare for the upcoming land reclamation and farming endeavors.\nEven in this cold winter, the Beastmen kept busy, with the Dragon Nest Tribe covered in signs of their activities.\nAnd the Beastmen didn’t tire of the heavy labor; they even enjoyed the process of working up a sweat in the icy weather. Not even the ice and snow could curb the enthusiasm of the Beastmen. When carrying logs that required teamwork, a group of Beastmen would even sing loud, simple songs.\nDay after day, tides rise and fall.\nToot toot!\nIn the morning, as the sun just rose, the sharp sound of a whistle pierced the sky, waking up the entire Dragon Nest Village.\nThe whistle was made from a plant similar to bamboo, cut into a section that, when blown into forcefully, produced a strong whistle sound. It was very similar to the bamboo whistle from Austin’s previous life, so the Blue Young Dragon used it for the Beastman instructors to blow during drills and commands.\nThe whistle sound startled Meng Bi awake from his dream.\nNo longer was he in a cold snow pit, nor was his stomach growling with hunger; everything seemed like a dream.\nThe whistle outside sounded urgently. Reluctantly leaving the warm straw nest, even though his eyes were still sleepy, his body moved instinctively out through the door.\nThe other Beastmen in the same room also awakened, though their memories held few instances of Beastmen rising so early during the cold winter. Past winters were spent sleeping until naturally awakened, but under the various peculiar rules of the Dragon Nest Tribe, they dared not resist.\nNor did they want to resist, because those who were late would miss a meal for the day.\nFor these newly displaced, hungry, cold-stricken wandering Beastmen, food was more precious than life itself.\nTo obtain food, overcoming mere instinct was incredibly straightforward.\nMeng Bi rushed out with the crowd, shivering as the cold wind blew, banishing any remnants of sleep.\nBut that wasn’t the end; they hurried to the trough in front of the house, picked up bamboo cups to scoop the warm water prepared by Kobold cooks when making breakfast, and began washing up. In the icy outdoors, water turned to ice, so the water for brushing teeth and washing up had to be pre-warmed. However, the warm water quickly turned cold in such weather, chilling to the bone upon entering the mouth.\nFor washing, they used something similar to willow wood, chopstick-sized, with one end chewed into bristles, which, used with warm water, was continuously brushed between the teeth.\nEven this washing was one of the odd rules of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nSimilar to resolving waste disposal issues in dedicated toilets despite the cold wind, Meng Bi often grumbled about how these ideas were just whims of Lord Austin to torment them.\nYet grumble as he might, deep within, he held immense respect for the Blue Young Dragon Lord who saved his life, especially since they also saved his sister Aisha’s life.\nIf possible, Meng Bi would even offer his life to repay Lord Austin’s kindness.\nRecalling when he collapsed and thought it was the end, only to awaken alive, now sleeping on warm straw in a cozy house, with food on the table emitting enticing aromas.\nHe was revived, and his sister, with enough nourishment, also endured and eventually regained her health.\nMeng Bi made a silent vow to himself, regardless of how the Dragon Nest Tribe would treat him in the future; he was determined to dedicate his life to them.\nThinking of his sister Aisha, Meng Bi looked across towards her.\nThese newly-joined Beastmen trained together regardless of gender, but their work differed.\nEven among Beastmen, there was a difference between males and females, particularly for those like Meng Bi and Aisha who were underage, their living quarters were segregated by gender, though they regrouped for training.\nAt this moment, he saw his sister Aisha chatting happily with a Kobold girl while brushing her teeth. Meng Bi knew that Kobold girl, seemingly named Nina something, and was very pleased his sister had made a friend.\nHowever, it wasn’t time for talking now. Seeing his sister was well, Meng Bi quickly finished washing up, rinsed his face with water, returned the bamboo tube, and swiftly went to the village’s open ground, standing in his spot in the queue.\nThe other Beastmen also quickly finished washing up and joined the lineup before the whistle ended.\n\"Attention! Align right, look left, count off!\"\nThe stern Goblin Gulu instructor stopped blowing the whistle and barked out commands.\nThe entire team swiftly straightened and aligned into a neat, square formation.\nAfter aligning, they would participate in a morning run, have breakfast, and then begin a new day of activities.",

      "content": "Chapter 40: After modification: Chapter 38 Secret Surveillance\nOne by one, the newly joined wandering beastmen formed teams, and under the special training guidance of the elders in the Dragon Nest Tribe, they began to gradually integrate into this large collective.\nAustin’s initial plan finally bore fruit. Overcoming numerous difficulties at the beginning, he personally trained the initial seven Kobolds into a genuine army, and now there is a reward.\nThe training knowledge and methods he established are like a seed, starting to take root and sprout with the Dragon Nest Tribe as the core, spreading and binding the entire Dragon Nest Tribe into an unprecedented cohesive whole.\nAlthough in this Kawa Great Forest, many terrains are not suitable for group attacks, the beastmen army trained with modern concepts as the core can break down into numerous tactical squads to disperse and conduct joint attacks, and they can easily crush most beastman tribes of the same population.\nMoreover, if in a defensive stage, they can form a phalanx of clustered spears in open areas, and even Beastmen with numbers several times greater cannot hope to defeat them.\nA single chopstick is easy to break, but ten chopsticks gathered together are much harder.\nThis is the power of unity and discipline; facing those scattered beastman tribes in the Kawa Great Forest, those beastman teams that blindly charge with the tribe leader as the vanguard are utterly vulnerable before the trained beastman army of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nTraining, work, beast hunting, and other busy tasks have plunged the entire Dragon Nest Tribe into a state of bustling activity.\nAnd just as the entire Dragon Nest Tribe flourished and continued to develop.\nIn the midsection of a distant mountain ridge, several pairs of sharp eyes were hidden within the snowy scene, a few Jackal Wolf People were obscured under the bushes, quietly observing everything.\nBefore long, a figure swiftly darted under a snow-laden tree not far away and approached the Jackal Wolf People.\n\"Lord Hog, it’s been confirmed, the owner of this territory should be a Blue Young Dragon, with manpower roughly half of ours, maybe even less.\"\nA few days ago, the column of white smoke rising from the mountain naturally fell into the eyes of the Jackal Wolf People watching from over ten miles away, leading Hog and his group here under Simon’s orders to gather intelligence.\nThey could be regarded as the elite of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, skillfully avoiding the hunting patrols of beastmen on the outskirts and hiding nearby to spy on the recent actions of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nRegarding this beastman tribe that is still blindly messing around in the ice and snowy landscape during the cold winter, they grew increasingly puzzled.\n\"Less than half, huh...\"\nCaptain Hog gazed solemnly at the distant scene of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s beastman military training akin to ants, pondering silently in his heart.\nThe population of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe totals over two hundred, and this Blue Dragon Tribe should be fewer than a hundred beastmen. Coupled with the natural advantage that Jackal Wolf People have as bloodthirsty warriors, this ragtag beastmen group should be no match.\nThe troublesome factor is that Blue Young Dragon. Young dragons are typically nurtured by adult dragons; it’s unknown if there’s an adult Blue Dragon nearby, and if there is, that’s problematic and could cause significant issues for the plan.\nHog furrowed his brow; as an absolute high-ranking member of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, he clearly understands the significance of the tribe’s existence and some secrets. He and Simon did not appear in this remote place to establish settlements like other disgraced vagabonds being driven out; they came here with a mission.\n\"Continue investigating, are those beastmen using merely wooden spears? Also, assess the general capability of that Blue Young Dragon and whether there are any traces of adult Blue Dragons nearby. Everything needs to be thoroughly investigated.\"\nYoung Dragons at this age typically don’t recruit followers so early unless this Blue Young Dragon isn’t a typical Blue Young Dragon but an orphan dragon.\nAnd if it’s merely an orphan dragon, perhaps Simon could be advised to lead people here to annex the Dragon Nest Tribe, and if they manage to slay this Young Dragon, they would become Dragon Slayer Warriors. The various precious materials left by the Young Dragon could even enable them to evolve into a Sub-dragon Species, greatly enhancing both their potential and power.\nThe only trouble is the strength of this Blue Young Dragon.\nAs for that stupid dragon recruiting a bunch of ragtag soldiers and conducting monkey training every day, he completely disregarded them.\nAs long as the Jackal Wolf People deploy their forces, these beastmen are bound to collapse at a single strike, and the real trouble is only that Blue Young Dragon.\n\"Stay here and continue gathering information about the Dragon Nest Tribe, focusing on the Blue Young Dragon. Be careful to remain hidden, and if exposed, play the part of a wandering beastman and join them. I’ll return to report to the leader.\"\nWith a decision made, Hog issued orders to his subordinates.\nAlthough ordering them to stay here as watchful eyes, Hog knew the Jackal Wolfman Tribe would not launch a war against the Dragon Nest Tribe in the short term.\nFirstly, their tribe had wiped out several small tribes before the cold winter, seizing enough food to last through the season. Secondly, after the cold winter, when herbivores awaken from hibernation, it would be the best hunting period that Leader Simon wouldn’t want to miss.\nMoreover, the precise situation of the Blue Young Dragon hasn’t been clearly investigated, making Simon even less likely to move easily.\nHowever, despite this, while there would be no war in the short term, annexing the Dragon Nest Tribe before the next cold winter is certain.\nAfter issuing commands, Hog left the mountainside, heading towards the Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nMeanwhile, the Jackal Wolf People at the scene each discussed a little before dispersing.\n.....\nTime continuously flowed, and the Smoke Tower on the mountain kept emitting dense white smoke, constantly attracting wandering beastmen here, who would then join the Dragon Nest Tribe through unified training, slowly increasing the population to nearly a hundred.\nImplementing militarized collective management maximized the efficiency of the beastmen; the settlement expanded again with newly built wooden grass-structured houses, and a wooden wall was set up on the village’s perimeter to prevent beast attacks.\nSimultaneously, preparations for next year’s work were fruitful. Not only did they burn a significant amount of qualified charcoal on the mountain, but also felled nearly thirty acres of flatland by the river. Waiting for the cold winter to pass, the wild grass and trees would be burned clean to create new farmland.\nEvery day, every moment, the Dragon Nest Tribe grows and thrives; the footprints of beastmen began to densely surround the Dragon Nest Territory.\nSoon afterward, the Fire Attribute Magic Power tides from within the Seta Continent once again overpowered the Water Attribute Magic Power tides from the ocean, causing the air temperature to rise and ice and snow to melt.\nThe cold winter had passed.",

      "content": "Chapter 41: Chapter 39 Growth\nThe cold winter is retreating.\nOvernight, warm air enveloped the entire icy land, and the Kawa Great Forest was about to usher in nine months of growth.\nThe cold air currents were dispelled by the warm currents, and large patches of ice and snow began to melt and fall. The plants on the ground, having endured a cold winter, eagerly sprouted tender buds, unfurling and adding a touch of greenery to the whole world.\nAt the same time, the cold and warm air currents in the sky rubbed and collided with each other, producing a large number of clouds floating in the air. A misty drizzle began to fall from the sky, and occasionally one could see flashes of lightning suddenly passing through the depths of the clouds.\nAustin stood on the cliff, gazing at the overcast sky occasionally ripped apart by lightning. Suddenly, he became intrigued, spread his massive membrane wings, and soared into the clouds.\nMoist vapor enveloped him, and he keenly felt the ionization in the air caused by friction. As he entered, he instantly disrupted the balance between the clouds, with the positive and negative charges neutralizing and releasing a large amount of light and heat, forming numerous lightning bolts that densely struck him. Yet, the Blue Young Dragon was unharmed, instead merging into the environment as if it were where he belonged.\nVaguely, Austin felt some connection with the storm cloud in the sky, as if it were becoming an external part of his own body. But this connection was faintly thin, weakly allowing him only to sense the nearby thunderstorm area without any other effect.\nThe Blue Young Dragon knew this was an inherent ability of the Blue Dragon, with control over thunder and lightning being one of the means for a Blue Dragon to stand at the pinnacle of this world. In human legends, the blue demons descending from black storm clouds, bringing a thunderstorm purgatory to the world, were those wicked adult Blue Dragons.\nBlue Dragons have an innate ability to control thunderstorms, but this ability is closely tied to the dragon’s own strength. For instance, Austin, now just a two-to-three-year-old Young Dragon, could only vaguely sense a slight connection with the storm cloud and was unable to command it.\nTo influence the natural weather phenomena, one must at least be a Juvenile Dragon to stir a little power. Only an adult Blue Dragon could truly harness the full power of the storm clouds in nature.\n\"Although I didn’t have a carefree growth environment, it’s precisely because of this that my level is now much stronger than other Young Dragons of the same age.\"\nIn the inherited memories, the Young Dragon stage is raised by adult dragons, with no need to struggle to find prey or the magic substances needed for growth. They would eat and sleep to their heart’s content, with most of their time spent sleeping to digest various magical substances inside their bodies.\nAs the saying goes, life lies in movement. Perhaps this principle applies in the otherworld as well.\nUnlike other Young Dragons with carefree childhoods, Austin had to labor and worry about survival every day, flying out of the nest to search for prey, leaving early and returning late, struggling to survive. Perhaps it was this constant motion, rather than lying around in deep slumber, that accelerated Austin’s growth compared to other Young Dragons and sped up his digestion of magical substances.\nMeanwhile, using insights from his past life, Austin consistently used his talent magic, Electric Shock Paralysis, for self-induced electric stimulation training every day. Perhaps due to the differing races in this world, this method seemed to significantly enhance the activity of his cells, not only drastically reducing Austin’s sleep time but also accelerating the growth and division of his cells, making his entire body much larger than his peers.\n\"At this growth rate, I should be able to control the storm clouds and possess the power to change the weather by the time I’m thirty.\"\nThirty years is just the length of a nap in the long lifespans of the Dragon Race. However, Austin’s soul is not that of a dragon. Surviving in a place without computers, phones, or entertainment for thirty years just for a bit of self-protection? That’s truly despairing!\n\"Let’s first set a tiny, tiny, tiny goal, like getting my Clan population to a hundred thousand!\"\nTo rapidly increase strength, various magical substances like Magic Ore, Magic Crystals, Magic Beast Crystal Cores, and other precious Magic Resources are indispensable.\nAnd collecting these Magic Resources is indeed challenging for Austin alone. Only by expanding the subordinate Clan forces can he hope to quickly gather more Magic Resources.\nThus, the development and expansion of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s forces is Austin’s current top priority, not to mention that a strong Clan can also better protect Austin’s Dragon God’s safety.\nWith numerous thoughts swirling in his mind, the Blue Young Dragon flapped his wings, flying and darting into the clouds.\n...\nOutside, the ice and snow began to melt, and the sky occasionally drizzled a light rain. The whole world seemed damp, and the creatures that had been hungry during the winter began to emerge from their nests, joyfully nibbling on the earth’s newly sprouted buds.\nMeanwhile, the hunters, enduring their rumbling bellies, hid among the thickets, patiently waiting for the moment when their prey let down their guard.\nThe entire Kawa Great Forest once again fell into a new cycle of all things growing, marking the beginning of a new year.\nMeanwhile, in the Dragon Nest Territory, the plans for the new year also commenced.\nThe first task undertaken by the Dragon Nest Tribe wasn’t to begin cultivating the earth and sky, but to eliminate the fierce wild beasts within the territory.\nAs early as during the cold winter season, the Dragon Nest Tribe had sent out small teams to patrol and purposefully hunt down the hungry wild beasts around, preventing these beasts from attacking the Dragon Nest Tribe. However, at that time, only a portion of the beasts were hunted.\nNow that the cold winter season has passed, various animals are emerging from their nests and roaming the earth and mountains. Those beasts that had been hibernating are waking up and starting to hunt in various directions. To protect the environment around the Dragon Nest Tribe and to enrich the biological resources within the territory, rounding up these newly awakened beasts is imperative.\nMoreover, with the end of the cold winter, the ice layers on the lakes and reservoirs have thawed, making it difficult for the Dragon Nest Tribe to attract fish with the methods of ice gouging and hot water. The tribe has thus lost a significant food source.\nThough, based on Austin’s knowledge, the Beastmen have woven several nets using vines to catch a fair number of fish in nearby rivers. Nevertheless, it takes much more effort compared to ice-gouging fishing, and the yield is considerably lower.\nAs the population of the Dragon Nest Tribe surged, a food shortage had begun to emerge. Therefore, before the temperatures become sufficiently warm, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe has mobilized its population for a large-scale hunt.",

      "content": "Chapter 42: Chapter 40 Hunting\nAlthough farming is a major strategy for Austin in the new year, under the current conditions, hunting and gathering are also essential stages for acquiring food.\nMoreover, the ice and snow on the ground have just thawed, making it unsuitable to farm at such an early time.\nWhile the climate of the Kawa Great Forest roughly divides into cold winter and hot summer, in fact, if divided more meticulously, it could also be distinguished into spring and autumn like on Earth.\nHowever, these spring and autumn seasons are extremely short, just a matter of ten days or so, barely noticeable. The inhabitants of the Kawa Great Forest, mainly illiterate Beastmen, only treat this brief spring and autumn as a transition between winter and summer, without a specific name for it, thus conventionally regarding a year in the Kawa Great Forest as having only two seasons, winter and summer.\nWith different climates come different solar terms, and Austin naturally cannot use the solar terms knowledge from his past life in this world.\nHe has no idea when to sow or plant, but this problem is easily solved by simply mimicking the growth cycle of the wild rice. After all, the so-called seeds are just these wild rice grains.\nAnd now, during this period, when the wild rice in the wild hasn’t germinated yet, the Blue Young Dragon naturally wouldn’t sow rice seeds or start farming agriculture at this time.\nTaking advantage of these ten days of spring, along with the hungry beasts wandering after a cold winter affecting the safety of the Dragon Nest Tribe, this hunting expedition came naturally.\nAmong the forest hills, small animals hop around, nibbling at the tender grass blades while their large ears constantly twitch, listening for any sounds of danger around them.\nAt this time, with all things beginning to revive, the Kawa Great Forest started becoming lively again.\nEspecially Dragon Nest Territory, thanks to Austin’s deliberate attacks and the Beastmen’s deliberate hunting during winter, herbivorous animals have increased within the territory. More hopping rabbits, mountain deer, and wild cattle can be seen in the forest hills. Occasionally, when Beastmen were cutting trees to clear land, a gray rabbit might leap out from the thicket, only to be caught by the Beastmen and roasted over a fire for a meal.\nOf course, although these animals have proliferated within the Dragon Nest Territory due to the heavy culling of higher trophic level beasts by the Dragon Nest Tribe, it’s not to the extent of overpopulation because, without the other predator beasts, these Beastmen also prey on them, effectively replacing the previously wandering wild beasts’ role in the food chain within the Dragon Nest Territory.\nIn the dense forest, as the ground ice and snow haven’t completely melted, tender shoots have already started emerging from the soil.\nSuddenly, a shadow darted out of the forest, agilely leaping over stones on the ground, and swiftly dashed away in the distance with about eight or nine comrades in tow.\nThese are jackal wolves, inherently the rogues, the muggers within the natural food chain.\nIn fact, jackal wolves don’t solely rely on robbing other beasts of their prey for survival; more often, they coordinate and encircle those herbivores living near water and grass, being one of the bottom-tier hunters in this Kawa Great Forest.\nThough just at the bottom tier, jackal wolves, through mutual collaboration, can snatch food from ferocious beasts like lions and tigers.\nHowever, on this day, these fierce jackal wolves, daring even against lions and tigers, were fleeing frantically through the woods, disappearing in an instant.\nMoments later, the forest hills became tumultuous, revealing a dozen or so Beastmen, each grasping a long spear and leading two half-grown Blood Wolves, pursuing them closely.\nThese two half-grown Blood Wolves kept their heads low, sniffing the lingering scents in the air, maintaining an unwavering pace, following closely in the direction the jackal wolves had fled.\nAfter over a month of nurture, coupled with the terrifying dominance from the superior being Austin, these young Blood Wolves had thoroughly integrated into the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nDue to the young Blood Wolves not fully grown and being scarcely numbered, Austin’s envisioned wolf cavalry hadn’t yet a shadow, but these half-grown Blood Wolves could still be put to use, such as now in tracking prey.\nDuring the cold winter, Beastman patrol teams relied heavily on the keen noses of these young Blood Wolves while venturing out to eliminate nearby wild beasts.\n\"Over there, quickly follow up!\"\nThe leader of this squad was Lizardman Rodney. After his tribe was defeated by the Jackal Wolf People, he led the remnants to flee to Dragon Nest Territory, intending to raid the then Kobold village. However, as he took lead, expecting to charge forward, he ended up crashing headfirst into the Kobold spear phalanx, resulting in a head-broken and bloody face.\nAfter being hurled and heavily injured, his Beastman subordinates were quickly scattered, captured one by one by the Kobolds, becoming prisoners of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nLater, once his physical state recovered, Lizardman Rodney was thrown into the army for military training.\nThough it was a tough period, after enduring it, Rodney developed a strong recognition for this Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThinking back then, when he gathered a group of useless figures to establish a tribe on his own, wasn’t it just for a safe place to live, hoping not to starve or freeze?\nAnd now, with the Blue Young Dragon Austin’s protection, Beasty comrades who fought alongside him, and adequate food each day, life was much better than the precarious days before. As a muscle-brained Lizardman without grand ambitions, Rodney surrendered completely under Austin’s rule, becoming one of Austin’s many followers.\nDuring the previous Blood Wolf hunting war and cold winter hunting purge, due to his towering strength overwhelming the Beastman team, he performed exceptionally in battles and was appointed as a squad leader.\nThis time, leading a team out, he was tasked with the purging mission in this area, whether it be vipers, ferrets, or various jackals, wolves, tigers, and leopards, all carnivorous predators were to be purged.\nWith the Blood Wolves’ assistance, they swiftly amassed achievements, but then encountered trouble when faced with a pack of jackal wolves.\nUnlike those jackals, wolves, tigers, and leopards that blindly attack upon encountering Beastmen, only to be turned into pincushions by the Beastmen’s spear phalanx, after losing a few comrades, these jackal wolves retreat after just one battle, giving Rodney no time to show his prowess.\nThe Beastmen’s stamina, though decent, couldn’t outpace these four-legged jackal wolves, but no matter what, Rodney had reasons why he needs to eliminate them.\n\"Stay alert everyone, we’ve already fallen behind Team One and Team Two in our purge speed. If you don’t want to fall last in this drill, chase with all your might and catch those beasts!\"\nRodney shouted at his team while gasping for breath, to which his Beastmen loudly responded, quickly pursuing in the direction the jackal wolves had vanished.",

      "content": "Chapter 43: Chapter 41: The Cave\n\"Phew, those damned bastards, don’t let me see you again!\"\nThe Lizardman captain Rodney sat on a stone, breathing heavily, while the group of beastmen beside him were also panting.\nIn the end, they couldn’t catch up with the pack of hyenas, which managed to escape.\nIt’s not surprising; although the beastmen are physically much stronger than humans, they are still no match for these four-legged creatures accustomed to fleeing through the forest.\n\"Captain Rodney, just let them run. If we go further, we might run into people from other tribes.\"\nOne of the beastmen team members advised Rodney while panting, they had been chasing the hyenas for over twenty miles, and going further away from Dragon Nest Territory could easily lead to danger.\n\"Alright, in that case, let’s give up. Anyway, those damned thieves probably won’t dare come around here again. Let’s rest for a bit and prepare to head back.\"\nRodney exhaled deeply, considering for a moment. Although feeling a bit unwilling, he knew he had to stop.\nThey couldn’t stray far from Dragon Nest Territory to continue the chase and risk entering a dangerous environment.\nMoreover, those hyenas had already been driven out of Dragon Nest Territory, so at least they posed no threat to the territory anymore.\nThe group of beastmen rested for a while and prepared to leave.\nJust then, a thunderous boom erupted in the sky, and the gloomy heavens began to pour down rain. The torrent of rain crashed onto the leaves of the mountain forest, creating a loud rustling noise. At the same time, lightning flashed among the clouds, and the rumbling thunder echoed across the land.\nRodney looked up at the pouring rain in the sky and couldn’t help but curse:\n\"This damned weather!\"\nAt this time, the cold winter had just passed. The ground’s snow hadn’t fully melted, and the air was still quite chilly; getting drenched by this icy rain would make a person shiver all over, and the feeling was definitely unpleasant.\n\"If you don’t want to get soaked, hurry and find a place to take shelter.\"\nRodney’s full and loud voice shouted, and the beastmen immediately scattered.\n\"Report, Captain, there’s a cave here!\"\nNot long after, a beastman team member shouted loudly from not far away.\nThe beastmen quickly hunched their necks and scurried through the forest, running swiftly towards the source of the sound.\nIt was a cave hidden under a cliff tens of meters high, its entrance surrounded by vegetation. Sharp stalactites hung irregularly from the cave ceiling, indicating it was a naturally formed cave.\nThe beastmen searched the surroundings and, seeing no dangerous creatures, settled inside the cave to rest.\nThe rain outside continued to pour, and the wet beastmen shivered in the cool breeze that swept through the air.\n\"Damn it, someone start a fire, this damned rainy weather!\"\nWith Rodney’s cursing, a few beastmen quickly made a fire inside the cave. Fortunately, the cave had existed for countless years, leaving some dry twigs and leaves on the ground. As the flames rose, the coldness around them dissipated somewhat.\n\"Captain Rodney, last time you got punished by Chief Vini and put in that little black room because of your greed, didn’t you say you’d teach him a lesson once you got out? What happened?\"\n\"Damn it, Alyosha, don’t bring that up again. Next time you mess up, I’ll lock you in that little black room, and we’ll see if you’re still as smug!\"\n\"Hahaha...\"\nInside the cave, the beastmen warmed themselves by the fire, sitting together discussing various happenings in the territory. When excited, they burst into laughter. The military training truly bonded them, forging a camaraderie not common among ordinary beastmen.\nSuddenly,\na rustling sound came from within the cave.\n\"What was that noise?\"\nEven amidst their conversation, some sharp-eared beastmen heard the sound.\n\"What noise? You must have misheard.\"\nAs they spoke, a beastman took a burning stick from the fire, held it high, and illuminated the cave’s interior.\n\"It’s...!!!\"\nFollowing the light, Rodney’s eyes widened in shock, pupils shrinking to pinpoints.\nIn the dark corners of the cave, countless eyes reflected a green glow, calmly watching them from the shadows. Sinister silhouettes were drawn long and stretched in the firelight, like demons baring claws and fangs in the darkness.\nSpiders!\nSpiders larger than beastmen! Cramming every corner in numbers!\nLooking further into the cave, they could see ground covered in eerie white bones and webs crisscrossing everywhere, with small spiders crawling ceaselessly on them.\nThe surroundings deeper inside felt particularly eerie.\n...\nAs time passed, Dragon Nest Village entered a stage of rapid development.\nWith the passing of the cold winter, some impoverished tribes began migrating. Some beastmen scattered during the migration, filtering into the Kawa Great Forest to become roaming beastmen, and were then attracted by the white smoke columns to join the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThough in the Kawa Great Forest, smoke columns didn’t always signify prosperity. Some evil and cruel beastman tribes would, when lacking food, lure wandering beastmen with such smoke and turn them into food. However, compared to the perilous wilderness survival with almost no chance of success, an eighty percent success rate was a worthwhile gamble for those hungry and cold roaming beastmen.\nThus, with the end of the cold winter, the number of wandering beastmen drawn by the white smoke columns on nearby hills not only didn’t decrease but increased substantially.\nThe population influx brought sufficient manpower to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThrough military training, the beastmen gained strong discipline and cooperation abilities. Austin also taught them various hunting techniques and strategies from his previous life. Together, they’ve carried out several joint hunting operations in Dragon Nest Territory, yielding a large haul of prey to meet the needs of the growing population.\nNevertheless, the Blue Young Dragon understood that such extensive hunting, while providing ample food in the short term, would make it difficult to secure enough meat just by this method once the wild beasts in the territory were greatly reduced.\nDespite this, Austin wasn’t worried.\nThe primary goal of launching operations against wild beasts and secondary predators around Dragon Nest Territory this early spring was mainly to create a relatively safe environment for Dragon Nest Territory, not to obtain food.\nIn his plans for this year, if one or two goals could be achieved, coupled with regular hunting and gathering, then they wouldn’t have to worry about food scarcity during the upcoming cold winter.",

      "content": "Chapter 44: Chapter 42: New Food Sources\nFarming agriculture, livestock husbandry, and the metallurgy industry are the three major plans Austin intends to initiate in the new year.\nThe first two plans speak for themselves. No matter which one is completed, it will provide a continuous supply of food for the Dragon Nest Tribe, freeing them from hunger once and for all.\nThe final metallurgy industry will significantly enhance the military strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe and accelerate the development of productivity.\nIf the Dragon Nest is taken as the center, with a radius of over ten miles forming a Dragon Nest Territory, then with the current population of over a hundred in the Dragon Nest Tribe, relying solely on hunting and gathering for food from the forest is insufficient to support such a large Beastman population. What’s more, with smoke columns continuously rising from the mountains, a constant stream of wandering Beastmen are being attracted to join the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nTherefore, the initiation of agriculture is imperative, and Austin made considerable preparations for this last year’s cold winter. Not only did he clear land near a river by cutting down trees during the cold winter, but he also manufactured a large number of simple farming tools, ready to get to work once the cold winter passed.\nOf course, there will be quite a bit of time to transition before the rice crops yield results.\nHowever, this does not pose a problem for Austin.\nIn Austin’s view, there is a reason why the Beastman Tribes living in the Kawa Great Forest have remained in a primitive state of civilization for thousands of years.\nThey can’t even get enough to eat, so how could they think about anything else?\nYet, in reality, the forest contains many things that are edible.\nEvery year, a significant number of the Beastman population die of starvation largely because they don’t know what to eat.\nTheir diet, the Beastmen living in the Kawa Great Forest, mainly consists of gathered fruits, wild grass seeds, rice, starchy roots, tree roots dug up when there’s no food, and occasionally, the meat they manage to hunt.\nOther than this, there’s nothing else.\nIn fact, the proportion of edible things in the forest that are included in the Beastmen’s diet is less than one-tenth.\nIn Austin’s previous life, he grew up in a place where anything in the sky, on the ground, or in the water could be made into a gourmet dish to be presented on the table.\nIf a chef from his past life came here, he could probably find more than a thousand edible things just within the Dragon Nest Territory.\nOf course, Austin wasn’t a chef in his previous life, but he did inherit a bit of the foodie gene from that food-loving Empire and could comment on certain foods.\nFor example, bamboo shoots, the young shoots of ferns, mushrooms, and so on, which are things the Beastmen don’t eat.\nBamboo shoots, when eaten raw, have a rather unpleasant and astringent taste, and the young shoots of ferns are similar; they feel slippery and slimy like slugs when eaten raw, which is why the Beastmen overlook these foods.\nHowever, if you rinse these things in boiling water first to remove the bitterness and strange flavors, both bamboo shoots and fern shoots become really delicious.\nIn his past life, Austin also lived in rural areas, so he was quite familiar with these dishes that could be prepared in the countryside at any time.\nIt is precisely the lack of this pre-processing step of boiling in water that caused the Beastmen to overlook these hidden foods right by their side.\nAnd mushrooms are even simpler.\nThose Beastmen who dared to try mushrooms would just pick the prettiest, most vibrant one and eat it. How could that not go wrong?\nOver time, rumors spread that mushrooms were toxic and couldn’t be eaten, but Austin knew that the more colorful the mushroom, the more poisonous it was. Although some inconspicuous mushrooms aren’t necessarily non-toxic, this can be determined with a little testing.\nThe nutritional content of bamboo shoots and fern shoots is very high, and since these plants can regenerate from cuttings, they provide a steady source of food. What’s more, there’s a large bamboo forest near the Dragon Nest Territory, and ferns cover the hills extensively, so there is no shortage of them.\nAs for mushrooms, find a suitable damp place, scatter enough mushroom spores, and in the hot and humid climate of the Kawa Great Forest, there should be no issues.\nJust these three alone can significantly alleviate the food problem in the Dragon Nest Territory for the Beastmen.\nAlthough these three foods can only be considered as \"vegetables,\" they greatly ease the grain pressure on the Dragon Nest Tribe, combined with the recent large hunts yielding enough prey to sustain the Beastmen in the Dragon Nest Territory for a long time.\nFood is always the foundation of a community’s survival. With no worries about food, the Dragon Nest Tribe would naturally not sit idle but rather start large-scale construction under Austin’s guidance.\nAt this point, the Dragon Nest Tribe was no longer the primitive village built in the trees with just a single simple grass hut.\nBelow the Dragon Nest Cliff, a group of Beastmen cleared an area around the cliffs and built several different wood houses using newly sourced timber, totaling nine houses. The central one is an altar, dedicated to the Blue Young Dragon Austin, and assists in managing tribal affairs, representing the power center of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nFrom either side of the altar, two rows of houses extend outward, with a massive square corridor as their opposing center where the tribe gathers for morning assemblies and routine running.\nIn a remote corner of the village, a peculiar house stands alone, slightly out of place, which is the latrine Austin specifically ordered to be built.\nOn the empty ground beside the latrine, rows of earthen pits have been dug, reportedly prepared for planting the seeds brought back from the Blood Wolf Lair as instructed by the Blue Dragon Lord.\nAlong the perimeter, large wooden stakes are hacked and stood upright, with their tops sharpened and tightly bound with vines, with their bases buried underground to form a rudimentary fence that offers protection to the village.\nThese wooden stakes were sourced from the cleared plain meant for burning after felling the trees once the cold winter passed.\nHowever, seeing the expansion of the village requiring abundant timber, and with the trees from the cleared plain ready, they were immediately utilized.\nTall fences and properly arranged houses, though simple and rugged with a primitive charm, resemble the village prototype in Austin’s memory.\nEventually, expansion would be necessary. For these houses, Austin mostly favored a brick-and-tile structure to build a true village.\nUnfortunately, the work schedules for these Beastmen are fully packed currently, and his three major plans are just beginning, so brick-making and pottery can only be postponed.\nBut in a year, Austin has developed the Dragon Nest Village from one grass hut with seven Kobolds to its current form, resembling a true village with a population of over a hundred Beastmen.\nThe whole village, though small like a sparrow, possesses all the vital organs.",

      "content": "Chapter 45: Chapter 43: Choices for Pioneering Cultivation\nOn the plains by the river, a group of beastmen gathered under Austin’s command, pulling up the weeds on the ground, dragging the felled branches and leaves together, burying the stumps underneath, and then lighting a fire.\nTaking advantage of the clear weather, Austin planned to tidy up this plain, then proceed with tasks like turning the soil.\nCrackle, crackle, crackle!\nThe branches and leaves had been left for over a month and were already dry. As the great fire blazed fiercely, the flames leaped up, and the beastmen nearby added the freshly removed weeds from the side, instantly causing the fire to emit a large amount of thick smoke.\n\"So many stumps...\"\nAlthough a large area of land had been cleaned up, the stumps left after the trees were cut down still fiercely occupied the space, with gnarled roots emerging from the soil, making Austin’s head throb with pain.\nEven though the Blue Young Dragon really wanted to remove these remaining stumps, it was practically impossible to extract them from the soil. The vast area covered by the roots beneath determined that the beastmen simply couldn’t easily dig these stumps out.\n\"We’ll just have to leave these things in the soil to slowly rot.\"\nUnable to clear away these nuisances, this was the only solution.\nThe Blue Young Dragon lowered its head, clawing at the ground.\nThe dry soil appeared slightly gray, indicating that it wasn’t very fertile; rather, it was quite barren.\nHowever, this was normal, as the nutrients in the soil had been absorbed by the large trees that originally grew here, and with the climate resembling a tropical rainforest for most of the year, it would indeed be strange if the soil were fertile.\n\"We’ll just have to try planting some staple foods like kudzu root first.\"\nStaring at the barren soil underfoot, Austin thought to himself.\nInitially, Austin reclaimed this land to plant rice this year, but after some contemplation, he abandoned the idea and planned to plant kudzu in this twenty-acre reclaimed land instead.\nThe so-called kudzu root was not actually the powdered kudzu seen in Austin’s previous life, but rather some edible tubers resembling kudzu that the beastmen had dug out from the forest. The beastmen hadn’t named these plants, so to keep it simple, Austin simply called them kudzu root.\n\"Kudzu belongs to the legume family and seems to be able to enrich the soil. After planting it for a year or two and adding silt, manure, and other fertilizers, even the most barren land should become fertile. It’s just a pity we haven’t found potatoes or sweet potatoes, otherwise that would be even better.\"\nIn fact, the kudzu root in this world, whether in yield or starch content, was less than a tenth of the powdered kudzu of Austin’s previous life, but after careful consideration, Austin believed that it was the best crop to plant on a newly reclaimed land.\nFirstly, this newly reclaimed land was still very barren. If planting rice or similar crops, the harvest might be poor due to soil issues. Moreover, in the highly variable environment of typhoon rainstorms in the Kawa Great Forest, concentrating on planting rice could result in lodging due to storms, significantly reducing yield. Also, concentrated planting could easily encounter pest infestations and other disaster resistance challenges.\nAustin had grown up in rural southern areas during his previous life, and even though he later moved to the city and hadn’t farmed much again, he still remembered a thing or two about planting rice crops.\nEven if the kinds of crops and their growing habits were different in every world, fundamentally, the growing environment for rice was similar.\nMoreover, with the various scattered stumps in the reclaimed plain land, it wasn’t very friendly for rice, which required meticulous care and cultivation.\nThis first reclamation planting held significant importance for the Dragon Nest Territory, bearing the crucial responsibility of addressing the food source for the Dragon Nest Tribe. The Blue Young Dragon felt it would be better to plant sturdy and resilient crops.\nKudzu root was suitable for planting the first time due to its underground growth, and its roots and vines were not picky about growth environments, with life force stronger than rice crops.\n\"One step at a time is always the way to go.\"\nCompared to rice crops, the yield of kudzu root was certainly not as high. Even if twenty acres were planted, it might not meet the entire Dragon Nest Tribe’s needs. But kudzu root’s life force was much stronger than rice, generally impervious to natural pest disasters. Once the kudzu was harvested, combined with other foods hunted and gathered from nature, it would be enough.\n\"After a year or two, after planting kudzu for a few seasons and turning the barren land mature, planting rice for more food harvest would become feasible.\"\nFor rice planting, Austin decided to remain cautious, but he wasn’t entirely giving it up either.\nFor instance, there were some wild rice growing in ponds and marshes outdoors. Then, sending the beastmen to clear the wild grasses there, leveling those ponds and marshes and sowing rice seeds on top, treating them as experimental fields, planting rice a few times to gather experience first.\nThe beastmen were new to farming with no experience at all, so by creating a few experimental fields like this, it would be more convenient for large-scale planting later.\nWhile Austin was dreaming of a beautiful future, Vini, the Kobold who temporarily served as the \"Village Chief\" of the Dragon Nest Village, was grimacing, holding a strangely shaped wooden shovel, flipping a clump of weeds onto the fire.\nLord Austin had started issuing those baffling orders again lately.\nYes, in \"Village Chief\" Vini’s view, these orders to fell trees and clear land were just \"random blundering,\" and even the present, let alone the entire Dragon Nest Tribe, the beastmen thought so.\nIn expounding them to craft these strangely shaped wooden shovels, inexplicably cutting trees by the river, burning the weeds and leaves, and incomprehensibly turning a wooded plain into a \"bare soil\" appearance...\nThe Blue Young Dragon hadn’t shared his plan with the beastmen, but the concept of obeying orders was deeply ingrained in their minds after military training, driven by Austin. Moreover, these beastmen had no conception of farming or agriculture; they wouldn’t understand the importance of agriculture, so they just followed orders. Once the harvest came, they would naturally understand its significance.\nFor this reason, many of Austin’s actions seemed like idle games to the beastmen.\nBut due to the absolute prestige Blue Young Dragon had achieved through various accomplishments during this period, none of the beastmen, including Vini, who highly admired him, would utter a word of complaint. Even if the Blue Young Dragon continued his antics, they would support and follow him.\nHowever, in Vini’s heart, he still hoped that Austin’s playful whimsy would pass quickly. In his Kobold mind, even going for military training would be far better than this \"random blundering.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 46: Chapter 44 Turning the Soil\nMilitary training can enhance the combat power of the Beastmen subordinates, and group activities of hunting beasts can bring food to the Dragon Nest Tribe, both of which are much more meaningful in Vini’s view than this \"boring idle game.\"\nOriginally watching the heaps of grass as tall as a Beastman about to burn out, Vini felt it was time to move on to important tasks like hunting or training, but unfortunately, his wish never materialized.\n\"Vini, your next task is to lead your subordinates with wooden shovels to turn over all this land!\"\nThe Blue Young Dragon enthusiastically gave orders, looking at this vast expanse of land with a surge of ambition.\nThis will be the first step of a long journey!\nAs long as this beginning is done well, it will be much better afterward.\nAustin just moved his lips, but it made the Beastman Race run tirelessly.\nWith a wry smile, Vini led a large group of Beastmen, found a place, and commanded them to start turning soil.\nTwelve hectares of land, nearly the size of two sports fields, even though over fifty Beastmen gathered for the task, it would take at least a whole day to turn all twelve hectares completely.\nWith a step on the shovel and a lift of the wooden handle, the thick soil was turned over.\nTurning soil is labor-intensive work, and even though the physical strength of Beastmen surpasses ordinary humans, before long even they were panting and sweating all over.\nWatching the crowd of Beastmen sweating profusely, working zealously for over half an hour, they had only turned a corner of the area.\n\"It seems we should see if we can domesticate some wild cattle and horses in the future, otherwise, this speed is too slow.\"\nCasually watching the multitude battling wits and strength with the soil, Austin pondered silently in his heart.\nOnly twelve hectares of land were reclaimed, along with the output of Pueraria, far from enough for the Beastmen’s rations. After completing the cultivation of this land, further reclamation outward is inevitable.\nAlthough after the next reclamation expansion, the Beastmen will be faster with experience, it is ultimately no match for animal power. If they could domesticate cattle and horses, then whether it’s for reclamation or future continuous development, it will have enormous utility.\n\"Since choosing Pueraria as the first crop, there is no need to find land near rivers. After all, Pueraria can survive in some barren hills with insufficient water sources.\"\nIf this is the case, it can greatly reduce the difficulty of reclamation.\nAs Austin was planning for the future, noticing the crowd of Beastmen sweating profusely, appearing somewhat overwhelmed, the \"Village Chief\" Vini ordered the Beastmen to stop and take a rest, sit down, and drink some water.\nHe then pondered several times in his heart before finally approaching Austin with hesitation.\n\"Your Highness Austin, to turn over all the soil here, it cannot be done without a full day. Today’s training and hunting are still unfinished, so what do you think...\"\nVini spoke, looking at the Blue Young Dragon with a face full of hope, clearly wishing to stop the meaningless soil turning to do more meaningful training and hunting.\n\"Your military training has been done very well. Before upgrading the weapons, just run five kilometers each morning and evening, and review the stance rotation, it’s enough.\"\nAfter several months of training, the Beastmen had shed their former laziness, and after several bloody battles, once gathered into an army, they immediately exuded a fierce aura, forming a forest of spears, appearing orderly trained, extremely sharp.\nHowever, Austin also knew that Beastmen holding long spears made of wooden sticks have reached their limit already. Further training would only add a small increment of fighting power, better spent on agriculture instead.\nAnyway, it’s only when the Blue Young Dragon refines copper and iron, and when each Beastman is clad in Bronze Armor, wielding bronze and iron weapons, that they can significantly enhance the combat power of the subordinate army.\n\"Regarding hunting, the smoked meat made from your hunts these days is enough for the Dragon Nest Tribe’s needs for more than a month, and the beasts within the Dragon Nest Territory have been reduced to a very small degree, so there’s no need to expend more effort. Focus entirely on accomplishing what I’ve entrusted to you. If successful, the Tribe will no longer fear hunger in the future.\"\nExcessive hunting is no better, for even hunting cannot exhaust the pond and fish in one stroke, so now the beasts within the Dragon Nest Territory pose no threat to the Beastmen. When they grow up, hunt again, and there will be plenty of food harvested.\nVini was a bit puzzled, how did turning soil relate to not being hungry again?\nBut though puzzled, Vini refrained from asking.\nJust obey the orders; if His Highness Austin says it can be done, then it certainly can be.\nThis was the belief and blind faith formed through countless miracles experienced after becoming a subordinate clan of the Blue Young Dragon.\nVini raised his spirits and returned to the team, conveying Austin’s words to the Beastmen present, and those resting Beastmen immediately perked up greatly.\nUnder the leadership of the Blue Young Dragon, they’ve had full meals, living a life previously unimaginable, through which all Beastmen developed deep admiration for Austin. Since these words were spoken by His Highness Austin, they must be correct.\nWatching the previously exhausted Beastmen suddenly revived and enthused, even Austin felt a little speechless.\nSaying Beastmen have simple minds and are rough around the edges is not entirely without reason.\nBut it is precisely this advantage that allows Austin to lead these Beastmen smoothly without expending excessive mental effort.\nAs the Blue Young Dragon oversaw the Beastmen’s soil-turning work, a Kobold suddenly ran over hurriedly from not far away, shouting as if seeing a savior:\n\"Your Highness, Your Highness Austin, finally found you!\"\n\"What’s wrong?\"\nLooking at the Kobold that rushed before him, Austin asked in a deep voice.\n\"Something has happened, something has happened, the three teams that went out hunting have returned, many Beastmen were injured!\"\nAt this point, the surrounding Beastmen all stopped their work, directing their sight over to the panting Kobold, who revealed something that greatly concerned Austin from his mouth.\nYesterday, the three teams went south of the Dragon Nest Territory to hunt beasts and did not return overnight, finally coming back today.\nBut the returning Beastmen were nearly all injured, especially the leading captain, Lizardman Rodney, who was barely hanging on.\nAccording to those Beastman team members, they entered a cave and encountered spiders, very large, very terrifying, very many spiders!\nAnd from the Beastmen’s description, the large spiders in that Spider Cave seemed to be Magic Beasts with Talent Magic!",

      "content": "Chapter 47: Chapter 45 Poison Injury\nBefore the cold winter season ended, the Beastman population within the Dragon Nest Territory had already exceeded one hundred.\nSuch a large population couldn’t be satisfied by the previous rough management system that centered on one person; to facilitate daily management and training, Austin implemented a certain degree of reform in the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAmong them, the relatively large and strong Jackal Wolf People and Kobolds were selected from the Beastman Tribe to form three combat teams, each with twelve Beastmen, with a captain appointed to lead them. Their main responsibilities included hunting, clearing beasts, and potentially attacking hostile villages and other military affairs in the future.\nThose Beastmen who were filtered out and those small-sized, less combat-capable races such as Goblins and Goblinoids were reorganized to become the civil production corps, mainly engaging in net fishing, house construction, field gathering, and land reclamation for farming and other daily life tasks.\nIn other words, the first, second, and third teams were considered the regular army, while the rest were the primary production militia corps.\nOf course, these three major teams were not fully full-time military forces; they also needed to engage in certain production activities on regular days, focusing primarily on their daily training and hunting battles.\nThe production corps, however, was not solely involved in daily production activities; they had to undergo some military training every morning and evening to ensure that, in the event of a war, they could be recruited and join the battle immediately, especially since the Dragon Nest Tribe was still weak, and every bit of power needed to be consolidated.\nThe three patrol and hunting teams led by Lizardman Rodney suffered heavy losses, which was no small matter; they were the elite combat force of the Dragon Nest Tribe, and Austin certainly couldn’t remain indifferent.\nSuch a major incident naturally couldn’t leave one unmoved; the ongoing reclamation work was stopped as well, and at the sound of a loud whistle, those collecting vines, fishing, and working in various parts of the Dragon Nest Territory began rushing back to the village. They picked up their long spears, staying on high alert and patrolling constantly around the Dragon Nest Village to prevent an enemy attack.\nMeanwhile, at the square of the Dragon Nest Village.\nBeastmen lay on wooden boards covered with straw, their bodies swelling with patches of purple and green bruises, groaning in agony—a truly miserable sight. The Fox-faced Man Quik was sweating profusely, continually inspecting the wounds, surrounded by a crowd of Beastmen.\n\"How’s the situation?\"\nSuddenly, a strong gust of wind whipped up in the sky, and a massive shadow spiraled downwards. The onlooking Beastmen quickly scattered, making space for the enormous figure that landed in the center.\n\"Your Highness, these poisons are too potent. Unless there’s a Beastman Priest, otherwise....\"\nSeeing Austin land, Quik hurried over to report, while his gaze occasionally drifted to the wounds on numerous Beastmen, a look of regret filling his eyes.\nThe Blue Young Dragon didn’t speak, taking a few steps forward, scrutinizing the six Beastmen lying on the straw.\nTheir bodies looked as if they’d been stung to the brink of death by a large swarm of wasps, swelling all over with fist-sized, bluish bruises rising on their skin. Tiny, black as ink punctures the size of toothpicks were visible, spreading like a black web.\nMoreover, these Beastmen were also covered with more or less white and gray spider silks, their fur dusted as if they’d walked out of an ancient, dust-laden house.\n\"Can someone explain to me in detail what exactly happened here?\"\nAustin looked over at the lightly injured members of the three teams not far away and asked in a deep voice.\nThe Beastman who had come to him earlier spoke incoherently about the situation within the village, but Austin only knew that they had been attacked by spiders in a cave without any details.\nSeeing the condition of these Beastmen, one could sense the lingering magic power—it must be a true Magic Beast that was able to leave such wounds.\n\"Your Highness, it’s like this...\"\nAt this point, one of the resting Jackal Wolf People with relatively minor injuries stepped forward, trembling slightly, and began recounting the events in a somewhat fearful tone.\nIt turns out that yesterday, when they were hunting in the west forest area, they encountered a pack of hyenas. While trying to hunt them, most of them escaped. Captain Rodney led the chase, but in the end, those hyenas fled.\nThen, a rainfall came from the sky. They originally planned to find a place to hide and wait until the rain subsided before returning to the village, so they entered a cave for shelter.\nBut who could have known, inside that cave was a nest of mutant spider creatures. Out of nowhere, those spiders launched a vicious attack on them. Captain Rodney organized defenses, but it was ineffective; those large spiders could even spew toxic fog, blinding the Beastmen’s vision while fist-sized black spiders swarmed out like a tide, nearly drowning them.\nIf Rodney hadn’t led a charge out just in time and the spiders hadn’t pursued them outside the cave’s entrance, they might have remained there as a pile of bones.\nEven though the Beastmen retreated quickly, the initial wave of attacks still caused them grievous losses, and it was with great difficulty that they managed to bring everyone back.\n\"A cave full of spider dwellings?\"\nAustin pondered silently, lost in thought.\nAccording to the Jackal Wolf Person, the spiders inhabiting that cave must undoubtedly be Magic Beasts.\nAnd very troublesome ones at that, or else the three teams wouldn’t have nearly faced total annihilation.\nThe toxic fog they spewed should be the Talent Magic of those Magic Beast spiders.\nBut why would a cave gather so many spiders and produce such Spider Magical Beasts?\nThe Blue Young Dragon’s mind swirled with countless thoughts.\nBut soon, he discarded all these musings.\nWhat mattered most now were these severely injured Beastmen elites in front of them!\n\"Quik, even you can’t help them?\"\nIn the entire Dragon Nest Tribe, even with the influx of many stray Beastmen, the Fox-faced Man Quik remained the most knowledgeable Beastman. If even he couldn’t help, wouldn’t these severely injured Beastmen have to wait for death?\n\"Your Highness, I am not a Beastman Priest, I simply have no way!\"\nThe Fox-faced Man Quik showed a troubled expression. For Beastmen like them, the lower class, injuries often meant waiting to die—where would they find any healing methods?\nUnless a Beastman Priest, or a human Priest, could be found, there would be no way.\n\"Looks like we’ll have to take desperate measures.\"\nAustin felt a slight headache but realized it was the only option.\nIn this world, although there were professions like Pharmacists, there were no doctors. Ordinary people, without the money to hire a Priest at the church or buy potions, could only await death. If it was this way for humans, what more for the less civilized Beastmen?\nEven though Austin, in his previous life, wasn’t a doctor, he did have some knowledge of certain folk remedies from rural areas.",

      "content": "Chapter 48: Chapter 46 Spider Cave\nIn addition to respiratory poisoning from the toxic fog, these wounded had more injuries from poisonous spider bites.\nIn his past life during elementary school in the countryside, a teacher had taught about handling snake bites. While Austin forgot the specific steps, it generally involved tying off the blood vessel to prevent the poison from spreading to the heart, and using a knife to create a cross-shaped incision to squeeze out the poison.\nBoth spiders and snakes are highly venomous creatures, so the treatment should be roughly similar.\nUnder Austin’s command, the group of beastmen immediately used knives to open the wounds, hoping to force out some of the poison.\nHowever, perhaps due to the passage of time, the poison had already seeped into the muscle cells, making it impossible to squeeze the deadly spider venom out of the muscle.\nIt could also be a problem with the physique of otherworldly beastmen; the poison from the bites was trapped in the swollen muscle, perhaps preventing the venom from flowing to the heart, thereby allowing these beastmen to miraculously survive.\nBut this state would not last long. These beastmen had already inhaled the toxic fog from the poisonous spiders and were in a poisoned state. If the concentrated poison in the wounds fully penetrates the swollen muscles into the blood vessels, there would be no saving them.\n\"Go chop some bamboo.\"\nSeeing that the method of cutting open the wounds and squeezing out the poison was ineffective, Austin did not give up, but started on a rural remedy—cupping.\nSoon, a few beastmen chopped down some bamboo, and under the guidance of the Blue Young Dragon, cut them into bamboo tubes, then polished the edges clean.\nNext, they lit a flame with some tinder and briefly heated the inside of the bamboo, then quickly covered the swollen, bruised wounds with a pop.\nDue to the principle of thermal expansion and contraction, the bamboo tube stuck tightly to the beastmen’s skin.\nThe beastmen quietly waited nearby, and after about five to ten minutes, they removed the bamboo tubes.\nAt the wounds, blackened blood mixed with poison flowed from the swollen wound, and the swelling seemed to reduce slightly, the bruise color fading significantly.\nIt worked!\nThus, under the busyness of the beastmen, these beastmen lying on the straw began a continuous session of cupping.\nAfter a busy half day’s work, the injured began to breathe easier and fell into a deep sleep.\nThe attending beastmen breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that although the wounded beastmen’s lips remained purple-black, they were far better off than before when they were groaning and wailing. The poison in the wounds had been cleaned out, and the unbearable pain tormenting them all day had vanished.\n\"Your Highness... it’s really better!\"\nQuik looked at Rodney and the others, who had been wailing in pain but now were soundly asleep, and was almost at a loss for words.\nIn this Kawa Great Forest, beastmen’s lives were the least valuable, especially for these lower-class species, who could only wait for death if injured or poisoned.\nBut now, Austin had not only not given up on these doomed fellows but had used a simple method to treat them with very positive results.\nFor a moment, Quik was filled with countless words but couldn’t say a single one.\n\"Not good enough yet.\"\nAustin shook his head, knowing that although the wounded had fallen into a deep sleep, the problem was far from resolved.\nThey had merely been exhausted by the pain of the spider bites. The cupping only treated the external problem, and by the look of their purple-blue complexions, it was clear the poison was far from being neutralized.\n\"It’ll be fine, Your Highness. With your benevolence, Rodney and the others will surely get through this ordeal.\"\nQuik sincerely said to Austin, acting as the clan leader who cared for them, these Clansmen, had never seen such a benevolent leader in his life who cared about the health of unimportant soldiers.\n\"Bring squads one and two, prepare the troops, we’re going to inspect the Spider Cave.\"\nRegarding Quik’s suggestion of leaving Rodney and the other wounded to fend for themselves, Austin neither affirmed nor denied, simply giving orders.\nIn his past life’s village, the elders always said that within ten steps of a poisonous snake, there was always an antidote.\nAustin did not know the truth of that saying, but if that group of spiders lived in caves, there might be plants or animals within that had certain immunity to the spider venom, and those plants or animals might be useful in neutralizing the poison in Rodney and others.\nMoreover, an area where magical beasts gathered was likely to have magic resources.\nCertainly, Austin had every reason to make this trip.\nAfter arranging for guarded beastmen, Austin took two elite squads towards the direction of the Spider Cave.\nAfter almost two hours, they finally arrived at the entrance of the Spider Cave.\n\"It’s here, Your Highness Austin.\"\nThe Jackal Wolf People guiding the Blue Young Dragon spoke with a tremor in their voice, looking at the pitch-dark cave entrance as if seeing the gates of Hell, pale and filled with fear.\nPoor child, perhaps from now on he would have developed claustrophobia.\nLooking at the dark entrance, there were still some scattered footprints on the grass, left by Rodney and others in their frantic escape.\nAnd from within, Austin keenly sensed that the magic seemed to grow more active...\n\"Squad two, go fetch some torches.\"\nThe cave was deep and dark inside; without torches, visibility was impossible.\nAnd the spiders were afraid of fire; maybe Rodney and the others had been attacked because they attracted attention with their bonfire, and by boldly entering with torches, they might enjoy the same treatment.\nOf course, this would fit right into Blue Young Dragon’s expectations.\nThis exploration had the dual purpose of finding an antidote and probing enemy conditions.\nAnd with him there, there was no reason to fear them.\nSoon, the beastmen of the second squad lit five or six torches, and under Austin’s command, the group of beastmen, along with the dragon, cautiously ventured into the cave.\n\"I wonder if there would be any magic crystal ore-type resources inside; there should be, or else the spider magical beasts wouldn’t be able to survive in such a nest...\"\nWith many thoughts in mind, the Blue Young Dragon slowly entered the cave.\nFortunately, the entrance wasn’t too small, allowing Austin to enter with his stature; otherwise, it would’ve been quite a hassle.\nHopefully... there will be a great reward.",

      "content": "Chapter 49: Chapter 47: Battle\nMagic Beasts generally don’t occupy barren lands without reason. Since this cave is inhabited by a group of magic spiders, it suggests that there might be Magic Ore and other resources within.\nThis is one of the reasons why Austin intends to explore the Spider Cave.\nThe group cautiously entered the cave, carefully observing their surroundings. Apart from the traces left by Rodney and the others, such as burnt-out campfires, there was nothing unusual.\nThe firelight illuminated the cave walls, which were not smooth. Stalactites hung from the ceiling, and the uneven rocks cast shadows all around.\nThe cave was quite spacious, with a height and width of about ten meters. Even as Austin stood in the midst of the group, he felt the vastness of the cave.\nHowever, the Beastmen had no interest in this. They were alertly scanning their surroundings, not daring to relax for a moment.\nThe deeper parts of the cave were pitch black, with nothing visible. The air was silent, with only the rustling sound of footsteps on the ground and the unsteady flicker of fire reflecting off the walls.\nSuddenly, a shadow abruptly descended from above!\n\"Watch your heads! Stab!\"\nThe Beastman team immediately raised their Long Spears in unison, thrusting towards the shadow that fell from above.\nThere was no imagined splattering of fluids. The dense Long Spears struck a giant spider web. The web’s strong adhesive force almost glued the spears together, making it impossible to pull back.\nAt the same time, fist-sized black spiders suddenly emerged from the shadows, crawling out like a black tide surging towards the Beastmen.\nThe dense swarm of black spiders would strike fear into anyone’s heart, even those without arachnophobia.\nAt that moment, the Long Spears thrust by the Beastmen were stuck in the air by the spider web. Even if they were retrieved, the spears would be of little use against the thousands of fist-sized spiders.\n\"Use fire! Use fire to stop them!\"\nUnder Austin’s stern command, the Beastmen at the forefront hurriedly swung their torches to the ground. The spiders that blindly charged forward were scorched by the fire and immediately curled up, motionless. Some spiders, seeing the flames approaching, leaped back in retreat.\nIn no time, a savory scent filled the air, and the ground was littered with lifeless, curled-up spiders. At least a thousand spiders died in this wave.\nThe remaining spiders seemed frightened and retreated, not daring to venture beyond their safety zone.\nYet Austin didn’t relax for a second, his eyes fixed intently on the dark depths of the cave.\nSoon, the darkness dispersed, accompanied by a rustling sound. A more than one-meter-tall massive shadow, with menacing limbs and fangs that glimmered eerily, emerged from the shadows.\nIts giant limbs, monstrous face, and its flashing venomous fangs made this large spider several times more terrifying than the smaller ones!\nIts countless eyes fixed on them, causing every Beastman present to break out in a cold sweat, their hearts trembling.\nBut it didn’t end there. Another rustling sound was heard, and three equally large giant spiders came out from the depths of the cave, standing opposite the Beastmen, their dozen or so glowing eyes staring at them as if looking at a group of walking meals.\nFour appeared at once, but these four large spiders definitely couldn’t be the leaders of the Spider Cave. At most, they were elite creatures, while deeper down, who knew how many large spiders were hidden, and what size the final Spider Leader would reach.\nHowever, what’s most important now is to deal with the immediate trouble.\n\"Everyone, listen to the command, throw spears at those four big guys!\"\nWith the earlier opportunity, the Beastmen had already burned the webs stuck to their Long Spears. Following Austin’s command, the Beastmen bent their backs and forcefully hurled their Long Spears at the spiders ahead.\nThe air was pierced with a series of piercing sounds as the Long Spears shot through the air towards the four giant spiders.\nThud, thud, thud...\nThe Long Spears, carrying immense power, pierced in, hitting the bodies of the four giant spiders.\nTo everyone’s surprise, it had no effect at all!\nThe carapaces of those large spiders were like cowhide Leather Armor. The Long Spears could only dent them slightly before being bounced away.\nSeveral Long Spears that didn’t hit the large spiders achieved astounding results, piercing through several small spiders completely.\nHiss, hiss!\nAlthough the Long Spears didn’t injure the large spiders, it seemed the pain was unavoidable, as the four large spiders screamed, seemingly overwhelmed by anger.\nClouds of blue smoke suddenly spewed from the mouths of the four large spiders, spreading into the air. Wherever the blue mist passed, even the dry leaves on the ground were corroded, and the surrounding stone walls were stripped of a thin layer, melting away, making it extremely terrifying.\nHowever, what caught Austin’s attention was the presence of some white clover-like weeds inside the cave. When the dry leaves on the ground were corroded, they were revealed, and when the corrosive poison mist seeped over, instead of withering, they seemed to grow brighter.\n\"These weeds perhaps can serve as an antidote!\"\nThe thought instantly flashed through Blue Young Dragon’s mind, but what’s most important now is to overcome the immediate crisis.\nThe ground swarmed with thousands of spiders who, with the large spiders’ screams, seemed to go mad and surged towards the Beastmen. The air was filled with the spreading blue poison mist, and at the same time, the four large spiders continuously shot webs into the air, forcing the Beastmen to use their Long Spears to block the descending webs.\n\"Everyone, retreat!\"\nSeeing the torches slowly extinguish in the spreading poison mist, the Beastmen in the lead were about to be shrouded by the poison mist. The Blue Young Dragon quickly issued a deep-voiced order.\nMeanwhile, the Magic Power circulated along the innate meridians within his body.\nSuddenly, a small breeze whipped through the cave. With the agitation of Magic Power, electric arcs began to crackle across Austin’s Scale-covered exterior. The arcs of electricity sparked in the air, and a palpable, oppressive force filled the air, pervading every corner.\nThe four large spiders also seemed to sense the danger, their limbs restless and agitated as if wanting to retreat and flee, while the surrounding smaller spiders were even more helpless, stopping in their tracks, scurrying around like headless flies.\nThunder Strike Technique!",

      "content": "Chapter 50: 48 Chapters: Escape\nAs the magic power within his body circulated, the air was drawn, and streams of airflow began to swirl upwards. The ionized air loitered in the vacuum, spreading silently and invisibly. The strong electric pressure field generated made the entire cave space suddenly become incredibly terrifying.\nThe spiders, naturally sensitive, sensed danger first, scattering in all directions, while four large spiders also began moving their limbs to retreat.\nBut in the next moment,\nBoom!!!\nThe terrifying current instantly blossomed in the air; the horrific voltage pierced through the atmosphere, transforming into a giant electric snake that cracked and burst in the air. The blinding white light illuminated the entire cave, and streams of electricity leapt up, spreading in all directions as they hit the ground.\nA deafening thunderous sound erupted on the flat ground, ringing in the ears of all present Beastmen, causing the entire cave to almost collapse, with small pebbles falling from above.\nCrack, crack, crack!\nAt the moment the thunder struck down, it divided into hundreds of thousands of thin, wire-like electric arcs, jumping among the entire spider horde, which instantly turned into a sea of electric light.\nThe powerful voltage released intense light and heat in an instant. Under the horrific current, many small spiders were burnt to ashes in an instant, turned to dust. The four large spiders didn’t fare much better either, their bodies dozens of times larger than ordinary spiders attracted even more terrifying lightning. Arm-thick electric snakes wildly danced in the air, through their limbs, instantly charring their entire bodies, filling the cave space with a smell of burnt meat.\n\"Your, Your Highness...\"\nThe Beastmen in the rear had already retreated under Austin’s command to avoid the spread of the Thunder Strike Technique, but the sight of the tens of thousands of spiders and those large spiders being charred and wiped out in an instant still left the Beastmen troops in awe.\nRevering the strong is in the Beastmen’s nature.\nIf the loyalty of the clan’s Beastmen under the Blue Young Dragon had not already been full, this scene would likely enhance any Beastman’s submission considerably.\n\"Quickly tidy up here, bring those four large spiders back, and pay attention to collecting the weeds underground. Leave here as soon as you’re done.\"\nAlthough Austin had wiped out the spider group in one go with the second Talent Magic, deep inside, he felt an unease about the darker depths of the cave. This group of spiders was definitely not the entire strength of the spider colony residing in this underground lair.\nMoreover, the torches in the Beastmen’s hands were about to burn out.\nThus, under Austin’s command, some of the Beastmen quickly searched the ground for the white unnamed weeds growing in the corners, while others went to tidy up the corpses of the large spiders to prepare to carry them back.\nAlthough Austin’s Thunder Strike Technique was powerful, it split into thousands upon thousands of electric arcs upon scattering. As a result, the large spiders were only half-cooked by the current, not charred to cinders. Soon, the Beastmen used several long spears and vines to make a simple rack, wrapping up the four large spiders.\nAnd at this moment, Austin suddenly noticed that when a certain Beastman pulled up the unnamed \"weeds\" in the corner, some stones with a dim glow were exposed beneath the roots in the soil. Despite the dim light, Austin still noticed this peculiar trait.\n\"Wait a minute, take those glowing stones as well.\"\nInitially unnoticed, the next moment the Blue Young Dragon realized.\nIn such an underground cave that hasn’t seen daylight for years, plants could grow, such an anomaly definitely held some divine feature, and these glowing stones were likely one of the reasons why these plants could grow in such dim conditions.\nMoreover, when those stones were unearthed, Austin could clearly perceive that amidst the faint flickering of the stones’ glow, there seemed to be a ripple of magic.\nThus, a group of Beastmen frantically used long spears to dig away the accumulated soil on the ground, searching for those stones emitting a faint glow.\nHowever, just when the Beastmen had dug up around twenty or thirty stones, suddenly dense rustling sounds emerged from the dark depths of the cave, akin to waves of the sea surging and covering.\n\"Not good, retreat immediately!\"\nThe innate sharp perception of the Dragon Race made him feel a prickling sensation at this moment!\nAn overwhelming danger was emanating from the depths of the dark cave.\nAlthough the Beastmen felt inexplicable, they instinctively followed the commands, and a crowd of Beastmen promptly retreated towards the cave entrance.\nAnd at this time, the rustling sounds grew louder, under the faint firelight, as a dark mist surged out from the deep, black cave mouth, spreading in all directions along with a cyan poisonous gas fog.\nSpiders!\nSuper large spiders bigger than the previous four large spiders!\nEach almost the size of Austin, at the same time, several spiders no less formidable than the previous four large spiders began to emerge from the dark, guarding around the super large spider. Counting just the visible ones, there were more than a dozen, and deeper in, who knows how many more remained.\nSimultaneously, ordinary-sized spiders gathered, forming a dense, overwhelming black tide, spreading out from the darkness, covering the ground and steep walls around, swiftly advancing towards the group of Beastmen.\n\"Go!\"\nUnder Austin’s low angry roar, a group of Beastmen sprinted towards the direction of the cave entrance to escape.\nMeanwhile, the Blue Young Dragon stepped hard on the ground, causing the cave to quake, tiny currents cracked from the dragon’s scales, spreading across the ground towards the surroundings, entering the spider swarm, continuously leaping within.\nElectric Shock Paralysis!\nAfter Austin had devoured the Ghost-headed Crocodile Leader and Blood Wolf Leader, the storage of magic power in the Blue Young Dragon increased sharply, greatly enhancing the power of the innate magic technique within, which previously could only release electric shock paralysis during close combat, now could conduct remote attacks through the ground’s conductivity.\nBlocked by the electric current on the ground, the black tide-like spider swarm trembled and halted for a moment.\nBut at this moment, the cyan corrosive venomous fog behind spread out, instantly dissipating the currents. The spider swarm, which was originally stranded, once again quickly surged forward.\nBut luckily, with such an obstruction, the Beastmen had already pulled away a long distance from the spider swarm, and within moments, they had escaped from the cave.\nAnd Austin followed closely behind, darting out as well.",

      "content": "Chapter 51: Chapter 49 Medical\nAfter escaping from the Spider Cave, watching the black tide at the entrance hesitate before the sunlight and finally retreat back into the depths of the cave, all the Beastmen breathed a great sigh of relief.\n\"Form up, check for casualties.\"\nGlancing around at his many Beastman subordinates, he noticed some Beastmen with swollen limbs, seemingly bitten by ordinary-sized spiders during the previous battle with the spider swarm. He immediately gave orders.\nA group of Beastmen quickly organized themselves as they did during training, and two captains began inspecting the Beastmen within the unit.\nThe inspection results came out shortly, revealing that six Beastmen had been bitten. Most of them were in the front row, using torches to fend off and eliminate ordinary spiders, and had been bitten in the chaos by spiders jumping onto their bodies.\nFortunately, it wasn’t serious. With their strong constitutions, the Beastmen were expected to recover quickly after applying some fire cupping.\nMoreover, the gains from this venture into the Spider Cave included the bodies of four large spiders, the unnamed plants collected inside the cave, and those dimly glowing crystals.\nHowever, Austin didn’t plan to inspect these gains in detail here; instead, they would do so back at the Dragon Nest Tribe. With the bodies of those large spiders and the plants growing inside the Spider Cave, they might be able to detoxify Rodney and other poisoned Beastmen.\n\"I will definitely return!\"\nHe glanced deeply again at the Spider Cave, filled with mysterious and unpredictable secrets, then led the Beastmen to turn and leave.\nDeep within this Spider Cave, more terrifying secrets must lie hidden. For the mysterious spiders lurking in the depths of darkness, Austin was currently powerless, but one day, this cave would be leveled by the army of Beastmen he led.\nUpon returning to the tribe, the Blue Young Dragon immediately went to check on Rodney and the other poisoned Beastmen, who were still unconscious. Among them, three Beastmen seemed to be recovering as the toxins were drawn out by the fire cupping.\nHowever, Rodney, and another Jackal Wolf Person, as well as a Kobold team member, were in worse conditions, their bodies turning bluish-purple from the toxins within.\nFor this outcome, the Beastmen within the Dragon Nest Tribe were already quite astonished.\n\"Your Highness, your wisdom is simply as profound as the ocean.\"\nSeeing that a few seemingly doomed individuals were saved alive with the Blue Young Dragon’s methods, even though Lizardman Rodney and others had not yet improved, it didn’t hinder the boundless admiration the Beastmen of the Dragon Nest Village had for Austin.\nIn the past, if any Beastman suffered such injuries, they would be doomed unless a Beastman Priest or a Human Priest intervened. But the Blue Young Dragon used his knowledge and simple tools to salvage three Beastmen from the brink of death. How could this not leave the straightforward Beastmen dumbfounded?\nAustin shook his head, neither confirming nor denying it.\nHolding a different worldview, the Blue Young Dragon considered human resources very important. Even though lighting the Smoke Tower atop a hill continuously attracted wandering Beastmen from the Kawa Great Forest, alleviating the manpower shortage in the Dragon Nest Tribe to some extent, the number of wandering Beastmen was also influenced by the seasons. Moreover, after initially absorbing a large population of wanderers, there were already few nearby. Now, lighting the Smoke Tower every day only occasionally attracted a wanderer or two.\nAccording to Quik, the ability to attract over a hundred wandering Beastmen already was the limit for that enormous Smoke Tower.\nGenerally, smoke pillars produced by regular Beastman tribes could at most attract around twenty to thirty people.\nGiven the recent shortage, the Blue Young Dragon was already considering whether to pause for a while and wait until the next wave of wandering Beastmen before lighting the Smoke Tower to recruit them.\nMoreover, since Lizardman Rodney was the captain of the third team, the poisoned and comatose Beastmen were all strong forces within the Dragon Nest Tribe, and they couldn’t be casually sacrificed.\nAdditionally, the attempt to save Lizardman Rodney and others was also an experiment.\nAn experiment to see if a herb could cure diseases.\nIn this Otherworld Continent, there was no such profession as a doctor. There were only expensive Pharmacists, Priests, and other Extraordinary Professionals.\nBy boldly venturing into the Spider Cave, Austin sought to seize the opportunity to find suitable plants as antidotes, thereby introducing traditional Chinese medicine methods into this world.\nThough neither the Blue Young Dragon in his past life nor from some ancestral family of Chinese medicine, wasn’t everything initially nonexistent before the advent of Chinese medicine? Chinese medicine was shaped through the combination of experience, passed down by predecessors like Shennong tasting hundreds of herbs.\nBefore the industrial revolution in Austin’s previous life, Western treatments primarily relied on bloodletting.\nThat’s why, for a considerable time while recruiting followers later, various Chinese medicine methods remained the primary treatment within the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThe Blue Young Dragon already decided that if those unnamed plants proved effective, it would mean herbal treatment was viable. Then, he would specially instruct people to record treatment methods for injuries, fall damage, and various herbal effects to cultivate one or two doctors for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nRecently, with the tribe’s growing population, many Beastmen accidentally injured during work hurt their limbs. Although their strong constitutions allowed them to recover within a few days, it was not a sustainable approach in the long run.\nFor a tribe of over a hundred people, it was time to consolidate some treatment methods to cultivate one or two doctors.\nAfter all, Extraordinary Professionals remained elevated above the common people. Those healing potions, Divine Healing, and so forth could only be measured in gleaming Gold Coins. Even if Austin became stronger in the future and had subordinates capable of performing Beastman Priest duties, it would be unrealistic for a Beastman Priest to treat every Beastman in a large tribe. Herbal treatments for the common people could more widely benefit Austin’s followers.\nWith Austin clueless about the traditional Chinese medicine system, rebuilding that system from scratch in this Otherworld was no easy task and would require gradual cultivation.\nTherefore, while the Blue Young Dragon worked to help Lizardman Rodney and others by exploring the Spider Cave, the poor, unconscious Lizardman Rodney and the others inadvertently became guinea pigs.\nFinding a theoretical antidote from the Spider Cave was one thing, but administering it to Lizardman Rodney and the other patients was yet another issue to solve.",

      "content": "Chapter 52: Chapter 50 Leg of Lamb\nHow to use it as medicine, and the dosage—whether to swallow it raw, press it into juice, dry it and boil it into a medicinal soup, or directly inject it into the veins—is something that Austin, who is essentially illiterate in traditional Chinese medicine, has no idea about.\nEven though, theoretically, these plants can grow inside the Spider Cave and have a high chance of neutralizing the poison produced by the spiders, figuring out how to enable those substances to work in Rodney and others’ bodies without harming them is indeed a profound and complex field of study.\nHowever, under the current circumstances, there is no way for Austin to spend a year or two exploring this; otherwise, Rodney’s grave would probably have grass several meters high by then, and even if he managed to gather experience, what use would it be?\nThere’s no choice but to take measures one by one.\nFirst, for Rodney, with the strongest physique, they directly took a nameless plant from the Spider Cave, ground it into a mass, and fed it directly into his mouth.\nAs for the Jackal Wolf People, with a slightly weaker body, the amount was also a whole plant, pressed into juice to feed them.\nLastly, for the Kobold, it was boiled into a medicinal soup to feed them.\nWhether these nameless plants growing in the Spider Cave were toxic or could resolve the spider poison in Rodney and others, or whether they would make things worse, no one knew. Ultimately, it was left to fate.\nAll the beastmen and the Blue Young Dragon stood by the bedside, waiting patiently. Would a miracle occur, or was it all in vain? Nobody knew.\nAn hour passed.\nThe purple-blue hue on Rodney’s face began to fade, but soon his entire lizard face turned a mix of blue and red in a short time, with the colors changing very strangely.\nThe complexion of the Jackal Wolf People also quickly dissipated, although they didn’t experience Rodney’s situation. However, their breathing became rapid, which seemed to suggest that the spider venom inside them had been resolved, although it also produced some unknown side effects.\nFinally, for the Kobold, the blue-purple hue on his face slowly started to fade. Although not as quickly as the Jackal Wolf People, at least more than half had dissipated, without any side effects like Rodney’s or those of the Jackal Wolf People, and his breathing became stabilised.\n\"It worked!\"\nAt the moment of witnessing these \"weeds\" taking effect, all the beastmen erupted into enthusiastic cheers.\nEven though Rodney and the others hadn’t woken up yet, it was apparent, under such circumstances, that the spider poison in their bodies could be resolved.\nThe cheers were deafening as all the beastmen loudly exclaimed phrases like \"Long live His Highness Austin.\"\n\"Your, Your Highness... this is truly...\"\nThroughout the event, the Fox-faced Man Quik stood by, so moved by the scene that words failed him.\nHowever, the Blue Young Dragon wasn’t blinded by the joy. Under his command, approximately three to four hours later, the beastmen brewed individual bowls of medicine from the nameless plants extracted from the Spider Cave and fed them to Rodney and the others.\nFrom the analysis of the three cases, although the effects of brewed herbs were slower, the side effects were not as severe.\nMeanwhile, the beastmen who were previously bitten by spiders also each received a bowl of medicine. For those whose injuries weren’t severe, just a single bowl almost instantaneously cured them, as the swelling quickly dissipated, indicating that the toxin was easily resolved.\nThis further boosted Austin and the others’ confidence. With careful care, Rodney and the others finally awoke the next day.\nThough having narrowly survived the ordeal of Ghost Gate, Rodney and the others would take more than ten to twenty days to fully recover, but the danger to their lives was entirely gone.\nOn the evening Rodney and the others were cured, the beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe held another celebration.\nWithout wine, they used juice from fruits similar to coconuts as a substitute, and with the recent victories in hunting, large quantities of fish and meat were served, allowing everyone to eat joyfully.\nPerhaps celebrating Rodney and the others being saved by the Blue Young Dragon, or celebrating the recent hunting bounties, or perhaps welcoming newcomers, but whatever the reason, this was the beastmen’s most enjoyable gathering.\nThe wandering beastmen who later joined the Dragon Nest Tribe, even after military training, still felt a slight gap with the older members of the Dragon Nest Tribe, but after this grand feast, that trace of separation vanished, and they fully integrated.\nOf course, Austin did not prevent this celebration from happening, as there was a need to occasionally relax, but he didn’t participate.\nRather than join the beastmen in their revelry, Austin preferred to stay quietly in the nest, looking down at the brightly lit Dragon Nest Village below.\nAlthough the glow in that area seemed insignificant amidst the endless dark forest, like a tiny spark in a vast dark prairie,\nAustin believed that one day, that spark would grow into a prairie fire, and the bright lights would illuminate this dark land, blossoming with brilliance under the night sky.\nAnd when that time came, he would stand at the highest point, his enormous membranous wings shrouding the sky, casting a shadow that covered the sun, looking down at the empire that belonged to him:\n\"This is my empire!\"\nOf course, the Blue Young Dragon’s utopian fantasies did not last long before the peace of the nest was broken by a little girl named Nina, who discovered during the feast that her most revered His Highness Austin was not amongst the crowd. She then tottered forward with her most cherished lamb leg to present it to the most esteemed Blue Young Dragon and to convey all the beastmen’s esteemed greetings to Austin.\nWatching little Nina hold up that roasted lamb leg, the Blue Young Dragon raised his head proudly, snorting coldly.\n\"Hmph, foolish beastmen, how could you understand the pride of a king like me?\"\nThen Austin gulped down the lamb leg, bone and all, and licked his lips,\nThe taste lingered.\nHe hadn’t eaten such delicious food in a long time. Thinking back to when he was clumsy, he even struggled to start a fire, let alone do anything else.\nAnd those beastmen were also clumsy and rough, and what they made was only barely edible.\nThen by chance, Austin noticed Nina had some cooking talent and gave her a few pointers. In truth, those pointers were learned from some culinary videos Austin watched in his previous life, and to his surprise, little Nina could actually make roasted lamb leg.\nThough the lack of salt was mildly unsatisfying, the taste was fragrant,\nCrispy,\nLetting Austin, who had gotten used to eating raw or charred prey since coming to this world, relish the aftertaste.\nA night passed in the blink of an eye,\nThe next day dawned with the rising sun, marking the start of a new day.\nRodney and the other three teams were still recuperating, but no longer needed much attention. At this time, the kudzu vines in the wild had started to sprout, and it was time for planting Pueraria.\nThus, Austin led the beastmen to the plains by the river to continue with his grand plan of land-reclamation farming.",

      "content": "Chapter 53: Chapter 51 Planting\nSince it is possible to use the nameless plants within the Spider Cave to treat the severe spider poison Rodney and others are suffering from, it suggests that using herbal remedies for detoxification and treatment is viable. This indicates that Austin’s Chinese medicine treatment methods from his previous life also hold some relevance in this world.\nIf the medicinal properties and habits of various wild herbs known to the Beastmen can be gathered and personally sampled, and if the folk remedies mastered by some Beastman Tribes can be compiled and systematically organized to establish a medical system akin to Chinese medicine, it would greatly benefit the development of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nHowever, Austin, who finds the laborious task of establishing an Otherworld version of a medical system cumbersome, has left it to Quik, the Fox-faced Man, who has a keen interest in it.\nThis is a very complex grand project, so Austin only offers a word or two from the sidelines, sharing some occasional Chinese medicine theories from his previous life with Quik, and gives him guidance on how to set up this medical system.\nThe Blue Young Dragon has no intention of personally dedicating significant time to building this medical system.\nSubsequently, Quik began visiting every Beastman in the Dragon Nest Tribe, asking them about their experiences with ailments. For instance, what herbs they used when their hands or feet were injured, what the Tribal Elders had them eat when they suffered abdominal pain, what herbs they applied when bitten by prey, and what remedies helped them recover from headaches and chills.\nBeastmen have been breeding and thriving in the Kawa Great Forest for thousands of years, through various chances or necessities, some tribes have discovered quirky folk remedies. Of course, only two or three out of ten remedies are actually effective, and they require systematic sorting before becoming truly robust.\nThe establishment of a medical system cannot be rushed. After delegating the task to Quik, Austin continues his grand venture of cultivation and reclamation with a group of Beastmen.\nEarlier, a portion of the river plains had already been developed; although Rodney’s situation later occupied Austin’s focus, the elite troops from the Dragon Nest Tribe, led by the Blue Young Dragon, continued working on the land cultivation tasks left by Austin while also guarding the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nWhen the Blue Young Dragon returned to the river plains, the twenty-acre field had already been thoroughly turned by the Beastmen using tools like wooden shovels and sticks, exposing the underlying soil.\nBut this does not mean planting can begin; turning over this vast land is only the first step.\nThe purpose of soil tillage is to loosen the ground unchanged for centuries, allowing oxygen to enter and aiding root oxygen absorption when planting yams, thereby increasing yam yield.\nThe second step is to level the soil, smoothing the loosened land into flat terrain.\nThis arable land is called a plain, but in reality, it is uneven, with dips here and mounds there, easily flooded in low areas during heavy rains, while high areas don’t retain water well, significantly impacting yam cultivation.\nThe best approach is to divide the twenty acres of arable land, with high areas and low areas separated like terraced fields, ensuring yield and reducing the Beastmen’s work load drastically.\nHowever, doing so requires meticulous planning. The Beastmen are careless and may not execute these precision divisions well. Moreover, Beastmen have significantly better physical stamina compared to humans, so increasing their workload isn’t problematic.\nThus, under the Blue Young Dragon’s command, the Beastmen worked relentlessly.\nThey leveled the high areas, filling the low-lying zones with soil.\nDespite the efforts of the Beastmen and given that the river plain terrain isn’t overly uneven, it still required dozens of Beastmen working together for a whole day to consolidate the arable wilderness into a twenty-acre flatland.\nAt a glance, the entire wildland had been completely leveled into a smooth terrain; despite some inconvenient wooden stakes left behind, the arable land had indeed been preliminarily arranged.\nBut it was not yet time to plant yams.\nDue to the influence of magic tides, the Kawa Great Forest is hot and rainy nine months of the year, akin to Tropical Rainforest climate.\nIf yams are planted directly on this reclaimed flatland, the area often becomes muddy, and during downpours the entire field is soaked.\nYams typically grow on higher terrains like mountains, which are relatively dry lands, indicating yams dislike waterlogged muddy areas; prolonged water immersion could severely affect yam output.\nTherefore, the third step is to create ridges on this arable land.\nRidges provide yams with more sunlight exposure, enhancing photosynthetic efficiency, improve soil permeability promoting root growth, and most importantly simplify irrigation management versus flat bed cultivation.\nDuring downpours, rainwater automatically channels down ridge furrows and drains out, unlike flatlands where large water deposits hinder yam production.\nInitially, Austin thought creating ridges was the simplest step.\nYet, he didn’t anticipate the Beastmen had grass growing in their brains instead of brains.\nWhile digging ridges, they skewed off course after three steps, and two Beastmen even dug into each other’s paths.\nSeeing the skewed and unusable initial ridge furrows, Austin almost jumped with anger.\nIn the end, the Blue Young Dragon used vine-made ropes to draw a straight line from end to end directing the Beastmen in one direction, marking a path to prevent skewing during ridge formation.\nOver three busy days, preparation for planting yams was finally complete, with rows of ridge fields neatly aligned.\nThe final step was planting yams.\nAccording to yam growth methods, options include cuttings, root heads, layers, and seeds. In this Otherworld, Austin was not particular, using cuttings to plant, slicing thick yam vines, removing the leaves, directly planting them on ridges, and watering them.\nIn his previous life, planting yams required attention to many details, but the Blue Young Dragon was not omniscient and didn’t expect the transplants to yield high returns. As long as yam production is achieved, it was deemed successful.",

      "content": "Chapter 54: Chapter 52: Experimental Field\nLooking at the large expanse of newly cultivated land where the vines had just been planted, Austin’s heart was filled with a sense of satisfaction. From nothing to something, overcoming numerous difficulties to accumulate this foundation.\nSoon, this foundation will usher in a new era.\nIf the planting can succeed, it will basically solve the food problem for the beastmen. Only then can the population under the Blue Young Dragon’s command rapidly expand to form a formidable force.\nInitially, the beastmen didn’t understand why Austin was cultivating this land. They only obeyed because of the unparalleled prestige of the Blue Young Dragon. Later, when the Blue Young Dragon said that completing this task would solve the beastmen’s food problem, the enthusiasm of the beastmen was immediately ignited. However, they still found what the Blue Young Dragon was doing quite inexplicable.\nUntil now, seeing all the work Austin had done, planting the vines in the furrows, the smarter beastmen had already guessed what Austin intended to do.\nThe Kawa Great Forest is not completely closed off. At the turn of the cold winter, large numbers of beastmen always surge out of the forest borders to breach the Iron Wall Defense Line set by the humans and raid human food supplies.\nThe beastmen have some understanding of how humans manage to survive without hunting in the forests, and that’s because humans know how to farm.\nAs Austin would say, farming allows humans to sustain a large portion of their population with limited land.\nThe beastmen of the Kawa Great Forest had tried planting in the past, too.\nHowever, their planting methods were very crude. For example, they would directly cast rice seeds onto the grasslands, leading to the seeds being completely devoured by birds and rats, or perhaps barely sprouting only to have all the nutrients sapped by the lush grass, leaving just a couple of scrawny stalks to mature and bear fruit, eventually yielding less than the original seeds.\nThe same went for other crops. The beastmen had no concept of land preparation, nor did they consider the environment, indiscriminately scattering seeds in the wild. As a result, the yields never matched the effort, and naturally, the beastmen of the Kawa Great Forest lost the inclination to farm.\nOf course, in this vast and endless Kawa Great Forest, anything can happen. There may be exceptions where some tribes accidentally discover suitable land for planting appropriate crops, obtaining considerable harvests annually, but such lucky instances are extremely rare. Compared to the countless tribes in the Kawa Great Forest, the fortunate ones are one in a million.\nWithout related farming knowledge and given the simple-minded nature of the beastmen, developing agriculture naturally yielded no results.\nTherefore, seeing what Austin was doing and realizing his goal, the beastmen, though surprised, were also filled with immense expectation.\nEven the simple-minded beastmen could see the difference between Austin’s farming method and the bold techniques used by other beastman tribes.\nPerhaps, His Highness Blue Dragon could succeed.\nNo, His Highness Austin is bound to succeed!\nThe various experiences over time, coupled with political brainwashing, had led all the beastmen to develop absolute trust in Austin.\nSubsequently, the development of events did not disappoint the beastmen’s expectations.\nAfter the planting was completed, the heavens were kind enough to bring several showers. In the ensuing two days, sprouts emerged from the buried vines, as spots of tender green dotted the yellow earth, giving the fields an exceptionally vibrant and lively look.\nThis surprised the Blue Young Dragon, as compared to his past life, where it was impossible for planted vines to sprout so quickly in just two days. But perhaps due to a different world or species, the results differed.\nIn any case, by the third day after the vines were planted, the shoots had indeed emerged.\nThis growth opened a promising Chapter for Austin’s farming endeavor.\nFor the time being, there was basically no need for management until the new vines were substantial enough to climb up the branches.\nNext, Austin didn’t let the beastmen idly wait but sought another plain to continue clearing the land.\nAustin chose not to clear the previous plain further, considering that excessive tree felling in such a rain-abundant world could easily lead to soil erosion.\nTherefore, to avoid complications, Austin decided to start clearing another piece of land about twenty meters away from the original field.\nEven though the first field hadn’t yielded crops yet, the sight of sprouting vines had all the participating beastmen filled with passion, diving eagerly into the next clearing task.\nWith the experience from the first field, the beastmen’s work efficiency significantly improved.\nThey coordinated seamlessly, cutting down and dragging away trees, pulling up weeds from the ground and burning them on the remaining stumps, with ash left for the base of the ridges as fertilizer.\nThen they used wooden spades to turn over the hard soil, leveling the ground, making ridges, and planting anew.\nThe clearing of the second piece of land no longer required Austin’s direct supervision. Except for occasionally checking the progress and offering guidance, the work was mostly left to the beastmen to organize. With the first round of planting experience, the work wouldn’t falter.\nAs some beastmen busily worked on the second field, Austin led another group to traverse the Blue Dragon’s territory within a ten-mile radius.\nApart from the unexplored Spider Cave, the Blue Young Dragon didn’t discover any other places where extraordinary magical beasts gathered.\nOf course, Austin’s main goal wasn’t to find another place like the Spider Cave but to locate the growth areas of wild rice.\nAlthough the first plant chosen for cultivation was the kudzu root, it didn’t mean Austin wouldn’t plant other grains.\nPreviously, due to various reasons, the Blue Young Dragon had abandoned the idea of planting wild rice in the first field, but he hadn’t entirely given up on cultivating it as a crop.\nAfter all, if agricultural planting succeeds in the future, grains will yield much more than kudzu root.\nFor security and compatibility with the growth habits of rice, Austin decided to directly sow these grain plants in areas where rice naturally grew.\nAfter three days of exploration, under the guidance of the beastmen, Austin discovered more than a dozen low wetlands with wild rice growing.\nThe Blue Young Dragon decided to select the three ponds nearest to Dragon Nest Village as experimental fields.\nOf course, compared to the multiple steps like seedling cultivation from the past life, Austin’s planting technique was much simpler and more straightforward.\nHe instructed the beastmen to clear all the weeds from the ponds, turn over the muddy soil once, and then directly cast the wild rice seeds.\nIn the future, during large-scale wild rice planting, the method of seedling cultivation might be employed, but for now, it was merely an experimental field, also serving to record the growth patterns of wild rice.\nBy the time the first cultivated field matures enough to plant these wild rice, at least a year would have passed.\nThey directly sowed the seeds, burying them in the mud, ensuring they wouldn’t be taken by birds, thus completing the wild rice experimental fields. All that remained was to wait for the future growth and harvest.",

      "content": "Chapter 55: Chapter 53: The Strength Issue of Beastmen\nAfter getting through the most difficult initial stage, the remaining matters of cultivating the new land were naturally left to the experienced beastmen. Starting is always the hardest part, but once the beginning is done well, further cultivation does not require the Blue Young Dragon’s constant supervision.\nCultivation, after all, is not an overnight endeavor. The true success of this effort can only be measured in a few months when the harvest from the fields reveals itself.\nHowever, Austin has about eighty percent confidence that the cultivated kudzu will yield a bountiful harvest.\nCompared to the wild kudzu vines outside, the kudzu on the cultivated fields not only receives specialized care but is also planted with wood ash. Additionally, the manure produced by the toilets that Austin ordered to be built in Dragon Nest Village during the cold winter helps boost the soil’s fertility, ensuring the upcoming harvest will far exceed that of the wild-growing kudzu.\nAs for the experimental fields of wild rice, they are basically left to the whims of nature.\nAgricultural matters were directly handed over to the beastman militia. Austin only occasionally checked on the growth of grain plants, offering pointers on the cultivation process.\nSince these subordinate beastman clans had all gone through military training, they were far more organized and disciplined than any other beastman tribe outside. This was highly beneficial for the development of the cultivation work.\nFortunately, Austin foresaw this, transforming all the beastmen with military training before the wandering beastmen joined Dragon Nest Village. Otherwise, a group of lazy and disorganized wandering beastmen would never be able to complete such a demanding task as cultivation, even with Austin’s orders.\nThis also gave Austin an insight, explaining why the great tribes never developed agriculture. Without discipline and unified command among a chaotic swarm of beastmen, cooperative work is out of the question.\nThis realization also clarified some things for the Blue Young Dragon, such as why, despite the Dragon Race possessing such gifted abilities, no truly impressive Dragon Empire has ever emerged. Though they gather numerous clans, they wield only temporary might, fading quickly after their peak.\nThe reason for this likely lies in a lack of order among the various races within the subordinate clans.\nThough the Dragon Race’s power can exponentially expand the clans’ forces, even wield the power to destroy nations, over time, the disorderly clans fail to sustain themselves. Conflicts and disputes among them grow, eventually leading to inevitable collapse.\nOrder is crucial for a clan.\nUnder Austin’s policies, the current Dragon Nest Tribe has nearly become a community where everyone is a soldier, united through training, merging civilians and military.\nThis highly centralized military state system can unleash extraordinarily powerful strength.\nIn terms of productivity, the current hundred-member Dragon Nest Tribe is likely comparable to some beastman tribes with a thousand members, perhaps even surpassing them.\n\"Military training must continue in the future.\"\nThis world has no such concept as human rights; the least valuable thing here is human life. Whether it’s among the beastmen at the bottom of this Barbaric Continent or the poor in the Human World, Austin is no saint. Those who need to be exploited will be exploited. Since I provide you with the benefit of a full stomach, you must be prepared to pay with your life.\n...\nAssigning the cultivation work to the beastmen under his command doesn’t mean Austin has nothing to do.\nCurrently, he’s contemplating another issue: the combat strength of the beastmen in his clan.\nIn fact, before deciding to develop the clan’s forces, Austin was already prepared for the fact that the beastman clan wouldn’t be of much help to him in the short term.\nIn the current state of the Blue Young Dragon, even if the beastman clan trained to elite levels, they couldn’t pose any threat to him. Wooden spears could not penetrate his highly defensive scale armor.\nThis is due to the vast gap between individual strengths. In the previous two battles, the beastmen were able to help Austin deal with ordinary Ghost-headed Crocodiles and ordinary Blood Wolves, but as Austin grew stronger, the beastmen’s powers lagged behind him.\nThrough two transformations, Austin awakened a second highly offensive talent magic, and his body grew significantly, with his scales providing even greater defense.\nIf he were to face the same Blood Wolves from the cold winter now, he alone could handle them completely.\nAustin understands this clearly and is mentally prepared for it.\nUntil the Dragon Nest Division of the beastman civilization starts using firearms and other weapons, or Extraordinary Professionals appear, Austin will play a major role in Dragon Nest Division’s combat strength.\nOnly when the beastman clan grows to a certain scale will they be able to support Austin’s growth and security.\nEven so, this doesn’t mean Austin will be indifferent to the beastman’s prowess reaching a bottleneck.\nIn the battle at Spider Cave, aside from Austin, his subordinate beastmen had no ability to counterattack and were routed miserably by the spiders.\nAfterward, Austin’s desire to enhance the beastmen’s prowess under him grew even stronger.\nCurrently, there are two ways to enhance the beastmen’s power.\nThe first is to comprehensively upgrade their equipment, replacing their wooden spears with copper and iron weaponry to significantly boost their weapons’ power.\nThe second is to lead the beastmen onto the supernatural path, making them Extraordinary Professionals to enhance their inherent strength.\nDuring the cold winter, Austin explored nearby areas from the sky and discovered a place with buried copper ore. However, a group of Jackal Wolf People gathered in the nearby mountains.\nAccording to Rodney, the leader of that Jackal Wolfman Tribe is a Bronze Level Extraordinary Professional, possessing immense power. Though Austin isn’t afraid now, recent intelligence reveals that the Jackal Wolfman Tribe has mysteriously increased by over two hundred, bringing their total population close to five hundred.\nThis made Austin decide to temporarily hold off on the idea of annexing the Jackal Wolfman Tribe. At least until the kudzu vines are harvested, he doesn’t plan to take action against that tribe. Apart from the potential damage from attacking the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, even if victorious, the surge in population would pose a significant issue for food supply.\nHence, if Austin wishes to quickly strengthen the beastman clan’s prowess, he has to consider other options.\nThe second path, therefore, is figuring out how to help these ordinary beastmen awaken the Extraordinary Seed, stepping onto the path of Extraordinary Professional.",

      "content": "Chapter 56: Chapter 54 Electric Current Stimulation\nHowever, awakening the extraordinary path for the beastmen is extremely challenging, especially for these lower-level beastmen under Austin. Their talents are only slightly better than humans and are immeasurably inferior to those born with extraordinary traits.\nIn the inherited memories of Austin’s Dragon Race, he knows that there are indeed methods among the human nations on the civilized land that enable ordinary mortals to become professionals like Warrior Mages, but unfortunately, his inherited memories contain no specifics.\nThis is unsurprising, as elder dragons, being naturally gifted, are almost destined to become legendary beings after living for a few hundred years, so there’s no need for human methods to achieve extraordinariness.\nEven though Austin’s clan of Beastmen has now surpassed a hundred, none of them knows how to embark on the extraordinary path.\nQuik, however, knows some common knowledge, such as Austin initially thinking that warrior professionals cultivated techniques like cultivation techniques and fighting qi. It was only through Quik’s explanations that he learned there weren’t any cultivation techniques in this world.\nNo matter what one cultivates, breathing techniques are core, combined with various magic potions to stimulate the body and awaken fighting qi, and then step by step cultivate to Silver, Gold, and even Legendary levels.\nAlthough this breathing technique also has levels like Bronze, Silver, and Gold, Austin’s original anticipation of a systematic technique doesn’t exist.\nThe cultivation of a Mage is similar, relying on meditation techniques to enhance spiritual power, imprinting various spell marks to cast magic, and using continuous meditation to enhance oneself to the point of reaching levels like Silver and Gold.\nAs for extraordinary beings among the beastman race, one is either naturally born as extraordinary beings like the Behemoth, not needing to cross the threshold to attain extraordinary abilities, or also gains breathing techniques to advance their life level.\nThis prompted Austin to be more curious about a nearby Jackal Wolfman Tribe, which has nearly tripled its population in a short period, raising questions about how their leader acquired breathing techniques.\nOf course, outside of formal breathing techniques, there’s another more unconventional method for ordinary beastmen to embark on the path of extraordinary professionals.\nThat is through transformation and mutation by powerful extraordinary beings.\nIn human civilizations, within the Mage system, there’s a small branch called Wizards.\nWizards specialize in bloodline extraction and creature transformation as an unconventional Mage system.\nIt’s said that powerful Wizards can even extract the Giant Dragon bloodline from dragons, integrating it into humans to create the terrifying Dragon Blood Warriors. With sufficient magic resources, these warriors can even rapidly ascend to the realm of Legends.\nAnd these Wizards are currently Austin’s most terrifying enemies. Should any Wizards learn of an orphaned young dragon’s existence here, evil and mad Wizards would undoubtedly come to make Austin a specimen, extracting his bloodline, making potions from his flesh, leaving even his bones to be exploited, unless Austin escapes upfront to prevent certain death.\nBeyond Wizards, there are other powerful extraordinary lifeforms capable of transforming humans onto the extraordinary path, such as the Giant Dragon Race.\nActually, in Austin’s inherited memories, Dragon Balls can bestow power upon a clan, transforming them, like how Kobold casters receive bloodline power from a giant dragon, thus becoming extraordinary ability users.\nAnd Austin himself is a member of the Giant Dragon Race.\nBut for specific methods, Austin’s inherited memories contain no information, leaving him at a loss.\nIn those inherited memories, those who can accomplish such feats are usually adult giant dragons, leading Austin to speculate whether this ability awakens as a growth-related talent among the dragons.\nHowever, this transformation ability remains the only promising hope for Austin in the near future to lead his beastman underlings towards the path of extraordinary ability users.\nPerhaps this power to transform and bestow abilities is a giant dragon’s inherent privilege?\nOverall, Austin won’t give up without even attempting. Although lacking knowledge about transforming and empowering beastmen, Austin has a hunch.\nWhen acquiring his first talent magic, Austin sparked his imagination, using electricity generated by magic to stimulate himself to enhance his physical condition.\nIn his previous world, electric stimulation would only provide a numb thrill without any substantial effect.\nBut this is the Otherworld, and Austin is of the Giant Dragon Race; the electric stimulation significantly strengthened his physique, making his current size exceed that of young dragons of the same age.\nAlthough the principle is unknown, the electric stimulation indeed proves beneficial.\nIf electric stimulation benefits Dragon Race, would it work for his clan of beastmen? This question occurred to Austin recently.\nBlue Young Dragon didn’t know the answer, but he intended to experiment to verify his hypothesis.\nIf the Dragon Race’s power to bestow clan abilities stems from the Giant Dragon bloodline’s natural privilege, perhaps radiation from self-generated electricity could alter the beastmen’s life level, thereby enhancing their combat capabilities!\nWith this thought, Austin began experiments, selecting strong beastmen from his Dragon Nest Division as subjects, including Goblins, Kobolds, and Jackal Wolf People alike. Each species was partially chosen for experimentation, regularly visiting the Dragon’s Nest to receive electric stimulation from Austin’s talent magic.\nAs Austin’s first talent magic, the electric stimulation now allows control over the intensity by adjusting the magic power output, ensuring that these \"lucky\" experimental beastmen face no mortal danger; they merely lie paralyzed after the shock, smelling like cooked meat with fur standing, immobilized for several days.\nThis sudden notion of Austin’s led several beastmen through an intoxicating yet torturous life for the following half-month.\nTo pinpoint variables and effects, these experimental beastmen endured various bizarre experiments, causing them excruciating pain in their role as subjects.\nHalf a month later, inside the Dragon’s Nest.\n\"Why is this?\"\nAfter more than ten days of experiments, Austin, having embodied a mad scientist, fell into deep contemplation.\nOutcomes appear: after a few electric numbness treatments, the stimulated beastmen displayed slight improvements in speed, strength, and other physical abilities, with their food intake increasing as well.\nWhile Austin doesn’t understand why, he’s aware that his generated electricity seems undeniably beneficial.\nHowever, when Austin ceased the electric shocks, these somewhat enhanced beastmen regressed within days, appearing spiritually exhausted, making Austin halt the beastman transformation project for the entire tribe.\nExperiments demonstrated that Austin indeed possesses the ability to transform beastmen, yet without addressing this issue, the beastman extraordinary plan is an impractical discussion.",

      "content": "Chapter 57: Chapter 55 Development\nWhile Austin was engrossed in his transformation experiments, the development of the Dragon Nest Tribe did not halt.\nAt this time, the Dragon Nest Tribe had already entered a normal developmental track. Several new houses were built in the village, and the surrounding weeds were cleared. Many stone tools in the process of being made were placed on the open ground, with a designated area for spear weapons nearby.\nThis was considered the workshop for making various weapon stone tools. The land reclamation project was ongoing. As there were currently no copper or iron tools, the daily consumption of various stone tools and wooden spears by the Beastmen for land reclamation was quite a large number. To improve efficiency, the Kobold leader Vini, under Austin’s guidance, selected six or seven Goblins with skilled craftsmanship from the Dragon Nest Tribe to specialize in making wooden spears and stone tools.\nOne must admit, this division of labor significantly improved the production efficiency of the Beastmen. These Goblins seemed to possess a manufacturing talent, even replicating some tools to expedite wooden spear manufacturing from Austin’s occasional hints, using wooden shafts to rotate grinding stones and speed up the sharpening of wooden spears.\nRecently, these Goblins gathered to attempt whether they could fire pottery from clay to facilitate the Dragon Nest Tribe’s various daily activities. Through several firing experiments, these Goblins drew inspiration from Austin’s Smoke Tower design and devised a rudimentary blast furnace. Although it had not yet succeeded, the Goblins said they were close and would soon be able to supply the tribe with various pottery utensils.\nBeing able to successfully fire pottery utensils would indeed greatly facilitate the Dragon Nest Tribe’s various daily activities.\nThe expansion of the village did not stop during this half-month period.\nThe walls surrounding the village were further reinforced, relying on the Dragon’s Nest Cliff at the back, with only one main entrance for entry and exit.\nA short lookout tower was erected on each side of the main entrance, with two Beastmen guarding each side regularly. Although wild animals near the Dragon Nest Territory had reduced to quite a low level due to the prior collective hunting, necessary precautions still had to be taken.\nThe population of the Dragon Nest Tribe had reached one hundred and twenty-three people. Not long ago, they even attracted two stray Minotaurs who joined the Dragon Nest Tribe, though the Smoke Tower side was no longer attracting stray Beastmen.\nOver a month had passed since the cold winter, and the plants had fully grown lush leaves. The entire Kawa Great Forest entered its most prosperous period. Beastmen generally could find enough food within the Kawa Great Forest; having settled down, the number of stray Beastmen in the Kawa Great Forest had decreased to a very low level.\nMoreover, the Smoke Tower side had produced enough charcoal for firing forty to fifty furnaces of copper and iron without issues. The trees on nearby hills were mostly cut down, and lighting smoke columns required heavy manpower, so the Smoke Tower was halted.\nWithout worrying about tending to the smoke columns, a portion of manpower was freed, slightly accelerating the land reclamation work.\nEarly in the morning.\nAfter completing the morning routine training, the Beastmen grouped into formations under their respective captains, who received today’s tasks from the Dragon Nest Tribe Village Chief Vini, whether hunting, fishing, gathering vines, searching for stone tool materials, making wooden spear wood, weaving nets, land clearing, etc.\nWith the day’s schedule laid out, there was hardly any idle time for the Beastmen.\nWhile the captains received tasks, the Beastmen relaxed nearby, chatting and bickering.\n\"I really envy Rodney and those guys—they don’t have to work or do military training, just lie down and get fed every day.\"\n\"Ha ha, if you want, you can go too. Anyway, you don’t have to do anything, just lie there for a few days without working, and after the experiments, you can get stronger—how great is that!\"\nAustin didn’t hide the fact that he used Beastmen as test subjects—news of it spread early in the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nOf course, with daily brainwashing propaganda and the \"generous\" life of having enough to eat, these clan members wouldn’t have complaints even if they sacrificed their lives for Austin.\nAfter all, this world didn’t really have any concept of human rights, especially for Beastmen who lived day to day. Sacrificing themselves for the revered Blue Dragon was their honor.\nHowever, the Blue Young Dragon’s experiments didn’t take their lives, but the experience wasn’t pleasant. The electric stimulation was something ordinary Beastmen couldn’t endure, especially when one day they saw Rodney emerge from the lab twitching, incontinent.\nSaying they envied them was just banter.\n\"I’ve heard that if His Highness’s experiment succeeds, we will all gain extraordinary power.\"\n\"Extraordinary power, huh? It used to be that only leaders and elites could possess that power in our tribe.\"\nIn conversation, some Beastmen showed longing expressions.\nLiving in a place where the strong prey on the weak, the desire for power was an instinct for every creature.\n\"Gather and deploy!\"\nNot long after, the captains, having received tasks from Vini, returned, shouting orders.\nThe Beastmen stood up one by one, approaching their own captains to form ranks, and then dispersed in various directions within the Dragon Nest Territory under their captain’s lead.\n\"Brother, if His Highness succeeds, will we also get extraordinary abilities?\"\nIn a small group, Aisha asked her brother walking upfront.\nThis small group consisted of juvenile Beastmen from the Dragon Nest Tribe. They handled tasks that were manageable for them, as not all tribal duties were suitable for these young ones.\nAisha and her brother Meng Bi were among this group, tasked with clearing the field for planting kudzu root. After half a month of growth, the vines had sprouted thick tendrils. To increase sunlight exposure, Austin ordered branches to be cut and inserted into the ridges for the vines to climb and increase sun time.\nWorks demanding physical strength were generally handled by adult Beastmen, while these young Beastmen attended to these kudzu vines, handling tasks like weeding.\n\"This is an experiment personally overseen by His Highness Austin—of course, it will succeed. His Highness Austin is a mighty Giant Dragon; how could it not succeed?\"\nMeng Bi patted his sister’s head and said.\n\"Then can I fly in the future?\"\n\"Mm, you definitely can.\"\nAmongst the chatter of a group of young Beastmen, the team soon arrived at a green expanse.",

      "content": "Chapter 58: Chapter 56 Education\nPerhaps due to the differences in species in the Otherworld, after half a month of growth, the kudzu vine in the first plot of reclaimed land has become very lush. Rows of branches are inserted into the ridge ground, and the surrounding vines climb over them to gain more sunlight, looking lush and emerald green. From a distance, they resemble rows of trees one or two meters high.\nUnder the care of the beastmen, even though these kudzu vines originate from wild kudzu roots in the wild, their growth and other traits are much stronger than those in the wild.\nDuring the initial reclamation, weeds and various leaves and branches on the ground were burned into ash and used as fertilizer when the kudzu roots were planted.\nDuring the cold winter season, Austin ordered the beastmen to build toilets and set up a small biogas fermentation pool next to them. In the hot climate of the Kawa Great Forest, the beastmen’s manure ferments very quickly, turning into excellent fertilizer in just over ten days. Although the biogas could not be utilized, the remaining fertilizer played a significant role in the reclaimed fields.\nFor the first reclaimed field of about twenty acres, the originally gray-brown soil has started showing signs of turning black, which is a sign of increasing soil fertility.\nPerhaps after planting kudzu for one or two years, it will be possible to plant wild rice.\n\"You, you, and you, pull the weeds from these three rows. The rest of you, pull those four rows.\"\nThe pig-headed woman in charge of supervising the young beastmen casually assigned them tasks.\nThe newborn beastmen are cared for by their mothers until they can walk. These nursing beastman mothers will be grouped with pregnant females, responsible for net weaving, handling prey, cooking meals, and other tasks that do not require too much strength.\nOnce the young beastmen are old enough to walk and work, they will be assigned to another team led by the current pig-headed woman, responsible for teaching survival skills and doing various simple tasks within their abilities. This can be considered an Otherworld version of kindergarten.\nHowever, this kindergarten does not teach literacy or cultural knowledge; instead, it requires them to perform various labor tasks. Of course, simple math calculations are taught, but hunting experience is the primary focus.\nIn Austin’s plans, this cohort of young beastmen will achieve roughly a first-grade level of cultural understanding once they grow up. Although some math and cultural knowledge can stimulate the beastmen’s rigid minds, Austin does not plan to establish schools like elementary, middle, or high schools or universities, at least not anytime soon.\nFor now, regarding education, Austin hasn’t figured it out yet, but it is certain that he will not spend massive resources on education.\nNo matter how you look at it, food has to be eaten bite by bite. Even if a few beastmen who understand calculus were to be taught now, it wouldn’t do much for the current Dragon Nest Tribe.\nFor the time being, what Austin needs are Clan Warriors who can obey his orders unconditionally and prove useful. In the short term, all that is needed for cultural education are indoctrination political lessons and a bit of basic math.\nUndoubtedly, there is a reason related to educational resources. The Fox-faced Man Quik, who can calculate numbers within a hundred, is already considered a rare talent in the entire Dragon Nest Tribe, and Austin has no interest in teaching them. If education changes in the future, it will likely be not until Austin can establish a stronghold in the Kawa Great Forest and truly build an Empire.\nAustin has another goal in separating the young beastmen for education, which is to instill loyalty from a young age. Even though the entire Dragon Nest Tribe already holds maximum loyalty to the Blue Young Dragon, some things still need to be done.\nRegarding the separation of mothers and children, there’s nothing to worry about. The Dragon Nest Tribe isn’t that large; everyone lives in the same place, meeting early in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. It’s merely grouping the young beastmen together for teaching, which isn’t actually a separation.\nPreviously, when the mother beastmen worked, they also had to watch over the young beastmen running around. Now that there is someone specially tasked with care and supervision, the mother beastmen can focus on working, increasing production efficiency.\nIn front of the fields, the pig-headed woman has already assigned tasks. The Jackal Wolf People Meng Bi look at the seemingly endless kudzu fields with a slightly worried expression.\n\"Aisha, can you manage? If not, I’ll help you later.\"\nPerhaps due to the climate, as the kudzu grows rapidly, weeds in the fields are also growing quickly, filling the ridges and competing with the kudzu for space.\nIf they were beastmen, they naturally wouldn’t care about these weeds. Without planting experience, they don’t have the concept that weeds can affect kudzu growth. However, Austin wouldn’t just stand by, so he ordered Vini to arrange for weeding work while observing these reclaimed fields during the trials.\nOf course, weeding is a physically demanding task and cannot be entirely completed by the young beastmen. They are responsible for a very small part, viewing it as labor course training.\nUnder Austin’s requirements, these young beastmen must try every task out there, combining teaching and practice, training them to be the future mainstay of the Dragon Grass Tribe’s development.\n\"No need, brother.\"\nAisha quickly shook her head. It’s just pulling weeds, and although the work is somewhat dull, it’s far better than the days of enduring hunger and cold in the icy snow.\nThinking back to those times struggling between life and death, she wouldn’t forget that easily just because she had a few days of full meals.\nCompared to those cold, foodless days of constant hunger, simply pulling weeds, having a full belly, and living in a warm house is nothing.\nIn contrast, Aisha feels that this is already much better.\nThe young beastmen obediently enter the fields in batches, pulling weeds alongside the kudzu. Having undergone military training even at a young age, they already understood the importance of following orders. Unlike the unruly children in Austin’s former life, they didn’t disobey or cause trouble, nurtured in hardship.\nWhile the young beastmen were weeding the kudzu in the first plot of reclaimed land, further away, other reclamation work was also ongoing.\nLack of enough farming tools made the beastmen’s reclamation work not very smooth. Even though the beastmen’s physical strength is somewhat superior to humans, after more than half a month, they had only reclaimed about a hundred acres of land.\nIn the newly opened fields, the kudzu planted two days ago has just sprouted, but it will soon grow into a lush kudzu field. And in the near future, these reclaimed farmlands will become the most solid grain source for the Dragon Nest Tribe.",

I heard the second team caught a boar using goblin-made traps—a boar, something no hunting team could capture before.\"\nAnother beastman clicked his tongue in admiration. The boars in this Otherworld seem like mutated versions, weighing nearly a thousand pounds. Running like a tank, they crush trees along the way.\nSuch fierce creatures could only be handled by Austin. Yet now even the traps caught them, which speaks volumes about their power.\n\"It’s just thanks to His Highness’s guidance; otherwise, how could these goblins have done it?\" The kobold grumbled in discontent.\n\"Alright, alright, let’s get to work. Today we need to catch ten live earth gray rabbits.\"\nDue to intensive hunting, beasts near the Dragon Nest Territory suffered, and animals within a ten-kilometer range of Dragon Nest Village became scarce. To hunt enough, they had to explore farther.\nFor sustainable resources and to address Dragon Nest Tribe’s meat issue, Austin began a beast domestication plan.\nDuring hunting, they would bring back young beasts to domesticate within the livestock pens set up in the village.\nEspecially boar and earth gray rabbit younglings, which are not picky eaters and breed quickly, making them ideal for focused farming.\nJust after the harsh winter ended a month ago, food started becoming abundant again. With sufficient food, beasts began breeding their next generation, making it not too hard to bring back younglings. Thus, Vini assigned the hunting teams quotas to bring back enough younglings daily along with their hunting tasks.\nThis hunting team, led by a few Blood Wolves, soon followed earth gray rabbits’ tracks to a fist-sized hole.\n\"This is it.\"\nSeeing the Blood Wolves digging at the entrance, the beastmen, after over a month of acclimatization, understood the Blood Wolves’ meaning—the earth gray rabbits were inside this hole.\nThe Blood Wolves then sniffed out the exits of two other holes from this burrow.\nThus, the earth gray rabbits inside the burrow were trapped inside.\nBefore, capturing earth gray rabbits inside a burrow required extensive digging, opening the entire hole.\nBut that’s no longer necessary.\nAs the leader of Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin didn’t just stand idly by.\nEarly in the harsh winter, while drilling the ice fishing holes, Austin noticed that the beastmen’s hunting techniques were primitive, lacking developed techniques or traps.\nThough not a hunter in his previous life, Austin frequently watched survival shows like Bear Grylls and recalled some basic hunting techniques, gradually teaching them to the beastmen, including some rural tricks he picked up living in the countryside.\nAmong these was the technique for dealing with earth gray rabbits hiding in burrows.\nThat technique was smoke.\nAustin recalled his childhood in a rural area in his previous life, joining a group of kids to smoke out field mice.\nStuffing a bunch of weeds into the field mouse hole entrance, and then lighting it and blowing smoke inside, the dense smoke followed the burrow’s paths, forcing field mice out of another exit, where friends would wait to catch them.\nThe same method dealt with earth gray rabbits.\nThe beastmen stuffed dry weeds into the burrow entrance, ignited them, and blew vigorously from outside, sending smoke rapidly into the burrow.\nSoon, smoke began billowing from the other two exits, as beastmen vigilantly watched them.\nMoments later, rustling sounds were heard, and two plump earth gray rabbits dashed out from the smoke, followed by a clutch of young earth gray rabbits.\nPredictably, the earth gray rabbit family was completely captured by the beastmen.\nWith the help of the Blood Wolves, finding earth gray rabbit burrows became easier, and combined with the smoking method, this hunting team caught three to four dens of earth gray rabbits by midday, though only the first den yielded younglings.\nThe hunting team returned triumphant, bringing back a bunch of lively earth gray rabbits in nets woven from vines to the village. The livestock pens in Dragon Nest Village already housed over a hundred earth gray rabbits flitting around, with piles of wild vegetables and grasses in one corner and earth gray rabbits chomping away at the leaves.\n\"Hmm, not bad, with these we should have enough, so we won’t need to catch more earth gray rabbits.\"\nKobold leader Vini examined the earth gray rabbits held by the hunting team, tossed them directly into the pen.\nEarth gray rabbits have a short growth cycle, maturing in about a month given enough food. Now, with the rabbit population, a pen was already a little overcrowded.\n\"Help me expand a few pens with wood later, and reinforce the boar pen too.\"\nThe earth gray rabbits’ strong breeding ability caused excessive density, complicating hygiene and fostering disease, thus expanding a few pens was imperative.\nOf course, this wasn’t Vini suddenly becoming knowledgeable, learning and understanding many things without guidance—it was merely conveying Austin’s instructions.\nAs for the boar pen, the problem was visibly obvious.\nThough the adult boars were all smoked meat hanging near the village, the boar younglings were still naturally aggressive, frequently ramming the pen, rocking it dangerously from their hits, necessitating reinforcement.\nFor now, Dragon Nest Tribe only planned to domesticate these two types of animal younglings due to their fast breeding speed and high value.\nWith this start in livestock farming, coupled with the grains from reclaimed farming, it’s foreseeable that the Dragon Nest Tribe’s food supply will reach self-sufficiency in the near future.",

      "content": "Chapter 60: Chapter 58: Urgency\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe is continuously developing, growing stronger day by day.\nHowever, Austin’s experiment with extraordinary power has remained stagnant, with no progress in sight.\n\"Where exactly is the problem?\"\nIn the laboratory behind the village, looking at Quik, the fox-faced man who was still twitching after sustaining an electric shock, the Blue Young Dragon kept pondering.\nWhen modifying the beastmen with electric shocks, Austin felt a faint resonance in his bloodline with the beastmen undergoing modification. This resonance was unfounded, intangible, but when Austin used his magic power to convert into electric current to stimulate the beastmen, he could sense its existence.\nThis should be the instinct of the Dragon Race.\nAnd bestowing the power of the Dragon Vein to the Beastman Race seems to be an innate privilege of the Giant Dragons.\n\"Could it be that my power is too weak, resulting in this outcome?\"\nAustin found himself deep in thought.\nSince the electric current stimulation temporarily enhanced the beastmen’s power, it suggests that the hypothesis of Giant Dragons having the natural ability to impart power to their clan might be correct.\nBut right now, he can only grant temporary power enhancements to the beastmen, unlike the results seen in the inherited memories where adult dragons bestow power permanently to their clan.\nIn the inherited memories, the Dragon Vein Mages modified by the adult dragons were not like the beastmen modified by Austin, whose powers were depleted after a few days. Those modified by adult dragons experienced an enhancement in the essence of life and could continuously advance by devouring magical resources, even reaching the Legendary Realm.\nBut what about the beastmen he modified?\nNot only did they lack the abilities of those Warlock Warriors, but even the enhancements in physique seemed temporary to Austin, like a battery charging during the electric stimulation. Once the charge finished, it gradually depleted and returned to its original state, far from the results of empowerment by dragon modification.\n\"Adult dragons are destined to be beings above Legendary, with no need for lower-tier clan members like Dragon Vein Mages, and most young dragons remain dormant during their early years, protected by their parents, without needing to develop a clan... Damn it, there’s too little information.\"\nAustin felt a bit frustrated as the knowledge gleaned from inheritance was mostly common lore of the world and the continent. For beings that naturally reach Legendary at adulthood, there is often no need to involve deep, intricate knowledge.\nRationally, even if Austin doesn’t want to admit it, he understands deep inside that it is likely because his powers are too weak.\nIf calculated by the tiers of an Extraordinary Professional, Austin is merely at the quasi-Silver stage now, far from the Legendary Realm, thus naturally incapable of freely creating Dragon Vein clan members as adult dragons can.\nHe is well-aware of this point. Nonetheless, at this stage, the only method Austin has to significantly boost the power of his Beastman Race subordinates is through their modification towards the extraordinary path using his power.\nEven though the Dragon Nest Tribe is developing rapidly at present, Austin can still clearly see the shortcomings within the tribe.\nMaybe leveraging strict discipline and tactical prowess of military groups, the beastmen within the Dragon Nest Tribe have achieved peak among ordinary beastmen.\nAt the very least, Austin dares to say that within the entire Kawa Great Forest, in absence of an extraordinary individual, the army of the Dragon Nest Tribe is undoubtedly the pinnacle elite force.\nOnly, this world is ultimately a world with magical power. Putting aside everything else, even just Austin himself can handle an entire tribe without any issue.\nBecause the wooden and stone spears the beastmen use simply cannot pierce his scale armor.\nEarlier, the clan members of the Dragon Nest Tribe could still assist Austin, but as Austin went through two transformations, the beastmen’s power could no longer keep up with him.\nTake the last incident at the Spider Cave; the beastmen clan without extraordinary power were overwhelmingly outmatched by the Spider Magical Beasts, rendering them completely ineffective.\nEven gathering more beastmen without extraordinary beastmen, unless one risks their life, it’s hard to provide significant assistance to Austin.\nAustin gathered his clan to develop a powerful force, intending to plunder enough resources for his future progress, not to act as a caretaker for the beastmen.\nMoreover, the sooner the extraordinary system is initiated, the greater the enhancement in the power of the Beastman Tribe will be.\nThis is why Austin even put aside the important task of pioneering and focused intently on experimenting to open the path to the extraordinary.\nThe failed experience at the Spider Cave increased his urge to press forward.\n\"If this path doesn’t work, I can only consider other methods.\"\nIn the laboratory, Austin sighed.\nWhile his own modification ability is currently the easiest route for Austin to provide the beastmen with extraordinary abilities, an insurmountable obstacle suddenly appeared on this path, forcing him to consider alternatives in the end.\n\"Do we have to attack that Jackal Wolfman Tribe? But lately, that Jackal Wolfman Tribe has gathered over 500 Jackal Wolf People. According to Rodney, the Jackal Wolfman leader alone makes it a one to five disparity even if the entire Dragon Nest Tribe attacks...\"\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe population has reached 133 people, but excluding the elderly, young, and pregnant beastwomen, gathering even around 100 is already quite good, not to mention that goblins, kobolds, and other naturally weaker beastmen than Jackal Wolf People make up half of them.\nEven though Austin is confident in his military-formed army, this numerical disparity still worries him a bit.\nMoreover, within that Jackal Wolfman Tribe, the Jackal Wolfman leader is a genuine extraordinary professional, possessing Bronze strength.\nAnd given the sudden surge in the population of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, there must be some significant secret within it. Otherwise, it wouldn’t suddenly increase by so many, with enough food to support it.\nSuch a tribe might even have some secret weapon. Even with Austin’s own power added, he still doesn’t have enough confidence to bring down that Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nJust as Austin was pondering, Quik, the fox-faced man on the experiment platform, stood up, still twitching from the aftereffects of the electric shock, and said haltingly:\n\"Your Highness, I might have figured out the reason.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 61: Chapter 59: The Extraordinary Path\n\"Oh, how so?\"\nQuik, the fox-faced man, was considered the wise man of the Dragon Nest Tribe, knowledgeable about many things. Perhaps he could truly discover the reason.\n\"Your Highness, I’ve heard that in the human civilized world, ordinary humans need to activate the Fighting Qi Seed or Magic Seed with the help of some magic potions when advancing to become Extraordinary individuals, be they warriors or mages, in addition to learning the Breathing Technique. Our experiment failed, very likely because we missed the step of involving magic energy.\"\nQuik cautiously spoke out his conjecture.\n\"Magic Energy?\"\nAustin was initially taken aback but then came to a sudden realization.\nIndeed, it’s magic energy!\nEven in this magical world, it’s impossible to create something from nothing. Without the involvement of such Extraordinary Abilities as magic energy, how could one step onto the path of the Extraordinary!\nAdult Legendary Giant Dragons have reached unfathomable levels, capable of triggering magic power tides with every move. When endowing the clan’s orcs, they naturally attract and infuse magic energy, transforming the essence of orc life with ease.\nBut now, Austin is merely at the quasi-Silver stage. Even with the innate privileges of a dragon, how could he possibly invoke the ambient magic power in the air to perform a comprehensive transformation of the orc’s life?\nThe electric currents produced by Blue Young Dragons indeed have the ability to stimulate the potential within the orcs, but precisely because of the lack of magic energy, this stimulated potential reverts to its original state once it passes, failing to be maintained.\n\"That’s it, that must be it!\"\nAustin became excited. It seemed that after the Spider Cave incident, he was indeed too hasty, resulting in neglecting such an important matter.\nHowever, it’s not too late now. Understanding this point, then Extraordinary Orc Warriors will emerge within the Dragon Nest Tribe!\n\"If transformation requires magic energy, then it’s necessary to have substances containing magic power. Magic Beast Crystal Cores? No, they’re too rare... the Blood Red Fruit in the Blood Wolf Lair? But they’ve just blossomed on that side of the Blood Wolf Lair...\"\nMagic Beast Crystal Cores are also extremely important to Austin, not to mention he’s only encountered them twice, making it impossible to expend them on orcs.\nAs for the magic tree previously encountered beside the Blood Wolf Lair, the Blood Red Fruit it produced might be useful, but that magic tree has just blossomed, and it would take at least half a year for the fruit to mature.\nAfter pondering for a long time, Austin finally found a suitable item.\nAfter the Spider Cave expedition, the orcs not only brought back a nameless plant used for detoxification but also carried away the corpses of four large spiders and those stones emitting a faint, faintly glowing light beneath the nameless plants.\nThe previous harvest, the plants, were used to detoxify Rodney and others, with only a few left hanging to dry and preserve by the village.\nAs for the corpses of the four large spiders, they didn’t contain Magic Beast Crystal Cores, but their shells were incredibly sturdy and were made into weapons.\nAnd those stones that emitted a faint blue glow, although they felt weak magic fluctuations from within, Austin thought of how the Spider Cave had existed for an unknown number of years, with various prey rotting there, leaving layers of spider excrement covering the stones. Despite the orcs scrubbing them clean, he couldn’t get past the mental barrier of consuming stones buried under who-knows-what for who-knows-how-long.\nMoreover, the faint magic within them was of little use to Austin, who had matured to this stage.\nTherefore, these stones containing magic power were ultimately preserved, pressed at the bottom of a box, waiting for a day they might be useful.\nAnd now, it seems Austin has found the time to use them!\n\"We’ll use those magic stones brought back from the Spider Cave!\"\nAustin hurriedly flew outside, just as Quik breathed a sigh of relief, rejoicing that he was no longer being shocked, Austin rushed in, clutching a stone emitting a faint azure glow.\n\"Quik, lie down, I want to try again!\"\nSeeing Austin’s excited expression, Quik grimaced and dutifully lay down on the experimental table, becoming a guinea pig once more.\nAlthough Austin exercised control to avoid endangering their lives with the electric current, just thinking about the terrifying sensation of electricity coursing chaotically through their bodies left few eager for the experience.\nDisregarding Quik’s grimace, Austin grasped the magic stone with his forepaw and pressed it onto Quik’s chest.\nElectric Shock Paralysis!\nMagic power inside him circulates along a certain trajectory, subtly affecting the surrounding air, triggering an unknown change in the ethereal space, ultimately transforming into electric current.\nBrzzzt!\nArcs of sparks danced and leapt out in the air, erratic electric snakes darted, brushing against Quik’s body and spreading outward with the magic stone as the center.\nThat mysterious sensation emerged once more, and like countless experiments before, a resonance seemed to occur between his blood and something else.\nSimultaneously, under the stimulation of electric currents, the magic stone experienced an unknown change, wisps of blue light drifting from within the magic stone like a drop of blue ink dispersing in water, spreading over most of Quik’s chest and following the electric currents into Quik’s body.\nAt that moment, Quik, originally shaking uncontrollably and rolling his eyes, feeling despair,\nsuddenly widened his eyes!",

      "content": "Chapter 62: Chapter 60: Plan\nAs the magic energy within the magic stone was stimulated by Austin’s talent magic, a blue ghostly light spread out, suddenly flowing like a current into Quik’s body.\n\"Ah!!!\"\nA loud, miserable scream echoed.\nIn an instant, Quik only felt as if a mass of burning molten lava surged upon his chest, scorching muscle and skin, seeping along the veins, spreading to every corner of his body, like magma flowing through his veins.\nIt was a pain like piercing and drilling, as if every piece of flesh was being ground to mush, then reborn anew.\nAnd at this moment, his limbs had completely lost their ability to move, rigid on the experiment table, unable to twitch, as he could only stare with bloodshot eyes, enduring this extraordinarily painful transformation.\n\"It’s going to succeed!\"\nSeeing Quik’s reaction, Austin’s expression was focused, the feeling in his heart telling him that this time he was really going to succeed.\nThe air at this moment began to swirl, forming a tiny vortex, with visible ripples spreading in all directions — a sign that the magic energy and the omnipresent magical power in the air were resonating.\nA mysterious and unfathomable power was at work in the shadows, and if there were a microscope to observe minute details, it would be discovered that the cells within Quik’s body were being savagely destroyed by the infusion of magic energy. Meanwhile, under the influence of the \"authority\" of the Giant Dragon, some of the cells eroded by magic energy survived, rapidly dividing and proliferating, replacing the necrotic cells that had been destroyed.\nIn just a short few moments, the magic power contained within the magic stone was completely unleashed and dissipated, and Quik’s body was now fully affected by the magic energy, achieving an enhancement at the level of life’s essence.\n\"How about it?\"\nAustin withdrew his claw, the magic stone in his palm now transformed into an ordinary piece of rock, cracking with webs of fissures, then crumbling into dust, cascading down from his fingertips.\nQuik’s face still held a grim expression, but as the cells regenerated within, the relief after intense pain made him feel as if he had opened the door to a new world, an indescribable feeling of transformation from death to rebirth.\n\"Your Highness, it should have succeeded.\"\nAfter a short rest, he slowly stood up from the experiment table and exhaled a long breath.\nCompared to before, it was impossible to notice any obvious changes in his appearance.\nBut his pupils became remarkably deep, his fur shone with a faintly ghostly light, swaying with the breeze, even emanating a magical fluctuation.\nAnd now, standing before Austin, Quik gave him the feeling that something drastic had changed.\nThe difference was like a piece of wood versus a piece of glowing wood — the essence of life’s aura had fundamentally transformed.\nIf before, in front of Austin, Quik’s life aura was like a spark, now it was at least a burning charcoal.\nThe extraordinary experiment should have been successful!\n\"Have any abilities emerged?\"\nFor what was likely the first genuine success, Austin could not help but place significant importance.\nQuik pondered and stretched out his palm, closing his eyes.\nConcentrating his heart spirit, constantly gathering the newly generated power within his body into his palm, tiny dots of light slowly emerged from the center of his palm, transforming into an azure-blue flame, the size of a match burn, then suddenly,\nPuff!\nThe blue flame was instantly extinguished and dissipated, while Quik, as if drained of strength, half-kneeled on the ground, drenched in sweat, panting heavily as if the effort had completely depleted him.\n\"Sorry, Your Highness, I am incompetent.\"\nThe power of this tiny flame was useless in battle.\nIn Quik’s view, His Highness Austin’s experiment had failed again, and he had wasted a seemingly precious magic stone imbued with magic power.\nThinking the experiment had failed, Quik hurried to apologize to Austin.\n\"No, you did well, very well!\"\nContrary to Quik’s disappointment, Austin was immediately overjoyed.\nCompared to the previous experiments that only temporarily enhanced the Beastmen’s physical strength, what was revealed now in front of him was truly extraordinary power!\nAnd this also meant that Quik officially entered the realm of extraordinary life!\nEven though he couldn’t condense even a spark, in Austin’s eyes, Quik entering the realm of extraordinary life through his modification was more significant than the Dragon Nest tribe’s population surpassing a hundred.\n\"The plan might be able to start!\"\nIn Austin’s pupils, the beast called ambition was roaring fiercely from within, occupying his entire vision.\nThe starting and end points of extraordinary life and ordinary life are different, and within the Dragon Nest tribe, the training and combat power of Beastmen may have nearly reached their limits.\nYet if it were extraordinary life forms, with enough food support and rigorous training, despite the lack of a cultivation breathing technique, their achievements would far surpass ordinary beings.\nQuik obtaining extraordinary power also meant that Austin had truly overcome the obstacle in the plan for extraordinary beings, using this method to endow his subordinate Beastmen with the potential of extraordinary beings as well.\nOnce all his subordinate clan Beastmen were successfully transformed, and after a short period of training, a force of nearly a hundred extraordinary beings even Austin could not underestimate, let alone on the battlefield, where the formation of Beastmen with extraordinary power could play a role far exceeding what Austin could achieve.\nAnd as long as there were extraordinary Beastmen, Austin could boldly step out of the Dragon Nest territory’s bounds and expand in all directions.\nAt this moment, Austin already had a comprehensive plan in his mind.\nExpend all the magic stones to transform his robust Beastmen subordinates, then form an army with these extraordinary Beastmen at the core, sweeping west, south, and east to conquer all surrounding Beastman tribes within a fifty-mile radius, capturing prisoners, and then gathering a thousand strong Beastmen soldiers to march north and utterly defeat the mysterious Jackal Wolfman tribe located just over ten kilometers north.\nSince the Jackal Wolfman tribe settled north of the Dragon Nest tribe has a Bronze Level Jackal Wolfman leader, it likely possesses a breathing technique.\nAs long as they captured the Jackal Wolfman tribe and seized that breathing technique, the entire Dragon Nest tribe was set to soar to new heights.",

      "content": "Chapter 63: Chapter 61 Dragon Vein Attendant\nAustin had always confined himself within a ten-mile radius of the Dragon Nest Territory, refraining from expanding outward largely because his Clan lacked the power to support such expansion.\nWhen Austin first selected this area for the Dragon Nest, it was primarily because this part of Hell was relatively remote, lacking any Magic Beast nests. If explored further, not only was there a likelihood of encountering more powerful Beastman Tribes, but also strong groups of Magic Beasts. In Austin’s current state of being stretched thin, this could easily lead to losses among the Beastman Race.\nNow that the beastmen have embarked on the path of Extraordinary Power, if they also acquire a Breathing Technique that allows ordinary life to continuously advance, and use the Extraordinary Beastmen as a base, Austin is confident he can gather a massive Empire and establish a vast Empire within ten years!\nQuik’s successful experiment invigorated Austin’s spirit.\nThen, within a day, using Quik’s successful experiment as a template, Austin transformed his most elite beastmen into the Extraordinary.\nWhen originally exploring the Spider Cave, they had retreated hastily, managing to collect only ten magical stones. Excluding the one used by Quik, Austin eventually could only transform nine elite beastmen.\nAfter the transformation succeeded, Austin reorganized these nine beastmen and named them the Dragon Vein Attendants, symbolizing the Imperial Guard, with a status surpassing the three formal military units.\nThis was the first Extraordinary Beastman Legion of Austin’s subordinate Clan!\nOf course, calling it a legion is premature now, as a legion of only nine beastmen seems somewhat meager. But Austin believes this Dragon Vein Attendants Legion will one day grow to a thousand, ten thousand, and eventually, shake the entire world.\nCompared to Quik’s mage-type transformation, the Dragon Vein Attendants are all warrior-type Extraordinary Beastmen.\nThis perhaps relates to the outcome and talents, for Austin initially chose the nine strongest in constitution as candidates, while Quik possessed far more wisdom than the average beastman, likely leading to these results.\nThough they are warrior-type extraordinary beings, this is actually the most suitable outcome for the current Dragon Nest Tribe. Take the fox-faced man Cook, even though he has embarked on the path of extraordinary, without mage knowledge, he cannot fully utilize his power.\nIn contrast, the Dragon Vein Attendants who successfully tread the extraordinary path, whether in physical ability or strength, are more than several times stronger than their former selves, growing in size and displaying an overwhelming presence in front of ordinary beastmen.\nAs of now, the warrior-type Dragon Vein Attendants are much more crucial to the Dragon Nest Tribe than the mage-type fox-faced man Quik.\n.....\nThree days later, on the open ground outside the village.\n\"One, two, three! Throw!\"\nOn the open ground, the nine Dragon Vein Attendants, each larger than regular beastmen, carried enormous stones weighing up to a ton on their shoulders, taking heavy steps as they moved ten meters forward and stopped before a marked line.\nAt the command, the nine large-bodied Dragon Vein Attendants’ skin bulged with blue veins, muscles swelling, and a thin layer of blood mist enveloped their hair, forming a line like impending flames.\n\"Ha!\"\nIn unison, their voices like thunder, they hurled the boulders overhead with immense force, sending them flying into the distance.\nHuge stones, each weighing over a ton, blotted out the sky, hurled thirty meters away by these Dragon Vein Attendants. Apart from some reddening faces, they only appeared slightly short of breath.\nBang, bang, bang!\nThe consecutive crashes of boulders hitting the ground caused tremors on the earth.\nAt this moment, ordinary beastmen watching from the side were dumbfounded, their mouths agape wide enough to fit a goose egg.\nAfter the Dragon Vein Attendants’ appearance, Austin organized a military exercise against the ordinary beastmen. The nine Dragon Vein Attendants formed a squad with stone shields carved from chunks of stone, assembling as Shield Soldiers, tearing through a spear formation of over a hundred beastmen.\nEven when ordinary beastmen combined their strength, they couldn’t match them.\nAt that moment, other beastmen within the Dragon Nest Territory understood the prowess of the Dragon Vein Attendants, yet they hadn’t expected them to be so formidable, capable of lifting such enormous stones and throwing them such distances.\nIf any other tribe engaged in warfare, the Dragon Vein Attendants could likely decimate the enemy by hurling stones from afar before the battle even started.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nThe Dragon Vein Beastmen roared in unison, their massive voices swept the field, stirring up a whirlwind with a hint of dragon might, which, like a rushing stream, pressured the ordinary beastmen scattered around.\n\"Not bad.\"\nFrom afar, watching from a high vantage point, Austin nodded in approval.\nAfter using magical stones for modification, the Dragon Vein Beastmen had notable differences from the previously transformed half-finished products, with life quality fundamentally changed from its roots, not to mention the greatly enhanced power, already surpassing the early prototypes.\nMoreover, as true Extraordinary Lives, the Dragon Vein Beastmen experienced not only physical and power enhancements but also possessed actual Extraordinary Abilities.\nThe Dragon Vein Attendants, for instance, awakened a talent akin to a game-style berserk mode.\nFollowing conversion into Extraordinary Life, the Dragon Vein Beastmen could voluntarily ignite their blood, enveloping themselves in a mist of bloody aura, dramatically boosting their strength and speed for a brief period, though after this burst, they would fall into weakness for about a day.\nAs Austin’s successfully modified works, he took it upon himself to name the beastmen’s ability as Blood Burning.\nIn the Blood Burning state, the Dragon Vein Beastmen’s hair was tinged with faint misty red light, aptly named.\n\"Unfortunately, the Spider Magical Beasts inside Spider Cave are far too difficult to deal with. Otherwise, sweeping the cave and gathering enough magical stones to transform all beastmen into Dragon Vein Beastmen would be ideal.\"\nAustin thought greedily.\nWith the ten magical stones used up, even if Austin wished to expand the number of Dragon Vein Attendants, the resources were unavailable.\nMoreover, considering the intractable toxic mists within the Spider Cave, purging it entirely remained out of the question, and in its shadowy depths, Austin once vaguely sensed a faint hint of a deathly threat.\nGiven Austin’s strength, if he felt threatened, the dangers lurking deep within the Spider Cave were unimaginable.\n\"Though it’s impossible to increase the number of Dragon Vein Beastmen for now, what we have is sufficient already. It’s time to conduct a massive sweep to expand the Clan’s number!\"\nAustin spread his wings, creating a surge of air as he soared into the sky, a relentless ambition reflected in his eyes.\nAll forces,\nadvance!",

The entire tribe had only about ten simple thatched houses perched on a hillside, surrounded by muddy wastewater exuding a rotten stench, with flies buzzing around in the air.\nThe Beastman Tribes are pretty much the same, even in the human Civilized World, there’s no hygiene awareness, let alone the Beastman Tribes inside the Kawa Great Forest.\nSaru’s tribe was split off from another Great Tribe two years ago.\nIn the Kawa Great Forest, when the area of activity of a tribe could no longer provide sufficient food for the entire tribe, a small part would automatically split and go explore elsewhere, searching for survival.\nOf course, saying it was automatic separation, if one wasn’t abandoned and forced to leave, who would be willing to leave the tribe’s territory?\nEvery year, when the Beastman Tribe’s population exceeds its limit, the teams sent out to find new homes almost face a deadly peril in the dangerous Kawa Great Forest.\nSaru and his comrades were somewhat lucky, after leaving the Great Tribe and enduring some losses, they finally found a relatively safe place to settle.\nMinotaurs are good at cattle herding, relying on the group of domesticated wild cattle they brought from the tribe, Saru and his comrades managed to get through their hardest times upon settling in the area, laying a foundation near here.\nThough during the recent cold winter, they lost over a dozen members due to hunger, but as the cold winter passed, the Kawa Great Forest saw all things reviving and growing. The entire forest entered a new cycle, and various food sources became plentiful again, allowing Saru and his tribe to gather enough food from the forest to get through the crisis.\nHowever, good times didn’t last long; soon, a Storm Tiger appeared in the eastern valley at some unknown time. It released magic just like Wind Blade, and by now, several Minotaurs have been killed by the Storm Tiger. The herd they domesticated suffered heavy losses as well. If the Storm Tiger’s appetite wasn’t relatively fixed, their entire tribe and herd would have been devoured by it.\nEven so, the Storm Tiger posed a severe threat to all production activities in the Minotaur Tribe. If it wasn’t restrained soon, the entire Minotaur tribe might be destroyed by the Storm Tiger.\nBut that’s easier said than done.\nUndoubtedly, the Storm Tiger was a purely Extraordinary Magical Beast. Although Minotaurs are stronger than the Kobolds, Goblins, and other bottom-tier Beastmen due to their physique.\nBut so what, ordinary Beastmen can’t even resist against usual Magic Beasts, let alone a top-tier predator Magical Beast like the Storm Tiger.\n\"May the Beast God protect us, if there’s no other choice, we might have to move.\"\nIn the simple thatched house conference room, the Minotaur chief discussed with a few strong Minotaurs.\nThe whole room felt particularly gloomy.\n\"I don’t agree, the unexplored areas are too dangerous. Remember when over five hundred of us left the tribe, but what happened? More than three hundred companions died on the road before we finally found this relatively safe place. How can we give it up so easily?\"\n\"Staying won’t solve anything, will you face the Storm Tiger?\"\n\"I don’t agree, so what?\"\nIndeed a Minotaur, inheriting the bull’s stubborn temper as too. As soon as speaking out, it was on the verge of a clash.\n\"What are you pulling?\"\n\"Pulling you!\"\n\"Are you looking for a fight?!\"\n\"Bring it on, I’m not afraid of you!\"\nAs the argument heated up, two stubborn Minotaurs were about to fight.\n\"Enough, you two stop arguing!\"\nThe Minotaur chief, already worried and irritated, immediately spoke up. Already annoyed, they made it worse, he said very disgustedly:\n\"At this point in time, still...\"\nThe Minotaur chief wanted to rebuke them but hadn’t finished speaking when,\nsuddenly a change occurred.\nBOOM!!!\nWith a loud bang, the thatched roof suddenly collapsed, opening a big hole, pieces of shattered wood and dust fell like snowflakes, while a huge stone with horrible power crashed into the center of the room causing the whole thatched house to tremble, the ground even dented with web-like cracks spreading everywhere.\nWhat is this???\nLooking at the huge hole in the roof exposing the sky and the gigantic stone taller than a person in front, the Minotaurs blinked blankly.\nDid the stars fall from the sky?\nJust as the Minotaur chief and his followers were at their wit’s end, the sound of breaking wind spread in the air,\nthen,\nBANG BANG BANG!!!\nThe sound of continuous muffled explosions came from outside, shaking the ground in waves, as if welcoming an earthquake.\nAt that moment, a lung-splitting roar sounded outside.\n\"Enemy invasion!!!\"\nFinally, the Minotaurs realized, while the Minotaur chief slapped the board beside him, sprung up, anger erupting:\n\"Let’s see which clueless fool dares to come here and wreak havoc!\"\nHolding two large Iron Hammers, the Minotaur chief stormed out of the thatched room in rage.\nAt this moment, the entire Minotaur tribe was in chaos, more than half of the thatched houses had collapsed, huge stones scattered in the open space of the village, or crushed through houses and stood in the middle.\nThe stones falling from the sky didn’t cause many casualties, but thrown the whole Minotaur tribe into a state of extreme panic.\n\"Bastard, who is wreaking havoc here!\"\nStepping out of the thatched house in a few strides, looking up, he saw rows of Beastman troops lining into neat formations, charging toward him.\n\"Kill!!!\"\nAmidst the murderous shouting, Beastman Long Spears were erected, led by nine towering Beastmen holding massive Stone Shields, charging fiercely.\nThe orderly formation, erected Long Spears, strict troops. This formidable scene,\nat that moment,\nmade the Minotaur chief feel as if a mountain was crashing down, rocking him.\n\"Good! Three Lizardmen, a group of Jackal Wolf People, and Kobolds dare to come wreak havoc here?! Brothers, counter-attack them with full force!\"\nThat shock lasted only a moment before the Minotaur chief regained his composure. Upon seeing the composition of the army, his anger turned into rage, raising his Stone Hammer to rally, leading the disordered troops to charge down toward the Beastman army formation.",

      "content": "Chapter 65: Chapter 63 Chaos Battle\nAustin’s Dragon Vein Attendants immediately began intense training once formed. Once they were trained to cooperate with ordinary Beastman armies, they launched their campaign and embarked on the path of conquest.\nThe Jackal Wolfman Tribe, numbering over five hundred, was still able to maintain peace and stability, but other tribes immediately met disaster.\nAustin established his territory with the Dragon’s Nest as the center, extending ten miles around, rarely allowing Beastmen to cross this boundary. However, that did not mean he didn’t send people to investigate the conditions of nearby Beastman Tribes.\nEarly on, when Austin asked the Fox-faced Man, Quik, how to quickly increase the population of the Dragon Nest Tribe, Quik proposed two methods.\nOne involved lighting smoke pillars to attract wandering Beastmen, raising the Dragon Nest Tribe from a micro-tribe of over thirty to a small tribe of a hundred.\nThe other was to sustain war through war, absorbing and annexing antagonistic Beastman Tribes, thereby rapidly increasing the power within the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nDue to the lack of strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe and other reasons at the time, Austin temporarily shelved the second method but also sent Quik to contact some micro-tribes living in hardship to see if they could be absorbed into the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAustin also understood early that for the Dragon Nest Tribe to rapidly grow and expand in a short period, war was the most effective means.\nTherefore, Austin restricted the Clan Beastmen to operate within the Dragon Nest Territory but also instructed Quik to explore the conditions of nearby tribes to facilitate war in the future.\nThis exploration task was only assigned to Quik, without exerting real effort, mainly recording information about other Beastman Tribe members encountered during hunting trips.\nNow with the appearance of the Dragon Vein Attendants, the biggest shortcoming of the Dragon Nest Tribe was rectified, and Austin had no hesitation, expanding rapidly in all directions.\nPrevious recorded information was searched out, and this time the entire Dragon Nest Tribe truly emptied out, majorly scouted and discovered several small tribes either ten, twenty, or thirty miles away east, west, and south.\nAustin temporarily did not plan to deal with the Jackal Wolfman Tribe in the north, only after defeating and absorbing several tribes in the east, west, and south would he fully engage with the Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nThe Minotaur Tribe, where Saru resided, was one of the target tribes of this Dragon Nest Tribe’s campaign.\nMinotaurs, bold and straightforward, yet careless, were completely unaware when the Dragon Nest Tribe approached their vicinity, resulting in the entire tribe being almost stunned by an unexpected rock assault from above.\nFortunately, the Minotaur leader was fierce, quickly boosting the courage of his subordinates, charging down towards the Dragon Nest Tribe’s military formation advancing from the mountain’s base.\n\"Kill them! Crush this bunch of bastards!\"\nSaru followed in the chaos of the Minotaur Tribe, carrying a giant wooden club, and charged alongside the Minotaur leader.\n\"Charge!\"\nAt the mountain base, the Dragon Nest Tribe’s Beastmen army also roared with deafening battle cries, long spears standing tall, and they charged fiercely, appearing more organized than the scattered Minotaur Tribe. Their steps were almost in unison.\nHowever, Minotaurs were naturally stronger in physique and strength, not to mention there were over two hundred Minotaurs in the tribe, while the Dragon Nest Legion, composed mainly of Kobolds, Jackal Wolf People, and Goblins, collectively only numbered around a hundred.\nUnder these circumstances, the Dragon Nest Legion was at an absolute disadvantage in terms of numbers and individual combat power.\nMoreover, coupled with the terrain advantage, the Minotaur Tribe’s superiority was heightened.\nUnder normal conditions, the Dragon Nest Legion should have entrenched at the mountain base to ward off the enemy, rather than directly charging at the Minotaur Tribe.\nBut now, at the forefront of the Dragon Nest Legion, there were nine Extraordinary Dragon Vein Beastmen as vanguards, whose aggressive momentum was difficult for ordinary Beastmen to withstand.\nFurthermore, Austin started this war against the Minotaur Tribe largely to annex and absorb them. If he could break the Minotaur Tribe’s morale at the outset, integrating them into the Dragon Nest Tribe would be much simpler.\nJust as they say, once a thousand people gather, they can cover the earth, and once ten thousand gather, they can encompass the entire land.\nThough the total number of Beastmen on the entire mountainside battlefield only totaled around three hundred, the Minotaur Tribe’s scattered formation covered the entire mountainside.\n\"Kill!\"\nClose-quarter combat followed, as the enraged Minotaur Tribe collided with the Dragon Nest Legion.\nHowever, in the next moment, the Minotaur leader’s envisioned scene of shattering the opposing group of midgets did not materialize; instead, it was as if they had collided with an incredibly hard reef.\nBam!\nThe Minotaur leader leaped high to lead the charge, a massive Stone Hammer crashing down, but a half-human-high Stone Shield slammed down like a wall with unstoppable momentum. Under the enormous force, the great Stone Hammer in the leader’s hand was knocked away, and he was thrown backward.\nWith several thudding sounds, the Minotaur leader flew back several tribe members before stopping, rolling eight or nine meters.\n\"Damn it, how can these bastards be so strong!\"\nThe Minotaur leader, gasping for breath, cursed and swore as he scrambled to his feet in a clumsy tumble.\nHe shook his head, slowly regaining some clarity.\nHowever, at that moment, he was horrified to see that under the onslaught of the Dragon Nest Legion, his Minotaur deployment was like a loose heap of sand, penetrated and torn apart. With nine gigantic Stone Shields at the core, Long Spears thrust out from behind, skewering each Minotaur before they could even land a hit, toppling them to the ground.\nIn just this brief moment, the entire Minotaur tribe had already lost a fifth of its forces, yet they hadn’t inflicted even the slightest harm on the Dragon Nest Legion.\n\"Not good!\"\nA shiver ran through the Minotaur leader’s heart, the previous anger incited by those dwarves had long vanished.\nThough he was reckless, he wasn’t stupid. Seeing the defeat was certain, he immediately had the thought of fleeing.\n\"Retreat for now! I’ll find another time to show these damned bastards my might!\"\nYou just wait for me, I’ll definitely be back!\nThe Minotaur leader looked hatefully at the Dragon Vein Beastmen charging left and right as though no one was there, no longer caring for the subordinates who had already lost their courage, he turned and fled in embarrassment.\nYet at this moment,\nBoom!!!\nThe sky above suddenly turned gloomy, an overwhelming pressure spread out in all directions, the entire firmament seemed to press down like a tsunami into an abyss, the terrifying pressure descended like a mountain.\nThe remaining resisting Minotaurs immediately went weak in the knees, collapsing like wheat before a gust of wind, their bodies trembling uncontrollably under this dreadful pressure.\nThe Minotaur leader, facing this impact head-on, staggered a few steps back, staring up at the sky in astonishment.\nIn the sky before him, unbeknownst to him, was covered by a pair of enormous dark blue wings. The shadow it cast seemed to plunge the world into a pit of despair. Simultaneously, a hideous head descended slowly from above, its blood-red eyes carrying a frightening pressure, gradually approaching in front of him.\nAt that moment, the Minotaur leader felt himself sinking into an icy pit, as if a bucket of cold water was poured over him in midwinter, an endless chill surged into his heart.\nThe battlefield around instantly fell into dead silence, the previously noisy battleground was devoid of any sound.\nHe stood there transfixed, watching the menacing head slowly draw near, his heart flooding with infinite fear.\nFear,\nUnprecedented fear,\nFear that the head would suddenly open and bite his head off.\nYet despite the terror, he remained motionless.\nHis hands and feet were ice-cold, as if every muscle in his body was frozen stiff, unable to move even a finger, only able to watch as the terrifying head approached.\nAll the Minotaurs on the ground shivered under that terrifying aura, not daring to move at all.\nThis was the suppression of higher life forms over lower ones, the absolute rule of the strong over the weak!\nEven the Beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe, even the Dragon Vein Attendant, were half-kneeling at this moment. However, compared to the Minotaurs’ fear, the Beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe were more filled with excitement and fervor.\nThe Blue Young Dragon appeared, wantonly exuding its terrible majesty, sweeping through the heavens and earth,\nexhibiting the mighty power of dragon prestige, bringing thousands to their knees in submission.\nHe glanced at the Minotaur leader, whose limbs were stiff in front of him,\nCold, ancient, solemn,\nA voice without any fluctuation resonated in the air,\nas if carrying the decree of the Heavenly Dao:\n\"Submit, or die!\"\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website.

      "content": "Chapter 66: Chapter 64: Conclusion\nGulu!\nIn the midst of a dead silence, facing the terrifying shadow in front, the Minotaur leader was drenched in cold sweat, involuntarily swallowing a mouthful of saliva.\n\"I, I... surrender...\"\nThe Minotaur leader stammered, slowly kneeling on the ground, signifying submission.\nThe atmosphere on the entire battlefield eased significantly, and with the Minotaur leader’s submission, this war also came to an end.\nThe Minotaurs generally have a stubborn nature, but it was not surprising to see them surrender under such circumstances.\nIn the previous war, the Dragon Nest army, with the Dragon Vein Beastmen at the core and the Legion as the rear guard formation, displayed strength far beyond what the Minotaurs expected.\nEven though they held various advantages, they were still utterly defeated in the contact battle during this war.\nIn this war initiated by the Dragon Nest Tribe, the Dragon Vein Attendants, relying on strength far surpassing ordinary Beastmen, directly pierced through the impact of the Minotaur Tribe, invincible wherever they went, and with the help of the indestructible Dragon Nest Legion from behind, utterly shattered all Minotaur morale.\nSubsequently, with Austin descending from the sky, sweeping the surroundings with dragon might, the Minotaurs lost all will to resist, making their surrender anticipated.\nThe Minotaurs indeed are single-minded, but when their morale is thoroughly crushed, and faced with power far exceeding their level, resistance was nonexistent, making them easily captured by the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"Very well, Rodney, Vini, clean up the spoils and bring them all back to the tribe!\"\nWith the surrender of the Minotaur leader, the war was completely over and entered the closing phase, and Austin ordered Vini to handle various post-war matters.\nIn this battle, the Dragon Nest Tribe also lost over ten people; however, due to the Minotaurs’ penchant for blunt instruments, most injuries consisted of fractured bones and damaged organs, ranging from minor to severe, but with no fatalities. With the Beastmen’s recuperative ability, they might recover shortly.\nIn comparison to the losses, the gains from this victorious war could not be underestimated.\nNot only did this battle defeat the Minotaur Tribe entrenched in the surrounding mountains, but it also completely subdued them. Even though the Minotaurs suffered significant losses in the previous battles, there were still over 150 intact Minotaurs left.\nThe actual death count in this war was not high, amounting to no more than about ten.\nTherefore, it can be said that the Dragon Nest Tribe’s number of Beastmen has more than doubled in a short time, reaching a total of three hundred!\nWith nine Dragon Vein Attendants at the core, combined with the nearly militarized Dragon Nest Legion, the combat power formed is formidable, not fearing the Jackal Wolfman Tribe located north of the Dragon Nest Village.\nOf course, for these Minotaurs to fully integrate into the Dragon Nest Village system, they must undergo military training, and during this period of training integration, the Minotaurs cannot yet be considered a part of the combat force.\nThe population growth is not even the biggest gain for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nTo Austin, the biggest gain was the herd of nearly five hundred wild cattle herded by the Minotaur Tribe!\nWild cattle are valuable; not only can they provide meat when the Beastmen lack food, but if used properly, they can also help Beastmen with pioneering work.\nEarly in the cultivation of the first field, Austin considered the issue of using livestock for plowing. With the help of livestock, the Beastmen’s pace of land reclamation would quicken significantly. However, although the hunting team occasionally hunted wild cattle or horses, taming them was far from feasible, let alone using them for agriculture.\nNow, with the help of Minotaur prisoners, initiating livestock-powered farming is bound to be possible, greatly increasing the Beastmen’s pace in land reclamation.\nKnowing that with Dragon Nest Tribe’s population growth, the gap in food supply will expand further, land reclamation and farming will become one of the primary sources for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"Take this herd of wild cattle back to the Dragon Nest Tribe, and upon return, search around the village for any good pastures. These wild cattle are crucial for farming and land reclamation work.\"\nLooking at the herd scattered across the mountains, being leisurely driven away by the Minotaur prisoners, Austin instructed Vini beside him.\n\"Understood, Your Highness.\"\nThe Kobold leader, Vini, who was beside him overseeing the packing and transport of the tribe’s various resources and spoils, promptly responded affirmatively.\nThere were still some food reserves left in the Minotaur Tribe, mostly matured wild fruits, seeds, and starchy roots, with no meat and very little quantity, enough for two hundred Minotaurs to consume for about a day or two—not much to speak of.\nIt can be said that the greatest wealth of the Minotaur Tribe was that herd of domesticated wild cattle. Coupled with Austin’s recent achievements with sheep, soot rabbits, and wild boars, even without Austin’s instruction, Vini would focus on those wild cattle.\n\"By the way, Your Highness, Wage just told me something.\"\nWage was the name of the Minotaur leader. As the leader of the Minotaur Tribe, after Austin accepted the Minotaurs’ surrender, it was natural to discuss various matters with him.\n\"According to Wage, a storm tiger suddenly appeared in the eastern mountains not long ago, capable of spitting wind blades, causing significant losses to their tribe. Based on Wage’s description, it might be a Tier Four or higher Magic Beast.\"\nVini’s expression showed a bit of concern as he spoke.\nA Tier Four Magic Beast, according to the classification of Extraordinaries, would be at least at the Silver Level.\n\"A Magic Beast... leave it for now, and continue the plan to level the nearby tribes first.\"\nAfter pondering for a moment, Austin made a decision.\nAt Silver Level, the combat power already exceeds his own. Even with his intrinsic dragon combat power bonus, it is uncertain whether he could eliminate it without harm. Moreover, finding its traces in the vast forest isn’t a simple task.\nAfter returning laden with spoils from the war, settling the Minotaurs and the domesticated wild cattle, the Dragon Nest Tribe resumed their campaign, sweeping in all directions.\nIn just ten days, they destroyed a total of four tribes of varying sizes, annexing them completely, and the Dragon Nest Tribe’s population reached seven hundred.\nAmong them, the majority were Kobolds and Goblins, with a few Lizardmen, Minotaurs, and a few Boar People among other sturdy Beastman minorities, though these were few in number. Not every tribe, like the Minotaur Tribe, was composed of a single Beastman race; more often, mixed races gathered together to make a living.\nAfter swallowing five tribes in succession, even though a few tribes’ traces were discovered externally, Austin decided to end this military operation.\nFrom a tribe with a little over a hundred to swallowing nearly six hundred Beastmen, the most critical task at this stage is to transform the captives to integrate them into the Dragon Nest Tribe.",

      "content": "Chapter 67: Chapter 65: The Trouble of Incorporating\nThe population of the Dragon Nest Tribe suddenly surged from over a hundred to more than seven hundred. Although, due to Austin’s natural boost as a member of the Giant Dragon Race and the lifestyle of the Dragon Nest Tribe ensuring they have enough to eat daily, the orc captives were generally content and even felt good living in the Dragon Nest Tribe, willingly submitting.\nHowever, the management of these newly added six hundred people remains a significant issue.\nInitially, after Austin transformed into the Dragon Vein Beastmen, in his excitement, he decided to launch a full-scale attack sweeping across nearby Beastman Tribes. However, at that time, he hadn’t thought about the aftermath of the battle, hence a lot of things were not prepared.\nFirst is the housing issue. The Dragon Nest Village has expanded several times, but those ten or so simple grass huts can only accommodate about two hundred orcs at most. For more, new houses have to be built, and even the walls surrounding the village need to be dismantled and rebuilt.\nIn the process of constructing new houses, Austin once again felt the difference between having discipline and lacking discipline.\nDue to time constraints, the task of building new houses initially involved the orc captives as well. However, instead of speeding up the construction, the orc captives ended up significantly lowering work efficiency.\nThe most fundamental reason for this is the lack of discipline.\nThe orc captives made a chaotic scene during construction, greatly hindering progress, which was in stark contrast to the cooperative building efforts of the Dragon Nest Tribe orcs.\n\"Indeed, orcs must go through the baptism of military training to clear away that idle and chaotic atmosphere before they can join the Dragon Nest Tribe.\"\nSeeing the situation where more people led to less power, the construction site of the Dragon Nest Tribe was in complete disarray, further solidifying Austin’s commitment to implement his military-government policy.\nUndisciplined orcs are just a pile of loose sand.\nPerhaps as development progresses, this kind of collective, military-civilian integrated system might limit the country’s further development, but at this initial stage, it’s the best development system.\n\"It seems we can only cooperate through division of labor.\"\nEventually, out of helplessness, Austin had to divide the orc captives into several groups, specifically tasked with chopping trees and transporting supplies, while the collaborative work of house construction was handed over to the more disciplined Dragon Nest Tribe orcs.\nIf other tribes were waging war, the victors would consider the losers as slaves, casually leaving them clustered in a corner. Issues like sanitation and housing needn’t be considered. They’d squeeze them relentlessly in peacetime, and then gather them as cannon fodder in wartime.\nThus, no pressure would arise, but Austin’s Dragon Nest Tribe is not comparable to the other Beastman Tribes within the Kawa Great Forest.\nCaptives are seen as expendables in other Beastman Tribes, while in Austin’s view, they are invaluable assets.\nIt’s not out of some saintly sentiment, but rather that by integrating captives into the Dragon Nest Tribe system after military training, forming a collaborative military-civilian group, it can achieve maximum efficiency in both warfare and production, which is incomparable to the backward driving methods of other tribes.\nThe increase in the number of orcs brought numerous troubles to the Dragon Nest Tribe,\nChaos abounds in aspects like discipline, sanitation, and housing, and besides these, there’s one extraordinary trouble.\nThat trouble is food.\nOrcs naturally have little leftover food stored, especially not two months after a cold winter. After annihilating those few Beastman Tribes, the collected food was only enough to sustain the orc captives for a few days.\nEven though the Dragon Nest Tribe has always had food surpluses, the hunting activities over these two months have turned a large amount of prey into cured meat, along with gathering fruits and roots from outside, there’s enough to sustain the Dragon Nest Tribe orcs for several months.\nBut once the Dragon Nest Tribe’s population surged five to six times, that little food became insufficient.\nThe herd of wild oxen raised by the Minotaur Tribe is ultimately an exception, moreover, those wild oxen not only need to be used as labor for pioneering agriculture in the future, Austin even considers establishing a Cow Cavalry Corps in the absence of Snow Wolf Cavalry, thus the wild oxen cannot be moved.\nThus, even if the Dragon Nest Tribe’s animal husbandry has already seen some achievements, it’s still insufficient for the massive food shortage.\n\"The orc captives need to undergo the baptism of military training, inevitably shortening the time for out collecting food. Besides, the territory within a ten-mile radius can barely sustain two hundred inhabitants, looks like we can only expand outward... It’s inevitable then, luckily the Extraordinary Dragon Vein Beastmen have already taken shape, their combat power has greatly increased, so there’s no need to overly worry about safety...\"\nWhen Dragon Vein Beastmen appeared, Austin launched a war in a moment of impulse, beginning to expand blindly, without anticipating the bitter outcomes that followed.\n\"Sigh, I was too rash back then.\"\nAs Austin was worried and racking his brains to solve the food issue for the orc tribe, even preparing to use Dragon Vein Beastmen as the core to explore farther areas, a piece of good news arrived, thoroughly solving his current concerns.\nAfter about a month and a half of planting, the first plot of land reclaimed by the river plain can finally be harvested!\nPerhaps it’s related to the different Otherworld kudzu, or maybe the Magic Power contained in the air sped up kudzu’s growth, in any case, the kudzu in the first reclaimed plot of land finally grew successfully.\nIn the field, the once green vines winding along the branches had now turned slightly yellow, many leaves started falling, sporadically.\nThe whole field, originally lush and green like a summer forest, overnight changed to a scene of autumn desolation.\nAnd this change also signifies that the kudzu buried in the soil is ready for harvest.\nThe first reclaimed plot of land is not far from the Dragon Nest Village. Stepping out of the village’s gate, walking southwest for about a mile, you can see a winding river, and the first plot of land sits beside it.\nThe harvest day stirred the whole Dragon Nest Tribe.\nBig and small orcs gathered by the field, craning their necks to watch.\nEven the orc captives undergoing training stole a rare moment of leisure, following the official members of the Dragon Nest Tribe, gathering by the field to watch the excitement.\nOn this significant day with special meaning, the orc instructors also ran to watch the excavation scene.\nAmong the anticipation of all, Vinek and others wiped their hands, grabbing wooden shovels, and dug in.\nAll the orcs held their breath, wanting to know whether the farming plan was a success or failure, no one knew in advance,\nwhether the efforts of more than a month were wasted or worthwhile.\nAs the shovel went down,\neverything was about to be revealed.",

      "content": "Chapter 68: Chapter 66: Great Harvest\nThe success of pioneer agriculture largely determines the future direction of the Dragon Grass Tribe’s development.\nThe current primitive hunting and gathering lifestyle within the Kawa Great Forest can scarcely support the numerous large tribes, capable of hosting over a hundred thousand beastmen, which generally resides at the borders where the Kawa Great Forest meets human territory.\nThis is because the beastman’s backward production methods are utterly incapable of supporting populations over a hundred thousand. The large beastman tribes at the borders exist because they invade human realms during the cold winter to loot enough food to sustain themselves.\nIf the attempt at pioneer agriculture fails, even though Austin has quite a few tricks up his sleeve, lacking sufficient food supply makes it even more troublesome to increase the population of beastman clans under his command.\nEven though the growth of kudzu during the pioneer planting process has been consistently smooth, and under careful nurturing, its exuberance cannot be compared to wild kudzu, but until the outcome is truly revealed, no one knows.\nAs Vini swung the spade down, all the surrounding beastmen spectators held their breath.\nHis hands gripping the wooden spade trembled a bit, but he still stomped firmly, causing the spade to deeply penetrate the soil, and then he levered the wooden handle downward.\nCrunch!\nA crisp muffled sound came from the soil, and simultaneously Vini felt resistance, as if there were a huge wooden root beneath the soil. But under the beastman’s strength, this resistance was negligible, and soon a large clump of soil was turned over.\nAlong with it appeared a kudzu root, broken at the tip, about one decimeter long, and the size of an arm!\nSuccess!\nAll the beastmen in attendance widened their eyes, gazing at the huge kudzu root picked up by Vini, with expressions ranging from excitement to awe.\nSeveral nearby beastmen couldn’t help but take tools to dig along a row of land, as the soil turned over and one kudzu root after another was unearthed, the surrounding beastmen’s atmosphere became more fervent and finally erupted into excitement.\n\"As expected from His Highness Austin, it truly worked!\"\n\"It’s really possible; I’ll work hard in the future pioneering so we won’t lack food anymore!\"\nFood issues are a sore point for every beastman struggling to survive within the Kawa Great Forest. Among the beastmen present, who hasn’t faced days without harvest and gone hungry?\nThough beasts’ heads are simple, it doesn’t mean they don’t understand the significance of this large batch of kudzu roots before them.\nPreviously requiring traversing mountains and waters to find, where it might be there one day and gone the next, but now it can be gathered and planted on a plot of land, producing consistently; planting kudzu here each time could mean a fixed food source?\nMoreover, with just a small segment of land excavated, there’s already this huge pile of kudzu roots dug out; both in size and yield far exceeds that of wild kudzu, looking at this vast kudzu patch, if it’s entirely excavated, imagine how great the harvest would be!\nSeeing this, the spectating beastmen couldn’t help but start grabbing tools and joining in the excavation of the kudzu roots, working energetically and enthusiastically.\nWith the beastmen’s excavation, the kudzu roots on the clearing piled up higher and higher, nearly forming a small hill; when all 20 acres are fully excavated, it indeed has become a small mountain.\nThe output from the 20 acres of pioneer land roughly estimated at about ten thousand pounds, with a per-acre yield of five to six hundred pounds.\nThis output is several times less than the kudzu’s two thousand pounds per acre yield in Austin’s past life, but kudzu seeds then were specially cultivated with various fertilizers incomparable to the rudimentary planting conditions now.\nFurthermore, in his previous life, from planting to harvesting took nearly half a year, whereas here in Otherworld, it only takes about a month and a half, incomparable.\nThe kudzu roots grown here, through concentrated planting and care, yield several times more than wild kudzu roots.\nIf venturing out to gather, even if the entire Dragon Nest Tribe spent a whole month dedicated to digging wild kudzu roots across mountain ranges in dozens of kilometers, it might still not reach ten thousand pounds in quantity.\nBut now, merely 20 acres have produced this quantity of kudzu roots; how could the beastmen not be astonished?\nFurthermore, after pioneering this piece of land, future kudzu planting would no longer require such exhaustive Kung Fu as at the start.\nCalculating in this way, even if beastmen were simple-minded, they’d deeply understand that the food obtained through pioneer planting is far superior to gathering food outside.\n\"Success!\"\nSeeing the beastmen on the field plunged into celebration and the kudzu roots piled like a mountain beside, the Blue Young Dragon couldn’t help but exhale lightly.\nCoupled with the hunted meat and various wild fruits and seeds collected, the beastmen in the Dragon Nest Tribe each consume about one to two pounds of kudzu root daily.\nOf course, if they’d only eat kudzu roots each day, probably each would consume around three pounds daily, but given the current strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe, alongside raising wild rabbits and wild pigs, they won’t run out of hunted food every day.\nCalculating like this, the twenty acres, with around ten thousand pounds of kudzu root output, can sustain the Dragon Nest Tribe’s seven hundred members for about ten days, and if the beastmen’s rations can be compressed, even up to twenty days.\nAnd this is just the output from the first 20-acre pioneering land!\nAs of now, under Austin’s command, the Dragon Nest Tribe has pioneered around one hundred and fifty acres of land.\nDue to the relation of pioneering followed by planting, the planting time for each plot varies; the next batch of around thirty acres of pioneering land kudzu roots will ripen in about ten days or so.\nThus calculated, with sequential planting on the one hundred and fifty acres of pioneer land, the kudzu output will be sufficient to sustain the entire Dragon Nest Tribe’s beastmen.\nThis food crisis has thus been entirely resolved.\nNevertheless, Austin will not halt the pioneering land work.\nAlthough the current one hundred and fifty acres’ yield can sustain the increasing population of beastmen in the Dragon Nest Tribe, following this grain incident, Austin has decided to store food in large quantities.\nBefore initiating the next war to annex other tribes, it’s crucial to ensure sufficient food is budgeted in the warehouse to prevent a scenario of population surging causing food shortage.\nMoreover, with the population of the Dragon Nest Tribe growing, labor force has increased, speeding up the pioneering work by the beastmen, thus producing more land and subsequently more food.",

      "content": "Chapter 69: Chapter 67: Results\nPreviously, due to food issues, Austin had to pause the momentum of clearing nearby tribes, something he hadn’t foreseen at the time.\nA mistake made once should not be repeated. Austin has decided to consolidate the foundation within the next month, integrating the beastman captives into the Dragon Nest Tribe’s system, greatly expanding farmland to plant kudzu. Only when the troops are well-prepared and the granaries full, will they attack again.\nThe first plot of farmland had a bountiful harvest, which was unimaginable excitement for the entire Dragon Nest Tribe. If reality were a game, the morale +100 would be visible on the game panel.\nMotivated by the agricultural harvest, the beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe have shown immense enthusiasm in both training and fieldwork these days. With such high work efficiency, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe is transforming day by day.\nThe training of beastman captives, village expansions, and farmland development are all proceeding at a brisk pace.\nAside from the kudzu harvest, Austin also hasn’t forgotten to check the results of wild rice cultivation in the wetlands where beastmen are planting them.\nInitially, Austin replaced wild rice with kudzu in the first farmland plot for various reasons, but this doesn’t mean he completely abandoned wild rice cultivation.\nAt the time, Austin had the beastmen remove weeds from the wetlands where wild rice grew and sowed wild rice seeds. Now that kudzu is ready for harvest, the rice should soon follow.\nSure enough, as Austin expected, when he and several beastmen arrived at those wetlands, they saw that the rice leaves had already begun to spike and fill. Although not yet ready to harvest, they were close, and it had only been about a month and a half since the wild rice seeds were sown.\nThis unusual growth cycle of crops in the Otherworld contradicts the cycles of Austin’s previous life, but considering the entirely different seasonal climates of the two worlds, it’s understandable.\nHowever, the rice yield is not high, roughly thirty to forty pounds per acre, far less compared to the yield of kudzu.\nAlthough rice contains more starch and energy than kudzu, at least rice can potentially serve as a staple food, while kudzu cannot.\nAustin was not too satisfied with the rice output, yet it was as expected.\nMoreover, he already had plans on how to increase rice yield.\nAfter harvesting the wild rice, Austin would set up a trial field and have beastmen carefully nurture the rice, selecting the rice with the most spikes and fullest grains as seeds for the next planting in the trial field.\nThrough generations of selection and elimination, improving the rice seeds manually would enhance the yield of wild rice through seed quality optimization.\nWhile much of Austin’s high school knowledge has faded, he still remembers these basic seed cultivation methods.\nOf course, this primitive method requires ten or even twenty years to genuinely domesticate these wild rice and increase yield; it cannot be rushed.\nAlthough manual seed improvement takes a lot of time, it’s essential to do these things, and the earlier they are done, the more beneficial it is for future development.\nThis method of improvement is also applicable to kudzu, which Austin plans to apply since the current yield is far from its potential.\nDuring each harvest, Austin plans to select the strongest and highest-yielding kudzu vines from the fields for replanting.\nThus, while improving these wild kudzu vines, they also produce a considerable amount of food, solving the Dragon Nest Tribe’s food shortage.\nHaving made up his mind, Austin assigned Quik to handle this task.\nAs the leader of the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin can’t personally attend to every detail, hence delegating tasks to others is the way to go.\nAfter assessing the rice growth and giving instructions, Austin spread his wings and flew back towards the Dragon Nest.\nSoaring high in the sky, the fierce winds blew past him. Looking down from above, he saw plots of newly developed farmland radiating from the cliff where the Dragon Nest was located.\nTo prevent soil erosion from excessive deforestation, every farmland plot was separated by a stretch of forest ten to twenty meters wide, creating a picturesque view from above.\nIn the fields, beastmen, as small as ants, labored away. The trees felled during development were piled together, emitting white smoke from burning.\nAround, on the flatlands, captive beastmen stood motionless, receiving military training from Dragon Vein Beastmen.\nAt the foot of the cliff, houses were rising one after another. Although the beastmen’s craftsmanship was not too refined, it gave the village a primitive and rugged appeal.\nThis is the result of Austin’s efforts over the past six months.\nAlthough the strength of the Clan Tribe is still somewhat small now, it has achieved self-sufficiency and autonomous development.\nFurthermore, Austin believes that one day the entire clan will grow into a towering tree, becoming his greatest protector.\n\"Next, it’s time for the tribe’s development plan.\"\nReturning to the Dragon Nest, Austin began to contemplate the next steps.\n\"The food problem is basically solved, but the land development must continue... Hmm... The captive beastmen can train while developing land. With the growth cycle of kudzu, in a month or two, food will no longer be an issue... The war to annex other beastman tribes must continue, set for a month from now. This time, there’s no need to mobilize the entire army.\"\nWith the success of land development, removing the food constraint, the main theme of the Dragon Nest Tribe will be\nWar! War! War!\nWar sustained by war, never-ending warfare.\nThis time, the war will not only annex the remaining tribes from last time, but after gathering enough military strength, Austin plans to wipe out the largest nearby Jackal Wolfman Tribe in one go, to seize the possible presence of the Breathing Technique.\nWith the Breathing Technique, the Dragon Nest Tribe’s strength will significantly escalate, ultimately preparing for another cleansing operation in the Spider Cave.\nAfter finalizing the plan, the whole Dragon Nest Tribe entered a latent farming phase, intensely practicing inner power, while integrating the captive beastmen and aggressively developing farmland.\nA month slipped by in the blink of an eye.\nDuring this time, nearly six hundred beastman captives had been integrated into the Dragon Nest Tribe, and the developed farmlands had advanced significantly, with rabbit and wild boar farming also starting to produce meat.\nThe war annexation plan has entered the second stage.",

      "content": "Chapter 70: Chapter 68 Ratman Priest\nIn the middle of a plain, tall thatches stretched into a dense patch, obscuring the field. The thick and continuous root system had almost taken away all the survival resources, making it impossible even for trees to grow here.\nThe edge of each blade of thatch was as sharp as a knife, a careless touch could cut the skin. Even herbivores disliked these spiky thatch leaves and stayed far away to forage elsewhere.\nAs a result, this field of thatch became the sturdiest barrier for the tribe of mouse-people living here.\nThe tall thatch leaves stood upright, the mouse-people stood within, their figures completely obscured by the tall leaves. The dense thickets, which might be an obstacle for others, were like a fish to water for the mouse-people.\nThe root system of the thatch provided food for the mouse-people, and the leaves could help them block their enemies from chasing. All along, this group of mouse-people lived steadily here, with a population steadily increasing, reaching over three hundred.\nThe vast thatch plain had always allowed the mouse-people to live securely, without being overly concerned about the threat of external enemies, but recently, the leadership of the mouse-people tribe found themselves plunged into panic.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe had been sweeping through nearby beastman tribes extensively. Naturally, the mouse-people couldn’t be oblivious to this, and it was precisely for this reason that the mouse-people were thrown into a state of terror.\nOne tribe after another was ravaged and destroyed, flames rising high into the sky with thick smoke, leaving their settlements in ruins. Rows of beastmen were tied up and taken prisoner, lined up and marched toward the distance.\nThe \"marauders\" jubilantly turned the remaining traces into ashes.\nThe fate of the beastmen after being captured was clearly understood by the mouse-people, even if they hadn’t personally experienced it. It was undoubtedly a difficult situation with a slim chance of survival.\n\"What should we do? Another tribe was just wiped out by those marauders. I saw Hada and the others captured with my own eyes. Are we just going to sit here and do nothing?\"\nAt the center of the thatch plain, beneath a constructed grass nest, a mouse-man paced back and forth, panic-stricken, his face full of terror.\n\"If not, what do you propose we do? Those marauders’ power is something we cannot withstand. Are you suggesting we go out and fight them?\"\n\"I don’t mean that, but at least we should make some preparations.\"\n\"There’s no need to fear, with the great Beast God’s protection, those marauders can’t invade.\"\nThe entire great thatch plain was an inherent barrier for the mouse-people. During the development of the mouse-people tribe, it had stopped countless enemies and predators, so some mouse-people, although afraid of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s actions, were not overly terrified.\n\"But I’ve heard the leader of those thief marauders is a dragon. In the face of a dragon, not even the gifts from the Beastman Emperor can hold up!\"\nInside the central house of the mouse-people tribe, chaos immediately ensued, with mouse-people chirping and panicking.\n\"Enough!\"\nAt that moment, the Ratman Priest sitting above slammed the scepter in his hand, which was as tall as a person and had a red crystal embedded at the top, and the beastmen below instantly fell silent.\nThe Ratman Priest glanced around, coughed lightly, and slowly spoke:\n\"The Giant Dragon Race is truly a race blessed by heaven, immensely powerful, but it’s just a still-growing Young Dragon, and we’re not that bad. Not to mention we are favored by the Beast God, even the Sacred Artifact in my hand can give that Young Dragon a tough fight.\"\nThe Ratman Priest shook the scepter in his hand, and the red crystal on top immediately flashed with a dark red light, like a Demon God lurking in the abyss casting them a gaze, making all the mouse-people feel a chill down their spine.\n\"Blessed be His Majesty the Beast God, thank you for your mercy...\"\nThe mouse-people immediately bent down, lowered their heads, and sang hymns of praise.\nThe Ratman Priest, seeing this, maintained an aloof demeanor, but inwardly felt a subtle sense of pride.\nIn fact, the reason he could become the Ratman Priest was simply because he found a red crystal in some unnamed ruins and could summon fireballs from it, which he used to demonstrate miracles and set himself above his tribe, becoming the Ratman Priest.\nHe did not possess any of the skills that a real Beastman Priest should master, such as medical care, communication with the Divine, and spell-casting.\nThat’s why, actually, this Ratman Priest still held some fear toward the Blue Young Dragon that occasionally soared through the skies, only comforting himself that since the mouse-people were active under the thatch plain, the dragon might not discover them, hoping nothing would happen.\nWith the worship of the mouse-people before him, the Ratman Priest was filled with a surge of grandeur.\n\"If that little Young Dragon dares to invade our territory, I will give them a lesson they won’t forget!\"\nThe Ratman Priest’s tone was filled with authority, his voice firm and resounding.\nAt the same time, a visible wave of magic power rippled and spread in all directions. The dark red light in the red crystal on the scepter flowed like lava, gathering at its center, raising the temperature of the entire space, as if the next moment it would spew out scorching flames to engulf everything before it.\nWith the scepter in a semi-activated state in his hand, the Beastman Priest felt emboldened.\nIndeed, with the Sacred Artifact in hand,\nand so many of his kin here, what should one small dragon be afraid of!\nThe Beastman Priest spoke in a manner even he seemed to believe, his voice booming with bravado.\nHowever, the next moment,\nBOOM!!!\nThe ground suddenly shook, as if awakened by an enraged dragon, sending the mouse-people inside the house almost tumbling.\n\"An earthquake?\"\nThe mouse-people were filled with uncertainty,\nSWOOSH!\nSuddenly, a visible torrent swept down from the sky, the entire thatch house seemed to be caught in a level twelve storm, teetering precariously.\nThe next moment, two sinister scaled giant claws suddenly descended, tearing through the thick layers of thatch, ripping the entire roof apart like it was made of paper.\nThe entire roof was lifted and flung away inch by inch under an overwhelming force, with blades of thatch swept into the air like dark clouds blotting out the sky.\n\"This!!!\"\nThe mouse-people, terrified, looked up, stunned by the horrifying scene, while the Ratman Priest’s mind went blank, losing the ability to speak.\n\"A group of little mice...\"\nAnd at this moment, a grand, imperious voice rang out from the void.\nOn the now bare roof, an enormous and sinister head peered in from the sky, looking down at them all.\n\"I just felt a surge of magic power. Was that you, little mice?\"\nIn a voice ancient and stern, those blood-red eyes swept over all the frozen mouse-people, finally landing on the red crystal on the Ratman Priest’s scepter.",

      "content": "Chapter 71: Chapter 69 Magic Artifact\nThe whole room was deathly silent, and the surrounding ratmen looked at the huge head above, feeling their limbs stiffened and unable to move.\nTo talk about it, the reason Austin discovered this ratman tribe and appeared here was entirely because the Beastman Priest had previously flaunted the use of the \"Sacred Artifact,\" thus attracting him over.\nWith the mobilization of the Dragon Nest Tribe, a large number swept through the nearby Beastman tribes, bringing disaster to the surrounding tribes.\nOne Beastman tribe after another was conquered, and many Beastman captives were taken to the Dragon Nest Territory, leading to a rapid increase in the population of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThe fires of war were raging in the surrounding tribes, and with the ongoing sweep, the Dragon Nest Tribe began to expand rapidly through annexing other tribes, swelling its population.\nDuring this war, the Dragon Nest Tribe originally had nine Dragon Vein Attendants among the Beastmen, and with nearly six hundred Beastman captives later annexed, the current strength of the Dragon Nest Legion could easily defeat local tribes even without Austin sitting in the central army.\nBecause of this, after easily sweeping away several tribes, Austin planned to let them act on their own while he flew high and began exploring outward.\nOriginally, this ratman tribe was covered with tall thatch, and the houses were built with a large amount of thatch, making it really hard to detect if one stumbled carelessly.\nBut as he flew, suddenly Austin sensed a wave of magic power coming from below. Although it was weak, in a world of magical dead silence within a few miles, that wave was like a beacon in the dark night, drawing Austin over.\nThat’s why the previous scene happened.\nTo say this, blame the Beastman Priest, for if he hadn’t activated the scepter’s power, how would it attract Austin over?\n\"Is it that one?\"\nAustin’s gaze focused on the scepter beside the Beastman Priest, and his keen senses told him that the wave of magic power earlier was caused by that Red Crystal!\n\"Little mouse, was that magic wave earlier something you created?\"\nAustin turned his gaze, focusing on the Ratman Priest.\n\"Not me, I didn’t say anything, I don’t know.\"\nThe Ratman Priest’s mind went blank, and in a panic, the words suddenly blurted out.\nAustin: \"....\"\nAll ratmen: \"....\"\nAt this moment, the Ratman Priest finally reacted, panicked, raising the scepter, visibly seen red glow rippling out, the fire attribute magic power in the air began to gather like a tide toward the Red Crystal under an absorbing force.\nIn extreme fear, the Ratman Priest accidentally activated the scepter in his hand, and his blank mind couldn’t even think.\nThe next moment,\nFlame Flame Flame!!!\nA massive flame burst forth out of nothing in the air, roaring and crashing upward, sweeping all the heat around, carrying a terrifying force and crashing toward Austin.\nThe terrifying heat twisted the air, sweeping in, and all the ratmen present gave birth to hope in that moment.\nSurely worthy of Priest, even facing the giant dragon without any fear!\nThis mere dragon, how could it be a match for Priest and the Sacred Artifact!\nFacing the incoming fireball, Austin reached out his paw, grabbing toward the giant fireball.\nBoom!!!\nInstantaneously, just like bursting a balloon, the giant fireball was immediately crushed between the giant claws, and fiery serpents shot out from between the claws, then dissipated into nothingness in the air.\nInstantly, all the ratmen were like ducks with their necks pinched, unable to make a sound.\n\"It’s a nice thing, I can tell you don’t know any real magic; this fireball relies on that Red Crystal to be activated, doesn’t it?\"\nAustin shook his head, snorted, the scales in his paw visibly scorched black, its power seeming unimpressive.\nDespite this, Austin could clearly feel that from the momentum of the magic power gathering, the power of the fireball fired was certainly not weak, just reduced when reaching Austin due to the Ratman Priest’s lack of control during its flight.\n\"Little mouse, are you going to rebel against me?\"\nAustin fixed his eyes on the Ratman Priest, his voice echoing in the air eerily.\n\"No no no, I didn’t mean it, Your Highness spare me, please show mercy...\"\nThe Ratman Priest loosened his grip on the scepter, both legs weak, directly kneeling on the ground.\nWhat have I done!!!\nOverwhelming fear surged in his heart, the Ratman Priest continually kowtowed begging for mercy, his whole body trembling.\n\"Sacred Artifact, right, Sacred Artifact! Giants love shiny things!\"\nSuddenly thinking of something, the Ratman Priest hurriedly picked up the scepter from the ground, raised it high with both hands.\nThe surrounding ratmen had already been stunned by the change, as the Ratman Priest knelt down, under the frightening dragon might, all the ratmen were crawling on the ground, trembling horribly, ratmen were naturally timid, even more so than kobolds, seeing the Priest’s attack didn’t have any effect, everyone was scared out of their wits.\nAustin remained noncommittal, extending his paw to grab the scepter, bringing its fist-sized, smooth Red Crystal to his face for careful examination.\nWith sharp magical perception, he naturally knew that the wooden stick was just a random decoration, the true effect was caused by the dark red glowing Red Crystal.\nThrough the flashing light inside, Austin clearly sensed a profound mysterious magic rune hidden in the core of the glow, with strands of fire attribute magic power automatically gathering into the Red Crystal, as if automatically charging.\nThis Red Crystal probably resembles a magical artifact.\nThus, even ordinary Beastmen could use it to generate fireballs, although the power didn’t differ much from a fireball technique cast by a basic mage.\nTo truly utilize its effect, it should be handed to a mage-type extraordinary, even a mage just stepping in without learning much else, as long as they can spiritually control the aggregation of fire attribute magic, they can genuinely utilize its effect.\nIn Yi Austin’s view, if handed to a magic extraordinary, what the Red Crystal would activate wouldn’t be a fireball technique, but a flame burst technique.\n\"Interesting...\"\nAfter observing it closely for a while, thinking for a moment, he already had a suitable candidate for ownership of the scepter in his heart.\n\"Little mouse, tell me, where did you get this thing?\"\nAustin turned his gaze back to the Ratman Priest, his voice filled with undeniable authority.",

      "content": "Chapter 72: Chapter 70 Shock\n\"Y-Y-Your Highness...\"\nThe Ratman Priest stammered as he recounted the origins of the red crystal.\nIt turned out that during one of his trips for food gathering, the Ratman Priest accidentally fell from a high mountain into a cliffside valley.\nLuckily, he was fortunate enough that the branches and leaves cushioned his fall, allowing him to survive with only minor injuries.\nWhile trying to find a way back from the valley, the Ratman Priest discovered a hidden, spiraling cave entrance nestled among the grass. Driven by curiosity, he entered the cave and discovered a spacious area inside.\nInside that space, there were several large stone tables covered with dusty, peculiar bottles and jars, and some sheets of beast-skin parchment. The corners were piled with white bones, making the whole space appear quite eerie.\nThe Ratman Priest was a bit afraid at that time, and coupled with his injuries, he randomly took a piece of glowing red crystal and left.\nLater on, the Ratman Priest figured out how to use the red crystal and fooled a group of Ratmen, becoming the priest of the Ratman tribe.\n\"Oh, do you still remember the way to that place?\"\nUpon hearing this, Austin’s interest was piqued, and he hurriedly asked.\nFalling off a cliff but surviving, discovering treasures in a cave, and thus embarking on a path to greatness.\nThis scenario... why does it seem a bit familiar?\n\"Uh, Your Highness, I remember, but later on, I went back to the valley intending to see if there were other good things inside. At that time, a Centaur Tribe occupied the nearby mountain range and settled around the cliff near the valley. I didn’t dare to risk going through several times.\"\nThe Ratman Priest answered honestly.\nAccording to his observations, the Centaur Tribe probably settled near the valley for its favorable environment because he hadn’t seen any Centaur venture to the bottom of the cliff. If they had discovered the cave, things wouldn’t have been so calm.\nThis was sheer bad luck for him. After assessing the strength of the Centaur Tribe, the Ratman Priest gave up on the place entirely.\n\"Very good, from this moment on, you all belong to me, understand?\"\nAustin glanced at all the Ratmen lying on the ground, his thunderous voice echoing in the air.\n\"U-Understood...\"\nThe Ratmen’s status in this world is similar to that of the Kobold, one of the lowest races of Beastmen on the Seta Continent. Assessing situations and taking appropriate actions are what they excel in.\n\"Stay here and tidy your belongings. Soon, someone will come for you, and as for you, follow me.\"\nThere were only about a dozen high-ranking Ratmen in the room. Due to the commotion caused by Austin’s strong landing, the surrounding Ratmen scattered everywhere, with even the braver ones shivering under the thatched roofs, staring at the massive shadow.\nAustin wasn’t worried about whether these Ratmen would run away afterwards. He had already gauged their courage, and besides, the biggest value of the tribe for Austin was the red crystal and the information about the cave at the base of the cliff.\nIn comparison, the population of three hundred Ratmen was important, but the matter of the Ratman Priest was evidently more crucial.\nThe cave might just be a remnant laboratory of a Mage.\nAustin extended his massive claw, and before the Ratman Priest could react, he was snatched up and held in his palm.\nThen, spreading his wings, Austin took to the sky.\nThe massive membranous wings blocked the sky, generating a huge current, and his entire body soared into the air, leaving the Ratmen Tribe in growing panic below.\nThe fierce wind blew by his side as the poor Ratman Priest, clutched under Austin’s claw, was already scared limp in the high sky. Looking down at the distance, his little mouse heart was almost about to burst with fear, forcing him to keep his eyes tightly shut.\nAfter about ten to twenty minutes, Austin finally descended from the sky.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe, arrived!\n\"One-two-one, one-two-one... transform well, remake as Beastmen... serve His Highness...\"\nAs the speed decreased, the Ratman Priest began to hear loud chants coming from below, one slogan after another rose into the air, even overpowering the sound of wind rushing past his ears.\nUnable to hold back, the Ratman Priest opened his eyes, and his entire mouse head was stupefied.\nBelow, a vast field, piece by piece of land cleared by manpower, stretched orderly across the landscape. Green vines completely covered the area. Although the Ratman Priest didn’t know what it was, for the first time witnessing such human-altered nature, he felt like he was facing a tidal wave of an impact.\nAt the same time, on the open plains, Beastmen held their heads high, forming neat squares, marching, standing still, and practicing spear thrusts, with all sorts of drills going smoothly. The battle cries soared to the heavens. Even though the Ratman Priest didn’t understand, he could feel the mighty military aura rising fiercely.\nIn fact, what the Ratman Priest didn’t know was that many of the Beastmen training below were captives recently captured from other tribes.\nWith the mass reformation works underway, the clan members of the Dragon Nest Tribe had already found a series of methods to quickly and effectively reform the captives, teaching them basic commands and maintaining a proper military formation in no time.\nThe skies were clear, and looking down, the entire tribe was bustling with activity, teeming with vibrant life.\nBut all this wasn’t what shocked the Ratman Priest the most. The greatest surprise was the orderly and well-established village in the center.\nAmong continuous wooden structures stood a tall, two-story building constructed with \"stone\"!\nA building made of such \"stone,\" which the Ratman Priest had never seen since birth, but he knew that having a stone house was a symbol of a tribe’s wealth and strength!\nAt a rough glance, there were at least over a thousand Beastmen walking around near the village.\nFrom the moment he opened his eyes to now, everything he saw had left the Ratman Priest with his mouth agape in shock.\nDescending, Austin was naturally unaware of the Ratman’s thoughts. If he knew, he would only find it amusing.\nCountry bumpkin is truly a country bumpkin.\nThose aren’t stones, just bricks that have been fired.\nThe Goblins assigned to the manufacturing workshop seemed to have unlocked some skill. Throughout continual production, their various crafts improved rapidly. Not long ago, they successfully fired bricks according to Austin’s description and used them to establish a \"City Hall,\" which was the \"stone\" building that had such an impact on the Ratman Priest.",

      "content": "Chapter 73: Chapter 72: Scepter Ownership\nWith the development of the Dragon Nest Tribe, the tools consumed by the entire tribe daily have also increased significantly. In response, a dedicated manufacturing workshop has been set up, with fifty goblins to barely meet the orcs’ work and house construction needs.\nPerhaps some hidden conditions were unlocked, or maybe goblins have a natural talent for manufacturing. From initially being somewhat clumsy in making simple wooden spear tools, they have now evolved to be able to autonomously create new tools and crops based on Austin’s scant guidance.\nThe bricks used in building the \"Municipal Center\" were fired by the goblins in the manufacturing workshop according to some information provided by Austin. Besides bricks, the goblins have also successfully fired pottery, greatly facilitating the daily lives of the orcs in the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nMoreover, when making wooden spears and stone tools, the goblins developed some new grinding tools, such as grinding wheels, to save labor, which significantly improves the efficiency of various manufacturing tasks.\nFor the goblins’ spirit of invention and creation, Austin is quite appreciative. During inspections, he not only praised the person in charge of the manufacturing workshop in person but also encouraged them to be innovative and to foster a spirit of active exploration.\nWhaclalal!!!\nA huge gust of wind swirled in the high sky, and Austin descended from the sky, holding the stunned Ratman Priest, landing in the large stone-brick-paved square.\nDue to the rainy and hot climate of the Kawa Great Forest, the ground is often muddy. Thus, once the bricks were fired, Austin ordered the orcs to pave the village with stone bricks to improve sanitation and civic appearance.\nNow, the open space in front of the village houses is only about halfway paved, but it already forms a tidy square.\n\"Your Highness Blue Dragon, you have returned.\"\nAs Austin landed, the orcs working around busily saluted quickly, and the village chief Kobold Vini also ran over swiftly.\n\"Hmm, take this guy away, and then send someone to the east. After crossing twenty-three mountains, you’ll see a mountain resembling an Ox Head Peak. On the opposite side of Ox Head Mountain, there’s a plain covered with thatched grass. Send someone to take over the Ratman Tribe there.\"\nAustin threw the Ratman Priest to the ground and instructed Vini to take over the Ratman Tribe. As for whether the Ratmen would resist, given Austin’s previous imposing entry, the Ratmen’s courage had already been scared away, so there probably wouldn’t be any issues.\n\"Also, go call Quik for me; I have something to discuss with him. Meanwhile, prepare an army and try to bring all my Dragon Vein Attendants. I want to personally lead an expedition against a Centaur Tribe.\"\nSince Quik established the traditional Chinese herbal medicine treatment system, he has been taking a few orcs to collect various plants all over the mountains whenever he has time and has set up a simple hospital within the tribe. Of course, the injured orcs are temporarily afraid to enter, but they have no choice.\nAfter turning Quik into a Dragon Vein Beastman, his perception and mental abilities seemed to have greatly improved. Although the hospital can only treat a few simple illnesses temporarily, with the orcs’ \"selfless\" contributions as test subjects, records of various herbs’ properties are rapidly increasing, laying the groundwork. It’s believed that with more trials, this affordable and beneficial treatment system will ultimately be established.\nUpon receiving Austin’s orders, Vini started making arrangements swiftly.\nMeanwhile, Austin returned to the nest and began to examine the scepter in his claw meticulously.\nWithin the crimson crystal, brilliant red light flickered, with strands of light intertwined in the red glow, seemingly hiding very profound and mysterious magic runes.\nSuddenly, a thought arose in Austin’s mind.\nBuzz!\nA vibration suddenly spread through the air, with visible red light ripples expanding outwards in all directions.\nThe next moment,\nBoom!\nA massive fireball rose out of thin air, shot out swiftly, and hit one of the Dragon Nest’s walls with a bang.\nIn an instant, the entire Dragon Nest space seemed to be swept by flames, with the scorching heat filling the space until it vanished into nothingness.\nAs the firelight faded, there was only a black mark on the wall.\n\"What a shame, it’s just a little trinket...\"\nAustin shook his head slightly; this power was only one or two times stronger than the Ratman Priests, and it mainly lacked the mages’ ability to gather and bind the fireball through spiritual power, which resulted in too much Fire Attribute Magic Power and heat loss during flight.\nThis level of power is of no use to Austin, and it could only be given to some subordinate for use.\nDismissing the matter, Austin began to have the Ratman Priest brought over for a thorough interrogation.\nAfter extracting information about the Centaur Tribe and the cave from the Ratman Priest, Quik returned to the Dragon Nest Tribe, dusty, carrying a large basket.\n\"Your Highness, were you looking for me?\"\n\"Yes, I just received something good, take a look.\"\nAustin tossed the scepter directly to Quik.\n\"Your Highness, this is....\"\nQuik was puzzled at first, but upon sensing the magic power tremors from the red crystal at the scepter’s tip, his expression suddenly changed.\n\"It should be a kind of Demonic Artifact. Try it and see how powerful it is.\"\nQuik’s expression became serious as he used his spiritual power to activate the red crystal at the scepter’s tip.\nBuzz!!!\nRed ripples spread through the air, and at the same time, Austin sensed that the Fire Attribute Magic Power in the air was gathering under the operation of those mysterious runes.\nThe next moment,\nBoom!!!\nA huge fireball suddenly rose and shot out, hitting a pile of wood not far away.\nIn an instant, the whole pile of wood was blown apart and burned into ashes by the scorching flames, dissipating into the air.\n\"This.....!!!\"\nSeeing the fierce blaze ahead, Quik was also dumbfounded, speechless.\n\"Not bad, as a reward for your hard work these days, you can use this for now. I hope you don’t disappoint its power.\"\nPerhaps due to the spiritual power and mage tier differences, the power Quik unleashed was much stronger than Austin’s, although Austin sensed that it still fell short of the Fire Energy contained in a fully gathered fireball when it was at its peak.\nAfter all, Quik is not a true mage, only awakening his talents through transformation, and being able to exert half the power of the Flame Burst Technique is already quite good.\n\"Your Highness, thank you for your generosity.\"\nQuik held the scepter with an expression of excitement.",

      "content": "Chapter 74: Chapter 73: Leading the Troops to Battle\nAs one of the few wise men of the Dragon Nest Tribe, Quik knows very well that whether young or old, the Giant Dragon Race is naturally obsessed with wealth like gold coins and crystals, and he also knows how hard it is to take a single gold coin from a dragon’s side according to legend.\nAnd now, the honorable His Highness has handed him this scepter due to his somewhat unworthy efforts, which is a great honor to him.\nFor a moment, the Fox-faced Man was moved to tears, making Austin feel inexplicably surprised.\nSpeaking of which, if Austin could hear Quik’s thoughts, he would surely find it genuinely amusing.\nAlthough Austin is a dragon, he is actually a soul from the Otherworld, possessing various rich experiences from his previous life, and has no special feelings towards gold coins and crystals that cannot be eaten or worn now; at most, he feels that the Red Crystal is somewhat beautiful.\nIf a Red Crystal of little use could be used to significantly enhance the power of the Clan, Austin felt it was perfectly normal.\nAt least at this stage, Quik is the beastman who can exert the power of that magical artifact, the Red Crystal, the most in the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nNot long after, Vini had already mobilized an army according to Austin’s orders. With the rapid development of the Dragon Nest Tribe, each time they set out to clean up other tribes, they no longer need to mobilize all forces, and now having more manpower, the Dragon Nest Tribe can wage war while also developing production.\nWith a larger population, manpower mobilization has become easier. The army dispatched with Austin totals two hundred people, all of them elite fighters, with six out of nine Dragon Vein Attendants accompanying them, while three stay behind to guard against any attacks during Austin’s expedition.\nThis time, Austin intends to take the Fox-faced Man Quik along.\nNot only because this guy just got the Red Crystal Staff and wants to test Quik’s combat power after getting new equipment, but also because the Fox-faced Man has a broader knowledge base than ordinary beastmen, maybe knowing something about the things left in that cave.\nThe army was already assembled in the square, with orderly formations, without a hint of noise, resembling iron forged with strict discipline.\nWhen the Ratman Priest, carried by Austin, descended from high in the air, he suddenly saw these burly men standing in orderly rows silence, and the long spears glistening with sharpness, the scene of the army’s killing intent rising to the sky. The Ratman Priest was immediately shocked, staggering back and nearly falling.\nThe army accompanying this expedition is comprised of well-trained elites, hardened in wars of extermination.\nEven in Austin’s previous life, ordinary people who had never seen military formations would feel mentally impacted when suddenly encountering a well-trained iron-blooded army, let alone a Ratman Priest.\nThis kind of army, never seen before in the Otherworld, almost turned the world upside down for the Ratman.\n\"You did very well.\"\nAustin’s wings stirred up a mighty torrent, descending from the sky, while the beastman army stood still amidst the swirling air currents.\nLooking at these elites trained from ordinary beastmen, Austin felt somewhat satisfied.\nExcept for the initial period when Austin would support them, in the subsequent wars outside, Austin had completely handed over to them, and they lived up to his heavy expectations, continuously succeeding in annihilating several tribes and constantly plundering, gradually strengthening the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nWhat Austin wants in a Clan is a group that possesses both discipline and a wolf-like aggression, capable of plundering resources during his growth, with enough power to deal with various potential crises.\nHence, Austin has always emphasized cultivating the self-reliance of the Dragon Nest Tribe. Apart from some initial hands-on involvement, he left it to the beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe to develop independently, mainly controlling some directional issues himself.\nAnd now it seems, the results are indeed good.\nEven if Austin disappeared from now on, the Clan he left behind would continue to grow and prosper.\n\"My legion, move out with me!\"\nAustin waved his wings, grabbing the Ratman Priest and soaring into the sky.\nBehind him, units of silent elite beastman troops poured out, their orderly footsteps raising dust rolling towards the sky.\nAccording to the Ratman Priest, the cliff of that valley is somewhat distant. Although Austin alone could fly there from the sky in half a day, the beastman army below couldn’t fly, so it took them a day and a bit more time to get close to a mile away from the Centaur Tribe.\n\"Is that the valley?\"\nIn a certain mountain range, Austin looked at a distant cliff recess visible to the naked eye and asked the Ratman Priest beside him.\n\"Honorable His Highness Blue Dragon, that’s it. At the time, I fell down from there and discovered that cave.\"\nThe Ratman Priest gestured and explained beside him.\n\"It’s a pity that later the Centaur Tribe relocated to the nearby hillside, and those Centaurs often patrolled around, so I dared not approach it again.\"\nIn this world’s beastman breeds, Centaurs are considered a mid-tier race.\nAnd in this ruthless Kawa Great Forest, unless they’re from the same tribe, invading other tribal territories would mean direct attacks without a word, and being captured as slaves would be good compared to many who are killed instantly as enemies.\nNo wonder the Ratman Priest didn’t dare to have designs on the valley cliff again; the Ratmen are naturally timid, and timid ones tend to live longer.\nAustin flapped his wings, effortlessly ascending and landing on a giant ancient tree nearby, his form hidden among lush leaves, his eyes peering into the distance.\nWith good eyesight, he saw that group of Centaurs, seated on a mountainside thousands of meters away; clusters of huts appeared intermittently in the woods, flames rising, and the whole Centaur Tribe seemed to be dining.\n\"About three hundred in number, and they’re dining, so they’re all gathered inside the tribe, perfect opportunity!\"\nSince most Centaurs were gathered in the tribe, it gave Austin a chance to capture them all at once!\n\"Quik, number one, number two, take a hundred men for a frontal attack.\"\n\"Number three, number four, take fifty men to swing to the left, wait until Quik breaks through the Centaur Tribe from the front, then charge out.\"\n\"Number five, number six, also take fifty men to swing to the right...\"\nDescending from the tree, Austin began issuing orders to his beastman troops.",

      "content": "Chapter 75: Chapter 74 Charge\nNumbers One and Two are codenames given by Austin to the Dragon Vein Attendants for convenience in the army.\nAs Dragon Vein Attendants who have half-stepped into the domain of extraordinary power, they naturally don’t receive the same treatment as ordinary soldiers. In previous battles, they mostly played the role of leading the vanguard. One could say the army behind them mainly centered its tactics around supporting their combat.\nSoon, the troops split into three groups: one large and two smaller ones, according to Austin’s orders.\n\"Attack!\"\nWithout much delay, Austin directly ordered the army to attack.\nWith the strongest frontal force to crush the enemy, then the left and right wings strike forth, completely breaking the enemy’s morale. Leaving one side open in a three-sided encirclement, offering an escape to dissuade desperate resistance from the enemy, would eventually lead them to flee backwards in defeat.\nOf course, the so-called open side is impossible. When the demoralized centaurs flee to the rear, exhausted, Austin will personally appear, descending from the sky to subdue them decisively.\nThe Centaur Race holds a mid-tier position within the Beastman Race. Coupled with their running speed and stamina, if they eventually flee after defeat, Austin’s Clan troops would not be able to catch up.\nThe three-sided encirclement tactic is the best method Austin currently has to defeat and subdue this group of centaurs.\n\"What a pity. If I were already an adult, simply showing myself would likely have made this group of centaurs submit. Then again, if I were an adult, I wouldn’t need this Clan’s strength anyway.\"\nAustin sighed slightly.\nAdult dragons are essentially legendary level beings. Even without speaking, they would naturally gather a strong Clan of Beastmen who inherently admire strength. But before reaching adulthood, whether young or juvenile dragons can at best attract the favor of lower-tier beast races such as goblins and kobolds, while mid-tier races and above barely pay any attention.\nGiven Austin’s current strength, the chance of subduing the centaur tribe ahead without shedding a drop of blood is slim. This is why Austin intends to defeat them, completely shattering their morale before revealing himself.\nA troop defeated and fleeing is easiest to capture, and only when the centaurs lose all morale would there be a significant chance for Austin to subdue them.\nThinking too much is pointless. Austin lifted his body swiftly, concealing himself above the forest to carefully observe the battle and seek opportunity.\nPerhaps because the centaurs were gathered in the tribe for feeding, the first attacking team managed to sneak within two hundred meters of the centaur tribe before being discovered by a centaur who had just finished feeding.\n\"Enemies!\"\nThe orderly military formation moved silently under iron discipline, with long spears standing tall. Seeing the fully armed Beastman Legion approaching the tribe, that centaur naturally wouldn’t assume they came as guests.\nWith the centaur’s shout, the entire tribe erupted into commotion. Their ability to survive in the peril-ridden Kawa Great Forest itself spoke of their keen vigilance.\nThe centaurs hurriedly grabbed their weapons, noisily emerging from all around the village, faces grim as they prepared to give the audacious intruders a heavy blow.\n\"Charge! For the noble His Highness Austin!\"\nWith their exposure, the Beastman Legion no longer bothered to hide, directly shouting as they charged forth.\nThe sound rose to the heavens, as the Beastman Legion charged as a group, with no sign of disorder.\nMeanwhile, the first batch of centaurs rushed out from the tribe, wielding wooden spears and clubs in chaos, but full of momentum as they charged at the Dragon’s Nest Beastmen Legion.\nThe Beastman tribes living in the Kawa Great Forest exist in a primitive state of gatherer-hunter civilization. Food sources limit the tribe population size and hinder the development of metallurgy and ironworking skills. Copper and iron tools within Beastman tribes mainly come from the Human World, occasionally ending up in Beastmen hands.\nAs such, in the Kawa Great Forest, Beastmen tribes in hunting combat use primitive items like wooden spears and stone tools.\nYet, wooden spears do not equate to a lack of lethality. The raw material for wooden spears largely comes from a tree called hemlock, widely distributed in the forest. These trees are not only extremely hard but also straight and uniform, making them ideal for crafting wooden spears. Although inferior to real iron tools, when sharpened, they can easily penetrate an unprotected Beastman’s body with sufficient force, serving as a sharp weapon in Beastmen hunting and combat.\nCentaurs are large in stature, taller than common kobolds by half a body, and when they charge, they stir up a cloud of dust. Though not as mighty as tanks, their momentum surpasses that of rumbling thunder motorcycles.\nIn the charging of these dozen colossal figures, they came down like a torrential mountain flood.\nIf it were a regular Beastman army, they might already scatter in fear upon collision, but the Dragon’s Nest Beastmen Legion, seasoned by many battles, stood unperturbed, halting to form ranks and confront the centaur’s charge.\n\"Kill these offenders!\"\nIn the blink of an eye, the centaur ranks charged with grins towards the Dragon’s Nest Beastman Legion, the fighting spirit leaving them blind to the Legion’s spears and the threat they posed.\nIn past conflicts, centaurs counted on their size and speed to group charge, and after trampling through enemy ranks, the latter would scatter in defeat, allowing the centaurs free reign to chase them.\nEven if their foes wielded spears, as long as they reached the front lines, their charging momentum would leave no beastman daring to raise a weapon but rather flee.\nRepeated victories in war gave the centaurs fearless momentum in charge.\nThey assumed this group of little shrimps would collapse like past foes once driven to the front.\nBut in the next moment, the centaurs felt as though they had struck an iron plate.\nNo, it was an iron wall!\n\"Hah!\"\nAt the moment of collision, a pair of Dragon Vein Attendants crouched at the frontline suddenly launched at the centaurs, their roar shaking the skies as the enormous shields in their left hands slammed towards the leading centaurs like walls.\nBang!!!\nThe centaurs, unprepared for a counterattack, flew back amidst a mighty sound as the shields crashed like a tidal wave against the strongest side of a centaur, sending two of them flying several meters.\nAt the same time, the Beastmen Legion behind finally revealed its hidden teeth. With a whistling sound, spears broke the air, launching forth, striking the unprepared centaurs, blood splattering as their bodies fell with a crash.",

      "content": "Chapter 76: Chapter 75 Injury\nThe expected scene of a one-sided collapse didn’t happen; the centaurs felt as if they had crashed into an indestructible iron wall, hitting it with bloodied heads.\nLong spears thrust out, and the centaurs, galloping swiftly, couldn’t stop within such a short distance and had no choice but to charge into the dense forest of spears ahead of them.\nPuff, puff, puff...\nThe muffled sound of spears piercing flesh rang out continuously, blood splattered everywhere, and huge bodies collapsed to the ground with a crash. In just a breath, the entire centaur unit had lost more than half of its members. The centaurs at the back, horrified by this scene, tried to come to a halt, but their massive bodies continued to charge forward due to inertia, eventually impaling themselves on the sharp spears ahead.\nBlood splattered, and the entire battlefield instantly turned into a meat grinder. In a flash, the centaurs suffered heavy losses, but the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion also wasn’t left unscathed.\nEven though the beastman troops had strict discipline and neat formations, the frontline beastmen facing the centaur charge were pushed back several steps by the massive impact. The previously tidy rectangular formation of the entire legion was now uneven, nearly on the verge of breaking apart.\nThis was due to the disparity in size and power, something discipline and cooperation couldn’t reverse. Under the enormous impact, even several beastmen found it hard to resist, their bodies forced back by the sheer force, spears bending almost to the point of breaking.\nEven though the centaurs couldn’t wield their weapons to attack, suffering heavy casualties in front of the beastman legion, the massive momentum they carried also sent several frontline beastmen flying. One centaur even soared into the air unexpectedly and crashed down into the formation, instantly crushing a kobold to death, while nearby beastmen suffered varying degrees of injuries.\nThis battle was unprecedented in its ferocity, with blood and corpses flowing everywhere, the splattering blood painting the sky as if a blood rain had fallen.\nAt this moment, within this assaulting centaur squad, after witnessing the tragic deaths and injuries of their comrades at the forefront, the last few centaurs finally came to a stop a few meters away from the legion, choosing not to linger for a moment longer, hurriedly turning around, and fleeing back in the direction they came from in sheer panic.\nUltimately, only three or four centaurs managed to flee back. This skirmish resulted in a casualty rate of over seventy percent for the centaur squad, leaving the few centaurs who fled back utterly demoralized, their expressions filled with fear and shock.\nMeanwhile, the centaur leader who had gathered his kin in the tribe was almost overcome with anger upon witnessing this scene, his eyes bloodshot, questioning when in their tribe’s history had they ever suffered such heavy losses!\nUnbeknownst to the centaur leader, the orcs within the Dragon Nest Legion opposite him were also shaken.\nIn the Dragon Nest Tribe’s past campaigns, when had there ever been such fierce slaughter and sacrifice? Even in battles against several times the number of enemies, thanks to the Dragon Vein Attendants and their united formations, the most severe results had only been a few orcs being gravely injured, but deaths had never occurred.\nBut now, just to deal with a small squad of ten or twenty centaurs, one orc had already died, and no fewer than ten others were seriously or lightly wounded!\nAlthough compared to the centaurs’ casualty rate, the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion’s losses seemed negligible.\nNevertheless, this was already considered the most painful loss in the history of the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion!\n\"Charge! His Highness is watching us from behind!\"\nDespite the fact they had suffered heavy losses just upon confrontation, the two leading Dragon Vein Attendants let out a furious roar in the next instant, and the orc legion beneath them immediately felt a surge of hot blood rushing to their heads, their gazes towards the direction of the Centaur Tribe seemingly ablaze.\n\"His Highness is right behind us!\"\nUpon hearing these words, moments ago receiving a harsh blow from the centaur squad, the Dragon Nest Beastmen were immediately enveloped by a burning morale. Instantly, they reformed their ranks and charged angrily towards the Centaur Tribe with overpowering momentum.\nUnder Austin’s leadership, all orcs in the Dragon Nest Tribe underwent a tremendous upheaval in their lives. Every orc living in the Dragon Nest Tribe harbored an indescribable awe for Austin. Moreover, whether in military training or during daily routines afterwards, Austin always ensured to brainwash the orcs in a subtle manner.\nNow, every orc in the Dragon Nest Tribe possessed a willingness to die for Austin.\nNoble and kind His Highness Austin watching from behind, what is there to fear of mere centaurs!\nThe invigorated Dragon Nest Beastman Legion surged forward like a tidal wave from afar, instantly impacting the centaurs in the tribe who felt a wave of overwhelming force as if they were about to be engulfed by the rushing tide.\n\"Everyone, use bows and arrows! Kill the invaders!\"\nThe centaur leader, at this moment, also drew a sharp breath. The relentless momentum of the bloodthirsty orc legion, combined with their orderly lineup charging forward, made him feel as if he were swaying in a storm.\nIn this crisis, the centaur leader even abandoned the pride of their kind, commanding his kin to use bow and arrow.\nCentaurs, with their tall stature, rarely found any enemy able to withstand their group charges. Precisely because of this, they seldom resorted to bows and arrows unless facing an indomitable foe.\nUsing bows and arrows against kobolds, jackal wolf people, minotaurs, and other \"weaklings\" would be considered a disgrace by their kin.\nBut at this moment, the centaur leader no longer cared.\nBuzz, buzz, buzz...\nWith the centaur leader’s order, continuous bowstring sounds echoed, arrows shot out swiftly, piercing the air like dense rain to cover the advancing Dragon Nest Beastman Tribe.\nPuff, puff, puff...\nWithin the arrow-riddled Dragon Nest Beastman Legion, there were instantly orcs struck down by arrows.\nEven though for group charges, the orcs maintained about a man’s distance between them during the charge to loosen the formation and somewhat reduce losses, there were always some unfortunate orcs who were hit directly by arrows.\nThe two leading Dragon Vein Attendants at the forefront were each carrying a massive shield. With the shields’ deflection, the incoming arrows posed no threat to them, and the frontline orcs were clad in crocodile soft armor made from crocodile skins so that even if struck by arrows, they only penetrated an inch or so deep.\nBut the orcs further back weren’t as fortunate. Although most arrows missed or fell to the ground, two orcs had arrows pierce through their eyes and out of their heads, killing them instantly. Five had their bodies penetrated by arrows, and over twenty had arrows lodged in their shoulders or arms, with blood streaming down.\nThe entire Dragon Nest Beastman Legion faced its greatest losses to date!",

Although I occasionally got lazy and took breaks, although the results have always been dismal, both books were completed with effort and not abandoned.\nAnd the author has successfully upgraded from an unknown failure to a small-time failure on the eighteenth line at Qidian....\n(ŎдŎ;)\nThe bitterness within, who can understand it.\nThe journey of the new book hasn’t been smooth either. Initially, the choice of the title discouraged many readers, and the clicks were pitifully few. Although the name was later changed, it didn’t seem to make much difference.\nAlso, after finishing Martial Movement of All Heavens, I was somewhat bored with writing about heavens. Coupled with reading a novel about metamorphosing into a dragon, I wanted to write one myself.\nWriting this book is essentially to fulfill a farming genre dream of mine.\nWhen I was little, I was a book fanatic who loved stories, starting with encountering four great classical novels in elementary school: Three Kingdoms, Water Margin, Journey to the West, and Dream of the Red Chamber.\nI have almost forgotten how many times I read Three Kingdoms, but it must have been no less than twenty times. At that time, I could almost recite the entire plot, especially when Liu Huangshu received guidance from Mr. Shui Jing, visited Zhuge Wulong thrice, and from there things went smoothly—occupying Jingzhou, entering Chuanshu, and claiming the title of King Han, I was deeply impressed and felt excited.\nOf course, in the end, the big generals of Shu Han back then died one by one, Zhuge Liang passed away at Wuzhangyuan, leaving plans to retreat Sima, slaying Wei Yan, and until the surrender of Shu’s later lord, Zhuge Kongming’s disciple Jiang Wei’s death in battle, the grand curtain of Three Kingdoms finally fell. Even though I was only eleven or twelve then, witnessing Luo Guanzhong’s conclusion that \"unity is followed by division, division followed by unity,\" a feeling of pity welled up in my heart.\nIt’s been many years, and that Three Kingdoms has long been lost, but the scenes of the world as a chessboard, the clashing armies still echo in my mind, impossible to forget.\nNext was Journey to the West. Although I watched the TV series adaptation many times as a child, the text version offered a different taste. However, I almost forget the main plot now.\nAs for Water Margin, it must have been about ten times. Not sure how old I was initially, probably around sixth grade. When I first read it, I only felt the heroes of Water Margin possessed a sense of pride, with stories of the 108 generals almost familiar in detail. Despite being saddened by the tragic ends, my fondness for reading it remained. Yet, each time revisiting, I never read the section about Liangshan’s campaign against Fang La.\nNo other reason, just felt too sad.\nLater on, maybe after one or two years passed, reopening Water Margin brought another kind of feeling unexpectedly.\nExcept for a few, the whole book was filled with \"wanton slaughter.\"\nNot to mention those who ate human flesh. Song Jiang, appearing righteous, slaughtered nearby cities and states impersonating Qin Ming to incite rebellion, causing many innocent deaths; later, for Lu Junyi’s ascent to Liangshan, he maliciously plotted, leading to Lu Junyi’s ruin; then, to draw Zhu Tong to join, kidnapped the prefect’s child, and Li Kui killed the little boy...\nMany, many examples could be listed. They say it’s government oppression leading to rebellion, but mostly, it’s Liangshan forcing the rebellion that I see.\nSpeaking of Li Kui, when Song Jiang was framed, many heroes planned to rescue from the execution ground. Then, as they rushed out of the city gate, vendors lined up on Moat Bridge selling vegetables, obstructing the heroes’ path, which led Li Kui to wield his Three Axes, slashing helpless vendors as if cutting vegetables, making another wave fall into the river. Even as civilians fled in panic, Li Kui relentlessly pursued.\nPity those hard times, how many impoverished families, anxiously harvesting vegetables to sell for a meager wage, awaited by their family at home, only to receive a headless corpse. Li Kui’s \"excited to kill,\" left countless orphans and widows.\nAnd Song Jiang? Lightly uttering \"my fault,\" and the matter was brushed aside.\nSince then, I never touched Water Margin again.\nAbout Dream of the Red Chamber, forgive my lack of a lady’s heart; after several attempts, I couldn’t finish it. Eventually, borrowed a classmate’s simplified version, which was about ten thousand words, to roughly follow the storyline.\nAfter reading it felt nothing really, seemingly less captivating than Three Kingdoms.\nIn high school, I began to encounter foreign classics. I read two parts of Gorky’s trilogy, Childhood and In the Mortal World, but My University bought in college didn’t intrigue me anymore, perhaps due to web lit.\nAmong them, the most memorable ones probably are Verne’s Mysterious Island and Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, considered early works of the farming genre, having read them multiple times, perhaps just a notch less than Three Kingdoms.\nThough I didn’t read many foreign classics, in senior year, accidentally discovered a delightful manga in Zhiyin Manga called Fights Break Spheres.\nAt that time, borrowed every past issue I could find and searched online extensively, eventually finishing its entire backstory, but found the manga too slow and opted to read the original novel.\nThus, I officially entered the realm of web novels.\nIndeed, once in, web novels are as deep as the sea, all other literature became strangers.\nFrom Fights Break to Douluo by Tang Jia San Shao, Divine Seal, then to The Mortal Cultivation Chronicles by Wang Yu, from fantasy to immortal cultivation, immersing in countless grandiose and fantastical worlds....\nUh...\nSuddenly realized time is running short, so I won’t boast anymore and will stop here.\n.....\nFinally, let’s talk about the situation of this book,\nThis book is only 160,000 words in, might be a bit early, but despite multiple recommendations from the editor during the new book phase, results remained at the lower end. Reviving recommendations also failed, leading to losing hope in new book recommendations, compounded with numerous great authors releasing works this month. Being a small-time, less visible writer with the book’s inherently niche topic in the upcoming public phase means enduring being cast aside and bare-launching.\nAs per the editor’s suggestion, only launching early to see how it fares, avoiding queuing behind renowned authors for app pushes, and hoping to garner some support...\n༼༎ຶᴗ༎ຶ༽\nThus, I’m seeking first subscriptions here,\nBased on current collections,\nThree hundred first subscriptions, barely passable.\nFive hundred, quite satisfactory,\nSeven hundred, very happy.\nOne thousand, I’d wake up laughing from my dreams. If there truly are a thousand first subscriptions, I wouldn’t mind doing head-down writing for the next half month, achieving daily updates of ten thousand words. But I think that’s basically impossible, so I don’t expect too much.\nPost-launch, a minimum of two updates, and for additional updates, since there are no saved drafts, maybe four or five on the first day, then I’ll try for three later.\nAnyway, the leisure of the public period for the new book won’t continue.\nSigh, so struggling.",

In the early stages, when there was a food shortage, Austin had taught the Beastmen how to remove the bitterness from bamboo shoots, turning them into food to increase the food supply of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s Beastmen.\nAt that time, Austin had wondered if he could use those bamboos to make bows and arrows to enhance the strength of his Clan subordinates.\nIt’s known that the use of bows and arrows marked humanity in Austin’s past life as the definitive apex predator in the food chain.\nAustin had also envisioned at the time that if every Clan subordinate had a bow and arrow, a wave of arrow rain would sweep through all obstacles, unstoppable.\nBut when he actually began making them, he realized that ideals were rich, but reality was bleak.\nAfter all, in his past life, Austin knew nothing about bows and arrows. The Bamboo bows guided by Goblins could only shoot lightweight arrows six to seven meters away, incapable of penetrating even the skin of a wild rabbit. Unfortunately, no matter how they were modified, it was hard to increase their power. Therefore, Austin quickly gave up the idea, leaving the task to the Goblins in the manufacturing workshop to experiment and find a solution gradually.\nAustin vaguely remembered some old information about making longbows, like using year-old oak wood and horse mane for strings. After passing this rough knowledge to the Goblins in the manufacturing workshop, Austin threw it to the back of his mind.\nWho would have thought that now, in this Centaur Tribe, he would see real bows and arrows, and with impressive power.\nSeeing the Beastman Legion taking significant damage, Austin, although wanting to train his Clan Beastmen’s independence, did not intend to let the Beastman Legion suffer needless losses.\nJust as Austin was about to step in,\nHum!!!\nSuddenly, a red light emerged among the Beastman Legion charging through the rain of arrows, spreading ripples visible to the naked eye, sweeping like a tide.\nIt was the Fox-faced Man, Quik!\nHe had wielded the Red Crystal Staff he had obtained not long ago.\nThe next moment,\nA massive Fire Attribute Magic Power gathered, forming a gigantic fireball, scorching the air. Intense heat swept through the sky, suddenly shooting toward the Centaur Tribe, trailing a long tail flame.\nBoom!!!\nThe Centaurs still in the village hadn’t reacted before the enormous fireball descended from the sky, exploding violently.\nAs the fireball exploded, intense flames spread in all directions like fiery serpents, sweeping outwards. The searing heat ignited the dry thatch of nearby houses, instantly causing a raging fire.\nRoar, roar, roar!!!\nAt this moment, the sky was clear, and the dry thatch and tree trunks were set ablaze in an instant. The fire spread to four or five houses, showing signs of engulfing the entire village in flames.\nNot good!\nThe Centaur leader felt a pang in his heart. As the fire spread, Centaurs around the village ceased shooting arrows and scrambled to avoid the scorching flames. The entire tribe fell into chaos amidst the blaze, unable to shoot any more arrows.\nAt the same time, withstanding the arrow attacks, the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion finally charged in front of the Centaur Tribe village.\nOne by one, the Beastmen crossed the outer fences like a tide, and stormed in directly.\nIn group charges, the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion couldn’t match the Centaur, nor were they superior in long-range arrow combat. However, in close-quarters combat, the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion stood streets ahead of the Centaur.\nThis was the well-trained confidence of the battle-hardened Dragon Nest Legion!\nThe Centaurs, originally scattered in panic due to the fire started by that micro Flame Burst Technique, couldn’t organize any counter-power before being submerged by the overwhelming Dragon Nest Beastman Legion.\nWith flames burning, Centaurs fell in droves amidst the tightly packed spear formations, screaming and wailing on the ground. Centaur comrades ran over from afar, but in the narrow passageways within the village, they couldn’t gather enough charge power and were easily overthrown by the Beastmen.\n\"Retreat! Fall back!\"\nAfter the Dragon Nest Beastmen stormed into the Centaur Tribe, their compact military formations trampled everything in their path. In the chaos, the scattered Centaurs were no match for them.\nWith flames and obstacles all around the village, Centaurs couldn’t play to their strengths at all. Meanwhile, the dense formation group’s attack was exactly where the Dragon Nest Beastmen’s greatest advantage lay. The situation leaning to one side was quite expected.\nSeeing one clansman fall after another in the sea of fire and spears, the Centaur leader’s eyes reddened with rage, his eyes nearly bursting. Those bodies lying on the ground were his former clansmen.\nYet, after the Beastman Legion charged into the village, the general trend was irreversible. Fighting on would only increase casualties.\n\"Escape! Everyone, run outside!\"\nWith the Centaur leader’s furious roar, the terrified and confused Centaurs within the village came to their senses, fleeing out of the village in all directions.\nThis war was already unwinnable.\nThe pride of the Centaurs had been stomped ruthlessly by a bunch of dwarfs.\nOne by one, Centaurs bolted out of the village, fleeing in disarray.\nHowever, at this moment,\n\"Kill!\"\n\"Kill them!\"\n\"For His Highness!\"\nA roar of battle cries erupted, and in a panic-stricken state, they saw Beastman armies charging from both left and right, like a tsunami overwhelming everything in their path.\nEarlier, after the fierce battle within the tribe, the Centaurs had no courage left to face them, swiftly turning around and fleeing, raising a cloud of dust as they hurriedly retreated to the back hills of the tribe.\nIn panic, some Centaurs rushed straight into the Centaur’s military formation, losing their courage. They were easily overthrown and captured by the Dragon Nest Beastmen. Even some who twisted their ankles in retreat howled on the ground and were effortlessly caught by the Beastmen.\nFinally, the Centaurs that could successfully \"escape\" from the back road numbered about seventy to eighty, each mostly injured, with their spirits crushed by the earlier battle, posing little threat.\nAs for the group of Centaurs fleeing to the rear, the Beastman Legion did not pursue because they knew that the last \"path of survival\" was watched by His Highness Austin. They only sent part of the forces to track and receive the Centaurs captured by His Highness, while the rest handled various post-war affairs like extinguishing the fire, collecting captives, and treating the wounded.",

And lose so miserably!\nDue to their physique, Centaurs naturally had an advantage over other Beastman races, and once they charged, they were usually unstoppable, especially against those lower races; no matter how many there were, they couldn’t shake them in the slightest.\nCentaurs are by no means a peace-loving race, and in the harsh world of the Kawa Great Forest, there is no soil for a peaceful tribe to exist. From the tribe’s establishment, they’ve been through countless battles, using their size advantage to rout their enemies with every charge.\nDon’t mention one or two hundred people, even five hundred or a thousand enemies, Chiron’s tribe has faced before, winning with fewer numbers has been their tradition.\nBecause of this, the proud Centaurs even disdain to incorporate other races into their tribe, with the entire tribe consisting solely of Centaurs.\nBut now, they were defeated.\nThree hundred against one hundred, an unquestionably devastating loss!\nThe battle had become a nightmare they didn’t want to recall.\nA large number of their clan were killed or captured, their hard-built settlement abandoned, leaving them as defeated wandering souls that, if they didn’t find food soon, might become another set of bones buried within the Kawa Great Forest.\nThe future looked bleak.\nMeanwhile, as the dispirited remnants gathered together,\nSwish!!!\nThe sky obscured by lush leaves suddenly tore open a great hole, a massive figure descended from above, overshadowing the sky, an overwhelming pressure like mountains falling from the heavens, weighing down on every Centaur, as if faced with a tsunami and abyss.\nChiron looked up in terror, seeing the sky covered with huge membranous wings, air currents swirling, dim light reflecting, atop the terrifying and fearsome head, a pair of blood-red eyes staring down at them.\nThe Dragon! It’s a Dragon!!!\nIn that instant, Chiron felt as if he had plunged into an icy pit in the dead of winter, a bucket of cold water poured over him, boundless coldness surging into his heart.\nHis troops fared even worse, many collapsing under the formidable dragon’s presence, unable to stand up again.\n\"Centaurs, submit, or die!\"\nThe fearsome head slowly lowered, its indifferent gaze fixed on Chiron.\nIts ancient, solemn voice reverberated through the air with no trace of emotion.\nAt that moment, Chiron was motionless, feeling as if a mountain was pressing on his back.\n....\nWhen the fire within the Centaur tribe was extinguished, and the Dragon Nest Beastmen Legion settled the injured companions or prisoners, Austin brought the captured Chiron and the Centaurs back.\nNormally, Centaurs’ pride wouldn’t allow them to submit to a Young Dragon.\nUnfortunately, first experiencing an unprecedented defeat, their morale diminished under the dragon’s presence, they lacked any courage to resist.\nAnd when Chiron and the Centaurs learned that the Beastman Legion attacking their tribe were part of Austin’s clan, whatever reluctance they had vanished.\nCertainly, the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion had killed many of their clanmates during the attack, but the rule of the Kawa Great Forest is survival of the fittest, and every Beastman living there has the awareness of being attacked and enslaved while plundering others’ tribes for food and captives.\nAmong Beastmen, the concept of blood feuds often differs vastly from humans.\nRevering strength is their innate nature.\nWith such powerful clans, the Blue Young Dragon named Austin couldn’t be lacking in strength.\nGreat strength also implies a life of stability and sustenance.\nAlthough the Centaurs aren’t weak, often plundering food from other tribes to support themselves with their formidable strength, they aren’t always able to eat well, often facing days of eating coarse food. Now submitting under the Blue Young Dragon might allow them to live better.\nReturning to the Centaur tribe, Austin directly handed the captives over to his Beastman Legion subordinates.\nThey confiscated the weapons of Chiron and the remaining troops, binding their hands together with vines, then escorted them to the prisoner area, waiting to take them back to the Dragon Nest Division.\nHaving conquered and annexed other tribes many times, the Dragon Nest Beastmen were very familiar with this process.\n\"Your Highness.\"\nSeeing Austin approaching, the Fox-faced Man Quik, originally directing the Beastmen to tidy up the battlefield, quickly bowed in salute.\n\"What’s the situation?\"\n\"Reporting to Your Highness, in this battle, we lost six soldiers, with seventeen severely injured, the rest bearing some injuries here and there.\"\nThis loss could be said to be the most severe the Dragon Nest Legion has suffered since its formation and campaigns; since the appearance of the Dragon Vein Attendant, the Dragon Nest Beastmen’s attacks and annexations of other tribes have rarely resulted in casualties, not to mention direct deaths.\nThis couldn’t be blamed on them, Centaurs have a natural advantage in physique, combined with their archery, being able to defeat the Centaur tribe with fewer numbers is something other tribes wouldn’t dare imagine.\nEspecially compared to the Centaur tribe’s losses, the Dragon Nest Beastmen’s damages seem negligible.\n\"Take care of those injured, and of the comrades who died, gather their bodies back too.\"\nNow on the path of war, casualties are inevitable, presumably the Beastmen are prepared for this.\nAfter some careful instructions, Austin began sorting through the spoils of war.\nFirst were the captive Centaurs, excluding the deceased, a total of two hundred and thirty-two Centaurs were captured, actually, the Centaur tribe’s true deaths weren’t that high, most were skewered by Beastmen’s spears, heavily wounded and fell.\nThis battle’s capture of two hundred thirty-two Centaurs significantly enhanced the Dragon Nest Tribe’s military strength.\nOnce the Centaurs are brainwashed and trained, they can directly join the military, becoming a vital force in future campaigns.\nWith the integration of Centaurs, the Dragon Nest Tribe has also addressed its shortcomings in cavalry.",

      "content": "Chapter 80: Chapter 78: Military Types (3rd update, please subscribe)\nThe Dragon Nest Legion, rigorously trained, could easily face any Beastman Tribe with their group assault power in a direct confrontation. However, against enemies like the Centaurs that rely on speed, they found themselves at a disadvantage.\nSuch agile and mobile enemies, once they see the situation turning unfavorable and start fleeing, there’s no way to catch up with them.\nWhen exterminating the Blood Wolves initially, Austin had to use the strategy of trapping them in to deal with the Blood Wolves. In hindsight, if the Centaur Clan had been used back then, there would have been no need to waste strategies on those beasts.\nAustin had long considered establishing a cavalry force. After exterminating the Blood Wolves, he once obtained several Blood Wolf cubs. Now these cubs had grown somewhat, but establishing a Wolf Cavalry force still seemed far off due to their insufficient numbers.\nTwo months ago, the Dragon Nest Tribe had broken through a Minotaur Tribe and acquired a herd of domesticated wild cattle. Back then, Austin also thought about establishing Cow Cavalry.\nHowever, upon actual implementation, it was discovered that the wild cattle lacked both explosive power and endurance. They could barely be used as Heavy Cavalry for charges, which differed greatly from Austin’s plans for swift-moving Light Cavalry to chase down the enemy.\nAdditionally, no Beastman Tribe thus far could withstand the frontal assault of the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion, rendering the immediate need for similar Heavy Cavalry minimal. Hence, Austin only trained a small group of twelve Cow Cavalry as a reserve, to be expanded and brought onto the battlefield when heavy cavalry was needed in the future.\n\"Cavalry... it wasn’t a loss expending such effort to conquer this Centaur Tribe.\"\nNow, with this group of Centaur captives, once they were trained and integrated into the Dragon Nest Tribe, the cavalry’s pursuing shortfall would soon be remedied.\nThus, not only would the military strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe increase substantially, but they would also have a wider array of tactical options for future campaigns.\n\"Although these Centaurs have surrendered, the war was quite fierce. During their military training and transformation, constant attention must be paid to their psychological state, and proper guidance should be provided.\"\nAt this moment, although the flames in the Centaur Tribe had been extinguished, thick smoke continued to rise slowly. Most of the houses had collapsed, beams fell and were charred black by the smoke, and the inflammable thatched roofs had burned to ashes, which scattered all over and filled the air, turning the entire tribe into ruins.\nQuik’s use of the Flame Burst Technique was indeed powerful, yet also fortunate.\nAfter the flame’s explosion, it ignited the dry wooden and thatched houses in the tribe, spreading swiftly and causing chaos among the centaurs who had been shooting arrows inside. Coupled with the assault of the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion, the Centaur Tribe was easily defeated.\nThis also served as a reminder for Austin.\nThe houses in the Dragon Nest Tribe were similar in structure to those of the Centaur Tribe. A careless fire could potentially lead to a major disaster, so it seemed essential to replace the houses with brick-and-tile ones. Luckily, the Goblins had already mastered the brick-making technique, with tiles probably not too far behind either.\nThough the Kawa Great Forest did not lack rainfall, the sun was fierce. The thatched roofs dried fast after a rain, making accidental fires very possible.\nMoreover, while fire prevention was a regular concern, an enemy-induced fire could result in a situation similar to what befell the Centaur Tribe, which would be perilous.\n\"Uh, Your Highness, what do you mean by psychological state...\"\nWhile Austin was quickly processing numerous thoughts, Quik cautiously inquired from the side.\n\"Oh, that, let’s discuss it back at the tribe. I’ll teach you then.\"\nAustin wasn’t a psychologist in his previous life, but he had some knowledge, akin to knowing how bacon tastes without ever having seen a pig. It merely involved further splitting some areas in brainwashing courses, but here wasn’t an appropriate place to discuss this.\nAustin walked towards the clearing, as the Dragon Nest Beastmen gradually brought out various spoils from the scorched, collapsed houses, piling them into a small hill.\nAmong the spoils were wooden spears, sharp stone knives and axes, stone pots and bowls, longbows, arrows, food, and more, with food being the majority, represented by many miscellaneous types.\nPicking up a longbow, blackened by smoke and stained with blood — whose, unknown — Austin pulled it to feel its strength. The bow limb’s material was unknown, but its elasticity was remarkable — no wonder it was so powerful, with the bowstring likely made from horsehair.\n\"Is this self-sufficiency?\"\nA scene suddenly flashed in Austin’s mind:\nA Centaur plucking hairs one by one from its tail, rolling them into a bundle, tying them to the bow’s ends to string it...\nShaking his head to dispel the nonsensical thoughts, Austin continued.\n\"These bow and arrow weapons manufactured by the Centaurs are impressive. Quik, have the Goblins at the manufacturing workshop learn bow-making techniques from the Centaurs when we return, to produce them as soon as possible.\"\nIf they could mass-produce bows and arrows, it would doubtlessly benefit the Dragon Nest Beastman Tribe’s strength attributed increase massively.\nWith bows and arrows, the Beastman Legion could further distinctively introduce another military division, the archers.\nInfantry, archers, cavalry—these were the three main types of ancient military forces from Austin’s past life before firearms and artillery became prevalent, and they surely had their merits.\nThe stratification into these three military types promised an inevitable enhancement of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s power.\n\"Yes, Your Highness.\"\nNodding, Austin tossed the longbow back onto the pile.\nHis main goal wasn’t attacking the Centaur Tribe; that was merely a bonus. He hadn’t forgotten his true purpose for coming here.\nExploring the cliff caves in the nearby valley, presumably mage remnants left behind, was of utmost priority for this trip.\nAs Austin prepared to lead his men to explore the valley and cliffs, a small, hairy, oval object the size of a fist suddenly rolled off the pile of food, landing at his feet.\nThis was a coincidental result of him discarding the longbow earlier, likely some food or grain.\nInitially dismissive, a mere sidelong glance piqued Austin’s curiosity. He crouched to pick up the rounded object and sniffed it:\n\"Is this... taro?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 81: Chapter 79 Taro (4th update, subscription requested)\nAlthough its appearance is somewhat different, it indeed bears quite a resemblance to the yam in my memory, even the smell seems almost the same.\n\"Is it a food similar to yam?\"\nWeighing the round tuber in his claw, Austin pondered silently in his heart.\nThis world is vastly different from the environment of his past life, so naturally, the types of food can’t be exactly the same. However, these ordinary foods have at least one or two similarities, though the reason is unknown.\nBut these matters don’t have much to do with Austin, anyway. Questions like why he traversed worlds are impossible for him to solve no matter how hard he thinks.\nCurrently, what’s more important is the significance of the \"yam\".\nAlthough the Dragon Nest Tribe has begun the great undertaking of clearing land for farming, under sufficient manpower, the total acreage of recently cleared land is nearing one thousand large acres. However, even up till today, the food suitable for planting by the beastmen remains limited to kudzu root and a small amount of rice.\nThe food is too monotonous, which is very unhealthy.\nDon’t be misled by the high spirits of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s beastmen militia laboring fervently in the fields, wild and enthusiastic under the open sky. Filling their stomachs is everything to them, they don’t care whether the food is monotonous or varied. Even if Austin wasn’t some expert in his previous life, he knows that a single source of food is insufficient to maintain the body’s balance of various elements.\nMore importantly, should the kudzu root they plant suffer a virus or pest infestation, leading to a massive die-off, given the current situation of the Dragon Nest Tribe, they would stand no chance against such a potential threat.\nThis is why seeking other food species to achieve agricultural diversification is very necessary.\nAlthough there are plenty of edible foods in Kawa Great Forest, very few are suitable for large-scale cultivation.\nTake for example one of the foods gathered by the Dragon Nest Tribe beastmen, the thorn fruit. This food grows on a type of thorny vine, thumb-sized, nestled in the crevices of rocky foothills. Upon ripening, it turns yellow, its taste dry, astringent, slightly bitter, with a hint of sweetness. However, its starch content is decent, making it relatively satisfying.\nTo achieve agricultural diversity, Austin once had the beastmen plant an acre of thorn fruit. Yet the space occupied by the thorny vine as it grew became too large, and consequently, not much could be planted on an acre. Furthermore, the growth cycle is long, producing only two seasons a year. Most critically, upon harvest, an acre could only yield about twenty pounds of thorn fruit.\nThis yield compared to the manpower invested initially in clearing the land is far from satisfying the needs of the Dragon Nest beastmen.\nAlthough the lifespan of the thorn vines is very long, growing strong for ten or twenty years with sufficient care, and after harvesting a season, they continue to produce without replanting like kudzu vines.\nBut given that only two seasons can be produced a year, coupled with its low yield, it naturally can’t replace kudzu vine as the primary crop for the beastmen’s farming efforts.\nThe type of food that can support the Dragon Nest Tribe’s survival must possess high yield characteristics, enough to meet the basic survival material requirements of the beastmen.\nSatisfying these two conditions, Austin, after examining the food gathered nearby by the beastmen, found only kudzu root and rice. However, wild rice isn’t yet domesticated, and its yield is low, so in the final analysis, only kudzu root fits the criteria.\nCurrently, in the nearly thousand acres of land cleared by the Dragon Nest Tribe, ninety-eight percent is planted with kudzu root.\nIf nothing happens, that would be good, but if a kudzu virus similar to a potato virus appears or suddenly, an infestation occurs, then there could be trouble.\n\"If it really is food similar to yam, then the issue of monoculture the Dragon Nest Tribe faces might be half solved.\"\nThinking to himself, Austin instructed Quik to bring the centaur leader Chiron over for detailed inquiry.\nFrom Chiron, Austin learned that the tuber in his hand was a trophy they acquired during a raid on another tribe, but as for its name, growth appearance, growth habits and such, Chiron wasn’t aware. Nonetheless, it tasted good, initially thought to be finished, but unexpectedly, one was left.\nAs for the tribe Chiron and others raided, they later relocated and left, so currently it’s presumed that only Austin’s single piece remains.\nHaving listened to the entire story, Austin felt somewhat regretful, but what has happened can’t be changed.\n\"In that case, let’s call it yam.\"\nSuch a name serves as a nostalgic tribute to certain aspects of his past life.\nAustin handed the sole yam to Quik and instructed him to plant it well upon returning to the tribe. If successful in cultivation and if it yields adequately, then the tribe’s agricultural repertoire would include one more crop, and thus their risk resistance capability would be enhanced.\nThe discovery of the yam was indeed a pleasant surprise for Austin. Subsequently, he searched the pile of trophies but didn’t find anything else valuable, so he had to stop.\n\"Forget it, the bounty from this time is already quite good.\"\nShaking his head, Austin decided not to dwell further.\n\"Quik, go fetch that little rodent, gather the Dragon Vein Attendants, and pick several elite squads.\"\nAfter spending the better part of the day sorting through the battlefield against the Centaur Tribe, Austin finally started on the main event — exploring the cave purportedly left by a mage.\nThe location of the valley cliff is very close to the Centaur Tribe, about a kilometer away, and with the Ratman Priest leading the way, they arrived quickly.\nIn that stretch, the continuous mountains seemed to suddenly collapse, forming an almost vertical abyss. Looking down from above, clouds and mist obscured the view, raising Austin’s suspicion about how the Ratman Priest miraculously survived without falling to his death.\nOf course, this time the rat would not mimic its prior tumble. The beastmen wove ropes from vines, securing them to a large tree above, and let the other end freely drop into the valley abyss. Then, several Dragon Vein Attendants grasped the ropes, descending step by step along the steep cliff face.\nMeanwhile, Austin grabbed both the Ratman Priest and the fox-faced man Quik, one in each claw, spread his wings and soared into the valley abyss directly.\nIn no time, the group gathered at the valley floor without incident.\nAustin glanced around; the surroundings were shrouded in a thin mist, not obstructing vision too much, but the soil was scattered with many white bones, seemingly from animals accidentally falling from above.\nThis sight again made Austin question the Ratman Priest’s luck; could this be the legendary protagonist? Otherwise, how could the legendary tale of surviving a cliff fall, discovering treasures in the cave, and rising to the peak of the Ratman Tribe occur with him?",

Do they think that by burning all the recorded books and banning all scholars from research, they can cover up everything? No, the human pursuit of knowledge will never cease!\"\n\"....I searched through many ancient texts, and all the data suggests that after the collapse of that massive Beastman Empire, the remaining pure-blooded Beastmen retreated into the Kawa Great Forest, disappearing into the vast sea of trees. Damn it, do I really have to go there? That’s a barbaric land unreachable even by human footprints!\"\n\"....I’ve reached Gold Level, perhaps I should be able to protect myself in that place. Alright, I’ll set out tomorrow...\"\n\"...Damn it, it’s been three years, and I still haven’t found anything. Did that massive Beastman Empire really exist in history? If, after the empire’s fall, those remnants really fled into this barbaric land, why have I only encountered half-beastmen and not the true pure-blooded Beastmen? I’m even beginning to doubt whether the history of the Beastman Empire truly exists. Forget it, if there’s no clue this year, I’ll go back. Recently, the letters from my teacher have been giving me an uneasy feeling for some reason.\"\n\"...My teacher’s letters have urged me again, no, I absolutely can’t leave, I’ve discovered something new!\"\n\"....Initially, I thought it was a trace left by a meteorite landing countless years ago, and I even considered collecting some meteorite materials, but my god, that was a trace of civilization, a creation of unknown beings!!!\"\n\"...I confirmed my calculations weren’t wrong, it indeed is a huge meteorite crater formed by some object falling from the starry sky, but it is definitely not naturally formed, I’ve only heard of a man-made object that can float high in the sky, the crystallization of the Magic Alliance’s wisdom, the one and only Sky City, but why did this thing fall from the sky like a meteorite? Who on earth created it? Was it the Divine?!!\"\n\"...I can’t get close, those ghostly weeds are growing too lushly; they will automatically attack any living thing that approaches. What on earth is happening? Isn’t it said that these strange plants only grow at the junction of two worlds where the Power of the World is revealed? Why is there the Power of the World here? What’s inside the meteorite crater, what was manufactured and by whom?!!!\"\n\"...Such luck! I spent a large amount of materials to make a special fishing rod, intending just to probe what might be inside, but unexpectedly I fished up a skeletal corpse!\"\n\"....Yes, yes, that skeleton is indeed a human skeleton! It’s just... it’s somewhat different from modern human skeletons, it gives the impression of... like it’s from ancient humans?\"\n\"He also carried with him two magic artifacts, one red crystal magic ball capable of unleashing the Flame Burst Technique, and another ring capable of unleashing the Vine Technique. The power of these two techniques is negligible, but my god! It’s unbelievable, they can actually recharge automatically, this is an unprecedented technology! I dare to swear, even in the headquarters of the Mage Alliance, the ever-floating Sky City definitely doesn’t have this technology!\"\n\"...I seem to have discovered something incredible, it’s awful, every moment I feel an apprehensive heartbeat, my amateur Prophetic Magic is crazily warning, this is not the domain I should step into, yet, I’m so excited, I’m almost trembling, what should I do?\"\n....\n\"I need to go back! I need to hurry back! To take this skeleton to my teacher, if that speculation is really correct, then human history....\"\nWithin the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin carefully closed an ancient beast skin diary, his face stone cold.\nIt was now the second day after their exploration of that mage’s cave, which was suspected to be a residence of some mage from a long time ago, and they discovered another magic artifact inside.\nA ring capable of unleashing a very powerful Vine Technique that even Austin would struggle to break free from.\nNaturally, Austin handed the ring to Quik, the only prospective mage in the Dragon Nest Tribe. As a result, Quik’s strength surged in an instant, so much so that even when facing enemies of the same level as Austin, he could stand by his side as support.\nHowever, Austin was not happy, because while they obtained that ring in the cave, they also acquired this beast skin notebook with its middle part torn out.\nFrom the content in the notebook, it can be known that its original owner had entered the Kawa Great Forest in pursuit of the history of the so-called Beastman Empire and pure-blooded Beastmen, only to find another earth-shattering secret unexpectedly.\nWhy call it an earth-shattering secret? Because Austin saw that on the last page of this beast skin notebook, before the phrase \"I need to go back, I need to hurry back... if that speculation is correct, then human history...\", a small half of the notebook was missing.\nBefore that phrase, all the records were completely destroyed, and the notes ended abruptly there.\nAustin could even imagine that many years ago, the mage’s hands trembled as he recorded that discovery on the beast skin parchment, then, out of an extreme fear, tore it into pieces and burned it to destruction, not daring to leave the speculative result on paper, afraid of incurring some dreadful disaster.\nOriginally, it was nothing much. At most, ordinary people seeing these records would only feel a thrill from peering into certain secrets. The more mysterious something is, the more it can attract one’s curiosity.\nInitially, Austin was the same, enthusiastically browsing through the information on it.\nBut when he saw the sketched map of the ghostly weeds and then the sketch of the \"meteorite crater\" in the blank space on the beast skin paper, his heart suddenly sank.\nNo mistake,\nThe \"meteorite crater\" mentioned on the beast skin paper was essentially the reservoir by his own nest!\nThe reservoir where he himself led people to hunt the Ghost-headed Crocodile and even personally dived into the water to explore!\n\"Hiss, seems like when you’re just staying at home, trouble can still descend from the sky!\"\nAustin threw the beast skin notebook to the ground, only feeling a headache coming on. The earlier excitement from capturing the Centaur Tribe, obtaining new weaponry like bows and arrows, acquiring new food resources like taro, and gaining the magic artifact ring, all vanished completely.\nNow all he can think about is for this stupid beast skin notebook to roll away as far as possible. He wishes he had never seen it, doesn’t want to know about any history, any secrets that scared a Gold Level Great Mage into a hasty retreat.\nHe just wants to hide away in a corner and farm, waiting until he becomes a Legendary adult, and then come forth to conquer the world with the Beastmen, establishing an empire where he eats, drinks and plays.\nEven relying on his long life to successively initiate one, two, three industrial revolutions, creating mobile phones, computers, PSPs, and then greatly developing the entertainment industry, henceforth staying happily in the Dragon’s Nest as a reclusive dragon.\nWhat a wonderful life that would be!\nBut some things, even if you don’t seek them, they will come to you.\nMoreover, they can be both unexpected and within reason.\n\"Could it be that my crossing has something to do with whatever crappy thing is inside that meteorite crater? Damn it, if I can’t afford to provoke it, can’t I at least hide from it? If worse comes to worst, I’ll just move away!\"\nAustin cursed under his breath, but after taking a few deep breaths, he thought it over, then picked up the beast skin notebook from the ground and put it away carefully.\n...\nThe fifth update is complete,\nand finally, I’m asking for a monthly ticket as well.\n```",

      "content": "Chapter 83: Chapter 81: Efficiency of Political Systems\nThey say life is like something you can’t resist, so you have to enjoy it.\nActually, thinking about it seriously, it’s really nothing. Most of the things left in that cave by the Gold Level Great Mage have rotted away, indicating that several hundred to thousands of years have passed. Unless he advanced to Legendary, he would have been long gone by now.\nAnd all these years, there’s been no sign of him returning to that cave, it’s almost certain that he didn’t survive.\nWith the death of that Gold Level Great Mage, as for the things at the bottom of the nearby lake reservoir, as long as I don’t say anything, how would others know? Even if there’s some godforsaken big secret hidden there, so what?\nThinking like this, Austin’s mood improved a lot.\nAt least it seems safe for now, and Austin has no need to explore that lake reservoir any further. At least for now, knowing more is unnecessary. The most important thing is to vigorously develop the Clan Tribe.\nAs for that ghost grass in the notebook, a strange plant that only grows at the borders of the two worlds when the Power of the World is revealed... Austin was a bit intrigued by that part, but with his current strength, no matter how intrigued he was, it was useless. He could only bury it in his heart and wait for the day to explore.\nHowever, Austin was a bit interested in some information mentioned in the beast skin notes about that legendary Beastman Empire. After all, the notes speculate that after the collapse of the colossal Beastman Empire, the remnants entered this Barbaric Land of the Kawa Great Forest.\nAfter all, I’ve taken root in this place. Although the entire Kawa Great Forest spans millions of square kilometers, comparable to the size of Russia from Austin’s past life, the area under my control is only around ten to twenty kilometers, just the scope of a small village. The chances of encountering others are quite slim, but if I start expanding my development outward, there will always be a chance to meet them, right?\nAnd from the records, there seems to be a distinction between true pure-blooded beastmen and half-beastmen?\nIf the history explored in the notes truly exists, then where did the pure-blooded beastmen go? Are all my clan beastmen merely half-beastmen?\n\"Interesting...\"\nThe inherited memories of the Giant Dragon are not all-encompassing, at most tracing back about ten generations. Coupled with the nature of the Giant Dragon, showing no concern for the evolution of human world dynasties, Austin isn’t clear about those histories and can only rely on himself to uncover them.\nThinking about it, Austin put the beast skin notes away and stepped outside, pondering if Quik might know something about the Beastman Empire.\nThe sky was clear and cloudless at this moment, and the people of the Dragon Nest Tribe were busy working steadily.\nUnlike other beastman tribes, which would have nothing else to do except bask idly in the village when not out hunting or gathering food, the Dragon Nest Tribe is different. Due to strict military training and various political courses, the beastmen were instilled from the start with the idea that obedience to orders is their utmost duty. Moreover, daily tasks were uniformly arranged by the command hall, which greatly utilized the labour of the beastmen and was one of the reasons why the Dragon Nest Tribe could develop rapidly in a short period.\nIn nearly a year’s time, the Dragon Nest Tribe rapidly expanded from seven kobolds to over fourteen hundred people, cultivated over a thousand acres of land, built forty-seven houses, and expanded the village site to over a hundred acres. The beastman teams behaved in an orderly manner, all thanks to this highly efficient military-political system.\nOf course, Austin, having experienced the changes in military and political systems across countries in his past life, knew that this efficient system would be hard to maintain indefinitely. But at least for a long time to come, there shouldn’t be any problems.\nMoreover, with the increase in the tribe’s population, Austin planned to start detailing the management of the clan gradually, hoping to further improve the efficiency of the beastman clan.\nAfter all, the strengths of each race are not the same. For example, goblins are relatively weak in strength, but they have certain talents in manufacturing and construction. Austin selected talented goblins to form a manufacturing workshop, specializing in the making of weapons, stone tools, and other items, while others were assigned to tasks like building houses and constructing walls.\nAside from goblins, there were kobolds, minotaurs, jackal wolf people, and many other races, each with their own strengths. However, to fully exploit their strengths, Austin needed to explore by himself, and it couldn’t be rushed; he could only proceed with reforms slowly.\nWalking down the spacious passage, the beastman squads passing by greeted Austin one after another.\nBefore long, Austin found Quik on the training ground.\nAt this moment, the fox-faced man Quik was practicing a magic item he had just acquired in the open area.\nVine Technique!\nQuik raised his palm, a ring on his finger emanated a wave, manipulating the magic power in the surrounding air, making it seem as if the air was twisting around.\nThe next moment,\nBeneath a large stone about ten meters in front, several thick, dark vines suddenly burst out of the ground, intertwining like living creatures, binding the rock firmly in no time.\nMeanwhile, two beastmen walked over and tried to pull but couldn’t break the dark vines ensnaring the rock.\nUntil a moment later, the magic power dissipated, and the vines intertwined on the stone surface crumbled away like dust in the wind.\n\"Not bad.\"\nSeeing this scene, Austin nodded silently to himself.\nThe ring with the Vine Technique, even using it himself would require some effort to break free. Plus, with another magic item in Quik’s hand now, first binding the enemy with the Vine Technique and then using the Red Crystal Staff for a mini Flame Burst Technique to obliterate the enemy completely, the lethality would be much greater.\nIf he had these two magic items, a year ago, to deal with the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader and the Blood Wolf Leader, Quik along with a squad of elite beastmen might just be enough.\nOf course, Austin was different from a year ago. If faced with the enemies from a year ago now, he might easily bite their heads off. Despite Quik having two magic items, compared to Austin’s combat power, there’s still a significant difference, but it’s something to be delighted about.\nInitially, when modifying Quik, without meditation techniques, magic structure runes, and other mage knowledge, it seemed his extraordinary talent was unused, wasting a magic stone.\nNow, it seems the Warrior Talent awakened Dragon Vein Attendant is lagging behind instead.\n\"Quik,\"\nMany thoughts traversed his mind, as Austin approached Quik and asked.\n\"Have you ever heard of the Beastman Empire?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 84: Chapter 82 Beastman Empire (2nd Release, Seeking Recommendations)\n\"Beastman Empire?\"\nQuik was startled. Although he didn’t know where Austin had heard this name, he didn’t doubt it. So, he revealed the information he happened to have heard:\n\"Rumor has it that many years ago, there once stood a vast empire established by the beastmen on the Civilized Land. From east to west, it spanned almost the entire continent. Some even say that the whole Kawa Great Forest was a part of that vast empire.\"\n\"It’s said that at that time, the beastmen dominated the entire continent. Elves, dwarves, and even humans all lived under the shadow of that massive empire, surviving at the mercy of the beastmen. But later, the entire empire collapsed overnight for unknown reasons, leaving no trace behind.\"\n\"Afterward, with the collapse of the Beastman Empire, various races went to war. Eventually, humans emerged victorious, forming the current human-dominated landscape on the continent, while the beastmen originally scattered throughout the continent were driven to the Kawa Great Forest, this Barbaric Land.\"\n\"Actually, Your Highness, the legend of the Beastman Empire is simply a mythical tale passed down by word of mouth among the upper echelons of large tribes within Kawa Great Forest. It shouldn’t be taken seriously.\"\nQuik, the Fox-faced Man, looked at the Blue Young Dragon, carefully advising.\nIn his mind, these legends were merely the delusional fantasies of the beastmen struggling to survive in the Kawa Great Forest, dreaming of a better life. When a beastman enduring a tough life tells a story of that fanciful empire to a companion, it gets passed around by word of mouth, eventually becoming the tale of the Beastman Empire among the beastmen of Kawa Great Forest.\nAustin didn’t take a stand on Quik’s opinion.\nEven without that Beast Skin Notes, Austin wouldn’t think these legends were baseless.\nHowever, if what the Beast Skin Notes described were true, that the remnants of the Beastman Empire, those pure-blooded beastmen, ended up in Kawa Great Forest, it might cause considerable trouble for Austin’s plans in the future.\n\"Then what about the pure-blooded beastmen? Have you ever heard of this name?\"\nFrom the information in that notebook, it wasn’t hard to deduce that the so-called pure-blooded beastmen should be the remnants of the upper echelons of that Beastman Empire. According to the mage’s classification, Austin’s clan underlings should be half-beastmen.\nPure-blooded beastmen, could they be those green-skins? Where did they go, and why has he never seen those green-skins?\n\"Pure-blooded beastmen, what are they?\" Quik showed a look of confusion.\nThis was somewhat unexpected for Austin. Even Quik didn’t know anything about the pure-blooded beastmen, indicating there likely weren’t any rumors about pure-blooded beastmen among the beastman tribes within Kawa Great Forest, or else that mage would have had no success after searching this land for three years.\n\"Forget it, anyway, Kawa Great Forest is so vast, comparable to a Russia in the previous life. Even if they really are in some corner, for now, the chances of encountering them are slim to none.\"\nVery quickly, Austin put the matters of the Beastman Empire and pure-blooded beastmen behind him.\nHowever, this incident served as a reminder to Austin that this world is vast and dangerous. To live well, one must strive to grow stronger.\nAnyway, Austin had long decided that until he himself is strong enough or his clan of underlings has grown in power, he must lay low and cannot carelessly venture out.\nAlthough there is some desire to see the outside world, it’s still safer to stay nestled in the home base.\n...\nAs time slowly passed, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe entered a period of peaceful development, beginning to digest and absorb the results of recent conquests.\nIn fact, before this, the continuous wars and annexation of nearby small tribes had already left the beastmen somewhat weary. To ensure the absorption of a large number of captives and the production of enough food, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe was virtually operating at full capacity.\nAfter breaking through the Centaur Tribe, where over two hundred centaurs were captured, the number of captives the entire Dragon Nest Tribe could accommodate had reached its limit. Thus, the cessation of warfare was only natural.\nNext, there was a period of adjustment and consolidation to undertake.\nWhile Austin continued to use electric current stimulation to train and grow his dragon body, he also began clearing up the gradually bloated internal affairs.\nThe first issue was food cultivation. Several battles had increased the Dragon Nest Tribe’s population to a frightening number of over fourteen hundred, with daily food consumption at astronomical figures.\nLogically, with the Dragon Nest Tribe’s current territory covering only a mere twenty to thirty kilometers radius, it would by no means be able to support the consumption of over fourteen hundred people.\nAround the Dragon Nest, there are neither plentiful orchards nor bountiful fishing grounds, nor does it border any human frontier from which food can be seized.\nYet, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe had achieved food self-sufficiency for everyone, something that all Dragon Nest Tribe beastmen, including Quik the Fox-faced Man and Vini the Kobold, knew was entirely due to the great and noble His Highness the Blue Dragon.\nLeading the beastmen to open up farming, he spearheaded the age of agricultural cultivation. The high-yielding kudzu root solved the food scarcity encountered due to the rapid expansion of the Dragon Nest Tribe, ensuring that as long as steady development continued, the tribe would be free from starvation worries forever.\nNow in the eyes of the beastmen across the tribe, Austin held a status akin to a saint descending to the earth in ancient times from Austin’s previous life.\nHowever, although the tribe formed an intense worship of the dragon, Austin didn’t let it go to his head.\nThough the situation for Dragon Nest Tribe seemed exceptionally promising, problems still existed.\nLooking at the most basic food supply, although the kudzu root yield was decent enough to solve the hunger problem for Dragon Nest beastmen, depending on a single food crop was too risky. Relying the survival of over fourteen hundred people on the success of kudzu root harvest was very dangerous.\nIf the kudzu root were to suffer from any pest or disease, Austin, unfamiliar with pesticide manufacturing, would face crop failure, and the entire Dragon Nest Tribe would be at risk of a famine crisis.\nBecause of this, as Dragon Nest Tribe moved into a smooth development period, Austin began reforming the types of grain being cultivated.\nThe first step was to diversify the food types in the reclaimed farmland,\nUpon harvesting kudzu root, Austin had the beastmen cease planting kudzu vines, only growing them in the latest reclaimed fields, while in the harvested arable plots, they transplanted various edible plants from Kawa Great Forest. This not only ensured sufficient kudzu vine yield to meet the consumption demands of Dragon Nest Beastman Tribe but also sought to achieve diversity in food crops.\nBeastmen were omnivorous, capable of eating many things, much like goblins who could even digest tree bark, so there was a large variety of grains in several fields, a hodgepodge.\nAmong these, the most widely cultivated and slightly less yielded than wild rice were thorn fruits and a plant called earth rice.\nAustin gave it the name earth rice; this plant had abundant scythe-like grass leaves with a developed root system that bulged section by section to a size comparable to grains, which, when cleaned, were translucent with notable starch content. Unfortunately, its yield was even less than thorn fruit, and the harvest was rather inconvenient, not even close to kudzu vines in convenience, but now there were no better options.\nAt the same time, Austin also began having the beastmen open up paddy fields, preparing to plant small quantities of wild rice.\nThough wild rice was yet to be domesticated and far inferior to the hybrid rice from Austin’s previous life, given the current circumstances, it was at least ranked the second most cost-effective grain crop within Dragon Nest Tribe.",

      "content": "Chapter 85: Chapter 83: Finn (3rd update, please subscribe)\nIn his previous life, Austin’s reading interests were wide-ranging, and he had once read such a case.\nIn the eighteenth century, due to the high yield of potatoes, they defeated many other crops and became one of the main crops in the Ireland region. Then, in a certain year, a potato virus swept through the entire Ireland region, leading to a significant reduction in potato output that year, creating a dreadful famine that caused a quarter of the population in the Ireland region to sharply decrease.\nIt was precisely because he remembered that case, that even though the world environment was different, in case of any possibility, Austin still spent great effort to achieve diversification of food species.\nOf course, current planting cannot stop, and even for a relatively long period in the future, kudzu vine might still be the main food of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nBecause even after a few months of development, the stock of kudzu vine within the Dragon Nest Tribe is only enough for the entire tribe’s two-month consumption. As long as no major problems arise, the planting of kudzu vine will always take up most of the fields.\nWhether it’s thorn fruit or earth rice, these two are only insurance against future reduction in kudzu vine yields due to disease.\nAs a result, even though wild rice isn’t fully domesticated and its yield is low, Austin still ordered the beastmen to start planting rice on a small scale to add another layer of protection to the food security of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"It’s a pity that there was only one taro obtained that day. To plant it on a large scale, at least we need to wait a few years until enough seeds are reproduced.\"\nRecalling that taro made Austin somewhat depressed. Later, he even had the centaur leader Chiron lead a team to look around the ruins of that tribe, but in the end, no clues were found.\nAlthough a bit regretful, Austin is not the type to dwell on it. He soon put this regret behind him with a thought.\nAs Austin proceeded with the decision for food crop diversification, the beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe naturally couldn’t stay quiet and uninformed.\nEspecially when it comes to the foundation of the beastmen’s survival and livelihoods, naturally causing quite a stir within the tribe.\nSince whether planting wild rice in paddies or thorn fruit and earth rice on dry land, the effort expended is much greater than simply propagating kudzu vine, this also left the beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe somewhat puzzled.\nIn their view, since planting kudzu vine is both simple and yields a lot, why put in so much effort planting those grain crops which don’t even reach a tenth of the yield of kudzu?\nHowever, despite the puzzlement, none of them had any thought of resistance or objection.\nNot to mention that during military training and transformation, they went through political indoctrination; every beastman knows that it was the most esteemed Lord who initiated the idea of opening land and farming to solve their issues of livelihood, giving them an unparalleled admiration for Austin.\nIn their understanding, being able to fill their stomachs daily, live in warm and comfortable houses, enjoy a safe living environment, and win every battle easily, all are because of the great His Highness Blue Dragon.\nEven if it meant dying for Austin, they would do it without hesitation, let alone just expending more effort to plant other crops.\nMoreover, some beastmen thought that although kudzu vine has been the staple food for the past half year, and compared to the days of hunger, being able to fill the stomach is already very good.\nBut even for beastmen, after solving the issue of food and clothing, they too aspire for better development. Hence, after getting used to kudzu vine, if they could switch to other food, that would also be nice.\n...\nFinn was a deer-man.\nIn the Kawa Great Forest, among many beastman tribes, the status of deer-men was somewhat awkward, caught between the middle and lower tiers.\nAs half-bodied humans, their size was larger than kobolds or jackal wolf people, but deer-men also inherited the characteristics of moose. They were timid and cowardly by nature, often fleeing first when faced with danger, unable to confront powerful beasts preying upon them. Physically, neither their running speed nor endurance could compare to the centaurs.\nDue to many factors, deer-men in mixed beastman tribes often had a status similar to kobolds.\nFinn was a wandering beastman.\nHe was driven out during the cold winter, or more accurately, he escaped himself because at that time, food in the tribe was at rock-bottom, and staying there meant even if he wasn’t starved to death, he might still be eaten by the brutal crocodile-headed leader.\nDuring the cold winter, it was freezing and snowy everywhere, the earth covered by thick ice and snow, even tree roots and bark were hard to find, the stomach felt as if it was burning with hunger, all while facing the cold’s erosion. Countless wandering beastmen were frozen into sculptures before the next day’s sun rose.\nFinn didn’t even dare to recall that period of tough struggle.\nBut miraculously lucky, he struggled through the freezing winter, the snow began to melt, but by then, he was already skin and bones, on the brink of collapse.\nIt was then that he felt the luckiest event in his life happened.\nHe saw a towering black smoke pillar in the distance, after arduous trekking, he finally reached that Dragon Nest tribe’s recruitment location and successfully joined the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nFrom that moment on, he was reborn.\nNo longer would he starve, no longer would he worry about wild beasts attacking while he slept, no longer would he be concerned about having no shelter during rain...\nEven though the Dragon Nest Tribe had various strict regulations, giving a feeling like living in a prison, even if given a choice, Finn would choose the Dragon Nest Tribe without hesitation.\nFor no other reason, simply because here he could fill his stomach.\nThinking of a full meal, Finn couldn’t help but touch his freshly filled belly.\n\"Thank the esteemed lord, thank you for your mercy...\"\nFinn murmured in his heart, praying sincerely.\nHe had reason to do so, for in his heart, there was boundless admiration for the lord above, Austin.\n\"Finn, your wood materials for today have arrived!\"\n\"Oh, alright, coming right away!\"\nA voice came from afar, Finn quickly came to his senses and ran over.\n\"This is all the oak wood for today, move it all into the mushroom house. Stack the raw oak in the corner to dry and decay before using it as a substrate, remember to keep records, perhaps the lord will come to inspect one day.\"\nThe beastman squad leader left after giving his instructions, and Finn began his work for the day.\nHis main work involved moving the pile of oak logs before him into the mushroom house, for the unified mushroom cultivation to produce enough edible mushrooms.",

      "content": "Chapter 86: Chapter 84: Mushrooms (4th update, seeking subscription)\nThe mushroom house is not located within the Dragon Nest Village, but rather beneath a tall and lush area resembling the giant banyan forest from Austin’s previous life.\nThis enormous broadleaf plant, similar to the banyan trees from Austin’s previous life, had yet to be named by the beastmen, so Austin simply named them banyan trees, and the mushroom house is located underneath the banyan forest.\nThese banyan trees of the Otherworld have trunks that require at least ten people to embrace, with dense and lush branches and leaves that completely block out the sky, allowing not a shred of sunlight to come through.\nUnder the tropical rainforest climate of the Kawa Great Forest, a lot of rainwater falls through the gaps in the leaves from above, but once the rain stops, the sunlight above is entirely obscured by the lush banyan leaves, leaving the entire area below humid and muggy, creating a greenhouse-like environment.\nIn such an environment, no herbaceous plants can survive, only some moss covers the soil and spreads across the tree trunks, covering the wrinkled and uneven bark, making the whole area appear as though entering the Underworld.\nBesides moss, another organism thrives in this environment.\nThat would be mushrooms and other fungi.\nThe fallen banyan leaves and branches quickly decompose in this greenhouse setting, and spores attached to the surface begin sprouting and growing in the humid environment, causing mushrooms to bloom one after another.\nThis Otherworld’s banyan forest can be said to be a natural nursery bed for fungal growth.\nAt this time, small, roughly person-high, long rectangular simple thatched huts were built under the banyan forest for the goblins, and these huts are the mushroom houses where the Dragon Nest Division specifically cultivate mushrooms.\nNo one was present under the banyan forest at the time, probably busy elsewhere, but Finn had no intention of slacking off; he moved ot gaze-era the mountainous pile of oak and leftover wood from various manufacturing tools to the banyan forest, then carefully placed each piece of oak inside the mushroom house.\nFinn cherished the days at the Dragon Nest Division where one could get enough to eat by just working, so he worked diligently, even taking care to make several labels on the side.\nIn fact, there was no need for much processing; simply throwing the wood under the banyan forest would cause various mushrooms to grow on it in a few days, though most of these mushrooms were toxic and inedible.\nThis was not surprising. If these mushrooms were not toxic, other animals would have long ago cleaned out the scattered mushrooms and fungi on the ground.\nEven in the Otherworld, it follows the ironclad rule of the survival of the fittest and natural selection.\nAfter countless years of evolution, the spores floating in the air within the mushroom greenhouse under this banyan forest have mostly eliminated the non-toxic ones.\nAustin was indeed greatly elated upon discovering such a treasure trove back then, ambitiously devising a grand mushroom production plan.\nHowever, after poisoning more than ten or eight beastmen, he finally realized that things were far from simple.\nIn this highly advantageous environment, the air was filled with spores of various toxic mushrooms; even if you processed the wood and threw it under the banyan forest, you would still end up with a heap of toxic mushrooms.\nAt his wit’s end, just when Austin planned to abandon the mushroom plan, Finn appeared before him.\nFinn, a deer-man inherently timid and weak, was not adept at hunting and mostly depended on vegetarian food to survive, which included mushrooms in his diet.\nSince Finn was young, he learned from his mother to use his keen nose to distinguish which mushrooms were toxic and which were not, a survival skill and technique honed over generations.\nAnd that is discovering that mushrooms growing on oak are ninety-nine percent non-toxic.\nThe principle behind it, Finn didn’t understand, but this didn’t prevent him from remembering this skill well, relying on it to survive in the harsh forest after the successive death of his parents’ tribe.\nLogically, Finn became responsible for mushroom production and received guidance from Austin, specializing in developing technologies for producing non-toxic mushrooms.\nThese mushroom houses are the product of Finn’s proposal. Although mushrooms growing on outdoor oak are ninety-nine percent non-toxic, possibly due to environmental factors, only about half of the mushrooms stimulated by oak under this banyan forest are non-toxic.\nA fifty percent non-toxic chance would be difficult for large-scale production without a quick method to identify and separate them.\nSubsequently, through Finn’s continuous experimentation, he finally discovered that if oak is isolated within a mushroom house, the probability of toxic mushrooms being triggered can be significantly reduced.\nThe exact principle is unknown, but it does not hinder Finn from continuing to explore and improve.\n\"Hmm, this one?\"\nAfter placing a specially treated piece of oak in a mushroom house, Finn suddenly saw a piece of oak in the corner covered with mushrooms and swiftly pulled it out.\n\"Only three are toxic? That’s great! Quickly check how it was initially processed!\" Finn hurriedly grabbed the record board hanging nearby, which contained barely understandable drawings.\nThese were the initial records, methods taught by Austin, even most of the experimental theories were Austin’s instructions.\n\"First burn it with fire, scorch, and then wash with white mud slurry... Is this the process? Wonderful! Blessings of the heavens, finally found a method!\"\nJoy, great joy, ecstatic joy!\nFinn, the deer-man, was thrilled; after expending so much time, he finally saw hope for success!\n\"Oh, Finn, it seems I came at just the right moment. Is there some progress?\"\nA deep voice echoed in the air, Austin appeared behind the deer-man Finn.\nOf course, he came to check how far the mass production of non-toxic mushrooms had progressed, for Dragon Nest Tribe nowadays, having one more item capable of bulk production offers additional security.\nPreviously, Austin only handed over some of the current experimental selection methods to Finn, a slightly experienced deer-man, simply because he knew more about the non-toxic aspects of mushrooms, hoping to improve mushroom cultivation techniques and realize large-scale non-toxic mushroom production.\nInitially, Austin had little hope for Finn before coming, but now it seems there has been progress?\n...\nFourth completion.\nToday’s update ends here; my head feels utterly dizzy.\nFinally, asking for a monthly ticket (￣▽￣)／",

      "content": "Chapter 87: Chapter 85: Civilization Invasion (1st Update - Subscription Requested)\nIn Finn’s nervous awe and stammering narration, Austin finally understood that it was through burning oak and then soaking it in lime solution that they obtained this oak substrate covered with mushrooms, with only two or three poisonous ones.\nThe lime solution was formed in a cave beneath a cliff by burning the limestone rock inside to create quicklime, which was then mixed with water.\nThis was one of the few chemical formulas Austin remembered, and the lime produced through this reaction was intended by the Goblins for the expansion of houses.\nThe fire caused by the previous attack on the Centaur Tribe gave Austin concern. Upon returning, he ordered the Goblins to quickly remodel the village, changing the wooden and straw structures to brick and tile to prevent fires.\nBesides bricks and tiles, lime was one of the important building materials used, and Finn surprisingly thought of treating with lime solution.\n\"Well done. You’ve done a great job.\"\nPicking up the oak log covered in mushrooms, Austin examined it closely and nodded.\nThe principle wasn’t clear, but comparing it to other oak substrates, it seemed about right.\nDespite some flaws, it already had the potential for large-scale cultivation, providing another layer of assurance to the Dragon Nest Tribe’s food security.\n\"Keep up the good work. Ask Vini to assign you some extra hands to conduct more experiments. You can now start small-scale production.\"\nHearing Austin’s praise and encouragement, Finn was both excited and anxious, feeling like a farmer from Austin’s previous life being received by the country’s highest leader and entrusted with great responsibilities.\nActually, this strategy of casting a wide net and catching more fish originated from Austin himself. Without his initial guidance, Deer-body Finn wouldn’t have thought of these methods nor made such quick progress.\nMoreover, due to Austin’s absolute authority in the Dragon Nest Tribe, and the Beastmen’s strong personal adoration and obedience, instead of being influenced by the Otherworld’s natives, the native Beastmen began to involuntarily learn certain things emanating from Austin.\nCertain traits of modern civilized humans.\nThis slow cultural invasion was occurring like a gentle spring rain, with changes happening that Austin hadn’t noticed.\nWhen Austin traveled to this world, he didn’t bring any advanced science and technology. He didn’t understand aerospace, diving, or information technology, nor did he bring an AI with all human civilization’s knowledge.\nAll he had were the most basic aspects of human civilization, those scientific thoughts he had but unconsciously overlooked.\nIt was the mathematical thinking fostered by nine years of compulsory education plus an additional year of prep school—discovering problems, analyzing them, and finally drawing conclusions.\nAustin hadn’t realized the importance of this scientific mathematical thinking from his previous life, like a fish accustomed to water that never consciously acknowledges the water’s importance.\nHuman societal development, from natural phenomena to various summarized laws, from the laws of thermodynamics to the steam engine starting the industrial revolution, from simple optical principles to telescopes, microscopes, and even subatomic particles and the starry sky.\nAll these never strayed from the scientific research methods formed after generations of scientists, methods of discovery, induction, analysis, and summarization. Even when Austin crossed over, humans could use the most advanced computers for cutting-edge research, but in many areas, the fundamental scientific inquiry method could not be ignored.\nThis thinking, like a fundamental framework, allowed humans to lay more layers, ultimately forming a splendid human civilization.\nNow, the traits of the civilization from Austin’s previous life began to spread like a gentle spring rain, integrating into every aspect of the Dragon Nest Beastman Tribe.\nNow that the Deer-body race successfully developed non-toxic mushroom culturing techniques, it’s undoubtedly related to this scientific thinking method.\nAnd Quik began establishing an Otherworld traditional medicine system, also based on this scientific inductive thought process.\nAs time passed, coupled with Austin’s consistent spreading of scientific thinking during military training and in kindergartens, it would certainly gradually change the thinking of the Clan Beastmen.\nWhen the time comes, this scientific way of thinking will surely begin to form a scientific system centered on this world’s environment.\nFrom nothing, little by little, ultimately establishing a vast framework.\nThat massive foundational system, everything originated from that unique soul within Austin.\n...\nAfter inspecting the mushroom house and telling Finn to continue working hard and start the small-scale production of mushrooms, Austin left the Banyan Forest.\nThe scene at the mushroom house was just one of many episodes in Austin’s reform of food diversification. Before this, he had also inspected the bamboo grove and met with the Beastmen responsible for obtaining food from bamboo shoots.\nBack then, to enhance the Dragon Nest Tribe’s food sources, Austin specifically developed techniques from his past life to process bamboo shoots and bracken, successfully turning these widespread resources into food for the Beastmen.\nAs the tribe developed, the bamboo grove had become another important food source for the Beastmen. Every day, a fixed team of Beastman militia would bring stone hoes and shovels made by the Goblins and go to the bamboo grove to dig up bamboo shoots. They would then hand them over to another team to peel and boil them, transforming the originally bitter shoots into a popular \"delicacy\" for the Beastmen.\nTo obtain more bamboo shoots, the Beastmen, without formal training, even cut down some trees and shrubs in the bamboo grove. Some Beastmen also learned to propagate wisteria, transplanting bamboo branches along riverside areas.\nIt can be expected that within a few years, the riverbanks will be lined with extensive bamboo forests, providing more bamboo shoots for harvest.\nWhile peaceful development focused on agricultural reform was just one aspect, after sorting out food policies, Austin turned his attention to the Goblin Manufacturing Workshop.\nAs the direct source of various implements for the Dragon Nest Tribe, the Goblins’ technologies have developed well in this period.\nOf course, the most important thing was to see if the Goblins could manufacture bows and arrows, in preparation for Austin’s upcoming military reform.",

      "content": "Chapter 88: Chapter 86 Bow and Arrow Manufacturing (2nd update, please subscribe)\nAt this moment in the Dragon Nest Village, aside from the tall brick and tile structure of the central administrative hall, goblins were also busily reconstructing and modifying the wooden and straw houses around it.\nThis reconstruction plan had been ongoing ever since Austin vanquished the Centaur Tribe, though of course it could only progress slowly, with most of the work involving gradual modifications to the original wooden and straw houses.\nAs a result, aside from the central administrative hall, some of the other houses appeared to be a mix of brick, wood, and straw materials. This ancient, rustic Otherworld style always gave Austin a peculiar feeling.\nHowever, after the renovations, each house had a reasonable layout, and with the combination of bricks and stones, they were somewhat better equipped to handle fires. Austin had no choice but to begrudgingly accept this.\nIn Austin’s ideal vision, the Dragon Nest Village would have the tiled roof structure of Jiangnan from his past life, but for now, given the current manpower of the Dragon Nest Tribe, this was the best that could be achieved. Austin understood the wisdom of patience.\nAfter all, the newly established Dragon Nest Tribe had many tasks requiring urgent attention and could not afford to spend too much precious manpower on housing.\nThe goblin manufacturing workshop was not far from the plaza. It was an area for producing items like wooden spears and stone tools that the tribe needed for daily life. This \"workshop\" was just a construction site with a large canopy to provide some shade and protection from the rain.\nOn both sides of the workshop were piles of timber, serving as the raw material for making various tools.\nWithin the entire workshop, the ground was littered with fragments and debris, primarily offcuts from the manufacturing process. Once these scraps accumulated, they would be moved to the kitchen for burning or to the mushroom room for fostering mushroom growth.\nIn the center of the canopy, there was a massive flat stone, on which were piled various rough manufacturing tools made by the goblins, such as stone axes, stone chisels, grinding stones, millstones, and so on.\nAt this moment, Austin was with a group of goblins gathered in a corner of the manufacturing workshop, picking up a bent bow arm and trying to bend it back with force.\n\"Your Highness, according to those centaurs, the oak they use for their bow arms requires a year of curing in the shade, and must undergo several processes, making it impossible to manufacture longbows in a short time.\"\nA goblin with a crafty look on his face babbled on the side. His name was Gulu, an early member of the Dragon Nest Tribe. Due to his high level of awareness and some managerial skills, along with a bit of technical expertise, he became the manager of the manufacturing workshop.\n\"However, arrows can be manufactured relatively quickly. Because there is a large demand for wooden spears, we’ve developed a very complex grinding wheel tool. By altering the groove sizes of this tool, we’ve significantly increased the speed of arrow production.\"\nAs he spoke, Goblin Gulu proudly showcased the very complex grinding wheel tool to Austin, claiming it was a tool developed after a lot of brainstorming by the goblins.\nHowever, when Austin saw the grinding wheel, his eyelid twitched slightly. It was not very complex; it was just a granite stone the size of a washbasin with a hole drilled in the middle and supported by a very hard ironwood axle. By rotating wooden handles on either side, the stone was spun to sharpen the tip of the wooden spears.\nDespite its simplicity, Austin couldn’t just invent it out of thin air. It was a tool thought up by the goblins after long, tedious labor, an inspiration sparked during repeating tasks.\nOf course, the grinding wheel tool was very crude. It required hand torque for power, which was exhausting, had very primitive transmission methods, and the supporting axle wore out very quickly, needing frequent replacement.\nYet, it was indeed a product of the goblins’ true wisdom, rather than a reproduction based on Austin’s past world knowledge.\nHaving a beginning is always a good thing for the future.\nUpon seeing this primitive grinding tool, Austin immediately thought of improving the transmission method to a gear system, powered by foot pedal or even further by utilizing a water wheel.\nHowever, the issue was with the materials.\nAs Austin mused, Goblin Gulu couldn’t help but boast on the side:\n\"With this grinding wheel, the time we used to make one wooden spear has now been increased to more than three. The arrows used by the centaurs are essentially just smaller wooden spears. The centaurs said that making one arrow took them half a day, but after our grinding wheel modifications, we can make at least twenty in a day.\"\nThe arrows used by the centaurs weren’t just simple things. Without iron for arrowheads and in a world where most creatures had tough skin, simple wooden or bamboo arrows couldn’t penetrate. Thus, the arrow shafts used by the centaurs weren’t easy to manufacture.\nThe material for making arrow shafts was a tree that the centaurs called \"Arrow Wood,\" growing in rocky wastelands, about the size of a toe, straight as an arrow. Both its weight and quality were comparable to iron, and most importantly, near its roots, it formed a bump suitable for sharpening into a sharp arrowhead, making the entire trunk a qualified arrow shaft.\nThese arrow shafts had lethality close to that of steel-made arrows, which was one reason the Dragon Nest Beastmen suffered significantly when attacking the Centaur Tribe.\nHowever, while these arrow shafts were incredibly lethal, their steel-like quality made them extremely difficult to manufacture. To the centaurs, each arrow was almost like an heirloom tool.\nThis was why centaurs rarely used bows and arrows in battle. Their pride was one reason, but the high cost was another.\nNow, the goblins had accelerated the grinding process through the grinding wheel tool, drastically increasing the arrow shaft production speed—tens or even hundreds of times faster than the centaurs.\n\"Very good, ingenious. I’m glad to see you’ve learned to think independently. Who came up with this idea? They deserve credit.\"\nAustin couldn’t overlook the goblin who invented this tool. The knowledge from his past life was limited, and the future path would require the Clan to tread new paths through trial and error.\nFor now, the goblins were evidently doing a good job.",

      "content": "Chapter 89: Chapter 87 Discussion (3rd update, please subscribe)\nNo technology ever falls from the sky, and what His Highness Austin remembers is limited. The future paths can only be explored step by step by the Beastman Race, and now, the goblins have clearly made the first step in independent creation.\nLater, from Gulu’s somewhat embarrassed words, it was learned that this idea came from him. However, when manufacturing the grindstone, a group of goblins in the manufacturing workshop also helped, offering various improvements.\nIn response, His Highness Austin naturally gave them good encouragement, causing the goblins present to be thrilled.\nEven before capturing the centaurs, His Highness Austin had considered forming an archer team to give the Dragon Nest Tribe corps long-range attack capabilities.\nSadly, at that time, the bows and arrows made from bamboo bows were so weak they couldn’t even kill a hare, and the idea was shelved.\nIt wasn’t until encountering the Centaur Tribe that Austin picked up the idea again.\nHowever, unfortunately, although the centaurs mastered the method of crafting bows and arrows, manufacturing a sufficient quantity of them was still fraught with difficulties.\nFirst, not to mention the materials used for the longbow limbs, even if Austin stockpiles oak materials now, it will take at least a year to mature.\nAlthough longbows cannot be produced in a short time, the centaurs already have existing longbows. While the wealth among the Centaur Tribe varies and not every centaur owns a longbow, at least close to a hundred sets can be taken out.\nThe real problem lies in the arrows. The ordinary arrows, not to mention the issue of processing, can at most kill hares, but against heavier enemies, they are of no real use.\nFor instance, with Minotaurs, a wave of arrows might at best graze their skin, making such arrows worthless.\nTo have sufficient power, arrows must be made with Arrow Wood, yet the processing difficulty of Arrow Wood is too high, resulting in only one or two arrows after spending a lot of time.\nIn real warfare, after firing one or two waves of arrows, they’re gone. Although Arrow Wood arrows can be reused, during chaotic battles, how can one rush onto the battlefield to retrieve and shoot them again?\nIt’s simply impossible.\nTherefore, even with the centaurs’ bow and arrow techniques, forming a qualified archer team remains difficult.\nBut now, with the goblins greatly accelerating arrow production, Austin has gained a certain foundation for forming archers.\n\"Produce more arrows during this time, and also produce ordinary arrows,\"\nLooking at the Arrow Wood arrows, feeling their different texture and weight compared to ordinary arrows, Austin pondered before speaking.\nHearing this, Gulu looked slightly bewildered.\n\"Your Highness, ordinary arrows are not powerful, should we just produce Arrow Wood arrows?\"\n\"No, ordinary ones are needed, as are Wooden Spears and Wooden Shields. You’ll have to work hard during this time to produce more. If manpower is insufficient, apply directly to Vini.\"\nAustin said somberly,\nThe ordinary arrows have their uses in daily training, and if poison is applied to the arrowheads, even a graze can have the maximum effect.\nPreviously, Austin hadn’t thought of using poison because he couldn’t find a suitable toxin, but just now, after visiting the mushroom room, he suddenly thought of whether the poisonous mushrooms inside could serve as toxins?\nIt was unknown if there were any more virulent poisonous mushrooms, but it had to be tried.\n\"You did very well, I’m very pleased with your work in the manufacturing workshop. You must be bold in thinking, like this grindstone you’ve made very well. But don’t be complacent, try using foot power or utilizing river water outside for power.\"\nNext, Austin introduced gears and transmission mechanisms to the goblins. It seemed during discussions about gears, the surrounding goblins’ eyes gleamed with excitement.\nLooking at the goblins gathered around like attentive students, Austin suddenly thought if a painter were here, this scene could be captured as a painting.\nThe painting, depicting a young dragon about two to three meters high under the workshop’s top, surrounded by attentive goblins, with various early rudimentary tools scattered around.\nSuch a painting, if the Dragon Nest Empire is established and sweeps across the continent, might become treasured historical data a few hundred years later for historians studying His Highness Austin’s groundbreaking efforts with the goblins?\nOf course, these chaotic thoughts merely flashed by.\nFuture success is uncertain, and Austin never expected to become a relic for later generations to gaze upon in pictures.\nAfter briefly teaching what little he knew about gear transmissions and waterwheel knowledge to the goblins, Austin said:\n\"Alright, you can try manufacturing those things when you return. Are there any issues with the manufacturing workshop now?\"\nRegarding gears and waterwheels, Austin knew little, and at least he couldn’t produce them himself, only leave it to the goblins to explore.\nThe goblins looked at each other, seemingly without questions.\nHowever, after thinking for a moment, Goblin Gulu raised his hand slowly.\n\"Your Highness, the biggest problem in the workshop right now is that the tool materials are too prone to damage, do you have any solutions?\"\n\"Yes, even if the grindstone’s shaft is made with Iron Wood, it would be damaged within two or three days.\"\n\"And those stone axes become dull quickly.\"\n\"Stone hoes are also difficult to manufacture and are too easily damaged.\"\nSpeaking of this, the goblins in the workshop began chattering, looking towards Austin.\nAfter witnessing the profound knowledge about waterwheels and gears Austin imparted earlier, to the goblins, Austin had become the wisest dragon and was expected to have solutions.\n\"You needn’t worry about that, just manufacture more arrows, Wooden Spears, and Wooden Shields during this time. Before long, everything will change.\"\nAustin’s tone was low yet somewhat enigmatic, his eyes subtly nuanced.\nThe best way to change the problem of tools wearing out easily is, of course, to switch to copper and iron.\nPausing before, despite knowing of a location with copper mines, Austin hadn’t pursued them due to strength constraints, only preparing by burning large amounts of charcoal for refining copper.\nNow, it seems the timing is near.\nOf course, before that, there’s another thing to do.\nThat is military reform.",

      "content": "Chapter 90: Chapter 88: 4 Major Corps (Part 4)\nThe Copper and Iron issue has always been a thorn in Austin’s side ever since the discovery of Copper Ore in the mountain range that day. Austin has been eyeing that Jackal Wolfman Tribe to the north, waiting for his Clan’s power to grow strong enough to take them down.\nHowever, as time went on, Austin was shocked to find that the development speed of that Jackal Wolfman Tribe was in no way inferior to his own Dragon’s Nest Tribe!\nThis was incredible,\nThe Dragon’s Nest Tribe has been \"cheating\" for its subordinate clan, with Dragon Nest Beastmen sweeping through one tribe after another with unbeatable superiority, constantly expanding in size to get to the scale it is today. Meanwhile, Austin has had to solve numerous difficulties during this period.\nBut what on earth did that Jackal Wolfman Tribe rely on to break through a population of over a thousand in just half a year?\nNot to mention other things, just the food issue alone, in this hundred-mile radius, merely hunting and gathering with Beastmen’s current primitive methods can’t possibly sustain a tribe of a thousand people.\nWhere does the Jackal Wolfman Tribe get its food? They don’t farm, so how do they sustain such a large food consumption?\nPlus, after the last cold winter, the micro tribe established by Lizardman Rodney was breached. Rodney was then captured while attacking the Dragon’s Nest Tribe, and it was learned from him that the leader of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe is likely a Bronze Level Extraordinary Professional.\nAn Extraordinary Professional means possessing the key to extraordinary power, a Breathing Technique.\nTo possess a Breathing Technique, one’s identity can’t be simple, and it was then Austin saw a fog appear around the leader of the nearby Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nCombining all these factors, the only possibility is that the Jackal Wolfman Tribe is backed by significant origins, possibly even strong supporters, to support the rapid population expansion of the whole tribe.\nUnderstanding this made Austin increasingly uneasy. As the urge to eradicate it grew stronger, he became even more cautious.\nAfter half a year of laying low until now, Austin’s forces have expanded rapidly from a few Beastmen to now nine Dragon Vein Attendants, quasi-warrior type extraordinaries, possessing two magical items belonging to Fox-faced Man Quik, and are fully mobilized to assemble a legion of fourteen hundred.\nThis formidable strength gave Austin the confidence to confront the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, and with the attack and capture of the Centaur Tribe, the Dragon’s Nest Tribe has now experienced a peaceful period for over half a month. With several seasons of harvests of kudzu root, food is not lacking, and the Dragon Nest Beastmen are in high spirits.\nThe day of war with the Jackal Wolfman Tribe is already within reach.\nAustin has ordered the Goblins in the manufacturing workshop to speed up the production of arrows, Wooden Spears, Wooden Shields, and various weapons to prepare for the war with the Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nDuring this time of preparation, Austin began implementing military reforms on the main strength of the Dragon’s Nest Tribe.\n\"The differences between different races are somewhat obvious after all.\"\nOn the huge square, looking at the uneven heights of the Beastmen, Austin pondered secretly.\nIn the early development of the Dragon’s Nest Tribe, due to the scarcity of population, Austin had to implement a policy of all citizens being soldiers. Even different races of Beastmen were grouped into the same corps, and during warfare, they would gather into formations, pushing forward mindlessly.\nThis group-style combat method showed a powerful advantage against other Beastmen tribes that were not even on a rogue fighting level, relying on excellent discipline and coordination to defeat enemies many times larger.\nLater, as the Dragon’s Nest Tribe grew in population, allowing limited configurations, Austin directly distinguished between the formal corps and production militia through physical fitness.\nThe formal corps was responsible for warfare, often trained more, and also undertook hunting tasks.\nThe production militia mainly managed production, although they had a certain amount of military training every day, most were engaged in opening up land and farming basic production activities.\nAt that stage, the selection criteria between the formal corps and militia were physical fitness, with strong advances and weaker retreats. Although some inherently weak races gradually retired from the formal corps, within the formal corps, it was still a mixed racial army.\nAfter the Minotaur Tribe, Rat Tribe, and Centaur Tribe were successively annexed, when expanding the formal corps and absorbing fresh blood, if the selection was only based on physical fitness, it would make the differences between individual races within the formal corps greater, hindering some dominant races’ combat strength.\nWith the capture of Centaurs, the emergence of Bow and Arrow weapons, the military reform was logical.\nThe military reform’s concept was simply to maximize the advantages between various Beastman races.\n\"Minotaurs are large, strong in strength, but clumsy in body and tactics, can hold a Wooden Shield in one hand and a spear in the other, serving as Gun Shield Soldiers, as the main force in frontal engagement.\"\nLooking at each race in the field, Austin slowly thought.\n\"The Jackal Wolf People and Kobolds resemble each other, their ability to withstand frontal attacks is relatively weaker than Minotaurs, but they are agile and can cooperate well in small groups, suitable for playing group power in melee, thus can serve as pure Gun Corps, following the Minotaurs. When Minotaurs charge into enemy formations and engage hand-to-hand, they can join the melee as reinforcements, maximizing their advantage strength.\"\n\"Centaurs run fast, have stamina, can serve as a pursuit force after Minotaurs and Jackal Wolf People defeat enemy tribes, meanwhile they have Bows and Arrows, can perform long-range suppression before engagement.\"\n\"And Ratmen, although not good at frontal confrontation, have better night vision and high alertness, can select a few as Scouts.\"\nAfter considering the various advantages and disadvantages, Austin decided on the route for military reform.\nFirstly, one hundred of the strongest Minotaurs were selected, formed into a separate regiment, trained as the Gun Shield Corps, serving as the forefront vanguard in military warfare.\nNext, two to three hundred Jackal Wolf People and Kobolds were selected, also formed into a separate regiment, trained as the Gun Corps, serving as follow-up support behind the Minotaurs, leveraging group output advantage after Minotaurs charge into enemy tribes.\nFinally, the Cavalry Archery Corps of Centaurs was selected, forming a regiment of one hundred Centaurs as the Cavalry Archery Corps, responsible for early harassment and later pursuit.\nAdditionally, some elite Ratmen were selected as Scouts to facilitate tracking enemy traces.\nThree major corps, totaling five hundred, accounting for over one-third of the Dragon’s Nest Tribe.\nOf course, these three major corps were not entirely detached, even Austin couldn’t afford that, only compared to other militia corps, their training was slightly higher.\nAfter gradually forming the three major corps, they began intense training, various tactics, coordinated operations began to come into play successively.\nUnder hardworking training, only waiting for an explosion one day.\n...\nThe fourth update is complete, hands tired, brain more tired.\nFinally, asking for some recommendation votes, monthly votes.",

      "content": "Chapter 91: Chapter 89: Investigation\nConcerning the reform of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s Beastman Legion, it has been underway for a while. With the full operation of the Goblin Manufacturing Workshop, the equipment for the three major legions was nearly complete after a dozen days.\nThe Wooden Spears, needless to say, are the main consumables of the Dragon Nest Tribe daily. The Manufacturing Workshop is already very familiar with the production process of Wooden Spears, so it is not too difficult.\nThe issue lies in the Wooden Shields used by the Minotaur Gun Shield Soldiers. Lacking suitable knives and axes, these Wooden Shields were mostly rough, irregular, thick planks simply shaved and then bound with vines in large loops to hold securely at the back.\nLizardman Rodney, captured during a cold winter, contributed an Iron Axe, reportedly looted in the chaos when a Great Tribe was overrun. However, amidst the heavy workload, that Iron Axe had deteriorated significantly and could only just about chop wood.\nWithout that severely damaged Iron Axe, completing dozens of Wooden Shields in a short time would have been impossible, and more refined work was clearly out of reach, making these Wooden Shields particularly coarse.\nThese Wooden Shields, as always, are simple and rugged in style, but quite effective defensively. They are decent defensive tools amidst the chaos of Orcs using mainly Wooden and Stone Spears in warfare.\nIn terms of arrow shafts, basically, every Centaur was equipped with two arrows made of Arrow Wood. Ordinary arrows are not yet equipped, and the idea of smearing ordinary arrowheads with poison mushrooms is still being tested.\nMoreover, besides bows and arrows, the Centaurs are also equipped with a Wooden Spear for close combat or when serving as cavalry charging.\nWith equipment in place and after a period of training and coordination, the three major legions have taken shape. As for their combat power, it’s still undetermined without actual combat, but with the orderly division of legion assaults, it’s far better organized than before.\nCurrently, the Dragon Nest Tribe is well-armed with bows and steeds ready, and the Beastman soldiers are fervent and eager, fully prepared for war.\nHowever, Austin did not immediately dispatch troops but had the three major legions continue rehearsals in the square.\nAustin is not a rash dragon; before deploying troops, he had to at least gather intelligence on the enemy.\nAfter deciding on the expedition plan, Austin took to the air from the Dragon Nest, heading toward the Centaur Tribe to the north.\nHe didn’t bring along any other Beastman Clans, believing that flying alone gave him more advantages for reconnaissance. Bringing Beastmen would only be a burden.\nEven though Austin acted independently, it didn’t mean the ground Beastman Legion was idle. At least the elite Ratmen scouting team Austin meticulously selected had already set out, exploring toward the Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nAfter all, the Beastmen, unlike Austin, are constrained by terrain when marching.\nThanks to their timid and cautious nature, the Ratmen are best suited as scouts to detect danger.\nFlying northward, Austin kept a constant watch on the forest movements below. After over an hour, he finally neared the Jackal Wolfman Tribe’s territory.\nWhile it only took Austin a little over an hour to fly, it would take the Beastmen at least a full day of marching.\nUpon nearing the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, Austin didn’t immediately land but instead hovered and flew above, observing the tribe from the air.\nAhead, on the vast plain of mountains, there was a large section of trees missing in some area; that spot was where the Jackal Wolfman Village was located, surrounded by wooden walls as primitive barricades.\nInside the walls, a chaotic mix of wood and straw houses stood haphazardly, varying in height, creating a mess of a village. Despite the disorder, the number of these structures reached almost a hundred, with the center being a massive stone house constructed from stone, exuding an aura of rough intensity and dominance.\nCentrally located around the giant stone house, other houses radiated outward, and the outermost wood-straw houses were the most disordered.\nJudging by the number of houses, the Jackal Wolfman Tribe’s population wouldn’t be less than a thousand. Moreover, in this Kawa Great Forest, each tribe could become combatants with a Wooden Spear, meaning Austin must face over a thousand enemies if he attacked the Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\n\"What’s going on here?\"\nCircling from a distance, Austin’s sharp vision allowed him to notice the Jackal Wolf People moving in and out of their homes, arousing confusion in him.\nThe sense of incongruity grew stronger.\nThose Jackal Wolf People in the village were mainly adults, robust and tall, with no signs of any children or elders. Furthermore, the tribe was not just Jackal Wolf People; there were many Half-Beastmen of various other races, all strong and powerful, upper-ranking within Beastmen races.\nThe Jackal Wolfman Tribe seemed not focused on production. Most members engaged in construction and transporting materials using giant beasts resembling rhinos.\nTo Austin, the whole tribe resembled... a military fortress!\nHarboring many doubts, Austin turned and swiftly approached the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, especially targeting the transport convoy to get closer and gather intelligence.\nIn nearly primal Kawa Great Forest, plenty of giant beasts occasionally soar through the skies, so the Jackal Wolfmen paid little attention to Austin swooping from a distance, unaware it was a Blue Dragon.\nBut as Austin got closer, he instantly alerted the Beastman below.\n\"Dragon! Dragon! A dragon is attacking!\"\nWith a chilling shout, the entire tribe instantly descended into chaos, like a flock of panicked sheep.\nSome Beastmen scattered in all directions, while more raised their weapons, hurling them skyward.\nAustin didn’t initially worry about the power of these projectiles, as over half of them fell before reaching his flying height, and those that did were weak and ineffective after traveling such a distance.\nYet the next moment, an eerie light flared in the Beastman crowd, and a ripple of Magic Power spread. A sense of foreboding suddenly surged through Austin.\n\"Not good!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 92: Chapter 90 Dark Elf\nA flash of cold light appeared, and a sense of danger suddenly surged up in my heart. Austin, who was originally flying high in the sky, flapped his wings suddenly, causing his enormous body to sway to the side under the force of the generated whirlwind.\nAt the same time,\nWhoosh!\nAn arrow glowing with magical brilliance shot out abruptly from the group of Beastmen below, tearing through the air with a sharp, icy aura, and flew closely past Austin’s side.\nAustin’s heart palpitated intensely, and he felt a wave of lingering fear. If it weren’t for his sharp eyes spotting that trace of magical light earlier, he might have been hit by this arrow.\nThere was no doubt about the power of the arrow that narrowly missed earlier, just seeing the magical runes shining on the arrow shaft was enough to confirm its potency.\nEven though Austin’s body was much larger compared to other young dragons due to frequent electric stimulation training, he was still just a three-year-old young dragon.\nWith the lifespan of an adult Giant Dragon often reaching up to a thousand years, compared to humans, he was just a three-month-old baby. His dragon scales might provide resistance against magic and could fend off a Fireball Technique, but against this kind of enchanted arrow, it was impossible to be instantly killed by the wound, though he would surely be injured.\n\"Damn it! How could this Jackal Wolfman Tribe have such enchanted arrows!\"\nAustin cursed inwardly, cold sweat dripping down, not daring to linger any longer. His form twisted in the air, quickly fleeing away.\nThe Jackal Wolfman Tribe before him was evidently not to be trifled with. If he got injured by an arrow and fell from the sky, the entire Jackal Wolfman Tribe would likely come out in full force, and he would probably die before achieving his goals.\n\"Enchanted arrows, either inscribed and enchanted by human mages or totem enchanted by Beastman priests—this stuff, while more common than magical artifacts, is definitely not something an ordinary tribe can acquire. Could this damned Jackal Wolfman Tribe have a Beastman Priest?\"\nAfter flying far away from the domain of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, Austin gazed in their direction. If dragons had brows, his would certainly be furrowed tightly now.\nIn dragon heritage, there is naturally no lack of introductions to weapons like enchanted arrows, which are among the greatest threats to the Dragon Race, making Austin feel even more troubled.\nThis place is quite distant from the Human World, and even the borders of the Kawa Great Forest, making it highly unlikely that the enchanted arrows were made by mages.\nThat leaves the possibility that they were created by a Beastman priest.\nIf a Beastman priest is indeed involved, it becomes even more of a hassle, as a Beastman priest adds considerable strength to a Beastman Tribe.\n\"What is going on with this Jackal Wolfman Tribe? Could there be a Beastman priest in it?\"\nPreviously, Rodney mentioned that the entire Jackal Wolfman Tribe was led by someone named Simon, who very likely was a Bronze Level Extraordinary Professional. He settled here after the tribe was established, moving from some unknown location. When the cold winter arrived, they were attacked by Jackal Wolf People, and if not for fleeing quickly, they probably couldn’t have escaped at all.\nAt that time, when Austin passed by, he discovered the ruins of Rodney’s destroyed tribe and followed the traces to locate the Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nBack then, the entire Jackal Wolfman Tribe, all of whom were robust adults, numbered at most around two hundred, occupying a corner on the mountainside. It was during this time that Austin discovered a Bronze Ore near their location.\nNow, combining his observations of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe’s circumstances, it became apparent that there was something uncanny about this Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\n\"No, perhaps the Jackal Wolfman Tribe has a Beastman priest, but the rapid expansion and development of the whole tribe would not be solely because of the priest.\"\nThe entire tribe consisted purely of able-bodied members and did not engage in production, only busy with transporting materials...\nIt seemed more like an army.\n\"If that’s the case, then it’s all the more troublesome.\"\nAt this moment, an indecisive wavering had arisen in Austin’s heart about whether or not to attack this Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nNot attacking would be due to the unknown strength of the opponent. The power of his entire Dragon Nest Tribe might not decimate the enemy as easily as before and, perhaps, might not even be a match for them.\nBut attacking raised concerns about why such a strange and powerful Jackal Wolfman Tribe was situated here in the first place, and fear of them becoming more formidable and potentially sending raiders to slay dragons in the future.\n\"Forget it, let’s go back first.\"\nReluctantly, with full of vacillation, Austin flew towards the direction of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAlthough today’s exploration might have alerted the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, Austin did not regret it. At least if he hadn’t taken the risk to investigate from the sky and discovered the deeper-seated hidden strength of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, waging a war in ignorance could have resulted in greater losses and possibly even failure.\n...\nRight after Austin departed, in the Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nA figure bearing a bow and arrow, with a face hidden under a cloak and a well-proportioned build, stepped away from the transport team, exited the tribe gates, and walked towards the stone house hall.\nUpon entering the hall, the light suddenly dimmed.\nThe figure then took off the cloak, revealing two pointed ears.\nWith black skin exuding a constant dark aura, a well-proportioned body, an elegant face, and two pointed ears, it was undoubtedly a Dark Elf.\n\"Lord Grom, a Blue Young Dragon just flew over and I drove it away.\"\nThe Dark Elf knelt half-heartedly on the ground toward a shadow in the hall resembling a small hill.\n\"Is it the Blue Young Dragon that Hog mentioned to the south? We ignored it before due to lack of time, but since it has come, we can only kill it.\"\nIn the darkness, the shadow sat on a massive main seat, speaking in a voice as deep as muffled thunder, resonating with an imposing pressure like a mountain throughout the hall.\n\"Go, take Hog and Simon with you, and bring back that young dragon’s head for me!\"\nThe mountainous shadow, seated on the main seat, issued an undisputable command to the Dark Elf, with a thunderous sound akin to a mentally oppressive tidal flood.\n\"Yes, my Lord!\"\nThe Dark Elf placed one hand on his chest, bowed with respect, and slowly retreated.\nUpon walking out of the hall doors, the Dark Elf glanced at the sun in the sky, frowned slightly, and pulled the cloak’s hood back over his head.\nFor some reason, the Dark Elf felt in his heart that things wouldn’t be this simple, but orders from Lord Grom were not something he could oppose.\n\"Better go find Hog and Simon first; they were the first to arrive here and the first to discover the Blue Young Dragon among the Jackal Wolf People, they should know something.\"\nThinking so, the Dark Elf concealed within the cloak, headed towards the village’s gathering area.",

      "content": "Chapter 93: Chapter 91: Initial Movement (3rd update, please subscribe)\n\"The Blue Young Dragon in the south? I investigated it during the last cold winter when I was scouting the nearby environment. How should I put it? It’s the strangest dragon I’ve ever seen. Although its size suggests it’s only in its juvenile stage, it has already gathered a clan of over a hundred people. However, it seems like it might be a wild orphan dragon without parental care, so there’s no need to worry too much.\"\nThe Dark Elf found the Jackal Wolfman Hog and heard this kind of introduction.\n\"Hog mentioned the dragon to me before, but at that time, the camp was in the construction phase, and it coincided with welcoming Master Grom, so we didn’t pay much attention. Lord Adinlek, does Master Grom have any instructions?\"\nAt this time, the Jackal Wolfman leader Simon also spoke.\nWhen Simon initially came here to establish a forward base and clear the surrounding tribal area, Hog, following his orders, discovered the Dragon Nest Tribe along the southern smoke column.\nHowever, later on, Simon and the others were busy with other matters, and even though it was just an infant Young Dragon, combined with a clan tribe of over a hundred people, their Bronze Level strength might not be enough to handle it. So they reported the dragon’s situation to Master Grom and didn’t pay much more attention.\nIn fact, during this time, the entire tribe was busy transporting and constructing. Nearby small micro tribes avoided moving away from this area. They were not very aware of Austin’s repeated war activities nearby and didn’t focus on the Dragon Nest Tribe, so they were unaware of the changes within the Dragon Nest Tribe over the past half-year.\nIndeed, who would have thought a Young Dragon’s tribe could grow from seven people a year ago to thousands now? The Dark Elves, bound by common sense, naturally believed the Blue Young Dragon only had a clan of one or two hundred people.\nAnd this also doomed the tragedy of their operation this time.\n\"That dragon just flew over. Lord Grom commands: bring back its head to present to him. You go gather some manpower, prepare a hundred, no, three hundred people, and bring along the Black Rhinoceros Horn.\"\nUnderstanding the Blue Young Dragon’s strength, the Dark Elf conveyed Grom’s order to the two.\nJust because of a faint unease in his heart, the Dark Elf decided to take more troops to ensure safety.\n\"Do we really need three hundred people to deal with just a Young Dragon...\"\nThe Jackal Wolfman leader Simon was a bit puzzled but ultimately didn’t voice it and went down with Hog to assemble the army.\nMeanwhile, the Dark Elf also prepared to return to the great hall to report to Leader Grom about taking troops out, but upon reaching the great hall, the surrounding hall guards informed him that the leader had already left, seemingly having received news from \"over there\" to head over.\nThe Dark Elf calculated in his mind that even with Leader Grom’s speed, it would take ten days to reach \"there\" from here. So he decided to lead the troop to eliminate the Young Dragon first.\nIn this primitive Beastman Tribe, mobilizing for a dragon hunt was not a quick affair. At least with the primal social structure of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, the initial preparations alone took quite some effort.\nBy the time the Dark Elf led a group of Beastmen away from the tribe heading south, it was already the next day.\n....\nMeanwhile, within the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"Rodney, during the last cold winter when the Jackal Wolf People attacked your tribe, weren’t there any signs?\"\nReturning from the Jackal Wolfman Tribe to the nest, Austin, wary of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe’s strength, ultimately decided not to act rashly and called Rodney over for inquiries while training the three major armies created under his command.\nIn the last cold winter, the small tribe Rodney established with Quik’s assistance was crushed by the Jackal Wolfman Tribe. They fled to the Dragon Nest Tribe and were defeated by the Kobolds during their attempt to break through the Dragon Nest Tribe, were captured, and eventually absorbed into the Dragon Nest Tribe’s system.\n\"No, we spent a cold winter there, and by the second cold winter, the Jackal Wolf People suddenly appeared and occupied the nearby hill. We thought we’d be fine, but suddenly the Jackal Wolf People attacked and defeated us.\"\nRodney didn’t have much regret about his small tribe being dismantled. Compared to his current life, being the leader of a micro tribe didn’t seem that great.\nBut he knew little about the Jackal Wolfman Tribe that defeated him and his people.\nUnder Austin’s persistent inquiries, it turned out that before creating his micro tribe, Rodney was a member of a Great Tribe, and after that tribe was destroyed by enemies, he snatched an axe amidst the chaos and escaped. He met the Fox-faced Man Quik while wandering in the forest, and together they established that micro tribe of twenty or thirty people, peacefully passing the first year.\nAustin showed some interest in Rodney’s original Great Tribe, but Rodney knew little. In fact, Beastmen tend to have simpler thinking and live day by day, rarely taking the initiative to understand their environment or other things.\nWhat intrigued Austin was discovering that some large tribes in the Kawa Great Forest had interaction, and Rodney had followed teams to trading places among those tribes, though he couldn’t clearly remember the routes.\nThis surprised Austin. It turned out Beastmen didn’t just live by survival of the fittest but also traded and interacted. Ironically, he had been sweeping nearby small tribes without saying a word.\nHe wondered if it was possible to establish communication with the Jackal Wolfman Tribe and obtain copper ore peacefully.\nOf course, it’s just a thought.\nIt’s not like he held a grudge over an arrow from the Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nAside from copper ore, the wealth of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe included something crucial: a Breathing Technique that could evolve ordinary Beastmen towards an Extraordinary path.\nThat’s what Austin desired most.\nIf he could acquire that Breathing Technique and spread it in the Dragon Nest Tribe, the power within the Dragon Nest Tribe would fundamentally change, and that was more important than copper ore.\nBecause of this, even if the Jackal Wolfman Tribe wanted to make peace with the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin would eventually lead a force to crush the entire Jackal Wolfman Tribe and seize that Breathing Technique for the sake of benefits.",

      "content": "Chapter 94: Chapter 92: Change of Mind?\n\"Ultimately, it’s just a lack of strength...\"\nFaced with the situation in front of him, Austin became even more aware of this point.\nIf he had the power of an adult dragon, no, even just that of a young dragon, what would a tiny Jackal Wolfman Tribe have to be afraid of?\nOr if his clan consisted of extraordinary professionals, their formidable strength would be enough to sweep away any vile creatures, then Austin probably could have breached the Jackal Wolfman Tribe that very day and begun large-scale refining of copper and iron industries.\n\"Strength, I need more materials infused with Magic Power!\"\nAustin could clearly feel it, the magic crystals he had previously consumed from the Ghost-headed Crocodile leader and the Blood Wolf leader had been completely digested, and his body was starting to feel a kind of hunger. If he could devour something containing a large amount of Magic Power, he might be able to grow again and unlock a third Talent Magic.\nAnd if he could grow once more, his body and scale armor would elevate again, then his strength could fully reach Silver Level.\nThis growth speed, compared to an average giant dragon, undoubtedly seemed quite astonishing, because young dragons of the same age might still be in their first slumber, not yet awakened. Perhaps it was because Austin often used electricity to stimulate his body growth that his size, bigger than that of the same age, concealed his actual age, thus in the future, it wouldn’t shock people too much.\nWhere could there be a large amount of Magic-infused materials?\nAustin suddenly thought of a place, the Spider Cave.\nBack then, Rodney and the hunting team mistakenly entered that Spider Cave, were bitten by the spider magical beasts inside, and when Austin led the team to find antidotes in the cave, he conveniently took away the magic stones buried in the soil that contained trace amounts of Magic Power.\nIt was precisely because of those magic stones that Austin used the authority of his giant dragon talent to transform Quik and nine beastmen, successfully turning them into extraordinary lives, greatly enhancing the power of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"Perhaps, it’s time to make a trip to the Spider Cave.\"\nCompared to that time, Austin was obviously much stronger now. Although he hadn’t acquired new Talent Magic, the gusting winds from his wings were enough to dispel those pervasive corrosive poisonous mists.\nFurthermore, with nine Dragon Vein Attendants and the fox-faced man Quik, who had two Magic Power items, this force should be sufficient to face the dangers inside that Spider Cave.\nAnd the magic stones containing Magic Power buried in that Spider Cave might help him advance further; at the very least, they could be used to transform a large number of Dragon Vein Beastmen with extraordinary life.\nThinking of this, Austin planned to put aside the Jackal Wolfman Tribe matter for a while, first cleanse the Spider Cave, and then strengthen himself and his Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"Go find Vini and draw fifty Minotaur Gun Shield Soldiers and two hundred spearmen from the three major corps, prepare to set off, and have Quik and the other Dragon Vein Attendants ready as well.\"\nResolute in his decision, Austin wasted no time, immediately giving orders to the Dragon Vein Attendant beside him.\n\"And also, bring all the collected pine oil with us.\"\nPine oil, also obtained from a plant Austin named \"pine\" in this world, was collected by cutting holes in the trunk of a pine tree with a stone axe, allowing the thick sap to slowly flow out, which was then collected in a container placed beneath the incision, becoming pine oil.\nThis sap from the pine tree, crystal clear and viscous, burned with a pine scent. When this yet-to-solidify pine oil was smeared on twisted bundles of straw and allowed to solidify, then lit up, the bundle of straw burned not only brighter but also longer.\nThe use of pine oil as fuel was naturally Austin’s idea, and even the method of extracting pine oil from pine trees was taught to the beastmen by Austin, as he had seen people extract pine oil from pine wood in his previous life.\nThe primary reason for extracting pine oil was for lighting.\nDuring the previous cold winter, due to the blood wolf pack’s night raid, Austin made certain changes, such as sending a small squad of beastman militia on rotation every night to guard against the sudden enemy attack.\nMoving around at night was inconvenient, with lighting being the simplest issue. Even though the vision of the beastmen was much better than that of ordinary humans, without firelight at night, it was difficult to see the enemy’s tracks.\nHowever, using burning wood as a light source, the fire would be extinguished by the wind when taken out of the campfire, making it unsuitable for the illuminating needs of night patrols.\nTo solve this issue, torches made from pine oil appeared in Austin’s mind.\nAustin remembered clearly the scene of exploring the Spider Cave for the first time; those spiders were creatures afraid of fire, so it was only natural not to forget to bring along the pyrotechnic pine oil.\n\"Yes, Your Highness.\"\nThe Dragon Vein Beastman respectfully answered, striding out quickly.\nShortly, the army Austin needed was drawn, gathered in the plaza, waiting for Austin to appear.\n\"This time, I want to completely clear out that Spider Cave. Quik, you set off with me. Vini, you and Rodney guard the tribe; yesterday, I went to scout the Jackal Wolfman Tribe in the north and got discovered by them. They may have been alerted, potentially causing trouble, so keep a closer eye and send more ratmen for reconnaissance.\"\nSpeaking of ratmen, Austin remembered sending a ratmen reconnaissance squad the previous day to explore the route to the northern Jackal Wolfman Tribe, and after a night’s time, they should have returned.\n\"By the way, have the ratmen reconnaissance squad sent out yesterday returned yet?\"\nBack then, Austin, using his aerial advantage, flew directly to the Jackal Wolfman Tribe for reconnaissance, while also sending the ratmen reconnaissance squad to explore a suitable campaign route on the ground.\nWith the aerial advantage, Austin returned that same day, while the ratmen were still exploring, as their speeds couldn’t be compared.\nSince he decided to set aside the attack on the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, it was natural not to waste too many resources on it.\n\"Your Highness, part of them has already returned.\"\n\"Alright, tell them not to rush, be sure to avoid the activities of giant beasts, and also avoid being discovered by the Jackal Wolfman Tribe. There’s no hurry.\"\nOriginally, Austin intended to call them back, but thinking about possibly launching the assault on the Jackal Wolfman Tribe right after clearing the Spider Cave, it made sense to make additional preparations and gather more intelligence on the enemy.\nJust as Austin was about to lead his troops to the Spider Cave to clear out those spider magical beasts, a ratman suddenly ran in hastily from outside the village, out of breath. Seeing Austin, his eyes lit up.\n\"Your Highness, Austin, Your Highness, there’s a beastman team coming towards our tribe from the Jackal Wolfman Tribe!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 95: Chapter 93 Ambush\nAmong the towering dense forest, the Dark Elf was leading a Beastman troop, slowly weaving through the massive trees. These Beastmen were generally robust, with a few particularly brawny bear people mixed in, larger than the other Jackal Wolf People.\nThese bear people held roles clearly akin to small leaders within the troop, even carrying iron weapons in their hands.\nIt’s quite remarkable, for Beastmen do not know how to forge iron. Iron weapons typically come from the Human World, obtained through invasion, plunder, or trade, making them extremely precious within the entire Kawa Great Forest. Yet, these bear people, as leaders of the Beastman troop, each wielded one.\nAnd these iron weapons matched their owners perfectly, being mostly crude, large, and black, including huge iron hammers and wolf fang clubs. With the bear people’s massive frames swinging them, the force might even crush a Minotaur with a single blow.\nThe status of bear people in the Beastman race is quite high, even higher than Centaurs, because it’s said that a trace of blood bearing Extraordinary Abilities flows within them. Even without activating and entering the Domain of Extraordinary Professionals, their strength outmatches ordinary Beastmen by a fair margin.\nNo wonder the bear people held positions higher than ordinary Beastmen, becoming small leaders within the Beastman troop.\nEven though there were only about three hundred Beastmen in such an elite group, it could undoubtedly hold its own against twice or even thrice that number of enemies.\n\"Hog, how far to the Dragon’s Nest?\"\nLooking at the undulating mountains ahead and the seemingly endless vast forest, the Dark Elf frowned slightly and asked Hog, the Jackal Wolfman leading the way beside him.\nFor some reason, upon entering this area, a faint sense of unease gripped the Dark Elf’s heart, as if something were about to happen, yet nothing did, as if it were just a figment of the imagination.\nIt must be overthinking, the Dark Elf thought to himself.\nAfter all, it’s just a young orphan dragon with only about a hundred Clan members. Perhaps stronger than an average Giant Beast, but under their powerful troop, it would at most hold on a bit longer.\n\"About half a day’s journey remaining, perhaps.\"\nHog glanced around and provided a somewhat uncertain answer.\nThe last time he was here was when Austin lit the signal smoke pillar to attract people; the skyward pillar of smoke was visible nearly ten miles around. Adding that it’s been more than half a year, it’s normal for Hog not to remember clearly.\n\"Then let’s take a break here midway.\"\nHaving traveled such a long distance, the Dark Elf felt hungry as well, intending to camp here for a rest. After the Beastmen finished eating, they would proceed.\nThe individual strength of these Beastmen was quite formidable, with physical qualities stronger than the Dragon Nest Tribe, but in terms of discipline, they fell far short.\nWith the Dark Elf’s announcement to camp, the previously loose ranks quickly turned into chaotic dispersal. Some sat down, others wandered; there were those eating jerky and drinking water. Additionally, some Beastmen lit fires, and about a dozen, led by a bear person leader, entered the forest, hoping to hunt fresh food or find edible fruits.\nThe Beastman troop, now dispersed into complete disarray, had no sense of security or awareness of defense, with only the Dark Elf occasionally eyeing the surrounding jungle for any signs of danger.\nThis wasn’t unusual since even during wars among large tribes in Kawa Great Forest, the combat was primal, resembling battles of primitive hordes, lacking tactics or command. Everyone just followed powerful leaders forward, either killing enemies or being killed.\nThe Dark Elf’s vigilance was merely due to concerns about potential Giant Beast assaults within the forest.\nAfter resting for about an hour, the scattered Beastmen had finished eating most of their provisions, and the campfires had been stoked several times.\n\"What’s going on? Why hasn’t that hunting party returned yet?\"\nThe Dark Elf furrowed his brow. While foraging for food during marching wasn’t forbidden—since the required food for a campaign couldn’t be fully carried—suiting up for hunting or gathering fruits during camp was necessary to supplement supplies.\nTake the Dark Elf’s group, for instance; they carried just two or three pieces of jerky, while the more impoverished brought only some tubers, enough for just one meal. Supplementing food while camping, then receiving more rations upon breaching that Blue Dragon’s lair, was naturally expected.\nThe Beastman troop’s outings during camping had practically become an unwritten rule; nonetheless, since they were on a march, the Beastmen hunting or foraging wouldn’t typically be delayed too long before regrouping.\nBut now, why haven’t they returned after so long?\n\"Milord, perhaps they encountered some formidable prey. Let’s wait a bit more,\"\nHog advised from the side.\nThe Dark Elf gave no definitive response. For some reason, a sudden irritability rose within him.\nHe rose to his feet, pacing the clearing, frowning occasionally at the outer sky and the green overgrown forest without a single gap.\nUpon the fifth loop around, a sudden chilling sense jolted his mind.\n\"Not good, there’s danger, quickly get up and prepare for battle!\"\nFinally, he understood what felt wrong.\nNo matter how perilous the forest, the occasional sound of insects and birdsong would emerge.\nBut now, everything was too silent!\nIt was deathly still, devoid of any sound, as if something terrifying lurked in the darkness, with its ominous threat causing even birds and insects to tremble in fear, refusing to utter a sound.\nThe Dark Elf abruptly grasped the longbow on his back, flipping and fastening it tightly in his hand, attentively scanning the surroundings.\nAt that moment, the scattered Beastman troop around the campfire looked bewildered. Many instinctively stood up, yet knew not what transpired.\nIt was at this moment that\nswish, swish, swish....\nAn unending whistle through the air resounded as arrows swiftly sliced the air from above, raining down upon the Beastmen in the clearing. Arrows fell like locusts, dense as a downpour, instantly enveloping the area where the Jackal Wolfman Tribe’s Beastmen stood.\nThis rain of arrows descended with such suddenness and speed that before the Beastmen of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe could react, the arrows pierced through the air, immediately penetrating their bodies, spilling crimson sprays of blood. Immediately, twenty to thirty were struck, crashing heavily to the ground, their fates unknown.\n\"Enemy attack! Quickly hide!\"\nOnly now did the Beastmen of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe scream in fright, scattering in panic like headless flies, rushing in all directions.",

      "content": "Chapter 96: Chapter 94: Defeat\nThe sudden downpour of arrows caught the Jackal Wolfman Tribe off guard, and under the deadly rain, the Beastmen panicked, scattering in all directions.\n\"Don’t panic, hide behind the trees!\"\nThe Dark Elf spun into the air, turning the longbow, deflecting an arrow that shot towards him, and swiftly darted like an agile rabbit behind a nearby large tree.\nAlthough the sudden attack shattered the morale of the Beastmen of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, there were many elite fighters among them. Perhaps accustomed to such wars, the death of their comrades did not cause them to lose their minds, and they quickly sought cover.\nHowever, just when the Beastmen were scattered everywhere, the rain of arrows suddenly ceased.\nSimultaneously,\n\"Charge! Attack!\"\nFrom within the jungle, a minotaur army numbering over a hundred suddenly charged out, each holding a long spear and wooden shield, forming a neat formation as they advanced.\nThe Jackal Wolfman Tribe, who had not been alert, finally paid the price for their negligence.\nAt that moment, the Beastmen of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, still shaken by the arrow attack, were standing scattered everywhere. Some had even dropped their wooden spears to the ground, and with the sudden charge of the Minotaur army, the Beastmen hadn’t had time to react before the Minotaurs were upon them.\nWere it any other tribe, first being demoralized by the arrow rain, then facing the torrent-like charge of the Minotaur army, they would have likely been in full collapse by now.\nBut the Jackal Wolfman Tribe was clearly not an ordinary tribe, and the Beastmen in this expedition were not ordinary either.\nSeveral fierce Grey Bear warriors immediately charged toward the Minotaur army, wielding metal weapons, with the seasoned veterans of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe following closely behind, forming groups and rushing to the front.\nWhoosh whoosh whoosh!\n\"Crush them under Lord Kam’s mighty hammer!\"\nA brawny Grey Bear warrior swung a colossal iron hammer with a whirring wind, accompanied by furious roars, the hammer, with the weight of a thousand pounds, crashed towards the charging Minotaur army.\nThud thud thud!\nThe iron hammer smashed into the wooden shields raised by the Minotaurs, a series of muffled thuds resounded, as the shields splintered, and those Minotaurs behind were sent reeling by the tremendous force, their arms broken, bodies almost launched into the air, causing a depression in the previously straight Minotaur battle line.\nJust one swing of the hammer severely injured multiple Minotaurs, rendering them combat ineffective. If not for the collective bearing of the shields, one or two Minotaurs might have been killed on the spot.\nYet, the Grey Bear warrior’s ferocity only extended so far. After swinging with full force, he fell into a state of exertion, with neither new strength nor agility left.\nSimultaneously, long spears pierced through the air, driving towards his massive body.\nThwack thwack thwack...\nThe sharp long spears penetrated thick fur and embedded into flesh, with crimson blood splattering forth, and searing pain surged like a tidal wave, overwhelming the Grey Bear warrior’s senses in a berserk frenzy.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nWith a furious roar, the Grey Bear warrior swept the heavy iron hammer wildly, splintering the spears stuck in his body in midair.\nWithout giving him time to retaliate further, more spears shot forth like venomous snakes, quickly penetrating his body, the array of long spears lifting his huge form into the air.\nThis skirmish lasted only moments, and the elite leader among the Beastmen was overwhelmed by the Minotaur charge, either injured or dead, while the rest had no chance to resist.\nThe thrusting spears were shielded away, and under the terrifying group assault, one Beastman after another was flung away, almost leading to a complete rout.\nSide by side with those on the front lines being scattered in combat, the rest, who hesitated to join, lost heart and fled into the forests.\nJackal Wolfman Tribe Beastmen were fleeing everywhere, while only a small number remained, resisting in futility against the Minotaur charge.\nThe abrupt arrow attack to the shield and spear corps breaking their lines took less than a minute, yet left the Dark Elves agonized by the chaos.\n\"Don’t run! Damn it! Get back to fighting the enemy!\"\nThe Dark General grabbed a retreating Beastman, tossing him back into the fray.\nYet intercepting only one or two made little difference, as continued attacks completely shattered morale across the Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nIn war, sustaining morale is crucial, as it was for Austin in ancient times, much like the Beastmen battles in this world’s primeval forests.\nIgnoring the Dark Elf’s commands, the Beastmen scattered in the chaos,\nAnd then,\n\"For His Highness Austin!\"\nLoud shouts echoed from left and right, as two new forces emerged from the underbrush, advancing upon the scattered Jackal Wolfman Tribe Beastmen.\n\"Damn it!\"\nSeeing their ranks split and enemies swarming in, the Dark Elf no longer intended to remain and fight, immediately turning to flee.\nAs for Simon Hogg and others trapped at the center, they were left to their fate.\nBut only after a few steps, a sudden magic burst rose below him.\n\"What?!!!\"\nThe Dark Elf was alarmed but responded swiftly, rolling to avoid the spot he stood upon.\nMeanwhile, massive black vines burst from the ground, intertwining at a rapid pace.\n\"Damn!\"\nThe fleeing Dark Elf cursed as he glimpsed the ensnaring vines, narrowly escaping capture.\nNext moment, as he darted up, leaping nimbly in mid-air, he deftly drew an arrow, targeting below.\nLocating the target, he drew, aimed, releasing in one fluid motion.\nMid-air he was, already aiming at the fox-faced Quik who had triggered the Vine Technique.\nAt that moment, Quik had just finished casting the vine spell from a magical ring, standing exposed. The drawn bow was zeroed in on him from above.",

      "content": "Chapter 97: Chapter 95: The Warrior Who Challenged the Giant Dragon\nA series of fluid actions transitioned seamlessly from the ground to the air, the sharp arrow on the string already emitting a faint magical glow, poised to kill the foolish fox-faced man in an instant.\nThe Dark Elf showed a sinister smile, never had prey escaped the lock of his sharp arrows.\nThe wind moved.\nHe liked the feeling when the wind moved, at that moment, following the current in the air, he seemed to have already seen the destiny of the fox-face man, shot through the head, as he prepared to release the fully drawn bowstring.\nThe next moment,\nSwish!!!\nSuddenly, the sky above the Dark Elf darkened, the daylight obscured, as an immensely vast shadow enveloped the sky, sweeping through with a massive gust, creating a rustling sound as it whisked past the leaves.\nWhat?!!!\nThe Dark Elf, startled, sharply turned his head to the sky, only to see an enormous claw descending from the sky, covering his view, accompanied by a powerful gale and an oppressive force rushing straight down towards him!\nWithin a fraction of a second, as his body still soared high, hands drawing the bowstring, before he could react, the massive claw swatted him away like swatting a fly, flinging him backward.\nCrash!\nThe Dark Elf felt as if a wall had slammed into him, a surging force flooded his body, sending him crashing to the ground like a cannonball, instantly shattering a huge tree, the impact creating a crater as the surrounding soil collapsed inward.\nAs the dust settled, the Dark Elf lay distorted in the crater, staring blankly at the sky, his limbs twitching involuntarily...\nWith disdain, Austin descended from the sky, the torrents stirred by his wings whipped up a whirlwind in the forest, the surrounding branches and leaves bowing in surrender in a single direction.\nThe terrifying dragon presence descended from the sky, sweeping through like tidal waves, as Minotaur and other Dragon Nest Beastmen cheered loudly, their eyes filled with fanaticism.\nMeanwhile, under the encirclement of the Dragon Nest Beastmen, the Jackal Wolfman Tribe Beastmen who were fiercely resisting suddenly paused their battle, staring blankly at the blue dragon in the sky.\n\"Insects, surrender, or die!\"\nA deep voice echoed through heaven and earth, carrying a visible pressure in the air that seemed to resonate in every corner of space, the immense voice rumbling like thunder in their ears, an unrivaled pressure engulfing the heart of every beastman.\n\"Long live His Highness Austin!\"\nThe Dragon Nest Beastmen, thoroughly brainwashed, became more fanatical, raising a thunderous cheer.\nIn contrast, the Jackal Wolfman Tribe Beastmen, already at their lowest point, had completely abandoned their wooden spears, trembling in terror on the ground.\nMeanwhile, amidst the Jackal Wolfman Tribe Beastmen who were resisting a moment ago, the Jackal Wolfman Leader Simon looked at his companions who had completely lost their fighting spirit, facing Austin.\nWith Austin’s appearance, as the Dark Elf was casually swatted away, there was no longer any resistance from the beastmen present,\nThey were now utterly surrounded by the Dragon Nest Tribe beastmen, their escaped companions mostly captured, leaving them with no escape at all.\nThe surroundings fell silent.\nSimon, pale-faced, took a deep breath, his burly body, with a contorted face gradually calming down, spoke slowly to Austin:\n\"Blue Dragon, it’s common for warriors from tribes to submit to stronger warriors, and I also know that facing you, I have no chance of winning.\"\nSimon, his beard bristling, veins bulging on his forehead, roared out with almost his last strength,\n\"But I, Simon of the Blood Claw Tribe... will never yield!\"\nAs the last word fell, the aura within Simon burst forth, his fur rising in the surging atmosphere, his resolute determination reaching its peak.\nWith unwavering momentum, Simon, veins bulging, leapt up, the giant axe tightly gripped in his hands glowing with a faint white brilliance, as if moonlight filled the sky, carrying an infinitely sharp essence that slashed towards Austin, tearing through space.\nThe momentum of his axe upward, like a fearless warrior waging against divine demons for freedom!\nAll the orcs present, even those of the Dragon Nest Tribe, were momentarily awed by the indomitable spirit of the Jackal Wolfman Leader Simon, hearts swelling with endless admiration.\nHowever, amidst hundreds of admiring gazes, when Simon’s battle-axe rose with the tearing air, carrying the spirit as if he could cleave anything in front into halves, rising into the sky,\nSuddenly, a blur flashed in the air.\nSnap!\nThe indistinct blur flitted through the air as inconspicuously as swatting a mosquito.\nThe next moment, Simon followed the Dark Elf’s fate, like a missile smashed at an angle, crashing through a tree and then slamming to the ground.\nAs the dust settled, Simon lay limp, sprawled in a sunken pit, limbs trembling,\ndejected beyond hope.\n\"Anyone else?\"\nArticulated slowly, the ancient and solemn voice sounded like thunder rattling in their brains.\nLooking at the massive shadow above, the sky’s sharp-edged, formidable dragon head, the terrifying dragon presence of the blue dragon sweeping over.\nThen at the once fierce now despondent Jackal Wolfman Leader Simon lying in despair.\nOn-site, silence pervaded.\n...\nA war initiated by the Jackal Wolfman Tribe’s \"invasion\" ended in their overwhelming defeat.\nInitially spotted by the Dragon Nest Tribe’s Ratman scouts, they blundered into Austin’s ambush, systematically struck by layered tactics and the Dragon Nest Beastmen’s army capabilities, easily overwhelming the Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nFurthermore, with the formation of a Centaur cavalry force, the fleeing Jackal Wolfman Tribe Beastmen during the war were not spared from the pursuit, all swept up and captured by the outer Centaur cavalry.\nReturning in great victory, Austin had no intention of relaxing.\nThe routed forces before him were likely just vanguard troops; the main base of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe still lay there, its hidden strength not to be underestimated. Before understanding the actual conditions of the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, Austin wouldn’t relax for a moment.\nConfined the captured beastmen in a POW camp, while higher-ranking leaders were brought out for interrogation.\nYet the intelligence Austin received next was rather grim.",

      "content": "Chapter 98: Chapter 96 Breathing Technique\n\"Silver-grade peak, nearly at a gold level, is it?\"\nIn the spacious City Hall, Austin’s massive figure sat cross-legged on the platform, his brows furrowed.\nHaving captured all the prisoners, naturally he had to interrogate them for information about their tribe. The ordinary beastmen only knew that their tribe was called the Blood Claw Tribe, a very large super tribe with countless strong companions within. The outpost to the north was established by the Blood Claw Tribe, dispersing some of its members there.\nFrom the mouth of that dark elf named Adinlek, Austin further learned that the tribe entrenched in the north, a branch of the Blood Claw Tribe, was temporarily managed by a Grizzly-man leader named Grom, whose strength had reached the silver-grade peak, approaching the gold level.\nThis disparity of one tier in strength meant that even Austin, when facing Grom, would probably have to flee in embarrassment.\nGiven the current level of the Dragon Nest Tribe, with a certain cost, they could defeat that Blood Claw branch. Even with a casualty rate of seventy to eighty percent to exhaust the strength of that Grizzly-man leader named Grom, perhaps Austin could still kill him.\nExtraordinary professionals are not invincible either,\nOrdinary bronze-level extraordinary professionals become exhausted dealing with a hundred or so peasants, silver ones last longer, able to handle a level of a thousand, but the Dragon Nest beastmen under Austin are not ordinary beastmen; not only do they have nine Dragon Vein Attendants, but also Quik, a pseudo-mage, and the cooperation among Dragon Nest beastmen in the entire Kawa Great Forest is top-notch.\nWith such strength, employing 1,400 beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe, without regard to life or death, to besiege that Grizzly-man leader, there is truly an eighty to ninety percent chance of exhausting his strength, allowing Austin to come forward at the end to snatch his life.\nBut this cost is too great!\nSuch a price-blind siege would result in at least ninety percent casualties of the Dragon Nest beastmen. Even if Austin went first to pin down, with the Dragon Nest beastmen as the main force in the siege, the losses would definitely not be insignificant.\nThe beastmen painstakingly accumulated would be consumed in this kind of battle, which is definitely not what Austin wants.\nMoreover, if just the leader of a Blood Claw Tribe branch has peak silver strength, then what kind of behemoth is the actual Blood Claw Tribe?\n\"Forget it, if worse comes to worst, I’ll just move. At that time, I’ll take the clan to hide in some deep mountains or forests, with such a vast Kawa Great Forest, what can the so-called Blood Claw Tribe do to me?\"\nAustin pondered secretly,\nOf course, he was just thinking.\nNow the Dragon Nest Tribe has more than 1,400 people, having cleared nearly 400 acres of land. How could the established foundation nearby be easily abandoned? Once they move, much would have to start over.\nPrecisely because of this, unless absolutely necessary, Austin would never easily take the clan to flee in disgrace.\n\"Dark elf, according to you, if the Blood Claw Tribe is so far from here, why extend their tentacles here?\"\nFacing the dark elf, hands and feet bound and half-kneeling, Austin’s deep voice echoed in the hall.\n\"I do not know about this matter, we act on orders, the real purpose perhaps only the Grizzly-man leader Grom knows a bit.\"\n\"So the person in charge is a Grizzly-man leader named Grom? Where is he now?\"\n\"Before dispatching troops, the guard informed me that Lord Grom received news from headquarters and went back once, even at the fastest, it’ll take more than ten days to return.\"\nIn answering Austin’s questions, the dark elf revealed everything he knew, which piqued Austin’s curiosity.\nThrough further inquiry, he learned that the dark elf came from a certain underworld, subscribing to the law of the jungle. Surrendering to a stronger enemy wasn’t surprising.\nThe dark elf’s presence in the Blood Claw Tribe was because he’d been captured in a skirmish and had to serve a new master.\nThis time, Austin defeated him, and the dark elf didn’t reject serving Austin.\nWhether out of fear or cowardice, the dark elf’s attitude saved Austin a lot of trouble.\n\"Dark elf, do you know any breathing techniques?\"\nFrom the high platform, Austin asked the final question in a deep voice.\n\"Breathing technique?\"\nThe dark elf was momentarily surprised, but quickly realizing Austin’s intent, he didn’t hide anything and continued:\n\"Mighty His Highness Blue Dragon, I indeed know a breathing technique that can lead beastmen to an extraordinary path, but it belongs to the dark races’ techniques and will inevitably taint with a dark aura upon use.\"\n\"What happens if it taints with a dark aura?\"\nUpon hearing this, the excitement that bubbled in Austin swiftly quelled, as the breathing technique was naturally intended for the clan below, but the term dark aura didn’t evoke good thoughts.\n\"Uh, noble His Highness Blue Dragon, it’s not a huge issue. After tainting with a dark aura, they become more perceptive at night but also slightly suppressed during the day. Moreover, those beastmen utilizing this breathing technique will automatically transform into dark creatures upon reaching the legendary stage.\"\nFortunately, it wasn’t a significant issue, at least in emergencies, Austin didn’t mind this trivial matter.\nAt this moment, the dark elf added:\n\"Moreover, the breathing technique I possess is quite basic, with efficiency even lower than an ordinary technique.\"\n\"It doesn’t matter, I’ll assign five Dragon Vein Attendants to your command later. You understand what I mean, don’t you, dark elf?\"\nIf the only trouble is bonus effects in darkness and attribute suppression during daytime, it indeed isn’t a big deal.\nAt least, with this, Dragon Vein Attendants embarking on the extraordinary path would gain advantages in night battles or dark environments.\nNevertheless, even so, Austin wouldn’t place all his bets on this.\n\"Willing to serve you, mighty His Highness Blue Dragon.\"\nThe dark elf half-kneeled on the ground, placing a hand on his chest to show allegiance.\nThis dark elf named Adinlek evidently had a deeper story; otherwise, why would a creature from the underworld end up in the surface world, serving a beastman tribe?\nBut regarding all this, Austin refrained from further questions, as long as he submitted and shared the breathing technique, that was sufficient; everything else could wait.\nYet, accomplishing anything with breathing techniques couldn’t occur in a short time, which is why Austin required other methods to enhance himself.\n\"Still more than ten days... I have no choice but to pay a visit to the Spider Cave.\"\nInwardly, Austin mumbled to himself.",

      "content": "Chapter 99: Chapter 97 Magic Crystal\nNext day, inside the Spider Cave.\nWhhoooosh!!!\nFierce flames swept through the cavern, mixed with a terrifying storm gale. The fire aided the wind’s power, and the wind boosted the fire’s strength, sweeping mightily through the air.\nIn the darkness, the spiders that originally surged like tides were caught in the massive flame storm, immediately curling up and losing the breath of life, as the flame storm swept through, a smell of roasted meat filled the air.\nAfter a while, the intense flames finally subsided.\nAt this time, a shadow two to three meters tall, along with many figures, slowly appeared at the cave entrance.\n\"They should all be dead, shouldn’t they...\"\nAustin slowly retracted his wings, folding the membrane wings onto his back, gazing at the scorched and smoky scene before him, secretly pondering in his heart.\nAustin didn’t know flame talent magic, nor could Quik’s red crystal demonic artifact produce flames sweeping through every corner of the cave like a storm; the spectacular earlier scene was only the result of the vast amounts of pine oil, dry wood kindling, and the turbulent storm gale created by Austin’s wings.\nThough the method seemed a bit crude, the effect was indeed excellent.\nAt least upon entering this spider cave, those small spiders resembling a black tide had already lost signs of life; maybe there were survivors deeper inside, but if they dared to come over, a fire would suffice once more.\n\"Begin digging.\"\nAt Austin’s command, the beastmen behind him started bustling around, wielding stone shovels and stone axes, banging on the ground and walls. Whenever they knocked out a pebble-sized stone emanating a bluish glow, they carefully collected and placed it into baskets.\nWithout the spiders’ harassment, the beastmen could freely dig these glowing stones.\n\"Your Highness, this is your target for coming here, I never thought there really was a Magic Stone Vein here.\"\nFollowing Austin, the dark elf who accompanied him gazed at the glowing stones being collected by the beastmen, eyes shimmering – like watching money.\nHe even couldn’t help but squat down and put his hand on them, stroking them.\nAlthough the dark elf was recently subjugated, there were indeed few extraordinary ability users under Austin’s command, and his advantage in the dark cave became even greater, hence he was brought along.\n\"Oh, Adinlek, have you seen this kind of thing before?\"\nThough the Magic Stone was quite useful, enabling Austin to transform the beastmen’s biological bloodlines, he really wasn’t clear about these stones’ intrinsic nature.\nIn the inherited memories, there existed something called Magic Crystal, containing a high purity of magic power crystal, extremely rare worldwide, also precious collectibles of giant dragons.\nMagic Crystal and Magic Beast Crystal Core were different; the former was produced naturally in certain veins, while the latter crystallized inside powerful magic beasts.\nMoreover, the magic power within Magic Crystals was far larger and purer than what was in Magic Beast Crystal Cores.\nYet, compared to the inherited memories’ Magic Crystals, these magic stones were too far-reaching from those translucent, shimmering gems.\n\"Sub-Magic Stone, a derivative vein of Magic Crystal Mine; your Highness, there must be Magic Crystals deep within the cave!\"\nThe dark elf spoke with utmost certainty:\n\"Your Highness, you wish to advance your realm by consuming substantial amounts of sub-magic stones, correct? However, for your current state, sub-magic stones are of no use, as the magic within is too little compared to the vast magic power within you – merely the size of a hair strand. Only true Magic Crystals could possibly shatter that wall of strength.\"\nAustin’s eyes flickered momentarily; indeed, he felt the same after beastmen experiments.\nCompared to the dragon’s body’s magic power, the amount of magic in a sub-magic stone was less than a fingernail’s size.\nSub-magic stones could trigger the beastmen’s extraordinary evolution path mostly due to that little bit of magic acting as an initiator, activating the dragon radiation transformation authority; therein lay not much magic power, and Austin was crystal clear about it.\n\"Alright then, the magic power in sub-magic stones is indeed too little.\"\nAustin silently contemplated; although there might be dangers deeper within the cave, the problems ought to be minor.\nWith a team organized from the beastmen, instructing others to continue digging sub-magic stones, Austin led the beastman squad along with Quik Dark Elf and several dragon vein attendants into deeper cave exploration.\nEven if, as the dark elf declared, these sub-magic stones weren’t quite useful for him, they could ignite the beastmen’s potential, and through Austin’s dragon radiation transformation, transform the beastmen into extraordinary life, thus the more, the better. Even if Austin himself didn’t use them, he could provide them to the clan beastmen; hence Austin parted with the majority of the beastmen to mine sub-magic stones in the cave’s passageway.\nAs for himself, he led the elite deeper into exploration; anyway the ordinary beastmen would likely just suffer needless casualties facing more formidable magical beasts.\nWith the progression of the team, firelight flickered on the walls, rugged and uneven, light and shadows crossed, and it seemed the spiders were frightened by that large fire and didn’t come out again.\nOne dragon and the group slowly pressed forward, and the deeper they delved, the cave’s shape became ever more bizarre, while Austin felt the surrounding rock layers contained more sub-magic stones increasingly.\n\"Adinlek, have you seen a cave produced with Magic Crystal veins?\"\nBeing able to instantly identify sub-magic stones and ascertain Magic Crystals were deeper in the cave, the dark elf ought to have seen something similar before.\n\"Indeed, Your Highness, long ago in the Underworld, I once made a livelihood under an underground lord, and he happened to possess a Magic Crystal Vein.\"\n\"Oh, the Underworld...then your vein also had magical beasts inhabiting it?\"\n\"That’s correct, Your Highness; wild Magic Crystal veins typically have innate powerful magical beast guardians, but once cleared away, there’s nothing much to worry about. Since this cave houses spiders, then the deepest entity should be akin to a Spider Empress or such spider magical beast.\"\nAustin nodded slightly, without speaking.\nYet if truly arriving at the cave’s end, then the confrontation might involve not just the Spider Empress, but also those large spiders from before and numerous small spiders driven into the depths by the flames.\nSoon enough, the space ahead suddenly brightened, becoming more spacious.\n\"Everyone, be careful.\"\nFeeling the faint unease in the air, Austin’s steady voice echoed in the space.",

      "content": "Chapter 100: Chapter 98: Spider Leader\nAs the view in front expanded, the dark blue light illuminated the entire space, revealing translucent crystals scattered at the end of the huge cavern, emitting this dark blue light, like crystallized air or enlarged snowflakes.\nHowever, at this moment, the group of Beastmen had no intention to pay attention to these magical crystal ice formations, because as they entered the space, they saw huge shadows flickering between the magic crystals.\nHiss, hiss!\nAs soon as everyone appeared, they heard hisses from the darkness. Giant spiders leapt out from all corners, agilely extending their massive poisonous claws toward the group.\nThe enormous figures, each as tall as a Beastman, had fangs flashing with ominous light under the glowing illumination, sending gusts of dizzying, nauseating wind.\n\"Kill!\"\nSeveral guarding Beastmen immediately responded, forming a circle with them, brandishing their sharp long spears to pierce the darkness with precision.\nSeveral large spiders collided directly with the sharp spearheads, getting pierced instantly, with their foul-smelling green blood splattering out. However, more large spiders followed closely behind, seemingly aiming to shred the group to pieces.\nBam bam bam!\nIn a critical moment, the Dragon Vein Attendants took action, swinging their stone shields loudly like walls, smashing several large spiders flat and sending them flying.\nThe Dragon Vein Attendants participating in this action had learned the Dark Elf Breathing Technique. Though the duration was short, they showed improved strength, wielding their heavy stone shields with ease.\nForming the core, the Dragon Vein Attendants blocked the front, while the Dragon’s Nest Beastmen attacked from behind, stabbing with long spears, forming an impenetrable defense line against the onrushing large spiders.\nOne by one, the large spiders leapt from the shadows, only to hit the sharp defensive line and suffer a head-smashing defeat.\nConcurrently, the Dark Elves also drew their bows, firing arrows swiftly. The arrowheads gleamed faintly, coated with a thin layer of Fighting Qi, cutting through like sharp swords. An arrow pierced one large spider, continued its momentum, piercing the two spiders behind it before finally embedding in the rock layer.\nAt the same time, the Fox-faced Man Quik also raised his scepter, attempting to cast a Flame Burst Technique.\nBut Austin stopped him. Though Quik’s demonic artifacts could automatically recover Magic Power, it took time, and for now the Beastmen could hold their ground, saving the spells for strategic moments.\nWith the Beastmen forming a killing formation, along with the Dark Elves stealthily shooting from the side, the large spider swarm suffered heavy losses, their corpses piling up like a mountain.\n\"Could it really be just a group of mutated spiders occupying here without a ruling Lord?\"\nSeeing this scene, Austin felt a surge of doubt in his heart.\nThe attacking large spiders, though aggressive, were swiftly killed by the combined forces of the Dragon Vein Beastmen and ordinary Beastmen.\nMoreover, so far, there was no sign of any superior Magic Beast appearing beyond the spiders.\n\"Could it really be that I’m overthinking?\"\nSeeing this scene, Austin felt a sense of suspicion rising within him.\nJust as the spiders’ assault seemed to wane, looking like only a few remained.\nSuddenly, an abrupt change occurred.\nThe remaining few large spiders emitted a green glow, their chest and abdomen inflating like balloons, and under tremendous jumping power, they leapt towards the Beastmen.\nWatch out!\nAustin felt a sudden rush of unease.\n\"Retreat quickly!\"\nHowever, before he finished speaking, those mutated spiders were already close, the Beastmen’s long spears were thrust out.\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\nThe long spears thrust out, but didn’t pierce the spiders as before. As the spears touched the mutated spiders, they exploded, releasing a terrifying forceful shockwave.\nThe Beastmen in front were immediately blown away by the impact, only a few Dragon Vein Beastmen barely maintained their stance.\nYet, the worst was the poisonous green liquid erupting, splashing onto the Beastmen’s skin. Immediately, cries of pain echoed as they rolled on the ground, moaning loudly.\nThe Dragon Vein Beastmen fared better, at least having stone shields to block, but the liquid still seeped into their skin, causing a large swollen bruise.\nOrdinary Beastmen fared worse; where the poison touched, blue veins spread like a spider web, burning like magma. Some hit directly by the green poison had their whole bodies turn blue-purple, gradually stiffening, seemingly dying.\n\"Damn it!\"\nAustin was furious but had no time to spare.\nBecause at this moment, a huge shadow descended from above, hanging by a silk thread and crashing to the ground, stirring a cloud of dust.\nThe massive shadow, even bigger than Austin’s body, stood three meters tall, with limbs resembling the claws of a Demon God, menacing and terrifying.\n\"Hiss!!!\"\nA hiss that more resembled a mighty roar.\nThe entire cave roared with tidal waves, sending visible shockwaves rolling through.\nThe severely injured Beastman Clan gathered together despite their pain, clutching their wooden spears tightly.\n\"Fall back, leave the rest to me.\"\nAustin stepped forward, shoving the Beastmen behind him, focusing his gaze on the towering creature.\nIt was an even larger spider, its armor glistening with a dark hue, on its shell, a face as fierce as a demon was etched, vivid and fierce, spreading its massive venomous fangs, roaring continuously at Austin.\n\"Dragon Vein Attendants, take everyone back, Adinlek, and Quik, be ready to support me.\"\nEven just standing opposite it, a fierce aura hit Austin, realizing this Spider Leader’s power reached at least Silver level, with potentially toxic Talent Magic, making all actions risky for the Dragon Vein Attendants.\nHowever, Silver or not, death is certain!\nRoar!!!\nA loud dragon roar, Austin unfurled his wings, electric snakes danced wildly in the sky, his massive body lunging at the shadow before him.",

      "content": "Chapter 101: Chapter 99: Kill\nBoom!!!\nThe two Giant Beasts clashed inside the cave. Even though the space inside was vast, with ceilings reaching dozens of meters high, the entire cavern felt as if it were experiencing an earthquake.\nIt was a melee between Giant Beast and Giant Beast, with dust rising to the sky with every collision, causing the ground to tremble violently. Large chunks of rock fell from above, seemingly about to collapse.\nAustin’s fierce teeth sank into the leg of the Spider Leader, with electric arcs sparking wildly all over his body, extending to the Spider Leader, causing it to convulse and paralyze.\nThe Spider Leader screamed in pain and fury, emitting a green mist, while its tail spewed white webs that entangled Austin’s huge body like steel cables.\nThe green poison mist was so toxic that it even corroded the rocks on the ground. Meanwhile, the white webs were not only strong but also sticky, gradually putting Austin in a predicament.\nThe two Giant Beasts entangled together, rolling on the ground continuously, shattering rocks wherever they went, the earth trembling, and spider-web-like cracks spreading widely.\nAt the same time, blue electric light and green poison mist, two types of Extraordinary Energy, began to gather in their respective bodies’ spaces, colliding and merging.\nThe several-meter tall figures tangled in combat, with ordinary Beastmen and Dragon Vein Attendants unable to assist, having to constantly retreat.\nThe Dark Elf drew the bow and shot swiftly, but even with arrows imbued with Fighting Qi, they could only penetrate half an inch into the Spider Leader’s shell, driving it mad but causing little actual damage.\n\"Quik, use Flame Burst Technique quickly!\"\nThe Dark Elf saw the Spider Leader’s webs continuously shoot out, almost wrapping Austin entirely, and quickly shouted to the Fox-faced Man Quik beside him.\n\"Okay!\"\nWith this shout from the Dark Elf, Quik understood his intention: use flames to burn those obstructive webs.\nSeeing Austin entangled by the webs, Quik immediately raised the Red Crystal Staff.\nVisible red light gathered under the staff’s absorption, forming circles of visible halos in the air, with intense Fire Attribute Magic Power accumulating, generating terrifying heat.\nHoo, Hoo, Hoo!\nA huge fireball suddenly conjured, the air faintly twisting with it, with terrifying heat blasting toward the two Giant Beasts fighting fiercely.\nBut compared to its peak power, Quik deliberately adjusted the power of the Flame Burst Technique lower, and at this power level, with Austin’s inherent Magic Resistance, he should be fine.\nBoom!\nThe enormous fireball streaked out, crashing onto Austin, who was battling the Spider Leader, instantly causing a fierce explosion, flames sweeping outward, and the webs ignited in a roaring blaze.\n\"Hiss!!!\"\nPerhaps due to natural suppression, the fire greatly harmed the Spider Leader. It cried harshly and retreated a bit, the poison sacs within its body spraying a large amount of poison mist, trying to extinguish the flames.\n\"Quik, well done, prepare to use Vine Technique!\"\nAs it sprayed poison mist, the Spider Leader released Austin, and the intense flames burned off the webs on Austin’s body. Seizing this opportunity, he flapped his wings, broke free from the entanglement, and soared up.\nQuik’s Flame Burst Technique didn’t heavily damage Austin with his inherent Dragon Race strong Magic Resistance, and the flames burned off the sticky white webs on him, freeing him from restraint.\nWhile the space here was not small, inside, movement was ultimately inconvenient, so Austin didn’t initially consider flying to suppress, instead diving into melee, unintentionally getting entangled with the Spider Leader, almost being enveloped by webs.\nWith a tremble, Austin naturally moved away.\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\nWith too much force, Austin’s entire body collided with the ceiling rocks, his iron wings flapping, breaking apart the rocks like tofu, making rubble crumble.\nAt this moment, hearing Austin’s command, Quik once again raised the ring at hand, aiming at the Spider Leader ahead.\nBuzz!!!\nVisible waves emanated from the ring’s vibration, spreading in the surrounding space, with intangible magic gathering and shifting.\nSuddenly, below the Spider Leader still spraying poison mist, unexpectedly black tree root-sized vines burst from the ground like lively venomous snakes entwining, tightly binding the Spider Leader.\n\"Hiss!!!\"\nSuddenly bound, the Spider Leader sensed something amiss, cried out sharply, its piercing sound creating visible sound waves, causing Quik to stagger, almost falling backward, and threatening to unravel the vine Technique maintained through the ring.\nJust at this critical moment,\nWhoosh!\nA point of cold light suddenly swept through the air like lightning, cutting through the void, piercing into the mouth of the Spider Leader, directly interrupting its cries. The arrow shaft along with the Spider Leader’s mouth penetrated deeply into its body, green liquid spraying out.\nMeanwhile, within the entire space, a vast power of Magic Power began to sweep.\nOnly to see Austin above spreading his wings, electric snakes dancing wildly in the air, with magic guiding, an extremely powerful force brewed in the air.\nThe Spider Leader sensed danger, struggling continuously, breaking vines in its mad struggle, on the verge of breaking free.\nBut just at this moment, Austin’s Talent Magic was finally ready.\nThunder Strike Technique!\nBoom!!!\nIn the earth-shattering sound, it was as if thunder cracked on a clear day, a lightning bolt as thick as a barrel shattered the air, descending from the sky, striking the Spider Leader.\nThousands of volts of electricity discharged instantly, producing large amounts of light and heat, bringing tremendous destructive power, countless electric snakes splitting and dancing wildly, sweeping the void, electric arcs penetrating the rock, pieces of debris exploding and soaring.\nIn this intense electric light, both Quik and the Dark Elf couldn’t help but retreat.\nWithin moments, as the electric light dispersed, smoke billowed around, and as the smoke slowly cleared, the charred body of the Spider Leader gradually emitted smoke, dissipating into the air, exuding an aromatic scent.\nClatter!\nAustin retracted his wings, landing from high above, tearing the Spider Leader’s skull open with two giant claws.\nSadly though, this Spider Leader hadn’t formed a Magic Beast Crystal Core within.\n\"Such a pity...\"\nAustin sighed gently, but soon tossed aside that little regret.\nBecause the more important harvest was already within reach, namely the abundant Natural Magic Crystal filling the cavern!",

      "content": "Chapter 102: Chapter 100: The 3rd Talent Magic\nAlthough Austin couldn’t find a Magic Beast Crystal Core on the body of the Spider Leader, it doesn’t mean that the body is useless. As a powerful Magic Beast of Silver Level, its shell is as hard as copper and iron. Even if a regular Beastman used a wooden spear with all their might here, it wouldn’t do any harm. That’s why Austin asked the Beastmen to step back.\nIf this Spider Leader’s body were made into Shield Armor and its sharp limbs and tail tip attached to a wooden spear, the equipment produced would be no less than equipment made of copper and iron—perhaps even superior.\nThese materials from Magic Beasts are specifically acquired for making weapons in the Human World. However, Austin doesn’t possess similar knowledge, so he can only make use of its durability attributes. If he could meet a Professional like an Enchanter, these materials could already be used to create Extraordinary Weapons.\nAfter defeating the Spider Leader, there is no longer any danger within the cave. The magic stones acquired here can continuously enhance the Clan Beastmen, upgrading them to the Extraordinary species. This is very significant for the entire Dragon Nest Tribe.\nUpon discovering the cave’s value, Austin’s determination not to relocate increased further.\n\"However, speaking of which, after the Dragon Vein Transformation, the Dragon Vein Attendants’ appetite has greatly increased. Each individual basically consumes over ten pounds of meat daily. Major transformations for the Beastmen can’t be done just yet; otherwise, we can’t supply the food. It seems we can only first transform a guard squad of thirty people.\"\nAlthough cleaning the Spider Cave provides enough Sub-Magic Stones to transform the entire Tribe population, greatly enhancing the Dragon Nest Division’s strength.\nSuch transformations would exhaust the Tribe’s resources to support so many Extraordinary Beastmen, especially since Austin’s plan for the Dragon Nest Tribe’s future emphasizes an elite policy, rather than everyone becoming like dragons.\nFocusing on a large base of Beastmen, promoting the Breathing Technique, selecting the excellent ones for Dragon Vein Transformation, and channeling a certain amount of resources to the elites is key for further strengthening, ensuring the Dragon Nest Tribe doesn’t become a burden.\n\"Let’s deal with these matters later.\"\nAfter killing the Spider Leader, many thoughts arose in Austin’s mind, but he quickly set them aside.\n\"Take good care of the injured, hurry and find antidote plants for the poisoned, arrange for the deceased, and tidy up here.\"\nAfter providing post-battle instructions to the subordinate Beastmen, Austin turned his focus back to the Magic Crystals in front of him, as clean as ice shards on the rock layers.\n\"A very powerful Magic Power. With these, I can absolutely advance further before Grom returns!\"\n...\nSeveral days later, the sky was gloomy, covered with dark clouds. Lightning flashed and thunder roared as rain fell heavily.\nA sudden downpour came quickly. Beastmen working on opening and planting fields in the grassland barely had time to run back to their villages and had to shelter from the rain under large trees.\nMeanwhile, atop a mountain peak, Austin stood on the summit amidst howling winds and torrential rain, arcs of lightning tore the dim sky, piercing through the gloom.\nAustin’s whole body appeared to endure an unimaginable, intense pain, as his eyes shot out red light. Arcs of lightning flashed from his mouth and nose, and dark red steam like molten lava.\n\"Roar!!\"\nSuddenly, Austin spread his wings and roared skyward.\nInstantly, thunderbolts seemed to descend from the heavens, creating a rumbling sound that echoed miles away, striking Austin with terrifying power.\nHowever, the thunderbolts containing immense power became tame like obedient sheep when they fell within Austin’s surrounding area. Arcs of lightning circled around Austin, the terrible power piercing the air, splitting the rock layers underneath inch by inch, causing stones to rise as if losing gravity, before finally being shattered by the rampaging electricity in the air.\nAmidst blinding electric light, Austin slowly opened his eyes. The vast and boundless dragon’s aura swept out, and intangible pressure spread like waves, expanding in every direction.\n\"Electric current control...?\"\nLooking at the circles of electric light surrounding him, crackling sounds emanating, with thunderbolts flickering like tame sheep, stabbing and jumping around him, Austin pondered in thought.\nFeeling the thunderbolts respond to his will as if moving his limbs, Austin’s expression changed, revealing a fierce grin.\nCrackle!\nLightning tore through the air as thunder gathered together before his fierce maw, converging into a shapeshifting Thunderous Paste Ball suspended inside, consolidating terrible power.\nIn the next moment,\nWhoosh!!!\nA pillar of blue lightning shot out from Austin’s mouth, slicing through space, sweeping past the area in front.\nThe forest in the distance seemed to be cut by a smooth mirror, burning a void into the tree trunks, leaving the upper sections suspended in the air, as if the lightning laser was so fast that the trees didn’t realize they had been cut in half, falling to the ground the next moment with a rumbling sound.\nThe forest ahead was entirely cut through!\n\"Nice!\"\nIt had been seven days since the Spider Cave clearing operation. During this time, Austin had consumed a large amount of natural Magic Crystals, replenishing his magic power to a level that he couldn’t immediately process, requiring pauses before consuming more Magic Crystals to increase his strength.\nUsing these abundant magic materials, Austin’s strength significantly increased. Not only had he grown larger, but his scales and claws were also tougher and sharper, and Austin had successfully unlocked a third Talent Magic.\nElectric current control, or more aptly termed Thunder Control.\nThis Talent Magic is similar to the first Talent Magic according to gaming terminology, both falling into the category of passive skills.\nWith this Talent Magic unlocked, Austin could control electric currents at will, even directing the formidable thunderbolts of the world to produce powerful and terrifying forces.\nThe thunderbolt beam Austin expelled earlier was born from extremely condensed Thunder Liquid, forming into a line before discharging as a terribly powerful lightning beam.\nMastering this Talent Magic, Austin could essentially become a controlling force over the thunder above the nine heavens.\nOf course, the extent of control is limited; the magnitude of magic within the body determines the scope over which thunder can be wielded.\nThe thunderbolt beam used earlier almost drained the majority of Austin’s internal magic.\nBut even so, this magnitude significantly enhances Austin’s current power.",

      "content": "Chapter 103: Chapter 101 Dark Dragon Guard\nAfter clearing out the Spider Cave, in the foreseeable future, Austin no longer needs to worry about the magic power resources needed for his own growth. Once this batch of Magic Crystals is fully absorbed, Austin will be able to consume more Magic Crystals to continue his evolution and growth.\nWith the Sub-Magic Stones derived from the Magic Crystal Vein, Austin can significantly increase the number of Dragon Vein Beastmen. Of course, before transformation, they need a certain level of training and selection to maximize the potential of the transformation.\nAfter Austin successfully activated his third Talent Magic, the return of Grom, the leader of the Blood Claw Tribe Branch and a nearly Gold Level Bear Man, was imminent. Austin planned to conquer the Blood Claw Tribe’s branch before his return and then ambush Grom with superior forces to completely annihilate him.\nIf everything goes smoothly, then it will be the cold winter season.\nWith the three-month freezing period of the cold winter season, and considering the branch tribe is several hundred miles away from the true headquarters, it would take at least half a year for the powerful Blood Claw Tribe to figure out what happened here. Even if they seek vengeance, it would take at least half a year, and given the action efficiency of the Beastman Tribe, a delay of one or two years wouldn’t be surprising.\nWith more than half a year’s time to develop, considering the growth level of the Dragon Nest Tribe, combined with the Dark Elf’s Breathing Technique and a large number of Natural Magic Crystals, both Austin and the Dragon Vein Beastmen will reach an incredibly powerful level.\nAccording to the Dark Elf, the large tribe named Blood Claw Tribe has a population of only tens of thousands, and the Blood Claw Race Leader is about Gold Level. Moreover, the distance between them is not very close, so there’s a chance they can contend when the time comes.\nAlthough it’s unclear why the Blood Claw Tribe chose to branch out to such a distant place to establish a tribe, if everything goes well, Austin wouldn’t fear even if the Blood Claw Race Leader came personally.\nOf course, all of this is predicated on Austin first slaying the Bear Man Grom.\nWith the plan set, Austin flew back to the Dragon’s Nest to carry out the modification plans for the elite Beastmen.\nThe Breathing Technique provided by the Dark Elf has already been widely promoted among the three major legions. Time is always set aside for daily training, although its effectiveness hasn’t become visible yet, it has shown some benefits, at least the Beastman soldiers have gained a bit more strength.\nUnfortunately, this Breathing Technique comes from the Dark Race, and its usage inevitably bears dark aura, which affects the Beastmen who enter the realm of Extraordinary through it. While they gain night-time advantages, they also acquire certain disadvantages.\nHowever, as of now, this is the only Breathing Technique available, so Austin has no choice.\nAfter cultivating the Breathing Technique, the transformed Beastmen are noticeably stronger than the first batch of Dragon Vein Attendants. The trace of dark aura absorbed into their bodies has also morphed through Austin’s modifications, turning their skin black and shrouding them in wisps of black mist; their black muscles appeared as hard as steel, making them appear like an army forged from steel from afar.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nOn the plaza, a transformed Beastman with black mist surrounding him, as if burned with black fire, roared, sending airwaves sweeping in all directions like tides.\nIn the next moment, as he stomped on the ground, the Earth cracked open like a mirror, cobweb-like fractures spreading rapidly. Cut by the strong recoil, the transformed Beastman shot out like a black lightning bolt.\nThe black mist gathered on his fist, turning his entire arm ink-black, as if carrying massive force, punched at the giant rock in front.\nBang!\nWith a loud crash, the person-high boulder shattered instantly, sending rock shards scattering like bullets, smoke and dust enveloping the sky.\nWhoa!\nThe surrounding onlookers, all Beastmen, shouted in shock, displaying emotions of great surprise.\nThough a Beastman’s physique is much stronger than a human’s, it’s merely several degrees stronger. A regular Beastman’s body is still considered mortal, unable to smash rocks or crush the ground.\nYet, transformed ordinary comrades gained such tremendous power all at once; how could the surrounding normal Beastmen not be surprised?\n\"It’s not just because of the Breathing Technique, but because I’ve become stronger...\"\nFrom atop the high platform, Austin overlooked everything, silently speaking to himself.\nAfter activating the third Talent Magic, Austin began to focus on modifying the selected elite Beastmen. During the modification process, he distinctly felt the bond between his bloodline and the clan becoming more intimate, even being able to vaguely feel the blood flow inside the transformed Beastmen.\nWhen the magic power from the Sub-Magic Stones flowed into the transformed Beastmen, strands of magic power coursed through their blood vessels, not only unlocking the potential of their flesh and blood cells but also incorporating the trace of dark fighting qi refined through using the Breathing Technique within these few days. With the influence of Austin’s innate Authority as a Giant Dragon, they began undergoing an indescribable mutation, culminating in these transformed Beastmen.\n\"With such a dark aura saturating their whole bodies, henceforth they shall be called Dark Dragon Guards.\"\nA total of twenty Dark Dragon Guards were created, chosen from among the elite of the three major legions.\nPerhaps because of the Breathing Technique, these Dark Dragon Guards are a bit stronger than the previous Dragon Vein Attendants, all possessing Low Tier Bronze Level strength, and with such prowess combined, even Austin would have to exert considerable effort to destroy them all.\nMoreover, possibly due to the boost in Austin’s strength, several among the nine Dragon Vein Attendants from before have broken through to a certain extent. Coupled with the Breathing Technique given by the Dark Elf, their strength is comparable to the Dark Dragon Guards.\nIn this way, nearly thirty Low Tier Bronze Extraordinary beings, coordinating with each other, can exert a considerable restraining effect, even if Grom is a powerful close-to-Gold Level leader.\nIn addition to Austin being of Silver Level battle power, he is quite confident in the mission to exterminate Grom.\n\"Next, I must completely destroy the Blood Claw Tribe Branch!\"\nStaring at the hard-won Dragon Nest Tribe below, a glint of cold light flashed in Austin’s eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 104: Chapter 102 Dark Bull Cavalry\nFrom the very beginning, Austin coveted the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe\" in the north merely because there was a copper mine nearby. However, as time went on, the rapidly expanding \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe\" had already reached the point of threatening his own safety.\nThe invading forces led by the Dark Elves were defeated by Austin, yet the main strength of the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe\" remained, making it not so easy to deal with.\nFortunately, the gray bear chief Grom had left the tribe due to some affairs, otherwise, it would have been even more difficult to break through the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe\" at that time.\n\"With nearly thirty bronze low-tier modified Beastmen, this force should be enough to break through that tribe. No, I need another force capable of a frontal assault!\"\nTo thoroughly break through a tribe with comparable population strength, Austin needed not only the organizational and disciplinary level of the army but also another unit capable of launching a frontal assault to shatter the morale of the enemy tribe.\nHe remembered the ten Cow Cavalry established initially to form a cavalry unit!\nSeveral months ago, the Dragon Nest Tribe had broken through a Minotaur tribe, capturing nearly three hundred Minotaurs and obtaining a herd of wild oxen.\nAt that time, Austin had not yet recruited the Centaur Race, leaving a gap in cavalry, so he chose Beastmen to domesticate the wild oxen to form Cow Cavalry.\nUnfortunately, the oxen’s burst power and endurance weren’t strong, other than the shock impact of the group charge, they had no other advantages. Coupled with the fact that at the time, there were no tribes needing the heavy cavalry of the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin ended up only training ten Cow Cavalry, accumulating experience and leaving a seed for potential future situations.\nWhen facing the Blood Claw Tribe Branch, these ten Cow Cavalry might not play a significant role, as they were composed of ordinary Beastmen and wild oxen.\nBut now, Austin was not lacking resources like Sub-Magic Stone, which might allow for some level of modification on the wild oxen and Cow Cavalry!\nWith this in mind, Austin got to work immediately.\nHe summoned the ten Cow Cavalry to the modification lab, using electric currents to stimulate the magic power within the Sub-Magic Stones and employing the natural \"Authority\" of the Giant Dragon to modify the wild oxen and Cow Cavalry Beastmen.\nAlthough the Cow Cavalry was not one of the three major legions, they practiced the Dark Elf Breathing Technique, and post-modification, the Cow Cavalry Beastmen were not much different from ordinary Dark Dragon Guards.\nHowever, the wild oxen as mounts had undergone a dramatic transformation in appearance and other aspects.\nPerhaps due to their masters, the wild oxen as mounts were also stained with a trace of dark aura, their entire bodies turning gray-black. Perhaps due to the influence of Austin’s Giant Dragon \"Authority,\" scales began to grow indistinctly on their skin, covering vulnerable areas like joints. The entire head of the ox became more angular, with two horns soaring upward, gleaming a dark and sharp luster.\nAfter the transformation, the wild oxen appeared more fierce and primal, seemingly carrying traces of an ancient savage beast.\nAfter modifying the wild oxen, the Cow Cavalry conducted a charge on the square, and the momentum was like a tank rampaging, overwhelming and terrifyingly mighty.\nIn the face of such formidable heavy cavalry, even an equal number of Dark Dragon Guards might be easily torn apart. This power was evidently beyond Austin’s expectations. Unless there were Silver Level Transcendents, in front of these modified Dark Bull Cavalry, they would likely only be torn apart.\nElated by this, Austin commenced tactical drills for coordinated combat, facilitating inter-unit cooperation to minimize losses while destroying the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\"\nHundreds of Beastman soldiers drilled, complemented by forty modified Beastman Transcendents, creating an earth-shattering momentum, enhancing the Dragon Nest Tribe’s overall strength significantly in comparison to just a few days prior.\nThe next day, the predicted date of gray bear chief Grom’s return was not far off. To be safe, Austin led the entire army of the Dragon Nest Tribe, nearly emptying the nest, to sweep towards the direction of the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\"\n...\nInside the Blood Claw Tribe Branch.\n\"Get to work quickly, you lazy wretches!\"\nDespite the absence of the chief, various constructions continued within the village. On the work site, a sharp-eyed ratman overseer wielded a cracking whip, driving a team of Beastman slaves to hurry in digging trenches while cursing incessantly.\nUnder the scorching sun, the slaves on the work site were emaciated, drenched in sweat, while the malicious overseer’s eyes were as keen as a hawk’s, lashing out at any slight hint of loafing.\nUnder the scorching sun, the kobold Gary arduously carried a basket of dirt on his back, stumbling as he tried to haul it out of the trench, only to unexpectedly slip, tumbling into the trench with the basket dirt spilling down.\n\"Damned, you worthless slave, daring to slack off again!\"\nThe sharp voice rang out, and the whip transformed into several afterimages, lashing down.\nSmack! Smack!\nIn the crisp sounds, the fur on Gary’s body split open, revealing two whip marks that broke the skin and drew blood.\nThese two lashes nearly left him dizzy and faint, barely maintaining his balance to get up before collapsing again the next moment.\nHe had no strength left, had reached his limit.\nGary was originally a Beastman from a nearby small tribe, struggling daily to scrape by, barely making ends meet. Sometimes, when the yield was low, Gary would starve without a meal, although during harvest times, he managed to have a few decent meals with the tribe.\nSuch small tribes, surviving meal to meal, were plentiful throughout the Kawa Great Forest.\nUnder normal circumstances, the kobold Gary’s tribe would either be annexed or fade away in the Kawa Great Forest due to unviability, seldom developing smoothly as small tribes perished daily like strands of hair in the forest.\nHowever, last year, a group of Jackal Wolf People settled on the hillside nearby from unknown origins. Initially, Gary’s tribe did not pay much attention, or even if they did, there was nothing they could do; their small tribe was far outmatched in population and quality compared to the newly relocated Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\nBut who would have known, once the Jackal Wolf People secured their footing, they instantly tore away their facades and began attacking and cleaning up tribes on all sides, creating a bloody massacre and countless small tribes were obliterated.\nGary’s small tribe was also annihilated under the Jackal Wolf People’s attack, and he was captured and became one of the slaves under the Jackal Wolfman Tribe, forced to endure various burdensome labors under the supervision of the ratman overseer.",

      "content": "Chapter 105: Chapter 103: Raid\nBeastman slaves are not uncommon in the Kawa Great Forest. Whenever a tribe defeats and crushes an enemy tribe, they capture many prisoners.\nGenerally, these prisoners are either killed outright to save the tribe’s scarce food, or they are used as slaves, working themselves to death for their captors’ tribe.\nGary is one such Beastman slave, and the life of a Beastman slave typically doesn’t last more than a year.\nSeverely lacking food and excessive labor have drained every bit of strength from Gary, so much that he could no longer feel the whip striking his body.\n\"Am I going to die...\"\nThe strength quickly drains from his body, and Gary feels as if his body has become like wood. Ever since being captured by this tribe and forced to build various structures, he has noticed that once a Beastman falls on the work site, they never stand up again.\nIn a way, this is good. It’s too exhausting; he just wants a good sleep, never to work so hard again...\nHis vision becomes blurry, and Gary’s consciousness slowly sinks into darkness.\n\"Damn, another one died!\"\nAfter several lashes with no response from the Kobold on the ground, the ratman overseer curses and retracts his whip.\n\"You two, come over here, throw him to Lord Grom’s mount as fodder.\"\nThis tribe also keeps a ferocious carnivorous beast, tamed by the Gray Bearman Beastman Grom as his daily mount, which consumes a large amount of meat daily, including the captives who can’t hold on and die on the construction site.\nTwo emaciated Beastman slaves come over, dragging Gary out of the pit and walking towards the tribe.\nThe Kobold Gary still has a faint trace of consciousness, but he no longer has the strength to resist, only able to watch helplessly as he steps closer to the abyss.\n\"Beast God above, your humble servant Gary prays to you...\"\nMustering the last shred of his consciousness, knowing his fate, Gary prays in his heart, as the elders in the tribe have said that every Beastman returns to the embrace of the Beast God after death, to live a life free of hunger and war.\n\"What are you looking at, get to work quickly, or you’ll have no food today.\"\nCasually determining the fate of a trivial life, the ratman overseer yells at the nearby Beastman slaves, cracking a whip at the one standing closest.\nThe emaciated Beastman slaves dare not speak, slowly dispersing.\nThough yet another companion dies before their eyes, the Beastman soldiers of this tribe are not to be trifled with. There have been slave revolts in the past, but the captives here are mostly from small, scattered tribes captured by the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe,\" and any elite Beastman Transcendent from the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe\" can easily crush them single-handedly.\n\"Damn it, what a bastard, one day he’ll get what’s coming to him.\"\nAn ill-tempered Beastman captive curses under his breath.\nPerhaps the Beastman’s cursing caught the attention of some ethereal Divine being, or perhaps it was something else, for before his voice faded.\nWhoosh!!!\nA massive shadow suddenly crashes from the sky, bringing with it a chilling gale. The arrogant ratman overseer has no time to react before he hears a splat, being smashed into pulp.\nThe surroundings fall into silence.\nStaring blankly at the soft ground, at the gigantic stone embedded and stained with gore.\nWhat is this?\n\"Enemy attack!!!\"\nThe first boulder falls from the sky, followed by a second, a third... densely packed boulders plummet from the sky like meteors, crashing into various parts of the tribe, toppling buildings. The falling stones roll with terrifying force, killing and injuring those they contact.\nSlaves on the construction site flee in panic, and the Beastmen within the tribe are terrified, faced with what seems like divine punishment.\n\"Gather, quickly gather! There’s an enemy!\"\nAfter all, it’s a branch of a Great Tribe, and elite fighters are present within. Under their hasty rallying, the Beastman army begins assembling within the tribe.\nHowever, at this moment, through the dense forest, squads of troops charge from the woods outside, shouts shaking the heavens, sweeping in like a tsunami.\nThe Blood Claw Tribe Branch, still in chaos from the earlier stone rain, has its elite Beastmen only just starting to regroup the scattered comrades. The tribe’s outer walls are sparsely manned by scattered patrol guards, who are quickly overwhelmed by the advancing army.\nBang bang bang!!!\nThe formidable strength strikes the outer walls of the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\" The wooden walls soon collapse under the assault of the Dragon’s Nest army.\n\"Kill! Kill them!\"\n\"For His Highness Austin!\"\nThe black, orderly army surges through the breached walls into the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe\" with overwhelming momentum, the defending Beastmen unable to resist and are scattered, fleeing in all directions.\nThe outer \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe\" Beastmen can’t withstand the fierce assault from the Dragon Nest Tribe. Beastmen emerging from the buildings are easily scattered, the outer defenses shattered by the Dragon Nest Tribe as if cutting through soft wood.\nVictory seems in sight.\nBut this easy advance doesn’t last long; with the hindrance of the outer Beastmen, the inner elite Beastmen finally gather enough troops and charge forward.\n\"Attack! For the glory of the Blood Claw! Deliver a painful blow to the vile enemy!\"\nThe outer forces scattered, but the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe\" has no shortage of brave elite Beastmen, brandishing massive weapons and shouting as they rush at the Dragon’s Nest formation.\nThese elite Beastmen are mostly Bronze Level Transcendents, leading fierce and strong troops of Beastman soldiers.\nWith elite Beastman Transcendents at the fore, the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe\" finally mounts a makeshift resistance.\nBoom!!!\nAs the two armies clash, blood sprays into the air. Despite the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe\" being caught off guard, then having their defenses breached by the Dragon Nest Tribe’s unstoppable advance, leaving their counterattack chaotic, the elite forces of the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe\" manage to fill the gap, struggling hard in the face of Dragon Nest Tribe’s coordinated formations.\nThough the Dark Dragon Guard and Dragon Vein Attendants serve as vanguards, along with the well-coordinated Beastman army behind them, both sides are locked in a grueling battle, blood and limbs flying, the battlefield heavy with the stench of blood.",

      "content": "Chapter 106: Chapter 104: War Demonic Artifact\nOne by one, the orcs of the Dragon Nest Tribe charged into the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe\" through the collapsed walls. The tightly-knit army formation, akin to a meat grinder, found itself embroiled in a bitter struggle within the inner area. The number of elite enemy orcs compensated for other shortcomings. If it weren’t for the adept cooperation and tight formation of the Dragon Nest orcs, they might have already been overturned by the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\"\nCentaurs formed ranks, moving around the perimeter to unleash volleys of arrows. Arrows rained down one by one, killing enemy orcs and continuously striking at the morale of the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\"\nYet, even so, both sides were still locked in a fierce battle.\nThe Blood Claw Tribe was a large tribe located hundreds of miles to the north. Although it’s unclear why they diverted forces here to establish a base, they lacked neither food nor reinforcements. The tribe’s elite orcs were mostly Bronze Level Super Professionals, with many of middle and high tier. Even the ordinary orcs were exceptionally elite.\nAs for the Dragon Nest Tribe, the reformed Dark Dragon Guard and Dragon Vein Attendants barely had the strength of Bronze Low Tier. If it weren’t for the well-trained army and their ability to cooperate and triumph against stronger enemies, they might have already been routed by the \"Jackal Wolfman Tribe.\"\nAmid the bloody battle, orcs were pierced by long spears or had their limbs smashed by the massive weapons swung by Extraordinary orcs. The battle had entered a vicious hand-to-hand combat stage.\nIf there were no unexpected events, this brutal fighting would continue until one side could no longer hold out.\nAnd given the current evenly matched situation between the two armies, with faith and discipline providing an absolute advantage, the Dragon Nest Tribe was destined to be the last to collapse.\nHowever, when that time comes, the Dragon Nest Tribe might suffer heavy losses.\nAustin naturally wouldn’t allow such a situation to occur. Even if they managed to attack the Blood Claw Tribe branch successfully, he would still have to face another formidable enemy.\nThat would be the ruler of this Blood Claw Tribe branch, Grom, who had not yet returned from the Blood Claw Tribe’s headquarters.\nAccording to the Dark Elf, Grom’s strength was already close to the Gold Level standard.\nIf it were a solo fight, Austin certainly wouldn’t be able to defeat him alone. The Dragon Nest Tribe’s clan would have to exhaust his stamina or restrain him on the side, joining forces with Austin to encircle and kill him.\nFor this reason, the Dragon Nest Tribe’s clan must not suffer too many casualties.\nJust as Austin in the dense forest at the rear was about to move out, suddenly,\nWoo, woo, woo!\nFrom the central hall of the tribe came the deep and resonant sound of a horn, as if a spirit of war emerged from the horizon, covering every corner of the world.\nUpon hearing this horn, the orcs on the Blood Claw Tribe branch’s side were immediately invigorated, as if something in them was awakened by the unseen. Even the tribe’s most elite Extraordinary orcs became ferociously brave, as if each orc gained a few extra imposing forces from nowhere.\nInstantly, the balance of war tipped toward the Blood Claw Tribe branch.\nFacing the seemingly berserk Blood Claw Tribe orcs, the Dragon Nest Tribe struggled to hold on, but as the sound of the enemy’s horn echoed across the sky, they couldn’t help showing signs of defeat.\n\"Is this... a War Demonic Artifact? Hmph!\"\nIn the dense forest behind the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin, initially preparing to step onto the battlefield, was clearly taken aback, then let out a cold snort.\nThe so-called War Demonic Artifact is naturally a magical artifact crafted for war, possessing group enhancement effects. For instance, the current horn sound faced by the Dragon Nest Tribe contained Magic Power, able to awaken the fierceness within their orcs and even subtly hypnotize them, achieving the effect of significantly enhancing the combat power of their soldiers.\nApart from the mysterious horn of the Blood Claw Tribe, similar simple War Demonic Artifacts exist worldwide, some capable of greatly augmenting the output capabilities of Mages or Warriors. In the legacy memories of Austin’s Dragon Ball, humans used plenty of these War Demonic Artifacts or similar War Enhancement Scrolls while hunting dragons.\n\"A War Demonic Artifact, hmm, time to take matters into my own hands!\"\nWith a sigh, Austin unfurled his wings and took flight.\nBehind the Dragon Nest Tribe, a massive shadow flapped powerful gales, descending slowly from the sky, landing behind the Dragon Nest Tribe. The dragon’s might swept across the land, and visible shockwaves rolled outward.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nAustin bellowed into the heavens, his thunderous voice ascending to the skies and sweeping every corner around.\n\"My subjects, annihilate them!\"\nThe voice, like thunder, swept across the land. Its ancient and solemn tone even overshadowed the horn of the Blood Claw Tribe, the airflow and windstorm rising alongside it.\nInitially, there was silence all around; the next moment, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe erupted in cheers.\n\"Oh! For Lord Austin!\"\n\"Charge!\"\nWith Austin’s appearance, the Dragon Nest Tribe orcs immediately seemed to surge with adrenaline, madly brandishing their weapons and charging forward. The deeply ingrained steadfast belief, the individual faith in Austin’s utmost reverence, was instantly ignited with his entrance.\nThe impact of this belief far surpassed the horn of the Blood Claw Tribe, leading to a counterattack by the Dragon Nest Tribe that directly suppressed the Blood Claw Tribe’s side.\nBut that is not enough!\nAustin understood that although the Dragon Nest Tribe temporarily subdued the enemy’s morale, it was far from defeating them thoroughly.\nTo crush the enemy swiftly and defeat this tribe with minimal cost, he would have to act personally!\nHis membranous wings slowly unfurled, generating a savage whirlwind as Austin’s massive form ascended, hovering in mid-air.\nCrackle!!!\nWith the activation of Talent Magic, the Magic Power inside began converting into currents of electricity flickering around, thick lightning like a thumb dancing wildly in the air, as intense gales surged around.\nThunder Strike Technique!\nBut it wasn’t merely Thunder Strike Technique. With the third Talent Magic activated, Austin could control the electric currents and lightning within his range, with Thunder Strike Technique’s thunder being one of them.\nPreviously, when Austin used Thunder Strike Technique, the resulting lightning struck directly from the sky onto the enemies.\nBut now, with the Thunder Control Talent Magic, the thunder generated by the Thunder Strike Technique was completely under his command.\nStrands of electric currents danced wildly in the air, emitting dazzlingly bright light, piercing the sky with rumbling sounds, gathering terrifying power amid the fierce wind above.",

      "content": "Chapter 107: Chapter 105 Thunder Roar Cannon\nRumble!!!\nAmidst earth-shattering booms, a mass of lightning was born from the void, streaks of electric light turned into long serpents dancing wildly in the air, the lightning interwoven, like an overwhelming net spreading into every corner of the surrounding space.\nUnder the flickering thunder and lightning, the surrounding Beastmen quickly dodged, leaving a vast space around Austin. The formidable dragon’s aura was like thunderous wrath; none could approach within ten meters of him, and the Blood Claw Tribe opposite felt as though they were facing the onslaught of an avalanche and tsunami.\n\"Dragon! Dragon! Dragon!\"\n\"Quick, stop him!\"\nThe elite Beastmen of the Blood Claw Tribe were visibly panicked, terror overflowing in their expressions.\nIgnoring Austin’s natural intimidation as a Giant Dragon to ordinary Beastmen, watching the streaks of wind and thunder lightning surrounding his body sweep the air, every Beastman, no matter how foolish, understood that nothing good could come of this.\nYet with Austin’s appearance, the Beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe were like getting a shot of adrenaline, their erupting momentum suppressed the Beastmen of the Blood Claw Tribe, and no one could break through the army’s defense lines before them to reach Austin.\nAt that moment, a pitch-black, mountain-like cloud drifted in unnoticed in the sky, dimming the heavens and casting a vast shadow.\nSuddenly, a strong wind swept through the world, responding to the wind and thunder, ribboned with lightning, seemingly tearing through space, an astonishing aura rising, as if the soil beneath suffered some heavy pressure, large areas crumbled, fist-sized pieces of earth floating weightlessly, swirling among arcs of electric light.\nMeanwhile, as the Blood Claw Tribe’s Beastmen were distracted, staring in terror at Austin enveloped in electric light, like a divine demon, the Dark Bull Cavalry initially ambushed behind the Blood Claw Tribe began their charge unknowingly.\nSeizing the moment when all focus was on the Dragon Nest Tribe Beastmen and Austin, the Dark Bull Cavalry lined up, decisively charging from behind the Blood Claw Tribe.\nRumble!!!\nIn the deafening sound, the ground trembled lightly, at the rear of the Blood Claw Tribe, a line of Dark Bull Cavalry charged out like tanks driven by elementary sound waves, smashing the earth, raising rolling clouds of dust, their horrible impact force instantly crushing the outer walls, destroying everything in their path; not just the Beastmen, even houses were destroyed and collapsed into a pile of ruins, devastation wherever they went.\nSimultaneously, the Centaur cavalry, skirmishing peripherally, had unknowingly reached the back of the Blood Claw Tribe, laying down their bows and arrows, forming into a military formation, long spears in hand.\n\"Centaurs, charge!\"\nWith the Legion Commander’s order, the Centaurs lined up neatly, gripping their wooden spears tightly, charging directly down the route opened by the Dark Bull Cavalry.\nThe Dark Bull Cavalry, with their overwhelming impact, swept past the rear of the Blood Claw Tribe, clearing the path for the Centaur cavalry charge.\nThe cavalry group charged swiftly, with a terrifying force like a tidal wave.\nThe resisting Blood Claw Tribe Beastmen, caught off guard, were overwhelmed instantly as the cavalry stormed into their midst, plunging their entire resistance force into chaos, even with elite Beastmen barely recovering to counterattack, the resisting force was on the verge of collapse under the swift, successive cavalry assaults.\nAnd at this moment,\nAustin had already unleashed the Thunder Strike Technique five times in total, the thunder and lightning produced by the Thunder Strike Technique were entirely controlled by the Talent Magic Thunder Control; streaks of crackling electric snakes gathered, sounding like sharp chirping birds.\nNext, Austin spread his massive wings wide, opening his menacing jaws.\nZzzlaa!!!\nThe lightning gathered violently yet obediently under the power of Thunder Control, surging ahead, as streaks of thunder formed a basketball-sized, unstable thunderous paste ball in front of the opened jaws, emanating a dazzling white light.\nThe next moment,\nSwoosh!!!\nThe tightly compressed thunderous paste ball suddenly opened a fissure, instantly spewing forth thunder, a blue lightning laser beam shot from Austin’s mouth, slicing through space, sweeping across the void in front of him, crashing into the heart of the Blood Claw Tribe.\nRumble!!!\nIn an instant, an earth-shattering boom swept over, accompanied by blinding light illuminating the world, as if knocking out the sun and moon’s luster, the Blood Claw Tribe Beastmen hit by the lightning beam didn’t even have time to react before being incinerated to ashes, the surrounding ground suddenly collapsed under a visible shockwave, the floor cracking like glass, nearby Beastmen caught by that terrifying energy storm were swept off their feet, tossed high into the air.\nSimultaneously, as the terrible shockwave spread, ribbons of lightning erupted in all directions, blinding electric furrows sweeping the earth, scorching the ground into cracks, pebbles rising into the air.\nThe lightning beam’s arrival was swift and sudden; the explosion’s impact and the streaking electric snakes caused enormous casualties, instantly reducing the Blood Claw Tribe’s resistance force by half, leaving only two to three hundred barely standing, all wounded, their combat and morale plummeting to rock bottom, dispersing completely.\n\"The power, it’s somewhat lacking.....\"\nWatching a single shot from the Thunder Roar Cannon decimate the Blood Claw Tribe, scattering them, Austin pondered silently to himself.\nBack when he broke through, this technique he invented based on Thunder Control swept through a vast forest, its power simply terrifying.\nHowever, at that time, he borrowed the sky’s thunder, while this time he used the Thunder Strike Technique he triggered himself, the energy gathered each time being vastly different.\nNevertheless, it’s enough; the Blood Claw Tribe is utterly done for.\n\"Oh! For His Highness Austin! Kill!\"\n\"Kill! His Highness is right behind us!\"\nWith Austin’s roar obliterating the remaining resistance, the Dragon Nest Beastmen, as if invigorated, charged back, their momentum overwhelming, utterly overwhelming the already collapsed Blood Claw Tribe, scattering like headless chickens, wholly consumed by the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"Surrender and you won’t be killed! Surrender and you won’t be killed!\"\nA powerful voice shouted, and the fleeing Blood Claw Tribe Beastmen defected en masse, with only the occasional elite Beastman resisting helplessly before being engulfed by the morale-boosted Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nSeeing victory assured, with the Blood Claw Tribe on the verge of utter defeat.\nAt that moment,\n\"You damn reptiles, you’re courting death!\"\nFrom the distant sky, a voice as wrathful as the heavens boomed like thunder rolling across the land, filling every corner of the world, shaking heaven and earth, making the whole terrain tremble. The Dragon Nest Beastmen found it hard to keep their ground under the surging pressure, their eyes darting around in shock.\nSimultaneously,\nRumble!!!\nThe sky was filled with a thunderous boom, a pillar of overwhelming force swirled past, leaving the ground in ruins, earth lifted in massive volumes, obscured by stormy winds, blotting out the sky!\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website.

      "content": "Chapter 108: Chapter 106: The Terrifying Grom\nThe earth shook violently, accompanied by a huge roaring sound, as if an earthquake had arrived. Cracks spread across the ground, shattering and collapsing, and the Beastman standing on the earth couldn’t keep their balance, falling to the ground with faces full of fear.\nAt the same time, a massive air blast surged from afar like a flood, turning everything in its path, be it giant ancient trees or collapsed houses, all into powder.\nLike a steel-like gale tearing through the earth, large patches of soil rose up with the airflow, rolling in as if an apocalyptic catastrophe had arrived.\nRumble!!!\nThe terrifying air blast swept across a vast area, crashing into the crowd. Countless Beastman were caught in the fierce wind, thrown into the air, then smashed heavily to the ground along with the soil and rocks that blocked out the sky.\nFrom above, the Blood Claw Tribe, already mostly collapsed from the previous attack, was now a wasteland. At this moment, a horrifying air blast poured through and penetrated, creating a massive deep chasm, splitting the entire Blood Claw Tribe in two.\nThe Beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe along the direct path of the air blast were swept into the high sky, scattered everywhere, emptying a large area instantly, suffering egregious losses.\nAs the storm subsided, the sweeping dust in the air gradually dissipated.\nThe fortunate surviving Beastman, still in shock, stared blankly at the massive chasm extending from the distant forest, running through the entire tribe, their faces filled with fear and terror.\nAnd at that moment, at the end of the chasm.\nBang, bang, bang...\nThe sound of footsteps pounding the ground came from the darkness surrounded by dust, like battle drums from the ancient times, reverberating in every Beastman’s heart, each step resonating heavily upon them.\nAt the starting point of the chasm, among the dense forest, an enormous figure, like a demon overshadowing the sky, slowly emerged from the dust, carrying an overwhelming aura that covered the four directions, making every Beastman felt as if a mountain was pressing down on them.\nEven Austin felt an indescribable pressure at this moment, gazing solemnly at the end of the forest.\nRustle!\nA gentle breeze blew from one side, sweeping away the dust surrounding the shadow, revealing a terrifying figure like a towering iron pillar.\nIt was a one-eyed Grey Bearman, three meters tall, with bristle-like fur all over, a body that seemed forged of steel, emanating a tremendously powerful aura.\nOn his shoulder, he carried a giant two-meter-long Wolf Fang Club, which glowed faintly. Just standing there, he was like a giant covering the sky, casting a grim shadow over all the Beastman present, making the surrounding space dim down, plunging every Dragon Nest Tribe Beastman into a dark abyss.\n\"Grom, the leader of the Grey Bearman, trouble is brewing this time...\"\nAustin had seen Grey Bearmen before, whether during the dark elf-led attack or assaulting this Blood Claw Tribe Branch, Grey Bearmen always served as the main elite force resisting the attacks of the Dragon Nest Tribe Beastman.\nHowever, none of the Grey Bearmen exuded such a terrifying aura as Grom, the mere sight of him was like facing a towering mountain.\nJust the three-meter stature alone vaguely oppressed even Austin, coupled with that terrifying aura, had Grom returned during the assault on this Blood Claw Tribe Branch, the scales of war might have fully tilted in favor of the Blood Claw Tribe, even if Austin personally entered the fray.\n\"A bunch of tiny reptiles, and an oblivious Young Dragon, just fitting, there’s a spot for a dragon’s head on my throne!\"\nWith a loud boom, Grom planted the massive Wolf Fang Club into the ground, causing it to quake.\nThe grim one-eye swept over the crowd, an indescribable pressure weighing heavily on every Beastman’s heart.\nTremble,\nFear!\nFaced with a mountain towering to the sky, they fell into the shadowy abyss of despair.\n\"If you want my head, let me see if you have the guts!\"\nAustin would not stand by idly while his clan Beastman were so easily suppressed, spreading his wings wide, he soared into the air with a mighty airflow, heading fearlessly towards the Grey Bearman leader Grom with a thunderous roar.\nRumble!!!\nIn an instant, Austin transformed into a fleeting shadow flying across the void, appearing above Grom in a blink. A gigantic shadow descended from the sky with rolling torrents, amidst electric flashes, the monstrous iron claw tore through the wind and cloud, bearing down on Grom with the weight of a thousand catties.\nThis terrifying claw seemed to tear the entire space apart, with such frightening power it could shred even a cliff into pieces.\nYet against such overwhelming power, Grom remained unmoved, a sneer appearing on his fierce face:\n\"Don’t rush, little Blue Dragon, that’s no way to die either!\"\nWith a forceful swing of his massive wrist, the giant Wolf Fang Club of two meters rose with a howl, intercepting upfront.\nSssss!!!\nThe giant Wolf Fang Club flickered with light, clashing brutally with a dragon claw potent enough to shatter mountains and ridges. The air was immediately filled with a sharp, piercing whine, as if in the moment of collision the air shattered, a horrifying sonic boom swept in all directions, transforming into a tangible storm.\nThe ground around Grom sunk abruptly as if under some invisible force, large chunks of soil crumbled, and cobweb-like cracks spread widely.\nThe terrifying sonic boom and gale from the collision swept around, raising a monstrous storm of scale twelve, throwing up large patches of soil, sweeping away countless Beastmen into the torrent, rolling and tossing them over the ground, while the distant forests swayed violently under the fierce gust, almost snapped in half.\n\"Hey, little Blue Dragon, if you were an adult, I might be wary, but how dare a hatchling just a few years old act arrogant in front of Lord Grom, die!\"\nWith a furious roar, Grom burst with Fighting Qi, launching a volcanic torrent of air blast soaring skyward, causing the surrounding ground to sink again.\nUnder this volcanic eruption-like torrent, Austin staggered violently. Even before he could steady himself, the massive Wolf Fang Club descended with an earth-shattering might.\nRumble!!!\nIn just a blink, Austin’s body morphed into a huge projectile surging backward, crashing heavily onto the ground, the soil within ten meters around caved in like tofu dregs while Austin’s body kept rolling and scraping backward, shattering the entire ground along the path into pieces, forming a gigantic chasm. The devastating force turned everything along the way into dust, crashed far into the forest, enveloped by towering clouds of dust...",

      "content": "Chapter 109: Chapter 107 Blood Burning\n\"Your Highness!\"\n\"All beastmen, block that guy!\"\nSeeing Austin being knocked out of the air by Grom’s club, the remaining beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe instantly snapped back to their senses. Within the previous experiences of the Dragon Nest Tribe, every beastman had already regarded Austin as an absolute lord-like existence, an incomparable admiration accompanied by unmatched loyalty.\n\"Charge! It’s time to sacrifice for His Highness!\"\nAccompanied by a roar, the beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe charged forward fiercely with wooden spears, their eyes blood-red, as if Grom held a vendetta against them.\n\"Do you think a swarm of ants can take down an elephant?\"\nGrom roared, sweeping the massive wolf fang club across the air, causing a storm of wind to ravage the ground, smashing large pieces of the earth, and sweeping beastmen into the air with powerful gusts.\nYet how could these beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe possibly feel fear?\nHaving undergone multiple brainwashing sessions and led by Austin from hunger to prosperity, all the beastmen in the Dragon Nest Tribe had a resolve to sacrifice for Austin.\nOne group of beastmen was blown away, and the next immediately charged forward, even if the front line was swept into bloody mist by the giant club, they were unafraid.\nWith wave after wave of attacks, despite Grom’s explosive rage, he was firmly held back by Austin’s clan.\n\"Damn it! Cough cough...\"\nWithin the collapsed forest, Austin staggered to his feet, his scales cracked open, and blood flowed out like lava from the wounds, dripping onto the earth.\nPreviously, Grom’s club launched him into the air with such terrifying power that it even cracked his durable scale armor.\nBut Austin had no time to worry about his injuries, watching the beastman clan charging up only to be knocked away repeatedly, his heart ached.\nThese beastman clans, whom he spent great effort to gather and train, were now dying like cannon fodder in rows.\n\"All ordinary beastmen fall back, Dragon Vein Attendants and Dark Dragon Guards, hold them back!\"\nOrdinary beastmen, facing Grom, would be injured or killed on contact, using their lives to delay his steps and deplete his energy. Only the modified Dragon Vein Attendants and Dark Dragon Guards could barely survive a strike.\n\"Use Blood Burning!\"\nThe leader of the Dragon Vein Guards, in a fit of rage, roared, his entire body exploded, igniting in a fiery blaze, veins bulging on his skin, his aura swelling mightily, as visible energy waves spread out.\nAt the same time, the modified beastmen, like Rodney, all exploded, unleashing the greatest power within their bodies.\nThough initially, during the Dragon Vein Attendant modification, they gained a talent magic akin to berserk, forcibly boosting their power by activating their blood. Austin named this talent magic Blood Burning back then.\nAfter Blood Burning’s burst, the Dragon Vein Attendants fell into extreme weakness, and in subsequent wars, Dragon Vein Beastmen had no use for this desperate measure, thus it wasn’t used on the battlefield.\nBut now, facing the terrifying bear leader Grom, there was no choice but to gamble everything.\nBoom boom boom...\nWith the explosive burst of the Dragon Vein Attendants and Dark Dragon Guards, they fought jointly to barely fend off Grom’s attack. The bear leader roared repeatedly, but modified beastmen who had unleashed their greatest power, one after another, rushed forward. Despite his superior strength to any modified beastman, he had to focus all attention on the foes before him, amid the siege.\n\"Damn it, I’ll crush you all!\"\nGrom roared repeatedly, his wolf fang club shattered the ground, his dreadful Fighting Qi whipped up a stormy torrent, yet these Blood Burning-modified beastmen were far beyond ordinary Dragon Nest Beastmen. Originally, even without bursting, the Dark Dragon Guards could smash a rock with a punch. Now, with Blood Burning exploded and supported by numbers, they managed to hold Grom completely.\n\"No, I need to figure something out!\"\nAt this moment, the Dragon Nest Beastmen kept retreating, leaving a large area empty in the middle, where the ground cracked and rocks splintered upwards amidst fierce battles, sometimes a modified beastman was blown away and crashed out.\nAustin knew very well that even if these modified beastmen all used Blood Burning, they could only hold Grom for a while, slightly draining his power. It was impossible to rely on them to completely defeat and slay Grom.\nA decisive force is needed...\nAustin was acutely aware that only by unleashing power capable of defeating Grom in a single stroke, could final victory be achieved.\nHowever, earlier, to crush the Blood Claw Tribe’s resistance, Austin consecutively used several Thunder Strike Techniques, and finally formed Thunder Roar Cannon with Thunder Control, even with Austin’s improved power, it was taxing. The magic power stored within him was already more than half depleted.\nIf he attempted the same strategy again, the power generated might not be enough to kill this fearsome Grom.\n\"I must gamble it all once!\"\nWatching modified beastmen being blown away one after another, Austin’s face showed a fierce expression.\nHis third talent magic, Thunder Control, if placed on other indigenous Blue Dragons, would probably become an electric shock paralysis akin to worthless ability, but Austin was not a native dragon. Even for obscure abilities, with his imaginative thinking from a previous life, he could turn it into something unique.\nActually, after unlocking the third talent magic, besides developing it into a powerful attack like Thunder Roar Cannon, Austin had envisioned another attack inspired by a comic he read in his past life. However, restricted by conditions, he hadn’t tried it yet.\nBut now, it seemed necessary to unleash it.\nRumble!!!\nUnder the cloudy sky, bolts of lightning descended in succession, then under Austin’s Thunder Control, blinding electric light swirled around him like tamed animals.\nZap...\nAmidst the harsh lightning blooms, electric snakes spread, extending into every corner of the air, then forming a ring.\nAs grand currents unfolded, an immensely powerful magnetic field formed in the void. All around the Blood Claw Tribe, scattered iron weapons, even iron weapons held by Dragon Nest Beastmen, were at this moment pulled by a strong force, as the gathered lightning assembled before Austin, hovering in the air...",

Given the mobilization abilities of the primitive Beastman Tribe, even if those from the Blood Claw Tribe headquarters get word and send reinforcements for revenge, it would take at least half a year; during that period, with the Natural Magic Crystal in the Spider Cave, it’s enough to elevate my Power to another level. By then, what would I have to fear? Besides, it’s uncertain whether the Blood Claw Tribe would even care much about a branch being wiped out.\"\nHaving forcefully slain the greatest threat Grom, while breaching the nearby Blood Claw Tribe Branch, eliminating potential threats completely, the Dragon Nest Tribe, with its center, would undoubtedly become the dominator within a radius of several dozen or even a hundred miles.\nWith the Magic Crystal within the Spider Cave, it would be enough for Austin to transform into a formidable Beastman army, coupled with the Breathing Technique, the future remains untold.\nNonetheless, those matters are for later.\nFor now, the priority is to pack up and return to the tribe.\n\"Vini, tidy things up, prepare to go back.\"\nCalling the leading Kobold of the Dragon Nest Tribe, Vini, and enduring the collapsing body, Austin casually delegated the aftermath matters, soaring into the sky and flying away, enduring the pain within.\nIn this battle, the Dragon Nest Tribe suffered considerably, with a rough estimate of casualties possibly exceeding half.\nBut Austin had neither the time nor the inclination to scrutinize the Beastmen’s casualties; avoiding collapsing at the scene and being ungracefully carried back to the Dragon Nest by the Dragon Nest Beastmen, seizing the last thread of strength within him to fly back alone was Austin’s best choice now.\nDespite the significant damage on the Dragon Nest Beastmen’s side to eliminate that Blood Claw Tribe Branch, it’s hard to say if it was worth it, but at least the potential crisis was dealt with, concerning his personal safety, which Austin remained very vigilant about.\nAs Austin went further away, underneath the ruins that had turned into a wasteland, thunderous cheers erupted from the participating Dragon Nest Beastmen, echoing toward the sky, celebrating the victory and Austin’s immensely powerful display of strength.\nAustin glanced back momentarily, then turned and flew away.",

      "content": "Chapter 111: Chapter 109: Post-War Gains\nA great victory over the Blood Claw Tribe Branch eliminated any potential threat and once again strengthened the power of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThis time, all three major legions of the Dragon Nest Tribe were deployed, and even the newly transformed Dark Bull Cavalry was sent into battle. However, under the final counterattacks of the Blood Claw Tribe and Grom, the Dragon Nest Legion suffered direct deaths numbering in the hundreds, and there were no shortage of wounded Beastmen being carried back by comrades, with even the transformed Beastmen losing over half during the final fight.\nHowever, alongside sustaining heavy casualties, the Dragon Nest Tribe captured a significant number of enemy Beastmen.\nFrom the surprise attack of the Dragon Nest Beastmen, to the unstoppable advance into the tribe’s inner areas, followed by the Dark Bull Cavalry’s rear assault, the Centaur Army’s flanking charge, and finally Austin’s Thunder Roar Cannon that wiped out the remaining resistance of the Blood Claw Tribe.\nA series of strikes left the Blood Claw Tribe Branch, despite having a force of over a thousand Beastmen, being defeated step by step by the Dragon Nest Tribe’s side. Even when the Grizzly leader Grom made a sudden return, no resistance force could be organized.\nIn the end, when Austin’s Electromagnetic Cannon seemed to break through the heavens and earth, reducing Grom to dust, the terrifying aftermath ruined everything, and the remnants of the Blood Claw Tribe lost all will to resist and were completely captured by the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nDuring the end of the war, many local Beastmen scattered into the jungle, but with the high mobility of the Centaur Army, during the post-battle scavenging, most were captured and taken prisoner, with only a few remaining individuals slipping away, which likely wouldn’t cause any trouble.\nThus, it could be said that the entire Blood Claw Tribe Branch had been completely annexed by the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nEventually, nearly seven hundred Beastmen captives were gathered, including many elite Beastmen at the Bronze Level of extraordinary professionals. Of course, most of these captives were wounded, and their spirits were broken by Austin’s Electromagnetic Cannon, leading them to docilely allow themselves to be bound with ropes and driven towards the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThe Beastmen within this division of the Blood Claw Tribe were generally strong and robust, and after recovering from their injuries, going through military training, brainwashing, and other methods of integration into the Dragon Nest Tribe, would greatly enhance the overall strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAmong these captives, what Austin valued most were those elite Beastmen who were extraordinary professionals.\nAlthough the elite Beastmen of the Blood Claw Tribe also suffered significant losses, they themselves were an important asset. Moreover, the breathing techniques in their minds could greatly enhance the foundation of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAs for the issue of loyalty, the truth is, in this grassland, the civilization of the Beastman tribes is still in a primitive civilization stage, not having developed copper or iron, and their concept of home and country is exceedingly thin.\nThe cohesion of the large tribe systems is based on the brutal rule of survival of the fittest; the weak willingly submit to the strong. Just like the Dark Elves, since Austin defeated their tribe and killed Grom, it represents that he is stronger, and they are more inclined to seek shelter under a stronger person’s power.\nMoreover, compared to other tribes in the Kawa Great Forest, the Dragon Nest Tribe has a mature brainwashing system, so after some time, the induction of these elite Beastmen into the Dragon Nest Tribe system is not a concern.\nVini, while organizing the captives into groups, also began to loot this now-ruined tribe.\nThe sweep of the battlefield didn’t yield much; a pile of wooden spears, a pile of grass roots for food, moldy jerky—iron weapons had already been consumed in attracting the magnetic field during Austin’s use of the Electromagnetic Cannon. In general, there was a lot gained, but the value was limited.\nHowever, some items were quite precious. From the remnants of the tribe, the Dragon Nest Beastmen found the war horn that could boost Beastman morale. When this war demonic artifact was used, the Blood Claw Tribe Beastmen were able to withstand the Dragon Nest Tribe’s counterattack against the wind, playing a significant role in the war.\nAlso, within the remaining rubble, the Dragon Nest Beastmen found a crossbow carriage covered in runes, glowing with magical light, which seemed to have been passed down from the civilized world of humans, along with several armor-piercing crossbow arrows. When Austin came to explore initially, he was shot from afar; it was likely with this crossbow carriage.\nFortunately, when Austin led the Dragon Nest Legion, the timing was too precise, and the Blood Claw Tribe couldn’t organize sufficient resistance. Moreover, with Grom the leader absent, no Beastman thought to use the weapon stored in the library. Otherwise, if a sudden arrow were shot during the chaos, it could have been troublesome.\nApart from this magic armor-piercing crossbow carriage, the Dragon Nest Beastmen also found some breathing techniques recorded on worn-out Beast skins in the ruins, which Vini solemnly protected to personally deliver to Austin upon return.\nAfter the sweep, there seemed to be no more valuable items in the ruins, so Vini began to lead the troop to retreat, first lifting the heavily injured Beastman comrades, with those less wounded supporting each other, binding the captives in lines with ropes. Centaur cavalry patrolled the surroundings, and the entire large troop majestically moved towards the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nOf course, part of the forces were left behind to station at the remnants of the Blood Claw Tribe.\nAlthough the whole tribe had been devastated, and most buildings had collapsed, the foundational materials like wood and thatch remained. Austin would need to start the significant task of refining copper here, and thus leaving a part of the Dragon Nest Tribe Beastmen to establish a bridgehead was fitting.\nNot to mention, there were still large quantities of food within the Blood Claw Tribe, which weren’t easily transportable, necessitating a guard presence here.\nThe main force busily worked back, spending considerable time before finally returning to the Dragon Nest Village.\nThe population of the Dragon Nest Tribe burgeoned again, various intricate matters causing some chaos within the whole Dragon Nest Tribe, although issues of food, accommodation, and training would be addressed later.\nCurrently, the most pressing issue the Dragon Nest Tribe faced was the large number of wounded.\nThe brutal warfare led to a significant number of casualties among both the Dragon Nest Tribe’s Beastmen and the Blood Claw Tribe’s captives. Although Beastmen’s life force is stronger than that of ordinary humans, without comprehensive follow-up aid, a large number of them might still perish.\nIn this context, the medical system previously ordered by Austin and established by the Fox-faced Man Quik, proved extremely important.",

      "content": "Chapter 112: Chapter 110: Sleeping\nIn this world, there is no such profession as a doctor, or rather, the emergence of magic and other extraordinary powers has significantly suppressed the emergence of the doctor profession.\nSimilar to Austin’s previous life in the Western Middle Ages, the so-called \"doctor\" treatment methods were mostly bloodletting treatments, and there was no discovery of certain herbs in the wild that could treat certain diseases of the body.\nWith the popularization of divine techniques by the church and various healing potions, the intellectuals at the upper echelons saw no need to research these things. Those with knowledge strived to become scholars or mages, and those with means would directly receive divine healing from the church or purchase potions when ill. Consequently, without the involvement of intellectuals, even if farmers or other lower classes occasionally discovered a secret recipe or two, it would ultimately get lost over time and fade away.\nIn this world, the soil for the survival of the doctor profession is exceedingly barren.\nEven among the many beastmen in the Kawa Great Forest, apart from one or two tribes occasionally discovering and cherishing certain plant properties, they ultimately failed to form a complete medical system.\nDuring the initial stages of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s construction, Austin discovered this flaw.\nIn fact, Austin was well aware that as the Dragon Nest Tribe expanded in this world where one struggles against the heavens for survival, a mature medical system is incredibly important for the development of a tribe. After all, there was no beastman priest under Austin, and the costs of those divine techniques or magical potions meant these treatments could not be widely accessible.\nJust like in the human world, for the lower-class farmers, falling ill essentially meant death. Burdened with heavy taxes every day, they could not possibly save up to buy healing potions or avail themselves of divine healing opportunities. That was precisely because these treatments were far beyond the affordability of ordinary farmers and couldn’t be popularized.\nAs the population of the Dragon Nest Tribe gradually increased, until it gathered thousands, or even tens of thousands of people in the future, even if beastman priests appeared later, they wouldn’t be able to provide for the sick beastmen at the base level.\nTo solve this problem, after Rodney and others were bitten during their exploration of the Spider Cave, and Austin found the antidote within it, Austin came up with an idea.\nAn idea to recreate the herbal treatment system of traditional Chinese medicine from his previous life in this otherworld.\nIt was an enormous project, and Austin didn’t spend his energy on it. Instead, he let Quik, the fox-faced man with an interest in it, begin various accumulation experiments, attempting treatment on beastmen injured during daily production, and recording all kinds of data to see if they could recreate the traditional Chinese medicine treatment system from Austin’s previous life in this otherworld.\nAt the same time, during the conquest of various tribes, they interrogated the remaining members of each beastman tribe, recorded the properties of certain plants occasionally discovered by those tribes, or collected their fortunate discoveries of secret recipes, to comprehensively try and gradually establish the medical system of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nInitially, the medical system established by Quik was practically synonymous with dread among the beastmen in the entire tribe.\nBut as time passed and various attempts were made, the envisioned medical system eventually began to establish its foundation step by step and gradually started to show its impact.\nAnd now, amidst the heavy casualties of this great war, Quik’s medical system finally played a significant role.\nUnder Vini’s coordination, houses were cleared out as infirmaries, and large amounts of herbs were gathered from the mountains and forests, either applied externally or decocted as medicine. Broken bones of beastmen were straightened and tied with sticks, and many beastmen lay resting in the infirmaries, with the air filled with the scent of herbs.\nAlthough the medical system was not yet fully established, because of the many unforeseen injuries that occurred during the heavy production activities of the Dragon Nest Tribe, Quik and the others initially didn’t lack injured beastmen to experiment on, so they were already able to provide simple care and treatment for external injuries.\nFortunately, the injuries from this war were mostly external, and the experience accumulated from daily production activities could also be smoothly applied to these injured beastmen.\nWith medical care and the assistance of various herbs, many beastmen began to recover.\nIf it were other beastman tribes, lacking treatment and food support, perhaps only a tenth or two of the injured beastmen would survive after the battles. But now, with the medical system Austin had Quik establish, the survival rate of the injured beastmen reached over ninety percent.\nMoreover, with the experience gained from this extensive treatment, the treatment system became more mature, gaining more experience in treating external injuries.\nIt is conceivable that with the passage of time, someday this rudimentary medical system will eventually develop into something significant.\n....\nAs time passed, the injured beastmen began gradually recovering under medical care, and the entire Dragon Nest Tribe gradually entered a state of steady development.\nHowever, as the master of the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin didn’t show up much. Perhaps due to the severe injuries from the great battle, or maybe it was growth, Austin hid inside the Dragon Nest, in slumber, not remaining awake for long periods as before. Only occasionally did Vini or Quik and others come to see him, reporting on the tribe’s affairs and making various decisions.\nDuring the times he was awake, Austin provided the general strategy for the future development of the Dragon Nest Tribe. He could clearly feel that this time he genuinely needed to slumber for a while.\nThough perhaps due to his soul, Austin wasn’t like other young dragons who would sleep for a decade or two. His various production habits and growth rates also differed greatly from the dragon species in his memory. However, slumbering for a while was inevitable.\nIn the past dragon life, Austin had never truly tried to slumber, at most just feeling drowsy for a time. However, back then, being alone and weak, if he truly slept, he might have found himself becoming another giant beast’s meal in his slumbering state. After toughing it out for a while, things would be fine.\nNow, having gathered a group of clan forces under his leadership, there’s no doubt that within a radius of dozens of miles, it could be considered an undisputed overlord-level force. With sufficient security and protection, Austin didn’t mind slumbering for a while.\nAfter arranging the general strategy for the Dragon Nest Tribe’s future development, Austin could no longer resist the drowsiness and fell into slumber.\nBut it’s fortunate that he feels his slumbering growth period is estimated to be only between half a month to a month and won’t delay too many matters.",

      "content": "Chapter 113: Chapter 111 Food\nAustin’s slumber within the Dragon Nest Tribe didn’t cause much of a stir. Apart from the daily prayers in the morning and evening, the lives of Dragon Nest Beastmen continued on the usual path, gradually moving forward. Under various divisions of labor and cooperation, the Dragon Nest Tribe is steadily expanding, with its strength growing rapidly and swelling.\nThe Blood Claw captives are also obedient, not causing any trouble because of Austin’s slumber. Through successive treatment and subsequent military training and transformation, the captives from the Blood Claw Tribe have started to integrate into the entire Dragon Nest Tribe system.\nIt is conceivable that soon, the Beastman captives will completely integrate into the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThis also allowed the upper echelons, including Vinek, to breathe a sigh of relief. In fact, before his slumber, Austin had handed over the War Horn and Magic Crossbow Arrows confiscated from the Blood Claw Tribe to Vini as an emergency precaution in case of any accidents during his slumber.\nNow it seems, they can indeed breathe a sigh of relief.\n...\nWith the addition of a large number of Beastman captives, the total population of the Dragon Nest Tribe now steadily exceeds two thousand, with over fifty extraordinary Beastmen among them.\nSuch a large force has become an undeniable dominant force in the nearby region, justifying Austin’s decision to enter slumber and delegate security defense to his clan.\nGiven such a large population, the daily consumption of food is also enormous. Fortunately, after the previous cold winter ended, the Dragon Nest Tribe started reclamation and planting. After half a year of reclamation and development, the tribe has accumulated a large amount of food. Although, due to time constraints, planting only Earth rice can sustain the Dragon Nest Tribe, which has expanded to over two thousand people, for only a little over two months.\nHowever, now there are still half a month away from the cold winter season. Coupled with the Earth rice and various grains harvested from the reclaimed fields, the tribe can barely support itself through the three-month cold winter period.\nOf course, this calculation is purely based on consumption. In reality, Dragon Nest Beastmen, apart from the harvest from the reclaimed fields, can also go out to gather and hunt.\nAs the cold winter approaches, whether it’s fruits or various prey, the forest has become very abundant, and all living creatures seem to be having their final celebration this year.\nSending Beastmen out for hunting and gathering each day yields a large amount of fruit, Earth rice, and seeds. Additionally, with the joining of Centaur Beastmen and the urgent efforts from the Goblin Manufacturing Workshop, enough arrows have been produced to allow Centaurs to exploit their long-range advantage.\nDuring each hunting expedition, due to the excellent discipline among various hunting regiments and their teamwork, combined with the Centaur Beastmen’s strong running endurance and ranged advantage, they basically return fully loaded.\nAfter a few days, the harvested prey not only supplies the tribe but there is considerable surplus.\nAlthough the Beastman hunting teams can hunt a lot of prey each day, a large part of the daily harvest is directly made into jerky by the Beastmen, with only a portion mixed with Earth rice and other grains consumed on the same day.\nBesides reclamation and planting, and hunting and gathering, some of Austin’s previous plans have also begun to show their effects.\nFor instance, the mushroom room led by Finn produces a large amount of mushrooms daily, which the tribe can’t consume entirely. Many nontoxic mushrooms are dried, stored, and taken out to enjoy when they can’t cultivate mushrooms in the Banyan Forest during the cold winter.\nAlso, in terms of animal husbandry, the wild cattle herd obtained after capturing the Minotaur Tribe doesn’t need much mention; hundreds of wild cattle are enough for the entire Dragon Nest Tribe to eat for over half a month. Of course, the Dragon Nest Beastmen wouldn’t squander them like that. Wild cattle not only accelerate the reclamation speed of the Dragon Nest Tribe but, once trained, the Cow Cavalry can exert extremely powerful strength, whether for production, transportation, or combat. The wild cattle herd plays an incredibly strong role unless diseased, injured, old, or weak, Beastmen wouldn’t easily eat the wild cattle.\nAlthough wild cattle cannot be slaughtered, the wild boar herd raised is easier to slaughter.\nDespite Earth rice harvested after planting and Beastmen’s leftovers can be used as feed for the penned wild boar herd, to save feed during the cold winter, the Dragon Nest Beastmen picked out over a hundred wild boars for slaughter, leaving only around thirty as breeding pigs for next year.\nOf course, those over a hundred penned wild boars are presumed to be slaughtered after the cold winter sets in because the entire Dragon Nest Tribe is preparing for its arrival. Hunting outside, gathering, harvesting from reclaimed fields, everyone’s workload has reached the limit. Even the Blood Claw Tribe captives, after a few days of simple training to develop some discipline, have increased their labor hours significantly, thus reducing military training and transformation time, which can only be resumed in a strict phase after the cold winter arrives.\nAlso, it is indeed convenient to pen these hundred or so wild boars and slaughter them after the cold winter sets in as the cold and snow will preserve them.\nRegarding animal husbandry, besides wild cattle and wild boars, the wild rabbit population has also exploded.\nUnder the Beastmen’s management, comfortable living, sufficient food without worrying about sudden threats from Hunters, the wild rabbit population has exploded, initially only a few dozen, growing to over a thousand silently in six months. To corral these creatures, Beastmen had to build several beast pens to accommodate them all.\nCompared to the penned wild boars and wild cattle, the fate of these penned wild rabbits might be even less fortunate, as Vini plans to slaughter most once the cold winter arrives, leaving only a small portion as breeding rabbits.\nEven though the Dragon Nest Tribe’s population has surged by seven or eight hundred, breaking the two thousand mark before the cold winter arrives, thanks to the harvest from reclamation, hunting, gathering, and various methods of animal husbandry, the Dragon Nest Beastman Tribe hasn’t faced a \"food crisis.\"\nIt is expected that if nothing unexpected occurs during this cold winter, the food within the Dragon Nest Tribe will suffice to support the tribe’s survival and development for half a year, which is far beyond the duration of the cold winter. We can anticipate the Dragon Nest Tribe will be free from hunger this cold winter.",

      "content": "Chapter 114: Chapter 112: Brickmaking\n\"Hurry up, you lazy bunch!\"\n\"Bring over all that prepared mud, damn it, Sharu, move faster!\"\n\"Alright, put all the mud bricks in, light the fire, quickly, if you don’t burn enough bricks today, you’ll be sleeping in the hut during the cold winter!\"\nNot far from the Dragon Nest Tribe, by a certain riverbank, a limping Kobold stood on high ground, energetically commanding a group of Beastmen to work.\nNot far from the river, on the bank, beside a yellow clay hill was an excavated area, forming a square mud pit. The edge of the hill had a lot of yellow soil dug out and placed into the pit. One by one, Beastmen poured water into the pit, then several hulking Beastmen trod back and forth in the mud pit continuously.\nIt didn’t take long for the soil to be mixed into clumps of mud slurry.\nNearby, Beastmen came over, transporting the mixed mud in batches to a simple workshop not far away. Inside the workshop, mud-covered artisan Beastmen grabbed large clumps of the dough-like mud and stuffed them into rectangular brick molds made of four planks of wood, pressing hard to fill every crevice of the brick mold with mud, then scraped off the excess mud protruding from the brick mold with a wooden piece, threw away the extra mud, flipped the filled mold so that the empty side faced the ground, and lifted the wooden mold upwards, revealing a clay brick on the table.\nWith the artisan Beastmen swiftly working, a large number of brick prototypes soon appeared on the side.\nThen, another team of Beastmen came over, taking the bricks away to an open area to dry.\nAfterwards, yet another team of Beastmen placed the previously dried bricks into a nearby kiln, using wood or charcoal for firing. After burning for a day or two and then cooling them down, a kiln of red bricks suitable for construction was produced.\nIndeed, the limping Kobold was in charge of directing the Beastmen to carry out the brick firing work.\nLong before this, the Goblins’ manufacturing workshop had successfully fired bricks based on Austin’s description, and to prevent fire hazards, Austin ordered the Beastmen to start renovating the houses of the Dragon Nest Tribe, replacing the entirely wooden ones with mixed brick-wooden structure houses.\nHowever, this reconstruction project consumed a tremendous amount of human resources, so the renovation work had to be progressed step by step, and the work of remodelation hasn’t completed until today.\nThough the cold winter is approaching, manpower is in serious shortage across various departments. Nonetheless, constructing enough housing before the cold winter arrives is exceedingly important, hence the number of people involved in brick firing hasn’t decreased but rather received substantial support from the tribe’s manpower.\nBrick firing isn’t a difficult job. Once the manufacturing workshop’s Goblins recreated this brick firing technique, they passed it on to other Beastmen, and now the limping Kobold takes charge of this domain.\n\"Faster, faster, faster!\"\nWith the cold winter nearing and the Dragon Nest Tribe’s sudden increase of seven or eight hundred people, although the Dragon Nest Tribe continuously expanded, the sudden population influx made it difficult to free up enough housing for accommodation, hence the brick firing work was on a very tight schedule.\nFortunately, during the recruitment of population for constructing the Smoke Tower in the beginning, the Dragon Nest Beastmen had fired a considerable amount of charcoal on the hill where the Smoke Tower is located, partly solving the fuel issue, otherwise needing to go out and chop wood would be even more troublesome.\n\"Uncle Ge, our teacher asked us to bring you some drinking water.\"\nBefore long, a few young Beastmen strenuously carried over a half-person-high wooden bucket-like object covered with a lid, led by the half-person-height Kobold girl, Nina.\n\"Alright, everyone take a break.\"\nLooking at the sky above, the limping Kobold felt they had been working long enough, so he announced a break.\nThe entire tense team then relaxed, gathering in small groups on the open ground. Nina quickly distributed wooden bowls to the exhausted Beastmen, then used a ladle to pour the soup water from the wooden bucket into them.\nFor a moment, the entire open area resonated with the sound of \"gulu, gulu\" of drinking water.\nThe soup brought by Nina and her companions wasn’t just plain boiled water; it contained a peppercorn-sized fruit that would release white salt grains on its surface when ripe. These fruits were called salt fruits by the Beastmen and were the main source of salt for the Dragon Nest Tribe Beastmen.\nWith the increasing number of Dragon Nest Tribe Beastmen, the demand for salt fruits has gradually grown, so after collecting the salt fruits, the Beastmen even removed the weeds around the salt fruit trees, cut down surrounding trees, loosened the soil, and applied some fertilizer in hopes of making them more flourishing and bear more salt fruits in the future.\nMeanwhile, Vini also planned to carve out a dedicated grove for planting salt trees, but salt trees take a long time to grow, so they had hastily planted a bit, much like the red fruit seeds Austin had found at the Blood Wolf Lair, which were left unattended after planting.\nBoiling salt fruits in water created a kind of lightly sour and salty water. The salt water was crucial for restoring strength.\nBrick firing is labor-intensive, and it’s best for the Beastmen, who sweated a lot, to replenish with salt water.\n\"Little Nina, do you listen to the teacher usually?\"\nThe limping Kobold sat on a log, taking the wooden bowl Nina handed over, and his rough hand patted her head.\nIn the Dragon Nest Tribe, newborn and young Beastmen were managed by a separate department because their parents had to work and couldn’t spend much time on the children. They organized the young ones together, managed by several elderly Beastwomen.\nThese Beastwomen not only managed the Beastmen cubs but also taught them various survival skills, basic knowledge, and the simple cultural knowledge Austin needed to spread. Of course, more activities involved practice, helping with things the tribe could use, such as leading water delivery teams as they did now.\nThis kind of system, unprecedented even in the entire Kawa Great Forest, had the Beastmen calling Austin those who managed the young ones, \"teacher.\"\n\"Of course, I listened. The teacher even praised me yesterday. Also, Uncle Ge, could you stop patting my head? I heard kids won’t grow tall if their heads are often patted!\"\nNina pouted with dissatisfaction but continued handing the wooden bowl filled with soup to the limping Kobold.\n\"Ha ha ha...\"\nHearing Nina’s innocent words, all the Beastmen present burst into hearty laughter, which swept away the fatigue from their earlier labor, filling the open area with joyous waves.",

      "content": "Chapter 115: Chapter 113: Work Points\nAfter drinking the saltwater and resting for a while, it seemed that the beastmen had mostly recovered, and the limping kobold stood up.\n\"Alright, Nina, thanks for the saltwater. Hurry back, don’t keep your teacher waiting too long.\"\nThe cold winter was approaching, and the beastmen’s task of brick-making was still heavy, so they could only rest occasionally; there was still a large amount of work to be done.\nOriginally, after annexing the 780 people from the Blood Claw Tribe, the population of the Dragon Nest Tribe had again increased. It seemed that there shouldn’t be a lack of manpower, but in reality, the needs for food, clothing, and shelter for the new population had to be addressed. Moreover, with the cold winter approaching, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe needed to make more preparations for the winter’s food supply. Even though the beastmen captives hadn’t completed their full military transformation training, they were all brought out to be assigned to various teams, which highlighted the labor shortage.\n\"Goodbye, Uncle Nage, goodbye everyone.\"\nUpon hearing this, Nina bid farewell to the limping kobold and the group of beastmen, and led a group of beastman children with empty wooden buckets back into the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nWatching Nina and the group of beastman children leave, the limping kobold then turned around.\n\"Alright, alright, everybody get up, let’s get to work!\"\n\"Oh, Captain, can’t we rest a bit more? This work is really exhausting.\"\n\"Get lost, you lazy bunch! Whether you want to work or not, if you slack off any more today, you won’t get any work points!\"\nThe beastmen, originally covered in mud, also started to move, albeit slowly. But as soon as they heard the word \"work points\" from the limping kobold, all of the beastmen immediately stood up with a buzz and began working swiftly.\n\"Hmph, a bunch of lazy bones, if I don’t give you a hard time, you really think you’re somebody!\"\nThe limping kobold cursed as he directed the group of beastmen to start working.\nThe concept of work points was naturally devised by Austin, as a reform undertaken to better fit the current military and political system of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nInitially, under Austin’s command, there were only seven and a half kobolds, and hence the distribution method was like that of a lord and his peasants. The peasants worked within the domain, and more than half of everything they produced was to be turned over, with the remainder kept as their own.\nAt that time, the number of Austin’s clan members was small, and the kobolds joined in a single tribe manner, so Austin did not introduce any other system reforms but continued the tradition of the Seta Continent.\nHowever, as the Dragon Nest Tribe developed, the population of the entire tribe grew, and every beastman underwent military training, with daily tasks assigned accordingly. Beastman groups collaborated on various tasks. Under such a united command and labor cooperation system of all-out effort, if the beastman tribe continued the previous lord-peasant siphoning method, it would inevitably clash with the military arrangement of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAfter all, just like the goblins in the manufacturing workshop, who handled a large amount of wood daily inside the Dragon Nest Tribe to turn it into various weapons, although weapon production was crucial for the tribe, there was no source of food for them.\nIf the relationship between Austin and the clan members of the Dragon Nest Tribe still adopted the tax levy arrangement of a lord and dependent peasants, then the goblins in the manufacturing workshop would not get any food, which was clearly impossible.\nTherefore, with the expansion of the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin gradually reformed the distribution method of the entire tribe.\nFrom the initial tax levy to a large-scale communal system when the population increased, to step-by-step evolution into the current work points system.\nThis was also normal. Considering the military-civil unity and task directive tribal system of the Dragon Nest Tribe, it was fundamentally impossible to use the lord-peasant distribution method.\nAnd now, almost all the adult beastmen in the entire Dragon Nest Tribe had undergone military training, were integrated military and civil, similar to those fiery times of the fifties and sixties in Austin’s previous life, thus Austin gradually started steering towards those times, launching communal meals, and with the richness of various foods in the Dragon Nest Tribe, extending to the work points system.\nBy working hard, one could earn work points distributed by the beastman captain, and more work points meant better food.\nBefore joining Austin’s Dragon Nest Tribe, many beastmen struggled to have consistent meals, often going hungry or having inconsistent meals. Now, as long as they worked hard, although it was a bit tiring, every meal was ensured to be filling. How could those beastmen who had just escaped those previous harsh living conditions not work hard?\nOf course, at the start of the work points system in the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin also knew that these systems were basically good in the early stages, but various issues would gradually arise as time went on, though those would be dealt with bit by bit later.\nFor that Blue Dragon overlooking the entire Dragon Nest Tribe of over two thousand people from above, the limping beastman naturally didn’t understand its thoughts.\nHe stood on high ground, directing a team of beastmen to work back and forth, then glanced toward the majestic tribal settlement slowly rising from the forest, feeling a great sense of contentment welling up in his heart.\nThe beastmen under his command were only a small part of the tribe. The entire Dragon Nest Tribe, with more than two thousand people, worked orderly under this system, continually contributing to the tribe’s rise.\nWhat wisdom it was, never before had such a beastman tribe appeared within the Kawa Great Forest. And the Austin who made all of this happen had long occupied a god-like status in the heart of every beastman.\n\"Who would have thought that this day would come?\"\nThe limping kobold was among the initial seven and a half kobolds recruited by Austin.\nHe still remembered being expelled from the main tribe, enduring countless hardships along the journey, losing companions one after another, and feeling directionless. Eventually, his foot was injured during a hunt, an injury that spelled death in a life of wandering. As he was about to fall into utter despair, unexpectedly, a turn for the better came, and the honorable, kind, and wise His Highness Austin took them in, incorporating them into the clan.\nAt that time, the entire tribe only had a total population of seven and a half kobolds, suffering from hunger and thirst, and they were at risk of not surviving the cold winter.\nAnd then, who could have imagined that today would come, that the entire tribe would expand to a great tribe of two thousand people in a short period, that they would build one warm house after another, cultivate one plot of land after another, train soldiers who swept through tribe after tribe, and have grain in the warehouse piled like mountains, without worries of hunger, cold, or enemies.\nReflecting on the panic and helplessness of those times, standing proudly in the Kawa Great Forest today, the limping beastman can’t help feeling a deep sense of emotion.",

      "content": "Chapter 116: Chapter 114: Mighty Power\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe, which started with just seven and a half Kobolds, has now expanded to dominate an area spanning several tens of miles. Not even the lame Kobold could have anticipated this, nor did Vini, the current Governor of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nUnder Austin’s decision to establish the tribe, it has grown into this massive entity within a year.\nThe speed of this expansion and growth is shocking to every Beastman who joined early; no one could have imagined that this monstrous group built by Austin, the Blue Young Dragon, using various insights from his previous life, would develop to such an extent.\nThis force, organized using the systems and knowledge Austin knew from his past life, still harbors an incredibly frightening energy. Although Vini and the other top members of the Dragon Nest Tribe are not extraordinarily gifted individuals, following Austin for a long time, and with significant daily management training, they are now capable of seeing much further and wider.\nThis is a colossal entity on the verge of awakening, poised to shock the entire world when it reveals its claws.\n\"What a great power, this wisdom is beyond our imagination...\"\nVini stands high in the City Hall, overlooking the neatly arranged houses, where Beastmen are organized in an orderly fashion at the village’s edge. From Vini’s vantage point, they appear as ants working together to steadily construct and expand the tribe.\nThe strict organization and coordination between various tasks are closely knitted by the bonds of military and governance, with every Beastman in the Dragon Nest Tribe becoming like screws twisted tightly together, forming this vast system.\nAmong the initial seven and a half Kobolds who joined under Austin’s banner, their fragmented tribe was originally driven out from internal strife within another Great Tribe. As their leader, Vini had once lived in that tribe, and owing to this, when compared to that old tribe, the system created by Austin for the Dragon Nest Tribe is even more astonishing.\nIn fact, throughout the Kawa Great Forest, strictly speaking, every tribe living here is merely a gathering place for groups of Beastmen banding together for better survival. They have no survival systems and very little cooperation; their battles are scattered, not even comparable to street brawls from Austin’s previous life.\nUnder such a scattered organization, neither the production capability nor the construction ability can compare to that of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"When we first joined under His Highness Austin, my clan and I were already in dire straits, unable to foresee any path ahead. At that time, we only had seven clansmen, a few broken wooden spears, leftover animal skins, and a tattered stone bowl. Every clansman was starved, skin and bones, with no hope in sight.\"\n\"Back then, His Highness appeared before us. Initially, we thought we were going to die, but in the end, His merciful Highness took us in, allowing us to survive under His protection. At that time, we had just escaped a life-and-death crisis, sleeping directly in nests under the Dragon’s Nest for the past few nights. Every morning, our fur was drenched with dew.\"\n\"At that time, our greatest wish was merely to live safely under His Highness’s protection every day, obtain enough food from the nearby territory, and build a small makeshift shelter to shield from the wind and rain for the coming cold winter season.\"\n\"No one could have imagined that all these changes would happen so swiftly. His Highness taught us many things, from coordinating to kill the first Ghost-headed Crocodile, to annexing the remnants of Rodney’s tribe, to besieging the Blood Wolf pack, recruiting populace, reclaiming lands, and attacking to annex other tribes, progressing step by step from nothing to the current state.\"\n\"Now, even if His Highness Austin were to slumber, with the Dragon Nest Tribe’s capacity to rapidly muster a fighting force of two thousand, along with the power of dozens of Extraordinary Beastmen, we are enough to dominate a vast area of a hundred miles without any rivals.\"\nVini stood high, gazing down at the continuously expanding tribe houses, his voice filled with awe.\n\"Indeed very great, His Highness’s wisdom is as boundless as the sky and sea, which is why I so easily surrendered to serve His Highness originally. His Highness is unlike any Lord I have ever seen, not just on the surface but internally. I have never heard of such a Dragon Lord, who not only started such an enterprise before coming of age but also didn’t indulge in plundering gold coins and crystals. Instead, He spends a tremendous amount of time on managing and developing the clan, treating the clan differently from other Dragon Race lords. Even among the Beastman Great Lords near the Border Great Wall, I have not seen anyone more capable than His Highness.\"\nOn the rooftop, the Dark Elf, Adinlek, standing behind with a longbow, spoke softly, his eyes flickering, lost in thought.\nIf this continues, perhaps it could...\nThe Dark Elf secretly plotted in his heart, some buried things deep inside began to slowly sprout.\n\"What’s the matter? Did you come to see me for something?\"\nVini turned around and asked the Dark Elf.\n\"Yes, it’s about food.\"\nHearing this, the Dark Elf snapped back, suppressing his plotting, and started to explain the purpose of his visit.\nThere exists an unbridgeable gap in strength between Extraordinary Beastmen and ordinary Beastmen. Even a Bronze Level Lower Tier Extraordinary Beastman can easily defeat several times more enemies, let alone the talent abilities that can be awakened once one becomes Extraordinary.\nBut similarly, the greater the power, the more food and energy must be consumed. Substances like arrowroot starch from plants simply cannot suffice the consumption, necessitating a large intake of meat.\nCurrently, with the transformed Beastmen and captured Extraordinary Beastmen, the Dragon Nest Tribe has a total of fifty-six Extraordinary Beastmen. The meat consumption required by these Extraordinary Beastmen each day is an enormous number, even with the current scale of the Dragon Nest Tribe, supporting so many Extraordinary Beastmen feels strenuous.\nThough Extraordinary Beastmen and transformed Beastmen can hunt enough food in the wild, the problem is that wild animals are ultimately limited. In recent days, the prey caught by the hunting party has gradually decreased.\nThe wildlife within the territorial expanse of several tens of miles cannot sustain the entire tribe, especially the consumption of several tens of Extraordinary Beastmen. Therefore, the Dark Elf has come this time hoping to lead a team to hunt Giant Beasts, to solve this issue facing the Dragon Nest Tribe.",

      "content": "Chapter 117: Chapter 115 Submission\nGiant Beasts are powerful creatures that roam throughout the Kawa Great Forest, classified as something between ordinary beasts and magic beasts.\nGiant Beasts do not possess Talent Magic, but magic power grants them extremely formidable physical conditions. Their massive bodies crush almost all hunters and are one of the top-tier monsters in the food chain within the Kawa Great Forest.\nIf one could hunt a Giant Beast, the meat from their mountain-sized bodies is enough to sustain the entire Dragon Nest Tribe for a day!\nGiant Beasts are not uncommon in the Kawa Great Forest. When Austin initially chose the location to establish the Dragon’s Nest, it was away from the roaming grounds of Giant Beasts. Therefore, neither the last cold winter nor other times have seen much of their tracks.\nHowever, as the Dragon Nest Tribe developed and its hunting teams continually explored outward, several sightings of Giant Beasts have occurred. It is imaginable that within a radius of over a hundred miles, many Giant Beasts are active among the mountains and forests.\nGiven the current strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe, organizing Beastman Transcendents along with sufficient elite beastmen might be able to surround and kill them.\nGiant Beasts are carnivorous hunters by nature. If they are slaughtered, they can provide the Dragon Nest Tribe with a substantial amount of meat and clear out top-tier hunters like them, increasing the animal population in the surrounding areas of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"Hunt Giant Beasts?\"\nVini frowned slightly upon hearing this, thought for a moment, and shook his head:\n\"The power of a Giant Beast isn’t much different from an Extraordinary Magical Beast and may even surpass it. It might cause significant casualties. This isn’t urgent; let’s decide after His Highness awakens.\"\n\"With His Highness in slumber, it’s best to prioritize stability during this period. Cold winter is approaching, and the more than seven hundred beastman captives don’t yet have enough housing. The most important issue now is the Dragon Nest Base.\"\n\"Alright, but with the addition of Extraordinary Beastmen, the manpower for the hunting team’s expeditions is now excessive. If needed, part of the hunting team could be redeployed for other tasks.\"\nAlthough Vini rejected this suggestion, the Dark Elf did not find it strange, as after Austin fell asleep, the Dragon Nest Tribe immediately lost half its combat power. A contraction strategy is normal, with everything being for His Highness Austin.\nWith Austin in slumber, the Dragon Nest Tribe entered a stable period.\nThe Dragon Nest Beastmen were heavily training the beastman captives while continuously constructing the tribe’s base and quickly harvesting crops like kudzu root, obtaining food from the external forest and storing it in the warehouse.\nExternally, after the war with the Blood Claw Tribe Branch, the Dragon Nest Tribe didn’t advance further or sweep across larger areas of other beastman tribes but instead began retracting its claws. Even the Dragon Nest Tribe’s hunting teams didn’t venture far from the Dragon Nest Base.\nYet even so, within tens of miles around the Dragon Nest Tribe, other scattered beastman tribes felt a sense of terror.\nThe terrifying power of that day’s battle, visible even from over ten miles away, when later the beastmen cautiously investigated, they could see the ruins of the Blood Claw Tribe and the partially collapsed hill nearby.\nSuch power, who could withstand it?\nIn addition to the earlier period when the Dragon Nest Tribe launched multiple offensives, swept through, and annexed beastman tribes one by one, this overwhelming force already instilled deep fear in other, more distant beastman tribes. Now, the battle at the Blood Claw Tribe Branch had completely shattered their willingness to resist.\nWith cold winter approaching, it’s impossible for these tribes to leave even if they wanted to. Compared to the unknowns of life and death outside, their old nests, cultivated over many years, with houses and food, increase their chances of surviving the merciless winter.\nAmidst such circumstances, the beastman tribes around the Dragon Nest Tribe united and made a decision.\nThat is to prepare to submit and affiliate themselves with the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThe law of the jungle is the principle of this world, especially in the Kawa Great Forest, affiliating with the strong is not something unbearable, on the contrary, it is quite natural, especially when the Lord is of the Giant Dragon Race.\nThe remnants of the Blood Claw Tribe, beside the half-collapsed hill, have already frightened the chiefs of these beastman tribes to the core. Instead of waiting for the Dragon Nest Tribe to come and sweep them away, turning them into prisoners, it’s better to go over with their followers now.\nCreating such a significant force in the Kawa Great Forest, certainly marks someone worthy of following, not to mention those beastmen from the beastman tribes who were conquered and annexed are still alive and well, aren’t they?\nTherefore, under the guidance of various factors, the remaining small beastman tribes around the Dragon Nest Tribe decided to submit.\nThe renown of the Dragon Nest Tribe was so great that these weak tribes surrendered almost without a fight, as emissaries brought \"precious\" gifts to the Dragon Nest Tribe, offering sacrifices to the great His Highness Austin in hopes of becoming his subjects.\nWhen they entered the Dragon Nest Tribe, seeing houses neatly arranged, an orderly and disciplined army, complete armor and weapons, and the tall City Hall in the center built purely of bricks, they were even more resolute in their intentions to seek affiliation.\nNow that Austin is asleep, he certainly couldn’t be aware of this. Everything is handled by Vini, the current Governor of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nFor the sudden appearance of dozens of beastman tribe \"envoys,\" the Kobold leader Vini felt both happy and anxious.\nHe was happy that the Dragon Nest Tribe’s reputation could make these small tribes around the Dragon Nest Territory surrender without a fight, actively requesting to join and affiliate with the Dragon Nest Tribe, a far stronger result than defeating each tribe in the past and annexing them.\nHis anxiety came from having no precedent for handling these affiliations and relationships with these subordinate tribes. Now Austin is in slumber, there’s no way to report and obtain guidance, and he was unsure if his decisions were right or wrong.\nAfter some deliberation, Vini finally decided to take these affiliates into the fold, expanding the scale and population of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nSimultaneously, he had requirements. Firstly, it was non-negotiable that all affiliating beastman tribes must undergo the Dragon Nest Beastmen’s military training transformation to be integrated into the Dragon Nest system.",

      "content": "Chapter 118: Chapter 116: Results\nMilitary training was originally an idea proposed by Austin to enhance the combat capabilities of his seven kobold subordinates, with strict regulations binding group cooperation to exert powerful collective strength.\nLater on, after overcoming numerous difficulties to train the kobolds into an army, Austin indeed achieved the results he desired. Following military training and strict group coordination, the kobolds vanquished the Ghost-headed Crocodiles, each of which was several times stronger than themselves, producing power beyond Austin’s imagination.\nMoreover, after the baptism of blood, those initial seven kobolds seemed to be reborn, becoming increasingly powerful, like forged iron swords undergoing quenching to reveal a sharp, chilling gleam.\nEven the routed soldiers led by Rodney, several times the number of kobolds, were badly defeated under the tightly coordinated formations of the kobold tribe.\nSubsequently, Austin used the seven kobolds he trained as seeds to continually train the beastmen who joined later, gradually incorporating them into the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThe military structure extended from military training not only firmly controlled every beastman in the Dragon Nest Tribe but also maximized the group’s power. During this period, the entire tribe entered a rapid development phase, quickly achieving a position akin to that of a regional overlord.\nAs the tribe developed, the beastmen underwent military training, directly changing their food acquisition and distribution methods, gradually aligning towards a governance model resembling that of a major country in the fifties and sixties from Austin’s past life.\nAlthough history proves that this model faced numerous problems in the future necessitating reforms, it is undeniable that at the beginning, when the nation was extremely impoverished, this system mobilized the people’s strength, allowing the country to win an almost unwinnable war. Subsequently, a complete industrial system was established, developing nuclear and hydrogen bombs, launching satellites into the starry sky, astonishing the world time and again.\nNo matter whether problems arise in the future, at least at the current stage, this system plays a tremendous role in uniting the Dragon Nest Tribe’s power to accomplish extraordinary feats.\nIt is precisely for this reason that military training, as the first seed Austin planted to influence this world, runs through the entire developmental process of the Dragon Nest Tribe, and naturally, it cannot be abandoned lightly.\nThus, even those tribes that willingly surrendered must undergo transformation through military training.\nThrough military training transformation, the beastmen’s laziness and lack of collective awareness are eradicated, filling their minds with obedience to orders. Moreover, through the military system, these beastmen are fully absorbed and integrated into the Dragon Nest Tribe, thereby unleashing the maximum power of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe.\nIn the entire Dragon Nest Tribe, apart from the three main corps, even the civilian militia, goblins in the manufacturing workshop, and even beastman cubs spend time each day in group training to enhance order-following and group coordination awareness.\nUnder such circumstances, it is natural for the surrendering beastman tribes to undergo military training transformation. Even if Austin awoke, he would likely insist on this point; thus, Vini made this the first condition for their submission.\nHowever, this meant that after military training transformation, the original beastman tribe would be disbanded and reorganized, and the original beastman tribe leaders would have no power left. How could they readily accept this?\n\"Lord Vini, is there truly no room for negotiation in this matter? I am willing to give up all my wealth, just to continue commanding my team after joining the Lord...\"\nThe beastman envoys requesting to join and submit to the Dragon Nest Tribe were generally high ranks within a beastman tribe, including possibly the tribal chief.\nAlthough beastmen think simply, they inevitably contemplate matters concerning their own interests deeply. If after submission and joining, their teams are gone and their status is the same as ordinary beastmen, akin to the once-defeated beastman tribes, they must think seriously about surrendering and joining.\n\"I don’t care who you are; if you want to submit, you must move entirely into the Dragon Nest Tribe and undergo military training transformation. On this point, there is no room for discussion.\"\nInside the City Hall, Vini looked down at a group of beastman envoys, his calm voice echoing like a mountain in every beastman’s heart, causing those around to feel a chill.\nClearly just a kobold, yet he exudes such domineering pressure...\nThe beastman envoys’ thoughts flickered, momentarily plunging the scene into an awkward silence.\nIndeed, Vini had the capital to be so exalted. The system within the Dragon Nest Tribe differed entirely from other beastman tribes. Successfully reclaiming land allowed the tribe to be untethered from the forest’s food output, obtaining sufficient food from the fields to support the Dragon Nest Tribe’s rapid development and expansion. Therefore, once the Dragon Nest Tribe stabilized and absorbed the Blood Claw Tribe’s captured beastmen, as Austin awoke, a new round of sweeping was inevitably going to occur.\nWith the Dragon Nest Tribe’s current scale and power, within a hundred miles, no force could rival it. Whether these tribes surrendered or joined made little difference, as the ultimate result would be the same: complete absorption and integration into the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nFor this reason, Vini’s tone brimmed with firmness, displaying little concern for these beastman tribes that would soon submit. Whether they joined or not made no difference.\nBefore long, these beastman envoys who came to surrender all left the Dragon Nest Tribe one after another.\nWatching the distant figures of those beastman envoys, Vini revealed a cold smile. After putting forth conditions, only a few tribes understood the overwhelming power and decided to unconditionally join the Dragon Nest Tribe, returning home to bring people to move into the tribe.\nHowever, more held onto a glimmer of hope, hoping for some future change, enduring with a \"one day at a time\" mentality.\n\"What fools, but it’s okay, let them jump around for a few more days.\"\nAfter defeating the Blood Claw Tribe Branch, the Dragon Nest Tribe became the undisputed overlord-level power in the nearby area. Given the Dragon Nest Tribe’s uniqueness, a sweeping war was destined to launch soon, and waiting a while was not difficult to accept.\nThe submission of those scattered small and medium beastman tribes near the Dragon Nest Tribe was ultimately just a minor episode during Austin’s slumber and did not stir much of a wave.\nHowever, those beastman tribes that had not decided to relinquish their power and join the Dragon Nest Tribe sensed the looming threat akin to a stormy cold winter.",

      "content": "Chapter 119: Chapter 117 Giant Beast\nAs the cold winter approached, the entire Kawa Great Forest was engulfed in an undercurrent of tension, as the war of blood and fire once again sounded the horn at the Bloody Border. The Beastman armies, lacking sufficient food to survive the winter, surged from all directions to invade the Human World’s civilized lands.\nIt was a grand battle for survival, with countless lives lost each year along that narrow and wide strip. However, none of this had much to do with the Dragon Nest Tribe in the center of the Kawa Great Forest.\nCrossing the vast sea of trees, due to the scarcity of food, the further south one went, the fewer traces of Beastmen there were, and the more potent the hidden dangers became.\nUnlike the Beastmen at the Bloody Border who could plunder enough supplies from the Human World, the Beastman Tribes further south had no choice but to aim their long spears at their own kind.\nNear the interior of the Kawa Forest, sporadic fires of war also spread between tribes. In this desperate world, food was always insufficient. To survive the harsh cold winter, unprepared Beastman Tribes had no alternative but to take up arms and attack other tribes in raids.\nThe law of the jungle, unveiled starkly in this final moment.\nMeanwhile, the great migration began. Some tribes, when strong enough, started pruning the old, weak, sick, and even some of the young and strong were driven away, increasing the number of wandering Beastmen in the Kawa Great Forest.\nAnd for some top-notch Hunters, this was an extremely rare feast!\nWham!!!\nA torrent roared in the air, with vast swathes of trees being flattened by the gale, a shadow blotting out the sky appeared above.\nGazing at the terrifying giant figure, with its menacing teeth dripping dreadful acid, drooling, the Beastman team in the forest was instantly filled with terror, scattering like headless flies.\nGah!!!\nThe Giant Beast let out a strange cry, with a visible sound wave sweeping through the air. The wandering Beastmen, who had barely gathered for rest in the forest, all lamented their parents had not given them a couple more legs, scrambling away in all directions in panic.\nBut no matter how fast these wandering Beastmen ran, where could they escape to? The Giant Beast stretched its head, pecking the running Beastmen one by one like a rooster pecking rice, splattering crimson blood across the sky, severed limbs raining down to the ground, creating a gruesome carnage amidst the collapsing forest.\nOne wandering Beastman after another perished, and at the front, the Boarman Dom, hearing the hopeless screams behind, felt his legs go weak, but his survival instinct urged his bulky body into a desperate sprint for life.\nThis was the perilous Kawa Great Forest, where stopping to rest at any random spot could lead to an unavoidable disaster from above.\nHaving been cast out for eating too much and lacking special Skills, the Boarman Dom joined a group of wandering Beastmen, collectively sourcing enough food from the forest.\nHowever, everyone in the group knew such days with plentiful food would not last long.\nThe cold winter was coming soon; by then, the whole forest would turn into a white desert of death. Without a tribal alliance or ample food storage, they would only have a few more days of jumping around.\nTo find a tribe that could take them in, the temporarily united wandering Beastman team decided to head north, hoping to join the powerful Beastman Tribes at the Bloody Border, securing strong protection to barely endure the cold winter.\nYet, none had expected that, while casually resting at a spot, they would suffer such calamity from above!\n\"It’s over, it’s all over!!!\"\nA fierce wind blasted overhead, accompanied by an all-encompassing shadow, a great disaster and dread engulfed their hearts. The Boarman Dom could clearly feel the enormous beast behind had locked onto him!\nStumbling underfoot, the Boarman Dom fell to the ground, turning around in fright to see the blood-salivating jaws of the Giant Beast rushing at him, about to swallow him whole.\nDespair instantly consumed the Boarman Dom’s entire being.\nAt this very moment,\nWhoosh!!!\nA streak of light pierced through the sky, penetrating the Giant Beast’s mouth with fearsome Power, the force even skewing the Beast’s head, causing it to sink its teeth into a giant tree, crushing the trunk into fragments.\nThe Boarman Dom widened his eyes, his face still stricken with terror.\nGah!!!\nMeanwhile, the Giant Beast let out a strange cry, angrily turning its head towards the source of the arrow.\nSeen not far beyond the forest, a Dark Elf frowned slightly, slowly retracting his longbow. Behind him stood a well-organized team of Beastmen, facing the moving-mountain-like Giant Beast. Their eyes filled with tension, but not a flicker of fear.\n\"Gah!!!\"\nThe Giant Beast roared loudly, abandoning the Boarman Dom, flapping its ugly meat wings, charging fiercely at the Dark Elf and the team behind him. The moving mountain of flesh surged forward like rolling ocean waves, toppling trees to both sides, stirring up huge clouds of dust, its force was immensely terrifying!\n\"Everyone, prepare for battle!\"\nThe Dark Elf’s expression was grave. The previous policy of Governor Vini was to consolidate forces and avoid provoking these powerful Giant Beasts, but with time, the Giant Beast’s path was getting too close to the Dragon Nest Tribe, so they could only strangle the threat in its Cradle.\nThis time, he brought out more than half of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s Beastman Transcendents, the rest were highly mobile Centaur Ranger cavalry. With the Transcendents taking turns confronting in the front, and the Centaur Rangers encircling and shooting, they might slay the Giant Beast at minimal cost.\n\"Plan One, forward!\"\nWith a wave of the Dark Elf’s hand, a team of extraordinarily strong Beastman Transcendents, noticeably taller than the other Beastmen, rushed out with massive Stone Shields, charging at the Giant Beast.\nAt the same time, the Centaur cavalry behind split to both wings, swiftly galloping around the Giant Beast, drawing bows and nocking arrows. Instantly, arrows rained down like a storm, enveloping the Giant Beast.\nMeanwhile, the Dark Elf silently pulled his longbow, the arrow shimmering faintly with Fighting Qi light, the arrow flew swift as lightning, piercing the right leg of the charging Giant Beast.\nSuddenly, the Giant Beast stumbled down like an out-of-control speeding truck, crashing down, shattering trees and ground alike into debris.\nConcurrently, the Beastman Transcendents bearing huge Stone Shields had already reached the front!",

      "content": "Chapter 120: Chapter 118: The Stray Beastman’s Choice\nGa!!!\nRolling clouds of dust surged into the sky, large swathes of trees were crushed down, accompanied by a painful shriek, the giant beast with scars all over its body collapsed with a boom upon the ground, breathing its last breaths.\n\"Whew, it’s finally dead!\"\nThe sweat-drenched Dark Elf lowered the drawn bow and arrow, exhaled deeply, while the exhausted Beastmen surrounding him also relaxed, with many collapsing directly onto the ground.\nThis siege had exhausted them too much.\nThe giant beast’s strength had surpassed their imaginations.\nEven with nearly half of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s elite gathered here, quite a few Beastmen were crushed to death by the terrifying power of the giant beast during the encirclement, aside from the previous attack on the Blood Claw Tribe, this was the Dragon Nest Tribe’s second casualty during an expedition.\nBut fortunately, with the perseverance like water dripping through stone, they finally wore out and killed the giant beast in front of them.\n\"Everyone take a rest, then quickly pack up and head back, this is not a place to linger.\"\nAlthough it was rare for giant beasts to appear near the Dragon Nest Tribe, but with the cold winter’s arrival, giant beasts began to roam about, it’s possible for them to stray near here, the corpse of the beast in front of them is proof, and having the first one means there might be a second. In their current state, encountering another giant beast would be troublesome.\nThough utterly exhausted, the Beastmen understood the urgency of the situation, and thanks to their military training, they knew to follow orders, hence they quickly stood up, dragging their tired bodies and tied the giant beast’s corpse with ropes, pulling it towards the direction of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nDust rolled and dispersed into the sky.\nA long while passed, as Dom, the bewildered boarman sat on the ground still shaken.\n\"Complete, it’s over? I’m not dead?\"\nThe almost terrified Dom stood up frantically, checked himself hastily, and after realizing no parts were missing, breathed a sigh of relief, yet inside he felt more like he’d survived a catastrophe.\nAlmost, he almost died!\nFor the first time ever, Dom felt a surge of fear towards death.\nThe sky gradually dimmed, the remaining stray Beastmen seemed to notice the upheaval here, and gathered from outside.\nYet this time, the wandering team originally had fifty or sixty, now only twenty or thirty were left.\n\"What do we do next, where’s our next destination?\"\nThe disoriented wandering Beastmen gathered together, the day’s events left them all still shaken, confused about the future.\nThat horrible giant beast, along with the Beastmen army that easily slaughtered it, no matter which side, were forces they absolutely could not provoke.\nThinking of the dangers ahead, just like this, all the wandering Beastmen shivered, feeling as if the air grew colder.\n\"I’ve decided, maybe we should seek refuge with those people.\"\nSuddenly, a Beastman spoke up.\n\"Are they the powerful Beastman army that appeared today?\"\n\"That’s right, with such powerful strength, surely food won’t be too scarce, their immense strength must be able to shelter us through the coming cold winter season.\"\n\"But will they accept us?\"\n\"Who knows, but not trying feels unsatisfactory.\"\nThe wandering Beastmen gathered around the fire, discussing slowly, while the boarman Dom sat silently in a corner, many thoughts crossed his mind.\nBut undeniably, at this moment, he was indeed tempted. Unlike those scattered fleeing wandering Beastmen, Dom had witnessed the strength of Dragon Nest Tribe’s Beastmen firsthand.\nThe belief in the strength of the domineering, was the acknowledged law in this Barbaric Land. If they could join such a tribe, it would be immense fortune for them.\nWith the shelter of the strong, not only could they forego worries of safety, but the stronger the tribe, the less chance of food shortages, which was one reason why wandering Beastmen were eager to join strong tribes.\n\"But, do you know where that tribe is?\"\nJust then, another wandering Beastman asked.\n\"At that time we can ask the nearby tribes, surely they’ll know something, after all, a tribe strong enough to hunt giant beasts surely won’t have a small reputation.\"\n\"Alright, starting tomorrow let’s ask around one by one.\"\nAnxiously, the wandering Beastmen spent an uneasy night in the forest.\nWhen the sun rose the next day, the wandering Beastmen began searching for nearby tribes, inquiring about the powerful tribe and its situation.\nUnexpectedly, the inquiry directly shocked them.\nWithin a radius of several dozen miles, the only tribe capable of hunting giant beasts was the Dragon Nest Tribe on the distant cliff, and the entire Dragon Nest Tribe’s size surprisingly surpassed two thousand, a medium-large tribe with quite a few elite Extraordinary Beastmen within.\nAnd from the vague words of these Beastmen, they learned the Lord of the Dragon Nest Tribe was even more terrifying, rumored to have once roared and shattered the sky and earth, causing half a mountainside to collapse, easily defeating and annexing a mid-level medium tribe of a thousand, truly fearsome beyond comparison.\nThough the Beastmen of these tribes tried hard to portray Dragon Nest Tribe as a cruel demon, it couldn’t deter these wandering Beastmen’s longing hearts, as they set off towards Dragon Nest Tribe after learning detailed information.\nIf they could submit and enter the Dragon Nest Tribe, they’d safely endure the cold winter season, under the care of such strong figures, what dangers could there be within the entire tribe? And once the saying spread of Dragon Nest Tribe recruiting wandering Beastmen through smoke signals, these wandering Beastmen hoped, like their predecessors, to have a chance to join the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nWith the growing reputation of Dragon Nest Tribe, more Beastmen sought to join, and those Beastmen tribes within the surrounding region didn’t hinder the wandering Beastmen’s journey towards Dragon Nest Tribe, instead subtly feeling joyous.\nSuch a large group of wandering Beastmen consumed massively daily, if they could just overpopulate Dragon Nest Tribe until it burst, that would’ve been wonderful.\nOf course, that was merely wishful thinking.\nFollowing Dragon Nest Tribe’s growing fame, the wandering Beastmen continuously came from afar, wanting to join the tribe, bringing only slight trouble compared to the immense gains.",

      "content": "Chapter 121: Chapter 119 Mercenary\nPfft!\nWithin the dense forest, an arrow swiftly cut through the air like lightning, piercing straight through the Kobold fleeing in a panic in the distance.\nThe ragged Kobold stared incredulously at the blood-stained arrow protruding from its chest, finally collapsing to the ground with a thud.\n\"This damned place, it’s full of these things.\"\nNearby, there came a rustling sound, as two figures approached, reaching out to retrieve the arrow stuck in the Kobold’s back.\n\"Come on, we’re better off now. If we were crossing the Bloody Border a few days ago, we’d have faced more Beastmen.\"\nSunlight filtered through the dense canopy, illuminating the figures—a pair of humans!\nThese two were dressed in somewhat worn leather armor, covered in dust, as if they’d been traveling for a long time. One, tall and thin, held a bow and arrow, while the other, more robust, carried a war axe, both displaying a fierce demeanor, appearing to be mercenaries.\n\"There shouldn’t be any Beastmen left, we’ve already delved deep in, their traces are much sparser.\"\nThe tall, thin man with the bow and arrow surveyed the surroundings uncertainly.\n\"We’ve done two rounds of patrol, they should be gone. This isn’t the border, it can’t gather as many Beastmen as over there.\"\n\"It’s really troublesome. If it weren’t for the gold coins, no way anyone would take such a task.\"\n\"Haha, it’s fine. Young Master Edward said we’re almost there. Soon, we’ll be out of this damned place. How about I treat you to some merriment at the tavern once we’re out?\"\nThe two conversed as they kept an eye on their surroundings, gradually retreating into a hidden cavern.\nInside the cavern, a young man with handsome blond features sat by the campfire, perusing a few worn-out notes by its dim light.\nThis man was named Edward, a noble Knight, though his identity was extremely mysterious. According to these mercenaries, he likely hailed from nobility; no ordinary knight would casually wear such expensive magic armor or easily spend a large sum of gold coins to hire the best mercenaries at the border.\nAlong the journey, his humorous demeanor and extensive knowledge further confirmed their suspicions, leading them to respectfully refer to him as Young Master Edward.\nThe reason this group was here was due to a commission a month ago, protecting him as he ventured deep into the Kawa Great Forest, seemingly in search of some ruins.\nRegular mercenaries didn’t know much about the specifics, but given that Edward was willing to pay so much and risk entering the depths of Kawa Great Forest, it didn’t seem like a simple matter.\n\"Edward, how’s it going?\"\nAt this moment, a bald and powerful middle-aged man walked in from outside the cavern, sharp eyes hidden beneath thick brows, asking in a deep voice.\nValen, a renowned captain of the Black Bear Mercenary Corps in Bloody Border City, had a deeper relationship with Edward than regular members. It was this connection that led Edward to enlist Valen’s help for this journey into Kawa Great Forest.\nThough the members weren’t entirely aware, everyone knew that Captain Valen and Edward had a deep private connection, which was why Valen would address Edward directly by name rather than referring to him as Young Master Edward like others.\n\"According to the Great Mage’s notes, we should almost be at the destination now. Valen, if we truly find that place, I owe you a huge favor.\"\nEdward looked at Valen, speaking earnestly.\nValen, with his imposing build, leaned closer, patting Edward on the shoulder:\n\"What’s there to owe between us? Without you back then, I’d have died in the barren wilderness, taken by wild dogs. Besides, you’re paying handsomely for this trip, just regular employment.\"\n\"Regardless, thank you all. If I can truly find what the Great Mage left behind, it would be crucial for my future path.\"\n\"Don’t be too optimistic yet. Although you say we’re near the destination, this area isn’t exactly safe.\"\nThe bald, burly Valen poured a cold bucket of reality over Edward, reminding him with a serious tone.\n\"What do you mean?\"\nPicking up on the heavy tone in Mercenary Captain Valen’s voice, Edward quickly asked.\n\"Nearby, there’s a very powerful tribe roaming, and their leader is a Blue Dragon.\"\nEvery time they approached a location, they would capture some Beastmen to inquire about nearby forces or dangerous territories, to avoid those hard-to-resist dangers and preserve the team’s strength.\n\"An adult Giant Dragon? That’s troublesome, let’s hope the destination isn’t too close....\"\nUpon hearing this, Edward furrowed his brows, pondering in a low voice.\nMany wild Beastmen liked Toby, serving under powerful creatures, among them Giant Dragons being one of the favorites. If a Clan Tribe was strong, it meant that as their leader, the dragon’s power was also formidable.\nAnd for an adult Giant Dragon, their power was above Legendary.\nThough their mercenary team was quite capable, facing a Legendary would mean no chance of survival.\n\"No, it’s not an adult Giant Dragon. It’s said to be a Blue Young Dragon, no older than ten years, but the clan under its command already numbers over 2,500 Beastmen, including many Beastman Transcendents, extremely powerful.\"\nSeeing Edward’s reaction, Valen knew he misunderstood and explained.\n\"A Blue Young Dragon?\"\nThis clearly surprised Edward, showing astonishment.\nA Blue Young Dragon, not even ten years old, had managed to gather a tribe exceeding 2,500 members?\nNot to mention that most Giant Dragon Race members before the age of ten would typically grow in their parents’ nest through deep slumber, yet how did such a young Dragon gather such formidable forces?\nMany adult dragons typically only had a few Dragon Vein Beastmen and two to three thousand ordinary Beastmen under their command!\nFor some reason, Edward felt an ominous premonition that this dragon might be the greatest obstacle in his journey.\n\"Indeed, just a Blue Young Dragon, but the clan under its command is the most dominant force in this region.\"\nRecalling the information gleaned from the Beastmen’s mouths, Mercenary Captain Valen couldn’t help but furrow his brows, even with their extensive background, bewildered by this occurrence.",

      "content": "Chapter 122: Chapter 120 Threat\nIt is said that the young dragon appeared in the nearby area in recent years, and at first, some beastmen found its traces while hunting and gathering.\nHowever, the terrain here is remote, and the magic resources are scarce, so powerful magical creatures rarely appear. The beastman tribes living nearby are just ordinary beastmen. No matter how you look at it, a young dragon is an extraordinary creature, and thus these beastmen didn’t entertain any delusions of slaying a dragon. Anyway, the dragon doesn’t really eat beastmen, so in such a vast area, just avoiding it when encountering it was enough.\nBut two years ago, something inexplicable happened. The blue young dragon suddenly grew rapidly, its body expanded significantly, its power increased dramatically, and it gathered a group of beastman clans under its command. Leading its army, it began to wage continuous wars outside, winning every battle, and capturing one beastman tribe after another. The blue dragon’s influence expanded rapidly, its numbers quickly exceeded a thousand, becoming the most powerful overlord of the nearby region.\nThis is simply unbelievable because any beastman living nearby knows that this barren area has never seen a medium to large tribe capable of gathering over a thousand people because such a barren land simply cannot support so many beastmen for survival.\nIn the hunting civilization stage, relying on the inefficient method of hunting and gathering to obtain food from the forest could never support the consumption of large tribal groups. They could only split into small tribes scattered across the vast area, obtaining enough food for survival from the extensive forest.\nBut this blue young dragon made it happen. In just a year or two, it gathered a large tribe of over 2,500 people. Judging by the fearful expressions of those beastmen, it’s clear that the beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe are not to be trifled with.\n\"You mean to say that a blue young dragon managed, in just two years, to build an extremely powerful Dragon Nest Tribe with over 2,500 people from nothing and dominate the nearby area in a short time? How is that possible!\"\nEven Edward was dumbfounded upon hearing the information Valen extracted from the wild beastmen.\nThis is absolutely impossible!\nDiving deep into the Kawa Great Forest for months, Edward has become well-attuned to the current conditions of these beastmen living here. He felt confident that even the wisest and mightiest king or duke from the human world couldn’t achieve this.\n\"Or perhaps there’s some powerful support behind the blue young dragon?\"\nEdward spoke with a grave expression.\nYoung dragons are typically looked after by adult giant dragon parents. Perhaps what this young dragon is doing is merely playful antics supported by its dragon parents?\nThere might be such a possibility. However, even for adult dragon parents, the resources required to support their playful offspring to such an extent would likely be a huge number. The daily food consumption for over 2,500 people would not be an easy task for even adult giant dragons to resolve.\n\"No, according to the beastmen, there has never been a trace of giant dragons in the vicinity. They did not sense the mighty dragon aura of an adult giant dragon when they went to investigate. If I’m not mistaken, it should be an orphan dragon.\"\nOnce a giant dragon reaches adulthood, it becomes legendary. Even if it doesn’t unleash its power, the dragon aura it emits in normal activities can strike fear into ordinary beings. However, the beastmen living in this nearby area have never felt that overwhelming, terrifying dragon aura that can be sensed from miles away.\nAll signs indicate that the blue young dragon is an orphan dragon without parental care.\nAnd this only makes everyone feel an even greater sense of absurdity.\n\"If that’s really the case, Brother Valen, we might be facing big trouble.\"\nAfter a long silence, Edward spoke in a heavy tone.\n\"It should be alright. As long as we carefully avoid them, that Great Mage’s ruins might not even fall within the Dragon Nest Tribe’s territory.\"\nValen hurriedly replied to comfort him.\n\"No, that’s not what I mean. Compared to this, the Great Mage’s ruins are nothing...\"\nEdward lowered his head, his golden curls casting shadows over his handsome face, and he murmured to himself in a voice only he could hear.\nUnlike Valen, who came from poverty, Edward clearly understood more about what all this means for the Kawa Great Forest and human civilization’s world.\n\"Brother Valen, tomorrow let’s go to the blue young dragon’s tribe. There are some very important things I need to confirm.\"\nAfter a long silence, Edward finally looked up and said to Valen, who was sitting nearby with a puzzled expression.\n\"Alright then.\"\nMercenary Captain Valen originally didn’t want to bother with these matters, but seeing Edward’s determined gaze, Valen, knowing his character, hesitated and then agreed.\nHe then turned and left, evidently going outside to discuss this decision with the team members.\nEdward silently sat on a rock, his pupils reflecting the golden firelight, appearing especially profound.\n\"If this is really the case, then it’s troublesome. I hope I’m just overthinking it...\"\nEven though he hadn’t met it yet, a baseless premonition suddenly arose in Edward’s heart. That blue young dragon might not only be the biggest obstacle on this journey but could also very likely be the greatest enemy he will face in the future...\n....\nInside the Dragon Nest Tribe,\nWith the cold winter approaching step by step, the Dragon Nest Beastmen were in their final busy stage. Through overloaded production, a large number of bricks were fired, and with the orderly cooperation of teams of beastmen, neatly designed houses rose from the ground and continued to spread outward.\nHundreds of beastmen, united in cooperation, were building houses, but there wasn’t a hint of chaos — everything was orderly and organized.\nAt the same time, teams of spear-wielding beastmen marched in order from the Dragon Nest Tribe’s gate, heading to the large training field outside. They lined up in squares, training uniformly, with their voices rising to the sky and movements perfectly synchronized.\nIn the more distant fields, civilian beastmen were turning over plots one by one, and another team of beastmen was loading them into baskets and carrying them back toward the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nOn the edges of the fields, many beastman women were processing the harvested kudzu vines, removing the leaves, sorting them out, rolling them into bundles, and taking them back to the tribe to weave into ropes. Even the fallen leaves were not wasted; they were gathered and stored as fodder for buffalo livestock over the winter.\nFrom a height, one could see a large number of reclaimed fields radiating outward with the Dragon Nest Tribe at the center, as beastmen, either building houses, training, or harvesting fields, engaged in energetic activity, filled with vibrant life.",

      "content": "Chapter 123: Chapter 121 Differences\n\"Damn it, how is this possible!\"\nA few days later, in a dense forest far from the Dragon Nest Tribe, a team of mercenaries hid among the foliage, their eyes peering through the thick leaves to see the slowly forming \"small city\" in the distance.\nYes, a small city!\nThis vast and orderly cluster of buildings could be called a city even by the standards of the Human World.\nThis is simply unbelievable!\nIn such a barbaric zone, in a place untouched by civilization, the fact that a city had been built by beastmen was shocking to them.\nWhat shocked them even more was the beastmen training on the open space outside the small city. Each held a long spear, standing uniformly on the open ground. Both their footsteps and movements were coordinated, well-trained, and their aura was clearly that of seasoned veteran warriors, not merely ornamental displays.\nEven from afar, there was an aura of stalwart bravery emanating forth, comparable to the elite troops of some large duchies in the Human World, and perhaps even more disciplined.\n\"Is this the Clan Tribe of that Blue Young Dragon? If everything here was orchestrated by that Blue Young Dragon, then we’re in trouble!\"\nMercenary Captain Valen stared intently at the lines of beastmen filing out, speaking gravely.\nHaving experienced countless battles, they could naturally see the prowess of these beastmen armies—their organized warfare, stringent collaboration, and the sight of spear formations moving flawlessly at the sound of orders. Mercenary Captain Valen imagined if they were the opponents; without unleashing a powerful Fighting Qi to crushingly break through this tight formation, it would be impossible.\nHowever, according to the intelligence they had, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe’s beastman population exceeded two thousand five hundred. Even dragging it out could overwhelm them, not to mention the presence of numerous powerful extraordinary beastmen within the tribe, whose cooperation made them even more formidable.\nThis Dragon Nest Tribe was beyond their capacity to handle.\nJust one look and all the members of the Black Bear Mercenaries made the same judgment.\n\"Indeed, it’s a big trouble, a huge trouble at that.\"\nBeside him, Edward peered intently at the city being built bit by bit through the gaps in the leaves, his gaze profound as he spoke.\nCompared to the mercenaries, Edward, who had seen more, saw even more.\nAs they passed by, he saw vast expanses of cultivated farmland, the beastman militia working in harmony, and large harvests of kudzu root being gathered at the field’s edge.\nAll of this seemed to show him a power unlike any other, even an unprecedented empire slowly rising above the Barbaric Zone in the Kawa Great Forest, engulfing everything.\nAnd when that time comes, if it truly establishes such an empire encompassing the entire Wilderness, then the Civilized Continent would be in trouble.\n\"Let’s go, Edward. Before they find us, let’s detour around them.\"\nMercenary Captain Valen came over, his eyes looking deeply at the faraway, slowly rising beastman tribe, speaking to Edward.\nFrom his many years of rich experience, just the strength showcased outside this tribe would make taking it down impossible without a thousand well-equipped elite regular soldiers, not to mention the depths of that mysterious Blue Young Dragon. Seeking fortune and avoiding calamity is an instinct for mercenaries.\n\"No, Brother Valen, I hope you’ll help me overthrow them. If we can’t crush this tribe and slaughter that dragon, it will definitely become a big problem in the future!\"\nEdward remained where he was, instead earnestly looking at Mercenary Captain Valen as he spoke.\n\"Are you crazy!\"\nMercenary Captain Valen’s eyes widened in disbelief as he looked at Edward.\nTo Valen, for their team of only about ten mercenaries to attack a beastman tribe of over two thousand, well-trained and possessing the Dragon Nest Tribe with beastman transcendents, seemed like sheer madness!\n\"No, I’m not crazy, Brother Valen, listen to me.\"\nEdward measured his tone, looking gravely at Mercenary Captain Valen’s eyes:\n\"Brother Valen, throughout the journey, you’ve seen many beastman tribes situated in this barbaric land. When we crossed the Bloody Border, we even closely scouted a large beastman tribe with over ten thousand beastmen. Think carefully, what difference is there between the beastman tribes we’ve seen on this journey and this Dragon Nest Tribe?\"\n\"Filthy, hungry, bloodthirsty, mad, desperate... Every day, skeletal beastmen die in the alleyways and are dragged out and piled up outside in heaps, with flies buzzing over them and maggots crawling from rotting eyeballs. In the distance, wild dogs bark with joy, carrying away decayed heads into the forest... This is land filled with despair and chaos. No matter how big the beastman tribe, no matter how many beastmen gather, I never believed they could pose any threat to the northern countries.\"\n\"But now, look, a city cleaner than the royal capital, an army more well-trained than the kingdom’s elite, a roar louder than the temple’s divine followers... In less than two years, from nothing, such a formidable tribal settlement was established. If given two more years, three years, or even ten or twenty years? Remember, that’s a dragon! A Giant Dragon with a lifespan of hundreds or thousands of years! If we don’t stop them now, in the future, that alien dragon is bound to command its clan to dominate the entire Kawa Great Forest, establishing an unprecedented beastman empire, and then the Human World would be in trouble!\"\nEdward spoke more passionately, as if seeing the Border Great Wall, built over a thousand years by humans, being breached, several duchies near the Kawa Great Forest border becoming a playground for beastmen, hundreds of thousands of humans dying under beastman weapons, and even more displaced.\n\"What does it have to do with us? Edward, I’m just a small mercenary captain. I have to be responsible for my team members. I can’t send them on a suicide mission!\"\nMercenary Captain Valen patted Edward’s shoulder heavily, his calm voice brimming with firmness.\nEdward looked around, but all the mercenaries avoided his gaze instinctively. Without needing words, he understood their choice.\nIndeed, no one is willing to risk their life for a thankless task.\nEven if the future turns out as Edward said, what does it matter? Whether or not these mercenaries who live by the blade survive that long is still uncertain.\nCould it be that they really will ignore the rise of this Dragon Nest Tribe before them?\nFor a moment, Edward was filled with despair.",

      "content": "Chapter 124: Chapter 122: Secret Plot\nNo, there must be a chance!\nEdward’s thoughts raced as he tried to find a way to break the deadlock. As a knight, he couldn’t just sit by and watch the northern border face the rise of the Beastman Empire. He had to do something.\n\"Edward...\"\nMercenary Captain Valen patted him on the shoulder, shook his head, and turned away in silence.\nThe rest of the mercenaries also prepared to leave. Each person here was a veteran mercenary who had survived many battles. No one was willing to undertake a mission that meant certain death.\nWhat did the future disasters on the border have to do with them? Whether they could live to see that day was still unknown. Although minstrel songs often told tales of certain unnamed mercenary groups overcoming countless obstacles to ultimately thwart the evil dragon’s plot, slay it, and become a legendary hero team in the entire Prime Material Plane.\nBut those stories were really just for children. Reality was not a novel; there were always some enemies that couldn’t be defeated by mere hot-blooded bravery.\n\"But are you really satisfied with this? Such a great opportunity is right in front of you; what does some danger matter?\"\nAs the mercenaries prepared to leave, Edward suddenly spoke up.\n\"A young dragon, an orphan dragon without the protection of an adult giant dragon. Finding a surviving orphan dragon in the wild is hundreds of times more difficult than finding an adult giant dragon. If you slay this young dragon, even if it’s just a young dragon, you will become legends, dragon slayer warriors spoken of by minstrels!\"\n\"Money, fame, status, and even power are within reach! Once you slay that young dragon, you could even gain rewards from kings upon your return, becoming noble and your descendants will take pride in your deeds. Are you really going to give up such a good opportunity?\"\n\"Even if there are more than two thousand beastmen tribes, so what? They’re just mere beastmen!\"\nGradually, Edward’s voice became filled with irresistible temptation.\nIn fact, it was true. Even slaying a young dragon made one a legendary dragon slayer warrior. That title was enough to make them honored guests in any duchy, forever passing down their name in family history.\nMoreover, after slaying a dragon, if they bathed in dragon blood, their power and level of life would experience a leap.\nAs Edward’s words fell, the mercenaries suddenly hesitated in their footsteps.\n\"Edward, don’t talk nonsense. These are not enemies we can handle!\"\nMercenary Captain Valen’s face looked somewhat distressed. Although he also felt tempted, he ultimately suppressed the thrill in his heart.\nHe was well aware that with their strength, dealing with such a medium-sized beastman tribe was simply courting death, not to mention that the blue young dragon had not shown up till now.\n\"No, Brother Valen, how could I send you to your death in vain? I already have a plan to deal with them. As long as you help me, we can surely win!\" Edward hurriedly said, his tone serious.\n\"Everyone, remember the storm tiger we encountered nearby earlier? As long as we provoke that beast and lure it over, those mindless creatures will surely go mad and attack the Dragon Nest Tribe. Once they’re both heavily damaged, we can catch them off guard, wipe out the entire tribe, and finally slay that dragon.\"\nHearing this, the mercenaries were somewhat moved.\nWhile exploring, they passed by remnants of a beastman tribe that had been attacked. Near it, they found traces of a storm tiger. Judging by the powerful magic power aura, it had at least grown to tier six, with combat strength reaching at least the silver supreme level.\nAt that time, they didn’t disturb the storm tiger, only quietly passing by. Now, under Edward’s plan, they finally remembered that terrifying and powerful magic beast.\n\"At the time, we were only afraid that the noise of the battle would be too great, so we didn’t hunt the storm tiger. Just one storm tiger isn’t enough for this Dragon Nest Tribe to be severely damaged.\"\nValen shook his head, but his flickering eyes revealed his growing heart’s desire.\nThe surrounding mercenaries also seemed eager to try.\n\"One storm tiger isn’t enough, but what about adding several giant beasts? Don’t forget, it’s the season when giant beasts roam for hunting, and we also discovered many traces of giant beasts nearby on our way here. If we lure them too, we’ll surely succeed!\"\nEdward spoke firmly, filled with confidence in this plan.\nMeanwhile, he looked around at the mercenaries, seeing the uncontrollable ambition burning deep in their eyes. Edward knew in his heart that everything was settled!\n...\nSwish!\nThe dense bushes were parted as a team of fierce and well-trained beastmen emerged from the grass.\nThis was a patrol team,\nA few days ago, traces of a giant beast had been spotted near the Dragon Nest Tribe. To guard against these terrifying predators, Quik specifically set up several patrol teams to monitor the area around the tribe.\nHowever, during the midday roll call, they found a patrol team missing and still hadn’t returned after lunch.\nThe beastmen, modified through military training, were now no less disciplined than Austin’s previous life army, making it impossible for them to be absent without reason. Therefore, squad after squad of beastmen units were dispatched for patrol.\n\"Look, what’s that over there?!\"\nA beastman shouted, and all the beastmen looked in the direction indicated.\nThe leading beastman captain parted the grass with a few strides to reveal the bodies of their companions, hidden within.\n\"Damn it!\"\nThe beastman captain cursed, staring at the once-companions now turned into corpses, his long spear thrust forcefully into the ground.\nA patrol team had been silently killed not far from the Dragon Nest Tribe, causing a massive disturbance within the entire tribe. The smooth wounds on the corpses indicated the enemy’s weapons were exceptionally sharp, beyond what ordinary stone tools or bone implements could cause.\nSome powerful and unknown enemy was roaming nearby!\nThe loss of this beastman patrol team immediately raised the Dragon Nest Tribe to the highest alert. Everyone was in wartime status, the beastman militia halting production. Be it young or old, male or female, all took up long spears ready to fight. Well-trained units marched out of the tribe’s gate in columns, starting a unified sweeping search outside the Dragon Nest Tribe.",

      "content": "Chapter 125: Chapter 123 Search\nEdward and his companions naturally did not expect that the orc patrol team they casually killed on the road would become their greatest vulnerability.\nIndeed, even among human nations, a noble doesn’t know how many peasants are beneath him, let alone these lowly and ugly beastman tribes. In some large tribes, members often go hunting and are bitten by poisonous snakes, or are killed by prey, or encounter unknown dangers and never return.\nFor those great tribes, maintaining core strength is enough, since new beastmen join every day and others die as well. Who would care if some beastmen have encountered enemies and been killed?\nWan Lun and others led their team across the Kawa Great Forest, entering the central territory without any trouble, precisely because of this.\nBut how could they have known that the Dragon Nest Tribe’s system was completely different from other beastman tribes? This became their greatest mistake.\nOne by one, orc armies poured out of the Dragon Nest Tribe, like an unstoppable steel flood, with terrifying and fearsome momentum in their orderly steps, as if everything in front would be destroyed under the impact of this torrent.\nAt the forefront of the team, Rodney led the way, with the orc隊長s bristling with long spears silently following behind.\nAs one of the earliest orcs to undergo the Dragon Vein Transformation, and an early elder who joined when the Dragon Nest Tribe was weak, Rodney has now become one of the top figures in the Dragon Nest Tribe, commanding the orc infantry corps within the three major armies.\nBack then, Rodney led remnant forces to attack the Dragon Nest Tribe, which only had seven kobolds. Ultimately, they were counterattacked by the blood-hardened kobolds and were defeated and captured, thus beginning the process of submitting under Austin’s banner.\nAs an orc who joined relatively early, he personally experienced Austin leading the beastmen to fish by cutting through ice, encircle and slay the Blood Wolves, open up wastelands, and battle in all directions, a phase of iron-blooded rise. In these events, the Dragon Nest Tribe grew from a small gathering of a few cats in a yard to the undisputed overlord of the nearby region.\nHe almost watched the rise of the Dragon Nest Tribe from nothing with his own eyes.\nA year ago, Rodney had led remnant forces in a desperate escape, fearing the many hidden dangers of the forest, living from hand to mouth, with no guarantee of the next day.\nAnd now, a year later, he leads hundreds of elite beastmen, with more than ten or twenty extraordinary orc captains under his command, whose strength is enough to challenge the giant beasts roaming the forest.\nAll this was successfully achieved under the leadership of His Highness Austin.\nIn daily life, Rodney already feels an immense admiration for the great His Highness Austin, willing to devote his life to fighting for the grand cause of His Highness.\nNow, Quik, the fox-faced man from the same tribe has received significant responsibilities from His Highness Austin, becoming an important figure in the Dragon Nest Tribe, while Rodney has also become the leader of one of the three major corps.\nBut that is not enough. With the increasing popularity of the Breathing Technique and the growing number of transformed extraordinary orcs, the pressure he faces from the many excellent subordinates grows.\nRodney set a small goal for himself, like becoming the first warrior of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAnd now, the emergence of those hidden unknown enemies in the darkness is the perfect opportunity!\n\"Everyone, move out!\"\nRows of troops set out with a roar, divided into four streams, searching in all directions.\nJudging by the wounds on that orc patrol, the enemy’s strength is likely formidable. The top ranks of the Dragon Nest Tribe gather, guessing that it might be retaliatory action from the headquarters of the Blood Claw Tribe.\nTo prevent being defeated one by one, the search parties are divided into four, heading east, south, west, and north, while maintaining considerable cavalry squads between each group for communication.\nMeanwhile, during this search, they are not allowed to exceed a ten-mile radius from the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAfter sweeping through once, if no trace of the enemy is found, all orc armies will return and defend the tribe, waiting for His Highness Austin to awaken.\nThe reaction of the Dragon Nest Tribe is not excessive, considering the strength of the Blood Claw Tribe headquarters, being cautious is not unwarranted.\n.....\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\nIn a certain dense forest, massive ancient trees tower up high, an endless sea of forests undulating ceaselessly.\nNot far away, a giant beast as colossal as a mountain walked through the forest, each step left an imprint on the earth as if causing earthquakes, making the ground tremble, while the surrounding giant ancient trees fell like wheat in its path, breaking and shattering.\nThe beast resembled an elephant, but it was ten times larger than a normal one, making the whole world tremble with each step.\nRoar!!!\nThe giant beast raised its head and howled, its long trunk lifted high, instantly turning its roar into a visible tsunami, sweeping in all directions. The enormous sound stirred the air like rushing tides, causing the surrounding trees to bow and scrape under it.\n\"Every time I see such giant beast creatures, I feel an awe that comes from the heart.\"\nIn the distance, between forests, several figures stood on the branch of a giant ancient tree, looking at the mountain-like giant beast, sighing as they spoke.\n\"Indeed, only the vast and endless Barbaric Land like the Kawa Great Forest can harbor such massive beings. These creatures are among the largest in the world; luckily they don’t exist in the human civilized world, or dealing with them would require at least several hundred elite troops or Silver and Gold level adventurers to kill them.\"\n\"This is already good. We’ve searched so far and found just one or two. It’s said in this vast wilderness, some magic power-rich places harbor very large groups of giant beasts. In those areas, even eighth or ninth-level magic beasts tread cautiously. No wonder that Blue Young Dragon chose to nest here; the position is indeed good, even signs of giant beasts are rare.\"\n\"Let’s start; the appointed time is almost here. Let’s first lure this giant beast over. Hopefully, others have found similar prey. If we can draw five such giant beasts to the Dragon Nest Tribe and let them hurt each other, stepping in to clean up the aftermath, then achieving the feat of dragon slaying might not be as challenging as it seems.\"\nThe few exchanged glances, then swooped down with a whiz, disappearing into the forest.",

      "content": "Chapter 126: Chapter 124 Intense Battle\nRumble!!!\nAmidst the earth-shaking roar, towering trees collapsed one by one, sending dust swirling into the sky.\nWithin the billowing dust, the frenzied giant beast, eyes bloodshot, like a runaway heavy truck, charged madly toward the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"All Dragon Vein Attendants, get up front and block them for me!\"\nAt the front of the tribe, staring at the colossal beast barreling toward them, Rodney’s eyes burned with fury. He shouted angrily and charged ahead with a massive Stone Shield.\nThis attack came too swiftly. When five giant beasts accompanied by a Storm Tiger appeared, despite the Dragon Nest Tribe’s preparations, they could only barely resist against such a terrifying enemy.\nFortunately, the Storm Tiger, being a crafty Magic Beast, quickly fled upon seeing other giant beasts enter the battlefield.\nBut the creature did not leave; instead, it lingered in the dense forest surrounding the area, seemingly coveting something.\nAlthough the Storm Tiger did not join the siege, under the assault of these dimwitted, easily-frenzied giant beasts, the Dragon Nest Beastmen could only barely sustain themselves.\nBoom boom boom!\nOne Extraordinary Beastman after another rushed up only to be flung away by the giant beast, while ordinary Beastmen behind them tossed ropes twisted from vines, trying to bind the giant beast entirely. As more ropes joined, soon each of the giant beasts seemed caught in a web, immediately easing the pressure on the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\n\"Good thing we prepared in advance! Otherwise, we’d be in trouble today.\"\nVini stood at a high vantage point, overseeing the five battlefields, unable to suppress a surge of gratitude in his heart.\nA few days ago, although the disappearance of a Beastman patrol team alerted the entire Dragon Nest Tribe, and they sent out large groups for reconnaissance, the enemy seemed to vanish without a trace.\nDespite not seeing the enemy, to prevent a surprise attack, the Dragon Nest Tribe’s Beastmen decided to contract their defense and dispatched numerous Rodent Scout teams to patrol.\nThanks to the Rodents’ scouting, they detected the giant beasts charging from over the mountain early, allowing the Dragon Nest Tribe to prepare in advance and prevent the beasts from invading the tribe’s interior.\n\"Forward for the great His Highness Austin!\"\nAmid the overwhelming roar, orders were given without confusion.\nExtraordinary Beastmen were at the forefront, ordinary Beastmen wielding long spears behind them, throwing their spears for support. Simultaneously, teams of Beastmen cast ropes woven from vines, trying to bind the giant beasts. Meanwhile, Rangers roamed the perimeter, raining down arrows.\nThrough united collaboration, the Dragon Nest Beastmen finally halted the giants’ advance, causing victory to sway increasingly toward the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"Damn, this can’t go on!\"\nIn the dense forest, hidden within the trees observing everything, Edward cursed fiercely.\n\"Indeed, we underestimated these Beastmen’s strength, Edward, you were right. If that Dragon’s Clan continues to grow, the Southern Countries will face immense trouble.\"\nBeside him, Mercenary Captain Valen looked at the giant beasts starting to falter in the field, his expression grave, and the same was true for the other mercenaries.\nAlthough anticipated initially, when the Dragon Nest Tribe Beastmen’s true strength was displayed before them, everyone was taken aback.\nWith coordinated efforts, the Beastman army attacking the giant beasts remained unfazed, responding to each other, and drove back enemies many times stronger, while suffering minimal losses themselves.\nThis level of fighting power, this disciplined collaboration, reminded everyone of the most elite disciplined armies in certain duchies.\nIf they had attacked directly from the start, their outcome would surely not have been favorable.\n\"Never expected their strength to be so formidable, and they seem to have devised a strategy for slaying giant beasts long ago.\"\nNeither Edward nor the mercenaries knew that previously, as a giant beast neared the Dragon Nest Tribe’s borders, the Dark Elves had to lead an army to eliminate it.\nAlthough they ultimately killed the beast, the Dragon Nest Tribe also suffered significant losses, prompting the leadership to devise another method for hunting giant beasts post-battle.\nThat method involved using a multitude of rope nets to confine the giant beasts’ movements within certain boundaries. A large harvest of arrowroot vines provided ample material for weaving ropes, instructing production Beastmen to prepare these ropes for future use against giant beasts. Subsequently, Beastman Legions practiced formations for combating giant beasts several times.\nThanks to the timid and cautious Rodent Scouts, who had spotted the giant beasts before they reached the Dragon Nest Tribe, the preemptive preparations were already in place, leading to these results in the end.\n\"No choice but for us to take action.\"\nEdward looked at the five giant beasts being steadily suppressed by the Dragon Nest Tribe and spoke in a deep voice.\n\"If we let them kill the giant beasts, we will lose all opportunity! Now, while they’re at a standoff, let’s circle behind for a surprise attack and set a fire in that Dragon Nest Tribe. I refuse to believe they won’t collapse!\"\n\"But if we proceed like this, the losses might be substantial.\"\nMercenary Captain Valen’s voice was somewhat somber, but he knew now was the best time to strike.\n\"If we want to gain enough benefits, we must pay the corresponding price. The title of Dragon Slayer is right before us; what’s your decision?\"\nEdward scanned the gathered mercenaries, speaking with finality.\n\"Since I was the one who suggested slaying the dragon first, I will personally enter to draw some Beastmen’s attention. You quickly circle behind for a surprise attack, setting a fire within the tribe swiftly. Once the fire is ablaze, these Beastmen will likely collapse, and when the giant beasts storm into the tribe to wreak havoc, decimating the Dragon Nest Tribe’s resistance — that’s when we will have our chance to slay the dragon!\"\n...\nAt that moment, the organized Dragon Nest Tribe army was already dispatched outside to fend off the giant beasts, leaving the Dragon Nest Tribe somewhat desolate, yet the guards were not relaxed, instead becoming even more vigilant.\nThree primary companies had already mobilized, also drawing a large number of Beastman militia.\nHowever, within the Dragon Nest Tribe, many production Beastmen also picked up Wooden Spears, constantly patrolling within the tribe to prevent any enemy from sneaking in during the chaos.\nDespite these production Beastmen being inferior in physique and other aspects compared to the real Beastman army, and even to the Beastman militia,\nYet, with intensive training, their collaborative fighting strength was no less than the combat personnel from average Beastman Tribes outside.\nAnd they were the final defense line for the entire Dragon Nest Tribe!",

Eventually, he was transformed and integrated into the Dragon Nest Tribe and later witnessed the various stages of the tribe’s development, watching it rise from nothing.\nLater, due to the Goblin’s physical disadvantage in hunting and other activities and talent in equipment manufacturing, he was transferred to the Manufacturing Workshop. Gradually, he rose and now, with his exceptional talent in tool manufacturing, he was appointed to manage the workshop.\nNowadays, with the enemy assaulting, they, the logistical personnel, were also organized to defend the tribe. Gulu also received the command from Governor Vini to oversee the last defense of the Beastman Tribe.\nTo heighten vigilance, Goblin Gulu even armed the young Beastman cubs. Fortunately, every Beastman had undergone military training before integrating into the tribe, so organizing them did not pose much difficulty.\nOf course, organizing these Beastman cubs was merely to ensure they could evade danger in an orderly manner when encountering danger. In a real bloody battle, they wouldn’t really be used. If the Giant Beasts broke through the Dragon Nest Beastmen’s blockade, even if these old, weak, sick, and disabled were to pile up, it wouldn’t be much use.\n\"Let’s hope nothing unexpected happens.\"\nAfter living in the Dragon Nest Tribe for a whole year, witnessing the tribe’s development from nothing to its current scale, Goblin Gulu developed an unprecedented sense of belonging to the entire Dragon Nest Tribe. He was even more in awe of His Highness Austin, who created all of this.\nBeastmen rarely have a concept of home, but the Dragon Nest Tribe gave Gulu a feeling akin to a home.\nOnce starving and obscure, like a wild grass that no one would care if it died by the roadside, after joining the Dragon Nest Tribe, his talent in tool manufacturing was spotted by His Highness Austin, who assigned him to manage the normal operation of the Manufacturing Workshop.\nNo one could understand the feeling of going from being a despised goblin, who others couldn’t bother to glance at, to suddenly becoming the focus of envy among many Beastmen.\nBut at that moment, having been highly praised and assigned a significant responsibility by Austin, he was moved to tears.\nFrom that moment on, Goblin Gulu had made up his mind, even if it cost him his life, he would repay the lifelong favor of His Highness Austin.\nNo one would understand the feeling of originally being ignored in a dark corner, yet in the end, having someone reach out and pull you into the sunlight, a favor hard to repay even if one’s life depended on it.\n\"Absolutely can’t let those guys disturb His Highness!\"\nLooking at the intense battlefield not far outside the tribe, Gulu swore silently in his heart.\n\"Patrol carefully, absolutely cannot let the enemy sneak in!\"\nTaking one last look at his many followers behind him, Gulu ordered in a grave voice.\nHowever, before his words fell,\nBoom!!!\nWith a huge roar, the tribe’s wall beside him exploded under a massive force, scattering wooden chips and smoke, as two figures landed heavily on the scene.\n\"Enemy assault!!!\"\nWith a sharp cry, teams of Beastmen rushed over from all directions and surrounded the figures who burst through the wall.\n\"Edward, you owe me a big favor this time.\"\nIn the collapsed wall, the burly Mercenary Captain Valen carried two large axes, looking solemnly at the advancing Beastman army ahead.\nWithin the entire Dragon Nest Tribe, combined with the old, weak, sick, and those Beastmen unsuited for battle, there were more than four hundred. Though their individual quality was considerably weaker than ordinary Beastmen, the power unleashed by their close formations was almost on par with the elite forces of other Beastman Tribes.\nThere were four hundred enemies, and they were just two.\n\"Brother Valen, I indeed owe you a big favor this time. If we survive this, you can ask anything of me.\"\nEdward glanced at the oncoming Beastmen, offering a wry smile but with a slight sense of relief in his eyes.\n\"Hahaha, you said it, don’t renege when the time comes!\"\nMercenary Captain Valen laughed heartily, his laughter resonating as if even the air was trembling.\nSimultaneously, Valen roared, releasing a visible surge of black Fighting Qi from his body. The black Qi interwove, condensing into a gigantic black bear three to four meters high in the air, its illusory form roaring at the heavens.\n\"Just a bunch of Beastmen, die for me!\"\nWith unmatched might, the two massive axes fell with a powerful gust as if to cleave the earth. The tremendous sound waves roared, while the surging force swept through like a torrent.\nSimultaneously, Edward’s body glowed with golden light, forming what seemed like a golden armor around him, as the Holy Light illuminated the world.\n\"Humility, bravery, honesty, compassion, justice, sacrifice, honor, soul... these are the Eight Virtues of a Knight!\"\nEdward and the Mercenary Captain exploded with maximum power and clashed with the surrounding Beastman army. A burst of Fighting Qi rays erupted, sporadically sending Beastmen flying, but the surviving Beastman troops showed no sign of retreating. As one fell, another emerged to entangle the two in battle.\n...\nSimultaneously, inside the governing hall.\nAs the most iconic building of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe, its capture would signify the tribe’s complete collapse and demise. Before the tribe was overrun, it was one of the safest places.\nThus, all the young Beastman children of the Dragon Nest Tribe were gathered here. Jackal Wolf Person Meng Bi led the larger Beastman cubs in patrolling and vigilance. Though these young Beastman squads couldn’t assist much in the larger theatre of war, they at least possessed some self-defense capabilities.\nThe much smaller group of Beastman children was led by several pig-bodied aunts from the kindergarten, sitting quietly to one side, their expressions filled with unease.",

      "content": "Chapter 128: Chapter 126 Urgency\nThanks to the policy system of the Dragon Nest Tribe at this time, the entire tribe has been integrated systematically, exerting maximum power.\nDue to the fact that the beastman cubs spend most of their days in nursery-like institutions led by several pig-bodied grandmothers, even amidst current war disturbances, where parents are mobilized to fight the giant beasts, they are organized together and supervised, preventing any chaos from occurring.\nIf it were other tribes, facing such an attack from giant beasts, lacking military training modifications and systematic command, even if the entire tribe’s population stepped forward to resist the giant beast’s attack, the rear would be in utter disarray.\nHowever, by initially adopting the military governance system, the Dragon Nest Tribe inadvertently prevented the emergence of various chaotic scenes when danger descended.\n\"Damn it, have the enemies already infiltrated the tribe?!\"\nJackal Wolf People youth Meng Bi looked at the fighting qi radiance blooming not far away, along with the final defense armies continuously rushing over from various directions, with some anxiety in his expression.\nAs the class leader, he has already tried his best to organize all the beastman youth’s power, forming a team protected on one side, but if the enemies indeed break through here, their power is utterly incapable of resistance.\nDuring the cold winter season a year ago, he and his sister Aisha both fled their original tribe, attracted to join the Dragon Nest Tribe by the smoke pillars rising from it, successfully integrating into the Dragon Nest Tribe, starting a new life.\nFrom the days of struggling for sustenance, with dangers looming every moment, to settling down in the Dragon Nest Tribe, never again worrying about various threats from the depths of the forest, only needing labor to survive by relying on one’s own hands.\nTo the honored His Highness Austin who rescued them siblings, and provided a life of stability now, even without the indoctrination of past brainwashing, Meng Bi holds unparalleled reverence for that highness.\nAlthough he and the others are merely one of the many inconspicuous clan beastmen under His Highness Austin’s command, the highness cannot possibly know his name, nor necessarily knows there is such a Jackal Wolf People youth under his command who holds deep respect for him, yet Meng Bi is determined, henceforth to repay the great favor of the highness, even if sacrificing his life in the end.\n\"Teachers, transfer the children to the cliff under the Dragon Nest side! The enemies probably have attacked inside!\"\nGazing at the fierce fighting qi flying around in the distance, Meng Bi hastily said to several pig-bodied grandmothers watching over the children.\nIf the enemies indeed attack here, then these beastman cubs’ power would only become a burden.\n\"Alright.\"\nSeveral pig-bodied grandmothers also understand the urgency of the situation, organizing the beastman cubs inside City Hall quickly and heading towards the rear.\nBut at this moment,\nBang bang bang...\nSuccessive footsteps emerged as a group of human mercenaries circumvented the Mercenary Captain Valen and Edward’s breached section of the wall, secretly infiltrated from another side, advancing towards the open area in front of City Hall.\n\"Not good, there are beastmen over there!\"\nOne sharp-eyed mercenary saw, inside City Hall, the group of beastman cubs that were evacuating.\n\"Enemies are here!!!\"\nThe Jackal Wolf People youth Meng Bi along with other beastman youths also saw them, immediately shouting, with sharp whistles echoing in the air, signaling an alarm and call for aid.\n\"No time left! Berkeley, Brown, you two go deal with them, the rest spread out and set fire! Quickly, don’t let these beastmen react!\"\nSeeing the whistle sound echoing in the sky, knowing they’ve been exposed, Mercenary Deputy Captain Murphy quickly ordered, immediately the team dispersed, heading towards their respective targets.\n...\n\"Damn it! Enemies are here!!!\"\nInside the Dragon Nest Tribe, the Fox-faced Man Quik, who originally led the last elite Dragon Nest Beastmen to help surround the Mercenary Captain Valen and Edward, instantly turned pale upon hearing the sharp whistle sound from behind.\nFell into a trap!\nThere is His Highness’s resting place there, and where the beastman children of the tribe are located, City Hall!\nFox-faced Man Quik intended to lead part of the beastman elite to break free, but the Mercenary Captain Valen and Edward seemed aware of Quik’s intent, their bodies burst forth with fighting qi again, the ground cracking vast expanses, shattered stones scattered like bullets, spider web-like cracks spread out.\nFor a moment, under the onslaught of the two, the Dragon Nest Beastmen army had to resist grudgingly.\n\"Damn fellows!\"\nAt this time outside the tribe, the main force of the Dragon Nest Tribe was resisting the assault of five giant beasts, struggling to face the enemy, while behind them, they fell into the lure of these two fellows, once causing a huge disturbance, it would lead to a large collapse!\nMoreover, the cliff at the far end, His Highness Austin is resting there!\n\"Go to hell for me!\"\nFox-faced Man Quik, his eyes wide with rage, roared in anger, the ring in his hand sparked magical waves, ripples visible to the naked eye spread in the air.\nFeeling the magical power fluctuation in the air, both Mercenary Captain Valen and Edward, seasoned warriors, instinctively dodged outside, seeing the ground they had stepped on moments before pulsating, black vines breaking through the ground, almost scraping by.\nBoth leaped to a distant spot, their bodies flaring fighting qi, violently smashing the extending vines into pieces.\nHowever, before they could rejoice narrowly escaping disaster, the next moment,\nHoo hoo hoo!\nTorrents of flame rose, sweeping across the sky, falling with extremely daunting momentum.\nSeeing the gigantic fireball plummeting from the sky with astonishing power, both’s pupils narrowed, their fighting qi further intensified.\n\"Knight Secret Skill: Elemental Slash!\"\n\"Earth Splitting Slash!\"\nBoom!!!\nTwo enormous light blades exploded forth, colliding with the enormous falling fireball, instantaneously erupting a terrifying explosion, the visible shockwave transforming into a whirlwind storm sweeping across, surrounding beastmen staggered back to dodging.\n\"Damn it!!!\"\nAt this time Quik had almost exhausted all his tactics, but seeing the two merely panting, their energy heavily depleted yet not losing combat power, veins bulging on his forehead, eyes filled with unparalleled anger.\nNo way to return quickly now, those little rascals, you must hang tight!\n...\n\"Go, quickly! We’ll hold them!\"\nAt City Hall, seeing those two terrifying humans charging towards their direction, temporarily as the youth team leader, Jackal Wolf People Meng Bi shouted loudly to the beastman children retreating behind.\nSimultaneously, the team of twenty-plus beastman youths gripped wooden spears tightly, charging towards the two ahead.\n\"Brother!\"\nInside the beastman children team, Aisha just wanted to rush out, but a pig-bodied grandmother next to her swiftly embraced her body, Aisha only felt herself flying in the air.\nShe shouted loudly, struggled fiercely, but the pig-bodied grandmother embracing her held firm.\nMeanwhile, the voice and figure of her brother were rapidly retreating.....",

      "content": "Chapter 129: Chapter 125 Blood Battle\nBoom!\nAt this moment, within the Dragon Nest Tribe, as the mercenaries continued to set fires everywhere, scorching flames rose up and gradually spread out.\n\"Damn, what the hell is going on?!\"\nMercenary Deputy Captain Murphy looked at his teammates who were running around setting fires, his face somewhat grim.\nThese houses were primarily brick and wood structures, and from the beginning, there were considerations for potential disasters like fires, with preventative measures like spacing taken care of.\nWhat Murphy didn’t know was that the Dragon Nest Tribe designed it this way precisely because during a particular attack on a Centaur Tribe, the Fox-faced Man Quik had used a Flame Burst Technique that resulted in a massive fire, causing the entire Centaur Tribe to collapse, allowing the Dragon Nest Tribe to win that war easily, which led to the formation of their cavalry units.\nFrom that battle, Austin saw the weaknesses in wooden and grassy structures, and upon returning to the tribe, he specifically instructed the Goblin Manufacturing Workshop to produce large quantities of bricks for the purpose of updating the construction of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s houses, and also to implement fire prevention measures in daily life.\nIt was precisely these arrangements laid out back then that made Murphy and the other mercenaries’ fire-starting efforts encounter unprecedented difficulty. It took considerable time to barely ignite a single house, but the isolated spacing made it hard for the flames to spread.\n\"Damn it, we have to continue!\"\nGazing at the house behind him, with barely a few flames and smoke rising, Murphy felt a heavy oppressive feeling in his chest.\nBut even knowing that the longer they delayed, the more dangerous it became, there was no choice but to risk setting fires to cause greater chaos.\n...\nAt the same time, at the City Hall.\nBang!\nAccompanied by the loud noise, the sound of wooden spears breaking came, and the spears in the hands of the young Beastmen rushing forward were directly shattered, with several figures being blown away.\nThe difference in combat strength was indeed too great!\nThese young Beastmen, though trained, had bodies that had not fully grown, with strength even less than half of that of adult Beastmen. Yet their opponents were truly battle-hardened extraordinary mercenary professionals, and the elite kind at that. How could these young Beastmen possibly withstand them?\nIn no time, the young Beastmen team was easily defeated by two people. As fighting qi surged, everyone standing fell to the ground, the whole scene as effortlessly destructive as breaking dead wood.\nHowever, when Brown and Blake had knocked down the young Beastmen in front of them, they suddenly heard heavy breathing, as a single figure swayed and stood up again.\nAmong all the wounded on the ground, only that single figure rose once more.\n\"Even if I must stake my life, I... must not retreat!\"\nThe broken wooden spear was heavily thrust upside down into the ground, and leveraging that force, the teetering figure of Meng Bi suddenly stood firm, his bloodshot eyes fixed intently on Brown and Blake ahead.\nBehind him lay the great His Highness Austin, who had granted them new life, and his sister!\nNo matter what, he could not fall!\nIn that moment, an indomitable will somehow supported that battered body, and Meng Bi, leaning on the broken wooden spear, stood up once more.\nDrip, drip...\nDrip by drip, crimson blood dripped from the gaping wounds on his body, with the deeply torn wounds even revealing the white bones underneath, his whole body drenched in blood. The excruciating pain surged through every muscle in his body like a tsunami, almost engulfing him entirely, yet in that powerful will was like a reef that remained unmoved.\nSuch injuries should not have allowed him to stand again, but Meng Bi had done it.\nHe dragged his shattered body and stood up once more, once again blocking their path!\nHe absolutely could not let them pass through here!\nThat unprecedented resolve completely took over his body, causing the nearly shattered young Beastman to stand up again from the brink of death.\n\"What?!!!\"\nConfronted with this scene, even Brown and Blake were shaken by Meng Bi’s insane and resolute will.\nIn their mercenary careers, their hands had been stained with no small amount of lives, yet this was the first time they’d seen a yet-to-come-of-age Beastman defeated once and stand up again with such unyielding force of will!\n\"Kid, do you really want to die so much?\"\nBrown, wielding the wolf fang club, looked at the jackal Beastman Meng Bi who stood before him with incredible willpower, his voice low.\nWhat kind of willpower could it possibly take for a young Beastman to endure and stand before them with such a broken body!\nBut,\nThough the will was shocking, they were not saintly soft-hearted people.\nThere were always enemies one couldn’t surpass in this world, and in reality, youthful passion didn’t always lead to success.\nBrown raised the wolf fang club high above, casting a shadow that enveloped Meng Bi’s entire body, clearly about to smash his head in the next moment.\nJust at this moment,\n\"I will bet my life with you!!!\"\nBlood oozed from his skin, dyeing Meng Bi’s fur a deep red, his broken left hand hanging powerless, yet those blood-colored eyes were filled with sheer madness and ferocity.\nIn the next instant, a wave of invisible majesty suddenly surged from Meng Bi’s blood red pupils, causing Brown to be momentarily stunned.\nIn the brief moment of Brown’s stupor, Meng Bi moved, darting forward like a cheetah, transforming into a blood-red shadow that leapt onto Brown.\nRoar!!!\nWith a mad howl, Meng Bi opened his mouth, fiercely biting towards Brown’s neck, yet Brown was, after all, a battle-hardened elite mercenary, instinctively dodging at the moment he sensed danger, leaving Meng Bi to bite his shoulder, tearing off a large chunk of flesh.\n\"Ah!!!\"\nBrown cried out in pain, instinctively swinging his arm wildly, but Meng Bi clung like a maddened dog, his jaws locked on tight.\nAt the same time, Meng Bi thrust the broken spear fiercely into his own dangling left arm.\nSplatter!\nBlood spurted out, with the broken spear piercing through his thin arm, and subsequently embedding into Brown’s shoulder.\nHe intended to use such self-mutilation to secure himself to the enemy!\n\"Ah! Bastard!\"\nBrown roared in anger, his fighting qi burst forth, sending the spear that skewered Meng Bi’s arm and pierced his shoulder flying, while a raging torrent of energy blasted out, immediately sending the heavily scarred Meng Bi flying, and kicked him in the stomach, causing Meng Bi to crash backward like a cannonball.",

      "content": "Chapter 130: Chapter 126 Awakening\n\"Ah! Damn guy!\"\nAfter kicking Meng Bi away, Brown didn’t pursue the victory. Instead, he staggered backward, clutching the horrifying wound on his right shoulder with his left hand, roaring continuously.\nUnexpectedly, after years of life and death, he nearly stumbled here.\nNo way!\nHow could he be so easily intimidated?!\nEvery mercenary who’s been through life and death has a will as hard as steel. How could such a person become dazed just because of the brave tenacity of a Beastman youth who fights to the death?\nRecalling the mental impact he suffered earlier, he looked incredulously in the direction where Meng Bi was knocked away.\nHe saw in the distance a massive hole had collapsed in the wall, scattered with broken bricks. From beneath the rubble, a figure emerged, breaking through the top debris.\nHe saw the Jackal Wolf youth, Meng Bi, covered in dust mixed with his own blood, looking extremely pathetic, but his reddened eyes, like those of a Magic Beast from the abyss, crazily stared at the two of them.\nAt this moment, Meng Bi stood on all fours on the bricks like an animal, baring his sharp teeth. A faint blood mist emanated from his body, like a fierce ancient Magic Beast possessing him, bringing an overwhelming and terrifying aura.\n\"This is...\"\nObserving the strange appearance of the Jackal Wolf youth in front of him, Brown’s expression shifted suddenly. Evidently, his earlier distraction was due to this aura’s impact.\n\"This is ancestral reversion!\"\nFrom behind, Blake gripped his longsword tightly, slowly walking forward to lean beside Brown.\nEverything before had occurred in the blink of an eye, developing to this point before he could even offer support.\n\"If this bloodline reversion continues, we absolutely cannot let you live!\"\nBlake gazed solemnly at the Jackal Wolf youth within the ruins, covered in wounds yet with undiminished fierce aura, his expression heavier than ever.\nTo exhibit signs of ancestral reversion means that if this Jackal Wolf youth doesn’t die now, he will surely become a Legendary existence in the future!\nWhoosh!\nBlake leapt, his entire figure vanishing from the spot. The gleam of his longsword traced a long, snowy line in the air, appearing over Meng Bi in an instant.\nThe icy shine swirled, turning into a semicircular arc blade in the air, illuminating the sky as it descended.\nAt this moment, with Meng Bi just awakening and exhibiting the phenomenon of reversion, his body’s foundation was inherently poor. Coupled with his severely injured body, how could he muster any other power, and now he appeared doomed under Blake’s sweeping strike.\nThe bright light was already illuminating Meng Bi’s eyes.\nThe next moment,\nBoom!!!!\nSuddenly, an earth-shattering noise exploded between heaven and earth, rolling like ten thousand bolts of thunder sweeping in all directions!\nStill suspended in the air, Blake suddenly felt an overwhelming pressure like a Vast Sea sweeping across the sky and earth, surprising him greatly as if he fell into an ice cave in midwinter, doused in a chill that froze through the body.\nThe prickling danger at his back made his entire body instinctively retreat, bouncing back!\nAt some point, black like ink and as heavy as a mountain, the clouds had nested over the entire sky, layers of dark clouds obscuring the heavens, making the sky within reach.\nThe black clouds swirled, forming a massive dark vortex above the sky, enveloping the entire Dragon Nest Tribe, making it seem like the whole area had fallen into an abyss, a vast dragon’s might filling every corner of the heavens and earth, weighing heavily on everyone’s heart.\nAt this moment, whether inside or outside the Dragon Nest Tribe, all the battles ceased involuntarily.\nThe team led by the Mercenary Deputy Captain forgot about setting fires, the Beastman team led by the Fox-faced Man Quik forgot about the siege, Edward and the Mercenary Captain Valen forgot about their fight, and even the battlefield outside the Dragon Nest Tribe began to cease.\nEven the Giant Beast, as terrifying as a mountain, stopped struggling within the Beastmen’s net, blankly staring at the massive black cloud vortex directly below a cliff in the sky.\nA terrifying presence was suppressing and gathering within the cliff, like flames suppressed for millennia, containing immensely powerful energy.\nAt this moment, that cliff became the center of the universe!\nCrack!!!\nAbove the sky, a thunderbolt as thick as a barrel suddenly fell, illuminating the heavens, splitting the sky as it crashed upon the cliff.\nBoom!!!\nIn an instant, it was as if the world collapsed, a massive explosion erupted, shattering the entire cliff into fragments, huge stones crumbling and flowing away in torrents in all directions.\nMeanwhile, arcs of electricity and firelights flickered faintly within the swirling dust, a terrifying shadow slowly unfurled its wings, an expansive dragon’s might swept between heaven and earth, as if proclaiming its arrival to the world.\nWhoosh!\nThe wings flapped, a giant flood swept open, the surrounding dust and stones were immediately sucked in and torn apart, clearing the sky.\n\"It’s so refreshing!\"\nAustin shook his head, stretched both arms and legs, just feeling an unprecedented comfort, his body filled with vitality, a sense of transparency as if every cell was breathing deeply.\nIn hindsight, this should be the first time Austin had truly slept, and the first time he could sleep deeply without worrying about his safety.\nHowever, both his soul and growth trajectory were vastly different from ordinary Young Dragons, even his strength after sleeping had made a significant leap forward, compared to normal Young Dragons, an almost unimaginable anomaly.\n\"Although I’m not sure why, now I should be at Quasi-Gold level...\"\nLooking at his own body and feeling the boundless Magic Power within, Austin thought to himself secretly.\nA normal Young Dragon at his stage would probably only be at Quasi-Silver level.\nBut Austin’s situation is different, perhaps due to his soul, or maybe because he often used Thunder Forging Body to stimulate cell growth, he traversed a path in three years that many Young Dragons take ten to twenty years to tread.\nStill, whether such rapid growth is a blessing or a curse remains unknown.\nHowever, whether it’s a blessing or a curse, it’s not something he can concern himself with right now.\n\"Hmm, has the tribe been attacked... Giant Beast... and humans???\"\nA moment later, Austin awoke completely from his slumber, naturally realizing everything happening in the Dragon Nest Tribe from his high vantage point.\nThe Giant Beast attack was understandable.\nBut why were humans able to pass through the vast Kawa Great Forest and appear here?",

      "content": "Chapter 131: Chapter 127: Defeated and Fled\nThis Kawa Great Forest is almost comparable in size to Russia in Austin’s previous life, and the area where Austin is located is in a somewhat remote central position.\nThis place is over a thousand kilometers away from the Bloody Border. Despite there being many landless peasant mercenaries and others crossing the Great Wall into the wilderness to establish villages and survive at the edge of the Kawa Great Forest.\nBut in the area extending a hundred miles into the Kawa Great Forest, human activity has already disappeared, and even trade caravans from the human world dealing with large beastman tribes wouldn’t venture too deep into the dangerous Kawa Great Forest.\nThus, the presence of these humans here is particularly suspicious.\nWhat’s more, the current plight of the Dragon Nest Tribe is likely related to these humans.\nLooking down from above, now within the Dragon Nest Tribe, flames were rising from houses, the wall had collapsed to reveal a large hole, and numerous beastman corpses were strewn on the ground, blood splattered against the walls.\nSmoke was billowing, on the brink of collapse.\nOutside of the Dragon Nest Tribe, the beastman army resisting the giant beasts suffered heavy losses. Although they managed to suppress the giant beasts’ onslaught, and when Kobold leader Vini saw the Dragon Nest Tribe on fire, used the War Horn, the morale of the Dragon Nest beastman army did not collapse but rebounded, causing the giant beasts to retreat, with victory seemingly within grasp. However, even if the beastman army ultimately surrounds and destroys the five giant beasts, the overall combat strength of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe would be severely depleted.\n\"Hmph, courting death!\"\nThis Dragon Nest Tribe took considerable effort for me to establish, and it was nearly destroyed by these humans. If I hadn’t awakened in time, wouldn’t the entire tribe have been breached and disappeared?\nMoreover, thinking further, if I hadn’t developed this tribe and these humans found their way here, wouldn’t I have been killed in my sleep?\nThinking of this, Austin made no further pauses.\nWhirl!\nA tremendous whirlwind arose, and Austin’s figure swept into the sky with an overwhelming torrent, surging and engulfing the heavens.\nBut on the horizon, underneath the gloomy clouds, a colossal shadow hovered. It spread its wings wide, arcs of electricity blossoming in the air, with the thunder hidden within the dark clouds seeming to be stirred, growing even more violent, emitting a rumbling roar.\nAt this moment, Austin felt as if he had merged into the world, with the thunderstorm clouds above becoming part of his body, seemingly moving according to his will.\n\"Is this the result of the slumber and transformation...\"\nThe Giant Dragon Race is almost nature’s favored children.\nThe Blue Dragon among the Giant Dragon Race is known to humans as the overlord of storms due to its unparalleled talent in controlling storm and thunder. An adult Blue Dragon walking the world can alter the weather of a city with its magic power, causing clouds as heavy as mountains to cover the sky, resonating with rolling thunder throughout the land, bringing forth an overwhelming storm as if heralding an apocalypse.\nThough with Austin’s current growth and strength, he can’t yet freely change the weather, after half a month of slumber, he can still establish a connection with the storm clouds attracted by his transformation.\nThis slumber did not allow Austin to awaken new talent magic, but it gave him a vague feeling that he could connect with the storm clouds above and turn them into his power.\n\"Azure Thunder Descend!\"\nWith a thought, the positive and negative charges in the clouds rapidly neutralized, generating countless blinding white lightning. At that moment, the dark clouds were illuminated to white by the thunderous lightning, with bolts of lightning crazily dancing across the heavens, containing incredibly terrifying destructive power.\nBut this wasn’t over; in the next moment,\nBOOM!!!\nWith an earth-shattering blast, it was as if ten thousand thunders descended from the sky.\nUnder Austin’s initially awakened Blue Dragon authority, the thunderstorm from the sky was under his control, watching as bolts of thunder crashed down towards the mercenaries.\n\"Damn it!\"\n\"Not good!\"\n\"Get out of the way!\"\nBOOM!\nElectric snakes fell from the sky, crashing down on the scattered mercenaries. One by one, mercenaries activated their fighting qi to resist and dodge, but despite that, many were directly entangled by the electric snakes, leaving them paralyzed on the ground.\n\"Its power is a bit weaker than the Thunder Strike Technique!\"\nSeeing the numerous mercenaries below get hit by the thunder and lose their strength to resist, Austin mused internally.\nThis move could likely only be used to clear out small fry, with its single-target lethality even somewhat inferior to the Thunder Strike Technique.\nWithout further thought, Austin flapped his wings, flying directly toward Mercenary Captain Valen and Edward. In the entire Dragon Nest Tribe, only the aura of those two was the strongest, and they were the only two who could withstand his thunder unscathed. Obviously, they were the leaders of these humans.\n\"Humans, if you don’t want to face my wrath, you’d better give me a reasonable explanation!\"\nAccompanied by a thunderous voice echoing from the sky, a massive shadow descended onto a dilapidated house, the created torrent extinguishing the fires around it, with a colossal current sweeping across the area.\n\"Edward, brother, let’s go!\"\nSeeing that terrifying shadow descending, the Mercenary Captain grabbed Edward by the shoulder and swiftly retreated.\nMeanwhile, the surrounding beastmen were prostrating on the ground, welcoming Austin’s arrival, too slow to react to the duo’s decisive escape.\n\"Think you can run? Not that easy!\"\nAfter painstakingly building the Dragon Nest Tribe, it was nearly destroyed, and the instigators wanted to escape? Impossible!\nBOOM!\nWith wings spread wide, Austin’s figure soared, newly matured dragon might sweeping powerfully, like the pressure of a mountain instantly crashing down on the fleeing duo.\n\"Go!\"\nIn the critical moment, the black fighting qi on Valen surged violently, striking Edward’s body with immense force, sending him flying forward.\nSimultaneously, Mercenary Captain Valen, carrying the vast pressure from above, crashed down and fell to the ground, the enormous shadow enveloping his body.\n\"Brother Valen!\"\nEdward shouted, but as Valen struck him midair, it also inflicted injury on his figure, sending him hurtling several hundred meters, crashing into the river, and getting swept away by the raging currents, disappearing without a trace....",

      "content": "Chapter 132: Chapter 128 Post-War Integration\n\"Human, tell me, why are you here!\"\nA voice calm like thunder echoed from behind, rolling like thunder, causing a constant roaring in Valen’s ears.\nThe enormous, heart-oppressing shadow was slowly approaching, carrying an incredibly terrifying aura.\n\"Hmph, evil Blue Dragon, don’t expect to get anything from me!\"\nMercenary Captain Valen turned around, facing the shadow that obscured most of the sky in front of him. His hands instinctively gripped the axe tightly, speaking loudly between heavy breaths.\nThis was the instinctive fear of lower-level creatures facing higher-level ones, more so the fear that arises when confronting an enemy of much larger size.\n\"Hmph, no answer? Fine, someone will.\"\nThe huge dragon claw, filled with terrifying power, crashed down. The black bear phantom on the Mercenary Captain had just emerged when it was slapped to the ground like a mouse, causing a deep pit to form in the earth.\nSeeing Valen, the mercenary captain, lying motionless in the pit, Austin didn’t spare another glance, his body swirling into flight, heading out of the Dragon Nest Tribe, where his Clan was fiercely battling five Giant Beasts. Austin would not let these painstakingly trained elite Clan members die in vain.\nWith Austin’s involvement, the morale on the side of the Dragon Nest Beastmen was instantly boosted to its peak. The Giant Beasts, already at a disadvantage, were completely routed and were soon surrounded and slain by the Beastmen.\nAs the Giant Beasts fell, the Magic Beast Storm Tigers on the forest’s outskirts had already left at some unknown time. The threat to the Dragon Nest Tribe completely disappeared, and the great battle concluded with a victory for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nHowever, in this unexpected disaster, while the Dragon Nest Tribe emerged victorious, it also suffered significant losses.\nAfter the victory, the Dragon Nest Tribe began accounting for casualties. Nearly three hundred elite Beastmen perished directly in this conflict, and nearly two-thirds were injured, marking the tribe’s losses as grievous, even more so than the battle with the Blood Claw Tribe.\nDespite this assault, the cohesion of the Dragon Nest Tribe improved, and the orc prisoners from the former Blood Claw Tribe fully integrated into the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAt least, after more than half a month of transformation, the Blood Claw orc prisoners not only refrained from causing chaos during the assault but also fought bravely, earning full acceptance and integration into the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAside from the regular orc army, the Extraordinary Beastmen suffered even more losses.\nSince only the Extraordinary Beastmen could frontally withstand the Giant Beast’s attacks, serving as a diversion, the casualties among them were considerably higher during the assault on the Giant Beasts.\nInitially numbering over sixty, only about thirty Extraordinary Beastmen remained, with more than half perished, and those left were all injured, their combat ability drastically reduced to the limit.\nA large number of injured individuals once again filled the Dragon Nest Tribe’s hospital. Fortunately, with continuous accumulation and the experience from the last large-scale battle, the Dragon Nest Tribe had a good store of medical knowledge, and their treatment methods were well refined, though the stockpile of herbs was utterly insufficient, necessitating dispatching additional personnel foraging for more outside.\nThankfully, the Beastmen’s life force is robust, and those with minor injuries would heal naturally with simple care, while the precious herbs were applied to the severely injured, alleviating the pressure on herbal resources to some extent.\nWhen it comes to the wounded, Austin attaches significant importance, personally inspecting during the post-battle gathering, and commending the warriors for their brave fighting spirit, as these Beastmen were fighting for him and were part of his Clan. Expressing timely care and importance was crucial.\nIn Austin’s view afterward, his behavior, partly sincere and partly performative, seemed effective, with many Beastmen moved to tears, enhancing morale rather than dwelling in the tragedy of their significant losses, bustling energetically in tidying up the post-battle aftermath.\nThis was no anomaly, given that Austin had established an entirely new Dragon Nest Tribe system, granting them a new way of life, with consistent indoctrination of loyalty and admiration into their minds.\nFor these simple Beastmen, Austin, who had experienced various informational bombards in a previous life, only employed some simple marketing techniques, which were enough to profoundly move these simple Beastmen.\nBesides the losses suffered by the Dragon Nest Beastmen themselves, the entire settlement of the tribe also took notable damage during this battle.\nLater, when the Mercenary Corps infiltrated the Dragon Nest Tribe, not only did they blow open a substantial section of the wall, but substantial portions of the housing, about one-fifth in total, were set ablaze by numerous infiltrating mercenaries.\nFortunately, Austin had precautions against fire disasters. The houses, constructed of wooden brick structures with spacing between them, prevented the mercenaries’ arson from causing a chain reaction, saving the remaining four-fifths of the homes.\nAdditionally, to prevent fire disasters and other potential troubles, the Dragon Nest Tribe’s provisions were stored in a semi-underground warehouse next to the state hall, avoiding any impact in this attack.\nNonetheless, despite these preparations, the damage to the Dragon Nest Tribe’s settlement was considerable, and rebuilding the one-fifth of the homes was a significant challenge.\nLuckily, with the coming of cold winter, a large amount of Beastmen labor would become available, and squeezing together while repairing the houses posed no major issue.\nAfter the great battle, the Dragon Nest Tribe swiftly entered the phase of post-war integration.\nOriginally governed through a military-civilian unity within a military-political system, the post-war integration process of the Dragon Nest Tribe proceeded rather smoothly without any significant disturbances.\nThe decision to implement military training and reform on the Beastmen proved highly suitable, greatly enhancing their combat prowess, organizational and productive capacity, as well as their post-war recovery abilities.\nThrough routine training, discipline had almost become ingrained in them, making it more convenient for Austin to strategically command these Beastmen, maximizing the strength of the Beastman Clan.\nWith various post-battle tasks completed, Austin finally found the time to interrogate these strange individuals who appeared inexplicably in his territory.\nDespite the Mercenary Captain Valen remaining taciturn in the dungeon post-capture, not every mercenary shared the same resolve.\nUpon learning the reasons from these mercenaries, Austin furrowed his brows tightly.\nTheir presence here was both a coincidence and an inevitability.",

      "content": "Chapter 133: Chapter 129: The Reason\nCrash!\nSomewhere far from the Dragon Nest Tribe, in a rushing river, the utterly exhausted and drenched Edward grabbed onto a tree root on the riverbank. Using his last ounce of strength, he hauled himself ashore with a roll.\nHaving spent his final bit of energy, Edward lay flat on his back, soaking wet and disheveled, gasping for air as he stared up at the sky, his eyes seemingly devoid of spirit.\n\"Valen, my brother...\"\nRecalling that final moment, his hands involuntarily clenched into fists, nails digging into his flesh, and blood dripped down.\n\"It’s all my fault. I shouldn’t have let you take such risks...\"\nEdward’s eyes turned bloodshot, and his voice became choked.\nThinking back to that initial accidental friendship he formed with Brother Valen, and then how time and again during their adventures, Brother Valen took care of him, being more than a big brother to him, more like family.\nBut now, because of his own fault, that most respected Brother Valen found himself in the hands of that malevolent Blue Dragon, with little chance of survival.\nAnd those mercenaries, after many days traveling together, had formed a profound friendship with him.\nYet now, it was all destroyed, everything gone!\nSorrow spread through Edward’s heart like a small venomous snake worming through his veins.\nHe was too arrogant, thinking that he could deal with that orphan dragon with his wisdom. It was his stubbornness that led to this, leaving the entire mercenary squad, including Brother Valen, without survivors.\nIndeed, in Edward’s heart, those who fell into the hands of that evil Blue Young Dragon were destined to die, with no chance of survival.\nThe raid had caused heavy losses to the evil Blue Young Dragon’s clan underlings, and Edward knew nothing good awaited those captured by the Blue Young Dragon.\n\"Rest assured, Brother Valen, and all the members of the mercenary corps, I, Edward, swear here and now, even if it takes my entire life, I will annihilate that evil Blue Dragon, strip its sinews and bones, and let it die in agonizing howls with the cruelest means for your vengeance!\"\nAt this moment, Edward’s Knight’s Sword had fallen somewhere unknown, so he picked up a sharp stone from the ground, slashed open his right hand, allowing the crimson blood to drip onto the ground as he gazed resolutely upstream, swearing a blood oath.\nAfter resting for quite a while, barely replenishing his energy, Edward roused himself, suppressing the endless guilt in his heart, and determinedly staggered northward.\nFor messing up everything, ultimately costing the attacks of his former companions, Edward felt profound regret in his heart, but there was one thing he was sure of, that if the Dragon Nest Tribe continued to develop, it would certainly sweep across the Barbaric Land of the Kawa Great Forest, becoming a formidable adversary to the Southern Countries.\nFrom the lessons of this failed raid, Edward understood this point even more.\nWith just some wooden spear equipment, in merely two years, it had shown such formidable power. If given time to develop, that evil Blue Young Dragon could grow into a massive Beastman Empire, which wasn’t impossible.\nHe needed to leave the Barbaric Land of the Kawa Great Forest and head to the Southern Countries, seeking the help of various kings and dukes.\nHe needed to tell them,\nThe crisis had arrived!\n...\n\"A Half-Legendary Great Mage’s legacy?\"\nAfter interrogating the captured mercenaries, the news left Austin both astonished and furrowed-browed.\nAccording to the mercenaries, roughly six months ago, the blond noble heir Edward had come to find the Mercenary Captain Valen, and spent a hefty sum to hire them to venture into the Kawa Great Forest, supposedly seeking a Half-Legendary Great Mage’s legacy.\nAlthough the peril-laden Kawa Great Forest was a hazardous place, for the sake of gold coins, and also due to the decent friendship between the blond noble heir and Captain Valen, they accepted the mission to escort him deep into the Kawa Great Forest to search.\nEven though the mercenaries said their raid on the Dragon Nest Tribe was purely accidental, when they found the place, they learned from small stray tribes about a Dragon Nest built by a Blue Young Dragon that had developed into a regional overlord within two short years. The noble heir Edward became curious and led his men to investigate, discovering the future threat of this Dragon Nest Tribe to the Human World, and eventually, tempting the mercenaries into launching a series of attacks, leading to this result.\nOn the surface, it seemed like a mere accident.\nBut Austin didn’t think so. Simply put, the Kawa Great Forest’s area was almost comparable to Austin’s previous life’s Russia, and the Dragon Nest Tribe’s occupied territory was but a drop in the ocean, so how could they coincidentally stumble upon the Dragon Nest Tribe?\nUnless from the start, their route was aimed in this direction.\nMoreover, within the Dragon Nest Tribe’s territory, a Mage’s relic indeed existed.\nNot long ago, Austin found a Red Crystal capable of activating the Flame Burst Technique and a ring capable of activating the Vine Technique within that relic, both handed to the Fox-faced Man Quik, greatly enhancing his power.\nFrom the relic’s condition back then, its owner left hastily due to certain matters, but may still have reached Half-Legendary status later, leaving behind extremely secretive matters, which by coincidence, ended up with Edward, eventually drawing in this squad of mercenaries.\nIt wasn’t just possible; it had to be like this!\nWhat Edward was searching for was certainly related to the legacy of that Gold Level Great Mage.\nFrom the beast skin notes back then, Austin didn’t glean much information, but from the sporadic phrases, it seemed that the Great Mage uncovered some astonishing secret, pushing the noble heir Edward to venture across mountains and rivers despite dangers, leading to the discovery of the Dragon Nest Tribe nearby, and triggering the subsequent series of events.\n\"Even if it was a calamity without reason, it’s inevitable. Damn, what on earth did that Mage discover, and what did he leave behind!\"\nGazing at the reservoir lake not far from the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin’s eyes grew deep and contemplative.",

      "content": "Chapter 134: Chapter 130: Disposal of the Mercenary Captives\nLooking down from above, the lake reservoir that abruptly appears between the dense forest does seem somewhat peculiar. From the beast skin notes of that Gold Level Great Mage that Austin obtained earlier, it’s known that this lake reservoir seems to be a meteorite crater formed by something falling from the sky, akin to a meteorite.\nMoreover, at the bottom of the lake, there exist some completely unknown secrets, at least that plant known as Ghost Grass, said to only grow in places where the Power of the World is exposed, is something Austin is currently unable to comprehend.\n\"This is simply... a disaster out of nowhere!\"\nOriginally choosing this place as a lair was because he was born nearby and this location is relatively secluded. There aren’t many top predators like Magic Beasts or Giant Beasts, which allowed Austin to safely survive and grow up.\nBut who would have known that such a big pit was hidden here as well, first being the remnant of some Gold Level Great Mage, followed by the Blood Claw Tribe, and later on even a mercenary squad. It made things incredibly frustrating for Austin.\nHowever, now that the Dragon Nest Tribe has already taken root here and started various farmland clearings, they cannot easily relocate. Even if they wanted to move, the stored food wouldn’t be enough to sustain them until they find another base for farming and producing crops, so there’s no choice but to continue on this path.\n\"Hmph, if I were given a bit more time to develop, what does it matter if there are greater dangers and challenges!\"\nHe was able to create such a powerful tribe from scratch in just over a year. If he had a little more time, the strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe would be even greater, so why would he fear anything?\nMoreover, now that he has reached quasi-Gold Level strength after awakening from his slumber, coupled with the assistance of numerous trained clansmen under his command, he has sufficient power to protect himself within the scope of the Kawa Great Forest.\n\"However, perhaps now is the time to explore the secrets at the bottom of the lake...\"\nAfter pondering for a moment, Austin leaped up and flew toward the lake reservoir.\nWhoa!\nUpon reaching the sky above the lake reservoir, Austin plunged into the water, causing a huge splash.\nIn the world beneath the lake, with no more ferocious predators like Ghost-headed Crocodiles, the fish swimming in the water had increased, but the moment Austin entered the water, the fish immediately scattered in all directions.\n\"Perhaps, I could try container-style fish farming, and as for the boxes, I could simply weave them from bamboo or make them from rattan...\"\nWatching the large school of fish scatter around, Austin mused to himself.\nHowever, there’s no need to rush this matter too much; after all, in the coming cold winter, he could still obtain a large amount of fish through ice fishing.\nShifting his thoughts, Austin no longer lingered and swam toward the depths of the lake.\nThis was already Austin’s second descent to the bottom of this lake reservoir. The first time was after he had slain the Ghost-headed Crocodile, and he had come here to investigate, but during that occasion, he was put to shame and fled due to the dandelion-like plants at the bottom of the lake.\nThis time, the underwater environment hadn’t changed much.\nOn the lake bed, dandelion-like magical plants gently swayed with the water currents, emitting an eerie blue glow. Blue seeds detached from their parent plants, gathering together in the water current, forming bands of light as brilliant as a stellar river, swirling above the lake bed, flickering on and off.\n\"This should be the Ghost Grass mentioned in the notes... Power of the World... what is buried beneath here?\"\nAustin hovered above for a long time, but he ultimately didn’t venture down to explore. The embarrassing scene from that day was still fresh in his memory.\nNevertheless, this time, Austin had a vague feeling that perhaps once he successfully advanced to Gold Level, he could use the abilities of a Giant Dragon to successfully break through the Ghost Grass’s blockade.\nIf that’s the case, then further exploration will have to be postponed for another time.\nWith his rate of growth and the magic stones in the Spider Cave, as long as he could digest it all, reaching Gold Level wouldn’t take too long. He could afford to wait.\nSince that’s how things stood, staying here held no further purpose. Austin swiftly flew out of the lake reservoir.\n...\n\"Your highness, those mercenaries are not weak, and guarding them requires more than one Dragon Vein Beastman to be stationed, which has somewhat weakened the tribe’s strength. Since they are of no use, should we just kill them directly to save manpower and food?\"\nWhen Austin returned from beneath the reservoir to the Dragon Nest Tribe, Vini, the Kobold who temporarily assumed the highest governance of the Dragon Nest Tribe, came to report.\nAfter awakening, Austin had used the thunder amassed in the sky through tremendous Magic Power to unleash the Thunder Strike spell. Although it had a substantial scope for clearing troops, its power was still debatable, resulting in the majority of these mercenaries being captured by the Dragon Nest Beastmen rather than killed.\nHowever, humans have changeable natures, unlike the simple-minded beasts, and it’s difficult to transform them like the Dragon Nest Beastmen. Also, guarding them has exhausted much of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s strength, so Vini came to inquire if they should just execute them to avoid wasting labor and food.\n\"No, these guys almost destroyed my tribe. How could I let them die so easily?\"\nDeath is the easiest punishment, and moreover, even if mercenaries like Mercenary Captain Valen and others are tough and refuse to submit, there are certainly those who fear death and are willing to kneel.\nHaving ventured from the Human World into the depths of the Kawa Great Forest, they have proven themselves to have some strength and decent survival skills, making them quite helpful to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nWhat Austin valued even more, however, was the information in their minds, like maps, the distribution of various forces, and information about the Human World. Given Austin’s current situation, this type of information is hard to come by, but with these captured mercenaries, it becomes possible.\nEven if they are as tough as Mercenary Captain Valen, there is still a value in exploiting them. They can be directly deployed into roles requiring laborious production, contributing to the building of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nOf course, even those who are soft-spined need a bit of pounding before they can be used.\nAt least, they should be worked to the bone as slaves for a month, after which those willing to bow their heads can be singled out for ideological reform.\nAfter all, it’s very likely they will have future dealings with the Human World, so it’s good to prepare in advance.\n\"But your highness, if that’s the case, we will need more hands to guard them.\"\nKobold Vini seemed a bit troubled. In any case, these mercenaries are all elites. If they find a chance to escape during work, their level of power alone cannot be suppressed.\nIn that case, it would be counterproductive.\n\"No worries, I already have a solution for that problem.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 135: Chapter 131: Preparations Before Refining Copper (First Update - Seeking Subscription)\nThese mercenaries are no ordinary people. The strongest Mercenary Captain, Valen, even possesses Silver Low Tier strength, a power considered top-notch in some cities on the borders of the Southern Countries. The entire Mercenary Corps is not just any ordinary group; simply binding them with ropes makes it easy for them to break free and escape, hence a considerable amount of manpower is needed for their guard.\nOnly a new material, one more resilient than rope and suitable for making shackles, can reduce the need for a large number of Beastmen to guard them.\nRegarding that material, Austin recalled a certain plan from not long ago — refining copper!\nThe initial conflict with the Blood Claw Tribe Branch was over a Copper Ore vein near the Blood Claw Tribe’s mountain. After the Blood Claw Tribe was defeated, Austin fell into slumber, delaying the commencement of copper refining due to personal reasons.\nNow that Austin has awakened, everything in the Dragon Nest Tribe is back on a normal development track, and refining copper naturally becomes part of future plans.\nOnce copper artifacts are produced, the Dragon Nest Tribe’s combat and production capabilities will significantly improve, playing an unrivaled role in the tribe’s development.\nThe preparations for winter have largely been completed by the Dragon Nest Tribe. Crops like kudzu root in the fields are mostly harvested, while perennial plants such as Thorn Fruits are covered with a thick layer of straw to prevent them from freezing. Various fodders are prepared in the livestock enclosures, enough for the wild cattle in the barn as well as other livestock like wild rabbits and wild boars to overwinter. If feed runs short, they would simply slaughter some livestock when they are fattened up.\nAs for the damaged houses within the Dragon Nest Tribe, due to the necessity to air-dry the newly made mud bricks before firing them in the kiln, there’s no quick way to produce enough materials, so this has to be done gradually.\nWith plenty of manpower now available among the clan members, Austin gathered a large population to first refine some copper artifacts before the cold winter.\nThus, under comprehensive deployment, a large number of Beastmen transported a massive amount of charcoal down from the previous Smoke Tower hill. Using wild cattle to transport it to the Blood Claw Tribe Branch, where the Dragon Nest Beastmen have cleared up the place, built a base on the ruins. This base, centered for future copper refining activities, is directly named the Copper Mine Base by Austin.\nA large amount of charcoal was transported to the Copper Mine Base, and simultaneously, Beastmen were dispatched there to start massive mining of Copper Ore from the surrounding Copper Mine veins.\nIt is worth mentioning that the captured mercenaries are one of the teams responsible for mining Copper Ore, assigned to the dirtiest and most exhausting tasks, leaving them dead tired every day. Although some mercenaries attempted to escape, they were thwarted by the Dragon Nest Beastmen. The one who attempted to escape suffered frightful punishment — collective isolation in the dark room!\nMinotaur Saru, one of the guards, didn’t know what it felt like to be isolated in the dark room, but every mercenary who emerged from it appeared overwhelmingly grateful, diligently working from then on, with no hint of slacking off.\nVast quantities of Copper Ore were mined, piling up into small hills nearby.\nSimultaneously, not far from the base, guided by the Goblin engineers in the Manufacturing Workshop, high furnaces of various sizes and shapes were erected, some one to two meters, others two to three meters — five in total, primarily to test which design performed best before determining the optimal model for mass production.\nWith charcoal, high furnaces, and Copper Ore all prepared, everything was ready; however, just as Austin prepared to begin refining copper,\nthe cold winter,\ndescended once again overnight.\nThe chilling Water Attribute cold wave from the endless ocean swept across the sky and earth like a tidal tsunami overnight. The sky, encased in somber clouds, saw vast snowflakes descending, carrying a bitter cold wave, transforming the entire land into a silver-clad landscape overnight.\n\"Alas, we can only halt for a while,\"\nInside Dragon Nest, watching the massive snowfall and the transformation of the land into azure icy waterscapes by the distant cold wave, Austin could only helplessly stay inside Dragon Nest, waiting for the passing of the cold wave.\nA cold wave that could transform the previous heat into a snow-clad winter wonderland overnight was something ordinary Beastmen could never withstand.\nIn the first few days of the cold winter, the world-freezing cold flow on the sky occasionally cascaded down to earth by air currents, risking freezing any creature caught in it into an ice sculpture. Only by staying indoors, insulated by the walls, could one survive until the falling cold air was neutralized by the ground temperature.\nThe frightening cold wave descending from the sky was referred to by the Beastmen living in the Kawa Great Forest as \"the colorless Death God from the heavens.\" Some Beastmen call it the \"Wingless Angel,\" descending silently and invisibly, unpredictable, rendering everything into ice sculptures before one could notice, truly terrifying and impossible to guard against.\nAlthough this dreadful cold wave was threatening, it mostly resided thousands of meters high in the atmosphere, occurring with a low probability, and usually only existed in the initial days of the cold winter.\nWith time, the terrifying cold currents in the sky gradually dissipate, leaving the outside world white and snowy, yet losing the immediate threat of freezing into ice sculptures by falling cold streams.\nDespite the low occurrence, its existence was undeniable. Austin had no intention of needlessly sacrificing his clan members; waiting a few days wasn’t a chore, hence no further actions were taken until the cold wave subsided, restarting copper refining.\nDuring the initial days of cold winter, there was little to accomplish; Beastmen mostly stayed indoors, with even outdoor training canceled, resorting to practicing their Breathing Technique indoors.\nAustin was not idle either. Seizing these leisurely days, he repeatedly stimulated his body muscles with currents generated by his Magic Power, trying to control the massively surged Magic Power post-awakening.\nAustin didn’t know why his growth was so fast, achieving years’ progress rivaling that of a typical dragon juvenile over two to three decades, but he was certain that the self-developed current stimulation exercise played a significant role in his growth.",

      "content": "Chapter 136: Chapter 132 Speculation (2nd update, please subscribe)\nZzz....\nInside the Dragon’s Nest, a gigantic shadow nearly filled the entire space. Arcs of electric sparks blossomed, tearing through the darkness with blinding light, and a piercing noise spread like the chirping of thousands of birds.\nElectric light wove through the air, forming rings that hovered around Austin’s body, rising and falling, while fine streaks of electricity danced between the azure scales, stimulating cellular growth at a microscopic level, resulting in mysterious and profound transformations.\nFrom a distance, it seemed like a giant beast controlling the thunder and lightning, lurking within the shadows, harboring an unimaginably terrifying thunder power.\n\"Roar... Seems like it’s already at the limit....\"\nAfter a long time, Austin ceased the electric stimulation around him and let out a low growl, secretly pondering in his heart.\nPreviously, using electric stimulation on his body, he could vaguely feel physical growth and the changes in Magic Power, but now it seemed to have reached a bottleneck. Despite continuous days of electrical stimulation, there was no noticeable change.\nIt’s like reaching a limit where no amount of training leads to growth.\n\"Oh well, it’s not bad as it is now.\" Below the Gold level, one can still stimulate growth through electricity, but after reaching Gold, it seems to touch upon certain domains not easily surpassed by mere cellular growth.\nTo have grown so swiftly within two or three years with this cheat-like speed is a great gain. Even if there’s no such fortune in the future, Austin feels he’s already profited and sees no cause for regret.\n\"However, perhaps electric stimulation is one reason for quick growth; my soul might be another.\"\nAustin pondered silently in his heart,\nElectricity can activate the Magic Power within magic stones, and through the inherent Authority of the giant dragon, it can activate the Extraordinary Seed in a common beastman, making them an Extraordinary Ability User. Thus, it’s not implausible for electricity to kindle the dormant Magic Power inside a giant dragon, significantly stimulating cellular growth.\nYet, if simple electricity could make a young dragon grow, this method would have been widespread among adult dragons over the millennia. But in Austin’s dragon inheritance, there’s no information on this, suggesting he might be an exception—perhaps due to the strength of his soul.\nOf course, it might also be because dragons are naturally lazy. Given their innate advantage, being Legendary as adults, there’s no need to train during youth. Even being a slacker dragon, reaching a certain level leads to Legendary. Why strive, thus never discovering this secret?\n\"Forget it, these aren’t things I can delve into now; I’ll ponder it if I can understand it later.\"\nQuickly, Austin set aside these many thoughts.\nThough faced with a bottleneck and unable to break through quickly, Austin wasn’t anxious.\nAfter his slumber, his strength had transformed dramatically. If facing Grom the grizzly bear from a month ago, there’s no need to use the electromagnetic cannon to crush him.\nThis is the dragon’s advantage; challenging above their class is one of the talents a dragon possesses as part of its Legendary Bloodline.\nBesides, growth will naturally lead to breakthroughs in due time, so there’s no need to rush.\n....\nAfter a few days of secluded cultivation outside the Dragon’s Nest, the passing cold front had mostly worn out. In the next three months, the whole world would fall into a cold, snowy landscape, covered entirely by ice and snow.\nBut no matter how cold, it wouldn’t be like the lethal chill occasionally falling from thousands of meters high during the onset of the cold winter.\nAs time passed, various ferocious hunters like ferocious beasts and giant beasts that hadn’t prepared for the cold winter would begin to roam the icy land, making it extremely dangerous. However, for the current Dragon Nest Tribe, it wasn’t much of a concern. At least those fierce hunters couldn’t amount to anything before the colorless Death God, which they couldn’t possibly withstand.\nDuring this time, Austin also continued his copper refining work.\nIf they could produce copper artifacts, it would mean the Dragon Nest Tribe officially entering the Metal Age, significantly improving work efficiency compared to the previous Stone Tool Age.\nNot to mention if the Dragon Nest Legion could be clad in Copper Armor with bronze weapons, their strength could increase by several times. Just the production of various bronze tools, like copper sickles, axes, hoes, and bronze plows, would greatly advance the Dragon Nest Tribe’s various reclamation and production work.\nIt’s important to note that the Dragon Nest Tribe still relied on a mix of stone and wooden tools. Even if the wooden spears were made from tough materials, wooden tools lack the durability of stone or metal, especially hunting wooden spears, which would often be scrapped in one expedition, keeping the Goblin Manufacturing Workshop at full production capacity.\nAs for Stone Tools, never mind the difficulty in crafting them, a stone hoe could chip when it hits a rock in the soil, greatly hindering production efficiency. Furthermore, stone tools are hard to manufacture, accounting for a minimal portion of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s equipment.\nThough several iron weapons were captured in battles, they aren’t much use for daily production in the Dragon Nest Tribe. Maintenance of iron weapons is also an issue in the tropical rainforest climate of the Kawa Great Forest.\nIf they could independently produce bronze, it would massively boost the Dragon Nest Tribe’s production and combat capabilities, marking an overall transition from the Stone Tool to Metal Age.\nThis is one of the reasons Austin took charge of this project personally.\nOf course, the most crucial reason remains that, aside from Austin himself, no one in the Dragon Nest Tribe knows how to refine copper....\nOf course, Austin didn’t know how to refine copper either.\nIn his past life, he once saw a video online where an expert smelted iron in the wild with bare hands, a process that was so stunning that he vaguely remembered some steps.\nThough refining copper isn’t the same as refining iron, both are metals, so they should be similar, right?",

      "content": "Chapter 137: Chapter 133: The Terrible \"Death God\" (3rd update, requesting recommendations)\nIt was learned from the knowledge of the previous life that the melting point of copper is lower than that of iron. Since that man built a blast furnace with clay and refined iron with charcoal, using the blast furnace to refine copper should also work.\nCopper artifacts are too important for the development of the Dragon Nest Tribe. One could say it is a crucial material that changes the civilization’s production of the Dragon Nest Tribe. Even if the first batch fails to produce copper, even if constant attempts are needed, Austin is determined to produce bronze before this harsh winter ends.\nAfter several efforts, the organization level of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe has already become high. With Austin deciding to restart the copper refining work, hundreds of beastmen were organized to cross roads blocked by snow and wind, heading towards the bronze ore base.\nFortunately, all the necessary preparations were completed initially. Charcoal, the blast furnace, and copper ore were all ready. Now, it’s only a matter of experimenting before moving into mass production.\nDuring this harsh winter, because ice and snow have frozen the ground, many things couldn’t unfold, with virtually nothing urgent to do.\nJust like the reconstruction work on houses, due to the cold winter’s freeze, as soon as water is splashed outside, it freezes into ice, making it impossible to work mud or dry it. Thus, brick making can’t continue.\nFortunately, there’s no need to worry too much about fire disasters during the cold winter. The beastmen can construct temporary wooden and grass structures to barely get through this harsh winter. After all, many houses of the Dragon Nest Tribe were burnt down in the previous mercenary attack. Although squeezing into the remaining houses can accommodate people, it is quite cramped.\nThe arrival of the cold winter brought problems not only with bricks not being able to be made and houses difficult to rebuild, but also with the extreme cold making the ground as hard as iron, making cultivation work impossible. Many work progress halted during this winter.\nHowever, the arrival of winter isn’t entirely without benefit. At least, after the ice sheet freezes nearby lakes and reservoirs, the beastmen can start to fish by cutting through the ice. Due to last year’s vast planting and harvesting of arrowroot, there was also a large yield of kudzu vines.\nThese kudzu vines couldn’t just be set ablaze. Once the leaves were stripped off, the vines were boiled in a water tank to remove the flesh, then the leftover fibers were picked out and dried. Skilled female beastmen would then weave them into ropes. These ropes, whether for making nets or any other purpose, become extremely robust tools.\nAustin actually remembers that hemp ropes were made from a plant called hemp. However, since Austin is not an omniscient god, he only knows the name and has never seen what it looks like in his previous life, making it hard to find a similar plant in this world.\nBut although hemp wasn’t found, the kudzu vines contain very tough plant fibers. After such processing, the ropes made are roughly similar in toughness to authentic hemp ropes.\nRecently, the beastmen in the manufacturing workshop came up with an idea of weaving nets with the rope, then placing heavy stones along the edges of the nets. This way, when the net is cast over a river, the weight of the stones causes the edges to quickly sink, with the middle part forming a gap like an inverted cover falling from the water’s surface, capturing more fish.\nAustin isn’t aware of this improved fishing net. If he were to see it, he would find it surprisingly similar to the fishing nets used by small private fishermen families along the river in his previous life.\nThese developments have never been taught by Austin, indicating that goblins are slowly entering a stage of self-reflection and research rather than relying entirely on Austin’s reproductions of techniques from his past life. Developing self-innovative abilities marks a solid beginning.\n...\nThis time, Austin only took a hundred or so beastmen from the Dragon Nest Tribe for copper refining, considering the need to guard the Dragon Nest Base, and initial tests and experiments were required before large-scale production could commence, so not many beastmen were needed. A hundred was already quite a number.\nAfter traveling over twenty miles, Austin mainly flew through the sky to prevent dreadful hunters like giant beasts or magic beasts from tracking them.\nFortunately, the path was uneventful. After spending most of the day, the beastmen safely arrived at the bronze ore base.\nHowever, when everyone arrived, the sight before them left all the beastmen shocked.\nIce, a pale blue layer of ice covered the entire valley. Trees appeared as if they were ice sculptures or amber, thick layers of ice encased them.\nOther places were generally covered in heavy snow, but here it was all ice. The whole valley was frozen as if even snowflakes became one with the ice, creating a dazzling crystalline world that revealed a frightening and silent stillness.\nThe dreadful chill still pervaded the surroundings, with the cold penetrating to the bone. Breathing in made it feel as if the nose had gone numb from freezing, and the lungs felt like they were being cut by blades.\n\"Colorless Death, huh...\"\nAustin kicked up large swathes of snowflakes, landing on the ground from the sky, looking towards the frozen valley terrain ahead, already understanding what had happened here.\nWhen the cold winter suddenly came, with a terrifying cold front surging from tens of thousands of meters in the sky, a portion of the cold stream in the sky abruptly collapsed, with an alarming coldness pouring down from the heavens like a waterfall, freezing the entire valley into ice sculptures!\nOnly such a cold stream, falling from tens of thousands of meters high, would cause what the beastmen referred to as \"Colorless Death,\" \"the wingless angel fallen from heaven\" to create such a terrifying spectacle—an entire valley encased in an iron-like ice sheet, with life nearly extinct.\nThis descending cold stream was truly horrific, its chill even killing plants in hibernation. Even after winter has passed and life reawakens, this valley terrain would still be filled with the deathly color of barren grey and yellow, as the coldness has slain even the plants that grew here.\nThis was Austin’s first time facing such a powerful cold stream of Colorless Death.\n\"Let’s go, let’s gather with the others first.\"\nThis valley was merely a place to store charcoal and copper ore, while the base where the remaining beastmen resided was not far off at the ruins of the Blood Claw Tribe Branch. Luckily, the collapsing cold stream did not reach the rebuilt living site at the Blood Claw Tribe Branch remains, allowing the beastmen stationed there to escape a calamity.\nOf course, if there was a sufficiently dense house and a fire inside, this so-called \"Colorless Death\" would not be so lethal for the beastmen living inside.\n...\nPS: The third finished. Please vote for recommendations, monthly tickets, and give us some rewards.",

      "content": "Chapter 138: Chapter 134 Opening the Furnace\nThe colorless Death God is nothing more than an avalanche-like cold current. However, this avalanche occurs high in the sky at an altitude of thousands of meters, and when this cold current falls from the sky and sweeps across the earth, freezing everything within its range, it dissipates in no more than a day.\nTherefore, if living beings reside in houses or caves, the insulation provided by those structures would protect them from the short-lived cold current, especially since the location where the Dragon Nest Beastmen reside, the remnant site of the Blood Claw Tribe, is not the center of the cold current’s impact.\nAs expected, Austin quickly found the Dragon Nest Beastmen remaining at the base, totaling more than two hundred people, among which were captured mercenaries brought here for mining.\nDue to the unforeseen arrival of the cold winter, over two hundred Dragon Nest Beastmen were trapped here. Fortunately, after the destruction of the Blood Claw Tribe Branch, there remained plenty of building materials on the site, so there was no major concern about materials for building houses. Additionally, since a large amount of food was stored in the Blood Claw Tribe Branch at the time, which the Dragon Nest Tribe temporarily did not value or want to transport over twenty miles to the Dragon Nest Base, the entire tribe base was stocked with food sufficient for the Dragon Nest Beastmen’s consumption.\nAlthough the cold winter arrived suddenly, cutting off contact with the Dragon Nest Tribe, under the surveillance of the Dragon Nest Beastmen, coupled with the terrifying dangers hidden in the snowy and icy exterior, and considering that these mercenary captives were exhausted after several days of intensive mining work, with their strength less than thirty percent of its original capacity, and were guarded by several Extraordinary Beastmen, no trouble was made by them.\nIn fact, if these mercenary captives resisted, not to mention their poor chances of success, even if they did escape, it would be impossible to find enough food on the snow-covered land, combined with the extremely cold weather, basically leading to certain death. Staying behind offered at least a chance of survival.\nThe two hundred Beastmen remaining at the base were integrated with the hundred Beastmen brought by Austin, forming a small team of three hundred Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nIn this copper refining work, these three hundred Dragon Nest Beastmen were the main labor force.\nThe preliminary preparation for copper refining was nearly complete. A large amount of charcoal, copper ore, and the blast furnace were ready. In fact, if not for the sudden arrival of the cold winter that day, the copper refining could have started the next day.\n\"This weather... I wonder if we can even refine the copper.\"\nIn the sky above, thick clouds gathered, and large flakes of snow fell, covering the ground. Fortunately, after an entire day, the cold current within the base valley began to dissipate. However, clearing the ice layer extending over the blast furnace and charcoal ore piles was quite laborious.\n\"Let’s build a canopy to shield against the heavy snow first.\"\nWatching the Beastmen mumbling as they cleared the ice and snow around them in the heavy snow, Austin furrowed his brow. In such heavy snow, not to mention starting a fire, even if the blast furnace were lit, the snowflakes falling from the sky might negatively impact the copper refining process.\nMoreover, working in such heavy snow was indeed challenging for the Beastmen.\nTherefore, some of the Beastmen were quickly assigned to go to the remnants of the Blood Claw Tribe to collect remaining building materials, bring them back to the valley, and then set up simple canopies to shield the blast furnaces from the heavy snow.\nIn this cold winter, the ground was nearly frozen as hard as stone, making it difficult to dig holes for wooden stakes. Fortunately, there were several Extraordinary individuals among the three hundred Beastmen. With their strength, using stones to break the frozen ground was barely manageable.\nBefore long, the Dragon Nest Beastmen had erected a simple frame for a canopy, then laid a large amount of thatch over the wooden frame’s top, and covered three sides to form a simple shelter against the snow.\nMeanwhile,\nOther Beastmen had cleared the ice layer covering the charcoal and ore piles, moving the materials inside the canopy.\n\"Start the furnace!\"\nSeeing the preparations complete, Austin did not hesitate and ordered the furnace to be lit.\nOriginally, after the materials were prepared that day, the copper refining could have started. Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate, with the sudden arrival of the cold winter and the descending cold current, causing many problems that required further attention.\nHowever, regardless of these troubles, the copper refining must begin. The Dragon Nest Beastmen were not short on strength, but the pioneering work had been delayed due to a lack of suitable tools. Entering the metal age would offer great benefits in terms of both strength and productivity for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nUnder Austin’s command, the Beastmen put the charcoal into the earthen blast furnace through the top opening. Once the charcoal filled one-fifth of the furnace, they added several pieces of copper ore, then covered it with more charcoal, repeating the process—layering charcoal and copper ore—before finally covering the top opening with charcoal as well.\nSimultaneously, the Fox-faced Man Quik stepped out from the group. In this snowy, icy environment, lighting a fire with flint or wood was virtually impossible. Fortunately, Quik had a scepter capable of initiating the Flame Burst Technique, used here as an ignition source.\nIndeed, Quik had the potential of a Warlock. With continuous cultivation after obtaining these magical artifacts, he could now simply control their power.\nBuzzing sounds!\nQuik raised his scepter, a faint red glow flickered within, and visible ripples of air undulated around the Red Crystal, as Fire Attribute Magic Power in the air began to concentrate.\nThe next moment,\nWhoosh!\nA scorching line of fire shot out from the Red Crystal, entering through the bottom vent and striking the charcoal at the base of the earthen blast furnace. Instantly, a visible flame blazed fiercely.\nThe line of fire persisted for a while, stopping only when the charcoal at the furnace’s base glowed red.\n\"Good, start the bellows!\"\nImmediately, a robust Beastman stepped forward, placed a makeshift bellows over the vent, and began vigorously operating it. As the air flowed in, the entire earthen blast furnace quickly roared into a blaze, with dazzling light shining through its cracks into everyone’s eyes.\nWhen that robust Beastman tired, another took his place, continuing the cycle. After about an hour, the charcoal inside the earthen blast furnace was mostly burned up.",

      "content": "Chapter 139: Chapter 135: Improvement\n\"How is it?\"\nAs the charcoal burned out inside the earthen high furnace, the entire furnace was more than half empty. However, with the wood ash covering it, it was impossible to see the condition at the bottom.\nAt this moment, the charcoal had just burned out, and it was still very hot around the earthen high furnace. So, even though the Dragon Nest Beastmen were a bit anxious, they had to stand aside and wait for the furnace to cool down.\nFortunately, the cold winter had its advantages. The very hot earthen high furnace soon cooled down.\nQuik touched the wall of the earthen high furnace and, seeing that it wasn’t too hot, reached into the vent below and pulled aside the tiles, revealing a sizable opening at the base of the furnace.\nReaching in through that opening, he took out one of the block-like objects beneath the wood ash, blew on it, and cleaned off the ash, revealing the yellow surface of the copper.\nHowever, looking at this \"copper block,\" Austin was not very pleased and instead frowned.\n\"Take out all the copper ore inside.\"\nFollowing Austin’s order, the Fox-faced Man Quik reached into the furnace and took out several pieces of ore from the bottom.\nIt failed!\nLooking at these half-copper, half-iron ores, Austin clearly understood that his first attempt at refining copper had failed.\nHe took one of the semi-finished products and squeezed it hard with his claw. It immediately crumbled like dirt, revealing the stone inside the thin layer of copper.\nThe copper inside the copper ore was only half-melted and did not separate from the impurities within, resulting in these semi-finished products.\n\"The temperature wasn’t high enough.\"\nThe temperature inside the earthen high furnace only caused the metal copper in the ore to become semi-fluid without melting into liquid, which failed to separate it from the stone and other impurities.\n\"No, could it be that too much copper ore was added?\"\nLooking at the failed copper ore in his hand, Austin was puzzled. The furnace design and method of refining copper ore were basically copied from a method he saw in his past life where an expert refined iron with bare hands. Since that expert could refine iron this way, and copper melts at a lower point than iron, why couldn’t this earthen furnace refine copper?\n\"Or, is it because of the different conditions in the Otherworld?\"\nMany ideas arose in his mind.\nThe heavy snow was still pouring down from the sky, and the shelter the Dragon Nest Beastmen built to shield the earthen high furnace from rain and snow wasn’t large, thus Austin’s body was exposed outside.\nThe snow was so heavy that Austin’s back was soon covered in snow. With a shake of his shoulders, the snow on top fell off with a rustle.\nWatching the snowflakes falling around him, Austin suddenly had a sudden inspiration.\nSnow,\nYes, it’s the snow!\nIn that video, the expert refined iron by sourcing materials in the forest during hot summer days. However, Austin was currently in the bone-chilling winter!\nAustin’s eyes suddenly brightened as he guessed the reason why the first batch of copper failed.\nIt was the temperature!\nThe vent at the furnace’s base was meant to allow continuous airflow, bringing in a large amount of oxygen with the air to promote the burning of charcoal inside the furnace, thereby significantly increasing the temperature inside the earthen furnace.\nHowever, Austin neglected that when the air entered the furnace, it also took away the heat generated by the burning charcoal.\nUnder normal conditions, the heat carried away by the wind is much less than the heat released by rapid oxidation and combustion of charcoal, resulting in a significant increase in furnace temperature due to the air blast.\nBut now, it’s not normal, but a frigid winter with temperatures dropping to minus twenty or even thirty degrees. Such icy air being blown into the furnace, even though the large amount of oxygen brought by the wind makes the charcoal burn more vigorously and generate more heat, the cold wind also carries away a large amount of heat, causing the furnace to be cooler, and thus unable to refine copper from copper ore.\n\"This is problematic...\"\nThe current situation made Austin scratch his head, not realizing how much the cold winter would impact copper smelting.\nHowever, having discovered the issue, the solution was clear.\nIt’s best to preheat the air before blowing it in, although it sounds simple, doing it is much trickier.\nThe original primitive blower was connected to the vent, and to preheat, Austin had to return to the Dragon Nest Tribe to get a ceramic pipe from the Goblins’ Manufacturing Workshop. This ceramic pipe was something the Goblins made after mastering porcelain making, only to find it useless and left it idle. Various other miscellaneous \"artworks\" were also left in a corner, and it took some effort from Austin to find it.\nUsing this ceramic pipe to connect the vent and the blower as a passageway between the two, meanwhile, Austin instructed the Beastmen to pile charcoal and firewood outside the ceramic pipe as fuel to heat it. This way, by the time the air flows through the ceramic pipe to the furnace vent, it would naturally get heated to some extent.\nAlthough the constant airflow would prevent this method from heating the inflow air to any significant temperature, it would still fare better than air at minus twenty or thirty degrees.\nAfter a round of redesigning and modifying the setup, by the time the earthen high furnace was filled with charcoal again, it was already nightfall.\nAlthough eager to see the results of the modifications, with temperature dropping further at night and the strong external winds, it wasn’t a good time for copper smelting. Such time was bearable, so Austin ordered the Beastmen to have their meals and rest.\nA night without words, and the copper refining continued the next day.\nIgniting, heating the ceramic pipe, blowing air... step by step, the Beastmen waited quietly nearby, and the heat from the furnace made the surrounding air less icy.\nWith the Beastmen’s diligent cooperation, two hours later, the charcoal inside the furnace was almost burnt out, leaving only a small portion.\nAustin and the Beastmen waited nearby. Before long, the charcoal inside the furnace was reduced to ashes, and half an hour later, the extremely hot furnace cooled down.\nThen, a Beastman voluntarily opened the furnace base, took out what was inside.\n\"Success!\"\nWith a strong blow, a rugged, irregular, dull yellow copper block appeared in front of them.\nLooking at the copper block in the Beastman’s hands, after overcoming numerous challenges, they finally succeeded. A sense of satisfaction welled up within Austin.\nHowever, he quickly thought of another problem.\nThe copper was now refined, but how could they make weapons?",

      "content": "Chapter 140: Chapter 136 Difficulties\nIf it were iron, subsequent forging would be necessary to form various weapons and tools, whereas copper is cast with molten copper.\nHowever, casting itself is a hassle. Not to mention how to extract the molten copper from the high-temperature earthen furnace and pour it into molds promptly. In the current cold winter, the frigid air would immediately cool the molten copper upon contact, making casting even more challenging.\n\"Alas, what a pain!\"\nIt was only now that Austin recalled the video he watched in his previous life. In it, the man who refined iron with bare hands in the wild just ended up with a chunk of iron without any method of forging it into weapons and tools afterward.\nAnd now, although copper has been refined, everything that follows can only be designed by himself. Unfortunately, Austin isn’t very skilled in these engineering designs.\nAfter pondering for an entire hour, Austin came up with various improvement methods in his mind. Although these methods appeared rather crude, they all had some potential for realization.\nHowever, these methods all require the creation of new ceramic modules.\nUnder normal circumstances, he could have simply instructed the goblins to create the envisioned modules according to his ideas. But now it’s cold winter, outside it’s so cold the water freezes instantly, and even the first step of pottery-making—mixing clay—is impossible. Water added to the soil quickly crystallizes and precipitates from the mud, depriving it of any adhesive properties, and the entire mass freezes into a block of ice. In this situation, the first step of creating ceramic modules fails, making it impossible to produce them.\nBesides the module issue, there are many improvements to be made to the earthen furnace, causing Austin to furrow his brows deeply.\nThus, Austin briefly explained various rough principles and then left the follow-up tasks to the goblins in the manufacturing workshop.\nAfter all, the copper has been refined; how to make weapons and tools from copper blocks is merely a matter of time. Once the goblins have tried several times, they are bound to produce these copper-made weapons and tools.\nAfter explaining all the upcoming directions in detail, Austin led the two hundred Dragon Nest Beastmen back to the Dragon Nest Base.\nThis was also Austin’s mistake. Without personal experience, he thought refining copper would be easy, believing that one or two successful furnaces could lead to large-scale copper industry, equipping the entire Dragon Nest Tribe with newly-made weapons and tools in a short time. But he didn’t expect it to be fraught with difficulties, and the initial goal was only half completed.\nWhat follows is continuous experimentation to find a method to manufacture suitable weapons and tools during the cold winter. Completing such trials is impossible within one or two months.\nSince it’s an experiment, there’s no need to station too many Beastmen here, wasting manpower.\nThus, there wasn’t much point in leaving too many Dragon Nest Beastmen, so Austin took two hundred Beastmen back, leaving about a hundred to be stationed there long-term.\nThis failure served as a reminder to Austin that one shouldn’t act too rashly. This time bringing so many Beastmen only proved to be a minor inconvenience. If it were an issue of life and death, the consequences would have been much more severe.\nOf course, upon leaving, Austin also took the mercenary captives away from the Copper Ore Base, otherwise, controlling these individuals with only a hundred Dragon Nest Beastmen would be somewhat challenging.\nSeveral days later, after organizing everything, Austin led the large group away from the Copper Ore Base, embarking on the journey back to the Dragon Nest Tribe Base.\nThis copper refining wasn’t a complete failure, at least copper has been separated from the copper ore. It’s just that due to the cold weather, progressing to the next step of forging is difficult.\nActually, if it weren’t for the cold winter, Austin believes staying there for one or two more days would naturally yield a forging method. But now, he could only leave it to the goblins to manage themselves.\n...\nThe Copper Ore Base isn’t far from the Dragon Nest Tribe, about twenty miles. The Dragon Nest Beastmen can cover that distance in about an hour if they hurry. Although the heavy snowfall slowed them down, half a day’s journey sufficed to return the main group to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nNothing major happened within the tribe. As the cold winter began, nearly ten days had passed. The thousands of meters-high cold winds in the sky have been exhausted, and the snowfall has significantly reduced. Though still cold, it’s not as freezing as the first couple of days.\nThe dangerous phase has passed, so during this slower period of cold winter, groups of Beastmen were brought out for large-scale drills. Moreover, the daily military training increased, ensuring the breathing technique training wasn’t overlooked.\nOverlooking the vast open ground, Austin found his mind relaxing as he saw disciplined and uniformly moving elite Beastmen units.\nFrom above, previously forested wasteland stretches outward with rows of houses, forming a small city within the Kawa Great Forest.\nOn the vast snowy ground, the well-trained Beastmen formed a dense black sea, creating a thunderous roar.\nFurther away, fields under cultivation stretched outward.\nTwo years ago, this was a rippling unbroken green baren forest, and now, it had been transformed by Austin’s hands, creating a tribe, a city on this wilderness land.\nAlthough in the entire process of establishing the tribe and later military training, Austin rarely participated, the origins of all this—from military reform, system determination, land cultivation—everything began with Austin. He brought the seeds of his past civilization here, nurtured them, enabling them to flourish and eventually grow to the current state, possibly even into mighty trees in the future.\nSince copper refining can’t be achieved in one go, and the development of the Dragon Nest Tribe has entered the right track, Austin started considering ways to enhance his strength.\nAlthough there won’t be many dangers for the Dragon Nest Tribe in the short term, there is a great secret hidden in the lake near the tribe, which during his last underwater venture, his sixth sense told him that breaking through the peculiar plants known as ghost grasses and seeing the deepest secret inside required reaching gold level life and the natural aptitude of a giant dragon.\nAustin is very intrigued by what might be hidden in there.",

      "content": "Chapter 141: Chapter 137 Otto\nIt’s been more than ten days since the arrival of the cold winter. The heavy snow in the sky, initially driven by the turbulent magic power tide, has now settled down, no longer carrying the fierce momentum that seemed to bury the entire world.\nNonetheless, the entire land is wrapped in a blanket of silver, completely covered by the vast expanse of white.\nThough the snow in the sky continues to fall, it has become much lighter. Meanwhile, the thick clouds that covered the sky for over ten days are starting to dissipate and thin out, suggesting that perhaps in a few days, the Kawa Great Forest, frozen for nearly half a month, might see a short period of sunlight.\n\"Gulu, it’s really comfortable!\"\nSwallowing the steaming, mushy food from the rough clay bowl, Otto hurriedly stuck out his tongue to lick the remaining warmth off the bowl’s surface to avoid wasting any food.\nFinally, after licking away the last bit of mush, Otto sat down on a log, letting out a comfortable moan, his mouth lingering with the faint aroma of food and the taste of salt.\n\"I never thought a place like this exists in the world; my gratitude to the great His Highness Austin...\"\nOtto is a ratman. In a world like the Kawa Great Forest, governed by the raw law of survival of the fittest, the ratmen, a weaker race even compared to the kobolds, certainly do not fare well.\nPhysically weaker than kobolds, as timid as goblins, they are not only incapable of fighting on the battlefield but also flee when encountering formidable prey during hunts. Their survival can only be maintained by foraging for wild fruits, grains, or even gnawing on bark. Such races, even lowly slaves, are often despised by some tribes.\nRatmen have avoided extinction due to their rodent-like habits, breeding rapidly. Being omnivorous, during famines, they can gnaw on anything, even bitter tuber roots and bark, surviving even in the stench-ridden gutters.\nFrom the time Otto could remember, his memories were filled with lowly hunger; chewing on grass and tree roots countless times. Having several days of wild fruits and yams is already a rare harvest for the tribe, allowing these lowly beastmen a chance to eat such leftovers, especially for a humble ratman.\nOften, when the tribe’s harvest was poor, he’d lie on the grass, munching on bitter roots, fantasizing that the happiest life in the world would be to eat the sweet fruits and yams until full, without worry, alongside a piece of dried meat.\nAccording to some elders, when one dies and returns to the embrace of the gods, they’ll lead a life of perpetual happiness in the Divine Kingdom of the Beast God.\nOtto has never died, naturally unaware of what the Divine Kingdom of the Beast God is like, but he feels his current life is the best he ever imagined.\n\"Thanks to the tribe for driving me out, thanks to His Highness Austin’s benevolence.\"\nNot long ago, with the arrival of the cold winter, Otto’s original tribe began a new round of purging the old and useless population. This year, the tribe’s harvest wasn’t good, so more \"weak beastmen\" were purged than usual, Otto being among them.\nThose old and weak expelled population were considered useless or of little value by the tribe. Such is common among the beastman tribes surviving in the Kawa Great Forest, seen not as cold-blooded cruelty but as wisdom gleaned from survival struggles.\nAs for the expelled old and weak population, their fate was left to nature. A group of old, weak, sick beings wandering outside is virtually as good as dead, and nature uses such brutal ways to control the beastmen population within the Kawa Great Forest.\nInitially expelled along with the old and weak, Ratman Otto was in despair. Without the tribe as a backup, the approaching cold winter aside, even the lurking dangers in the forest were enough to annihilate them all.\nBut fortunately, when they encountered danger, they stumbled upon a formidable hunting party, which brought them here, commencing a new life.\nIn this tribe, they were disbanded and regrouped with those beastmen who heard about the Dragon Nest Tribe and voluntarily sought refuge, undergoing military training transformation together.\nThough the military training was arduous, with instructors often resorting to hitting and scolding, at least their bellies were never empty, even for the old and weak beastmen.\nNot only could they eat to their fill, but the food compared to the grass roots and bark Ratman Otto used to eat was infinitely delicious, and these delicacies even had salt!\nThis was simply unbelievable. For a while, Otto felt uneasy, suspecting some sinister scheme among the Dragon Nest Tribe’s beastmen, worrying about being reared as livestock among other absurd thoughts.\nAfter over half a month, as the military training progressed and Otto lived longer in the Dragon Nest Tribe, he finally put his mind at ease and developed an incomparable sense of belonging to the tribe.\nBeastmen instructors told them that everything they now possessed, the wonderful lives they currently enjoyed, were all bestowed by the great His Highness Austin.\nThey should devote all their efforts to loving him, admiring him, revering him from the depths of their hearts.\nInitially, Otto doubted these words, but as time passed, comparing the miserable past lives recounted openly by beastmen during military training to their current wonderful lives, the shared resonance led Otto and all beastmen to develop immense praise and worship for the great His Highness Austin.\nNow, Ratman Otto even feels he would willingly die for his Highness.\n\"Bless you, great His Highness Austin.\"\nRatman Otto silently uttered in his heart, then placed his rough clay bowl back in a nearby basket filled with used dishes by his companions, these dishes cleaner than when first washed.\nAt this moment, a long whistle sounded across the snowy ground, signaling the start of military training again.\nThe beastmen gathered one by one, Otto quickly joined them. Before the cold winter began, they’d train while working, but now with fewer chores during winter, their training volume has doubled, seemingly to make up for the days they escaped training.",

      "content": "Chapter 142: Chapter 138 The Role of Giant Beast\nDespite the doubled training, Otto still persevered; he had no choice but to persist, as the instructor was watching from above.\nIf it were when he first joined the Dragon Nest Tribe, Otto might have had thoughts of slacking off, but now he absolutely had none. Anyone who dared to slack off would face the brutal disciplinary iron fist of the instructor.\nMoreover, according to what Otto had learned during his past weeks living in the Dragon Nest Tribe, their meals as prospective members were actually the lowest in the entire Dragon Nest Tribe.\nCurrently, the Dragon Nest Tribe is strictly divided into several parts: prospective members like them who have just joined and are still in the bootcamp transformation stage; those with weak constitutions not suited for combat, needing only a daily exercise for production Beastmen; Beastman militiamen with limited daily training but mainly tasked with various productive activities; Beastman soldiers who regularly train and hunt outside, serving as the main force in combat; and the most powerful of all, said to closely surround His Highness Austin, the Dark Dragon Guard and Dragon Vein Attendants.\nPreviously, only the Dark Elves knew some Breathing Techniques of the Dark World, so the Extraordinary Beastmen that were transferred were mostly Dark Dragon Guard. However, with the fall of the Blood Claw Tribe Branch and some Beastman Transcendents surrendering and swearing allegiance to Austin, contributing their Breathing Techniques, the numbers of the Dark Dragon Guard and Dragon Vein Attendants have now balanced out.\nBut this is beyond what Otto can know. What he does know and what fuels him with endless motivation are the different food standards among the Dragon Nest Beastmen. Even the lowest-level Beastman producers can have a small piece of meat with every meal.\nAs for the higher categories of the Dragon Nest Beastmen, he doesn’t have the delusion of reaching that level himself.\nAh, meat. Otto had only ever eaten a piece of bone with minor meat bits long ago, which was a treat given to him by a delighted tribal leader during a feast. That deliciousness was almost unforgettable in his life.\nAnd more importantly, that small piece of meat was just a guaranteed ration norm. Becoming a Beastman producer also offers opportunities for work point rewards due to various diligence. Work points can buy tastier food. As long as there are enough work points, buying a large piece of meat to eat one’s fill is no problem.\nIf one day he could eat his fill with meat, he would be willing to die.\nPrecisely because of this, Otto consistently pushed himself.\nOne must know that within the Beastman Legion, there exists a Ratman scout team. If one day he could join the army due to outstanding performance, that would really be a leap to great status.\nAs he came to know, those Ratmen predecessors, before joining the Dragon Nest Tribe, were in equally low positions like himself but still went on to become important forces in the army. He may not be incapable of the same.\nHarboring a small hope he dared not dream about for the future, Ratman Otto quickly returned to his position and continued the prior training.\n...\nDuring this period, the training regime for these prospective members of the Dragon Nest Tribe has increased significantly.\nIn fact, all this is not unrelated to the earlier series of wars.\nFirst, there was the battle with the Blood Claw Tribe Branch, followed by the giant beast attack incited by mercenaries. Both battles cost the entire Dragon Nest Tribe heavily, especially with severe losses among the combat personnel.\nHad it not been for the Dragon Nest Beastmen’s fanatical loyalty to Austin, they might have already been defeated under such severe casualty rates.\nAlthough the Dragon Nest Beastmen battled bravely, winning both battles, the heavy casualties left the combat troops of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe halved, significantly reducing its strength.\nIn order to replenish the army’s strength, with the next generation of Dragon Nest Tribe not fully grown yet, these wandering Beastmen and other prospective members who joined became the most vital source for supplementing fresh forces.\nMoreover, with the onset of the cold winter halting all forms of production activities, leaving abundant free time, these prospective Beastmen members have naturally been subjected to increased training volumes.\nAdditionally, the reason for augmenting their training volume wasn’t simply the severe losses suffered by the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion. During this period, the Dragon Nest Tribe also planned a project—a giant beast hunting plan.\n\"Your Highness, that’s the situation, what do you think?\"\nWithin the Dragon Nest, the Governor of the Dragon Nest Tribe, Vini, was reporting the situation to Austin.\nPreviously, due to the advent of the cold winter, there had been an influx of wandering Beastmen in the wild, and with the current reputation of the Dragon Nest Tribe striking fear into tribes within a hundred-mile radius, following the spread of its fame, it immediately received plenty of Beastmen coming to pledge allegiance and join the Dragon Nest Tribe. In the ten days leading to the cold winter, more than dozens of wandering Beastmen came to join each day.\nThus, in the two major battles, although the Dragon Nest Tribe suffered many losses in Beastmen, its population growth was not slow. As a result, even though the Dragon Nest Tribe’s food supply was starting to strain, as long as the daily allocation was squeezed a bit, they could naturally make it through the cold winter and last until the next harvest.\nHowever, with the propagation of the Breathing Technique, the cultivation of which required significant energy and consumption, even though Austin didn’t intend to increase the number of Dragon Vein Beastmen for now, the food needed for cultivating the Breathing Technique was still a sizable quantity. Unless Austin wanted the Beastmen to stop cultivating the Breathing Technique, the food supply couldn’t be reduced.\nAmidst these circumstances, Vini came up with a solution, which was to hunt the giant beasts.\nLong before the mercenary attack, the Dark Elves had led a hunting team to kill a giant beast approaching the Dragon Nest Tribe and dragged its carcass back for food.\nAt that time, Vini discovered that the life energy within the giant beast seemed quite abundant. Typically, the Extraordinary Beastmen who could eat ten pounds of normal meat at a time were full after eating just two pounds.\nMoreover, not only did it fill them up, but after eating giant beast meat, these Extraordinary Beastmen seemed to have been strengthened to some degree.\nAlthough such strengthening wasn’t apparent among the Extraordinary Beastmen, the physical constitution of ordinary Beastman soldiers did indeed improve after eating giant beast meat a few times. Initially, Vini wasn’t too sure about the effects of the giant beast meat, but when mercenaries attacked, drawing in five giant beasts that were eventually slaughtered by Austin along with the Dragon Nest Tribe Beastmen, the corpses became the food for the Dragon Nest Tribe Beastmen.\nWith the substantial base of giant beast meat, the strengthening effect of the giant beast meat became fully demonstrated, and Vini also discovered that this giant beast meat not only satiated hunger and strengthened Beastman bodies but also considerably facilitated the cultivation of the Breathing Technique.\nDue to many such reasons, Vini came before Austin with a plan for hunting giant beasts.",

      "content": "Chapter 143: Chapter 139 New Ideas\nSince the meat of the Giant Beast is so valuable, and clearing away the Giant Beast can make the environment surrounding the Dragon Nest Tribe much safer, naturally, there is a plan for this purpose. After all, no one knows if mercenaries might attack again in the future as they did before.\nMoreover, during the cold winter when the land is covered in ice and snow, it’s the easiest time to spot the activities of Giant Beasts. Coupled with numerous Dragon Nest Beastmen idly resting in the tribe without any productive activities, this is the best time to hunt Giant Beasts.\n\"Giant Beast, huh...\"\nListening to Vini’s plan, Austin thought for a while but couldn’t find any valid reasons to refuse.\n\"Alright, but be cautious when tackling the Giant Beast as they are very powerful. Try to bring along the Dragon Vein Beastmen; be prepared to minimize losses.\"\nAustin did not plan to participate in hunting the Giant Beast but intended to give his full support, believing that having him safeguard the Dragon Nest Tribe would prevent any danger. Additionally, training his clan members further align with improving his clan’s strength.\n\"Yes, rest assured, Your Highness!\"\nVini replied firmly, then excitedly left the Dragon’s Nest.\nWatching Vini’s departing figure, Austin contemplated an important issue hidden within the Dragon Nest Army.\n\"The Extraordinary Beastmen are far superior to ordinary Beastmen, so regular military training and tactical drills are no longer suitable for them. I wonder how those in the Human World incorporate Warrior Mages into their armies?\"\nConsidering the combat power of his clan, Austin began to think about the differentiation within his subordinates’ army.\nWith strict discipline and systematic training, the ordinary Dragon Nest Beastmen army was capable of confronting beastman troops several times their number in the Kawa Great Forest. This collective strength and discipline were vital for Austin’s clan, growing swiftly from a handful to their current status.\nHowever, this training method significantly boosted ordinary Beastmen’s combat power but was somewhat inadequate for the Extraordinary Beastmen.\nMilitary training represents the essence of warfare history over millennia from Austin’s previous world, and even though Austin was not a general, he could comprehend and adapt these essences to enhance the ordinary Beastmen’s strength.\nBut this only applied to ordinary Beastmen.\n\"Troublesome indeed, as in my previous world, there were no foundations for Extraordinary Abilities, making it impossible to reference. Meanwhile, the Human World is too distant, lacking opportunities to study the structure of Extraordinary armies here.\"\nEven though trained Extraordinary Beastmen improved their combat power when cooperating as a military unit to some extent, Austin felt there probably existed ways to expedite their capability.\n\"Perhaps only when our forces expand to contact the border and truly confront the Human World’s military might, could we grasp something about it.\"\nMost knowledge of marching formations is a secret passed down among nobles, and even the Extraordinary mercenaries captured by Austin lacked understanding. They merely knew that in various duchies within the Human World, Warrior Mages were independently regimented, but deeper secrets eluded them.\n\"No, although my previous reality lacked the foundation for Extraordinary Abilities, I can draw from the arrangements in fantasy works!\"\nAustin’s eyes suddenly brightened as he thought of an ingenious idea.\nIn the world of rich cultural works from his previous life, various films, animations, and novels surged, most engaged in worlds with Extraordinary Abilities, potentially offering inspiration!\nBut soon, Austin felt dispirited again.\nBecause in his mind, those entertainment works yielded little reference value.\nWorks like the Avengers, Hero Guild in One Punch Man, Fire Shadow Leaf Village in Naruto, World Government Navy in One Piece—all revolved around single force overpowering many, rather than group cooperation among Extraordinary individuals.\nThough entities like Ninja Village or Navy were also military forces with many Extraordinary Powers within the framework, true teamwork in combat was scarcely mentioned, offering little reference.\nAs for those novels on some sites, whether fantasy or immortal hero tales, these protagonists dominated the world single-handedly, neither involving groups nor armies.\nDid they mention some nation or faction in the background that needed formation and arrays among soldiers to exhibit Extraordinary soldiers’ potential, much like this world’s armies might? But without understanding that knowledge, even referencing purposes were absent.\n\"Exploring the way of battle formations is hard, but it’s possible to refer to other elements to boost the clan’s strength.\"\nIn One Piece, it’s rumored that the Navy Six Techniques were the most powerful body techniques created by summarizing all military techniques, though Austin was unsure of its correctness. The concept could still be adapted here.\nFor instance, during countless battles, experienced Beastmen could distill and merge their enemy engagement tactics, creating simple combat techniques, while referencing combat techniques release methods, eventually developing their species’ combat body techniques.\nMoreover, initially, the Dragon Nest Beastmen’s combat experience wasn’t very extensive, directly borrowing from Navy Six Techniques to create their body techniques was feasible.\nSince Austin’s Thunder Forging Body Technique and Electromagnetic Cannon were successful examples of borrowing from anime and novels, why not attempt others?\n\"Indeed, various principles interlink, especially in this world where Extraordinary Abilities manifest. As long as there is creativity, everything is possible!\"\nInside the Dragon’s Nest, Austin’s eyes blazed with intense brilliance.\nDuring this relatively idle cold winter, he seemed to find something interesting to do again. Since successfully transforming Beastmen, this marked his second attempt involving Extraordinary Power adaptation, promising another significant boost to his clan’s strength if successful.",

      "content": "Chapter 144: Chapter 140 Experiment\nThe cold winter had already begun for half a month, and the giant beasts in the forest had become more active. For these enormous creatures, the cold chill outside didn’t have much effect on them; at most, it just made food harder to find.\nWhenever this time comes, the range of movement of the giant beasts starts to expand. And when two famished giant beasts meet, inevitably, one will become the other’s meal, or they will fight to their mutual demise.\nThe giant beasts that roamed and reigned between the mountains and forests had no natural enemies, except for their kind. And once a tribe is discovered by a giant beast, what awaits is an unparalleled disaster.\nThis region, lacking strong figures, is a domain where the giant beasts dominate.\nHowever, in this year’s cold winter, the era of rampant giant beasts has come to an end, because new hunters have set their sights on them.\nThanks to Austin’s efforts, the Dragon Nest Tribe had cultivated enough combat power. With well-trained troops, combined with dozens of extraordinary beastmen, and with the help of nets and various tools, the Dragon Nest Legion already had the capability to slay the giant beasts.\nTwo years of effort, and the seeds that Austin planted back then had finally grown to a certain level.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe, which used to be under Austin’s wings, has now grown to the point where it can stand on its own even without Austin.\nWho would have thought that the initially small group of seven Kobolds could grow to a regional dominator status in just two short years?\nThe matured Dragon Nest Tribe bared its fangs once again, but this time their target was the giant beasts rampaging across the snowy fields.\nNot only to secure enough food and resources but also to ensure the safety of the Dragon Nest Tribe, after some preparation, Vini led most of the military strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe out to begin hunting giant beasts.\nInitially, the old and weak beastmen who stayed in the Dragon Nest Tribe had some doubts about this giant beast hunting plan. After all, living in the Kawa Great Forest, the shadow cast by the rampaging giant beasts was enormous. The body as huge as a mountain, crashing through the mountains and forests, with an impact even the Magic Beast in the forest could not match.\nBut this doubt only lasted a few days until it dissipated completely under the impact of Dragon Nest Legion’s beastman soldiers repeatedly transporting back the corpses of giant beasts. Each victory not only brought a large amount of food and materials, showcasing the invincible power of the Dragon Nest Legion but also ignited the momentum and atmosphere of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe, filling nearly the whole tribe with a thriving vitality.\nAlthough at the beginning, the departing Dragon Nest Legion suffered losses due to unfamiliarity, subsequent battles allowed the Dragon Nest Legion, now more experienced, to hunt giant beasts without causing casualties among the legion soldiers.\nMoreover, due to the previously painstakingly established medical system, after gaining some experience, nowadays, the treatment rate of the injured had reached more than seventy percent. Aside from those who died on the spot, most of the injured beastman soldiers were saved by the doctors referred to as \"witch doctors\" by the tribe’s beastmen. This further reduced the casualties of the Dragon Nest Legion by a certain margin.\n...\nThe giant beast hunting plan not only brought a large food source to the Dragon Nest Tribe but also frequently encountered wandering beastmen or other beastman tribes while the Dragon Nest Legion was out searching for giant beasts.\nAt this time, the Dragon Nest Tribe no longer lacked food, so they naturally wouldn’t let go of these \"wild\" beastmen, capturing them in large numbers and bringing them back to the Dragon Nest Base, training and incorporating them into the Dragon Nest Tribe’s system.\nAnd after half a month of continuous sweeping, the population of the Dragon Nest Tribe not only did not decrease due to hunting giant beasts but rather exceeded three thousand.\nAnd while the Dragon Nest Legion achieved victory after victory, and the whole tribe developed positively, Austin also began his experimental research.\nInitially, Austin occasionally chatted with the Dragon Nest Legion’s beastman members and started having them demonstrate their combat techniques in front of everyone, encouraging discussions with the hope to simplify these combat experiences into the most straightforward and useful techniques.\nBut after all, the Dragon Nest Tribe was newly founded, and the Dragon Nest Legion had only been established for a year. The combat experience wasn’t rich, and it was not as Austin had imagined, able to condense and combine all experience techniques into the finest body techniques.\n\"As expected, their combat experience is still not rich enough. It seems that to accomplish this, we have to take it slowly.\"\nRegarding this, Austin, though somewhat disappointed, didn’t mind much. Since it couldn’t be done overnight, it would have to be gradual.\nAt least they could first study how to punch more powerfully, how to dodge faster, how to pierce with more damage, and then, later on, use these fundamentals to develop the Dragon Nest Legion’s unique battle body techniques incorporating the beastmen’s combat experiences.\nIn the future, there is indeed very great potential.\nAnd this doesn’t mean that Austin’s attempt had no effect. Every time after returning from hunting giant beasts, the Dragon Nest beastmen would exchange methodologies on how to handle the beasts on the battlefield. This continuously enhanced the combat awareness of the Dragon Nest beastman soldiers, which was one of the reasons why, later on, the beastman legion continued hunting giant beasts with a decreasing casualty rate, eventually achieving almost no damage at all.\nThe time to create unique combat body techniques for the Dragon Nest Legion had not yet matured, so for now, they could only draw upon those imaginative techniques from the anime of past life.\nAnd Austin’s choice was the Navy Six Techniques from One Piece: Shave, Iron Block, Moon Step, Gale Foot, Finger Gun, and Paper Drawing.\nAfter all, it was one of the few systematic training methods in Austin’s memory and the principles of the techniques he could barely remember.\nOf course, given the Navy Six Techniques were just techniques from a fictional work in Austin’s previous life, whether they could be recreated in the Otherworld was still unknown. Due to differing world frameworks, modifications were necessary, and they couldn’t be a direct copy.\nBut how to apply magic modification, and alter the Six Techniques to fit into the Fighting Qi System, all required Austin to conduct various levels of trials.\nTaking advantage of the vast amount of time available during the cold winter, Austin began research on modifying the Six Techniques.\nAt the start, Austin gathered ten of the strongest extraordinary beastmen from the Dragon Nest Tribe and taught them according to the principles of the Navy Six Techniques in his mind, then had them perform the Six Techniques according to these principles.\nAnd after three days of cultivation, without exception, all failed.\nHowever, this did not discourage Austin’s confidence because he had anticipated such results. Without improvements or a systematic training method, it was impossible to succeed all at once.",

      "content": "Chapter 145: Chapter 141 Foundation\nFor Austin, failing in attempting the Navy Six Techniques was anticipated, and it didn’t dampen his confidence. After all, the Navy Six Techniques are systematic combat body techniques from the One Piece World, likely developed by the World Government or the navy over a long period to surpass human limits. It’s impossible for Austin to casually replicate them in the Otherworld in just a few days.\nMoreover, during these three days of attempts, through continuous observation and experimentation, Austin discovered some clues. He’s developed some ideas about it as well.\nBased on memories from his previous life, Austin recalled the principles behind the Navy Six Techniques.\nShave is moving at high speed in an instant (0.36 seconds) by stomping the ground dozens of times to create explosive counter force, achieving the effect that makes one appear to vanish from a foe’s eyes.\nIron Block involves channeling strength into well-trained body muscles, granting iron-like hardness capable of withstanding bullets and blades, though with the flaw of immobility during use. However, Austin remembers Gabura from CP9 could move while using Iron Block, achieved by accelerating blood flow to quicken muscle movement.\nIn the One Piece World, it seems accelerating blood flow can yield greater power, demonstrated by Luffy’s Second Gear being based on this principle.\nAustin isn’t keen on verifying if accelerated blood flow can produce such power, but he has some ideas and directions on it. Yet, his priority remains reproducing a version of the Six Techniques first.\nPaper Drawing, a defensive technique within the Navy Six Techniques, involves shedding all bodily strength and using airflow changes from an opponent’s movements to control the body nimbly and avoid incoming attacks.\nWithin the One Piece power system, a similar power system to Paper Drawing is Observation Haki. Although Austin doesn’t know Haki’s principle, during Luffy’s training with King of the Underworld Rayleigh after the Paramount War, the principle of stimulating Observation Haki seems akin to Paper Drawing, as Luffy, blindfolded, evaded Rayleigh’s stick attacks by sensing airflow changes.\nMoon Step is said to be an application technique similar to Shave, using rapid air kicks to generate strong counter force for hovering or flying in the air.\nGale Foot, by executing ultra-fast and powerful kicks, creates a vacuum to unleash slashing attacks on foes, easily slicing targets in half, and it’s the only long-range attack technique of the Six Techniques.\nFinger Gun is claimed to have the power of a gunshot, concentrating all bodily strength in the index finger to unleash a strike with bullet-like power, easily penetrating the human body.\nAustin remembers the principles behind the Navy Six Techniques, but these are ultimately body techniques from a fantasy work. Whether they existed or not is one thing, and even if they did, given the foundational environmental differences between the two worlds, modifications are necessary.\n\"In the One Piece World, it’s said that the Six Techniques require a certain physique strength to wield. Based on the naval principles, they are indeed beyond reach for warriors without extensive training and strong physical capabilities.\"\nAustin knows that even CP9, touted as the strongest talents in eight hundred years, took years to fully master the Six Techniques, even with the World Government’s comprehensive training system and Rob Lucci’s exceptional talent.\nTo replicate the Navy Six Techniques unchanged in this world, knowing only the principles and lacking a complete training system, means Austin would have to explore step by step alone, a process taking at least ten years.\n\"However, compared to the One Piece World, this world possesses systematic extraordinary powers like Fighting Qi and Magic, and from these systems emanate combat techniques and spells. Perhaps drawing from the combat technique’s approach of channeling internal Fighting Qi could rapidly reduce the time to form the Six Techniques.\"\nThough lacking a systematic training method, Austin still has Fighting Qi as extraordinary energy in this world, making techniques inspired by it likely easier to wield than purely relying on body techniques like the Six Techniques.\n\"Yet, even if Fighting Qi can lower the requirements for using the Six Techniques, physical fitness remains the foundation. Hmm, we’ve hunted numerous giant beasts recently, so let’s first intensify the training for the Dragon Vein Attendant and Dark Dragon Guard to strengthen their bodies!\"\nEven with Fighting Qi’s aid lowering the minimum usage threshold for the Navy Six Techniques, a certain level of physical fitness is still necessary, so Austin increased the training regimen of these extraordinary Beastman legions.\nThis training session isn’t a simple lineup exercise anymore but genuine physical training.\nSince replicating the Navy Six Techniques from One Piece World is the goal, Austin doesn’t mind also replicating the training methods from there. After all, the Dragon Nest Tribe has hunted enough giant beasts to sustain the extraordinary Beastmen for intense training.\nThus, during the subsequent period, both the Dragon Vein Attendant and Dark Dragon Guard met with quite the misery.\nOver three thousand push-ups, sit-ups, heart-pumping pounds ups, weighted running... Each modern training method was pulled out by Austin, and the training volume was at least ten times that of a regular athlete from Austin’s previous life.\nUnder such rigorous training, all ordinary Dragon Nest Beastmen were utterly shocked, with their first act every morning being to watch the extraordinary Beastmen undergo their arduous training.\nBefore determining the training volume, Austin naturally conducted investigations, making the training intensity for these extraordinary Beastmen close to their limits, leaving them exhausted by the end of the first day, collapsing into sleep.\nBut it doesn’t stop there, as the second day’s training surpasses the first day’s volume, with each day surpassing the previous day’s limits, constantly increasing the Beastmen’s training volume.\nIn Austin’s previous world, this approach wouldn’t work, but here, in the Otherworld where extraordinary abilities manifest, with scientific training plus enhancements from the flesh of ferocious beasts, the physical capabilities of extraordinary Beastmen improved continuously. Combined with the Dragon Nest Beastmen’s fervent worship of Austin, under unwavering belief, they keep breaking through, even surpassing Austin’s expectations in training effectiveness.",

      "content": "Chapter 146: Chapter 142 Basic Combat Techniques\nHow strong is the potential generated by human willpower?\nIt’s said that to save a child falling from a high building, a mother’s speed can surpass that of a world champion. To rescue a wife trapped under a car, a husband can unleash the power to lift a vehicle weighing several tons.\nIn Austin’s previous world where extraordinary power had not yet manifested, this was true; in this world, the potential explosively unleashed by intense willpower is even greater.\nAnd it happens that, through relentless indoctrination and subtle influences from various matters, every beastman in the Dragon Nest Tribe has developed unparalleled personal worship towards Austin.\nUsing a church structure analogy, a large portion of the Dragon Nest Beastmen within the Dragon Nest Tribe are Austin’s fanatical followers, especially within the extraordinary beastman legion of the Dark Dragon Guard and the Dragon Vein Attendants.\nTheir seeds of extraordinary power were granted by Austin, akin to divine blessings given by a deity. Their fanaticism for Austin is even more intense than that of ordinary beastmen.\nBecause of this, through repeated training, and relying on that intense belief, many extraordinary beastmen continuously pushed beyond their limits, keeping up with the increasing training intensity.\nHowever, even so, after a month, only about twenty of those extraordinary beastmen remained, with the rest being eliminated for failing to keep up with the training pace.\nDuring this month-long training, owing to scientific methods and the potent effects of giant beast meat, the strength of the extraordinary beastmen soared, particularly the twenty who persevered to the end. If placed in the Sea King World, Austin speculates their attack power would be at least above one hundred to two hundred Dao Power, making them superhumans, ten times stronger than an average human soldier.\nOf course, training these elites consumed substantial resources from the Dragon Nest Tribe. If not for these extraordinary beastmen going out for giant beast hunts during training, the expenditure for their training alone might have depleted the Dragon Nest Tribe’s reserves.\nWith repeated hunts, the traces of giant beasts within a hundred-mile radius of the Dragon Nest have become scarce.\nThe remaining twenty beastmen’s attack power reached between one hundred and two hundred Dao Power, laying a foundation. Following One Piece World’s framework, they could begin training in the Navy Six Techniques.\nThroughout this month of training, besides creating training plans for the extraordinary beastmen, Austin was not idle.\nIndeed, he already had ideas for the magic modification of the Navy Six Techniques and had begun the transformation, only awaiting the final experimental stage.\nTo integrate the Navy Six Techniques into this world, Austin couldn’t spend ten years studying pure body techniques without a systematic training method. From the start, his goal was to combine Fighting Qi with the Navy Six Techniques, modifying them into combat techniques for this world.\nAustin did not possess knowledge about combat techniques, nor did the beastmen in the Dragon Nest Tribe. Whether it be Austin or his extraordinary beastmen, their abilities were akin to talent magic and were not acquired through postnatal cultivation.\nBut that didn’t matter, as there were a group of mercenary captives within the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAfter more than a month of tough slave struggles, when Austin showed the slightest hint, many mercenary captives naturally decided to submit to him, joining the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nSubmitting to beings different from oneself seemed unbelievable to Austin’s past self, and hard to accept as treachery among humans.\nYet, the truth reflects that, according to Austin’s previous world history of human civilization, the rise of nationalism and patriotism truly began among the masses after the Western Renaissance.\nPrior to that, most lower-class people were indifferent to who their kingdom’s rulers were, really caring more about next year’s harvest, taxation, marriage, death rights, and everyday needs, without much concern for ethnic differences.\nThere wasn’t even a concept of traitors or collaborators, and no one felt it shameful to submit to different ethnic groups.\nBefore the awakening of nationalism and statism, the Manchu Qing managed to rule the vast Divine Land, governing millions of Han Chinese with only about a hundred thousand people.\nBut as foreign powers invaded and nationalism gradually rose, patriotism awakened among people, and even with East Japan’s then ten-fold national power over Huaxia, it returned with no success, battered on the fiercely resistant Divine Land.\nThis was true in Austin’s previous world, and it is also the case here.\nThough this world boasts glorious extraordinary powers, its political systems still brim with the decay of aristocratic-peasant frameworks. Can one make a peasant understand the concepts of nationality, patriotism, or human-ethnic heroic duty?\nNo.\nPeasants are thus, and mercenaries struggling and surviving under noble dominance are likewise.\nThat’s why, aside from some stubborn individuals, most mercenaries submitted to Austin, joining the Dragon Nest Tribe system without feeling anything wrong about it, given their minds lack the concept of ethnic differences.\nWith the mercenaries’ inclusion, Austin gained an insight into human extraordinary systems.\nUnlike extraordinary beastmen or Austin’s talent magic, human warriors lacked innate talents. Their Fighting Qi and power were cultivated, as were their combat techniques.\nThis gave Austin significant insights into creating combat techniques.\nAfter several days of research, Austin discovered that mercenaries’ combat techniques essentially activated powerful attack abilities by channeling Fighting Qi through blood vessels.\nThis means the combat technique’s destructive power is essentially the destructive power of Fighting Qi.\nNo wonder techniques like Tornado Slash, Charge, and Wind-breaking Slash can be used by anyone adept with Fighting Qi, as this is merely straightforward application of Fighting Qi.\nThese combat techniques crudely utilize Fighting Qi to cover weapons, generating great lethal power by only employing the power of Fighting Qi, without coordination with the body to fully unleash its capabilities.\nUnderstanding this, although Austin felt somewhat disappointed, he also gained greater confidence.\nNow what he seeks to create is a fusion of Fighting Qi and body techniques, forging a new combat body technique, whose application will certainly be more powerful than these straightforward utilitarian Fighting Qi combat techniques.\nWith the mercenaries’ usage of Fighting Qi as reference, Austin also gained direction on how to adapt the Navy Six Techniques for local modification.",

      "content": "Chapter 147: Chapter 143 Preliminary Hardening\nAccording to the principles of the Navy Six Techniques, the difficulty of the Six Forms Body Techniques varies. Since modification is necessary, it’s natural to start from the simplest part.\nShave and Moon Step belong to the same category, relying on the explosive power of the legs to gain tremendous propulsion. As for Moon Step, if it requires kicking the air to gain sufficient upward reactive force, scientifically speaking, the speed of the foot’s kick needs to at least surpass the speed of sound. This is because, according to scientific theory, when an object’s moving speed approaches the speed of sound, it encounters a very strong resistance termed as the sound barrier.\nOnly the reactive force generated by the sound barrier makes it possible to rely on kicking the air to gain power for direction change or floating in Moon Step. The requirement for kicking speed is truly immense for this, and the same goes for Shave, which involves kicking the ground multiple times in an instant to rapidly move through accumulated reactive force. Not to mention whether this stacking of forces is even feasible, even if it were possible, the requirement for foot kicking speed is extremely high. With the current strength of the Beastmen, there’s still quite a gap.\nMoreover, even with Fighting Qi modification, Shave and Moon Step in these six forms are rather complicated, and Austin is not considering them for the time being.\nOf the remaining four techniques, without Shave for rapidly closing in, the Finger Gun technique, although it has some impact, doesn’t greatly enhance the current Extraordinary Beastmen. Moreover, mastering Finger Gun requires solving the problem of finger hardening; otherwise, swift stabbing will only result in breaking one’s own fingers.\nAs for Paper Drawing, which is akin to sensing airflow to evade in advance, given the coarse and impulsive nature of the Beastmen, Austin doesn’t think they could learn it quickly.\nTherefore, Austin decided that the first modifications would be the Iron Block and Gale Foot of the Six Forms.\nRegarding Iron Block, Austin remembers similar Hard Qi Skill martial arts from his previous life which, although unable to stop bullets, could resist fist and foot attacks at high levels. In a modern society without Extraordinary Power, they could achieve such a degree, so with Fighting Qi, it might be possible to recreate martial arts akin to the Golden Bell Shield found in novels.\nMoreover, regarding the Hard Qi Skill, Austin knows a thing or two. It’s said to be developed through continuous striking and training, so that the muscles attain an iron-like state. Adding Fighting Qi, this Fighting Qi version of Iron Block is very likely to be realized and is one of the easiest body techniques to implement within the Navy Six Techniques.\nAs for Gale Foot, mercenaries already possess combat techniques like Earth Splitting Slash and Wind-breaking Slash. They have some foundation in the application of Fighting Qi, but they cannot perform long-range attacks.\nIf Fighting Qi is used in conjunction with the principles of Gale Foot, there’s a high chance to recreate such combat techniques in this world.\nOf course, according to the principles of the Navy Six Techniques, Gale Foot also has very high requirements for kicking speed, but Gale Foot can be used with weapons to create a Slashing Wave. Before the physical capabilities of the Extraordinary Beastmen reach the limits required for Shave and Moon Step, Austin plans to directly adapt it into a weapon-slashing combat technique. When the Beastmen’s kicking speed catches up, they could then base further development on true Gale Foot.\n\"There are twenty people left, just enough to form two groups. One group will use clubs for body striking while developing the technique to enhance muscles with Fighting Qi, thereby developing Iron Block. The other group will first practice, stimulating Fighting Qi on weapons for hacking, then attempt combination with Fighting Qi, using Gale Foot’s concept to see if they can unleash Slashing Waves.\"\nAfter pondering for half a day, Austin had already decided on the development direction of the Six Techniques.\nHaving made the decision, Austin did not delay, and directly divided the Extraordinary Beastmen into two groups based on their actual conditions.\nThose with robust physiques and muscular builds were placed in the Iron Block experimental group, while those with developed arm muscles and swift, strong arm movements were assigned to the Gale Foot Slashing Wave experimental group.\nThe two groups quickly entered the experimental state without much delay.\nThanks to the previously hellish training, these Extraordinary Beastmen had already built a solid foundation, so training directly progressed.\nIn the Iron Block experimental group, the Beastmen had to practice daily by striking their bodies with clubs. As their muscles tensed and hardened, enhancing their defenses, they also adapted their skin muscles to external environmental changes while attempting to activate their internal Fighting Qi, channeling it into their muscles, and using external forces to stimulate the continuous fusion and coordination of Fighting Qi and muscles.\nOn the first day, the Beastmen in the Iron Block experimental group wailed incessantly, their entire bodies covered in bruises, looking very battered. Fortunately, the Beastman Witch Doctors had established a good treatment system and had decent experience with the bruises from club strikes. After applying herbal compresses and blood circulation massages, plus the life force of the Extraordinary Beastmen, they had mostly recovered by the following day.\nThe training intensity remained the same on the second day without increase, and the Beastmen again appeared bruised and battered. However, their injuries were slightly better than the previous day. Under external stimuli, as the Extraordinary Beastmen tightened their skin muscles, strands of Fighting Qi began instinctively converging towards the muscles and skin, improving some defense.\nDay three, day four... with each passing day, the Beastmen’s situation improved. During this period, Austin did not have them work in isolation but had them share their insights with each other every night, facilitating discussions. Austin would then summarize and refine, constantly enhancing, to determine the best way to utilize Fighting Qi, and so forth.\nThis method of alternately refining and experimenting continued until the tenth day. In the Dragon Nest Tribe, ordinary Beastmen striking these hardened Extraordinary Beastmen with clubs couldn’t inflict any damage. Even blunt wooden spears failed to pierce their skin.\nPreviously, even Extraordinary Beastmen would inevitably flee embarrassingly when confronted by the combined forces of an ordinary Beastmen army.\nBut now, the Extraordinary Beastmen who underwent the Iron Block training could stand in the field with their hardened abilities, and several dozen ordinary Beastmen wielding wooden clubs couldn’t inflict any damage—this was simply incredible!\nOf course, this does not mean the Iron Block experiment was successful. In fact, the Iron Block experiment was still in a very preliminary stage, just achieving basic hardening rather than being called Iron Block. In combat, it remains somewhat of a superfluous addition, still requiring further effort and improvement.",

      "content": "Chapter 148: Chapter 144 Bronze\nThis initial hardening technique, developed from the insights of the Extraordinary Beastmen, can only be used when standing still, as it requires the body to remain immobile, essentially turning one into a large target.\nAt this stage, hardening can barely withstand the blunt blows of ordinary Beastmen, and fails to resist even the sharper Wooden Spear, let alone other sword-like weapons.\nHowever, with this promising beginning, Austin believes that it will eventually be possible to develop a complete magic-modified Iron Block, akin to Gabura, which allows for mobility during attacks and even incorporating Iron Block into offensive combat.\nThe Extraordinary Beastmen in the Iron Block experiment group are continuously engaged in hammering training, but now they train with partners, rendering the strikes from ordinary Beastmen less beneficial for them.\nThe group is divided into two teams for training: one team focuses on resistance training while the other strikes, and then they switch roles after the training time is up.\nDuring further development and training, the Extraordinary Beastmen in the Iron Block training group have begun to sense the linkage between Fighting Qi within their bodies and their muscle skin, repeatedly experimenting with harmonizing Fighting Qi with their physique, combining the most effective methods through continuous exchanges, gradually forming a battle technique prototype for Iron Block.\nSoon after, when the Extraordinary Beastmen in the Iron Block experiment group use the Iron Block prototype, bystanders can even see the faint glow of Fighting Qi emanating from their skin, indicating that they have initially integrated Fighting Qi into the hardening, significantly enhancing their defense and gradually forming a battle technique prototype for Iron Block.\nIt is believed that over time, this Fighting Qi version of Iron Block will be capable of resisting sword and spear strikes and even Fighting Qi attacks, possibly extending to attack techniques based on Iron Block in the future.\nThe emergence of the Fighting Qi version of Iron Block indicates the possibility of the magic-modified Six Techniques appearing in this world, and Austin is thus excited.\nCurrently, he has not fully exploited the battle formation knowledge or other information on strengthening the Extraordinary Beastmen, so he intends to enhance the capabilities of the Beastman Transcendent before proceeding, planning in the short term to learn and emulate the navy in \"One Piece\" as a template, with Extraordinary Beastmen as leader officers commanding a group of ordinary Beastman soldiers, coordinating in combat to maximize their combined combat power.\nSuch cooperation is far superior to independent formation of armies from ordinary Beastmen and Extraordinary Beastmen.\nIn this military structure, the ordinary Beastmen have undergone rigorous training and their skills are adequate, though the Extraordinary Beastmen still require improvements in their combat strength.\nThe magic-modified Navy Six Techniques is presently Austin’s method to significantly improve the solo combat abilities of the Extraordinary Beastmen.\nHowever, Austin’s excitement was short-lived; unlike the smooth progress of the Iron Block experiment group, the Gale Foot Slash Wave experiments encountered issues from the start.\n\"Weapons pose a real problem.\"\nIn this Fantasy World, there exist battle techniques similar to Earth Splitting Slash and Tornado Slash. These rudimentary techniques can basically be utilized with the presence of Fighting Qi within the body.\nBased on these battle techniques, combined with the Gale Foot concept, it might be feasible to achieve a Gale Foot-like Slashing Wave for ranged attacks, potentially even more powerful than the original.\nHowever, for a slash to be effective, at least a weapon resembling an Iron Sword, capable of enduring Fighting Qi and swift slashes, is needed!\nThroughout various battles, the Dragon Nest Tribe managed to collect some Iron Weapons, but these were too few, mostly taken by the Goblins at the Goblin Manufacturing Workshop, and these weapons are mostly large items like Wolf Fang Clubs, Iron Rods, Iron Hammers, and War Axes of assorted designs.\nAside from these mismatched weapons not fitting Austin’s vision of a unified weapon army, the Wolf Fang Clubs and Iron Hammers are incapable of delivering slashes. Even the War Axes, which barely fit battle technique needs, only have a couple of small ones, insufficient for Gale Foot Slash Wave training for the Extraordinary Beastmen.\nUltimately, Austin ordered the Goblins at the Goblin Manufacturing Workshop to make ten Ironwood Swords from a wood similar to Ironwood for the Extraordinary Beastmen to practice slashing techniques and channeling Fighting Qi to the Ironwood Sword.\nBut Austin knows this is only a temporary measure; these Wooden Swords, though sturdy in texture, fall far short of real Metal Swords in sustaining the fierce Fighting Qi and rapid tearing slash force.\nTo acquire enough Metal Swords for the Extraordinary Beastmen to use with Slashing Wave, Austin once again focused on the Copper Refining Blast Furnace at the Copper Mine Base.\n\"Your Highness, according to your methods, we’ve produced copper, but the weapons made from this copper are useless....\"\nBeside the Copper Refining Blast Furnace, Goblin Gulu, in charge of this area, presented a dark gray-yellow axe to Austin, whose edge was already dented and sunken.\n\"This axe was used only once for chopping a tree and only managed to peel off a corner of bark before ending up like this.\"\nAfter over a month of exploration, aided by Austin’s initial guidance, the Beastmen stationed there have overcome numerous challenges, finally refining copper and casting it into tools and weapons.\nYet the effectiveness of these tools seems far from satisfactory.\nPerplexed, Austin examined the axe closely, noting the gray-purple hue revealed at the dented blade edge.\nThis is copper, rather pure copper!\nPure copper has good malleability, but unlike steel, it is unsuitable for manufacturing tools and weapons.\n\"Hah!\"\nAustin almost slapped himself; historically, weapons were made from Bronze, not pure copper. The copper refined through impure blast furnaces isn’t pure copper, as it contains impurities like copper oxide, differing greatly from Bronze both in composition and in hardness and sharpness, rendering these copper products unsuitable for weapons.\n\"Bronze requires adding some metallic elements, either tin or zinc?\"\nAustin furrowed his brow, but soon he found sufficient information from his past life memories.",

      "content": "Chapter 149: Chapter 145: Copper Alloy\nPure copper is actually not suitable for making weapons. In the history of humanity, what was first used on a large scale was bronze.\nAnd bronze is an alloy of copper.\nWhen Austin was in high school in his previous life, reading chemistry, perhaps they detailed the chemical composition of bronze alloys, but after so many years, Austin has forgotten more than half of this knowledge.\nAlthough he forgot most of it, that doesn’t matter. When he read about ancient people smelting bronze, he was very curious about how those ancient humans incorporated those reactive metals into copper and how they smelted those reactive metals.\nAt that time, Austin went to check it knowingly, and it turned out that in ancient times, when smelting bronze, ancient humans often added some associated minerals from which copper was produced to copper ore. Those associated minerals were the necessary components to form bronze alloys. Furthermore, adding those associated minerals resulted in the bronze alloy having a lower melting point than copper, making it easier to refine.\nAs for what elements those associated minerals consisted of, Austin has mostly forgotten. Likely, those ancient humans did not specifically study the components of those associated minerals; as long as usable bronze tools could be smelted, who cared what elements they consisted of?\nSince he remembered that smelting bronze required associated minerals, Austin naturally began to try and asked the Kobolds present to find other associated minerals in the copper mine.\nSince the work of refining copper had started, Austin also found that Kobolds seemed to have a remarkable talent for mining and finding ore. Perhaps in the future, when looking for other ores, a Kobold exploration team could be specially established?\nWith their prospecting talent, the Kobolds quickly found the associated minerals different from copper ore and sent them to the blast furnace.\nDuring this nearly a month’s time, the Dragon Nest beastmen not only developed a specific method for refining copper but also, according to Austin’s instructions, made a lot of copper material. Since there was copper material, Austin planned to directly put these refined copper into the fire, then add the associated minerals to the earth blast furnace for re-melting.\nWith the efforts of the beastmen, after exerting great Kung Fu for more than half a day, they finally manufactured a pale yellow axe.\n\"Not green? Could it be a matter of the metal elements of these associated minerals?\"\nLooking at the newly made axe, Austin’s mind was full of doubts.\nAlthough it wasn’t bronze, from the refining situation, the melting point did indeed drop significantly, so there shouldn’t be any mistake.\n\"Take it and try it.\"\nEven though it wasn’t the bronze he imagined, Austin still told a beastman to try it out.\nSo a strong Kobold took the axe to a nearby tree and started chopping it down rapidly. To Austin’s surprise, this axe was sharper than the stone axe and more rigid. In no time, a whole tree was chopped down, yet the blade of the axe showed no signs of wear.\n\"Your, your highness... we have succeeded!\"\nThe Goblin Gulu, responsible for refining copper, looked at the axe with fanaticism, so excited that he was almost speechless. More than a month of hard work in this Copper Ore Base had previously resulted in copper that was unusable, leading them to believe they had failed.\nBut now, from this axe, they all saw the hope of success.\nAustin didn’t speak. He took the axe, weighed it in his hand, and lightly flicked its surface with his claw, feeling it was not much different from the iron axes provided by the Dragon Nest tribe.\nAlthough it wasn’t the bronze he imagined, its properties were similar to iron, and in this humid world, copper was better than iron since it didn’t require extra effort to prevent rust.\nActually, around the Dragon Nest tribe, all the tribes used weapons like wooden spears, stone hammers, and stone axes. Austin had only seen iron weapons a few times, like the iron axe in the hands of Lizardman Rodney and those seized from the Blood Claw Tribe branch, as well as the mercenaries’ weapons. It could be said that within a hundred miles, almost all iron weapons were in Austin’s Dragon Nest tribe.\nAll the beastman tribes living in the Kawa Great Forest were basically primitive civilizations of the Stone Age, with no foundation for metal smelting.\n\"First, follow the previous proportions and make ten great swords. Don’t slack off with the remaining work; it’s best to continue experimenting with refining these coppers.\"\nSince these alloyed coppers were no worse than ordinary iron, he decided to forge ten great swords first for the Gale Foot experimental group of beastmen to use for training. However, Austin remembered that the best copper alloy weapons were still bronze, so he instructed the beastmen to continue experimenting.\nOver time, the Dragon Nest beastmen around Austin were also influenced by some modern thinking from Austin. The cultivation of non-toxic mushrooms in the mushroom houses, the innovative manufacturing in the workshop, the establishment of the witch doctor treatment system, and even the formation of iron block combat techniques were largely the results of Austin instilling variable experiments, inductive analysis, etc., into the Dragon Nest beastmen.\nBy continuously experimenting with changing variables and synthesizing the results to find the optimal method, Austin’s modern thinking kept expanding within the Dragon Nest tribe. Though these invisible things seemed inconspicuous, the establishment of various systems in the Dragon Nest tribe was based on this kind of thinking.\nWith this foundation of thought, Austin didn’t need to teach them hand-in-hand; as long as the task of improving copper alloys was assigned, the beastmen would naturally experiment and improve continuously.\n\"It’s best if we can produce bronzes. For now, bronze weapons are the most suitable for the tribe’s current situation, and when developed to a certain extent, bronze is no less than some steel.\"\nHolding the axe in his hand, Austin thought silently.\nHowever, what Austin didn’t know was that bronze was initially not green. Newly smelted bronze was a golden yellow, and it turned green because after being buried in the ground for thousands of years, it constantly rusted and oxidized, forming a layer of verdigris on its surface. It was thus called bronze.\nTherefore, it was essentially impossible for him to smelt green copper from the earth blast furnace directly.\nAustin spent several days at the Copper Ore Base, and with the collective labor of over a hundred beastmen, they finally forged ten great swords, each successfully completed.\nAfterwards, while Austin assigned the task of researching better copper alloys to the beastmen, he also ordered them to produce some copper alloy armors and manufacture some production tools based on previous techniques.\nHaving issued his orders, Austin returned to the Dragon Nest tribe with these ten great swords.",

      "content": "Chapter 150: Chapter 146: Inspiration\nTen \"Bronze\" great swords reached the hands of the beastmen in the Gale Foot Slash Wave training group, and the experiments on the Gale Foot Slash Wave resumed.\nAlthough the progress here lagged behind the Iron Block combat technique, with the arrival of the large swords, everything finally got on track.\nDuring this period, the extraordinary beastmen in the slash wave experiment group, despite being limited by their weapons, could almost perform a Fighting Qi Slash with wooden swords after nearly a month of practice. However, they hadn’t yet figured out how to create a vacuum wave by tearing through the air.\nBut Austin firmly believed that with the beastmen’s relentless training, success would inevitably follow.\nAfter switching to new weapons and getting familiar with them for several days, thanks to their prior foundation, the beastmen could successfully attach Fighting Qi onto the great sword, producing slashes.\nHowever, these slashes were just ordinary Fighting Qi application techniques. Although powerful enough to chop through a tree without resistance, they could not form a long-range vacuum slash wave at all.\n\"The principle of the Gale Foot is likely rapid contraction and extension of leg muscles, followed by a swift kick to compress air and create a sharp vacuum-like slashing wave... This seems a bit difficult.\"\nUnlike Iron Block, where Austin’s previous world had physical references, the Gale Foot was completely fanciful. Human strength couldn’t make one’s kicking speed surpass the speed of sound.\nFortunately, Austin’s world was not one where the extraordinary had not yet emerged. Magical energy and Fighting Qi truly existed.\n\"Once Fighting Qi is released from the body, its condensed energy automatically disperses into the surrounding air, quickly diminishing. As a result, warriors in this world rarely have long-range attack methods. So, how can we combine the principles of Gale Foot with Fighting Qi to create a slash wave?\"\nWatching the beastmen in the field tirelessly striking the air, hacking hundreds of times before resting and continuing, Austin kept pondering.\nThis period had witnessed over a month’s arduous training. Initially, the beastmen returned home each day with sore, weak hands, relying on the Dragon Nest Tribe’s witch doctors and their herbs for relief. The terrifying training volume would have already broken them if not for their life force surpassing that of humans and their extraordinary beastman physiques.\nEven so, after over a month’s training, the extraordinary beastmen of the Gale Foot Slash Wave experiment group could, at most, extend Fighting Qi two inches when slashing, stirring a bit of airflow, but had no clue for actual slash waves detaching from the blade.\nAustin saw clearly that without a breakthrough in the right direction, ten or eight more years of training wouldn’t allow them to develop a real slash wave.\nIn fantasy novels, the protagonist trains swordplay in the deep mountains, swinging a sword ten thousand times a day, persevering without fail.\nTen years later, they draw their sword, splitting mountains and severing rivers.\nPerhaps if the beastmen continued practicing for decades, they might achieve those fantasy novel effects. But by then, Austin might not care for such combat techniques as Gale Foot Slash Wave.\n\"Troublesome, but mainly, how can we keep Fighting Qi from dispersing and maintain its attack power outside the body?\"\nWith high-density Fighting Qi, nature’s gradient diffusion law causes it to disperse in all directions once outside the body, rapidly diluting into nothing, thus making it lack much killing power.\nThis difficulty in achieving the Gale Foot Slash Wave was unlike that of Iron Block Combat Technique.\nThe Iron Block technique applied Fighting Qi internally, while the Gale Foot Slash Wave was a long-range flying slash attack.\n\"When casting magic spells like Fireball or Water Ball, the magic power within disperses rapidly while flying. However, mages condense and constrain it with their spiritual power, allowing spells to retain significant power when flying quite far, as long as they’re within the spiritual power’s range. Do I need to similarly constrain Fighting Qi with spiritual power?\"\nA thought suddenly occurred to Austin, but he quickly negated it.\n\"No, the nature of Fighting Qi and magic power is completely different. Fighting Qi cannot be controlled with spiritual power, or else warriors would have long become like mages with long-range bombardment abilities.\"\nAustin pondered intensely but had not made any breakthrough for several days.\nWatching the beastmen still diligently swinging their swords, Austin could not help but wonder if the creation of the Gale Foot Slash Wave combat technique was going to fail.\nThis day, out of ideas, Austin flew up, leaving the nest to clear his mind.\nIt had been two months since winter set in, and during these two months, Austin had focused entirely on refining copper and the Navy Six Techniques, unaware of how quickly time had passed.\nFlying high and gazing down at the snowy, crystal-clear, magnificent earth below, his mood suddenly lifted.\nWith a loud roar and a rapid flapping of his wings, his body flew like wind and thunder across the sky at incredible speeds, even breaking the sound barrier and causing sonic booms in the air.\nThe resistance from breaking the sound barrier did not trouble his robust body at all. On the contrary, it exhilarated him to fly a considerable distance high up.\nSince coming to this world, almost four years had passed. From fearfully contending with Blood Wolves for survival to establishing a foothold in the forest, gaining a foundation and a self-protective power, it felt like a dream.\n\"Whatever, I’ve endured many dangers before, and I can’t believe I won’t figure this out.\"\nAfter venting in the sky, Austin even casually intercepted a flying giant beast on the way.\nBack then, he had to avoid these creatures, fearing becoming their prey. Now, he could casually kill them, and even his clan could see them as mere quarry, a remarkable sentiment to reflect on.\nAfter his excursion, a refreshed Austin flew back to the Dragon Nest Tribe. Approaching the tribe, he saw a group of young beastmen tossing stones into the snow like skipping stones over water, oddly playing with snow.\n\"A group of carefree children.\"\nSeeing this scene, Austin sighed.\nBut just when he intended to look away, a sudden flash of inspiration struck him like lightning across his mind.",

But why does it skim across the water when skipping stones?\nSpeed!\nIt’s speed! The speed carried by the stone allows a denser, heavier stone to skim across the water surface, and it’s only when the speed is exhausted that it finally sinks.\nAustin’s eyes suddenly lit up with brilliance, and he had an epiphany.\n\"No, rather than speed, it’s about movement! The movement of the object changes everything!\"\nThe stone’s movement allows it to defy convention by skimming across the water. If Fighting Qi could be moved in a way to sustain its high energy without dissipating, like the skipping stone on water, it could achieve powerful remote attacks!\nAustin had no clear understanding of the essence of Fighting Qi. He only knew that it dissipates quickly after leaving the body. However, within and near the body’s surface, it’s unaffected. This phenomenon couldn’t be explained by mere diffusion from high to low concentration; there must be a more profound connection causing Fighting Qi to dissipate in the air.\nBut regardless of the relationship, movement can alter many physical properties. Austin’s analysis using the analogy of the stone skipping on water could be worthwhile.\n\"Movement can endow objects with different characteristics. The principle of Gale Foot is more about creating a vacuum wave with rapid foot strikes than just attacking an enemy. The vacuum wave allows the rapid movement of the air blade upon striking air, maintaining strong motion and retaining formidable slashing ability even after traveling long distances!\"\nFrom a realistic viewpoint, if a sudden vacuum appears in a localized space, the surrounding atmospheric pressure rushes into the vacuum area immediately, refilling it in an instant.\nThis characteristic is pretty similar to Fighting Qi, which also dissipates quickly in the air after leaving the body.\nMore importantly, aside from how Gale Foot’s vacuum slash wave allows for remote attacks, Austin couldn’t initially discern how the vacuum wave inflicted such severe damage.\nBut that fleeting inspiration enlightened Austin to a new world.\nPerhaps the result is due to movement!\nNot the vacuum wave’s movement, but the movement of airflow.\nWhen water flows rapidly under high pressure, it can form a jet cutter that slices through metal and stone. Similarly, the movement of air can create astonishing effects.\nIn videos from his previous life, Austin once saw an experiment where airflow was accelerated to massive speeds using an air compressor, enough to sever a wooden log in seconds.\nThe principle behind Gale Foot might very well be the same!\nSurpassing supersonic kick techniques cause extreme air compression upfront, forming a vacuum wave. Meanwhile, the airflow driven by the toe’s movement rapidly circulates along the vacuum blade’s surface at terrifying speeds surpassing the speed of sound.\nDuring flight, the vacuum and airflow create a cycle and balance. The pressure difference between vacuum and atmospheric pressure maintains the rapid rotation of surface airflow. This causes the Gale Foot Slash Wave to advance swiftly while the small portion of airflow near the vacuum wave remains in high-speed motion until the vacuum wave is filled by air and dissipates, with the fast-spinning air blade losing momentum due to air resistance and fading away.\nIn Austin’s theoretical analysis, the Gale Foot Slash Wave consists of two critical components: the forming vacuum wave and the rapidly rotating air blade on its surface. Together, they form a perfect circular cycle, culminating in a remote attack technique like Gale Foot.\nIn this configuration, the rapidly rotating air blade is the main source of Gale Foot’s destructive power. It enables the vacuum wave to sustain itself briefly in the air and leverages the atmospheric pressure to convert its pressure differential into the air blade’s driving force.\n\"Gale Foot can utilize a collaborative cycle between vacuum wave and air blade to form a slash wave with powerful slashing ability. Can I create a magic-modified version, using detached Fighting Qi in combination with the air blade, to form a Gale Wave?\"\nHaving clarified the cause and effect of Gale Foot, Austin’s eyes radiated with unprecedented brilliance.\n\"It’s certainly possible! Compared to vacuum, Fighting Qi as an energy can be controlled to move quickly, and combining the two to create a Gale Wave’s power will surely be stronger than the original Gale Foot!\"\nUnderstanding the principle opened everything up. The previously stalled Gale Foot Slash Wave experiment group moved to the next phase.\nThe first step in upcoming experiments is the Fighting Qi Sword, attaching Fighting Qi from the body to the sword blade.\nFighting Qi dissipates for unknown reasons after leaving the body. However, attaching it to one’s sword doesn’t cause this. In fact, within the realm of human warriors, many use techniques like Tornado Slash and Wind-breaking Slash, where Fighting Qi is attached to the sword blade to enhance its destructive power.\nWhile attaching Fighting Qi to a weapon consumes it quickly, as long as the weapon is in hand, it won’t vanish like detached Fighting Qi that dissipates within tens of centimeters, increasing attack potency due to the weapon’s nature.\nThe first step of Fighting Qi Sword was mastered by all the test group’s beastmen within just a couple of days.\nPreviously, while the Gale Foot Slash Wave training group hit a bottleneck, the Extraordinary Beastmen in the test group hadn’t been idle. They practiced slashing thousands of times daily, trying to guide Fighting Qi onto the Bronze Greatsword and unleash it into a flying slash. Although with no results yet, each beastmen’s arm swelled from long hours of intense sword-swinging, laying a solid foundation for Fighting Qi Sword.\nThe second step involves rapidly driving and rotating the Fighting Qi attached to the sword.\nThis is no simple task, as Austin lacked a systematic training method for this. Even the combat techniques used by human mercenaries remained rudimentary, primarily focusing on Fighting Qi Sword as a basic means of applying Fighting Qi.\nWithout references, Austin had no choice but to let the beastman test group explore, exchanging insights daily to discover how to keep the Fighting Qi on the sword in motion.",

      "content": "Chapter 152: Chapter 148 Gory\nAs the days of experimentation wore on, the beastmen in the experimental group exchanged experiences and finally found a winding path in the midst of hardship, and it was through this path that they steadily advanced.\nAt the very beginning, the Fighting Qi attached to the great sword could only be emitted from both sides, and its speed was equivalent to just one or two levels of wind speed, consuming several times more Fighting Qi than it normally would. However, this seemingly slow speed opened a new door for the beastmen.\nDue to the tenacity of Fighting Qi, when treated in this manner, the power of the Fighting Qi attached to the sword exceeded that of an ordinary Fighting Qi sword by over ten percent. Though it seemed disproportionate to the consumption, it indeed indicated the direction of advancement.\nSo the beastmen continued their research on this basis, evolving from simple emissions to the hope of transforming the Fighting Qi into a complete cycle between the two blades, thereby greatly reducing the consumption of Fighting Qi while ensuring its movement.\nWith a correct direction, combined with ongoing training and exchange among the experimental group of beastmen, they soon found a solution. The circulation of Fighting Qi attached to the great sword not only resolved the issue of high Fighting Qi consumption but also increased the speed of circulation and enhanced the power beyond that of a typical Fighting Qi Slash.\nWith the emergence of a breakthrough, the beastmen in the experimental group continued to advance, eventually seeing the dawn of remote attack techniques like the Gale Foot Slash Wave.\nAs long as the speed of the Fighting Qi attached to the great sword could be increased beyond the speed of sound,\nNo, even if it was less than the speed of sound, as long as it reached a critical point, it would be possible to develop a remote slashing wave similar to the Gale Foot Slash Wave!\nThe future is bright!\n...\nMeanwhile, somewhere in the forest.\nRumble!!!\nThe grotesque giant hand’s hulking body collapsed like a hill, wounds mottled with blood splattering onto the snow, creating a warm mist that immediately froze solid.\n\"Whew, managed to kill another one.\"\nLooking at the collapsed forest around him, where more than half of the trees had fallen and the snow appeared plowed through, as well as the giant beast’s corpse lying on the ground, resembling a mountain covered in huge ropes, the mercenary deputy captain Gory let out a long breath, his weapon trembling in his hand.\nEver since they attacked the Dragon Nest Tribe, only to fail and be captured by Austin, they had become slaves, their lives crushed under heavy labor like brick-moving and mining.\nAfter more than a month of grueling torment, despite being extraordinary professionals, they were nearly reduced to skin and bones.\nThey had attempted to escape, but their first few efforts were easily thwarted. The last time, after escaping the Dragon Nest Tribe and thinking they had made it, they were directly suppressed by Austin and enslaved once more.\nEvery failed escape came at a price. Just the thought of that frightening little black room sent chills down everyone’s spines. After Austin’s unparalleled power easily crushed and captured them again, most mercenaries lost all hope; they couldn’t escape, or even if they could, they would have to face the terrifying Blue Young Dragon.\nMoreover, escaping into this icy and snowy world mostly only meant facing death.\nEven after that, some mercenary slaves, still unwilling to give up, tried to conspire again, but were quickly betrayed by their former companions, hung on poles in the icy wild for three days, and were barely alive when finally brought down.\nYou couldn’t blame them. The repeated failed escapes and the cruel punishments that followed had already caused many companions to lose hope.\nJust when all the mercenaries were enveloped in a melancholy atmosphere, thinking they would soon die in this Dragon Nest Tribe like wild grass, the Blue Young Dragon unexpectedly found them and gave them two choices.\nOne was to submit to it and become its subordinates, fighting on its behalf.\nThe other was to continue being slaves, struggling until their value was exhausted and they died.\nGory still remembered that dragon’s haughty demeanor, looking down at them as if it were gazing at a bunch of ants, completely indifferent.\nYet in their desperation, the mercenaries, like grasping at straws, naturally most of them chose to submit without hesitation, becoming a part of the Dragon Nest Race. Of course, there were a few stubborn ones who, like Mercenary Captain Valen, sneered at the notion.\nBut not every mercenary held an exalted human faith like Edward. Many of these mercenaries had fought their way up from the bottom, without the slightest notion of nationalism. This attack on the Dragon Nest Tribe was mostly because Edward’s words swayed them; they didn’t have that much of a \"vanquish evil\" saintly heart.\nBesides, at the borders of the human world, weren’t there some countries that submitted to a giant dragon, paying tribute year after year? Why couldn’t they submit to a dragon?\nThus, most mercenaries were taken out of the slave cells and joined Austin’s forces.\nIn the first few days, Austin individually interrogated them, extracting their Breathing Techniques, combat techniques, various experiences, maps, and even the distribution of worldly forces, all documented thoroughly.\nSubsequently, the mercenaries who had been thoroughly interrogated were incorporated into combat teams. Despite the fact that the main culprit of the assault was that pretty boy Edward, and these mercenaries, like Austin, were of the human race, that didn’t mean Austin was going to pardon them just because of shared ancestry.\nWhy should he care about shared ancestry? Even among humans, there’s plenty of warfare. Since they had already interfered with his interests, there would be no leniency.\nThus, although these mercenaries were pulled from the abyss of slavery, they were also placed in the fighting ranks, taking on the most dangerous frontline tasks. Fortunately, with the growing strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe and their rather abundant experience in hunting giant beasts, when the mercenary corps went out hunting together, there were no casualties; even injuries were quickly healed by the beastman witch doctor.\nOver the months, through countless experiences, it felt like a lifetime ago. Some mercenaries, because Austin had pardoned them from the slave cells, were moved to tears, swearing eternal loyalty to His Highness Austin.\nRegarding this phenomenon, Gory outwardly smiled and agreed, but inside he sneered relentlessly. He had no intention of staying under this dragon’s command until death...\nDiscarding the numerous thoughts from his mind, Gory quickly stepped forward to help clean up the battlefield.\n\"Speaking of which, haven’t we been exterminating giant beasts continuously? Why does it seem like the number of giant beasts hasn’t decreased recently, but actually increased? Rodrigo, was it always like this before?\"\nThe Legion Commander, Lizardman Rodney, was evidently taken aback, and both his narrative and questioning tones conveyed the same curiosity.\n\"Is that so? The tribe hasn’t hunted giant beasts before. But it does seem like you’re right; why does it seem that the number of giant beasts has recently increased?\"\nLizardman Rodney’s brows furrowed with noticeable confusion, having not noticed before, but now, thinking about it carefully, it did seem to be a problem.\nGory was also taken aback, having unwittingly stumbled upon a possible issue just by idly chatting.",

      "content": "The area where the Dragon Nest Tribe is located is extremely barren in terms of magic resources. Hence, both magic beasts and giant beasts are relatively scarce. Without sufficient magic power resources, it is fundamentally difficult to support their survival activities. To sustain a giant beast's survival activities, at least an area of five to six kilometers is needed in this magic resource-lacking region.\nBefore this cold winter season began, Rodney, who mingled in this area for a few years, had encountered traces of giant beasts only a few times but had never actually seen the true appearance of a giant beast.\nAlthough rarely encountered giant beasts, which relates to these beastmen intentionally avoiding such dangers, prior to this, within a radius of ten miles from the Dragon Nest Tribe, Rodney indeed saw no traces of giant beast activities.\nIt could even be said that the surrounding region was generally a peaceful place.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on novelFirｅ.net\nHowever, now, not to mention the mercenaries attracting five giant beasts nearby seemed a bit odd. If five giant beasts gathered so quickly near the tribe, it indicates the number of giant beasts near the Dragon Nest Tribe has reached a certain degree. Yet, before this, the Dragon Nest Beastmen's production activities did not intersect with giant beasts, and traces of giant beasts were not found within a ten-mile radius around the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAfter deciding to hunt giant beasts later, Dragon Nest Beastmen often ventured out, hunting giant beasts heavily. But at this moment, thanks to Gory's reminder, Rodney realized that in this period, although Dragon Nest Beastmen had hunted quite a number of giant beasts, the number of giant beasts within the tribe's region did not decrease!\nSuch a situation is evidently unusual, and the only possibility is the increase in giant beasts due to unknown reasons, causing this series of circumstances.\nDue to unknown reasons, when these giant beasts migrated in a certain direction, they passed by the area near the Dragon Nest Tribe, leading to an increased number of giant beasts around the tribe, resulting in the Dragon Nest Tribe continuously hunting giant beasts, yet the number of giant beasts showed no sign of diminishing.\n\"Gory, you've done well. After returning, go with me to report to Governor Vini, sir.\"\nIf the situation is truly caused by the migration of giant beasts, then it's not Rodney's concern alone. Why migrate, how many giant beasts will pass through the Dragon Nest Tribe area; any one of these factors might relate to the life and death survival of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nUpon deeper thinking, Rodney would realize that starting a few months ago, the prey within the forest seemed more numerous than usual.\nIf wild animals also increased due to migration passing, then it is very likely that unknown reasons led to a massive migration of creatures, including the magic beast storm tiger that attacked the Dragon Nest Tribe initially, as well as those recently increased magic beasts, migrated past because of such unknowable reasons.\nOf course, Rodney, who is somewhat careless, naturally wouldn't think so deeply; he merely instinctively sensed something wasn't right.\nAfter tidying up the scene, Rodney hurriedly led a group of beastmen to bring back the giant beast corpse to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n...\nReturning to the tribe, Rodney casually handed over subsequent matters to the tribe, then led Gory to the Inner City Governance District.\nOn the surrounding open grounds, newly joined beastmen were undergoing strict military training renovation in the ice and snow, with squads of beastmen patrolling around.\nAs the Dragon Nest Tribe developed, the population recently approached four thousand people, and the construction of the settlement continuously expanded. The Dragon Nest Tribe quickly reaching four thousand people can now be called Dragon Nest Town, vaguely divided into inner and outer city districts.\nOf course, these aren't residential area divisions based on status, but because the Inner City District was built against a cliff, where the entire tribe's highest leader, the great His Highness Austin, resides.\nMoreover, the Inner City District is purely a governance area; every evening, the middle and upper echelons of the Dragon Nest Tribe gather here to hold meetings, summarizing the previous day's experiences and achievements, and begin organizing the work tasks for the next day, managing the entire tribe comprehensively.\nInside the Inner City District is also the location of the entire Dragon Nest Town's largest warehouse. Food is one of the most valued things to beastmen in the Kawa Great Forest, naturally placed in the most secure location.\nTherefore, the security in the inner city area is relatively stringent.\n\"Lord Rodney.\"\nAs Rodney led Gory into the inner city, beastmen guards on both sides promptly saluted.\n\"Lord, what's this?\"\nThe beastman guardian glanced at Gory, the implied meaning in his eyes was self-evident.\nWithin the entire beastman tribe, due to the initial reason for their attack, the human mercenaries' status wasn't very high, only as ordinary soldiers. After Austin exhausted their knowledge value, these mercenaries temporarily had no usefulness to him, so the beastmen didn't particularly care for them.\nEven because of the previous incident of attacking the beastman tribe, a small portion of beastmen still held latent hostility towards these human mercenaries, although given they were part of the same tribe, there wasn't any explicit targeting.\n\"I brought Gory with me to find Governor Vini for a matter.\"\nCasually explaining, Rodney led Gory into the inner city.\nThe inner city buildings were noticeably better than the outer city, all with brick and tile structures, and through unified design, looked very clean and tidy, possessing a unique aesthetic.\nGory looked around, feeling refreshed.\n\"Truly unexpected that such a city was actually established by a dragon, likely not even some small cities in certain duchies could compare.\"\nAs a war criminal captive, after joining the Dragon Nest Tribe, Gory entered the inner city for the first time under Rodney's leadership.\nHowever, despite the inner city being clean and beautiful, not inferior to some duchies' small towns, it was ultimately a city belonging to beastmen, with cultural and economic lifestyle differences. Therefore, Gory didn't develop unwavering loyalty to Austin, instead, he hoped to return to the Human World when possible.\n\"Hum ha!\"\nNot far away, a series of swishing sounds echoed. Gory looked over, his vision bypassed the governance hall, then saw behind it a vast open area, where several beastmen of strong aura continued to slash swords in the snow, and amidst obstructed sight, he faintly saw that dragon.\n\"Lord Rodney, what are they doing?\" Gory curiously asked Rodney.\n\"Oh, them? I heard His Highness Austin wants to develop a combat technique, so he picked them for experimentation.\" Rodney casually replied as he walked.\nGory kept silent but pondered inwardly, straining his view for a broader sight before entering the governance hall.\nThe next moment, his eyes widened suddenly, filled with disbelief.",

      "content": "\"Feel the Fighting Qi inside you, understand it, command it, make it move along the blade!\"\nOn the vast snowy field, ten Extraordinary Beastmen were diligently swinging their swords in the wind and snow, the massive blades slashing down at great speed, producing sharp sword sounds, while waves of air blades were swept up.\nAustin walked behind the Extraordinary Beastmen, constantly observing their sword movements and states, his calm voice echoing in their ears.\nRecently, the Beastmen from the Gale Wave experimental group had finally managed to make the Fighting Qi cycle and flow along the sword blade, reaching speeds comparable to level five wind speed.\nThe rapidly rotating Fighting Qi attached to the Great Sword not only easily swept up air blades but also greatly enhanced the power of the rough combat technique of Fighting Qi Sword for the Beastmen.\nThe tough and sharp Fighting Qi cycled on the blade of the Great Sword, the feeling was as if a Great Sword turned into a chainsaw, its power not to be underestimated.\nHowever, although it greatly enhanced the power of Fighting Qi Sword, the development of Gale Wave was still some distance away. At least for now, the Beastmen first need to be able to release the Fighting Qi attached to the sword blade.\nMoreover, the Beastmen's sword-swinging speed was still far from achieving a vacuum and making the air blades rotate at supersonic speeds. The success in developing Gale Wave still had a considerable distance to go.\nYet, compared to the previous confusion, the Beastmen in the experimental group had advanced significantly, and Austin believed that if they continued, the successful development was not far off.\nSuddenly, a sharp sound arose, the feeling like a rapidly spinning drill scraping on glass, and simultaneously a thin, eye-invisible slashing wave suddenly shot out, creating a line on the snow ahead.\n\"Hmm?\"\nAustin abruptly turned his head, seeing a leopard humanoid with spotted fur holding a Great Sword with both hands, staring in bewilderment at a finger-width, two-meter-long line in the snow ahead of him.\nAll the Extraordinary Beastmen stopped their actions, gazing at that leopard person.\nAfter delivering that slash, the leopard person did not move, only closing his eyes to carefully recall the moment of bewildering action just now.\nAustin said nothing, and neither did any of the Beastmen.Latest content published on noᴠelfire.net\nThe atmosphere was silent, snowflakes gradually falling from the sky, as all the Extraordinary Beastmen, including Austin, quietly waited.\nAfter an unknown amount of time, the leopard person reopened his eyes.\n\"Your Highness, I understand now!\"\nThe leopard person showed an excited look; during the repetitive sword movements earlier, his numbed and weary arms moved mechanically, yet at a distracted moment, he intuitively managed to slash that sword. By recalling that moment, he seemed to have found his direction.\n\"Your Highness, let me try it first!\"\nThe leopard person looked at Austin, and with Austin's permission, he held the Great Sword and walked to a half-man-high rock a short distance away, stopping three steps before it.\nThe leopard person leveled the sword at the rock, the sword tip about twenty centimeters from it.\nHe took a deep breath, tightly gripping the Great Sword in both hands.\nClosing his eyes, the Fighting Qi quickly flowed and spun on the Great Sword, producing a faint sound of tearing through the air, with dim light flickering.\nAfter an uncertain length of time, the next moment,\nSwish!\nA dazzling white light flashed in the air, a crescent-shaped arc of light descending like a cold crescent moon from the sky, gradually dissipating into the air thereafter.\nAfter swinging the sword, the leopard person gasped for breath,\nwhile the rock ahead appeared to be sliced diagonally from above, with its upper half suddenly sliding off.\n\"So that's how it is!\"\nIn that instant, the keen-eyed Austin clearly observed that at the moment of the slash, the leopard person somehow channeled the Fighting Qi to extend more than a meter beyond the sword tip, and the rapidly rotating Fighting Qi carried a powerful cutting force, slicing the rock as easily as cutting tofu.\nThis wasn't the effect of the Great Sword producing a Slashing Wave, but the Fighting Qi breaking from the sword carrier, extending attack range and causing damage.\nAlthough there was still some way to go before achieving the concept of a long-range flying attack like Gale Wave, at least the leopard person had taken a huge step forward in being able to unleash powerful Fighting Qi off the sword,\njust one more step, and the attacking method of Gale Wave could be successfully evolved!\n....\nJust as Austin had the leopard person share his insights for mutual learning, he did not notice that at the gates of the council hall, the Mercenary Deputy Captain stood on tiptoe to see everything, his face filled with disbelief and shock.\n\"Secret Techniques! These are Secret Techniques!\"\nGory shouted frantically in his heart, barely resisting the urge to rush over.\nThe leopard person's slash that cut the rock in mid-air was seen by him, and further off, he also witnessed those Beastmen standing,muscles bulging like steel giving off a faint white glow, while several Beastmen with Wooden Spears broke each spear upon lunging.\nDuring this time, he had seen the power of the two prototype Combat Techniques Austin kept trying to develop.\nAs a result, a tidal wave of ambition and yearning surged within Gory.\nSecret Techniques, truly Secret Techniques, and that Young Dragon was developing Secret Techniques!\nWhat are Secret Techniques? In the Human World, they are Secret Combat Techniques handed down through powerful noble families! They are one of the bedrocks of a strong noble line lasting millennia!\nSecret Techniques possess power far beyond ordinary Combat Techniques, which is why powerful noble families can maintain lasting influence, and why their members can easily defeat warriors of the same level. The existence of Secret Techniques is a part of this.\nSecret Techniques provide family warriors with formidable combat power, making it incredibly easy to challenge ordinary civilian warriors across tiers.\nTo Gory's knowledge, within the Southern Countries, the newly established twenty-year-old Eagle Duchy's King, Grand Duke William, possessed a family Secret Technique called the Golden Eagle Thirteen Strikes. Grand Duke William, with unparalleled talent, cultivated the Golden Eagle Thirteen Strikes to an incomparably powerful level, achieving overwhelming victories against Legends at Golden peak tier, even vanquishing a Legend, albeit an aged one with fallen strength nearing pseudo-Legend. Still, that battle made Duke William a household name and led to the establishment of the Eagle Duchy.\nThis is the power of Secret Techniques!\nIf he could obtain these two Secret Techniques and return to the Human World, Gory might have the capacity to become a noble, or even to establish a noble family of his own!\nAt that moment, Gory's heart was brimming with rampant ambition and desire....",

      "content": "\"We must acquire those Combat Techniques!\"\nIn an instant, Gory had made up his mind.\nOn this adventure, not only did all members of their Mercenary Corps perish within the Dragon Nest Tribe, they also became slaves, suffering for so long. Regardless of whether they could return or not, even if they could eventually escape, going back empty-handed was simply a crime.\n\"Perhaps, this is an opportunity.\"\nAnyway, in the short term, they couldn't leave the Dragon Nest Tribe, so it was better to perform well and hope to gain these Secret Techniques in the future.\nDespite the various allocation systems of the Dragon Nest Tribe being a revelation to Gory, whereby everyone who worked hard could receive food, unlike other tribes where the strong bullied the weak, abused the lives of lower-class Beastmen, and snatched food from them, it seemed like the Blue Young Dragon was incredibly benevolent.\nBut Gory didn't believe that the Blue Young Dragon was truly benevolent. If it were truly benevolent, who would hear the grievances of the Beastmen swallowed and killed in each expansion war? Although he did not understand, his instincts told him that the dragon was no different from those aristocratic vampires above; it was just that the dragon's methods were more sophisticated.\nGory also didn't think that the Secret Techniques spawned from the dragon would be easy to obtain, so he decided to lay low for now.\nAnd indeed, as Gory expected, for both the Mercenaries and ordinary Beastmen, especially those Mercenaries yet to gain Austin's trust, acquiring the Combat Techniques developed by Austin would never be simple.\nRegarding the developed Navy Six Techniques, Austin had decided that apart from members of the test group and future direct Imperial Guard deployments, anyone wanting these Combat Techniques must earn enough merits.\nNot only are the Magic Modified Navy Six Techniques treated this way, so are future opportunities for Beastmen undergoing Dragon Vein Transformation.\nWhen the Dragon Nest Tribe was initially established, to rapidly enhance the Clan Tribe's power, Austin had to implement a universal military regime, including even elderly women trained and incorporated into combat units.\nIf Austin had obtained the cultivation method for the Six Techniques and the means of transforming Beastmen at that time, he would have undoubtedly promoted it throughout the tribe, maximizing the tribe's strength.\nAt that time, Austin basically racked his brains to enhance the Beastman Race's power in a short time, and during the Extraordinary Bloodline Transformation of the Beastmen, those selected were simply the tallest among the short, with conditions set very relaxed, including Kobolds chosen for transformation without hesitation.\nHowever, as the tribe continued to develop, through successive wars and annexations by assimilating wandering Beastmen, the tribe's population had already approached the four thousand mark. With such a large number, and the recent discovery of a direction for Bronze weapon crafting, this vast force could easily dominate the entire area of over a hundred miles; Austin need not worry about other dangers.\nFurthermore, it was later discovered that maintaining the power of Dragon Vein Beastmen required a large consumption of meat, making the tribe-wide promotion of this transformation project extremely pressuring on food resources, eventually leading to a halt. Occasionally, only a couple of spots were awarded to those ordinary Beastmen who made great contributions, or Beastmen highly gifted in the Cultivation Breathing Technique.\nInitially, after resolving some worries, and as the population of Beastmen increased, the distribution system had to undergo further reform. During the initial rapid development phase, many problems were masked by the fast-growing speed, but as time went by, those flaws would inevitably emerge.\nAs the Dragon Nest Tribe's system gradually improved, Austin had already decided that, unless focusing on cultivating core combat forces such as Dragon Vein Attendants, the Magic Modified Navy Six Techniques' cultivation method, Beastman transformation slots, and even the supply of precious materials like Bronze Weapons should never be given without compensation for contributions.\nTo gain power and core resources, one must exert more effort than others and contribute more to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nBecause Austin believed in one thing: things received without cost are often not cherished.\n...Fresh chapters posted on net\nRodney brought Gory into the governing hall and immediately garnered attention from the top after presenting their findings.\nLately, the Dragon Nest Tribe had gathered many more wandering Beastmen compared to the previous year. It was initially thought that the Dragon Nest Tribe's reputation had spread, attracting so many Beastmen. However, there seemed to be another reason.\nThrough Gory's reminder, Vini and others gradually discovered some clues. According to those fleeing wandering Beastmen, before the cold winter season, the number of beasts outside the forest inexplicably increased significantly, making it impossible for them to safely gather sufficient food for winter in the forest, thus leading them to migrate outward, where they encountered many Giant Beasts and Magic Beasts along the way and were hunted heavily until they reached the safe area within the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nPreviously, such situations rarely occurred, albeit occasionally some tribes in the Kawa Great Forest failed to store enough food before the cold winters due to various accidents, causing tribe collapse and Beastman wandering. However, this phenomenon of massive tribe collapse due to increased beast havoc leading to large-scale Beastman wandering was a first.\nAll the change seemed to have happened around six months ago.\nUpon inferring the arrival of unknown danger, Governor Vini dared not make decisions alone and quickly reported the situation to Austin.\n\"Unknown danger, causing mass beast migration?\"\nUpon hearing this situation, Austin's brows furrowed but he could think of no reasoning and could only give orders.\n\"From today onward, increase the number of Beastman reconnaissance teams, probe outwardly, and find the cause of the anomaly.\"\nAlthough the strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe was said to cover an area of hundreds of miles, in reality, the tribe's population of only four thousand spread across vast lands was negligible; the Dragon Nest Beastmen's footsteps barely ventured far. The tribe's reputation spread mainly through Austin's identity as a Giant Dragon and the transmissions of scattered Beastman tribes nearby.",

      "content": "The strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe is indeed formidable, standing as a dominate force among the many small tribes. However, due to its population size, it's impossible to cover the entire area completely. They can only intensify the search or see if they can find the source of the mutation among the surrounding beastman tribes.\n\"It seems the plan needs to be accelerated....\"\nWatching Vini's departing figure, Austin thought silently to himself.\nPreviously, due to the lack of sufficient power and food to expand significantly, Austin had been sweeping and annexing the surrounding beastman tribes, but it was basically limited to a range within a thirty-four-mile radius, and there wasn't any sweeping eradication, leaving quite a number of beastman tribes out.\nNow, as the cold winter is about to end, with the introduction of large quantities of copper tools, the speed of beastman land reclamation will undoubtedly accelerate. At that time, more kudzu roots can be produced as food, and Austin believes that next year the tribe's population could increase to ten to twenty times its current size.\n\"If I can gather over a hundred thousand beastmen, then in this Kawa Great Forest, there will indeed be little danger that could threaten my own existence, but the most important thing now is to complete the magic modification of the Navy Six Techniques, and there's that unknown danger, it's always felt not so simple...\"\nCurrently, Austin has developed the prototype of the Iron Block and the Gale Wave. Although they have certain power, they are not significantly enhancing the strength of the extraordinary beastmen for now, only providing some utility.\n\"The Iron Block is almost perfected, and the direction of experimentation for the Gale Wave is about three-quarters complete, but to significantly enhance the strength of the Dragon Vein Attendants, there is still a need for mobility.\"Chapters first released on NoveIＦire.net\nImmediately, Austin thought of Shave.\nIf Shave can be developed, with Iron Block for melee defense, Fighting Qi Sword for melee attack power, Gale Wave for long-range, and adding a swift-moving Shave, the strength of the extraordinary beastmen would definitely be significantly enhanced.\n\"Before the end of the cold winter, Shave must be developed!\"\nAustin had a vague premonition that the unknown danger might appear after the cold winter next year, and to be prepared, the development of Shave in the Six Techniques must be hastened.\nUsing three techniques from the magically modified Navy Six Techniques to arm the extraordinary beastmen, these fully equipped extraordinary beastmen might even give Austin some trouble to deal with.\nThe most proficient and powerful extraordinary beastmen might leap to possess two to three times Austin's strength. Such a power is the greatest enhancement Austin can achieve in the short term.\nMoreover, with the development experience of Iron Block and Gale Wave in the Six Techniques, Austin has gained some ideas for developing Shave.\n\"Purely based on the Gale Foot theory, if one wants to achieve instantaneous rapid ground kicking to gain reaction force for movement, then the kicking speed must reach at least sound speed; without long-term training, it is simply impossible. But if Fighting Qi is added, gathering it at the sole to explode multiple times in a short period to mimic Shave, this stacked power might be enough to achieve Shave!\"\nWith an idea in mind, Austin immediately set to experiment.\nWith the successful development experience of Iron Block and Gale Wave, this development attempt will definitely be simpler than the previous two.\nAs Austin was transforming the three techniques and arming the core extraordinary beastmen, the Dragon Nest Tribe began dispatching large beastman squads to seek the source of the mutation.\nMeanwhile, the mercenary deputy captain Gory, who did not want to return empty-handed, suppressed his thoughts of defection and began to actively showcase himself, hoping to be noticed and enter the core of the Dragon Nest Tribe to obtain those secret techniques.\nTime passed day by day, and as the cold winter approached its end, the hints that were just speculation before finally became reality.\nThe number of surrounding beasts and those mountain-like giant beasts and terrifying magic beasts began to increase, to the point that the expedition teams sent by the Dragon Nest Tribe nearly perished in this perilous forest.\nThough not yet a beast tide, the impact of a large number of beasts mixed with occasional giant beasts led to the destruction of many small tribes surrounding the Dragon Nest Tribe, causing a large number of fleeing beastmen to seek refuge in the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThis time, they had no qualifications to negotiate terms.\nIn the last mere month of the cold winter, the Dragon Nest Tribe's population increased by a thousand people due to this influx. Fortunately, the masses of passing beasts also brought with them a large amount of food, otherwise, the mere increase in beastmen population would have overwhelmed the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAnd as the days passed, the traces of beasts suggested that most of these beasts and giant beasts came from the west.\nThe mutation is likely originating from the west.\n....\nBloody Border.\nA beggar-like figure leaned on a broken, dirt-covered sword resembling a stick, gazing at the tall, grand city walls, with lifeless wooden eyes glowing brightly.\n\"Finally returned!\"\nHis face was covered in dust, impossible to see his true appearance, and his cracked lips were bloodless. His hair seemed tangled with countless knots, his clothes were tattered, his arms and legs appeared fleshless, his body thin as paper, as if a gust of wind could blow him away.\nHe was Edward, after three whole months of struggling for life and death in the cold winter forest, had finally arrived here.\n\"Valen, my brother, rest assured, I will definitely cut off that damned dragon's head to avenge you all!\"\nThe will to live that had supported him out of the forest erupted into a blazing fire of rage at that moment. Reflecting on the past three months, Edward was eager to immediately lead an army to chop that damned Blue Young Dragon into pieces.\nJust then,\nWooo wooo wooo....\nA massive horn sound came from afar, echoing through heaven and earth. Edward saw the originally city-bound people scrambling towards the city gates, while squads of soldiers began appearing on the walls, large amounts of military supplies were being transported up, and the gate soldiers were loudly calling for people to hurry over.\n\"What's going on, what's happened?\"\nEdward hurriedly grabbed an old man, who desperately tried to shake him off, but how could the old man's strength compare to Edward's? He could only turn his head around.\n\"Ah, why are you pulling me, hurry and run, those beastman brutes are here again!\"\n\"Beastmen are attacking? What's going on, it's just past the end of the cold winter, this isn't the time for beastman attacks at all?\"\nEdward frowned deeply, feeling that something was very strange.\nAs far as he knew, beastman attacks usually happened a month before the start of the cold winter, attacking the Bloody Border to gather enough food from the Human World.\nBut during the cold winter, many beastmen were lost in the icy and snowy environment, and after the cold winter ended, as all things grew and prey exited their dens, the beastmen, with their significantly reduced population, had no worries about food. So why would they sacrifice themselves to attack the Bloody Border?\n\"That's years ago, for the past two years those damned beastmen have gone mad... Let go, if you don't leave now, it'll be too late! After entering the Border City, I'll talk to you, okay?\"\nThe old man, helpless, could only plead bitterly.\nSeeing this, Edward could only accompany the old man into the city first.",

      "content": "Including the time spent struggling to escape, Edward has been inside the Kawa Great Forest for at least more than half a year, and he has a relatively good understanding of the thoughts of the beastmen living in the vast jungle in the south.\nIn the forest, there is only one thing that is most important, and that is food. Some beastmen even value food more than grain.\nBefore the arrival of the cold winter, due to the rapid population expansion of beastmen in the previous nine months, most tribes would find it difficult to survive the desperate white cold winter relying solely on previously stored harvests.\nTo obtain enough grain and to clean up excess population, a month before the cold winter, many beastmen would come out of the forest in groups and attack the Bloody Border.\nIf successful, the beastmen can enter human territories through the breached defense line, plundering and acquiring a large amount of food. Even if unsuccessful, the significant loss in population reduces the pressure on the beastmen tribes' food consumption during the cold winter.\nAs for that month before each cold winter, beastmen invasions have almost become customary.\nExcept for the month before and after cold winter, it's usually a time of peace. The many beastmen tribes living within the Kawa Great Forest will not waste their power attacking the Bloody Border, for hunting wild beasts and gathering food also requires manpower, and tribes must retain some strength to avoid being swallowed by enemies.\nTherefore, although beastmen invade the border every year, it is only concentrated in the month before the cold winter, and invasions rarely occur during other times.\nEspecially at the beginning of the end of the cold winter, when the ice and snow recede, a significant portion of the beastmen have already died in the cold winter, and the remaining beastmen are mostly starving. Moreover, after the cold winter, all things are revived, and wild beasts emerge from their lairs, making it a good time for hunting.\nIn the past years, after the end of the cold winter and at the start of a new year, the border is the safest time of the year.\nBut now, has everything changed?\nThe gigantic walls stand tall on the plains, rising like mountains, stretching endlessly. This is the most famous Bloody Great Wall at the border, an iron wall defense line established by humans over a thousand years, isolating the numerous savage beastmen of the Barbaric Land to the south of the Great Wall from the Central Earth World.\nHowever, at this moment, Edward has no time to marvel at this enormously majestic structure. He quickly entered the Border City inside the walls, following the old man.\n\"A few years ago, as you said, the savage beastmen's harassment was focused in August and September before the cold winter began... But in these past two years, everything has already changed. Those beastmen have gone mad, launching large-scale attacks and harassment except during the immobile cold winter. Especially recently, those beastmen seem crazy, rushing up without regard for casualties...\"Find the newest release on Nove1Fire.net\nIn the old man's rambling, Edward's brows furrowed even tighter.\nBefore entering the Kawa Great Forest, Edward had hired the Black Bear Mercenary Corps to enter the Kawa Great Forest with him, and although he felt something was wrong with the Border City at that time, he didn't dwell on it.\nUpon entering the Kawa Great Forest, he noticed some signs that seemed to indicate super large tribes of hundreds of thousands or even millions of people were migrating towards the border. Some tribal stations were deserted, which allowed them to cross the \"defense line\" where beastmen were gathering, entering the central part of the Kawa Great Forest with little loss.\nWhen Edward observed the signs of migration of those large beastmen tribes, he was somewhat puzzled, but considering it was already close to August and September, with the cold winter approaching, the migration and attack on the Bloody Border by a massive number of beastmen seemed normal, so he didn't pay much attention.\nBut now, it seems everything is not that simple.\n\"...Last year, during the most frenzied beastmen attack, it was said that there were millions of beastmen gathered outside the entire border Great Wall. Even Grand Duke William of the Eagle Duchy had to personally join the battle, barely holding the beastmen outside the Border Great Wall.\"\nThe old man recalled last year's event with lingering fear.\n\"Last year, that must have been after I entered the Kawa Great Forest. What exactly happened!\" Countless questions arose in Edward's mind.\nAfter so many years of tug-of-war-like wars, the beastmen south of the Border Great Wall should clearly know how difficult the Bloody Great Wall is to breach, yet they still acted without hesitation. There must be no reason for such actions to occur!\n\"Old man, thank you for your help.\"\nEdward expressed his gratitude and then hurriedly left.\nIt is certain that some unknown changes have occurred in that savage land in the south of the Kawa Great Forest, leading to this series of events.\nNow, restoring his identity is the most important thing in front of Edward. More information may only be truly known by the upper nobility. As for the damned Blue Young Dragon issue, he can only wait until he overcomes this current hurdle to address it.\n...\nMeanwhile, outside the Border City, dozens of miles away, in the vast and boundless forest, large groups of beastmen were moving silently toward the Bloody Border, dragging their families and carrying all their possessions.\nThe endless, dense mass of figures, possibly numbered in the millions!\nThis is a beastmen coalition army composed of several super-large tribes surviving at the Bloody Border. For some unknown reason, these super-large tribes, which used to act alone and even had numerous conflicts with each other, strangely united and moved slowly toward the Bloody Border.\nThis time, the beastman raid is larger than any previous one!\nShortly after, the massive beastman troops began to stop and rest. In the center of the beastman tents, several powerful and distinct beastmen leaders gathered in a large tent, while outside, groups of elite beastman guards were mutually wary and patrolled around.\n\"...The spread of those things is too fast; we have no time and no retreat. We must breach the human Great Wall within these months, or all our sons will perish!\"\n\"...The Great Wall is not that easy to breach; what if we can't breach it?\"\n\"...We'll see; if we can't, then let's negotiate with the humans. I think they wouldn't want to deal with those things either.\"\n...\n\"How is the preparation of the rear base point, which concerns the safety of all of us?\"\n\"...Our rear base points are mostly complete. But what about you, Blood Claw? Why is there no news from the southeast side?\"\n\"...Hmph! Just take care of the area you're responsible for. We've already sent people to investigate on our side, and we'll notify you of the results!\"",

This feeling is especially strong for Austin, who senses the ominous signs of an impending storm.\nThis period is a good opportunity for hunting. In previous years, the forest was filled with various animals just waking from hibernation, but this year there are even more animals, including giant beasts, forcing the Dragon's Nest Army to increase patrol frequencies to nip dangers in the cradle.\n\"Something is definitely going to happen, perhaps those large tribes on the border know something.\"\nNow, Austin's early followers from the Dragon Nest Race, the current Dragon Nest Tribe's first warrior, Lizardman Rodney, once lived in a large tribe on the border that was destroyed, as did the Fox-faced Man Quik, who has a similar origin. From them, Austin learned that since a few years ago, raids on the human Bloody Border by those large tribes have been increasing, and conflicts among the powers have also become more frequent.\nAt that time, Austin thought it was due to the Bloody Great Wall finally being perfected after hundreds of years, greatly preventing Beastmen from invading the human world for food, leading to \"internal conflicts\" among the Beastman tribes. Now, it seems this is not the case.\nAustin also inquired with the Dark Elf Adinlek and captured members of the Blood Claw Tribe branch, but they only knew about the chaotic state on the border and nothing else, not even understanding why they established bases nearby.\nNonetheless, the information they provided about several large super tribes on the border beginning to unite and attack the Bloody Border was even more intriguing to Austin.\n\"What exactly is the danger?\"\nThis perplexing situation instinctively made Austin feel uneasy, but the unease had not yet developed to a point of menacing dread. Moreover, with the Dragon Nest Race's development reaching this stage, Austin had some confidence in facing future dangers.\n\"Although I don't know what's happening, this could also be an opportunity.\"\nWith the rampant beasts, magic beasts, and giant beasts, apart from the Dragon Nest Tribe, nearby Beastman tribes were unable to ensure their safety, leading to a large population being annexed and absorbed by the Dragon Nest Tribe. The population of the Dragon Nest Tribe has now surpassed the 5,000 mark.\nMoreover, with the Dragon Nest Tribe's current strength, the massive animal herds merely provide a large food supply for the tribe. Luckily, after every clean-up of surrounding animal and giant beasts, more herds would pass by in a couple of days, ensuring no food shortages due to the population surge.\n\"However, preparations must be made to face dangers; let's first implement the Beastman armament plan.\"\nThe magic-modified version of the Navy Six Techniques is now fully developed with three techniques: Iron Block, Gale Wave, and Shave. However, it still takes some time for the core Dragon Vein Attendants to master these techniques, and Austin's plan to arm the Beastmen naturally is about true armament.\nAfter a whole winter's three-month development attempt, the Goblins have perfected the manufacturing process of Copper Artifacts. Though they haven't refined what Austin remembers as \"Bronze,\" those Copper Alloy Weapons are not inferior to ordinary Iron Weapons.\nWith the end of winter, weather constraints vanished, enabling Beastmen to conduct large-scale blast furnace production work.Discover more novels at novel⦿fire.net\nTo arm the Dragon Nest Tribe's army, Austin diverted a significant amount of Beastman labor to copper refining, slowing down land reclamation work. However, using copper tools, farming familiar land is much easier than pioneering forestland. Despite many being pulled for farming, the speed of reclaiming and planting work has not decreased compared to the previous year but has accelerated instead.\nBut Austin has some concerns; if that unknown change affects the Dragon Nest Tribe, the tribe might have to relocate. Thus, today Austin didn't issue new reclamation tasks, only having the Beastmen plant on the previously reclaimed fields.\nTo maximize planting effectiveness, nearly every piece of land was planted with kudzu, with other grain seeds left only for reserves.\nOn the other hand, to realize Austin's vision of an armed Beastman army, at the Copper Mine Base, a large number of Beastmen constructed blast furnaces using local materials.\nThen vast amounts of charcoal were produced, and together with the ore, were poured into the furnaces for large-scale smelting.\nWith copper axes, tree felling became much easier. The surrounding forest was rapidly disappearing, turned into raw materials for copper refining. Plumes of smoke rose from the blast furnaces, covering the Copper Mine Base's sky almost the entire day. In Austin's previous modern world, he would likely be caught the next day for air pollution and environmental damage.\nBut this is Otherworld, and such pollution hardly amounts to a drop in the ocean and is likely swiftly absorbed and purified by nature.\nAs the blast furnaces burned furiously, sets of heavy, simple copper armor, copper spears, copper swords, and copper arrows flowed from assembly lines, equipping the Beastman army.\nAfter more than ten days, all Dragon Nest Beastmen army armament plans had been completed.\nLooking at the vast open space, where ranks of well-equipped and spirited Beastman army stood, Austin's confidence grew stronger.\nThis fully metal-armed force is likely unparalleled in the entire Kawa Great Forest, only the unique possession of Austin's Dragon Nest Legion.\nWith the completion of the Dragon Nest Legion's armament plan, the Legion's strength has significantly increased. The impact against the recent rampages of wild beasts and giant beasts around is immediately apparent.\nBefore this, to minimize losses, every hunting army of the Dragon Nest Legion had to consist of at least 200 members when venturing out.\nNow, with copper spears, copper armor, and other weapons and armor, even a hunting group of a few dozen Beastmen won't face unexpected situations, and their gains are not less than before. This greatly enhanced the mobility of the Dragon Nest Legion and significantly increased the hunting gains of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAfter arming the Dragon Nest Legion, the daily prey the Dragon Nest Tribe gained increased by several percent.\nThe effectiveness of metal weapons in hunting is so good that in wartime, their enhancement of other Beastman tribes' combat power would likely be even greater.\nHowever, with the completion of the Dragon Nest Legion armament plan, Austin did not proceed to broadly re-outfit all Dragon Nest Beastmen, only producing a large number of copper spears for the Beastman militia, without fully equipping them with copper armor, while the remaining production Beastmen were only collectively assigned copper-made hoes, shovels, and other production tools.",

Each race has its own distinct advantages. Thus, in the context of surplus combat strength, a policy where everyone becomes a soldier, adversely affecting production and life, is not appropriate.\nConsidering various factors, Austin has decided to implement an elite soldier policy, selecting the strongest and most robust beastmen from the large population and training them intensively to form the most formidable fighting force, the Dragon Nest Legion. Equipped with weapons and armor, this will generate a combat strength far beyond the ordinary legion's power.\nSimultaneously, Austin is promoting Breathing Techniques within the Dragon Nest Legion to further enhance the beastmen soldiers' abilities. He selects the most outstanding among them to transform into Dragon Vein Beastmen and then picks the strongest from the core Dragon Vein Guard to undergo Magic Modification, substantially boosting the core combat power with the cultivation of the Navy's three techniques.\nBy advancing step by step in this manner, the resulting elite core even possesses one or two parts of his own combat strength. Combined with a large armed beastmen legion, this significantly bolsters Austin's confidence.\n\"I've developed Shave, utilizing the recoil from multiple bursts of Fighting Qi in an instant underfoot to move rapidly.

Within the entire tribe, even the militia and productive beastmen have undergone military training and possess a certain level of military literacy. Although they are usually responsible for production rather than combat, if a crisis arises, arming them would turn them into a large group of well-trained, qualified soldiers.\n\"Although I don't know what this unease is, this is the best preparation I can achieve.\"\nGazing at the beastmen legion below, crafted entirely by his own efforts, Austin muses silently.\nHe steps forward, his massive frame towering over the scene, his enormous pupils reflecting the densely packed figures below. An invisible pressure spreads from him, enveloping the entire square, making the air feel several degrees heavier to all the beastmen.\n\"....Two years ago, there was nothing here! But today, two years later, you possess everything you couldn't imagine back then! Go forth and fight! For our glory!\"\nHigh upon the stone platform, Austin spreads his wings, his voice resonating like thunder.\n\"Long live! Long live Your Highness!\"\nA massive wave of sound rises overwhelmingly as the beastmen soldiers below display a fanatical look in their eyes, their shouting turning their faces red, and their copper spears rhythmically striking the ground.\nAfter two years of constant indoctrination, these beastmen soldiers' loyalty to Austin has become similar to fanaticism, easily stirred by his words.\nWith weapons and armor in place, the long-prepared Dragon Nest Tribe finally sets out once again.\nA large number of beastmen soldiers, fully equipped with armor and weapons, began departing Dragon Nest Town, launching attacks in all directions under the lead of the elite Dragon Vein Guard, conducting a sweeping campaign in the surrounding regions, attacking and annexing nearby beastmen tribes.\nIn previous upheavals, many beastmen tribes within a hundred-mile radius of the Dragon Nest Tribe collapsed due to an inability to fend off various external crises, becoming wandering beastmen eventually joining the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nHowever, the hundred-mile range is vast, with countless hidden beastmen tribes scattered like stars in the forest. A considerable number of beastmen tribes still survive, and the total population of all these tribes within the hundred-mile range exceeds thirty thousand.\nTo resist unknown dangers and with the recent abundance of wild animals providing an easy food source to support rapid population growth, Austin began a massive annexation of beastmen tribes within the extensive range, hoping to swiftly increase the Dragon Nest Tribe's population and greatly enhance its strength.\nUnder the copper-armored torrent of the Dragon Nest Legion, even tribes where Extraordinary Beastmen are rare are swiftly overwhelmed and destroyed. Teams of captives are sent into the Dragon Nest Tribe for military training and transformation, strengthening the tribe's power.\nBesides gaining a large influx of new residents during this period, the Dragon Nest Tribe occasionally obtained unique finds from these small tribes, such as beastmen elites with self-awakened Extraordinary Abilities, beastmen priests with certain magical gift abilities, and some small tribes even produced \"wizards\" and similar figures.\nOf course, these \"wizards\" are not true wizards. These beastmen \"wizards\" don't possess any real Extraordinary Abilities, but through long-term practice, they learned to identify certain herbs in the forest and understand basic healing techniques, thus gaining reverence and worship from their tribes.\nNevertheless, the integration of these beastmen \"wizards\" has somewhat strengthened and improved the Dragon Nest Tribe's medical system.\nBeyond these gains, the Dragon Nest Beastmen Legion also collected various spoils like Totem Poles, Sacred Artifacts, Divine Stones, and other miscellany while sweeping through those small tribes. However, after Austin's identification, most were deemed useless and discarded in a corner of the warehouse, with only a couple carefully saved by Austin.\nFor example, fragments engraved with unknown lines and runes, a sacred artifact resembling an electric lamp worshipped by an ignorant beastmen tribe, which absorbs sunlight by day and glows at night, or a spearhead with twisted snake-like engravings...\nSuch items resemble nothing the beastmen, still living in an era of ignorance, could manufacture. Their origins remain an unsolved mystery.",

Clearly, the Beastmen couldn't have created these items.\nRegarding those mysterious artifacts, after failing to find any clues, Austin stored them at the bottom of a trunk. This world's mysterious objects are too numerous, like the lake reservoir near Dragon's Nest that seemed formed by a meteorite crater, along with the things lurking inside; Austin couldn't figure them out yet, nor did he intend to uncover their secrets.\nThese things are best left to unfold naturally.\nAs the Dragon Nest Legion launched large-scale attacks, sweeping across the lands, various tribes collapsed under the relentless copper-armored torrents of the Dragon Nest Legion, resulting in a significant increase in the number of Beastmen within the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nWhile Austin trained and adapted these Beastmen into the army, he also prioritized the prompt onset of production work to ensure a stable food supply for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAt the same time, Austin didn't ignore the unease in his heart.\nWhile the Dragon Nest Legion pushed forth in all directions, Austin pulled some of its elite forces and, centering around the elite Dragon Vein Guard trained with Cultivation Fruit Modified Three Techniques, formed an investigation team to explore westward.\nEven before the investigation team set off, Quik and other Dragon Nest Beastmen had already discerned, through traces of migrating beasts, that most of these animals seemed to be coming from the west, hinting at an upheaval originating from there.\nHowever, despite suspecting the unknown upheaval stemmed from the west, the Dragon Nest Beastmen reconnaissance team discovered no traces within at least a hundred miles of the Dragon Nest Tribe's domain.\nBeastmen scouts noted, though, that the further west they traveled, the more apparent it became that these beasts migrated from west to east, with traces of beast herds or Giant Beasts migrating east growing more visible.\nWhat might have caused these beasts to migrate, forcing even Giant Beasts to depart?\nTo decipher this situation, after equipping copper weapons, Austin selected the finest team from the Dragon Nest Tribe to explore as far west as possible.\n...\nAt this time, about two hundred miles west of the Dragon Nest Tribe, a team of Beastmen, weary and dust-laden, rested amidst the dense forest.\n\"Rodney, we've been away from the tribe for over half a month and have traveled far enough that going further might prevent us from returning.\"\n\"Indeed, we haven't found anything along the way; perhaps there is no event occurring at all, merely our overly cautious concern.\"\nThe core Dragon Vein Beastmen of the team gathered together, conversing in council.\nSince being tasked with investigating the source and leaving the Dragon Nest Tribe, they've journeyed for more than half a month, traveling light with few breaks, pushing at least two hundred miles from the core of the Dragon Nest Tribe with an entirely elite crew.\nHaving traveled this great distance without uncovering any clues, even team members had started considering reporting back instead.\nOne person spoke, followed by another, gradually swaying the leading Lizardman Rodney.\n\"Let's go for two more days; throughout this journey, you should have noticed that wild animals have significantly decreased. If there are no accidents, we might be close to the source... If we still find nothing, then we'll return.\"\nDespite being somewhat tempted, Rodney did not agree to return.\nIn truth, beginning a few days ago, the surrounding wildlife started thinning out. At first, everyone in the team was both excited and alert, yet after walking several days, no abnormalities were discovered.\nBut Rodney clearly didn't wish to abandon the mission halfway.\nRodney's the leader; naturally, the Beastmen followed his orders, and thus the Beastmen continued onward.\nTwo days later,\n\"That range of mountains...\"\nFrom atop a towering ancient tree, Lizardman Rodney stood on a high branch, staring at the massive mountain range suddenly looming like a city wall, rising abruptly from the land along a north-south axis, obstructing the view ahead.\nIf they could climb the mountains, perhaps they could see farther.\nRodney pondered silently,\nAt such a height, visibility would be substantial; and if nothing could be found atop the mountains, they'd have to report back to Dragon Nest Tribe—the exploration mission thus marked a failure.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the n̷o̷v̷e̷l̷f̷i̷r̷e̷.net\nAfter a moment's contemplation, Rodney leapt from the trunk, landing on the ground below.\n\"Everyone, muster strength; if we find nothing upon climbing the mountains, we'll return!\"\nThe originally weary Beastmen's expressions were suddenly revitalized, spirits lifting high.\nHaving marched rapidly in exploration, constantly dodging dangers within the forest, their stretched nerves were nearly at the breaking point, and returning for rest would be most desired.\n\"Let's go!\"\nThe team headed toward the mountains, passing through a sunken plain when Rodney noticed beneath the fallen leaves were numerous fruit seeds. Upon closer inspection, the hills and basin were filled with what seemed to be fruit-bearing trees; however, given the recent ending of winter a few months back, the flowers had withered, leaving young fruits about the size of fingernails.\nRodney recognized a few of these trees, resembling wild apples from Austin's previous life; they aren't uncommon in Kawa Great Forest, though usually scattered sparsely. However, burgeoning so densely was rare.\n\"Be cautious; there might be enemies!\"\nRecalling the Dragon Nest Tribe's vine cultivation scenes and observing the densely fruit-laden area, Rodney cautioned the team against other Beastmen possibly planting this concentrated orchard.\nThe Dragon Nest Beastmen, wary, scanned their surroundings while carefully traversing the forest.\nInexplicably, it felt as though something might be hidden amidst the dense forest, obscured from view.\nThe journey remained uneventful, and their previous concerns appeared to be mere illusions.\nUpon passing through the wild orchard and reaching the mountain foot, feeling slightly relaxed,\n\"Watch out, danger!\"\nSuddenly, pairs of glowing green eyes flared within the shadowed woods, shadows emerged from the dense forest.\n\"What's happening!!!\"\nThese Dragon Nest Beastmen were seasoned veterans of Dragon Nest Tribe, accustomed to dreadful, fierce Giant Beasts, able to handle them calmly. But now, as the shadows sporadically appeared amidst forest trees, all Dragon Nest Beastmen, including Rodney, abruptly tightened their pupils...",

      "content": "Sometime unnoticed, the Dragon Nest Beastman team within the dense forest had been encircled by enemies, countless humanoid shadows appearing amid the forest shadows.\nIt would be fine if they were merely enemies; during this expedition, there were times they accidentally wandered into other Beastman Tribe territories and were besieged, but they easily broke through such encirclements thanks to their formidable skills.\nEven when facing enemies several times their number, the Dragon Nest Beastman team led by Rodney, selected from the elite of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe, would not feel much fear, as they are battle-hardened and powerful warriors.\nBut the scene before them clearly defied common sense.\nThe enemies encircling them were gray ape creatures, covered head to toe in fur, with long hands, hanging from the trees holding wooden spears.\nGray apes, living among various Beastman tribes in Kawa Great Forest, rank in the upper-middle tier. Born with strong limbs, they can confront ordinary middle-tier tribes undisadvantaged on flat ground. With superb climbing skills, they are extremely agile in forest leaps, even able to compete with higher-tier species like gray bears without inferiority.\nEven Dragon Nest Tribe has gray apes, though typically they live on trees or in mountainous areas, collecting food easily thanks to their prowess. Thus, gray ape tribes are relatively stable, rarely disbanding into rogue Beastmen due to some reason.\nThe gray apes gathered by the Dragon Nest Tribe were only some old, weak, sick abandoned by their tribe, joining Dragon Nest Tribe by strokes of luck.\nRodney had naturally seen gray apes before and understood their strength as a species, but regardless of their might, gray apes are ordinary Beastmen; meanwhile, Rodney had been transformed by the grace of His Highness Austin and learned the \"Beastman Three Techniques,\" surpassing common Beastmen in power. In addition, being elite himself, with other elite Dragon Vein Guard companions in the team, even doubling their number of gray apes posed no fear.\nThe true cause for awe among Lizardman Rodney and his team was the current condition of the gray apes!\nThose eyes! Desiccated, deathly green like lifeless puppets, yet filled with madness and greedy desire. Pointed teeth pierced through decayed lips, staring fixedly at them as if they were giant walking meat.\nMore horrifying was their current state; gray furred bodies developed large patches of blue fungi, where it spread, fur dried and fell off, skin rotted exposing a stench, some parts even ate away muscles revealing skeleton beneath, flies buzzing around...\n\"What are these things!\"\nAll Dragon Nest Beastmen present stood with bristling hair, gasping cold breaths.\nThe gray apes here, their faces stiff with no change, were unlike living beings, more like corpses rising from the earth, their skins rotting and molding as a result.\n\"Seems we're getting close to the truth...\"\nRodney tightly gripped his Copper Greatsword; even the most dull should now suspect prior Beast migrations likely relate to these.\nBeing merely watched by these strange gray apes brought forth a chilling terror sensation.\nThat feeling, as if corpses climbed from Hell, stared lustfully at your flesh, chilling the spine.\n\"Hello, we are...\"\nIn the cold tense atmosphere, Rodney tested speaking, though the odd creatures like dead bodies, he wanted to see if interaction was possible.\nYet the next moment,\nRoar!!!\nAmong the odd gray apes, a leader larger and robust than usual, half its head decayed and most fur fallen, skin covered with blue fungi, roared.\nThe sound distinctly differed from normal gray apes, more like a broken wooden bellows forcing out a final wretched cry, chilling to the bone.Fresh chapters posted on novｅlfire.net\nWith its roar, eerie gray apes charged at the Dragon Nest Beastman team.\n\"Be ready, defend!\"\nRodney's pupils shrank; with his order, prepared Dragon Nest Beastmen swiftly closed into a circle, raising copper spears two, three meters high, ensemble of spears surrounding like a hedgehog.\nYet faced with sharp spears, gray apes from the dense forest shadows charged without care, stiffly leaping directly onto them.\nThud thud thud...\nIn resounding flesh impacts, spears easily pierced the charging gray apes,\nMore horrifying still, the blood flowing from these strange gray apes was green!\nBut before Dragon Nest Beastmen could be alarmed, more gray apes continued charging, shadows leaping like waves nearly drowning them.\n\"Hold firm!\"\nRodney took a deep breath, swinging arcs with his giant copper sword, any gray ape that approached was easily sliced in half by the Fighting Qi-imbued great sword.\nTightly packed Long Spear Array increased the number of gray apes on the ground, ordinary without piercing the long spear formations strictly trained to counter the Beastmen of Kawa Great Forest.\nAs time passed, under the assault of so many eerie gray apes, the entire Long Spear Array began to waver.\n\"Damn it, what exactly are these things!\"\nWith one swing splitting two leaping gray apes, Rodney's face turned extremely grim.\nThese gray apes were too strange, fearing nothing, unfeeling pain, throwing themselves in despite severe damage, like undead coveting live flesh.\n\"This cannot continue; a breakthrough must be found, or it's troublesome!\"\nIf facing other Beastman tribes, with the bravest few warriors slashed by the Dragon Nest Legion Long Spear Array, ninety percent of teams would collapse.\nBut these odd gray apes? Despite half lost and ground covered in companion corpses, they remain indifferent, charging like puppets without selves.",

      "content": "\"A breakthrough...\"\nEven though the Dragon Nest Tribe's long spear array is formidable, under the relentless assault of these eerie gray ape creatures, after killing several times their own number of enemies, the Dragon Nest Beastmen have nearly reached their limit. If a breakthrough cannot be found, they will ultimately be defeated.\nRodney's gaze shuttled through the chaotic figures, finally fixing on the eerie gray ape leader who kept making strange cries.\nIn this world, Beastmen have a unified Orc language. Maybe the nasal sounds of Kobolds and Minotaurs are different, but they all understand the meaning to be similar.\nIt's said this unified language is a gift from the Divine, and throughout the Kawa Great Forest, practically every Beastman speaks this one language.\nHowever, Rodney couldn't understand the strange cries of that gray ape. It didn't sound like communication but more like a twisted struggle, a ghostly wailing.\n\"It's him!\"\nRodney's gaze was fixed on that guy compared to other gray ape creatures, the fungus on the gray ape leader was significantly larger, half his head had already rotted away, appearing to be more severely corrupted by those inexplicable eerie forces.\nMore importantly, despite Rodney not understanding his strange cries, from his reactions and actions, it seemed he was commanding the gray ape creatures' attack.\n\"I can only dare to try.\" Rodney calculated secretly, pondering deeply.\nThere was still a large distance between him and the gray ape leader. Numerous gray ape creatures blocked Rodney's breakthrough route, and Rodney also didn't think these eerie gray apes would simply let him break through and kill the king.\n\"Although I haven't completely mastered these moves, there's no other choice now!\"\nRodney tightly gripped the Great Sword with both hands, raising it above his head. Inside him, Fighting Qi explosively surged, streams of air rising from beneath his feet.\n\"Shunpo!\"\nBang!!!Content originally comes from novel_fіre.net\nThunderous sounds suddenly exploded, the Fighting Qi gathered beneath Rodney's feet continuously erupted several times, exerting massive counterforce.\nThe next moment,\nRodney's figure suddenly vanished, leaving only a large, spiderweb-like crack on the ground, a frenzy of air currents sweeping out violently.\n\"That is...\"\nAll around, the Dragon Nest Beastmen widened their eyes, staring incredulously at where Rodney had suddenly disappeared before their eyes.\nWhile the gray ape creatures rushing in, had no reaction at all, but in fact, they didn't need to react.\n\"Gale Wave One-Line Slash!\"\nIn an instant, Rodney's figure appeared behind the gray ape leader,\nA dazzling, white beam swept through the void in an instant, drawing from Rodney's original position, extending to Rodney's Great Sword. That light seemed to cut the whole space in half.\nAlong the way, those gray ape creatures that had leaped into the air were all split from the waist by an invisible weapon, even the surrounding trees were cleaved in two, slipping to the ground.\n\"That is... the Combat Technique developed by His Highness Austin!\"\nWitnessing this scene, all the beastmen widened their eyes, as the elite of the Dragon Nest Tribe, they knew about Austin developing Combat Techniques. Some in the team even cultivated these techniques, though time was short and they hadn't yet achieved significant results.\nBut no matter what, they never expected the power of these techniques to be so formidable!\nThe surrounding gray ape creatures also stopped,\nNot because they were struck with terror by the sword into a stupor but because the gray ape leader's head was also being severed.\nThese eerie gray ape creatures seemed to lose command without the leader's directives, standing blindly where they were. Upon seeing the Dragon Nest Beastmen gathered together, they drooped their dry, green eyes, staggering towards the beastmen.\nWithout the leader, they still attacked the Dragon Nest Beastmen, but their pace was extremely slow, unlike before when they threw themselves forward like moths to a flame.\nWith this change, the Dragon Nest Beastmen let out a long sigh, gradually exterminating these sluggish gray apes.\n\"Cough cough...\"\nMeanwhile, Rodney stood pale on the ground, coughing up a mouthful of blood.\nShunpo, a magic-modified Combat Technique from Navy Six Techniques' 'Shave,' differed from its original body's pure movement. Shunpo uses Fighting Qi gathered beneath the feet to instantly erupt multiple times, generating counterforce for movement.\nThis instantaneous movement beyond visual perception exerts immense pressure on the body. Although Rodney successfully used it and slayed the gray ape leader with Gale Wave, the powerful pressure left his body severely injured.\n\"No wonder His Highness said, until the body reaches a certain level, not to overuse Shunpo; this pressure is genuinely terrifying...\"\nAfter resting for a while, Rodney returned to the team. By this point, the eerie gray ape creatures, without their leader's command, had been thoroughly cleaned out, leaving only a few struggling captives.\nAround him came gazes of reverence. That prior sword strike was truly stunning, and beastmen are naturally inclined to admire strength. Thus, these gazes were unsurprising.\n\"How is it?\"\nRodney looked at the few gray ape creatures tied with vines in the center, asking the companions around him.\n\"No way to communicate. They've turned into beasts, and their bodies are really eerie.\"\nWatching the eerie gray ape creatures tied tight in vines, still frantically struggling like they lost their reason, Rodney fell silent.\nDried eyes, green blood, moldy and decaying bodies, lost reason, insane bloodlust... all these signs show that this is not simple.\nContemplating briefly, a flash from the sword, Rodney severed the captives with a single strike.\nFacing the stunned gazes around him, Rodney's expression remained unchanged as he spoke:\n\"If we can't get answers, forget it. We don't have time to waste on them. Everyone rest up; soon we'll climb that mountain range. I have a feeling we'll find the answers there.\"\nThe Dragon Nest Beastmen had no objections, as Rodney was already the leader of this expedition, not to mention his previous display of strength had truly won over all the beastmen.\nAn hour later, the Dragon Nest Beastmen began their ascent towards the high mountain.\nUnsurprisingly, atop the mountain lay a crumbling, decayed gray ape tribe, filled with many eerie gray ape creatures. Without their leader's command, they were easily slain by the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nAfter exterminating the gray ape tribe and reaching the highest peak, looking down toward the western region, all the Dragon Nest Beastmen sucked in a breath cold, falling into a deathly silence.\n\"Oh no... this is trouble!!!\"",

      "content": "Standing on the mountain peak, wherever the eyes could see, there were endless hills and plains, and the sights of the front ground were all encompassed.\nYet all the Dragon Nest Beastmen standing before this scene were motionless, the mountaintop rendered silent and still.\nThe land is being eroded!\nOn the Forest Land, the green mist rose like flames, spreading slowly around, where the mist passed, vast expanses of dense forest withered, giant trees decayed and fell one by one, turning the ground barren and blackened, devoid of all vitality.\nFrom high above, blotches covered the entire land like festering wounds on the skin, eerie green mist gathered into towering columns ascending the sky, like immense smoke columns reaching for the heavens.\nFrom the mountaintop, the gaze penetrated those rotting spots on the ground, seeing shadows wandering helplessly like puppets without strings, including both Beastmen and wild beasts, gathering aimlessly, wandering around densely, showing no signs of life.\nRodney even saw several gigantic beasts being corroded, one with half of its head already rotten, revealing a grim white skull, its movements seemed rigid, but not fallen dead. Another had its belly swollen, white ribs piercing through from the inside, thick green liquid flowing constantly...\nThese did not possess the fierce aura that giant beasts previously encountered had, but were filled with an eerie sense of rigidity, decay, and death.\nThe feeling was as though the world ahead was a paradise of wandering undead ghosts, devouring all living creatures, leaving even the fearsome giant beasts, Magic Beasts, and plants on the ground not spared.\nAll creatures throughout the land were reduced to puppets of rotting corpses, though a vast number of beings were still moving densely on the land, it instilled a bone-chilling cold sensation in all Beastmen, as if facing a Netherworld filled with death.\nRecalling those bizarre gray apes before, perhaps they were akin to those wandering creatures on the land, originally one of their own, eroded by some eerie power that awakened them from death, reduced to puppet zombies.\nFacing this vast scene, Rodney felt as if the whole world was gradually being eroded by a terrifying and strange force, not only transforming the entire land into its desired vision but also infecting living creatures to manipulate them into puppets.\nMarking the boundary of this mountain range, gazing westward, colossal columns of green smoke rose to the sky, densely rotting figures continued to wander and spread across the land, carrying the seeds of green smoke, seemingly intent on infecting the entire world.\nThe scene ahead was already thus, then what about the farther west?\nSince last year, signs had already begun to appear, how much more would the western Forest Land become eroded? Would the entire western land be practically turned into a paradise for those monsters?\n\"Let's go back first and report the events to His Highness Austin.\"\nGiven the current situation, even the most oblivious Beastman knew things were dire, and the only way to make a decision was after reporting to His Highness Austin.\nSuch an all-encompassing eroding force was truly terrifying!\n...\nMeanwhile, the Dragon Nest Tribe was entering a phase of fiery development.\nAfter more than a month's sweep, centered around the Dragon Nest Tribe, various Beastman tribes within a hundred-mile radius had been conquered, numerous Beastmen became captives, integrated into the Dragon Nest Tribe and subjected to military reform training.\nThe tribe's population has now officially surpassed twenty thousand, with the influx of people, once training is completed, the strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe is bound to experience a new surge in growth.\nDuring this round of sweeping, Austin not only acquired several odd items, but also boosted the number of Extraordinary Beastmen within the tribe.\nWithin this hundred-mile radius, there are about a hundred Beastman tribes, varying in size; while the area Austin occupies rarely produced Extraordinary Beastmen, with such a large number, some would inevitably awaken Extraordinary Seeds independently, or lucky ones having ingested Magic Fruit to tread the Extraordinary path. These Extraordinary Beastman captives were, of course, treated differently, disciplined and trained to correct their previous dispositions, before being absorbed into the Extraordinary Beastman Legion.\nHowever, as Austin saw it, the greatest harvest from this sweeping was not the twelve thousand Beastman captives, nor those bizarre and unknown creations, nor the handful of Extraordinary Beastmen, but rather a captive old Beastman Priest from a thousand-member Beastman tribe and the yield from that tribe.\nThis thousand-member Beastman tribe was considered a long-standing local community, not only did the tribe possess herbal knowledge providing a considerable supplement to the medical system of the Dragon Nest Tribe, but the old Beastman Priest also held knowledge of mysterious Extraordinary Abilities, albeit incomplete, it still supplemented the Dragon Nest Tribe's current deficiency in mysteries.Read full story at N0v3l.Fiɾe.net\nThis knowledge was, indeed, the most valuable treasure acquired by the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAdditionally, during the conquest of that Beastman tribe, Austin discovered a new food crop – the Otherworld version of taro.\nEarly in the construction of the Dragon Nest Tribe, to secure enough food and establish a solid foundation for the tribe, Austin began reclamation work, leading Beastmen to cultivate kudzu and other food crops within the forest from scratch.\nThe primary crop cultivated was kudzu, later, to ensure food security, Austin initiated a diversified planting plan, increasing the variety of food crops; however, aside from kudzu, other collected food plants yielded extremely low, only one-tenth of kudzu, resulting in later cultivated land primarily consisting of kudzu.\nBack then, even though Austin obtained a piece of taro during the attack on one tribe, with only one piece, large-scale breeding and planting were difficult, for taro cultivation to stand alongside kudzu, it would take years at least, unexpectedly now finding the origin of taro in this thousand-member tribe, allowing this year's food crop to be divided between kudzu and taro.\nThis sweep clearing the Beastman tribes within a hundred-mile radius indeed greatly increased the strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe, yet the surge of population brought a certain degree of trouble to the tribe.",

      "content": "The surge in population initially posed a tremendous food pressure on the Dragon Nest Tribe. The population of twenty thousand meant that last year's stored food was completely consumed.\nFortunately, for some unknown reason, large herds migrated past, and with the introduction of new bronze weapons, the hunting efficiency of the Dragon Nest Beastmen was significantly improved. They were able to continuously procure large amounts of meat from the forest every day.\nAt the same time, animal husbandry within the Dragon Nest Tribe also reached a certain level, coupled with the use of rope nets made from last year's harvested kudzu vines during the cold winter. They were also able to catch large amounts of fish from rivers and lakes, which, to some extent, alleviated the food crisis in the Dragon Nest Tribe, allowing them to barely sustain themselves.\nDuring this period, the Dragon Nest Beastmen did not neglect the tasks of reclamation and cultivation.\nThanks to the successful crafting of bronze farming tools, the speed of reclaiming land by the Beastmen increased many times over. Both plowing and tree cutting speeds significantly accelerated. To further expedite the land reclamation, the newly captured Beastmen were driven to the fields to assist with the work while undergoing military training and transformation.\nUnder the extensive construction by all Dragon Nest Beastmen, the reclaimed fields of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe now spanned nearly over five thousand acres, extending from the plains in all directions. The crisscrossing fields evoked a sense of awe.\nWhen the first crop of kudzu vines was successfully harvested, the entire tribe's food crisis was subsequently resolved. However, this was far from success, as the kudzu harvest alone could not completely support the consumption of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe. Beastmen still needed to hunt large numbers of wild animals from the forest every day.\nThe population brought tremendous food pressure to the tribe, simultaneously imposing severe housing pressure on the Dragon Nest Base.\nPreviously, due to the cold winter, it was impossible to make bricks by mixing mud, so no house expansions had been undertaken in Dragon Nest Town. During the cold winter, Beastmen continuously joined the tribe, and by the end of winter, the housing situation had become extremely urgent.\nIt wasn't until the Dragon Nest Legion launched missions all around, sweeping nearby Beastman Tribes, capturing Beastmen and sending them back, that the last straw broke the back of Dragon Nest Town. The existing houses could no longer accommodate so many people.\nTo meet the enormous housing demand, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe had to undertake major expansions.\nUnder Austin's guidance, squads of Beastman militia were deployed to build the town. According to the plan, the curtain walls around the tribe were directly dismantled. Meanwhile, the brick kiln on the mountain operated at full capacity, producing a large number of bricks daily, which were transported into the tribe to build wood and brick structures. These houses occupied vast tracts of land, turning the entire tribe town into a large construction site, expanding visibly outward.\n\"When constructing, pay attention to spacing between houses to ensure fire safety, and also consider the routes for movement and support between neighborhoods. If enemies infiltrate and cause disruption, the rescue teams need to be able to respond quickly...\"\nStanding on the high platform, looking at the expanded town below, which had become like a massive construction site, Austin instructed Vini at his side.\nBecause of the previous consideration for fire safety, the mercenaries' attempt to sneak in and cause chaos by setting fires did not achieve much. However, it did reveal some issues, like inadequate building layouts and the inability of the Dragon Nest Beastmen stationed within the tribe to provide timely support.\nWith the experience from last time, this time, the major expansion of the base naturally aimed to preserve the good aspects while improving the deficiencies.\n\"Yes, Your Highness.\" Now overseeing all various errands within the tribe, Vini nodded in agreement and recorded Austin's instructions.\n\"How's the progress on the sweeping operations? Have those tribes been thoroughly cleaned and annexed?\"\nLooking at the slowly establishing town below, which he built himself, Austin's eyes shone brightly.\nTwo years ago, when the tribe kinfolk went to war with other Beastman Tribes, the entire Beastman Tribe almost went all out, with the whole army in action, and he had to join them to prevent any accidents.\nBut now, who would have imagined that in just two short years, he only needed to sit in the Dragon's Nest and give a casual command, and numerous clan legions could sweep all directions, annihilating one force after another.\nAnd all of this, the fact that his kinfolk Beastmen under him could achieve such a level, was all due to his own design and creation.\n\"Thanks to Your Highness's earlier decision to raise that pack of Blood Wolves with their keen sense of smell, they have practically cleared out the nearby tribes following their trail. However, within a hundred miles, there are still many dangerous territories we dare not approach.\"\nIn two years, the few Blood Wolf cubs Austin decided to bring back to the tribe had grown up, and the older one was barely hanging on. Although the originally planned Wolf Cavalry was no longer necessary after establishing the Centaur Tribe, the Blood Wolves' keen sense of smell was tremendously helpful to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThese Blood Wolves, raised in the tribe since they were young, had integrated with the Beastmen who raised them, becoming companions.\nWith the help of the Blood Wolves, whether it was herds of wild animals in the forest or Beastman Tribes hidden somewhere in the dense woods, they could be easily discovered. The success of this Dragon Nest Tribe's sweeping plan owed much of its credit to the Blood Wolves' keen sense of smell in accurately locating their strongholds.Check latest chapters at .ɴet\n\"Very well, you've done an excellent job... However, what did you mean by dangerous territories?\"\nAustin was somewhat puzzled. With the current strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe, fully armored and equipped, hundreds or thousands of Giant Beasts have already been slain. What else in the surrounding area could threaten the tribe's Clan?\n\"These are perilous places filled with many dangers, like a swamp plain swarming with mosquitoes, a damp mountain gorge teeming with snakes, a forest perpetually shrouded in dark mist and miasma where it's said a powerful Ice and Snow Lord slumbers among the ice mountains... If we force our army through these places, we will inevitably incur significant losses. According to Quik and the people at the Witch Hospital, these are all Magic Power-rich areas, probably inhabited by extremely fearsome extraordinary creatures, posing immense danger.\"\nIn the forest, various dangers abound. The reason why outcast rogue Beastmen often find themselves facing near certain death and are almost never heard from again is not only because of the rampant wild animals, Magic Beasts, and Giant Beasts within the forest, but also due to the widespread existence of such perilous places.",

      "content": "The territory Austin chose was somewhat remote, with scarce magic resources, but beyond a distance of ten miles, the environment slowly began to change, the terrain varied, and the activity tracks of various magic beasts and giant beasts started to increase frequently.\nWith the Dragon Nest Tribe at its center, a vast plain lay to the east, rich in water resources. Most of the beastman tribes broken through by the Dragon Nest Legion during this time were gathered there. As for what lay further east, Austin was unsure.\nTo the south were endless hills, but it's said that the farther south one goes, closer to the continent and ocean's junction, the harsher the weather becomes.\nThe terrain to the west was rugged, with mountains and forests interspersed with basins and peaks, creating treacherous grounds. Whether crossing those mountain ranges would lead to plains, Austin did not know, as he hadn't ventured far, it being safer to stay at the old nest before growing up.Find the newest release on novel~fire~net\nYet, with the beast migration, sensing the unknown threat from the west, Austin dispatched elite beastmen to explore and gather information, hoping the exploration team would soon return with clear intel on the terrain farther west and perhaps bring back news of the mutation's source.\nAs for the north, it was said that moving continuously northward, the climate gradually became temperate, closer to the temperate climate familiar to Austin from his previous life, eventually reaching the Bloody Border, the battleground of beastmen and humans on the thousand-year battlefront line.\nIn this ever-changing environment, the farther out, as the region expands, dangerous zones with varying environments naturally appear.\n\"Danger zones, huh? This might be an opportunity!\"\nDanger signifies opportunity as well.\nPreviously, the Spider Cave that Rodney discovered was also such a dangerous area, and after Austin led a team to clear out the spiders within, he obtained an entire vein of magic stones.\nNow the essence of the magic stone vein, the most valuable magic crystals, had been extracted and consumed by Austin for his growth, leaving only ordinary magic stones, which could be used for extraordinary transformations for the beastmen, but for Austin, who was now at the quasi-gold level, they were useless.\nQuasi-gold wasn't truly gold; it's more than a typical silver peak, yet still below gold.\nTo break through the bottleneck before reaching the gold level, one could either devour higher-level magic resources or rely on decades for a natural breakthrough with a giant dragon's innate growth power.\nThe latter, taking decades to improve, was clearly unacceptable to Austin, who sought rapid advancement by relying on a dragon's superior digestion capacity, massively consuming abundant magic resources.\n\"Dangerous places also represent tremendous benefits. If I could find several veins like the Spider Cave vein, I'd be confident to become a gold-level dragon by next year.\"\nOnce reaching the gold level, Austin's prowess would be considered a high-level force globally, greatly enhancing his security.\n\"Vini, mark out the locations of those danger zones, prepare accordingly. I'll act together with you and see if we can clear out one of these dangerous areas.\"\nThe thought was promptly followed by action, with an indescribable unease lingering in his mind as the exploration team didn't return, so Austin prepared to face a formidable enemy regardless.\nIf they cleared those danger zones and devoured the magic resources inside to become a gold-level giant dragon, it would be ideal.\nFortunately, as time passed, two months had gone by since the cold winter season. The Dragon Nest Tribe's affairs had nearly been settled, the beastmen captives mostly trained, the previous spoils fully absorbed by the Dragon Nest Tribe, the Beastman Legion fully armored, and morale high, excited to embark on a campaign with the great Austin, with each soldier feeling a fervent worship.\nTwo years ago, Austin began by gathering a ragtag team of wandering kobolds, settling here and gradually developing from a dilapidated small tribe and a young dragon weaker than a wolf—no one could have imagined this combination evolving into its present form.\nFor all this creation and the safekeeping, the shelter from hunger and cold, safe warm homes, and the happy life of having enough food each day, all were given by the great Austin.\nTo go on a campaign with the great Highness Austin, and to contribute their power for their revered leader was considered a very noble honor by all beastman soldiers.\nYet as Austin was about to gather his army to sweep through those nearby danger zones, several members of the beastman exploration team returned, bringing Austin chilling news.\n....\nOver two hundred miles away in the mountains, a giant shadow landed on the mountaintop in the midst of welcoming beastman troops, glaring at the dreadful world beneath the mountains, its pupils contracting sharply.\n\"Hiss, is this an Otherworld version of a biological crisis?!\"\nPreviously, due to unfamiliar routes and avoiding various dangers, the Dragon Nest Beastman reconnaissance team took nearly half a month to arrive at the mountains and discovered a terrifying and eerie world beyond them.\nAustin, having quickly grown with fast flight speed, wasted no time upon learning this news, locating Rodney and the Dragon Nest Beastman exploration team in over half a day.\nUpon discovering the mutation of the world across, the exploration team dispatched several powerful extraordinary beastmen as an elite squad to report back, while most stayed at the cliff, gathering data and organizing to prevent the monster corpses crossing the mountains to invade the eastern plains.\nAfter locating Rodney and others, Austin also witnessed the land being consumed by death and the terrifying scene of a corpse tide like the sea.\n\"What is happening? Has a zombie virus invaded?\"\nFrowning at the land being tainted by that strange green force, anxiety lingered.\nNo wonder an unease always resided within, catching sight of such a menace that manipulates not only beastman corpses but even animals turning them into puppets; how many creatures have been infected in the vast western plains? Austin didn't know, but understood it must be astronomical.\n\"Have you collected any information on those things during this time?\"\nAustin asked Rodney and others while their solemn report obliterated the last bit of hope within Austin....",

      "content": "Their bodies rotting, mad, mindless, bloodthirsty, immeasurably strong, and sluggish in movement....\nThese symptoms are not unlike the zombies in Austin's memories, as if the zombies from the fantasy world of his past life have truly appeared before him, sending chills down his spine.\nWhat left Austin even more silent was, to further confirm the situation, he subsequently instructed Rodney and others to catch a normal rabbit and simultaneously capture a mutated beastman.\nBut after the rabbit was scratched by the captured mutated beastman, it quickly began to have green eyes, growing green splotches on its skin and fur, its body started to rot, and it became insanely violent, trying to bite any living creature it saw, as though infected by a \"zombie virus,\" becoming incredibly frenzied.\nThe behavior pattern of this thing was almost identical to the zombie virus from the entertainment works of Austin's previous life. However, due to some mysterious forces in the Extraordinary World, the real zombie virus seemed to show some differences.\nThere was no doubt that the erosion and infectious power of these eerie forces wreaked havoc among the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\n\"Where exactly did these zombie viruses come from?!\"\nFacing the impending dreadful crisis, Austin couldn't help but frown deeply.\nIf it truly is a zombie virus, how did they appear in this world, and for how long? If those extraordinary lives have also had their wisdom eroded, can it be confirmed that the upcoming crisis is indeed more terrifying?\nA plethora of information was running and processing in his mind, from the initial migration of the beast herds. At least half a year had passed since the discovery of its clues, which meant these zombie viruses had existed for at least half a year.\nNo, that's not correct!\nBefore the Dragon Nest Tribe discovered the beast migration, Austin remembered Rodney, Quik, and others saying that a large tribe at the Bloody Border began frequently attacking the Border Great Wall a few years ago, with wars breaking out frequently between Beastmen and humans, and the chieftains of those large tribes seeming like madmen, refusing to stop until the Great Wall was captured.This content belongs to novel~fire~net\nIf everything is connected, could it be that those top super large Beastman tribes numbering in the hundreds of thousands had long discovered the inklings of a zombie virus and attacked the Bloody Great Wall at all costs?\n\"It's very likely that the Beastman tribes within the Kawa Great Forest are still in a primitive stage, lacking organized formation and professional Beastman armies, making them unable to effectively combat these zombie-like entities.\"\nWithout formations and without sharp metal weapons, if ordinary Beastmen get caught, they become infected and turn into zombies, consequently strengthening the enemy's forces. Only the elites within the Beastman tribes can barely resist, but against these zombie-like entities, even the elite Beastmen can only take down a few before potentially succumbing to the tide of corpses.\nFortunately, these zombie-like monsters have inherited the brainlessness flaw of zombies. Against a well-armed, well-trained Long Spear Array of the Dragon Nest Legion, they stand little chance even if they outnumber the troops several times over, especially since many Beastman Legions are already equipped with three-meter-long spears, armor, and Bronze Shields. Ordinary zombies are mere targets to be mowed down before them.\nThe tight armor and spear formations are best suited to deal with these enemies who charge forward with brute strength. As long as the zombie numbers do not exceed tenfold or even a hundredfold of their own, and as long as the Dragon Nest Legion does not get swallowed by the zombie tide, major issues are unlikely to arise.\n\"There's still a possibility to fight back...\"\nGazing at the tide of corpses struggling to climb the mountain peaks from the plains below, Austin muttered to himself internally.\nThe zombie virus-like green force doesn't seem to spread through the air, at least since the Dragon Nest Beastmen have been here for some time without a single occurrence of infection, indicating that this eerie green force likely spreads through bite infection from infected individuals to uninfected ones.\n\"You all stay here, keep a good watch. I'm going to investigate.\"\nAfter instructing Rodney and the others to stay put, Austin rose into the air before they could say anything and swiftly flew towards the infected land in the west.\n...\nDecay, desolation, large swaths of trees and underbrush vanished, rotting zombie beastmen, animals, and giant beasts wandering slowly through the forest, as though all life had been consumed clean, leaving no sign of vitality.\nFlying above, Austin's eyes grew increasingly grave as he looked down on the scene of devastation.\nThe swirling smoke around him didn't alert his Sixth Sense, but the large zombie tide below undoubtedly presented a daunting challenge.\n\"With these things constantly spreading, to prevent them from affecting the Dragon Nest Tribe, they must be killed one by one. But their sheer numbers are absurd, with beastmen, wild beasts, and even magic beasts and giant beasts among them, what's the approach here?!\"\nThis land is likely entirely overrun, with nothing left of normal organisms.\nAfter pondering momentarily, Austin opened his mouth.\nBlue Dragon Breath,\nRoar! Roar! Roar!\nA mass of gigantic bluish flame roared intensely, spurting from his mouth, stretching into a fire pillar over ten meters long in the air, crashing into the center of the zombie tide, instantly igniting dozens of zombie beastmen, while the others instinctively avoided and fled.\nThe breath power of a Giant Dragon, something Austin rarely used, as previously the magic power within him was feeble, with the produced breath no bigger than a fist and just capable of kindling a small flame, holding little power.\nBut now, as his body grew, the breath of the Giant Dragon became stronger, making it a suitable method for probing attacks.\nWith one breath, amidst the intense howling and rolling of those dozen zombies ignited by the fire pillar, they swiftly reduced to ashes.\n\"A weak bunch, though their strength is one or two points above ordinary Beastmen.\"\nSeeing how easily they were burned to death, Austin silently assessed in his mind.\nWith the Long Spear Array Forest of the Dragon Nest Tribe, they should be able to handle it...\nSubsequently, Austin shifted his gaze onto the other elite zombies, while examining the corrupted magic beasts, searching for ways to deal with them.\nAfter several probes, Austin understood.\nThose elite zombies infected by extraordinary Beastmen, though their brute strength advanced, with their lack of intelligence and reliance on brute force alone—even a team of ordinary Beastmen could handle them with a few vine nets. The giant beasts, too, with neither consciousness nor wisdom, could easily be tripped by Dragon Nest Beastmen using ropes; as for magic beasts, due to their Talent Magic, they were indeed somewhat harder to deal with.",

If only ropes were used, it would be easy for the talent magic of those mutated magic beasts to sever them.\nHowever, it doesn't matter much. Although there were some mutations in the magic beasts' talent magic, their movements have become stiff and sluggish, targeting this weakness is relatively easy.\nWith the completion of the magic-modified Beastman Three Techniques by Austin, the strength of the elite Dragon Vein Attendants in the Dragon Nest Tribe has been greatly enhanced, dealing with zombie magic beasts below the Silver Level poses no problem.\nAfter assessing and understanding the horde, Austin did not immediately turn back but continued forward.\nHe wanted to see how much of this land had been corrupted and whether he could discover the source further in.\nAs Austin flew swiftly, the green on the forest land became less and less, the entire land was spotted and pitted, like it had contracted a rotting syphilis, extremely disgusting, and at the same time, the horde on the ground became much sparser, appearing as if a large part of the horde had spread out in all directions.\nFlying continuously, the scenery on the ground remained the same, only the sky seemed to be dyed a yellow-green by that kind of green smoke.\nAfter flying for minutes, just as Austin was about to turn back, suddenly a huge shadow appeared on the ground ahead, vaguely, one zombie beast after another, zombie beastmen were either carrying rocks or giant logs, heading towards that shadow.\n\"Huh, what is that over there!\"\nSeeing that scene, Austin's eyes lit up, flapping his wings, he hurriedly flew towards that shadow.\nMoments later, that shadow was already in sight,\nit was a colossal pyramid building, with a tower body over a thousand meters tall standing on the distant horizon like a huge hill, one figure after another like ants, densely packed, constructing around it. From Austin's high altitude angle, it looked like a large group of ants building their home.\nAnd those construction teams, indeed, were zombies with half of their bodies already rotted and empty eyes!\nThese brainless zombies of various kinds were actually being driven by some mysterious existence to build such a gigantic pyramid!\n\"What is going on here?\"\nStaring at such a bizarre sight, Austin suddenly felt a wave of dread.\nWhat kind of power is manipulating all this behind the scenes!\nSince when can zombies be driven?\nLooking at the distant zombies carrying building materials in an orderly manner, the massive pyramid under construction, and the four enormous sky-reaching pillars around it, with strange and mysterious carvings, Austin suddenly felt a sense of a gigantic conspiracy rolling out of the darkness, as a massive black hand seemed ready to envelop the entire world.\nJust as Austin fell into idle speculation, suddenly, a great danger, a great horror, causing his whole dragon body to shudder enveloped his mind, all his body hair stood on end, and his heart seemed to plunge straight into an abyss.\nBuzz!!!\nThen he saw on the pyramid's top, a circle of blue light visible to the naked eye rippling out from the void, transforming into a massive sweeping shock fan, a dazzling ball of blue light unknown as to when it had condensed, shot out instantaneously a sky-reaching blue light column, as if it shattered space, appearing instantly before Austin.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novel⚑fire.net\nIn the critical moment, Austin only just managed to twist his body, majestic light brushed past him, that feeling of being like ice piercing the depths instantly made him feel as if he was staring into the abyss of death.\nBoom boom boom!!!\nAmidst earth-shattering loud sounds, the entire world seemed to fall into violent tremors, massive explosions boomed, amidst the blinding blue light, a mushroom cloud reaching the sky rose up, rising up into the cloudless sky, simultaneously a terrible shockwave swept past, large patches of soil were flung into the air by the airstream, ascending skyward.\nAustin only felt as though he was caught in a torrent, his body swayed unstably in the chaotic flow, yet he saw a mountain range thousands of meters behind him directly blasted out into a huge pit.\nAustin dared not linger any longer, his body sped away, flying at a speed surpassing his capabilities into the distance, disappearing in the blink of an eye.\nYet the unknown enemy atop the pyramid, for some reason, did not pursue him, the bluish-glow at the pyramid top quickly dissipated, the land once again fell into silence, as the surrounding zombies continued to work, even the prior massive explosion had not caused any pause.\n...\nA moment later, the disheveled Austin, having fled hundreds of miles away, finally stopped with lingering fear, landing atop a mountain peak.\n\"Damn it, what on earth is that pyramid! What are they building it for? What's with this zombie virus?!\"\nAustin instinctively felt that everything would not be that simple.\nThese zombie creatures possibly were some unknown things created to destroy the world, and simultaneously they enslaved masses of living beings as tools to build the pyramid, furthermore that pyramid under construction perhaps isn't even the end of all this.\nIt's very possible that there are more than one pyramid under construction further to the west, and why are they building these pyramids, aside from unleashing that level of terrifying attacks, are there other functions?\nRegarding this, Austin knew nothing.\nBut he was certain, inside it might hold a greater conspiracy.\n\"The top tribal alliances on the border must know something, after returning, I must find a chance to see if I can contact them!\"\nWhen Austin was scouting before, he found that the power of the horde corroding the land wasn't much, with the strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe, it wasn't necessarily impossible to stop them, but now it seems, things are far from being easily resolved as imagined, at least that mysterious pyramid isn't something he can handle now.\nOnly taking a distant glance, he was nearly obliterated to dust.\nThe life-treasuring Austin now was having second thoughts.\n\"No wonder those large tribal alliances constantly flee to the human world, no, I must prepare a route of retreat.\"\nWith a gloomy mind, taking a deep look at the pyramid's location, Austin directly flew away.\n...\nAt the same time in the copper ore base.\nWith the extensive commencement of copper refining work, the copper ore base was now thriving, high furnaces stood on the hillside flatlands, a large number of kobolds were mining in the field, extracting pieces of copper ore to be transported to the smelting site and poured into the high furnaces.\nInside the high furnaces, heat blazed fiercely, with copper slurry flowing out, molded into earthen patterns, every day a large number of weapons and tools were formed and transported to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nMeanwhile, as the Dragon Nest Beastmen worked passionately at the smelting base, an elite troop of beastmen was slowly exploring over from afar....",

      "content": "On a hill far from the Copper Ore Base, a disorganized group of Beastmen stood at the mountain top, looking at the bustling Copper Ore Base in the distance where numerous blast furnaces continuously spewed black smoke into the sky.Check latest chapters at net\n\"So this is where the base was initially established? It seems that Grom wasn't taken out by those things, but can anyone tell me whose force these Beastmen belong to?\"\nAt the forefront stood a lion humanoid over three meters tall, with golden fur like cast gold, and a half-scarred, imposing head.\nJust by standing there casually, the lion humanoid exuded a terrifying aura, causing the surrounding air to tense up, and a heavy pressure settled on the hearts of all the Beastmen.\n\"I don't know, maybe there's a very powerful Lord here, and Grom accidentally provoked him, so the whole tribe branch was destroyed.\"\n\"Possibly, look at the remnants of the base over there. It should have been the tribe's station at the time, only to be breached and destroyed, then partially rebuilt on the ruins.\"\nBehind him, several Beastmen were chattering, starting to speculate about the situation in front of them.\nThey were the elite Beastmen sent by the Blood Claw Tribe.\nA few years ago, to achieve a certain plan, they had the bears within the tribe lead a group of Beastmen to migrate southeast, hoping to find a suitable place to establish a bridgehead.\nFinally, two years ago, with the strong support of the whole Blood Claw Tribe, whether it be population, weapons, or food, they were adequately supplied. Grom led a group of elite Beastmen and finally established a branch base hundreds of miles to the southwest.\nWith the continuous support from the tribe, the entire tribe branch rapidly expanded, growing from a tribe of dozens within a short time to over a thousand in just a year.\nJust as the branch was about to stabilize, there had been no news from the branch for more than half a year starting from last year.\nAs those things became increasingly rampant, the tribe alliance had to migrate north, striving to break through the human Bloody Great Wall defense. Naturally, they couldn't let the rear become compromised, so the Blood Claw Tribe sent a small elite team to investigate, hoping to clarify whether it was destroyed by a powerful Magic Beast occupying the place or eroded and occupied by those things.\n\"Interesting, are they smelting iron?\"\nLooking at the busy scene in front where numerous earthy-yellow weapons were being cast, with piles of weapons and armor stacked like mountains, the lion humanoid showed a sinister smile.\nBefore coming, they had speculated that the Blood Claw Tribe Branch might have been overrun by those things, which is why they lost all contact. Initially, the lion humanoid didn't even want to come on this dangerous journey.\nBut unexpectedly, there was a pleasant surprise now.\nIn the whole tribe alliance, or even the entire Kawa Great Forest, apart from a few Beastmen who could forge weapons from some ores, the lion humanoid had never seen metal weapons being mass-produced so simply.\nIn his memory, it was only once when the lion humanoid accompanied a Beastman army to breach a human town that he saw so many weapons in a storeroom.\n\"Hiss, those are indeed metal weapons!\"\nHearing the lion humanoid say this, all the Beastmen gathered their eyes on the mountain of weapons and armor produced by the Beastmen at the Copper Ore Base.\nThe tribe alliance's metal weapons mostly came from the spoils of the Human World. In this weathering-the-storm environment, there was no soil for smelting metals to emerge. Most Beastmen still used things like Stone Tools and bone implements.\nInitially, when Grom led the team to establish the branch base, to show support, nearly half of the tribe's iron weapons were given to the Blood Claw Tribe Branch, but they didn't expect these iron weapons eventually became the materials for Austin to use electromagnetic cannon and obliterate Grom.\nMetal weapons represent rarity and value within the Kawa Great Forest!\nIn an instant, all the Blood Claw Beastmen present showed a greedy look on their faces.\nIf they could capture all these Beastmen and take them back to the headquarters as slaves, how much armor and weapons they wanted in the future wouldn't be an issue?!\nAt this moment,\nDragon Nest Beastmen patrol passed by and saw the lion humanoid and all the Blood Claw Tribe elite Beastmen on the mountain top.\n\"Hey, where did you come from?\"\nA huge sound immediately drew the attention of the lion humanoid and others over.\n....\nThe jackal wolf boy Meng Bi always considered himself very lucky,\nInitially, to survive, he and his sister escaped the slave camp, trudging through the icy wilderness. Midway, they found a frozen wolf carcass which they survived on for half a month, eventually carrying his sister Aisha to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThen, their fate changed.\nHis dying sister was saved; they were taken in by the Dragon Nest Tribe. Under the protection of the great His Highness Austin, they ended the days of wandering and escaping from hunger and cold, living a life they wouldn't have dared to dream of before.\nHe was very fortunate. How many old, weak, sick Beastmen were expelled every cold winter? In that white icy wilderness, survival was almost ten to one, but he and his sister fortunately found that one in ten thousand chance and survived.\nFor saving his sister and himself, for this great Dragon Nest Tribe, Meng Bi was very grateful, even willing to lay down his life for Dragon Nest Tribe and His Highness Austin.\nThis was especially true since half a year ago, when Dragon Nest Tribe was attacked by mercenaries, Meng Bi stood out decisively.\nBecause he had His Highness Austin behind him, and because of his sister Aisha, the two most important things in his life were behind him, and because of this, he almost lost his life.\nBut fortunately, he didn't die,\nAlmost half of his body's bones were shattered, but it exchanged for the awakening of the ancient bloodline, commonly known as ancestral return.\nFrom that day on, Meng Bi's name spread throughout the entire Dragon Nest Tribe due to his bravery, and more so for his ancestral bloodline.\nAmong Beastmen, there's a saying that every Beastman whose bloodline has undergone ancestral return is a lucky one blessed by the Beast God, and as long as they don't die, they are bound to achieve great power in the future.\nSubsequently, Meng Bi, along with other brave warriors from that battle, were personally received and commended by Austin. All the Beastmen present were moved to tears, and Meng Bi was promoted directly to join the elite Dragon Vein Guard and was given the Beastman Three Techniques for training, becoming a talent highly cultivated by Austin.",

      "content": "Although looked up to by Austin, the jackal wolf youth Meng Bi did not become arrogant or complacent. Instead, because of His Highness Austin's regard, he felt only an ever-growing pressure on his shoulders.\nIn order to catch up with the progress, besides the daily training, he subjected himself to an additional fifty percent of extra training programs, hoping to solidify his foundation and forge a mighty physique, enhancing his physical strength.\nEvery day, tens of thousands of push-ups, sit-ups, frog jumps, a run of hundreds of kilometers... the volume of physical training was simply terrifying, and everything he did was to meet the basic requirements of the Beastman Three Techniques.\nAmong the Beastman Three Techniques, the most crucial for the effectiveness of any technique is physical strength. Only with strong physical strength can the techniques be used more frequently and achieve greater power.\nWith his current strength in a normal state, he meets even the lowest requirement for Iron Block.\nThe Beastman Three Techniques created by Austin are inspired by the Navy Six Techniques. In the original version of the Navy Six Techniques, without the boost from Fighting Qi, it all relied on the body's strength to achieve body techniques.\nThese body techniques, while extremely powerful, also impose high demands on the user's body.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novel·fire·net\nTake Shave, for example: if one's physical fitness does not meet the standards, even if one can kick the ground several times in an instant to achieve the speed of Shave, the body will endure immense pressure due to the powerful acceleration. If fitness does not meet the standard, there's a possibility of body collapse during swift movement with Shave.\nMeng Bi is very aware that his physical quality hasn't even achieved the requirements of the simplest Iron Block.\nEvery time he thinks of the great power when those senior Dragon Vein Attendants utilize the Beastman Three Techniques, Meng Bi's heart surges with agitation.\nAs for the magnificent His Highness Austin who created these three techniques, he is full of admiration.\nWhat kind of extraordinary wisdom is required to create such mighty Divine Techniques!\nIt's not just Meng Bi who thinks this way; every beastman who knows about the existence of the Beastman Three Techniques thinks this way.\nTo repay the favor His Highness Austin has shown to him, Meng Bi has set a small target: to master the use and skills of the Beastman Three Techniques proficiently within this year!\nHowever, what restricts his use of the Beastman Three Techniques is not just the intensity of his body, but also Fighting Qi.\nRegarding Fighting Qi, because Austin does not want to modify him at the expense of the benefits of the ancestral bloodline, the Fighting Qi within him mostly results from his own cultivation. There was no one-step Dragon Vein Transformation, so now the Fighting Qi within him is still very thin.\nJust relying on the cultivation breathing technique results in thin Fighting Qi in a short time, which cannot meet the basic requirements of the Beastman Three Techniques.\nIt's precisely because of this that, although he performed exceptionally well during the mercenary attack battle and awakened ancestral bloodline leading to his promotion into the Dragon Vein Attendant team, Meng Bi knows that his strength is far weaker than an average Dragon Vein Attendant.\n\"Ancestral bloodline cannot control freely yet. Fine, today I decide to do five thousand more push-ups and ten thousand squats...\"\nOn the open ground, the jackal wolf youth Meng Bi sweats like rain.\nThe Copper Ore Base holds a relatively important position within the Dragon Nest Tribe, as it is generally staffed with over ten extraordinary beastman elites for a long duration, and Meng Bi is one of them, having been stationed here half a month ago.\nHowever, compared to other extraordinary beastmen patroling the surroundings or cultivating the Beastman Three Techniques, Meng Bi has been diligently training, improving his physical condition, hoping to meet the most basic requirement of the Beastman Three Techniques.\nCurrently, the intensity of Meng Bi's training is at least twice that of ordinary extraordinary beastmen.\nIn fact, after activating the ancestral bloodline, Meng Bi's strength would see a leap of improvement. With strong physical prowess, the Beastman Three Techniques would be at his fingertips, but unfortunately, except in crisis situations, he cannot actively activate the ancestral bloodline, hence his dissatisfaction.\nStrong, become even stronger!\nOnly then can he repay His Highness Austin for his kindness and ensure his sister's safety!\nAs Meng Bi sweats like rain, striving to train himself, while the beastmen in the base come and go, making copper and iron weapons.\nBoom!!!\nA gigantic shadow, like a falling comet, descended from the sky and crashed onto the earth.\nThe earth shook violently, large swathes of soil were like being bombed by meteors, lifted like waves, creating a torrent whirlwind that blew fiercely, the air stream like a tsunami extending endlessly, sweeping to all directions.\n\"Who's your head! Get out here!!!\"\nA thunderous shout pierced the heavens and earth. Through the swirling dust, a strong wind swept over, tearing apart the haze to reveal a wildly arrogant, dominant figure.\nA lion-headed man with a ferocious scar on his face, his body adorned in golden shimmer!\nThe lion-headed man stood in the center of a massive circular crater, the ground around him shattered like glass, spiderweb-like cracks spreading out, standing there emitting an oppressive domineering aura which impaired the breathing of ordinary beastmen not far away.\n\"Who are you!\"\nThough somewhat panicked by the overwhelmingly domineering lion-headed man, the Dragon Nest Beastmen patrol team swiftly ran forward, surrounded him with sharp spears in hand, while the surrounding beastmen miners scrambled back to their rooms, donning armor and grabbing weapons.\n\"I am Golden Lion Shiji of the Blood Claw Tribe! Are you the leader of this garbage? Kneel before me!\"\nThe lion-headed man Golden Lion Shiji roared, stepping hard on the ground, emitting golden light from his body, soaring like a ferocious dragon into the sky, golden aura enveloping him as billowing vapor exploded upwards intimidating the heavens.\nBoom!!!\nAmidst a tremendous booming sound, vast expanses of land cracked as the terrifying aura swept all around.\nIn this Kawa Great Forest, a bigger fist is the truth.\nGolden Lion Shiji firmly believes that as long as he kills the leader of these beastmen, he can recruit all of them under his banner and obtain the method for this mass production of metal armor and weapons—this is the raw survival law within a beastman tribe.\n\"A bunch of garbage waste, though I don't know how you managed to off Grom, but your Golden Lion master here is not someone who cannot even break through Silver level waste, watch the fist!\"\nShiji spoke little, and he needed few words as this tribe seemed somewhat strange, but there were only about ten or so bronze-level extraordinary beastmen—the level of strength that could not resist he who had already achieved Gold-level Great Warrior!\nToday, this tribe is doomed to be destroyed!\nWith a punch thrown, winds and clouds stirred!\nAt that moment, the rolling aura surged forward, golden Fighting Qi condensed in the fist and erupted, billowing golden waves like overturning tsunamis, about to engulf all the Dragon Nest beastmen troops present...",

The foremost Beastmen were immediately blown away, crashing down loudly, leaving a gap in the Beastman military formation ahead.\n\"Be careful, Long Spear Array!\"\nAn Extraordinary Beastman roared, and dozens of Beastman soldiers gathered together, forming a tight forest of spears, surrounding Golden Lion Shiji in the center.\nAt the same time, several Beastman Captains sprang out, their internal Fighting Qi igniting, rushing toward Golden Lion Shiji like raging bears.\nBefore finding a suitable military formation for the Extraordinary Beastmen, Austin intended to reform the Beastman Legion similar to the leadership of the One Piece Navy, where Extraordinary Beastmen lead a group of ordinary Beastman subordinates, coordinating with each other to maximize their fighting power.\nThese elite Beastmen acting as officers engage the enemy, while their subordinates provide support and distraction.\nSix Extraordinary Beastmen charged out. Although their cultivation of Fighting Qi was short, Austin had also brought some scientific fitness training methods from his past life into this world. After rigorous training, each Extraordinary Beastman had significantly improved in strength.\nWith all six attacking simultaneously, their fierce momentum felt like a mountain crashing down, sweeping forward powerfully.\n\"Haha, a few scraps want to deal with your grandpa Shiji! Go to hell!\"\nFacing the combined assault of six Captain-level Extraordinary Beastmen, Golden Lion Shiji did not retreat but instead advanced, shouting loudly. His voice was like thunder, as if golden bolts clashing. Golden Fighting Qi swept out, like flames swirling around him.\n\"Die, die, die!\"\nShiji roared repeatedly, his fists stirring like a storm, generating a whistling wind that left a sky full of afterimages, breaking through the air with a faint rumble like rolling thunder.\nBam bam bam.....\nIn the continuous muffled sounds, the six elite Beastmen at the Captain level couldn't avoid the attack. They could only put their hands in front defensively, but were struck by the sky-filling shadows, sending their bodies flying backward like cannonballs, leaving long trails.\n\"Not good, attack!\"\nSeeing the captains defeated, the surrounding Beastman soldiers did not rush forward with long spears in hand. The densely packed spear forest shimmered coldly, and beneath this tight spear array, the Beastmen stepped uniformly, surging forward without any chaos. Golden Lion Shiji, surrounded in the middle, felt as if facing a spear forest tsunami, a sensation of having nowhere to escape.\n\"Good!\"\nSeeing these Beastman soldiers, Golden Lion Shiji couldn't help but be slightly impressed.\nIn the entire Kawa Great Forest, all the tribal Beastmen fought by charging en masse, following powerful leaders. Their ranks were chaotic, where had there ever been such formations?\nAfter years of battle, he had only encountered this feeling when facing elite human legions. This wild Beastman Tribe had such elite Beastman troops?\nIf he could subdue them under his command, wouldn't that greatly enhance the strength of his own forces!\n\"Get out of my way!\"\nHe admired them indeed, but to make them submit, the only means was to defeat them all!\nWith a roar, like a rageful thunder breaking open the sky, the king of beasts' aura swept over. Shiji stomped onto the ground, his golden Fighting Qi exploded, rolling outward like breaking brittle branches, flinging large swathes of soil into the air.\nWhoosh!\nThe air waves emptied with the sound of flowing water, Fighting Qi swept like a flood.\nLike raging waves, like torrents, like boiling magma surging and flowing, the first Beastman soldiers who charged forward were immediately blown away, crashing down in the distance, while the Beastman soldiers behind were also swaying in the storm of the flood.\nIn just a face-to-face encounter, whether the Captain-level Extraordinary Beastmen or the Beastman formation, they were all at a disadvantage.\nHowever, after so much bloody fighting and training, these Dragon Nest Beastmen forces were already unified with resolute will, showing no signs of defeat. As the comrades in front fell, those behind continued to surge forward without a trace of fear.\nMeanwhile, outside the militiamen and Beastman producers were all armed and swarming in. Due to the rapid expansion of the Dragon Nest Tribe, the entire tribe's population had greatly increased, and combined with the importance of the Copper Ore Base, there were currently over a thousand Dragon Nest Beastmen gathered.\nThough at this Copper Ore Base only about a hundred were regular Dragon Nest soldiers, most were militiamen and Beastman producers, anyone integrated into the Dragon Nest Tribe as prisoners had been well-trained before. Equipped with weapons and armor, although not comparable to the regular Dragon Nest Legion, they were far superior to other Beastman troops within the Kawa Forest.\nWith the delay from the Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers, the thousand Beastman militiamen and producers had now swarmed forward.\nExtraordinary Beastmen are not invincible, even at the Gold Level. Before reaching Legendary, the Fighting Qi they use comes from within. Once the Fighting Qi is exhausted, they're only a few times stronger than regular Beastmen physically.\nIf there are a thousand Beastman soldiers, even if Golden Lion Shiji slaughters them all head-on, he would grow weary of killing and likely exhaust his Fighting Qi under such a siege.\nIf it were an ordinary Beastman force, Shiji could down a few of the fiercest individuals with heavy attacks and easily rout them with his overpowering presence. Yet, after the earlier clash, how could he not realize the prowess of this unknown tribe?\n\"What are you guys standing there for? Get moving!\"\nGolden Lion Shiji kicked a few advancing Beastman soldiers flying, his Fighting Qi surging out, sweeping through, blasting over a dozen more away as the densely packed Beastman horde surged up again, making him furiously shout in frustration.\n\"Hahaha, Shiji, even you have a day like this!\"\n\"Being besieged by a bunch of little mice, what a disgrace!\"\nAlong with hearty laughter, over twenty Beastman Transcendents charged out from the mountain forest. They were the Blood Claw Tribe's team who had come alongside Shiji, rushing at the Dragon Nest Beastman army like wolves and tigers.\nWith the addition of fresh forces, the Dragon Nest Beastmen instantly fell into a disadvantage.Follow current novels on NoveIＦire.net\n\"Damn it!\"\nGolden Lion Shiji's face also turned unsightly. He underestimated these Beastman soldiers.\nIt seemed that fool Grom indeed perished at the hands of this strange tribe. The Beastman soldiers in front of him, most had developed Qi Sensitivity, half a step into the Extraordinary Gate, plus their tightly coordinated spear formation, and those formidable Extraordinary Beastman Captains; only Silver peak Grom couldn't possibly have withstood it.",

      "content": "This elite force, coupled with such fearless prowess, even he himself might be caught off guard and suffer a fate in a ditch under this tribe's relentless attack, not to mention that fool Grom.\nIn just a moment or two, Golden Lion Shiji contemplated many things.\nHowever, what he didn't know was that compared to a year ago, the strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe Beastmen had greatly improved.\nA year ago, before Austin led the Dragon Nest Tribe Clan to attack the Blood Claw Tribe Branch, the entire tribe population was merely around a thousand, primarily comprising middle and lower-tier Beastmen races, and the Extraordinary Beastmen within the tribe were also newly transformed, with their power still in its initial stages.\nBut now, after a year of development, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe's population has exceeded twenty thousand, allowing them to select more outstanding personnel and supplement them with more training.\nMoreover, after a year of development, Austin has introduced scientific training methods from his previous life into this world, promoting the Breathing Technique throughout the Legion, and created the Beastman Three Techniques from modifying the Navy Six Techniques. With these actions, the Dragon Nest Tribe Beastman Legion's strength has dramatically increased compared to the past.\nFurthermore, during the cold winter, the Dragon Nest Legion set out to hunt various types of Giant Beasts, which not only brought battle experience to the Beastman soldiers but also significantly enhanced their physiques with the Giant Beast meat.\nNow, any two or three ordinary Dragon Nest Beastman soldiers can even contend against the transformed Extraordinary Beastmen of a year ago. Such rapid improvement led Golden Lion Shiji to mistakenly believe that the Blood Claw Tribe Branch was wiped out by the \"tribe\" before him.\n\"Very well, let's cripple you first, then consider recruitment!\"\nGolden Lion Shiji wore a sinister smile as his Fighting Qi surged throughout his body, ready to burst into the beastman army for a massacre.\nJust then,\n\"Iron Block: Mountain Collapse!\"\nA silhouette suddenly flashed across the sky with the speed of lightning, appearing in front of him, bringing down a power akin to lifting a mountain and crushing a peak.\nBOOM!!!\nGolden Lion Shiji only managed to cross his arms above his head when the massive force erupted like a volcanic blast, akin to a thunderous roar, resonating through the sky with earth-shattering noise as the immense power exploded forth!\nGolden Lion Shiji felt as if an iron mountain had crashed down on him, and he was quickly embedded into the ground under the intense pressure, causing the surrounding soil to collapse from invisible pressure, with a massive surge akin to a tsunami sweeping outward, forcing the Dragon Nest Beastman soldiers nearby to retreat a few steps.\n\"Meng Bi?!!\"\nSeeing the Jackal Wolf Youth atop Golden Lion Shiji, the surrounding beastmen were all taken aback.\nAt this moment, the youth was nearly completely beastified, with blood-red pupils reflecting the Cross Beast Eyes, his hair bristling like steel cords stretching his skin, and his whole body burning with a red flame like a blood qi cauldron.\n\"Everyone, go help on the other side. I'll deal with this guy!\"\nMeng Bi's arms, forged like iron, pressed firmly onto Golden Lion Shiji, beneath whom the ground suddenly shattered like glass, with web-like cracks spreading outward.\n\"Good kid, it's actually an Ancestral Bloodline!\"Thɪs novelꞁire.net\nShiji stared intently at the Jackal Wolf Youth Meng Bi, but his face revealed a fierce smile.\nHis arms, originally crossed, withdrew his right hand instantly, and with fearsome power, he punched forth like a cannonball, shattering the air and landing on Meng Bi.\nBANG!\nWith a resounding thud, Meng Bi was sent flying, the ground crumbling like tofu, and the fine soil firing like bullets in all directions, as Meng Bi scraped out a deep trench on the ground.\nDust filled the air as their eyes met.\n\"Never thought I'd encounter a beastman with Ancestral Bloodline in a place like this... Very well, let me test your strength!\"\nGolden Lion Shiji clenched his fists, producing a popping sound akin to firecrackers, while he stared fiercely at Meng Bi opposite him.\nEyeing the towering over three-meter figure radiating constant terrifying aura, whose immense shadow seemed to block the sky before him, Meng Bi felt no fear, only a strong sense of battle filled his mind.\nAfter triggering the bloodline, Meng Bi's physique and Fighting Qi had increased over tenfold, controlling such a powerful body, Meng Bi felt extremely confident.\nThe Beastman Three Techniques, which he would not be able to utilize normally, were now effortlessly performed, akin to walking and running. In this state, filled with battle intent, Meng Bi even instinctively improved upon the Beastman Three Techniques with ease.\nEarlier, his Iron Block: Mountain Collapse was an extension and improvement of the Beastman Three Techniques; he first used Swift Step to instantly move above Golden Lion Shiji, then exerted technique in mid-air using Swift Step again, kicking the air to gain downward momentum, simultaneously using Iron Block to crash down with tremendous force.\nDuring this process, not only did Meng Bi instinctively use the Beastman Three Techniques seamlessly, he even utilized Swift Step as a foundation to demonstrate an air step that Austin had once theoretically discussed but hadn't attempted to complete.\n\"Swift Step!\"\nMeng Bi uttered few words, knowing his current condition was not ideal, as triggering Ancestral Bloodline comes at a cost; the acquisition of power comes with tremendous pain.\nThe sensation of magma flowing through the veins, scorching the muscles, meant he wasn't fit for a prolonged battle, and the longer the fight, the higher the likelihood of failure.\nBANG!!!\nThe ground below collapsed and caved, as Meng Bi's silhouette disappeared in an instant.\nEven with Golden Lion Shiji's keen observation, he could only see a streak of blood-red lightning surging towards him, and while still mid-air, the blood-red lightning swiftly spun.\nGale Wave·Swift Spin!\nWith his right foot as the pivot, Meng Bi spun rapidly like a drill, the blood-red light wave like crimson bands swirling, seeming to tear the air apart, along with fierce winds, drilling towards Golden Lion Shiji's head!\n\"Good timing!\"\nGolden Lion Shiji roared, his huge palms churning Fighting Qi, as if cast in gold, unleashed with more speed and fierceness, slapping the air like rumbling thunder, bearing the might to smash mountains and crush rocks, striking towards Meng Bi.",

The clash sounded like striking metal, sending visible ripples sweeping outwards in all directions like ocean waves.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nUnder the immense force, the ground beneath Golden Lion Shiji's feet shattered extensively, rapidly spreading in all directions as powerful energy swept through, causing surrounding Beastmen soldiers to retreat.\n\"Heh, kid, you're still far off!\"\nShiji grinned, a menacing smile appearing on his face.\nHis massive palms, like iron plates, had sharp claws extending from deep within his fingertips. The golden fighting qi rising around him surged violently through his palms, collapsing layers of airflow in an instant, forming a gale, as surrounding air rapidly converged, creating a massive vortex in the sky.\nBoom!!!\nFighting qi like a vast sea swept across the sky, moving hundreds of meters within its radius, turning into a towering pillar of fighting qi, spiraling upward and forming a sky-reaching tornado!\nMeng Bi was in mid-air, caught by the flow of fighting qi, and like a leaf in a storm, he helplessly swept up in the torrent of fighting qi.\n\"Aerial Step·Continuous Kick!\"\nBlown tens of meters into the air, Meng Bi kicked the air multiple times consecutively, his body bouncing in mid-air, soon disappearing with a whoosh, breaking through the tornado torrent and abruptly appearing in the high skies beside it with a crimson glow.\n\"Gale Wave·Sword Rain!\"\nStill in mid-air, Meng Bi took a deep breath, his feet kicking dozens of times in an instant, creating a series of crimson afterimages.\nEach kick sliced through the air, forming consecutive vacuum slashing waves, merging with the fighting qi, turning into a blood-red barrage of swords raining down!\nWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!!!\nCrimson gales bloomed in the sky like fireworks, then, like bullets shot from a machine gun, pierced the air with incredible speed and power, crashing down rapidly.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ novel★fire.net\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\nIn the continuous rumbling, an area centered around Golden Lion Shiji was bombarded by the crimson slashing waves within a hundred-meter radius. Massive chunks of soil were blasted away, then shredded into fragments mid-air, with stones shooting out like bullets as smoke and dust soared, covering half of the sky.\nIn such an intense battle, the Beastmen around retreated further and further, watching the scene in awe.\n\"That boy Meng Bi can actually reach such a level!\"\nAmong those present, the only Elite Dragon Vein Attendant watching the scene showed an expression of disbelief on his face.\nAs the Dragon Nest Tribe expanded, Austin allocated dozens of slots for Beastman modifications, raising the number of Extraordinary Beastmen in the Dragon Nest Tribe to about a hundred.\nAmong these hundred Extraordinary Beastmen, strengths varied, and the most elite were the twenty selected from all Extraordinary Beastmen for the Beastman Six Techniques development.\nBeing capable of undertaking the magic-modified development of the Navy Six Techniques meant their physical capabilities were top-notch within the Dragon Nest Tribe. After completing the Beastman Three Techniques modification, each Dragon Vein Attendant's strength advanced further, thus becoming the elite of the elite, known as Elite Dragon Vein Attendants.\nThe entire Copper Ore Base was stationed by an elite Dragon Vein Attendant named Pedra as the highest-ranking officer, overseeing the base's security defense.\nEven as one of the top twenty experimental group members, Pedra was currently only familiar with using Iron Block and Gale Wave, just getting started with Aerial Step.\nAnd now, this young fellow named Meng Bi not only mastered the Beastman Three Techniques but also integrated them and extended them into other combat techniques?!\n\"Remarkable! Moreover, the Beastman Three Techniques could be extended in such a manner with such immense power!\"\nSeeing Meng Bi achieve such a state after activating his Ancestral Bloodline, Pedra gasped in awe, his admiration for the great His Highness Austin deepening.\nHowever, amidst his amazement, Pedra also felt a vague sense of unease. Judging by the current battle, Meng Bi indeed seemed to have the upper hand, yet Pedra somehow perceived the scales of victory tipping towards the enemy.\nPedra frowned, wondering why he felt like Meng Bi was about to lose.\nHuff, huff, huff....\nAt this moment, Meng Bi was suspended in mid-air, having kicked out dozens or perhaps hundreds of crimson slashing waves, beads of sweat on his forehead, breathing heavily. The explosive pain within was nearing its limit, leaving him utterly exhausted, at his last breath.\n\"Huff, huff... did I win?\"\nStaring intently at the smokey area within a hundred-meter radius below, with the blood-colored flames wrapping around him about to burn out like firewood, the once fiercely burning flame seemed to be reaching its limit, about to extinguish, with his vision blurring and his swaying body about to fall.\nBy now, Meng Bi had reached his limit; activating the Ancestral Bloodline granted him over tenfold strength, and a body governed by a killing instinct, but at a cost of more than tenfold the consumption and a violent pain like magma flowing through his veins.\n\"I should have won...\"\nThe previous move, kicking out hundreds or thousands of slashing light waves, was the strongest attack Meng Bi could currently muster, capable of obliterating even a Silver Level Extraordinary to dust under such intense bombardment.\nHowever, just as Meng Bi's tense muscles were about to relax,\nBoom!!!\nWith a tremendous roar, the vast smoke was instantly torn apart by a powerful invisible impact, revealing a gigantic crater on the ground within a hundred-meter span. With the terrifying impact, pieces of fractured stones and soil suddenly floated into the air as if losing gravity.\nNo one present had time to think, not even Meng Bi, before a sharp, piercing whistle instantly shattered the scene before him. A shadow shot out like a cannonball, tearing through the air with a screeching sonic boom, swiftly drawing a long dragon-like trail of air in the sky.\n\"Hahaha! Kid, that was a pretty good combat technique, but your skill is lacking!\"\nThe air wave streaked across the sky like a sword, the ground upheaving along its path before Meng Bi could react. The golden-furred Shiji, stained with blood, appeared in front of him, crashing down with mountain-crushing force!",

      "content": "Boom!\nAn enormous sound akin to muffled thunder echoed, as if the air itself had been shattered. A terrifying power crashed onto Meng Bi, sending his entire body flying like a cannonball for hundreds of meters, flinging him out of the battlefield.\nBoom boom boom!\nOne giant tree after another crumbled, the ground collapsed, and clouds of dust rose up.\nAt this moment, Golden Lion Shiji wasn't in much better shape, his entire body covered in wounds, as if he's been flayed alive, soaked in blood.\nHowever, these injuries looked terrifying but were merely flesh wounds; they didn't even cut through the skin deeply enough to harm the muscles underneath.\nAfter Meng Bi's powers returned to their ancestral state, he grew more than ten times stronger. His primal instincts in this state perfectly executed the Beastman Three Techniques, extending into various remarkably damaging combat techniques.\nUnfortunately, his foundation was lacking.\nDue to this weak foundation, even with a tenfold increase, the Beastman Three Techniques still couldn't be considered truly powerful. Perhaps the destructive force of Gale Wave was sufficient for Silver-level Extraordinaries, but Golden Lion Shiji was a genuine Gold-level Beastman Great Warrior.\nAs Meng Bi's kicks unleashed a sky full of Gale Waves, Golden Lion Shiji's vast golden Fighting Qi surged forth. Though unskilled in defensive combat techniques, he continuously expelled Fighting Qi from within, and merely this emitted aura was enough to fend off the sword rain filling the sky.\n\"To achieve this level at quasi-Silver, you should be proud, but today you must die!\"\nEndless killing intent filled Golden Lion Shiji's eyes, his face twisted with fury as he looked in Meng Bi's direction, his eyes fiery red, blood-like. To be beaten to such a state by a mere kid—though not greatly harmed—this disgraceful situation would be his greatest joke!\nThis kid must pay the price!\n\"Kid, I will make you die!\"\nShiji crossed hundreds of meters in an instant, surging forward.\nThe dust was suddenly blasted away, revealing Meng Bi lying limp in the crater, arms broken, blood trickling from his mouth.\nToo fast!\nIn an instant, the situation was reversed, even Petra had no time to react, as Shiji descended like a golden meteor to the ground, relying on the last sliver of consciousness, Meng Bi endured the pain of broken bones all over, and managed to flip over.\nRumble!!!\nCovered in blood and like a meteor striking the earth, Shiji shattered large sections of soil, sending fragments flying skywards with the airstream, taking Meng Bi's severely injured body with it, tossing and rolling on the ground in dizziness.\nIf Meng Bi hadn't turned over at the last moment using that faint awareness, he might have been squashed like a cockroach on the spot.\nBut no time to celebrate; Shiji was relentless, determined to take the life of this young Jackal Wolf Person.\n\"Die!!!\n\"Sharp claws tore through the air, emitting shrill screeches, as they descended swiftly toward the head of the prone Meng Bi.\nA terrifying killing aura coalesced on the sharp nails, the gleaming red fighting qi emanating from them like a frigid glow. Even a hard stone would be smashed like tofu under such force.\nThe elite Extraordinary Beastmen around were unable to rescue, and Meng Bi had exhausted all his strength, seemingly about to perish under Golden Lion Shiji.\nAt this critical juncture,\nBoom!!!\nGolden Lion Shiji felt a sudden lightning strike in his mind, slamming violently, stirring waves of shock.\nAt that moment, Shiji felt as if he were plunging into a chasm of despair, a terrifying sensation of impending descent into the Nine Netherworld Hell.\nA frigid cold, chilling to the bone, enveloped Shiji in an instant, making him feel like a splash of cold water in the depths of winter, icy to the core.\n\"Who is there!\"\nBefore anyone could react, Golden Lion Shiji sprang back and swiftly swerved his body to the right.\nThe sensation in that instant saved his life!\nRumble!!!\nA true transformation descended, a pillar of dazzling blue light erupted from the horizon, its brilliance blanketing the sky, dimming the entire heavens and earth.\nIn one millionth of a second, the column seemed to pierce through the void, bringing rolling thunder from above, its terrifying power plummeting toward Shiji!\nBoom boom boom!\nAnything in the path of the blue light column—be it trees or rocks—was pierced in an instant, finally crashing like a meteor onto the forest land thousands of meters away, exploding with dreadful energy, forming a mushroom cloud. A visible shockwave swept like a tsunami, engulfing everything, toppling swathes of trees.Read complete version only at novel•fire.net\nGolden Lion Shiji quickly leapt back, clutching his right shoulder with his left hand, horrified at the distant sky.\nThe sixth sense in that moment allowed Shiji to dodge a fatal blow from the light pillar. However, his shoulder was pierced by the terrifying blue light column, leaving a bowl-sized hole, blood flowing freely.\nAll Beastmen halted their actions, gazing toward the horizon.\nRumbling thunder roared across heaven and earth, and then a rolling cloud swept in from the sky, covering the sky as if it were toppling mountains and overturning seas, instantly shrouding the entire region, plunging everything into a darkened world, as if excluded from all existence.\nClouds heavy as mountains loomed overhead, seemingly within arm's reach. Everyone present felt a pressure radiating from the Blood Claw Tribe's elite Beastmen, feeling uneasy.\nWhoosh!\nA great gale howled, sending sand and stones flying between heaven and earth, amidst flashing lightning illuminating the sky, a massive shadow descended from high above, spreading an overwhelming dragon's wrath.\n\"Intruders, you are courting death!\"\nStaring down at the Copper Ore Base he'd painstakingly built, now battered in this battle with barely a fraction remaining, Austin felt an inferno of rage.\nHis most valued logistics base was destroyed to such extent, and the troops he had trained with great effort were severely crippled, losing thirty to forty percent in this encounter. Had he arrived any later, the entire base might have been utterly broken.\nEspecially when zombies appeared, at a time when Copper Armor and Spear were desperately needed, this incident was simply a death wish!",

      "content": "Austin was furious. Not long ago, when he went to the western lands to investigate the source of the anomaly, he was almost killed by the pyramid built by those zombies, making him no longer dare to approach the core areas like the pyramid closely and could only observe from a distance.\nHowever, the more he probed, the more things he discovered that shocked Austin's heart and spirit. After spending several days, he couldn't even explore the extent of the anomalous land,\nThe vast area eroded by the strange green mist was simply too large. One could even say that the land to the west of the Dragon Nest Tribe had completely turned into a wasteland of apocalypse, a zone rampant with zombies, spreading outwards like a virus.\nDespite experiments, Austin discovered that the zombie virus-like eerie power couldn't spread through the air. While it could spread through water flow, it was confined to surviving a period on the polluted, eroded wasteland before gradually zombifying. Living creatures outside the eroded wasteland would only be infected if bitten and injured by those zombie animals or beastmen.\nBut Austin also discovered that the eroded wasteland was gradually spreading outward!\nOr rather, as the zombie creatures continued to move outward, the land was continually being eroded, gradually losing its vitality, turning into a wasteland of rampant decay.\nIt was certain that to resist the spread of the infected wasteland, one could only keep the zombified creatures outside, blocking their path, or completely annihilate all zombie creatures.\nAlthough it's unknown exactly what the pyramid built by the zombies was or what was capable of such terrifying attacks, it was impossible for Austin to simply do nothing and move the entire Dragon Nest Tribe to escape.\nAt least the day he discovered the pyramid, Austin's body was already flying high in the air, several hundred miles into the wasteland region, where he found those things. For the Dragon Nest Tribe far away, such terrifying things weren't a threat for the moment.\nDespite the grim prospects, Austin still decided to launch the Dragon Nest Beastmen to resist a few waves of attacks to test the situation.\nThe zombified creatures weren't frightening. At least from Austin's viewpoint, if a team equipped with neat Copper Armor and Spear in a Long Spear Array faced three to four times more zombified creatures of equal quality directly, they could still be victorious.\nAfter zombification, a creature's strength indeed increased significantly, but they also lost the crucial intelligence. Austin's Dragon Nest Legion was not comparable to ordinary beastmen teams. After rigorous training, the tight-knit Dragon Nest Beastmen Long Spear Array was enough to render the opponent helpless. The foolishly charging zombie creatures ended only in easily being slaughtered.\nAustin's Dragon Nest Legion wasn't like other tribes' beastman warriors. The scattered beastman zombies had no advantage other than sheer numbers against the Dragon Nest Legion. These Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers, formed through tough training, were also Austin's greatest confidence.\nTo strengthen preparations, Austin decided to start a large expansion once again, deciding to promote all beastman militia of the Dragon Nest Tribe to formal soldiers.\nWith many troops joining, the primary problem to solve was weaponry and armor.\nTo obtain more weapons and increase the Dragon Nest Tribe's weapon production, Austin directly flew to the Copper Ore Base, intending to learn the situation at the Copper Mine Base.\nThis was why Austin made this journey to the Copper Mine Base.This update is available on novel·fire.net\nHowever, what he didn't expect was that just halfway there, he sensed the intense aftermath of a Fighting Qi explosion in the distance.\nFrom high in the sky, Austin saw the battle within the Copper Mine Base, looking like tiny soybeans several kilometers away. The battle's aftermath not only destroyed most of the earthen blast furnaces in the Copper Mine Base but also continuously injured beastman soldiers. A young Jackal Wolf person with Ancestral Bloodline, whom he once cared about, was now teetering under the fierce attack of the enemy, about to fall to his death.\nIn such a situation, Austin couldn't endure any longer and immediately launched a modified version of the Thunder Roar Cannon, which shot out fiercely, traversing miles of the sky, instantly piercing a hole in the shoulder of the over three-meter-tall golden lion beastman.\nThanks to the magic-modified development of the Navy Six Techniques, Austin began pondering changes to his attack methods during his free time. Using the \"Chidori\" from \"Naruto\" as a blueprint, he relied on his natural control over Thunder to gather powerful Thunder Power in his mouth, condensing it extremely to form a laser beam the size of a bowl, instantly shooting out. Even over a distance of several miles, it still held terrifying power.\nIf it weren't for the golden lion beastman's natural, keen Sixth Sense saving him, his head would have been blown to pieces by now.\nBoom!!!\nUnder the heavy mountain-like dark clouds, a gigantic Blue Dragon descended from the sky, thunder and lightning flickering all around, its blinding radiance tearing through the sky, as if bringing judgment to the world.\nGolden Lion Shiji held his shoulder and looked up at the sky viciously. Ancient and solemn pressure descended with the gusty airflow, sweeping across heaven and earth, making it feel like a mountain was pressing down on his entire shoulder.\n\"Dragon! A dragon!\"\nCurrently, Austin hadn't crossed the threshold of the quasi-Golden boundary, so his cultivation tier was somewhat inferior to Golden Lion Shiji's.\nHowever, Austin belonged to the Giant Dragon Species, inherently standing atop with his top-level Legendary Bloodline!\nTwo years ago, when he was weak, Austin barely survived by relying on ordinary prey, even gnawing on dirt and eating bark to grow. Due to only absorbing magic power from the air and not devouring enough magic resources as a young dragon, his growth was far behind an average young dragon, and his strength was extremely poor. He only awakened a useless Talent Magic of Electric Shock Paralysis, incapable of dealing with even a first or second-tier pack of magic beast Blood Wolves, considered a failure among young dragons.\nBut during this period, Austin never abandoned using Electric Shock Paralysis to stimulate and train his body. After starting to manage the Clan Tribe, with the Dragon Nest Tribe's growth, it began with an incomplete magic beast Crystal Core of a Ghost-headed Crocodile leader, then a Blood Wolf leader, and then the magic crystal inside the Spider Cave.\nLater, as the Dragon Nest Tribe became extremely powerful, he ventured out to continuously hunt giant beasts and slaughtered wandering magic beasts to obtain magic beast Crystal Cores, also gathering magic-power-infused plants and fruits back. With unlimited magic resources, Austin's tier quickly rose from Bronze Level to the current quasi-Gold level.",

      "content": "Compared to other young dragons that can only reach certain tiers and realms during their twenties or thirties, Austin's growth speed is undeniably fast.\nWith personal growth and broadened horizons from various experiences, Austin has developed some conjectures after acquiring sufficient Magic Power resources that allow him to advance rapidly.\nFirstly, lightning has an excellent stimulating effect on Magic Power, and Austin accelerated his physical growth through continuous electric body tempering. Subsequently, after absorbing enough Magic Power resources, he can grow quickly.\nSecondly, Austin is not a native Blue Dragon but a Transmigrator, his soul is several times stronger than an ordinary young dragon.\nPerhaps during the growth of the Giant Dragons, some discovered that electricity could stimulate the growth of a young dragon's body and level.\nHowever, young dragons need a lot of time to sleep during their growth period, mainly because their souls struggle to mature.\nThe Giant Dragon Race has enviable longevity and powerful noble bloodlines, but while they are biologically strong, they naturally have flaws — the young dragon's soul requires a lot of time to gradually grow.\nIf trained with lightning during the young dragon stage to promote body development, the immature soul could become burdened by the powerful body, turning the dragon into an idiot dragon, losing out in the end. Perhaps that's why the Dragon Race's inheritance doesn't mention electrical stimulation aiding growth.\nBut Austin is different. Due to his transmigrated soul, it is naturally several times, even ten times stronger than other newly-born hatchlings. As it gradually merges with his body, it grows rapidly without the worry of the soul failing to keep up with the body's growth, causing soul collapse.\nThis conjecture is not without reason. It is a presumption Austin made based on his own growth. Compared with other hatchlings, he indeed needs very little sleep time, and he can clearly perceive the external situation.\nAlthough powerful upon reaching adulthood, Giant Dragons are very weak during their youth.\nThis is precisely why, two years ago during his initial stage, Austin couldn't even fend off a wolf pack, but after rapid growth, he could challenge higher tiers.\nDue to a weak body, many powers of the Giant Dragons are sealed during the juvenile stage. As the tier increases, the various powerful abilities in the dragon's bloodline begin to manifest gradually.\nFirst, Dragon Might gradually forms, then control over the thunder and lightning roaming the sky and earth, sensing the water vapor in the atmosphere, and even commanding storms and clouds.\nAll this is the result of Austin's awakening of powers as a Blue Dragon as his tier elevates!Read complete version only at nοvelfire.net\nBlue Dragon, the Sky Sovereign, a terrifying existence wielding thunder and storms.\nNow, Austin is continuously awakening the Legendary Bloodline as a Blue Dragon, revealing various intrinsic powers hidden deep within him!\nCreatures like Giant Dragons have an overwhelming suppression effect on beings below Legendary. Even though Golden Lion Shiji is a Gold Tier Beastman Great Warrior, Austin's overwhelming aura is above his!\nIt is precisely because of this that Golden Lion Shiji looked at Austin in the sky with extreme seriousness, feeling an intimidating suppression from head to toe.\nCombat power beneath Legendary is not measured by level. For instance, the Jackal Wolf People youth Meng Bi, who enters the Ancestral Bloodline state, can barely reach the quasi-Silver Level.\nHowever, Meng Bi learned the Beastman Three Techniques, extending and modifying them through instinct, enabling him to counter even high Silver-level opponents.\nYet Austin, being a Giant Dragon Species, continuously activates the powers hidden in the dragon's bloodline, imposing a more terrifying suppression on Golden Lion Shiji than what Meng Bi achieves through combat techniques to enhance prowess!\nProficient in controlling thunder and lightning, and combining knowledge related to electricity from his past life for personal use, Austin has created various thunder and lightning combat techniques of his own. Even with Golden Lion Shiji at peak condition, Austin could crush him effortlessly, not to mention now that Shiji has been severely wounded, with only half of his strength remaining.\n\"So, this is the Clan Tribe you've established! It was a dragon after all, no wonder not a single Beastman could return from the destruction of a subdivision...\"\nAt this moment, a realization dawned on Golden Lion Shiji. When facing this tribe, he felt something was amiss. With the elite Beastman soldiers of this tribe, plus several Beastman Transcendents, it should've been enough to besiege Grom, yet the entire subdivision's annihilation without even one Beastman escaping seemed implausible. But adding this dragon into the equation, everything makes sense.\n\"The one who destroyed the Blood Claw subdivision was you, this dragon!\"\nGolden Lion Shiji's voice was categorical, pointing at Austin with his only intact left hand.\n\"Blood Claw Tribe, so you are with them.\"\nHigh above, amid raging winds and a storm of sand and stones, Austin hovered, casting a massive shadow, his majestic voice resounding across the land.\n\"Since you're here for revenge, I'll send you to the Divine Kingdom to meet them!\"\nAs the words fell, Austin flapped his massive wings, causing a visible torrent to rise like an upheaving tsunami.\nAbove the cloud-covered skies, myriad thunders erupted from the heavens, torrents of electrical serpents tearing through the sky, descending in thousands of meters of blinding blue light, illuminating the entire sky.\nThe whole firmament was covered with lightning.\nThe explosive thunder, however, under Austin's heart spirit sensing, obediently gathered before him, becoming a vast sea of electrical light.\nSizzling.....\nThousands of shrill bird cries accompanied the scene, electric light engulfing the sky, embodying a terrifying divine wrath, making the Beastmen on Blood Claw Tribe's side feel chills down their backs, with cold sweat streaming down, and Golden Lion Shiji felt an ominous sense of impending doom.\nUnbeknownst, the Dragon Nest Beastmen and Blood Claw Tribe separated, each on a different side, leaving Austin with no further worries.\nBOOM!!!\nThe enormous membrane wings flapped, bringing the heavenly sea of lightning crashing like a meteor, illuminating half the sky.\nEven while still mid-air, as Austin willed authority, the sea of lightning gathered and spread over his enormous claws, forming a celestial Thunderclaw that seemed to shatter the sky, crashing down towards the Blood Claw Tribe people.\n\"Your Highness, Blue Dragon, wait, we didn't come for revenge! We have important matters to discuss!\"\nUnder the world-ending momentum, they felt plunged into an abyss of despair in an instant, as a voice shouted in panic during the critical moment.\nBut before the words fully left their mouth, the dreadful sky-spanning thunder clapped down.\nBOOM!!!\nA blinding white light, covering the sky, erupted magnificently!",

As they grow, the Legendary Law sealed within their Bloodline gradually becomes unsealed, naturally entering the Legendary Realm.\nIt can be said, from birth, the Dragon Race has embarked on the path to Legendary.Google seaʀᴄh novelFɪre.net\nFrom the moment a dragon whelp is born, its growth is the process of the Legendary Law continuously coalescing into form, eventually crossing into that realm.\nThough Austin's current tier is only a quasi-Gold level, as a Giant Dragon Species, he has already awakened part of the power to control thunder and storm, he can command the wind and thunder, which is the result of those Legendary Laws rooted in his Bloodline gradually reviving.\nWith these powers of Legendary level, even though Golden Lion Shiji is a true Gold-level Beastman Great Warrior, in front of Austin, there is absolutely no room for resistance; both his aura and battle strength are comprehensively suppressed.\nIn the gloomy heavens and earth, hundreds and thousands of bolts of lightning tear through the sky, striking down with Austin's paw, shooting upward into the sky.\nRumble!!!\nAs the terrifying thunder claw crashes down, a horrific explosion erupts suddenly, like a volcano suppressed for hundreds of years suddenly erupting, visible torrents and tsunamis rise to the sky, rushing straight to the horizon, obscuring half the sky.\nAmidst the rolling smoke and dust, the enormous lightning splits open, arcs of light flare in the smoke like unbreakable laser gale waves, along its path, large swathes of soil crumble, fragmenting into gullies, and then exploding like a storm.\nBang bang bang!\nOverwhelming explosions suddenly erupt.\nThe suppression of Bloodline, the suppression of Law, coupled with the power of heaven and earth, the Blood Claw Tribe's Beastmen present had no resistance, only managing to plead for mercy, immediately swept into this terrifying attack, like clothes tossed in a washing machine, tumbling and rolling in the explosive torrent.\nUntil the thunder in the arena dissipates, a dozen scorched figures with only a single breath remaining fell from the sky, unable to rise again.\n\"Cough cough...\"\nGolden Lion Shiji struggles to stand but stumbles and falls to the ground, spewing a mouthful of blood, only able to pantingly lie on the ground, drained of strength.\nAt this time, the original golden fur of Golden Lion Shiji had completely disappeared, the charred fur making him look like a piece of charcoal, wisps of white smoke rising from his body.\nIf he were in his prime, sacrificing his life for the strongest attack, Golden Lion Shiji's battle strength would suffice to severely wound Austin.\nBut he was first exhausted by Meng Bi who erupted with Ancestral Bloodline, then Austin shot him from afar with an improved Thunder Roar Cannon, crippling his shoulder, rendering his full strength only capable of exerting forty to fifty percent.\nAfterwards, as Austin commanded the wind and thunder with the Blue Dragon Bloodline, gathering the strongest thunder attack currently usable, Golden Lion Shiji was left utterly powerless.\n\"Blood Claw Tribe's Beastmen, give me a reason not to kill you.\"\nFrom the sky, Austin descends on a gale, causing the surrounding earth to rustle and resound.\nThe massive shadow falls, covering their entire bodies, Austin's ancient and solemn voice echoes in every Beastman's ears, filled with composure and majesty, striking directly at their hearts.\nLooking at these charcoal-like lying figures on the ground, barely alive, claiming to be from the Blood Claw Tribe, Austin's face shows no change, his gaze full of scrutiny.\nIn an instant during the prior attack, Austin slightly shifted the thunder giant claw, leaving these Blood Claw Tribe Beastmen alive, hence they were barely left with a breath.\nAnd just at that previous moment, a Blood Claw Tribe Beastman's shout suddenly made Austin think of something.\nWhen discovering the Blood Claw Tribe's branch before, various signs had already indicated something was amiss. The Blood Claw Tribe is a renowned super-large tribe near the Bloody Border at the fringe of the Kawa Great Forest, why would they fully support, establish a branch located in such a remote place?\nClearly, the resources nearby aren't very rich, and maintaining a tribe of over a thousand in scale would necessitate substantial material support from the headquarters, why undertake such a thankless effort?\nPerhaps, these Beastmen in front of him could provide him an answer.",

      "content": "The Blood Claw Tribe Branch established in this nearby location has always had numerous suspicions surrounding it.\nAlthough this place is relatively remote, with no supernatural areas around for hundreds of kilometers, perhaps the lake reservoir that seems like a meteor crater beside Dragon Nest counts as one, but it's obvious that the Blood Claw Tribe didn't expend great effort to establish a branch here for this reason.\nConsidering the combined distance of several hundred kilometers and the primitive survival methods of the original Beastman Tribe, under normal circumstances, it would take at least one to two years for the Blood Claw Tribe to possibly react and send people to investigate.\nBut now, within less than half a year, the Blood Claw Tribe's Beastmen have already arrived here to investigate the situation, showing how much emphasis the Blood Claw Tribe places on this branch.\nSuch emphasis is clearly unusual.\nThe only possibility can only be that the Blood Claw Tribe has other extraordinary plans in establishing a branch here.\nThe purpose of the Blood Claw Tribe's plan, the previous branch's leader, Grom the Grizzly, might know a thing or two, but in that battle, he was blasted to oblivion by Austin, leaving no trace behind. The rest of the Dark Elves like Adinlek and other Extraordinary Beastmen don't know much either. They were only told to follow Grom the Grizzly, heading southeast to find a place to establish a base.\nWhy does the Blood Claw Tribe want to establish such a base? Austin doesn't know, but combining the previously discovered continuously infecting wasteland and those zombies, along with the recent movements of those large tribes near the Bloody Border, Austin has vague suspicions.\nLeaving them alive is to determine if these suspicions are correct and to learn more.\n\"Cough cough... Esteemed His Highness Blue Dragon... We came here not only to investigate the division's destruction but most importantly to probe the movements of the evil spirits...\"\nA Silver-level Blood Claw Beastman struggled to stand and respectfully spoke towards Austin.\n\"Evil spirits? What are they?\"For original chapters go to novel·fiɾe·net\n...\nSeveral days later,\nThe Copper Mine Base that was previously destroyed by battle had undergone some simple repairs, the broken blast furnace being rebuilt anew, and the Goblins had made certain modifications to the earth furnaces based on previous experience. However, the newly mixed clay hadn't dried yet, to prevent cracks from appearing, they could only wait for the furnace to naturally dry before continuing copper refining work.\nEven though copper refining couldn't proceed due to the furnace issue, the Beastmen didn't sit idle.\nA large number of Beastmen excavated chunk after chunk of copper ore from the mountain and transported them to the copper refining site where the furnace stood tall. Meanwhile, massive trees were felled and burned into charcoal in the furnace, piled high like a mountain and placed on the open space of the square.\nThe circulating Beastmen were all well-organized, everything orderly and steady, waiting only for the furnace to dry before throwing themselves into copper refining work.\nIf not for the gigantic claw marks deeply embedded in the ground, with web-like cracks spreading from the shattered earth and the overturned massive clods of soil left uncovered, these terrifying battle scars yet to be concealed, one might have thought this tranquil Copper Mine Base had never suffered an attack at all.\nThe injured from that assault battle had basically been escorted back to Dragon Nest Tribe's residence for treatment, and the captives were also locked with heavy copper chains and shackles and taken away.\nThough the whole tribe seemed peaceful, the power spread from the battle—the Beastman Three Techniques, the ancestral bloodline power of Meng Bi, the formidable strength of His Highness Austin—was widely discussed throughout the tribe.\nThe most obvious manifestation being that some of the young Beastmen categorized as militia began training hard in their spare time, hoping one day to showcase such demeanor before everyone and earn the qualification to join the Dragon Nest Legion to cultivate the Beastman Three Techniques.\nThe impact from the Blood Claw Beastman's assault continues to spread within the Dragon Nest Tribe, reaping admiration and belief from many of the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nOnly, at this moment, Austin, residing in the Dragon Nest, found himself in a troubling dilemma.\nThe trouble bothering him was the news brought by the Blood Claw Beastmen, a revelation that shook his confidence!\nWithout exceeding Austin's expectations, indeed, the Blood Claw Tribe's plans were related to those zombies in the west.\nNo, or it could be said that the Blood Claw Tribe expended vast resources to establish the branch here primarily for those zombies and the spreading wasteland!\nAnd all of this traces back to the start with the evil spirits.\nAccording to the Blood Claw Beastmen, the appearance of zombies is connected to the evil spirits.\nEvil spirits are entities that harvest faith through panic and eeriness, and when accepting faith, they become tainted with boundless wicked thoughts forming into malevolent spirit bodies.\nInitially, spirit bodies can harvest faith similarly to divine entities, surviving and gaining power from faith, yet they lack divine essence, unable to become divine. During this period, they're highly susceptible to wicked thought infection, descending into thorough evil spirits.\nEvil spirits coerced intelligent creatures to worship and sacrifice with faith in fear, harvesting faith by using panic as a weapon, accumulating their ethereal form with fearful faith, becoming nightmares for intelligent creatures. They then spread more fear to gain additional faith, utilizing the terror and struggle within souls to gain stronger sources of power.\nAnd some evil spirits rely on blood sacrifices, feasting on living flesh, acquiring more powerful strength through sacrificing the living flesh of intelligent life forms.\nYet no matter the type of evil spirit, these inherently wicked beings are almost universally hated across the entire continent.\nHowever, as long as there is demand, the soil for their survival exists.\nDespite those who believe in evil spirits ultimately being harmed by them, in places like Kawa Great Forest, to survive and gain greater strength, some Beastman Tribes do worship evil spirits, obtaining more food by relying on evil spirits, growing stronger and ultimately becoming the very thing the evil spirits consume.\nThere are various kinds of evil spirits, among them, the existence of mutated evil spirits.\nAnd this time, the source of the wasteland that appeared on the western lands and the numerous rotting infected zombies stemmed from a mutated evil spirit that surfaced years ago in an obscure corner.\nNo one knows when the mutated evil spirit suddenly appeared within a tribe inside Kawa Great Forest, resurrecting dead bodies through unknown means, absorbing vast amounts of fanatic faith, causing the entire tribe to fall, leaving no more circulating news.\nFamiliarly neighboring tribes went visiting...\nThe result was beginning to spread swiftly like a plague,\nLaunching a sweep across the southernmost lands of Kawa Great Forest, continually spreading far and wide towards all directions of the forest, sweeping progressively far.",

      "content": "The mutated evil spirit's power spread throughout the Kawa Great Forest like a plague virus, and all the Beastman Tribes and even the living creatures caught up in it turned into living corpses, completely reduced to puppet slaves.\nAt the same time, wherever the living corpses swept through, the land also became contaminated and spread, turning into a rotten wasteland.\nLarge expanses of forest meadows vanished, and the surviving vegetation seemed to have been cursed in the most dreadful way, becoming hideous and twisted, as if haunted by ghosts trapped within. At nightfall, it became a dead land of the underworld upon their arrival.\nBy the time the major Beastman Tribes reacted, the unknown mutated evil spirit had already grown to a significant scale.\nConflicts naturally ensued. To suppress the evil spirit's expansion, several major Beastman Tribes united for multiple purges, but the result was constant defeat. The fallen comrades on the battlefield quickly became enemies.\nAfter several major defeats, under immense pressure, the major Beastman Tribes began to unite, forming a Tribe Alliance, preparing to break through the defenses of the Bloody Border and enter the Human World to escape the disaster brought by the mutated evil spirit.\nAt the same time, when attacking the Bloody Border, to prevent the evil spirit's army from striking from behind, the Beastman Alliance decided to establish Beastman strongholds in various directions, hoping to delay and resist the evil spirit's army while serving as a warning line to probe the range of the evil spirit army's spread.\nThe Blood Claw Tribe Branch was one of those numerous outposts.\nEach of the Beastman Alliance's outposts received substantial support from the tribes, with supplies of food and goods continuously pouring in. After establishing the outpost, the task was to prepare for war and to assimilate nearby Beastman Tribes, consolidating them into the outpost to enhance its military strength.\nHowever, from the very beginning, these branch outposts were destined to be sacrificial pawns.\nThe Beastmen dispatched to develop these outposts were kept in the dark, sent to become cannon fodder to resist the evil spirit army!\nIn previous wars with the evil spirit army, the Alliance Beastmen were virtually wiped out in each conflict, so very few, only the upper echelons, were aware of the evil spirit's matters.\nAnd those Beastmen sent to the outposts were teams completely ignorant of the evil spirit.\nExcept for the leader, they were entirely unaware of their mission.\nIt was precisely because of this that when Austin broke through the Blood Claw Division, he did not obtain any information from the subordinate Beastmen.\nThe rapid dispatch from the central tribe headquarters to investigate the Blood Claw Division's destruction was largely due to the fear that the evil spirit army had already spread nearby, posing a near-fatal crisis for the Tribe Alliance yet to breach the Bloody Defense Line.\n\"No wonder the previous reports mentioned turmoil around the perimeter of the Kawa Great Forest. So that was the reason...\"\nAustin fell silent for a moment, overwhelmed by all the information.\nCombining the various prior pieces of information, everything became clear.\nThe appearance of the mutated evil spirit led to the birth of numerous zombie creatures, bringing catastrophic effects to the Kawa Great Forest. Masses of creatures fled and migrated, while the Beastmen who received the news first launched massive attacks on nearby weaker Beastman Tribes. Under the leadership of several super-large tribes, they established an alliance, planning to break through the Bloody Great Wall into the Human World and escape the dangers of the Kawa Great Forest.\n\"But can they really escape? Mutated evil spirit, zombies...\"\nFacing the current situation, Austin was deeply troubled.\nRather than being infected by the evil spirit's wicked energy, these living corpses resembled the result of a Zombie Virus from fantasy novel worlds of a past life, transformed through magic modification.\nBloodthirsty, hungry, feeding on the living, with immense strength, the only weakness being their heads... Even if the zombie army broke through the Bloody Great Wall into the Central Earth World, what then? Would the zombie army not follow close behind?\nBut right now, Austin did not have the power to change any of this. Even in the context of the vast Kawa Great Forest spanning tens of thousands of square kilometers, Austin was merely a small ripple on a vast ocean, one misstep and he might not even be able to protect himself.\n\"It seems necessary to prepare an exit plan. So far, signs of the zombie army have only been found in the southwestern direction, and nowhere else, so it might be worth exploring...\"For more chapters visit NovєlFіre.net\nPreviously, Rodney and other Dragon Nest teams had explored west, but without a compass, they constantly drifted south. As it stands, their direction is in the southwest. For now, it is only in the southwest that Austin discovered the zombie army's existence.\nCombining the location and the information obtained from the Blood Claw Beastmen, Austin roughly sketched out the current situation in the Kawa Great Forest in his mind.\nPerhaps, only the west and south suffered the zombie army's sweep, with other directions still safe.\nThough terrifying, the zombie army under the command of the mutated evil spirit couldn't possibly be invincible across the Kawa Great Forest's vastness. No one could claim complete understanding of this enormous forest; the zombie army might not overwhelm it effortlessly.\nIn vast jungle areas with complex topographies and expansive woodlands, who knows where a Legendary Lord of Magical Beasts or Giant Dragon might dwell? In the presence of such Legendary Domain entities, the zombie army can hardly act ferociously.\nFor this reason, even though Austin had reached the quasi-Gold level, he seldom ventured beyond a hundred kilometers from the Dragon Nest Tribe's territory, mostly staying within to build the Dragon Nest Legion, lacking any eagerness to explore the world beyond.\nIf he inadvertently intruded into some powerful being's domain, wouldn't it be a case of a wolf falling into a tiger's den? Caution was paramount; upon reaching the Legendary level, he could venture wherever he wished.\nFor now, the presence of the zombie army has only been detected in the southwest, indicating other directions might have mighty beings holding fort, or various reasons blocking the spread.\nWith this in mind, perhaps there isn't a need to head north beyond the Bloody Border into the Human world; migrating eastward or northeast might also be feasible.\nAustin was privately contemplating his withdrawal plans, spending considerable effort finalizing them. However, he did not act immediately but temporarily set the plan aside.\nGiven the current circumstances, it wasn't yet dangerous enough to necessitate immediate relocation and retreat. At least, the zombie army was still more than two hundred kilometers away from his tribe, with mountainous obstacles in between. Considering the slow spread of zombies and wastelands, it would take at least a year or two for them to even approach the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nMoreover, even if he intended to withdraw, the surrounding situation needed thorough investigation before making any hasty decisions.",

      "content": "Upon receiving the news, Austin felt as if the Dragon Nest Tribe he had established was on the brink of annihilation under the zombie horde, ready to be swallowed and destroyed at any moment.\nHowever, after careful consideration and weighing the actual situation within the Kawa Great Forest, Austin's tension eased slightly; at least the situation wasn't desperate enough to require immediate escape.\nHaving painstakingly accumulated this property, fleeing directly would mean forsaking two years of effort. Moreover, even if escape was considered, who could predict if greater dangers would appear along the way?\nAfter spending most of a day, Austin finally devised a counter-plan.\nStep one: dispatch elite Beastmen to monitor the movements of the zombie army in the southwest and send several additional squads to ascertain their extent, thus providing reference for Austin's final decision.\nStep two: send teams to explore to the east and north to leave an escape route for the future. Since zombies were discovered in the southwest, the west and south were essentially off the table; even retreat would only head towards the east and north.\nStep three, and the most critical step: enhance strength.\nEnhancement was needed not only for the Dragon Nest Race Tribe but also for Austin himself.\nThe discovered zombies, although incredibly strong and virtually indestructible unless hit on the head, had the flaw of being slow and lacking intelligence.\nAt least from the Dragon Nest Tribe's perspective, a well-trained team of Dragon Nest Beastman Warriors, equipped with Bronze Armor, holding Bronze Shields, and wielding three-meter Long Spears, formed a dense Long Spear Array that could defeat zombies several times their number without any loss.\nThe Tribe Alliance repeatedly suffered defeats against the zombie army, which, in Austin's view, was understandably expected.\nIn this primal great forest, even the top-tier, mega Beastman Tribes fought with chaotic charges led by their chiefs.\nFacing zombies, the uncoordinated hundreds or thousands of Beastmen would quickly succumb, with weaker Beastmen scratched and turned into zombies. The battle saw an ever-increasing zombie count, leaving the chief, despite being mighty, fighting alone once his companions had transformed into zombies. Fighting Qi was ultimately depleted before the Legendary Realm, eventually being overwhelmed by the vast zombie horde.\nBut the Dragon Nest Legion was different; with tight formations, three-meter Long Spears, and Copper Armor defense, zombies numbering ten times fewer than the Legion were easily slaughtered like swine and dogs.\nNow the Dragon Nest Tribe's Beastman count had increased to 20,000, most of whom were newly joined Beastmen, with some yet to complete their basic training.\nAustin's task was to arm the entire Dragon Nest Tribe Beastmen as effectively as possible, ensuring that both militia Beastmen and Beastmen laborers, and even the elderly and infirm, were fully equipped and trained for a potential war.\nIn addition to regular Beastmen, Austin also planned an intensive short-term training for the Extraordinary Beastmen, with various exercises, like push-ups, sit-ups, weightlifting squats, long-distance running, frog jumps, etc., multiplied thousands of times over, imposed on the Extraordinary Beastmen.\nTo learn the Beastman Three Techniques, a sufficiently strong body was required, and these exercises were intended to boost the Beastmen's Physical Fitness in preparation for future techniques.\nDuring this period, besides training the Tribe Beastman Race, Austin decided to enhance his strength as well.\nEver since the day of awakening from deep sleep, Austin's Level had stagnated for six months, and the Magic Power Resources from the consumed Magic Crystals had already been digested. To progress, devouring more Magic Power materials seemed necessary.\nThe Magic Crystal Vein discovered during the Spider Cave clearance now contained only some Sub-Magic Stones; the densely compacted Magic Crystals had been entirely devoured by Austin.\nMerely relying on the Beastman Legion to obtain scattered magic-infused minerals or Magic Fruits from the forest was clearly insufficient.\nThe Giant Dragon Race naturally bore Legendary Bloodlines, unlocking Legendary Law from their lineage's depths upon reaching maturity, directly entering the Legendary Realm.\nHowever, the magic needed for a dragon's growth far exceeded human imagination, almost ten to a hundred times more than what humans required to cultivate to the same Level.\nAlthough Austin was only breaking the threshold before Gold, the required magic was a substantial figure, and acquiring such Magic Power Resources only had one solution—to find another Magic Crystal Vein or another locale producing Magic Power materials.\nSuch sources of abundant Magic Power Resources were likely hidden within the dangerous zones of the Kawa Great Forest.\n\"It seems the plan to sweep the danger zones must proceed ahead of schedule.\"This text is hosted at NoveI-Fire.ɴet\nEarlier, Vini reported during the sweep of nearby Beastman Tribes that signs of danger zones existed within a hundred-mile radius of the Dragon Nest Tribe. Austin had been intrigued but had delayed due to subsequent events, without initiating the sweep plan.\nNow it appeared timing was appropriate.\nFor safety's sake, Austin decided to personally lead the team out.\n\"The plan to deal with the zombie army is barely complete, but handling those Blood Claw Tribe members is troublesome...\"\nConsidering the completed plan, Austin remembered the captured Blood Claw Tribe Beastmen; if in previous situations, immediate execution wasn't an issue, but now it required careful deliberation.\n\"Perhaps, there's this way...\"\nAustin's eyes flickered, forming a plan for dealing with Golden Lion Shiji and other Blood Claw Tribe Beastmen.\n...\nTime swiftly progressed into June,\nDuring the previous half-year, due to the inexplicable migration of beast herds, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe felt an underlying unease.\nThus, shortly after spring commenced, the tribe began thoroughly sweeping within a hundred-mile radius, capturing hordes of Beastmen and swiftly assimilating them into the tribal system, rapidly expanding the tribe's power.\nDuring this period, the tribe also established the Copper Mine Base, producing numerous Bronze Weapons, essentially developing the Copper Mine area into a tribe division, becoming a crucial component of the Dragon Nest Tribe's structure.\nMeanwhile, Austin began modifying Navy Six Techniques and successfully developed the Beastman Three Techniques, significantly boosting the Dragon Nest Tribe's strength.\nOverall, as the first half of the year concluded, the Dragon Nest Tribe's overall power underwent a remarkable increase.",

      "content": "In half a year, the military strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe has seen a leap in improvement, without much neglect in civil affairs.\nFirstly, with the successful smelting of bronze, various bronze axes, bronze hoes, bronze knives, and so forth have been successively crafted. Equipped with qualified metal tools, the Beastmen have completely abandoned the previously used stone axes and other such crude and fragile tools.\nWith the help of metal tools, the efficiency of the Beastmen in clearing and farming the land has greatly improved.\nIn the past, chopping down a tree might take more than half an hour. Now, an ordinary Beastman wielding a bronze axe can fell it in less than ten minutes. Additionally, the robust and durable bronze tools no longer require the cautious care that stone tools once did, avoiding damage and delays in the work schedule.\nThe result of the greatly improved efficiency in clearing land and farming is that, with the passage of the first half of the year, the cultivated land within the entire Dragon Nest Tribe has surpassed ten thousand acres.\nThe large-scale farming led to significant yields, coupled with the recent migration of numerous animal herds. The Dragon Nest Beastmen frequently hunted outside and cleared Giant Beasts, collecting a great deal of meat. Consequently, the granaries of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe are now full. Even if the tribe does nothing at all, the stored supplies are enough to sustain the entire Dragon Nest Tribe for half a year.\nHowever, while the vast tract of land was being cultivated, it also brought quite a few management challenges. Some of the cultivated lands are quite far from the Dragon Nest Base. To manage the lands better, the Dragon Nest Beastmen built one or two simple wooden huts next to the fields for resting during regular work breaks.\nApart from land cultivation, other internal affairs have also seen significant development.\nFirstly, the livestock sector has achieved substantial prosperity.\nIn the first month after the end of the cold winter, due to a population surge in the tribe, the stored grain was nearly exhausted. Also, the kudzu and other staple crops planted in the fields could not be harvested in the short term. Thus, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe experienced a period of food shortage.\nFortunately, as the weather warmed and everything rejuvenated, the boars and rabbits huddled in hibernation during the cold winter in the livestock pens began to grow fat quickly with abundant food, significantly contributing to the tribe's food supply. Additionally, the forest's revival brought many wild animals out, and the Beastman Legion engaged in intense hunting of wild beasts and Giant Beasts, bridging the gap until the first season of kudzu was harvested.\nThe importance of raising wild boars and rabbits was thus highlighted. Moreover, as migrating herds continuously passed by, the Dragon Nest Beastmen, besides killing adult beasts, also brought the young back to the tribe for domestication in the pens.\nWith the addition of many young animals and the natural growth and reproduction of animals within the pens, the scale of livestock raising has expanded significantly. When the migration of herds halts, the livestock scale will be enough to provide substantial meat for the tribe.\nMeanwhile, in addition to the domestication of meat livestock like boars and rabbits, the previously domesticated wild cattle scale has also increased.\nThe initial group of several hundred wild cattle has been entirely tamed by the Minotaurs. Due to the land clearing work and the introduction of bronze plows, various agricultural tasks have also seen considerable speed improvements.\nMoreover, the domesticated wild cattle have played a significant role in the transportation duties of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nIn places like the Kawa Great Forest, naturally, there aren't smooth roads. The distance from the Copper Mine Base to the Dragon Nest Tribe isn't close, with a rugged mountain path spanning about ten to twenty kilometers between them.\nWhen smelting copper at the Copper Mine Base, materials like charcoal can be sourced locally, but food needs to be transported from the Dragon Nest Base to the Copper Mine Base. Additionally, the crafted various copper items, such as tools, armor, weapons, and so on, need to be transported back to the Dragon Nest Base.\nThe entire Copper Mine Base has over a thousand Beastmen engaged in bronze-smelting production work, requiring substantial quantities of consumable goods like grains. Bronze itself is heavy, and transporting large numbers of bronze tools over distances of ten to twenty kilometers would require significant manpower if only done manually. However, now with domesticated wild cattle, it's different.\nWild cattle are extremely strong animals with formidable endurance and stamina. Using them for transportation has greatly eased the burden on the Dragon Nest Beastmen, freeing many from such heavy manual labor.\nAustin noticed the excellent transport capabilities of the wild cattle, leading to plans for a forest expedition to establish bases for production activities. But with the emergence of zombified spirits, the original plans were shelved.\nHowever, this does not mean the work of domesticating wild cattle has stalled. Given the recurring emergence of mutated evil spirits and zombies, Austin has already planned a contingency route, and during relocation, domesticated wild cattle will naturally be the main transport force.\nThus, during this period, the resources of the Dragon Nest Tribe have instead focused to some extent on the domestication of wild cattle.\nThe domestication of boars, rabbits, wild cattle, and other animals has yielded certain results. Meanwhile, in January, immediately after the cold winter ended, the Dragon Nest Beastmen began experimenting with fish farming.\nAfter three months of preparation during the cold winter, the Dragon Nest Beastmen produced a large amount of kudzu rope. Using these kudzu ropes, they wove cage-like structures and placed them in lakes and reservoirs, followed by the harvesting of fish and concentrating on fish fry farming.\nFish farming is still in the exploratory stage, and figuring out which fish species are suitable for concentrated farming requires constant experimentation. Although the concept of cage fishing was relatively mature in Austin's previous life, he only knew the basic idea without the detailed information, necessitating continuous testing of many techniques. Hence, no satisfying yield is yet seen.The source of thɪs content is n̷o̷v̷e̷l̷f̷i̷r̷e̷.net\nHowever, if the cage fishing project succeeds, the kudzu produced from farming will have a considerable recycling consumption method. Once farming is successful, it can yield a large quantity of fish resources, creating a new source of food.\nGiven the current situation, after half a year of fish farming, some progress has been made, providing a portion of the tribe's fish food supply regularly each month.\nAs long as the farming methods and fish species continue to improve, cage fishing will inevitably become another major food source for the Dragon Nest Tribe.",

      "content": "Apart from these, Austin's Dragon Nest Tribe also has a mushroom farm, which has now undergone a significant expansion.\nDuring the month of food shortage, the importance of the mushroom farm, led by the deer-bodied Finn, became apparent.\nAfter a year of exploration, the deer-bodied Finn has discovered a method to cultivate non-toxic mushrooms, achieving a 99% success rate, and under Vini's arrangement, began large-scale production with his subordinate beastmen.\nDue to the low input, high output, and short growth cycle of mushrooms, they have become another important food source within the Dragon Nest Tribe, contributing significantly to the tribe's food supply during the month of shortage.\nMoreover, the mushrooms themselves, after various culinary preparations, have won over many Dragon Nest Beastmen with their delicious and sweet taste, especially after a certain beastman chef, guided by Austin, created the incredibly tasty dish of chicken stewed with mushrooms, which became the top choice in the beastman canteen.\nEven Austin himself, who originally fed on various magic substances, couldn't resist his cravings and had the beastman chef prepare special meals for him several times.\nIn six months, the achievements of the Dragon Nest Tribe were remarkable.\nIn both military and civil affairs, there has been significant progress. Compared to a year ago, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe has expanded more than tenfold.\nHowever, Austin also understands that despite the current accomplishments, there is still a long way to go before reaching his envisioned level.\nMoreover, now with the mutated evil spirit zombie army rampant, looking around, the landscape is filled with crises. With the current strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe, they might rule in rural lands within a hundred miles, but once the zombie army sweeps through, they would inevitably have to flee in disgrace.\nTo prevent the kingdom he painstakingly built from being destroyed overnight, Austin decided to work even harder.\nThe first step was to address the issue of the captured Blood Claw Tribe beastmen. Austin decided to release two or three beastman captives from the Blood Claw Tribe, let them return to the Blood Claw Headquarters, and convey a decision to the Blood Claw Tribe chief.\nThat decision was that Austin and his subordinate Clan Tribe could replace the previous Blood Claw Division, monitor the zombie army's movements for them, and to some extent, snipe them.\nThe price for this would be that once the Beastman Alliance captures the Bloody Border, the Dragon Nest Tribe would be allowed to enter the Human World together to avoid disaster, and during the war, provide substantial war material support, such as magic arrows, weapons, and some transcendent beastman troops, etc.\nOf course, all of this sounds noble, as if sacrificing for the Tribe Alliance, but in reality, Austin wouldn't really lead the beastman Clan to fight to the death with the zombie army, nor would he put all his chips on the Beastman Alliance.\nIt's necessary to resist a bit, relying on the rugged mountains to snipe the zombie army. After all, he spent a lot of effort to establish this base and wouldn't retreat and waste it easily, but if things turn unfavorable in the war, he would immediately retreat to avoid the zombie tide.\nBefore that, Austin also planned to send out several beastman exploration teams to the north and east to see if they could find another escape route, at least not putting all hope on the Tribe Alliance.\nMeanwhile, Austin would prepare for retreat, including storing more food, training more wild cattle to achieve greater transport capacity, etc., so that if the zombie tide gets too close, he and his subordinate beastmen could quickly retreat and escape.\nAs for whether the Blood Claw Tribe would let go of the grudge of their division being annihilated, allowing him and his subordinate tribe to replace the Blood Claw Division's function, and whether the Beastman Alliance would agree to have him as a member of the alliance against the evil spirit zombies, Austin felt confident.\nAfter all, the main focus of the current Beastman Alliance is still on the Bloody Great Wall. If they could get fresh forces to help resist the following zombie army's pursuit, it would be greatly welcomed.\nEven if the Blood Claw Tribe wanted to stir trouble, the Beastman Alliance likely wouldn't agree, and if the Blood Claw Tribe truly led the tribe for revenge, it's not certain they could succeed. Even if they destroyed the Dragon Nest Tribe, they would still need to rebuild the base in this direction, a self-damaging thing that the Blood Claw Tribe chief shouldn't be ignorant enough to do.\nOf course, Austin wouldn't solely rely on the rationality of the Blood Claw Tribe chief. Thus, before the few Blood Claw beastman captives left, Austin took them on a personal tour of the Dragon Nest Tribe's military parade.\nAlthough some things were kept hidden, the display of the elite Dragon Vein Attendants and the elite beastman legion alone left the Blood Claw beastmen utterly amazed.\nThe information revealed in the military parade, combined with Austin's own strength, led the Blood Claw beastmen to estimate that even if the Blood Claw Headquarters attacked with full force, they might be able to destroy the Dragon Nest Tribe, but they would inevitably suffer heavy losses themselves.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the NoveIＦire.net\nAs for the Blood Claw beastmen's reactions, Austin was quite satisfied, and after they had witnessed the strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe, he let them go.\nBesides the intimidation from the military parade, Austin also planned to send a few people to follow behind them, to see if they could infiltrate the Beastman Alliance and gather information about the Blood Claw Tribe at any time.\nWith multiple preparations in place, Austin felt he had basically no worries and began to focus on other aspects.\nAs for the other captives from the Blood Claw Tribe, they were naturally locked together with the die-hard mercenary captives, forced to work for the construction of the Dragon Nest Tribe. Without a few months of hardship, they wouldn't have the opportunity to truly desire to surrender and join the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nWith the first six months of the year gone, to face the upcoming mutated evil spirit zombie tide, under Austin's leadership, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe began mobilizing, acting according to the previously established plan.\nThe beastman transcendents were gathered effectively, several teams were selected to explore toward the east and north, while a part of the elite beastmen went to the southwest to monitor the zombie army's movements and collect detailed information.\nMeanwhile, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe entered into intense production work, striving to produce more food and manufacture more copper tools.\nAnd a few days later, after directing and distributing a large amount of work, Austin led most of the elite of the Dragon Nest Legion and the remaining beastman transcendents to begin sweeping dangerous areas within the Dragon Nest Tribe region.",

      "content": "The Wet Bone Forest, situated in a large basin surrounded by mountains, is a forbidden area that strikes fear into the hearts of nearby Beastman tribes.\nFrom solitary wandering Beastmen to rampaging wild beasts, those who accidentally wander into the Wet Bone Forest never leave a trace.\nThe mist-covered land seems like a terrifying giant beast opening its mouth wide, devouring all living creatures.\nOver time, even the fiercest beasts understood the danger within that area and began to avoid it, keeping a distance from its range.\nUnexpectedly, the Wet Bone Forest's terrifying reputation turned it into an intimidating shield, making the areas nearby comparatively safe places.\nMoreover, although the Wet Bone Forest is dangerous, as long as one doesn't venture deep inside, there is typically no danger. Some weaker Beastman tribes have thus settled near the forest, relying on the fearsome Wet Bone Forest as their backing to survive in this perilous world.\nEven though the Wet Bone Forest inadvertently created a safe haven, the tribes camping nearby still greatly feared it. Every time they went hunting, they would automatically steer clear of the Wet Bone Forest when they approached it.\nAccording to legend, unknown Demons inhabit the mist-locked Wet Bone Forest, and any living creature that steps into the forbidden area turns into bones, decaying in the soil.\nIn reality, the small, weak tribes living nearby occasionally experienced disappeares, with rumors claiming that Demons from the Wet Bone Forest carried them off to serve as food during the night.\nFear spread among the tribes, but unfortunately, the tribes that moved nearby were all weak, and leaving would likely result in death in the dangerous jungles by the next day. They could only live in this area, begrudgingly relying on the Demons of the Wet Bone Forest for survival.\nFortunately, the Demons' abductions from the Wet Bone Forest were infrequent. Compared to the perilous, lethal external world, living near the Wet Bone Forest was bearable.\nOccasionally, some of the weaker Beastman tribes even began developing a primitive reverence for the Wet Bone Forest. When barely fed, they would offer sacrifices, perform primitive dances, and worship the Demons lurking in the Wet Bone Forest as if they were Divine.\nBut the Wet Bone Forest, after all, was not Divine,Original content can be found at N0v3l.Fiɾe.net\nTwo months ago, the fierce Dragon Nest Legion, led by Blood Wolf, surged along the scent trail left by the Beastmen.\nThe heavy armor, long spears reflecting cold glints, and strictly trained, unified formations surged forward like a black tidal wave. The little resistance present was like tiny stones dropping into a tsunami, vanishing instantly.\nThe next day, all tribes surrounding the Wet Bone Forest were destroyed, with all Beastmen captured and strung together by the Dragon Nest Beastmen, driven back to the Dragon Nest Base, leaving only ruins behind.\nThrough it all, the Wet Bone Forest showed no response, allowing everyone to leave.\nBefore leaving, the Dragon Nest Beastmen marked a circle representing a dangerous area on a crude beast-skin map, remembering this zone.\n...\nMore than two months have passed since the crushing war. The signs left by the orc tribes previously stationed here have been mostly erased by the hot and humid forest, with only traces of the past ruin visible on the moss-covered ground.\nRatman Bill stood before the former village ruins, his gaze crossing over the ground's debris towards the unfathomable depths of the Wet Bone Forest, filled with unease as sweat dripped down his forehead.\nTwo months ago, he was a member of one of the Ratman tribes living here. After the Dragon Nest Legion's destruction and sweep, he was captured and taken to the Dragon Nest Base for unified transformation training.\nWhen Bill was captured, strung together with his companions by a rope, and driven towards an unknown destination, he was consumed by despair.\nAlthough he had never been a captive slave before, he had heard from the old Beastmen about how tragic the fates of war captives could be, especially for their weak race with a battle power of less than five, potentially ending up as food for the strong.\nRatman Bill was filled with despair as he was driven to the stunning Dragon Nest Base.\nThe massive fortress, bustling Beastmen, orderly housing, and the booming construction sites all showcased the Dragon Nest Tribe's strength.\nThe awe-inspiring Dragon Nest Town was so overwhelming that it washed away Ratman Bill's fear and despair. They were then abruptly gathered together, organized, and subjected to a round of \"disinfection.\"\nDuring \"disinfection,\" Ratman Bill and his companions cried out in horror, fearing they were about to be washed clean and turned into food.\nBut it turned out he was completely wrong from the start.\nDespite being captives, their actual treatment was far better than he had imagined.\nThere were no imagined whips, no hunger, no beatings, and certainly no slaughter like livestock. None of the desperate scenarios he imagined materialized.\nIn that month's captivity, they ate well and slept well, with daily meals consisting of large amounts of kudzu roots and bark boiled in a large pot until they became a mush.\nNotably, it was purely genuine kudzu without any added bitter tree bark, weeds, or rhizome fruits. The kudzu fragrance almost made his mouth water even during training.\nMoreover, most importantly, the kudzu-cooked food was unlimited!\nIn other words, they could eat as much as they wanted!\nWhat a blissful life!\nFor those living in the lower strata of Kawa Great Forest like them, life was extremely poor, with daily meals sparse. Their daily food was a mixture of collected tree roots, grass roots, and bark, occasionally supplemented with bitter wild fruits that even birds wouldn't eat. Despite this, those fruits were rare delicacies for them.\nAs for kudzu, it was a more delicious treat above the bitter wild fruits. Containing a lot of starch, kudzu roots could fill and satisfy hunger with a slightly sweet taste, and for Ratmen, it was a supreme delicacy.\nThis delicacy was only brought out for tribal celebrations or sacrificial rituals to the Divine by the chief for communal festivity.",

This was absolutely delicious kudzu root!\nKudzu root is so delicious, no matter how much you admire and enjoy it, it's never too much. How could anyone disdain it?\nReally can't understand.\nHowever, facing the fragrant kudzu root porridge in his bowl, Ratman Bill quickly threw these doubts aside and started eating the food in his bowl in large mouthfuls.\nAfter licking the kudzu root porridge in the bowl clean, Ratman Bill still felt unsatisfied and couldn't help but look towards the place where the food was being distributed.\nThen, he suddenly noticed a fellow captive, who had just finished eating and licking the bowl clean, sneakily looking around. Then, taking advantage of most people not paying attention, he swiftly got back in line with his bowl!\nBut he wasn't the only one doing this. Not long after, another captive sneakily joined the back of the line, hoping to blend in and get a second helping of kudzu root porridge!\nRatman Bill was initially dumbfounded but then quickly became furious, his eyes burning with rage.\nThese dirty, shameless, despicable, brazen beastmen scoundrels, how could they behave like this? Where is their beastman pride!!!\nRatman Bill was beside himself with anger, his eyes continuously searching, hoping to see a Dragon Nest Beastman officer maintaining order appear.\nHowever, those instructors had already left to eat, leaving only a few of the smaller beastmen to maintain order.\nBill thought carefully, realizing that in this way, he was at a disadvantage.\nSo, Ratman Bill, taking advantage of the surrounding people's inattention, decisively sneaked into the line waiting for food.\nHe couldn't let himself suffer, so he decided to go with the flow.\nIn his indignation and with a heart full of condemnation and disdain towards his other companions, Ratman Bill consumed a full five bowls of kudzu root porridge, almost to the point of being unable to stand up.\nIt was only later that Bill learned that beastman captives like them were actually not restricted on food.Thɪs ⓝovelFire.net\nBecause those kudzu roots, boiled with their skin in a big pot, were the lowest-grade malformed produce from the fields. Anyone who lived in the Dragon Nest Tribe for a period of time had no fondness for this perennial staple food, not to mention the broken food made from these inferior, defective kudzu roots?\nPerhaps when they first joined the Dragon Nest Tribe and underwent a month of military training transformation, they were no different from the current Bill and others. But after living in the Dragon Nest Tribe for a considerable time and having solved their basic needs, naturally, they desired better-tasting, more delicious food.\nHaving enough delicious food to fill their stomach every day, and a comfortable house to sleep in at night, if not for the arduous daily training and heavy routine labor, Ratman Bill might have thought he had returned to the Divine Kingdom of the Beast God.\nA month of military training transformation, followed by Ratman Bill being praised by the beastman instructors for his diligent training and work efforts, as well as his good political awareness, thus joining in the loyalty ceremony to His Highness Austin as one of the outstanding representatives among the beastman captives.\nBill continued to work diligently afterward, cherishing life in the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThinking back to the days of hunger and cold in the previous tribe, struggling for a meal from day to day, Bill was determined not to return to the past. He worked hard to express himself and contributed efforts to the construction of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n...\nLooking at these ruins that almost disappeared in front of him and recalling the experiences of the past two months, it all seemed like a dream.\nTwo months was enough for the hardworking Bill to stand out, coinciding with Austin's decision to lead the team in clearing the nearby hazardous areas, setting their sights on the Wet Bone Forest, and requiring some native guides for this operation, among which the outstanding Bill was one.\nNow Bill stood here again, his hand gripping the long spear, trembling slightly, with sweat pouring down his forehead.\nAfter a month of military training transformation and a month of work solidification, Bill's mind had already become incredibly loyal to the great His Highness Austin, willing to risk his life and shed blood for His Highness Austin's grand cause.\nBut at this moment, facing the shadow that had loomed over him since childhood, Bill couldn't help but feel afraid.\nThis terrifying Wet Bone Forest was no simple place, shrouded in the shadow of fog, harboring terrifying horrors within.\nCould the Dragon Nest Legion truly succeed in clearing such an evil forest?\nLooking at the fog-covered Wet Bone Forest ahead, Ratman Bill couldn't help but feel anxious.\n\"Hey, Bill, hurry back, the battle is about to start.\"\nAt this moment, a familiar voice came from behind, belonging to one of Bill's beastman companions.\n\"Okay, I know, I'll be right there.\"\nBill quickly turned around and walked back towards the camp.\nAt this time, the outskirts of the Wet Bone Forest had been cleared by the Dragon Nest Beastmen into a large open area. A significant amount of weapons and supplies were transported here by buffaloes, with fences erected around the camp encompassing it simply.\nAround them, the Dragon Nest Beastmen busily wielded weapons, transporting supplies, and distributing arms, seeming ready to advance.\nSure enough, not long after, with the sound of a horn, a large number of Beastmen gathered on the open ground of the camp, forming well-organized formations that looked sharp and angular.\nAs the formations adjusted, copper armor clashed, emitting a shattering sound. The sharp copper spears held in their hands pointed towards the sky like groves of sharp copper spear forests, exuding a tremendously powerful military aura.\nAt the forefront of the formation, the assembled Bill glanced unobtrusively towards the direction of the command platform.\nStanding on the several-meter-high command platform were high-ranking figures of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nFor example, the Lizardman Rodney, whose body was several times taller than Bill, was the Legion Commander in charge of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe's legions and was the Tribe's foremost warrior.\nNext to Rodney stood the smart and resourceful Fox-faced Man Quik, who assisted in managing various internal affairs of the Dragon Nest Tribe, and it was said that the Tribe's unique medical system was established by him.\nWhether it was Lizardman Rodney or Fox-faced Man Quik, these two were both towering, high-ranking figures to Bill.\nTo the extent that in his two months of life in the Dragon Nest Tribe, apart from major official occasions like the ceremony marking the official integration of a class of trained beastmen captives into the Tribe, he rarely had the chance to see these two standing at the top of the Dragon Nest Tribe, ruling over tens of thousands of beastmen.",

But after meeting the great His Highness Austin, their fate changed, and they grew to become prominent figures among thousands of Beastmen.\nIf the positions were swapped, could I also become one of the fortunate ones?\nAmidst admiration, a thought Bill dared not hope for suddenly emerged from his heart.\nIn truth, Ratman Bill was unaware that Lizardman Rodney, Fox-faced Man Quik, and the Kobold Vini still managing the Dragon Nest Tribe, were not favored by Austin simply because they were the earliest to join the Dragon Nest Tribe, nor was it nepotism. It was due to the experiences they gained from long-term management of the Dragon Nest Tribe's operational systems.\nCurrently, the three are indeed the most suitable Beastmen to manage the various operations of the Dragon Nest Tribe because, through two years of step-by-step training, they have been deeply influenced by Austin's modern thinking. They are far more familiar with the framework Austin set up in the Dragon Nest Tribe compared to other Beastmen managers, and among a group of mediocre Beastmen, they naturally stood out to handle the tribe's various affairs.\nInitially, Rodney, Quik, and Vini's talents in their respective Domains among Beastmen might have been considered above average. Yet, through Austin's guidance and subsequent wealth of work experience in the tribe's early construction phase, they have surpassed other Beastmen in their respective Domains.\nDuring the Three Kingdoms period in the Cao Wei forces, most renowned generals were relatives of Cao Cao. Was it because Cao Cao's relatives were natural talents as military leaders, inherently superior at warfare?\nNo, it was merely because being Cao Cao's relatives granted them more opportunities for leading troops in battle, providing more experience. Familiarity breeds skill.\nLizardman Rodney, Fox-faced Man Quik, and Kobold Vini are similar; their talents are not extraordinary, but their wealth of experience through training makes them excel.\nRatman Bill did not know that perhaps, as the Dragon Nest Tribe develops and management layers diminish, the thought he dared not hope for might one day come true...\nAs Bill was lost in thought, the Dragon Nest Division had already completed its assembly.\nRodney and Quik stood beside the high platform without further action, occasionally whispering to each other, patiently awaiting the arrival of the great His Highness Austin.\nIt wasn't long before,\nWhoosh!!!\nA tremendous airflow appeared out of nowhere, bending the surrounding trees, making rustling noises, and sweeping the fallen leaves away in torrents.\nSimultaneously, a massive shadow suddenly filled the sky, crashing down on the high platform with dreadful might.\n\"My people...\"\nA deep voice resonated slowly, carrying overwhelming power and oppression. Austin scanned the orderly formation of thousands of Beastman Legion below, his gaze exuding undeniable authority.\nAny Beastman who met his eyes felt as if a mountain rested on their shoulders, yet in their hearts, fervent admiration surged, straightening their postures and reddening their faces.\n\"Become my sharpest long spears, go forth, and fight for me!\"Latest content published on novel·fire·net\nAustin gracefully spread his wings; the gigantic membranes almost obscured the skies, his voice resounding like thunder, shaking every Beastman to their core.\n\"Oh!\"\n\"Long live His Highness!\"\n\"Fight for His Highness!\"\nThe entire Dragon Nest Legion was collectively awed, the sound waves visibly surging like a tidal wave.\nAustin, the creator of the Dragon Nest Tribe, single-handedly provided the Beastmen, who once struggled on the line between life and death, a comfortable living environment, granting them the longed-for life of happiness without fear, without life-and-death struggles, bringing a tectonic shift to their existence.\nSimultaneously, from the military training reforms onwards, every Beastman captive was indoctrinated by those fervent believers, supplemented by some techniques Austin learned in his previous life for brainwashing, creating immensely loyal and fervent Beastman Clan members.\nIt can be said, every Beastman within the Dragon Nest Tribe is an utterly loyal subordinate to Austin, akin to some Divine fanatics.\n\"Advance, depart!\"\nAmongst the grand cheers, without saying much more, Austin directly ordered the march.\nBefore this, Austin had already prepared battle plans, having Rodney and Quik assist in commanding, ensuring all preparations were complete, ready for the military advance.\nWith Austin giving the order, the Dragon Nest Legion split into the tree division, like a Copper Armor torrent entering the Wet Bone Forest.\nWatching as the Beastman Legion started to enter, Austin also took to the air, flying above.\nSince the Wet Bone Forest is situated in a basin surrounded by mountains, the accumulated water vapor makes the usual mountain winds hard to penetrate. Coupled with unknown reasons, the entire Wet Bone Forest is shrouded in mist, obscuring vast distances.\nAustin had flown high for observation before, but the towering hundreds of meters tall ancient trees and dense fog made it impossible for him to truly see the conditions inside the Wet Bone Forest.\nFurthermore, with the fearsome reputation of Wet Bone Forest where no being entering has ever returned alive, Austin decided to deploy a massive army, advancing step by step, chopping down trees blocking the path to approach the core and clear this dangerous area.\nOf course, though Wet Bone Forest is perilous, it hasn't triggered a mortal crisis in Austin's Spiritual Sense. Hence, he dared to lead the Dragon Nest Tribe's large forces into the forest directly.\nAs the Copper Armor torrent of the Dragon Nest Legion moved through the forest lanes, visibility due to the fog was greatly reduced, only showing up to ten meters of surrounding environment.\nThe forest, appearing unusually quiet, only echoed the clanking footsteps of Copper Armor and the sound of trees being chopped, evoking an eerie feeling.\n\"That's enough, set camp.\"\nFeeling they had ventured about a hundred meters into the Wet Bone Forest, Austin looked around at the somewhat eerie environment, and commanded with a deep voice from the air.\nThe vigilant Beastman Legion halted, circled, and upon discovering nothing alarming, commenced to vigorously chop down the surrounding trees, clearing space for a camp base.\nThis was Austin's step-by-step strategy: never rashly advance until the true enemy is discovered.\nMeanwhile, Austin's considerable form descended into the woods, beginning to carefully observe the environment within the Wet Bone Forest.",

      "content": "Dark, damp, eerie—this was Austin's first impression of the Wet Bone Forest ahead.\nUnder the cover of towering ancient trees, the ground was covered with moss, and certain empty spots seemed slightly rounded and slippery. Other than the fern plants that reached half a person's height, there were no other plants on the ground.\nThe crooked branches of the surrounding trees appeared extremely menacing in the dark fog, as if some demonic creatures were hiding deep within.\nThe somewhat oppressive environment around didn't give Austin much of a feeling. Just entering a bit into the periphery, he hadn't noticed anything unusual so far, but considering the heavy, damp mist surrounding him, he had some guesses.\nHe estimated that living deep within the Wet Bone Forest were probably not demons, but some powerful tribes of magical beasts, particularly those with a water attribute.\nStanding in the Wet Bone Forest, Austin could clearly feel that the Water Attribute Magic Power in the air was much denser than outside, making the entire forest environment extremely damp.\nIt was precisely this environment rich with Water Attribute Magic Power that attracted those tribes of magic beasts attuned to water, who occasionally ventured out to plunder beastmen from the outer Beastman Tribe as food, hence being referred to as demons by those beastmen.\nHowever, creating such an environment likely wasn't the work of those hidden magic beasts, but rather because there was possibly some latent magic ore vein of water attribute or some powerful magic plants with water attributes within the forest, enveloping the whole Wet Bone Forest in layers of mist.\nWhether it was a magical ore vein or those magic plants, things containing powerful Magic Power were beneficial for Austin's growth, which was the reason Austin selected the Wet Bone Forest as his first target.\nAustin looked far into death, but his vision could only penetrate about fifty meters before being blocked by the fog and layers of branches.\nThe dense Water Attribute Magic Power made the water vapor in the air coalesce into thick mist. Combined with the mountain-ringed terrain surrounding the Wet Bone Forest, which prevented ventilation, the entire forest was shrouded in lingering mist year-round.\n\"Rodney, take a squad of elites to explore nearby, take the Blood Wolves, but don't go too far.\"\nReturning to the camp where trees were being chopped and beastmen were coming and going, Austin called Rodney over to instruct him.\nThe Wet Bone Forest was unusually quiet inside, and danger surely lurked. It's possible that the magic beasts were watching them from the shadows, simply avoiding direct confrontation for the time being due to the large-scale entry of the Dragon Nest Legion and Austin.\n\"Yes, Your Highness.\"\nRodney selected the majority of elite Dragon Vein Attendants from the Dragon Nest Legion assembled for this expedition, forming a squad and bringing the Blood Wolves along, leaving the camp to explore the periphery of the Wet Bone Forest.\nIn fact, Austin didn't have high expectations for Rodney and his team's scouting. This was just a normal precaution, given they had barely ventured a hundred meters into the Wet Bone Forest. Discovering its secrets so easily was unlikely.\nFrom the onset, Austin had already devised a battle plan for the Dragon Nest Legion, which was to advance step by step, relying on their formidable strength to push through and penetrate the entire Wet Bone Forest.\nMeanwhile, the Dragon Nest Beastmen not only cleared and established a camp but also had the task of removing obstacles along their path. A large group of Dragon Nest Beastmen organized themselves to cut down the trees and ferns blocking the road, laying the chopped leaves and fern grass on the ground and placing the trunks horizontally alongside the road as barriers, forming a rudimentary boardwalk leading outside the Wet Bone Forest.\nThis way, even the buffalo-formed transport teams could use this to enter directly into the Wet Bone Forest, ensuring transportation with the exterior.\nOf course, if Rodney and others could discover any additional clues, that would be even better. After all, the Blood Wolves had been tamed and now cooperated seamlessly with the Dragon Nest Beastmen, having contributed significantly multiple times.\nTime swiftly passed, entering night,\nThe temporary camp's road to the outside had already been opened, building a makeshift road connecting it with the outskirts of the Disaster Forest.\nA makeshift fence was also erected around the camp, with teams of beastmen patrolling the perimeter.\nAnd at this time, the Rodney squad, who had been exploring and standing guard on the periphery all day, returned to the temporary camp for rest, having found nothing along the way.\nHowever, what caught Rodney's attention was that the usually energetic Blood Wolves seemed a bit off when leaving the temporary camp, with their fur on their backs standing erect, occasionally growling at certain spots. But, as a bunch of beastmen cautiously approached, they found nothing.\nThis left a lingering shadow in Rodney's heart, prompting him to strengthen patrols in the middle of the night.\nWith the previous experience of the Spider Cave, the Dragon Nest Beastmen had already produced enough torches, ensuring there was no shortage of light during nighttime patrols. Teams of beastmen troops rotated patrols, taking turns and resting.\nThe night passed uneventfully, seemingly making their prior fears feel like mere illusions, yet no one relaxed because of it.\nThe next day, the Dragon Nest Legion ventured another hundred meters deeper.\nLike the previous day, Rodney led the team to explore the periphery, while the Dragon Nest Legion set up outposts, cutting trees and constructing roads, connecting with the previous outpost.\nThe entire day remained uneventful, with nothing more than a bit of agitation from the Blood Wolves.\nOn the third day, Austin led the Dragon Nest Legion another hundred meters deeper.\nAs on the previous two days, Rodney led the exploration, while the Dragon Nest Legion built outposts, opening up roads and connecting with the previous outpost.\nThis was the sweeping plan Austin had set from the start—to advance methodically until the hidden enemies within the Wet Bone Forest were forced out, breaking through the entire forest.\nThe fourth day, the fifth day...\nAs the Dragon Nest Legion pressed forward step by step, the Blood Wolves within the group grew increasingly restless, and Austin could distinctly feel that the hidden enemies seemed increasingly unsettled.\n\"What could it be?\"\nAustin gazed deeply into the heart of the mist, looking at the forest shrouded in layers of fog, lost in thought.\nBy the sixth night, the enemies in the shadows could wait no longer.\nRustling...\nIn the darkness, massive shadows glided through the forest, pressing down the tall ferns to the ground, creating a rustling sound as they slowly approached the camp.\nAt this moment, the lead Blood Wolves of the patrolling team around the camp suddenly halted, their ears perked up, sharp eyes fixed on the deep darkness outside, and started howling loudly.\n\"Awhooo!!!\"The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the NoveI-Fire.ɴet",

      "content": "The fur all over the Blood Wolf suddenly stood up, facing the darkness with a low growl, as if confronting some terrible enemy.\nThe leading Extraordinary Orc Captain hurriedly grabbed the Blood Wolf's rope, looking into the depths of the dense forest where the Blood Wolf was growling.\n\"What's going on?\"\nAll the Blood Wolves within the stronghold woke up accordingly, emitting low growls one after another, as the orc patrol teams within the stronghold became vigilant and alert.\nHiss, hiss, hiss...\nA low, hoarse hissing sound suddenly came from the darkness, accompanied by the rustling sound of something rubbing against the ground, something was approaching!\nBut in the Wet Bone Forest, the mist in the air already blocked visibility, and coupled with the meager light from the campfire at night, it was impossible to see what was happening in the darkness outside.\nHorror approached along with the sound, and a beastman transcendent snatched a torch from his subordinate and threw it into the dark depths where the sound came from with a swoosh.\nAs the flames illuminated the dark forest, it pierced through the thick mist to reveal the environment deep within.\nInstantly, the pupils of all the patrolling orcs on site shrunk unknowingly.The source of this content ɪs net\nSnakes!\nGiant Snakes!\nSnakes, twenty to thirty meters long, either gliding on the ground or clinging to trees, hung in midair, protruding their black tongues, constantly slithering towards the temporary stronghold, as many as twenty!\n\"Enemy attack!\"\nAccompanied by a shrill shout, a whistle made from bamboo emitted a sharp whistle, causing the entire stronghold tribe to stir at that moment.\nUpon hearing the whistle, the Dragon Nest Beastmen sleeping in the tents in the stronghold instinctively jumped up, hurriedly donned the weapons and armor placed aside with clattering sounds as they rushed out in teams.\nAs the Dragon Nest Beastmen resting in the stronghold gathered, the giant snakes also neared the premises!\n\"Raise shields! Position spears!\"\nThe night patrol was already prepared as they hoisted one-person high Bronze Giant Shields, forming rows, standing them upright at the front, while long spears protruded from the gaps at the edges of the Copper Shields, with sharp tips angled forward like a curled-up hedgehog protecting the camp stronghold behind.\nCrash, crash...\nOne by one, giant snakes swept forward, abruptly collapsing the simple wooden fence around the perimeter with a thunderous crash, instantly breaking through the outer defenses.\nEven though the outer wooden fences were merely simple constructions due to cautious tactics, they were still easily breached, showing the formidable nature of these giant snakes.\nHiss!\nAlong with the foul-smelling wind assaulting their noses, the black giant snake at the forefront flicked its tongue, emitting a harsh hiss, its originally agile body suddenly twisted, followed by the sound of the wind being sliced as a huge whiplash came crashing down from the sky.\nBang, bang, bang!\nThe tail of the giant snake crashed onto the Bronze Shields erected by the Dragon Nest Beastmen, with a resounding thud, a tremendous force akin to a tide crashing down, black snake scales scraping against Copper Spear, producing a sound of metal clashing.\nThump, thump, thump!\nAn entire row of beastmen was involuntarily pushed back a few steps by this strong force, but thankfully they stabilized immediately afterward, gripping their Copper Shields and Copper Spears more firmly.\n\"Hiss!!!\"\nThe black giant snake screeched fiercely as its tail got slashed by the sharp Copper Spears, leaving cuts with blood seeping and dripping onto the ground.\nPerhaps noticing the dire state of the attacking black giant snake, the other giant snakes also hesitated, slithering around the perimeter of the Copper Shields and Copper Spears, with scales scraping the ground and making rustling noises.\nHowever, the Dragon Nest Beastmen would not allow them much preparation time, as the resting beastman soldiers within the stronghold had fully gathered, with rows of Copper Shields upright and sharp Copper Spears bristling, making the entire stronghold resemble a noble hedgehog instantly.\n\"Archers, fire arrows!\"\nWith a command, the bowstring sounds whooshed, and sharp arrows shot out swiftly, covering the giant snake group with powerful force like rain.\nAlready during the conquest of the Centaur Tribe, Austin had the idea to establish the three major troops: Gun Shield Soldiers, Archers, and Cavalry.\nThough at that time, despite obtaining the bow and arrow manufacturing technology from the Centaurs, arrow shafts were made from specific plants, requiring a lot of effort to make, making widespread use difficult, so the archers' project wasn't immediately launched.\nBut subsequently, with the Dragon Nest Tribe refining copper technology's improvement, they could make qualifying Copper Swords and Copper Spears, achieving technical reserves for large-scale production of suitable Bronze Arrowheads, allowing Copper Arrowheads to equip arrows with power not inferior to arrowwood-made arrows, hence Austin commenced the Archers Legion construction.\nYet, due to the new establishment of the archer troops, only a hundred people in the entire Dragon Nest Division were selected for trial at present, and now the arrow firing marked their debut.\nWhoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\nArrow rain continued descending with powerful force, but hitting the giant snakes only made clinking sounds akin to striking iron armor, the sharp arrows merely scratched their scales, causing a couple of small wounds.\nBut this sufficed, as the arrows broke through the wounds, small but numerous, quickly covering the bodies of the snakes in the center of the arrow rain, with scales pierced by arrows, bodies filled with arrow shafts, and crimson blood streaming down.\n\"Hiss!!!\"\nA huge roar came from within the darkness, filled with powerful pressure.\nUpon hearing the hiss, the snake group seemed to receive a command, snake eyes turning red, crazily swarming towards the Dragon Nest Beastmen Legion.\nRustle, rustle...\nMore than twenty giant snakes thirty meters long crazily charged forward, with a momentum seemingly overwhelming like a tide, full of terrifying intimidation.\n\"Soldiers defend, all junior officers, use Copper Shield Heavy Strike on their heads! Drive them back!\"\nFrom behind, the Legion Commander Rodney suddenly issued the order.\nWith the order falling, several elite Dragon Vein Attendants emerged from the ranks, holding Copper Shields in one hand and Copper Swords in the other.\nInstant Step!\nAlmost simultaneously, with a dull sound, cracks opened on the ground, several figures vanished swiftly from the spot, flashing to the front of the giant snake group's assault in mid-air, forming a line in the air.\nIron Block·Heavy Strike!\nThe massive Bronze Shields positioned in front, then the figures simultaneously smashed down with the Bronze Shields, which acted like walls, forcefully striking the heads of the few giant snakes charging ahead.",

      "content": "The so-called junior officer is one of the military rank systems that Austin decided to implement temporarily within the Dragon Nest Legion.\nTo facilitate management, Austin directly divided the beastman soldiers in the Beastman Legion into three ranks:\nSoldier, Sergeant, and Junior Officer.\nAmong them, soldiers are ordinary beastman soldiers, whether gun shield soldiers, archers, or cavalry, as long as they are still ordinary beastmen, as long as their fighting capability is below that of extraordinary beastmen, they are all ranked as soldiers.\nOf course, those who achieve great merit are exceptions. Those who achieve great merit naturally qualify for a rank promotion to become sergeants.\nHowever, if there truly is a beastman soldier who achieves great merit, Austin might also grant the modification to become an extraordinary beastman to the soldier who performed the meritorious deeds, thus qualifying him to become a sergeant.\nSergeants are composed of ordinary extraordinary beastmen.\nAt the same time, sergeants serve as leaders in the beastman troops, leading ordinary beastman soldiers into battle. They are the grassroots backbone of the Dragon Nest Tribe Legion, with a status above that of ordinary beastman soldiers.\nAs for the final junior officers, they are composed of elite Dragon Vein Attendants.\nElite Dragon Vein Attendants are the twenty extraordinary beastmen initially selected by Austin to experiment with the Beastman Six Techniques.\nTheir physical prowess is above that of ordinary Dark Dragon Guards, Dragon Vein Attendants, and other extraordinary beastmen. They are the elites among elites, and grasp any of the Beastman Six Techniques, with combat prowess far surpassing ordinary extraordinary beastmen.\nJunior officers in the Dragon Nest Legion hold the position of officers among officers.\nAny junior officer must learn any one of the Beastman Six Techniques to qualify.\nAnd now, the few junior officers present were originally part of Austin's initial twenty-member test group, all of whom are already skilled in using Austin's modified Beastman Four Techniques powerfully!\nThe elite Dragon Vein Attendants proficient in the Beastman Four Techniques are several times as strong as normal extraordinary beastmen!\nEach junior officer flashed through the air, brandishing the copper shields in their hands like indestructible walls, crashing toward the heads of the giant serpents.\nThough this period of time seems long, from the moment Rodney ordered the elite Dragon Vein Attendants to flash in front of the serpent group, it took merely a second or two.\nThe extremely swift flashing speed rendered the serpent group oblivious and instantly struck by the massive bronze shields.\nBang bang bang!\nIn the midst of the muffled sounds of collision, air currents stirred, and several giant serpents running at the forefront were struck fiercely and sent flying backward with half of their heads flattened.\nHowever, it wasn't over yet. The elite Dragon Vein Attendants wielding the heavy blow with the copper shield only paused momentarily in mid-air.\nBeastman Four Techniques - Air Walk!\nOriginally, Austin proposed the concept of shaving and renamed it as Air Walk. Subsequently, in the battle at the Copper Mine Base, under the drive of battle instincts, the blood-returning jackal wolf youth Meng Bi used instantaneous steps as the foundation, with the concept of Air Walk as the core, to unleash a true ability to kick the air and gain power in the air.\nAfter Meng Bi was healed, Austin obtained the terrifying correct usage from him and handed it to the junior officers among the Dragon Nest Tribe to improve and cultivate.\nNow, the goal for the magically modified Navy Six Techniques has completed four techniques, becoming the unique Combat Skills Beastman Four Techniques in the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThe junior officers are in mid-air, kicking the air at a speed invisible to the naked eye, while numerous layers of fighting qi gathered beneath their feet erupt several times in an instant, stacking up immense power.\nBoom!\nThe muffled sound of air rupture spread through the air, visible ripples oscillating outward from the use of instantaneous steps to kick the air. The elite Dragon Vein Beastmen gained a powerful propulsion force out of nowhere, and suddenly transformed into a vanished shadow sprinting toward the serpent group.\nWhile still in mid-air, the bronze greatsword gripped tightly in their hands.\nSwish!\nStrands of white light suddenly lit up in the dark, forming a trail of dazzling cold light, the brilliant gleam illuminating the darkness, instantaneously flashing between the bodies of the launched serpents.\nGale Wave Slash!\nBefore the serpents could react, the serpent at the forefront, sent flying in the air, had already been slashed in half, split into two sections, with the foul blood splattering down from above.\nWitnessing their companions at the front suddenly being bisected, the remaining serpents were all dumbfounded, suddenly stopping midway, coiling into clusters, tongues constantly flicking out, hissing at the few junior officers.\n\"So powerful!\"\nAt this point, the Dragon Nest Legion behind it was also shocked to the core, staring blankly at the scene before them.\nEach of these serpents being slashed were thicker in girth than a person's waist, with a length of thirty meters, standing upright to reach the dense forest overhead, with enough strength to crush a tree with a swing.\nIf it were them, this ordinary beastman army, wanting to slay serpents of this magnitude, even with weapons and armor equipped, it would require at least a beastman team of over fifty people to team up and a sacrifice of several lives to possibly kill the serpent.\nYet these terrifying serpents, in the hands of the junior officers, are like pigs and dogs without resistance, lazily sliced into two segments, the blood-drenched half corpses still twitching on the ground.\nThe nature of beastmen is inherently to submit to strong individuals; now, witnessing the power of the junior officers, their hearts are filled with infinite yearning, wishing someday they could reach such levels.\nAt the same time, for the great His Highness Austin who created all this, there is boundless fervent worship.\nAt this moment, among countless pairs of eyes gazing at the junior officers with passionate admiration, none noticed the concealed greedy and longing gaze.\n\"A secret technique, another secret technique!\"\nThe former Mercenary Deputy Captain Gory, who had joined the expedition, roared wildly in his heart, wishing to embody one of those junior officers immediately to gain those immensely powerful secret techniques.\nIf he could acquire these secret techniques and safely return to the Central Earth World, then his gains from this journey would be sufficient to make his strength soar, enough to support him becoming an aristocrat above others, and even establish a long-lasting family line!Get full chapters from N0v3l.Fiɾe.net\nAs a Silver level individual, Gory could see how, despite those junior officers only being at Bronze high tier level, the power ignited through those few secret techniques was not inferior to ordinary Silver level warriors.\nGory believed that if he could gain these combat skills and become proficient with their use, he could even use them to contend with Gold-level great warriors.\nIf possessing Gold-level strength, which duchy in the Central Earth World couldn't easily grant him a noble title?\nA noble title, a set of eternally inherited secret techniques, either one is what the civilian-born Gory desires intensely, enough to create a family line that stretches for generations!\nAt this moment, Gory's gaze upon those junior officers brimmed with utmost desire.",

      "content": "Gory, born as a commoner, admired those lofty nobles from a young age, hoping one day to become one of them.\nHe apprenticed under a retired, disabled old mercenary in the village, learning a simple Breathing Technique. After activating his inner Fighting Qi seed with this technique, the old mercenary recommended him to the city to become a Mercenary Apprentice.\nIn the blink of an eye, decades passed. During this time, Gory killed thieves, slew Magic Beasts, and explored various ruins left by the strong. By chance, he acquired a potion crafted by a Wizard, which allowed him to successfully break through to the Silver Level.\nHowever, that potion consumed the body's potential to gain Level advancement, meaning Gory could hardly progress further from then on.\nSilver Level, in the Human World, is just of medium standard. Joining the army could earn him an officer's position, but thinking to rise from commoner status to nobility was simply wishful thinking unless he could make great achievements on the battlefield.\nBut in reality, for a common officer like him without backing, the most arduous and dangerous tasks in the usual wars fall to them, while opportunities for real merit are reserved for those with deep noble lineage.\nSurviving narrowly in the army, retiring with wounds and in desolation, barely hanging on with the meager pension, is not the life Gory wanted.\nIt's better to continue being a mercenary outside. With his Silver Level abilities, he could assume a Deputy Captain position in the mercenary corps where strength is solely respected.\nYears of mercenary life, except for occasionally envying the lofty nobles, had already worn out his childhood thoughts. Now, his greatest wish was to earn a lot of money, buy a large piece of land, and become a major landlord in the countryside.\nOf course, that was before he was captured by the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nFrom the day he witnessed Austin demonstrating the unfinished power of the Beastman Six Styles, Gory completely changed his mind, forming an intense desire for those Secret Techniques.\nHe saw the chance to change his fate and become a noble!\nGory knew that even if he could escape the Dragon Nest Tribe now, he would merely become a petty mercenary with life and death at the mercy of fate upon returning to the middle world, because having forcefully broken through to Silver Level with a potion, he had no future for further advancement.\nPerhaps by struggling hard, begrudgingly surviving, saving up some money despite sustaining injuries, marrying a wife with unremarkable looks, buying land in the filthy countryside, becoming a landlord, only to have his injuries relapse in old age, confined to a wheelchair.\nBut now, if he could obtain those Secret Techniques, he was confident of demonstrating Gold Level combat prowess with his Silver Level ranking!\nIf he possessed Gold Level combat strength, then he would be among the high-level forces in the Human World, making it not so out of reach to acquire the lowest rank of baron.\nFull of ambition, Gory decided to lay low.\nTo infiltrate the higher-ups of the Dragon Nest Beastman Tribe and gain access to the cultivation methods of those Secret Techniques.\nGory began to showcase himself proactively, striving diligently in various production work, wholeheartedly contributing to the development and construction of the Dragon Nest Tribe, hoping to thus establish meritorious deeds, attract the attention of the beastman leadership, and obtain the training methods of the Beastman Six Styles.\nVini and others noticed Gory's efforts, praised him several times, and included him in the legion as one of the officers, leading a team.\nIn this expedition to sweep the Wet Bone Forest, Gory, as a former Mercenary Deputy Captain, with extremely rich experience in exploration and wilderness survival, was brought along on this mission and held a consultative role in strategy.\nAustin's cautious step-by-step strategy was partly due to Gory suggesting various potential dangers, many of which were hard to resolve.\nSuccessfully entering the high-level view made Gory exceptionally excited because he saw hope for acquiring those Secret Techniques.\nHowever, what Gory did not know was that his hope was destined not to be fulfilled for a long time.\nBecause before they owned territory with a sufficient human population, Austin would not consider admitting these mercenaries into the upper echelons and exposing them to the Beastman Six Styles.\nHumans, by nature, are more complicated and convoluted than beastmen.\nMoreover, Austin didn't sense the same loyalty and fervor from Gory as from the Dragon Nest Beastmen, nor did he feel any sense of belonging Gory felt to the Dragon Nest Tribe. How could he easily teach out the Beastman Six Styles?\nThese human mercenaries, at the very least, needed their bodies and minds to integrate into the tribe before Austin would let them become high-ranking members.\nThe powerful might of the Beastman Six Styles not only filled the hearts of ordinary beastmen with yearning, but the former Mercenary Deputy Captain Gory also desired it intensely, creating a great longing among every Dragon Nest army officer present.\nPreviously, the Junior Officers and their Extraordinary Beastmen were basically on the same tier. Although the combat power of the elite Extraordinary Beastmen was stronger, being on the same rank meant the gap was visible.\nBut now, as their comrades began learning the Beastman Six Styles under the great guidance of His Highness Austin, the gap between them opened up completely, with no gap in sight.\nTrain harder, train harder!\nOnce their physical fitness meets the standard, after cultivating the Beastman Six Styles, they'll possess the ability to slay a Giant Snake in an instant just like the Junior Officers!\nWithin the Dragon Nest Division, observing the performance of the Junior Officers ahead, every beastman now harbored a deep yearning for strength.\n\"Hiss!!!\"For more chapters visit novelꜰire.net\nThe Giant Snake herd, previously charging, was also deterred by such a scene, watching the beastman Junior Officers flashing back, not pursuing, hesitating uncertainly.\nIn the darkness, the fire crackled, with both sides standing in silent standoff,\nThe Dragon Nest Beastmen side exuded momentum, eager to rush forward and slaughter the Giant Snakes, but as the Legion Commander Rodney did not give the order, the Dragon Nest Beastmen had to remain within the formation, tightly gripping their weapons, staring intensely at the Giant Snake herd with fervent eyes.\nThe Giant Snake group coiled into a ball, tongues flicking in and out, massive heads bobbing in the air, hesitating whether to attack the enemy in front.\nHiss!!!\nSoon, a screech filled with authority, like metal scraping, echoed from the darkness.\nThe Giant Snake herd, as if receiving an order, retreated like the tide, dissipating into the darkness.",

      "content": "\"Have they left...?\"\nWatching the giant snakes retreat into the darkness, the leader of the Dragon Nest Legion, Rodney, also breathed a sigh of relief.\nAlthough the Beastman Six Techniques are powerful, Rodney, who has personally practiced these combat techniques, knows well that using the six techniques is extremely taxing on the beastmen's stamina and Fighting Qi. At this stage, the Dragon Vein Officers are not yet capable of continuous combat.\nIn this dark night, coupled with the thick mist, if the giant snake horde truly charged regardless of casualties, the entire Dragon Nest Legion would probably suffer heavy losses.\n\"Clear the battlefield, stay alert!\"\nRodney waved his hand and issued the command for vigilance.\nAlthough the giant snake horde has retreated, there's no telling if they might make a surprise return attack, so they must remain cautious.\nFollowing Rodney's orders, some beastmen began to clean up the corpses of the giant snakes on the ground, while others lit torches and patrolled the perimeter to ensure the safety of the camp's stronghold.\nJust after Rodney had arranged the post-battle matters,\nWhoosh!\nSuddenly, a massive air current stirred in the sky above. The lush leaves and branches split to the sides, casting a massive shadow that descended onto the scene.\n\"Greetings, Your Highness Austin!\"\nRodney and other high-ranking beastmen quickly stepped forward to greet him, but Austin brushed it off and directly asked:\n\"How are things going?\"\nEven before entering the Wet Bone Forest, Austin sensed that although the forest was dangerous, the level of danger did not feel fatal.\nAt the time, Austin had speculated that the hidden demon beast race within the Wet Bone Forest might not be very formidable; it was just that the surrounding beastman tribe was too weak to discover their true nature, which allowed the forest's fearsome reputation to persist.\nHowever, during the camping experience of the past five days, based on the anomalies from the Blood Wolf and the vague sense from deep within the forest, Austin couldn't help but suspect that perhaps his presence deterred the demon beasts from attacking.\nTo lure the hidden demon beasts from the depths of the forest to attack, Austin left the temporary stronghold on the sixth night and roamed the perimeter.\nThe result was as expected, the temporary stronghold in the Wet Bone Forest was indeed attacked.\n\"Report to Your Highness, three warriors from the tribal army suffered fractures from the impact force on the Bronze Shield, but there were no other major issues. A few contributing officers are slightly exhausted.\"\nThis night attack, although seemingly anticlimactic, was only so because the Dragon Vein Officers instantly killed several giant snakes, scaring off the invaders.\nThe initial black giant snake struck with its tail, and the incredible power not only repelled a squad of more than twenty heavily armored beastman gun shield soldiers, but those who directly bore the brunt of it had their arms dislocated and fractured under the crushing force while holding the Bronze Shield.\nFortunately, the toughness of the bronze alloy was sufficient; if it had been the previous Wooden Shield or Stone Shield, it would have shattered on the spot, and the powerful snake tail would have crushed the beastmen in the front row.\nWith the introduction of bronze alloy, it gave the ordinary beastmen of the Dragon Nest the confidence to confront such massive creatures like the giant snakes in group combat.\n\"Hmm, make proper arrangements for the injured warriors' recovery and discuss the next steps of our battle plan.\"\nAustin nodded and said solemnly,\nInstructing Rodney to take care of the current post-battle cleanup, then later convene to deliberate on the forthcoming strategy.\nThe fact that the demon beast in the Wet Bone Forest turned out to be a horde of giant snakes was unexpected, yet within reason.\nSnakes inherently favor dark and damp places. This Wet Bone Forest, due to its environment, is enshrouded in thick mist year-round, the air inside is very humid, and the tall trees block out the sunlight, making it an ideal habitat for snakes to thrive and reproduce.\nThe occasional disappearances of inhabitants from the beastman tribe on the forest's outskirts are likely the result of giant snakes sneaking out at night, silently slipping into homes, and silently strangling and devouring the sleeping beastmen.\nNo wonder that after the Dragon Nest Legion's large-scale advancement into the Wet Bone Forest, the Blood Wolf grew increasingly uneasy, and Austin faintly sensed the surveillance from deep within the mist.\nSnakes have nearly zero vision, relying instead on infrared sensing abilities, so the dense mist permeating the Wet Bone Forest's air is essentially irrelevant to them, enabling them to monitor the Dragon Nest Legion's every move from the unseen periphery.\nJudging by tonight's attack, there must be a particularly intelligent leader among these giant snake hordes.\nFortunately, after tonight's attack, Austin and the Dragon Nest Legion now know precisely what lurks within this Wet Bone Forest, which is better than fumbling blindly.\nAs long as they know what demon beast race resides here, they can devise countermeasures accordingly.\n\"...If we want to conquer the Wet Bone Forest, we must completely eliminate the giant snakes hidden within the mist... Due to the nature of snakes, able to \"see\" other creatures in the dark, nighttime is their most advantageous battleground, so we must achieve victory during the day when we can exterminate the entire horde, ensuring none escape and hide in the jungle.\"\nWithin the temporary camp, the high-ranking officers of the Dragon Nest Legion gathered together, discussing the next direction of advancement. Former Mercenary Deputy Captain Gory spoke eloquently before Austin and the beastman officers.\nThe Wet Bone Forest itself is shrouded in thick fog, leaving visibility hazy and limited to a range of ten meters, and at night, one can only see vague silhouettes in the dim light from flames.\nSuch an environment is naturally a snake's home terrain. At night, the Dragon Nest Legion is at a disadvantage; thus, war must be waged during the day.\n\"If a few giant snakes unfortunately escape and hide within the forest, it will be incredibly difficult to root them out, which would be detrimental to future resource development in the Wet Bone Forest.\"\nGory had some speculations about why Austin was sweeping through these dangerous areas.\nTo exploit the resources within the Wet Bone Forest, killing all the threatening giant snakes would be the best course of action.\n\"In that case, we must find the lair where the giant snake horde gathers, but this Wet Bone Forest is vast, with the thick fog hindering scouting, so how can we locate it?\"\n\"How about luring the giant snakes into another attack, then send people to follow after they retreat?\"\n\"No, the giant snakes' vision in the dark isn't impacted, and we wouldn't see anything without a light.\"\nFor a moment, the venue was abuzz with discussions, but most beastmen were frowning, unable to come up with a solution.\nHow exactly can they find the lair of the giant snake horde?",

      "content": "Hard, hard, hard!\nThe Wet Bone Forest itself is already the home turf of the giant snake group, coupled with their infrared detection capability, in this fog-filled woodland, they possess a cheat-like perspective ability.\nTrying to find the giant snake's lair in this forest will take an unknown amount of time, let alone having to guard against the snake's raids along the way.\nFor a moment, all the Beastman officers inside the base fell silent, even Gory couldn't come up with a method to break the deadlock quickly.\nWith the strength of the Dragon Nest Legion, although they possess the power to forcefully break through the entire Wet Bone Forest, it's still unknown how many lives would be lost in the process. Even if they do break through the forest, if any fish slip through the net and swim in this fog-covered woodland, it would be even more troublesome.\nAt the moment, Austin had no good ideas either.\nTo crush the giant snake group in one move, one must find their lair, but in this kind of environment, it's impossible to deploy Beastman soldiers for a blanket search, and even assembling together for search would consume an unknown amount of time.\nWhile deep in thought, the Beastmen sitting around the fire could not come up with anything.\nJust as Austin was about to call off the meeting, he suddenly noticed in his peripheral vision, on the previous battlefield, two Blood Wolves sniffing around the ground stained with snake blood, occasionally licking the ground with their crimson tongues, and then looking into the distant darkness.\nSuddenly, a flash of inspiration struck Austin's mind.\n\"Blood Wolves! Yes, the Blood Wolves!\"\nGiant snakes can sense enemy directions through infrared because the forest's fog poses little restriction to them, in fact, it becomes an advantageous home field for them.\nWhile Dragon Nest Beastmen find their vision obstructed by the surrounding mist, it doesn't mean the Dragon Nest Legion lacks the ability to locate them.\nBesides the Beastmen, the Blood Wolves are also part of the Dragon Nest Legion.\nBlood Wolves, apart from seeing enemies with their eyes, can also confirm enemy locations through their sense of smell.\nIn this Wet Bone Forest, due to the foggy conditions, the Blood Wolves' sense of smell is somewhat dulled, initially only responding when giant snakes approached within a certain range of the base. Austin didn't let the Blood Wolves pursue due to various reasons, causing the Beastmen to inadvertently overlook this point.\nBut now, the situation is completely different from when they first entered the Wet Bone Forest.\nNow, the identity of the enemies hiding inside the forest is clear; many worries no longer need to be feared, and the direction of the departing giant snakes can be tracked directly.\nMoreover, the most important thing is the bloody scent from the injured giant snakes!\nIn the previous attack, the surging giant snakes were shot at by the Beastman archers in rounds of arrow rain. Although no giant snakes were killed, some scales from the snakes at the center of the arrow rain fell off, leaving them wounded and forced to hide behind.\nAfter the snake group retreated, the bloody scent left by the injured snakes became the best marker!\n\"Everyone, be prepared to march quickly following the Blood Wolves' lead at daybreak; action must be swift to catch the snake group off guard!\"\nWith this thought, Austin immediately gave the order.\nThe bloody scent can linger for a considerable time, and tracking closely behind the retreating snake group using the Blood Wolves should lead to the giant snake group's lair base.\nAnd judging from tonight's situation, the one commanding the snake group in the darkness has certain intelligence. To conquer them, a rapid march must be executed to catch them unprepared!\n...\nThe next day, the prepared Dragon Nest Legion set out thunderously, following closely behind the Blood Wolves, advancing quickly.\nThis time, Austin also soared in the air, moving along with the team; beneath, teams of Beastmen flowed like a torrent through the forest, an unstoppable force, destroying everything in its path.\nThe entire Wet Bone Forest area is a five-kilometer basin, and with full-force marching, they can cross it by midday.\nTherefore, under Austin's strategic decision, the Dragon Nest Legion had abandoned the initial step-by-step cautious approach.\nAfter marching for an undefined period, as the ground gradually turned into piles of round stones, the towering trees around began to become sparse, massive round paths appeared between half-height unknown shrubs.\nAt this point, the Blood Wolves at the front stopped, growling lowly at the front, pausing and restlessly facing forward.\n\"This is the place!\"\nAustin landed on a branch of a gigantic tree, gripping the iron-like iron claws tightly onto the branch, his gaze fixed ahead.\nUnder this dense white mist, the Beastmen's vision is limited to within ten meters, but being of the Giant Dragon Race's legendary bloodline, Austin's senses are several times stronger than those of ordinary races like Beastmen. In this thick mist, he can even see fifty meters away.\nIn his line of sight, a large fountain-like valley entrance loomed faintly, surrounded by unbelievably smooth round stones; it's uncertain whether these stones are naturally formed or manmade.\nAnd at that time, surrounding the valley entrance, were massive pythons curling, each was twenty to thirty meters long, as thick as a barrel, no less intimidating than the giant snake group that raided the temporary base last night, with a number exceeding hundreds!\nAs for the leader of the snake group, due to the terrain and fog cover, Austin did not see it.\nBut it's certain that the leader of the giant snake group must be among them.\nMoreover, based on previous signs, it's speculated that these giant snakes might be snakes that prefer nocturnal activities; now it's daylight, it's very likely all the giant snake groups are gathered in this pebble-filled valley.\n\"Bring the Blood Wolves, divide the teams, all warriors surround that valley entrance for me!\"\nWith Austin's command, the Dragon Nest Legion down below immediately followed the Beastman Officers, dividing into four teams and dispersing in different directions.Latest content published on .ɴet\nThe central team, gathered with Austin, Rodney, Quik, and most of the combat forces, was responsible for the frontal assault.\nAs for the other three teams, they circled around, surrounding on three sides, waiting for Austin to lead the Beastman army to penetrate the giant snake group head-on, they would then converge to completely kill the escaping giant snakes.\n\"All units advance!\"",

      "content": "The Giant Snake Leader is at least a Gold Level Lord of Magical Beasts, and its innate magic must also not be weak, allowing it to dominate the entire Wet Bone Forest.\nUnfortunately, from the beginning, the entire snake group fell into Austin's calculations. First, a thunderstorm cleared all its kin and helpers around it, followed by the Beastman army's assault to completely cut off its support.\nIn the end, even though Rodney got into some trouble due to his rashness, he successfully attracted its hatred, allowing Austin to find the opportunity to strike and successfully break its spinal cord.\nAlthough the Giant Snake Leader with a broken spinal cord was not dead yet, its strength had greatly diminished, and with such a large body dragging it down, there was no chance of escape.\nIn the subsequent battle, with Austin as the main attacker and the Beastman Transcendents as support, they finally pinned the Giant Snake Leader to the ground not far from the valley entrance.\nThe aftermath of the battle between the two giants left the earth in a mess, with potholes everywhere, fissures as thick as an arm spreading out, stones shattered, and blood covering the ground.\nDuring this process, the serpent leader, in its death throes, used its venom spray talent magic at the last moment, corroding the ground ahead into a large pit over ten meters wide.\nFortunately, the close-range assisting Extraordinary Beastmen were Beastman Officers trained in the Beastman Six Techniques, who used Instantaneous Step Flash to escape in the nick of time.\nHowever, the terrifying poison emitted by the serpent's spray even contaminated the air, causing several Beastman officers in the distance to be too late to escape, inhaling the air and collapsing from poison.\nRip!\nWith a claw, the head of the Giant Snake Leader was torn open, and sure enough, a black Magic Beast Crystal Core was found inside.\nAmong the entire valley of giant snake magic beasts, only the Giant Snake Leader's body contained a Crystal Core, which was within Austin's expectations.\n\"Finally managed to kill it.\"\nAfter extracting the Magic Beast Crystal Core from the Giant Snake Leader's body, Austin showed no intention of swallowing it immediately.\nThis black giant python's poison was extremely potent, who knew if the Crystal Core, concentrated with its essence, might be even more dangerous? Even though the Dragon Race's magic resistance is strong, it's not to the extent of being immune to everything.\nAfter thinking about it, Austin tossed the Crystal Core to the Fox-faced Man, Quik.\n\"Quik, take this and study it to see if it has any other uses.\"\nThe Magic Beast Crystal Core is the crystallization of a powerful magic beast's entire strength and essence. Even though the Giant Snake Leader is now dead beyond doubt, the Crystal Core still holds the pressure of a High Tier Magic Beast.\nIn other words, as long as someone holds that black giant python's Magic Beast Crystal Core, ordinary snake animals would automatically submit and be commanded by it.\nMoreover, within the Wet Bone Forest, the environment itself is suitable for the survival of snakes. Although the giant snake tribe has been wiped out, quite a few other snakes must still be scattered around. With this Giant Snake Leader's Crystal Core, moving or producing within the Wet Bone Forest would be much easier in the future.\nFurthermore, centering on this Crystal Core and finding a method, there might be a chance to develop a Beastman that can command snakes—currently, the Dragon Nest Tribe doesn't have a snake race, but that doesn't mean it can't have one in the future.\nWith the death of the Giant Snake Leader, there's nothing left in the entire Wet Bone Forest that makes Austin feel threatened.\nLeaving the aftermath of cleaning the battlefield to Rodney and others, Austin swiftly flew to the valley entrance where the Giant Snake Leader appeared, with Quik and a few Beastman Officers following behind, and the well-informed Gory also proceeding together.\n\"Is this... a karst cave?\"\nA dragon and several Beastmen flew down from above the massive valley entrance. With the demise of the Giant Snake Leader, the gray poison gas previously permeating the Giant Snake Valley also dissipated, the dust settled, and the view cleared up.\nThough called a valley, it might as well be a giant natural karst cave.\nOr let's say, the ground in this area suddenly collapsed, forming a giant sinkhole.\nThe exit above this sinkhole is not large, but the space below is substantial, with the entire pit looking like an upside-down bowl.\nOn the surrounding stone walls, long stalactites hang down from the top, and the ground is covered with smooth stones. It's unclear whether the pit was always like this or if the ground was worn down by the snakes living here.\nInside the pit, there are many charred snake corpses, obviously the young snakes directly killed by Austin's thunderstorm, and snake eggs scattered in shady corners not far away.\nPerhaps moving the snake eggs back to the tribe would make for a fine delicacy.\nWithout staying long, Austin and his group headed straight for the depths of the pit. At this massive collapsed pit, in the distance, there was a huge and deep cave entrance leading to who knows where.\nYet, just in the depths of the pit, they could feel the continuous surge of dense Water Attribute Magic Power gushing from the depths of the cave entrance, filling the entire space.\nOnly by being inside this huge pit in the Snake Valley could Austin feel that the whole pit seemed like a fountainhead of Water Attribute Magic Power, continuously spewing magic power into the outside world.\nNo wonder the snake group chose to establish their nest in such a place, likely because a massive Water Attribute Magic Power vein opened a gap in the nearby area, making the magic power density around here significantly richer than other places.\n\"This is...\"\nNot long after entering the tunnel within the cave, Austin and the Beastmen stopped, with the Beastmen staring ahead in a daze.\nOnly to see, on both sides of the enormous passage ahead, densely packed gray snake shedding piled up, covering a large area, making one's scalp tingle just by looking.\nHowever, even the fox-faced man Quik also saw it, the plant similar to white grass growing in this dark and damp place, surviving between the gaps filled with snake sheddings.\n\"This is Snake Shedding Grass!\"\nEach time a snake grows, it needs to shed its skin, continually discarding the old outer layer and growing new scales.\nAnd when these snake sheddings absorb magic power from the air, a type of white grass-like plant grows using the sheddings as raw material, called Snake Shedding Grass.\nIn this world of extraordinary phenomena, Snake Shedding Grass has a very potent function for treatment and regeneration.\nIt's also the best-healing plant among all the herbaceous plants documented in the Fox-faced Man Quik's established medical system.\nQuik quickly moved to the side, took out a bronze dagger, and cut a wound in his palm, causing blood to flow immediately. Yet, he seemed indifferent, without any frown, and carefully picked a leaf from a piece of Snake Shedding Grass in front of him, mashed it into a paste, and applied it to the wound.\nWith the infiltration of Snake Shedding Grass juice, the newly opened wound quickly stopped bleeding.",

      "content": "\"Indeed, it's Snake Shedding Grass, and its effect is much stronger than typical Snake Shedding Grass.\"\nQuik opened his palm, and sure enough, the wound from just now had completely stopped bleeding, and the wound tingled slightly; it was estimated that it would fully heal in about half a day.\nIf in the Human World, this kind of Snake Shedding Grass would probably be top-notch material for making Healing Potions. However, there was no talent in the Dragon Nest Beastman Tribe for potion-making, so they could only use it externally like this.\n\"Not bad, this place needs proper protection to serve as a medicinal herb base in the future.\"\nAustin nodded. He had also seen the effects of the Snake Shedding Grass. With this vast area of Snake Shedding Grass, if his legion were unfortunate to get injured during battles or giant beast hunts, they would have better herbal care.\nMoreover, since Snake Shedding Grass has such vigorous regenerative life force, maybe it could serve as the main ingredient, supplemented by other herbs, to realize the method from Austin's previous life of using herbal baths to enhance the strength and physique of Beastmen.\nLooking around, the entire large area was covered with gray snake sheddings, and white Snake Shedding Grass was everywhere, so there was no worry about running out of it.\nIf they could research the method of herbal baths from the past life, it would undoubtedly enhance the strength of the Dragon Nest Legion, especially in this world where the extraordinary manifests.\nCalling over some Beastman Warriors to guard this area well, Austin and others continued their exploration.\nThe cave passage was huge, even Austin's several-meter-tall body didn't feel cramped inside. As they went deeper, passing through the large space of snake sheddings, what followed was a tunnel full of shining white bones.\nLarge white snake bones silently lay there, skeletal remains scattered everywhere, indicating this was likely a tomb-like resting place for the deceased Giant Snake colony.\nAmong the gleaming white bones grew some segmented, bone-like unknown plants whose effects were not yet known.\n\"These plants are indeed uncommon.\"\nQuik crouched in deep thought, snapping a segment of an unnamed plant, causing a crisp snap, which, if not for the leaves on the branches, one might truly mistake for a bone.\n\"It needs to be studied well to see what the effects are.\"\nThe Snake Shedding Grass, which grew among the snake sheddings, had healing and recovery properties, so these unnamed plants growing from the snake bones should have some roles as well.\nAustin nodded noncommittally.\nThis journey, regardless of the Snake Shedding Grass or these unnamed segmented plants, plus the many snake corpses obtained from annihilating the Giant Snake tribe, was already a massive gain for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nHowever, clearly, these weren't the reasons Austin originally decided to sweep through the dangerous area of the Wet Bone Forest.\nFortunately, as they went deeper, Austin could distinctly feel the increasing density of Water Attribute Magic Power in the air.\nHis goal was nearing!\n\"Here it is indeed!\"\nHaving passed the Snake Bone Tomb and through a relatively narrow passage, the scene before them suddenly brightened like turning from darkness to light.\nIn the dim space ahead, blocks of dark blue stones were embedded in the surrounding walls, flickering with faint light, and the thick Water Attribute Magic Power permeated every corner of the space.\nIn the foremost area, the soil wall had been dug into a relatively large pit, and blocks of dark blue stones were faintly visible among the soil, hidden in the earth.\nThis was clearly a vein,\na vein of dark blue unknown Magic Ore, and the output of this vein was not small.\n\"What are these ores?\"\nAustin dug out a block of dark blue ore from the soil with his claw, sniffed it, and then directly threw it into his mouth, chewing it in big bites.\nIt tasted like toasted grain, crunchy.\nThe ore was directly crushed by sharp teeth and swallowed, Austin felt a gentle magic power gradually spreading from his stomach to his body, while the remnants were also ground and absorbed by his powerful stomach.\nA decent taste, but at the same time, there was a metallic taste in his mouth.\n\"This is Water Patterned Magic Iron Ore.\"\nThe former Mercenary Deputy Captain, who had been standing at the rear, spoke, glancing at the dark blue ore with a trace of eagerness in his eyes.\n\"Water Patterned Magic Iron Ore is the main material for refining Water Pattern Iron. With Water Pattern Iron, you can create Water Attribute Extraordinary Weapons, and if Water Pattern Steel can be refined, it can even directly make Silver Level Extraordinary Weapons. A piece of Water Patterned Magic Iron Ore can be sold for at least ten silver coins, even several dozen, in any part of the Central Earth World!\"\nNo wonder the United Kingdom repeatedly banned merchants from smuggling goods to the Beastman Tribes in the Kawa Great Forest, yet every year, numerous merchants risk danger and enter what is known as the Death Barbaric Land for trade, repeatedly defying the ban, as the resources within the Kawa Great Forest are abundant to such an extent.\nCasually clearing a dangerous area can reveal a vein of such enormous value, transporting a single piece of Water Patterned Magic Iron Ore to the Human World would be worth at least ten silver coins. How many pieces of Water Patterned Magic Iron Ore were in this cave?\nAnd beneath the soil of the Wet Bone Forest, which caused the phenomenon of fog enveloping it, how many ores were buried?\nThat surely was a huge, astronomical number!\nAt that moment, Gory's heart surged uncontrollably with greed,\nbut he quickly suppressed the greed in his heart, averting his gaze from the precious Water Patterned Magic Iron Ore.\nRight now, the most important thing for himself was to gain trust and acquire the secret technique known as the Beastman Six Techniques. Although the Water Patterned Magic Iron Ore before him was valuable, he did not have the capability to transport the ores on a large scale out of the Kawa Great Forest.\n\"Water Patterned Magic Iron Ore, containing Water Attribute Magic Power?\"\nThis thought flickered through Austin's mind, no wonder the taste was good.\nIf, in the future, there were dealings with human merchants, perhaps these could be used to exchange for purchasing some supplies, especially some Extraordinary Weapons.\nBronze Weapons were already regarded as excellent by the Dragon Nest Beastman Soldiers, but recent events had shown that Rodney's Bronze Armor couldn't withstand the attacks of the Giant Snake Leader, and even the painstakingly crafted Bronze Greatsword shattered in a short time.\nIn the future, when the strength of the Beastman Junior Officers increases, the gap in Extraordinary Weapons will be apparent.\nHowever, if Water Patterned Magic Iron Ore truly had such properties, perhaps it could be given to the goblins to see if they could combine it with Bronze Weapons to craft Extraordinary Weapons.\nThese thoughts quickly flashed through Austin's mind and were then set aside.\nWhile these matters would benefit the Dragon Nest Tribe, what's most crucial now is to devour enough Water Patterned Magic Iron Ore to advance to the Gold Level!\nIn the following days, Austin made arrangements and began devouring Water Patterned Magic Iron Ore inside the Giant Snake Cave Valley until the magic power within his body reached its limit and could no longer be absorbed.\nThen, Austin fell into slumber.\nThis slumber,\nlasted nearly three months!\n....\nP.S.: I've been chatting with a few friends all night, so the third update can't be done for now,\nI'll try again tomorrow and see if I can do four updates.",

      "content": "The Bloody Border refers to the region at the junction of the Southern Countries of the Human World and the southern Kawa Great Forest of the Seta Continent.\nThis area extends for hundreds of kilometers, and for thousands of years, the beastmen within the Kawa Great Forest have been engaged in seesaw battles with human soldiers from the Southern Countries in this area. The blood shed by humans and beastmen has nearly stained every piece of land red, hence it is called the Bloody Border.\nTo resist the invasion of beastmen from the Kawa Great Forest, several duchies in the Human World's south, bordering the Bloody Border, formed an alliance, relying on cities to establish a massive defensive line within the border area. They connected these cities with walls using a large number of enslaved farmers, ultimately forming the unbreakable Bloody Great Wall.\nFrom the moment the Bloody Great Wall was established, it became the most solid barrier against the beastmen for the Southern Countries, and humans relied on the wall's defense to constantly expand towards the Kawa Great Forest.\nLandless refugees from various regions, bankrupt individuals, fallen nobles, adventurers, mercenaries, bandits, and traveling merchants selling goods continuously gathered here, amassing a vast amount of wealth by exploiting the resources within the Kawa Great Forest.\nHowever, while it is a paradise for the brave, it is also hell for the cowardly.\nThe land outside the Bloody Great Wall is not owned by any duchy of the Human World, thus it is free without legal constraints, an immeasurable territory.\nWith years of development, human footprints have even reached the outskirts of the Kawa Great Forest. Greedy human merchants have even engaged in commercial trade with some powerful beastman tribes.\nA large amount of human activity in the border area, with various commercial and exploration activities, has plunged the Bloody Border into a bizarre prosperity.\nHowever, all of this was shattered by the Beastman Tribe Alliance's attack more than half a year ago.\nSince the end of the cold winter and the beginning of the new year, the beastmen tribes within the Kawa Great Forest have migrated explosively, the border areas fell one after another, and a massive number of beastmen directly reached below the Bloody Great Wall.\nThe prosperity of the past was wiped away, and almost all adult humans were drafted to the walls to fend off beastman attacks.\nTrade routes were severed, resulting in substantial economic losses, but most importantly, following months of relentless attacks, the defending soldiers' morale has almost reached its limit, and a sense of impending doom shrouds the entire Great Wall.\nNow, various major tribes within the Kawa Great Forest have formed a Tribe Alliance, gradually gathering over five million beastmen stationed below the Bloody Great Wall. Standing on the wall and gazing out, you see an unending series of crude camps and densely packed beastmen stretching into the horizon.\nThis is an unbelievable number, representing nearly fifty percent of the beastman population within the Kawa Great Forest participating in this war.\nThis is practically an all-out war, and it's said that the entire border of the Bloody Great Wall is under siege by the beastmen.\nYet, despite such a crisis, human leaders are still embroiled in power disputes, weapon supplies are hard to come by, and some human farmers have had to carry pitchforks to the walls for defense.\nThe air reeks of a filthy stench, mingled with the bloody scent of successive battles and the foul smell of decaying corpses, as an aura of despair begins to spread among the soldiers.\nMeanwhile, in Bodun City,\nthe largest city on the Bloody Defense Line, within the City Lord's Mansion.\n\"Mr. Edward, the pressure on the defense line is very severe now. The Grand Duke can hardly get enough sleep each day, but he values your information highly and specifically sent me to find you, hoping your news will not disappoint him.\"\nA middle-aged man dressed as a butler, wearing military attire, led the dust-covered Edward and his companions into the City Lord's Mansion.\n\"Rest assured, Mr. Butler, I am well aware that Grand Duke William's concerns involve the fate of millions at the border. If I wasn't confident enough, I wouldn't have sought a meeting with the Grand Duke so lightly. This is intelligence that my companions and I risked our lives to obtain, and it will not disappoint the Grand Duke.\"\nEdward, along with a teammate, followed the butler into the City Lord's Mansion, speaking politely, without displaying any contempt despite the butler's position.\nAfter escaping from the Kawa Great Forest, not having time to plan retaliation against that Blue Dragon, the Beastman Tribe Alliance came charging in with large forces, directly attacking the Bloody Frontier.\nThis war is not like the seasonal harassment of previous years; it is a full-fledged, life-and-death struggle.\nUrgent dispatches from the Bloody Great Wall continually reached the various duchies, and Edward was also drafted into the military.\nIn the army, Edward met some good companions, reportedly from a well-known mercenary corps, now all drafted into the military. Due to his noble status, he became the officer leader of the team.\nBecause of Edward's strength, leading the team to victory again and again gained his companions' approval. Subsequently, during an order to aid other cities, the army was ambushed by beastman forces and was nearly wiped out.\nLuckily, Edward was quick-witted and instead of retreating, chose a contrarian path, stealthily heading toward the Kawa Great Forest with companions, directly attacking a beastman tribe's base camp. This avoided post-battle beastman searches and ambushes, and in a surprise attack, they destroyed a poorly prepared beastman camp.\nIn that support battle, only they and a few others managed to return.\nIt was precisely because the beastman forces had set up ambushes along the retreat route in advance, and the beaten human army, fleeing to the city, stumbled into the ambush circle, completely ensnared.\nSince that battle, the mercenaries fully committed themselves.\nBut this wasn't the end. After attacking a beastman camp, Edward discovered a hint of the beastmen's frantic actions. From an injured senior beastman left behind at the camp, he learned the reason for the Beastman Alliance's madness in attacking the Bloody Border.\nAt first, Edward was skeptical, but after continued investigation, he finally confirmed the truth of the information obtained from the beastman leader.\nBecause of this, he broke out in a cold sweat.\nMutated Evil Spirits, Undead Calamity, those are things capable of annihilating the entire human civilization!\nYet after calming down, a crazy idea emerged in his mind,\na method not only to resolve the war but also to counter the Mutated Evil Spirit and its Undead Calamity.\nAnd this is also why Edward appeared in the City Lord's Mansion, about to meet with the supreme commander of the human allied forces on the Bloody Defense Line, Grand Duke William.\n\"That's good. If you can indeed resolve this beastman war, you will be the saviors of the millions within the Bloody Border!\"\nThe butler nodded gravely, arranging for Edward and his team to remain in the lounge,\nthen entered the inner chamber to report to the Grand Duke.\n...\nps: Uh... the chapter name in the last chapter was wrong; it should have been Chapter 191. Since it can't be changed, let's leave it at that.",

      "content": "In the border areas, the winds rise and clouds gather.\nA destiny struggle concerning humans, beastmen, and mutated evil spirits is underway; the ship of fate is uncertain of its route, and an unpredictable great change is about to descend upon the battle line stretching for hundreds of miles.\nAnd Edward, who triggered this great change, is displaying his capabilities on the power arena between beastmen and humans without restraint, and regardless of the outcome, Edward's name, having caused such a great event, will surely spread far and wide.\nThe soldiers at the bottom have no idea how this change will end, and Austin, who slumbers far away in the Dragon Nest Tribe, knows nothing of it either.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn NoveI★Fire.net\nAfter nearly three months of slumber, Austin has woken up from his sleep.\nThis is Austin's second slumber, but this time, the slumber was much more urgent than the last.\nThis was not a good time to sleep, with the zombie army of mutated evil spirits in the southwest still unresolved, and the grievance with the Blood Claw Tribe at the Bloody Border unresolved; dangers could arise at any time.\nBut Austin also knew that only by further enhancing his own power could he gain enough strength to protect himself in the chaotic battles.\nOf course, he was not entirely unprepared before his slumber.\nPreviously, he had ordered the Dragon Nest Tribe to prepare for a retreat and dispatched a large number of beastman officers to the southwest to monitor the movements of the zombie army of mutated evil spirits, alerting immediately upon any change.\nThe beastmen who went to investigate the Bloody Border were also prepared, ready to wake him up immediately should any irresistible danger approach.\nFortunately, everything was peaceful, and Austin successfully entered the Gold Level.\n\"Finally entered the Gold Level...\"\nOn the cliff, Austin stretched out his wings as much as possible; the massive shadow almost covered the sky, casting a huge shadow.\nAfter nearly three months of slumber, the large amount of Water Patterned Demon Iron Ore previously consumed was completely digested, leading to a new round of growth as magic power rapidly expanded.\nNow, Austin's body has reached a height of six to seven meters, with the massive membranous wings reaching twenty meters in length, expanding over twice as much as three months ago.\nAnd perhaps due to consuming the Water Patterned Demon Iron Ore, the water elemental magic power was digested while the remaining Magic Iron Ore Elements were also absorbed by the body's scale armor, used for the body's expansive growth.\nThe dark blue scales shimmered with a metallic luster, indestructible.\nEven when struck with a Bronze Sword, the clash of sword and scales emitted a sound like the striking of metal, without leaving a white mark.\nWith Austin's current defense, even standing there allowing endless ordinary creatures to attack with swords wouldn't cause him any harm.\nOne could say, among the many beastman tribes within the Kawa Great Forest, he alone as a dragon could sweep across the armies, regardless of how many ordinary beastmen would attack, none could leave a mark, as ordinary beings had lost the significance of numbers against him.\nOf course, that excludes the beastmen who have entered the Extraordinary Domain and those wielding Extraordinary Weapons.\nAustin, relying on his exceptionally enhanced scale-armored body, can immune the weak attacks from ordinary beings but hasn't reached the level of immunity against Extraordinary Powers.\nHowever, even so, it's already impressive; it's known that when humans enter the Gold Level, although their bodies can be enhanced to some extent, without special martial techniques or using fighting qi for defense, weapons can still inflict certain damage based solely on physical defense.\nEven for Gold Level Great Warriors, a regular army could exhaust the fighting qi of a Gold Level Great Warrior to death, only a legend truly transcends worldly power.\n\"However, the power of the Giant Dragon Race's bloodline seems a bit too extraordinary.\"\nFeeling the immense power within him, Austin found it somewhat unbelievable.\nAs he entered the Gold Level, the Legendary Law hidden within his bloodline unleashed some more of its potent power, successfully awakening a new talent magic skill.\nWith a thought, instantly, the sky changed colors, and layers of dark clouds rolled in, covering the entire sky, causing heaven and earth to plunge into darkness.\nWhoa!!!\nA massive airflow was stirred up as Austin took flight into the dense dark clouds.\nIn the sky, dense dark clouds covered, and amidst the roiling clouds, lightning flashed and thunder roared, endless clouds gathering in the sky, changing the previously clear weather.\nAt this moment, Austin felt like a fish in water, with the surrounding stormy dark clouds and thunder becoming part of him.\nNever had there been a moment where Austin felt so clearly the power of wind, water, and thunder elements permeating the world around him, deploying them at will.\nIt felt like with just a thought, he could command the cloud storm covering the entire sky.\nSuper Storm!\nThis is the talent magic awakened by Austin upon entering the Gold Level, capable of summoning the power of wind, water, and thunder elements between heaven and earth, enveloping the entire sky in dense dark clouds, forming a super storm capable of destroying a city.\nThis is the fourth talent magic awakened by Austin after Electric Shock Paralysis, Thunder Strike Technique, and Electric Current Control.\nIt seems like another worthless ability.\nAt least from the perspective of the Giant Dragon Race, any adult dragon in this world would likely consider the four magics awakened by Austin; aside from the Thunder Strike Technique, barely having some power, the other talent magics are utterly useless.\nAlthough this storm is named super, capable of destroying a city, its range comparable to a Forbidden Curse, the power greatly falls short of a Forbidden Curse.\nThe so-called Forbidden Curse can take down a legend if not careful.\nBut the destructive power of Austin's Super Storm seems world-shattering; its true power only affects extraordinary professionals below the Bronze Level, while those above Silver Level can resist this Super Storm using fighting qi.\nAs for Gold Level Great Warriors and Great Mages, the fierce winds and waves stirred by the Super Storm are merely a nuisance, posing no major threat.\nThis widespread dispersal of power, a large-scale spell requiring extensive magic power to summon, in the eyes of other mages or dragons, can't even compare to a regular Thunder Strike Technique.\nHowever, that's only what others think.\nAustin, on the contrary, felt the power of this fourth talent magic was beyond conventional understanding.\nBecause this Super Storm can truly be regarded as a simplified version of a Legendary Domain!",

      "content": "Back when Austin was just a quasi-Gold level, a trace of the power of a Legendary Law unsealed by his bloodline leaked out, which was enough to affect the weather, causing the sky to be overcast with clouds, bringing sudden wind and thunder, and utilizing the thunder generated from the clouds above to enhance the power of his Talent Magic.\nHowever, the storm and thunder brought in by that trace of the Legendary Law were not controlled by Austin; they were merely the result of the leaking of a trace of the Legendary Law.\nMoreover, every time Austin went all out, the reason he could summon up weather phenomena of clouds covering the sky was simply because the climate within the Kawa Great Forest was similar to the tropical rainforest climate Austin knew in his previous life. The entire forest was full of moisture in the air with frequent heavy rain, and that trace of the Legendary Law was just a trigger, prematurely stimulating the phenomenon of clouds and rain that was going to occur naturally in the forest.\nIf in any other place, three months ago, Austin simply would not have been able to casually evoke the degree of cloud and storm generation.\nFor example, if in a desert area, when quasi-Gold level Austin appeared, that trace of the Legendary Law could not evoke the weather phenomenon of storm and wind from the heavens and earth.\nBut after reaching Gold Level and awakening his fourth Talent Magic, Austin can summon a Super Storm in any place through his Talent Magic, causing clouds and rain to cover the entire world.\nEven in the desert, bringing a large amount of rain to the dry sands, altering the local environment is not impossible.\nOf course, if this Talent Magic was only capable of making his entrance cooler, only able to change the environment of a place, Austin would not value it that much, let alone call it a simplified version of the Legendary Domain.\nThough the power of the Super Storm isn't extremely strong, what Austin values most about this Talent Magic is its ability to change the environment of a place.\nAnd, the changed environment of that place is under Austin's own control!\nThe Super Storm itself is the result of the interplay of the elements of wind, water, and thunder, and since these three elements are under Austin's control, the resulting Super Storm is also controlled by him.\nThe elements of wind, water, and thunder that make up the storm are all controlled by Austin, and the entire storm domain feels like a part of his body, even like a domain he himself has created!\n\"With this Talent Magic, I can develop a powerful attack strategy.\"\nFeeling his control over the entire Super Storm region, Austin thought to himself silently.\nAfter activating his third Talent Magic, Electric Current Control, Austin developed powerful attack modes such as the Thunder Roar Cannon and Electromagnetic Cannon using it, and these techniques played a significant role as he grew.\nHowever, Austin would not stop there.\nWhile the Thunder Roar Cannon and Electromagnetic Cannon are indeed powerful, compared to a technique Austin had conceptualized in his mind from very early on, they're still quite inferior, and it's fair to say that their power cannot be compared.\nIf he could truly develop that technique, Austin would possess an attack method comparable to a Forbidden Curse with his Gold Level power.\nThat is—Spherical Lightning!\nSpherical Lightning is a super weapon Austin read about in a science fiction novel in his previous life, its power hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands of times stronger than ordinary thunder!\nCompared to the destructive power of the intense light and heat produced by thunder, the destructive power of Spherical Lightning reaches the molecular level.\nIn the novel Austin read in his past life, Spherical Lightning had an extremely powerful offensiveness, directly invading the molecular structure of any object it touched, completely destroying and then reconstructing its original structure, a process that would instantly kill any living being, even causing a person struck by it to be turned into ashes in an instant.\nEven during the time of Austin's previous life before his reincarnation, scientists hadn't figured out the reason for the occurrence of Spherical Lightning.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ novel•ﬁre.net\nWhen Austin awakened his third Talent Magic, Thunder Control, he tried producing the legendary Spherical Lightning through the gathering of lightning.\nBut what was formed by Thunder Control was merely a ball of lightning.\nThe reason is unknown, but Thunder Liquid, although it can gather under the authority to control thunder, is just a mass of lightning shaped into a sphere, not true Spherical Lightning.\nFor when Austin revoked his authority to control thunder, the mass of lightning, forcibly shaped into a sphere, dispersed and split into streaks of electric light, it was impossible to form a stable Thunder Ball.\nIt must be known that true Spherical Lightning can stably exist in nature.\nMoreover, the \"lightning ball\" forcibly shaped had power vastly different from the Spherical Lightning depicted in novels, merely on par with ordinary lightning.\nDue to several consecutive failures, Austin gave up the idea of creating Spherical Lightning.\nBut with Austin now having awakened his fourth Talent Magic, Super Storm, he now sees hope for successfully creating Spherical Lightning.\n\"Based on the data collected by scientists in my previous life, Spherical Lightning mostly occurred during thunderstorms. Now, by stimulating a Super Storm, I could create a thunderstorm area under my control... Within the entire Super Storm region, it's all my domain; every move resonates with me. As long as Spherical Lightning successfully appears in the storm, perhaps I can use it to complete the construction of Spherical Lightning!\"\nSensing the thunderstorm area almost within his own domain, Austin's eyes burned with a fierce flame.\nOnce successful in creating Spherical Lightning and expanding its size by hundreds or thousands of times through the Super Storm region, the final vast Spherical Lightning would possess power even surpassing a Forbidden Curse!\nAs for the scientists in the previous life who didn't thoroughly research and understand Spherical Lightning, Austin remembers nothing of their various theoretical constructions of it, but that does not stop Austin from creating that immensely powerful attack method comparable to a Forbidden Curse in this world.\nBecause in this world, both material and,\nsimultaneously, idealism exist!\nThis world has the presence of idealistic power.\nMagic is idealistic, and a Giant Dragon is itself a representation of idealistic power.\nBy combining idealistic power with the materialistic science of his previous life, Austin has successfully bypassed the need to master various scientific theories, mastering the Electromagnetic Cannon that was not applied in his previous life.\nAnd this power of magical idealism is Austin's greatest confidence in his ambition to create Spherical Lightning!",

      "content": "In Austin's mind, he uses his own abilities to artificially create a thunderstorm area within nature.\nGiven that this area is under Austin's control, as soon as ball lightning appears, he can clearly perceive the principles behind its formation.\nEven if the principles are unclear, as long as he can personally witness the formation of ball lightning, Austin can use his giant dragon magic talent to create ball lightning, perfecting this terribly powerful attack technique.\nThis power, which directly invades the molecular structure and completely dismantles and reshapes the original structure, has almost touched the source level of power. Whether in power or scope, it is not inferior to the forbidden curse unleashed by legendary mages.\nPossessing an attack magic with forbidden curse level power is undoubtedly very enticing for Austin.\nHowever, now is not a good time for experimentation.\nAustin has just awakened and is currently above the Dragon Nest Tribe. If he impulsively uses the Super Storm talent magic to turn the entire area into a thunderstorm region, wouldn't he be ruining the hard-earned possessions he has accumulated?\n\"I should go down first.\"\nSuppressing the impulse within his body, Austin descends to the ground. At this moment, within the Dragon Nest Tribe, Vini and other tribal leaders are already waiting beneath the dragon's nest for Austin's appearance.\nHaving just ended his almost three-month-long slumber, Austin wakes up to test his newly acquired abilities, yet he hasn't seen the people of the Dragon Nest Tribe or knows about the tribe's current situation. It's important to remember the complicated situation the tribe was facing before his slumber.\nEven though he wants to develop new magic, it cannot be completed in an instant. The tribe's situation needs to be sorted out first.\nThe reaction of the Blood Claw Tribe within the Beastman Alliance, the degree to which the mutated evil spirits and zombie horde have spread, and the current development status of the Dragon Nest Tribe—these are all matters concerning tribal survival that need to be resolved at the earliest possible moment.\n\"Vini, did anything happen in the tribe while I was asleep?\"\nLanding in the center with a huge gust of air, Austin directly asks Vini in front.\n\"Your Highness, everything else is stable, except the southwest side brought a lot of trouble. If you hadn't woken up in these few days, we were planning to wake you directly....\"\nVini shows a trace of worry on his face, while the other Beastmen seem to be forcing themselves to keep up their spirits, looking exhausted, and Rodney is still injured.\nEvidently, while the Dragon Nest Tribe hasn't faced a life-and-death crisis during these three months, it's probably close to reaching its limit.\nKobold leader Vini leads Austin to the tribe's medical facility and begins reporting the situation of the past three months.\n\"Your Highness, after you fell asleep, the tribe decided to withdraw its forces and halt the raids on other tribes...\"\nWith Austin, Vini narrates while walking.\nDue to Austin's slumber, the Dragon Nest Tribe's combat power has decreased drastically, and coupled with previous continuous raids and annihilations, the tribe's population is gradually approaching the thirty-thousand threshold. The extreme population growth puts considerable pressure on the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nFor these reasons, the Dragon Nest Tribe has paused its external military expansion and started solidifying its foundation, focusing on internal affairs.\nA large number of captured Beastmen, after military training and transformation, have joined the tribe as members of the Dragon Nest Tribe, participating in land reclamation, hunting, fishing, mining, and copper refining work.\nFor a while, due to the massive population engaging in production, the tribe's food production capacity rapidly increased, ushering in a new round of great development for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nMeanwhile, Vini and other high-ranking members of the Dragon Nest Tribe didn't forget Austin's instructions before his slumber. They dispatched teams to seek retreat routes and monitor the Blood Claw Tribe, repeatedly embarrassed by the Dragon Nest Tribe, and the southwest's greatest threat, the mutated evil spirits' zombie horde.\nThey continuously solidified the tribe's foundation, increased the Beastmen's training intensity, manufactured a large number of bronze weapons, enhancing the combat power of Dragon Nest Beastmen to face the potentially looming war.\nInitially, everything was calm and peaceful.Latest content published on NoveI~Fire.net\nNo news came from the Blood Claw Tribe at the Bloody Border. Instead, the Tribe Alliance acknowledged Austin's replacement of the Blood Claw Tribe branch, saying that if the Dragon Nest Tribe could indeed withstand the zombie horde from the mutated evil spirits when the Tribe Alliance breaches the Bloody Great Wall, they could offer a passage position to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nBut regarding the Dragon Nest Tribe, they didn't hold it in high regard, only sending people to check every ten days or so to see if the tribe harbored any possible threats from mutated evil spirits, but didn't specifically focus on it.\nAmong Austin's other conditions, requests for weapons and manpower support seemed impossible. Even the inspection missions were brief, just a glance before leaving, with no intention of staying long-term.\nThis allowed the Dragon Nest Tribe to conceal its capability of mass-producing bronze metal weapons, preventing the Tribe Alliance from getting greedy and coveting this.\nIt also meant that when Austin really faced the zombie horde from mutated evil spirits, he would have to fight alone.\nHowever, it didn't matter much. Austin had already hinted to Vini and the others that if they couldn't win, they'd still find somewhere else to retreat and flee.\nWith no reaction from the Blood Claw Tribe, the exploration teams heading east and north also found a rough safe retreat route.\nEverything remained tranquil, with the Dragon Nest Tribe quietly developing and vigilantly preparing.\nHowever, just half a month ago, a sudden upheaval occurred in the southwest, nearly catching the Dragon Nest Tribe off guard.\n\"Due to the zombie horde swiftly invading large territories in the southwest, the migration of large amounts of wild beasts resulted in an immensely terrifying wave of beasts. Terrifying giant beasts, powerful magic beasts, and countless ordinary wild animals constantly threatened the Dragon Nest Tribe's peace. During these days of conflict, the tribe's warriors suffered heavy losses. If not for the sweeping of the Wet Bone Forest discovering the cave tunnel where Snake Shedding Grass grows, which provided sufficient healing Snake Shedding Grass, they might have faced huge trouble.\"\nVini leads Austin to the tribe's medical department, where countless rooms house dozens or hundreds of wounded.\nMost of these Dragon Nest Beastmen appear to have external injuries from wild animal bites, and each individual's expression looks extremely exhausted. Beastmen nurses come and go, applying the Snake Shedding Grass concoction to wounds to speed up recovery, while fractures and sprains are corrected with sticks.",

night.\nIn just over ten days, the mutated evil spirit's zombie army approached within a hundred miles of the Dragon Nest Tribe!\nHowever, the first round of danger the Dragon Nest Tribe is about to face isn't from the zombie army crawling out of Hell, but from the beast tide triggered by the zombie army's expansion.\nSince approaching within a hundred miles of the Dragon Nest Tribe, the mutated evil spirit's zombie army has returned to its original state, with zombies wandering leisurely outward.\nMeanwhile, according to the feedback from Beastman scouts, it seems those zombies are constructing something, collecting rocks, wood, etc., and are being controlled to transport them in a certain direction.\nThe zombie army resumed its slow pace from over two hundred miles away, but the army has occupied a large area of land, causing numerous creatures living in those places to flee in large numbers.\nThe first crisis faced by the Dragon Nest Tribe is the beast tide caused by a mass migration of wildlife.\nDuring this crisis, numerous beasts, giant beasts, and magic beasts passed one after another, and the Dragon Nest Tribe itself, being densely populated, was seen as prey by these ferocious and ravenous hunters fleeing their lost territories.\nEven though the Beastman Legion continuously launched attacks, killing group after group of beasts, the Dragon Nest Tribe still suffered constant assaults.\nOrdinary Beastman militia can't even go out for farming and production, and the tribe's production activities are greatly hindered.\nMeanwhile, in defending against beast tide attacks again and again, even though there are quite a few Beastman Transcendents stationed, and though the Dragon Nest Legion is equipped with numerous bronze weapons and armor, in such intense combat, quite a few Beastman soldiers are injured and sent to the medical division for treatment.\nFortunately, the Dragon Nest Tribe obtained a large amount of Snake Shedding Grass after the last cleanup of the Wet Bone Forest, allowing many soldiers to receive excellent treatment, needing only a period of rest to recover.\nOtherwise, just the beast tide prompted by the zombie army would have already inflicted considerable losses on the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nEven though Beastmen have a stronger constitution compared to ordinary humans, in a place like the Kawa Great Forest, injuries are still prone to infection, and once infected, without treatment, the mortality rate for Beastman warriors is as high as fifty percent.\n\"Has the mutated evil spirit's army not approached again?\"\nLooking at the numerous injured soldiers, Austin asked Vini after comforting them.\nThe beast tide faced by the Dragon Nest Tribe has basically peaked, and with Austin's awakening, the rest poses no issue.\nWhat Austin felt the most danger from was still the mutated evil spirit's zombie army that had approached within a hundred miles of the Dragon Nest Tribe!\n\"No, every day the undead wander aimlessly at the borders, while some sturdier undead constantly mine rocks, numbly transporting large rocks and wood back.\"\nRecalling the bizarre behavior of those evil spirit corpses, many Beastmen present were puzzled and confused.\nIt's quite astonishing to make lifeless corpses move again, let alone command them to engage in production and construction!\nVini's words made Austin's heart jolt, and instinctively, he recalled the pyramid he encountered when deeply venturing into that infected wasteland...\nAn unease lingered in his heart.\n\"No, I need to inspect it myself!\"\n...\nAbove the heights, Austin's large membrane wings flapped as he swiftly flew through the clouds, constantly scanning the land below that was evolving toward wasteland directions with worry in his eyes.\nOnly to see on the ground, thick green smoke rising from the earth, eroding the land, causing trees to wither, wild grass to twist madly into mutations, and the soil to rot.\nZombies dragged their decaying bodies across the wilderness, the whole world seemed to lose its vitality, like a shattered doomsday scene.\nAfter successfully entering the Gold rank, Austin's enhanced perception clearly felt beneath the earth, threads of sinister and enigmatic power spreading outward like a web network, while the green smoke rising from the ground evidently leaked from those networks of power.\n\"What the hell are these things!\"\nThree days of investigation left Austin's heart even more uneasy.\nThe land recently occupied by the zombie army is being eroded at an alarming rate by some mysterious and sinister force, as if some important aspect of the earth is being plundered by the evil controlling the zombies, transported through the underground networks toward the massive pyramid being built in the distance.\nIndeed, within the hundreds of kilometers occupied by the zombie army over the past half month, an enormous pyramid is slowly being erected.\nThe huge pyramid has already constructed a base over a hundred meters, its outline gradually emerging, as gigantic zombies continuously haul materials upward for construction.\nGazing at the looming pyramid under construction in the distance, anxiety filled Austin's gaze.\nThe web-like networks of evil power beneath the earth spread outward from the pyramid base, forming web-like patterns covering the entire land beneath.\nAnd the land eroded by the network seems to have something plundered from it, turning into desolate wasteland.\n\"It's like a virus, constantly spreading, eroding, making soil lifeless...\"\nAustin furrowed his brow, everything was too strange.\nUndead-like zombies, commanded corpses, pyramids, dead earth...\nWhat on earth is the evil spirit manipulating all these things?\nAfter pondering for a long time, Austin could think of no answer.\nBut he understood one thing.\n\"Whatever it is, we must attempt to destroy the pyramid base!\"\nBased on previous experience, Austin already knew that once the pyramid is completed, the surrounding area within a hundred miles will again become a wasteland, a paradise for zombies and undead.\nMoreover, once the pyramid is completed, countless zombie armies will launch a new assault, and then they will definitively affect the entire Dragon Nest Tribe!\n\"Let's first try if the electromagnetic cannon can resolve it.\"\nAustin gathered a considerable amount of bronze, landed far from the pyramid on a mountaintop, gazed at the pyramid base in the distance, and began activating his ability.\nCrack!!!\nLightning flashed out of nowhere, bright blue light instantly illuminated the entire mountaintop...",

      "content": "These mysterious pyramids should be the main culprit causing the corruption and erosion of the Forest Land.\nWith the pyramid at its core, mysterious dark energy traverses and spreads beneath the soil, forming a path that continuously extends outward, plundering energy substances akin to the vitality of the land, transforming it into a paradise for zombie activities.\nOnce a piece of land is completed, the zombie army will surge forth again to occupy a large territory and construct a new pyramid, eroding new land.\nAustin didn't know what those mutant evil spirits were, nor what was going on with the endless zombie creatures on the wasteland.\nBut from the current situation, once the pyramid a hundred miles away from the Dragon Nest Tribe is completed, the land the zombie creatures will next plunder will inevitably include the range of the Dragon Nest Tribe's territory.\nTo fight or to flee, Austin had yet to decide.\nHowever, fleeing without probing the gap between them, abandoning the hard-won Dragon Grass Tribe's foundation, was clearly not Austin's style.\nAt the very least, I need to test it out.\n\"Super Electromagnetic Cannon!\"\nAtop the mountain, Austin opened his mouth, and the massive membrane wings behind him unfolded like a shadow covering the sky.\nThe next moment,\nFizz!\nBolts of electricity flashed out of thin air, transforming into electric snakes that spread out, and the bronze components prepared on the ground were immediately attracted by an invisible force, floating in the air in front of him.\nUpon the peak, arcs of electric light danced wildly like longs snakes, tearing through space while dazzling blue light illuminated the entire mountain. At that moment, it seemed as if the entire mountain was shrouded by thunder and lightning.\nThe zombies below detected the rumbling from the mountain top and began swaying toward it, but halfway up the mountain, they were annihilated into ashes by the lightning in the sky.\nAs the electric light atop the mountain grew increasingly blinding, there seemed to be a terrifying power accumulating in the air.\nThe suffocating feeling was akin to a volcano, repressed for millennia, about to erupt!\nAt a certain moment,\nBoom!!!\nAn enormous pillar of dazzling yellow light burst forth, its blinding radiance engulfing everything, even dimming the very light in the sky, all the colors between heaven and earth coalescing into that single pillar of light!\nThe terrifying energy made even the air boil; that pillar of light seemed to pierce through space, bringing world-destroying energy as it roared toward the base of the pyramid being constructed.\nAustin knew well the power of a complete pyramid.\nThe first time he saw zombie figures to the southwest, during an investigation deep into the wastelands, he happened to witness a pyramid under construction, resulting in him nearly being killed by an inexplicable energy emanating from it.\nBecause of that previous experience, Austin had been cautious over the past three days, constantly probing the outer perimeter but not encountering any counterattacks from the pyramid's base.\nThis also led Austin to understand that perhaps the base of the pyramid being constructed was yet incapable of launching an attack!\nThus, Austin boldly targeted the mountain's peak, firing an electromagnetic cannon straight at the pyramid base.\nThe enormous yellow light beam seemed to instantly pierce through a vacuum, spanning over a thousand meters, poised to shatter the pyramid base being constructed.\nYet at that moment,\nThe zombie army, dense like a black ocean previously transporting materials beside the base, suddenly surged up like flowing water, in an instant enveloping the entire base. At the same time, it grew and spread at a visibly rapid pace, transforming into a massive, grotesque, and decaying fleshy tumor thousands of meters high, covering and protecting the entire base beneath it.\n\"What!!!\"\nThough it sounds lengthy, all of this happened in just a moment. The tumor formed by countless zombie creatures completely enveloped the pyramid's base, and when the light beam of the electromagnetic cannon reached it, the massive terrifying tumor split open with a gigantic mouth, displaying grim serrated teeth, black pus draining down, the black gaping maw seeming as if it swallowed all light.\nGulu!\nThe enormous maw swallowed the firing electromagnetic cannon whole, the yellow light beam abruptly vanishing.\nMoreover, simultaneously, the monstrous tumor abruptly swelled, quickly expanding like a balloon on its surface, bursting with a pop in an instant, oozing foul liquid sprayed everywhere, interspersed with rotten flesh plummeting down like rain.\n\"What... what the hell is this!?\"\nAustin stared blankly at the transformations ensuing in front of him, dumbfounded.\nNow, the area where the pyramid's base was located was already enveloped by a twisted, grotesque tumor fleshy mass towering over a thousand meters high, yet that decaying tumor mass had already been blasted away more than half, as if a huge chunk had been scooped away with a spoon.\nAnd as a large number of zombie creatures swarmed from all directions, continually merging into that massive tumor, the previously vacant spot was growing and restoring at a visibly rapid rate, restoring to one whole unit.\nOriginally zombies, and things like pyramids appearing in the Otherworld had already left Austin utterly shocked.\nAnd now, this flesh-tumor-like zombie collective protecting the pyramid's base further broke Austin's worldview entirely.\nWith his good eyesight, Austin could clearly see the composition of the grotesque tumor, and it was precisely because of this that he felt an immense shock rising within him.\nBut within the giant tumor, the disgusting, sticky mucus filled every corner, seemingly melting part of each of the zombie creatures' decayed bodies and bonding them into one entity, with some eerie white skeletons still exposed.\nIt's like each decayed zombie has become a cell, forming this horrifying, grotesque giant tumor flesh mass with disgusting mucus linking them all!\nAnd now, that giant tumor was continuously growing and restoring, completely encasing and protecting the pyramid's base within, like a real living entity.\nAustin felt chills creeping all over him,\nWhat exactly are these mysterious pyramids?!\nNot only can they devour the power of the earth, but they also control zombie creatures to protect themselves, transforming zombie creatures into a tumor-like biological collective.\nThe feeling is as if the entire pyramid is a command brain system, issuing orders to all zombie creatures nearby, and if necessary, it can gather zombie creatures to form a new amalgamated life form.\nAnd at the root of all these transformations, what sort of existence is the ultimate mutant evil spirit?\nSoon enough, the enormous tumor had squirmed and processed back into shape, and from a distance, you could still see deep within amidst the decaying mucus-covered surface, one could make out the multitude of sinister white bones like tiny white ants...",

      "content": "Tens of thousands of zombie creatures have gathered into a terrifying giant tumor over a thousand meters high, protecting the pyramid's base below. Even Austin's full-force electromagnetic cannon couldn't break through the tumor's defense.\nWatching that massive, sticky tumor constantly squirming, in no time, the large gap blown out by the previous electromagnetic cannon was completely restored.\nMeanwhile, passages slowly surfaced at the bottom, and those zombie creatures began to haul building materials through the passageways like ants. Austin realized that he no longer had the means to destroy the pyramid's base.\n\"These zombies, including that pyramid, probably don't have intelligence and can only make instinctual responses to external dangers.\"\nAfter observing for so many days, Austin had some guesses about the endless zombies and the pyramid base.\nThese zombies, along with the pyramid they're building, should be some kind of biological weapon, either plundering some life-like source from the earth or infecting it, directed by the mutated evil spirit lurking behind.\nOr rather, these zombies, and the pyramid that controls everything, are specially designed biological weapons to achieve such a purpose!\nOnce the land is eroded by the pyramid's mysterious force, it becomes wasteland, where only zombies and some cursed, twisted mutant plants can survive.\n\"Before the pyramid is truly completed or armed with attack methods, it's my only chance to stop the zombie plague from spreading!\"\nThe situation is critically severe. If the pyramid is allowed to complete and another wave of expansion erupts, the Dragon Nest Tribe will undoubtedly be within the expanding range of the zombie creature army.\nUnless they completely relocate and flee, if they become surrounded by the zombie creature army, the only outcome is total annihilation.\n\"But at this stage, the strongest single-target attacking force, the electromagnetic cannon, is of little use.\"\nGazing at the shadow where the massive tumor looms, Austin's heart sank.\nThe giant tumor not only didn't dissipate with the cessation of the attack but instead, like a fungal plant, rooted itself in the soil, enfolding the entire pyramid base.\nBut materials collected by zombie creatures still continuously enter from the holes beneath the tumor, confirming that construction of the pyramid base inside the tumor continues unabated.\nThe earlier electromagnetic cannon shot made Austin realize that his attacks hardly affected the tumor.\nAlthough one electromagnetic cannon blew away a fifth of the tumor, within ten seconds, the massive fusion of zombie creatures allowed the tumor to rapidly regrow to its previous state, while its outer slime started turning into a gel, hardening into a sticky black outer shell.\nThis eerie phenomenon reminded Austin of the words attack and evolution.\nThat tumor may not just be a collection of zombie creatures but a type of organism, one that evolves in response to attacks!\nAfter being attacked by Austin's electromagnetic cannon, that composite tumor evolved a gelatinous shell on its surface to weaken the cannon's attack.\nAt the same time, inside the tumor, the zombie creatures operating like cells of its body were merged and liquefied into a viscous mass, with bone-white ant-like skeletons densely studding the tumor's surface. One even saw gruesome scenes of half-melted skulls gaping and wriggling.\nThe tightly compressed viscous mass, like dough, made Austin's electromagnetic cannon less effective.\nThis seems like an unsolvable situation.\nThe more it is attacked, the more that grotesque tumor evolves until Austin's electromagnetic cannon has no effect whatsoever.\n\"Damn it, the electromagnetic cannon is useless. Do I really have to prepare for evacuation?\"\nThe electromagnetic cannon is Austin's most powerful attack technique at present.\nOther than the electromagnetic cannon, no matter how hard he racked his brain, Austin couldn't think of a way to resolve the tumor problem, leaving him quite upset.\nAfter years of struggles, Austin had built a substantial foundation within the Dragon Nest Territory.\nHe had established a Dragon Nest Tribe base of small city scale, nearly ten thousand acres of cultivated farmland, expanding mushroom houses, fish breeding boxes, livestock ranches, a Copper Mine Base, and, just recently, a Wet Bone Forest that had been cleared, providing the tribe with abundant Snake Shedding Grass and Water Patterned Demon Iron Ore.\nThis hard-earned land wealth cannot accompany the tribe in an evacuation, inevitably having to be abandoned, which would be a significant blow to the tribe's development.\n\"No, there's still a way!\"\nA flash of determination passed through Austin's pupils. The electromagnetic cannon is his strongest attack technique to date, but that doesn't mean it will always be so.\nAfter nearly three months of sleep, Austin awoke and activated his fourth Talent Magic, conceiving a direction for developing an ability that might reach Forbidden Curse Level.\n\"Originally, I planned to develop Spherical Lightning later, but now it appears I must accelerate the development process!\"\nOnce that attack capability rivals a Forbidden Curse is completed, possessing the power to fission and decompose at a molecular level, no matter how strong the tumor's regenerative abilities, it will perish under Spherical Lightning!\nGazing deeply at the dense horde of zombie creatures and the towering tumor in the distance, Austin turned and quickly flew away.\nThe pyramid, only having completed a hundred-meter base, would take at least two to three months to finish. During this time, Austin could complete the development of Spherical Lightning.\nThe only trouble is, cold winter is about ten days away...\nAs Austin left, neither the giant tumor nor the zombie army showed any reaction, just like the initial two or three days, allowing Austin to continually fly high for reconnaissance without any response.\nThey behaved as if specified by simple programming, unable to contemplate or retaliate, only passively defending until the pyramid's attack methods are fully constructed.\nAfter Austin's departure, there was no change in the zombie creatures; they continued collecting and transporting large amounts of building materials into the pyramid from the tunnels below the tumor.\nAnd that tumor stood quietly on the ground, motionless, like a blood-flesh-grown builder's nest construct, with zombies transporting materials in and out tirelessly.\nInside the tumor, the half-melted zombie creatures forming the tumor mass continued writhing...",

      "content": "Rumble!\nIn a boundless forest, the sky overhead was shrouded with dark clouds, rumbling thunder reverberated between heaven and earth, and the heavy black clouds pressed down on the entire sky, seemingly about to collapse.\nA torrential downpour descended from the sky, mixed with violent storms, as if the heavenly river had broken its banks, large swathes of trees were flattened by the hurricane, the entire forest land undulating like ocean waves.\nTrees, unable to withstand the dreadful hurricane and storm, were continuously battered and shattered by the fierce storm; with a crashing sound, massive branches were torn in half, and then lifted by the fierce wind, soaring into the sky and swept into the turbulence.\nOn this expanse of land, electric snakes danced across the sky, since days ago this frenzied thunderstorm had not ceased, and the once densely interwoven forest trees were now sparse and shining, as if they had encountered the wild ravages of some gigantic beast.\n\"Still not working…\"\nAbove the sky ravaged by the torrential downpour, amidst the heavy clouds, electric snakes danced wildly within the layers of clouds, shining with a piercing brilliance, transforming that entire area into something akin to a sea of lightning.\nAustin glided through the clouds, surrounded by rampant electric light that spread out, permeating the entire sky.\nAt this moment, he had his eyes tightly closed, fully perceiving the thunderstorm weather emanating around him; amidst the ferocious storm, the elements of wind, water, and thunder were all reflected in his mind, as if he were in the midst expanding his senses, enveloping the entire area of the superstorm.\nHowever, after attempting for three days and nights under the continuous thunderstorm weather, turning the forest below into a swamp, Austin still had no clue.\nFrom the beginning, Austin knew that spherical lightning with such destructive power couldn't be developed so simply; otherwise, humanity wouldn't have had to wait until 2012 for the first scientific observational record of spherical lightning in human history from his previous life.\nThe probability of spherical lightning naturally occurring in a thunderstorm area might be one in a thousand or even lower, one in ten thousand.\nAustin's confidence stemmed from the fact that within the domain range of the superstorm, the entire thunderstorm area covered by the superstorm, the meteorites combining the elements of wind, water, and thunder were within his sensing range.\nHe could even artificially alter the various environments of thunderstorm thunder, through various attempts, to achieve the principles scientists from his previous life proposed for the appearance of spherical lightning, to see if it could be successfully realized in nature.\nIn Austin's previous life, scientists proposed numerous hypotheses about the causes of spherical lightning formation, and Austin happened to be somewhat interested in this area, because he remembered some of those theories.\nFor instance, traditional theory considered spherical lightning to be a vortex-like high-temperature plasma, utilizing the centripetal force created by inner high-speed rotation balanced with external atmospheric pressure to sustain prolonged stability, or maintaining energy stability through chemical reactions among high-temperature mixed gases.\nAnd the reason these vortex-like plasmas occur is because during the occurrence of branching lightning, the air temperature in the lightning channel is very high, causing water vapor in the air to decompose into oxygen and hydrogen, and under special circumstances, the lightning channel splits into several sections. Thus, splitting the air near the lightning channel into clusters of gas containing hydrogen and oxygen, forming bead lightning, when the branching lightning stops, the temperature of spherical lightning drops, hydrogen and oxygen recombine, releasing energy during recombination, producing light while releasing energy, sometimes this energy release phenomenon is manifested through an explosion, resulting in spherical lightning.\nOr lightning striking the ground, where the intense high temperature causes the silica in the soil to evaporate and become ionized, forming spherical lightning in the special thunderstorm environment in the high sky, and so on.\nOr ordinary lightning excites macro-electrons, causing \"macro-electrons\" to be excited from lower energy levels to higher energy levels.\nThose once dormant memories deep in Austin's mind had become clearer with his slumber and growth, as the legendary bloodline within the giant dragon awakened.\nAnd through those theories, Austin had methods to attempt creating spherical lightning, which was also where his confidence lay.\nHowever, Austin underestimated the difficulty involved.\nPerhaps because his ability to control thunderstorm is not precise enough, or perhaps there are issues with the speculative theories about spherical lightning from his previous life, but at least during these three days and nights of continuous attempts, Austin had no leads, nor any signs of realizing spherical lightning.\n\"Failed! I was too confident; perhaps those theories are not wrong, it's just that my own control of thunder attributes is not perfect... or perhaps there are errors in the theories posited by scientists of my previous life; spherical lightning is more complex than imagined.\"\nWith no leads after three continuous days, Austin's mood sank accordingly.\nAfter these days of attempts, he understood that continuing would only rely on luck, on the one in a thousand, even one in ten thousand probability of spherical lightning occurring in nature.\n\"No, merely relying on the luck of spherical lightning naturally forming is too slim a hope, other methods must be contemplated!\"\nRelying solely on luck might take half a year, by then, who knows, the flowers might have already withered, by then, the wave of zombie creatures might have already swept and occupied the Dragon Nest Territory.\nWith the failure to complete the attempt at spherical lightning through scientific hypothesis theories of his previous life, he could only seek other breakthrough directions.\n\"But, what other method can evoke spherical lightning?\"\nWithin the clouds, Austin descended beneath a cliff amidst the wreckage below.\nThe sky was still shrouded in thick dark clouds, and fierce storms mixed with rain poured down, splashing onto the earth, everywhere within sight seemed to face a storm of flying sands and rocks, an apocalyptic scene.\nAustin did not dispel the superstorm caused by his talent magic, but quietly remained perched on the cliff peak, allowing the rain like a bullet shower from the sky to fall, icy raindrops splashing on his head, perhaps this might help clear his mind.\n\"Could it be, just to give up like this?\"\nIf he couldn't develop spherical lightning in time, then the giant lump of zombie organisms couldn't be breached, and once the pyramid was completed, there would be no opportunity for a counterattack, meaning the Dragon's Nest territory, painstakingly established over three years, would be completely destroyed.",

      "content": "Nowadays, the electromagnetic cannon is Austin's most powerful attack technique, but it, however, is entirely ineffective against the giant zombie flesh.\nTo destroy the giant zombie flesh made up of countless zombie creatures, we must develop more powerful attack techniques, otherwise, the rapidly regenerating zombie giant flesh will remain unaffected.\nSpherical lightning is exactly the attack technique comparable to forbidden curse level that Austin wanted to develop upon awakening from his slumber, and as his realm elevates, his bloodline soul fusion makes some vague memories of the past clearer, even recalling the scientific conjectures he once read about the formation of spherical lightning.\nHe initially thought that following those scientific theories and assumptions, combined with his own control over thunder, he should easily be able to create spherical lightning.\nBut as it turns out, he was overthinking it.\n\"Spherical lightning cannot be created in a short time, so I have to develop other thunder techniques. But what else could be more powerful than the electromagnetic cannon?\"\nIn the midst of the huge storm, Austin pondered deeply.\nWhat weapon from his past is extraordinarily powerful?\nNuclear bombs? Or maybe hydrogen bombs?\nAustin is not interested in nuclear fission bombs, but he does have some ideas about nuclear fusion hydrogen bombs.\nNuclear fusion is the process where two small-mass atomic nuclei fuse into one heavier atomic nucleus under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, releasing a large amount of energy.\nOn the surface, this seems unrelated to Austin, as he appears to lack the conditions to create that environment.\nBut Austin, who had read widely in his past life, knows that apart from using nuclear fission bomb explosions to create high-temperature and high-pressure ignition for nuclear fusion, there is another thing called a magnetic confinement device that can facilitate nuclear fusion.\nThe principle of the device is to first treat atoms to be in a plasma state, followed by magnetic field confinement to achieve controlled nuclear fusion within the device.\nAnd in this world where magic and the extraordinary are manifest, the Blue Dragon, as the master of storms and thunder, possesses the legendary bloodline inherent in controlling thunder's power, could it focus lightning strikes to make substances transition from low energy levels to high ones, forming a plasma state, thus achieving the conditions for nuclear fusion?\nTheoretically, there is a great possibility, Austin could exploit this theory to unleash nuclear fusion level attacks.\nHowever, even if Austin manages to create nuclear fusion now, he dares not use it.\nRemember, in Austin's past life, a single nuclear bomb was capable of obliterating an entire city, and according to Soviet scientists' measurements, the power of a small-yield hydrogen bomb exploding in the air surpasses Hiroshima's nuclear bomb by thousands of times.\nThis level of energy explosion, looking at Austin's current physical data, is entirely unavoidable.\nIf Austin indeed performs a nuclear fusion reaction to attack the giant zombie flesh, the energy explosion would surely eliminate the enemy along with him, such a dangerous thing is beyond his current control.\n\"The power of nuclear bombs is too great, completely uncontrollable, but aside from nuclear bombs, is there any type of weapon from the past exceeding the power of the electromagnetic cannon?\"\nAustin felt his head hurting.\nHe thought for a long time, still unable to find an answer.\n\"Then stop thinking, better to run away honestly.\"\nAustin exhaled a long sigh, once he made up his mind, despite the reluctance in his heart, he felt a massive relief.\nActually, running away isn't that big of a deal, if the foundation is lost, so be it, life is more important.\nOriginally, he developed to this level relying only on seven Kobolds, and now the Clan possesses such a significant force, there will always be a chance to rise again!\nRelieving the conflict within his heart, Austin began to appreciate the Super Storm he himself had triggered.\nWith his mind continually on edge these three days, he hadn't had the chance to carefully observe the power generated by his fourth talent magic.\nNow, with his heart released, Austin on the cliff had the time to watch it closely.\nRumble!\nBetween heaven and earth, the thunder rolled in waves, electric serpents and flames blossomed between the dark clouds, and a level twelve hurricane mixed with torrential rain poured down from the sky.\nThe sky above was within reach, the thick cloud layers rolled and roared, severely colliding and crumbling into one another.\nRumbling!\nThe violently surging clouds above the firmament sparked strong air flow collision, abruptly, a huge tornado ascended straight towards the heavens, transforming into a towering black funnel, massive trees were caught in the terrifying tornado below, uprooted from the ground, in an instant, earth and dust flew, as if the apocalypse had arrived.\n\"Not bad!\"\nLooking at the extremely dreadful tornado ravaging between heaven and earth, Austin's face grew joyful.\nPreviously, the tornado's actions before and after its formation were sensed in Austin's mind, various cloud dispersions, air pressure principles, the operation of wind attribute magic power, he was fully aware of how this tornado formed.\nWith some more experiments, it's possible to artificially create such dreadful tornadoes.\nIf it adds such level tornadoes within the domain of the super storm, even Silver Level extraordinaries might be hard-pressed to move!\n\"Interesting, the whirlwind surprisingly can swiftly rotate air currents due to air pressure differences, while reverse rotating air currents maintain the tornado's shape, truly a rare spectacle, if spherical lightning could appear, it'd be even better.\"\nAmid his joy, Austin sighed once more.\nIn a thunderstorm, the odds of tornadoes appearing are likely much like the odds of spherical lightning, yet regrettably, he has not captured the attention of the goddess of fortune.\nWhile sighing, Austin's gaze suddenly narrowed, his entire body stiffening.\n\"Rotate, rotate...\"\nHe whispered to himself, suddenly as if realizing something, a flash of insight struck his mind, stirring a storm in the ocean of thoughts.\n\"It's rotation!\"\n\"The rotation keeps the balance, also maintains the shape!\"\nNumerous memory sceneries flashed across his mind, he recalled the flash of insight when developing the Gale Wave, departed fighting qi easily dissipates in the air, but once imbued with speed, it can cut through the air, maintaining its shape briefly.\nThen what about thunder? How can thunder attribute elements gather together, maintaining their shape?\nScene after recall flashed in his memory, finally freezing Austin's memory footage on some anime technique he saw in his past life—\nThat endlessly rotating pellet!",

      "content": "When Austin awakened his third talent magic, Electric Current Control, he attempted to blend strands of thunder together to form spherical lightning.\nHowever, the thunder ball forcefully bonded together by the power of his giant dragon legendary bloodline couldn't remain stable. Once Austin withdrew his talent magic control, the thunder ball, painstakingly fused together, would collapse. Despite the huge expenditure of effort and energy, its power was even inferior to the Thunder Strike Technique with similar energy consumption, thus Austin did not pursue further research back then.\nBecause he couldn't constrain the rampant thunder elements, creating spherical lightning through immense effort couldn't maintain its shape, and at most, it could only sustain basketball-sized spheres without expanding further.\nAlthough the forcibly blended thunder ball possesses exorbitantly high voltage and intense heat, due to rampant plasma inside it, these factors would pose considerable threat but hold no practical combat value.\nAs he advanced to Gold Level, further unlocking the giant dragon bloodline, his control over thunder became more refined. Due to the unprecedented crisis the Dragon Nest Tribe faced, the development of spherical lightning was revisited.\nInitially, it seemed like achieving spherical lightning might be easy by relying on those awoken memories and relying on scientific principles proposed by scientists of the previous world.\nBut facts proved that initially, Austin overthought it a bit.\nThe destructive power at the level of molecular disintegration, even at a quantum state that obliterates objects from the material world, was way beyond his current grasp or understanding.\n\"Annihilation at the molecular domain, perhaps even erasing from the material world, such attacks closer to the material essence, how could they be casually developed?\"\nA sudden realization dawned on Austin.\nThis level of power approached the realm of divine authority, and even if he reached the legendary level, fully unlocking the power of the legendary law within him, he would never master such power.\nWhether molecular-level destruction and reconstruction or \"erasure\" from material reality, these powers had reached the root forces of the world's survival, beyond what Austin, even as a giant dragon, at merely the young dragon phase of Gold Level, could master.\nFortunately, Austin realized this not too late.\nBetween the somber heavens and earth, torrential rain poured down, mighty tornadoes soared skyward like a vast funnel sinking from above.\nSeeing the rapidly rotating yet wind-column-aligned tornado, a flash of lightning struck through his mind, and suddenly a gleam of insight surged within Austin's heart spirit.\nMotion, rotation!\nThough thunder could be forcibly blended through the giant dragon's bloodline to form basketball-sized thunder spheres, it couldn't maintain its shape due to the fierce nature of thunder elements.\nCould motion or rotation grant the capability to maintain its form?\nThe problem encountered when developing Gale Wave in Beastman Six Techniques, with fighting qi dispersal, resurfaced, and back then, Austin used rapid rotation to rend the air, achieving long-range attacks.\nNow, could he integrate the rotation feature into thunder elements to maintain the spherical shape, thereby creating spherical lightning?\nCountless memories from the previous life flashed through his mind, finally settling on an anime series.\nThat endlessly rotating ball—\nRasengan!\nCould he use the magical field formed by Rasengan to confine the thunder elements within a sphere, maintaining a shape akin to spherical lightning?\nThis thought merely flickered in his mind, then deeply engraved itself in his subconscious.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on ⓝovelFire.net\nFor the anime named Naruto, which became a memory of the 90s generation, Austin remembered vividly, and after three months of slumber, as his soul gradually fused with the giant dragon bloodline within him, those previous life memories became exceptionally clear.\nSince he could draw inspiration from One Piece's Navy Six Techniques to develop Beastman Six Techniques, could he also use the method of Rasengan from Naruto to constrain thunder elements and create spherical lightning?!\nIn that moment, memories like Chakra, nature transformations, and others surged forth, like images flitting across his vision.\n\"Chakra, magic power, thunder elements, thunder elements...\"\nAustin murmured as if losing his divine soul.\nChakra originates from the divine tree, also the amalgamation of physical and spiritual energies, capable of transforming into wind, water, lightning, earth, fire attributes.\nAnd magic? Various from Chakra yet incredibly similar in some respects.\nMagic is power generated by magic power transforming into forces like wind, fire, etc., and unlike the ninja of the Chakra system, magic casting relies heavily on spiritual power control, thus more precise than ninjutsu.\nBoth Chakra and magic, based on self-existence, create natural elements like wind, water, thunder, earth, and fire through nature transformations.\nIs it possible to develop similar magic by drawing from the Chakra ninja system?\nMoreover, in comparison to Chakra's ninjutsu, which emphasizes spiritual power control, magic evidently offers more finesse than ninjutsu—a magic developed by referencing ninjutsu might even boast greater power.\nRegarding the alteration between Chakra's and magic's strengths and weaknesses, the notion merely flashed through Austin's mind.\nHe was now more focused on Naruto's protagonist signature ninjutsu, Rasengan!\nIn Naruto, the Fourth Hokage, inspired by Tailed Beast Ball, developed Rasengan, gathering high-density Chakra in hand, circulating it irregularly, and compressing it to form a hand-sized Chakra sphere.\nCould the same technique be employed using magic power to create a magic ball?\nIn Naruto, Naruto Uzumaki, by incorporating wind attribute change into Rasengan, transformed high-density Chakra within into numerous wind attribute powers, forming an innumerable assembly of sharp wind blades, resulting in the S-Rank Spiral Shuriken.\nIf using magic power, could a magic ball similarly undergo nature transformation, converting the internal magic into thunder elements, thereby achieving spherical lightning in another aspect?",

      "content": "Even though the two systems' powers are different, and although Naruto is just a fictional anime within Austin, since the Navy Six Techniques can be magically modified into this world, there's no reason the Chakra system with similar power characteristics can't do the same.\nThe logic is understandable, and there's a great possibility of realizing this idea!\nAlthough the resulting Lightning Ball and Spherical Lightning are likely not the same, simply condensing Thunder Attribute Elements into a sphere is almost similar to the way Austin forcibly condenses lightning into a Lightning Ball through using Talent Magic.\nThis kind of Lightning Ball is far from the power described in previous science fiction novels where molecules are disassembled and reconstructed, and even matter is turned into a quantum superposition state, \"erasing\" from the material interface.\nBut if it can truly succeed, sustaining a stable Spherical Lightning and using it for attack, its power would not be inferior, at least much stronger than an Electromagnetic Cannon or the simple Thunder Strike Technique.\n\"The temperature of lightning is several times higher than the surface temperature of the sun. If the lightning can be compressed and condensed through the Rasengan method, its internal voltage and temperature would surely surpass ordinary lightning!\"\nIf the imagined Thunder Rasengan can truly be developed successfully, then the temperature generated by lightning alone would be enough to instantly crystallize sand and stone.\nAdditionally, the explosive power formed by forcibly compressing and condensing through the Rasengan, the impact formed by the extremely oppressed explosive thunder, the power unleashed is simply unimaginable.\nAt least those zombie creatures and flesh creatures would have no chance of resistance in the face of such power, whether it's the massive zombie tumor flesh or the pyramid base beneath.\nInitially thought the development had failed, but unexpectedly found a glimmer of hope.\nMany ideas flashed through the mind, and then Austin began to engage in intense development.\nThe imagined Lightning Ball needs to go through two stages of development.\nThe first stage is to control Magic Power, drawing on the Rasengan's cultivation method to construct the world's unique Magic Rasengan.\nThe second stage, on the basis of the Magic Rasengan, involves transforming a large part of the magic within the Magic Ball into lightning through the nature change of Thunder Attribute Elements to maintain the shape of the Lightning Ball.\nAfter developing the Lightning Ball, Austin might develop a Lightning Ball similar to the Choodama Rasengan Ninjutsu to better suit the current situation.\nImagine, a Lightning Ball akin to the Choodama Rasengan falling from the sky, the massive tumor creature formed by zombie creatures would instantly turn to ashes under the extreme temperature and terrifying impact of the Lightning Ball, with the surrounding soil evaporating and melting in an instant, turning into pools of glass.\nThat would be the time when Austin's technique is truly completed.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn nοvelfire.net\nOf course, that's just one possible future outcome; perhaps the Lightning Ball can only be developed to the size of a fist and cannot be expanded further. Anything is possible, and no one knows the outcome until the very end.\nWith the development plan confirmed, Austin began to engage in tense attempts.\nDue to enhanced memory, Austin clearly remembers the three development stages of the Rasengan from the previous life.\nThe first step is to gather Chakra in the palm.\nAustin is a dragon, but fortunately, he has front claws.\nBoth front claws spread open, as if holding an imaginary basketball, streams of magic surged out, condensing into a sphere between the claws.\nThe first step posed no difficulty; due to the Giant Dragon's talent, after trying about ten times, Austin found the feeling, forming a fist-sized Magic Corps between the claws, which quickly dissipated.\nThe second step is the further practice of the first stage, steadily and continuously releasing Chakra.\nTo achieve this step, the training method in the original work is to place a water balloon in hand, then release Chakra until the water inside the balloon moves randomly and bursts.\nThe world Austin is in is naturally not the modern science and extraordinary ninjutsu parallel world of Naruto. The Kawa Great Forest and the entire Seta Continent are truly in the Middle World Extraordinary World, where no balloons are available for practice.\nDespite this, the impact is not significant. The use of water-filled balloons in practice is merely to achieve the purpose of stably and continuously releasing Chakra. The water ball effect is just for observation convenience, not essential.\nIn the world of Magic, the release of magic depends largely on Spiritual Power, and as such, a mage's fine control of magic greatly surpasses that of ninjutsu.\nAlthough Austin is not a mage, his Giant Dragon Bloodline is much stronger than a mage's, born with the ability to awaken and control Talent Magic, so there's no problem in this aspect.\nThus, after attempting twenty to thirty times, Austin found the method to continuously and stably release magic and form a Magic Corps between the claws, requiring slight rotational output of magic to maintain the Magic Corps' form.\nThe second step posed no difficulties for Austin at all.\nNext is the third step,\nPrepare a rubber ball, maintain the released Chakra, and materialize it until internally and externally, it can directly destroy the rubber ball. According to Jiraiya, the toughness of the rubber ball is a hundred times that of a balloon.\nAfter completing this stage, the Rasengan can already cause damage, though it can only inflict relatively light surface harm and cannot penetrate trees.\nThe third step proved somewhat challenging for Austin, given the absence of a rubber ball.\nHowever, though there is some difficulty, it's not insurmountable.\nThe rubber ball is merely a tool for testing results in the third step of training; the main practice remains maintaining stable magic release, condensing it into a sphere, and materializing it. Also, to sustain the Magic Corps' form, the dual magic release must also maintain slight rotation.\nThe most crucial part here is materializing the magic and making it achieve some offensive power.\nDespite the advantage of Spiritual Power, Austin spent over an hour to truly materialize the Magic Ball and grant it some destructive capability, at least stripping a large piece of bark when blasted against a tree.\nHaving completed the third step, the final step is:\nConcentrating and releasing Chakra.\nThis final step is also the most challenging step in the entire Rasengan practice.\nCombining all previous attempts, converge high-density Chakra in hand, continuously releasing it, rotating compressing into a mass, condensing into essence.\nMassive Chakra compresses and rotates within a small sphere, akin to a miniature typhoon ball, generating power strong enough to penetrate trees and shatter rocks!",

      "content": "When the final step is completed, a Rasengan can be formed, which compresses high-density Chakra into a ball that spins rapidly.\nThis step is not easy, because to concentrate high-density Chakra into a ball, you must maintain high-speed rotation of the Chakra in the palm and also sustain a stable input and the speed and direction of Chakra's rotation.\nUnder such circumstances, unless you have the talent for multitasking or have a ninja familiar through years of practice, it is hard to form such a powerful technique as the Rasengan.\nIn the original story, to solve this problem, Naruto had to resort to clever methods.\nHe summoned two Shadow Clones, with the main body maintaining the stable input of Chakra, while the clones sustained the high-speed rotation and speed and direction of Chakra's rotation.\nAfter modifying the Chakra that forms the Rasengan into Magic Power in this world, there wasn't much change overall. However, compared to the destructive energy of Chakra, the Magic Power of this world appears more gentle, and with the meticulous control of Spiritual Power, Austin finds it easier to perform the Magic Rasengan.\nNonetheless, to concentrate and rotate a massive amount of Magic into a spherical shape, while simultaneously controlling three places in detail, Austin spent an entire day to develop the Magic Rasengan.\nAbove the cliff,\nAustin's two front paws loosely formed a ball, large streams of Magic Power surged from his paws. Under Spiritual Power control, a rapidly rotating white ball the size of a ping-pong ball formed, resembling a swirling water vortex.\nSwish, swish, swish...\nThe air was filled with a swishing sound like wind passing through leaves, caused by the fast flow of Magic Power in the air, where they rubbed and collided, vibrating the air to produce sound.\nNext, in the following moment,\nBuzz!\nSuddenly, the halo beside the previous white sphere intensely condensed, and the threads of Magic Power spiraling ceaselessly at the edges suddenly collapsed, forming a magic sphere with a smooth and glossy surface, like Crystal.\nA faint white glow illuminated the air, and the white ball of energy suspended motionless in the air, like a harmless white light sphere.\nYet only Austin, who controls everything, can clearly sense the kind of fierce Magic Energy gathering beneath its smooth surface.\n\"I did it!\"\nLooking at the Magic Rasengan quietly suspended before him, emitting a faint white glow, Austin felt a sense of joy rising in his heart.\nThinking back, when the spirit of youth burned within, he too hoped to shout \"Rasengan\" and then really have a Chakra energy ball appear in his palm, didn't he?\nComing to this world, unexpectedly actually being able to fulfill a regret from the past life.\n\"Go!\"\nWith thoughts, the spirit drove the Magic Rasengan to fly out.\nIn the original story, the Rasengan was just a melee technique, even when evolved to Wind Style: Rasengan Shuriken was the same until Naruto learned Immortal Mode, gaining control of natural power's Rasengan Shuriken operation before enabling remote attack.\nOnly when the Rasengan came to this world, the magic-modified Magic Rasengan has already surpassed the original Chakra-driven Rasengan.\nIn comparison with Chakra, the compatibility and affinity between spirit and Magic are quite good,\nJust like the Flame Burst Technique can perform long-range attack exploding upon hitting an object, not during its flight in the sky, where the highly concentrated Fire Attribute Energy doesn't automatically explode,\nThat is precisely because within the Flame Burst Technique contains Mental Power restrictions within the concentrated Fire Attribute Magic Power.\nAustin's Magic Rasengan works similarly, highly concentrated rapidly rotating Magic within the Rasengan internally, like Magic exists spiritual constraints, enabling him to perform remote attacks.\nThe Magic Rasengan floated lazily through the air, its speed not very fast, akin to someone walking quickly, faint white light illuminates the sky.\nBefore long,\nThat Magic Rasengan abruptly plunged into the trunk of a large tree embraced by six to seven people, suddenly emitting a muffled sound, instantly collapsing into a face-basin-sized dent, swirling wood chips rising upward.\nThe next moment,\nBang!\nWith a muffled sound, the power of the Magic Rasengan wholly exploded, the tree trunk shattered immediately, breaking a huge gap, penetrating the entire tree trunk, on flat ground like a whirlwind was stirring, using dust and fallen leaves scattering, wood chips like dust powder scattered down.\n\"This power...\"\nStaring at the tree in front still standing, yet the tree core in the middle indeed broke open a nearly one-meter diameter huge gap, allowing one to see through to the other side, Austin's pupils slightly shrank.Thɪs novel(ꜰ)ire.net\nThis level of power is far stronger than Naruto's Rasengan in the original story!\nEven though this is not unrelated to the fact that Austin infused far greater Magic Power than Naruto himself did, the affinity compatibility between Magic and spirit allows Austin to input large amounts of Magic without worrying about losing control.\nBut this kind of power indeed exceeded Austin's expectations.\nAt the moment of the Magic Rasengan's explosion, Austin clearly saw that the extremely condensed Magic didn't just disperse and explode, instead, under remaining spiritual guidance and rapid Magic traction, almost all the power was concentrated in a very small range, instantly producing immense tearing power.\nAt the moment of that tearing power's explosion, the entire tree core shredded into powder, then that force began slowly dissipating.\nAlthough the attack area of the Magic Rasengan is not large, but precisely because of this, the Magic Rasengan explodes in a limited range having much stronger tearing power and penetration!\nOne could say, this Magic Rasengan technique, killing power is even not inferior to the Thunder Roar Cannon technique he previously developed.\n\"Unfortunately, the pure Magic Rasengan's attack speed is too slow, and this little range of tearing power isn't very effective against that massive zombie creature mass,\"\nAustin thought to himself.\nHowever, this was within his expectations, what he truly planned to confront that massive zombie creature was a second-stage Rasengan formed by integrating Thunder Attribute Elements' property modification into the foundation of Magic Rasengan.\nMoreover, it seems like the Magic Rasengan isn't completely without use.\n\"Since Magic can replace Chakra to form a Magic Rasengan, what about Fighting Qi? Could it also form a Fighting Qi Rasengan?\"\nAustin's eyes suddenly lit up.",

      "content": "Nowadays, under Austin's guidance, the extraordinary beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe have transformed the Navy Six Techniques of Iron Block, Gale Foot, Shave, and Moon Step into the Beastman Four Techniques.\nAmong the Six Techniques, Paper Drawing and Finger Gun, since Paper Drawing is similar to enhancing Sixth Sense, relying on the ability to evade through anticipating the air flow changes brought by the attack, such an ability cannot be trained overnight.\nAs for the Finger Gun, when there are metal weapons available, why use a finger to poke? Therefore, in Austin's view, there isn't much necessity for developing it.\nMoreover, with the Beastman Four Techniques, the combat power is basically already formed, so Austin did not spend too much time perfecting the Beastman Six Techniques.\nHowever, now, if the Magic Power Rasengan can be transformed into a Fighting Qi Rasengan, this degree of tearing ability might replace the Finger Gun and become a powerful melee attack method within the Beastman Six Techniques!\nInstant Step/Moon Step + Fighting Qi Rasengan, getting close to the enemy in an instant, blasting them with a Rasengan ball, the powerful tearing force of the Rasengan might even be able to rip through Gold Level Fighting Qi Armor instantly!\n\"Hmm, after this matter is concluded, let's start developing the Fighting Qi Rasengan.\"\nIf the Fighting Qi Rasengan can truly be developed, it would remedy the shortcoming of a lack of strong melee attack methods for extraordinary beastmen, significantly enhancing their power.\nEspecially when the Instant Step, a rapid movement method, is combined with the Rasengan—it becomes the enemy's nightmare.\nRemembering this idea for later, Austin continued with the research.\nThe immediate priority is still to complete the thunder attribute transformation of the Magic Power Rasengan.\nThroughout the development of the Magic Power Rasengan, Austin largely referred to the anime Naruto, but in the original story, there were no Rasengan forms with thunder attributes.\nIn Naruto's original work, while it detailed Naruto's development of the Wind Style: Rasengan Shuriken process, that was solely chakra's wind attribute transformation, not thunder attribute transformation; the difference between the two is significant.\nThis means starting now, Austin can only rely on himself to complete the thunder attribute transformation of the Magic Power Rasengan.\n\"No problem, do it yourself, and you'll be well-fed!\"\nAustin had considered following Naruto's method, injecting wind attribute transformation into the Magic Power Rasengan to create a Wind Style: Rasengan Shuriken of magical power. However, magic power and chakra are not the same energy, making it impossible to replicate precisely.\nMoreover, the Wind Style: Rasengan Shuriken form's power is strong, but if faced against the thousand-meter-high, monstrous flesh conglomerate formed by tens of thousands of zombie creatures, Austin doesn't believe the Wind Style: Shuriken can be very effective.\nIf, like an electromagnetic cannon, it blasts a large chunk of the flesh mass but rapidly regenerates within seconds, such an attack is essentially ineffective.Thɪs updatᴇd by N0veI.Fiɾe.net\nThe destructiveness of wind is always much smaller compared to thunder,\nand dealing with the monstrous zombie conglomerate that forms the pyramid that erodes the Forest Land requires power that can obliterate the thousand-meter-high beast in an instant!\nAmong the elemental powers of wind, water, and thunder that Austin can master, only thunder, several times hotter than the sun's surface, has such formidable destructive power.\nOnce he set a clear goal, Austin began hectic experiments.\nThe first step to confirm is whether to condense the thunder element into a Thunder Rasengan like a Rasengan, or to first create a non-attribute Magic Power Rasengan and then inject thunder attribute magic power into it.\nThis question did not hinder Austin for long. First, in the original work, Naruto completed a non-attribute chakra Rasengan before transforming it into wind attribute power through quality change.\nSubstitute wind with thunder, and the steps are roughly similar.\nSecondly, Austin has carried out experiments respectively, showing that even though thunder, due to Austin's own Legendary Bloodline halo ability, gathers docilely to form a rapidly rotating Thunder Rasengan.\nYet, in reality, this Thunder Rasengan is not much different from the lightning ball Austin tried before; it immediately collapses as soon as he relaxes, merely simple aggregation and rotation, without the capability to maintain form or enhance power.\nTherefore, Austin chose to initially create a non-attribute Magic Power Rasengan and then gradually transform it.\nFor this path, there is no previous experience to reference, even Naruto's development of the Wind Style: Rasengan Shuriken; its attribute change is wind power, very distinct from thunder, with hardly any references.\nCompared to wind, thunder's power is stronger.\nBut with great strength comes violent and unyielding energy.\nUnlike non-attribute magic power, lightning is extremely hard to control,\neven with Austin's influence from his dragon race Legendary Bloodline and his talent magic of electric flow control, this ability is rough command rather than detailed control, making lightning impossible to be as docile as water flow.\nThe Magic Power Rasengan can condense and compress a vast amount of magic power to rapidly spin within a tiny sphere by relying on very precise balance.\nWhen turbulent lightning is suddenly integrated into densely spinning magic power, it immediately disrupts the balance leading to the rapid dissolution of the Magic Power Rasengan.\nEven with a tiny conversion of lightning, its turbulent nature can instantly damage the perfect magic power dynamic structure, leading to the explosion of the Magic Power Rasengan.\nIn successive attempts numbering dozens to hundreds, despite Austin's giant dragon physique, the thunder attribute transformation attempts of the Magic Power Rasengan left him exhausted, and the explosion's power nearly left him battered.\nBoom!!!\nInside the white light ball, a streak of blue flashed as the entire Magic Power Rasengan exploded with booming force, the powerful magic power and the whirlwind that accompanied it blew Austin back several steps, and even the surface of his hard dragon scales added another scar.\n\"No! The power of thunder is too unruly to operate within the high-precision cycle of the Magic Power Rasengan!\"\nHundreds of consecutive failures made Austin's mood a bit irritable.\nAlthough the injuries from each failed explosion weren't serious, continuous damage left him looking battered.\n\"A stabilizing agent of sorts must be added, something that makes the explosive thunder power more docile!\"\nA divine light flickered within Austin's eyes.",

      "content": "A few days later, under the planning of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe, the production personnel have basically been evacuated, and important materials have been relocated to a new site a hundred miles northeast.\nNow the whole Dragon Nest Tribe has become a militarized camp, filled entirely with combat personnel of the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nA large number of weapons and armor have been equipped on Beastman soldiers, undergoing rigorous training day and night. The neatly aligned formations look like columns of ironclad torrents.\n\"How is the situation?\"\n\"The rate of land corruption there is accelerating, and the undead creatures have started new movements. It seems they are about to begin the next round of expansion. We don't have much time left.\"\n\"...The envoy from the Tribe Alliance at the Bloody Border left yesterday. As for the support we requested, they said they would go back and ask for it.\"\n\"Damn it! They're truly treating us as abandoned pawns. What's going on at the border?\"\n\"According to reports from the scout camp, the conflict war with humans there has been stagnant for half a month, and it's unclear what they are thinking.\"\nIn the central hall, all the high-ranking Beastmen and the Beastman Officers have gathered to discuss the future decisions of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nFrom multiple perspectives, the current situation of the Dragon Nest Tribe indeed doesn't look good.\nThe undead tide to the southwest is already stirring, poised to sweep across the Kawa Great Forest like a natural disaster, and at this moment, the Dragon Nest Tribe, right in front, would inevitably suffer a direct impact.\nEven with equal numbers, or numbers ten times their own, the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion relies on their powerful battle formation group combat capability, unafraid.\nBut the undead army isn't counted in tens of thousands, but rather covers an unknown area in the southwest of the Dragon Nest Tribe, an unmanageable quantity!\nIn the shadow of this kind of undead tsunami, the Dragon Nest Legion at most is only a relatively hard rock, ultimately to be drowned by endless waters.\nJust as the Dragon Nest Tribe is about to confront the undead army in a bloody hand-to-hand battle, the Tribe Alliance, which was originally supposed to be a source of support, suddenly became indifferent, unwilling to even provide some material assistance.\nFrom the news sent back by the rat-troop scouts, something unknown has definitely changed in the war at the border, not only causing the war between the Beastman Alliance and the human Southern Countries to stop, but also making the fear of the undead army among the Beastmen disappear.\n\"Forget it, don't worry about things over there for now. His Highness has already issued an order to prepare for a counterattack in three days!\"\nThe changes between the Beastmen and humans at the border definitely contain many secrets, but the Dragon Nest Tribe no longer has the energy to pay attention to those.\n\"Finally going to act, that's great! Since those damn undead won't stay quietly in Hell, let's take their bones apart!\"\nWith Governor Vini conveying Austin's command, the entire assembly hall was filled with excitement.\nPreviously, for safety reasons, Austin expressly ordered the Beastmen not to engage with zombie creatures, causing the Dragon Nest Beastmen to keep retreating from those slow-moving undead, feeling immensely frustrated.\nAustin holds an extremely high reputation within the tribe, so the Beastmen naturally don't have any thought of blame towards Austin, but their temper with the undead isn't nearly as good.\nApart from a few sharp-minded Beastmen who can see the dangerous predicament faced by the Dragon Nest Tribe, the majority of Beastman Warriors present, and within the entire tribe, wish to slaughter those damn undead.\nDuring this period, the Dragon Nest Beastmen, already filled with rage, are eager for action.\n\"Don't be happy too soon, I understand your feelings, but you must follow orders for this operation. This action is crucial to the outcome of the war, and our opportunity is this one-time chance. No one can disobey orders and jeopardize the operation!\"\nSeeing everyone's excited expressions, Vini immediately poured cold water over them. Once everyone calmed down, he began to slowly relay Austin's war strategy.The source of this content ɪs NoveI(F)ire.net\n\"Next is His Highness's war plan....\"\nThis war against the zombie undead is Austin's first and only counterattack against the encroachments of the zombies, step by step pressing forward.\nIn this battle, either Austin can completely destroy the mysterious pyramid building that changed the environment of the earth, or he must retreat, leaving behind the legacy for which he has fought for years.\nNo matter how much importance is placed, if objectives aren't achieved, Austin won't continue to confront the sea of undead zombies hard-headedly, even if the Dragon Nest Beastmen suffer minimal losses in the battle amid the zombie undead sea.\nThe outline of this regular war strategy can be summarized with three phrases:\nFeign east attack west,\nLure the tiger from the mountain,\nHit the dragon's heart directly.\nPerhaps due to Austin firing a shot from the electromagnetic cannon, the mysterious pyramid is currently surrounded by a massive tumor lump of merged zombie undead flesh, protected under the Corpse Mountain, while the nearby region is also densely packed with zombie undead.\nAnd because the Thunder Attribute change of the Magic Power Rasengan isn't perfect, during the preparation phase, Austin must find a quiet, undisturbed place, while not too far from the towering lump of flesh.\nTherefore, the first step of the operation is to lure away the zombie undead gathered near the Corpse Mountain lump.\nFirst, from within the Dragon Nest Tribe, the high-mobility Centaur cavalry legion attacks near the pyramid, aiming to cause the maximum slaughter in the shortest time, create chaos, then swiftly retreat, leading most of the zombie undead into the distance.\nOnce a large number of zombie undead are lured away, the group charge of the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion lying in ambush on the other side will clear a region near the Corpse Mountain lump in a short time.\nSubsequently, Austin will gather power on the hilltop, releasing his developed strongest attack method at present, annihilating the lump of Corpse Mountain flesh and the mysterious pyramid causing the terrain abnormalities all at once.\nThe plan is perfect, but Austin also understands this is under the condition that everything proceeds smoothly.\nFurthermore, the biggest variable in the plan stems from himself.\nThe Thunder Attribute change of the Magic Power Rasengan has not been truly mastered, or in other words, the Thunder Attribute change of the entire Magic Power Rasengan has only been developed to half.\nUnfortunately, time waits for no one; even if developed halfway, Austin can only barely proceed.",

      "content": "The army of zombie undead waits until the mysterious pyramids are completed and the earth's environment is altered before setting out again to attack and capture, perhaps due to some suppression within the natural forest.\nAnd those mysterious pyramids corrode the previous natural land, transforming it into a suitable living environment for zombie creatures.\n\"Where exactly did those mutated evil spirits get this power from, why does it feel so alien?\"\nBelow, the Dragon Nest Beastmen troops are gradually setting up camp, densely scattered in the mountain valley canyon, using the towering mountains to block the route to prevent being discovered by the zombie army.\nAt this time, Austin looked at the surrounding mountains that had not yet been corrupted into a wasteland-like environment, and couldn't help but think silently in his heart.\nRecalling his previous combat observations with these undead zombie-like creatures, he increasingly found that these creatures were just like the real zombies in Austin's past-life movies.\nFortunately, although the number of zombie undead is large, due to speed issues, few Magic Beasts are infected, and even after infection, the Magic Power in them is drained, so they do not become more terrifying zombie leaders but are like ordinary zombie undead; hence, the strongest within the zombie undead tide are merely those infected and zombified Giant Beasts.\nMoreover, due to the transformation, the gigantic bodies of the Giant Beasts move even slower, which is undeniably good news for the cavalry of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nOtherwise, if those infected Magic Beasts also became creatures as swift as zombie dogs from Austin's past life, such swift speed would be a nightmare for Austin's current combat plan.\n\"What exactly is that mutated evil spirit up to?\"\nSince it can drive the zombies to build pyramids and consistently erode the land, there must be some purpose for the mutated evil spirit behind the scenes.\nAustin couldn't help but ponder.\nBut at this stage, the information obtained is too little, and he couldn't figure anything out.\nThe Tribe Alliance, formed by hundreds of thousands to nearly ten million Beastmen gathered at the Bloody Border, was forced there by the sweeping wave of zombie undead, suggesting how vast the area occupied and ravaged by these zombies is.\nIn the vast and endless Kawa Great Forest, the zombie undead wave Austin and his Dragon Nest Tribe face is just a small corner, and they are merely small figures accidentally swept in.\nThe true focus is likely still on the Legendary creature domains hidden somewhere in the Kawa Great Forest and the orc army at the Bloody Border.\n\"Forget it, if the sky falls, the tall ones will hold it up; for now, the most important thing is to try to destroy that pyramid first!\"\nAustin shook his head, discarding unanswerable thoughts from his mind.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs novel{f}ire.net\nIn the vast and boundless Kawa Great Forest, an area spanning tens of millions of square kilometers could already accommodate dozens of duchies if situated in the Central Earth Human World.\nAnd in this enormous area, even Beastmen are not the absolute mainstream.\nThe true ruling dominators are the powerful Magic Beasts hidden in certain Secret Realms of the forest, such as some Legendary Level Lords or some rare and powerful races. On this vast land, there are not even a few of Austin's own kin surviving.\nThose terrifying Legendary creatures are the mainstream power within the Kawa Great Forest!\nAustin has not encountered those powerful species merely because of his relatively remote location, and since birth, he stayed nearby without wandering, thus the chance of encountering them is not high.\nIf any real problem arises, those Legendary-level existences would be the first to respond.\n\"Hopefully, destroying that pyramid will be able to curb the zombie undead's attack...\"\nAfter a moment of silence, Austin descended quietly from a height to avoid leaving any traces.\nAn uneventful night passed,\nTo prevent exposure, the next day, the battle plan officially started.\nThe first to set out was a cavalry legion of five hundred, all composed of strong centaurs.\nWith the continuous development of the Dragon Nest Tribe, the population has now reached over thirty thousand, rendering it a medium-level tribe within the entire Kawa Great Forest.\nAs the Dragon Nest Tribe continuously assimilated more people, the population of various races within the tribe naturally continued to increase, with the number of centaurs gradually rising from previously a hundred or so to now over a thousand.\nThe cavalry selected from over a thousand centaurs may not all be elite, but compared to the zombie undead creatures, their mobility naturally has a significant advantage.\nThe cavalry unit first departs from the mountain valley, choosing hidden mountain paths to bypass from the fringe. When the cavalry legion reaches the other side, they will use bows and arrows to constantly shoot and lure, attracting more zombie creatures and leading them away.\nMeanwhile, the elite of the Dragon Nest Legion, resting and gathering strength here, will charge forward once most of the zombie creatures have been led away, seizing a mountain nearby in the shortest time.\nAustin will then execute his unfinished technique there.\n...\nThree hours after the cavalry legion set out,\non the other side of the Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor's decayed woods, relying on the cover of remaining withered trees, a neat and orderly centaur legion gathered here, the atmosphere stern as iron, and the aura of war permeated the air.\n\"How about it, are you scared?\"\nThe Cavalry Legion Commander, Centaur Chiron, looked at the trembling young centaur soldier ahead and asked gently.\n\"No, it's not fear, it's excitement!\"\nThe young centaur said tremblingly, his face flushed red.\n\"Very good, ambitious!\"\nChiron heavily patted the young centaur soldier's shoulder, then looked over each of the soldiers' faces, speaking loudly and clearly:\n\"I won't say much; in this battle, as the vanguard, even if we die, we must drag those undead frameworks over! For the great His Highness Austin, and for ourselves!\"\n\"All troops, charge!\"\nWith a command, the originally solemn and orderly cavalry legion charged forward, the sound of hooves on the ground rumbling in the air, turning into a black torrent that surged out of the fallen forest and rushed towards the hills packed with zombie undead.\nAs the sound of the hooves spread, in an instant, the zombie undead around the Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor were all alarmed.",

The sparse outer undead zombies were crushed to dust before they could even react to the terrifying impact.\n\"Shoot arrows!\"\nWith a loud order from Chiron, the centaurs behind him, while running at full speed, firmly gripped their bows and arrows, shooting skyward. The volley of arrows swiftly covered the sea of undead zombies below.\nWhoosh whoosh whoosh...\nUnder the large arrow rain, one zombie after another was either pierced through the body or had their heads punctured. In such expansive firing, almost every arrow struck the undead, though unless precisely hitting the head, these arrow storms did not inflict much harm on the undead.\nOf course, the purpose of the centaur legion's archery was not to annihilate the enemy but to draw the hatred of a wider range, luring more undead zombies away from the vicinity.\nWith the fall of the first wave of arrows, the centaur legion split into two columns, making a sharp turn, galloping left and right while continually nocking arrows and shooting toward the dense zombies.\nThe range of the cavalry's attacks thus widened, drawing significant attention from large groups of undead.\nRumble!\nAlthough peculiar, upon seeing these living creatures, the undead zombies instinctively charged towards the Dragon Nest cavalry.\nFrom a high vantage point, the dense sea of undead zombies suddenly surged like a mountain flood, with the black tide sweeping forward, seemingly poised to engulf all the centaur cavalry.\nAt this moment,\n\"Retreat!\"\nWith a sharp whistle, the cavalry turned and dashed back in the direction they came.\n\"Great, just like this!\"\nChiron, looking at the myriad of distracted undead behind, felt exhilarated, constantly galloping forward.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ novel⦿fire.net\nThe undead gathered beside the Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor, colossal like a flesh factory, had exceeded tens of thousands. In the face of such immense numbers, five hundred Dragon Nest cavalry were like a fist-sized stone thrown into a river, the ripples they stirred extremely limited.\nBut fortunately, they had bows and arrows. By relying on the bow's powerful range and splitting the cavalry for scouring runs, they maximized the draw of attention from the vast undead sea, successfully luring them away.\n\"Great, keep it up! Don't go too fast, keep them trailing!\"\nThe Dragon Nest beastmen cavalry led the way, followed closely behind by the overwhelming tide of undead like waves.\nAs numerous undead creatures chased, the area around the Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor gradually thinned out.\nMeanwhile, neither the Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor nor the Pyramid below showed any reaction.\nIt was only when the Dragon Nest Legion started charging that the Corpse Mountain slowly twisted, the rotting eyeballs on its massive tumor surface scanning what were to it merely ant-like centaur warriors.\nWatching the centaur legion's departure, the undead halted their pursuit, standing quietly at the original spot.\n...\nMeanwhile, on the other side, within a secretive mountain valley, a large number of elite beastman armies gathered.\nThe entire valley was filled with an intimidating aura of military preparedness, with not a single sound to be heard.\nLying on the ground were many decayed corpses, zombies that had roamed here earlier, cleaned out before any signal could be sent.\n\"Your Highness, Chiron and the others have succeeded!\"\nSoon, several figures sprang from the other side of the mountains, kneeling upon entering and reporting.\n\"Just wait a little longer...\"\nAustin's calm voice echoed through the air, his gaze already fixed in the direction of the massive Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor partially hidden under the shadow of the mountains not far off.\nThe pace of regular undead was slower than that of goblins, and even more powerful undead could not move too quickly.\nWith the speed of the centaurs, as long as Chiron wasn't overly greedy and rash, there should be no loss.\nNow it was time to wait until Chiron led the centaur cavalry to lure the undead army far enough away before making a move!\nWithin the valley, the atmosphere was noticeably tense.\nAfter half an hour, calculating that they had lured the target far enough, Austin's eyes flashed with determination as he solemnly ordered:\n\"Transmit the order, attack!\"\nWith the command, the army hiding in the valley sprang into action, over four thousand elite beastmen launching their charge like beasts out of a floodgate, rushing across the mountain and valley.\nPerhaps due to the terrain, few zombie creatures lurked in this jagged valley, with well-equipped and well-trained Dragon Nest beastmen thrusting their sharp long spears into the zombies' heads with ease.\nGroups of Dragon Nest beastmen, like killing machines, swept through unstoppably, easily eradicating all undead zombies in front of them.\nEven though additional zombies surged in from all sides, it only took the Dragon Nest beastmen a bit of time to easily wipe them out against the invincible spear wall.\nThe Dragon Nest Legion, like the cavalry, emphasized speed—swift as a flash!\nIn no time, the mighty, almost meat grinder-like Dragon Nest Legion captured the target peak near the Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor and established an impregnable defense.\nAt this moment, Austin stood upon the mountain top.",

      "content": "Under the sudden attack, the Dragon Nest Legion swept through like an autumn wind clearing away fallen leaves, the sharp long spears forming a forest that completely destroyed the zombie undead.\nAt this moment, the nearby zombie undead around the hill had been cleared by the Dragon Nest Beastmen. The dry ground was littered with rotten corpses, and the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion formed a tight and orderly formation at the foot of the hill, with long spears standing like a forest, creating an impregnable line of defense that tightly sealed off the area below.\nThe upheaval on the mountaintop also caught the attention of the Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor, and the zombie undead that were left behind without being pursued began to gather and surged toward the iron wall defense line formed by the Dragon Nest Legion.\nDespite the cavalry's earlier efforts to draw most of the zombie undead away by various means, there were still tens of thousands of them remaining near the Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor!\nTens of thousands of zombie undead charged, like a tidal wave crashing onto the defense line established by the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion. Yet, the tightly knit and solid bronze line, protected by giant copper shields, was something these scattered zombies could not penetrate.\nThose seemingly invincible zombie undead sea tactics were like eggs crashing against a stone when confronted by the Dragon Nest Legion, who were well-trained and equipped far superior to the ordinary Beastman Legion, resulting in their utter destruction and misery.\nIn an instant, the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion, standing motionless, seemed to transform into a flesh-and-blood slaughter machine, piercing through the heads of one zombie creature after another with their dense long spear forest.\n...\nJust as the Dragon Nest Legion engaged in a contact battle with the vast numbers of zombie undead at the foot of the hill and held the upper hand,\nat the top of the mountain, looking towards the huge mass of Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor in front, Austin's gaze was extremely solemn.\nThis is the only chance, this battle must destroy these things in front!\nAustin spread his wings, the large membrane wings extending in the air, casting a vast shadow over the mountaintop.\nAt this moment, he spread open his forepaws, holding them in the air as if grasping, and strands of white non-attribute magic power began to be drawn out from his body, continuously gathering in the air ahead, forming rotating streams of magic power in the air.\nThe air seemed to twist at this moment, the white magic power began to rotate, stirring the surrounding air, and forming a giant vortex several meters in diameter.\nSwish, swish, swish...\nWith the infusion of massive amounts of magic power, there came a sound like wind blowing through leaves, and in just a moment, a gigantic magical Rasengan appeared in front of Austin.\nThis magic Rasengan, compared to the first one Austin attempted, was tens to hundreds of times larger, and the significant loss of magic power made even Austin, as a giant dragon, feel a bit overwhelmed.\nBoth spiritual and physical endurance had reached a taxing level, and this was still without the completion of the Thunder Attribute transformation.\nBut there was no other way; this single strike must unleash the greatest power and destroy the opponent in one blow!\nAustin steadied himself, set aside external distractions, and focused all his heart and spirit on the massive magic Rasengan in front of him.\nWith the operation of spiritual power, the force at the core of the giant Rasengan began to rotate rapidly at an incredible speed, and the entire enormous sphere began to slowly contract, with the terrifying magical force gradually condensing inward.\nThe size of the magic Rasengan gradually shrank, the magic power increasingly condensed and compressed, with the rotating speed becoming more terrifying and the surface light growing ever more intense.\nEventually, the colossal magic Rasengan several meters in diameter shrank into a fist-sized compressed Rasengan, emitting a blinding white light, like a small sun falling into Austin's forepaws.\nBut that's not the end!\nThe next step is the most crucial and the most difficult. In previous attempts, Austin only succeeded in a regular Thunder Attribute nature transformation!\nOnly by completing that step, it could be considered a real success!\nAt this moment, Austin had set aside all other thoughts, focusing his entire spirit on the dazzling white magic Rasengan in front of him.\nWithin the center of this extremely condensed and compressed magic Rasengan, the vast amount of magic was compressed and spun to the utmost at a certain point, where a hint of blue light abruptly appeared in an instant.Fresh chapters posted on .net\nThe next moment, that blue light spread like an infection, instantly sweeping in all directions, altering the color of the entire extremely condensed and compressed magic Rasengan!\nBuzz!\nThe space seemed to ripple faintly, and then the dazzling white light emitted by the extremely compressed magic Rasengan instantly transformed into a dreamlike blue glow, the white light washed over by the bluish hue.\nBut before the blue glow could spread, it was as if swallowed by an invisible force, collapsing inward suddenly, as if even the light was absorbed and swallowed into it!\nIn the void, there appeared an indescribable dazzling blue spherical crystal.\nThat spherical, fist-sized dazzling blue crystal was so mysterious and marvelous that it seemed to become the center of the entire world as soon as it appeared, as if just one look could even swallow the divine soul!\nWith the emergence of the dazzling blue spherical crystal ahead, the whole world seemed to fall into silence, the air becoming deathly still.\nSimultaneously, the soil beneath Austin's feet collapsed under immense pressure, large chunks of earth cracking and spreading dense fissures in all directions.\nThat spherical crystal seemed to carry the weight of a thousand pounds!\n\"Success!\"\nFeeling the immense pressure coming from his body, with the imagined technique finally created, but Austin's eyes showed no joy; instead, they were even more solemn, cautiously controlling the internal balance.\nIt was far from the time to celebrate, as the compressed magic Rasengan held too much magic internally, and coupled with the Thunder Attribute transformation, the terrifying pressure hinted at was something even Austin couldn't possibly withstand head-on without being reduced to bones!\n\"Go!\"\nCarefully controlling the dazzling blue spherical crystal to fly out, it glided slowly through the air.\nThe bluish glow illuminated the sky, and at this moment, the world was silent, the oppressive force a thousand, ten thousand times stronger than before a storm, causing even those long dead, mindless zombie undead to forget to act, their decayed eyes fixed on the blue glow in the sky.\nThe dazzling blue spherical crystal wantonly cast its bluish glow in the air, leisurely flying toward the direction of the Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor, leaving a visible trail in the sky...",

However, in the next moment, it was already soaring above the Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor, giving one a sense of space-time disorder.\nGulu Gulu...\nThe thousand-meter-high Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor suddenly stirred like viscous water, with white skeletal frames inside, resembling ants from afar, making a creaking grinding sound. Massive chunks of flesh stretched upward, suddenly tearing open a menacing blood mouth several tens of meters long, stretching its body out towards the mystical and profound dazzling blue Rasengan in the sky, swallowing it whole!\nThe giant crack closed, and the Corpse Mountain Tumor began to contract, turning back into an enormous decaying tumor standing still.\nEverything seemed unchanged, as if nothing had happened.\nAs if the Thunder Attribute Compressed Rasengan painstakingly condensed by Austin had been completely devoured, failing to stir even the slightest ripple.\nThe air was filled with silence.\nBut this silence did not last long,\nGulu Gulu....\nSuddenly, the thousand-meter Corpse Mountain Tumor seated on the ground emitted loud gurgling noises as if its stomach was upset, while the entire mass of the Corpse Mountain, like a thick liquid, quivered violently, seemingly trying to burst something from within!\nStanding atop the mountain, Austin’s pupils suddenly shrank, his voice booming through the air.\n\"Be careful! All defenses up!\"\nThis was directed at all the Dragon Nest Legion, and although unknown why, all the Dragon Nest Beastmen instinctively assumed a defensive stance, raising bronze shields in front of them.\nAt a certain moment, the sound vanished between heaven and earth!\nThe massive Corpse Mountain Tumor suddenly swelled several times like a balloon, its vast shadow nearly covering the sky, seemingly inflated to its limit, on the brink of exploding in the next moment.\nEvery Dragon Nest Beastman witnessing this scene had their hearts in their throats, eyes widened.\nBut the swelling Corpse Mountain Tumor ultimately did not explode,\nbecause in the next instant, an enormous blue light sphere suddenly expanded from within the Corpse Mountain Tumor, with the flesh and blood inside disintegrating into ashes at the moment of the blue sphere’s expansion.\nIn the silent world, the giant blue light sphere erupting from the earth obliterated everything utterly clean, with the entire Corpse Mountain Tumor being consumed and vanishing upon the sudden spread of the blue light sphere, melted like ice meeting intense sunlight.\nDazzling light blossomed between heaven and earth, with the enormous light sphere resembling an inverted dome from the earth, annihilating everything it touched without a trace.\nSoundlessly and invisibly, the colossal Corpse Mountain Tumor was utterly annihilated and disappeared, leaving only that blindingly bright and concentrated light beam between heaven and earth.\n\"Damn it!\"\nThe sound was the result of air vibrations reaching the eardrum received by the nervous system.\nBut why was there no sound?\nBecause even the intangible air, upon the sudden expansion and rise of the light sphere within, was instantly obliterated by the terrifying energy!\nAustin’s pupils contracted swiftly, as an immense danger suddenly descended!\nIn that silent world, the entire world’s light dimmed at that moment, while the gigantic blue light sphere seemed to have reached its limit, with violent blue light erupting fiercely, transforming into a massive light column ascending straight into the sky!\nAs if a volcano suppressing for millions of years erupted, the terrifying thunder liquid transformed into a raging torrent of light ascending skyward, ostensibly penetrating the entire heaven and earth.\nRumble!!!\nA thunderous explosion erupted, and the long-silent sound finally spread like a sweeping wave across heaven and earth. The earth writhing like ocean waves bursting upward, with large chunks of soil cracking and being tossed aloft, under the sweeping fierce airflow rising skyward!\nThe entire ground resembled a lake thrown into a deep water bomb, with enormous cracks appearing instantaneously across the land, shaking plates, massive soil and stones ascending, heaven and earth filled with flying sand and stones. Accompanied by the strong shockwave from the next moment’s explosion, gigantic soil plates thrown into the air crumbled inch by inch under the visibly circular impact, as though the apocalypse had arrived!\nUnder the terrifying impact, even Austin almost got swept off, body involuntarily retreating a few steps, grasping tightly onto a large stone on the ground, staring intently at the tumultuous torrent light column ahead.\nRumble!!!\nAmidst the continuous violent sounds, the entire world seemed plunged into doomsday cataclysm, with that enormous thunder light column bursting forth from the suppressed ground, hurling vast amounts of thunder liquid high, piercing through the layered clouds in the sky, with surrounding convection continually exploding thunderously.\nAnd near that enormous thunder light column, the earth was burnt and melted by immense heat, turning into splashing dark red magma, while the sand and stones mixed in the strong wind falling into the light column instantly evaporated.\nThe fearsome thunder light column raged for over a minute; fortunately, it ultimately didn’t spread and unleash in all directions but instead gradually dissipated away, allowing Austin to finally release his held breath.\nHad the terrifying thunder light column from the earlier Thunder Attribute Rasengan explosion spread and exploded, the destruction would have wiped out much of the Dragon Nest Legion he painstakingly amassed, except for Austin himself, and he would have suffered severe injuries!\nNow, the ground where the Corpse Mountain once stood had sunken into a massive pit several hundred meters in diameter, with the soil and stones inside melted away, emitting a dark red glow, resembling magma flowing slowly.\nFurther out, the surrounding ground was in even more disarray, extending outward battered and torn apart, with eruptive soil resembling forcibly ripped wounds.\n\"Finally succeeded!\"\nSeeing the scene before him, Austin exhaled a long breath.\nNot only had the enormous Corpse Mountain Tumor vanished entirely, but the pyramid beneath it was also thoroughly destroyed.\nAustin clearly felt the entire world had undergone some change, yet this change was indistinct and elusive.\n\"Rodney, quickly assist the injured, and check the casualties!\"\nWithout pondering for long about what exactly changed within heaven and earth, once the raging storm slightly subsided, Austin flapped enormous wings and descended to the ground, commanding the remaining Dragon Nest Beastman warriors.\nEven though the Dragon Nest Beastmen had assumed a defensive stance, there were still considerable casualties under such terrifying impact.",

      "content": "Chapter 216: Chapter 222 Speculation\nUnder the previous bombardment, it was like an apocalyptic disaster unfolding, causing the entire ground to almost be turned upside down, with massive chunks of soil and rock rising into the air, and a terrifying shockwave sweeping all around.\nUnder such catastrophic destructive force, even Austin found it difficult to maintain the stability of his body, despite it being partly due to his own significant expenditure; still, the fearfulness of the aftermath was imaginable.\nDespite Austin and his team launching their attack from a mountain a kilometer away, the sweeping shockwave still severely injured many Beastman, leaving the entire Dragon Nest Tribe’s unit almost universally wounded.\nIf it weren’t for having quite a few Beastman Transcendent individuals in the Dragon Nest Tribe who barely managed some remedial measures amidst the sweeping shockwave, the losses of the entire Dragon Nest Legion would have been greater.\nAt this moment, the mountain where Austin had previously stood was splitting open, with several massive fissures cracking through the middle, as if it were about to collapse.\nThe ground below was also a mess; the previously tight and orderly Dragon Nest army formation was scattered under that wave of shock—either blasted away, coughing blood from shockwave impact, or swept up by fierce air currents, or smashed by giant stones and soil falling from the sky, or swallowed up by huge cracks in the ground.\nOver four thousand Dragon Nest Beastmen forces weren’t damaged by the zombie undead tide, yet they were more than half decimated by such apocalyptic scenes!\nFortunately, as rescue efforts continued, only a few unlucky Dragon Nest Beastmen died on the spot; most who couldn’t stand up were merely severely wounded.\n\"Thankfully, there are Witch Doctors in the tribe, whose healing experience is quite mature, and combined with the large amounts of Snake Shedding Grass obtained earlier in Wet Bone Forest, after a few days of recuperation, they’ll still be excellent warriors.\"\nAs one Beastman Soldier after another was rescued, Rodney, the Legion Commander who was coming and going for rescues on the desolate battlefield, also let out a sigh of relief.\nThis way, the losses of the Dragon Nest Legion weren’t as large as they seemed.\nHowever...\nLooking at the surroundings of fractured earth and then at the distance, at that massive pit slowly emanating red steam and light, Rodney felt an endless frenzy and supreme reverence for His Highness Austin, who created all this.\nNot only did he feel this way, but other Beastman Warriors felt the same; not a single Beastman harbored any other sentiments toward Austin, who caused such massive casualties—there was only infinite reverence for that supreme power!\nBefore joining the Dragon Nest Tribe, the Beastmen mingling around the Dragon Nest Tribe were basically the lowest class, living a life with no food for the next meal, hungry and cold, like grass without tomorrow.\nIt could be said that almost every Beastman was a penniless commoner, struggling on the survival line, with the greatest dream being merely to have enough food every day to fill their bellies.\nBut ever since joining the Dragon Nest Tribe, everything changed.\nThe society Austin forged in the Dragon Nest Tribe offered them a stable life, granting them the opportunity to create wealth with their own hands and obtain food. These Beastmen were straightforward, knowing clearly whoever treated them well.\nAs for Austin, both ordinary Beastmen and Extraordinary Beastmen respected him genuinely from the heart.\nRespecting the one who led them out of poverty and achieved being well-fed, respecting the one who granted them prosperity and stability, respecting the great His Highness Austin who led them to a better life.\nAnd now, the kind of world-annihilating power Austin demonstrated further instilled a fervent belief in the Beastman soldiers, engrained with the concept that strength is respected in their blood.\n\"Your Highness, under your glorious wings, all that block us shall perish, may your glory shine upon more people struggling in suffering...\"\nIn the post-war rescue efforts, a common Beastman Warrior stood amidst the desolate ground, gazing at the enormous wings rising into the sky, crossing his hands on his chest, silently and sincerely praying within his heart.\n.....\nAustin was not Divine; he naturally remained unaware of the thoughts of those Dragon Nest Beastman Warriors.\nUpon seeing Lizardman Rodney rescue most of the Beastmen soldiers, and finding nothing else left on-site, he started to rise into the air, swiftly heading toward the direction of the pit.\nDuring the previous explosion, the Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor completely vanished, with even the ground soil being melted and evaporated, forming a massive pit, and its mysterious Pyramid was naturally completely destroyed; however, Austin felt the need to see it with his own eyes to be at ease.\nWith the Corpse Mountain Pyramid’s obliteration, zombies and undead around also vanished, as if they all had perished in the previous war.\n\"What exactly is going on?\"\nIf that storm of blast alone had caused the demise of all zombie undead, that would be impossible; these undead beings, like the zombies in Austin’s imagination works from a previous life, if their brains aren’t destroyed, cannot be completely annihilated.\nBut why have all nearby zombies disappeared?\nNo, not disappeared,\nThe desolate ground bears quite a number of zombie undead, lying in disarray.\nYet they seem to have lost some sort of driving support, lying limp on the ground continuously squirming, as if they’re clockwork puppets having lost control.\nLost their desire for life, even though the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion has been scattered into tatters, barely maintaining a protective formation, those zombies still capable of moving who’ve fallen on the ground showed no movements.\nSeeing them as if they’re invisible, as if the zombie undead tide furiously assaulting the Beastman Legion wasn’t them at all.\n\"Strange...\"\nAustin, noticing this point, clearly found it odd, summing up the previous occurrences, he had a feeling.\nIt felt as if that previous Corpse Mountain or the protective Pyramid beneath was the central brain controlling the zombies’ movements, controlling these resurrected zombie undead to crazily assault living beings, recklessly seizing survival space.\n\"Too bad, couldn’t get the chance to see inside the Pyramid.\"\nAustin had a feeling that these Pyramids were not simple wooden and soil structure buildings.\nThey were very likely alive.\nLike the previous protective Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor, hiding some flesh-like structure beneath the earthy exterior.\nThe Pyramid possibly wasn’t a building but a lifeform, a zombie-like lifeform resembling the Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor.\nRooted in the ground, constantly eroding it, widespread forming some network extracting some form of power from the earth’s soil, while transforming the Forest Land into something suitable for numerous undead lifeforms to survive, controlling some actions of the zombie undead.",

      "content": "Actually, when Austin first saw the pyramid under construction, he felt that the pyramid seemed more like a living creature than a building.\nJust from a distant glance, his Sixth Sense almost felt as if there were a heartbeat inside it.\nIt seems now, this is indeed the case.\nMoreover, the role played by these mysterious pyramids is not just that of a heart, but also a brain!\nA brain commanding and controlling a massive number of zombie undead!\nThinking this through, Austin felt a chill down his spine, wondering what the entity that designed all this and hid in the shadows was planning.\nCould it really be, as the Beastman Alliance thinks, a simple mutated evil spirit?\nAustin didn't know, and these were things likely beyond his current reach.\n\"Gold Level, still a bit too weak!\"\nWith Austin's current strength, he might not be lacking, but as the Legendary Law hidden within his bloodline began to gradually awaken, it made him even clearer about what kind of realm Legendary Level really is.\nIt seems only someone Legendary could qualify to participate in such a game.\n\"Aside from this Corpse Mountain Giant Tumor creature and the pyramid, these zombie undead share quite a few similarities with zombies from fantasy works from the last life. Could it really be a Zombie Virus from an Otherworld?\"\nSuddenly, Austin's mind began to wander aimlessly.\n\"Following the trope of certain novels, perhaps some lucky individual got hold of something that could traverse the heavens, and then acquired the Zombie Virus...\"\nIn an instant, Austin had drafted a mental outline of a million-word novel.\nSpeaking of traveling to this world, I haven't read any novels for a long time, no internet, not even single-player games, and anime is even more out of the question.\nWho knows how long it will take to build a strong nation, who knows when the Dragon Nest Tribe will develop into a cultural and entertainment golden age. By then, I might also be Legendary, and then I can retire, peacefully in my nest surfing the web and playing games, how wonderful.....\nWhat seemed like nothing before, now after quitting the internet for so long, I might just be able to play a black-and-white snake game for an entire day.\nIn an instant, Austin felt an endless sigh in his heart.\nStop!\nSuddenly realizing, he cast aside those aimless thoughts and continued to focus his heart spirit back to the present.\nNo matter whether it's the hidden hand behind the scenes unleashing the Undead Calamity aiming to sweep through the Kawa Great Forest and destroy the world, or the thoughts of wanting to surf the web, play games, and read novels, it all seems too far away for the current Austin, thinking too much is useless.\nAfter reining in his wandering thoughts, the massive pit appeared before him.\nA pit hundreds of meters wide suddenly collapsed into the earth, with half-meter deep cracks spreading outwards in all directions, smoke rising, and the soil and ground appearing as though a massive wound had opened in this place.\nEspecially terrifying was the soil at the edge of the pit, having melted away under an unimaginable temperature, and as the heat dissipated, the viscous dark red magma began to cool and solidify. At the very center of the pit, the stones below had even melted into glass.\n\"Such terrifying power!\"\nLooking at the giant pit before him, Austin's expression was extremely solemn.\nThis pit before him was merely the aftermath caused by the sudden expansion eruption of a Rasengan, the material at the core must have been evaporated instantaneously by the dreadful thunder liquid explosion.\nThe temperature of ordinary thunder itself is already several times that of the sun's surface, only because the thunder appears so briefly and dissipates easily upon exposure to air, it doesn't seem as powerful as it actually is.\nYet Austin's Thunder Attribute change, extremely Compressed Rasengan when exploded, produced a ball of rapidly rotating Thunder Liquid, that horrific high-temperature and high-pressure destructive power was enough to instantly melt and vaporize even sand and stone, let alone the blood-flesh creature of Corpse Mountain Tumor.\n\"Thankfully it didn't get out of control.\"\nSeeing the dreadful power caused by his technique, Austin couldn't help but feel a moment of fright.\nIf there had been any error at the time, causing the Magic Power operation to falter, there would be nothing left of Austin, standing at the center, even before killing the enemy.\nBack when developing the Thunder Attribute transformation of the Magic Power Rasengan, Austin tried countless times but failed due to the violent nature of the thunder.\nIn the end, to allow thunder to fuse, Austin had to consider adding another Elemental Power, an element that could act as a fusion agent - Water.\nThough thunder was volatile, if it had a carrier, it would become docile, and thus Austin thought of Water.\nEven with the plan, the fusion and development process did not go smoothly, and was fraught with difficulties.\nBecause under the bombardment of thunder, water would split into hydrogen and oxygen, and even ignite due to the temperature of the thunder causing a violent secondary explosion, far more dreadful than adding only Thunder Attributes to Magic Power Rasengan.\nThis was an unsolvable problem - to calm thunder, water had to be added, but the power of thunder caused water to decompose, thereby leading to explosions.\nUltimately, to solve this problem, Austin had to add Wind...\nFinally, borrowing the scientific operation principle from his past life, Austin relied on a certain operational principle to solve this problem, ultimately forming a wind, water, and thunder elemental ratio of 1:2:7, achieving a weak internal balance in the Thunder Attribute transformation of Magic Power Rasengan.\nWith such great power, should I think of a cool and awesome name?\nAustin seriously contemplated in his heart.Newest update provided by novel_fіre.net\nSoon, he came up with an incredibly cool name.\n\"It's decided!\"\n\"Super Invincible World-Destroying Compressed Wind Water Thunder Rasengan!\"\nWhew!\nLetting out a long breath, Austin felt refreshed.\nEven though the Super Invincible World-Destroying Compressed Wind Water Thunder Rasengan is very dangerous, one wrong move and even he would be sacrificed, he wouldn't use it lightly before mastering this technique proficiently.\nBut at least he's grasped an attack with power comparable to a Forbidden Curse.\nEven a being at Legendary Level wouldn't come out unscathed from such a hit.\nThe current Austin can be considered to possess power capable of threatening Legendary Level creatures.",

By then, he might perfectly control this immensely powerful technique.\nJust the thought of wielding such strength in the future, conjuring hundreds of super invincible world-destroying compressed Rasengan made of wind, water, and thunder around him, tossing them out like free candy, turning the heavens and earth dim in an instant, a terrifying power wiping out everything, even Legendary Level experts could be gravely injured if not killed in the relentless bombardment.\nFurthermore, the Rasengan could further advance in the future, and it could be Magic Modified to allow Fighting Qi to be used as well, taught to the Extraordinary Beastmen. By then, training hundreds or thousands of Beastman Officers, each capable of forming their own Rasengan and bombarding anyone they disliked, Austin could dominate a territory, living as a local tyrant, that would truly be a blissful life.\nThe power displayed by the super invincible world-destroying compressed Rasengan of wind, water, and thunder gave Austin immense confidence. Looking at the enormous transformed land turned into glass, years of apprehension about the survival environment vanished.\n\"At least now, I possess a technique comparable to the full-force strike of a Legendary Level combatant.

I wonder if sufficient Magic Resources can be found in those dangerous areas.\"\nDwelling briefly at the crater's edge, Austin suppressed his surging feelings and prepared to leave.\nHowever, the moment he turned around, his gaze suddenly condensed, focusing on a spot in the crater's center.\n\"What's that...\"\nA wisp of smoke rose up and gradually waned, revealing at the center of the glassed and heat-radiating crater a slowly floating basketball-sized irregular crystal. With the dispersal of the smoke, it was fully revealed.\nWithin the irregular crystal, lines of light unfamiliar to him intersected slowly, like a chaotic mess kept together by a force, yet evoking a sense of smooth order. For a moment, the gentle luminance seemed to become the center of the world, absorbing all brilliance from above and below.\nWhoosh!\nAustin unfurled his vast membranous wings, creating a massive vortex, and soared toward the crater's center.\n\"What is this?\"\nStanding at the crater's center, gazing at the unknown crystalline substance before him, Austin's eyes were filled with gravity.\nDanger!\nA constant ominous warning echoed in his mind, but it wasn't the imminent danger of a blade poised at his neck. Instead, it felt like the dangerous heartbeat one gets when facing a truckload of dynamite.\nAustin instinctively sensed that this colossal crystal concealed an enormous energy!\nSo vast that should it explode, he would surely be doomed!\nFaintly, he even felt the surrounding space held a sense of being drained away.\nIt was as though the space around the crystal was repelled into void by an unseen, untouchable powerful force.\n\"Was it a by-product of the previous Rasengan explosion? No, that can't be!

Indeed, the crystal's origins likely relate to the Pyramid.\nBut why did destroying the Corpse Mountain and Pyramid yield such things?\nOr is this crystal a convergence of some power?\nHundreds of thoughts raced through his mind in an instant.\nFinally, Austin extended a claw, gently touching the crystal, and after no reaction ensued, he hesitated momentarily before grasping it in his claw.\n\"A pure energy form, and an unknown one at that.

      "content": "After defeating that mysterious pyramid structure and the undead zombie creatures, the undead zombies within a hundred miles lost much of their threat without a \"brain\" to command and empower them. They were then easily divided and exterminated by the Dragon Nest Legion.\nAlthough there were some errors in the plan, it was still relatively smooth. With the core of the nest destroyed, from now on, we only need to continually eliminate the undead zombies wandering between the mountains and forests.\nLuring, dividing, surrounding, exterminating... all these methods used on the remaining zombie undead can be considered another kind of drill, wiping out the zombies in the forests, which can train a unit into an elite army.\nIn terms of loss, the Dragon Nest Beastmen didn't suffer much in this campaign.\nMost of the injuries in the Dragon Nest Legion were caused by the shockwave from Austin's release of the three-attribute Rasengan, but thanks to the treatment with the abundant Snake Shedding Grass from the Wet Bone Forest, there are basically no major issues.\nHowever, the gains from this war were also quite meager.\nAgainst the enemy of zombie undead, the post-war gains, except for the unknown energy crystal Austin found in the remnants of the pit, were almost nothing.\nThough Austin could sense the unknown strong energy contained within the energy crystal, he also felt that if he were to rashly devour it, that terrifying energy would certainly blow him apart.\n\"Now I am a Gold Level Giant Dragon, yet the energy within this crystal is enough to blow me apart, and there's no record of such energy in the inherited memories....\"\nIn the Dragon's Nest, Austin looked at the unknown energy crystal suspended in front of him, his eyes flickering.\nIs this thing some kind of core material used to create the pyramid, or is it a crystal core formed by absorbing the earth's power?\nUpon closer inspection, he still found nothing.\nIn the end, Austin could only store it away for future consideration.\n\"The pyramid has been destroyed, and the zombies within the area it covered have been severely weakened. The Dragon Nest Legion will soon be able to clean up the remaining zombies, but... why is there still no response over there?\"\nAustin sat cross-legged on a gigantic platform, pondering silently.\nOn the day the pyramid was destroyed, to prevent other mishaps, Austin had already ordered the Beastman Legion to retreat and personally flew over a hundred kilometers to the mountains where the gray ape tribe's ruins, the first place the zombie creatures were discovered, were located, to scout the movements of those zombie creatures.\nHowever, after days of observation, there was no movement at all, and even when Austin ventured into the depths to investigate another intact pyramid, he found no anomaly.\n\"Not long ago, the undead zombies spread through the southwestern gray ape tribe ruin mountains, covering a hundred miles and began to construct pyramids and erode the earth. Something is clearly driving everything from behind the scenes, but why hasn't there been any reaction since the pyramid's destruction?\"\n\"Could it be that I'm wrong? Or is it that there really is no mastermind behind this, and all signs are just natural coincidences?\"\nAfter thinking for a while, Austin couldn't help but doubt himself.\nBut soon he denied his doubt, at least for now, according to the Beastman Alliance, the appearance of mutated evil spirits led to all this.\nThe source of all this originates from the depths of the Kawa Great Forest, from that mutated evil spirit.\n\"The Beastman Alliance's statement may not be reliable, or maybe those Great Tribe leaders leading millions of beastmen to escape and attack the border have other ideas... but there is one thing for sure, the counterattack between the Dragon Nest Tribe and the undead zombie sea is just a small wave in the grand battlefield.\"\n\"Millions of beastmen gathering at the border indicates that the rear of all the major tribes in the Beastman Alliance may have been overrun and occupied, so the areas covered by the undead zombie spread are definitely not few.\"\n\"In the vast Kawa Great Forest region, the number of living creatures is unknown. Among them, those extremely powerful races and tribes must also have those at the Legendary Realm, and the expansion of the undead zombie sea must have faced destruction by such powerful Legendary Level beings.\"\n\"The Dragon Nest Tribe is just an insignificant tip of the iceberg in that gigantic battle line, perhaps this is also why the pyramid's destruction here is not taken seriously.\"\nAustin faintly speculated that the expansion of the undead zombie sea must have encountered such devastating destruction.\nPerhaps the mutated evil spirit guiding and orchestrating all this from behind knows about the pyramid's destruction here but deemed it as something eroded into the domain of those at the Legendary Level and easily wiped out.\n\"If that's the case, then the Dragon Nest Tribe can face a period of peaceful development.\"\nAs the saying goes, when the sky falls the tall ones hold it up. The bloodline of the Giant Dragon Race makes any dragon upon adulthood reach the Legendary Level, and there absolutely are no adult wild dragons missing in the Kawa Great Forest.\nMoreover, some top creatures may not even be weaker than Giant Dragons.\nWith those unknown legendary presences holding at the top, what's there to be afraid of?\nUpon reaching Gold Level, the legendary law hidden within the Legendary Bloodline unlocked a bit more, making Austin more aware of the terror of the Legendary.\nIt's not something that can be amassed just by numbers, and even those mature pyramids would not pose any harm to Legendary creatures.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn novel·fire·net\nIt's just that... I don't know why those Legendary beings do not eliminate the undead zombie sea, and instead allow them to build pyramids, erode the earth, and transform vast forest areas, aren't they afraid that in the end, it might lead to total destruction?\nOr is there some other purpose...\nAustin pondered silently, looking at the unknown energy crystal before him, his eyes flickering.\n\"Beastman Alliance, border humans, legendary creatures... perhaps it's time to interact with the outside world, at least to gather some intelligence...\"\nSince birth, I've been sheltered in the nearby area without any external interaction, and those small tribes of hundreds living here for generations, what could they possibly know?\nTo learn more information, I must step out of the territory and engage in some communication with other powerful forces.\nAt least understand the situation outside, not remain blindfolded now when the Kawa Great Forest is facing a grand transformation of epic proportions.",

      "content": "It's time to communicate with the outside world. With my current strength, as long as I don't provoke those legendary figures, I can already ensure my own safety.\nHowever, now is not the right time.\nAfter the great war has ceased, the Dragon Nest Legion has entered a period of recuperation.\nA large amount of Snake Shedding Grass was gathered from the Snake Bone Cave in the Wet Bone Forest, crafted into potions by Beastman Witch Doctors, and applied to injured beastmen. Under excellent medical care, in just a few days, most of the Dragon Nest Legion had regained their strength.\nThe revitalized Dragon Nest Legion began clearing the land a hundred miles away, once ravaged by undead zombies, conducting thorough searches, especially in dangerous areas. With the sweep of undead zombies and the Pyramid's erosion of the earth, most dangers had already dissipated.\nThus, while eliminating undead zombies, Austin ordered the Beastman Legion to explore those areas that hadn't been fully eroded and collect some magic resources from within.\nSome hidden magic crystals and ores, deep within dangerous areas, were easily breached by the Dragon Nest Legion after most dangers had been dispersed, collected, and then transported back to the Dragon Nest Tribe's base by the buffalo team.\n\"Bone Forging Grass, Purple Crystal Flower, Gravel Gold Stone... Not bad, these are all important for the tribe.\"\nIn the plaza, as Dragon Nest Beastmen transported their spoils, Quik, the Fox-faced Man, walked through various magic materials, meticulously discerning them.\nAs the Dragon Nest Tribe expanded, numerous tribes were annexed and absorbed, and thus, some age-old secret recipes and techniques were collected, used in experiments, merged and incorporated into the Dragon Nest Tribe's medical system.\nOver the years, the Dragon Nest Tribe developed a unique Otherworld medical system.\nFor instance, Bone Forging Grass could enhance the skeletal strength of beastmen, Purple Crystal Flower, when used with certain medications in a bath, could improve the constitution of beastmen, and Gravel Gold Stone, containing considerable magic power, loved by those heavily armored magic beasts, devoured in large quantities to enhance the defense of their scale armor.\nThese pieces of knowledge were the result of continuous experiments and expansions by the Dragon Nest Tribe's medical system, and the integration of occasionally discovered secret techniques from annexed tribes.\nMany magic resources, whether for the cultivation of Fighting Qi or other physical training, had a very significant promoting effect.\nThe reason why those top large tribes could continuously produce endless strong figures was partly due to their possession of a large amount of magic resources.\n\"It's a pity, the quality of these items doesn't seem great, and quite a bit of magic power seems to have dissipated. But being able to obtain these is still not bad.\"\nPerhaps due to the Pyramid extracting some elemental energy from the earth soil, causing the Forest Land to turn into wasteland, even those magic element-rich dangerous areas experienced a mass dissolution of vitality, leading to a significant drop in the quality of magic resources buried within.\nAustin didn't care about these defective goods. Having just advanced to Gold Level, he hadn't yet metabolized a large amount of magic ore within his body, which would likely end up used on the Beastman Legion.\n\"Search a few more places, then prepare to withdraw. Cold winter will soon begin, don't let any accidents happen.\"\nQuik said to the leading Beastman Officer beside him.\nA hundred miles of land is indeed a vast area, and with the population of the Dragon Nest Legion, it's impossible to search every inch of that territory in less than two months. Therefore, there are quite a few undead zombies still wandering in the surrounding mountains and forests.\nFurthermore, the distant sky had turned as if a massive ice block was suspended above, a sign that the Water Attribute Magic Power tide was sweeping over from afar. Although half a month later than usual, the cold winter was indeed about to arrive.\nThe white Death God crossing the border, along with the wandering undead zombies between the mountains and forests, required careful consideration and avoidance.\n\"Yes.\"\nThe Beastman Officer nodded and, as if recalling something, asked:\n\"Lord Quik, what about the temporary base we established in the northeast when we prepared to withdraw? And our companions there, should we summon them back?\"\nWhile Austin was in slumber, the Dragon Nest Tribe, following Austin's orders to prepare a retreat, established a temporary base about a hundred miles northeast. Subsequently, a large number of elderly and weak Dragon Nest Beastmen, along with substantial supplies, were transferred there.\nThat was the escape route Austin had prepared in case the counterattack failed.\nNow, however, the \"hard nail\" Pyramid on the wasteland had been removed by Austin, and the remaining scattered undead zombies in the surrounding wasteland were no longer a concern, making arrangements for that temporary retreat base somewhat troublesome.\n\"Report this matter to Vini yourself, it's not within my responsibility.\"\nQuik shook his head and began ordering the Witch Doctors to select and categorize the magic materials.\nThese civil matters were indeed outside his jurisdiction. Now the most important task before him was to categorize and store these magic materials properly, and plan how to apply them to the beastman soldiers to enhance the strength of the Dragon Nest Legion.\nWith these magic resources, even an ordinary Beastman Legion could achieve a considerable leap in strength. How to utilize and allocate them was Quik's responsibility.\nSeeing Quik start leading a group of subordinate Witch Doctors to work, the Beastman Officer had no choice but to retire.\nActually, Austin already had a preliminary idea regarding that temporary retreat base.\nHe speculated that the destruction of the Pyramid might make the mastermind behind the undead calamity misjudge the strength on this side, possibly preventing the undead zombie tide from ravaging this area again.This text is hosted at .ɴet\nYet a speculation remains just that; the future might not necessarily develop in the desired direction, so it's wise to have a contingency plan.\nTo prevent unexpected occurrences, Austin had been observing the movements of the undead zombies in the fringe area recently, while the temporary retreat base in the northeast couldn't just be discarded.\nIf the mastermind behind the scenes became enraged by the Pyramid's destruction, the Dragon Nest Legion would at least have a place to withdraw to.\nAdditionally, the temporary base contained a large cache of materials. Although the buffalo had good transport capacity, shuttling back and forth like this was troublesome, and so Austin had decided to make the temporary retreat base the first branch base of the Dragon Nest Tribe. It would allow clearer control over the Dragon Nest Territory's scope and serve as an escape option for the future.\nOf course, unless absolutely necessary, Austin naturally wouldn't easily abandon this main base foundation.",

      "content": "With the destruction of the pyramid building, the remaining zombie undead pose little threat to the Dragon Nest Legion. Seizing the opportunity before the onset of the cold winter, the Dragon Nest army began a rapid sweep of those dangerous areas, harvesting a considerable amount of substandard magic power resources.\nThese magic resources, when applied to the current Dragon Nest Legion, are sufficient to achieve significant enhancement.\nJust as the Dragon Nest Legion began its final sweep and was preparing to retreat.\nAfter monitoring that there were no unusual movements from the zombie undead on the other side of the gray apes' ruins, Austin returned to the Dragon Nest Tribe to sort out the many post-war affairs.\nThe first issue was the temporary retreat base. Faced with the pressure of the zombie undead tide earlier, Austin had to prepare a fallback route for the Dragon Nest Tribe. Most of the productive beastmen and beastman militia, along with massive supplies, retreated across mountains to a base a hundred miles northeast.\nNow, with the cold winter approaching and the world soon to be locked in ice and snow, communication between the two locations would become difficult, making the immediate resolution of the temporary base's disposition essential.\n\"Now the tribe's population has surpassed thirty thousand. The area within our activity range is not enough to fully support the tribe's population growth; it's time to establish a base.\"\nUsing the temporary retreat base as the core, create the second base of the Dragon Nest Tribe, forming mutual support and protection.\nIn this way, if one side encounters a problem, the other serves as a backup preparation.\nWith the transport of wild cattle, the journey of over a hundred miles takes only two or three days, allowing exchanges between the two places and relieving the pressure on the Dragon Nest Base.\n\"This might be a beginning. With the base as the center, we can gradually establish bases in different directions, expanding in all directions, bringing vast land under control, and these base points can also provide a certain degree of mutual defense!\"\nInside the Dragon Nest, Austin's eyes lit up.\nIn this primitive area with backward productivity, even with farming, land development, and bronze tools to enhance productivity, it's still difficult for a single base to support a larger population.\nAfter years of development, a population of over thirty thousand already puts considerable pressure on the Dragon Nest Base.\nBefore the beast tide turmoil, the Dragon Nest Tribe's hunting teams had to travel tens of miles to hunt enough beasts. This round trip for the beastmen hunting team took one or two days, reducing the production efficiency of the Dragon Nest Tribe to some extent.\nIf part of the population could be dispersed to other places, the unexploited resources of new bases would be abundant, and they could absorb the surrounding tribal population, thereby significantly increasing the total population of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAfter much contemplation, Austin's mind formed a plan for the future expansion of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"Since there's a need to evacuate, the temporary base won't be able to be evacuated before the cold winter ends. It can serve as the first experimental sub-base; there's enough food stored there, so there shouldn't be any issues.\"\nIf that temporary retreat base can successfully establish itself, the expansion of Austin's subordinate clans will use it as a model, establishing tribal bases one after another, spreading like a net, occupying large tracts of land, and absorbing more beastman population.\n\"However, the defense there has issues. It consists mainly of relatively weak beastman militia, and defense structures haven't been set up. Troops should be dispatched before the cold winter to strengthen defenses against giant beast or magic beast attacks.\"\nHere in the main city, with Austin overseeing, there shouldn't be any unexpected events.\nHe successfully launched the super Rasengan with three attribute nature transformations that day. Austin's understanding of the magic power of wind, water, and thunder attributes has reached new heights, along with his advancement to the Gold Level. Unless he encounters a Legendary Level existence, there should be no danger.\nOnce he fully masters the super invincible destructive compressed wind-water-thunder Rasengan, even a Legendary entity might not be able to confront it directly.\n\"So, that's the decision.\"\nHaving decided on the general development plan for the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin called for someone to prepare to announce it.\nIn the coming cold winter season, the main focus for the Dragon Nest Tribe is to safely get through it while enhancing strength during this period, using the substandard magic power resources collected from the dangerous zones of the wasteland to improve themselves.\nAustin also plans to develop a Fighting Qi Rasengan for the beastmen to use as a supplement to the close-combat techniques in the Beastman Six Techniques. If possible, he also wants to develop a magical modification of the Navy Six Techniques' paper drawing to complete the final form of the Beastman Six Techniques.\nThe cold winter usually lasts for three months. After three months of hibernation and fully absorbing the gains from the last major war in the wasteland, the Dragon Nest Tribe's strength should see some enhancement.\nAfter the cold winter ends, the Dragon Nest Tribe will use the temporary retreat base as the core to expand outward, eliminating and integrating surrounding beastman tribes and absorbing them rapidly.\nThe plan seems very good, but...\n\"I hope there won't be any problems with those mutated evil spirits. There are indeed Legendaries in the forest, but they probably won't pay attention to this side.\"\nAustin thought contemplatively in his heart.\n\"But what exactly is going on with the Tribe Alliance? Why is there no reaction, and no envoys have arrived? How far has their war at the Bloody Border with the Southern Countries of the Central Earth World reached? Also, what about their front with the zombie undead army...?\"\nThinking of the Beastman Alliance, countless doubts arose in his heart.\nThe Beastman Alliance's envoy initially told him that the Blood Claw Tribe had established a base at the Copper Mine site to achieve a blockade and warning against the zombie undead tide, preventing them from attacking the rear during the Tribe Alliance's assault on the border.\nBut now, except for a few visits by people from the Beastman Alliance after the initial period, there's been no further appearance.\nThis change inevitably made Austin suspect some kind of shift.\n\"Unfortunately, sending a reconnaissance team over there to gather information was a bit late. In the future, attention must be paid to this area of development, or... establishing an intelligence-gathering organization within the Dragon Nest Tribe?\"\nAustin mused to himself silently, but one thing was certain: during the peaceful development of the Dragon Nest Tribe, there would definitely be a degree of support for intelligence gathering.",

      "content": "Actually, before this, Austin had already dispatched beastman scouts to the border to gather information, observing the movements of the Blood Claw Tribe to prepare the Dragon Nest Tribe in advance.\nHowever, due to time constraints, even though the Dragon Nest Beastmen infiltrated the Tribe Alliance, it was difficult to obtain high-level information. The only known fact was that the Beastman Alliance and the human border army had ceased all warfare beneath the Bloody Great Wall, with both sides in a standoff for nearly a month without any action.\nIt seemed like the human high command and the Tribe Alliance's high command had reached some sort of agreement and were in discussions.\nThe atmosphere at the Bloody Border remained tense with opposing forces facing off, though no battles had transpired.\nThe entire border had plunged into this eerie calm.\nRegarding what had transpired between the high-ranking officials, and what the future holds for the Bloody Border, the Dragon Nest Tribe's scouts couldn't get in touch with it at all. The beastman high command seemed to deliberately conceal the news, wrapping the situation in layers of mystery.\nEven the extent of the battlefield between the Beastman Alliance and the undead zombies could not be detailed. It was only known that the Tribe Alliance had recently redeployed a significant amount of forces, but the details were unknown.\nPresently, the Dragon Nest Beastman scouts had access only to low-level personnel within the Tribe Alliance, with virtually no understanding of high-level information. It would take a significant amount of time to reach the upper echelons.\n\"According to those people, the emergence of the undead zombies was merely the result of a mutated evil spirit causing a wave, but it could never be that simple. Otherwise, it would only be the pyramidal undead creatures eroding the land, turning all that they invade into wasteland. Such destructive plundering of the earth couldn't have happened without a Legendary figure stepping in to stop it, but the undead zombies still occupied an incredibly vast region, threatening and destroying the living environment for millions of beastmen, forcing them to relocate without any action being taken. Everything is definitely not that simple!\"\nRegarding the power a Legendary Level could possess, as Austin's level improved and the release of his inner bloodline increased, he increasingly felt the terror of that power.\nThe endless sea of undead zombies might have some effect on Silver and Gold Level extraordinary beings.\nBut once a Legendary figure intervened, their vast power was enough to completely crush these corrupted creatures into dust.\nWith the sea of undead zombies' erosive nature on the earth, even a Legendary Level habitat would encounter the influence of this intense plundering. However, so far, the Legendary Level creatures within the Kawa Great Forest have made no moves to eradicate the endless undead zombies, which explains a lot.\nEither the force behind these events possesses an incredibly terrifying power that even makes Legendary Level beings wary.\nOr perhaps those Legendary creatures have ulterior motives, hoping to achieve something amidst this upheaval, with certain interests making those beings indifferent to the imminent destruction of the Kawa Great Forest.\nOr perhaps a Legendary Level entity had acted, but Austin was unaware amid this vast and boundless front line...\nNumerous conjectures, coupled with the anomalies at the Bloody Border, have made everything feel enveloped in a shroud of mystery.\n\"Forget it, no matter what schemes are afoot, the most important thing now is to lay a solid foundation, vigorously develop one's power, and possess enough strength to protect oneself amidst the unknown upheaval.\"\n\"The intelligence agency cannot fall behind. We need to assign people for special construction to prevent such blind situations in the future.\"\nAfter organizing various clues in his mind for a long time, Austin, sitting cross-legged on a high platform, had an inexplicable gleam in his eyes.\n\"The Kawa Great Forest...not simple at all...\"\nThe suspected lake reservoir transformed from an impact crater beside the Dragon Nest, those unknown magic artifacts, scattered miscellaneous remnants within the Beastman Tribe—all elements that should not appear in this Barbaric Land—all indicated that the Kawa Great Forest was not as simple as it seemed on the surface.\nThere was that Gold Level Great Mage, as well as Edward's mercenaries following in the teacher's footsteps—they all seemed to be searching for something.\nThe Kawa Great Forest harbors some secrets.\nAustin himself had once sensed a miraculous and indescribable power in the world beneath the lake reservoir.\nOriginally, he planned to dive in for investigation once he reached the Gold Level.\nHowever, with the current situation the Dragon Nest Tribe faced, he needed to preserve his complete combat power. The place beneath the lake reservoir could only be explored once the situation stabilized.\nNext, the Dragon Nest Tribe would focus entirely on preparing post-war arrangements and getting ready for the impending cold winter.\nAnd with each command issued by Austin, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe began to move, executing his plan—distributing forces, transporting supplies, fortifying positions, striving to complete the temporary bases before the cold winter arrived, and also initiating training for intelligence agents.\n...\nJust as the Dragon Nest Tribe started engaging in post-war organization, within a secluded mountain canyon in the Bloody Border Region.\nA massive waterfall descended from the sky, with thousands of tons of river water crashing down from a thousand-meter-high cliff, resembling a heavenly river pouring down. Its formidable power even suppressed the air, producing colossal rumbling sounds akin to ten-thousand-thunder rolling.\nAt this moment, beneath the waterfall.\nA towering figure stood at the gorge's mouth amidst the crashing white waves, standing firm under the unknown thousands of tons of pressure, issuing an earth-shattering roar.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nWithin the gigantic roar, the air seemed to tremble as a surge of invisible energy suddenly exploded from that massive body, causing white water splashes to splatter in all directions, accompanied by a shockwave visible to the naked eye sweeping out.\nIn the next instant, the figure clenched its fists, and with immense palms like millstones raised towards the sky.\n\"Ooh la la la!!!!\"\nTwo iron-like crimson arms punched repeatedly towards the descending majestic waterfall, striking faster and faster, until only afterimages could be seen. Each strike released Fighting Qi, piercing through the massive water flow, rolling upwards into the sky!\nOne punch, two punches, three punches... the colossal water flow and spray were shattered by the frightening Fighting Qi, ultimately forming a vacuum area tens of meters high at the top. The countless tons of turbulent water flow were also smashed into fragments by the terrifying power!\nAs the figure used human strength to contend against the majestic force of nature, a nearby procession, led by a figure exuding an awful aura of majesty, approached slowly,\nA flag fluttering in the wind beside them bore the imprint of a huge, menacing blood claw, seemingly tearing through the sky.",

      "content": "On an unknown beast skin, the giant Blood Claw banner fluttered in the wind, symbolizing the Blood Claw Tribe.\nThe Blood Claw Tribe, one of the few top tribes on the outskirts of the Kawa Great Forest, with a population of hundreds of thousands, could rival some of the weaker duchies in the Human World.\nAmong this massive population, the number of Extraordinary Professionals continuously emerges, from Bronze, Silver to even Gold, these strong individuals are numerous. The powerful Lord of the Blood Claw Tribe has even cultivated a Bronze Level elite beastman guard of over a thousand members, making the overall strength of the tribe fearsome.\nThere are several such powerful beastman forces at the frontier.\nIf these powerful beastman tribal forces were placed in an equally powerful realm of the Human World, with the population area they control, they already have the qualifications to become a duchy.\nAt this time, a multitude of beastman tribes gathered at the frontier began to form an alliance to face the threat of the Undead Calamity from behind, which was the result of deliberations among the Blood Claw and several other powerful tribes.\nThe alliance of several large tribes almost controlled the whole alliance's voice.\nThe powerful Lord of the Blood Claw Tribe was one of the leaders of this alliance, with several high-level leaders deciding the future strategies and direction of the Tribe Alliance's war.\n\"Gross, your strength has become even stronger. You indeed live up to being the bravest warrior within my Blood Claw; your bravery is worthy of all beastman admiration.\"\nOn the mountains, looking at the figure under the waterfall bearing the terrible pressure, breaking the cloth, Rulga, the strategist of the Blood Claw Tribe, considered the most cunning, cruel, and terrifying in the eyes of humans, slowly spoke.\n\"Roar!\"\nPerceiving someone coming from behind, that massive and robust figure suddenly threw a punch, and the mighty Fighting Qi burst forth, the visible airwaves reversed the descending thousands of tons of water skyward, while that figure stamped a foot on the ground, shattering the rocks that remained hard after countless time's erosion, and the entire person shot up, crashing down beside Rulga like a meteor bomb.\nThe earth shattered under this mighty force, and the airflow mixed with dust swept open.\n\"Rulga, what are you here for, plotting some scheme again?\"\nGross stood on the shattered ground, his sturdy muscles like wrought fine steel, bulging in ridges, his Fighting Qi released, and his dark gold fur dried instantly, his huge body resembling refined gold, stuffed with terrible, indestructible power beneath the taut muscles.\nGross shot a cold glance at Rulga, evaporating the water on his body, speaking in a muffled, deep voice.\nFor this person before him, Gross had mixed feelings.\nOn one hand, the Blood Claw Tribe's ability to grow to its current state owed much to Rulga's schemes.\nBut simultaneously, this guy never considered tribe members as companions, sacrificing thousands of lives to achieve a certain goal was not worth a mention. Before this, Gross had fallen victim to one of his schemes, evidenced by the huge, hideous scar across his chest.\nBeing recognized as the Blood Claw Tribe's foremost warrior, Gross, like most beastmen, had no fondness for calculations, which doomed his relationship with Rulga to be less than favorable.\n\"Gross, no need to look at me like that, this time it's on the leader's orders, the Blue Young Dragon that caused your brother's death last time, you're allowed to kill it now.\"\nRulga waved his hand to dismiss his guards, not looking at Gross beside him; his gaze drifted towards the endless sky beyond the mountain peak.\n\"I know suppressing your thoughts of revenge irked you before, but it concerned the tribe's future strategy, then was not okay, now it is.\"\n\"What are you up to again?\"\nGross did not immediately agree with Rulga, his large eyes fixated on him.\nInheriting the beastmen's impulsive and straightforward personality, reaching the status of the top warrior in the Blood Claw Tribe wasn't achieved by being utterly foolish.\nHis brother Grom, during the advance to establish a foothold, was beset by a Clan led by some Young Dragon nesting nearby. At that time, Gross indeed thought of seeking revenge but was suppressed by Rulga.\nBecause, despite the Blue Young Dragon being just a Silver Level orphan dragon as per the search, within this Barbaric Zone of the Kawa Great Forest, the Dragon Race's power was not small either, who knew if rash actions would attract a big enemy to the Blood Claw Tribe?\nBeastmen's nature was all about fighting when unsatisfied; however, Rulga was an exception, considering more from a benefit standpoint, which led the Blood Claw Tribe to grow from a moderate tribe to its present status.\nAt the time, Gross felt very aggrieved, filled with displeasure towards Rulga, eventually leaving the Blood Claw Tribe's base to come here, striking the waterfall, training himself away from the aggravation, and enhancing his strength.\n\"Give me a reason, don't think of fooling me easily.\"\nAlthough Gross disliked pondering too much, it didn't mean he was purely foolish, he knew some things.\nNow, suddenly allowing his vengeance, remembering Rulga's previous actions made Gross contemplate whether he had become a pawn to achieve some ends.\nSeeing Gross's expression, Rulga understood that some explanation was needed today.\n\"Gross, both you and I know we exist on the Bloody Border merely because the Inner Domain Royal Court requires so...\"\n\"No need to ask more, did you really think the humans erected the Iron Wall Great Wall at the edge of the Kawa Great Forest just to prevent our plunder before the winter?\"\n\"Simply by seizing grain resources from the Human World, it's impossible to maintain the survival of millions of beastmen; our existence is merely as the court requires us outside as a buffer line.... But now, hmph, those self-considered noble purebloods think they have the power to break everything..... and we are used as discard waste, becoming for some thing's nourishing material.\"\nRulga snorted coldly, his face turning unpleasant talking about this matter.\nThe hundreds of thousands to millions of beastmen population in the frontier zone, abandoned just like that, while being used as raw materials; even if those people were the legendary pureblood, who would willingly go to death.\nMutant Evil Spirit? Ha!\n\"Inner Domain Royal Court, is that legend true? Does the heartland truly have a Royal Court established by those purebloods?\"\nGross didn't notice these points but was instead focused on another, eyes wide with disbelief, and asked further:\n\"And, what do you mean by nourishing material, how does this relate to me killing the Young Dragon?\"",

      "content": "Among the beastmen within the Kawa Great Forest, there exists a legend.\nAccording to the legend, many years ago on the Seta Continent, there was an incredibly powerful Beastman Empire, ruling over the vast continent, at a time when the beastmen were the masters of the entire continent, with the pure-blooded beastmen at the high levels almost dominating everything on the continent.\nLater, for reasons unknown, the mighty empire suddenly collapsed, and eventually, its remnants fled from the center of the Seta Continent, escaping to the remote Kawa Great Forest in the south, a Barbaric Zone.\nAmong the beastmen, there has always been a rumor that the noble pure-bloods did not leave and vanish into the endless barbaric lands; instead, they established the Beastman Royal Court somewhere in the core inner domain, continuing the glory of that incredibly powerful empire.\nOf course, a rumor is just a rumor.\nIn fact, for the low-level beastmen living on the outskirts of the Kawa Great Forest, with their capabilities, they simply cannot traverse the thousands of miles of dangerous terrain to reach the core area to verify whether the rumor is true.\nPerhaps, in the hearts of many beastmen, the royal court in the legend is merely a yearning and yearning for a better life amid their difficult living conditions.\nHowever, the lower beastmen are unaware, but those at the true top know much more.\nThe reason they can have enough resources to support a population of hundreds of thousands is only because of the support from those behind them.\nOtherwise, ever since the establishment of the Iron Wall Great Wall at the Bloody Border, the beastman tribes have found it increasingly difficult to raid the human world to obtain large amounts of food supplies. If relying solely on themselves, without a sufficient food source, such a large tribe scale would have long since disintegrated.\nAs the strategist of the Blood Claw Tribe, Rulga is very clear about the position of these peripheral tribes.\nStrong puppets to withstand the humans' buffer zone.\nAnd now, for the so-called pure-bloods above them, these tribes have lost their usefulness.\nIf Rulga's words were heard by Austin, a storm might surge within his heart.\nThe existence of the so-called Beastman Empire and pure-blood beastmen, Austin has also heard from the Fox-faced Man Quik.\nLater, from the notes obtained at the relic left by that Gold Level Great Mage, Austin learned that the Gold Level Great Mage initially intended to head to the Kawa Great Forest to search for the remnants of the former Beastman Empire and find those remaining pure-blood beastmen.\nHowever, that Gold Level Great Mage searched within the Kawa Great Forest for years but still found nothing.\nBut now, in Rulga's words, the Beastman Royal Court truly exists and rules the core inner domain, with food supplies supporting those enormous top-tier tribes in the outskirts. How could this not astonish Austin?\nWas it that the pure-bloods hadn't established the royal court hundreds of years ago, or had the royal court been long established but even the Gold Level Great Mage couldn't find any traces?\n\"Gross...\"\nSeeing Gross's reaction seemingly incredulous about the Beastman Royal Court, Rulga was speechless yet understanding.\nAs the first warrior of the Blood Claw Tribe, Gross might have the qualifications to know these things, but he probably wouldn't specifically go to understand them, and thus, his reaction wasn't surprising to Rulga.\n\"If you're interested in knowing more specifics about the Beastman Royal Court, go ask the chief yourself.\"\nGross thought for a moment, finding it troublesome, shook his head, and said in a muffled voice:\n\"Forget it, the royal court is the royal court, what does it have to do with me? Just hurry up and explain why you suddenly agreed to let me kill that Blue Young Dragon. If there's no reasonable explanation, don't think about using me.\"\n\"It's not really using. Haven't you always held a grudge against your brother Grom's death? This time, it's just letting you take revenge. Of course, this matter counts as a good thing for the Blood Claw Tribe.\"\nGross, being rash and stubborn, wouldn't turn back once he's set his mind on something, so Rulga had no choice but to explain in detail.\n\"The so-called mutated evil spirit is merely an excuse from the royal court. Do they really think everyone is a fool?\"\n\"Those so-called pure-bloods are implementing a grand plan through those undead creatures. We don't know exactly what that plan is, but we can be sure that we've become a part of it... Ever since they started concealing the truth, we've been reduced to sacrifices, becoming nourishment for those things....\"\nAs he talked about it, a flash of resentment crossed Rulga's eyes, and he continued:\n\"The reason we began the great migration, formed the Tribe Alliance, and attacked the Bloody Great Wall was all just to find a way to survive. At that time, I stopped you from attacking that Young Dragon because we couldn't afford to provoke other enemies under such circumstances.\"\n\"But now, we've reached an agreement with humans. If those humans don't want to face those undead armies directly, they can only strongly support us for resistance. And more importantly, those undead creatures have already spread to the area where that Young Dragon is.\"\n\"Gross, what do you think the prideful Giant Dragon Race would do if a Young Dragon died at the hands of those undead and became one of them?\"\nGross pondered, his voice low like thunder:\n\"That Blue Young Dragon is supposedly an orphan dragon without parental care, but with the pride of the Giant Dragon Race, seeing their race's offspring becoming undead for battle, they certainly wouldn't hesitate to use thunderous means.\"\n\"That's right. The Dragon Race is a Legendary race, becoming Legendary upon maturity. If they take action, regardless of the reason, those big figures who've waited so long will definitely get involved, competing for the rich fruit...\"\nRulga spoke in a quiet voice, seemingly with implications.\n\"After all, the fruit is ripe... and it can be picked...\"\n\"But if found out, wouldn't I be in trouble too?\"\nGross's voice was low, pondering something.\n\"Heh, as long as all the witnesses are dead and that dragon indeed becomes an undead creature, what does it have to do with us? After all, it's merely a Silver Level Young Dragon. During the Undead Calamity, even Gold Level magic beasts have died before. Don't you think so, Gross?\"\nRulga spoke quietly, with a tone full of indifference.\nAfter successive wars, the Beastman Alliance's high command is also aware of the characteristics of those mutated undead, resurrection upon death being one of them.\nEven High Tier magic beasts of Gold Level will be infected and revived after death.\nAnd this trait allowed Rulga to discover the space for manipulation within it.",

I hope you won't disappoint us, and at that time, not a single one must escape, otherwise it could develop into a big trouble in the future.\"\nRulga said calmly to Gross.\nGross, the most powerful warrior in the Blood Claw Tribe, a title recognized rather than self-proclaimed, also representing his strong power that suppresses the entire Blood Claw Tribe.\nAlthough as a being naturally of the Extraordinary race, he does not need to activate the Extraordinary Seed power to automatically enhance his strength, Gross has never relaxed his demands on himself. Instead, he has diligently trained, step by step enhancing his power while confronting the Heaven and Earth Power. His extraordinary strength has shone brilliantly in wars time after time, even having once fought and killed a Gold High Tier Ice Storm Bear Lord, earning the fame of the Blood Claw Tribe's first warrior.\nHis formidable power is a rarity among the Tribe Alliance, making him a powerful overlord in the outside world as well.\nFurthermore, when the Blood Claw Tribe decided to send capable generals to establish a counterattack stronghold, it was Gross's brother Grom who was sent out.\nSuch a person has the strength and sufficient motive to kill the Blue Young Dragon.\nThis is exactly why Rulga came to find Gross to assign him the mission.\n\"Hmph, that young dragon is merely a Silver Level, killing it is not a problem, but it has over a thousand Beastman Race under its command, killing them all won't be so easy!\"\nA cruel glint flashed in Gross's eyes as he spoke confidently, as if killing Austin was as simple as squashing a fly.\nIn fact, he indeed thought this from the bottom of his heart.\nMere Silver Level, even if it's of the Dragon Race, so what?\nHe, Gross, is the famous first warrior of Blood Claw, a powerful overlord who once fought and killed a Gold High Tier lord!\nGiant dragons, once mature, might be a big trouble, but during their young stage, it's also their weakest time.\n\"It's a pity, although it's just a young dragon, it's still dragonslaying, yet it cannot be publicized. Otherwise, it would have added to my dragonslaying achievements.\"\nGross's millstone-sized hand clenched tightly, making a crackling sound, feeling the enormous power within, he thought to himself.\nThis power of a double-headed punch is enough to tear off that young dragon's head!\n\"Rest assured, Gross, along with you on this mission are five hundred Blood Claw elites. Leave those small fry to them; you only need to deal with the strongest Blue Young Dragon.\"\nWith Gross's strength, combined with five hundred elite Blood Claw warriors, it's enough to sweep through any ordinary Beastman Tribe.\nDealing with that tribe of just a few thousand people, with the strongest being merely a Silver Level young dragon, would be an easy annihilation.\nWhat a pity is that Rulga, for all his calculations, missed just one thing.\nThat is, the information about the Dragon Nest Tribe was already several months old.\nAnd within those months, Austin's power had made a significant breakthrough.\nBack then, to reduce suspicion, Rulga specifically reduced the frequency of the Beastman Alliance's envoy visits to the Dragon Nest Tribe to prevent anyone from tracing back to them. However, what he didn't foresee was that such a trivial adjustment became the biggest flaw in his calculations.\nAfter nearly three months of slumber, digesting a large amount of Magic Water Pattern Ore, Austin's power had long since transformed, successfully stepping into the Gold Level.\nOf course, with Gross being able to kill a Gold High Tier overlord, the outcome between the two remained uncertain.\n...\nAt the Bloody Border Region, just as a conspiracy against Austin and his subordinate Clan Tribe was gradually forming, the Dragon Nest Tribe had already entered a phase of strategic retreat, consolidating their existing strongholds.\nAnd while Austin delegated most matters to his subordinates, he began a new round of \"seclusion.\"\nOf course, this so-called \"seclusion\" wasn't in the true sense, rather it was Austin starting to organize and refine his own power to a certain extent.\n\"Magic Power, compared to the Silver Tier, has increased more than tenfold!\"\nWhen he first awoke, he was immediately faced with the pressing threats of the zombie undead army, forcing Austin onto the battlefield hurriedly, developing a semi-finished Attribute Magic Power Rasengan, leading the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion in the first counterattack against the zombie undead army.\nUntil now, the pyramid base of the zombie undead army closest to the Dragon Nest Division's stronghold had been completely destroyed, and the distant sea of zombie undead showed no signs of movement. The Dragon Nest Tribe had thus become secure, allowing Austin to finally truly begin a deeper integration and organization of his powers.\nIt was also then that he discovered his Magic Power had surged to such an extent compared to when he was at the Silver Level!\n\"Scale Armor Defense strengthened thrice, body size expanded by one time, and the sharpness of teeth and claws also enhanced to some extent, thus my close combat ability must have increased by at least tenfold.\"\nVery strong!\nAmong the same Level of Magic Beasts, Austin's close combat ability likely ranks first class.\nThis is the might of the Giant Dragon Bloodline, the power belonging to a Legendary Bloodline. Meanwhile, the vast amount of Magic Water Pattern Ore Austin consumed before slumber cannot be overlooked as contributing factors.\nAlongside the skyrocketing close combat ability, Austin's talent in magic had also leaped tremendously.\nAwakening the fourth talent magic, Super Storm, simultaneously granting Austin control over both wind and water elemental powers, in addition to the thunder element.\nIt was precisely the combination of the wind, water, and thunder elements that gave birth to that destructive Attribute Transformation Rasengan move.\nAnd thus, Austin evolved a kind of attack method with power comparable to a Legendary rank.\nBut this is still not enough!",

      "content": "The Super Invincible Destroy Everything Compress Wind-Water-Thunder Rasengan, despite its extremely powerful destructive force comparable to a Forbidden Curse, at the center of that Rasengan explosion, terrifying high temperatures and high pressures, along with the intensely rotating wind attribute cutting power mixed in everything, all materials touched by it would instantly vanish and evaporate, with the aftershock melting the earth's soil into molten glass.\nBut this technique, though strong, takes an incredibly long time to charge.\nBack when destroying the Zombie Pyramid, Austin needed the help of his clan's beastmen to clear out a large area, providing him with a safe enough space to execute the technique.\nThat Rasengan did not exceed Austin's expectations, instantly demolishing the earth and completely destroying the Zombie Pyramid.\nHowever, that was in specific circumstances; in actual combat situations, the enemy would not give you time to charge up such a move.\nHence, how to perfectly master one's own power, how to simplify the Super Invincible Destroy Everything Compress Wind-Water-Thunder Rasengan to be usable in actual combat, had become urgent.\n\"Originally, to bombard fixed targets, the pursuit of extreme attack power led to incorporating Thunder Attribute's nature change into the Magic Rasengan, but now, the Rasengan formed by the nature change of Wind-Water-Thunder attributes, before my mastery reaches a certain precision, is still not suitable for combat...\"\nAustin was very clear about his current power, the Super Invincible Destroy Everything Compress Wind-Water-Thunder Rasengan indeed powerful, but at this stage, it was not suitable for direct combat.\nChanges must be made!\nThe nature change of the Thunder Attribute is difficult to incorporate into the Rasengan, yet in the original manga, the Wind Attribute's nature change has always been protagonist Naruto's trump card.\nWind Style: Rasengan.\nCompared to the difficult control of Thunder Escape, Wind Escape paired with Rasengan has a more suitable compatibility.\nIn the coming days, Austin focused his heart-spirit on the Wind Attribute nature change of Rasengan. Compared to the nature change of Thunder Attribute, the Wind Attribute's nature change was smooth sailing.\nThis might be related to the successful development of the Wind-Water-Thunder Rasengan, as it took Austin just a few days to develop the Wind Attribute Magic Rasengan.\nUnlike Naruto's shuriken form in the original manga, Austin's Wind Attribute Magic Rasengan is a perfect sphere, with violent wind attribute power compressed and concentrated within a small ball, containing unimaginably terrible power.\nIn his previous life, Austin had seen a video.\nIf you simulate Jupiter's wind strength onto Earth, the rapid-moving wind blades produced could split a wooden plank in half!\nAnd within this Wind Attribute Rasengan, the rotational speed of the wind element is thousands upon thousands times stronger than Jupiter's wind strength; during experiments, when the Rasengan with nature change of Wind Attribute explodes, it instantly unleashes a terrifying torrent.\nThe soil hundreds of meters around was instantly shredded and swept into it, like water rushing and spinning rapidly, eventually manifesting as a towering dust storm that rampages across the earth, pulverizing trees and rocks into dust.\nAs the power dissipated, a massive pit remained on the earth, its surface as smooth as a mirror, deeply sunken beneath the ground.\n\"This is... the power of wind!\"\nStanding atop the mountain, Austin silently remarked as he gazed at the massive pit below.\nThe power of wind, shattering everything, eradicating everything,\nThe instant explosive power tears apart all materials within its range, though not as terrifying as the Rasengan with nature change of Wind-Water-Thunder attributes, it is still exceptionally formidable, and a powerful one below Legendary Realm, hit by such a Wind Attribute nature change Rasengan, would likely be minced into meat paste.\n\"Very well, the Wind Attribute Rasengan has developed quite well, but there's still some distance from instantaneous casting, further optimization is necessary.\"\nThe Wind Attribute Rasengan's power is already adequate, the only flaw being the time needed to form it.\nCurrently, Austin requires at least a minute to form the Magic Rasengan and apply the nature change of Wind Attribute.\nSuch a long time is a bit slow in a tense battle, and experienced enemies won't allow you the time to form such a finishing move.\nThus, further optimization of the Wind Attribute Rasengan is necessary, such as shortening the time needed for cohesion, ensuring it cannot be interrupted even when interfered with by enemies during battle.\nFor the ultimate form of the Rasengan with nature change of attributes, Austin imagines relying entirely on mental concentration, freeing his front limbs and claws, to instantly form these powerful Rasengans in the void, and even multitasking, creating one, two, three... in an instant in the void.\nCountless Rasengans with nature change of attributes would rise unprovoked in the void, continuously emerging, becoming a nightmare for any future enemy of Austin.\nOf course, achieving such a level involves immense difficulty.\nBut every task has a beginning, so start with the Wind Attribute nature change Rasengan.\n\"Aside from improvements to the cohesion of the Wind Attribute Rasengan, perhaps trying out the water attribute nature change of Rasengan is worth considering. Currently, apart from these, improvements are necessary in controlling the skyrocketing magic power, managing thunder, and controlling wind and water elements, while developing some combat techniques suitable for me.\"\nWhile reviewing himself, Austin realized there are still many tasks to accomplish during his \"retreat\" period.\nOnce perfect mastery is achieved over all the skyrocketing powers, and the Wind Attribute Rasengan can be freely formed through mental concentration, Austin's strength will undoubtedly undergo a transformative change.\nSubsequently, Austin plunged into arduous \"retreat\" training, commencing optimizations in mastery over his skyrocketing power.\nAnd soon after,\nSeveral days later, the long-delayed cold winter finally arrived one day.\nVast water attribute magic power rolled down from the sky, enveloping the heavens and earth, with temperatures plummeting, the forest land froze visibly, and the sky rained down large snowflakes, a raging blizzard seemingly intent on covering the entire world!\nIn less than half a day, the whole world was engulfed in a crystalline cloak of silver and white, heavens and earth draped in a white hue.\nMeanwhile, within the icy snows, the Dragon Nest Tribe beastmen began to hibernate, waiting for the most perilous days to pass.\nSimultaneously, Austin took shelter within the Dragon Nest, quietly awaiting the passing of the cold front while reflecting on integrating his power.",

      "content": "In the early days of the cold winter, the forest land was filled with danger, a terrifying cold front draped across the high sky, and the \"colorless Death God\" occasionally fell from above.\nAlthough the deathly cold falling from the heavens wasn't immediately life-threatening for Austin now, it was still better to avoid the cold and stay cozily tucked away in his nest.\nThe magic power, which had surged more than tenfold, caused Austin's control over himself to become rougher. He was unable to act with ease, and his newfound strength hadn't fully merged with his body.\nDuring the days holed up in his nest, unable to experiment with the wind attribute Rasengan, Austin began to filter and train his own strength.\n\"If I can achieve a fine control over my own magic power, it will be quite significant for the improvement of the wind attribute Rasengan. At least, after I've mastered the control of my own magic power, the time to manifest it should reduce to some extent.\"\nSilently in his heart, Austin mused within the Dragon's Nest.\nSoon, before him in the void, a white orb of magic power suddenly appeared, floating in the air.\nWith a thought, Austin began to draw from the orb, threading it into a string the size of a cord. With the influence of his spiritual power, the white magic orb began to unravel into a coiled white magic rope in the air.\nBut that was just the beginning,\nSoon after, the white magic rope in the air was split in two under Austin's spiritual power, pulling from both sides, unravelling further, and soon there appeared two magic lines as thick as chopsticks in mid-air.\nA bead of sweat slowly formed on Austin's forehead as the two chopstick-thick magic lines hovered, trembling slightly, but they soon settled, quietly suspended in the air.\nHe exhaled deeply, spiritual power surged again, simultaneously controlling the two magic lines, and with spiritual power, tore them from the middle, turning two magic lines into four finer ones.\nAs the precision of control increased, Austin's hold became laborious, maintaining those four wire-thin magic lines in mid-air was showing signs of collapse.\nJust as he intended to take it further, splitting the four lines into eight, the magic lines suddenly wavered, and instantly collapsed, dissipating in the air.\n\"Phew, is this the limit!\"\nAustin exhaled deeply, feeling utterly exhausted.\nWith all his heart spirit focused on the magic lines, not only maintaining their structure to avoid collapse, but also manipulating them, was more draining than fighting a battle.\nHowever, despite the fatigue, it was worth it.\nJust that brief practice had already allowed Austin to feel a further step in mastering his own strength.\nIf one day, he could draw out a magic orb into hundreds or thousands of fine strands like hair, then Austin's control over his own magic would reach an extremely high level.\nWith such a degree of magic control, forming a wind attribute Rasengan would be a mere trifle.\nThus, Austin immersed himself in a deeper layer of magic control training.\n...\nIn the initial days of the cold front's passage, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe was also in a state of dormancy, barely venturing out.\nMeanwhile, at the temporary retreat base, due to the collaborative efforts of the Dragon Nest Beastmen, enough houses were constructed before the harsh winter set in, and although the walls were unfinished, the presence of a large number of Dragon Nest Tribe elite beastmen prevented much worry about any unexpected incidents.\nSeveral days later, the dangerous times of early winter had passed, and the Dragon Nest Tribe Beastmen emerged from their homes, fortifying their training while also engaging in tasks possible even in the cold winter.\nHowever, compared to the headquarters, the Dragon Nest Tribe's first base was relatively busy at the moment.\nAfter daily training, several Dragon Nest Beastmen went out in force, wielding bronze axes to fell trees, gathering up the enormous trunks, sharpening the tops, and erecting them around the perimeter of the first base's houses to establish a simple wall to prevent wild beast attacks.\n\"Be vigilant, report immediately if you spot traces of any giant beasts or magic beasts...\"\nIn the open area outside the base, the Dark Elf Adinlek addressed the orc patrol team before him, giving them instructions and then letting them disperse to patrol.\nAs a mid-term Dragon Nest Beastman veteran, despite having many issues, Adinlek was the first to hand over the breathing technique of dark creatures, a feat that even if better were captured in the future, Austin would never completely forget Adinlek's contributions.\nMoreover, the Dark Elf race inherently gains bonuses in vision and agility at night, as do those transformed into Dark Dragon Guards by the breathing techniques of dark creatures.\nConsequently, Adinlek had become the commander of the not-very-prominent Dark Dragon Guards within the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAnd because of their keen hearing and enhanced night vision, they became part of the patrol team.\n\"This matter requires full alertness. According to His Highness, this outpost must be developed in accordance with the expansion model of the Dragon Nest Tribe headquarters, and His Highness's attention to the outpost is no less than that of the Copper Mine Base. If you still hope to meet His Highness's approval, you cannot relax your vigilance, and you must prevent any crisis from befalling your companions.\"\n\"Yes!\"\nSoon, the patrol team dispersed, scouting between the woodland to prevent any hungry magic beasts or giant beasts from attacking the orc producers working on site, averting significant casualties.\nThis was untouched virgin land, not comparable to the area near the Dragon Nest Tribe headquarters.\nOnly through a fresh round of expansion eradication could the first base be truly transformed into a secure outpost area.\nA large number of beastman militia wielded their sharp bronze axes, felling the forest and transporting the felled logs back to the base as construction material.\nOnce the cleared forest land was prepared, after the cold winter passed next year, the land could be developed for farming, establishing a sufficient logistical system around the outpost.\nOnly by establishing a food supply system similar to the Dragon Nest Tribe headquarters could the outpost support round after round of annihilation wars against nearby tribes, rapidly strengthening the power of his subordinate clans.\nThe first outpost was precisely the first step of the Dragon Nest Tribe's expansion plan implemented by Austin.\nIf this step succeeds, then later using this as a template, outposts could be continuously established around the Dragon Nest Tribe headquarters, while also keeping the headquarters protected at its center, significantly improving the number and strength of his subordinate clan corps.",

      "content": "Thanks to Austin's modern management, and the brainwashing propaganda work, a vast majority of the Beastman Race within the Dragon Nest Tribe have an immense faith in him.\nThis faith stems from a pure admiration from the hearts of the Beastman Race.\nHowever, even a beastman cannot be completely like a robot; some Beastman Tribes have certain benefit-oriented demands apart from their internal admiration for Austin.\nDark Elf Adinlek is such a case. When he surrendered to the Dragon Nest Tribe, it was not because of some kingly aura of Austin, but due to Austin's mighty strength and the potential height he could reach in the future.\nHe is not like those simple-minded beastmen. Two years ago, Austin was merely a Bronze Level Young Dragon, and more powerful extraordinary races wouldn't consider pledging loyalty to a dragon of such weak strength without parental protection.\nBut Adinlek is different. As a Dark Elf, how could he have survived and arrived at the Kawa Great Forest's Barbaric Zone without a certain degree of intelligence?\nIn that failed battle, he saw Austin's army, which although still somewhat weak, was incredibly strong.\nHe was betting that the Dragon named Austin would not be like those proud, brainless peers, betting that the Blue Young Dragon capable of training such a Beastman army would eventually grow up and become a dominant leader!\nThus, the Dark Elf surrendered under Austin's command, offering his Breathing Technique heritage, helping to train extraordinary beastmen, and continually putting effort into the building of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nNow, when Austin grows into a dominant leader, the benefits he would receive would undoubtedly be substantial.\nIn fact, the Dark Elf's gamble has already been half won by now.\nMore than thirty thousand Beastman Race individuals, the massive development of Martial Techniques, increasingly powerful Beastman officers—the military group formed by the Dragon Nest Tribe can be considered first-rate within the entire Kawa Great Forest.\nDue to the developed farming, the Dragon Nest Tribe does not need, like other Beastman Tribes, to occupy vast forest lands to support a large population; in addition to Austin's stable development temperament, the Dragon Nest Tribe has not expanded outside the hundred-mile circle aside from clearing the surrounding area.\nTherefore, the Dragon Nest Tribe's reputation only rules within this small area, but further away, it is not well-known, and other Beastman Tribes do not know of such a powerful military force hidden in this corner.\nIn the eyes of the Dark Elf, the Dragon Nest Tribe, in terms of reputation, might only be the ruler of a small valley within the entire Kawa Great Forest, but its actual strength truly possesses the ability to compete with large tribes.\nIn just two or three years, the development to the current level is simply unbelievable, completely beyond the Dark Elf's expectations.\nAdinlek believes that in another ten years, another dominant force within the Kawa Great Forest will surely rise, and as one of the early founders, he will inevitably receive indescribable benefits.\n\"His Highness is nostalgic but also prefers capable people. That atavistic Jackal Wolf People youth is like that, catching the attention of His Highness from among the mediocrity, earning the chance to enter the Combat Techniques development team. To achieve a higher status in the tribe's future development, one must demonstrate more abilities...\"\nVery early on, the Dark Elf had this realization.\nAs a wandering mercenary, Adinlek had been drifting outside for years, possessing rich experience in outdoor survival and considerable experience in leading troops into battle, playing a significant role within the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nEspecially in the early days, he often led the hunting team out for hunts, gaining numerous merits in various battles, with the corpses of many Giant Beasts standing as testament to his achievements.\nBut now, the Dark Elf feels his status is being challenged.\nThat damned human mercenary who should go to Hell, the former Mercenary Deputy Captain Gory, has been hopping around in front of His Highness since surrendering out of cowardice.\nThough reluctant to admit it, the truth is that the damned Mercenary Deputy Captain Gory's abilities are indeed commendable, especially in troop training, having a unique approach; along with extensive mercenary survival experience, he's adept at leading the Beastman army in the wild, gaining considerable merit.\nThus, Adinlek, with abilities similar to Gory, feels his status faces a strong challenge from the human mercenary.\n\"Damn guy, he better hope I don't get any hold on him!\"\nThinking of that damned guy, the Dark Elf's face turns unhappy, internally cursing once.\nThe construction of the first stronghold concerns the Dragon Nest Tribe's outward expansion process; the Dark Elf knows its importance clearly, and following Gory's appearance, he needs to establish more merits in this expansion operation to prevent his status from being threatened.\n\"Everyone, be careful of the ice dropping overhead,\"\nIn the snowy field, the Dark Elf walking in front reminds his team behind him.\nWith the cold front passing, the forest land is covered in a vast whiteness, the trees heavily cloaked with snow, while sharp ice spikes are hung suspended.\nThough most creatures enter hibernation during the cold winter, some animals still hunt in the cold, and those active during the cold are exceptionally fierce creatures.\nThis area is unfamiliar, and to prevent attacks from wild creatures, they can only increase the Beastman's patrol frequency.\nBut during patrols, the most injuries are not from beasts' attacks but the sharp ice spikes hung on large trees, saturating the patrol with falling dangers.\nTo prevent patrols from receiving head injuries from the ice spikes, the Dragon Nest Tribe had to urgently gather a batch of Bronze Helmets, so the Dragon Nest Beastman patrol would wear them when venturing out.\nBeastman patrols navigate through the forest, constantly patrolling vigilantly, keeping dangers excluded from the stronghold.\nUnpredictable whens,\nWhoosh!\nA subtle sound suddenly arrives, hardly noticeable amidst the rustling of the patrol team, yet Adinlek's ears twitch intensely, his eyes sharp, swiftly drawing his bow and readying an arrow.\n\"Who!\"\nBefore finishing the word, the sharp arrow in his hand is swiftly launched, like a bolt of lightning, shooting into the forest where ice spikes hang shrouded.\nThud!\nA dull sound echoes, a flash of bloodred within the depths of the woods, as if something was hit, and Adinlek's subordinates look ahead with heightened alert.",

      "content": "\"Wow, wow!\"\nAn angry, unknown cry suddenly came from the depths, as if some creature had been enraged.\nImmediately afterward,\nLong spears whizzed through the air, shooting out from deep within the forest like a torrential downpour, enveloping the Dragon Nest Beastmen patrols.\n\"Be careful!\"\nThe Dark Elf shouted loudly, his figure bursting into action, retreating rapidly,\nwhile the Dragon Nest Beastmen behind him quickly sought cover, dashing to hide behind shelters.\nThe densely packed wooden spears rained down, embedding into the ground and tree trunks, but the Dragon Nest Beastmen were well-prepared to dodge, and with their leather armor and bronze helmets, only a couple of them were unlucky enough to get injured, without any serious harm.\nAt this moment, in the distant dense forest, small figures, almost like gnomes, wielding spears and bows, leapt out from between the trees.\n\"Form up, prepare for battle!\"\nThough sudden, the Dark Elf remained unfazed, and the well-trained Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers quickly relied on each other, forming a dense long spear array, warily watching ahead.\nBy this time, those figures had only just charged to the front of the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nGazing at the half-human-height small figures, the Dark Elf's pupils suddenly contracted.\n\"Elves?!!!\"\nElves never gather together to form tribes like the Beastmen; they never exist alone.\nAnd these well-trained elves before them were clearly combatants or perhaps even an army.\nCould it be that there is an Elf Kingdom nearby?\n...\nDragon Nest Tribe, Back Mountain.\nAustin stood at the mountain peak cliff, cold winds howling through, his gaze sweeping across a vast, snowy white landscape.\nYet, for him now, any scenery was all the same.\nAt this moment, he had his eyes closed, focusing his heart and mind entirely on splitting the magic corps in front of him.\nSoon after, in the space around him, tiny magic lines hovered in the air, dancing with the wind, like a giant dandelion blossoming and expanding.\nAfter a while, the dandelion formed by magic power started to stall, unable to continue splitting and blooming.\nAnd Austin opened his deep blue eyes, exhaling a hot breath through his nostrils.\n\"That's as far as I can go for now...\"\nLooking at the enormous magic power \"dandelion\" in front of him, with its lines drifting in the wind, Austin's eyes were filled with a complex expression.\nAfter a dozen days of training, he could now strip the magic corps down to hair-thin magic lines, achieving an extremely high level of control precision. Austin could even proudly claim that, among dragons of his age, none had the precision of magic control that he had achieved.\nIn fact, Austin wasn't without room for further improvement.\nHowever, to improve precision further, the effort required would increase exponentially, and for now, higher precision magic control didn't offer much enhancement for Austin's current stage, making it not worth the extensive investment.\nSo Austin decided to stop there.\nBeing able to control his magic power to a hair-like level was already sufficient for him now.\n\"Indeed, higher precision magic control has a significant impact on the control of the Rasengan.\"\nWith a thought, a fist-sized magic vortex suddenly appeared in front of Austin, with magic power swirling, rapidly condensing into a magic Rasengan within just a few seconds.\n\"This condensation speed is at least four or five times faster than before. In close combat, even without attribute transformation, a pure magic Rasengan is still quite damaging.\"\nWith the effect of spiritual power, the magic Rasengan in front of him spun like a cannonball, shooting towards a massive ancient tree in the distance.\nBuzz!!!\nUpon impact, the magic Rasengan exploded fiercely; the terrifying force of magic generated a violent clean wind, blasting a large hole in the trunk of the ancient tree, with the subsequent force even creating a large pit in the solid stone behind it.\nAnd afterward, another magic Rasengan appeared in front of Austin.\nBut unlike before, when it seemed effortless, Austin now had a look of solemnity on his face, extending both forepaws to control the direction of the magic power.\nBuzz buzz buzz!\nThe air began to vibrate violently. Compared to the silent magic Rasengan before, the one Austin now condensed was astonishingly powerful. Intense wind blades vibrated in the air, creating a buzzing sound, while inside the core, it seemed to slice through space, creating a dazzling stream of light that was astonishing to behold.\nAfter a few seconds, the magic Rasengan suddenly quivered, with power fully contracting to the core, and a halo appeared in front of Austin, the swirling round of light with attribute power almost reaching the limits of power.\n\"Vanish!\"\nWith a mental command, a section of the wind attribute-transformed Rasengan before him changed, decomposing as a massive storm of airflow burst forth from it. Like a tidal tsunami, it swept across, leaving not a speck of snow untouched on the ground.\nUltimately, the wind attribute Rasengan before him completely dissipated, transforming into a massive release of magic power without causing any damage nearby.\nAttaining this level already showed that Austin's control over the Rasengan's wind attribute transformation had reached a decent extent. With further training, he might even achieve the capacity to summon it spontaneously from the void, like his pure magic Rasengan.\n\"The result of this closed-door training isn't bad. High-precision magic control also aids attribute transformations of magic power. I wonder if further refinement in control will someday enable the creation of Spherical Lightning.\"\nWith this round of magic control training complete, Austin clearly felt that the achievement was not only an improvement in the Rasengan's control but also in his ability to expertly execute the wind attribute transformation of the Rasengan.\nIt's uncertain, however, when his control over magic will be refined to such an extent as to manipulate the explosive thunder energy, crafting a perfectly pure Thunder Attribute Rasengan.\nNonetheless, the current results were already quite pleasing.\nMost importantly, his mastery over his own power has improved significantly. Where once ten parts of strength were needed, now one part was sufficient.\nHis control over the magic of thunder, wind, and water attributes had also greatly advanced.\n\"And truly, I hadn't expected the improvement of magic control precision to have such benefits.\"\nAustin thought silently to himself, and with a mental command, threads of magic extended from the void, interlinking heaven and earth like a spider's web.\nAbove, the sky had somehow become shrouded with dense clouds, covering the entire sky and earth, and among the clouds, a mighty rumble echoed....",

While Austin was within this storm zone, he could perceive various flows of magic power, thus gaining some abilities akin to an embryonic domain.\nHowever, now, as his control over his own power increased, strands of magic lines combined with some attributes of the fourth talent magic, enabling him to turn an area within a hundred miles into his own domain without activating the storm.\n\"Within this embryonic domain, the enemy's every move is almost under my control, one could even say that this simple domain is my home field!\"\nUpon perceiving the control over his domain, countless combat techniques immediately surfaced in Austin's mind.\nIf an enemy were to engage him within his home field, they would be at an innate disadvantage, let alone considering Austin's endless derivative abilities. As long as they can't defeat Austin in one blow, victory would most likely be his.\n\"In terms of attack, there is the Thunder Roar Cannon, Electromagnetic Cannon, Magic Rasengan, and various derivative property changes. For close combat, the domain provides support. Coupled with me being a legendary level entity as a giant dragon, my combat power surpasses that of ordinary extraordinary beings. So, as long as no legendary appears, survival is basically unhindered.\"\nOrganizing the combat means he possessed, Austin felt quite satisfied.\nCompared to the days of trembling and hiding when he was weak, now he could basically walk across this land openly.\nWith his current power, as long as no legendary appears, there basically wouldn't be any problem.\nOf course, Austin had already decided that before becoming a legend, he wouldn't wander around freely. After all, just from the fragmentary legendary law awakening in his bloodline, one could glimpse the terrifying existence of truly reaching that realm.\n\"But, why does the giant dragon bloodline conceal legendary laws, and how can they be passed down from generation to generation?\"\nLegendary, for ordinary creatures like humans and beastmen, is like an insurmountable barrier. Those who can step into that realm are incredibly rare.\nHowever, the Giant Dragon Race can easily reach it, crossing that threshold, stepping into that realm.\nGiant dragons do not need cultivation, they need not comprehend the origin laws of heaven and earth like humans and other ordinary creatures. Upon adulthood, the legendary law hidden within their bloodline automatically unlocks, allowing them to effortlessly enter the legendary realm.\nSuch disparity between biological levels is indeed too large.\nThis made Austin have to wonder where the Dragon Race's talent comes from, whether the legendary law in their bloodline is innate or due to other reasons.\nIf it's innate, at most, it's just the injustice of heaven and earth.\nIf it forms postnatal, for example, in the ancient era, if a dragon achieved the realm of a divine being or something, and from then on, the descendants of the Dragon Race had the ability to pass down the legendary law, that would be terrifying.\nIf that's the case, perhaps the secret of Austin's soul travel was detected by such an existence.\nOr perhaps, his travel is just a pawn of some existing entity.\nThinking of this possibility, Austin couldn't help but shudder, feeling a sense of impending doom.\nBut soon, he figured it out.\n\"It shouldn't be like this...\"\nIf it were truly detected, he would have been found long ago, and if he were a pawn, then with his current power, he couldn't resist such an entity and would have no choice but to obey.\nFor now, he was at least very safe.\n\"The matter of soul traveling, the specific reasons are still unknown. However, these legendary creatures of the Dragon Race also surely harbor many unknown elements to me.\"\nRegardless of the origin of the legendary laws within the dragon bloodline,\nThe Giant Dragon Species, upon reaching adulthood, become legendary. Compared to ordinary beings like humans, they are unbelievably stronger.\nHowever, the rulers of this world are not dragons, but humans!\nThe prime areas on the Seta Continent are all occupied by humans.\nIt's simply unfathomable; after all, beyond legendary, one cannot be exterminated merely by numbers.\nYet, with such a powerful group as the Dragon Race, their adults being legendary, how could they let humans ride over their heads to become continental overlords!\nMind you, not every dragon possesses the temperament of Austenite, who avoids trouble and seeks steady development. The majority of giant dragons, having a supreme bloodline, hold a high and mighty attitude towards lower beings, so why would these dragons willingly hand over the dominion of the continent to those lowly humans?\nOr could it be that humans have some other confidence for becoming the continent's overlord?\nCountless mysteries then welled up, but no matter how much he pondered now, it was of no use.\nThe specific reasons therein are beyond what Austin can touch at this moment.\nHowever, Austin also gained some guesses from it.\nThis world is far from simple.\nEven in the legendary realm, there are still things to heed, not truly free to roam between heaven and earth.\n\"Enough, thinking too much is pointless, at least in this vicinity, there's already nothing that can threaten my life. Once I've cultivated for another few hundred or thousand years, in the vastness of the world, I can come and go as I please, can't I?\"\nShifting his heart and mind away from those complex matters, he focused again on enhancing his strength.\nAt least at this stage, regardless of the ceiling above, Austin's primary goal is still to continuously enhance his power and stabilize the development of his Clan Tribe.\nThe continent is vast, boundless; in this world, he is but a mere drop in the ocean. Even if he shines brightly, he would hardly be discovered as a grain of golden sand hidden in the desert, unless this grain grows to the size of a Golden Mountain.\nAnd those are far too distant for him.\nReturning his mind to his domain, planning to develop techniques based on his domain, Austin suddenly sensed some disturbances in the direction of the Dragon Nest Tribe within his domain.\nHis brow furrowed first, then his eyes widened in anger.\n\"Hmm? Courting death!!!\"",

      "content": "At a certain mountain peak, Gross, standing two to three meters tall like a giant iron tower, held an orc's head he had twisted off alive and casually tossed it aside. Picking up the bronze long spear beside the corpse on the ground, his gaze revealed a hint of interest.\nThe snow around was soaked with blood, with mutilated corpses scattered all around. Judging by their equipment, they were obviously the patrol of the Dragon Nest Tribe nearby.\nStanding in the midst of the corpses, Gross picked up the bloody bronze long spear and examined it, then kicked at the leather armor on a nearby corpse.\n\"Interesting thing, but unfortunately too fragile.\"\nCasually breaking the bronze long spear, Gross said indifferently. Meanwhile, he cast his gaze toward the not-so-distant city tribe below, his lips curling into a sinister smile.\n\"A decent tribe, but today, I am determined to annihilate you!\"\nAs he spoke, a powerful aura began to appear behind Gross, emerging one after another, numbering nearly hundreds, as a murderous air surged into the sky.\nThis group was sent by the Blood Claw Tribe to kill and eradicate Austin and his Clan Tribe.\nTheir sole aim was to completely slaughter all the orcs and lure the undead here, turning all the Dragon's clan orcs and himself into those mutated evil spirits.\nWith Gross's top-tier Gold-level combat power, coupled with over a hundred extraordinary Blood Claw elites, it was enough to wipe out any medium-sized tribe.\nHaving traveled across mountains and rivers, enduring the passage of the harsh winter, they managed to arrive here to find their target, only to unexpectedly encounter a patrol team from the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAlready filled with pent-up rage from the journey, Gross didn't hesitate at all, killing most of the patrol immediately, with only one human escaping.\nThe escape of that guy would indeed alert the Dragon Nest Tribe, thereby increasing the difficulty of the mission.\nBut, so what?\nAlthough the Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers in the patrol had displayed a quality that wasn't ordinary, giving off an aura of battle-hardened elites,\nThey were still easily crushed by their overwhelming power.\nFor a mere troop of over a thousand Dragon Nest Tribe put together by a Silver Young Dragon, they believed there would be no accidents this time.\n\"Indeed, that guy runs fast, but that's all there is to it, go, kill them!\"\nLooking at the small human figure running toward the encircling wall in the distance below the mountain, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe also sounded a massive alarm, with teams of well-armed soldiers emerging from corners of buildings, gathering at the street walls.\nEvidently, the human who escaped earlier had alarmed the entire Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThere was no thought about why humans were present here, nor why they would serve that dragon.\nGross displayed a hint of a bloody grimace, flipping a bloodstained bronze long spear into his palm with a kick.\n\"Kill!!!\"\nAccompanied by a roar, Gross's aura suddenly surged, and blood-colored Fighting Qi erupted like a blazing flame.\nSimultaneously, his arm, as hard as steel, grasped the bloodied long spear, hurling it forcefully forward.\nWhoosh!\nThe next moment, a beam of blood light was cast down from the sky, breaking through the brick and wood structure of the city wall like a violent storm, instantly creating an enormous breach.\nAs the sand and wood shattered, the soldiers on the wall were blown away, swept up by the torrent passing through the road, as smoke and dust filled the air.\n\"Hahaha! Charge! Slaughter everything here!\"\nWith the resounding noise that echoed across the sky, Gross leapt high above, like a blood-red meteor descending from the heavens, bringing with it an apocalyptic might and thunderous roars.\nRumble!!!\nThe blood-colored streak of light fell in front of Dragon Nest Town, crashing into the ground with a loud bang, causing large swathes of soil to collapse, and the ground shattered inch by inch as the terrifying current surged into the sky.\nBehind him, strong figures with a powerful aura followed, rushing toward the Dragon Nest Tribe town, which had a massive gap broken in its walls, with unstoppable momentum.\nNo formation was needed, or any formation at all.\nUnder the charge of the exceptionally powerful Blood Claw elites, there was an overwhelming feeling akin to a tsunami approach.\n\"Enemy attack, engage!\"\nThe attack was sudden, but the Dragon Nest Tribe's response was swift.\nMoreover, most gathered here were elites of the Dragon Nest Tribe, readying their defenses in a short time.\nFacing enemies daring enough to challenge the tribe with reckless provocation, the Dragon Nest Legion fearlessly launched its counterattack.\nOne by one, the Beastman Junior Officers appeared first using instantaneous step, while the Beastman officers led their troops mightily toward the enemy in an overwhelming charge.\nNo need for any communication.\nThose on the Blood Claw Tribe side had already decided to eradicate all the orcs of the Dragon Nest Tribe, along with the Blue Young Dragon.\nOn the side of the Dragon Nest Tribe, there was undying hatred for the enemy daring enough to ambush them, violently breaking through the city's main gate and walls.\nFrom the start, both sides had already engaged in a fierce blood battle.\nBoom!\nThe two flood-like forces crashed into each other, six or seven Beastman Junior Officers joined forces, targeting Gross, the Blood Claw leader. The aftermath of the battle erupted, and the invisible Fighting Qi clash shattered the ground.\nMeanwhile, other Beastman officers led well-equipped and trained troops to battle against the Blood Claw elites, with continuous casualties.\n\"Hahaha, excellent! Never thought I could meet foes like you in such a remote place!\"\nDespite being besieged by six or seven Beastman Junior Officers, Gross laughed instead of being angry. In an instant, he exchanged dozens to hundreds of blows, his body erupting with blood-colored Fighting Qi, blasting the unsuspecting Beastman Junior Officers away with terrifying force.\nWith the combat power of his own and the addition of the Beastman Six Techniques that surpassed the average Silver combat power of Beastman Junior Officers, they not only failed to overcome Gross, but were instead repeatedly repelled in a moment of explosive burst!\n\"Very good combat techniques, but unfortunately, this is as far as you go!\"\nThe erupting blood-colored Fighting Qi not only pushed back the besieging Beastman Junior Officers, but the ground beneath his feet crumbled inch by inch, with visible energy waves rising from under his feet, making Gross's hair and beard flare with rage like a furious Demon God.\n\"Die!!!\"\nRepelling the Beastman Junior Officers in one move, the terrifying Fighting Qi erupted once more, forming a bloody crimson war bear behind him, roaring viciously.\nWatching Gross about to strike, annihilating the several Beastman Junior Officers before him,\nAt that moment,\n\"You are courting death!\"\nLike the might of heaven, like purgatory, a colossal thunderous sound resounded from the sky, eroding heaven and earth like a flood, echoing throughout every corner of the world.\nThe entire sky darkened in an instant, as overwhelming pressure rolled in like tidal waves, sweeping far and wide.",

      "content": "The immense sound roared like thunder between heaven and earth, as if divine demons from above the nine heavens and below the nine earths proclaimed an immutable decree to all beings.\nRolling dark clouds shrouded the sky, and a massive figure descended from above the clouds with an overwhelming pressure like a mountain, stirring a colossal torrent between heaven and earth, as if the forces of the entire sky and land were being drawn in.\n\"What a formidable presence...\"\nOriginally poised to explode with victory in his sight, Gross paused his surge of fighting qi for a moment.\nHis gaze was fixed on that dark sky in the distance, on the huge shadow descending from the sky, emanating a terrifying aura.\nIn an instant, his eyes focused intently.\nPowerful, exceedingly powerful!\nThis was definitely not the level of a mere Silver Level. The oppressive force rolling in was as strong as the most formidable enemies Gross had ever faced in his life.\n\"Wasn't it said to be only at the Silver Level? How could it be this powerful? Or has the Blue Young Dragon grown to such an extent in just two short years?\"\nIn an instant, many thoughts flashed through his mind.\nHowever, this is just right!\n\"The stronger, the more interesting! Hahaha!\"\nGross laughed heartily, his voice like a tsunami sweeping away mountains, while he stomped on the ground, unleashing a burst of unparalleled power from beneath his feet.\nBOOM!!!\nLike an earthquake, the ground collapsed instantly, as if crushed by an invisible force, causing large swaths of earth to crumble and bounce up.\nThe elite Blood Claw warriors around him were caught off guard by the crushing tremor and had trouble keeping their footing.\nAt the same time, with the forceful explosion, Gross shot up like a cannonball, heading straight for Austin high in the sky.\nFacing that overwhelming pressure descending from the sky, Gross advanced without retreating, charging head-on!\n\"Die!!!\"\nWaves of vast blood-red fighting qi erupted from within his body, rising from his feet, making Gross appear like an angry golden Buddha.\nThe blood-red fighting qi spewed out around him and coalesced in the air, forming a gigantic blood-red phantom.\nThe phantom seemed like a fierce ancient deity from the primordial times, exuding a terrifying, murderous aura that permeated every corner of the horizon, causing all the Beastmen below to pause under its ferocious pressure.\n\"Long live Lord Grom!\"\n\"It has appeared, Lord Gross's reversion to an ancestral form! This is the first warrior of our Blood Claw Tribe!\"\nAs that blood-red, ferocious phantom appeared in the sky, the elite Blood Claw warriors became fervent, their eyes filled with fanaticism as they looked skyward.\nThe reversion to ancestral bloodline is a legend passed down among many Beastman races within the Kawa Great Forest.\nThe legend says that Beastmen blessed by the Beast God possess the powerful bloodline of their ancestors. If one can activate the ancestral bloodline within, not only can their strength increase drastically in a short time, but the door to becoming Legendary is almost opened to them.\nDespite the lore's enticing allure, in reality, the occurrence of such a reversion is so rare—about one in several hundred thousand—that many tribes never witness this legendary bloodline ability in their lifetimes.\nGrom's ability to dominate the entire Blood Claw Tribe and be willingly hailed by all Blood Claw Beastmen as the tribe's first warrior is not unrelated to his display of ancestral bloodline reversion.\nIt was through this reversion to an ancestral bloodline that Gross once slew multiple Gold Level Lord of Magical Beasts, one of which was even of High Tier Gold.\nSuch illustrious battle achievements earned him the respect and admiration of all the Blood Claw Beastmen.\nEven other Beastman tribes harbor admiration for such a warrior.\nGross is considered a heroic figure, a paragon of pride for the Blood Claw Tribe.\nAnd now, under the powerful Lord Gross, another glorious achievement is about to be added,\nthat is,\nDragon slaying!\nTo slay this dragon and earn the renown of a Dragon Slayer Warrior.\nIn their hearts, all the elite Blood Claw warriors are filled with unwavering confidence!\nMeanwhile, high above in the sky, the blood-red, ferocious phantom was slowly solidifying.\nHe raised his head and clenched his fist!\nA punch was thrown!\nEndless blood-red light gathered, forming a fist capable of destroying space and all things in the heavens, like a massive mountain descending from the sky, crushing down towards Austin.\n\"Ancestral bloodline reversion, legendary seed!\"\nFacing the blood-red brilliance that was surging towards him, Austin's gaze grew solemn as he stirred the colossal torrent between heaven and earth.\nAfter activating the ancestral bloodline, one's strength could multiply several times.\nAlthough this burst was temporary, its mighty power needed no words to describe it.\nEspecially with Gross already being a Gold Level warrior rich in combat experience, this amplification was even more terrifying.\nBut, so what?\nHe, Austin, bore the legendary bloodline of the Giant Dragon Race!\n\"Begone!\"\nWith a voice like rolling thunder, Austin thrust out a claw, like an iron claw cast in steel, seemingly tearing through space, carrying an overwhelming force like an all-enveloping storm smashing down.\nBOOM!!!\nIn a sky-shattering collision, the entire world seemed to tremble, with the air visibly transforming into waves and surging in the high sky, then becoming a towering gust that toppled trees and lifted clouds of dust and debris.\nCrackle!\nAt the same time, countless strands of azure lightning burst from Austin's claw, tearing through the air, with electric snakes writhing in the void, dyeing half the sky blue.\nIn an instant, swirling storm currents swept up, engulfing the sky with flying dust and stones, as if it were the end of the world!\nThe vast forces clashed in the air, evenly matched, neither side able to overpower the other!\nBang bang bang bang....\nThe sky seemed divided into red and blue halves, with two forces colliding, causing continuous explosions and sending intense torrents across the sky, transforming into a category eighteen windstorm spreading in all directions.\nBOOM BOOM BOOM...\nThe shockwaves from the collision converged into a torrent, with the fierce wind blowing down the houses of the Dragon Nest Tribe. Meanwhile, from Austin's location, streaks of thunder broke the air and continually crashed into the ground, creating a series of explosions.\nHundreds of meters apart in the sky, yet the impact of their confrontation left the land in complete disarray.",

      "content": "Under the immense impact, large swathes of houses began to collapse, and much of the town buildings in the Dragon Nest Tribe's station suffered varying degrees of destruction.\nAt the breach in the city walls, both the Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers and the Blood Claw Tribe elites were significantly affected, yet the brutal slaughter continued.\nPeople kept dying, their blood staining the snow red, and corpses lay stiff on the ground.\nMost of the collapsed city walls turned into a battlefield, amid dense clashes, the impacts of Fighting Qi exploded continuously.\nThe Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers formed a tight military formation. Although their individual combat power was not strong in this Extraordinary battlefield, they could assist the Beastman Officers in encircling and killing the Blood Claw elites.\nAt this time, the Beastmen soldiers within the Dragon Nest Tribe were the elite chosen from tens of thousands of Beastmen of the whole tribe.\nWith strengthening from Giant Beast Meat and regular training, as well as the cultivation of various Breathing Techniques, these ordinary Beastmen soldiers had physiques several times stronger than regular Beastmen.\nAdditionally, with excellent equipment, small teams of a dozen formed a unit, capable of facing off against Bronze Level Extraordinary Beastmen elites.\nThe storm sweeping from the sky caused a brief pause in the bloody battlefield, but it soon became even more frenzied.\nLacking Grom, the Dragon Nest Tribe had a numerical advantage over the elite attackers from the Blood Claw Tribe, and their mid-to-high-level combat power was also comparable, overall giving the Dragon Nest Tribe an edge in battle.\nIn the brutal slaughter, Blood Claw elites were continuously being encircled and killed.\nRumble!\nUp in the sky, the turbulent Fighting Qi surged, interspersed with lightning.\nSeeing the prior collision's destructive impact on the painstakingly constructed town below, and with the Dragon Nest Tribe holding the advantage at the city gate, the general outcome of the battle seemed inevitable.\nAustin then engaged while retreating, moving in a direction away from the tribe's station.\nGrom, worthy of being the Blood Claw Tribe's first warrior, had an astonishing range of combat experience. After activating his Ancestral Bloodline, his combat power doubled, and his violent Fighting Qi blasted out. Within a short time, it was unclear how many hundreds or thousands of punches he had unleashed, his terrifying, raging punch force exploding with Fighting Qi, whipping up colossal waves in the air.\nThe frightful power of these repeated collisions left even Austin's nearly impenetrable Scale Armor Defense with tingling claws.\nThis made Austin realize that the person before him was an unprecedentedly formidable opponent.\nAn enemy impossible to defeat in a short time,\nTo overcome him, Austin would have to go all-out, using every means at his disposal.\nEven just the aftershocks from the initial exchanges had destroyed over half of the Dragon Nest Town below, so Austin couldn't choose a battlefield near here.\n\"Damn gray bear, if you have the guts, then come and chase me!\"\nAustin roared in a low voice, his massive wings fanning in the sky, creating a great torrent. Surrounded by the storm and lightning, he flew toward the distance.\n\"Hahaha! Want to pick a nice place for your grave, do you? I'll oblige you!\"\nGross sneered, not caring about the situation of the war below. Landing on the ground from the sky, he stomped with one foot, and his whole form shot out like a cannonball in pursuit of Austin.\nHowever, what no one noticed was that Gross, usually so direct in words and actions, casually glanced over the battlefield with a barely perceptible cold smile before his entire figure vanished.\nWith those two oppressive presences departing, the war outside the Dragon Nest Tribe immediately escalated in intensity.\n\"Crush them! For the prince!\"\n\"Slaughter them all!\"\nAnother fierce clash of over a thousand men occurred, the metallic clangs mingling with the splattering blood, painting vast stretches of snow red, and the ground littered with corpses.\nOnly death could end this war.\n...\nMeanwhile, at the hill where Austin had previously been cultivating, a terrifying aura rose, rolling in from the sky and veiling the white sky with dark clouds.\nAmidst the vast torrents, Austin descended from the top of the air, landing instantly on a mountaintop.\nSimultaneously, Gross followed closely, slamming down on a nearby mountain summit, his formidable power exploding and shattering the rocks atop.\n\"Gray bear, who are you?\"\nThe gray bear before him gave Austin a vague sense of familiarity, yet Austin was sure he had never seen this person before.\nNevertheless, it was this person who led a group of elite Extraordinary Beastmen to suddenly attack his Clan Tribe.\nIt didn't seem like a spur-of-the-moment idea; it was as if there was some undying hatred, with the target appearing to be himself and the tribe he had developed.\nThough Austin had transmigrated into a dragon, he considered himself inherently kind-hearted.\nOver the years, he mostly stayed nearby, developing himself quietly, avoiding trouble. Even if his subordinates annexed and killed Beastmen from other tribes, it was the various Clans that were responsible; he seldom acted himself, and there seemed to be few Beastmen who died at his hands.\nHe considered himself a good dragon, whose bloodshed was far less than that of his kin.\nHow could such a kind-hearted dragon provoke this oblivious fellow into trying to kill him?\nAustin felt a tremendous sense of indignation course through him, reaching into the heavens!\nSo he decided to ask about this fellow's background before beating him to death.\n\"My name is Gross, the first warrior of the Blood Claw Tribe! Blue Young Dragon, two years ago, the Grom you killed was my brother! Have you thought of how you want to die?\"\nGross sneered at Austin across from him, as if looking at a dead dragon.\n\"So you're here to avenge your brother?\"\nAustin narrowed his eyes and stared at Gross opposite him.\n\"That's right! Today, whether you go to heaven or earth, you are doomed!\"\nGross stared intently at Austin, his eyes filled with resentment.\nAustin maintained his composure, nodding slightly, seeming lost in thought.\nAvenging family, that was a reason.\nBut... something just felt off.\nStaring into Gross's resentful eyes, a sudden enlightenment struck Austin as he suddenly said to Gross:\n\"No, you're lying.\"\nGross's eyelids twitched slightly, but his expression remained unchanged, showing no emotion.\nAustin continued on his own:\n\"You're lying, you came here to kill me not for avenging that so-called brother of yours; the reason you want to kill me is because of something else, something that drove you to fury... and so you came to seek revenge on me. Perhaps, in this journey, there are other plans you need to fulfill.\"\n\"Oh, is that what you think?\"\nGross gave no affirmation nor denial, his pupils contracted slightly, yet the previous resentment dispersed, as if nothing had happened.\nHe watched Austin intently, seemingly waiting for him to provide an explanation.",

      "content": "Upon seeing Gros's expression change like that, Austin was even more certain of his suspicions.\nWhen he initially planned to shift the battlefield, Austin clearly noticed the fight between the Dragon Nest Tribe and the invading enemy below. The Dragon Nest Tribe had already gained the upper hand, and the elite Blood Claw forces were obviously on the verge of being annihilated by the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nHowever, this fellow named Gros showed no reaction. Instead, he followed Austin's intention and shifted the battlefield together.\nAustin didn't know what the purpose of activating those elite Blood Claws and their attack was, but this Gros clearly had high popularity among his subordinates, yet he didn't care at all about the lives of his comrades.\nThis kind of mentality suggests that he might be indifferent to his so-called brother's death. If he encounters the murderer in the future, maybe then he might act, but how could he have crossed mountains and endured the harsh winter just to seek revenge?\nPerhaps in this world, there are people who disregard the lives of others but value their own family immensely, but intuition told Austin that Gros was definitely not such a person.\nWhat further confirmed Austin's belief that Gros had another purpose in seeking revenge was the change in his character before and after.\nDuring the initial battle, the impression of this fellow was of a straightforward, reckless beastman who wore his emotions on his sleeve.\nYet, after leaving the Dragon Nest Tribe's battlefield, Gros's expression gradually changed, filled with anger, resentment, distortion, and ferocity, looking at Austin with a deep-seated hatred.\nThe stark contrast between the before and after suggests this person named Gros must have been pretending all along, feigning simplicity and straightforwardness.\nOnly after leaving familiar subordinates did he show his true colors.\nHe was hiding his true personality.\nWhy disguise himself in front of his companions?\nIf it were simply about revenge, how could his reactions be so inconsistent?\nAll these factors together suggest one possible explanation for this situation,\nwhich is that Gros is something like a spy, hidden within the Blood Claw Tribe for some purpose.\nIt's even possible that in this attack, Gros accepted some plan from the Blood Claw Tribe but made changes midway, like letting his accompanying subordinates be destroyed, to trigger a larger conspiracy.\nIf Austin knew the task Rulga gave Gros was to destroy Austin and all his clan beastmen, and if Rulga had decided to assassinate Austin, and considering Gros's actions of letting the elite Blood Claws be annihilated, one might draw further conclusions.\nBut what he knows now is enough for him to surmise certain things!\nAs one of the top tribes in the Kawa Great Forest, to think that the Blood Claw Tribe's champion is a spy is astonishing.\nThis conjecture is something nobody would believe if told.\nBut Austin remembered that famous detective from his past life who once said: in a case, the more impossible something seems, the more likely it is true.\nGros is very likely a pawn spy planted in the Blood Claw Tribe by certain forces!\nAs a spy, to remain hidden in the Blood Claw Tribe for so long without discovery shows that Gros is very adept at concealing himself.\nYet such an excellent spy, after leaving the battlefield, displayed a venomous glare at Austin.\nThis only indicates one thing: Austin's actions unintentionally disrupted a very critical plan of his, causing him to nearly lose his composure.\n\"Gros, you are a spy, a spy placed in the Blood Claw Tribe by other forces.\"\nThe moment he mentioned \"spy,\" Austin keenly noticed a flicker in Gros's eyes, confirming his belief even further.\nWhat was once speculation now, with Gros's reaction, is highly likely true.\n\"I must have unintentionally disrupted some of your plans, that's why you seek revenge, or at least that's one reason. You came to kill me with an even greater purpose in mind.\"\nAustin began to recount his past experiences, narrating them thoroughly.\n\"Grom is your brother, so it's very possible he was involved in that plan.\"\n\"Grom was ordered to establish a Blood Claw division nearby, reportedly to set up a warning outpost, to monitor the movements of mutated undead, and if necessary, buy time for the Tribe Alliance.\"\n\"Your plan is related to this outpost, or rather this outpost is the biggest part of your plan. I killed Grom and replaced the outpost, becoming one of the Tribe Alliance's supports, causing devastating damage to your plan...\"\n\"The outpost's primary function is to serve as a warning, could it be...\"\nAustin's eyes suddenly widened, filled with disbelief.\nAccording to his analysis, there was a mastermind behind the undead zombie horde, orchestrating everything, a sentient entity guiding all these events.\nAnd Grom and their plan were connected to the outpost, considering the outpost's role...\nCould it be that Gros and his group are in league with the mastermind behind the zombies?!!\nAt this moment, Austin felt his heart race.\nIf that's true, the outpost being infiltrated means that when the Tribe Alliance beastmen attack the Border Great Wall, the undead zombie army would suddenly unleash a rear assault.\nGiven the characteristics of the undead zombies and the loosely organized Tribe Alliance, there's a high probability that hundreds of thousands or even millions of beastmen would be wiped out, becoming part of the undead horde!\nIf that mastermind really succeeds in this conspiracy, with millions in new forces, they could likely sweep across the entire Kawa Great Forest!\nAfter Austin destroyed Grom's outpost and took its place, he quickly exposed the movements of the undead army to the Tribe Alliance, making the Beastman Alliance alert, thus the previous surprise attack plan naturally fell apart!\n\"You all, are actually people from the side of the mutated undead!\"\nAustin was filled with disbelief,\neven though this hypothesis was uncertain, the reality likely indicates as much!\nMutated undead, Beastman Alliance, humans... Austin felt as if he was caught in a giant vortex.\n\"You, I really underestimated you, it's no wonder you could grow to this point as a mere orphaned dragon without parents... But so what, die now!\"\nAs Austin finished speaking, Gros's face twisted fiercely, an aura of terror surged skyward, like a mountain fallen from the heavens, rolling toward Austin!\nAustin's expression turned incredibly grave, surrounded by dazzling lightning, reflecting his extremely grim visage.\nIt seems his suspicions were indeed correct.\nBut what exactly is behind the undead army orchestrating all this?!!",

      "content": "Austin was very afraid of death. Having died once before, he understood the preciousness of life even more.\nIt was for this reason that ever since Austin traversed into this world, he had been quietly developing his field in this corner, hoping to achieve invincibility before venturing out to explore and take a good look at this world.\nIn these years, he succeeded halfway—successfully advancing to the Gold Level, and his Clan Tribe had grown and expanded, with their combined military strength being top-notch within the entire range of the Kawa Great Forest.\nHaving built such a powerful military group, few outside knew about this strong tribal force in that area.\nBut he also failed halfway because the region where the Dragon Nest Tribe was located unfortunately became a stronghold for the Beastman Alliance to fend off the mutated Undead, attracting a powerful threat from Grom and others of the Blood Claw Tribe.\nFor self-preservation and development, Austin had to act first to destroy the Blood Claw Tribe's stronghold division, but at the same time, he provoked the top-tier force of the Blood Claw Tribe within the Kawa Great Forest and unintentionally disrupted plans of some lurking people.\nLater, due to a relic left by a Gold Level Great Mage, human mercenaries found their way to the area near the Dragon Nest Tribe, discovered their secret, and were drawn to murder by the tribe's displayed potential.\nTo build such a massive tribal force from scratch within two years was indeed incredible, and what made Edward act without hesitation was the orderly discipline shown by the beastmen tribe during routine production activities.\nIt was a sprout of a new civilization, new power. From the orderly production of the Dragon Nest Tribe, he saw an immensely threatening power. Considering himself a noble elite, he naturally launched an attack on Austin for the interest of countless people.\nThen, with the failure of Edward's attack and the death of the main culprit, the Dragon Nest Tribe originally intended to enter a new period of recuperation and development.\nUnfortunately, at this time, a new round of crisis came face to face.\nCountless zombie undead swept the land, and the Calamity spread to the vicinity of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThis might have been a plan originally agreed with Grom in the Blood Claw stronghold, intending to use countless undead zombies to completely annihilate the hundreds of thousands of beastmen gathered around the Bloody Border in one go.\nBut unfortunately, Grom was killed by Austin, and the Blood Claw Tribe's stronghold was subsequently uprooted by Austin, who then used the Blood Claw people to establish contact with the Tribe Alliance.\nPerhaps, it was exactly a series of unexpected changes later that caused the ultimate failure of the plot from the undead zombie side.\nAustin was not privy to the prelude or consequences of these events, not having a God's perspective, and naturally, he didn't know many things.\nHowever, his innate fear of death made him fond of pondering.\nEspecially under the immense pressure of the zombie undead Calamity, Austin began to think, piecing together the situation he was in using the few clues he had.\nThe Tribe Alliance, mutated Evil Spirits, humans... even suspected transdimensional travelers, the Beastman Empire, some mysterious organization, Pure-blooded Beastmen, even the Beast God—he had pondered over all these chaotic existences.\nIn his spare time, he ran hundreds of thousands of simulations regarding everything in the forest in his mind, and he even placed himself in various factions.\nThe reason he could infer from Gross's behavior that the Blood Claw Tribe's top warrior was a spy for the zombie undead side was not because he was possessed by Sherlock Holmes, but it was the result of relentless thought due to a strong survival instinct!\nThe intense survival instinct caused Austin, who initially believed power was everything, to begin using his brain to analyze problems.\nCountless speculations, combined with Gross's bizarre changes, led Austin to those series of terrifying conjectures.\nHowever, having made these conjectures and confirmed this point through dealing with Gross, Austin did not feel any happiness or pride, but rather an immense headache.\nCompared to believing Gross and Grom were spies for the mutated Evil Spirit side, Austin hoped all these were just coincidences.\nBut now, Gross's reaction broke all his hopes.\nGross had a problem, a big problem!\nAnd this meant that the Dragon Nest Tribe was about to get caught in a huge whirlpool.\nHowever, now, he only had a glimpse of the curtain veiling the vast territory of tens of millions of kilometers of the Kawa Great Forest.\nThis war between the undead and the living, what was it launched for, and what were the hidden hands behind these multiple layers of curtains planning? And what were those lurking Legends doing? Why weren't they stopping it?\nToo many questions were destined to go unanswered.\nBut merely from one or two arrangements on the zombie undead side, they could almost easily annihilate the hundreds of thousands of beastmen gathered at the Bloody Border, demonstrating the terror of those behind the scenes.\n\"Something's off, something's terribly off! Is this guy really a Beastman? He's even more cunning than treacherous humans!\"\nTo infiltrate a super-large tribe and become the tribe's top warrior without any suspicion—it was surprising.\nThis guy named Gross is far too capable, comparable to the elite spies from Austin's previous life who've undergone numerous training, his cunning far eclipsing that of humans, making him seem more human.\nAustin couldn't help but feel a surge of enormous doubt,\nWhere did the Beastmen truly come from?!\nIn the construction of the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin had realized that the intellectual capability of the gathered Clan Beastmen seemed slightly higher than those of the smaller tribes, and after annexing and integrating those smaller tribe beastmen, they seemed to gain intellectual enhancement as a group.\nIn these years of construction, the beastmen had even been influenced by Austin's way of thinking, gradually transitioning towards modern society's high efficiency, and beginning various research and innovation, to the point that the Goblin Manufacturing Workshop could successfully produce exquisite armor, and they started seeking to forge stronger Bronze Alloy, combining some wild giant beast materials to develop more powerful equipment.\nThis autonomous ability to think, Austin initially believed was merely the result of his own influence.\nBut now, Austin couldn't help but question,\nIf Beastmen themselves didn't possess a certain degree of intelligence, how could they be able to mimic, learn, and innovate independently?\nThese beastmen didn't seem at all like the simple-minded, thick-limbed single-cell organisms depicted in fantasy works from his previous life; rather, beyond their peculiar appearances, the characteristics they exhibited were nearly indistinguishable from humans!\nYet at this moment, Austin didn't have the luxury to think more.\nThe enemy before him had already fallen right in front of him!",

      "content": "Chapter 236: Chapter 232: Battle at the Peak\nBoom!!!\nFighting Qi burst from Gross’s entire body like an erupting lava volcano, with bloody Qi surging out, transforming into smoke and rising to the sky. Within a radius of a hundred meters, everything was flooded with this unstoppable Fighting Qi impact, which surged like a tsunami.\n\"Die!\"\nThe enormous figure, god-like and demon-like, suddenly rose into the air, with the tremendous power that exploded from its feet shattering the ground beneath it inch by inch.\nGross shot out like a massive meteor, tearing through the air with a deafening sonic boom. His entire body in the sky unleashed thousands of fist shadows that swept across the void, seemingly shattering the air.\n\"Angry and humiliated, are we?\"\nAustin’s voice spoke indifferently, and his figure rose into the air as well. His enormous wings whipped up a massive torrent, and the terrifying dragon’s might spread across the sky, covering the heavens with dark clouds and dimming the daylight, as if a mountain was pressing down on the air.\nZizz!\nLightning flickered in the void, as Austin, commanding the thunder, streaked across the sky. His colossal claws, capable of tearing space apart, encompassed half the world’s Power, crashing straight ahead.\nRumble!!!\nCollision, impact, violence!\nExplosions continuously burst in the air, with vast Fighting Qi shooting out like a tsunami. The airflow erupted with constant explosions, shaking the air as if like glass, quickly trembling, and about to shatter.\nGross unleashed hundreds or thousands of punches in a short time. The continuous fist shadows stirred the air into waves like a sea tsunami, containing a tremendous Inner Strength.\nWith relentless Cultivation, striking at waterfalls day and night, the terrifying force made tons and tons of waterfalls reverse upwards. Even if a mountain or a giant peak stood in front, it would be shattered.\nAustin did not retreat either. Electric Snakes danced wildly in the void, with lightning shooting upwards like indestructible laser beams, sweeping across the earth and shattering it.\nThe lightning pierced, shattering the terrifying bloody fist shadows sweeping through the air like a flood, with the condensed Fighting Qi dispersing as they collided with each other.\nThis was pure destruction and explosive battle. One man and one dragon fought from sky to ground, charging left and right, with the terrifying forces from the collision sweeping through, annihilating large areas of forest into fragments, and hills and mountains crumbling under the powerful explosions.\nThe entire land was subjected to a saturation bombardment akin to doomsday, leaving the earth in ruins, with massive craters forming one after another, cracks crumbling and spreading.\nBetween heaven and earth, the aftermath of the Fighting Qi swept across the firmament and the earth, with the whole world feeling as if it had ushered in an apocalyptic disaster.\nAfter Gross activated his Ancestral Bloodline, the Fighting Qi in his body surged, causing the aftermath of Fighting Qi to shake the sky, with an imposing manner no less than a Gold Level peak Great Warrior.\nMeanwhile, although Austin had just entered the Gold Level, due to the Giant Dragon Bloodline, the Legendary Law within his body was gradually awakening. Even a trace was enough to grant him battle capabilities across different grades.\nAbove the sky, dark clouds rolled, blocking out the daylight.\nLightning exploded across the sky, with terrifying surges of Fighting Qi shooting down to the earth, causing terrible explosions one after another, with fiery flames erupting like a volcano.\nAt high altitude, the intense battle between one dragon and one man continued, neither able to overpower the other.\nThough the situation seemed stalemated, Gross was becoming increasingly anxious.\nActivating the Ancestral Bloodline for more Power wasn’t limitless; it had a time limit.\nIf he couldn’t kill his opponent within the limit, he would definitely be the one to fail!\n\"Damn it, what’s with this dragon, wasn’t it said to be only a Silver Level Young Dragon? How did it reach this level in just one or two years!\"\nGross cursed in his heart, his iron-clad fists possessing the force to break mountains, suddenly striking out and colliding with Austin’s giant claw surrounded by lightning, producing the sound of clashing metal. A visible shock wave swept forth.\nIt seemed Gross gained an advantage, but it was far from defeat.\nThe activated Ancestral Bloodline had a time limit, but Austin’s Giant Dragon Bloodline did not.\nOn the contrary, in this close-combat fight, Austin felt his blood boiling, with a trace of Origin Law deep within the bloodline becoming active with the heated blood.\nInvisible yet tangible momentum filled the void, with the power of thunder starting to become more potent, though imperceptibly, as the whole world grew more oppressive, as if something overwhelmingly terrifying was slowly awakening.\nGross was unaware of the changes occurring within Austin, but as an experienced warrior, he sensed if things continued this way, the outcome might not be favorable.\n\"Rasengan!\"\nAmid Gross’s momentary distraction, looking fierce like a raging lion, Austin seized the opportunity. While his massive steel claws blocked Gross’s fist, he opened his menacing maw.\nThe humming sound resonated, and instantly, a basketball-sized white Rasengan formed, with a fierce hurricane emerging, and he spat it out.\nWith the Rasengan distorting the surrounding air, it carried terrifying tearing Power and almost hit Gross directly.\nGross, the Blood Claw Tribe’s foremost warrior with rich battle experience, instinctively shifted his head at the critical moment. The terrifying Rasengan tore through the air, whistling past his ear.\nBoom!!!\nThe dodged Rasengan struck the ground, unleashing a terrifying Power, with a giant ball of light colliding rapidly. The rotating Magic Power possessed fearsome tearing capabilities that shredded the surrounding trees and soil to pieces, creating a giant circular pit on the ground.\nFeeling the astonishing momentum behind him, Gross’s heart filled with shock and anger.\nIf the Rasengan had hit his face, he’d be severely wounded if not killed.\nEven barely dodging the frontal attack, as the Rasengan whistled past his head ripping through air, it still managed to cut off half his ear, with blood dripping from his shoulder.\nDamn it! This dragon has such methods!\nAnd the dragon might have additional strength!\nI’ll go all out!\nI can’t just sit and wait; I must fight with all my might!\nIn an instant, Gross steeled his resolve to fight desperately. The Fighting Qi in his body, which was about to deplete, suddenly surged again.\n\"Divine Blessing: Bear Fury!!!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 237: Chapter 233 Collision\nBoom!!!\nAn overwhelming aura suddenly surged upwards, Gross seemed to transform into an erupting volcano, with scorching heat twisting the air and shocking the sky.\nSuddenly, as if something terrifying within Gross slowly awakened, releasing boundless rage and fear, like a tidal wave crashing against the entire world.\nAt that moment, Austin felt a terrifying fear enveloping his heart, as if he was about to experience a sensation of earth-shattering destruction.\nInside the massive membrane-winged cave, the entire figure flickered as a shadow and retreated, spiraling and soaring tens of meters into the high sky.\nUnder the dark cloudy sky, the daylight dimmed, Austin’s wings spread open like a cross, with lightning bolts bursting forth, his eyes aghast while gazing at the enormous body exuding a terrifying aura on the ground.\n\"What is this!!!\"\nThe blood-colored Fighting Qi erupting from Gross slowly shifted from blood red to gray-black, like world-ending flames of annihilation, fuelling an aura of fear and ominousness.\nThe phantom behind him was intensely solidified, more substantial than before, as if it was transitioning from illusion to real existence on earth.\nThe ferocious giant bear’s phantom suddenly opened its crimson eyes, exerting overwhelming pressure as if moving mountains and seas.\nTerrifying, yet incredibly powerful!\nFrom the increasingly solid shadow enveloping Gross, Austin sensed an intensely strong threat, as if he might perish the next moment!\n\"Hoo!\"\nAbove the sky, amidst the stormy thunder, Austin exhaled a long breath, dense electric arcs spewing out between his nostrils.\nIn the icy winter world, the ground was covered by vast expanses of snow, white as far as the eye could see.\nAbove in the high skies, clouds churned, lightning and thunder roared.\nRasengan!\nBefore him, the void suddenly twisted, amidst the violent storm and thunder, a massive amount of Magic Power surged, forming an enormous vortex in the void, compressing the Magic Power into a basketball-sized Magic Rasengan.\nWhile extreme compression of Magic Power was happening, wind attribute forces were gradually gathering within, transforming from non-attributed Magic Power to Wind Element within the highly compressed spinning Magic Rasengan.\nCountless sharp blade-like wind elements amassed within the Magic Rasengan in front of Austin, the highly compressed spinning wind element power even altered the surrounding weather phenomena.\nVisible whirlwinds spiraled around, with lightning bolts shooting, piercing the sky, an unsettling power intensely compressed and gathered.\nRoar!!!\nPerhaps sensing the pressure from Austin, an oceanic Fighting Qi erupted from Gross, like a volcano suppressed for ages, with air vibrating fiercely, surging outwards like a once-in-a-century gigantic tsunami.\nGross roared fiercely, veins bulging on his forehead, the surrounding ground cracked inch by inch, with fearsome airflow surging upwards, toppling large patches of soil, blotting out the sky.\nAt the peak of his aura, Gross attacked.\nDivine Blessing: Bear Fury!\nWhether it was truly a Divine Gift was unknown, but the extraordinarily powerful force explosively gathered at that moment truly broke through limits.\nA colossal beam of light seemingly pierced the heavenly void, spanning three thousand miles, sweeping across from the earth to the sky, obliterating everything in its path, dimming and dazzling the world’s light.\nMeanwhile, the Rasengan formed by Austin, infused with Wind Element transformation and amassed Magic Power, blasted out.\nA powerful airflow swept between heaven and earth, with the storm permeating the heavens, electric arcs bursting, showing no inferiority in power and momentum.\nBoom!!!\nIn an instant, it seemed as if the entire world froze at the moment of collision, creating a suffocating sense of oppression.\nThe intense pressure seemed to solidify space-time.\nIt resembled an instant, yet felt like eons.\nSpace shook violently like a mirror, with visible impact flashes sweeping explosively, as the fierce power clash finally commenced.\nThe immense and terrifying power’s collision erupted, with light akin to a blazing sun rising suddenly, swallowing the world like an overturning tsunami.\nUnder the horrifying explosive impact, the stormy thunder in the sky and the forest soil on the ground were destroyed like brittle debris.\nGross felt as if swept into an unstoppable energy storm, with his entire being cast hundreds of meters away by the storm before stabilizing.\nA dreadful storm ravaged the surroundings, massive patches of soil crumbling, surging upward in the air, with flourishing jungles vanishing entirely, exposing bare soil.\n\"Did it die?\"\nTen minutes later, a spot on the ground buried by soil and rubble exploded open, and Gross’ figure emerged.\nLooking around, the ground within a range of hundreds of meters had been completely devastated by the previous blast impact, the formerly dense forest trees vanished, leaving bare broken soil with not a single blade of grass visible.\nSmoke rolled, obscuring half the sky.\nAll was silent, leaving only this devastated land slowly rising in smoke.\nThe Blue Young Dragon seemed truly dead.\n\"What a formidable creature, in just a few years it grew to such a level... unfortunately, you took something that wasn’t yours... cough cough...\"\nGross clutched his chest, his towering figure suddenly half-kneeling to the ground, spitting out mouthfuls of blood, his face pale like paper.\nBlood splattered on the ground, dyeing the soil red.\nHe was severely injured, the phantom enveloping him long vanished, the overwhelming energy gradually dispersing and weakening.\nEven against an enemy, Gross had to admit the dragon was indeed powerful, and remarkably talented.\nBefore leaving the battlefield, the hundred elite warriors of the Blood Claw Tribe were suppressed by its Clan and seemed on the verge of annihilation.\nThe elite warriors brought were the most valiant of the Blood Claw Tribe, each a Bronze Level Extraordinary warrior or higher, combined with years of campaign experience from the Great Tribe, they were elite among elites.\nYet those Extraordinary elites were being suppressed by a tribe raised by a Young Dragon, seemingly about to be wiped out.\nThis ability to lead and develop a Clan tribe, among the entire Giant Dragon Race, might not be matched even by an adult Legendary Giant Dragon.\nMoreover, throughout the battle earlier, Gross noticed one thing.\nThose powerful \"Magic Bullet,\" were not the innate Magic of the Giant Dragon Species, but rather combat techniques created by the Young Dragon itself!",

      "content": "Chapter 238: Chapter 234 Thunder Law\nWhat a genius!\nMany extraordinary races use self-awakened talent magic, especially the Giant Dragon race, who are so favored by the heavens that they have no need to develop other combat techniques. Their ever-awakening talent magic is enough to make them invincible.\nThe ability to create one’s own combat techniques is a rarity even among humans.\nYet this dragon has succeeded, and the magic techniques it created are incredibly powerful.\nEven when he used the explosive power given by His Majesty, he nearly lost to the dragon.\nIf this dragon continues to grow, Gross is certain that it will become a legend in the future.\n\"What a pity, you did something you shouldn’t have done and took something you shouldn’t have taken.\"\nAfter recovering for a moment and barely suppressing his injuries, Gross stood up again and looked at the shattered land ahead, muttering softly.\nWith just a few clues, he could deduce certain things; the intelligence of this dragon was beyond Gross’s expectation.\nUnfortunately, it’s dead in the end.\nThinking about the mission that brought him here, Gross couldn’t help but sigh inwardly.\n\"His Majesty said that the thing can’t be absorbed below the legendary level and should still be inside the Dragon’s Nest...\"\nTaking a deep look at the ruins before him, half of the sky shrouded in dust, Gross turned to leave.\nGiven the greedy nature of dragons, the item should be inside the Dragon’s Nest.\nAnd now, with the right timing to go back, estimating that the elites of the Blood Claw Tribe have already suffered heavy losses, they probably can’t completely annihilate the entire clan of that dragon.\nAs for the scattered clan members, they might reappear at some opportune moment...\nGross took a few leaps, ready to fly away, while his mind continued to ponder over the secret message from the other side.\nRustle!\nA breeze suddenly rose beside him, brushing past.\nGross didn’t pay it any mind, thinking about how to deal with that Rulga guy when he returned.\nHaving stayed in the Blood Claw Tribe for so many years, he vaguely felt that the guy had started to suspect him. Perhaps this mission to annihilate the Blue Dragon had other calculations.\nBut fortunately, that idiot Grom is dead here, so there is an excuse.\nThe breeze gradually strengthened, dispersing the dust swirling over the huge, broken pit, revealing the surrounding scenery.\nGross’s figure suddenly paused, his wide eyes filled with disbelief.\nThe wind around him grew stronger, so much so that it made the fur on his body and the beast skins he wore flap noisily, and the pebbles on the ground began to roll and clatter under the force of the wind.\n\"This, this... how is this possible!!!\"\nRustle!\nAbove the sky, thick clouds covered the entire sky, the dark clouds obscured the sun, touching the sky directly.\nThe whole world seemed to plunge into darkness, massive dark clouds surged and roiled, spreading out for miles.\nBut a mile away, the sky was bright and clear, the snow vast and unending.\nThe world seemed divided apart.\nAs if the sky Gross found himself under was rejected by the heavens and earth!\n\"A domain! A domain! Could there really be a legendary adult Giant Dragon behind that young dragon?!\"\nGross’s head seemed about to explode; his body bristled with an icy coldness, like falling into an icy cave in the depths of winter, drenched head to toe in a bucket of cold water.\nActually, this was not a true domain.\nIt could only be considered a rudimentary feather form, riddled with defects within its range.\nBut now, Gross had no time to detect the flaws in the embryonic domain.\nBecause he could already feel the breath of the Legendary Law!\nRumble!!!\nBetween the clouds, deafening thunder roared constantly, bolts of lightning tore through the darkened earth.\nThe air felt as if it had been weighted down by a mountain, nearly crushing Gross into the ground.\nThe swirling dark clouds suddenly gathered together, forming a massive dark vortex skyward, light seemed to be devoured there.\nA streak of light abruptly appeared from the vortex’s black hole, instantly triggering a tempest of thunder elements within the world.\nAs if ten thousand bolts of thunder shot from beyond the heavens, the thunder attribute power in space became active, arcs of lightning shooting skyward, slicing through the space.\n\"Gross, do you have any last words?\"\nFrom the pitch-black sky above, a familiar voice resounded, rolling across every corner of the world like crashing thunder.\n\"Blue Dragon, how could you!!!\"\nIn the sky above, Austin hovered beneath the massive cloud vortex, storms and thunderstorms ravaging around him, ensconced within a terrifying and boundless cosmic catastrophe. Yet the rampant elemental energy from outside did not harm him in the slightest, as if he were a divine demon descended to the mortal realm.\nA ray of light blossomed before Austin, like a long needle.\nIt floated quietly in the air, constantly flickering and changing, yet seemingly motionless.\nClearly, it was only a hundred meters above in the sky, but it gave Gross a sense of an endless distance between the realms.\nThe Law!\nNo doubt, it was the Thunder Law!\nThough just a trace, that inescapable, unavoidable feeling could only be caused by the Law to suppress him so terribly!\nIt was a suppression above power level or tier!\n\"Ah! I don’t believe it!\"\nGross roared in rage, his originally mighty body suddenly withered like drained of moisture, his fur became gray and sparse.\nFearsome fighting qi surged skyward, as if turned into a sky-piercing blood-red pillar, shaking the entire space.\nHis aura became as violently turbulent as a stormy sea, as blinding as a scorching sun.\nHe burned his own life, erupting all his life’s blood qi in an instant, intending to launch an attack that pierced through heaven and earth!\n\"Is this your last words.\"\nThe indifferent voice was full of aloofness, like a divine demon overlooking all living beings.\n\"Go!\"\nThe tiny thread of Thunder Law, gathered from the blood within, swiftly descended from the heights.\nIn an instant,\nall the thunder elements within the domain were stirred into a furious commotion, thousands of bolts of lightning crackling and splitting, while that sliver of Thunder Law in mid-air turned into a thunder pillar piercing heaven and earth, rallying thousands of Thunder Liquid, ferociously crushing towards Gross!\nThe final strike that Gross delivered by burning his life, a blow seemingly capable of shattering the sky, was utterly consumed by the unimaginable divine prowess of the Thunder Law, its ceaseless and infinite lightning grinding his strength away.\n\"Ah! His Majesty will not spare you!\"\nGross could only manage a final, despairing scream, his entire being swallowed by the overwhelming thunderlight....",

      "content": "A tiny thread of the Thunder Law, barely the size of a hair, yet within the prototype domain created by Austin, it stirred the thunder attribute elements between heaven and earth, transforming into an endless sea of thunderous tides.\nGross was indeed strong, nearly breaking the limits after squeezing and unleashing his life force.\nBut the power of the Law is ultimately lofty, transcending the \"human\" level to become the Power of Heaven and Earth.\nThis is the suppression of hierarchy.\nCoupled with the endless thunder between heaven and earth, humans without a source ultimately find it hard to resist the divine power, eventually being consumed by the sea of thunder.\nA thousand bolts of lightning erupted, unleashing terrifying and boundless power.\nA horrific explosion erupted, flipping heaven and earth as blinding light spread to cover everything, with the piercing brilliance permeating every corner, and the terrifying energy shockwaves expanded in all directions, devouring and destroying everything.\nThe massive tremor accompanied the blinding light, spreading dozens of miles away, reaching the first outpost of the Dragon Nest Tribe, where they could feel the tremor coming from the tribe's core.\nMore than ten minutes later, the erupting power gradually calmed down.\nSensing that Gross's presence within the prototype domain had completely dissipated, only then did Austin withdraw this domain.\nThe clouds above slowly dispersed, the light of day shone down, and the oppressive aura within the domain also dissipated.\nSmoke and dust billowed, rising to cover half the sky.\nThe ground was fragmented and shattered, with the collapsed soil forming an irregular crater hundreds of meters wide, with cracks spreading in all directions, occasionally causing dirt and stones to fall from heights.\n\"It's over.\"\nA mighty gust of wind blew away the dust at the center of the crater, and Austin's figure descended from the sky.\nAt the bottom of the crater, a charred head lay quietly embedded in the soil, its limbs and torso were already reduced to ashes in the thunderous bombardment.\n\"What a pity.\"\nIndeed a pity, such a powerful beastman warrior, if he could have been subdued, he would have added an extremely strong force to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nBut Austin understood well that Gross would never submit.\nEven if he did submit, he wouldn't dare accept him under his command.\nTherefore, he could only kill him thoroughly.\nWho told him to provoke me?\n\"I didn't expect to gain such a harvest this time. Speaking of which, I really should thank this guy, the Thunder Law...\"\nIn contemplation, Austin gathered his spirit, then a crack opened in the void before him, and an incomparably bright light burst forth, leaping uncertainly in the void like a living thing.\nAt the moment the light appeared, the thunder attribute elements in heaven and earth were stirred, with lightning cracking and exploding, and the clouds above gathered under an unseen force.\nThe Law!\nThe Thunder Law!\nAustin clearly felt it, for when the thread of Law appeared, the thunder attribute elements between heaven and earth erupted into violent turmoil, and the Elemental Magic Power boiled at that moment.\n\"So this is the Thunder Law...\"\nA strange brilliance shone in Austin's eyes, which were filled with longing.\nThis was the innate desire of a creature for higher-level power.\nDuring the previous battle with Gross, every collision seemed to ignite and boil Austin's bloodline within.\nThe Thunder Law hidden in the bloodline began to awaken under the fierce combat, finally materializing and manifesting in the world.\nThis was the origin of Austin's thread of Thunder Law.\nAwakened in battle, condensed in battle.\nWith this thread of Thunder Attribute Law power, Austin's strength was significantly enhanced.\nThis battle, the awakening of a thread of Thunder Law, was undoubtedly the greatest reward of this encounter.\n\"The Thunder Law, so this is it...\"\nAlthough it was just a thread of Law, relying on his Giant Dragon Bloodline traits to barely control it, experiencing that near-origin power up close had given Austin many insights, furthering his understanding of thunder.\nMastery over thunder belongs to the power of the Blue Dragon, which is the result of the continuous awakening of the Thunder Law contained within the Blue Dragon's bloodline.\nSensing that thread of Thunder Law energy also helped Austin understand many long-standing doubts.\nFor example, the reason he could grow quickly within a few years was that he continually stimulated himself with electricity, drawing from his wild ideas of thunder tempering his body from his past life, and even when weak, the innate magic he released always carried a hint of Thunder Law essence, and it was this essence that continually modified his body.\nAs the Thunder Law essence influenced his body, it resonated with the Thunder Law hidden in his bloodline, constantly circulating and stimulating, thereby under the influence of the Thunder Law, his strength rapidly increased, with the Thunder Law within continuously enhancing.\nUntil today's battle with Gross, years of continuous stimulation finally broke through the final barrier under external pressure, activating a thread of Thunder Law.\nThe reason he could modify beastmen, activating the extraordinary seeds within ordinary beastmen, was precisely because of that trace of Thunder Law essence hidden in the lightning he created.\nThe Thunder Law essence resonated with the magic power within the Magic Stone, subsequently affecting the beastman bodies, thereby activating the extraordinary seeds within them.\nThis was how Austin was able to modify the beastmen.\n\"No wonder they say a Giant Dragon is a treasure trove; bathing in dragon blood nearly means the door to becoming a legend is opened completely. I see, the blood laws of an adult Giant Dragon have fully awakened and been released, so bathing in dragon blood is almost like facing the direct wash of the Law itself; how can one not reach legendary...\"\nJust thinking of this made Austin feel a chill throughout his body.\nAn adult Giant Dragon possesses Legendary Level strength, yet there are still people in this world daring to kill a dragon for its blood.\nOnce news of him awakening a thread of thunder origin got out, a young dragon at the Gold Level, possessing such a heavy treasure, could attract countless formidable beings.\n\"In the future, unless I can destroy the enemy completely, the Thunder Law must not be easily exposed!\"\nIn an instant, Austin had made up his mind.\nThis thread of Thunder Law would be his greatest trump card.\nAt the same time, it would be his key to opening the door to the Law and stepping into the Legendary.\nUntil he had sufficient self-preserving power, he must not easily reveal it, or he would face utter ruin.\n\"Time to go.\"\nSeeing no more living creatures around, Austin had no further attachments and was ready to leave.\nThinking for a moment before leaving, he grabbed the charred skull at the bottom of the crater, his massive form rising into the sky, flying toward the direction of the Dragon Nest Tribe.",

      "content": "When Austin returned to the tribe, the war that had taken place in front of the Dragon Nest Tribe's stronghold was nearing its end.\nThe Beastman Officers, who had been trained and practiced the Beastman Six Techniques created by Austin, were enough to contend with the blood claw elites, with not much difference in high and mid-level combat strength.\nHowever, in the battle of the lower-level strength, there was a one-sided situation.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe's beastman soldiers had undergone strict and orderly training, their equipment was extremely sophisticated, and their numbers were several times that of the Blood Claw side.\nAs a result, the lower-level strength of the blood claw elites faced a one-sided situation and were quickly slaughtered by the Dragon Nest Beastman forces.\nThe regular Dragon Nest beastman soldiers who were freeing up teamed together in squads, and with the cooperation of the extraordinary Beastmen, gradually surrounded and killed the extraordinary among the blood claw elites.\nWhen Austin appeared over the Dragon Nest Tribe, the soldiers of the Dragon Nest Tribe's war completely entered the victory-purging stage.\n\"Your commander has been killed, surrender and you won't be executed!\"\nWith a thunderous roar, Gross's head fell from the sky like a cannonball.\nThe entire battlefield fell silent, the remaining blood claw elites were already in a slump and now offered no resistance, surrendering one after another.\nThe remaining blood claw elites surrendered, bringing this attack to an end.\nThis attack caused significant losses for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThe sudden attack, combined with the Blood Claw Tribe's elites, resulted in greater casualties than the previous counterattack against the Zombie Undead Nest.\nBesides the great number of casualties, the city walls surrounding the small tribal city collapsed during the battle, with no clear timeline for repairs.\nFortunately, the Blood Claw Tribe greatly underestimated the development speed of Austin's clan and the strength of the Dragon Nest Beastmen, leading to the complete annihilation of their dispatched elites by the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nA large number of elites were lost at a particularly inopportune time, likely causing severe setbacks for the entire Blood Claw Tribe.\nThe Dragon Nest Beastmen began to clean the battlefield, burying the dead, sending the wounded for treatment, and collecting various weapons and resources on the ground.\nThe elite attackers from the Blood Claw Tribe were paupers, offering nothing of value, with scarcely one in ten surviving captives; recouping the losses after battle was impossible.\nHowever, some relatively strong blood claw elite warriors had interesting weapons and leather armor on them.\nThose weapons seemed to be made from the bones of some powerful magic beasts, with one or two runes faintly visible on the blade, suggesting treatment by some means to make fighting qi adhere more easily, and were also harder and sharper than bronze weapons.\nThe leather armor was similar, made from the hide of an unknown magic beast, with one or two faint runes and decent defensive capabilities.\nTo kill those few blood claw elite warriors, it took more than ten beastman officers working together, and even then, some were wounded before they managed to kill them, seriously injuring and capturing two.\nSince these few strong blood claw elites used enchanted weapons, they likely had some understanding of them, which might help us explore some techniques for crafting enchanted weapons.\nIf that were the case, that would be great.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe's warehouse still contains a significant amount of magic beast body materials, which, if converted into enchanted weapons, would significantly increase the Dragon Nest Tribe's strength.\nAs Vini and others commanded the beastmen to clear the battlefield, Austin brought out several blood claw elite captives for interrogation elsewhere.\nIn this survival-of-the-fittest Kawa Great Forest, being captured and surrendering was simply commonplace.\nIn this wilderness world without laws and moral restraints, wars among beastman tribes were unceasing, and it was common for weaker tribes to be annihilated.\nIn such chaotic battles, if the victors killed all the enemies immediately, there probably wouldn't be many beastmen left in the Kawa Great Forest in a few years.\nIn tribal conflicts, the defeated tribe would be annexed, and the captured strong beastmen would often surrender to the stronger side.\nIn this barbaric zone, there was no concept of shame or morality in surrendering.\nThus, Austin's Dragon Nest Tribe could rapidly develop and expand to its current size within just a few years.\nUnderstanding the common flaws among beastmen, Austin certainly wouldn't allow this to happen again, at least not to his own clan.\nTherefore, he introduced political indoctrination during daily training and, under his management, the Dragon Nest Tribe was thriving, winning the hearts of a large number of gathered beastmen and, taking advantage of the situation, instilling a strong personal cult within the tribe, elevating himself to a divine-like status in the hearts of the beastmen.\nAll the beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe could almost be said to be his fervent followers, their loyalty unmatched by any other tribe in the Kawa Forest.\nThe Blood Claw Tribe was the same; they lacked that consciousness and those methods.\nWhen Austin and the Dragon Nest Tribe demonstrated their immense strength, the remaining blood claw elites quickly surrendered with little resistance.\nHaving already surrendered, interrogating the blood claw elites required little effort for Austin, who learned their mission from them:\nUnder Gross's leadership, they were to kill the blue young dragon residing in those mountains, completely eliminating its clan, leaving no survivors, and then guide the mutated undead to the Dragon Nest, turning that blue young dragon and its tribe into mutated undead.\nHearing the mission slowly revealed by the blood claw elites, Austin almost broke out in a cold sweat.\nThat meant they wanted to ensure his death!\nThankfully, aware of his own weaknesses, he had been quietly developing in the secluded area without causing trouble, focusing on improving his strength and that of his clan tribe.\nTherefore, the Blood Claw Tribe greatly misjudged his strength, preventing their conspiracy from succeeding.\n\"The goal was to turn me into one of those zombie-like undead? And killing all the clan was to ensure no news got out... Why do that? Ah, turning a young dragon into undead would be a provocation to the Dragon Race, trying to involve them... Indeed, the Tribe Alliance surely knows some more secretive information...\"\nDespite his relief, Austin felt a sinking feeling in his heart.\nAfter this attack, he realized that his comfortable and steady development days wouldn't last long.",

      "content": "The shout from Gross before he died still echoed in Austin's mind.\nWho was the \"Majesty\" he spoke of? Could it be the mastermind behind the undead calamity?\nAlso, what was the thing that shouldn't have been taken? Could my destruction of the pyramid lair have drawn the attention of the person behind the scenes back then?\nThere were many things Austin didn't understand.\nHe didn't have the slightest clue about the great storm of change happening within the Kawa Great Forest.\nHowever, Austin understood that his carefree days were already numbered.\nLeaving everything else aside, after annihilating the invading forces of the Blood Claw Tribe, the strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe would inevitably be exposed, drawing the attention of the Beastman Alliance.\nAccording to the confessions of the captured Blood Claw elites, this batch of elite troops constituted a significant percentage of the entire Blood Claw Tribe's strength.\nThe complete destruction of these elites, along with the death of the Blood Claw Tribe's first warrior, had severely crippled the tribe.\nThe significant loss of strength in the Blood Claw Tribe was sure to trigger a series of changes at the Border Tribe Alliance's territory.\nAccording to the captured Blood Claw elites, the Beastman Alliance gathered at the border had reached some agreements with humans, receiving substantial support from them, while the Beastman Alliance ceased their war along the Bloody Border, turning to confront the undead army, even penetrating the core areas to destroy the controlling mutated evil spirits.\nHow the agreement came about, and what exactly happened, these elites were unaware of.\nGross might have known something, but now he's dead beyond rescue, and the information source is cut off.\nBesides the reactions from the Blood Claw Tribe and the Beastman Alliance, the \"mutated evil spirits\" were also a problem.\nPerhaps the puppet master behind the undead calamity had learned something, otherwise, Gross wouldn't have mentioned taking something he shouldn't.\nGross probably came seeking vengeance not only under the command of the Blood Claw Tribe but also to retrieve that thing as one of his objectives.\nReflecting on this, Austin's eyes flickered, and he looked thoughtful.\n...\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe currently faces too many troubles, and there are too many mysteries destined to remain unsolved.\nAustin is well aware that only strong power is the foundation for fearlessly facing any future upheaval.\nSo next, taking advantage of the remaining month or two of the cold winter, Austin began contemplating how to enhance his own strength.\nHaving awakened a trace of the Thunder Law during the battle with Gross, his strength had seen a significant increase, so there was no need to consider further raising his level in the short term.\nAs long as he could comprehend and master that trace of the Thunder Law, his strength could rapidly advance.\nOnce Austin could harness the power of that trace of the Thunder Law, he could then rely on its power to swiftly devour and refine magic power material, guiding its energy to temper himself, thereby stimulating his bloodline and rapidly increasing his level of power.\nThe power of laws represents a higher level of power.\nUnder the influence of such high-level power, there would be no bottleneck in Austin reaching the peak of the Gold Level; all that's lacking is sufficient magic resources to enhance his foundation.\nHowever, the Thunder Law is not so easily comprehended; it's a chasm blocking the way to the legendary gates unless Austin takes decades or hundreds of years to mature, naturally awakening the legendary laws within his bloodline completely.\nOtherwise, relying on that trace of the Thunder Law for self-comprehension, even if his bloodline has already awakened that trace of law, he's only slightly better off than other beings trying to comprehend the legendary laws, the difficulty remains very high.\nThe difficulty is high, but the rewards are equally great.\nBecause once he succeeds in fully comprehending and mastering the complete Thunder Law, the gateway to legend will fully open to Austin, his level realm rising instantly, without needing to wait decades or centuries to reach legend on reaching adulthood.\nAustin began to slowly comprehend the Thunder Law, knowing it would not be a task completed in a day or two.\nMeanwhile, Austin also started training to enhance the strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe's clan members.\nThe first issue was equipment, especially those suspected to be enchanted weapons seized during this battle.\nOnce the elite of the Blood Claw awoke, Vini had the beastmen interrogate them and learned from these suspected enchanted weapon users that the equipment was indeed made from materials of powerful magic beasts.\nHowever, they were just users; the true forgers were the mysterious priests within the Blood Claw Tribe.\nAs for how they were forged, they were unsure, only knowing that forging an enchanted weapon required considerable effort from the priest.\nKnowing this, Vini and others could only keep this matter in their hearts, hoping for a chance to address it in the future.\nBetter equipment couldn't be produced, but for now, Bronze Weapons were sufficient for the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nSince equipment enhancement was not possible, Austin looked into other possibilities for enhancing the Dragon Nest Beastmen's combat power.\n\"If the first base could be established successfully, then with the support from both places, the vast area could sustain a larger number of extraordinary Dragon Vein Beastmen.\"\nPreviously, due to food resource constraints, the extraordinary Dragon Vein Beastmen each required a lot of meat daily, and sustaining two to three hundred extraordinary Dragon Vein Beastmen was already the limit from herding and hunting wild animals from nearby forests.\nLater, even after the Dragon Nest Legion battled continuously to kill giant beasts to obtain meat supplies, at most they could sustain around four to five hundred extraordinary beastmen during normal times.\nIt was due to these meat limitations that Austin hadn't rapidly expanded the extraordinary beastmen's ranks, nor undertaken large-scale extraordinary transformations of ordinary beastmen.\nOver the past two years, the number of extraordinary beastmen, including those captured and rewarded with merits, had only grown to over three hundred for various reasons.\n\"Larger territory means more hunting grounds, and the current tribe's herding has reached a certain scale capable of producing more meat, making it time to expand the ranks of the beastman officers.\"\nWith the advent of herding, the Dragon Nest Beastmen Legion would deliberately leave young beasts during hunting to raise in farming grounds.\nAfter two years of development, the farming scale had reached a certain level, providing a stable third of the Dragon Nest Tribe's meat supply daily.\nWith the stable meat supply from farming grounds, Austin had the confidence to expand the ranks of the extraordinary Dragon Vein Beastmen.\nThough having decided to expand the extraordinary ranks, given the current cold winter period, large-scale transformations were not feasible, and would have to wait until after the winter.\nMoreover, whether the first base could be successfully established was still an unknown.\nRecently, news from there mentioned enemies seemingly near the base.",

      "content": "Expanding the extraordinary team of the Dragon Nest Tribe is something that must be done.\nJust when the Dragon Nest Legion swept through the dangerous areas ravaged by the undead, they brought back a lot of defective magic resources. Austin didn't care for these defective magic resources, so they were just right for transforming the beastmen, thus expanding the extraordinary team of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nNow, with the awakening of the Thunder Law within Austin's bloodline, there are no longer any obstacles on the path ahead, except for the need for a large amount of magic resources.\nOnce the extraordinary beastman team of the Dragon Nest Tribe is expanded and given some training, they will form a formidable force that can sweep through various dangerous areas, collecting a large amount of magic crystals, magic ore, and other magic resources to sustain Austin himself, thus forming a positive cycle.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe has grown to a point where it already has a certain capacity for feedback.\nAt least, under the leadership of a large and powerful team of extraordinary beastmen, they have the ability to sweep through some dangerous areas, and the collection of magic resources has naturally greatly improved, removing the need for Austin to personally gather the magical materials required for his growth in the future.\nHowever, although it's imperative to increase the number of extraordinary Dragon Vein Beastmen, it cannot be accomplished overnight.\nDuring the cold winter, due to the weather, there are indeed very few things that can be done.\nIn this icy and snowy environment, the prey in the forest lands hibernates and does not come out. Even though the Blood Wolves in the Dragon Nest Tribe have already reached a certain scale, it's still hard to find their traces.\nFresh meat is hard to obtain from the outside world, making it the wrong time to expand the extraordinary Dragon Vein Beastmen.\n\"At least, wait until the cold winter is over,\"\nDuring this cold winter, so many extraordinary Dragon Vein Beastmen are not needed at the moment, so Austin didn't feel discouraged.\nIt's just the right time to select suitable beastmen for transformation and conduct special training for one or two months, building their physiques to welcome the transformation after the cold winter in the best condition.\nThe stronger the beastmen, the better the effect of the transformation.\nAs for selecting the number of people, Austin naturally doesn't need to do it himself, just let Vini or Rodney handle it.\nRegarding the method of selection, as long as the right people can be chosen, Austin won't be too concerned—he only wants the results.\nSo, Vini and Rodney, upon receiving Austin's task, had a discussion. Besides selecting a small portion of the slots for those beastmen who made significant contributions to the Dragon Nest Tribe, the rest were to be decided through a competition within the entire tribe.\nIn this wild world, beastmen inherently esteem power, and strength is revered. Not to mention that in the end, they could receive the key to stepping into the Extraordinary Gate.\nThe Breathing Technique can enable ordinary beastmen to break through the mundane gate and activate the extraordinary seeds within them, but for ordinary people to activate the extraordinary seeds through the Breathing Technique, it typically takes five to ten years.\nIn the Human World, extraordinary professionals are trained from a young age.\nHere and now is an opportunity, a chance for them to ascend in one step, coupled with the beastmen's natural belligerence. Therefore, after the decision to determine the slots through competition was announced, a great turmoil swept through the entire tribe as soon as the news leaked out.\nA large number of beastman soldiers enthusiastically signed up, and even extraordinary beastman officers wanted to participate, leaving Vini and Rodney a bit overwhelmed.\nThis was originally just a big competition to select transformation slots, and Vini and her group certainly wouldn't let the beastmen go wild, so they intended to suppress it.\nInitially, under Vini and Rodney's explanation, the turmoil among the beastmen was about to subside.\nBut who knew these rumors reached the first stronghold under construction, causing the beastmen on the task of expanding the foothold over there to clamor as well, which finally alerted Austin.\nUpon reflection, Austin realized that after traversing into this world for several years, he never really engaged in any recreation. Now that the beastman clan was emotionally charged, and since there was little to do during the cold winter, perhaps a sports event could be organized to both entertain them and stimulate the beastman clan's passion for training.\nThus, Austin decided to host the first Dragon Nest Sports Event within the Dragon Nest Tribe and informed Vini and her group to organize and manage it and to establish a rulebook.\nFaced with the sudden whims of the big boss, Vini and her group had no choice but to start preparing for the sports event according to Austin's plans.\nFortunately, within the beastman tribe, there is also the tradition of challenging to claim the title of the first warrior, so Vini and her group expanded it based on their traditional beastman warrior challenge rules, which formed the outline of the Dragon Nest Sports Event.\nIt was simply deciding on a time, gathering all the beastmen from the Dragon Nest Tribe, encircling an open space, and allowing anyone to step forward and accept challenges from others as long as they displayed bravery and might.\nA very rudimentary plan, so rudimentary it was downright pitiful.\nNot to mention anything else, even the most basic elements like a referee's judgment and challenge rules were missing. It was just a matter of organizing people to clear an area to watch the beastmen fight on it.\nYet, even such minimal challenges were watched with relish by the beastmen.\nWhen Vini reported the plan to Austin, Austin was perplexed.\nWhat was this? Public brawling and onlookers? Where was the grace of a sports event?\nPredictably, this plan was immediately rejected.\nUltimately, to host a grand sports event in the Otherworld, Austin personally took charge, drawing from past school sports events for various organizational planning and setting up various challenge regulations.\nFirstly, determining the sports events.\nHigh jump, long jump, marathon, relay races, etc., all aesthetic and competitive events were crammed into the sports event by Austin in one go.\nThese competitions rooted from the age of Earth, filled with competitive elements, surely wouldn't fare too poorly.\nAside from these competitive events, Austin also scheduled a single combat match during the climax period.\nThe so-called single combat match was a ring match.\nIf past sports events pursued rivalry, providing great spectating pleasure through fierce competition, then the final single combat match was a fist-to-fist battle, a contest erupting with hormones.\nThese fist-to-fist, blood-boiling battles, along with continuous advancements during the period, reaching the peak and acquiring the highest honor undoubtedly scratched where the beastmen itched most.\nAustin believes that this sports event, improved by himself, is sure to be a great success.\nDuring the combat match, those with outstanding performances would successfully receive the slots for transformation, thereby stepping into the extraordinary domain, aiming to maximize stimulating the beastmen's enthusiasm for battle.\nOf course, the sports event comes with a restriction: primarily barring the participation of extraordinary beastmen.",

      "content": "In a certain sense, Extraordinary Beastmen have already transcended the limits of ordinary Beastmen. If not restricted, the final winner would inevitably be an Extraordinary Beastman, and it would be the highest-level Beastman Officer.\nCrushing ordinary Beastmen with absolute superiority, what kind of competitiveness would sports events have under such circumstances?\nAustin's establishment of this sports event is not only to select talent but also to recreate and reminisce the atmosphere of past sports events, adding a touch of color to this culturally dry Otherworld; thus, Extraordinary Beastmen are naturally excluded from the sports event.\nUnder Austin's direct leadership, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe was mobilized into action.\nShortly after the raids, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe entered a fervent atmosphere.\nTo construct the venue, Austin personally led the Beastmen to level a large expanse of land, using gravel to build facilities reminiscent of those in past athletic competitions, while erecting a gigantic stage in the central square.\nThe cold winter season is indeed not suitable for construction, but under Austin's leadership, the Beastmen were full of energy, completing the construction of various facilities in approximately ten days.\nSimultaneously, the atmosphere of the sports event reached its peak.\nA large number of Dragon Nest Beastmen gathered together, including many Beastman soldiers and pioneers from the first outpost coming over.\nThe first outpost of the Dragon Nest Tribe is over a hundred kilometers away from Dragon Nest Town, and the snow-covered ground makes traversing difficult. Yet none of this could dampen the strong enthusiasm of the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nInitially, to accommodate a large number of old and weak Beastmen gathered at the first outpost, Austin had already organized preliminary competitions under simple conditions at the first outpost to select teams for the finals at Dragon Nest Town.\nEven though the preliminary competition was simple, it caused a huge sensation throughout the first outpost.\nIn the Kawa Great Forest, Beastmen's entertainment activities were originally few and far between. The competitive projects infused with modern elements introduced by Austin instantly captivated the Beastmen's attention.\nStanding long jumps and high jumps were fine; they were very thrilling for the Beastmen, but mostly just elicited roars and cheers.\nHowever, projects like running sparked waves of fanatical cheers from the entire groups of Beastmen. Self-taught, they loudly cheered by the track, creating an earth-shaking noise.\nEspecially during the team tug-of-war matches, those Beastmen, with faces flushed red, roared loudly from the sidelines, seemingly more excited than the competitors, almost jumping in to join themselves.\nThe cheers were like tsunamis, traveling far and wide, prompting the Elves, who had frequent conflicts with the Dragon Nest Beastmen recently, to become vigilant, gazing towards the direction of the Dragon Nest Beastmen outpost, worried whether the Beastman Tribe was about to launch a full-scale attack.\nThe preliminary competition at the first outpost set a great start for the Dragon Nest Tribe's sports event.\nIt seemed that the Dragon Nest Beastmen were very enthusiastic about the sports event. Even in the days following the preliminary rounds, the atmosphere of fervor in the air could still be felt.\nAnd after the selections at the first outpost were complete, the various competition facilities at Dragon Nest Town were also completed.\nA large number of Dragon Nest Beastmen began readying themselves for the grand event set to open during the cold winter, with even many Beastmen stationed at the first outpost coming to the main town to watch.\nRodney and others were unlucky; because many Beastmen were unwilling to miss the finals and went to the main town to watch, the defense at the first outpost was somewhat vacant, forcing Rodney, as the Legion Commander, to lead a large number of elites to guard the outpost.\nThis nearly drove Gegroni and the Extraordinary Beastmen sent to guard the outpost to swear profusely.\nThough they were not eligible to compete, they very much wanted to watch the event from the sidelines.\nHowever, with enemies around the first outpost of expansion, it couldn't be left vulnerable to being breached. Therefore, they had to stand guard around the bleak outpost.\nJust when Rodney, patrolling in the cold winter's icy environment, cursed some Beastman soldiers, vowing to severely train those deserters later, the sports event in the main town was preluding its curtain.\nThis was the first grand event held by the Dragon Nest Tribe since its establishment. The entire main city area gathered more than twenty thousand Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nTo further showcase the tribe's achievements, Austin specially conducted a military parade before the opening of the sports event.\nTeams of strong Beastman soldiers, neat and orderly like an iron stream, marched down the walkway, moving in orderly steps, emanating a fierce aura that felt like facing the impact of a Steel Giant Beast.\nThe disciplined Beastman soldiers marched continuously down the aisle, persisting for more than ten minutes.\nAlthough there wasn't the high-pitched music of the past, under those steadfast and orderly steps, the Dragon Nest soldiers displayed the elegance appropriate to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThese armies, grown from Austin's ideals of the past and flourishing in this world to ultimately establish themselves, were no mere window dressing.\nIn the era of cold weapon warfare, a tightly ordered and strictly disciplined team can be considered the cream of the crop, and troops trained from the distilled essence of hundreds to thousands of years of warfare summarized from the past have nearly reached the pinnacle of this world.\nEven in modern military training, standing at attention and marching in step are very important elements of training, showing that the Beastman army trained in these methods is definitely not just decorative.\nEspecially in several wars where the Dragon Nest Legion demonstrated formidable power, almost becoming an unstoppable, terrifying black tide before ordinary Beastman Tribes.\n\"I never thought it could develop to this extent in the blink of an eye.\"\nAbove the high platform, Austin looked down at the elite Dragon Nest Legion continuously marching by, and the densely packed Dragon Nest Beastman Clan surrounding the square, his heart surged with satisfaction.\nA few years ago, a newborn Austin merely had the strength to wrestle lions and tigers, hunt buffaloes and wild horses.\nBut back then, he was still young and could only reign over ordinary creatures. Even amidst a common pack of low-tier Magic Beast Blood Wolves, he had to avoid their edge.\nLater, when he survived and grew a little, possessing the power to protect himself.\nIn pursuit of defeating his enemies, he began gathering and creating forces, developing and expanding through various means until he reached today's scale.\nThinking back on those days of hiding and comparing it to nowadays when merely issuing a command could mobilize the entire Dragon Nest Legion, even a Golden Level Lord of Magical Beasts couldn't act recklessly; it's all like a dream.",

      "content": "Recalling scenes from the past, the hardships along the way, it all feels like a dream.\n\"Just seven Kobolds, and I managed to create such a massive Dragon Nest Tribe. Even an Empire is no challenge!\"\nIn an instant, Austin felt an infinite confidence surge within him.\nTo create such a huge Beastman Tribe from nothing and gather and train so many powerful elites, he naturally had the right to be confident.\nHe firmly believed that whether it was the Beastman Alliance or the \"Mutated Evil Spirit\" controlling the Undead Calamity, they would one day become stepping stones for his growth and resources for his entry into a higher world.\nWhile Austin stood on the high platform filled with ambitious aspirations, the governor Vini standing beside him was also full of complex emotions.\nThinking back to when their remnant faction faced desperate situations and accidentally entered His Highness Austin's territory, who could have imagined today's scene?\nAt that time, their greatest wish was just to survive the cold winter and take root under the prince's protection.\nIn the beginning, being able to fill their stomachs was their greatest happiness.\nThe world's changes, in just a few short years, in the blink of an eye, the Dragon Nest Tribe has developed to its current scale.\nFor Austin, who led all this, Vini's admiration had reached an unprecedented level.\nDuring this period, with the constant absorption of outside wandering Beastmen, wandering Tribes, and their own population's reproduction and survival, the population of the Dragon Nest Tribe had already exceeded thirty thousand and was steadily approaching forty thousand.\nAt the beginning, he was just a leader of seven half-disabled defeated warriors, struggling to survive with his kind.\nNow, he stood high, beside the great His Highness Austin, controlling the fate of thousands of Beastmen.\nIn the past, how did he dare to hope for such a day to come?\nThe enormity of the world's changes was nothing compared to this; Vini felt that this struggle would be unforgettable for the rest of his life.\nNot just Vini, but all those who joined early, contributed significantly, and rose to the middle and upper echelons of the Dragon Nest Tribe expressed the same sentiments.\nThe hardships of a few years ago were still vivid, and now they had grown to become the overlord of a region, possessing the strength to change the balance of war power in an area.\nInitially, many Beastmen had to submit under the sweeping force of the Dragon Nest Legion, but after continuous indoctrination and with the Dragon Nest Tribe's prosperous rise like the morning sun, every Beastman present was filled with a sense of pride.\n\"This dragon... perhaps, I should stay...\"\nStanding beside the high platform, one of the few humans in the Dragon Nest Tribe, original Mercenary Deputy Captain Gory, looked at the advancing Dragon Nest Beastman army below and suddenly felt a sense of confusion.\nBack then, when he surrendered to the dragon's command, Gory's only thought was to save his life.\nLater, seeing the powerful secret techniques created by the dragon, he began to perform earnestly, striving to gain more merits to earn rewards of those powerful combat techniques.\nNow, having lived in the Dragon Nest Tribe for over a year, thanks to his relentless efforts and significant achievements, Gory had risen to the high ranks of the Dragon Nest Legion and was awarded a junior officer rank, commanding over three hundred Beastman elites.\nAnd now, in the force of over three hundred he commanded, there were not only Beastmen but also original members of the Mercenary Corps.\nThose original Mercenary Corps members were all under Gory's command trying to get by.\nMeanwhile, the original Mercenary Captain, Valen, and a few die-hard non-surrendering members were still engaged in hard labor in various places like the prison camp mines.\nSeeing the situation of original Mercenary Captain Valen and the fate of a few die-hard elements, most of the mercenaries who surrendered felt considerable relief; the Mercenary Corps had already fallen apart.\nHaving experienced the power of commanding hundreds, Gory suddenly found that he no longer wished to return to the Central Earth World and continue living a desolate life.\nWith his achievements, he would soon be able to learn those powerful secret techniques, techniques far superior to commonplace Combat Techniques like Wind Chasing Slash and Earth Splitting Slash!\nInitially, Gory planned to escape the Dragon Nest Tribe immediately after obtaining those powerful secret techniques, escape back to the Central Earth World, then work hard, using those techniques to succeed in some Duchy and gain rewards to become a noble.\nYet now, Gory's thoughts had changed.\nNot to mention, even if he gained the secret techniques and increased his power, returning to the Central Earth World, without network connections, could he indeed simply gain a noble title?\nHow could he ensure those learned secret techniques wouldn't be targeted by greedy high-ranking nobles, how could he ensure his life-and-death-earned accomplishments wouldn't be credited to other nobles? Such guarantees seemed impossible for a common-born Gory.\nMoreover, when the mercenary team was defeated and he surrendered to the dragon, the Dragon Nest Tribe's population was around a mere thousand, and the Blue Young Dragon named Austin was only of Silver Level.\nBut now, the population of the Clan Tribe had grown to near forty thousand, including many powerful Beastman Transcendent Professionals.\nAnd that Blue Young Dragon named Austin had quickly grown to the Gold Level.\nSuch immense growth and change happened in just a span of one or two years.\nIn just one or two years, the Dragon Nest Tribe had developed to its present state. What if they had a few more years to develop further?\nUndoubtedly, it would become a dominant force in Kawa Great Forest.\nAnd Gory knew well, Austin's ambitions were far beyond this. Someday, when his expansion reached a certain extent, he would certainly launch a significant attack on the Central Earth World, turning human territories into his domain.\nBy then, the noble title he had dreamt of, the childhood dream of becoming a lofty noble, wouldn't it be fulfilled?\nIn a country established by a dragon, becoming a ruling noble didn't seem bad either.\nLooking at the continually passing Dragon Nest Beastman elites below, Gory's thoughts slowly started to change.\nAs for the multitude of clans' thoughts nearby, Austin naturally couldn't fully understand each one.\nLooking at the densely packed sea of people all around, the huge recurring cheers, the excitement and pride on each Dragon Nest Beastman's face, Austin understood that this pre-sporting event parade had been an enormous success.\nThe cohesion of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe had been greatly strengthened.",

      "content": "The first Dragon's Nest Tribe Sports Meet was a resounding success. In a world lacking entertainment, the event stirred up a great wave within the tens of thousands in the tribe, deeply impacting every Beastman's heart.\nEnjoying lively events is a common trait, and Beastmen are no exception.\nWithout previous entertainment activities, this opportunity became a floodgate for excitement, which poured out with fervor.\nEven the less popular events like high jump and long jump, which Austin thought might be met with indifference, were warmly welcomed by the Beastmen. As for the marathons, tug-of-war, and solo arena challenges, the intense competitions fueled the Beastmen's enthusiasm, with cheers and shouts echoing aloud.\nFor several days, the entire Dragon's Nest Tribe was engulfed in an extreme atmosphere of fervor during the sports meet.\nAustin also relished the intense feelings reminiscent of sports meets from his previous life, making him feel as if he had returned there. His minds, previously tightly wound, were relaxed over these few days.\nHaving traversed to this world for several years, developing to this stage wasn't easy; only Austin himself truly understood the hardships involved. This sports meet alleviated many worries in his heart.\nThis sports meet was organized rather hastily, and there were frequent accidents and injuries among the Beastman participants. Fortunately, with sufficient Snake Shedding Grass to produce potions, minor injuries weren't a serious issue.\nThus, the first sports meet managed to proceed smoothly.\nSeveral days later, the first sports meet of the Dragon's Nest Tribe concluded grandly.\nThis grand event not only significantly sparked the upward spirit of the Dragon Nest Beastmen but also greatly solidified their cohesion.\nAustin could clearly feel that after the sports meet, the atmosphere of the entire Dragon's Nest Tribe changed significantly.\nThis made Austin consider whether to organize another sports meet at some point in the future, including setting up some challenge events suited for the Extraordinary Beastmen.\nWith this idea in mind, Austin naturally planned to build this event into a grand celebration similar to the Olympics in his previous life.\nHowever, no matter what he thought, the next event would not happen in the near future.\nThe Olympics in his previous life were held every four years; the Dragon's Nest Sports Meet should at least be every five years.\nWith the conclusion of the sports meet, the Dragon's Nest Tribe gradually returned to its normal life trajectory. However, in their leisure time, Beastmen had much more to talk about.\nStories naturally emerged about which warrior jumped the highest, who won first in the solo challenges, and who had the honor of a personal audience with His Highness Austin as a reward, spreading as gossip naturally does.\nThis sports meet, arguably the first of its kind in the Otherworld, was destined to be widely circulated among the Beastmen, and its aftershocks would linger long until the next meet overshadowed it.\nAnd this was a good thing, as the adjustment brought by the sports meet at least made the Beastmen work harder in their training.\nTime flew by, and more than a month of the cold winter had passed.\nWith the conclusion of the sports meet, outstanding Beastmen were selected for transformation, with selections finalized after the cold winter.\nHowever, these selected, soon-to-break-through-the-ordinary-band Extraordinary Beastman Seeds had to undergo a period of tough training.\nThe sports meet's initial purpose was to select stronger Beastmen as seeds for transforming into Dragon Vein Beastmen.\nTo start from a higher point during the transformation period and not have them idle during the long cold winter, these chosen Extraordinary Beastman Seeds began arduous training.\nThe current training was several times harsher than usual military training, with a significantly increased workload, as all of it was in preparation for successfully activating the Extraordinary Seed.\nThe training wasn't short. It would last until the end of winter when spring revitalized the Forest Land, and the anticipated emergence of a large number of game could support the increased number of Extraordinary Beastmen in the Dragon's Nest Tribe, at which point their training might conclude, entering the stage of modification personally overseen by Austin.\nWith the start of the training, the Dragon's Nest Tribe also gradually returned to its routine and stable atmosphere.\nUntil the tribe fully recovered from the sports meet's excitement and settled into various routine production and training work, Austin also began to ready himself, planning to complete a research project that would significantly enhance the strength of the Extraordinary Beastmen.\nThat was the Magic Modification of the Navy Six Techniques.\nAmong the Beastman Officers in the Dragon's Nest Tribe, the so-called Beastman Six Techniques consisted of only four techniques Austin had modified and developed: Shunpo, Fright, Iron Block, and Gale Wave.\nThese four techniques were created by Austin, utilizing the principles of the Navy Six Techniques from fantasy novels of his previous life, after adapting them through magical modifications suitable for this world.\nHowever, due to various reasons, Austin only managed to develop four of a complete set of the Navy Six Techniques, leaving Finger Gun and Paper Drawing not modified.\nFinger Gun wasn't developed because the close-combat attack method of stabbing with fingers wasn't very practical compared to using a sword. Thus, Austin hadn't planned to develop it in the first place.\nAs for Paper Drawing, its function is similar to Iron Block, both being defensive techniques. The former is an evasive technique, while the latter is a brute-force approach.\nThe principle of Paper Drawing, when understood in reality, resembles techniques like hearing wind to determine position. However, such precise operations are somewhat challenging for the hard-headed Beastmen, so Austin didn't attempt it.\nNevertheless, as Austin's strength increased, his vision expanded significantly.\nNot long ago, during the development of the Magic Power Rasengan, Austin pondered whether he could supplement the Beastmen's hand-to-hand combat capabilities by developing a Fighting Qi Rasengan, adding a powerful close-combat technique for the Beastman Officers.\nIf successful, the combination of Shunpo + Rasengan would deal severe damage to Gold Level Great Warriors, should they be caught off guard.\nSubsequently, by dividing his own Magic Power, Austin honed an extremely refined Magic Power control ability, extending strands of Magic Power through the world, enveloping the entire spatial region to form a Domain prototype.\nThrough developing the Domain prototype, Austin had a sudden idea: could Beastmen integrate their Fighting Qi with the external air to achieve the effect of Paper Drawing or even beyond, reaching capabilities similar to Observation-style Dominance?\nWith the idea formed, Austin, somewhat possessing a perfectionist streak, naturally wanted to complete the Beastman Six Techniques.\nMoreover, once the Six Techniques took shape, Dragon Vein Beastmen's power would see a significant boost.\nThus, after a brief rest post-sports meet, Austin gathered most of the Beastman Officers and Junior Officers to attempt the development of the Fighting Qi Rasengan and a Fighting Qi version of Paper Drawing.",

      "content": "When Austin initially developed the Magic Power Rasengan, he merely attempted over a hundred times and spent half a day's effort to successfully create it.\nOriginally, he thought transforming it into a Fighting Qi Rasengan would be just as simple.\nBut the facts proved otherwise.\nAustin was able to quickly develop the Magic Power Rasengan because he himself possessed the bloodline of the Giant Dragon, giving him an innate advantage in both spirit and magical power control.\nAnd these Beastman Transcendent beings were far inferior to Austin; how could they so easily develop the Rasengan?\nMoreover, compared to magical power, Fighting Qi is even more difficult to control.\nAfter nearly ten days, the Beastman Transcendents merely learned how to gather a whirlpool of Fighting Qi in their palms. Successfully forming it, condensing the scattered Fighting Qi to reach the Rasengan level, was still a distant goal.\nAlthough progress was slow, Austin did not give up.\nAt least, the experimental development team's beastmen could gather a whirlpool of Fighting Qi in their palms. This indicated that the idea of the Fighting Qi Rasengan was correct; what was lacking was merely how to gather and condense the dispersing Fighting Qi to form a highly rotating, highly condensed sphere of Fighting Qi.\nAs it is said, practice makes perfect. With more practice, the Fighting Qi Rasengan can naturally be utilized.\nBut under the current situation of the Dragon Nest Tribe, there was naturally no balloon material for the beastmen to practice with.\nThus, Austin used an alternative method. First, he carved a round ball from wood, then had them hold it in their palms, stimulating the whirlpool of Fighting Qi to continuously compress inward. As long as the compressive force cracked and shattered the wooden ball, the foundation stage could be considered complete.\nUsing the whirlpool of swirling Fighting Qi to crack and shatter the wooden ball in their palms meant they could compress and condense the scattered whirlpool of Fighting Qi to a relatively solid degree.\nAnd this powerful tearing force forms the foundation of the Fighting Qi Rasengan.\nAchieving such a level of power means that the developed Fighting Qi Rasengan already has a certain level of destructive power.\nThe development of the Fighting Qi Rasengan is, after all, a form of offensive technique using Fighting Qi energy. It is not something that can be developed easily.\nAustin set a general direction, then had the beastmen practice and discuss with each other, jointly researching how to improve it, and afterwards turned his focus mostly to the development of papercraft.\nThe idea for improving papercraft came from Austin's construction of his own domain prototype.\nThough he understood well that truly getting the beastmen to learn how to construct a domain prototype would be almost as hard as climbing to the heavens.\nCompared to developing the Fighting Qi Rasengan, papercraft development was more like working with iron: just strike!\nBlindfold the eyes of the experimental group of Extraordinary Beastmen, then have another beastman strike repeatedly, let the beastmen in pain learn to sense airflow and enhance their Sixth Sense, thereby learning to use Fighting Qi to perceive the direction of enemy attacks.\nAfter all, with many years of development, the Dragon Nest Tribe has established a unique unconscious system belonging to this world, and for sprains and injuries, the witch doctors of the Dragon Nest Tribe already have quite good experience.\nOn the first day, the beastmen of the papercraft experimental group had bruised faces, but after treatment the next day, they were mostly unharmed, ready for another round of beatings.\nThis time, the experiment went as Austin expected, and the beastmen of the papercraft experimental group significantly enhanced their sensitivity to attacks. Initially, out of a hundred strikes, ninety-eight landed on them, with the remaining two being dodged by pure luck.\nAfter several days of pain and torment, the Extraordinary Beastmen had learned how to perceive and evade attacks in the darkness, with their instinctive intuition greatly strengthened, and eventually only eighty or so out of a hundred strikes hit them.\nThis was already quite an improvement compared to before.\nAs they continued, the experimental group of beastmen continued to explore through pain, eventually able to develop papercraft for perceiving the direction of airflow attacks using Fighting Qi.\nHaving passed down the rough development direction for both Fighting Qi Rasengan and papercraft techniques, further progress could only rely on time.\nWith previous experiences, Austin no longer needed to supervise them around the clock, and the beastmen were capable of independently proposing some ideas for improvement.\nSeeing that the last two of the Beastman Six Techniques were unlikely to be developed within a few months amidst numerous attempts and summaries, and considering that the beastmen with experience outlines could also experiment independently, Austin decided to hand over the development tasks to them, and turned his Heart Spirit to other areas.\nMore than a month had passed since Gross, the first warrior of the Blood Claw Tribe, had led an attack.\nAustin was fully aware that once the news of Gross's complete defeat spread, the Dragon Nest Tribe would face intensified pressure and possibly even greater danger.\nTherefore, during this period, Austin completely focused on using all methods to enhance his own strength.\nIncreasing the number of Extraordinary Beastmen was one aspect, completing the Beastman Six Techniques was another.\nAt the same time, Austin had not neglected sorting out his own abilities.\nThe passionate battle with Gross had awakened a trace of Thunder Law, which belonged to Austin and could be activated from his bloodline and manifested into the world.\nDuring this period, even during the sports meet, Austin had not abandoned comprehending that trace of Thunder Law.\nThrough more than a month of contemplative insight, Austin reaped substantial benefits.\nAlthough that trace of Thunder Law appeared before him, it still generated a feeling of infinite remoteness, as if separated by numerous planes, even though it was right before him.\nFully comprehending that trace of Thunder Law might take who knows how many years or months.\nHowever, after sustained contact and observation for over a month, Austin, as a result, significantly improved his strength.\nWhether in terms of understanding and controlling Thunder, or mastery over other attribute powers, his abilities saw great enhancement due to his opportunity to directly view the Law Power.\nThat trace of Thunder Law was like a key, a key able to open the door to a new world.\nThough Austin had not yet the qualification to use that key to step into a new realm, merely glimpsing the world through a tiny crack was already enough to broaden his horizons.\nThe present Austin, after being empowered by that trace of Thunder Law, perhaps facing Gross again wouldn't even require deploying a Legendary Law as such a mighty weapon to defeat and kill him.\nNonetheless, Austin felt this was still not enough!",

      "content": "The Thunder Law is very powerful, belonging to the heavens and earth, a force like the majestic power of commanding thunder.\nThe sliver of Thunder Law awakened from his bloodline allowed Austin, even at the Gold Level, to catch a glimpse of the Legendary Level, rapidly increasing his control over various elemental powers.\nBut no matter how strong, there are limits.\nAs long as Austin hasn't comprehended the Thunder Law, hasn't gathered his own Law Power, or awakened the Law in his bloodline, then no matter how strong his control over thunder is, when he encounters those powerful entities controlling the Law, he is just a slightly stronger ant.\nThe Law is a higher level of power.\nAustin needs a more powerful offensive technique.\nEspecially in such uncertain prospects, having more methods never hurts, as strength is ultimately the foundation for surviving freely.\nThe Super Invincible World-Destroying Wind-Water-Thunder Rasengan, though its power is formidable, with destructive force almost comparable to a Forbidden Curse.\nHowever, even after comprehending the Thunder Law and further mastering various attribute powers, Austin could only halve the time needed to condense this technique and greatly increase its success rate.\nThe time to condense it is still not short, and during the condensation, he can't move. Otherwise, one small mistake causing attribute magic power to become chaotic might result in an explosion that would likely engulf himself first.\nThis technique is at its best when dealing with stationary structures like pyramids.\nNow, Austin needs a method that can be utilized even in intense battles.\nAustin gazed at the sliver of Thunder Law within his body.\nAlthough it's best not to reveal the Thunder Law in his body to the outside world, if it truly comes to a desperate situation, it wouldn't matter if it's revealed.\nDuring the battle with Gross, Gross mentioned that he took something he shouldn't have, saying that some majesty would not let him go.\nAt that time, Austin thought carefully and took out the mysterious crystal he obtained after destroying the pyramid. Even after awakening a sliver of Thunder Law, Austin still felt that the power contained within the crystal was so mysteriously unfathomable.\nIt even faintly gave Austin a feeling that the power level of the crystal seemed to be above the Thunder Law!\nFor now, Austin couldn't make use of that crystal, but there was no doubt that as long as he had that crystal in his hands, and as long as he was exposed to the outside world's attention, danger would certainly continuously arise.\n\"Strong power is the greatest reliance for self-preservation!\"\nAfter a long contemplation, Austin decided to develop another technique, a powerful technique that also harnesses the Thunder Law as his ultimate trump card.\nDuring the battle with Gross, just by driving the sliver of Thunder Law's power, Austin instantly obliterated the life-exploding Gross into ashes.\nAt that time, Austin's method of driving it was still very crude.\nIt was like a child throwing a knife to kill an enemy.\nIntegrating the Thunder Law into a certain technique would be designing a sword technique for the knife, allowing it to unleash its power.\n\"Now, continuing to comprehend the Thunder Law has started to become slow. Instead of spending more time on comprehending the Thunder Law, it's better to first invest some time in integrating the Thunder Law into a technique. That technique containing the Thunder Law will become my greatest trump card!\"\nAs for whether this final trump card would reveal his secret of controlling the Thunder Law, that doesn't need to be said.\nOnce Austin needs to use this last trump card, it would mean that he is already in an extremely dangerous moment. Whether the secret of driving the Thunder Law is kept or not already doesn't matter much.\nSo, after arranging various affairs of the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin, who had rested for more than a month, began another closed-door session.\nDuring the cold winter, there's not much to do, and the Dragon Nest Tribe is basically in a recuperation phase.\nAlso, aside from the initial construction phase of the Dragon Nest Tribe, when Austin was busy handling tribal affairs, the Dragon Nest Tribe now has established a sufficiently perfect system, freeing Austin from various trivial daily matters.\nThe development of the Fighting Qi Rasengan and Paper Drawing Techniques were proceeding steadily and orderly.\nDuring the cold winter, there would generally be no unexpected situations, so Austin found a relatively secluded place to start the retreat and attempt to develop a technique that could integrate the Thunder Law.\nHowever, developing a magic technique that could bear the Thunder Law is not that easy.\nEven at the Legendary Realm, people use the Law in a simple and crude way, directly using the Law to create a Domain and violently collide with each other.\nThe greatest principles are simple. Reaching this level of power already indicates a force that can break ten thousand techniques.\nThe deeper one understands the Law, it represents stronger power, and it's basically how Legendary strength is distinguished in this world.\nEven at the Legendary Level, they use the Law in such a simple way, let alone Austin, who is only at the Gold Level?\nSimple techniques can't bear the power of the Thunder Law.\nTechniques like the Magic Power Rasengan, if the Thunder Law is integrated, it might collapse and dissipate the moment it's integrated.\nThis is power-level suppression, simply unusable.\nAlthough this path is extremely difficult, compared to other Legendary powers, the one thing Austin does not lack is imagination.\nThe principles are universal, and from previous life, the anime and novels he watched can be referenced.\n\"The thing is, which technique should be referenced? At this power level, it seems there's nothing to reference.\"\nAustin pondered, with many memories flowing like water in his mind, but struggled to find a suitable technique.\nAlso, Austin in the previous life was not a heavy anime fan. Excluding the deep understanding he had of Naruto and One Piece, he only watched a few other animes, and among these, involving the Law-level techniques capable of bearing this powerful power seemed absent.\n\"Anime doesn't have them. I wonder if there are techniques from the novels read in the previous life suitable for bearing the Thunder Law.\"\nCompared to anime, the power level in the novels Austin read in his previous life is much higher, not to mention Law, including Divine, Space-Time, Heaven and Earth, the Path of Chaos, and various oversized power imagination — they are all present.\nHowever, realizing those imaginations in this world is not easy.\nAfter several days of closed-door contemplation, by combining various novels and anime, Austin finally focused on a certain technique.",

      "content": "In certain anime novels, there is a technique prepared primarily for challenging opponents of higher levels, known as the Sword Drawing Technique.\nGathering the essence, spirit, and energy into the sword still sheathed, constantly storing power, until the moment it bursts forth with its most brilliant sword light, striking with a blow that surpasses its own power to slay enemies of superior strength.\nIn many fantasy Xianxia novels Austin read in his past life, there were techniques similar to Sword Drawing Technique.\nLike the Sword Pill in Xianxia, the Sword Containing in fantasy, they all continuously nourish the sword blade's power with spirit and energy over time, and the moment it blooms, its extreme power transcends its own limits.\nAustin set his sights on techniques like these.\nIf he used that trace of Thunder Law within him as an invincible blade edge, nurturing it within using spirit, bloodline, and momentum — a myriad of mysterious powers — until it is unsheathed, then the power from that Thunder Law might just be enough to kill a Legend!\nAlthough techniques like Sword Containment appear different from the style of the world he inhabits, the logic is the same, so trying it is worthwhile. If successfully nurtured, Austin will have an exceedingly powerful trump card!\nUpon thinking about it, Austin, in his retreat, began contemplating how to nurture that trace of Thunder Law.\n\"Whether it's the Sword Drawing Technique, Sword Pulling Technique from anime, or the Sword Pill, Sword Containment in Xianxia, the first step is preparing a vessel—a good sword or a Magical Treasure Sword Pill—all of these are vessels. So what should I choose as my vessel?\"\nGiven the strength of Thunder Law, it's impossible to use tangible items as its vessel; ordinary metals cannot withstand the formidable power of Thunder Law.\nAustin found himself in a dilemma.\nIn the world he can currently access, there is no suitable vessel for Thunder Law.\nHowever, having found a way to use Thunder Law, and if it can be realized in the future, the power of that trump card would be incredibly strong, something Austin was unwilling to give up easily.\nAfter several days of thought, Austin found a clever solution.\nUnable to find tangible material for Thunder Law, but what about a substance formed by conceptual things?\nAustin thought of Thunderbolt Power!\nAfter understanding that trace of Thunder Law, Austin gained further insight into Thunderbolt Power, enhancing his control over electricity.\nIn the Naruto anime, Uchiha Sasuke's lightning attribute change condenses electricity into a tangible Light Blade for attacks, the light blade having a tangible form, possessing sword-like attributes— even Orochimaru was amazed by this attribute change.\nOver a month of contemplating Thunder Law, Austin was able to create similar attribute-changing Thunderbolt Light Blades.\nCondensing conceptual thunder into a substance resembling a sword, he achieved the ability to create a tangible Light Sword.\nNow, Austin plans to use the condensed Thunderbolt to forge a Thunderbolt Longsword with such substantive attributes, then use this Thunderbolt Longsword as a vessel to integrate that trace of Thunder Law, nurturing it within, forming a Thunderbolt Divine Sword.\nBeing a concept-like Thunderbolt Divine Sword, it can be like a Magical Treasure in Xianxia, typically retracting into the body and spitting it out when needed, making it easier to use in combat.\nTaking enemies by surprise, severely injuring them in one move isn't impossible.\nEnemies unfamiliar with combat in the Immortal World wouldn't expect a terrifying object to be suddenly spat out from their opponent's mouth.\nHaving found a solution, the next step was attempting it.\nAs for the attribute change of electricity, due to Austin's joint understanding of Thunder Law, it took only a short time to condense such a Thunderbolt Longsword.\nThis was an azure Longsword, its brilliant form shining radiantly, akin to an illuminating glass.\nThe moment the sword appeared, the surrounding space seemed to dim, arcs of electricity blooming like ripples in the surrounding void.\n\"Using thunderbolt as the form to bear the Power of Thunder Law...\"\nWith deep contemplation, Austin began integrating Thunder Law into the Thunderbolt Longsword.\nThis wasn't a simple task, though Thunder Law shares origins with thunderbolt lightning; its superior-tier power frequently disrupted the original form of the Thunderbolt Longsword, eventually causing it to collapse.\nTo integrate it, Austin embarked on persistent attempts.\nOnce, twice, thrice... Austin sat atop the mountaintop, repeating the process countless times, the cold wind blew past but did not distract him, while the rolling sound of thunder echoed in the frigid winter between the icy heavens and earth.\nTime slowly passed, an unknown duration elapsed.\nAt some point, the thunderous roar in the heavens above finally subsided, layers of rolling clouds dissipated, and the sky that had been obscured for a month revealed daylight once more.\nOn the mountaintop, Austin stood up slowly, exhaled deeply, his weary expression barely concealing the joy within.\n\"Finally, it's successful! A little more nurturing, and its power will be unimaginable!\"\nFeeling the constantly suppressed and accumulating power within himself, his heart finally settled.\nThis retreat not only resulted in the consolidation of an extremely powerful trump card, but during the continuous attempts, Austin's understanding of thunder also advanced to another level.\nNow, even without the harmony of wind and water attribute powers, he can accomplish the magical power Attribute Rasengan's lightning nature change ability.\nThe Thunder Rasengan, among the three attribute powers Austin currently masters, was the hardest Attribute Rasengan to condense, and finally, he achieved a successful manifestation.\nThis was one of the achievements from Austin's latest retreat!\nMoreover, the Thunder Rasengan's power was greater than the simple wind attribute and Water Attribute Rasengan, making it one of Austin's potent trump cards in close combat.\n\"Seems like it's been a month, I should head back now!\"\nWith newfound confidence and greatly increased strength, Austin was in a good mood, spreading his wings, flying swiftly towards the direction of the tribe.",

      "content": "Although Austin was immersed in a closed retreat for cultivation, he was still somewhat aware of the passage of time in the outside world.\nUnknowingly, more than a month had passed.\nAfter spending over a month, he finally created the Thunderbolt Divine Sword, which contained the Thunder Law, and condensed it within himself, day by day accumulating power within it.\nThe Essence, Qi, and Spirit—the three treasures—were extremely concentrated in the heart, nurturing the Thunderbolt Divine Sword contained within the body, constantly polishing and nurturing it, accumulating power.\nHowever, the consequence of this was that all of Austin's domineering dragon awe had disappeared without a trace.\nDue to his aura being extremely restrained within, Austin appeared like an ordinary creature, even giving people a strange feeling due to his form.\nThis is also one of the side effects of nurturing the Thunderbolt Divine Sword, which as an extremely compressed and condensed technique of spirit, Qi, and blood, emerges once and will definitely shake the world; this sword needs Austin to constantly polish and nurture it, whether it's continued spiritual power, magic power, Qi and blood power, or the external dragon awe, all become raw materials for polishing that sword.\nWith these powers as growth materials, the Thunderbolt Divine Sword within will surely surpass the power of all means Austin can utilize.\nIf there is enough time to nurture, slaying a legend with one strike might not be an impossible feat.\nHowever, the price of gaining great power is that Austin's style underwent a sudden and bizarre change.\nThe originally fierce and menacing giant dragon, after having its aura and dragon awe removed, appeared somewhat plump, and formerly Austin's stature and the aura of dragon awe he emitted complemented each other, displaying his supreme dominance.\nBut now, having lost that awe-inspiring aura and dragon awe, he appeared exceedingly strange.\n\"Your Highness, you've returned... pfft...\"\nThis was Vini's first reaction upon seeing Austin return to the Dragon's Nest, hurrying to pay his respects.\nOriginally, Austin found Vini a bit odd but didn't think much of it, casually listened to his report on some recent events in the Dragon Nest Tribe, and then dismissed him.\nHowever, Austin faintly felt something strange, as Vini's words seemed somewhat off as if he were suppressing something, and he walked away briskly afterward.\nAt first, Austin didn't pay much attention.\nBut as he interacted more with the Dragon Nest members, he increasingly noticed their odd behavior; if he didn't realize anything, then he'd truly be a fool.\nWhy did his former subordinates, who revered him as a deity, upon seeing him, their first reaction was to be stunned, then \"pfft,\" as if they were enduring something intensely.\nWhat does this mean?\nWhen Austin walked past the lake reservoir by the Dragon Nest Tribe, he finally knew the reason upon seeing the reflection on the ice surface.\nAlthough the reflection on the ice surface was blurry, it meant nothing to the dragon's vision.\nHowever, at this moment, Austin wished he hadn't seen the reflection on the ice.\nAustin stood dazedly on the ice, with the reflection of himself on the ice layer below.\nThe cold wind whispered all around, turning Austin into an ice sculpture, feeling the bitter chill.\n\"It's gone, everything's gone...\"\nReflected on the ice was a chubby, adorably silly meat dragon, giving Austin the impression of a simple drawing like a child's hand-held Q dragon illustration.\nYes, that's exactly how he perceived it.\nDespite Austin's tightly arranged scales and the radiant gleam, the formidable head enough to scare off any ordinary person couldn't stop the surge of such thoughts when he saw the reflection on the ice.\nGone, everything's gone; that mighty, awe-inspiring figure, the heart-stopping dragon awe aura, all vanished completely at this moment.\nLike the autumn wind sweeping fallen leaves, leaving only a mess behind.\nAustin intended to make a final struggle,\nThus he tried to make a fierce appearance, imagining his previously invincible entrance crushing scenes, taking a deep breath.\nEvil Dragon Roar · Aw~~\nThe desolate cold wind blew past, as if a crow flew overhead, leaving a string of silent colons...\nPoof!\nAustin felt a blackout, immediately spitting out a mouthful of old blood, nearly collapsing.\nThe reflection on the ice gave him the impression of a plump meat dragon, clearly with a silly adorable look, yet trying to pose a \"I'm super fierce\" manner, desperately attempting an Evil Dragon Roar...\nWhat kind of nonsense is this?\nAdorable light shines through, relying on this to intimidate the enemy!\nThe style suddenly shifted from fierce and vicious to a childlike Q version style, especially the usually dominant moves and poses, at this moment turned into irresistibly comedic sketches.\nIt's over, everything's over.\nAustin gazed at the sky, feeling the rest of his dragon life descending into an utter darkness.\nWithout the dominance and dragon awe, his existence was merely a comically silly meat dragon, far from being formidable.\nIn fact, an adult giant dragon after constraining dragon awe and aura, although lacking that suffocating oppressive feeling, the immense physique and ferocious appearance still sufficed to alarm ordinary people.\nThe normal giant dragon appearance ultimately has a formidable deterrence.\nHowever, Austin is not a normal dragon!\nSince breaking out of the dragon egg, Austin's full age is only five or six years, in the thousand-year lifespan of a giant dragon, merely having passed five or six thousandths, and Austin is nothing but in the toddler dragon's infant stage.\nBecause of using electric current to stimulate the physical body since young, the thunder law aura contained within the current accelerated the growth of the physical form, now Austin's form is not much different from a typical young dragon.\nBut the problem lies in the fact that an infant dragon is ultimately an infant dragon, even with accelerated physical growth, the infant stage appearance still exists.\nThe mind of twenty-plus-year-old soul Austin hadn't considered this point.\nAnd in the past, due to the tier difference among giant dragons naturally exuding aura, especially when Austin began awakening the dragon awe, the Beastmen didn't notice this point either.\nThe powerful aura from the Dragon Vein concealed the infant traits on Austin's massive form.\nOrdinary Beastmen dare not stare directly at Austin to carefully observe his exterior, let alone discover the infant traits hidden within the fierce form?\nEven enemies in fight ignored this under the dragon awe aura.\nHowever, now, with the nurturing of the Thunderbolt Divine Sword inside, Austin's entire dragon awe aura is extremely restrained, seemingly vanished, gathering momentum for the Thunderbolt Divine Sword within.\nWith the concealment of dragon awe aura gone, Austin's originally infant-like form was completely revealed.\nAnd it was this very infant-like appearance that caused the dominant force master in Kawa Great Forest, in the eyes of clan members, once mighty, cool, brash, aloof, heartless, slaughtering mercilessly, establishing a tremendously powerful tribe force—the great His Highness Austin—his entire heart plunged into a dark abyss of despair....",

      "content": "\"The life of a dragon is difficult, how unfortunate it is!\"\nInside the Dragon's Nest, Austin sulkily hides in the nest, sighing sorrowfully.\nPresently, he has lost the courage to go out, having to hide inside the Dragon's Nest to eke out an existence.\nWithout his imposing presence and aura effects, Austin's childish form now is fully exposed, clearly visible to others.\nHe misses his sharp-edged appearance, misses the overbearing aura that made others shy from raising their heads easily.\nWithout the overlaying visual effects, Austin feels faint and about to vomit blood at the sight of his own adorable yet silly appearance.\nPerhaps some female creatures might find his appearance irresistibly cute, capable of melting their girlish hearts, but Austin only feels his sense of shame going through the roof.\nDespite Austin's towering size, casting a daunting shadow like that of a house,\nBut,\nWhat's the difference between a fist-sized little yellow duck and a ten-meter-tall one?\nIf someone asked him this question, Austin would despairingly say:\nNone.\nYour appearance is silly cute, no matter how large your size is, it cannot hide the fact of you being silly cute.\nActually, Austin is not without a solution to this silly cute appearance issue, as long as he releases his dragon's aura and grandeur again.\nHowever, releasing the dragon's aura means he must stop nurturing the Thunderbolt Divine Sword, which is a steadfast ultimate technique requiring constant accumulation, and if stopped midway, it would mean the failure of nurturing the sword.\nOr rather, it wouldn't exactly be failed, but the Thunderbolt Divine Sword would merely embody the Thunder Law, without nurturing its potential, its strength would only slightly surpass that of techniques like Thunder Rasengan.\nThis result is unacceptable for Austin by any means.\n\"Alas, compared to a silly cute appearance, living is indeed more important!\"\nCompared to the life-saving means that is the Thunderbolt Divine Sword, he can only sacrifice his outward appearance.\nAfter several days of nurturing, Austin can also feel the gradually rising aura power within.\nIf he continues nurturing for about ten years, defeating a Legendary might not be impossible, and by then, who would dare laugh at his unsophisticated appearance?\nSuch a strong technique, Austin certainly wouldn't give up easily.\n\"Well, going out with this kind of look, I bet others won't be too alert, and then pretending to be weak while delivering a fatal blow when the enemy lets their guard down, that's truly the way...\"\nSeeing the definite change in style becoming a reality, Austin couldn't help but wryly enjoy himself.\nIndeed, with his current situation, without dragon's aura or an imposing presence, the silly cute exterior could potentially decease quite a few people.\nIt seems that the change in style is not without benefits.\nThankfully, when Austin originally established the Dragon Nest Tribe, and controlled the forces of the Dragon's Nest, he didn't solely rely on forceful suppression but employed various gentle methods to win the hearts of the beastmen.\nProviding them with safe shelter and sufficient food, the better living conditions compared to before made all beastmen willingly submit.\nAt the same time, within the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin didn't forget to routinely brainwash, integrating the thoughts of the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nIt was for this reason that even after losing the fierce and menacing appearance, although it caused quite a stir among the Dragon Nest Beastmen, those who revered Austin as the Divine did not harbor any other thoughts, at most it was just a surge of gossip.\n\"These damn guys, seems like their training is still too little! I must intensify their training!\"\nThinking about the previous gossip, Austin suddenly clenched his claw, crushing a stone into powder.\nAlthough the style has changed to that of a silly cute baby dragon faction, the power remains terrifying; treating Austin as a silly cute large Young Dragon would be terribly mistaken.\nSubsequently,\nAs Austin resolved to put aside his shame, the gossip among the Dragon Nest Beastmen started to decrease accordingly.\nBecause the daily training amount among the Dragon Nest Beastmen doubled, and after rigorous training the Dragon Nest Beastmen had no energy left to spread gossip, plus, Austin began walking more within the Dragon Nest Tribe, constantly displaying his \"majestic\" face before the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nSeeing it often, although sometimes they couldn't help but chuckle, it had become a part of their routine.\nMoreover, through this incident, Austin could clearly feel a further bond forming with the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nPreviously, Austin was aloof, with a godlike indifference, a high-cold image being like the Divine, dragon's presence vast, voice booming like thunder, deterring direct gazes.\nBut now, there is a trend of integrating among the beastmen, standing alongside them, stepping down from the lofty status into their midst.\nAnd this, unintentionally, made Austin even more adored in the hearts of the beastmen.\n...\nAs Austin strived to adapt to his new appearance, since the Blue Young Dragon set out three months ago, Gross and his group, \"missing\" for over three months, finally caught the attention of the Blood Claw Tribe.\n\"Impossible! Even if there's heavy snow blocking the way, Gross and his team should have completed their mission and returned by this time!\"\nInside the Blood Claw Tribe, strategist Rulga frowned deeply.\nEver since dispatching Gross three months ago to slay the Young Dragon hiding in the mountain nest, it's been three whole months.\nAnd in these three months, there has been no message from Gross and his team.\nThis might have been due to the arrival of cold winter, hindering message transmission, but a full three months without any news seems peculiar, knowing this timeframe should have allowed for Gross and his team to make one or two round trips.\nSuch a long period definitely indicates something unexpected.\n\"Could it be...\"\nRulga appeared thoughtful, not knowing what he was contemplating.\n\"Someone, go bring Lambert to me.\"\nLambert, the second warrior within the Blood Claw Tribe, whose prowess only trails slightly behind Gross.\nGross' strength is extremely formidable, after an ancestral bloodline transformation reaching the peak of Gold-tier might; unless it's by individuals at Legend-tier or stronger, even severely wounded he'd still escape death, at the very least.\nIn Rulga's view, Gross likely encountered some trouble and got tied up.\nThus, he decided to gather Lambert, intending for him to lead a troop to search for and rescue them.\nAs for the task of slaying the Blue Young Dragon, it's best completed in passing; if not possible, then let it be.\nAs the cold winter nears its end, and the alliance plan with humans soon to be executed, it's crucial to ensure significant combat power to secure the Blood Claw Tribe's standings; even letting a Young Dragon escape won't hinder the plan much.\nGross wasn't solitary; he departed with numerous elite members of the Blood Claw Tribe. Lack of Gross and his elite would diminish the Blood Claw Tribe's capability noticeably, unfavorable to the tribe's interests.\nConsidering the strength of the beastmen subordinates Gross led, if they truly got into trouble, rescuing them wouldn't be a straightforward task.\nTherefore, after summoning Lambert, Rulga personally allocated over half of the remaining elite Extraordinary forces within the Blood Claw Tribe for exploration towards the area occupied by the Blue Young Dragon.\nTheir main task remains exploration and rescue, while Lambert is puzzled by Rulga's advice to retreat immediately if things turn unfavorable.\nThis advice, seeming rather unfinished, left Lambert scratching his head.",

      "content": "Although he didn't understand, Lambert still decided to follow orders and led a part of the elite of the Blood Claw Tribe away.\nThe movements of the Blood Claw Tribe naturally attracted the attention of other tribes within the Tribe Alliance. First, Gross left with part of the elite, followed by Lambert, which significantly reduced the strength of the Blood Claw Tribe.\nAmong tribes, there is no concept of keeping secrets. As long as one is keen, they can gather information within the Tribe Alliance.\nLambert's unusual actions also caught the attention of several Beastmen placed by the Dragon Nest Tribe within the Alliance, who uncovered the purpose of Lambert's movements.\nBack then, Austin, feeling the lack of his own intelligence capabilities, selected several elite Dragon Vein Beastmen for discreet training and deployed them into the Tribe Alliance.\nThese Dragon Vein Beastmen held a certain degree of power. Within the entire Tribe Alliance, they weren't weak. Starting from being mere soldiers, they quickly infiltrated the Tribe Alliance, holding relatively important positions in certain tribes.\nNow, these pawns have finally demonstrated their value.\nThe Blood Claw Tribe never anticipated that before Lambert's departure, the news had already been swiftly sent to the Dragon Nest Tribe via a covert route stationed in a remote area outside.\nIn reality, the main members of the Tribe Alliance are Beastmen. Although Austin in his past life never worked as a spy or agent, he had watched enough spy war films, remembering some of the more straightforward espionage techniques.\nThis intelligence gathered from the essence of modern society's civilization naturally is beyond the simple-minded Beastmen of the Barbaric Land, who solved problems using brute strength, to easily detect.\nBlood Claw Tribe's strategist Rulga, though notoriously cunning, could never have imagined that Austin had already placed spies here due to the disparity in intelligence.\nIn fact, regarding Gross's disappearance, he had some suspicions.\nPerhaps someone was behind the dragon, and it's highly probable that Gross and his elite subordinates perished at the hands of that dragon's allies. In any case, Gross's matter is definitely linked to that young dragon.\nAs for Austin, even if Rulga were more cunning, his intelligence still only registered Austin at the Silver level, making it impossible to guess that Gross was killed by Austin.\nThis marks the disadvantage of lacking intelligence.\nIn truth, if anyone speculated that a young dragon could, within one or two short years, succeed in breaking through ranks, growing from Silver Level to being able to slay experienced Gold High Tier warriors, they'd likely be deemed insane.\nBecause it defies all logic and seemed utterly impossible.\nHowever, this biggest impossibility turned out to be the true reality.\nIt's not that Rulga was stupid. To rise as one of the top strategists within the Tribe Alliance, managing a Beastman population in the hundreds of thousands, one can't be deemed as stupid.\nIt can only be said that outdated intelligence kills.\n...\nWhat transpired on the distant borderlands was unknown to Austin at the time. Before the information arrived, he perhaps would be wary of the Bloody Border but wouldn't devote excessive time or effort to it.\nAs time passed, when Austin had forged the Thunderbolt Divine Sword and had continually nurtured it internally, the cold winter which lasted over two months also came to an end.\nThe passing of the cold winter heralded the start of a new year again.\nWith the melting of ice and snow, the Kawa Great Forest revived with vitality. Some eager grass on the soil sprouted tender shoots before the ice above had fully melted.\nBeasts emerged from their hibernation dens, and animals that had been hungry for over two months began foraging for food wildly in the wilderness.\nThe saying goes that the entire year's work depends on a good start in spring. Although the Barbaric Land doesn't have a spring in the strict sense, Austin habitually regarded the ten days after the cold winter's end and the ice's disappearance as spring.\nWith the arrival of spring, the Dragon Nest Tribe Beastmen, who had rested for over two months, began to stir and enter into work mode.\nAustin didn't immediately start transforming the prepared Extraordinary Beastman seeds to increase the number of Dragon Vein Beastmen, as the demand to enhance the number wasn't urgent for the time being.\nMoreover, since the cold winter had just passed and food was relatively scarce, the number of Extraordinary Dragon Vein Beastmen was a considerable burden for the entire Dragon Nest Tribe.\nFor the Dragon Nest Tribe, the most crucial initial task was still the cultivation of food crops.\nAfter all, food remained the most fundamental resource for maintaining the stable existence of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nNow, the two major threats to the Dragon Nest Base have been substantially reduced with Austin's improved power, giving him the confidence for self-preservation.\nThe threat from zombie undead a hundred miles southwest was resolved. Since the destruction of the first pyramid during the expansion of the undead calamity, no further spreading had dared occur.\nThe region two hundred kilometers away had become barren wasteland, devoid of grass, as though some force had drained the vitality of the entire land. The number of roaming zombie undead had become sparse, seemingly transferred elsewhere.\nAt least for now, the threat of the zombie undead tide over there is not significant.\nMeanwhile, with the continued internal nurturing of the Thunderbolt Divine Sword and the understanding of the Thunder Law enhancing his power, Austin also gained the confidence to face the Blood Claw Tribe directly.\nEven if the Blood Claw Tribe sent more people, he was confident he could resist.\nThe Dragon Nest Base entered a relatively stable environment.\nThe two major threats looming over the Dragon Nest Tribe had been largely reduced, and the thousands of acres of farmland cultivated near the Dragon Nest Town couldn't be easily abandoned, so Austin had the Beastmen continue planting in the nearby fields, restarting agriculture around the Dragon Nest Base.\nAt the first outpost established by the Dragon Nest Tribe, there seemed to be an Elf Realm nearby, frequently clashing with the Dragon Nest Beastmen, and wars occasionally broke out.\nAs the cold winter passed, these conflicts with the elves also grew more frequent.\nThe instability over there made it difficult to conduct stable farming activities for the time being.\nCoincidentally, the vast fields awaiting cultivation near the Dragon Nest Base required farming, where the environment was relatively stable.\nTherefore, at this time when ice and snow melted from the Forest Land, Austin relocated half of the elderly, weak, and production Beastmen, who had previously retreated to the first outpost, back to the Dragon Nest Base to start farming in the wild fields.\nDuring the counterattack against the undead calamity, Austin moved most of the elderly, weak, and productive Beastmen from the Dragon Nest Base to the makeshift post northeast, now the first outpost, in case they needed an escape route.\nAfter the victory in the war, while some of the elderly, weak, and productive Beastmen gradually returned, the subsequent cold winter arrived, leaving a significant portion of them still at the first outpost.\nNow, with stability returned to the Dragon Nest Base region, and with a significant base for cultivation in the prepared vast fields, it made sense to relocate most of the elderly, weak, and productive Beastmen back from the continuously conflicted first outpost for stable production activities.",

      "content": "Every year, after the cold winter passes and spring revives, the entire Kawa Great Forest becomes bustling with activity.\nHunters, prey, magic beasts, giant beasts, beastmen... one by one, the creatures come alive on the forest land, adding vibrant and lively colors to the Kawa Great Forest.\nWith the initial retreat of the cold winter, many beastmen in the Kawa Great Forest, due to tribal poverty, are forced to wander in search of food and vitality in the forest land.\nThis year, as the Dragon Nest Tribe expanded, its mighty reputation spread all around.\nThus, many wandering beastmen passing by the area flocked to seek refuge, with some small tribes facing difficulties even bringing their entire clans to join.\nAt the very least, through interactions over time, nearby beastman tribes all know that once you become a member of the Dragon Nest Tribe, it means you can eat your fill every day.\nHaving enough to eat, for beastmen still struggling on the brink of subsistence, remains an immense attraction.\nIndeed, during these times, along with newborns from the tribe itself, the population of the Dragon Nest Tribe finally surpassed forty thousand, steadily progressing toward fifty thousand.\nFrom initially having only seven and a half kobolds to now dominating a region with a population over forty thousand, it's only taken about four years.\nThis progress not only leaves the beastmen who joined initially feeling shocked, reminiscing about the past in their leisure as if it were just yesterday.\nEven Austin feels that this change is like a dream.\nIt can only be said that this is the timing, this is the trend.\nBeastmen struggling to survive in the Kawa Great Forest live too difficultly. Not only do tribal wars persist for years without end, but they often teeter on the brink of mere subsistence.\nWhen Austin leveraged his own strength to open up this piece of pure land for the Beastman Race and taught them how to obtain more food from the land, thereby freeing them from the worry of famine, such a secure and sustaining life holds immense attraction for the beastmen in the wild.\nMoreover, after the Clan Tribe grew strong, Austin did not stop the process of arming the beastmen.\nThe well-trained Dragon Nest Legion continually launched attacks, sweeping the surroundings, annexing one tribe after another, and assimilating large numbers of captives into the system of the Dragon Nest Tribe, providing invaluable contributions to the tribe's expansion.\nIt's precisely due to these reasons that the Dragon Nest Tribe, established by Austin, has rapidly expanded like a snowball in just a few short years to its current state.\nHowever, the rapidly increasing population also brought a strong food pressure to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nIn the past, there were several instances where the population surge led to insufficient grain to support the tribe's level of expansion. Fortunately, the food obtained from the wild forest was not insignificant, and supplemented by other means, they managed to barely survive one crisis after another.\nNow, with the Dragon Nest Tribe's population surpassing forty thousand and the cold winter just departed, the food pressure looming over the Dragon Nest Tribe is also not insignificant.\nFortunately, with a certain foundation established, the Dragon Nest Tribe can alleviate and endure this pressure.\nMoreover, this year, a type of food that could serve as beastmen's rations saw a significant increase.\nThat is bamboo shoots.\nDuring the initial expansion phase of the Dragon Nest Tribe, there was once a food crisis where Austin led the beastmen to open up new food sources.\nAmong them, the two largest were tender shoots of ferns and bamboo shoots.\nAfter boiling them, the bitter taste of the fern shoots and bamboo shoots can be removed, turning them into an invaluable delicacy that can also fill the beastmen's stomachs.\nAt that time, a special team was set up in the Dragon Nest Tribe to collect these items from the wild.\nAfter developing a fondness for the taste of bamboo shoots, some beastmen continued to plant bamboo cuttings along the riverbank, hoping that in the future, they would grow and produce more bamboo shoots.\nNow, after several years of growth, the areas where the beastmen planted cuttings have successfully grown into a large bamboo forest.\nThis year, as the ice and snow recede, bamboo shoots emerge from the soil, marking a time of bountiful harvests.\nNow, bamboo shoots have become a part of the beastmen's daily diet. Although not the main sustenance, they significantly reduce the food pressure on the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nFacing the food pressure of early spring, the Dragon Nest Tribe already has a set plan and does not need to expend much extra energy.\nFor the entire tribe, the most important thing remains the first sowing of the new year.\nAfter several years of wilderness reclamation, the fields encircling the entire Dragon Nest Tribe have already expanded to a vast area of over ten thousand acres, and this area continues to grow.\nMoreover, compared to the early phase of the Dragon Nest Tribe's development, where most of the reclaimed fields were primarily planted with the single crop arrowroot, the crops planted this year are significantly more diverse.\nUnderstanding the harm of monoculture before having sufficient means to manage pests and diseases, Austin already had plans for diversified agricultural planting.\nBack then, Austin searched within the forest for other suitable crops to plant.\nWild rice, Otherworld yams, earth rice, thorn fruit... Austin tried to plant all kinds of grain crops on the newly opened fields. However, whether due to reasons of yield or seed availability, they couldn't be planted on a large scale and were only tested in some fields.\nInitially, the grain crop with the most promise to compare in yield to arrowroot was this Otherworld yam.\nUnfortunately, at the time, due to problems with yam seeds, large-scale planting was difficult.\nNow, after several years of development, following territorial expansion, Austin has instructed the Dragon Nest Tribe to continue seeking new crops, and the Dragon Nest Beastmen have put Austin's instructions into practice during their campaigns against other tribes and the expansion of the Dragon Nest Territory.\nDuring this time, they also discovered grain crops similar to wild wheat, and before the cold winter, when conquering a beastman tribe, they also found the growing area of Otherworld yams.\nThus, this year's ratio of cultivated grain crops changed.\nThe planting area occupied by arrowroot decreased, and in this year's agricultural planting, arrowroot accounts for 65% of the total area.\nAlthough it still holds the main portion, this situation won't change soon; the high yield and short cycle production advantages of arrowroot are not easily replaced by other crops.\nWild rice, wild wheat, and yams together occupy 30% of the total cultivated area, serving as a supplement to arrowroot, in case the arrowroot crop suffers significantly from pests and diseases, potentially triggering a food crisis.\nAs for the remaining 5%, it's replaced by miscellaneous grains like earth rice and thorn fruit.\nThese grains, although low in output, are very nutritious and, compared to ordinary arrowroot, are far more delicious, making them just the right thing to earn the beastmen's labor points.",

      "content": "The beginning of spring cultivation marked a new chapter in the Dragon Nest Tribe's development for the year.\nWith the busy schedule of the beastmen, the fields they cultivated began to be adorned with tender green colors. If nothing unexpected occurs, this would certainly be another bountiful year.\nWhile the beastmen were busy in early spring, Austin, as the Master of the Dragon Nest, found himself with more leisure time.\nAfter years of development, the Dragon Nest Tribe has formulated a set of simple and feasible laws, allowing Austin not to have to personally handle many major affairs.\nUnless the Dragon Nest Tribe faces an imminent crisis of destruction, don't bother me with trivial matters.\nAccording to Vini, those were Austin's original words.\nThese days, while stationed in the Dragon's Nest, Austin spent most of his time honing the Thunderbolt Divine Sword within him, using it as a medium to comprehend that trace of Thunder Law within it.\nThe winter seclusion had propelled Austin's strength to grow rapidly, and now, continuing to comprehend that trace of the Thunder Law meant an incremental understanding of thunder, unlike the explosive growth of his first encounter with the Thunder Law.\nThe deeper the learning, the slower the progress, and comprehending the Thunder Law is the same.\nThis is the bottleneck of the upper limit. As one approaches it infinitely, the progress becomes slower unless one day Austin can fully comprehend the Thunder Law and condense his own Law Power, reaching the Legendary Level to quickly progress again.\nThough the progress is slow, Austin clearly wouldn't waste time. While daily honing and gathering strength, he comprehends the Law Power of the Thunderbolt Divine Sword within him.\nEven a slight enhancement in strength is a gain.\nBesides, Austin also began to consume large amounts of magic resources.\nWith the advent of spring, the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion went out hunting regularly, collecting herbs containing magic power, which are brought back as nourishment for Austin's growth.\nMoreover, although the Water Patterned Demon Iron Ore in the Wet Bone Forest was mostly collected during Austin's last advancement, the remaining deeper deposits still require more manpower to mine but can steadily provide Water Patterned Magic Iron Ore.\nThe digestion ability of the Giant Dragon Race is tremendously strong, and once these magic-laden substances enter Austin's body, his Magic Power continually increases, steadily advancing his Level Cultivation.\nMeanwhile, Austin did not forget to supplement the Beastman Six Techniques, planned months earlier.\nBoth the Rasengan and Paper Drawing have made gratifying progress.\nAfter a series of explorations, the beastmen's Rasengan took shape, capable of tearing and crushing a wooden sphere in the palm.\nSimilarly, in Paper Drawing, members of the beastmen test group, even when blindfolded, could predict the enemy's attack direction by sensing the feedback of Fighting Qi, dodging in advance.\nBoth combat techniques have already shown signs of success.\nIn due time, as the beastmen test group's members successfully explore the cultivation methods for these techniques, they can be promoted, completing the supplementation of the Beastman Six Techniques.\nOnce the Beastman Six Techniques are completed, the strength of the Dragon Nest Beastmen will certainly reach a new level.\n\"Calm down, carefully feel the rotation of the Fighting Qi in your palms, and use your Spiritual Power to understand the process of the Fighting Qi being rotated and condensed...\"\nOn an open ground within the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin was guiding the Extraordinary Dragon Vein Beastmen in perfecting the development of the Fighting Qi Rasengan.\nAt that moment, Vini, who managed the general affairs of the Dragon Nest Tribe, came hurrying over with a worried expression.\n\"Your Highness, there is an urgent report from the Tribe Alliance.\"\nUpon hearing this, Austin's expression shifted. He recalled his intention to plant spies in the Tribe Alliance at the border; could it be news from there?\nThis was not a suitable place for discussion, so Austin instructed the Extraordinary Dragon Vein Beastmen behind him and then turned to leave with Vini.\n\"What's happening?\"\nBack in the main hall, Austin immediately asked Vini.\n\"Your Highness, according to the report, after Gross and others went out and didn't return, it caused unrest in the Blood Claw Tribe. Consequentially, the Blood Claw Tribe's number one strategist Rulga sent Lambert to search...\"\nVini narrated while taking out a parchment from the tarp and handed it to Austin. These were some intelligence reports summarized by spies hidden over there.\nThis item was delivered by a Centaur after galloping over a thousand miles, and for crossing this dangerous vast area, Austin had also given the Centaur a scale imbued with his aura.\nThere was no other way. The Kawa Great Forest is full of dangers, and without pigeons for messaging, they had to rely on primitive manpower to transport information.\nEven so, crossing such a long distance still posed various dangers. Even for urgent reports, the Centaur couldn't gallop at full speed, causing considerable time delays, which perhaps allowed the people in the Blood Claw Tribe to make their move.\n\"Hmm? Have humans gotten involved?\"\nCarefully reading the parchment, a hint of surprise appeared in Austin's eyes.\nThe sending of people from the Blood Claw Tribe was expected by Austin.\nGross was the top warrior of the Blood Claw Tribe, and with his hundreds of elite subordinates suddenly \"losing contact,\" it would be strange if the Blood Claw Tribe didn't send people to investigate.\nBut why have humans gotten involved?\nAccording to the parchment, when Lambert from the Blood Claw Tribe began gathering Blood Claw elites to set out, humans suddenly visited the Blood Claw Tribe. It's unknown what they discussed with the top ranks.\nSubsequently, the dispatched team was mixed with human warriors. Fortunately, the Dragon Nest Beastman was alert and did not rush to send the information immediately after confirming the Blood Claw Tribe's movement, ensuring this crucial point of the humans joining was not missed in the sent intelligence.\n\"Why would humans send people over? It couldn't be for dragon slaying, could it? No, the Blood Claw Tribe's action this time has a determined purpose. Humans must have learned the Blood Claw Tribe's aim for sending people to accompany them. Could it be their target is me too?\"\nStaring at the parchment in his hand, Austin pondered.\nHis nature was kind, having barely interacted with humans, apart from the time Edward inexplicably hired a Mercenary Corps to attack...\nRecalling that battle, Austin's eyes flickered with an inexplicable light.\nDuring that battle, the mastermind Edward vanished, dead or alive. Could he have survived, and is he the principal reason for the humans' involvement this time?\nFor a moment, Austin considered many possibilities.\n\"Your Highness, how should we respond now? Should we mobilize the army and have the tribe enter a state of war readiness?\"\nVini asked from the side.\n\"No need, I'll handle this personally.\"\nAustin shook his head. The Dragon Nest Tribe was in the middle of spring cultivation and not suitable for large-scale mobilizations.\nMoreover, he also wanted to see the extent of his recent significant progress in strength.",

      "content": "Amidst the lush forest, a column of teams advanced forward in exploration.\nWith the departure of the cold winter, the forest floor revived with vitality. The dense jungle and the wild beasts hidden within significantly affected the team, resulting in their slow progress.\nThe leader, Lambert, was somewhat troubled. The poisonous insects and wild beasts hidden in the dense forest were already a hassle, but the bigger issue was finding Gross's whereabouts.\nSince the day Gross left with his men, it had been over three months.\nIn the vast sea of trees, who knew where that guy had gone? Now they could only head towards the nest of the Blue Young Dragon named Austin, hoping to find some trace of him there.\nGross was most likely alive, but it was unknown what trouble had entangled him.\n\"Ska, I really don't understand why you decided to join our team for this search operation.\"\nAmong the team, there was a group of human warriors.\nLambert found it strange that the group led by someone named Ska decided to join them. Their goal was to retrieve Gross, so why were these people here?\nHowever, despite his doubts, Lambert didn't oppose it.\nAfter all, these humans were Extraordinary Professionals and provided significant support, but their strength wasn't enough to cause any upheaval in the team.\n\"There's nothing much to hide. This time you're seeking the First Warrior of your Tribe, and we're looking for a Blue Young Dragon named Austin who has nested there. Since it's on the way, why not go together?\"\nSka candidly replied, unbothered.\nIn fact, Ska was somewhat surprised that it took the guy beside him half a month to ask.\n\"A Blue Young Dragon named Austin? Do you humans have a grudge against it? If so, you might be disappointed. Half a year ago, traces of the undead had already reached there. The whole Dragon's Nest might have already been engulfed by the sea of undead, and Gross's delay in returning could very well be connected to those undead.\"\nThe initial task Rulga entrusted to Gross was, of course, confidential. However, the movements of the Blood Claw elite led by Gross were hard to conceal, so a reasonable explanation was provided from the start.\nIt was since undead had appeared at the Blue Young Dragon's location, to prevent the undead from spreading, Gross personally led the Blood Claw elite to support the Blue Young Dragon.\nOf course, if their plan were successful, they would claim that upon arrival, the whole Dragon's Nest had been breached by the undead, and the Blue Young Dragon along with its clan had been completely devoured and assimilated by the undead.\nThe execution was naturally Gross's doing.\nBut, being in a remote location, once the Blue Young Dragon and its clan were annihilated and the area ravaged by the undead army, no evidence would be left behind, and they could claim anything they wanted.\nAfter all, it was an orphan dragon without a mature dragon to care for.\nWhat Rulga and his lot needed was a pretext to involve the Dragon Race, a surface-level justification that seemed plausible, and there wouldn't really be anyone going to investigate the truth.\nOnly because of Austin's awkward status did Rulga and the others dare to scheme.\nIf it were a Young Dragon with parents to care for, even if the adult parents weren't always watching, who would dare to provoke a tiger?\nThese underlying reasons were naturally not something Lambert could tell Ska. He was only informed of the truth behind Gross's mission by Rulga before their departure.\nInitially, he truly believed Gross was going to assist the Blue Young Dragon.\nBefore leaving, according to Rulga's speculation, something unexpected might have occurred during Gross's mission to destroy the scene that entangled him at that place, possibly being trapped by those undead.\nThe agreement to let these humans join was also a form of backup evidence...\nGross and his team went for rescue, which ended in failure and resulted in them being trapped nearby by the undead. Given this much effort, how could the Young Dragon's death be suspected as their doing?\n\"Let's hope it really is that way, so we won't have to take such a tiring trip again.\"\nSka was unaware of the internal reasons, only expressing his thoughts.\nThey weren't exactly thrilled about this journey.\nBut thinking about the favorite by the Grand Duke named Edward, and considering the great influence this mission holds as humans and the outskirts of the Kawa Great Forest worked together, Ska knew it was best for him to make this trip.\nThey continued onward without any further conversation.\nHalf a month later.\n\"The destination should be about a hundred miles ahead, right? Didn't they say a long time ago that the undead calamity had broken out? How come there seems to be no sign of it?\"\nInitially, Austin had connected with the Tribe Alliance, voluntarily serving as one of the defensive strongholds, and the Tribe Alliance had sent people to investigate. They were familiar with the area where Austin resided.\nThe surroundings were indeed remote and not particularly abundant in resources.\nBased on information from over six months ago, traces of undead were discovered approximately two hundred miles southwest of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nSubsequently, many things happened within the Tribe Alliance, and at the crucial point of reaching agreements with humans, various open and hidden struggles prevented further contact.\nBased on projections, the area around the Dragon Nest Tribe should have been corrupted by wastelands.\nEven when miles away, the conspicuous sight of rising grey-green death energy should be evident, but currently, no abnormalities were noticed.\nSomething's off, very off.\nWildlife was also abound in the mountains and forests nearby, showing no signs of migration.\nIt seems as if the undead calamity was halted.\n\"Could it be that the undead issue was resolved? And what exactly happened with Gross?\"\nLambert wondered in his heart, exchanging a glance with Ska; doubt was evident in both eyes.\nAt that moment.\nBOOM!!!\nA thunderous explosion sounded from the sky, echoing across the heavens, reverberating in every corner of the sky and earth.\nAt the same time, pitch-black and heavy as mountains, the dark clouds rolled in like a tidal wave from the horizon, covering more than half the sky and quickly overshadowing the heavens above.\nIn the astonished gazes of Lambert and Ska, the entire sky was instantly cloaked with dark clouds, dimming the light, and the continuous roar of thunder rolled across the sky.\nIn the next moment, it was as if a solar tide emerged from the horizon.\nMassive as mountains, vast as an abyss, the overwhelming pressure suddenly descended from the sky, crushing down as if to collapse their very bodies.\n\"What is this! A domain! Could it possibly be Legendary?!!!\"",

      "content": "Within a hundred miles radius of the Dragon Nest Territory, most of the Beastman Tribes have been defeated and assimilated, yet at the territory's edge, some scattered small Beastman Tribes still roam.\nWith the rise of the Dragon Nest Tribe, they began to purge the Magic Beasts and Giant Beasts wandering the forest, intentionally slaying many ferocious Hunters, making the nearby regions somewhat safer.\nTherefore, these small tribes, living by gathering, scattered around, can maintain survival, and life is not as difficult as before due to reduced surrounding dangers.\nFor these Beastman Tribes living by gathering and scattered around, Austin currently has no intention of sweeping in to assimilate them.\nFirstly, the fields being cultivated near the Dragon Nest Tribe's station are expanding further out, making it hard to care for them, and naturally difficult to sustain a larger population.\nUnless the first stronghold expansion succeeds, using it as the core to connect vast land areas, thereby significantly expanding the actual control range of the Dragon Nest Territory, making it safer to cultivate more lands.\nOtherwise, at the current stage, the Dragon Nest Tribe does not intend to increase the population burden.\nThus, these small Beastman Tribes surviving at the edge of the Dragon Nest Territory still exist, but judging by the trend, it may not be long before these scattered small tribes are also absorbed and merged.\nIn fact, they have no complaints about possibly becoming part of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThat day, while these tribal Beastmen were gathering food around the edge of the territory, the entire sky suddenly darkened in an instant, leaving the creatures of the vast area dumbfounded.\n\"Huh! Why did the sky suddenly darken?\"\nIn the hot summer, due to Kawa Great Forest's rainforest-like climate, a heavy rain occasionally is normal.\nBut, no matter how it rains, there are usually signs of cloud covering for a few minutes.\nYet now, the sun was shining bright one moment, and a moment later, the entire sky had turned dark; they had never seen such a sight.\n\"It's nothing; it's probably going to rain.\"\nThe other Beastmen gathering in the woods also sensed something amiss and felt somewhat uneasy.\nAt this moment,\nBOOM!!!\nSuddenly, a vast majesty descended from the sky, covering the whole world.\nIt was like the calm before the storm, but a thousand, ten thousand times stronger!\nIndescribable fear swept through every Beastman's heart; those struggling at the bottom turned pale, instantly falling to the ground, trembling.\nIn this darkened area, the Goblins living at the bottom directly turned pale, foaming at the mouth, fainting to the ground.\nLike an abyss, like a sea! Like earth, like heaven!\nAn indescribable terrifying might surged like an overwhelming tsunami, suppressing the entire world.\nThose ordinary Beastmen living nearby were affected, but those directly targeted by this might, like Lambert and other Blood Claw Tribesmen, felt boundless fear surge up.\nBeneath the vast heavenly might that dimmed the entire sky, Lambert and others felt as small as ants before a sky-piercing mountain, the pressure above them almost crushing them into pulp.\nSome Beastmen with slightly lower strength turned paper pale; under this fearsome might, they seemed about to collapse!\n\"What's happening? A legend? Is it really a legend?!!!\"\nLooking at the dark firmament covered by overcast clouds, endless fear grew in Lambert's heart.\nThings seemed to be evolving towards the most dangerous place.\nAt this moment, a sudden, vigorous rolling of clouds occurred in the darkened sky above, and under the influence of a strange power, layers gathered and converged, forming a massive dragon shadow at the sky's edge! The shadow was hideously ferocious, casting shadows that turned every corner of the world into a dark abyss!\nThe black clouds overturned the heavens, and that horrifying dragon shadow seemed to emerge as a demon from the depths of an abyss, clawing and flailing, filling the world's vision, its pitch-black pupils casting a gaze that made every Beastman feel as if they were falling into the endless abyss of hell.\nBzzt!\nElectric light rolled and exploded between clouds, ripping through the dimness of the sky and earth.\nIn the dark heavens between, a whirlwind swept, lightning flashed and thunder roared, flying sand and rocks, as if ushering in an apocalyptic disaster.\nThat huge Cloud Dragon, formed from black clouds at the horizon, gazed upon them; within its dark eye sockets, there was no sign, yet every Beastman's back dripped with cold sweat, as if falling into icy waters.\n\"You, get out of my territory!\"\nA majestic, domineering voice, like thunder, roared through every corner of between heaven and earth, along with the whirlwind, as if stormy seas crashing against everything in the world, leaving everyone utterly astonished.\nWhose voice?\nFrom where was it coming, could it be the father of that Blue Young Dragon? Wasn't that one an orphan dragon? What happened to those guys like Gross?\nFor a moment, numerous doubts flashed through his mind, Lambert felt as if he had fallen into an ice cave.\n\"S-sir, we are from the Blood Claw Tribe of the Tribe Alliance, this time here to support His Highness Austin to resist the Undead...\"\nAmidst the terror, Lambert hurriedly spoke out, stuttering.\nIn normal times, with a little thought, Lambert would know the best reaction now is to concede, turn around, say nothing, report back to Rulga in the Tribe, and slowly investigate the situation.\nBut under this sudden pressure, with too many uncertainties already clouding his mind, he never thought about the situation where Gross might have failed in his act.\n\"Support? Hahaha, don't you know that Gross, that overconfident fool, came here intending to kill me and ended up getting killed himself? If you don't leave, then die!\"\nThe voice, thunderous, echoed through sky and earth.\nLambert was utterly shocked, Gross actually died, and moreover, died challenging such a powerful existence?\nCountless thoughts surged within his mind; before he could react,\nRumble!!!\nAmidst the continuous roar of thunder, thousands of thunderbolts bloomed in the heavens, piercing light ripped the sky apart, illuminating the entire world, even lighting up the dragon shadow formed by the rolling black clouds.\nThen, abruptly, a terrifying invisible suction force appeared in the sky, dragging the myriad thunderbolts towards the giant dragon's forefront in a gathering.\nCountless thunderbolts gathered, electric sparks tore the sky, but under that suction, seemed like the dying struggle, and in the next moment, formed a glowing orb emitting intense light.\nThe blazing light illuminated the heavens and earth, and at the moment that orb of light appeared, the entire world fell silent.\nAs if all rolling thunder was engulfed and absorbed by that orb of light!\nThe terrifying silence descended abruptly!",

      "content": "\"Not good!!!\"\nAustin and the nearby Ska instinctively leaped up, feeling the terror akin to falling into a dark abyss. Their legs suddenly burst forth with immense power, shattering the soil beneath their feet.\nThe two of them quickly fled in opposite directions, their figures transforming into fleeting shadows shooting away in an instant.\nWith incredible speed, they vanished in a flash, leaving the Beastman subordinates behind completely unable to react.\nAt the same time, in front of them, the empty space appeared like a calm lake starting to ripple. Visibly, the waves spread outwards, as if the void was trembling.\nBefore everyone could even express their horror, the next moment,\nZZzzz!\nA piercing screeching sound spread out, and they saw circles of electric light tearing through the sky, as if the void was suddenly being crushed by some force.\nImmediately, the orb of light suspended in the sky vanished mightily, appearing swiftly before their eyes as if it traversed space.\nPupils of countless eyes rapidly contracted, not having had a chance to show expressions of fear.\nBOOM!!!\nWith earth-shaking and sky-rending explosions, violent blasts erupted, and dazzling light like an endlessly shining sun engulfed everything around.\nThe brilliant white light expanded, and everything in its path, whether person or object, instantly turned to ash.\nA massive white light sphere slowly rose from the earth, accompanied by intense ground vibrations, causing the entire world to lose its color.\nSimultaneously, terrifying thunderstorms erupted around the enormous light sphere, bolts of lightning spontaneously generating from the void, shooting out in all directions.\nBOOM...\nWithin a radius of several hundred meters, thousands upon thousands of lightning bolts exploded like laser beams, with chunks of earth crumbling and vaporizing under the bombardment of arm-thick thunderbolts, and fiery flames soaring into the sky.\nThunder Attribute Rasengan!\nInitially, Austin wanted to change the property within the Rasengan to a Thunder Attribute, aiming to achieve the might of spherical lightning from science of a previous era.\nHowever, Austin later discovered that Thunder Attribute bursts, even slight changes would immediately destabilize the Rasengan due to internal explosions, causing imbalance and subsequent collapse of the Rasengan, making Thunder Attribute modifications impossible.\nTo mediate the power within, he had to infuse wind and water into the Rasengan, forming a super invincible world-crushing compressed Wind-Water-Thunder Rasengan that amalgamated three attribute powers.\nBut now, with Austin's growth, and subsequently stimulating Thunder Law within his bloodline, his control power over thunder has increased greatly after constant understanding of Thunder Law.\nNow, Austin can condense a Thunder Attribute Nature-changed Thunder Rasengan.\nAlthough it doesn't produce the complete \"disappearance\" effect where matter attacks from existence like spherical lightning, eliminating everything at a rule level.\nBut this pure thunder destruction is already sufficient!\nThe Thunder Attribute Rasengan compressed from thousands of thunderbolts, its internal Thunder Liquid temperature is several times greater than the sun's surface, with its sheer heat enough to vaporize all matter nearby.\nAt the moment of explosive impact, the internal constraint of the Rasengan collapses, causing countless lightning strikes to shoot outward.\nThis terrifying explosion and thunder rampage persisted for quite some time, until the vast thunder within was exhausted, the light sphere rose from the ground vanished, and the intense vibrations ceased.\nBillowing dust rose to the sky, covering half the firmament.\nThe mountain range where the team was previously located was directly shorn off by the burst of terrifying power, the surrounding earth already bombarded into an unevenly surfaced pit, with massive cracks spreading around like a spider web.\nAt the very center, molten dark-red soil flowed, emitting scorching light.\nAt the core, the soil even reached a degree of crystallization.\nThe smoke gradually dissipated.\nIt's over, everything is over.\nUnder such terrifying bombardment, even the soil within a hundred-meter radius suffered such disaster-like calamity, not to mention the gathered Blood Claw elite Beastmen and those humans?\nEven though some stronger elite reacted at the last moment, fleeing in all directions.\nBut under such widespread bombardment, where could they escape to?\nIn the end, those who survived would likely be less than one in ten!\nAfter some time, a large, pitch-black hand suddenly emerged from a pile of dirt, followed by a completely blackened shadow painstakingly crawling out of the earth.\n\"Cough cough...that damned Gross...cough cough...didn't expect this to be the ultimate outcome...that Blue Young Dragon...forget it, let's go back first...\"\nThe scorched figure kept coughing, blood trickling from the mouth.\nIt was indeed Austin, the one who fled first.\nIn the moment before the Thunder Attribute Rasengan exploded, he narrowly escaped in the nick of time, evading disaster, but unfortunately was struck repeatedly by the spreading thunder strikes, severely injuring him.\nThis loss was incredibly grievous.\nThe enemy wasn't even confronted, yet the entire force was almost wiped out.\nGross and his people most likely all died.\nUnder the previous attack, now it's estimated that only one or two of his subordinates can barely be found alive, but given the current danger, Austin still resolved to retreat quickly.\nHe wasn't interested in the survival of Ska and those humans either.\nThe priority now is to run, the farther the better, as he wasn't willing to risk facing a second attack.\nThe Blood Claw Tribe's elite suffered two complete annihilations, even the tribe's first warrior was lost, causing severe damage to the tribe.\nIn future days, it likely won't be easy.\nWhile the completely scorched Austin left behind his critically injured subordinates in the ruins and fled rapidly outward, disappearing into the distance.\nAt this moment, atop a certain peak near the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAustin also breathed a sigh of relief, the obscured flicker of mysterious light in his wide-open mouth was swallowed into his body, gradually disappearing.\nSimultaneously, the vast and imposing presence around the world dissipated, and the clouds above scattered.\nThunderbolt Divine Sword!\nThe grand spectacle seen by Austin earlier, akin to the arrival of a legend, was precisely the result of the Thunderbolt Divine Sword nurtured in Austin's realm prototype revealing a shred of power!",

      "content": "After over two months of honing and accumulating power, with daily advancements in nurturing, the Thunderbolt Divine Sword within Austin had amassed an incredibly immense force.\nThe sword momentum, suppressed for over two months, barely revealed a glimpse before it triggered earth-shaking changes.\nAn extremely powerful pressure swept across every inch of space between heaven and earth like a tsunami tide, resulting from the aura leaked from the long-nurtured Thunderbolt Divine Sword.\nThe power contained within that sword, after Austin's continuous accumulation of strength, was comparable to legendary!\n\"The power of this trump card seems to be even stronger than I imagined...\"\nFeeling the thunderbolt divine sword constantly nurtured within, its bloodline connection with him, Austin pondered silently in his heart.\nThe long sword, transformed by thunder, had gained a legendary aura after integrating a strand of the Thunder Law, and combined with the continuous suppression and accumulation, even Austin's dragon might was merged into it as nourishment.\nThe divine sword thus honed, in conjunction with the embryonic form of a domain he explored after his significant increase in strength, had a power not inferior to legendary.\nWithin the embryonic domain, a mere thought could change the celestial phenomena within. Under Austin's extremely precise control, the layers of rolling dark clouds formed as if a sky-swallowing dragon, together with the power emanated by the Thunderbolt Divine Sword, made one believe that a legendary dragon hid here.\n\"After this, there's probably no need to worry too much about the troubles from the Blood Claw Tribe.\"\nA Thunder Rasengan from afar nearly wiped out the majority of Blood Claw elites led by Lambert. Coupled with the previous elites led by Gross, the Blood Claw Tribe was now severely weakened.\nMoreover, with the earlier shown might, comparable to legendary power, Lambert would report Austin's strength to the Blood Claw high command upon his return, and the Blood Claw Tribe surely wouldn't dare to persist obstinately.\nFurthermore, considering Gross's strength, the weakened Blood Claw Tribe could no longer pose much trouble to Austin, who had seen a substantial boost in strength.\nEven without his involvement, the current overall strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe would suffice to fend off intruding enemies.\n\"However, though it may intimidate the surroundings, after this incident, there's not much chance of concealing one's strength anymore.\"\nThe prowess of Austin and his clan followers will undoubtedly spread with Lambert's defeat, and one can only wonder how the Blood Claw Tribe will eventually end up.\nWith this thought fleeting through his mind, Austin discarded it and flew towards the Dragon Nest Tribe's territory.\nRegardless of the response from the Tribe Alliance, with his power and that of the current beastman clan followers, even exposed under the spotlight, they possess substantial confidence.\nAfter all, the entire Tribe Alliance does not have a legendary figure.\nIf there were a legendary-level presence, the countless beasts scattered across the border would have long been unified.\nUpon returning to the Dragon Nest, Austin's routine remained unchanged.\nThe beastmen in the tribe revered the mighty momentum that suddenly erupted from the sky, and upon learning it was caused by Austin, he became enshrouded in mystique among the beastmen.\nClearly possessing an adorable appearance, yet when erupting, it was like a volcanic explosion, echoing through the heavens.\nAustin didn't pay much mind to the discussions and admiration arising from the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThe entire clan tribe has already pledged loyalty under his leadership, and more reverence is merely icing on the cake.\nThe affairs of the tribe seldom require his involvement, so Austin continued into a state of honing the divine sword within.\nBy comprehending the Law of Thunder, his control over thunder greatly increased, reaching a level where he could cast a pure Thunder Rasengan, bringing him immense joy.\nEspecially after witnessing the power of the Thunder Attribute Rasengan, like a Thunderous Paste Lightning Ball forming under high temperature and pressure, melting and evaporating the soil, crystallizing rocks, its power exceeded that of the Wind Attribute Rasengan.\nTasting the benefits, Austin naturally would not give up on introspecting the Thunder Law, now progressing a bit slowly, but advancing daily, one day he would succeed in understanding and autonomously mastering the Thunder Law.\nConcurrently, as the first round of spring tilling in the Dragon Nest Tribe concluded, the climate across the Kawa Great Forest adjusted over more than ten days, entering a true midsummer phase.\nThe entire forest land was vibrant with life, countless beasts roaming the mountains and forests.\nDragon Nest Beastmen, besides their hunts, began systematically clearing some nearby dangerous areas, obtaining numerous magic resource production points.\nThe magical resources yielded from these production points mostly went into Austin's belly, serving as his growth resources.\nWithin his bloodline, after awakening a trace of pinnacle-level law, Austin's bodily shackles seemingly unlocked.\nThe abundant magic resources entering his belly caused no indigestion. All magical resources were thoroughly consumed, steadily raising his level to Gold Middle Tier under massive magical resource infusions, with physical strength continually increasing, as if no bottleneck existed ahead.\nInitially, when Austin decided to gather the beastman race and establish a tribe, he sought revenge against the Blood Wolves who bullied him when he was weak, while also intending to collect growth resources for himself once the clan tribe matured.\nThe magical resources required for dragon growth were enormous, and such cumbersome searches would be challenging for Austin alone to amass sufficient resources in a short time. His initial reason for gathering the clan followers was also to have tribe growth eventually feed back into himself.\nNow, one of the original purposes of establishing the Dragon Nest Tribe has been fulfilled.\nWith the tribe's strength greatly enhanced, the Dragon Nest Legion is now capable of clearing those dangerous areas, turning each into safe resource production bases for magical resources, while also providing certain protective benefits from the gradually strengthening beastmen in the tribe.\n\"Who would've thought that in just a few years, one could develop to such an extent.\"\nRegarding the rapid development of the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin couldn't help but feel the emotion.\nA few years back, there were only seven and a half Kobolds under his command, danger was omnipresent all around, and even a slightest mistake could lead to ruin.\nWho could have imagined that starting from those few Kobolds, the civilization seeds brought by Austin from his past life would be planted among them, took root, germinated, and spread, reaching today's scale in just a few years?\nEven facing the top Blood Claw Tribe gathered at the border poses no fear.\nNo one expected, not even Austin who personally led everything, could have imagined this.",

      "content": "Border region, the headquarters of the Tribe Alliance.\nAs the human forces within the Border Great Wall allied with the Beastman Tribe Alliance within the Bloody Great Wall, vast amounts of grain supplies were transported out of the Great Wall to serve as military provisions for the Beastman Tribe Alliance, causing the already grain-short beastmen to cheer loudly.\nAt the same time, the entire Tribe Alliance was fully equipped and ready, having prepared for a counterattack war.\nOf course, their combat target this time was no longer the humans on the Bloody Great Wall, but the mutated undead from behind, who were the culprits that forced them to abandon their ancestral land and migrate.\nThe arrival of the first batch of grain unequivocally informed everyone that the human forces on the Bloody Border had already allied with the Tribe Alliance on the periphery of the Kawa Great Forest.\nFor the high echelons of the Tribe Alliance and humans suddenly reaching a reconciliation agreement, the lower-level beastmen were utterly shocked.\nOne moment they were in a fight to the death, the next they reconciled and united.\nThis swift reversal left all the lower-level beastmen somewhat at a loss.\nHowever, as time went on, the undead army from behind finally spread forth, and some news about the undead also began circulating, enlightening some in the Beastman Tribe Alliance who considered themselves smart.\nHumans, if they did not want to directly face the endless undead army that followed, supporting them was undoubtedly the most beneficial decision.\nAs the news of the spreading undead calamity began to spread, the initial excitement from the arrival of the first batch of supplies had quietly dissipated, replaced by greater pressure in the atmosphere.\nJust as the beastman tribes were preparing to mobilize their troops and head back to counter the undead army.\nSuddenly, the severely injured Lambert returned to the Blood Claw Tribe in a disheveled state.\nHe was alone, and none of the elite soldiers he took with him made it back.\nThe incident, and the disastrous defeat of the Blood Claw Tribe, was quickly spread throughout the Tribe Alliance with Lambert's return in short order.\n\"Have you heard? Those fools from Blood Claw went to provoke a young dragon, but unexpectedly, there was a legendary backer behind it, and the legendary figure personally took action, resulting in a heavy loss for those guys from Blood Claw.\"\n\"I knew it, you wonder how those guys from Blood Claw had such nerve. That's the Dragon Race we're talking about! Aren't they afraid of the Dragon Race causing them trouble?\"\n\"Who knows, maybe they thought as long as they acted secretly, no one would know.\"\nFor a time, the entire Tribe Alliance was abuzz with discussions.\nThey weren't clear on the specifics, as the heavily injured Lambert went into recovery immediately after returning.\nBut soon, the detailed information was delivered by some Blood Claw elite who were lucky enough to escape and some humans, causing a great stir throughout the Tribe Alliance.\nLegendary, it was actually a Legendary!\nAlthough Austin's true form did not appear in that strike, just from the sheer force of it, there was a high possibility that a Legendary was involved!\nAnd after this event, many beastmen realized that with the Blood Claw Tribe consecutively losing most of their elite twice, their strength had been severely impaired.\nIn large tribes like the Blood Claw Tribe, although the total population was over several hundred thousand, the number of elite extraordinary beastmen would definitely not exceed two thousand.\nMoreover, those fools from Blood Claw even provoked a Legendary, let's hope those powerful figures do not intend to demolish them completely, or else the entire Blood Claw Tribe will surely be exterminated.\nAs such, the entire Tribe Alliance was engulfed in intrigue.\nMeanwhile, the Blood Claw Tribe made no response.\nWith the severe damage to the Blood Claw Tribe, some information about Austin also began to circulate throughout the Tribe Alliance camps.\n\"It's said that young dragon rose in just a few years, quickly gathering a considerable clan force. Those guys from Blood Claw probably saw that young dragon struggling to survive and thought it was just a lone orphan dragon growing in the wild, only to end up breaking their teeth.\"\n\"To reach such a level, that young dragon is probably not simple, its appearance must be savage.\"\n\"You're right. I've heard that young dragon has a terrifying and fierce appearance, its scales clearly defined, its body agile, its wide wings almost covering the sky, and its gaze shoots out an imposing, awe-inspiring power, extremely frightening.\"\n\"It's said that any beastman would be intimidated by that young dragon's fierce appearance, not daring to look up directly at the majesty of the heavens.\"\n\"Truly impressive.\"\nIn their discussions, the beastmen already pictured Austin's ominously fierce appearance in their minds.\nAs the information spread, Austin and his clan's forces began to come into view in the Beastman Alliance at the border, with his reputation starting to spread in a smaller scope.\nA burgeoning reputation.\nStrong individuals inherently have the right to be remembered, especially when they emerge as a new powerful force in the eyes of the beastmen using the Blood Claw Tribe as a stepping stone.\nBeing exposed to the outside world has both advantages and disadvantages.\nThe advantage is that, unless there are other special reasons, there wouldn't be blind enemies challenging you anymore.\nThe disadvantage is being exposed to numerous gazes, preventing you from hiding and leveling up until reaching great success, and in future schemes, the Dragon Nest Tribe will inevitably be drawn into one whirlpool after another, willing or not.\n...\nAustin, far away hundreds of kilometers away, naturally could not know the reactions of the Beastman Tribe Alliance gathered at the Bloody Border.\nLuckily, the distance was far enough, otherwise, upon seeing Austin's appearance, those border beastmen would have been shocked to their core.\nEver since a single Thunder Rasengan obliterated the elite from the Blood Claw Tribe led by Lambert, Austin knew that the threat from the other side of the Tribe Alliance was minimal.\nUnless the entire Tribe Alliance united to attack at once, only the remaining Blood Claw Tribe on the border would pose no threat to Austin and his subordinate forces.\nWith Austin's strength significantly enhanced, he now had the confidence to confront those super-large tribes on the border.\nThe tremendous destructive power generated by a Thunder Rasengan a hundred miles outside the Dragon Nest Tribe was one of his sources of confidence.\nAt this time, with the Blood Claw Tribe retreating, the undead calamity from the southwest also halted, and even the vast hordes of undead in the wasteland were depleted.\nThe two major threats that had been looming over the Dragon Nest Tribe a year ago were now mostly unable to cause much concern, with the sense of danger dissipating.\nThe situation, for the most part, returned to a stable state,\nseemingly ready to enter a phase of peaceful development.\nHowever, Austin hadn't enjoyed peace for long before a piece of news forced him to mobilize once more.\nIn the first base established earlier, a large army of elves suddenly appeared, surrounding the entire fortress of the first base.\nThe conflict escalated!",

      "content": "A few days ago,\nsomewhere within a secret realm.\nThe sky was high and the clouds leisurely, a gentle breeze softly blew, and everywhere you looked, the entire secret realm space was peaceful.\nA light wind swept through the mountains and forests, causing the wild grass on the plains to bow as if forming wave upon wave, and blooming flowers opened in the air, with a faint floral fragrance permeating the atmosphere.\nThis was a world full of flowers, grass, and trees, a peaceful natural space.\nUnlike in the Kawa Great Forest, where resources were fought over and even trees battled to the death for sunlight.\nIf the outside world was a brutal arena of natural evolution, where the weak were meat for the strong, then this secret realm space was like a garden woodland where the god of love had descended.\nEven the breeze in the air was peaceful.\nThis was the secret realm of the Elf Kingdom.\nYet at this moment, around the towering, sky-scraping mysterious tree whose branches spread out to obscure half of the sky and grow out into clumps of forest, the elves living in the entire secret realm were gathering.\nTens of thousands of elves gathered around the branches of the giant tree. These elves, who had lived among trees since childhood, stood scattered like birds on the winding giant branches, watching in solemnity the Elf Queen with long flowing golden hair, skin as white as jade, and a natural crown on her head, standing atop the tree.\nAt this moment, the population of the entire Elf Kingdom was gathered here.\nThe air was filled with a heavy, oppressive atmosphere.\nThis oppressive atmosphere shattered the previous peace of the Elf Kingdom.\n\"Subjects, evil has once again reached our doorstep, seeking to forever annihilate the followers of nature. After a millennium of evasion, it is inevitable to face the final reckoning. Since this is so, let us take up our weapons and deliver one last counterattack to those evildoers; the natural radiance shall never perish!\"\nThe delicate Elf Queen raised her green scepter, emitting tiny green lights that spread like fireflies.\nShe gazed down at her subjects standing on the branches, her voice mournful, filled with a blood-weeping, despairing, and resolute cry that everyone could hear!\n\"For nature!\"\n\"For nature!\"\nThe elves standing on the trees below shouted loudly, and within the borders of the once peaceful Elf Kingdom, a desperate fighting spirit rose to the sky.\nIt felt like knowing you are nearing the end, but still determined to take a bite out of the enemy with desperation and ferocity.\nThe sound waves surged to the sky, shaking the leaves of the giant Mother Tree.\nThe Elf Queen's gaze swept over each of her subjects, old people, children, women... her eyes full of sadness.\nHaving fled for so long, they finally could not escape the fate of final extinction...\nThe Elf Queen's delicate face showed a heart-wrenching despair.\n\"Let's set out! Even if it means death, let us give those evil ones an unforgettable lesson!\"\nHer clear yet resolute voice echoed throughout the space of the Elf Kingdom.\n...\nThe First Stronghold, within the newly established town camping site.\nAt this moment, outside the town camp that was under construction, tens of thousands of elves surrounded the outside densely.\nThe air was heavy, and war was about to break out.\n\"Have these elves gone mad?\"\nWithin the First Stronghold, Dark Elf Adinlek stood upon the city wall built from rows of giant trees, frowning as he looked at the densely packed elves outside.\nIt was an all-out mobilization!\nThis was the first reaction of the Dark Elf upon seeing the external elf army, not only adult elves but even elders and children had taken up arms and gone to the battlefield.\nWasn't it just a partial skirmish before? How did it suddenly turn into this?\nMoreover, the state of these elves seemed a bit off.\n\"Indeed, they've gone mad!\"\nFormer Mercenary Deputy Captain Gory also stood beside him, gazing heavily at the elf army outside, and said in a deep voice.\nSuch an all-out mobilization scene, this approach of everyone from young to old going to battle, that kind of momentum that seems like right before death.\nEverything seemed utterly inexplicable.\nWeren't we just choosing a spot to establish a stronghold?\nSuddenly, a group of elves appeared to obstruct us, and during the tree-clearing process, these damn guys harassed us incessantly, but who knew they would act as if we had some deep-seated blood feud with them?\n\"Captain Gory, do you know what's going on with these guys?\"\nAlthough Adinlek internally harbored dissatisfaction with this companion who often snatched merits, outwardly, they got along well enough. Seeing Gory wanting to say something but stopping, he asked.\nElves, seldom seen by people for millennia, were only occasionally mentioned in some ancient records by Dark Elves.\nIn the Central Earth Human World, there might be more rumors and records related to elves, in some remote places, there also seemed to exist living Elf Realms.\n\"Elves are faithful to nature, extremely devoted to the growth and care of the natural environment. Perhaps our recent tree-cutting activities angered them, but...\"\nTo clear a safe area and obtain enough building materials, large areas of forest land around the stronghold town were felled.\nLooking out, the previously lush forest plains became a devastated mess.\nThis, perhaps, was the reason for angering the elves.\nHowever, there was a sentence Gory had not spoken.\nPerhaps massively destroying the forest environment indeed angered the elves, but it should never have caused such an all-out mobilization scene today, that kind of situation more like a mortal feud, as if knowing they were about to die and deciding to make a desperate final counterattack against the enemy.\nBut, was there a profound bitter feud between the Dragon Nest Tribe and the elves?\nVaguely, Gory felt something was amiss.\nProbably not much.\nAfter all, his understanding of elves was merely hearsay from minstrels; he had never truly witnessed elves.\nThe Dark Elf also felt something was amiss if that was all it took to erupt into such a life-and-death war, it would be too unreasonable.\n\"Let's forget about that for now. Secure defenses first. Since they've dared to initiate war, they must be prepared for complete annihilation!\"\nWithin the First Stronghold, with large numbers of old and weak Beastman militia withdrawn to the garrison, most of the forces within the stronghold consisted of the Dragon Nest Tribe, a full total of eight thousand.\nA well-trained military formation, excellent equipment, combined with a considerable number of Beastman Officers and Junior Officers, and they were defending the city.\nLooking at it this way, it didn't seem like they would lose.\nElf forces surrounded a large number of Dragon Nest Beastmen inside the stronghold,\nThe elves did not act, nor did the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nBefore long, agitation arose among the elf forces, creating a path.\nThe Elf Queen and her surrounding guards walked through the path, standing in the midst of the army.\nThe Queen, with her exquisite face, raised her scepter high and commanded loudly:\n\"Attack!\"",

      "content": "The final remnants of power in the Elf Kingdom began war with the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nOutside the stronghold, Dragon Nest Beastmen and Elves engaged in fierce combat.\nThe Elf army seemed crazed, surging like tides, each Elf Warrior appearing indifferent to their own life, rushing forward desperately to inflict wounds on the Dragon Nest Beastmen, as if harboring deep-seated hatred.\nThe war began with intense close-quarters carnage.\nThe Beastman Legion of the Dragon Nest Tribe were shocked by the enemy's madness, their momentum momentarily suppressed.\nHowever, their usual excellent training kept the Beastman Legion closely knit, raising a Long Spear Array to tightly combat the enemy, relying on the surrounding walls to maintain the defensive line, showing no signs of collapse.\n\"Kill!\"\n\"Kill them!\"\nAn Elf, eyes bloodshot with rage, rushed forward, disregarding the sharp Bronze Long Spear array, throwing a long spear in hand towards the Beastmen ahead.\nThud!\nThe spear pierced the eye socket of a Beastman, instantly penetrating the heavily armored Dragon Nest soldier, who fell to the ground bleeding profusely, creating a vacancy in the dense Long Spear Array, quickly filled by the backup troupe.\nBut the Elf met a grim fate too; before landing, several sharp Bronze Long Spears pierced him, blood splattering.\nEven in death, the Elf stared at the Beastmen with blood-red eyes full of hatred.\nOn the battlefield akin to a meat grinder, the majority of the Elf army displayed such madness.\nHowever, most of the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion wore Bronze heavy armor, making it hard to inflict significant damage unless hitting weak spots. The Elf army's casualties were much higher than those of the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nThough their momentum faltered, the Beastmen, armed exquisitely, stood like iron walls on the defensive line, causing the Elf army to crash one after another into a wall of blood.\nOn the battlefield, fierce aura rose as arrows fell from the sky, Long Spear Array stirred, blood spattered, corpses sprawled across the ground.\nIn this iron and fire clash, many lives perished amidst the warfare.\n\"Gale Wave Triple Kill!\"\nRip!\nGory swung a Bronze Great Sword from above, the sword splitting into three shadowy figures in the air, with an unstoppable momentum, seeming to tear through the air.\nSuddenly, three streaks of white light slashed across, with razor-sharp cutting power, sweeping in fan shape in front, extending over ten meters in range.\nThe Elves blocking in front were almost instantaneously felled or harmed as the three streaks of light swept past, sent flying, limbs severed by the sharp energy, blood spraying everywhere, clearing a large area ahead, riddled with shattered Elf bodies.\nNot long ago, former Mercenary Deputy Captain Gory gained the Gale Wave cultivation method through merits earned since joining the Dragon Nest Tribe, developing the powerful Triple Kill combat technique in the cultivation process combined with his combat experience.\nUsing it for the first time in battle yielded such remarkable success.\nDespite obtaining the coveted Secret Techniques, Gory was not yet ready to leave.\nFor the Secret Techniques circulating in the Dragon Nest Tribe comprised six forms, each as effective as Gale Wave, and he had only learned Gale Wave, with five forms yet to be mastered.\nMoreover, Gory had a lingering thought that if the Dragon Nest Tribe continued expanding at this pace, perhaps in less than ten years, it might grow to rule the entire Kawa Great Forest, establishing a kingdom.\nShould he gamble on this?\nGory remained undecided, thus planned to stay for a while longer in the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAt least, he needed to master the remaining five forms of the six forms.\n\"What's the matter with these damned fellows?\"\nThe battlefield chaos soon dragged Gory's mind back to reality; seeing the Elf army charging fiercely again, Gory couldn't help but curse.\nThe longer the battle lasted, the more inexplicable it seemed to Gory.\nEarly in the first stronghold's establishment, Beastmen encounters with Elves led to conflict.\nDue to the inability to locate the Elf's lair, only passive retaliation was possible.\nRepeated conflicts weren't intense; many were harmed but fatalities were few, maintaining a low-intensity skirmish.\nAt that time, it was thought little of, by Austin, the Dragon Nest Tribe's Lord, included.\nEstablishing strongholds and claiming new territories naturally warranted retaliation from former territory owners.\nWhether other large Beastman Tribes, powerful Lords of Magical Beasts, or Demon Beasts..... before stronghold establishment, Austin and the Dragon Nest Tribe leadership were prepared.\nThe surprise was merely due to the opponent being Elves.\nHowever, no one anticipated the Elf's counterattack would suddenly escalate to such a degree.\nLose the territorial dispute and move elsewhere to continue development was the usual response.\nYet these Elves seemed to harbor mortal enmity against the Dragon Nest Tribe, unyielding in their vendetta.\n\"Do Beastmen and Elves have some deep-seated animosity?\"\nAt initial contacts and conflicts, meeting Elves had similarly bloodied eyes, like seeing a father's killer.\nPerhaps, Elves and Beastmen were indeed mortal enemies; otherwise, this situation wouldn't occur.\nVague suspicions brewed within Gory's heart.\nHowever, how things actually were possibly awaited post-war outcomes, only determined after defeating the attacking Elves.\nReflecting on a strategy he previously proposed, Gory's lips curled slightly.\nIt remained unknown, after following his plan and defeating the Elf army, how great his accolades might be...\nBut patience was essential, as it wasn't yet the optimal moment.\n\"Slay! Exterminate these damned dwarfish creatures!\"\nGory roared, gripping his Bronze Great Sword, charging first into battle with the Elf army.\nSeeing their superior so valorous, the surrounding subordinates responded as if invigorated, charging forward yelling.\nThis battle's duration was uncertain, with the Elf army crazily assaulting the stronghold while the Dragon Nest Beastman army steadfastly defended like the Iron Wall Great Wall.\nThe battlefield seemed a meat grinder, grinding flesh back and forth.\nAs time elapsed, both sides showed fatigue due to the fierce struggle, the Elf army also exhausted from heavy losses.\nAt this moment,\n\"The moment has come, cavalry charge!\"",

      "content": "The tug-of-war on the outskirts of the stronghold exhausted soldiers from both sides greatly.\nFighting to kill requires stamina, even for the bloodthirsty Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers.\nIn the blood-and-flesh tug-of-war, both Dragon Nest Beastmen and Elves reached an almost critical limit.\nThe Elf army, due to more casualties in the previous tug-of-war, found themselves at a disadvantage, with energy particularly depleted.\nJust at this moment, the backup troops hidden by the Dragon Nest Tribe finally moved out!\nYears ago, Austin divided the Dragon Nest Tribe's military into three corps by category: cavalry, infantry, and archers.\nIn the defense battles, infantry and archers played the largest roles; the previous tug-of-war was mainly led by infantry and archers, with the cavalry not yet seen.\nThe cavalry was hidden inside Stronghold City, holding back and waiting for the right moment.\nIn previous patrol conflicts, battles between Dragon Nest Beastmen and Elves hadn't see the cavalry because patrols in the mountains and forests weren't well suited for cavalry members.\nBut this didn't mean there were no cavalry within the first stronghold.\nTo maintain the transport link between the first stronghold and the Dragon Nest Tribe's base, thousands of Centaur cavalry often patrolled between the two places, ensuring the safety of transportation routes.\nConveniently, before the Elf army's siege, the Centaur cavalry had just escorted a convoy of supplies and were resting within the stronghold.\nIn the previous siege battles, the role of Centaur cavalry wasn't significant during defense.\nWith experience from the Human Worlds, Gory suggested keeping the cavalry hidden within the city, preserving strength, and waiting for the Elven army to wane and prepare to retreat, suddenly attacking to catch them off guard.\nAdditionally, the transport bulls had been organized, equipped with Bronze Armor, controlled by Dragon Nest Beastmen warriors, enough to assemble heavy cavalry.\nDue to the intentional training by the Dragon Nest Tribe, the entire tribe had over two thousand adult bulls, being the pivotal transport force connecting the bases and strongholds.\nYears before, Austin had trained heavy-armored cow cavalry, though training was discontinued due to cost-effectiveness issues.\nYet after that attempt, Beastmen gained some protocol for organizing heavy-armored cow cavalry.\nThus, two thousand cow cavalry plus one thousand Centaur cavalry assembled within the first stronghold, silently awaiting the right moment.\nThree thousand cavalry silently hid within the stronghold.\nNow, the time had come.\nFollowing the \"cavalry charge\" command, the gates of the stronghold opened with a roar, kicking up clouds of dust.\nAnd then,\nBoom boom boom....\nContinuous, low thunderous sounds followed, with the ground softly trembling.\nUnder the astonished gazes of the withdrawing Elven army, the Dragon Nest Beastman legion opened a great channel, and with rolling thunder, cavalry like a tidal flood approached, carrying the power to trample and consume everything!\nBoom!\nCaught off guard, the Elven army couldn't respond as the surging cavalry charged forth, directly colliding with them.\nThe front-line Elves were hit by the tsunami-like cavalry, churning them into minced flesh instantly.\nLike a mountain torrent, the charging cavalry force was unstoppable for the smaller Elves.\nIn just a brief moment, the Elven army was directly pierced by the cavalry from end to end, like a cake sliced into two parts, unable to connect.\nOn the split road, bodies intertwined, blood and flesh flowed, a scene of carnage.\nNow, the cavalry that had pierced through the Elf army turned around, showing their fierce claws to the remaining Elf remnants.\n\"It's over!\"\nIn the middle of the army, the Elf Queen's face paled, her legs almost powerless to keep her standing.\nAt the moment the cavalry appeared, she knew this war was thoroughly lost, and she and her subjects were doomed.\nBefore the war broke out, there was still a sliver of hope.\nBut now, the last bit of hope shattered completely.\n\"Ancestors, is this the end of the Elven Kingdom's glory...\"\nThe Elf Queen muttered pale-faced, distracted.\n...\nAs the sun set, the war drew to a close.\nThe sunset was as bloody, painting the sky and earth in red.\nThe whole stronghold was devastated, and the outside ground piled with bodies, blood pooled into rivers, staining the land.\nThe Beastmen quietly walked across the battlefield, tidy corpses one by one.\nCrows flew overhead, making bizarre cries.\nThis inexplicable war began with an Elf attack, ending with their defeat.\nIn the final cavalry charge slaughter, the previous tens of thousands of Elven troops ended with half fleeing, the remaining either dead or captured.\nNot long afterward,\nWhoosh whoosh!\nThe wind whipped up in the sky, bringing along a dark cloud that quickly covered.\nAustin's enormous figure descended from the sky, and around came the Dragon Nest Beastmen high command who organized the battlefield.\n\"Was I too late...\"\nLooking at the surrounding scene, such a thought flashed in Austin's mind as he kept his face impassive.\nAfter receiving the urgent report, Austin immediately flew over to the stronghold, only to find he missed the war after all.\nYet it seemed right, it appeared his side has won.\n\"First tidy up the battlefield, take care of the wounded, tally the damage, and then report to me.\"\nSeeing Rodney, Dark Elf, Gory, and others approach, Austin instructed directly.\nWith Austin holding the fort, the stronghold naturally became much safer, urging the Dragon Nest Beastmen to quicken the battlefield clean-up.\nIn the end, from the tally, in this battle Dragon Nest Beastmen suffered 731 deaths and 2,123 injuries.\nThis death rate almost reached a ratio of ten to one.\nIt can be said this was the highest death toll since Dragon Nest Tribe was established.\nHowever, in comparison, the Elf death toll was greater.\nDue to the sharp weapons of Dragon Nest Beastmen and the final cavalry charge, many Elf bodies were shapeless and difficult to identify, unable to count accurately, but rough estimates were at least over ten thousand killed.\nAlmost ten times the Dragon Nest Beastmen casualties.\nMoreover, four to five thousand Elves were captured, with more fleeing and difficult to trace.\nFew captives were due to the Elves' desperate resistance.\nBut the more crucial reason was during their retreat; the Elf Queen suddenly brought out a mysterious Divine Artifact, creating a gigantic Wind Barrier, blocking Dragon Nest Beastmen's pursuit, securing enough time for numerous Elves to flee.\nThe loss so great made Austin clearly somewhat angry upon arriving.\nYet he knew the Beastmen had done well in this war.\nCurrently, the most important thing was to pry open the mouths of those captured Elves, to find out what all this was about!",

      "content": "Conflict and war are not uncommon in this barbaric forest region.\nWanting to occupy more territories, wanting to plunder more resources, and wanting to gain more, so that the Clan Tribe can strengthen more quickly, makes conflicts with other forces absolutely unavoidable.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe has developed to its current state, having gone through countless wars, relying on the strategy of sustaining itself through war, which has allowed the entire tribe to expand to the extent it is today in a short period.\nIt was expected that the expansion of the first stronghold would meet with backlash from the local forces.\nHowever, the behavior of these Elves was beyond the expectations of all Beastmen, including Austin.\nAustin was eager to understand why the Elves made such a choice.\nAfter all, in this barbaric world where only the strongest survive, isn't it quite normal to submit or flee if one cannot win? So why fight to the death?\nFurthermore, these Elves appeared mysteriously and disappeared just as mysteriously, with no trace at all, leaving the Dragon Nest Beastmen unable to find any clues. Where exactly have they hidden their lair?\nSoon, after interrogating the Dragon Nest Beastmen, a result was quickly obtained.\nAmong the thousands of captured Elves, not all were tough; some were willing to disclose information.\nJust as Austin and others suspected, their entire Elf Kingdom held a grudge against the Beastmen, a deep-seated blood feud.\nLong, long ago, perhaps a thousand years ago.\nThey lived in the central core of the Kawa Great Forest, with a population in the hundreds of millions, living in peace and happiness, establishing a paradise in the resource-rich core of the Kawa Great Forest.\nThe Elves cherished peace and loved nature; it was a peaceful country, a utopian paradise.\nBut then, a thousand years ago, peace was shattered.\nThe Beastmen launched a rebellion that swept through the entire kingdom, ultimately reducing the kingdom to ruins, and the Elf Kingdom that virtually ruled the entire Kawa Great Forest was thus destroyed.\nThe remnants scattered, fleeing in disarray under the pursuit of the Beastmen to the borders, barely escaping the hunt, and eventually hiding and settling nearby.\nThe once-prosperous kingdom was destroyed overnight, leaving their families shattered and people dead, with the remaining population being pursued thousands of miles by those Beastmen, their family and friends having fallen under the weapons of the pursuers, and the blood feud between them being indelible.\nThe Beastmen were powerful, and given the current weakened state of the Elf Kingdom, talking about revenge was impossible; they could only survive, struggling to recover their Primordial Qi.\nThe remaining Elves relocated here, relying on a \"Mother Tree\" snatched during the kingdom's destruction to prop up a vast Secret Realm Space, and established a Secret Realm in the vast forest for survival.\nThis Secret Realm is a space supported by all the trees in this area of the forest, and once the trees in this area are felled, the entire Secret Realm will ultimately be exposed.\nWhen the Dragon Nest Beastmen suddenly established a stronghold nearby, the Elves naturally suspected the arrival of their great enemy.\nBefore the Elves could confirm the situation, as soon as the Dragon Nest Beastmen began building camps, felling large numbers of trees and undermining the foundation of the Elf Kingdom's Secret Realm Space, they were sure the enemy had arrived.\nFor the Forest Land is their base, so it must be an enemy familiar with their details who discovered their hiding place, meticulously clearing the forest trees.\nNo Beastman Tribe in the Barbaric Zone could possibly possess such a well-equipped and well-trained army of thousands unless it was traitors from the core area of the Beastmen.\nThus, a do-or-die war naturally erupted.\n\"Is this truly an unprovoked disaster?\"\nAfter hearing the reasons from the Elven prisoners, Austin could only feel speechless.\nAs the confessions of the Elves spread, the relentless, vengeful combativeness displayed by the Elves in this war was also explained.\nIt turns out they regarded us as their old enemy.\nBuilding cities, cutting trees, and numerous well-trained Beastman troops made the Elves, who lived enclosed in a single space, believe that the Dragon Nest Beastmen were their life-and-death foes pursuing them.\nAccording to the Elven prisoners, the seed of their only \"Mother Tree\" was already planted and could not be moved, and once they lost the Mother Tree, all the Elves' future would spiral into despair and destruction.\nThey couldn't escape, nor could they run.\nWith no escape, naturally, they must fight back desperately, leaving a profound lesson for their enemies even in death.\n\"Even though this war was caused by a mere misunderstanding, the conflict with the Elf Kingdom was bound to happen. The tribe needs to establish strongholds nearby and prepare for development, which inevitably involves felling the nearby forest trees.\"\nUnderstanding the cause of the matter, Austin pondered silently.\nThe war was an unlucky occurrence.\nBut even for this misunderstanding.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe suffered too many casualties; the Elf Kingdom must pay the price for this!\n\"Vini, go and pick a few clever Elves and send them back with a message for the Elf Queen.\"\nAustin is a tolerant, pure-hearted, kind dragon.\nHe considered himself benevolent, cherishing life, disliking slaughter, and not wanting to see more lives lost due to warfare.\nBut his poor subordinates suffered heavy casualties due to the Elves' foolish actions.\nThis must be accounted for.\nThus, he gave the Elves in the Elf Kingdom a choice.\n\"You have only one path, and that is to unconditionally submit to me!\"\nWith Austin's message, a few Elves who had been informed of the truth about the Dragon Nest Tribe were released, setting off on their return journey.\nAs for whether their surrender was successful, Austin wasn't too concerned.\nBecause whether they submit or not, the result would be the same, ultimately becoming annexed by the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nIf they genuinely refused, Austin would personally visit them to make them understand the principle that might is right.\nUnfortunately, many Elves would certainly die in the process.\nAlas,\nSighing for the lives that might be lost again in the future, Austin lamented, for he was a good dragon who disliked slaughter and loved all living things.\n\"The fallen Elf Kingdom, the rebellious Beastmen, the core area... it seems the undead zombie tide might originate from the core area. Could there be any connection between these?\"\nWatching the few released Elf prisoners gradually disappear beyond the stronghold, Austin pondered silently.\nThe remnants of the Elf Kingdom are destined to be annexed this time.",

      "content": "Austin is a good dragon.\nSince his birth, the orcs who have died under his claws can be counted on one hand. Apart from those who insist on courting death, the kind-hearted and magnanimous Austin has hardly ever deliberately killed anyone.\nSuch a dragon, compared to those irritable Lords of Magical Beasts who kill innocent intelligent beings indiscriminately, can be regarded as an absolutely good dragon.\nAs for those orcs who died in the process of the Dragon Nest Tribe's expansion when the Dragon Nest Beastmen's army swept through,\nAustin said:\nIt was the Beastmen of my Clan who did it, what does it have to do with me?\nIsn't that right?\nAs for the hundreds of Blood Claw elites and humans who were killed inadvertently by a Thunder Rasengan before.\nOriginally, he only intended to attack the orc named Lambert and the human named Ska. You were so close to those two guys and got killed by the aftermath. What does it have to do with him?\nWho told you to be so weak that the aftershock's energy killed you?\nFor these lives, Austin absolutely refuses to take responsibility.\nHe is a good dragon, a kind-hearted dragon.\nBut even a good dragon can't help it.\nThose elves are so ruthless. After a big battle, nearly a tenth of the clan's Beastmen from the tribe base were lost, not to mention the countless injured.\nEven if Austin is an exceedingly kind dragon, he can't just let it go after so much damage to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nUnless all the elves remaining in the Elf Kingdom surrender and submit.\nOnce they become family, all those grudges will naturally disappear.\nWasn't it always like this before?\n\"Just right, since these remaining elves are remnants of the Kingdom and can still get that precious Mother Tree, there might be a royal among them, who must know something more about the core area, perhaps they can be asked one or two questions.\"\nInitially, the tribes near the border claimed that the zombie undead tide came from a mutated Evil Spirit in the core area.\nBut later, upon careful consideration, it's easy to realize that things are not that simple at all.\nBehind the zombie undead tide, there might be a mastermind with intelligence driving all of this.\nIf there wasn't intelligence, how could plans be designed, with the first warrior of the Blood Claw Tribe also being their spy?\nMoreover, this mastermind has a certain level of influence.\nAt least, to make Grom submit, willingly acting as a spy placed in the Blood Claw Tribe, without certain skills, this would be impossible.\nAustin is quite a distance away from the core region of the Kawa Great Forest. Based on estimations, if an orc were to traverse the distance, it might take at least half a year to cover it.\nThe vast distance also leads to a blockade of intelligence.\nInformation about the core area is entirely unknown to Austin.\nEven though the Giant Dragon's inherited memory includes a rough map of the Kawa Great Forest, there's no interest in noting these minor insect powers in the wilderness.\nTherefore, if the Elf Kingdom could be subjugated, and some information about the core area of the Kawa Great Forest extracted from the Elf Queen, it would be immensely important for Austin to understand the specific conditions of this wild region, and perhaps determine something.\nRebellious orcs, the Elf Kingdom, the zombie undead tide, the Tribe Alliance... among these, there might be some connections.\nOf course, this goal is just incidental,\nit is incidental.\nBeing a good dragon, how could he consider destroying an Elf Kingdom just to extract some intelligence?\nAfter sending the captured elves back, Austin also dispatched some elite Beastman Officers to follow closely, gathering some information.\nOddly,\nsomewhere in the forest, the captured elves did something unknown, and suddenly a ripple appeared in the air, they seemed to have crossed space, as if entering another space directly from the ripple.\nThe next moment, the ripple in the air disappeared, and it was as if nothing had happened.\nExcept for those few missing elves.\nA Beastman Officer probed a bit and found that the place seemed to have an invisible wall blocking the way.\nRegarding this, Austin showed some interest.\nHowever, he did not immediately make a move to personally test the strength of that invisible barrier's defense or the specific details of the Elf Kingdom.\nBefore doing so, he gave the Elf Queen three days to consider.\nThree days are three days.\nIf they surrender directly by then, and he runs to attack their lair, wouldn't it be embarrassing?\nIt's only three days, waiting does not hurt.\nThis battle was too costly, even though it resulted in a ten-to-one outcome, it was the greatest loss ever for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nEspecially with so many wounded after the war, making the cleanup and organizing of the battlefield an intricate matter.\nCleaning up corpses, taking care of the wounded, restoring buildings, transporting materials... there are many such trivial matters, quite troublesome.\nAustin stayed in the base, while the orcs did the tasks such as counting casualties, clearing the battlefield, and reflecting on the mistakes and oversights in this war under command.\nThis war, although the casualties were not low, was still done to the limit.\nThe Dragon Nest Legion is well-trained and armored in heavy armor, but thick armor does not cover every part of the body, and the elves' archery is naturally strong; hitting an eye socket from tens of meters away is not impossible. Coupled with the elves' desperate counterattack, achieving a ten-to-one casualty exchange rate is already quite good.\nThe most important thing is, the elves are not weak in magic either.\nExcellent archery, various magic, along with desperation, such a coordinated elven army's combat power was almost unimaginable.\nIf it were any other orc tribe's army of the same number, it might not even be able to withstand the elven counterattack, let alone thousands or tens of thousands of casualties.\nThough, despite this, this battle also exposed a problem with the Dragon Nest Legion.\nThat is, the Dragon Nest Legion is filled with warriors but does not have any magic output units!\n\"There is no rush for this. When the remaining parts of the Elf Kingdom are annexed, this point can naturally be completed.\"\nOnce this Elf Kingdom is annexed, not only can the entire kingdom's wealth be amassed but also many of its magical knowledge systems can be acquired and promoted within the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nMoreover, the Elf Kingdom itself has many spellcasters, who, after being slightly trained, can also be directly integrated into the legion to compensate for the lack of magical output capability.\nTime passed slowly,\nduring these three days, the Dragon Nest Tribe remained in recuperation after the battle, and Austin made no move.\nAfter three days, there was no news from the Elf Kingdom.\nAs expected.",

Who was it that incited those young ones back then?\"\n\"It's you, it's you, it's all you!\"\n\"You should be responsible for the death of those thousands!\"\nAt this moment, within the Secret Realm of the Elf Kingdom, the Elf Elder Council is mired in disputes.\nThe elders are arguing fiercely, almost coming to blows.\nSince the elf prisoners returned to deliver the message to the remaining elves of the kingdom, the entire meeting has persisted in such a manner.\nWhen the Blue Young Dragon's influence spread within the Elf Kingdom after the war, all the remaining elves experienced a mix of surprise, relief, and then anger.\nThe surprise stemmed from realizing that the attackers this time were not their old mortal enemies, not dispatched pursuers from the core region's traitors, stirring up a sense of post-crisis relief.\nBut simultaneously, they were angered by the brutal war caused by a misunderstanding, with only one-third of the elves escaping back after the final battle.\nThe misjudgment led to massive losses.\nOriginally, there were better solutions that could have been implemented.\nBut now, the Elf Kingdom has been driven further into the abyss.\nThe catastrophic war failure demands accountability, yet, at this moment, the highest decision-making body of the Elf Kingdom, the Elder Council, is caught in chaos, elders pushing blame, abusing each other.\nWith the enemy impending, the council is on the verge of collapse.\nIn the conference hall, the Elf Queen sits high on the throne, gazing at the quarreling elders below with bewilderment on her flawless, alabaster face.\nBefore the war began, launching the assault was the result of a unanimous decision by the elders.\nAnd now?\nSeeing the dispute continuing for three days and nights, the Elf Queen had no choice but to step forward.\n\"Everyone, please stop quarreling. This time, it was my fault. As the queen of the tribe, I failed to carefully consider before making a decision. The order for battle was given by me, and all responsibility lies with me.\"\nThe Elf Queen's words signified that she was taking all the blame for the war upon herself.\nHer face revealed silent anguish and regret.\nIf, from the start, she hadn't given the order to commence the battle but had insisted on investigating thoroughly before making a decision, the casualties in this war wouldn't have been so severe.\nAs the Elf Queen finished speaking, the conference hall fell into silence.\nActually, everyone knew that each of them present bore some responsibility, but since the Queen was taking all the blame upon herself, there was no need to push it further.\n\"Elders, let's focus on the warning from that dragon. Three days have passed.\"\nThe Elf Queen said softly, burying her sorrow deep in her heart.\nThe topic finally shifted to the serious matter at hand.\nYet, this time, the argument was even more intense than before, with several short-tempered elders leaping up, slamming their palms on the table.\n\"We absolutely cannot surrender! After so many people have died, to ultimately bow to that ridiculous dragon is simply disgraceful!\"\n\"No matter what, we retain the dignity of royal lineage; surrendering to a group of Wild Tribe is unacceptable—we'd rather starve, fall from the Mother Tree and die, than surrender!\"\n\"But that Blue Young Dragon and its army are still camped outside; how can we deal with them?\"\n\"We have the Mother Tree, the Secret Realm; the kingdom is our home ground! And we have the royal Sacred Artifact—if those Wild Tribes dare to invade, the kingdom's depth is enough to destroy them!\"\nSurrendering is not an option!\nThey feared those damn traitors only because the traitors knew their own depths and would come with restricting means.\nBut a mere Blue Young Dragon imagining it could obliterate them?\nAbsolutely impossible!\nWithin the Elder Council, a decision was made on Austin's final notice.\nDespite one or two dissenting voices, they were of little consequence.\nHow could the bloodline of the ancient royal lineage truly surrender to a Wild Dragon and a group of beastmen?\nIndeed, Wild Dragon and beastmen.\nThe once noble members of the Elf Royal Court, occupying the richest lands in the core region, ruling over millions of square kilometers, were entitled to look disdainfully upon the crude beastmen struggling at the fringes of the Kawa Great Forest.\nThose lowly beastmen creatures appeared to the proud elven citizens as beasts—pigs and dogs.\nMuch like how city folk might regard country bumpkins from remote areas, the pride here is magnified hundreds, thousands of times between elves and wild, barbaric beastmen.\nAn elder, with a proud expression, exclaimed loudly in the conference hall:\n\"That dragon imagines we'll surrender and serve—it simply cannot happen. He'll need to break the Secret Realm Space upheld by the Mother Tree first...\"\nBefore the words were finished,\nCrack!\nSuddenly, a faint cracking sound spread quickly.\nThough faint, this sound traveled throughout the Secret Realm Space where the Elf Kingdom resided, clearly reaching every creature's ears.\nNo matter what they were doing or discussing, they heard this not loud but clear ice-breaking sound.\nWhat is it?\nThe elves looked up at the sky in confusion, tracing the sound's origin.\nThe sky has collapsed!\nEvery elf who witnessed this opened their mouths wide, astonishment beyond verbal description.\nBut lo and behold, the sky was like a massive block of ice, with cracks spreading across like a spider web, emitting a crisp cracking noise.\nThe shattered fragments fell like snowflakes from the sky, resembling a heavy snowfall.\nAmazement, shock, fear—countless emotions arose from the scene.\nThe spread of cracks did not last long, only for a moment,\nCrash!\nIt was as if a sheet of glass was smashed by an Iron Hammer, and the sky abruptly collapsed, revealing a huge opening, where fragments fell swiftly like hail, accompanied by a massive, fearsome dragon claw glowing a ghostly blue, tearing through.\nAt the center of the claw, a huge azure energy light ball gradually dissipated.\nThat was the energy light ball that shattered the barrier!\nBolts of lightning cracked across the sky, as clouds gathered at the horizon without warning, the entire space whipped into a frenzy, swirling with sand and stones.\nThe daylight dimmed across the entire realm, a pressure beyond description slowly spread out, filling every corner of the space.\nLike a looming storm, yet the oppression surpassed by thousands, tens of thousands of times!",

Three days have passed, what is your decision?\"\nAustin looked down from the sky at the elves as tiny as ants, among the billowing clouds, his overwhelming might made him appear as towering as the sun blocking the sky and earth.\nIt gave every elf within the kingdom an immense pressure.\n\"Don't even think about it!

intelligence urgently gathered in the past few days, that Wild Dragon was merely a Young Dragon, a wild orphaned Young Dragon with no parental care!\nThis would not make a good master, lacking the guidance of adult parents, not to mention whether it could smoothly cross into Legendary, even reaching adulthood was uncertain.\nTheir deeply rooted unwillingness and the arrogance once belonging to noble bloodlines made them overlook certain advantages of Austin, while amplifying his flaws.\n\"Fine, if you won't submit, then die!\"\nLike Divine judgment descending from the sky, filled with the Heavenly Dao decree that humans could not resist.\nThe words fell,\nand from the deep hole in the sky, an enormous dragon claw suddenly stretched out.\nIn an instant, heaven and earth trembled, the sky changed colors, ink clouds surged.\nBoom!!!\nFlashes of lightning shattered the sky, an invisible and shapeless overwhelming aura swept in all directions, making the entire firmament feel crushed by an invisible force, rolling and falling toward all beings within the Secret Realm Space!\nAfter Austin awakened his fourth Talent Magic, he devoted himself to research, not long afterwards he analyzed and comprehended from the Super Storm, gaining control over Wind and Water Attribute Powers.\nStorms, lightning, rain, these are the domains Blue Dragons naturally have authority over!\nWith the fourth Talent Magic as the core, Austin, who mastered Wind Attribute Power, was at this moment displaying it to the extreme!\n\"One Claw Covers the Sky!\"\nAs the dragon claw fell from the sky like a meteor, the surrounding void was already influenced by Austin's enormous might.\nStrong gales were condensing in the sky, kicking up turbulent winds that swept the world, stirring the heavy clouds around, turning into a massive black vortex of clouds!\nAt that moment, every elf gazing at the sky seemed to be intimidated by the spectacle before them.\nCyclones of fierce winds swept

doomsday was arriving!\n\"Can this really be resisted?\"\nElves within the Kingdom's Secret Realm Space stared blankly at the edge of the sky, one elf's knees buckled, half-kneeling on the ground,

overwhelming claw was about to descend,\n\"Alas.\"\nIn a daze, it seemed all the elves within the Elf Kingdom heard a faint sigh.\nThen,\nRustle...\nThe massive canopy that covered the entire Elf Kingdom, reaching thousands or tens of thousands of meters tall, the Mother Tree moved.\nThick leaves swayed like waves of a green sea, rustling, then tens of thousands of branches unfurled in the air, growing and extending.\nThick tree trunks entwined like living creatures in the air, twining into an enormous wooden tornado that reached the sky, moving to swallow the claw falling from above.\nThe powerful momentum was such that even the ferocious winds and clouds were torn apart by the immense wooden tornado!\nFinally, fiercely colliding with the colossal dragon claw that seemed to overturn the entire sky!\nClang!!!\nThe crisp sound of metal striking reverberated through every corner of the world, like thousands or tens of thousands of tons of steel colliding under the immense forces, squeezing out a creaking screech.\nAt the same time, a visible shockwave at the point of collision in the sky spread out in all directions, causing the entire space to tremble violently like a mirror, as if about to shatter.\nThe terrifying shockwave swept through, instantly triggering a roaring tsunami hurricane within heaven and earth.\nTrees were uprooted, smoke and dust filled the air, sand and stones flew, accompanied by lightning and thunder, plunging the scene into an apocalyptic abyss!\nCrack, crack....\nLarge areas of trees shattered and fell from the sky, the towering wooden tornado continuously growing, continuously crushed by immense forces, the falling wood chips like an overwhelming snowstorm, seemingly about to cover the whole land.\nFortunately, not long after, the winds and clouds calmed slightly, and everything finally ended.\nThe dragon claw that seemed to crush the entire space finally exhausted its strength, suspended in mid-air, ultimately unable to continue descending.\nHaving lost the overwhelming aura of power, the massive dragon claw that was enlarged like a massive lens finally revealed its original size, suspended in the sky.\nFrom the ground looking up, that world-flipping dragon claw appeared to be only the size of a fist.\nHowever, the elves who witnessed all of this on the scene did not feel a sense of survival from the brink of death, instead were silent.\nJust a fist-sized dragon claw had almost crushed and destroyed the entire Secret Realm Space.\nThis claw was blocked, but what about the next attack?",

If not for the continuous regrowth of the giant wood tornado, it might have been shattered in an instant by the vast cloud-empowered claw.\nNonetheless, after enduring Austin's attack, the giant wood tornado was already riddled with scars.\n\"Fairy Mother Tree.\"\nAustin's gaze from the sky pierced through layers of space, landing on the enormous tree that supported half the kingdom's secret realm, standing unknown thousands of meters high.\nIn these three days, the Dragon Nest Tribe hadn't been idle either.\nDetailed information about the Elf Kingdom had already been extracted from some captives.\nTo the elf race, the Mother Tree was incredibly important, one could even say it's the foundation of their strength.\nAfter mating, male and female elves place the newborn elf under the Mother Tree, where the lantern-like large flowers would envelop the elf infants for nurturing.\nUntil one or two years later, when the flowers reopen, the elf infants would possess innate supernatural abilities.\nElves aren't born with extraordinary abilities, but through this process, elves can awaken the extraordinary seed, becoming extraordinary beings.\nIf an elf tribe lacks the Fairy Mother Tree, they can't produce enough spellcasters and warriors at all.\nEven though elves have decent potential, with a higher self-awakening rate and a better chance of cultivating into extraordinary beings than ordinary beastmen, a tribe without a Mother Tree would inevitably degenerate into wild elves, at the lowest tier like the beastmen.\nBesides being a powerful backing for the elf race, the Fairy Mother Tree also has another crucial ability.\nIt supports a secret realm space.\nThrough the secret realm space supported by the Fairy Mother Tree, elves can live peacefully outside the perilous wild forests.\n\"A sigh, is this a wise Mother Tree? Indeed, a remnant of the former royal family.\"\nGenerally, Fairy Mother Trees are not sentient and do not react to external attacks.\nBut this Fairy Mother Tree before them was evidently different.\nBefore the giant wood tornado spiraled up, Austin sensed a faint sigh.\nAll the elves sensed it too.\nThis Fairy Mother Tree likely has consciousness.\nIt's no wonder, as a remnant of the once ruling elf royal family over the entire Kawa Great Forest, a Fairy Mother Tree possessing unusual wisdom isn't surprising.\nAnd this made Austin all the more eager to make this elf kingdom submit.\n\"Impressive power, but, as a tree, how could you perfectly harness your own strength.\"\nIf they refuse to surrender, then force them into submission.\nWhoosh!\nSuddenly, the sky darkened once more, and the surrounding void twisted under an invisible force, transforming into three swirling vortices around Austin, pulling in massive amounts of magic power and condensing into spheres.\nRasengan!\nA long time ago, Austin's domain prototype had already covered the entire sky, turning vast spaces into his home turf.\nIn this home turf, magic power easily condensed, forming three enormous Rasengan like a round sun.\nBut it wasn't over yet!\nBuzz!\nSuddenly, the void fluctuated again.\nFrom the Rasengan floating in the sky, each emitted a bright light, rapidly spreading and expanding, eventually becoming three gigantic Rasengan radiating blue, white, and translucent light.\nThis is the result of Rasengan's attribute change!\nThree attribute-changing Rasengan of thunder, wind, and water now hung high in the sky, their terrifying power distorting the air.\nSince awakening a trace of the Thunder Law in his blood and nurturing it within his Thunderbolt Divine Sword, through comprehending that trace of the Law of Thunder, Austin's power rapidly advanced.\nPreviously, it took at least half a minute to halt and condense the Rasengan for attribute changes.\nNow, within the domain prototype constructed with strong magical control, he could condense them instantly with a thought.\n\"Let's try this.\"\nWhoosh!\nThe three attribute-changing Rasengan plummeted from the sky, trailing fierce cyclones, twisting the space they passed through.\nTheir trajectory seemed disturbed by invisible forces, as the three different attribute Rasengan fell with chaotic motion, their light covering half the sky.\nThe immense pressure gave an overwhelming feeling of inescapability.\n\"Your Majesty, hurry to prepare the Sacred Artifact!\"\nThe elf elders, upon seeing the three energy spheres with terrifying pressure falling from the sky, turned pale with fear.\nAnd at this moment,\nWhoosh!!!\nThe Fairy Mother Tree moved again, as the giant wood tornado suddenly dispersed, with branch after branch intertwining in the air, gradually forming into a gigantic wooden shield, shielding the Elf Kingdom below.\nThe patterns formed by the interwoven branches were visible to the naked eye, exuding an orderly, harmonious beauty, supporting the sky as the giant shield extended continuously.\nBoom!\nFinally, at one moment, the three attribute-changing Rasengan, affected by mutual influence, unpredictably and forcefully slammed into the wooden shield.\nComposed of intertwining steely branches, the sky-shielding wooden shield, tens of meters deep, boasted a defense even stronger than the previous giant wood tornado.\nHowever, this time, the Fairy Mother Tree's wooden shield didn't create another miracle.\nThe instant the collision happened, the three attribute-changing Rasengan expanded violently, their size growing tens to hundreds of times instantly!\nThe tens of meters deep wooden shield, formed by layer upon layer of steely branches, was torn apart in the blink of an eye, pierced by the three enormous energy light spheres, raining countless wood fragments down like snow!\nThe thick wooden shield couldn't even withstand for a moment,\npassing through like soft tofu, penetrated instantly!\nSeeing the impending collision of the three massive Rasengan with the ground, their explosive power poised to destroy the majority of the Elf Kingdom,\nat that instant, a wisp of breeze arose from the void, like a ripple across a calm lake.\nIn a blink, it expanded into a colossal wind wall, spanning the sky ahead, blocking the falling Rasengan!\n\"Oh?\"\nOutside the vast hole in the sky, Austin's eyebrow raised.\nHe sensed it,\nthat breath belonging to the Law.\nThe Law of Wind!",

      "content": "\"The Sacred Artifact of the Race...\"\nIn the vast opening above the Elf Kingdom, Austin's gaze penetrated through layers of light and landed on the intricately carved green longbow, glowing with a green light, that the Elf Queen held aloft.\nAustin had also heard the words of that Elf Elder just now.\nThis was the sacred artifact of the Elven race, a longbow containing the Law of Wind.\nAustin sensed that the Law of Wind within the longbow was summoning the surrounding power of the wind attribute elements, transforming into an immense wind wall to block ahead.\nIn one of the famous games from Austin's past life, the wind wall of the Gale Sword Master Yasuo could block the attacks of the enemy projectiles.\nThis was the power of the wind, the defense of the wind.\nAnd now, the wind wall summoned by the Law of Wind contained within that longbow before him, its power could only be even greater.\nThis is the power at the level of law, a layer of power beyond the previous!\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\nThree enormous Attribute Rasengans ferociously crashed into the wind wall, and three rounds of dazzling spheres of light instantly expanded and exploded, erupting with earth-shattering power.\nA hundred bolts, a thousand bursts of lightning bloomed instantly in that short moment. The crackling light seemed to tear through the space and the blinding brilliance illuminated the entire sky. With it, razor-sharp whirlwinds sliced and expanded in the vacuum, mixed with the lightning,\nAt the same time, on the other side, the Water Attribute Rasengan, gathered to the extreme, swept out.\nThe power of water, in the Water Attribute Rasengan, with a water flow spinning at an immeasurable speed, had the power to pulverize any steel in an instant.\nThe eruption of three terrifying forces merged above the sky, electric light, storm, waterfall interconnected, as if presenting a splendid scene of world-destroying devastation!\nAnyone witnessing the tremendous power unleashed by the collision of those turbulent, raging three fearsome attribute forces in the sky would undoubtedly be deeply shocked and terrified by the overwhelming might sweeping over the world.\nIf that unleashed power were to crash onto the earth, even with the protection of the Mother Tree, the entire core area of the kingdom might be utterly destroyed in an instant amidst the ripping of those three terrifying forces.\nYet, despite such a powerful collision of forces, before that wall of wind, it had no effect whatsoever.\nThat wall of wind, like an indestructible barrier, blocked all the power unleashed by the Rasengan outside.\nDespite the rampant, towering tsunami and flood created by the uncontrolled eruption of wind, water, and thunder, before that barrier of wind, it still could not make any headway.\n\"Indeed it is the power of a sliver of the Law of Wind, as expected of the former royal family, even in decline, their heritage is astonishing.\"\nIf there was still doubt before, now it could be certain beyond any doubt.\nThis is the gap in power levels, fundamentally unable to contend.\nJust like the hardness between diamond and charcoal, despite the similarity in elemental composition, this is the difference at the essential level.\nPerhaps only such a tremendously powerful kingdom that once ruled the entire Kawa Great Forest could create such weapons containing law.\nIn the absence of the legendary, few could contend with these remnants of the Elf Kingdom.\nThis is heritage.\nDespite learning from Elf captives that during the orc rebellion of the past, war came too suddenly and resistance collapsed too quickly, their ancestors escaped in panic without taking more belongings.\nBut just the Elf Mother Tree and this longbow containing the Law of Wind alone allowed Austin to feel the strength of that Elf Kingdom of old.\n\"The power of law is a terribly troublesome thing for most non-legendary beings... too bad, I'm not one of them.\"\nThe force of three Attribute Rasengans at the Gold Level was already immensely powerful.\nAn ordinary gold facing just one would likely be reduced to ashes in the face of such overwhelming power.\nIf such a powerful attack was blocked, let alone other Gold Level attacks?\nFor the power of law, unless qualitative change is brought by quantitative change, non-law cannot contend with law.\nAlthough Austin was still at the Gold Level, he had already mastered a sliver of the power of the Thunder Law, placing him at the same level of power as that longbow sacred artifact of the Elf Kingdom.\nWith the remnants of this Elf Kingdom before him, Austin had long been resolved to take them, even if it meant revealing some things.\n\"Having nurtured for two or three months, let's test your power!\"\nUsing the Sword Drawing Technique as a foundation, sealing the Thunderbolt Divine Sword containing a sliver of the Law of Thunder within himself, constantly accumulating and nurturing it with magic power, dragon's power, and aura as resources.\nNow, the Thunderbolt Divine Sword within had been nurtured for over two months.\nIts might was revealed just slightly half a month ago, and the mere aura completely intimidated Lambert and other Blood Claw elites.\nHe was unsure to what extent the true power of the Thunderbolt Divine Sword had reached.\nNow was the best time to test its power!\nOnly law can counter law!\nWithin the secret realm of the Elf Kingdom, seeing the Queen wield the racial sacred artifact to summon the wind wall, blocking Austin's three massive Attribute Rasengans, all elves felt genuine internal relief, many bowing their heads with hands crossed, praying words like \"Nature bless us\".\n\"Phew, we're safe. With the sacred artifact, even if that dragon is strong, as long as it's not legendary, it can't do anything to us.\"\n\"Damn Wild Blue Dragon, dared to break the secret realm space, invade the kingdom, and injure the Mother Tree, almost destroying the entire kingdom. We can't forget this grudge!\"\n\"Yes, we must teach that damn wild dragon a harsh lesson!\"\nSeeing that safety was assured under the protection of the sacred artifact, everyone was filled with righteous indignation, with curses filling the air.\nThe Elf Queen's face paled slightly, hearing the words of the elders around, her brows furrowed.\nUsing the sacred artifact wasn't without cost. Just the brief moment conjuring the wind wall earlier had drained a third of her magic power.\nNow, she could only use it two more times at most.\nAs if seeing the Queen's hesitation, an Elder spoke up:\n\"The noble royal bloodline will never surrender to a wild dragon or a bunch of wild beastmen! Besides, Your Majesty, didn't that wild dragon's attack fail to breach the sacred artifact's defense just now? The sacred artifact itself is the main offensive tool. As long as you injure that wild dragon, the kingdom's crisis will naturally be resolved!\"\n\"That's right, Your Majesty, take action! Using the sacred artifact to slay the dragon is not impossible!\"\nHearing this, the Elf Queen was about to respond.\nHowever, at this moment,\nSuddenly, the entire sky seemed to collapse under a vast, boundless pressure!\nAt that moment, within the entire Elf Kingdom, all elves felt an inescapable despair, as if plunging straight into a dark abyss, where even their souls were devoured by darkness!",

      "content": "At the moment when that Thunderbolt Divine Sword appeared before heaven and earth, the vast momentum and dragon power that had been suppressed for over two months erupted with a roar, the void twisting and rippling, even affecting the celestial phenomena.\nThis was the result of Austin's presence as a Giant Dragon and the nurturance of dragon power, like a volcano suppressed for thousands of years. When a crack appeared in the seal of the earth's surface, it immediately led to the explosive momentum that had been suppressed for months, sweeping through heaven and earth like a tsunami.\nSwish!\nIn the clear splashing sound, electric light surrounded the sky.\nThat brilliant divine sword, as if a thousand blades and ten thousand thunders issued from beyond the heavens, suddenly appeared high in the sky.\nUnknowingly, thick black clouds gathered around, the fierce wind surging around, thunder and lightning leaping and bursting all around.\nWhen that strand of Law appeared in the void, it immediately resonated with the Law Power between heaven and earth. In vast areas of space, the Thunder Attribute Elements became volatile and active, as if a gigantic blazing meteor had fallen into the ocean that belonged to thunder, stirring up monstrous waves.\n\"Law! Law!\"\nWhen that incomparably brilliant Thunderbolt Divine Sword appeared in the sky above, all the Elves, including the Elf Queen, widened their eyes in astonishment.\nThat is the power of Law!\nOnly the power of Law can stir such vast waves and turmoil between heaven and earth!\nCan the Sacred Artifact really withstand such power?\nAt this moment, a doubtful thought inevitably rose in the Elf Queen's mind.\nBut she had no way out.\nWhen Austin summoned that Thunderbolt Divine Sword, there was no retreat for them. One side must completely fail to end this war.\nWith steadfast light in her eyes once again, the Elf Queen raised the Holy Artifact Longbow high, the radiant green light making the entire longbow float in the air, as the Elf Queen brought her hands together in front of her, half-kneeling on the ground.\nThe surrounding Elf Elders also knelt down, bowed their heads, and it seemed as if they were conducting some grand ceremony.\nIn the clear voice, filled with devout prayers slowly emerging:\n\"Spirit of wind in nature, please respond to the call of your people...\"\nAccompanying the Elf Queen's prayers, dazzling light burst forth from the suspended Holy Artifact Longbow, the light covering the sky.\nInvisible waves spread and diffused along the space, and the wind in the entire kingdom moved, as if summoned by the Wolf King, gathering towards the direction of the Holy Artifact Longbow.\nOne, two, three...\nSmall, weak, strong, fierce...\nLike thousands of rivers converging, streams of wind power vortices merged in the air, turning into a stronger storm, swirling around the Elf Mother Tree, like an immense wind-formed bell turned upside down, enveloping the Elf Mother Tree within.\nThe wind power condensed into substance, and with the continuous convergence of wind elements from all directions, it became increasingly solid, as if even space was influenced by the wind attribute power, forming an invincible giant wind bell defense!\nThis was the first time in a thousand years that the Elf Sacred Artifact fully unleashed its ability, the miraculous spectacle like a substance covering half of the sky \"dome\" made every protected Elf below feel an indescribable shock.\nBut it's not over yet!\nThe green light of the Holy Artifact Longbow continued to bloom, and although the storm bell it mobilized had strong defense, they were now facing another Giant Dragon who mastered the Law!\n\"Ancestors of nature, please grant me the power to repel the foreign enemies!\"\nWith the devout prayer, the Elf Queen regrasped the Holy Artifact Longbow.\nGazing at the sky, drawing the bow and nocking an arrow,\nThe green light shone, pointing to Austin beyond the sky.\nThe Magic Power surged from within, condensing into a green arrow on the bow, the flickering emerald light swirling with halos, vaguely tearing the air apart.\nThis is an arrow purely condensed from the magic power within the Elf Queen, with a wisp of Law of Wind attached, granting the arrow extraordinary destructive power.\nThis is the holy artifact remaining in the Elf Kingdom, a longbow forged with the Law of Wind.\nIt doesn't need specially made arrows, even the most ordinary bamboo arrow, when attached with a trace of Law of Wind, would possess invincible power, capable of striking down all!\nIf the enormous wind bell covering the sky and enveloping the Elf Mother Tree and much of the Elf Kingdom was the defensive capability of the Holy Artifact Longbow, then granting the arrow invincible power was the strongest attack of the Holy Artifact Longbow!\nShe is both the strongest shield and the strongest spear!\n\"If it's just the breath of Law, it cannot withstand the attack of the Thunderbolt Divine Sword!\"\nLooking through layers of void, seeing everything in his eyes, Austin murmured softly.\nHe did not hold back,\nA Thunderbolt Divine Sword, nurtured for more than two months, containing the power of the Law of Thunder, its destructive capacity was unknown.\n\"Go!\"\nWith Austin's command,\nThe Thunderbolt Divine Sword, filled with strands of loose electric light, dense like a cobweb spanning the central sky, suddenly fell with space-shattering power, crashing down!\nWith lightning as its edge, forged by thunder, the sword momentum containing the Law fell,\nInstantly, the momentum was overwhelming like celestial might, swallowing the power of the sun and moon.\nThat stroke, seemingly coming from beyond, plummeting down, traversed layers of space, at that moment becoming the center of heaven and earth, absorbing all the brilliance of the world.\n\"Nature, please grant me strength!\"\nAt the same moment, a wisp of Law of Wind, through some mysterious connection, along with the rich breath of Law, infused into that shimmering green arrow.\nLoosening the grip, the arrow shot out,\nThat arrow, like a meteor breaking through the sky, soared against the tide!\nThe verdant arrow let out a verdant cry, like a living being breaking out from the darkness, that green representing the vitality of all things, spreading over the entire sky, filling every corner of the void.\nA long green tail flame, waving in the wind behind that meteor-like arrow, as it pierced through layers of void, was the trace of wind element tumult in the void!\nIn a blink,\nGreen and blue, two dazzling streaks of light traversed the space, instantly colliding with each other.\nPoint to point.\nThe entire world was divided into two distinct colors, clearly separated.\nThis is a confrontation between Laws, a clash of legendary powers above all creatures!\nAt that moment,\nWind and Thunder, two kinds of Laws,\nClashed with boundless power!",

      "content": "Boom!!!\nTwo streams of light collided fiercely in the sky, immediately causing a world-shaking explosion.\nThe powerful energy collision caused the surrounding void to surge like a tide. Just the clash of auras alone incited the heaven and earth's energy field to rage like a tidal wave, sweeping through the entire Secret Realm Space, making the world seem to tremble unceasingly.\nThe space trembled like a mirrored surface, as if the entire Secret Realm Space was about to shatter and break apart.\nA horrific energy storm swept across the sky and earth, turning the whole world into a sea of light; the wild winds and raging thunder shook the heavens and earth as if threatening to break the entire world apart to start anew.\nBut this was merely the surface!\nOutside the Secret Realm Space, Austin, having awakened a trace of the Thunder Law, was fortunate to witness the even more splendid collision of deeper-level laws hidden within the fierce energy explosion!\nAt the moment the vast energy exploded, the Law of Wind on the arrow finally collided with the Law of Thunder within the Thunderbolt Divine Sword.\nThis resulted in a dazzling change hidden within the blinding energy explosion, indescribable in words.\nThe instant the two strands of laws intersected, the surrounding space was instantly repelled, forming a vacuum area of chaotic laws.\nThat vacuum area was only the size of a fist, hidden within the vast energy shockwave, and vanished as quickly as it appeared, following the annihilation of the laws.\nAustin saw it,\nThrough the perception of the Thunder Law within his body, he clearly saw the process of that vacuum area forming and being destroyed in that instant.\nThe moment the two strands of laws converged, they immediately affected the surrounding void,\nThe surrounding space seemed like a membrane made up of countless vibrating arcs, repelled by the invisible force created by the collision of the Law of Wind and the Law of Thunder, forming a spatial bubble.\nAll material elemental forces were repelled, as if a vacuum bubble was forcibly born from the void.\nAt the same time, the two strands of laws collided like high-speed particles, instantly decomposing into countless arcs shooting skyward, resembling both colorless fireworks and countless lines decomposing and bouncing in all directions.\nThose arcs clashed with each other, annihilated and merged into the surrounding void, triggering a more extensive riot of wind and thunder elements in the external space!\nThis was a collision belonging to a higher level of power,\nOnly those who truly understood the laws and entered the Legendary Domain could discover and comprehend the origin of power!\nThough it was just a fleeting bloom, that incredibly splendid collision of laws was still deeply imprinted in Austin's eyes.\nUnable to comprehend its manifestation or gain a greater harvest from it,\nBut having witnessed that moment of brilliance was enough to genuinely shock any being who hadn't yet stepped into legendary territory.\n\"This is the law...\"\nAustin murmured softly.\nAnd at this moment, the clash between the arrow and the sword finally reached its climax.\nThe Thunderbolt Divine Sword, nurtured for more than two months, and condensed with the momentum of a dragon for tens of days, ultimately ascended a higher tier.\nAs traces of law aura were exhausted, the green arrows collapsed layer by layer, shattered by the Thunderbolt Divine Sword breaking through from the center.\nThe longsword's Sword God dimmed as well, with most of its power of laws consumed, but still carrying immense power like a meteor falling towards the massive Wind Bell!\nRipppp!\nWith the sound like the tearing of fabric, the massive Wind Bell, as if substantive, was torn open and crumbled.\nThe Thunderbolt Divine Sword descended unstoppably with electric arcs, tearing the space apart.\nNeither the Elf Queen nor the many elf elders standing behind her reacted,\nthe Sacred Artifact Longbow in the Elf Queen's hands was sliced in two by the Thunderbolt Divine Sword falling from the heavens.\nThe Sacred Artifact was destroyed!\nIt couldn't withstand Austin's Thunderbolt Divine Sword's attack.\nThe result was both unexpected and inevitable.\nThat brilliant Thunderbolt Divine Sword was the splendor that Austin had spent more than two months nurturing, gathering power for tens of days only to bloom in an instant!\nPursuing a moment of radiance far beyond what a longbow weapon, merely placed on an altar for incense offerings, could compare to.\nAt the same time,\nCrack, crack...\nIn the crisp sound of shattering, the brilliant blade of the Thunderbolt Divine Sword formed cracks.\nFinally, having exhausted all its power, it shattered into countless fragments like glass, dissipating into nothingness in mid-air.\nThe longsword that Austin had invested substantial time and effort in nurturing, ultimately fulfilled its mission.\nCompletely breaking the Elf Kingdom's last resistance, along with the destruction of the Sacred Artifact, it wasn't in vain for Austin to have invested so much effort in it.\nAfter all, it was a longsword transformed from the changing nature of thunder, which could be nurtured and cultivated again.\nBut the Elf Kingdom's Sacred Artifact, once gone, was truly gone.\n\"The Sacred Artifact, destroyed?\"\nStaring at the Sacred Artifact Longbow broken in two, the Elf Queen's eyes were filled with bewilderment.\nAnd at this moment,\nA strand of Wind Law Origin wound out from the broken longbow, slowly rising, drifting into the void as if entering the sea, ready to merge into the endless void.\n\"Wind Law Origin!\"\nStaring at the Wind Law Origin rising from the shattered longbow like smoke entering the heavens, about to merge into the Cyan Nether void, Austin's eyes gleamed with extreme eagerness.\nThe Law Origin is something capable of continuously gathering laws.\nAustin had awakened a trace of Thunder Law Origin within his bloodline, thereby gaining the ability to control and use laws.\nThe relationship between Law Origin and laws is like that of a spring and the stream formed by spring water.\nHowever, the endless spring water can gather into a lake, constantly accumulating at low points.\nBut laws can never gather like spring water; the more Thunder Origin Laws you comprehend, the more Thunder Laws you can use.\nJust like the Thunderbolt Divine Sword nurtured by Austin, he could only condense a sword containing a trace of Thunder Law, unable to use more Thunder Laws to condense more Thunderbolt Divine Swords.\nThis is due to the connection dictated by the world's rules between Law Origin and laws, understanding only as much law origin as the amount of laws one can use.\n\"If I could obtain this trace of Wind Law Origin, then not only could I comprehend the power of the Wind Law, but I could also, like the Thunder Law, integrate the power of the Wind Law into my battle system, gaining a greater enhancement!\"\nWithout much thought, Austin flew out directly, rapidly heading towards the Wind Law Origin about to merge into the Cyan Nether sky.\nBut, the way for Austin to seize this trace of Wind Law Origin!\nWas like a greedy cat eyeing the fish in the water jar,\nLonging yet out of reach.\nWhat to do?\nSeeing the Wind Law Origin about to merge into the void before his eyes, Austin was anxious.\nFinally, at the moment it was about to dissipate,\nAustin opened his ferocious mouth, swallowing the Wind Law Origin before him along with the air.\nRegardless of whether it would work, or what the effects might be,\nhe gulped it down first!",

      "content": "Swallowing that strand of the Law of Wind was just an instinctive reaction from Austin, having no method or means in his haste; he didn't even know what kind of consequences this would lead to.\nBoom!!!\nAs the strand of the Law of Wind was swallowed into his stomach, tumultuous waves were instantly stirred up within Austin's body.\nThe Magic Power surged violently like tsunami tides under the urging of the Wind Law Origin, a level of power that was entirely beyond his current ability to control.\nAll around Austin, fierce and intense gales erupted from the void, transforming into tangible torrents, violently surging amidst the gloomy heavens between layers of heavy clouds, lightning ripping through the sky.\nThe doomsday-like scene instilled a terror from the depths of the hearts of all living beings present.\n\"My subjects, attack, crush them!\"\nAustin forcibly suppressed the rampaging wind attribute elements within his body, his deep voice rolling through the sky.\nThe Dragon Nest Beastmen army, long waiting outside, with Austin's command, poured forth immediately like a flood unleashed, like an iron flood gushing out from the breach.\nAlong the gap emerging in the collapsing Secret Realm Space, the Dragon Nest Beastmen army formally entered this utopian land.\nMeanwhile,\nSeeing from high above, the Dragon Nest Beastmen army sweeping within the Elf Kingdom, dismantling any resistance with ease, Austin didn't linger, using the last of his strength to soar up and quickly fly towards the direction of the Dragon Nest Tribe headquarters.\nThat strand of Wind Origin Law violently stirred within, causing drastic changes in the world outside.\nWherever Austin passed, terrifying cyclones were stirred up by the agitated Wind Law Origin, the sky covered with oppressive dark clouds, and vast forests toppled and blown away in the fierce gales, leaves and branches swept high into the air as if an apocalyptic calamity had arrived.\n\"I must return quickly!\"\nFeeling the incredibly agitated Wind Law Origin within his body, Austin was anxious at heart.\nHe had to find a safe place to properly handle that strand of Law Origin within him, otherwise, its continued rampage would lead even the body of a giant dragon to a great collapse.\nThe area within a hundred miles had already become the domain of the Clan Tribe under Austin's command,\nbut the safest place, without doubt, was the old nest.\nHowever, given his current state of causing disaster at any moment and place, returning to the Dragon Nest headquarters was naturally impossible.\nFortunately, when he developed his Rasengan and understood the Thunder Law, Austin had been cultivating in a mountain range near the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThis area had long been cleared out by the Dragon Nest Beastmen into a large, safe zone, becoming the place for Austin's daily cultivation activities.\nThis was constructed and maintained under Austin's orders.\nIn the mountains, there was a small mound, where an old enemy of Austin's was buried years before.\nThe Blood Wolf Leader.\nDuring the initial two years of his infant stage, lacking in Magic Power growth, Austin had been unable to fight against the Blood Wolves as Magic Beasts, resulting in several hunts being interfered with and almost losing his life to their claws.\nLater, swallowing his pride and bearing the burden of humiliation, Austin finally killed the Blood Wolf Leader with the help of the Kobolds, eradicating the Blood Wolves,\nright in this mountain range.\nLater, to commemorate his first major enemy in his dragon life, Austin had the Beastmen bury some of the Blood Wolf Leader's indestructible bones here, erecting a small mound within the canyon where the Blood Wolf Leader fell.\nFor remembrance.\nAs for why Austin unconsciously lingered here when developing Rasengan, cultivating the Thunderbolt Divine Sword, and understanding the Thunder Law, he didn't know.\nAnyway, it certainly wasn't to dance on the grave of an old enemy.\nA mere small wild wolf, for him now, could be crushed with a flick.\nHa, does he, Austin, look like a dragon so petty and vengeful?\n...\nWithin the mountains, the dragon's aura generated during closed-door cultivation made surrounding beasts dare not approach, and being not too close nor too far from the Dragon Nest Tribe, it was the most suitable place to handle the Wind Law Origin.\nBefore long, Austin, riding the wind, returned to the mountains.\nThe Dragon Nest Beastmen guarding the periphery saluted as Austin descended with great momentum, and began quickly retreating to the more distant outer areas.\nClatter!\nAustin landed atop a mountain's cliff, the Wind Law Origin inside his body already agitated to the extreme, as if to break forth from within his body.\nThe phenomena surrounding the mountains were influenced, forming huge and immense tornadoes, the entire mountain range shrouded under a cloud stretching across half the sky.\nThe light in that area dimmed, as if expelled from the world.\nGood, it's safe.\nYet as over two months of cold winter passed, the previously half-destroyed mountains in various attempts had regrown with vegetation, lush plants covering the once-exposed hollows in the soil.\nAt the base of the cliff, where the Blood Wolf Leader had fallen, the lush grasses atop its mound swayed in the wind, growing vigorously.\nRetracting his \"unconscious\" gaze, Austin's heart and spirit focused inward within his body.\nThat agitated strand of Wind Law Origin rampaged inside, damaging and leaving Austin with scars over his entire body, blood oozing from between the scales.\nHow to handle this?\nSwallowing it in without much thought, only now realizing it was a major problem.\nAustin's brows furrowed deep,\nhe was not yet a Legendary. The Law Origin was a higher level of incomprehensible power to him; if he could grasp it, Austin's strength would naturally greatly enhance.\nBut similarly, failing to resolve it would bring great trouble to Austin, even with his dragon bloodline.\nThink quickly, what method should be used!\nIn his past life's memories, visions of countless fantasy martial arts animations and various fantastical thoughts flashed, seeking similar solutions.\nHowever, Austin failed.\nNone of those novels or animations he had seen ever encountered such a situation.\n\"Only by borrowing like the Thunderbolt Divine Sword intricately borrowed the principle of the Sword Drawing Technique.\"\nShifting his thought process, Austin began to ponder.\nThe turbulent Wind Law Origin within his body continued its rampage, seemingly ceaselessly damaging Austin's body.\nInternal injuries intensified, Austin's breath growing ever fainter.\nFinally,\nat a certain moment, gazing down at the mound, crowned with weeds swaying in the wind, Austin's heavy eyes brightened.\nThe old enemy, along with its flesh, became nourishment for his growth.\nThe Magic Beast Crystal Core within the Blood Wolf Leader's head, along with flesh, all of which initially hadn't belonged to him, but through devouring and digesting, became his own.\nThen how could this strand of Wind Law Origin be devoured and digested to become his own?\nLost deep in thought, Austin's mind flashed with such a question.\nLike the Spiritual Artifact or Magical Treasure in fantasy and xianxia novels, transforming an enemy's into something controllable through refining with one's heart spirit.\nPerhaps,\nhe could treat that strand of Wind Law Origin as a Magical Treasure, refining it through heart spirit, thereby completely digesting it, gaining control over that strand of Wind Law Origin!",

      "content": "Having thought it through, Austin sank into a trance, attempting to use Heart and Soul Refinement to control that wisp of the Law of Wind within his body.\nHis spirit descended deep into his body, where everything inside was reflected in his mind: blood vessels, internal organs, bones... But most importantly, it was that strand of turbulent and clashing Wind Law Origin buried deep within.\nThe moment his spiritual power touched that Wind Law Origin, he felt a kind of agitation and turbulence, filled with an incomprehensible force.\nThis force originated from the most fundamental power between heaven and earth, and just a single thread of it could cause the surrounding void's elemental power to riot collectively.\nHis spiritual power carefully wrapped around that Wind Law Origin within his body, then began to touch, soothe, and attempt to refine it...\nStep by step, bit by bit, he cautiously began to make contact and refine it.\nFortunately, before this, Austin had tried to refine the Thunderbolt Divine Sword. Although there wasn't a specialized refining technique like in fantasy immortal cultivation novels, through experiential exploration, Austin had acquired certain refining skills.\nUtilizing all his past experience and techniques, it wasn't long before that initially turbulent wisp of Wind Law Origin began to stabilize under the soothing influence of his spiritual power.\nThe crisis of his body exploding was finally resolved.\nHowever, this was far from over.\nThough the agitated Wind Law Origin had been calmed, there was still a significant distance from truly integrating and controlling it.\nAnd now, Austin discovered a big problem.\nTo maintain the stability of the Wind Law Origin, a large amount of spiritual power must be used to soothe that wisp. This required continuous infusions of spiritual power.\nIt couldn't be interrupted.\nThis was an utterly unacceptable result. If he had to continually provide spiritual power to maintain stability, Austin's overall combat power would be greatly diminished.\nSimple multitasking could sustain daily survival, but even in the simplest battles, it's impossible to fight while simultaneously supplying vast amounts of spiritual power to the Wind Law Origin within his body.\n\"This is like being adrift on water!\"\nAs he refined over time, Austin further understood the existence form of the Wind Law Origin.\nIncorporeal, immaterial, it wasn't a tangible substance, but more like a conceptual force.\nRefining a magical treasure with heart and soul still involved the treasure having a physical form.\nBut this wisp of Wind Law Origin? There was no physical form, so it couldn't be refined like actual material substances. That he could soothe it with spiritual power was already quite an achievement.\n\"This won't do. I must find a suitable vessel to stabilize it, and only then can I truly begin to comprehend and control it.\"\nA vessel to carry the law.\nIn an instant, Austin thought of the Thunderbolt Divine Sword.\nBy using the nature transformation of Thunder Attribute Elements, he condensed and compressed the Thunder Element into a tangible longsword, injecting the law within it to form a Thunderbolt Divine Sword imbued with law.\nDrawing a parallel to the Thunderbolt Divine Sword, Austin thought about the nature transformation of wind.\nHowever, no matter what, thunder elements have a tangible form that can be transformed into something solid through nature transformation.\nBut wind?\nIncorporeal, immaterial, how could its nature transformation be converted into a tangible object?\nWind Blade, Wind Wall... perhaps these concepts could be drawn upon to create another sword similar to the Thunder Law.\nHowever,\nAfter attempting dozens to hundreds of times and failing, Austin finally understood that given time, he might be able to rely on the Thunderbolt Divine Sword method to condense another sword imbued with the Law of Wind.\nBut it was fundamentally impossible for a sword composed of Wind Elements to serve as a vessel for the Wind Law Origin.\nA law is a law, and a law origin is a law origin.\nThe power of the Law Origin cannot be borne by mere elemental powers of the heavens and earth.\nThe attempts failed, and the path ahead seemed to be a dead end.\n\"Law Origin, Law Origin... the wisp of Thunder Law Origin within me originates from my bloodline. Perhaps my Giant Dragon Bloodline could serve as a vessel for the Wind Law Origin's power?\"\nBlue Dragon, the mythical master of thunder and storm.\nIt was said that even the mere release of their aura by an adult Blue Dragon could alter the very sky, bringing storms and thunder, and causing a deluge of rainfall.\nDoes this mean that the bloodline of a Blue Dragon contains the origin of wind, thunder, and water laws?\nA Giant Dragon's capabilities are linked to the Legendary Law hidden within their bloodline.\nAs they grow, the Legendary Law within them gradually uncovers, finally allowing them to naturally step into the Legendary Realm.\nThe descriptions of Blue Dragons are always entwined with storms, thunder, and torrential rain, perhaps the result of the Legendary Laws of wind, thunder, and water being released!\nIf this is true, then it suggests that Austin's own Giant Dragon Bloodline might indeed be able to bear the Wind Law Origin!\nRealizing this, Austin immediately began his attempts.\nEarlier, he had treated the Wind Law Origin as a magical treasure to refine, but now he proactively drew that wisp of Wind Law Origin into his bloodline.\nInhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.....\nAustin sat cross-legged atop the mountain peak, entirely focused on refining.\nOutside, a tempest of wind and rain battered the land, lightning flashed and thunder roared, yet his massive figure remained steadfast and unmoving.\n...\nMeanwhile, as Austin began attempting to use his bloodline to refine that wisp of Wind Law Origin, the war within the Elf Kingdom was already reaching its conclusion.\nAs vast armies of Dragon Nest Beastmen marched in synchronized unison like a flood of iron into this crumbling Secret Realm Space, an overwhelming aura of malevolence swept through every corner of the space.\nWhen a junior officer in the army executed a momentary step, vanishing while simultaneously unleashing a Fighting Qi Rasengan to obliterate a Silver-level Elf...\nOnce the true strength of the Dragon Nest Army was fully unveiled, as they formed martial arrays to slaughter with precision, the remaining Elves' resistance grew weaker and weaker, and their final lines of defense were overwhelmingly crushed.\nThe Elf Kingdom surrendered.\nThere was no way not to surrender. The Elf Mother Tree had suffered severe damage in previous attacks, the Holy Artifact Longbow was directly cut into two pieces, utterly destroyed, and along with the devastating defeat of the Elven Army three days ago, the entire Elf Kingdom had lost its capacity to resist.\nWith such an array of factors, when the Dragon Nest Beastmen Army effortlessly stormed to the foot of the Elf Mother Tree, the Elf Kingdom ultimately surrendered unconditionally to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThe war was over,\nand no one in the Elf Kingdom continued to resist. Even the Elf Elders standing beside the Elf Queen fell silent, saying nothing.\nEven the multitude of Elf civilians had nothing to say. The scene of Austin's earlier actions was too awe-inspiring and terrifying, reducing them all to quaking fear.\nAll that remained was a sense of confusion about their impending captive futures.",

      "content": "The powerful Dragon Nest Legion shattered the remaining resistance of the Elf Kingdom and completely occupied the entire Secret Realm Space of the kingdom.\nWith the surrender of the Elf Kingdom, the roadblock of the first stronghold expansion has also been completely removed, and no force in the surrounding area can resist the sweep of the Dragon Nest Legion anymore.\nThe future of the stronghold is bright.\nSoon, once the stronghold is successfully built, it can form a flanked position linked to the main base of the Dragon Nest Tribe through transportation, while relying on the stronghold to implement the tribe's policy of continuous outward expansion.\nWith the anticipation of a bright future, the Dragon Nest Beastmen began to enter the post-war cleanup work.\nInjury treatment, the reformation of the Beastman army, the completion of the camp... Many matters need to be arranged and completed one by one.\nOf course, after crushing the elf resistance, the biggest problem Vini and others faced was the handling of the numerous elves and the disposition of this Secret Realm Space.\nAustin entered a state of seclusion, so Vini and others found it hard to make decisions.\nThus, they decided to send people to occupy and station in this Secret Realm Space of the Elf Kingdom to monitor these elf prisoners.\nAt the same time, they chose to treat the elf groups differently.\nAll ordinary elves were classified as prisoners for either pioneering work or reconstruction and were all sent to work to contribute a portion of strength to the building of the Dragon Nest Tribe's stronghold.\nThe elves have the trait of being close to plants and also possess certain means to catalyze plants, which is very important for the pioneering and farming work of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nHowever, with Austin in seclusion, Vini and other high-ranking members of the Dragon Nest Tribe could only arrange for the unified training, transformation, and distribution of these numerous elves before speaking further.\nOnce these tens of thousands of elf prisoners had completed their disciplinary transformation under military training, Austin would decide, and then work tasks would be distributed to them.\nSimultaneously, the upper echelon of all the elf kingdom prisoners were placed under house arrest.\nApart from the vast labor resource, the upper echelon of the Elf Kingdom also holds a significant portion of value.\nAustin is interested in learning about the historical layout within the Kawa Great Forest a thousand years ago, certain information in the core area, and the conflicts and battles between elves and Beastmen.\nOnly by understanding more information can the direction become clear.\nThe mutated evil spirit, the destroyed Elf Royal Court, the core area Beastmen, and the undead wave that almost swept the entire Kawa Great Forest... Austin faintly sensed that there seemed to be a certain connection between them.\nPerhaps the escaping royal elves from the Kawa Great Forest's core area know some secret information from a thousand years ago.\nTherefore, the upper echelon of the elf kingdom was kept under house arrest in a specific area until Austin came out of seclusion to make a final judgment on them.\nThe development work of the stronghold proceeded in an orderly manner, especially after many elf prisoners were incorporated into the work, greatly accelerating the construction speed.\nUsing the initially established Stronghold City and the Elf Kingdom Secret Realm Space as the core, they continued to expand outward.\nThe Beastman army went out to sweep up one small tribe after another established nearby, simultaneously clearing away dangerous extraordinary creatures like Magic Beasts and Giant Beasts.\nThe production Beastmen, with the help of bronze tools, carried out extensive forest felling and land clearing, while elf prisoners were responsible for cultivating the cleared land.\nEverything was orderly.\nWith the largest obstacle, the Elf Kingdom, out of the way, the construction speed rapidly increased, and the actual control range of the stronghold continued to extend outward.\nIn the hot construction boom, it's believed that soon the area near the stronghold will become self-sufficient and become the second important base for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n...\nWhile the Dragon Nest Beastmen began large-scale development and construction at the first stronghold, Austin, who was in seclusion near the Dragon Nest Tribe's valley refining the Law of Wind, also made some progress.\n\"Finally succeeded!\"\nAustin let out a long breath from the clifftop, and the surrounding storm of thunder and lightning gradually dissipated.\nAs the thick clouds above gradually receded, the oppressive atmosphere also faded away.\nAfter days of continuous attempts, Austin finally used his Spiritual Power, with his bloodline as a carrier, to integrate a trace of Wind Law Origin within himself.\nAfter a thorough digestion and absorption,\njust like the previous awakening of the Thunder Law Origin, that trace of Wind Law Origin also became his own.\nFrom then on, Austin could also wield the power of the Law of Wind.\nGreatly increased power!\nJust as when he first awakened that trace of Thunder Law Origin, Austin's understanding of wind elements became more profound, and his ability to control wind attribute elements was rapidly improving.\nThis is the power of the Wind Law Origin, and it's precisely the reason Austin eagerly desired it, even at the cost of injury.\n\"Compared to the Thunder Law, the comprehension of the Wind Law is somewhat lacking, but the control of wind has genuinely improved significantly.\"\nFeeling his keen sensitivity to the surrounding wind elements, Austin secretly thought in his heart.\nInitially, after awakening a trace of Thunder Law Origin, Austin's control of thunder greatly increased, subsequently breaking through a certain bottleneck and successfully using the thunder attribute of Rasengan, becoming one of the most powerful Rasengan techniques Austin mastered.\nNow, after refining and integrating that trace of Wind Law Origin into himself, Austin's change of Rasengan to the wind attribute also received significant enhancement.\nRoughly estimated, if Austin were to use the wind attribute Rasengan again, its power could increase by at least 20%!\nMoreover, the benefits do not stop there!\n\"Using the concept of Wind Blade as a principle, I wonder if I can create a Wind Longsword similar to the Thunderbolt Divine Sword.\"\nThis idea resurfaced in his mind once more.\nIf he can succeed,\nwith both swords drawn, wielding the power of wind and thunder simultaneously, the resulting power would not be as simple as one plus one.\n\"No, although the Thunderbolt Divine Sword is powerful, it also has some issues that need improvement!\"\nIn the battle against the Kingdom's Holy Artifact of the Elf Kingdom, the Thunderbolt Divine Sword, nurtured for only two months, was powerful enough to even cut through a Holy Artifact infused with Wind Law Origin in a direct confrontation.\nThe power was very strong.\nHowever, the drawbacks were also apparent.\nAfter that one strike, the fragile Thunder Sword Body had already collapsed and dissipated.\nTo nurture such a sword again, it can only be reforged and reintegrated with the Thunder Law.\nThis drawback needs improvement!",

      "content": "The Sacred Artifact, capable of embodying the Wind Law Origin, is inherently extraordinary; it might once have been the weapon of a certain legendary figure from the Elf Kingdom.\nThe Thunderbolt Divine Sword, which Austin nurtured for over two months, could cleave it in one strike, which speaks volumes about its power.\nEven a legend, if not cautious, could risk severe injury or demise if pierced by that sword.\nAlthough the body of the Thunderbolt Divine Sword eventually shattered, its achievements were already remarkably impressive.\nThe nurtured state was still short in duration; had it been nurtured for another ten years or so, perhaps even the legendary would not dare to face its edge directly.\nHowever, there were still flaws.\nThe Thunderbolt Divine Sword, once unsheathed, does not return; it perishes with the enemy, an exchange of destruction.\nFlaws naturally need improvement.\nWith his ongoing exploration and reflection on nurturing the Thunderbolt Divine Sword, Austin gained a deeper understanding of this method and, combined with his previous experiences, had ideas on how to modify it.\n\"Formless from form, in the intangible form; perhaps, I need not be confined to the substantial mediums shaped by elemental attribute to forge the longsword.\"\nInspired by the Wind Sword that evolved from Wind Blade, Austin developed further ideas.\nPreviously, the Thunderbolt Divine Sword was based on the thunder attribute's Thunder Sword, then augmented by Thunder Law to enhance its power.\nNow, Austin sought to employ another concept.\nWith Law as the bone, and element as the flesh and blood.\nBy condensing the Power of Laws, shaping it with Spiritual Power into a longsword form, and coating it with elemental power, a new Thunderbolt Longsword would finally be crafted.\nThe Wind Sword follows this pattern as well, with the Law of Wind as its core.\nThus, the two swords reside between form and formlessness, also able to be nurtured internally.\n\"The Law Divine Sword no longer remains a tangible object but a conceptual entity, so whether it shatters after being unsheathed doesn't matter; it can be recreated with a mere thought.\"\nIf this idea could truly succeed, then in future battles, there would be no need to worry about the embodiment shattering after a moment of eruption.\n\"Let's begin, the evolved form of the Law Longsword.\"\nAustin closed his eyes, diving inward with his heart spirit, beginning his attempt.\nActually, he had already considered altering the existence form of the Law Longsword.\nThat Thunderbolt Divine Sword, nurtured for over two months, held incredible power; however, Austin sensed that its power had seemingly reached an upper limit.\nThe longsword formed through thunder attribute changes couldn't withstand power beyond its own level.\nNurturing it further might eventually lead to inevitable collapse.\nThus, the Thunderbolt Divine Sword had its limits, almost reaching them after being nurtured for more than two months.\nIn the mountains, Austin began his attempts repeatedly.\nOnce again, the sky was enveloped in thick clouds, filled with lightning and thunder, and this time, terrifying gale winds swept all around.\nThe mountain range remained undisturbed, allowing him to focus intently on the present task.\nShould these attempts succeed, it would mean Austin could simultaneously forge another sword containing the Law of Wind while improving the Thunderbolt Divine Sword.\nIf the Wind and Thunder Swords could be successfully forged, Austin's prowess would ascend to another level.\n...\nTime slowly passed.\nIn the blink of an eye, more than a month had elapsed.\nDuring Austin's retreat, the Dragon Nest Tribe had not halted its development.\nThe elf peasant captives were trained and transformed, integrated into the Dragon Nest Tribe's Beastman system, significantly enhancing the tribe's strength.\nWith abundant labor resources, the vast fields cultivated in the first encampment and the first crop of kudzu had yielded a substantial harvest.\nThe elves, adept with plants, indeed proved to be skilled hands at cultivation.\nCombining the Dragon Nest Tribe's years of farming experience with the elves' innate talents, the first kudzu harvest was bountiful.\nThe fields opened in the first encampment, coupled with the main base's nearby field harvests, provided enough grain to sustain the entire tribe for half a year.\nOver three months of the scorching summer had passed, leaving five to six months before the cold winter, allowing several more kudzu planting seasons.\nThis year, ample grain supply was undoubtedly assured.\nA bountiful harvest of grain remains the greatest joy for every sentient being surviving in the Kawa Great Forest.\nEven the Elf Kingdom houses many impoverished elf peasants.\nIn the face of looming threats, the Elf Kingdom dares not expand extensively, thus relying solely on existing territorial resources to support tens of thousands of elves; naturally, this does not yield wealth.\nWith this bountiful harvest, the transformed elves developed a sense of belonging to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nNow, even if the Elf Kingdom's upper echelons lift the confinement, rebellious elf elders won't garner much support.\nWith abundant grain, as part of Austin's expansion plan laid out in early spring, the Dragon Nest Beastman Legion set forth to sweep across the land.\nUsing the first encampment as the core, with numerous trained Blood Wolves leading the way, they began conquering one small tribe after another, escorting large numbers of beastman prisoners back to the encampment to bolster the Dragon Nest Tribe's beastman population.\nThe outbreak of sweeping warfare engulfed the area around the encampment in flames of conflict.\nMany beastman tribes fiercely resisted, yet under the overwhelming strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe, they crumbled like dry leaves against a strong wind.\nMore beastman tribes, witnessing the immense power of the Dragon Nest Legion, directly surrendered.\nIn a short time, the Dragon Nest Tribe's population swelled once more.\nIncluding the many elf inhabitants, the Dragon Nest Tribe's population skyrocketed to over eighty thousand in a short span!\nSeeing further expansion could lead to indigestion, the Dragon Nest Tribe temporarily halted its expansion, turning focus on absorbing its current strength.\nTransforming many captives into foundational strength was an extensive project, but fortunately, the Dragon Nest Tribe had long walked the path of external war expansion, thus possessing experience in all related processes.\nWith the Dragon Nest Tribe temporarily pausing its expansion, the surroundings of the encampment settled once again.\nYet, any smart beastman nearby knew this was merely a truce before the next round of warfare.\nFollowing this expansion, the territory within a thirty-kilometer radius around the first encampment, dominated by the Dragon Nest Legion, was firmly under its control.\nThis meant the first encampment would be securely established, governing the nearby territory.\nThe encampment's expansion plan had already succeeded!",

      "content": "The successful establishment of the first outpost greatly invigorated the entire Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThe main settlement of the Dragon Nest Tribe had been developed for several years, carefully managed, with the surrounding hundred-mile area under their control.\nHowever, this reached the limit of what the Dragon Nest Tribe could manage, and constraints from land production and the beastman population forced them to expand outward.\nThe outpost plan was essentially devised to acquire a forward base for expansion, supporting the continual outward growth of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nSimilar to the relationship between a main city and a satellite city, the main Dragon Nest settlement is the main city, and the outpost serves as the satellite city.\nThis expansion strategy, centered around the outpost, enables the Dragon Nest Tribe to expand outward with exceptional efficiency.\nStep by step, relying on the forward outpost to attack or defend, they extend further to achieve expansion and exploration goals.\nTo strengthen the connection between the outpost and the main Dragon Nest Tribe settlement, Dragon Nest Beastmen invested considerable effort in constructing a road linking the two areas.\nOf course, this road was merely a simple dirt path, not a labor-intensive gravel road or a stone-paved road.\nLike paths in the mountains formed by repeated footsteps, it was merely cleared by Dragon Nest Beastmen into a straightforward dirt road through frequent use.\nBy training herds of wild buffalo for transportation, Dragon Nest Beastmen used this road to connect the two outposts, enabling substantial exchange and support of resources.\nBronze tools not yet produced by the outpost, various grain resources, and hunting squad's fauna resources from external tribes all traveled through this road for a certain level of transportation link.\nWith such a road, communication between the outpost and the settlement remained unbroken.\nThe success in opening the first outpost instilled strong confidence throughout the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nIt is believed that a new outpost will soon be proposed for establishment.\nUsing the main settlement as the core, multiple forward outposts will be continuously established, linked through buffalo transport teams, constantly expanding the territory of the Dragon Nest Tribe and rapidly boosting its strength.\nThe rapidly developing Dragon Nest Tribe did experience shortcomings.\nThe proportion of Extraordinary beastmen within the tribe was small, with overall strength not high.\nBefore the harsh winter, Austin selected some \"seeds\" for extraordinary transformation during the First Dragon Nest Games.\nAustin, having awakened the Law Origin, would have a better transformative effect on activating extraordinary seeds with the beastmen.\nMoreover, prior to this, the Extraordinary beastmen \"seeds\" selected had undergone preliminary training, providing them with a stronger foundation, and the post-transformation Extraordinary Beastmen would start at a higher level, with Austin's current strength allowing for more transformations.\nUnfortunately, a series of events left Austin without time to focus on transforming beastmen, leaving the hundreds of selected Extraordinary beastmen seeds in standby.\nLuckily, it won't be long, just as soon as Austin finishes his retreat, he can mass-produce elite extraordinary beastmen, significantly enhancing the strength of the Dragon Nest Beastman Tribe.\nThe several months' wait does not matter for a few more days.\nWith the Elf Kingdom's surrender, the Dragon Nest Tribe entered a steady development phase.\nThe zombie undead to the southwest did not further expand, seemingly \"frightened\" by the earlier removal of a pyramid, scarcely spotted moving within two hundred miles of wasteland.\nPreviously, Austin's successive defeats of the Blood Claw Tribe's elite did not evoke any reaction, with the Blood Claw Tribe remaining quiet, the Tribe Alliance busy gathering forces to face the impending zombie undead, not intervening in Austin and Blood Claw's enmity.\nIt was calm, without any conflict.\nThis rare stable phase facilitated the Dragon Nest Tribe's rapid development.\n...\nMeanwhile, at the mountain retreat where Austin was cultivating, the wild winds and thunderstorm gradually ceased, and the heavy clouds above slowly dispersed.\n\"Finally succeeded!\"\nFeeling the two incredibly powerful forces within him, Austin murmured softly.\nBuzz, buzz, buzz!\nWith a slight thought, the void ahead rippled visibly, like a calm lake disturbed by two stones, and suddenly two swords, glowing brilliantly like a galaxy, emerged from the void, hovering before him.\nThese were new swords formed by focusing on Law, with elemental power as their flesh and blood.\nWith these two Law longswords appearing, the previously dispersed whirlwind and thunderstorm abruptly coalesced again, the heavy clouds above gathered once more, overwhelming the world.\nRumble!\nAmid deafening thunder, streaks of lightning tore across the sky, a fierce gust arose, whipped up volumes of sand and dust, transforming the world into a turbulent storm, as if heralding an apocalypse.\nThe elements of thunder and wind were raging throughout the world!\nThe mere appearance of these swords in the world caused a dramatic change in the surrounding weather.\nThis was the power of these upgraded Law longswords!\n\"Regarding the Thunder Sword, let's continue using the name Thunderbolt Divine Sword. As for the Wind Sword, since the wind originates from the heavens and earth, we'll call it Celestial Wind.\"\nThunderbolt Divine Sword, Celestial Wind Divine Sword.\nOne commands the thunder elements of the world, the other commands the wind elements.\nEach represents its own Law power, possessing mighty divine might.\n\"In my past life, there seemed to be a movie with the concept of Wind and Thunder Dual Swords unification, producing immense power. I wonder if my Wind and Thunder Swords could unify...\"\nRecalling Wind and Thunder Dual Swords, Austin pondered in his mind.\nDual Swords Unification, an idea prevalent in ancient martial arts novels and TV shows during his childhood, even a cartoon version with animals wielding swords from two to three, extending to seven could be unified.\nPerhaps, it's worth a try.\nHowever, Austin had little expectation for it.\nDual Swords Unification seemed simple, but in reality, mastering and merging two completely different powers to enhance their strength was complex.\nWithout understanding their principles, Austin had no basic guess or direction for trial and exploration.\nWithout a concept or direction, its complexity surpassed any technique Austin had developed previously.\nHowever, the matter of Dual Swords Unification wasn't urgent; insight into the Wind Law Origin still required a long distance.\nJust leveraging the Law power inherent in the Wind and Thunder Dual Swords was sufficient for Austin to significantly enhance his strength.\nAt least wait until his power hits a bottleneck before pursuing further advancement.\n\"Forget it, let's head back first!\"\nTwo months in retreat made him feel rusty, necessitating some exercise.\nJust as Austin prepared to spread his wings and leave, suddenly,\n\"Hey, big guy, how did you end up so large?\"\nA crisp, youthful, melodious voice unexpectedly echoed at his ear.\nAustin was startled, feeling his hair stand on end with shock.",

No wonder this crystal young dragon could approach him without him noticing at all.\nPiece by piece, scales like crystal, clear and sparkling.\nAustin suddenly felt a strong impulse arising from his instincts.\nTo take this crystal young dragon back to his nest and hide her there.\nDragons are inherently greedy, especially fond of shiny things. Although Austin's mature soul usually suppresses this instinct, at this moment, seeing that sparkling crystal young dragon, he almost took her back as if she were a piece of crystal.\nBarely managing to suppress this instinct, a thought suddenly flashed through his mind.\nNo wonder metal dragons and crystal dragons had higher status than five-colored dragons when seeking mates. After forming a pair, they could often see gold and silver crystal dazzling before their eyes; who wouldn't like that?\nDragons are inherently greedy, sharing a nest, perhaps often drooling over their mate's sparkling scales.\nThat image, unbearable to look at.\n\"Hey, big guy, what are you thinking?\"\nThe crystal dragon's clear and sweet voice rang out just in time, interrupting Austin's wayward thoughts.\n\"Ah, nothing, nothing at all.\"\nAustin quickly pushed aside the inappropriate images from his mind and came back to his senses.\n\"I always feel like you're thinking of something bad.\"\nThe crystal dragon looked at Austin with a gaze full of suspicion.\n\"No, definitely not. By the way, little sister, who are you? How did you get here?\"\n\"What little sister? Don't fool me, big guy, you definitely aren't much older than me.\"\nThe crystal dragon girl pouted and stared at Austin, making him feel utterly bewildered.\n\"Avril, big guy you can call me Avril. I saw some lightning and thunder over here, so I came to see if there's anything fun.\"\nUpon hearing this, Austin frowned, sensing that things were not so simple.\nYoung dragons are usually watched over by adult dragons.\nAvril appearing here, does it mean there is an adult dragon's nest nearby?\nThis is not good news.\nAlthough crystal dragons are of the lawful good alignment, leaving one's life in others' hands is not a good thing.\nIf careless, encountering an adult dragon with a slightly heavier curiosity.\nOh dear, how did this blue young dragon grow so fast, it's intriguing. Let's dissect and take a look.\nEven if this world doesn't have any methods for slice research, being the subject of study wouldn't be any better.\n\"By the way, big guy, how did you grow so fast? So amazing, uncle Guppa said dragons mastering law powers in their young dragon stage are already very talented. You mastering law at such a young age is simply a talent among talents.\"\nThese words made Austin shiver internally.\nThat he could master law powers was seen through by the girl before him.\nAustin's eyes flickered.\n\"I don't know either, seems like I ate something unknowingly before becoming like this.\"\n\"Oh, I see.\"\nFor some reason, the crystal dragon girl seemed a bit low.\nWhat's this reaction?\nCould it be like a child wanting to grow up quickly, seeing hope and then being ultimately let down?\nSo that's how it is.\n\"Avril, does your family live nearby?\"\nAustin probed.\n\"No, my home is very far away. Originally, I was going with uncle Guppa to that place with many dragons called Celestial Dragon Island. But halfway, we ran into some good friends, so we took a detour. Uncle Guppa and his friends were talking about some boring things, so I came out by myself.\"\nAvril showed no defense, saying it all at once.\nIndeed, adults visiting with kids and talking about this and that can be quite exhausting for naturally restless children, especially when adults talk for a whole day.\n\"Big guy, where do you live? How about taking me to your place to play?\"\nJust as Austin was about to speak in response to Avril, suddenly,\nSplash!\nIn a sound like tides crashing, space rippled like a mirror shaking, layer after layer of space ripples collapsed inward, and a bald, burly middle-aged man walked out of the space.\n\"Alright, Avril, time is running out, we have to hurry on our way.\"\nWith a resounding sound, Austin felt as if a realm from above descended, covering the surrounding void.\nAs he remained unsettled, Avril puffed her cheeks and whispered:\n\"Clearly it was uncle Guppa who got sidetracked, and kept babbling for days, don't blame me for missing the time.\"\nThough the voice was small, it was naturally impossible to hide it from the bald middle-aged man, who awkwardly touched his nose.\n\"Okay, this time it's uncle Guppa's fault. In the future, if Avril wants uncle Guppa to go east, then uncle Guppa will never dare to go west, how about that?\"\n\"Hmm, that's more like it.\"\nThe bald middle-aged man couldn't help but pat Avril's little head.\n\"Don't touch my head, it won't grow big!\"\nAvril puffed her cheeks.\nIgnoring her, he looked towards Austin.\n\"Avril, is this your new friend?\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, the big guy is really nice.\"\nAvril nodded, in her pure understanding, anyone she could converse with favorably was a friend.\n\"Already starting to involve law powers, hmm, little guy, reaching this stage in your juvenile period is very impressive, also a strange sword, huh? You don't have any parents to teach you?\"\nIn the bald middle-aged man's gaze, deep as the star river, it seemed to see through multiple spaces, see through everything in the world, and all the secrets of Austin were laid bare before him.\nThis made Austin nearly break into a cold sweat.\nFortunately, the biggest secret he seemed unaware of.\n\"No need to be nervous, little guy, you already match the four words 'astonishing talent'; there aren't many geniuses among the Giant Dragon Race, and I naturally won't do anything to you.\"\nAs he spoke, the bald middle-aged man extended his hand, in a burst of radiant glow appeared a half-transparent dragon claw.\nThen a certain scale from the dragon claw began to automatically detach, reflecting a deep luminescence.\n\"Little guy, a dragon growing to this stage in such a place is surely have gone through many hardships. Because of a mission, I'm about to leave and can't offer you much help. This scale is my gift to you.\"\nWith that, the bald middle-aged man handed the translucent scale in his hand to Austin, his gaze full of approval.\nOn Austin, he didn't smell any scent of an adult dragon.\nMeaning, the little guy achieved his current accomplishments entirely by himself.\nFor such a self-reliant junior, being from the Giant Dragon Race, even if not of the same lineage, the bald middle-aged man wouldn't hesitate to offer some care.\nIf not for the tight mission schedule, he might even have taken him back for a good teaching session.",

If it's within my power, I'll try my best to help.\"\n\"Thank you, elder.\"\nAustin quickly expressed his gratitude and carefully put away the scale.\nAlthough he didn't know what it was for, the fact that it was given so freely suggested it wasn't a simple item.\nIt seemed this elder wasn't so hard to talk to after all.\nWhat a relief.\nAustin secretly sighed in relief in his heart.\nLuck was still on his side; all the worries he had before did not come to pass.\n\"Alright, time is almost up, Avril, let's go.\"\nThe bald middle-aged man nodded and looked at Avril.\nA man and a dragon soared up, and the space above suddenly spun and collapsed inward, forming a massive void vortex.\nThe two figures flew towards the pitch-black void vortex.\nAt that moment, as Austin relaxed, a question suddenly popped into his mind.\nAvril mentioned that they originally intended to go to that Celestial Dragon Island, but ended up diverting through here due to someone else.\nMoreover, that existence known as Guppa, with unknown realm and power, had triggered Avril to come out because of negotiations with certain people.\nWhat were they discussing?\nCould it relate to the current situation in the Kawa Great Forest, especially the zombie undead tide sweeping through the entire forest land?\nPreviously, Austin had found it strange why no legendary figures had stepped in during the widespread zombie undead tide.\nCould the negotiations between Guppa and certain people be related to this?\nTo become a negotiator, one's level and power must be at least beyond legendary!\nWere the talks beyond legendary level targeting the upheaval in the Kawa Great Forest this time?\nAustin instinctively sensed a feeling of unease.\n\"Elder Guppa, I have settled nearby and developed a Clan Tribe, but recently a mutant undead nearly swept through the entire Great Forest, even spreading nearby. Can the elder give me some advice?\"\nConnecting this to the situation in the Kawa Great Forest, taking advantage of Guppa and Avril not fully disappearing, Austin suddenly shouted.\n\"It's nothing much. If you don't get involved, there won't be any danger. The calamity unleashed by the mutant undead has reached its limit. Those high and mighty legendary beings have begun their final act to bury everything. Soon, they will face total annihilation.\"\nA low voice echoed around, causing Austin's heart to tense as he listened carefully, not wanting to miss a word.\n\"This chaos is just the last counterattack before the insects' deaths... The continuation of that war is about to reach its final conclusion... The legendary figures fear the legacy left by those people, but the probing cannon fodder has already gathered, and everything will end.\"\nThe bald middle-aged man seemed to recall something amidst his dazedness, with a tone of regret, sighs, and indescribable emotions.\n\"Like the last shovelful of soil on a grave, when they perish, they become the final gravestone.\"\n\"No matter how great the achievement, it will one day fall to dust, becoming the grave of death, forever resting within the earth...\"\nThe thunderous echoes between heaven and earth slowly faded, and the massive void vortex in the sky above closed and disappeared, as if nothing had ever appeared.\nAustin stood in place, racking his brain.\nAt this moment, he far from comprehended every word of Guppa, but from Guppa's words, he detected some clues.\nThe initiation of the zombie undead calamity indeed had a mastermind behind it manipulating everything.\nAnd those legendary existences watching from afar had begun to place their chess pieces, pushing the final situation forward to completely end all this in a war.\nThese two points are the information Austin could temporarily confirm.\nSimultaneously,\nAccording to the bald middle-aged Guppa's words, the masterminds behind the zombie undead calamity, which swept through the Kawa Great Forest and forced hundreds of thousands of beastmen to retreat and attack the Bloody Border, had always been the weak side?\nTheir actions were just the last resistance before the insects' death.\nNow, they had reached a dead end.\nNo wonder after the destruction of the Pyramid and the interception and defeat of the vanguard of the zombie undead army, there was no further action from the zombies and undead as they retracted and defended.\nSo, it's because of these reasons.\nSome doubts suddenly became clear.\nThe chess game promoted by the legendary ones is likely the upcoming grand counterattack by the Tribe Alliance of hundreds of thousands of beastmen at the border and the humans beyond the border.\nNo wonder the humans and beastmen, who harbored endless years of blood feuds, put aside their enmity. It's probably the result of the legends intervening.\nThese numerous Tribe Alliance beastmen, along with the humans who united with them, may be the probing cannon fodder Guppa referred to!\n\"Trouble, too much trouble!\"\nGuppa's words made Austin barely sort out some things.\nHowever, when you solve one mystery, even more mysteries appear before you!\nWho exactly are the masterminds behind the zombie undead calamity?\nWhy did they initiate a turmoil that swept through the entire Kawa Great Forest and yet were the weaker side?\nWhat does fearing the legacy left by those people mean?\nAnd the end of the last war, the last shovelful of soil on the grave that buries everything...\nSo many questions, too many.\nRealizing the broad situation he faced didn't make Austin happy.\nBecause behind all of this, there was likely an even grander truth hidden!\nAnd all of this almost made him shiver with fear.\n\"The counterattack should begin soon. In this war pushed by the legendary beings, exploratory and exhaustive, I'm better off staying on the sidelines and minding my own business.\"\nAustin had already made up his mind not to get involved in these troubles.\n\"According to the Tribe Alliance's side, the zombie undead calamity was initially triggered by mutations of evil spirits in the core area. Although there's plenty exaggerated, it started spreading from the core is true... A thousand years ago, the Elf Kingdom that once dominated the entire Kawa Great Forest might know something.\"\nToo many doubts urgently needed answers.\nGazing at the shimmering scale in his claw, Austin did not stay for long, spread his wings, and flew away.\nHaving won the war with the Elf Kingdom, the elves surrendered and submitted entirely.\nMore than two months have passed, and who knows the specifics of the Dragon Nest Tribe now.\nPerhaps nothing problematic happened, and maybe they'll even provide him with some surprises.\nHowever, compared to the surprises from the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin was more eager to uncover the ultimate truth from the Elf Kingdom's high command.",

      "content": "Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAs the dominant center of the region within a hundred miles, the Dragon Nest Base, after years of expansion, has already grown to the scale of a small city.\nEnormous buildings rise from the ground, with rows of houses stretching endlessly. The street planning is neat and orderly, making it particularly pleasing to the eye.\nBeastmen walk the streets, with the ground clean and tidy; even the fallen leaves are swept away, unlike other Beastman Tribe gathering places where dung is scattered everywhere in street corners.\nAs a semi-militarized managed Dragon Nest Tribe, nowadays, with the rapid population growth, some aspects have been somewhat relaxed, but when it comes to discipline and hygiene, those are ironclad rules that will never be casually loosened.\nAt the beginning stage of Dragon Nest Tribe's construction, to maximally consolidate the power of the Beastman Race, the entire tribe implemented complete militarization management.\nUnified arrangement, unified command, unified food distribution.\nIt's precisely this initial military management that allowed the Dragon Nest Tribe to expand and develop at an unbelievable speed.\nBut later, as the Dragon Nest Tribe's population gradually increased, especially after surpassing ten thousand, re-implementing unified militarization management was no longer suitable for this gradually huge military group.\nTherefore, in daily management, the Dragon Nest Tribe gradually loosened its control over the Beastmen.\nFirst was the distribution system, transitioning from collective food distribution to a work-points system, then based on the actual situation of the Beastmen, they were gradually divided into Beastman Soldiers, Beastman Militia, and Beastman Producers.\nAs time passed and the tribe's population rapidly expanded, this institutional change was further gradually improved.\nNowadays, the Dragon Nest Tribe system is military power as the main body, with various dependent Beastman Producers as auxiliary, complementing each other.\nThe implementation of the work-points system also represents the recognition of individual labor.\nBeastmen with leftover work-points began to gradually engage in trading, and the recorded work-points assumed part of the currency function.\nWith the tribe's population further increasing, today, there have been some signs of a private economy within the tribe.\nThe Beastman leadership did not obstruct this because, having been around Austin for a long time, they were frequently instilled by Austin with some modern civilization knowledge to avoid forgetting some things, and they were told outlines for the tribe's development.\nIncluded were some issues regarding the private sector.\nIn Austin's blueprint, if an Orc Kingdom could indeed be established throughout the entire Kawa Great Forest in the future, then the nucleus of that kingdom would never be complete militarization but a system focusing on the military as the main body, with private individual enterprises rising together.\nMilitary power as the core, the populace as the foundation.\nThis is Austin's blueprint goal for that future kingdom, and the Beastman leadership is also aware of it.\nWith the increase in ordinary Beastman Producers, after wealth accumulation, things like private trade would inevitably emerge.\nTherefore, when the tribe's private transactions appeared, the Beastman leadership did not stop it.\nOf course, they did not encourage it either; everything was allowed to take its course naturally.\nHowever, relative to some relaxations in areas, the tribe secretly tightened political education for the Beastmen.\nWhether tightening or not actually doesn't matter. Throughout the Dragon Nest Tribe, the Dragon Nest Beastmen's worship of Austin and the cohesion towards the Dragon Nest Tribe cannot be compared to any tribe in the Kawa Great Forest.\nThese changes happening within the Beastman are hard to see.\nBut just by taking a look at the current Dragon Nest Tribe City, one can feel to what extent the Dragon Nest Tribe has developed.\nCompared to two months ago, the tribal city has once again been greatly expanded.\nInterconnected buildings rise from the ground, high walls enclosing rows of houses, with streets varying in an orderly layout.\nOne could even say that the Dragon Nest Tribe City now is the only civilized place within the Kawa Great Forest.\nWhen Austin flew over the sky and gazed at the vast town below, a sense of pride surged in his heart.\nThis is the city he built!\nFrom the initially destitute seven and a half kobolds, constructing simple thatched huts on trees.\nTo today, the prototype of a city is rising in the boundless sea of trees, vast fields spreading out in all directions.\nBeastmen are walking and working within the town, and the entire tribe city is a scene of prosperity.\nTo have developed to this stage with nothing but bare hands, anyone has the right to pride.\nThe kobolds, who were initially protected under his wings, struggled to survive in the dangerous forest while holding wooden spears tremblingly against Ghost-headed Crocodiles, never imagined the scene today!\nAfter a turn in the sky, the Beastmen below cheered enthusiastically.\nEven separated by thousands of meters of sky, Austin could feel the fervent worship coming from countless Beastmen below.\nBefore long, Austin landed on the high platform in the center of the inner city, where Vini and other Beastmen were already waiting.\n\"Your Highness, you are back.\"\n\"Hmm, Vini, Quik, and Rodney, you all did a great job.\"\nEven just looking down from the sky, one could feel that robust upward momentum.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe's development to its present stage is inseparable from their efforts.\nAfterwards, Vini and others reported on some recent developments of the Dragon Nest Tribe, briefly summarizing the overall situation to Austin.\nRecently, nothing major occurred within the tribe.\nIn the process of expansion and development, the Dragon Nest Tribe achieved everything smoothly, significantly enhancing its controlled region after successfully establishing the first stronghold, meanwhile clearing dangerous areas while sweeping nearby Beastman Tribes, acquiring numerous magic resources.\nOverall, the Dragon Nest Tribe remains stable.\nHowever, there are two rather troublesome matters needing Austin's direct attention.\nThe first is the need to raise the number of Extraordinary Beastmen. This transformation process mandatorily involves Austin. During the cold winter, hundreds of seeds were selected through events, and now with Austin's return, this issue can be resolved, enhancing the Dragon Nest Tribe's military strength.\nThe second is Rodney wishing to select some elves from the elf captives to train into a spellcaster team.\nIn the battle outside the first stronghold, the lack of spellcasters in the Dragon Nest Legion revealed its drawbacks. Now having overthrown the Elf Kingdom, it is the right time to select and form the Dragon Nest Tribe's own spellcaster team from the large number of elves.\nFor these two matters, Austin naturally had no reason to refuse, yet he did not immediately proceed.\nCurrently, what he most aspires to is meeting the Elf Queen, who has been under house arrest for over two months, to obtain information about the core area from the upper echelons of the elves.\nA thousand years ago, they once ruled the entire Kawa Great Forest, so they must be knowledgeable about many things.\nThe unknown realm power of Guppa's words brought immense pressure to Austin.",

      "content": "The Elf Queen Eve gazed out the window, maintaining this posture for quite a long time.\nSince being captured, the Dragon Nest Beastman soldiers had escorted her and the Elven higher-ups to the Dragon Nest Tribe City, confining them in this room.\nAs the former queen of a kingdom, she naturally received preferential treatment.\nThe house was well-ventilated and bright, offering a view that encompassed much of the tribe from a high vantage point.\nAlthough she couldn't leave freely, life here was not as bleak as imagined.\nLooking at the former citizens of the kingdom, walking the streets with smiles on their faces, Eve's feelings were complex. She couldn't tell if she should feel grateful or sorrowful, as mixed emotions made her heart ache.\nIn the past, to escape the pure-blooded Beastmen's pursuit and to prevent their pursuers from finding their tracks, the remnants of the Elf Kingdom mostly hid within the kingdom's Secret Realm Space, rarely venturing out.\nIf not for the Beastmen establishing outposts, cutting down a large number of trees and shaking the Elf Mother Tree's foundation, leading the Elf Kingdom to mistakenly identify the Dragon Nest Beastmen as their pursuers, the elves probably would not have shown themselves so easily.\nThis approach of guarding the Secret Realm Space protected the kingdom's elves, but it also led to significant poverty among the lower-class elven populace.\nWithin this small Secret Realm Space supported by the Mother Tree, it was necessary to sustain tens of thousands of people.\nAt the same time, the limited land resources were largely occupied by the elven elders and other upper nobles.\nThe remaining small portion was the farmland upon which the elven commoners relied for survival.\nThe upper class pursued luxury, filling their rooms with intricately carved artworks, and planted beautiful flowers and trees on fertile lands, occupying most of the kingdom's Secret Realm Space but not engaging in production.\nThe lower-class elven populace struggled to survive on the limited barren lands and still had to pay a large share to the upper class.\nThe sense of peace and stability within the entire Secret Realm Space was just a façade crafted by the upper-class elven nobility, content with the status quo.\nThe true Elf Kingdom had already rotted away long ago.\nSince becoming queen, bearing the fate of the race's continuation, Eve rarely saw the smiles on the faces of the elven commoners.\nEve did not understand grand principles but could clearly feel that her people were not happy.\nLife was hard, and the atmosphere was oppressive.\nBut now?\nWhen the kingdom space was breached, the army broke, and the Dragon Nest Legion marched in, Eve often imagined the miserable life her people would face.\nIn the Forest Land, the victors often liked to take the vanquished as slaves.\nAnd among slaves, fewer than ten percent survived a year!\nThose dark lives would forever haunt them.\nThe Elf Kingdom was completely destroyed from then on.\nHowever, when the despairing Eve became a captive, confined in the Dragon Nest Tribe City.\nAs time passed, what she saw was more and more smiles on the once ordinary citizens' faces.\nGenuine laughter from the heart.\nThis indicated that the natural people, turned captives of evil, had not fallen into the dark hell but rather attained a satisfaction hard to achieve during the kingdom period.\nIs it laughable?\nLaughable.\nShe, being the queen of all the surviving elven people, reigning over the kingdom's remaining elves, believed Nature's light could bring beauty to each of her people.\nYet she only brought them poverty and struggle, while under the regime of evil, joy blossomed.\nEve quietly looked out the window, the experiences over more than two months greatly shook her heart.\nShe stood there, dumbfounded, for a long, long time.\nAt some point, a Beastman soldier came to take her away.\nEve composed herself, remained calm, and also carried a sliver of curiosity as she left.\nShe was about to meet the legendary figure who, in a few short years, single-handedly built this vast empire.\nBlue Dragon Austin.\n...\nThe enormous great hall resembled a circular coliseum, with giant stone tiered walls surrounding it, sunlight streaming down from overhead, casting a vast shadow over the central platform and covering a large area.\nA massive shadow stood towering at the top.\nThe face obscured by shadows was out of sight, but with a little imagination,\none could envision the horrific and terrifying figure hidden within the shadows, a darkness swallowing the world, plunging it into a chasm of despair.\nA figure capable of terrifying a neighboring child to death.\n\"Greetings, Your Highness.\"\nEve half-knelt towards the terrifying, despair-inducing figure, offering the due courtesy to the one who had destroyed her kingdom and was now the master of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nEve looked down, unable to see the face.\nAustin could sense that the elf queen before him had her own thoughts, yet he did not care.\n\"Elf Queen Eve, having stayed here for two months, you should understand, under my command, there has never been differentiation between races.\"\nAustin observed the figure below, his deep voice echoed like thunder in the vast hall.\n\"Whether Goblins, Kobolds, Ratmen, Jackal Wolf people, Lizardmen, Minotaurs... regardless of their race, there are, to me, only two kinds of people: useful and useless. If you can satisfy me, I don't mind letting you continue to lead your people.\"\nHis voice paused, then lifted a bit.\n\"Do you understand?\"\nEve remained silent, raising her head slowly, looking towards the giant shadow above.\nThe face was unseen, but from the outline, one could imagine the terrifying head hidden within the shadow.\nYet in Eve's heart, a sudden beacon of hope was born, marked with disbelief, her voice slightly excited.\n\"Thank you for your mercy, great Austin, Your Highness.\"\nShe understood Austin's meaning.\nShe could continue to be the queen within the Elven community, as long as she demonstrated sufficient value.\nThis meant the Elf Kingdom could become a vassal kingdom of Austin.\nThe Elf Kingdom could possibly continue to exist!\nAs the queen of the elven race, her mother once entrusted the kingdom's remnants into her hands, the monumental task of extending the kingdom's future.\nIf hope existed, how could Eve resign to let the kingdom fade into history?\nEven if the Elf Kingdom became a puppet, even if the title of Elf Queen was merely nominal, Eve would not wish for this emblem of significance to vanish.\n\"Very well, regarding some matters next, I do not wish for you to conceal them.\"\nWhat has been swallowed, Austin would not easily relinquish.\nAs long as the majority of elves were under his control, as long as the major part of the elven populace served him, as long as he could draft powerful individuals to form a spellcaster army under his command.\nWith most elves under his control, what did the nominal title of an Elf Queen of the Elf Kingdom amount to?\nAustin had learned in his past life about methods to sideline a power structure, though he might not have seen pigs run, he had surely eaten pork.\n```",

      "content": "One hand holds a big stick, the other a carrot.\nAustin deliberately gave away a false title, all for the Elf Queen Eve to reveal everything she knows.\nThe situation in the Kawa Great Forest is indeed quite complicated now.\nEspecially Austin and his Dragon Nest Tribe, who have expanded and grown to this extent in just a few years.\nAlthough this development speed is quite astonishing, it also has many shortcomings.\nOne of them is the foundation of information.\nSome information, which may be common knowledge for large tribes, remains elusive secrets to Austin, who rose rapidly in a short time.\n\"Eve, elves have said before that a thousand years ago, your branch of the elf race once established a massive elf kingdom in the heart of the Kawa Great Forest, ruling the vast forest land. Later, the beastmen rebelled, and you fled here, relying on the power of the Elf Mother Tree to hide. Then you encountered my soldiers, mistaking them for pursuing forces, and eventually, you launched the final war. Is that correct?\"\nAustin goes straight to the point without much preamble.\nThis information was obtained from the elven captives during the besieged warfare at the stronghold, and as for more detailed information, only the Eve before him might know.\n\"Forgive me, Your Highness, it was my oversight that offended you.\"\nEve covers her palm over her chest and bows in apology.\n\"What I need isn't these pleasantries. Tell me your history, the events before and after that battle a thousand years ago, and even earlier origins of your elves, in full detail. I will listen carefully, I have plenty of time.\"\nThe deep voice reverberated in the air, filled with an oppressive majesty.\nEve found Austin's demands somewhat strange, but she still slowly recounted what she knew.\nAll of this must be traced back a thousand years.\nAt that time, Eve was still a child, and much of what she knew was fragmented, spoken intermittently.\nBut at the same time, having experienced the great upheaval of the kingdom's downfall, Eve also had deeper insights into certain things.\nA thousand years ago, or even further back, elves and beastmen lived peacefully together, and it seemed that there was an equally ancient covenant between the two races, a covenant dating back to unknown times.\nAnd precisely because of this covenant, at that time, the elven royal family who ruled the entire Kawa Great Forest did not guard against the beastmen, which was the essential reason for the rapid collapse of the Elven Kingdom after the beastmen's rebellion.\nEve was unaware of the content of the covenant.\nBack then, she was very young, merely an unfavored princess within the Elven Kingdom. During that massive beastmen rebellion, many of the royal family were killed, but she survived by luck, was raised to the queen's throne by the surviving elves, and eventually escaped to the nearby area to hide.\nWhat Eve knew came merely from the occasional conversations of her parents, that it seemed to be a covenant from ancient times, incredibly important.\n\"A covenant, beastmen? And what happened afterward? Who currently occupies the central area, and after the rebellion, didn't those beastmen establish a Beastman Royal Court? Did some unforeseen changes occur later?\"\nAustin constantly revealed a look of doubt.\nIf there really was a Beastman Royal Court, then why is there no information about it?\nAt least, among the myriad races under Austin, numbering in the tens of thousands of beastman races, none had ever heard of a Beastman Royal Court within the Kawa Great Forest.\n\"There is, the Beastman Royal Court exists in the central area. They established the Beastman Royal Court shortly after overthrowing the kingdom.\"\nAs if hearing Austin's inner doubts, Eve continued to speak.\n\"The lack of circulated information is because they consciously block the news.\"\n\"Although the kingdom nominally ruled the entire Kawa Great Forest back then, in reality, the kingdom's citizens considered their bloodlines noble and treated the struggling half-beastmen outside the central area as if they were seeing beasts. Coupled with the extreme poverty of the beastman tribes around the borders, there wasn't a shred of benefit to be gained for the wealthy kingdom; thus, the kingdom adopted a policy of ignoring the beastman tribes outside the core.\"\n\"Later, after the beastmen struck back and toppled the kingdom, they also adopted the same policy, and even went further by deliberately severing ties with the beastman tribes in the barren outer regions. They only helped foster a few large tribes at the borders by supplying grain resources, which seemed aimed at letting them skirmish with humans to divert human attention.\"\nUpon hearing this, Austin felt not relief, but even more puzzled.\n\"Why would those beastmen do this?\"\nSo strange.\nIf he were leading beastmen to overthrow the Elven Kingdom, the next step would surely be to boast about it, thereby attracting numerous beastman tribes to rapidly expand the Beastman Royal Court's power.\nYet those beastmen deliberately severed ties with the outside world.\nAccording to Eve, among the countless beastman tribes within the whole Kawa Great Forest, apart from those few super-large tribes on the border often engaged in tug-of-war with humans, none knew anything about the Beastman Royal Court in the central area.\nWhy were they doing this, essentially severing themselves?\n\"Because those beastmen connected with the ancestral covenant are truly pure-blooded.\"\nPure-blooded beastmen, the royal lineage among beastmen.\nIt is said among the beastman tribes scattered across the Kawa Great Forest, there once existed a tremendously vast Beastman Empire spanning the entire continent, established by pure-blooded beastmen!\n\"What!\"\nThis time, Austin was genuinely surprised.\nThe first time he saw the name Pure-blooded Beastman was a few years ago, in a note left by a Gold-Level Great Mage.\nLater, this matter even led a young man named Edward and a group of mercenaries to explore this place, resulting in conflict.\nAt the time, Austin had asked the Fox-faced Man Quik, and according to Quik, Pure-blooded Beastmen and the Beastman Empire were likely just myths conjured by the beastmen, and hence, he hadn't paid much attention.\nCould these matters be related somehow?\nAustin quickly pondered these thoughts in his mind.\n\"So, you're saying that currently, in the core area of the Kawa Great Forest, there exists a Beastman Royal Court established by pure-blooded beastmen, and it is providing support in the form of resources to nurture those few super-large tribes in the Border Tribe Alliance, right?\"\nEve thought for a moment and replied:\n\"Those pure-blooded ones certainly established a Beastman Royal Court and occupied the place of the ancestors, that's for sure. As for those few super-large tribes tugging against humans for hundreds and thousands of years at the borders, they should indeed be supported by the Beastman Royal Court from behind.\"",

      "content": "No wonder!\nIf that's really the case, then the legendary vast Beastman Empire that spanned the entire continent might indeed have existed.\nThe Pure-bloods cutting off contact between the Royal Court and the myriad Beastman Tribes outside is probably to prevent further provoking the humans.\nAfter all, with such gloriously unmatched feats of ruling the continent in the past, if the Pure-bloods were to unite the tens of millions of Beastmen within the Kawa Great Forest, the Beastman Kingdom they establish would surely become the target of hostility from the majority of human royal palaces.\nSecretly supporting the establishment of super tribes like the Blood Claw Tribe at the border and frequently clashing with humans is probably another means of diverting attention.\nWithout the support of the Pure-blooded Beastman Royal Court, relying solely on raiding food supplies from the Human World at the border wouldn't be able to sustain the consumption of such massive tribal populations numbering in the hundreds of thousands to millions.\nThat Great Wall at the Bloody Border is said to have started construction a thousand years ago, and it might also be related to the Pure-blooded Beastman Royal Court at the core area. While guarding against the mega-tribes supported and established by the Pure-blooded Beastman Royal Court, it also guards against the Pure-blooded Beastman Royal Court deep within the forest.\n\"Perhaps, as Elder Guppa said, the protagonist of the bug's last counterattack before dying is these Pure-blooded Beastmen. The so-called continuation of the last war might just be the final end of the collapsing Beastman Empire war.\"\n\"And the zombie undead tide disaster sweeping across the entire Kawa Great Forest is something these Pure-blooded Beastmen pushed behind the scenes. The zombie undead tide army seems to be absorbing and synthesizing something very important to the Pure-blooded Beastmen with life as raw material, which is likely to become their capital to turn the tables, possibly part of their inheritance.\"\nWherever the zombie undead tide passed, life was extinguished, and the land became a wasteland.\nAnd that Pyramid, in Austin's eyes, seemed like an altar.\nAn altar that uses boundless life as a sacrifice to obtain certain powers.\n\"Pure-blooded Beastmen see the surrounding Beastmen as savages. Even if they use them, they don't regard the Beastmen of the outer tribes as kin. Thus, the several mega-tribes at the border like the Blood Claw Tribe, which they supported, were deliberately calculated into becoming the raw materials of the zombie undead tide. Finally being exposed, they naturally faced backlash from the Beastman Alliance.\"\n\"No wonder the first warrior of the Blood Claw was suspected of being a spy. With the Pure-blooded Beastmen's prestige, this might not even be an impossibility.\"\nMany things fell into place once Eve mentioned the words Pure-blooded Beastmen and Beastman Royal Court.\nThings should be this way.\nMany years ago, the continent-spanning Beastman Empire was destroyed for some reason.\nThe Empire's royal family, the Pure-blooded Beastmen, fled with a large number of Half-Beastman to the Kawa Great Forest, and settled and hid under an ancient pact with the Elf Kingdom.\nUntil a thousand years ago, the ambitious Pure-blooded Beastmen turned against their allies and launched a grand war against the Elf Kingdom, rapidly destroying it and occupying the core area.\nAfterward, the Beastman Royal Court established by the Pure-blooded Beastmen consciously cut off contacts with the outside world, hiding well and setting up the outer defenses.\nIn recent years, the peaceful time ended.\nFor unknown reasons and unknown forces' interference,\nthe Beastman Royal Court faced an imminent crisis of destruction.\nTo retaliate, the Pure-bloods activated a massive undead calamity through the inheritance left by their ancestors.\nThis mutation of the undead calamity, like zombies, resembled a grand sacrificial ceremony, sacrificing the boundless life of the forest land, along with the death of the earth, to obtain their final reliance.\nThe Legendaries, wary of the inheritance left by the Beastman Empire back then, allowed the undead calamity to develop while they began to set up for the kill.\nAs the hundreds of millions of Beastman Alliance on the periphery reached an agreement with humans, probably now, the final setup counterattack war is complete.\n\"Yes, the note back then mentioned that the few remaining Pure-blooded Beastmen fled to the Kawa Great Forest. That was the last remnant of the Empire's royal lineage. As long as this war destroys the Beastman Royal Court, the once-gloriously unmatched Beastman Empire will also be completely buried. Those Pure-blooded Beastmen in the Beastman Royal Court are like the last clod of earth on the Beastman Empire's grave, about to fall.\"\nOnly at this moment did Austin finally understand the meaning of Elder Guppa's last words.\n\"No matter how great the achievements, one day they will fall to the mundane, becoming the purpose of death, forever resting beneath the earth.\"\nThat great achievement was likely the awe-inspiring Beastman Empire.\nEven today, no country has been able to achieve the feat of ruling the entire continent as the Beastman Empire did back then.\nFrom the current Central Earth's Human World, with its numerous human duchies, one can see a corner of the grand image of the Beastman Empire that once dominated the entire continent.\nNo wonder someone wants to completely eradicate the Beastman Royal Court, which carries on the Empire's afterglow.\n\"Just the war to clear the last remnants has swept across millions of square kilometers of the vast region of the Kawa Great Forest. It's truly unimaginable what kind of spectacular scene the final collapse of that vast Empire must have been.\"\nUnderstanding the cause and effect, Austin couldn't help but sigh in his heart.\nHe wondered if he could, in his lifetime, establish a nation more glorious than the Beastman Empire of those days.\nFrom under the starry sky, seeing all the land as one's territory.\n\"Your Highness, if there's nothing else, I'll take my leave first.\"\nIn the long silence, seeing Austin deep in thought, Eve prepared to leave.\n\"Yes, you may leave.\"\nAustin waved a paw, signaling her to leave,\nand as Eve turned, Austin casually asked.\n\"By the way, do you know the reason for the final collapse of the Beastman Empire back then?\"\nHer body suddenly went rigid.\nThis momentary rigidity allowed Austin to keenly perceive it.\nThe air felt a bit tense.\n\"Your, Your Highness, I...\"\nThe Elf Queen Eve turned around, her voice stumbling.\nIndeed, this woman knew something!\nAustin narrowed his eyes, focusing on Eve below.\n\"Eve, I trust you wouldn't deceive me, right?\"\nWith a thunderous sound resonating, a bit of dragon might was released, a terrifying pressure descended from the high sky, accompanied by an overwhelmingly dark despair, covering Eve's heart.\nSilent, oppressive.\nAt a certain moment, Elf Queen Eve seemed to sigh, as if letting something go.\n\"Your Highness, I don't know much, but when I was very young, I once eavesdropped on a conversation between my father and someone behind the scenes...\"\nEve hesitated for a moment, then uttered something that shocked Austin immensely:\n\"I suspect that long ago, both the Beastman Empire and the Kingdom were once blasphemers. This might be the biggest reason behind the unknown pact signed between the Pure-blooded Beastmen and the Elf race.\"",

      "content": "The so-called heretic refers to those who do not respect the gods and rebel against the Divine Church.\nUnbelievers who do not believe in the divine are seen by the Church as lost sheep, and priests have the duty to guide these sheep in the right direction.\nHowever, heretics are hated by every Divine Church, akin to the existence of Hell Demons.\nBecause they not only disrespect the divine, but also oppose them.\n\"Was the entire Beastman Empire heretics back then? What about your Elf Kingdom lineage?\"\nAustin seemed somewhat incredulous, but then suddenly understood.\nNo wonder the Beastman Empire eventually collapsed suddenly, and it is now difficult to find traces of the Beastman Empire left in the annals of history.\nThis world does contain true deities, with many Divine Kingdoms shining under the starry sky, the gazes of gods overlooking the human realm.\nYou may be an unbeliever or a follower of another deity, but you must never show any disrespect to the divine, even if another god is an archrival to your faith.\nHeretics are the absolute enemies of every deity.\nThe entire Beastman Empire was established by heretics, which is truly hard to believe.\n\"I'm afraid during the collapse of the Beastman Empire, the lofty deities also intervened in this war, but where did the Beastman Empire get the courage to openly resist divine rule and build an empire spanning the entire continent?\"\nA perplexing question inevitably arose from the depths of his heart.\nTo create such a massive empire, the pure-blooded beastmen of the past certainly weren't fools.\nYet they still acted this way, perhaps possessing courage unfearing even the divine.\n\"Your Highness, this is merely a guess derived from conversations I overheard between Father King and Mother Queen discussing alliances, so it might not be the case.\"\nEve's expression appeared somewhat unnatural.\nThis isn't surprising, as every elf deeply believes in the God of Nature, viewing the God of Nature from the bottom of their hearts as their parent.\nEvery year, on God's birthday, the entire Elf Kingdom would hold a celebration lasting several days to repay their most beloved God of Nature.\nHowever, now they are being told this.\nMany years ago, their ancestors not only didn't believe in any deities but were famous heretics.\nIf that's the case, wasn't everything just a lie?\nThis is something nobody can accept.\nEve's reaction was understandable.\nNext, Austin and Eve chatted in the great hall for a while longer, and after confirming the Elf Queen had nothing else to retain, he let her leave.\nEven long after the silhouette of Elf Queen Eve had vanished, Austin stood still in place.\n\"How troublesome, the matter involves so much. Judging by the previous situation in the Kawa Great Forest where legends never emerged, it's estimated this time, the counterattack war to destroy the Beastman Royal Court might also have divine intervention behind the scenes. It seems better to stay in the tribe for a while; let those fellows resolve other matters themselves.\"\n\"Though once they had the courage to challenge the divine, even if the Beastman Empire eventually collapsed, the remnants of the empire probably still possessed enough strength to ensure their own survival.\"\n\"After all, though my current strength is not bad, in the face of a legendary divine-level war, I'm just a slightly stronger locust at best.\"\nHaving made up his mind, Austin decided not to participate in this war at all.\nIt's likely that cannon fodder will soon gather to counterattack, and having one more or less himself makes no difference.\nHopefully, all forces will severely damage each other, allowing him to reap the benefits afterward.\n\"Currently, the most important thing is to rapidly enhance my own strength.\"\nA robust force is ultimately the most potent safeguard for self-preservation.\nEspecially since the entire Kawa Great Forest is about to enter a stage where a war impacting the entire forest land is on the horizon.\nAfter carefully considering the upcoming plans, Austin then flew away.\n...\nIn the period following that, the Dragon Nest Tribe continued to develop steadily.\nThe first stronghold was successfully established, and the surrounding farmland also yielded a harvest, with the first season's kudzu root achieving a bountiful yield.\nAdditionally, near the first stronghold, not only did they discover several orchards, but also three rivers, seven or eight lakes or reservoirs, and a very suitable plain for agricultural development.\nThe wild fruits in the orchards can be collected for food, and the river and lake areas, apart from having a large number of fish resources in the water, often serve as a watering place for herbivores, providing excellent hunting grounds.\nMoreover, the large-scale development of the plain could provide more arable land for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThese all indicate that the Dragon Nest Tribe is about to enter a stage of significant output increase, with ample grains allowing them to support a larger beastman population, thereby continually increasing the population limit of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nRough estimates suggest that if the first stronghold is fully developed, it could sustain a population of at least over one hundred thousand.\nOf course, this is under the premise of complete development, as the current development level of the territory near the first stronghold is only about one-tenth or one-twelfth.\nCompleting all development in just a few years is practically impossible.\nThe development planned for the first stronghold ahead requires little attention, simply executing the specific policies previously established steadily.\nOnce the first stronghold is fully developed, the Dragon Nest Tribe will inevitably undergo another round of expansion, pushing the beastman population to break through the hundred-thousand-number barrier.\nMeanwhile, the Kobold Vini, the Fox-faced Man Quik, and other high-ranking members of the Dragon Nest Beastmen began to determine the direction of development for the second stronghold, while dispatching advance teams for exploration and investigation.\nWhile the Dragon Nest Tribe was thriving, Austin also began his work.\nUpon selecting the Extraordinary Seed from the previous cold winter season, among those chosen for meritorious reward, along with some later outstanding Demon Seed candidates, Austin performed extraordinary transformations on over a thousand total beastmen.\nIn the initial stages of the Dragon Nest Tribe's development, Austin did not understand the principles by which he could transform beastmen, simply believing it was the innate authority of the Giant Dragon Race.\nAs his strength increased, he has realized that this is the influence resulting from the Legendary Law hidden within the Giant Dragon Bloodline.\nNow Austin has mastered two threads of Law, making the transformation effects naturally much better than in the past.\nThus, supported by abundant magic resources, over a thousand extraordinary clan members began to emerge from the transformation chamber, greatly enhancing the overall strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThese transformed beastmen clan members possess a minimum strength of intermediate Bronze level or above.\nSuch a vast number of extraordinary clan members, once even slightly trained, could join the main force of the Dragon Nest Legion, significantly boosting its strength.\nAfter transforming the beastmen, Austin also handled some important miscellaneous matters within the Dragon Nest Tribe before finally having some free time.\nHowever, there was no way he would remain idle doing nothing, never in this lifetime would he be idle.\nThe current situation in the Kawa Great Forest brought much pressure on Austin's strength.\nSo, with nothing much to do, Austin began to retreat into cultivation once again.\nThis time,\nhe intends to comprehend the thread of Wind Law Origin within his body, at least allowing his understanding of the Law of Wind to reach the level of his understanding of the Law of Thunder.\nOnly when the Wind and Thunder Dual Swords have roughly equal understanding of both laws will it prevent power imbalance and unleash even greater strength.",

      "content": "This time of retreat is mainly to enhance one's own power.\nApart from comprehending the Law of Wind, the elevation of one's own level is also essential.\nSince the last period of slumber ended, Austin's level of strength has been gradually and steadily increasing. Under the accumulation of a large quantity of magic resources collected by the Dragon Nest Beastmen, he has now reached the intermediate gold level.\nIntermediate gold level, Giant Dragon Bloodline, coupled with two strands of different law powers within the body, even when viewed across the entirety of Kawa Great Forest, Austin would not be considered weak.\nHowever, in the face of the imminent great battle, this is still not enough.\nThis retreat, besides comprehending the strand of Wind Law Origin, aiming to reach the level of comprehension of the Law of Thunder, Austin also plans to elevate his level beyond high-tier gold.\nFor the Giant Dragon Race, as long as there are ample magic resources, the elevation of levels naturally won't have any bottlenecks.\nAnd these vast magic resources rely on the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nInitially, Austin established the Clan forces not only for self-preservation but also so that when the Clan Tribe grows in the future, it can gather enough magic resources for him.\nNow, the Dragon Nest Tribe has undoubtedly become the dominant force in the area.\nWithin the legion, there are many formidable extraordinary beings, clearing some dangerous areas rich in magic and collecting the magic resources within is not a difficult task.\nCollecting magic resources, Austin can do that himself too.\nBut the process is too cumbersome and time-consuming.\nWith the powerful collection ability of the Clan Tribe, it just saves the trouble of searching within.\nAnd this also represents the beginning of the Dragon Nest Tribe gradually feeding back to Austin.\n...\nTime passes quickly, since Austin entered the mountain to comprehend the Wind Law Origin.\nIn the blink of an eye, more than a month has passed.\nAtop the cliff, Austin sits cross-legged on the peak, a vast shadow is cast from the sky, covering most of the canyon.\nAs the Dragon Nest Legion continually sweeps the surrounding dangerous areas, they collect various magic-containing herbs, ores, magic crystals, and so on, and send them to the valley where Austin is to support his growth and consumption.\nCurrently, Austin's level is nearing the pinnacle of intermediate gold level, about to break through to high-tier gold.\nLevel strength has received considerable enhancement.\nHowever, aiming to break through to high-tier gold, though Austin currently faces no bottleneck on his path ahead.\nTo achieve the transformation and enhancement, either he practices diligently and spends several years compressing and condensing the magic power within to naturally break through to high-tier gold.\nOr he acquires higher-level magic resources, and while digesting these higher-level magic resources, induces a qualitative change in his magic power.\nThe former takes a little longer for Austin now.\nAs for the latter, high-level magic resources are not currently collectible by the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"Ordinary magic ores and magic herbs are already ineffective for me now. It's best to have a half-legendary Magic Beast Crystal Core, or some core containing vast elemental power, although such existences at these levels are difficult to defeat, even for me, needless to say for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\"\nNot to mention how difficult it is to kill a half-legendary, these existences are rare in itself, and finding traces in the vast Kawa Great Forest is troublesome, with slim chances of discovering clues.\nIf things should go this way, maybe he really will need to spend several years slowly honing.\nSeveral years is merely like a quick nap for the long-lived dragon race.\nHowever, Austin ultimately isn't a pure dragon, he hardly ever sleeps. Just the thought of enduring several years makes him a bit uncomfortable.\n\"Forget it, let nature take its course then,\"\nIt's an unavoidable situation,\nhe can only hone while being watchful to see if any traces of half-legendary Lord of Magical Beasts or super magic ore veins, magic elemental convergence areas are present in the Kawa Great Forest.\nThis time of retreat, reaching the peak of intermediate gold level strength is just one of the gains.\nThe greatest harvest of this cultivation is still the comprehension of the Law of Wind.\nRelying on the strand of Wind Law Origin within, Austin has engaged in continuous comprehension for over a month, gaining insights into the Law of Wind equivalent to the Law of Thunder.\nAnd this also signifies a balance between the powers of the laws of wind and thunder.\nRepeatedly, due to the balance of the powers of the laws of wind and thunder, Austin has found the direction for the unification of Wind and Thunder Dual Swords to produce even more powerful forces.\nA year ago, by referencing the ninja anime from a past life, Austin successfully developed magic Rasengan using the interaction of spiritual power and magic power.\nAt the same time, referencing the nature change of chakra attributes in the anime, Austin also completed the attribute nature change of the magic Rasengan, and based on this, successfully completed the super invincible heaven-defying compressed Wind Water Thunder Rasengan.\nThat Rasengan which destroyed the Zombie Undead Nest and the huge pyramid, is precisely the result of the fusion of wind, water, and thunder three attributes of magic power!\nDuring the process of creating that Rasengan, Austin also gained considerable experience and insights in integrating wind, water, and thunder three attributes' powers.\nNow, relying on past insights into attribute fusion, Austin has found the direction to merge wind and thunder two forces into one.\nThe unification of Wind and Thunder Dual Swords seems to have seen a glimmer of hope.\nOf course, it is merely the direction, the road to success is still very far-reaching.\nAfter all, law-level forces, despite only being a strand, in essence, they have surpassed the simple attribute powers.\n\"Although the unification of Wind and Thunder Dual Swords hasn't been developed successfully, my strength has at least increased by thirty percent!\"\nAfter sorting out the gains from this retreat cultivation, Austin is clear-hearted, and has a rough estimation of his own strength.\nMoreover, as his comprehension of wind elements deepens, Austin, relying on some experience and knowledge from a past life, coupled with his current situation, has developed a rather famous auxiliary skill.\nDownwind Ear.\nJust like a certain deity in the celestial court from mythology, by relying on the ability of wind attribute elements, Austin can greatly enhance his own hearing.\nDue to deliberate cultivation, Austin's mastery of his magic has reached a fine hair-like degree of refinement.\nAfterward, leveraging this precise magic control and the fourth domain-type talent magic, Austin successfully simplified and merged talent magic to form a rudimentary domain of his own.\nWind aids the propagation of sound.\nDue to this principle, Austin by combining his magical fine-scale operations within the rudimentary domain scope, as long as there is a hint of wind element anywhere, he can clearly hear the sounds transmitted from there.",

      "content": "Relying on the power of wind, Austin gained the ability similar to the Downwind Ear.\nAnd based on this, he had some ideas for extending his abilities.\nIf wind can amplify those subtle sounds, allowing him to hear from afar, could it be used in reverse to eliminate his own sounds, reducing the noise of his actions to the smallest possible degree?\nSilent Domain!\nBy using wind elements to completely erase the sounds he generates, creating a silent area, perhaps this could achieve unexpected effects when combined with Downwind Ear for espionage in the future.\nMoreover, in the One Piece anime, powerful sword masters can hear the breathing among all things, thus discovering the enemy's weakness and ultimately severing them in one strike.\nSo, can the power extending from this ability ultimately expand to such an extent, to listen to the opponent's weaknesses, similar to the effect of Observation-style Dominance, and see through the enemy's attack openings in battle?\n\"An interesting technique, but with this approach, the fighting style seems to be somewhat off track.\"\nAustin was momentarily troubled.\nAustin is never short of ideas, and with ideas comes direction for developing power.\nBut if he built his own power system based on all kinds of ideas, it seems a bit odd in this world.\nOther giant dragons either rely on a strong and unparalleled physical body or various Forbidden Curse Magic to deal with enemies.\nBut when it comes to himself, first it's Thunder Forging Body, followed by Electromagnetic Cannon, and then Rasengan and Law Flying Sword; carrying a flying sword to slash his enemies wasn't enough, now comes the Dual Swords Unification.\nFacing those mage warriors of the world, this style seems quite out of place.\n\"Never mind, whether it's a black cat or a white cat, if it catches mice, it's a good cat. At least these advanced techniques based on ideas are far more powerful than the completely useless Talent Magic abilities I had.\"\nAustin immersed himself in his heart spirit, beginning to test the Downwind Ear he'd developed.\nThreads of magic power slowly spread into the void, as the prototype domain simplified from the fourth Talent Magic silently expanded to cover a range of several miles.\nThe wind elements, like elves, danced in the air, Austin seemingly able to sense the emotions of those elves.\nWithin the covered land, sounds echoed, and the originally dissipating vibrations in the air were transmitted to Austin's ears through the power of wind elements.\nThe cacophony of noises surged into Austin's ears in an instant, the sounds of the world he was in!\nAfter a long period of time, Austin finally adapted.\nAmongst the myriad of sounds, he could focus on the ones he wanted.\n\"So this is the world of sound...\"\nWith his heart spirit wandering in this ocean of sound, Austin couldn't help but feel a sense of awe.\nUtilizing the ability of wind attribute elements, like a combination of amplifier and transmitter, Austin heard countless faint sounds from afar.\nThrough this other means of perceiving the world, it had a much more novel experience and understanding.\nMoreover, this ability might be extended for eavesdropping on information from miles away.\nJust as he was about to exit this state, Austin's eyebrow twitched.\nHe heard some conversational voices.\n\"Is that the tribe established by the Blue Young Dragon?\"\n\"It should be. Being able to repeatedly cause major losses to those guys from the Blood Claw Tribe, even taking down the first warrior of the tribe, only such an existence can establish such a foundation in this wilderness.\"\n\"Blood Claw, those guys are part of the alliance, could it be that the Blue Young Dragon might vent its anger on the alliance? The elders' alliance plan might be in jeopardy.\"\n\"It doesn't matter whether the Blue Young Dragon is willing to ally or not; regardless of the response, naturally the elders will worry about that. We're just the messengers.\"\n\"Look, are those planted fields, where did this dragon learn these things?\"\n\"These must be planted with kudzu roots. Wow, so many!\"\n\"Impressive. No wonder the Blue Young Dragon's clan tribe can expand so quickly. That's why.\"\n\"Perhaps, we could tell the elders, see if we can exchange for these farming techniques from the Blue Young Dragon.\"\n\"Hey, if that Blue Young Dragon dies in the counterattack war, then all these things along with his clan tribe will belong to us...\"\nSubsequent voices became quieter, as if discussing some conspiracy.\nHowever, no matter how cautious they were, their words still reached Austin's ears without missing a beat.\n\"Alliance? These are people from the Tribe Alliance?\"\nFrom those voices, Austin guessed.\nIt should be. According to their conversation, it seems the war is about to begin, and the Tribe Alliance seems to have sent people to form an alliance with him, implying that they want him to join the counterattack war.\nThis suggests that the situation in Kawa Great Forest has reached a certain level.\n\"Let's go take a look first.\"\nUnexpectedly, the first time using the Downwind Ear technique, he heard such an event.\nThose Tribe Alliance messengers probably didn't realize their dark thoughts had been heard word for word by Austin.\nHa, still trying to plot against me?\nDetermined, Austin immediately took flight towards the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n...\nThe arrival of the Tribe Alliance messengers didn't cause any ripples within the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAs those messengers approached the Dragon Nest Tribe, they were received in advance by Vini, as informed by Austin.\nAfterward, the beastman messengers were ushered into the main hall.\nWithin the main hall, no one knew what Austin discussed with the beastman messengers.\nIt's only known that after half a day of talks in the main hall, the Tribe Alliance messengers left the Dragon Nest Tribe with somewhat unpleasant expressions.\nAnd their departure did not cause any ripples within the Dragon Nest Tribe either; the Dragon Nest Beastmen were busy with grand expansion projects, who had the mind to pay attention to them?\nFrom above, Austin coldly watched the direction in which the Tribe Alliance messengers left, sneering inwardly.\nHe was already clear on much of the background of this war.\nIn this contest that might even involve the divine, did they really think he was a fool who could be so easily fooled into becoming cannon fodder?\nThe legacy of the Beastman Empire, just hearing the name indicates its significance.\nRather than getting involved in this terrifying war that even the legendary may not survive, it's better to lie low in the Dragon's Nest, growing stronger and developing stealthily. After all, this place is remote; hiding for decades or even a hundred years and achieving great success in divine skills before venturing out again isn't impossible.\n\"Vini, how's the tribe recently?\"\nIn a month's time, the Dragon Nest Tribe has become even stronger.\nThe thousand extraordinary beastmen Austin transformed before his closed-door cultivation had already been trained into formidable combat power.\nThe military strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe has significantly improved.\nAt the same time, raids on external beastman tribes have been ongoing, resulting in a rapid increase in the tribe's population.\nEverything is developing in a positive direction.\nThe power of the clan tribe is steadily rising, like a large tree growing robustly, extending its towering branches towards the sky.\nHowever, not all development within the Dragon Nest Tribe has been smooth; just recently, one development plan encountered troubles.\nAnd significant troubles at that.\n\"Your Highness, during the establishment of the second stronghold, the advance team suffered a severe blow, nearly completely wiped out.\"\nRecalling the incident, Vini's complexion also showed a lingering sense of fear.\nObviously, he should have personally participated in the establishment of the second stronghold.\n\"What happened?\"\nAustin frowned slightly. Given the current strength of the Dragon's Nest Tribe, how could they have nearly been wiped out?\n\"Elemental Lord, a very powerful Elemental Lord!\"",

      "content": "\"Elemental Lord? Aren't elemental creatures supposed to stay in the Elemental Plane? Why would they appear in this kind of place?\"\nUpon hearing Vini's words, Austin was clearly a bit puzzled.\nElemental creatures are magical beings formed purely from magic elements.\nTheir bodies, structure, and even bones are composed of a single element.\nThese creatures, completely at odds with the Prime Material Plane, are irritable and aggressive, attacking any living being that appears before them.\nSuch creatures should not appear on the Prime Material Plane.\nIn fact, they aren't naturally occurring beings in the Prime Material Plane.\nElemental life forms are born in the Elemental Plane, where the entire plane is composed of singular magic elements; it is their birth and survival world.\nJust like fish and water,\nelemental creatures are the same. Appearing in the Prime Material Plane is akin to fish leaving water and appearing on land.\nOf course, elemental creatures, relying on their formidable strength, can transform an area of the Prime Material Plane into a place where they can sustain their presence, which is a lot better than fish dying upon leaving water.\nHowever, in the Prime Material Plane, the suppression they endure does not decrease at all, and they can only display a fraction of their power.\nTherefore, the Prime Material Plane holds no attraction for elemental creatures; instead, it is full of disdain.\nGiven such an environment, why did the Elemental Lord appear in the Kawa Great Forest?\n\"I don't know. At first, we designated an area to the east on the map as the site of our second outpost, so we dispatched an advance team to explore it. They found the area had transformed from forest to an endless volcanic region.\"\n\"The advance team decided to investigate the volcanic region, but didn't get far before they were suddenly attacked by a group of flame-men humanoid creatures. Most of the team perished inside, leaving only a few members who barely escaped and couldn't bring back their comrades' bodies.\"\n\"Due to this incident, I led a hundred newly trained extraordinary troops to the volcanic region. At the very least, we needed to retrieve the bodies of the advance team.\"\n\"Following the guidance of the remaining advance team members, we found the area where the battle occurred, but there was nothing there, just some charred marks on the ground. We had no idea what happened to the bodies left behind.\"\n\"Finally, we decided to continue moving forward.\"\n\"On one side was the forest, on the other side was the volcano; dark red magma flowed through the cracks, and fire-red thorn trees flourished on the scorching land, with some creatures navigating through that massive fiery area.\"\n\"In a low red bush near the volcano, we encountered the fire-men humanoid creatures the advance team spoke of. Fortunately, this time, the party consisted of extraordinary beastmen above Bronze Level Middle Tier, and after paying a certain price, the army defeated the enemy.\"\n\"Initially, we thought everything was over; however,\"\nVini's face showed pain and fear as he spoke.\n\"The scorching earth suddenly trembled, and a nearby volcano erupted violently, spewing vast magma into the sky, transforming into a rain of meteor magma that fell from high altitude.\"\nPain and self-reproach shone on Vini's face.\n\"The magma exploded, and flames spread, turning the entire world into a sea of fire, even setting the earth itself aflame.\"\n\"Casualties were heavy; over half of the hundred extraordinary troops perished, and most of the rest were seriously injured, barely escaping.\"\n\"Before leaving the volcano region, we saw within the rising and overwhelming smoke a colossal flame figure glimpsed, claws outstretched, and the intense heat distorted the surrounding space.\"\n\"Returning to the tribe, Adinlek deduced that the humanoid creatures that attacked the advance team were likely fire elemental creatures, and the last apparition was probably the Fire Elemental Lord.\"\nAfter Vini recounted the Dragon Nest's major setback to Austin, Austin fell into contemplation.\nElemental creatures absolutely wouldn't appear on the Prime Material Plane without reason.\nEven if a connection emerged between an Elemental Plane and the Prime Material Plane, elemental creatures wouldn't cross over due to their dislike for the environment there.\nUnless there is some irresistible reason forcing them to linger nearby.\nFor example, some Great Divine Power Users who can traverse the multi-universe often like to capture elemental creatures from an Elemental Plane to keep at home, since elemental life is useful for purifying and concentrating the air's magic elements.\nUnder the influence of such irresistible man-made force, even if elemental life prefers not the environment of the Prime Material Plane, it can only become machines for purifying and concentrating magic power.\nBut if, as Vini described, a forest land area was transformed into an unending volcanic territory, this kind of result doesn't seem human-caused.\n\"I must see it with my own eyes and find out the cause!\"\nThe change might affect Austin and his clan tribe development, so he had to ensure it himself.\nThe Elemental Lord might have a magic power-concentrating item that could allow him to undergo transformation and quickly reach the Gold High Tier stage.\nDanger may also be an opportunity.\nAfter staying a while in the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin took off and left the bustling tribe.\nBecause it was an investigation, Austin did not bring other beastmen, and headed alone toward the eastern volcanic area.\nUpon arriving at the destination, Austin's first feeling was heat.\nEven from afar, seeing the red earth on the horizon, he felt the overwhelming heatwaves.\nFire attribute elements were extremely concentrated in the vast volcanic area, causing the air to seem ready to ignite.\nThis was undoubtedly not a natural occurrence.\nNo one knew what ultimately caused this volcanic region.\n\"Is this the place?\"\nOn the edge of the volcano-forest boundary, Austin landed on a hill, marveling at the green-red wondrous landscape below.\nThe green earth was an endless forest.\nThe red earth consisted of abundantly burned soil and sparse dark-red thorny bushes covering it.\nThe resilience of life allowed it to tenaciously grow even in such scorching arid volcanic territory.\nThe boundary of soil with red and green seemed to divide the sky world in half.\n\"A strange place.\"\nAfter pondering for a moment, Austin spread his wings and flew toward the depths of the volcanic region.",

      "content": "In the air, the free-floating Fire Elements are especially abundant, creating a volcanic terrain right in this vast expanse of the Kawa Great Forest.\nAustin randomly chose a volcano and landed on its edge, which was covered with black volcanic rock formed by the solidification of molten magma.\nBeside him, a dark red ravine snaked down from the volcano's summit, with scorching magma slowly flowing through it. Even at a distance of ten meters, Austin could feel the wave of heat hitting him.\nYet even in such a dry and scorching volcanic environment, amidst the black volcanic rocks around, there still grew scattered, entirely red, incredibly resilient plants.\n\"Truly wondrous.\"\nIn Austin's previous life, most active volcanic craters were barren, let alone those extremely active volcanoes frequently flowing with dark red lava, ready to erupt at any moment.\nBut in this world, there are actually plants that can adapt to such intensely hot environments and survive under these harsh conditions.\nAustin opened his sharp claws and dug into the hard volcanic ground, soon revealing several bright-colored metals among the shattered rocks.\nRefined Gold, Mithril, and various other unknown metal minerals.\nAustin went on to survey several more volcanoes, finding that the metal minerals embedded in the rocks varied somewhat, but the difference was negligible!\nThis realization led Austin to understand that this volcanic area was like a gigantic treasure trove.\n\"The minerals are so rich; this is practically a super-large gold mine!\"\nSuch a wealthy deposit, and this vast volcanic region stretches endlessly; if humans knew about it, they would probably immediately launch a frenzied march towards it in Central Earth.\nHowever, while this volcanic area is a very wealthy aggregation of Refined Gold and Mithril, these riches would only truly become valuable as wealth in the Human World.\nIn this Kawa Great Forest, even if Refined Gold, Mithril, and other metal deposits were extracted, they were just a heap of stones that couldn't be eaten or drunk.\n\"For the time being, these riches are of no use to the Dragon Nest Tribe, at least for now.\"\nAustin wasn't dazzled by the wealth before him and continued to delve deeper.\nSo many minerals, plus these endless volcanoes.\nIt can basically be confirmed that this volcanic area has intersected with the magma layer beneath the earth, maintaining a constant eruption of lava, while also heavily saturated with Fire Attribute Elements.\nThis made Austin all the more curious.\nWas this environment naturally formed, or was it the result of Elemental Creatures remodeling the surroundings after their arrival?\nAfter pondering for a moment, Austin in the sky closed his eyes and sank into his Heart Spirit.\nThe Domain prototype was fully opened, beginning a thorough search within the volcanic area.\n\"Hmm? Where have the Elemental creatures hidden?\"\nEnveloping an area of several miles, various subtle sounds and movements were amplified in his mind.\nYet, within the entire Domain, there was only an empty space, with occasionally one or two Fire Attribute animals running around, but no trace of Elemental creatures.\nAfter a moment of thought, Austin suddenly realized.\nHe had thought wrong. To Fire Elemental creatures, the Prime Material Plane is like an unbearably filthy sewer.\nDespite this remodeled volcanic region, with a large concentration of Fire Attribute Magic Power in one place, the outside world still feels highly unpleasant. How could they roam around patrolling outside all the time?\nThose Fire Elements should be staying in places more comfortable for them, while also being able to immediately sense when a creature accidentally enters their domain.\nAustin contemplated for a while and made a guess.\nThose Fire Elements are probably hiding underground, or rather inside the volcano, within the magma channels.\nBy residing underneath in the magma layer, they can avoid contact with the Prime Material Plane, and if anyone passes above, the sound would transmit to the magma, causing a large number of Elemental creatures to emerge from their nests.\nThis must be it, and Austin decided to test his theory.\nHe descended from the sky and stomped hard a few times on the rigid volcanic rock, causing the surrounding mountain peaks to shiver, stones cascading from the top, and the mountain body nearly collapsing.\nCalm and composed, Austin maintained his stomping stance.\nNot long after,\n\"Hiss!\"\nAn angry hiss suddenly echoed as the flowing lava around the volcano's cracked surface began to churn, and then flames spontaneously appeared in the air, gradually forming into solid shapes, eventually becoming humanoid fiery beings.\nThey were the Fire Elements!\nLife forms born of pure Elemental stars!\n\"Roar!\"\nAmidst sharp roars, hundreds of Fire Elements started charging directly at Austin.\nMeanwhile, more Fire Elements continued to leap forth from the lava cracks, joining the assault on Austin.\nReaching over a thousand in number, they rushed like a Flame Storm, surging from all directions, seemingly intent on engulfing Austin completely.\nAmong the roaring flames, Austin's figure remained unshaken in the slightest.\n\"Too weak.\"\nAustin shook his head slightly.\nWith a thought, bolts of lightning burst out of thin air, shining bright, forming clawing beams of lightning that struck out in all directions.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nThe arm-thick blue lasers swept across, resembling pulsing longswords, causing each Fire Element to explode and shatter under the lightning, tearing apart and blossoming into firework-like sparks before dissipating entirely.\nIn an instant, the hundreds of thousands of surging Fire Elements were mostly swept away by the lightning, with the remaining ones frozen in place, no longer daring to approach further.\nThe Fire Elements may have low intelligence but not low survival instincts. Seeing their numerous companions so easily annihilated, none dared to take another step forward.\nAs the blue lightning around him faded, the surrounding surface of volcanic rock was left in tatters, with stones cracked and crumbling.\nAs the dust settled, the remaining Fire Elements, witnessing their many companions being obliterated with ease, dared not linger any longer, scattering in all directions.\nAustin ignored those who slipped through the net, picking up a broken Crystal Core that resembled a Red Crystal from the ground to examine it carefully.\nThis was the Crystal Core left behind after destroying a Fire Element, and there were many more scattered on the pitted ground around him.\nThese should be the core essences of the Fire Elemental creatures.\nJust like the Magic Beast Crystal Core within a Magic Beast, they are critical for sustaining life and exerting power, though compared to Magic Beast Crystal Cores, these Elemental Crystal Cores have more concentrated and purer Magic Elements.",

      "content": "\"The magic power here is much purer and stronger than the Magic Beast Crystal Core.\"\nPlacing the Elemental Core of the deceased Fire Elemental on his claw, he delicately felt the power condensed within it.\nThese Fire Elementals only had power roughly at the Bronze Level, relying on their own burning flames for close combat, yet their cores harbored magic energy that reached Middle Tier to High Tier of Bronze Level.\nThis is truly astounding.\n\"It must be the suppressive effect of the Prime Material Plane.\"\nThe Prime Material Plane wasn't very friendly to these Elemental Lives.\nProlonged contact with the outside world could lead to the \"pollution\" of their pure Magic Elements, not to mention their power exerted within the Prime Material Plane was only about thirty or forty percent of that in the Elemental Plane.\nTruly unfortunate.\n\"Though their power is weak, the sheer number is overwhelming.\"\nAustin let out a long sigh, unsure of how to react to the scene before him.\nKnocking back the attacking Fire Elementals earlier did not make them retreat; instead, more Fire Elementals gathered to surround him.\nThey came for revenge!\nThousands of Fire Elementals turned the surrounding land into a burning Sea of Fire, the scorching heat distorting the air.\nMeanwhile, from the mouths of volcanoes and cracks filled with magma, Fire Elementals continued to emerge and join the army surrounding Austin.\nHow expansive is the Sea of Fire comprised of surrounding Fire Elementals now?\nIt's impossible to count.\nThe numbers rise to thousands, touching the ground, reaching the sky; if it exceeds ten thousand, it becomes boundless.\nNow Austin is engulfed by an endless Sea of Fire Elementals.\nAt the same time, among the infinite Sea of Fire Elements, some elite Fire Elementals—larger than usual ones—roared angrily at Austin.\nThese elite Fire Elementals are quite numerous; roughly one in every hundred is an elite Fire Elemental, with energy fluctuations at about the Silver Level.\n\"Such a large number seems more like a Fire Elemental Race.\"\nAustin appeared somewhat puzzled; initially, he thought this area was an ancient site left by a Great Divine Power User who could traverse the Multi-universe.\nDue to some reasons, the Fire Elementals inside ran out, eventually forming this vast Volcanic Cluster Domain.\nYet now it seems that is not the case.\nBecause it is a complete Fire Elemental Race, which is far different from the Elemental Life captured and imprisoned by Great Divine Power Users for personal decoration; they would only capture powerful Fire Elementals to transform their environment, not bring along so many weaker ones.\nSo where does this Volcanic Cluster Domain and the multitude of Fire Elementals come from?\nWhile Austin was pondering, accompanied by a fierce roar from a Fire Elemental General—a stature even greater than elite ones like a Flame Demon composed of golden lava—\nIn an instant, the entire Sea of Fire Elements began to move, countless Fire Elements charged at Austin.\nThe overwhelming force seemed to obliterate everything in its way.\nFacing the terrifying sight of the tumultuous sea of flames surging towards him, Austin's heart trembled slightly, then he felt a sense of relief.\nEarlier Vini and others were also besieged, likely only at the periphery, not arousing such a massive commotion of Fire Elements.\nIf they had gone as deep as he did into this level of Fire Elemental Sea, not a single person would have managed to escape.\n\"This quantity of Fire Elemental creatures, plus their burning nature, might make even a Great Warrior at the golden peak struggle to survive an overpowering siege.\"\nAustin silently strategized, meanwhile spreading his wings, creating a mighty burst of air, soaring his massive form upward.\n\"Fortunately, I'm different.\"\nWatching Austin ascend to the sky, the surrounding charging Fire Elements seemed stunned, staring blankly at the sky.\nMeanwhile, elite Fire Elements and Elemental Generals fired fireballs angrily at Austin in the sky, only for the fireballs to be torn and shattered by the gusts generated by him before reaching.\nLooking at the tumultuous Sea of Fire below, Austin suddenly felt a distinct pride.\nKind of like,\nHehe, I enjoy the sight of you wanting to attack me, yet feeling powerless.\nAustin soared across the sky, each flight over a spot agitated the Fire Elemental army below, leading one to question whether they'd explode from anger.\nAfter circling a few rounds like this.\n\"Alright, now that I've had enough fun, let me grant you a farewell.\"\nAustin suddenly paused in the sky, wings spread wide, resembling a massive cross suspended high.\nBoom!!!\nAmid deafening thunder, arcs of electricity shot out in all directions.\nSimultaneously, this eternally clear sky suddenly greeted with a rare thick cloud.\nThe dense cloud layers roaring above seemed to wrap over the entire heavens.\nA massive hurricane swept through the world, accompanied by thunderous roars, seemingly heralding an apocalypse.\nThe Fire Elemental army clearly felt uneasy, looking at the clouds and lightning above, they became restless.\nAmong the Fire Elemental army, the tallest and most fierce Elemental General appeared hesitant,\nYet before it could decide,\nThe judgment had already arrived!\nThunderstorm Storm!\nBoom!!!\nAmid earth-shaking blasts, thousands of bolts of lightning erupted across the sky, arcs of fire and light unfurled, transforming the sky beneath the clouds into a magnificent sea of lightning.\nBut it wasn't over!\nInstantly, among the thousands of lightning strikes in the heavens, a single bolt struck from the sky, piercing through all realms, obliterating a large swath of Fire Elements in one blow.\nThis was just the beginning,\nWith the first bolt of lightning, the second, third... countless bolts struck down within moments, the blinding lightning turning the entire area into a Thunderstorm field.\nBoom boom boom...\nContinuous thunderous blasts annihilated Fire Elements one by one under the furious lightning, the speed of the strikes deprived them of escape, clearing swathes effectively.\nThis fierce Thunderstorm endured for quite a while before ceasing entirely, leaving the volcanic grounds below full of pits and fissured volcanic rock.\nNumerous cores left by the slain Fire Elements, like Red Crystals, littered the ground.\nThroughout this Thunderstorm, the entire Fire Elemental army was nearly wiped out, with only a few elite Fire Elements barely surviving, heavily injured, their flames dimmed.",

      "content": "The army of fire elements, numbering tens of thousands, capable of encircling and killing high-tier golden warriors, was thus annihilated by nine-tenths.\nThis is the power of the law!\nIn the face of the legendary, numbers basically become meaningless.\nAlthough Austin's own level is now only at the peak of middle-tier gold, a distant leap from the legendary realm, he has long awakened a trace of the law origin of thunder and has reached a certain level of understanding of the thunder law.\nRelying on the power of the law, Austin directly induced the riot of thunder elements within the prototype of the domain, coupled with his own talent magic, achieving such a large-scale thunderstorm attack.\n\"This time, it should come out.\"\nAustin glanced down at the battlefield, no longer paying attention, instead focusing on the surrounding volcanoes spewing dark red lava.\nHe was waiting for the appearance of the elemental lord that Vini and others had once glimpsed in a flash!\nFire elemental life is subjected to severe suppression and weakening in this Prime Material Plane, its strength probably only about three or four tenths of its peak period, but from Vini's description, that revealed strength was enough to shock.\nAccording to Austin's speculation, the fire elemental lord hidden beneath layers of volcanic veins is likely to have one foot stepped into the legendary.\nIf he can kill it, the energy gathered in its elemental core will surely reach unimaginable levels.\nIf he can devour such a core, the magic power within Austin will surely undergo a transformation, entering the level of high-tier gold in one leap, elevating his strength dramatically.\nMoreover, even merely stepping into the legendary domain involves understanding the existence of law, Austin might be able to devour a new law origin, mastering new law capabilities.\nThe trace of wind law origin devoured last time, although caused Austin quite a bit of trouble initially, after devouring and refining it, his strength improved dramatically.\nThis soaring strength made Austin slightly addicted.\n\"If it was in the Elemental Plane, or facing another normal half-legendary, I would turn and leave without hesitation, but unfortunately, you came to the Prime Material Plane where your strength is significantly weakened, making it the best time to hunt.\"\nAustin's eyes flickered, vigilantly watching the volcano below, waiting for the fire elemental lord to appear.\nThis was the reason he came here to investigate.\nLiving in a place like the Kawa Great Forest, especially with a war sweeping across the Barbaric Territory looming, no one can ignore an opportunity to rapidly enhance their strength.\nMoreover, it's a severely weakened half-legendary, offering a great chance to crush it.\nEarlier,\nAustin was scouring the surroundings to find the traces of the fire elemental lord.\nOtherwise, does one really think he was showing off his flight capabilities in front of these low-intelligent fire elemental creatures?\nHumph,\nBeing smug among a group of fire elements,\nAustin could not possibly be such a shallow dragon.\nIt's just a pity, the fire elemental lord hid too well, Austin flew and searched within tens of miles without discovering the hiding place of the fire elemental lord.\nThus,\nLeft with no choice, Austin launched this thunderstorm attack, slaughtering many fire element creatures to compel the irritable elemental lord to reveal itself.\n\"It's coming!\"\nSuddenly, Austin sensed the fire element concentration in the air rapidly rising, as if the surrounding air was about to ignite.\nAt the same time, an oppressive feeling rose from beneath the ground, like a volcano suppressed for millions of years, about to erupt!\nAustin immediately soared into the sky, heading higher.\nHigher, he wanted to reach higher ground!\nBoom!!!\nSuddenly, a thunderous loud noise erupted from the ground, like the earth veins splitting, the ground covered by black volcanic rock suddenly collapsed, huge rock fragments shattered, dark red lava welled up from the web-like cracks, swallowing the hovering black volcanic rock.\nSwoosh swoosh swoosh...\nBlazing flames soared up, turning the entire ground into a lake of magma in an instant, like a huge bleeding scar on the earth.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nAccompanied by an ear-splitting roar, blazing sonic waves erupted, repelling the air.\nThe rolling bubbling magma surged violently, stretching and twisting like a living creature in the high air, coalescing into a lava giant over twenty meters tall!\nThe lava giant's blood-red eyes gazed at the sky, the magma flowing on its body like molten wax, the red flames stretching out in the air, forming a towering fire tree.\n\"This is...\"\nSeeing the giant below, Austin's pupil shrank suddenly.\nFrom the lava giant, he felt an overwhelming sense of suffocation!\nHalf-step legendary!\nAlthough not stepped into the legendary realm, the lava giant already possessed part of the legendary level's might!\nThe fire elemental lord had finally appeared!\n\"Great!\"\nAt this moment, a trace of excitement and frenzy flashed in Austin's solemn eyes.\nSure enough, his assumption was correct, even in the Prime Material Plane, the half-legendary fire elemental lord was subjected to severe suppression.\nAnd this gave him a chance to hunt this terrifying creature.\n\"Come on, let me see your weight.\"\nWithout waiting for the lava giant to move, Austin took the initiative, manipulating spiritual power to drive magic power to expand and spread in the void, transforming the surrounding space into his domain.\nWhoosh!\nUnder the gloomy sky, the space in front of him suddenly twisted, turning into giant vortices as if the space itself twisted together.\nVast magic power surged from his body, gathering in front of the vortices under the trend of spiritual power, swiftly spinning to eventually form translucent, differently colored, yet shiver-inducing attribute Rasengan!\nFive Rasengan spanned in the high air before him, their terrifying might seemed to impact the surrounding void, faintly causing imperceptible tremors and distortions.\n\"Go!\"\nAustin's wings suddenly flapped, stirring up a huge gale between heaven and earth, five immensely powerful attribute Rasengan trailing long tails of flame, crashing down like meteors.\nAt that moment, the skies seemed to darken, the entire sky pressing down as if with the fall of the five Rasengan.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nThe fire elemental lord roared furiously, angry flames rising.\nThis flying lizard, not only does it not flee, it dares to fight back, simply the greatest provocation!",

solar-like rings rose from the flat ground, stirring waves and surges in the surrounding void, with a terrifying tearing force that seemed capable of shattering even magma.\nStorms, thunder, floods.\nVarious horrifying natural disasters swept across a range of hundreds of meters, bolts of lightning shot out, hurricanes lifted magic power-transformed water by the hundreds of tons, turning

red glow.\nHum Hum Hum!\nInitially just a speck of light, it erupted in an instant, as the dark red lava burned in a flame storm and swept toward the sky, incinerating all the lightning, hurricanes,

above, his massive wings rolled with force, the Wind Attribute Elements beneath him stirred a vast gale, and his enormous figure swiftly vanished in midair like a chain of afterimages.\nSimultaneously, as a ring of dark red light bloomed from the Lava Giant's body, the fire elements in the volcanic area within miles were densely accumulated, producing extremely strong fluctuations.\nMeteor Sky Burst!\nMagma spheres with diameters of meters suddenly plummeted from the sky, breaking through layers of clouds, leaving long fiery tails as they launched a comprehensive

ground.\nWith the help of Wind Element, Austin's speed reached its peak, a series of afterimages darted evasively in the air, dodging the dense meteor rain assault.\nThe Fire Elemental Lord's animosity toward Austin was clearly at its zenith, as the surrounding void's Fire Attribute Elements boiled like a sea, wherever Austin appeared was immediately besieged like a storm, turning the surrounding soil and earth into a sea of molten lava.\nThis relentless bombardment continued for quite a while until the Lava Giant withdrew a large amount of Elemental Power, the flames on its body dimmed considerably, before it paused to catch its breath.\nAt this moment,\n\"Opportunity!\"\nThe previously fleeing Austin keenly detected the stiffness in the Lava Giant when it ceased the scope of its forbidden curse-like magic.\nA critical opportunity!\nSeizing the moment it became stiff, Austin decisively used his long-concealed trump card.\nBuzz!\nAs Austin soared in the sky and opened his mouth, a vast, grand, ocean-like pressure descended suddenly, like the dawn's sun illuminating the entire world.\nThe Lava Giant instinctively sensed danger, about to react within its rigid state.\nHowever, at this moment, Death God had already arrived!\nThe Wind and Thunder Swords, nurtured and honed with momentum magic power for over a month, finally unsheathed at this moment.\nTwo tiny ripples flashed and disappeared in the void, then split open suddenly, two streams penetrated through layers of void, abruptly arriving beside the Lava Giant.\nThis is the power of the Law of Wind and Law of Thunder.\nNo elaborate or beautiful techniques, just a simple straightforward stab.\nYet this Law-level attack made the Lava Giant turn pale, feeling the descent of a terrifying death crisis!\nSlash!\nIn an instant, two enormous holes appeared on the Lava Giant, towering over twenty meters.\nLooking through from one side, you could see the sky through the two giant apertures on the Lava Giant.\nThe two massive round holes connected, almost cutting the Lava Giant in half!\nSoar!\nThe two Law Divine Swords vanished like ripples in the wind, instantly returning to Austin's body.\nGazing at the imposing Lava Giant before him, Austin's pupils contracted sharply.\n\"This is!\"\nThrough the two large apertures on the Lava Giant's body, Austin saw a goblin-sized figure, its entire body ablaze with dazzling white flames, embedded within the Lava Giant's torso.\nElemental Lord!\nThis should be the true form of the Elemental Lord, the awe-inspiring Lava Giant outside was merely a guise draped over it!\nThough relying on the Lava Giant's shell, the Elemental Lord narrowly avoided a fatal blow at the last moment, it was still severely injured by Austin's two Law Divine Swords that were nurtured for over a month, and the white flames on its body dimmed.\nA chance not to be missed!\nAustin immediately flapped his wings, flying toward the waning Lava Giant's Elemental Lord, a giant Rasengan flickered with ghostly blue light beneath his claws, aiming for the exposed Fire Elemental Lord's final strike.\nBut at this moment,\nCrash!\nSeveral-meter-tall Fire Elemental Generals leaped out from the sea of lava below, blocking Austin's path.\nFor Fire Attribute Elements, they are immune to all Fire Attribute damage and can convert it to their life value, so the previous Meteor Sky Burst unleashed by the Lava Giant didn't harm them.\nThese Fire Elemental Generals, with energy levels roughly around Gold Level, fought desperately to block Austin's advance, sacrificing to buy time for the Elemental Lord!",

      "content": "\"Get out of the way!\"\nThe massive Thunder Rasengan spun rapidly under the claws, and the resulting voltage caused the surrounding void to crack with lightning.\nRumble!\nAustin wielded the Thunder Rasengan, tearing through the void, with bolts of electricity sweeping across, unleashing terrifying destructive power. Even the Gold Level Fire Elementals of general grade couldn't withstand the laser-like electric beams ripping through space, turning to ash in moments!\nHowever, these Gold Level Fire Elementals of general grade did manage to slow Austin's advance.\nJust as Austin's momentum was hindered, dark red lava flowed over the Molten Giant's body, and a circle of red light suddenly burst forth, sweeping and scouring the surrounding space.\nAustin, who had been advancing rapidly, suddenly felt a pressure descend, and space seemed to pause for a moment.\nInstinctively, he wanted to dodge, but the target of the explosive red light wasn't him, but the Fire Element creatures gathered around the Molten Giant!\nBang bang bang...\nIn a continuous series of thunderous rumbles, hundreds and thousands of Fire Elements around the Molten Giant instantly exploded, even the Fire Element generals blocking Austin could not escape the fate of explosion, disintegrating into masses of pure Fire Elemental Energy.\nAt the same time, the pieces of crystal cores left after the Fire Element explosion, glinting red and containing potent Fire Elements, shattered completely, transforming into a large amount of tangible Fire Element energy, spreading throughout the surrounding space.\nSimultaneously, a tremendously powerful invisible suction force emanated from the Molten Giant, causing large quantities of Fire Elements to be absorbed into its body like a vortex, forming an immense fiery vortex around.\nAll of this happened in the blink of an eye,\nWhen the massive Flame Storm formed by Fire Elements was absorbed completely, the two large holes on the Molten Giant's body restored as if time had reversed.\nSimultaneously, the previously enfeebled aura of the Molten Giant was completely restored, even giving Austin a feeling of being stronger than before!\nGo!\nUpon seeing this scene, Austin decisively hurled the Thunder Rasengan beneath his claws towards the Molten Giant.\nWith a powerful flap of the membranous wings, aided by the Wind Element, his entire body ascended straight up, drawing a huge arc in the air, darting away.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nThe Molten Giant roared, its voice visibly shaking the heavens.\nWatching as the Thunder Rasengan descended with rolling thunder, it raised its dark red fist, flowing with tons of magma, and punched forward into the void.\nBoom!!!\nThe very air seemed to burn through and melt, as massive magma erupted in an instant, carrying intense heat energy, at an incredibly rapid speed like a giant beast opening its mouth, swallowing the incoming Thunder Rasengan in an instant.\nGulu!\nEnormous quantities of scorching magma spread over the descending Thunder Rasengan, engulfing it completely.\nAlong with the muffled sound of thunder reverberating within the liquid, the giant Molten Giant Fist, which doubled in size after swallowing the Thunder Rasengan, suddenly emitted a very intense white light from within.\nThe entire dark red Molten Giant Fist also swelled, like a balloon about to burst.\nYet, the swollen Molten Giant Fist did not explode in the end.\nAs a series of rolling thunders spread out, the energy within the Thunder Rasengan was completely consumed by the searing rolling magma, incinerating to nothingness.\nThe terrifying temperature of this lava even swallowed the thunder itself!\nThe Molten Giant surveyed in all directions, searching for Austin's trace.\nOnly, by then Austin had already flown far away, leaving only a black dot on the horizon.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nThe Molten Giant roared in fury, pounding the ground around madly, causing volcanoes to boil up under its terrifying might, spewing magma pillars, and rolling gray-black smoke rose, covering half of the sky.\nClearly, Austin's escape had driven the Elemental Lord into an extreme rage.\nNo matter how furious the Elemental Lord was, Austin, who planned to leave temporarily, wouldn't foolishly return to clash head-on again, vanishing into the sky, leaving the Molten Giant raging in place.\n...\nSoon after, atop a mountain peak at the edge of the volcanic region, Austin descended from the sky with a gust of wind, creating a torrent at the mountain peak as if a flood was unleashed.\nGazing at the volcano cluster behind, concentrated with Fire Element, Austin began to take a brief rest, recovering his magic power, while also contemplating the gains from this battle.\n\"It's indeed no surprise a being with one foot in the Legendary Realm; even with only two-thirds of its full strength remaining, it is not something an ordinary person can deal with.\"\nWhen the Molten Giant finally used the surrounding exploding Fire Elements to repair itself and recover its injuries, Austin knew this trial battle had concluded.\nHaving used the two Law Divine Swords, nurtured for over a month, now the swords could only serve as a relatively powerful attack method, rather than as a killer trump card.\nExhausting his most powerful attack and still not slaying the enemy, while the opponent could restore its injuries by absorbing its companions' strength, dragging it out like this, as long as the Fire Element creatures under the Fire Elemental Lord were not completely eliminated, eventually, it would be Austin who would be worn down.\nTherefore, without hesitation, Austin turned and left.\n\"Though I expected this, it's still a bit frustrating.\"\nOriginally, Austin's purpose in this venture was just to investigate the Elemental Lord's details, having been prepared for a long-term siege and did not expect to slay the opponent in one attempt.\nAfter all, it was a Half-Legendary, bordering the Legendary Realm.\nEven if the Fire Element faced strong suppression in the Prime Material Plane, he did not hope to easily succeed in annihilating the Fire Elemental Lord, Austin had even planned to summon the Beastman army to help encircle and kill after reconnaissance.\nHowever, after a fierce battle, and even using the Law Divine Swords nurtured for a month, aside from not yet utilizing the Wind and Thunder Dual Swords Unification he was still exploring, Austin had basically given his all.\nYet even so, he still had to retreat first, which made Austin obviously somewhat unwilling.\nNevertheless, no matter how unwilling, one must face reality.\n\"It seems this time I need to bring the Beastman clan members, let the Extraordinary Beastman Army draw the attention of the Fire Elemental Life, pulling them away one by one and then eliminating them individually, this way, it should counter the Elemental Lord's ability to absorb Fire Elemental regeneration.\"\nReflecting on this entire battle, Austin began to ponder his gains.\nAlthough he couldn't successfully kill the Fire Elemental Lord, at least he had gathered enough intelligence, and next, it was about making a battle plan based on this information.\n\"The newly reformed Extraordinary Beastmen just recently joined the army, and spellcasters among the elves were assembled recently to form a Spellcaster Legion, this time, it's about time to bring out the reformed Dragon Nest Legion to train.\"\nAfter thinking it over thoroughly and ensuring nothing was missed, Austin then soared into the sky, returning to the Dragon Nest Tribe.",

      "content": "Austin's return did not bring much turmoil to the Dragon Nest Tribe, though the orcs in the tribe couldn't help but shout with excitement when they saw the enormous figure flying over from Sky Mountain.\n\"Is that His Highness Austin?\"\nAmidst the cheering crowd, a skinny goblin looked up at the giant figure in the sky, knelt on the ground, and bowed towards Austin flying overhead, his eyes filled with reverence.\nAs a weak goblin who had just recently joined the Dragon Nest Tribe, he was full of curiosity about everything in the powerful tribe.\nAt the same time, for the one who created everything, allowing them to escape hunger and hardship, in the simplistic mind of this goblin, an unparalleled devotion towards the immensely great Lord Austin resided.\n\"Yes, that is His Highness, the greatest Blue Dragon Lord in this world. Back then, the Dragon Nest Tribe was far less prosperous and powerful, there were only a few kobolds and a couple of ramshackle houses. Who could have imagined that under His Highness's leadership, it would grow to such a scale in such a short time? One day, His Highness will surely become a mighty ruler renowned across the continent.\"\nThe goblin captain ahead of the frail goblin also looked toward Austin with devotion and reverence, as if he were facing a divine being.\nThis goblin captain was once an insignificant, worthless goblin, like a weed that could perish in an unnoticed corner at any moment.\nHunger and danger were the themes that ran through the lives of these lowly beings in the entire Kawa Great Forest.\nLater, Lizardman Rodney gathered some companions along with some wandering beastmen to establish a tribe, and he was fortunate to become one of its members.\nSubsequently, the tribe established by Lizardman Rodney was defeated by the then Jackal Wolfman Tribe, the whole group dispersed in retreat, and the goblin captain followed Lizardman Rodney in wandering, foolishly attacking the newly established, dilapidated Dragon Nest Tribe which then only had seven kobolds.\nThat battle had a lifelong impact on him.\nAfter being captured post-battle, they were pardoned by the great His Highness Austin, who assimilated them into the new Dragon Nest Tribe, making him a member of the great Highness's army.\nThe goblin captain could be considered a veteran figure from the time the Dragon Nest Tribe was established.\nHe witnessed firsthand how the Dragon Nest Tribe expanded under Austin's leadership, embarking on the road to dominate all directions.\nThe little goblin, once holding a broken wooden spear, shivering in the cold wind, fearfully charging with the leader, never imagined he would one day get the chance to participate in such a magnificent history of the tribe's rise?\nAnd indeed, he is one of the many bystander roles in that epic story.\nThe deeds of following His Highness to battle in all directions, diligently undertaking construction efforts are capital enough for the goblin captain to boast for a lifetime in his remaining days.\n....\nOf course, Austin was unaware of the psychological activities of the two goblins among the many orcs below.\nUpon returning to the tribe, he started to gather the high-ranking members of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"Vini, gather the Extraordinary beastman army, prepare for war, and ten days later, we'll set out collectively against the Fire Elemental Lord.\"\nWhen the first order was issued, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe started moving.\nNow, with the expansion of the Dragon Nest Tribe, the whole clan tribe has grown to a huge extent, enough to support an army composed of Extraordinary beastmen.\nFrom external recruits, self-awakened Extraordinary beastmen, those personally transformed by Austin, and spellcasters selected from among the elves.\nIn total, the entire Extraordinary army numbered over two thousand, representing the elite among the military forces of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nIn this war to clear out the fire elements, ordinary beastmen weren't of much use, at most they could clear the battlefield afterward; facing all fire elements above the Bronze Level, only the amassed Extraordinary army of the Dragon Nest Tribe would be the real main force for the purge.\nHence this war almost mobilized the entire Extraordinary beastman force of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThe whole Dragon Nest clan tribe quickly entered a tense emergency war state, preparing for the upcoming assault on the Fire Elemental Lord.\nA large amount of materials began to be mobilized, armor and weapons, as well as healing potions, were quickly amassed in large quantities.\nIt's worth mentioning that the annexation of the Elf Kingdom brought numerous benefits to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAfter all, it's a remnant of the Elf Kingdom that once ruled the entire Kawa Great Forest and had developed for a millennium within the secret realm space supported by the elf's Mother Tree.\nThus, within the Elf Kingdom, not only was there a relatively complete magic inheritance, but there was also some simple knowledge and inheritance in pharmacy, alchemy, and extraordinary weapon crafting.\nWith the successful annexation of the Elf Kingdom, a wealth of knowledge was consolidated into the Dragon Nest Tribe, with its profound heritage being digested one by one.\nThe biggest beneficiary among them was the healthcare department of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nPreviously, the medical system established by the Dragon Nest Tribe followed the path of herbal treatment known from the past, and after several years of development, they had gained quite some experience and insights into treating common illnesses as well as understanding some basic principles such as the properties of drugs and their interactions.\nWith the sharing of the Elf Kingdom's pharmaceutical knowledge, the foundation of the healthcare department of the Dragon Nest Tribe was further enhanced.\nUtilizing that pharmaceutical knowledge, the healthcare department successfully developed a new type of healing potion using Snake Shedding Grass.\nJust a small bottle of it can rapidly restore life in a short time, which has an immensely powerful significance for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nSimilarly, the same applies to alchemy and extraordinary weapon crafting.\nRelying on the experience gleaned from previous attempts in crafting Bronze, and combining it with some knowledge of extraordinary weapon crafting, the goblins successfully designed a method to craft extraordinary equipment from Magic Water Pattern Ore.\nThe extraordinary weapons and equipment crafted through this method, although very rudimentary, would be seen as a waste of resources by human world alchemy masters, still proved far more resilient than ordinary bronze weaponry, and additionally contained water attribute destructiveness.\nWater restrains fire, so these weapons and equipment containing water attributes can play a highly significant role in this war against the Fire Elemental Lord.\nWithin these ten days, a considerable amount of manpower of the Dragon Nest Tribe was directed toward potion and extraordinary weapon crafting.\nThe previously cleared dangerous zone, Wet Bone Forest, underwent extensive development, with large quantities of Snake Shedding Grass and Magic Water Pattern Ore being harvested and subsequently refined into numerous healing potions and extraordinary equipment.\nWith the mobilization of countless resources, amidst this tense preparation, ten days passed in a flash.\nAfter ten days,\nThe fully equipped elite army of the Dragon Nest, led by Austin, valiantly marched toward the place of the Fire Elemental Lord.",

Thick smoke billowed upwards, while resilient, red shrubs grew on cliffs where lava could not reach, bringing some vitality to this scorching land.\n\"Looks like I'll have to make the first move and lure out the Elemental Lord.\"\nBehind Austin, the Dragon Nest elite legion stood ready, their aura fierce,\nlike fearsome giant beasts quietly lurking, about to reveal their sharp fangs.\n\"Attack!\"\nWith no more words, Austin waved his hand to advance.\nIn the battle plan, the Molten Giant, which was the Elemental Lord's shell, was too powerful. If it broke into the army formation, it could cause significant casualties.\nTherefore, Austin was the first to act.\nOnce he lured out the Molten Giant from the volcano and held it down, apart from a few Beastman Junior Officers mastering the Six Techniques to join the confrontation, the remaining Extraordinary Beastmen would split into squads to lure the fire element life forms away from the Elemental Lord's battlefield.\nWhen luring the fire elements, they should try to make a larger disturbance, ideally drawing out the fire element creatures from beneath the surface.\nAustin spread his wings, creating a massive torrent, and in the breeze of the wind element, flew towards the depth of the Volcanic Cluster Domain.\nAs Austin flew away, the Dragon Nest legion behind him began to move with a slight delay.\n\"This is it.\"\nSuspended at a certain high altitude, Austin was right above the place where he had previously battled the Fire Elemental Lord.\n\"Get out here!\"\nAbruptly, the void twisted into vortices, and with a substantial injection of magic power, a series of Rasengan formed, floating in the surrounding space.\nWhizz!

How could the Elemental Lord not be infuriated?\nBubble bubble!\nDark red hot magma surged, forming an enormous hand in the air, shrouding Austin high in the sky with the Molten Giant's immense anger.\nThe dark red lava blocked the sky, aiming to slap Austin in the sky like a fly.\n\"It's coming!\"\nUnder the engulfing lava hand in the sky, Austin focused, flapped his wings, and with the surrounding wind element swirling, his massive body vanished like shadows, rapidly dodging the enclosing space before the lava hand could strike.\nRumble!!!\nA missed strike, the ground cracked, and dark red lava spurted out, melting a significant amount of volcanic rock.\nAt this moment, Austin, having nimbly flown behind the Molten Giant, saw that it had no defenses at its back, with no further strength to respond.\nA great opportunity!\nSeizing the chance, Austin made another move.\nBuzz buzz buzz!\nThe space before him distorted continuously, and one Rasengan after another appeared.\nThe glow then spread, painting layers of colors in space, with each Rasengan instantly completing its attribute transformation.\nBang bang bang!\nEach Attribute Rasengan tore through space like meteors, crashing onto the Molten Giant.\nTerrifying attribute energy exploded with incredibly intense tearing capability. The exploded torrential forces ravaged, tearing apart most of the Molten Giant's back.\nThe enormous Molten Giant, over twenty meters tall, had its back blasted with several massive holes in an instant!\n\"Roar!!!\"\nSeriously injured, the Molten Giant howled in pain,\nsimultaneously bursting into dark red light, a ring of dark red light immediately enveloping the sky, stirring the fire elements in the void space into a tumultuous tide.\nThis was a sign of a Talent Magic being cast!\nFlame Storm!\nIn the next moment, enormous fire tornadoes arose from all around, bearing immense heat, sweeping in all directions.\nAustin, having no time to dodge, was directly swept into the Flame Storm, hit by a thunderous impact, his entire body knocked back in the fiery torrent, flipping back hundreds of meters away.\nHe barely flapped his wings to stop his rapidly retreating form, hovering in the air, stabilizing his posture before being slammed to the ground.\nDespite making adjustments, Austin, surviving the direct attack of the Flame Storm, also suffered considerable injury.\nHis body surface was scorched by flames, with scorched blood faintly flowing from his scales.\nJust in the first round of engagement, both sides plunged into the fiercest confrontation!\nMeanwhile, at the periphery, the Dragon Nest Beastman elite legion also closed in, deliberately luring the surrounding fire element creatures away from the battlefield.",

      "content": "\"Kill! Charge!\"\nWhile Austin was fiercely battling the lava giant, the Extraordinary army of the Dragon Nest Legion had already stepped into the area, continuously engaging with the fire elements emerging from the magma, deftly shifting the battlefield towards the perimeter.\nThe robust beastman transcendent warriors, clad in extraordinary armor made from water patterned demon iron ore, wield weapons crafted from the same material, their shield almost like a wall blocking the front.\nThe weapons and armor imbued with water attribute power are incredibly restraining to the fire elements, with each strike virtually equal to a critical hit, while the scorching damage from the fire elements barely poses any threat to the extraordinary armor imbued with water attributes.\nA solid line of heavily armored beastmen transcendent warriors formed a steel defense line, turning into slaughtering machines akin to meat grinders.\nOne slash per fire element, the scattered elemental crystal cores are everywhere.\nIn the coordinated hunting of the team, the close combat beastman transcendent warriors are slower in slaughter compared to the elf spellcasters behind the steel defense line, which is true wide-scale slaughter.\nIn this volcanic region, the air is poor in water elements, yet the water attribute attack magic condensed here deals double damage to the fire elements.\nAn ordinary water arrow technique, unable to pierce even stone, yet the condensed water elements are like deadly poison to the fire elemental creatures.\nAccompanied by the elf spellcasters wielding magic staffs behind the beastman warriors, a barrage of water arrows shot out of the sky, felling one fire elemental creature after another like cutting wheat, almost leaving no enemy standing after one round.\nBeastman transcendent warriors and elf mages cooperated to turn the surroundings into a slaughter Asura pit of fire elements.\nFire elements died continuously; in this Prime Material Plane, the fire elemental creatures suffered from strong suppression and couldn't exert their true power, perishing within the Dragon Nest Legion.\nEven the elite fire elements were easily slain by the noncommissioned officers commanding one or two Beastman Six Techniques.\nWith heavy shields like iron towers, beastman officers spearheaded like wild bulls, shattering the earth and lifting a torrent with force that deflects the attacking fire elements like a shield plaque.\nBeastman officers, swift as specters, flashed ten meters in the blink of an eye, shredding fire elements along the path with sheer power before they could see clearly.\nThe so-called officers in the Dragon Nest elite legion are above captain level transcendent beastmen.\nThe strong prevail, the weak fall—this is how Dragon Nest Tribe beastmen ranks are chosen.\nNo beastman who received an officer rank is weak.\nAs for junior officers, they are the strongest among the strong, mastering six techniques beyond their level limit.\nAlthough mastering only one or two moves of the Beastman Six Techniques, in battle, the beastman officers wield these skills as if by arm, integrating them into the voice of combat style, substantially enhancing their true power.\nWith the powerful beastman officers at the helm, the Dragon Nest elite warriors and mages combined forces for output.\nThe entire battlefield leaned towards a Dragon Nest elite legion advantage.\nIn terms of weaponry and mastered combat techniques, the Dragon Nest beastmen side held an absolute upper hand.\nIn this clash of iron and fire, the side of the fire elemental creatures suffered a crushing defeat.\nQuickly, the battlefield was divided, as Dragon Nest elite units led by noncommissioned officer captains began to split into teams, segmenting and dispersing across the immense war zone.\nAs the war progressed, unnoticed, elite squads of the Dragon Nest Legion began leading large numbers of fire elements away.\nA massive circle formed on the battlefield far from Austin and the lava giant's combat zone.\nA large army of fire elements was like sand on the ground, mostly swept by an unseen hand to the perimeter, unknowingly distancing from the fierce battle between the two terrifying giant beasts at the center.\n...\n\"The law, it's the Fire Elemental Law!\"\nShaken and injured again by the flame storm, Austin finally perceived the true nature of the sweeping red glow.\nThe lava giant ahead, during the casting of Meteor Sky Burst, would scatter a ring of red hot light around, exerting a mighty pressure.\nWhen Austin initially unsheathed the Wind and Thunder Swords, severely wounding it, relying on devouring a massive amount of the Essence of Fire to recuperate, its body also shone with such explosive light when crushing subordinates' elemental lives.\nAdditionally, as it just cast Flame Storm with its back towards Austin, red oppressive light also enveloped it.\nNo wonder it felt somewhat familiar initially; it turned out to be the power of law!\nOnly with the power of law can such devastating talent magic be launched in this Prime Material Plane, a place of great suppression, causing such cataclysmic momentum.\n\"Indeed, this half-legendary elemental lord contains the Flame Law Origin within. Only the law can ignore the suppression of elemental life in the Prime Material Plane, producing such formidable attack power!\"\nIdeas rapidly flowed in Austin's mind as he soared in the high skies.\nDespite this, Austin didn't lose his courage for battle, feeling a surge of excitement instead.\nIf that's the case, as long as he slays it, he not only can complete metamorphosis through its elemental crystal core, stepping into the gold high tier rapidly, but also can devour the remnant Flame Law Origin, hence gaining mastery over the Fire Elemental Law?\nA wave of excitement surged internally, wind elements encircled, his entire gigantic figure turned into streaks of afterimages swiftly flying through the emptiness.\nAvoiding the lava giant's attacks, Austin would occasionally seize chances to land a few rounds of Attribute Rasengan on the giant's massive body.\nThe cumbersome figure of the lava giant couldn't catch swift as wind Austin, nor evade Austin's Rasengan assaults.\nThe lava giant's attacks consecutively missed, shattering the ground, magma splashing, yet not harming Austin in the slightest.\nDespite the lava giant's unique nature, the outer volcanic magma is merely a mantle armor created by the fire element lord for self-protection, even if its upper body is smashed, as long as the core is untouched, it can recuperate using the infinite magma beneath.\nHowever, under Austin's incessant unwinding attack, the lava giant eventually became worn down, its aura dimmed, although furious at Austin's provoking moves initially, the giant's attacks became sluggish as its aura waned.\nOne blue dragon, one lava giant battled, Austin relied on speed to kite and wear down.\nFinally, at some point, the lava giant unleashed a widespread flame shock, deeply repelling Austin.\nSimultaneously, red light burst from its body, intending to reuse its trick of destroying subordinate fire elemental lives to recover its own state!\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nAs the red light swept, the law's oscillation spread; amidst consecutive muffled sounds, nearby fire elements along with their elemental crystal cores shattered, seamlessly transforming into pure fire elemental energy floating in the air.\nMeanwhile, a tremendous suction appeared on the dim lava giant's body, drawing the ambient fire elemental energy like a vortex into its body, swiftly restoring its aura.\nHowever, the next moment,\nThe lava giant, having swallowed all the surrounding fire elements, apparently stiffened.",

      "content": "The devoured fire elements are insufficient, which is quite awkward.\nAfter crushing the surrounding fire elements, the aura on the Elemental Lord only recovered halfway, far from its full peak. Compared to the first battle with Austin, where a single skill could completely restore its aura, it's a significant difference.\nThe Molten Giant Beast's scarlet eyes stared blankly around; the ground held no more elemental life, only a few dozen scattered because they were too far and weren't attracted away by the Dragon Nest elite troop, had become nourishment for the Molten Giant Beast's previous self-repair.\nIt stood there dumbfounded, feeling a vast expanse of white emptiness around.\nThe Fire Elemental Lord instinctively felt something was amiss, but couldn't pinpoint what exactly was wrong.\nEven as the Fire Elemental Lord, it hadn't broken free from the realm of elemental life, impulsiveness, anger, and extreme aggressiveness are their nature; encountering situations, they never think with their simple minds.\n\"Hmph, how could I possibly challenge you here again without preparation!\"\nSeeing the Molten Giant Beast standing dazed, Austin coldly snorted, obviously irritated by the shameless recovery skills of the creature before him.\nIf not for that Talent Magic of devouring kind to restore its own life, Austin might have already slain it during the first encounter, without having to bring over a large number of Dragon Nest Tribe elites in the end.\nThough the Dragon Nest Tribe elite had gained the upper hand in this war with the fire elements, the resultant shockwaves from the battle with this Molten Giant Beast still resulted in many elite casualties and injuries.\nThere was no other way.\nTo kill this Elemental Lord, some sacrifices had to be made.\n\"Warriors of the tribe, attack with me!\"\nWith a roar, Austin charged down from high in the sky with immense power, his wings flapping, stirring up a huge whirlwind.\nA gigantic Rasengan gathered in his wide, grinning mouth, then transformed into an Attribute Rasengan in an instant, shooting out like a cannonball, striking the Molten Giant Beast still in a stupor.\n\"Charge! For the great His Highness Austin!\"\nSimultaneously, the Beastman Junior Officers, waiting at the periphery, following Austin's command after the Molten Giant Beast's aura weakened, charged forward like ferocious tigers released from their cages.\nWith the Molten Giant Beast's aura weakened and movements slowed, the Beastman Junior Officers used instant steps and air steps to dodge the beast's attacks, effectively dealing damage.\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\nThe Rasengan exploded on the Molten Giant Beast, the explosion force shaking its enormous body violently.\nMeanwhile, at the feet of the Molten Giant Beast, the Beastman Junior Officers moved through the void like lightning across the magma-filled ground, unleashing a torrent of attacks while the Molten Giant ignored them momentarily.\n\"Gale Wave: Chaos!\"\n\"Gale Wave: Bird!\"\n\"Gale Wave Hundred-Line Kill!\"\nGreen energy slash waves lashed through the air, tearing it apart, wildly attacking toward the Molten Giant's massive feet.\nMore Beastman Junior Officers used air steps to leap high, soaring tens of meters into the sky, attacking from above, sending slash waves cutting into the Molten Giant's back.\nIn front of the towering, twenty-meter-tall Molten Giant Beast, these dozen-or-so Beastman Junior Officers seemed as small as mice to human eyes. But these mice relentlessly attacked, continuously breaking down the lava making up the Molten Giant, further weakening its aura.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nThe Molten Giant roared towards the sky, its furious flames burning fiercely; its lava-formed body lit with a visible red glow as the fluctuations of the laws invigorated the nearby fire elements.\nIn battle, even ten buzzing flies around you would drive you insane.\nLet alone these ten 'mice' capable of causing you harm?\nEspecially when the one being harassed is the notoriously short-tempered Fire Elemental Lord.\nThe mighty tiger has fallen to the lowlands, bullied by mere dogs; how dare these dozen or so Silver Level mice presumptuously challenge its authority, they truly think a Half-Legendary's majesty is as fragile as a tofu shell!\nInfuriated beyond measure, the Fire Elemental Lord unleashed its internal Flame Law, turning the entire space into a boiling realm of fire elements.\nMeteor Sky Burst!\nIt's determined to blast these damned mice to ashes!\nHowever, consumed by rage, the Fire Elemental Lord overlooked the ever-watchful significant enemy before it.\nJust when it was about to cast its Talent Magic successfully,\n\"Rasengan!\"\nIn the distant sky, Austin abruptly flashed like lightning, his claw bearing a Rasengan with a diameter of one meter, suddenly appearing before the Molten Giant.\nRiiiip!\nThe Rasengan, glowing white, suddenly turned to a deep azure, with lightning flashes tearing through the void.\nThe Rasengan, transforming its attributes in an instant, pressed against the Molten Giant's chest!\nFrom the moment the Elemental Lord started to cast Meteor Sky Burst, it felt something was wrong.\nBut before it could react, Austin had already charged in with the Thundering Rasengan, aiming directly for its chest, watching its red pupils contract violently in its sight.\nBoom!!!\nTerrifying energy erupted, a halo of light blossomed in the void, the steel-hard body made of solidified lava was instantly torn apart by the overwhelming force, with emitted thunder like rotating rings of light, slicing through like laser beams, cutting large chunks of condensed lava.\nAll along, Austin treated the Rasengan as a long-range attack tool.\nBut now, upon personally delivering the Thundering Rasengan into the Molten Giant's body, Austin truly sensed the terrifying power contained within it!\nThe terrifying force instantly pierced through the Molten Giant's chest, revealing the Elemental Lord wrapped in white flames that stood over a meter tall!\nAt this moment, the Elemental Lord, interrupted mid-casting, suffered from spell failure backlash, further sustained severe damage from Austin's direct hit with the Thundering Rasengan to its core.\nHowever, this is not enough for a kill!\nThe moment Austin saw the Elemental Lord up close, he knew ordinary means wouldn't slay this creature.\nThe Elemental Lord's core seemed constructed by the Flame Law Origin.\nTo completely kill it, ordinary power isn't enough.\nOnly a law can fight against a law!\n\"Restrain it!\"\nAustin roared immediately, disregarding the backlash from the Thundering Rasengan and the surrounding molten rock's searing heat, spread his wings, and rose skyward amidst the Wind Element's swirl.\nAt the same moment, following Austin's command.\nClang! Clang! Clang!\nMassive chains suddenly danced in the air like dragon serpents, within an instant binding the wounded Molten Giant's hands and feet. Each Beastman Junior Officer, gripping the chain's other end, was like a nail securing them firmly to the surrounding ground.\nThe Molten Giant, with half its chest collapsed, was immediately fixed by chains, unable to move.",

      "content": "At the same time, Austin's figure darted like lightning, and in a breath, he soared to the sky above a thousand meters.\nHigh above, Austin gazed down upon the earth, his eyes sweeping across with the majesty of a Divine vision.\nHis divine might was unfathomable, as deep as the abyss and as vast as the sea!\nUnbeknownst to anyone, a massive cloud as heavy as a mountain had already shrouded the sky, covering the entire space, dimming the light as if excluding the whole world from heaven and earth.\nBuzz!\nIn the void, ripples arose, and slowly emerged two mystically profound Law Divine Swords, indescribable by mere words.\nAt the moment those two Law Divine Swords appeared, the entire sky shook, as if causing a turbulent upheaval in the void.\nSimultaneously, Austin gently closed his eyes in the high sky, his heart and spirit merging into his mind, strenuously controlling the changes of the two Law Divine Swords.\nPower imitates Magic Power, and the spirit serves as Divine Sense.\nThrough the convergence of two similar powers, Austin began to drive the fusion of the two Law Divine Swords, inspired by imaginative concepts from fantasy novels he had seen in a past life.\nAs the intangible Magic Power and Spiritual Power drove them, ripples spread through the void, and the two forged Law Divine Swords underwent mystical changes.\nIt was like entering an invisible, indescribable, unspeakable state.\nIn that state of emptiness, the forces of wind and thunder continued to intersect and merge, forming an even more violent and powerful force!\n\"Wind and Thunder Fusion!\"\nAs Austin's mind willed it, the two Law Divine Swords, drawing their Vacuum Power, descended magnificently from beyond the heavens.\nLike a comet across the sky, they stirred up a vast river, and the star river descended from beyond the heavens.\nSimultaneously, during their descent, the energy from the two Divine Swords surged into the nine skies, lurking beneath the nine lands, blending with the Celestial Secret Aura.\nLike Tai Chi's yin and yang, eventually merging completely at one moment.\nWith the convergence of wind and thunder, all the forces of wind and thunder finally vanished, and the two Law Divine Swords overlapped at one point, forming an even stronger power!\nDual Swords Unification, complete!\nThat was an indescribably brilliant radiance, like the great sun falling from the nine heavens, filling the entire void with a dazzling glow, flowing like the tide.\nThat sword, carrying an immeasurable might that shook the universe and could annihilate heaven and earth, descended towards the lava giant, immobilized by the Magic Power Water Pattern Steel Chain.\nAs they watched that boundless and endless sword light fall,\nthe lava giant's scarlet eyes flashed wildly, feeling as if the gates of hell had opened at this moment, with the scythe of Death God descending upon them!\nDeath!!!\nIn a critical moment, the lava giant roared ferociously, struggling mightily, while the Fire Elemental Lord at its core tried to escape the shell towards the outside world.\nBut, it was too late!\nThat sword, infused with the dual forces of wind and thunder, seemingly pierced through layers of space's mirror in an instant, reaching right before them instantly.\nRumble!!!\nA vast light exploded, like the Milky Way pouring down; large swathes of earth vanished, heavy air currents rose up, lifting a massive amount of volcanic rock, obscuring the sky and the sun.\nBillowing smoke and dust rose up across the sky, turning half the sky gray-black; visible hurricanes swept up, streaks of lightning sweeping across the void and earth, akin to the arrival of a magnificent scene of an apocalyptic catastrophe.\nLand and sea rose and fell, and the thundering scene rolled on for quite a while before gradually dissipating.\nAs the dust in the air was gently swept away by the breeze, the scene before them unfolded into view.\nOn the previously unbroken volcanic land, now appeared a bottomless abyssal crevice; small stones at its edges fell into the chasm without producing any sound.\nThis was a sword mark slashed out by the Wind and Thunder Dual Swords Unification, stretching for thousands of meters, like a massive gaping scar on the earth.\nIn the high-altitude, Austin panted heavily, using his Spiritual Power to summon back the two almost invisible Law Divine Swords, merging them back into his body to nurture again.\nThe power of the Wind and Thunder Dual Swords Unification was indeed immensely powerful, comparable to the divine might exhibited at the moment a Law Divine Sword unsheathed after nurturing for at least half a year.\nBut at the same time, the consumption of spiritual power and Magic Power was enormous.\nAfter executing this move, even with Austin's advantage of being a giant dragon by species, his inner Magic Power and Spiritual Power were more than half drained, with half of his combat strength gone.\nHowever, despite the great cost, the results did not disappoint Austin either.\n\"Finally dead!\"\nBoth the lava giant and the Elemental Lord were reduced to ash under that single sword.\nAll that remained was a flame-like essence slowly rotating, as brilliant as a galaxy, yet like a burning rose of flame, emitting an alluring radiance.\nThis was not an Elemental Crystal Core but an Elemental Essence!\nUnlike the Elemental Crystal Core left by ordinary Fire Elementals upon death, the Elemental Lord's was a mass of Fire Elemental Essence, oscillating between tangible and intangible, emitting a terrifying fluctuation.\nAustin descended from the sky, surrounded by the gathering Beastman Officers.\nPreviously, the wind and thunder sword did not aim at them, and the highly concentrated power did not spill out; only those too close were slightly embarrassed by the residual attack, without much damage.\nSeeing this, Austin nodded and reassuredly shifted his gaze to the Flame Essence left after the death of the Elemental Lord.\nWith a gentle flap of wings, under the lead of the Wind Element, he glided like a feather, landing lightly beside the Fire Elemental Essence.\n\"Such intensely concentrated Magic Power can actually form this shape!\"\nThough the Magic Power Essence before him seemed but a small mass, in reality, the power contained within this small clump of Fire Elemental Essence was nearly a hundred times the total Magic Power in Austin's entire being!\nIt's well known that with Austin's dragon bloodline, the Magic Power contained within his body is at least ten times that of an average human Gold Level Great Mage at peak, thus the Fire Elemental Essence contained within is as vast as an ocean.\nMoreover, this Fire Elemental Essence is a level-up stage of Fire Elemental Magic Power!\nAustin had a feeling that, by absorbing this Fire Elemental Essence, his Level Realm could break through to the Gold High Tier level in a short time.\nHowever, caution was needed.\nAt least, in his current not fully-restored state, it was not yet time to devour and refine this Magic Power Essence.\nYet as Austin was about to put away this Fire Elemental Essence,\nsuddenly, he sharply sensed something.\n\"Not good! The Flame Law Origin is rapidly dissipating!\"\nAt this moment, within the Magic Power Essence left after the death of the Fire Elemental Lord, the Flame Law was rapidly dissipating into the void, and the Flame Law Origin of the entire Fire Elemental Essence was about to completely vanish!\nThe dissipation was so fast that Austin had no time to think it through in detail.\nUltimately, Austin had to do something insane once more.\nOpening his mouth, he swallowed the Fire Elemental Essence whole!",

      "content": "This isn't the first time Austin has directly consumed the Law Origin.\nLong before this, he had devoured and refined a wisp of the Wind Law Origin as if it were food, integrating it into his own bloodline.\nThe successful refinement of the Wind Law Origin marked a shortcut for Austin to ascend rapidly, relying on the consumption of Law Origins to understand the Laws.\nThis method of quickly enhancing one's power was something Austin deeply desired.\nAfter successfully refining the Wind Law Origin, Austin's strength had increased by several levels compared to before.\nThanks to his skilled control over the Wind Element, his speed had also increased by several times.\nIt was the power of the Wind Law that, during previous battles, enabled him to evade the attacks of the Lava Giant time and again with the swiftness granted by the surrounding Wind Elements.\nIf not for the insight into that trace of Wind Law power that gave him a significant boost, the battle against the Elemental Lord would have ended with more than just embarrassment, but with a thorough defeat.\nHaving witnessed the power of the Law, Austin had no intention of giving up on the Flame Law Origin within the Fire Elemental Lord.\nAustin's desire for the Flame Law Power was even above his focus on enhancing his Level Cultivation.\nThus, when he discovered the Flame Law Origin within the Essence of Fire rapidly dissipating, Austin, in his eagerness to enhance his strength, swallowed it whole.\nHowever, this action resulted in significant trouble.\nThis was completely different from the previous trace of Wind Attribute Law Origin.\nThe previous consumption involved only a trace of the Wind Law Origin, with nothing else included.\nMoreover, by then, Austin had already begun mastering the power of the Wind Element and had developed a Wind Attribute Rasengan using its properties.\nAt that time, Austin's control over the Wind Element had reached a fairly sophisticated level.\nBut now,\nThe Fire Elemental Essence that Austin swallowed contained not only the nearly depleted Flame Law Origin but also a vast ocean-like amount of highly condensed Fire Elemental Power!\nThe massive Fire Elemental Energy exploded within his body, crashing through every barrier within Austin's body like a tidal wave, as if about to burst from within.\nSimultaneously, the Flame Law Origin within began to riot, causing a tempest of Fire Elements to surge throughout the void inside and outside of Austin's body.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nFlames spewed from Austin's eyes, nostrils, and mouth, his body's original dark blue color now covered by the substantial accumulated heat of the Fire Elemental Energy, emitting a dark red glow.\nThe air around his body was densely saturated with Fire Elements, the searing temperature like molten lava, making the air seem as if it might ignite.\nHis entire dragon form was like an iron block heated to red-hot, radiating intense heat.\nMoreover, with the strike of immense Fire Elements and Flame Law, Austin felt as if each cell within him was ripping apart, every inch of bone tearing and crushing, like streams of molten lava coursing through his veins, burning his flesh and bones to ash.\nHe had never mastered the power of Fire Elements, nor did he possess any Talent Magic for Fire Attributes.\nAustin's knowledge of Fire Elements was nonexistent.\nAt this rate, the only outcome was a body rupture and death!\nFeeling the dire situation within his body, Austin had no time to give instructions for aftermath matters. Driven by a powerful survival instinct, he flew up and plunged into a nearby volcano.\nAt the center of the immense volcano was a caldera spanning several hundred meters, filled with boiling lava, with bubbles popping in the deep red molten rock.\nThis was a world of magma, as well as the place housing Austin's lifeline.\nAustin plunged like a massive stone from the sky, splashing large waves of lava. The surrounding molten rock spilled from fissures along the edges, forming a bright stream of lava down the volcano.\n\"I will soon enter slumber; decide in the tribe as you see fit.\"\nBarely maintaining a shred of consciousness, Austin's deep voice echoed from the smoking volcano.\nWithout waiting for the Dragon Nest Beastmen's response, he rolled in the flowing volcanic lava and swam directly toward the depth of the volcano.\nThe searing magma scorched Austin's body; though the dragon's bloodline had strong magic resistance, Austin was not a Red Dragon born in magma. The burning pain from the magma lashed his mind like tsunami waves.\nCombined with the internal turmoil from the Fire Elemental Essence, it was a predicament both internal and external.\nThankfully, after sinking to the volcano's bottom, the massive amount of Fire Elemental Essence and Flame Law began to calm slightly, although still violent and conflicting, but at least no longer threatening to cause him to explode.\n\"Next time, even if I, Austin, am beaten to death or thrown off a cliff, I will absolutely never again willingly consume any Law Origin or Elemental Energy!\"\nWith this last thought of exasperated resolve, the survival instincts of the dragon within Austin began to take over his consciousness.\nA heavily injured dragon can recover through slumber.\nNow, faced with immense danger, Austin began to enter slumber, allowing his body to adjust on its own.\nSoon, everything before him slowly sank into darkness.\nThe volcano's mouth calmed down as if nothing had happened.\n...\nAt the same time, as Austin fell into a slumber, a commotion arose within the Dragon Nest Elite Legion in the Volcanic Cluster Domain.\n\"His Highness has fallen into slumber; what should we do next?\"\n\"First gather the army to eliminate all the Fire Elements here, and then send people to establish an outpost, ensuring His Highness' sleep is not disturbed in the slightest!\"\nWith brief deliberation, the Dragon Nest Elite Legion came to a decision.\nSubsequently, under top-down coordination, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe began to move.\nA large number of Beastman soldiers entered the Volcanic Cluster Domain, under the leadership of extraordinary Beastmen, to eliminate one Fire Element after another.\nMeanwhile, around the volcano where Austin slept, many Beastmen constructed layers of defensive fortifications using water and volcanic ash.\nAs an early substitute for concrete, the constructed fortress with volcanic ash had a certain level of defensibility, and the Dragon Nest Beastmen even considered transporting some volcanic ash back to the Dragon Nest Tribe City for future construction work.\nThe construction of the outpost wasn't near the volcano where Austin fell asleep.\nDue to the harsh climate of the volcanic region and the lack of supplies from the outside, the guards around the volcano where Austin slept were essentially all elite forces.\nThus, the main forces established a new outpost at the boundary between the volcanic area and the Forest Land, beginning a new cycle of clearing and farming, crafting the second Dragon Nest Tribe outpost.\nCompared to the barren, arid Volcanic Cluster Domain with its scarcity of resources,\nthe resources from Forest Land facilitated enough supply for the Dragon Nest Legion from the outside world.\nOnce the outpost is successfully built, sufficient food can also be obtained from the Forest Land.",

      "content": "Due to Austin's slumber, when constructing the second stronghold, the Dragon Nest Tribe began to shift a large portion of the tribe's resources towards that location.\nThe goal was to create a secure environment for Austin, who was still in slumber, to ensure safe and secluded conditions.\nFor the His Highness, who created everything for the Dragon Nest Tribe and lifted the beastmen out of hardship, no amount of reverence from the beastmen could be too much.\nThus, within a short month, the Dragon Nest Tribe constructed a sizable gathering place at the junction of the forest and the volcano.\nAlmost half of the military forces of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe were stationed here.\nPlans for expansion and consolidation, along with clearing dangerous areas, were essentially canceled, focusing instead on providing the utmost protection for His Highness Austin at the second stronghold.\nMeanwhile, deep within the volcano, beneath the defensive fortifications atop the volcano where Austin had fallen asleep, gathered the vast majority of beastman officers.\nThis portion of the military power accounted for more than half of the Dragon Nest Tribe's forces.\nAside from the necessary guard force, most of the defenses at the first stronghold and the tribe's main city were assembled here.\nThe highest alert of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe!\nDuring this period, some powerful magic beasts passed by, but before anything could happen, they were slaughtered by the formidable Dragon Nest Beastmen, becoming food for the beastmen.\nPreventing magic beasts from entering was also one of the protective purposes of the beastman army.\nWhile the Dragon Nest Legion guarded Austin's slumber, the second stronghold expanded day by day.\nSimultaneously, agricultural efforts began around the stronghold, considering it was quite distant from the Dragon Nest Tribe Main City, and relying solely on buffalo transport to bring food was not viable.\nRelying on transportation alone was too demanding.\nSelf-sufficiency and establishing a food source were imperative for the second stronghold.\nFortunately, there was a substantial river within the forest, allowing for land reclamation and cultivation with abundant water supply.\nFurthermore, due to the volcanic cluster domain nearby, the plentiful volcanic ashes erupted in prior years enriched the soil in the forest land with rich minerals, making the soil extremely fertile.\nAs a result, the first season of arrowroot yielded a bountiful harvest.\nThis marked the entry of the second stronghold into a state of self-sufficiency.\nThe Dragon Nest Beastmen, while cultivating land, also searched and explored nearby areas for useful resources.\nDuring this process, the Dragon Nest Beastmen discovered the various refined gold and mithril magic minerals embedded within the volcanic rocks, which were carried from the deep earth veins by volcanic magma, with particularly abundant reserves.\nAdditionally, the beastmen found gold, iron ore, sulfur, and various other common mineral materials.\nSuch rich volcanic mineral deposits, if found in the human world, could potentially incite a frenzied kingdom war.\nHowever, for the beastmen of the Kawa Great Forest, these items were neither edible nor drinkable, and their current forging technology could not utilize refined gold and mithril to craft weapons.\nThe Elf Kingdom was very poor, having hidden in the Secret Realm Space for a thousand years to evade the Beastman Royal Court's pursuit, thus lacking any opportunity to encounter such high-tier magic mineral materials like refined gold and mithril.\nThe newly established Dragon Nest Tribe was even more so; the entire tribe's forging industry was initiated by Austin.\nConsequently, these incredibly rare materials, difficult to find in the outside world, were merely lamented by the Dragon Nest Beastmen, who then ignored them.\nThe greatest wealth in the eyes of humans was thus disregarded by the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nCompared to those temporarily useless dead objects, the Dragon Nest Beastmen valued far more a type of crop that could serve as food, growing among the many red plants in the scorching dry land of the volcanic cluster domain.\nA plant referred to by indigenous beastmen as the Mountain God Fruit.\nThis plant grew vine-like stems similar to arrowroot, sprawling across the ground, with fiery red leaf stalks, and roots beneath the soil that bore fist-sized fruits rich in starch.\nIf Austin were present, he would realize that this Mountain God Fruit closely resembled the sweet potato from his previous life.\nThriving in the hot arid region, a single Mountain God Fruit plant could yield a significant amount of food, comparable to the output of arrowroot.\nIt's foreseeable that the Mountain God Fruit would inevitably become another novel grain crop for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nIncidentally, the discovery of the Mountain God Fruit owed to the reckless actions of a local indigenous beastman tribe chief.\nThe fiery red Mountain God Fruit was not absent in the volcanic cluster domain, but the Dragon Nest Beastmen would rarely consider digging up each plant to assess its suitability as food; if no accidents occurred, they might not discover this secret for several years.\nBut as the Dragon Nest Tribe constructed the second stronghold, the noise stirred up alarmed a nearby indigenous beastman tribe.\nThis indigenous beastman tribe chief recently became a quasi-silver Beastman Transcendent, about to step into the Silver Tier level realm, feeling extremely spirited, gathering population, leading the tribe to expand to over a thousand members.\nSince there were no other powerful Beastman Transcendents nearby, this indigenous chief, based on his continuous undefeated myth, developed an illusion that he was immensely strong, surely born to be the Beastman King.\nIndeed, he considered himself the Beastman King.\nHe could be called the Dragon Beast Heaven.\nTherefore, when the Dragon Nest Tribe established a stronghold on his territory without his consent,\nthe tribe chief became furious.\nHe led the whole tribe of over a thousand people, heading aggressively towards the second stronghold of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAs a result, he encountered a Dragon Nest Beastman Officer leading a patrolling elite team midway.\nThus, this indigenous tribe met a tragic fate.\nThe Dragon Nest Beastman Officer effortlessly crushed the tribe chief, killing him within a few moves.\nAfterwards, the Dragon Nest Beastman Officer ordered his team to round up the remaining trembling beastmen, tying them up with ropes one by one, annexing the tribe that had delivered itself to them.\nPitifully, the indigenous tribe chief died before achieving victory, his towering ambitions instantly flowing downstream.\nDuring the annexation of this tribe, the Dragon Nest Beastmen discovered that the tribe's location was in a highly concealed mountain pass, and the site was easy to defend but hard to attack; had the tribe chief not acted recklessly, the Dragon Nest Tribe might not have managed to annex this beastman tribe in a short time.\nAlso, during the takeover process of this tribe, the Dragon Nest Beastmen uncovered the secret of the Mountain God Fruit, adding it to the various grains being cultivated.\n...\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe's second stronghold was thus successfully developed amidst minor upheavals, smoothly allowing the Dragon Nest Beastmen to establish themselves nearby.\nAnd the second stronghold, like the first stronghold, was interconnected with the Dragon Nest Tribe Main City, with the three locations forming a strategic triangle, greatly expanding the territory accessible to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nIn such tranquility, the Dragon Nest Tribe developed steadily and expanded reliably.\nTime flowed gently, and before long, half a year had passed, as several seasonal harvests arrived, the year reached its conclusion.\nCold winter, quietly arrived one night.",

      "content": "The cold wind, sharp as a knife, blew down with the falling snow from the sky, painting the earth in a thousand-mile span of silver white.\nThe entire Kawa Great Forest was enveloped in the bitter chill of the winter, as far as the eye could see, it was a vast expanse of white nothingness.\nOnly in this volcanic region was it an exception.\nPerhaps it was because of the abundance of fire elements gathered in the air here, even the cold currents of winter could not influence this place, with no snowflakes falling from the sky, making it stand out sharply amid the icy landscape.\nNo, at least, there was an influence.\nBut as seen, the once freely flowing lava had partially solidified upon contact with the air, with a dark red glow faintly shining from the solidifying rocks.\nEvidently, the part in contact with the air solidified due to the low temperature, although the inside was still a scalding hot magma.\nAfter all, it was winter, and the temperature of the air in the volcanic cluster domain was considerably lower than during the summer.\nCompared to the freezing world outside, the temperature within the volcanic cluster domain was merely around ten or twenty degrees, far from reaching the freezing point.\nDue to the influence of the volcanic cluster domain, apart from occasional snowflakes being blown over from the forest land and melting in mid-air, there had been no further precipitation in the area.\nCome winter, for a warmer and more comfortable living, some beastmen in the second base even built some rudimentary resting cabins within the volcanic region, not fearing a sudden eruption that might engulf both them and their homes.\nAnd some beastmen also found that the temperature within the volcanic cluster domain allowed some wild vegetables to survive during winter where the volcanic ash gathered.\nWith the forest land covered in ice and snow, bringing the snow here to melt and water the wild vegetables was not troublesome.\nThus, some beastmen directly planted some wild vegetables in areas with more soil, ensuring fresh vegetables could be eaten during the cold winter, adding a splash of life to this desolate world.\n\"His Highness has been asleep for half a year, hasn't he?\"\nAt this time, beneath the gigantic volcano where Austin slumbered, a beastman guard posted at a defensive fortification spoke to his companion.\n\"Yes, it's been half a year. This time, His Highness has been asleep much longer than in the previous two times. I don't know when he will wake up, hope nothing goes wrong, may the Beast God bless him.\"\nThe beastman looked back at the still volcano with a deep breath, starting to pray within.\nEver since Austin left a message of his impending slumber half a year ago, the volcano had remained silent.\nDuring this past half year, the Dragon Nest Beastmen busied themselves nearby, from constructing defenses to posting guards, with Austin having had no response from within the lava.\nThis kind of situation inevitably made the loyal Dragon Nest Beastmen somewhat anxious.\nAfter all, what's inside was scorching, molten lava. A normal beastman if not careful might fall in and turn to ash. Who knew what mishap might occur inside?\nMeanwhile, due to Austin's slumber, the Dragon Nest Tribe had to halt large-scale expansion, withdrawing a massive force to safeguard the vicinity.\nThus, during this more than half a year period, the Dragon Nest Tribe's primary focus had been on internal affairs, maintaining existing scale while addressing issues encountered during tribal growth.\nAfter all, under Austin's leadership, the Dragon Nest Tribe had developed rapidly. Having settled down to solidify the foundation was a wise decision.\nPausing the tribe's growth slightly to deeply excavate the Dragon Nest Tribe's current potential and rigorously develop the controlled territory was just as crucial as fast expansion.\nAddressing emerging internal issues at least prevented complications from becoming entrenched, averting many problems.\n...\nAs the Dragon Nest Tribe steadily developed,\nat this moment, within the volcano,\ninside a lake of dark red glimmering magma.\nGulu gulu!\nIn the volcano's mouth, searing bubbles rose from the magma's bottom, floating upwards and bursting at the surface, this cycle repeating indefinitely.\nEverything was extremely calm.\nIn the lower part of the magma lake, a massive shadow lay quietly sleeping in the molten depths, the surrounding searing heat continuously scorching that gigantic form.\nIndeed, it was Austin in his slumber.\nYet, even magma that was said to devour flames was helpless against Austin who rested in it.\nThe searing heat underpinned that shadow's azure scale armor, which now grew increasingly lustrous and resplendent.\nWhat Austin didn't know in his slumber was that in these past months, the previously swallowed essence of fire and flame law were resonating with the surrounding magma, persistently tempering his physique.\nIn Austin's growth journey, to facilitate quick advancement, he had engulfed a massive amount of magic ore and various magic potions and crystals.\nDespite a dragon's formidable digestive capability, there still remained a significant accumulation of magic power and mineral residues left undigested, settled within Austin's body.\nThough these accretions had little impact on Austin's current rapid development, they would surely cause issues down the line.\nThis was the pitfall of seeking hasty advancement.\nBut now, after recklessly absorbing the essence of fire, the unleashed massive amounts of fire elements and flame law origins were vigorously coursing within his body, in synergy with the extreme temperature of the external magma.\nIt was as though two iron hammers persistently forged Austin.\nUnder the formidable impact of fire elements, Austin resembled an iron ore brimmed with impurities, being hammered and forged thousands upon thousands of times, expelling the impurities while metals and minerals coalesced into bones and scales, with accumulated magic within penetrating into the flesh and blood under intense heat.\nIn this process, Austin's dragon body underwent comprehensive refinement, with both the defensive power of scales and his strength significantly elevated.\nIt could be said that through this round of refinement, Austin's dragon body was now comparably stronger than a century-old young dragon in every way.\nOf course, it could not compare to an adult giant dragon, for they undergo qualitative transformation upon reaching legendary status, which was not merely about enhanced defenses.\nIn any case, this was a blessing disguised in hardship, with the original ailments which had accumulated now becoming the sustenance for his growth.\nThe mere body refinement itself contributed to a power increase of no less than thirty percent for Austin.\nMoreover,\nwith an even more formidable dragon body, Austin's future prospects have become increasingly vast.\nHowever,\nthe refinement of his dragon body was merely an incidental benefit of recklessly devouring the essence of fire.\nThis bodily enhancement could only be deemed a pleasant surprise.\nThe real gains lay in two other aspects.\nLevel and Law.\nThese two were Austin's initial goals in slaying the Elemental Lord.\nAnd it seems now his original objectives are nearing fruition.\nUnderneath the molten rock, Austin slept quietly, during this period of dormancy, his physique undergoing rapid transformation, the oppressive aura continuously rising, resembling a lurking prehistoric beast in the deep mountains.\nAfter an indeterminate amount of time,\nthat massive shadow abruptly moved, the closed eyelids slowly opened.\nAs those crimson pupils fully opened,\nat this moment,\noutside the world, a mass of black as ink, heavy as a mountain cloud suddenly gathered, billowing layer upon layer, shrouding the entire sky, cloaking the heaven and earth.\nRumble!!!\nThe wind gale wailed, lightning rent the sky.\nA colossal, terrifying aura descended between heaven and earth, inducing sheer bewilderment and dread!",

      "content": "With Austin's awakening, the external world's weather suddenly changed.\nUnder the heavy clouds, the sky over the volcano dimmed, as if it was excluded from heaven and earth.\nWind and thunder gathered, and the earth surged with internal fire.\nAn invisible shockwave swept through the world, stirring a massive elemental tide.\nAt this moment, whether it was the beastman officer defending near the volcano or the Dragon Nest Beastmen Legion at the forest's edge, they all looked toward the area of that peak.\n\"His Highness has awakened!\"\nAccompanying that oppressive force akin to a forthcoming storm, a pressure hundreds or even thousands of times stronger swept through like a tsunami, dark red magma burst open, splitting and scattering in the air, while above, a storm connecting heaven and earth descended with thunder and lightning ripping through the void.\nLike a primordial giant beast, slowly rising from the magma lake amidst the dancing wind, thunder, and lightning, flames erupted.\nHigh in the sky, Austin slowly spread his wings, immense divine might unfolded.\nAt this moment, that enormous figure seemed to become the center of the world, absorbing all gazes between heaven and earth, overshadowing all brilliance above and below!\n\"It's finally successful!\"\nThough his dragon body was in slumber for half a year, Austin was well aware of how poor his physical condition was back then.\nFortunately, at his growth rate at the time, he was about to enter a slumber, followed by an outburst of the essence of fire and Flame Law, severely injuring himself and triggering his body's protective mechanism to enter hibernation early.\nUpon waking from this slumber, not only did all previous injuries inside him vanish completely, but his level cultivation also improved significantly.\n\"Golden High Tier pinnacle, plus the Flame Law Origin, not bad.\"\nAlthough this recklessness was very dangerous, the gains after the danger were undoubtedly immense.\nThe level increase not only saved Austin years of honing, but also further advanced his own level.\nMost importantly, now, by devouring the essence of fire left by the Fire Elemental Lord, he mastered the Flame Law.\nThe power of the law is ultimately the most important.\nAfter thoroughly releasing the long-dormant momentum, Austin deftly descended from the sky, surrounded by the wind element, landing on a solid volcanic rock.\nHowever,\nAt the moment Austin applied a bit of force to steady himself, that enormously large and incredibly hard volcanic rock instantly shattered with a crack, splitting into pieces in no time.\n\"This is...\"\nOnly at this moment did Austin discover the changes in his own body.\nThe azure scales exuded a metallic luster, the previously somewhat rounded edges now sharp and distinct. The entire dragon body had grown to over eight or nine meters, the enormous body overshadowed everything, and its weight had increased several times!\nThe feeling was like transforming from a wooden structure to an iron one.\nAustin knocked his scales with his forepaw, faintly hearing a sound of metal clashing.\nIf before, his body scales were as hard as rock, now they were entirely transformed into an iron-clad physique!\n\"Didn't expect such a benefit.\"\nReflecting on the cause and effects, Austin understood in his heart.\nThis should relate to the essence of fire and Flame Law Origin he devoured back then.\nThe external blazing lava and surging internal fire element forged his body like ore, finally condensing it into the current steel-like physique.\n\"A pleasant surprise.\"\nIt's not just an improvement in defense and strength, even the total magic power increased drastically after his body was tempered.\nThe Thunder Forging Body technique previously stimulated his body, but as Austin's strength increased, its effect waned. Now perhaps magma could be used for further tempering.\nAustin couldn't help but think.\n\"Golden High Tier pinnacle, powers of three law origins, coupled with the tempered strong body, once I sort things out, I might even be confident to battle a genuine, unrestricted Half-Legendary!\"\nFeeling the overwhelming power within him, a surge of confidence involuntarily rose from the depths of his heart.\nStanding high, looking at the endless mountain ranges in the distance, Austin felt the shackles on his shoulders lighten even more.\nHalf-Legendary, already half a step into the Legendary Realm.\nSuch an existence is almost at the peak within the entire Kawa Great Forest.\nIf it were the previous Austin, although he could escape from any threat below Legendary, he would have to abandon the Clan Tribe that he arduously built and flee disgracefully.\nBut now, even against a genuine Half-Legendary, he wouldn't have the slightest fear.\nPerhaps he could even escape from a Legendary.\nBoth safety and stability have greatly improved.\nThis adventure was worth it!\nJust as Austin's thoughts drifted, the Dragon Nest Beastmen were rapidly gathering below the volcano.\nThe disturbance caused by Austin's awakening had naturally alarmed the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nAs the undisputed master of the entire Dragon's Nest, the vast tribe's founder, such an event as the end of his hibernation was naturally to be visited in homage.\nSeeing this, Austin directly flew down from the mountain peak.\nHow long he had been asleep, how much time had passed, how the tribe was doing, he didn't know.\nHe needed to understand well.\n...\nWith Austin's emergence, the previously tense atmosphere of the Dragon's Nest Tribe began to ease, and the news quickly spread across the entire Dragon's Nest Tribe, causing quite a stir of cheers.\nThe Dragon Nest Beastmen, deeply reverent to Austin, were genuinely thrilled by his safety.\nMeanwhile, the war status was also revoked.\nMost of the beastman soldiers started returning to the Tribe Main City, dispersing to various defense zones, and began clearing the giant beasts and magic beasts rampaging during the cold winter.\nIn the cold winter season, there are always some ferocious hunters who failed to store enough food in the hot summer, prowling around the forest terrain.\nThese starving hunters are extremely dangerous, and to prevent them from attacking the tribe settlements, the Dragon Nest Legion had to regularly patrol and clean up the periphery.\nNow with Austin's hibernation over, the second stronghold doesn't require so many guards, thus a large force was redeployed to join the guarding and clearing of the Tribe Main City and the first stronghold.\nRecalling when Austin was still weak, when the Dragon Nest Tribe was newly established, the entire Clan Tribe had merely a handful of members, during the cold winter they could only huddle in their nests to avoid danger, trembling with fear.\nYet, within just a few years, the elite beastman legion could not only venture out freely but also actively strike against those hunters posing potential threats to the tribe.\nTransforming from shivering prey into rampant hunters.\nThe vicissitudes of life, as such.\nDuring the half year when Austin slept, the Dragon Nest Tribe maintained a stable development.\nSince the Dragon Nest Tribe adopted a contraction strategy, without large-scale expansion, but carefully managed internal affairs, there was nothing particularly noteworthy over the entire half year period.\nVarious pioneering farming, military training, recruiting wandering beastman population, etc. have become conventional practices during the development of the Dragon Nest Tribe, with no need for Austin to worry.\nThus, following a simple report from Vini, Austin left the general affairs to them after ending his hibernation.\nToday, the Dragon Nest Tribe has most of its affairs decided by a few senior elders voting, similar to some kind of council system, with representatives in civilian affairs, military, medical, manufacturing, and other departments.\nMajor affairs, in the absence of Austin, are typically decided by these representatives' votes.\nUnburdened by the tribe's complex management affairs, Austin did not immediately return to the Dragon Nest Tribe Main City.\nWhile in slumber below the volcano, Austin felt,\nAn unease hidden deep within the magma's veins.\nHe needed to explore this place,\nWhy was there elemental life here, what exactly was the source of everything?\nWithout clarifying certain things, Austin truly felt restless.",

      "content": "Rumble!\nAt the bottom of the Volcanic Cluster Domain, the scorching lava echoed like the tide.\nAustin, like a giant swimming fish, dived deep into the magma layer.\nWith excellent eyesight, he saw the lava area ahead, where brilliant glows circulated, like a giant vortex twisting in the void.\nIt seemed as if the space beneath the magma was in turmoil at that point.\n\"This is it!\"\nThis was the source of the upheaval in Austin's heart during his slumber.\nWhat could it be?\nAustin flapped his wings, arriving before the void vortex, contemplating in his heart.\nThe appearance of the Fire Elemental Lord and numerous Fire Elementals in the Prime Material Plane was likely related to this void vortex within the lava.\nHe had explored the entire Volcanic Cluster Domain and only found this anomaly at this location.\n\"The Power of Space is surging, could the other side be a Fire Elemental Plane?\"\nAustin pondered involuntarily.\nPerhaps a Fire Elemental Plane created this loophole connecting to the Prime Material Plane, allowing the Elemental Lord and numerous elemental creatures to breach into this world.\nBut still, something seemed amiss.\nAustin didn't dwell on it. He stared dazedly at the void vortex.\nIf indeed the other side is an Elemental Plane, does it mean there are many Half-Legendary creatures like Fire Elemental Lords there?\nMight he be able to lure them into the Prime Material Plane, where their strength would be significantly weakened, making them easy prey for him?\nIn an instant, hundreds or thousands of plans flashed through Austin's mind.\nGo take a look.\nAustin felt a bit eager.\nIf he could indeed lure eight or ten Half-Legendary Fire Elemental Lords and then hunt them in the Prime Material Plane, his path to becoming Legendary might not be far off.\nThink and act!\nThus, Austin flapped his wings and darted toward the void vortex.\nAs his body touched the spatial vortex, Austin distinctly felt a repelling force, as if it was preventing him from entering.\n\"Can't enter?\"\nA sinking feeling crept into Austin's heart. No wonder the Fire Elemental Lord and those numerous fire creatures hadn't left the Prime Material Plane; their retreat was cut off.\nJust let it go.\nHowever, just as Austin was about to give up and leave, a thin force within him suddenly flickered and vanished.\n\"What was that?\"\nThe trace of thin power appeared and disappeared too quickly; Austin only felt a vague familiarity, but the next moment, the void vortex suddenly burst with powerful attraction, swallowing his entire body instantly.\nNot good!\nHis vision suddenly went dark. The light around him vanished rapidly, giving the sensation of being spun rapidly inside a washing machine.\nAustin struggled to resist, feeling a powerful force tearing at his body, as if trying to rip him apart.\nIf not for his dragon body having been tempered and becoming incredibly strong, he might have been severely injured at the first moment.\nFortunately, this change came and went quickly, in just a breath; all the anomalies disappeared. Austin, like a stone, spun down from the sky, crashing onto the ground.\nBoom!\nLike a heavy iron statue swirling down from the sky, cracking the ground open and raising a cloud of dust and smoke.\nHe hastily scrambled up, warily scanning his surroundings.\nNo danger.\nHowever, as the world shifted, the previous magma lake had disappeared, as if he had entered another world.\nA world that is dying.\nThe dim sky shrouded the land, giving an extremely oppressive feeling. The land's soil was dried up, the corpses of plants and trees lay scattered, devoid of any signs of life.\nBleak, gray, as if the whole world was heading for its final end.\nThis was the impression the world gave Austin the instant he surveyed his surroundings.\nAnd indeed, the entire spatial world was only about four or five kilometers in circumference.\nAt the edges of the space, the whole world was crumbling and dissipating in the chaotic currents outside, turning to ash, with even the space crumbling within the gray fissures.\nThis spatial world is dying!\nMoreover, it's nearing its final moment of demise.\n\"It's not an Elemental Plane, what a trouble.\"\nLooking around, Austin's heart sank.\nEven though he hadn't seen an Elemental Plane, he knew it would never be like this.\n\"The Fire Elemental Lord and those Fire Elementals must have escaped from here. Does this mean it's a spatial world of some Great Divine Power User traversing the Multi-universe?\"\nAustin pondered heavily.\nThen, how to get back?\nThe void vortex that brought him here had disappeared; the entire spatial world seemed established within chaos, continually dissipating under chaos erosion.\nThe retreat was gone. Must he and this spatial world be eroded by chaos and dissipate into nothingness together?\nFor a moment, faint regret sprouted in Austin's heart.\nHe should have realized earlier.\nIf the void vortex led to an Elemental Plane, why would the Fire Elemental Lord and its race leave and relocate to the Prime Material Plane?\nTo them, the Prime Material Plane was like foul, stinky water to fish.\nSome irresistible power must have driven them to abandon their homeland and live in polluted water.\nWhile the Fire Elementals fled the place, he rushed in.\nHowever, the trace of regret only flickered briefly.\nWasting time regretting past actions was not Austin's style.\nSince I've come, let it be. Exploring might unveil a grand opportunity for ascendance.\nThinking of this, Austin's mood improved.\nHe stepped forward, walking slowly onward.\nIn this dilapidated, near-destroyed spatial world, in the center, obscured by a forest of gigantic, demon-like dry trees clawing at the sky, seemed to lie a structure.\nIt, too, was the most noticeable part of the spatial world, perhaps containing some answers.\nCautiously moving through the dry forest,\nNo surprises.\nSoon, he arrived at a former garden.\nThe former.\nFrom the dead, withered corpses of flowers, plants, and trees, one could vaguely see the garden's past glory.\nBut, ultimately it had perished.\nThere was no vitality, only withered, yellow-leafed plants remaining.\nMuch like this spatial world nearing its final demise, the plants shriveled, like sunset's elderly.\nJust as he was about to leave, suddenly,\nWhoosh!\nAn arrow of water shot out, striking Austin's tough scales with a metallic clang.\nThis water arrow packed the punch of some small-sized bullets.\nBut in front of Austin's scales, it couldn't even leave a white mark.\n\"Water Elemental? Since when!\"\nHe turned abruptly, his expression immediately growing serious.\nUnbeknownst to him, a midnight-blue Water Elemental stood behind a withered old tree, its mouth wide open—it was the one that had just fired the water arrow.\nA Bronze Level Water Elemental alone couldn't make Austin serious.\nBut one by one, Water Elementals began appearing from between the surrounding forests.\nAt the same time, a vast Elemental Power surged through the decayed Celestial Secret Force Field, with a torrent of powerful Water Attribute Power sweeping across the sky.\nWater Elemental Lord!",

between the forests, slowly encircling around.\n\"What the hell is this place?!\"\nThe appearance of these numerous water elements made Austin certain that the Fire Elemental Lord he had previously killed must have escaped from here.\nAt the same time, they detained both the Half-Legendary Realm Fire Elemental Lord and Water Elemental Lord, along with so many great elemental creatures.\nWho exactly is the master of this broken world?\nWithout giving Austin much time to think, the water elements in front of him launched an attack.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nA tremendous roar echoed, as the Water Elemental Lord stirred up massive tidal waves in the void, surging towards Austin's direction.\nAt the same time, the army of water elements under its command launched attacks on Austin, with Water Arrow Techniques shooting out obscuring the sky, like a dense storm.\nAny creature below the Legendary Level would probably have to avoid such overwhelming attacks.\nCrash!\nAmid the huge sound of the tides, Austin felt like he was the enemy of the entire world at that moment.\nHowever, Austin was no ordinary being.\nAs a giant dragon, he naturally possessed many advantages that other beings could not have.\n\"Hmph, if it were half a year ago, I would indeed have trouble dealing with you, but now!\"\nAustin snorted coldly, flapping his massive wings to create a wild gale, as his enormous body soared into the sky.\nJust as he ascended, the tsunami roared and surged, covering the area where Austin had first stood.\nThe massive tidal impact caused large swathes of withered trees to screech in agony, snapping under the torrents and being swept away beneath Austin's form.\nHowever, the tsunamis raised by the Water Elemental Lord were ultimately limited, and once Austin flew high into the sky, all the tsunamis became futile.\nEven the Water Arrow Techniques fired by the tens of thousands of water elements failed to hit Austin, as he perfectly dodged all attacks.\n\"Not much different from the Fire Elemental Lord.\"\nAustin realized,\nthat even in this unknown broken world, the Water Elemental Lord seemed weakened by some force, perhaps only three or four-tenths of its full power.\nJust like the Fire Elemental Lord before.\nHalf a year ago, to handle the Fire Elemental Lord, Austin had to use all his means, even pulling the Dragon Nest Tribe army onto the battlefield for hunting assistance.\nBut now, after a significant power increase following his slumber, Austin had the confidence to single-handedly kill the Fire Elemental Lord!\n\"Thunderstorm!\"\nFrom high above, Austin let out a deep roar, his wings beating, and the massive membrane wings spreading wide in the air.\nSimultaneously, the laws within him were activated, causing the entire Celestial Secret Force Field to tremble, and the wind and black thunder elements surged violently.\nRumble!\nThe thunderous roar of lightning echoed through the sky and earth, accompanied by blinding light tearing through the sky.\nFierce hurricanes swept between heaven and earth, the exploding thunder split and crackled within the dark storm.\nA spectacular scene as if the end of the world was about to arrive!\nAs Austin invoked his Talent Magic, it seemed as if thousands of strands of lightning blossomed above the entire sky, and in an instant, they all poured down from the heavens.\nBoom boom boom!\nBolts of lightning struck down from the sky, connecting with each other like a chain of lightning, creating an immensely powerful attack.\nOne by one, water elements shattered and crumbled under the barrage of thunder and lightning, including the towering Water Elemental Lord, enveloped in thousands of bolts, its body immobilized by electric paralysis.\nThunder restrains water!\nThough the Water Elemental Lord didn't disintegrate like other water elements at first sight, it still lost its ability to move amidst the spreading lightning!\nAustin didn't know if a potential elemental incompatibility existed in this world, nor did he have the time to ponder such unrelated things.\nPress the attack!\nThat was the first thought that emerged in his mind.\nBuzz buzz buzz!\nThe void began to twist under an invisible force, and within a breath's time, five or six Rasengan with a diameter of one meter appeared, the rapidly rotating Magic Power emitting a whooshing sound.\nSoon, the light enveloped them, and in an instant, attribute changes aligned with Austin's will occurred within the Rasengan, as multicolored Rasengan appeared high above, with such terrifying power that even the vacuum seemed to distort.\n\"Go!\"\nWithout hesitation, Austin flapped his wings, and six differently colored Rasengan suddenly plummeted from high above, with long fiery tails, crashing down onto the Water Elemental Lord.\nBoom boom boom!!!\nA series of continuous explosions sounded, as the Water Elemental Lord was instantly engulfed by erupting flames, thunder, storms, and other powerful Magic energies.\nThe entire ground quaked violently for a while, the visible shock wave sweeping out, lifting swathes of earth, and a hurricane arose.\nThe intense explosion aftermath lasted for quite a while before finally subsiding.\nUpon closer inspection, there seemed to be no more movement.\nHowever, just as Austin slightly relaxed, suddenly,\nSwish swish swish!\nDozens or hundreds of water whips suddenly extended out from the smoke and dust, piercing through space, interweaving into a net in mid-air, attempting to entangle and bind Austin.\nSeeing those twisting water whips like serpents slithering towards him, Austin was alarmed but showed no sign of tension, as he lightly flapped his wings, gracefully shifting his massive form through the air before the water whips could reach him, making them miss their target.\nAt this moment, Austin opened his giant mouth, preparing to counterattack.\nSince thunder could restrain water, and during the assault on the fire element, Water Attribute Magic dealt double damage to the fire elements, would Fire Attribute techniques, in turn, inflict more damage on the water elements?\nWith that thought flashing through his mind, Austin occupied no more hesitation, as a vast amount of Magic Power gathered at his will in front of him, forming a huge Rasengan.\nBut it wasn't finished yet; a spark of flame flickered at the center of the Rasengan and then swiftly spread and expanded, covering the entire Rasengan.\nThe transformation of the Fire Attribute Rasengan!\nAs the internal flames completed their transformation, the rapidly spinning Fire Attribute Power perhaps reached thousands to tens of thousands of degrees Celsius, with the air temperature abruptly rising, the searing heat nearly contorting the void.\nThe next moment, the massive Fire Elemental Rasengan, carrying overwhelming heat waves, descended onto the Water Elemental Lord enshrouded in smoke and dust.",

      "content": "The intensely concentrated Fire Element, within the Rasengan, spins at an unbelievably rapid speed, producing a temperature that even a meter away can melt steel, not to mention the terrifying high heat generated inside the highly condensed Fire Element.\nIt's like a small sun falling from the sky, shaking the firmament, its radiant light sweeping the entire dim earth like a tide.\nAt this moment, the Water Elemental Lord, as tall as a small mountain, is pinned to the ground by the wildly dancing electric snakes shot from all directions. The paralyzing effect of the current has an amplified effect on the pure Water Element-bodied Water Elemental Lord.\nIt can only watch helplessly as the scorching Flame Fire Rasengan descends from the sky, bringing with it a surge of heat that directly impacts its body.\nBOOM!!!\nThe Flame Fire Rasengan bursts explosively, first rising into a gigantic, rapidly spinning blindingly bright spherical light on the ground. The visibly crashing shockwave impacts heaven and earth like a tide, and the terrifying waves of fire sweep upwards, instantly clearing a large area.\nFWOOM FWOOM FWOOM...\nHot flames curl and twist in the void, raising the temperature of the entire broken world space.\nAfter a while, the flames burning all around finally dissipate, but the withered vegetation has already turned to ash, and even the soil on the earth has been burned through to a dark red, with a radius of ten meters around the center point liquefied into a thick layer of glass-like lava, emitting a hot glow.\nResidual flames crackle and burn among the dried-up woods.\nAustin gazes into the distance, and the Fire Elemental Lord at the original spot has vanished, leaving only a mass of dreamy blue, galaxy-like Essence of Water!\nThis is the core of the Water Elemental Lord, condensed with the vast Essence of Water using the Water Elemental Law Origin as its spine.\nAustin descends from high above, looking at the alluring Essence of Water in front of him and sensing the rapidly dispersing Water Elemental Law Origin within it.\nAfter some thought, he bites his lip and decides to open his mouth and swallow it.\nDespite the disastrous consequences after swallowing the Essence of Fire last time, which left his body in severe injuries, it took him quite a while to recover through slumber.\nEven though the lesson from last time was still fresh, Austin couldn't help but covet the Essence of Water before him.\nAfter all, the Water Element is not like the Fire Element, less violent, it should pose no issue, right?\nHe had once wielded a Water Attribute Rasengan and already understood the gentle nature of Water Elemental Power, which was precisely why Austin decided to swallow the Essence of Water before him.\nAs for himself, who seemed to have sworn not too long ago to never consume any Elemental Energy Essence or Law Origin:\nDid I? Was there really?\nAbsolutely not.\nHe swallowed it in one gulp, Austin stood at the spot, awaiting the impact of the vast Water Element and the Law of Water.\nOne second, two seconds, three seconds...\nExcept for a bloated stomach feeling as if he drank a bellyful of water, nothing happened.\nAustin was perplexed, could it be that he did not swallow the Essence of Water and the Water Law Origin?\nCould it be fake?\nWhere was the intense pain? The explosive sensation from elemental impact? That feeling of living and dying?\nWhenever he consumed a Law Origin, he was overwhelmed by the rampaging Elemental Power, making him feel like he's dying, why is it different now?\nAustin focused inward, his spirit scanning through his body.\nThe Water Element and Water Law Origin didn't want to engage with him, and even rolled its eyes at him.\nAustin stood there, pondering for quite a while and finally understood the reason.\nNo major aftermath, for two reasons:\nFirstly, compared to the wind or fire he formerly consumed, the Water Element is relatively more docile.\nEspecially without the mixture of other forces, the Water Element behaves like a quiet beautiful man.\nUsing Daoist terminology, water represents gentleness.\nBecause of its gentleness, the impact wasn't intense.\nUnlike the previously consumed wind and fire, which, once devoured, were like wilful mustangs resisting desperately as if their virtue was being encroached upon.\nSecondly, Austin has become stronger.\nNot only in terms of Level Realm advancement but also in mastering Law Control.\nAfter the last absorption of Essence of Fire, and the refinement beneath the magma lake, Austin's Dragon Body has been greatly enhanced.\nA stronger physique has given him even more powerful sealing suppression capability.\nTo the devoured Elemental Power, if Austin's body used to be like a wooden prison, now it's forged from steel.\n\"That's good, in the future it will be much easier to devour and refine Law Origins.\"\nAustin was quite pleased.\nOne can't help but be pleased, after all, nobody is a masochist.\nIf one can devour and refine peacefully, why go through torment?\n\"However, to thoroughly refine it, I still need to go back and take the time to grind slowly.\"\nSwallowing into the belly does not mean that Austin has refined the vast Elemental Magic Power and Attribute Law Origin into his own.\nCurrently, he has merely set them aside.\n\"Speaking of this, once I return, I should be able to master the Law Divine Swords of four attributes. I wonder if relying on the Law Divine Swords of four attributes, an attack mode similar to the Immortal Slaying Sword Array can be formed.\"\nUpon applying the Law Divine Swords, with the number of mastered laws increasing, Austin does not intend to follow the path of Wind and Thunder Dual Swords Unification, going all the way to three, four, or even five sword fusions.\nPerhaps later, the Multi-Sword Fusion could be explored to massively enhance attack capabilities, but developing other techniques based on the Law Divine Swords is also very necessary.\nThe Immortal Slaying Sword Array was one of Austin's initial thoughts.\nThat sword array, originating from the primordial chaos, was said to be unbreakable by anyone but the Four Saints.\nPerhaps a slightly modified version of my own, capable of being broken only by four Legendary rank individuals, would be ridiculously formidable.\n\"But wouldn't that be overdone, others take down a Saint with a single sword, while you struggle to fight a Legendary rank, or maybe a broken Four Spirits Sword Array could work as well.\"\n\"Cyan Dragon leading thunder, White Tiger leading wind, Vermilion Bird leading fire, Black Tortoise leading water, the Four Holy Beasts precisely correspond to thunder, wind, fire, and water laws, this idea is workable.\"\nAustin's thoughts wandered broadly for quite some time before reining in.\nAdjusting slowly when I return, the most critical matter now is to find a way out.\nAfter composing himself, he continued to explore forward.\nWalking along a path, passing through dense withered trees.\nAustin arrived at the fragmented and ruinous plaza.\nA massive plaza with cracks everywhere, the indeterminate flooring material dull and crumbling, covered with dust, cracks filled with weeds, abandoned for who knows how many years.\nAt the end of the plaza stands a church.\nA dim, desolate, and collapsed large church building.",

      "content": "The church was very old, with parts of it collapsing, and the walls covered in dust, looking abandoned for an unknown length of time.\nWeeds were overgrown, and the buildings were dilapidated, just like the crumbling, abandoned churches Austin had seen in some Western horror films in his past life.\nHowever, the towering structure still faintly displayed its former glory.\n\"Church, what exactly is this place?\"\nAustin furrowed his brows.\nA world on the brink of destruction, a being suspected to traverse the Multi-universe, an Elemental Race, and this church…\nVarious speculations flashed through his mind.\nYet, he found no clues.\nInside, there might be the answers I need to know.\nStaring deep into the church, a feeling suddenly arose in Austin's heart.\nAfter pondering for a moment, Austin walked forward.\nStep by step, there came a rustling sound all around.\nNo danger, seemingly over-cautious, yet Austin remained completely uneasy.\nPassing through the shattered church door came a long corridor hall.\nVast, and eerie silence.\nAn unmistakable rotten smell permeated the air, as if Austin smelled the scent of the end of all things.\nOn both sides of the corridor stood angel statues.\nBut these angel statues were broken, their wings behind shattered, heads and feet missing, full of cracks, as if smashed by a hammer.\nThese broken statues were arranged very neatly, almost letting one see through the river of time the majesty of their glorious past.\n\"Where exactly is this place?\"\nWith deep curiosity, Austin slowly walked forward.\nThis path was filled with darkness and solitude, accompanied only by the statues of fallen angels, seemingly endless.\nHe did not know how much time had passed,\nFinally, the scene before his eyes opened explosively, becoming spacious.\nThis was the end of the Divine Hall.\nThere, an old priest was kneeling on the ground, confessing to a half-destroyed statue of a Divine on the high platform.\nThe old priest was very old, even turning his back to Austin, he could see the skin wrinkled like tree bark.\nA beam of light shone from the top, enveloping the figure of the old priest.\nThe whole Divine Hall gave a feeling of warmth and harmony.\nAnyone who saw the scene before them would feel a genuine sense of peace.\nHowever, Austin indeed felt a chilling sensation rise from the bottom of his heart.\nBecause the figure of the old priest was illusory.\nJust like a beam of light's projection.\nBut Austin knew that this world should not yet have holographic projection technology.\nSo, the old priest should be a ghost, a specter.\nThe old priest seemed completely unresponsive to Austin's arrival, continuing to confess to the collapsed Divine statue on the high platform in the Divine Hall.\nThe whole hall echoed with the old priest's calm, reassuring voice.\nThis slightly comforted Austin, feeling that even if it was a ghost, it might be a benevolent one.\nAustin remained silent, and the old priest ignored him.\nHe did not know how much time had passed, just as Austin could not help but speak.\nWhoosh whoosh whoosh…\nSuddenly, the sound of wind came from all around.\nIt seemed like something was quickly approaching!\nAustin's gaze sharpened, only to see black figures seemingly flowing out from the darkness, like Asura phantoms, with grinning faces flying from all directions.\nDarkness, darkness devouring everything, like shadows peeled off from the darkness, with unsettling grins exposed.\nFaintly amid the wind, Austin seemed to hear something singing.\nLike devilish whispers full of seductive allure, darkened Divine Souls.\n\"What is that!\"\nLooking at those ink-black figures surging from the dark like a tide, seemingly about to engulf him along with the entire Divine Hall.\nA heart jolt for Austin, inside his body the Thunder Law instantly activated, moving the Thunder Element through the void.\nCrackle!\nBolts of thunder were born in the void, sweeping across like tearing space apart, those shadows under the thunder's strike vanished like sun-melted snow with eerie howls.\nHe did not know if hundreds or thousands of bolts of lightning exploded at this moment, the entire Divine Hall illuminated by the lightning flash.\nThe ink-black shadows like tides around were smashed into ash by the thunder strikes, and the distant ones seeing this seemed so scared, dispersed immediately like birds and beasts.\nSerenity returned all around.\nThe aged priest was still confessing.\nIf not for the faint feeling of being watched by something from the dark, Austin might have thought everything just now was a hallucination.\n\"Old father, what were those just now?\"\nWeighing his words, Austin asked.\n\"...Divine Abominations.\"\nUnexpectedly, the old priest stopped his confession, his ancient scratchy voice echoed in the air.\nThat feeling, like a puppet about to wind down, producing the final sound, seemed full of a sense of bygone history's weight.\n\"Divine Abominations?\"\nAustin slightly frowned, this term he seemed to have not heard before.\n\"Just as stars shining in the starry sky may fall… the almighty Lord… can also fall… once the lambs' faith collapses… seduced by the devil… they become Divine Abominations.\"\nWith the old priest's residual soul's hoarse voice intermittently echoing in the surrounding silent space, it nearly stirred up stormy waves in Austin's heart.\nWhat do these words mean?\nCould it be that the lofty Divines would one day fall to death from the exalted sky?\nThis is simply unimaginable!\nAstonishment filled Austin's heart.\nSuddenly, he recalled the bizarre state of this spatial world, with an incredible suspicion arising in his mind.\n\"Could this be the former Divine Kingdom?\"\nThe dense voice emerged from his mouth, Austin stared meticulously at the phantom of the old priest ahead.\nThe old priest did not respond, continuing to silently face the collapsed Divine statue on the high platform, looking repentant.\nSilence is the best answer.\nIndeed, this was once a Divine Kingdom, now a fallen Divine's domain!\nOnly in a Divine Kingdom, would there be Elemental Lords and numerous Elemental Races.\nBecause only the timeless, endless Divines would have time to capture countless Elemental Lives to adorn the glory of the Divine Kingdom.\nOnly in a Divine Kingdom, would there be such a grand church Divine Hall, almost an entire space world built around it.\nThe shadows outside the Divine Hall were likely once countless Heroic Spirit Warriors who battled for the Divine.\nThey were once fervent believers of the Divine, granted eternal life in the Divine Kingdom after death.\nHowever, when the Divine fell, the faith sustaining their hearts collapsed in a single moment, ultimately degenerating into Divine Abominations wandering in darkness!\nJust what kind of upheaval happened for even the seemingly immortal Divines to eventually fall?!!!",

      "content": "What exactly happened, even the Divine fell among it, the Divine Kingdom broken and collapsed, and the once heroic believers fell, turning into Divine abominations?\nWhy on earth did a Divine Kingdom fall near the Kawa Great Forest?\nCountless doubts surged from the depths of his heart, Austin stared at the old priest in front of him, his gaze full of inquiry.\nHowever, the expected answer was not given.\n\"Child... you have faith within you... this is why you could come here.\"\nThe remnant of the old priest became illusory at this moment, but his consciousness seemed to regain clarity.\nIt was like a final gasp of clarity.\n\"The Lord abandoned us... the most important thing in the Divine Kingdom has been taken away... you being able to come here... is guided by destiny, and also your opportunity.\"\nThe old priest's voice was intermittent, and his illusory figure began to flicker, as if he might disappear at any moment.\n\"Unfortunately, there's nothing left here... let me give you a final push.\"\nAs the voice fell, the old priest turned around.\nUnderneath the wrinkled face, there were eyes wise beyond comparison, as if seeing through everything.\nThat gaze seemed to pierce through the river of time.\nIn that instant, Austin seemed to see a young man rising from insignificance, battling the heavens and the earth, finally leaving a mark in the river of time.\nEpic!\nAt that moment, the thought suddenly flashed through Austin's mind.\nThe old priest before his eyes was actually an Epic Remnant Soul!\nOnly an existence of Epic Level could leave footprints in the river of time.\nLegendary, merely a legend of the present.\nBut Epic, could leave traces in the river of time, a saga sung through thousands of years!\nThis Divine Kingdom, was like a tomb about to collapse.\nAnd the Epic Remnant Soul old priest before him, was like the last Tomb Guardian!\nThoughts surged violently in Austin's mind.\nAnd at this moment, the old priest and Austin were separated by a distance of a dozen meters, and he pointed with one finger.\nThat finger seemed to traverse through layers of space, shimmering with tides of brilliance.\nNo, it should be said that the space of a dozen meters between Austin and the old priest was compressed into a mirror.\nThat illusory finger appeared before his eyes, pierced through the mirror, and pointed at Austin's head.\nAustin, clearly eight or nine meters tall, like a massive small mountain.\nThe old priest before him, no more than about 1.7 meters.\nIn front of Austin, just like a baby before an adult.\nYet at this moment, in the blazing tides of light, Austin only felt the old priest before him become incomparably towering, countless shadows behind him forming an epic that spanned the river of time.\nUnder this vast and magnificent power, Austin felt more like an infant.\nAustin did not resist, nor could he resist.\nJust a remnant soul on the verge of collapse already suppressed him, motionless.\nIt was an indescribable power, a divine might above time!\nClang!\nWhen that illusory finger touched Austin's head, he seemed to hear a crisp echo of metal clashing.\nSoon after, a mysterious and unfathomable sensation spread throughout his body.\nAs if a barrier had been broken through, Austin's aura poured out like a flood bursting through a dam.\nHalf-Legendary!\nThe old priest's remnant soul pointed out, allowing Austin to directly surpass the peak of Gold, stepping into the realm of Half-Legendary!\nThis was simply unbelievable!\nFeeling the surging, tide-like power within his body, feeling the rapidly growing Law Origin, waves of shock surged in Austin's heart.\nEpic above Legendary was actually so powerful?!\nWhat Austin didn't know was that this finger that sent him into the Half-Legendary wasn't as simple as it seemed.\nThat was the last gathering of Time Power by the Epic Remnant Soul old priest, and it was the old priest's gift to Austin who had accidentally barged into the Divine Kingdom at the last moment.\nMoreover, during the process of enlightenment, the vast Essence of Water that Austin had previously swallowed also played an extremely important role.\nThe old priest's finger that pierced through space also refined the Essence of Water and the Water Law Origin he had swallowed, the tremendous energy produced interacted with the Time Power of that old priest's finger, pushing Austin's level cultivation to the bottleneck of the peak of Gold, ultimately shattering the wall blocking the path to Legendary, leading directly into the Half-Legendary Realm with the remnants of Time Power.\nIf not for the prior Essence of Water, the current level cultivation could only rise to the extent of the peak of Gold.\nEven so,\nBut it was enough to see how powerful the Epic above Legendary was!\n\"Child, this is the last power sustaining the Divine Kingdom, rather than letting it linger, awaiting death, and ultimately disintegrating into nothingness, it is better to welcome its end early and fulfill its proper role.\"\nThe old priest's figure grew increasingly illusory, taking out a crystalline sphere the size of a ping-pong ball from the void, passing it to Austin's claw through overlapping spaces.\nAustin's pupils suddenly contracted, it seemed he had seen this thing before!\nWithout giving him more time to think, with the extraction of that crystal, the entire Divine Kingdom suddenly shook.\nThe entire ruined world of the Divine Kingdom actually accelerated in its collapse, disintegrating at a speed visible to the naked eye, dissipating into the chaos!\nHuge cracks crossed the sky of the Divine Kingdom, even the cathedral and Divine Hall started to collapse.\nThe Divine Kingdom was collapsing!\n\"Alright then, child, I know you have many doubts in your heart, but for now, go back.\"\nPerhaps not wanting to say,\nOr perhaps there was something that couldn't be said.\nAustin clearly felt that the old priest did not intend to say much to him and was about to send him off.\nSuddenly, Austin felt a powerful spatial tearing force act on him.\nThe void spun, transforming into a giant vortex.\nBefore Austin could say anything, his entire body was swept into the vortex of void.\nAnd at this moment, the massive cracks in the Divine Kingdom's space finally reached the Divine Hall, slicing through heaven and earth.\nAt the last moment before leaving, Austin saw the old priest's remnant soul in the crumbling world of the Divine Kingdom through layers of the void.\nBecoming infinitely weak and transparent, yet the previously deep and wise eyes were now filled with confusion.\n\"Even the Divine... cannot break destiny... child, the old era has passed, I hope you... can break through that destiny predetermined for us...\"\nA faint sigh echoed in his ears.\nNext, an incredibly magnificent scene appeared before him.\nHe saw the collapsing Divine Kingdom fall like a waterfall, in the chaotic current, finally collapsing into a plane, a line, then a point, and finally disappearing into the void.\nAnd with a plop, Austin fell directly into a scorching lava lake.",

      "content": "Dragon Nest Tribe City.\nSince the day I emerged from the Divine Kingdom and witnessed the demise of a divine realm with my own eyes, several days have passed.\nInside the Dragon's Nest, Austin is summarizing and sorting out some of the events that occurred earlier.\nOnce, a Divine fell nearby,\nwhich made Austin feel horrified.\nNo matter what happened back then, once the news of a fallen Divine's realm leaks out, countless Adventurers will surely swarm to the area.\nThe nearby region will certainly be turned upside down by numerous visitors.\nAnd my secrets might be completely exposed to countless gazes.\nFortunately, things aren't as bad yet.\nAfter some investigations and interrogations.\nAccording to the native Beastmen living near the Volcanic Cluster Domain, the volcanic region has existed there for a long time.\nMaybe a few hundred years, maybe a few thousand years, or perhaps tens of thousands of years.\nNo one knows when that area formed, only that it has always been there for a long, long time.\nAmong the various bizarre terrains within the Kawa Great Forest, the entire Volcanic Cluster Domain isn't conspicuous amidst the vast Forest Land of millions of square kilometers.\nA Divine Kingdom falling from the Starry Sky, if not near the final collapse stage, would hardly form a breach in the weak parts of space.\nEven a Legendary would probably not discover a Divine Kingdom wedged in a spatial rift.\nOtherwise, if a Divine Kingdom couldn't hide itself, countless Divine would have been defied and conquered long ago.\nThis suggests that the Divine Kingdom beneath the Volcanic Cluster Domain likely hasn't been discovered.\nIf undiscovered, everything remains fine.\nMoreover, according to those native tribes, those Fire Elementals only appeared in the Volcanic Cluster Domain in recent years.\nAlso, unless a powerful creature capable of influencing them enters, those Fire Elemental creatures usually stay beneath the magma layer, hidden and not coming out.\nThis information is crucial.\nThis means that Austin might be the first to discover the anomaly in the Volcanic Cluster Domain.\nThe native Beastmen near the Volcanic Cluster Domain didn't see any Extraordinary Beastmen; they probably wouldn't venture into that newly dangerous area, nor contemplate the peculiarity of Fire Elementals appearing there.\nBeastmen living at the base level on the Kawa Great Forest, struggling between life and death their entire lives, wouldn't know what those Fire Elemental creatures are even if they saw them.\nCombining all the information, a rather definite result can be obtained: the matter of the Divine Kingdom's exposure that Austin worries about is basically unnecessary to fret over.\nFor the time being, this vicinity remains safe and secretive.\nI can still hang in there for a while.\n\"However, a few years ago...\"\nAustin pondered, silent without knowing what he was thinking.\nDuring this period, something seems off.\nIt appears that the source of all the chaos in the Forest Land caused by the undead apocalypse in the Kawa Great Forest happened just a few years ago.\nMoreover...\nIn thought, Austin casually took out two crystals and observed them closely before his eyes.\nOverall, they are crystal clear, their composition unknown.\nFocusing his gaze for a closer look, he would faintly hear chants in the void between existence, possessing a sort of hypnotic power, as if the Divine Soul itself were being absorbed.\nThe two crystals contain a power Austin cannot comprehend.\nAnd this power seems to be of the same origin!\nThe difference is that the one on the left, crystal-clear, contains no impurities, exceedingly pure.\nWhen gazing at it, the sound entering one's ears is like being in a cathedral with sacred hymns being sung, filled with holy radiance.\nWhereas in the one on the right, darkness subtly flickers at its core, and the sacred chanting in the ear carries an eerie feeling, as if countless twisted souls were praying and praising the Lord.\n\"What exactly are these things...\"\nThe one on the left is what Austin obtained from the Divine Kingdom, the last power left by the remnant soul of the old priest to maintain the existence of the Divine Kingdom.\nThe one on the right, however, was obtained after Austin's team obliterated the Zombie Undead Nest, using a super invincible world-destroying compressed wind-water-thunder Rasengan to annihilate that enormous Pyramid.\nThe two crystals, while similar, are vastly different.\nBut regardless, Austin instinctively senses a definite connection between the two!\n\"The Epic Remnant Soul mentioned that the most important thing inside the Divine Kingdom had already been taken away. Who could that person be? And what did they take? Is the undead apocalypse sweeping through the entire Kawa Great Forest related to that mysterious person who took away the most important thing from the Divine Kingdom?\"\nAustin believes that the undead apocalypse is very likely directly related to the person who took the crucial thing from the Divine Kingdom.\nOtherwise, why would the crystal obtained from the remnant soul of the old priest be so similar to the one obtained after destroying the Pyramid?\nIt gives him a feeling of being from the same source.\nThese two crystals are very likely to originate from the Divine Power Crystal of the same Divinity.\nMeaning the owner of that Divine Kingdom, the Divine who fell for unknown reasons.\nLinking multiple storylines, some inferences involuntarily arise in his heart.\nMany years ago, an unknown Divine fell, and the Divine Kingdom high above the starry sky crashed onto the Prime Material Plane.\nThe Divine Kingdom that drifted in the void's crevices ultimately fell beneath the Volcanic Cluster Domain in the Kawa Great Forest.\nAmong the heroes in the Divine Kingdom, some couldn't bear the Divine's death, ultimately falling and becoming Divine Wraiths.\nAfterwards, likely, a great battle occurred within the Divine Kingdom after the Divine's demise.\nA battle between those heroes who could maintain their sanity and the Divine Wraiths.\nEventually, within the entire Divine Kingdom, only an Epic-level old priest remained, along with a few Divine Wraiths.\nPresumably, this is also why Austin did not encounter any other powerful Divine Wraiths in the Divine Kingdom.\nThose powerful Divine Wraiths likely had been directly slain in the fierce war.\nAnd the old priest, whose wick was burned out, could no longer purge the remaining Divine Wraiths, only stay in the Divine Hall repenting.\nAfter that, who knows how many years passed.\nA mysterious figure entered the Divine Hall and took away the most crucial thing maintaining the Divine Kingdom's operation.\nAnd that figure must have a close-knit relationship with the fallen Divine.\nOtherwise, they would never know the location where the Divine Kingdom fell and could enter it at will.\nPerhaps at the last moment, as the Divine Kingdom's final Tomb Guardian, the old priest didn't even have a chance to stop them.\n\"The Lord abandoned us...\"\nRecalling the old priest's words, and all the somewhat strange actions the old priest took later.\nAustin vaguely seemed to understand something.\nHowever, the speculation was too shocking; Austin could only press it down in his heart.\n\"It is probably that mysterious figure who took the thing maintaining the Divine Kingdom, leading to the Divine Kingdom's contact with the Prime Material Plane amid its collapse, causing the escape of the Fire Elemental Lord and the Fire Elemental Race.\"\nThe front and rear connections all tied together at this moment.\nAnd that mysterious figure is very likely the culprit of all the chaos in the Kawa Great Forest in recent years.\nThey might be people from the Beastman Royal Court.\nOr perhaps that figure cooperated with pure-blooded Beastmen from the Beastman Royal Court, sparking this great calamity sweeping through the Kawa Great Forest, even though the pure-blooded Beastmen didn't know their identity.\nThe ultimate truth, perhaps only the Beastman Royal Court at the core collapsed area might possibly know.\nHowever, Austin instinctively felt it was likely more of the latter.",

      "content": "Chapter 305: Chapter 301: Seclusion Again (Second Update Asking for Subscription)\nThe general origin of the Fallen Divine Kingdom is probably like this.\nHowever, Austin had another question.\n\"The kingdom falls from the starry sky, its light illuminating the entire sky, which must have attracted countless attention. Even Legendary Level beings couldn’t pinpoint where the kingdom finally fell, but epic beings attuned to the power of time would definitely notice some clues. Why, after countless years, has that kingdom still not been discovered?\"\nDoubt suddenly arose in his heart.\nThe fall of a divine being is no small matter. It is said that the divine beings are related to the most basic rules that compose the world, the very foundation of the Prime Material Plane’s stability.\nWhen they die, the Divine Kingdom suspended in the starry sky falls like a meteor, the sky weeps with blood, and such a massive disturbance can be felt across the entire Prime Material Plane.\nAlthough the Divine Kingdom’s ability to hide is strong, after the death of a divine being, the broken kingdom can’t conceal itself from the senses of epic beings who wield the power of time.\nEpic Level beings can find the location of the kingdom through the traces of its fall.\nAny kingdom, especially one belonging to a fallen divine being, would drive even an epic being to madness!\nHowever, the kingdom beneath the Volcanic Cluster Domain remained concealed for unknown years, until recently when a mysterious person took the most important thing from it, causing the soon-to-collapse kingdom to be exposed.\nThis doesn’t quite add up.\nWhy wasn’t the kingdom discovered right when it fell?\nSuddenly, a chilling possibility arose in Austin’s mind.\nUnless,\non that day, not just this one divine being died!\nWith the fall of the gods, the stars trembled and scattered in all directions.\nCountless stars fell from the starry sky, dispersing to various places of the Prime Material Plane, the entire sky dyed red with blood, and heaven and earth mourned.\nA countless number of meteors fell from the sky, and their falling locations couldn’t be recorded or calculated.\nIt’s very likely that it was a war in which countless divine beings perished.\nIt might have even swept across the entire Prime Material Plane, with corpse mountains and blood seas everywhere, and no one cared about the fallen Divine Kingdoms.\nOnly such an occasion could allow a fallen divine being’s kingdom to remain hidden for countless years, until the moment it voluntarily revealed itself!\nThe result of this conjecture made Austin’s scalp tingle with fear.\nHe felt an overwhelming terror envelop him, which he had to suppress with difficulty and bury deep within his heart.\n\"Even the gods have died...\"\nAustin looked up, his gaze deep as he stared at the sky above.\nIf his guess was correct, he already knew the owner of that Divine Kingdom beneath the Volcanic Cluster Domain.\nWhen he entered the Divine Hall, Austin saw the huge, half-collapsed emblem on the cathedral.\nWitnessing the old priest’s shadow and the experiences along the river of time behind him, that divine being’s emblem appeared and vanished.\nThat was the Beast God’s emblem!\nIn the Kawa Great Forest, the countless lower-level Beastmen, in their difficult struggles, never stopped praying to the Beast God!\nThe Beast God may have fallen.\nTherefore, no matter how sincerely the struggling Beastmen prayed, it would never elicit a response.\nAnd the Fallen Divine Kingdom beneath the Volcanic Cluster Domain might have belonged to the former Beast God!\nAustin suddenly felt the pressure on him intensify.\nThe mysterious figure that took the most important item within the Beast God Divine Kingdom, the Beastman Royal Court at the core, the undead calamity sweeping through the entire Great Forest...\nAll these intertwined in his mind, forming a massive, dense spider web, covering the entire Great Forest area, ensnaring all creatures within, making escape impossible for any caught in it.\nNo wonder those lurking behind the Tribe Alliance, pushing everything forward, were so cautious among the Legends.\nThey probably had long noticed that the Beastman Royal Court occupying the core was not so simple.\nIt remains unknown whether some divine beings are orchestrating the downfall of the Beastman Empire remnants this time.\n\"Desecrators, could the fallen divine beings be connected to the former Beastman Empire? If such a great war causing countless divine beings to fall truly occurred, what role did the Beastman Empire play in it?\"\nMore and more questions arose in his mind,\nElf Kingdom, Beastman Empire, alliances, fallen divine beings, divine war, waves of undead calamities, and the \"preordained fate\" uttered by the old priest’s remnant soul before leaving the Divine Kingdom...\nAustin instinctively felt that there was a massive secret behind all these, but lacking information, he couldn’t make any guesses.\n\"Hah, well, these matters are beyond my reach for now.\"\nAfter pondering long without any clues, Austin sighed, burying the many questions deep in his heart.\nSome things can’t be changed, even if one knows about them.\nFaced with epic beings and divine presences wielding the power of time, what can a small Half-Legendary do but quietly watch from the sidelines and hope not to be crushed?\nFortunately, this war engulfing the entire Kawa Great Forest seems unlikely to attract such terrifying presences.\n\"Even if the old Beastman Empire was indeed linked to the brutal war causing divine falls, the current Beastman Royal Court is nothing more than the remnants of the old empire...\"\n\"Covering the tomb with the last shovelful of dirt is but the last ripple of the old war. No matter how far-reaching, no great force might get involved in this water muddle.\"\nThis counterattack to erase the Beastman Royal Court’s core may already involve the Legendary personally, so there’s no need to worry too much.\n\"But ultimately, strength is one’s true foundation!\"\nA glow of determination passed through Austin’s pupils.\nMany previous speculations may be inaccurate, but Austin had already understood one truth.\nOnly by becoming stronger can one grasp their own life and destiny!\nEven though Austin had now reached Half-Legendary, within the Kawa Great Forest, nothing could threaten his life.\nEven against a Legendary, he could escape.\nHe no longer has any survival worries at all.\nBut it’s still too weak.\nEven gods high above, deemed eternally unyielding, could fall one day. How much less could a mere Half-Legendary survive?\nFeeling the pressure of the times, Austin began to intensely enhance his own strength in seclusion.\nIndeed, not long after waking from a slumber, Austin planned to seclude for cultivation again.\nAfter delegating tribal matters to his Beastman subordinates, Austin once more retreated for cultivation.\nFortunately, it was now the cold winter period, the entire tribe had nothing significant going on, and he didn’t need to watch over constantly.\nThis allowed him to focus wholeheartedly on improving himself in seclusion.\nCurrently, Austin possessed the four laws of wind, thunder, water, and fire within him.\nYet, besides the laws of wind and thunder, he hadn’t honed the others well, and his grasp of the Law of Water and Flame Law remained at a very low level.\nThis seclusion, Austin aimed to continuously comprehend the two laws, letting the laws of water and fire reach the level of control he had over wind and thunder.\nAt the same time, he intended to forge the divine swords for the Law of Water and Flame Law, completing four Divine Swords with distinct attribute powers.\nOnce all four Law Divine Swords were crafted, he would begin developing the Four Spirits Sword Array, massively enhancing his own ability.",

      "content": "Chapter 306: Chapter 302: Magic Power Control Precision (3rd Update, Request for Subscription)\nThe saying goes, when you’re in the martial world, you have little control over your own fate.\nThe changes in the situation might involve oneself, and only strong strength is the fundamental basis for standing one’s ground.\nPreviously, there were several times when I almost got caught up in the vortex of this vast war.\nIf it weren’t for relying on my own strength, how could I peacefully cultivate and improve in seclusion?\nThe turmoil is spreading, and with each new thing Austin experiences and uncovers, he gains a deeper understanding that the source of this upheaval sweeping across the Kawa Great Forest is not simple.\nIf you want to stay out of it and protect yourself, only greater strength can be your most solid backing.\nAt this moment,\nwithin the valley where Austin often secludes himself for cultivation.\n\"The Law of Water and the Law of Fire, although already fused into my bloodline, my comprehension of these two Elemental Laws is still at zero. Additionally, the Level Cultivation has rapidly increased from Golden Middle Tier to Golden High Tier in a short period, and then quickly to Half-Legendary. My control over my own power is still quite rough and needs further practice.\"\nAustin sat cross-legged on the mountain peak, planning his previous gains and identifying the problems he needs to solve.\nThe first things to improve on are undoubtedly the mastery of the Water and Fire Laws as well as the surging power.\nAfter some thought, Austin decided to first control his suddenly increased level of power.\nAfter all, understanding the laws isn’t an overnight task, and better control of my surging Level Cultivation strength also helps in comprehending the laws.\nSo in the first few days, Austin began practicing various techniques.\nFrom close combat to various long-range attacks, and the release of various Attribute Rasengan, Austin executed them all one by one, then improved based on his insights.\nFor a time, the entire mountain range echoed with booming sounds.\nMany mountains were leveled by the aftermath of Austin’s training.\nDuring training, he discovered something quite amusing.\nStanding on a certain mountain peak, then suddenly outputting forward, regardless if it’s Rasengan or Electromagnetic Cannon or Thunder Strike, releasing them all.\nAfter several rounds of impact, the peak ahead was forcibly blasted open in the middle.\nStanding high up, looking at the clear path ahead created by his own efforts, a sense of accomplishment welled up within him.\nPush mountains aside, sever peaks, shift mountains, fill the sea.\nThe power that once only existed in fantasy is now truly in his hands, and he feels an unprecedented satisfaction.\nAfter several days of simple, crude training, Austin has generally adapted to his surging power.\nAt the very least, he could simply control the power size when using techniques like Rasengan.\nHowever, this is not enough.\nAt least not for Austin.\nTherefore, he proceeded to the next step of advanced training.\nSplitting Magic Power.\nIn previous seclusion, Austin relied on the training method of splitting Magic Power, dividing a lump of Magic Power into hairs to greatly enhance his control over his own strength.\nAt that time, after splitting training, not only did he increase the power of techniques like Rasengan while reducing consumption, but he also formed a Domain prototype through combination with Talent Magic.\nNow, Austin has reached the Half-Legendary Realm, already able to condense a Domain.\nMoreover, the Magic Power within his body, both in energy level and quantity, has undergone a tremendous enhancement.\nCompared to the time when he was just at the Golden Low Tier, the difficulty of controlling his own Magic Power has increased more than tenfold.\nAfter the splitting training, Austin became very interested in how far his enhanced precision in magic control could reach.\nThus,\nnext, the mountainous region that was booming all day became quiet.\nAustin sat cross-legged on the mountain peak, white snowflakes fell from the sky, landing on him, staining a white touch, resembling an ice sculpture.\nLike a hermit sage, his heart as still as water.\nMotionless, his Heart Spirit seemed completely immersed into his heart.\nA mass of Magic Power floated in the void in front of him, beginning to be squeezed and split under the action of invisible Spiritual Power.\nTwo lines, four lines, eight lines...\nThe Magic Corps in front gradually split, becoming a greater number of coarse Magic Lines.\nIn this process, as the Magic Corps was split into eight parts, the coarse lines split using Spiritual Power began to tremble, and cold sweat appeared on Austin’s forehead.\nFinally,\nWith a pop, the arm-thick, crooked, irregularly sized Magic Lines suspended in front began to collapse, sweeping up a gust of wind on the ground, clearing away the surrounding as well as the snow on Austin.\n\"Failed.\"\nAustin opened his eyes, somewhat weary.\nCompared to before, due to the great enhancement in Magic Level and quantity, the Magic Corps activated were both powerful and turbulent.\nDuring splitting, even a moment of unstable Heart Spirit could cause it to disintegrate.\nThe difficulty has increased more than tenfold, to say the least.\nHowever, Austin did not give up.\nIf it doesn’t work the first time, the second will do. If the second doesn’t work, then the third, fourth... As long as he continues to try, the degree of control over his own Magic Power will surely improve quickly, reaching a certain level of precision.\nAfter a short rest, Austin closed his eyes again.\nSinking into his Heart Spirit, a flowing Magic Power mass appeared in the void ahead, surrounded by the invisible Spiritual Power enveloping the surrounding void.\nHe began to try again.\nOnce, twice, three times...\nAs time passed, from the beginning where the arm-thick line would fail and collapse, then to cable-like size, next to chopstick, and then toothpick...\nStep by step, the precision of Austin’s control over Magic Power improved at a speed visible to the naked eye.\nMeanwhile, the overwhelmingly strong aura pervading the surrounding void also began to gradually recede.\nThe presence that once was enough to frighten ordinary creatures into trembling, now only exudes a sense of dominance that would make ordinary Beastmen feel awe.\nThis is the result of increased precision in controlling Magic Power, allowing Austin to freely control the presence he emits.\nIf one day, Austin reaches an ultimate level of control over his Magic Power, he might be able to completely conceal his aura.\nSince the last six months of tempering in the lava, Austin’s once youthful body has been honed to a more pronounced form, no longer needing to use presence to highlight his valor.\nConcealing aura would be no issue either.\nTime slowly passed, in the blink of an eye, half a month had gone by.\nDuring this half-month, Austin finally managed to split a mass of Magic Power to the fineness of a strand of hair.\nThis fine level of control is already sufficient.\nTo go further would require more time and more effort.\nFor the current Austin, the cost-effectiveness of enhancing strength this way isn’t very high.\nThus, Austin stopped training in this area.",

consumed in using Rasengan and other various techniques had decreased to around seventy or eighty percent.\nAt the same time, the power not only did not decrease, but in fact had a certain degree of enhancement.\nMost importantly, this hair-thin Magic Power control allowed Austin’s spirit to use this precise Magic Power control as a medium to vastly consolidate the extent of his expanded Domain.\nAlthough, it cannot achieve the Legendary feat of making the entire Domain one’s own battlefield.\nBut with the current strength of Austin’s Domain prototype, it is definitely stronger than ordinary half-Legendary level.\n\"Not bad.\"\nApart from the above gains, continuous training in Magic Power splitting for more than half a month greatly enhanced Austin’s spirit and elevated his physical control to a higher level.\nMagic Power splitting training concluded, roughly estimated, Austin’s strength was increased by another notch.\nIt also provided a considerable benefit for his subsequent cultivation.\n\"Next is to comprehend the power of the Flame Law and Water Law Origin.\"\nAustin immersed his Heart Spirit, continuing his cultivation.\nDuring the cold winter, there were no major events.\nCurrently, the Dragon’s Nest tribe can solve any issues on their own, without needing him to intervene personally.\nHaving already fallen to the status of an Overlord Level force, coupled with the completion of the Beastman Six Techniques and their dissemination among Beastman Transcendents, the strength of the Beastman Transcendents has been greatly enhanced, even Gold Level Lords can’t cause much harm to the Dragon’s Nest tribe.\nNow, with Austin combining forces with his Dragon’s Nest tribe, their strength is no less than any super-large tribe within the Tribe Alliance.\nThe Dragon’s Nest tribe hasn’t achieved the same fame as the Blood Claw Tribe simply due to Austin’s strategy of building high walls and accumulating resources while gradually advancing his position.\nMoreover, more than half of the Dragon’s Nest tribe’s food comes from agricultural development, including various mushroom cultivation, animal husbandry, fishery, etc., combined, there isn’t much need for survival territories, thus avoiding large-scale conflicts with the outside world.\nUp until now, the wars initiated by the Dragon’s Nest tribe were merely small regional conflicts.\nThey laid a solid foundation and constantly cultivated Inner Power.\nAwaiting the war that will scourge the Beastman Royal Court, when the world’s attention shifts from the Kawa Great Forest, it will be the best time for them to reveal themselves.\nThe Dragon’s Nest tribe expands steadily, in three strongholds.\nAustin naturally felt at ease cultivating, striving to enhance his strength as early as possible.\nSometimes, he thought, he must be the most diligent Giant Dragon ever.\nWhat’s those of his age doing?\nThey’re probably taking a long nap.\nSometimes he truly envied other dragons.\nLuckily, diligence truly pays off.\nCurrently, Austin is merely around seven years old, yet his strength has reached the Half-Legendary Realm, and he possesses the power of the Four Elements Law.\nAt seven, considering a Giant Dragon’s lifespan extending over a millennium, it is not even one percent, still unable to shake off the status of a Young Dragon.\nBut he already has an enormous physique of eight or nine meters tall, just a half step away from entering the gate to the Legendary Realm, traversing a path that other dragons can’t finish even over hundreds of years.\nThose same age Young Dragons under their parents’ protection might just reach Silver Level at best.\nRecalling the hardships he endured along the way, Austin sighed deeply.\n\"The luck of the diligent shall not be too bad.\"\nOn the mountaintop, Austin gave himself a sip of past life’s motivational soup and began to immerse his Heart Spirit in comprehension.\nOriginally, Austin relied on devouring and refining the Law Power acquired, which did not belong to him.\nAlthough the old priest’s distant finger directly refined the Water Elemental Law Origin within Austin, drastically enhancing the constant Law Origin power inside him.\nBut ultimately, they aren’t his own, he can only use them, unable to comprehend.\nIf the Law Origin were a knife, then the Flame Law and Water Law are like a child’s knife for Austin, only able to wield it haphazardly.\nWhen Austin comprehends the power of the Flame Law and Water Law, it’s akin to someone who originally didn’t know how to use a knife learning a Sword Technique, greatly enhancing both utility and killing ability.\nMoreover, the benefits of comprehending Laws not only improve the effectiveness of using Law Power.\nMost importantly,\nIf he can fully comprehend a Law Origin between heaven and earth, it can serve as a stepping stone, allowing him to enter the Legendary gate in one stride!\nA complete Law Origin is the threshold to the Legendary gate!\nThe current comprehension of the Law Origin within is the foundation accumulated on the road to the Legendary gate!\nThis is also why Austin tirelessly spends a great amount of time on comprehending Law Origins.\nHis spirit immersed in body, enveloping the Law Origin within the bloodline.\nStarting with the Law of Water,\nAustin’s spirit seemed to sink into a world of water, everywhere in sight was a sea of water.\nStanding at the center of the water world, he started to feel the power of the surrounding water.\nTime in the outside world slowly passed by,\nThe snow in the sky fell and then rose, cycle after cycle.\nAustin remained motionless, his spirit immersed in the ocean of Law Origin, ignoring the snowflakes on him.\nIt’s unclear how much time has passed, Austin’s entire body seemed to be covered by ice and snow.\nIn a daze, half a month had passed.\nOnly then did Austin wake from his slumber, shaking off the snowflakes, white snowflakes rustling and falling.\nWith previous experience in comprehending Thunder Law Origin and Wind Law Origin, coupled with Austin’s cultivation reaching the Half-Legendary Realm, his speed in comprehending unfamiliar Law Origins has also increased significantly.\nCurrently, his comprehension of the Law of Water has reached a relatively deep phase.\nRoughly comparable in degree to Thunder Law and Wind Law.\nComprehension speed inherently slows down, now almost reaching a limit, without chance opportunities, continued comprehension might not yield much more improvement.\nTherefore, Austin decisively halted his comprehension of the Law of Water.\n\"Water Attribute Rasengan’s consumption is lower, its power even greater, and can even utilize the power of the Law of Water to induce a tsunami-like magic ability.\"\nAustin sensed his internal situation, and clearly understood the gains from this comprehension of the Water Law Origin.\nCombat strength increased by another notch.\nHowever, that’s still not enough.\nAustin closed his eyes, spirit immersed in his body, beginning to comprehend the Fire Law Origin.\nOnce he finishes comprehending the Fire Law Origin, when the power of the Four Elements Law is achieved, he will then condense two more Law Divine Swords, completing a total of four.\nThus, he can also start constructing the Four Spirits Sword Array.",

the gain from understanding the Flame Law Origin was considerable.\nNot only did it strengthen his spirit during the process, but after understanding the Flame Law Origin, several fire element techniques naturally emerged.\nSea of Fire, Flame Shock, Flame Burst Technique...\nWith proficient control of the fire element, he could easily perform these techniques through some simple manipulation.\n\"Very good, now all Four Major Elemental Laws are complete!\"\nAt this moment, there was a hint of excitement in Austin’s eyes.\nBack when he tried to condense thunder into a sword shape, granting it the Thunder Law, and nurturing the Sword Drawing Technique, Austin had thought about the day when multiple Law Divine Swords would unite, forming an incredibly powerful sword array.\nAt that time, what he most wanted to replicate in this world was the Immortal Slaying Sword Array.\nBut later, thinking that the Immortal Slaying Sword Array could only be broken by Four Saints, and he could only handle Legendary beings.\nThat would lower his standing quite a bit.\nSo he set his sights on the Four Spirits Sword Array instead.\nSo-called Four Spirits refers to the Cyan Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise.\nIn ancient times, dragons were considered the sons of heaven, ruling the world, wielding thunder as heavenly punishment, thus Cyan Dragon ruled thunder.\nNo issue there.\nThen the White Tiger ruled wind, Vermilion Bird ruled fire, and Black Tortoise ruled water.\nThus, the four attribute powers gathered together.\nAustin had a feeling that if he could really complete the idea of the Four Spirits Sword Array, its power might exceed his imagination!\nAnd this was just one way the Law Divine Swords could be used.\nThe success of the Wind and Thunder Dual Swords Unification gave Austin hope for the successful unification of three or even four swords.\nAnd once the Four Swords Unification succeeded, the amplified power would become unbelievably strong.\nAt that time, carrying the four Law Divine Swords, with the Four Spirits Sword Array for defense, and Four Swords Unification for attack,\nhe could challenge his quivering enemies: Who else dares?\nJust imagining that scene filled Austin with motivation.\nBut... it seemed this was becoming more and more offbeat...\nOthers who crossed into this fantasy world stood in knightly armor, wielding Forbidden Curse Divine Artifacts.\nYet here he was, running around wielding Law Divine Swords, dealing with sword arrays and unifications in an immortal fantasy style.\nAustin thought about it, but couldn’t find an answer.\nSo he gave up thinking.\nThen started to condense the Fire Law Divine Sword and Water Law Divine Sword.\nWith the previous experience, this time was relatively easy, and within a few days, the Fire Law Divine Sword and Water Law Divine Sword formed a stable shape.\nWith a thought, the four Law Divine Swords floated in the void.\nBOOM!!!\nAccompanying the appearance of the four Law Divine Swords, merely the release of their aura triggered the Celestial Secret Aura to surge like a violent tide, sweeping across several miles.\nThe heavens and earth seemed to tremble continuously, as waves rolled on lakes and seas, earth fires erupted, and fierce winds and thunder swept through the world.\n\"This is...\"\nAustin’s expression was solemn.\nBecause, in his perception, strands of aura in the sky and earth above were each drawn by the four Law Divine Swords, as if splitting the entire world into four realms, yet subtly linking everything together, forming a complete.....\nCircle!\nThe four powers seemed to repel, yet also converge!\n\"What’s happening?\"\nAustin frowned deeply, this change before him was beyond his expectations.\nHowever, this did not seem to be a bad thing.\n\"Thunder, wind, water, fire, these four elemental powers seem to generate a mysterious resonance and connection, perhaps, the envisioned Four Spirits Sword Array can truly be created!\"\nHis assumption was correct!\nThe four elemental powers can truly resonate and connect!\nStaring at the four Law Divine Swords stirring up the heavens before him, Austin’s gaze became extremely determined.\nAs long as he could clarify the connections between these four powers, he could build the rough framework of the Four Spirits Sword Array and finally realize the Four Spirits Sword Array completely in this world!\nThinking now leads to action.\nThus, Austin poured all of his spiritual power into analyzing the four Law Divine Swords before him.\nBy studying the convergence of the powers of the four Law Divine Swords and the melding of Law auras, he might find the law among them!\nJust the fusion of their auras was enough to create such a world-shaking power.\nAustin could not imagine, once the Four Spirits Sword Array was fully completed,\nthe extent of power it would achieve!",

      "content": "Chapter 309: Chapter 305: Turmoil\nTime slowly flowed by as Austin was in seclusion, contemplating.\nIt was impossible to comprehend the linkage between the four Law Divine Swords’ powers and create the Four Spirits Sword Array in this world without spending a considerable amount of time.\nAnd during Austin’s period of seclusion and enlightenment, the Dragon Nest Tribe remained peaceful.\nIn the cold winter, the tribe took in many wandering Beastmen and was transforming them through military training, turning them into members of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAt this moment, the population of the entire Dragon Nest Tribe had already surpassed ninety thousand, approaching the milestone of one hundred thousand.\nAs the Dragon Nest Tribe grew stronger day by day, asserting dominance over a vast area with an invincible stance, it naturally gained the envy of many Beastmen struggling to survive in the vicinity.\nMoreover, the Dragon Nest Tribe was generally open to Beastmen who sought refuge, whether captives or wandering Beastmen, as they all had to undergo a month of military training and transformation, ultimately becoming warriors of the tribe, regardless of their original state.\nThus, with the rise of the Dragon Nest Tribe, more and more Beastman Tribes began to merge into and seek allegiance with it.\nInitially, merging with the Dragon Nest Tribe was the last resort for poverty-stricken tribes that lacked food and couldn’t survive the harsh winter.\nBut as the strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe grew, coupled with the ample treatment that allowed these previously impoverished tribes to fill their bellies, more Beastmen began to entertain the idea.\nAlthough some Beastmen were suppressed by the elders of their tribes, Beastman Tribes around them could barely maintain stability.\nHowever, when some of the lowest-tier Beastmen could not resist the temptation and risked everything to escape,\ncertain seeds began to take root.\nInitially, lower-level slaves fled, yearning for a better life, and reached the sanctuary of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe accepted these runaway slaves, providing them with enough food while starting their military training transformation.\nThe elders, chiefs, and other senior members of the external Beastman Tribes, out of fear of the Dragon Nest Tribe, dared not take any action.\nThey could only secretly keep a tight grip on the slaves within their tribes and brutally nail captured runaway slaves in front of all the tribe’s Beastmen as a deterrence.\nInitially, this method of killing the chicken to scare the monkey was effective.\nThe hearts of the slave and impoverished Beastmen were suppressed by this harsh means.\nThe Beastman elders and chiefs were very satisfied, nipping certain things in the bud.\nHowever, what the Beastman elders didn’t know was that their actions were like adding more gunpowder to an imminent powder keg.\nThe good times did not last long.\nSubsequently, a seemingly insignificant incident occurred, like a small spark, that directly ignited the powder keg and swept across a large area, altering the layout of the Beastman Tribes surrounding the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThe matter was simple,\nIn one Beastman Tribe, a Minotaur slave escaped and fled to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAfter a month of military training and transformation, the Minotaur shed its previously emaciated frame, quickly becoming a robust Minotaur due to the ample food, and because of its strong physique, it became a member of the hunting backup team, essentially a prospective Beastman soldier cleaning up the hunting grounds.\nOne day, while the Minotaur was out hunting with the Dragon Nest soldiers, it was spotted from afar by some companions from its former tribe who were gathering.\nBack then, the Minotaur had planned to escape with these companions, but they were too afraid of the tribe elders’ brutality and did not follow through.\nNow, seeing their former companion doing well while they still remained as slaves prone to beatings and scolding,\nthe Beastman companion felt unbalanced and was later beaten half-dead by a tribe elder for no particular reason.\nThat night, unable to contain his grievances and dissatisfaction, he spoke out.\nOther Beastman slaves from the same place also said they couldn’t live like this anymore.\nThe more they complained, the more dissatisfied they became.\nWhen the dissatisfaction reached its peak, that night, a large-scale slave revolt erupted within the Beastman Tribe.\nFrom that riot, as the benefits of joining the Dragon Nest Tribe spread, greater turmoil began to unfold among the Beastman Tribes in the nearby regions.\nThus, a tiny spark ignited the resistance.\nIn the Dragon Nest Tribe’s sphere of influence, every Beastman Tribe nearly failed to escape the fate of a grassroots uprising.\nThe great collapse had begun.\nPreviously, there was no choice.\nBeastmen leaving the tribe couldn’t possibly survive alone in the perilous Forest Land.\nThey needed to band together to achieve a certain degree of safety.\nBut now, a better option was laid before them.\nTo fill their stomachs, to live safely.\nThese two points were sufficient.\nYet, tribe elders and chiefs sought to prevent the exodus of slaves and numerous low-ranking Beastmen through ruthless means for the sake of their own power and wealth.\nRebellion naturally ensued.\nWithin the Dragon Nest Tribe’s sphere of influence, one after another, Beastman Tribes collapsed amid the turmoil. Large numbers of grassroots Beastmen, after resisting the oppressive rule of tribe elders and chiefs, began heading toward the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThis development left the current Governor of the Dragon Nest Tribe somewhat stunned.\nAt one time, to quickly increase the population, the Dragon Nest Tribe had to relentlessly expand, diligently attacking and annexing other Beastman Tribes, assimilating the populations of conquered tribes completely.\nIt was through numerous wars that the Dragon Nest Tribe reached its current level of strength.\nYet now, without expending a single soldier from the Dragon Nest Legion, the border Beastman Tribes collapsed, and the Beastman population rapidly increased.\nReflecting on the past and seeing the contrast with today,\nindeed left one speechless, as all could be said was that the world is unpredictable.",

      "content": "Chapter 310: Chapter 306: Strange State\nThis great collapse of the external Beastman Tribe occurred before the cold winter, and it was precisely this massive influx of Beastman population that allowed the Dragon Nest Tribe’s population to break through the 90,000 mark, moving towards a count of 100,000.\nThe substantial growth in the Beastman population did not cause much trouble for the Beastman Tribe.\nAll work had precedents, and with the Dragon Nest Tribe’s rich experience in absorbing members, they quickly incorporated the numerous wandering Beastmen into their ranks after the great collapse.\nDuring this period, the Dragon Nest Tribe focused on strengthening the training of the tribe’s Beastmen, mainly to enhance their prowess.\nTime passed in tranquility, with about half a month remaining until the end of the cold winter.\nMeanwhile, Austin, who was contemplating the four Law Divine Swords, encountered a seemingly insurmountable obstacle before even entering the gate.\nAt the mountaintop,\nlightning flashed and thunder roared, winds and thunder converged.\nAustin’s face showed a distressed look.\n\"Wind, Thunder, Water, Fire, Power of the Four Symbols, sigh...\"\nBetween heaven and earth, the Qi of the four Law Divine Swords dispersed into the void, intertwining mysteriously, seemingly possessing a faint, almost intangible connection.\nThis intertwining of Qi formed an incomparably harmonious \"circle,\" seemingly excluding the surrounding miles from heaven and earth.\nThis was the power at the level of Laws, where the Laws were affecting the void.\nThe surrounding miles of territory were transformed into a domain belonging to them!\nIf one could comprehend the rationale behind the mutual intertwining of the Qi of these four Law Divine Swords, it could serve as the foundation for developing a Four Spirits Sword Array akin to the Four Directions Sword Realm.\nAustin thought this at the beginning, and with great hope, he invested a significant amount of his heart spirit into it.\nHe infused his spiritual power into the Thunderbolt Divine Sword he was most familiar with, merging into its aura and spreading into the void, intending to observe how this aura of Laws intertwined.\nBut, he failed from the start.\nThe four Law Divine Swords seemed to possess consciousness. When Austin attempted to glimpse at their true condition, the connections and intertwining of those auras ceased immediately.\nThe Law Divine Swords stood quietly around, their might shaking the surroundings, opposing each other as if dividing four realms, making the previous mystical intertwining seem like an illusion.\nWhen Austin withdrew his spiritual power, the intertwining of those auras and the harmonious circle reappeared.\nFirst came astonishment, followed by shock, and, finally, a relentless determination.\nHe continued to attempt,\nfirst once, then twice, and so it went.\nThus, Austin abandoned the Thunderbolt Divine Sword and focused his spiritual power on the Wind Law Divine Sword.\nHowever, the result was the same!\nJust as when he merged his spiritual power into the Thunderbolt Divine Sword and tried to trace the aura of the Thunder Law to understand the connection and intertwining principles between the four Laws, those connections vanished as soon as he observed them.\nWhen Austin infused his spiritual power into the aura of the Wind Law, the result was identical.\nNext, it was the Law of Water.\nAnd finally, the Law of Fire.\nNo matter how Austin tried, as soon as he observed, the connections between the four Laws inevitably vanished.\nThe four Law Divine Swords were like four mischievous children.\nWhen you’re not looking, they get along very well, playing and having fun together.\nBut as soon as you look at them, they immediately become proper, as if they don’t recognize each other.\nStrange, very strange.\n\"Quantum superposition state...\"\nAustin’s expression turned grim, pondering for a long time, and he used a term from physics he encountered in a previous life to describe the situation he faced.\nJust like Schrödinger’s cat.\nBefore you observe it, that cat exists in a state of being both alive and dead at the same time.\nThe four Law Divine Swords before him were just like this.\nWhile being independent, they were also interconnected.\nIn a state of both independence and connection.\n\"Schrödinger’s cat, an overlay of life and death!\"\nAustin’s expression became particularly complex.\nBack when he was young, upon first hearing about Schrödinger’s cat and roughly understanding the experiment’s process, he simply thought that the so-called superposed states of the cat were:\nLiving result + dead result = overlay of life and death.\nThe so-called state of life and death overlay was nothing more than a philosophical, linguistic concept.\nThe cat in the box was either alive or dead; the result could only be one or the other.\nOnce the box was opened and the cat inside was observed, confirming the cat’s life or death, it was akin to stepping back from the right side of the equation to the left.\nHowever, it wasn’t until Austin attended university, learned more, that he truly understood that his initial understanding was completely wrong.\nThe state of overlay between life and death is a real existing state, not just a linguistic equation.\nMemory pulled him back continuously.\nAustin recalled a real-life experiment that seemed bizarre and frightening to ordinary people, the photon double-slit interference experiment.\nIn that experiment, when you used detectors to monitor how the photon passed through the two slits, that photon manifested as a particle, and no interference pattern appeared on the photographic paper behind.\nYet when you removed the monitor, a strange phenomenon occurred.\nWith the same experimental setup and environment, the photographic paper behind displayed an interference pattern at the end.\nAs if some ghost or deity wielded its invisible hands, altering everything.\nAnd that classic experiment in quantum physics proved that human consciousness could cause the collapse of the quantum superposition states that exist in reality.\nThis is also why people often say the end of science is theology.\nIt was from that experiment Austin’s thinking began to change, realizing that Schrödinger’s cat genuinely existed in a state of life and death overlay.\nNow, the problem faced by Austin’s four Law Divine Swords might be the same.\n\"This, perhaps already touches upon the fundamental concepts of world reality and existence!\"\nAustin shook his head slightly.\nThe state of independence and connection coexistence of the four Law Divine Swords, Wind, Thunder, Water, and Fire, was so similar to the photon’s double-slit interference experiment!\nThis problem had already touched upon the fundamentals of the world and reality.\nSuch a level of power was something Austin could not touch.\nUntouchable, incomprehensible.\n\"Perhaps, only reaching Legendary, or even Epic above Legendary, or the Divine above Epic, could one truly understand the source of such things.\"\nAt this moment, Austin couldn’t help but recall the final words of the old priest before he left the Divine Kingdom.\n\"...a predetermined destiny.\"\nPerhaps that pertained to some deeper information.\nAfter mulling over it for a long time, he came to no conclusions.\nIn the end, Austin gave up on contemplating these issues.\nThough he hadn’t figured out the rationale behind the connections between the four Law Divine Swords, regarding the Four Spirits Sword Array, Austin came away with some ideas during this fruitless contemplation process.",

      "content": "Chapter 311: Chapter 307 Control\nAustin had a vague suspicion about the intertwining auras among the four Law Divine Swords.\nThis level of entities likely involves some rule of the operation of all things in the world, a certain ultimate truth of the operation of heaven and earth.\nOr rather, the convergence and operation of Elemental Powers form the cornerstone of the elements of the Prime Material Plane, the foundation of the Prime Material Plane’s existence.\nSuch fundamental laws of the world’s operation are utterly impossible for him to grasp now, given that he’s only at the Half-Legendary stage.\nThat Austin could discover such a peculiar phenomenon is mostly due to the inadvertent result triggered by the four Law Divine Swords he had crafted, otherwise, even those in the Legendary Realm couldn’t touch upon such a bizarre phenomenon.\nIf not, those who have comprehended the Law Origin in the Legendary Realm could use Law to wage heaven-shattering and earth-destroying battles.\nIf that cornerstone of the Elemental Powers of the world is deciphered and applied to battles, it would be akin to the power of a world-ending and rebirth-like force!\n\"Even if I know its appearance but not its essence, as long as I can follow a certain track or rule, I should be able to manifest the Four Spirits Sword Array through sheer will.\"\nJust like magic, many do not understand its fundamental principles, yet they can still invoke the Elemental Power to unleash Magic through Spiritual Power.\nThis was exactly what Austin intended.\nThe Seta Great World had a certain scientific foundation, yet it was more metaphysical, a truth that Austin had realized when developing the Electromagnetic Cannon in his earlier years.\nOne must know, even in the world Austin had traversed from, Electromagnetic Cannons practical for battle had not yet been completed.\nBut he, just by relying on some basic electromagnetic principles, constructed a formidable Electromagnetic Cannon through the metaphysical forces of Spiritual Power and Magic Power.\nIf the scientists of his former life learned of this, they would likely feel deep anguish.\nAnd so is the Four Spirits Sword Array.\nHaving been unable to analyze the most fundamental principles of the four Law Divine Swords nor deduce the framework of the Four Spirits Sword Array purely through scientific theory, could they use the strength of Spiritual Power and metaphysical magic to complete the remaining steps?\nThus, in wanting to develop the Four Spirits Sword Array, only the operating environment is required, and there’s no need to delve too deeply into its operational logic.\nUpon thinking, Austin acted.\nHe immersed his Heart Spirit into the four Law Divine Swords, observing the operational connection from afar.\nSince he couldn’t analyze the most basic principles, summarizing the external patterns of it should succeed.\nFor this time, Austin didn’t separate the four Law Divine Swords but observed them as a whole.\nBefore long, he seemingly saw an \"orbit\" of operation formed by the virtual energy amongst the four Law Divine Swords.\nSure enough, Austin had found the right direction.\nIn the realm of quantum physics, the macro and micro perspectives are different.\nUnexpectedly, some theories from his previous world could be applied here.\nCasting away all excess thoughts, Austin refocused his Heart Spirit on the \"whole\" formed by the four Law Divine Swords before him, observing meticulously and comprehending the certain \"principle\" within.\nTime ticked away slowly.\nWhile observing and comprehending, Austin also experimented externally using the aural operation patterns formed by the four Law Divine Swords as a whole.\nVerifying between what he comprehended and experimented with, he indeed made considerable gains.\nFor example, the transformation of the Rasengan through three Elemental Attribute Powers.\nDuring the time the Pyramid built by the Undead was destroyed, Austin utilized a supremely invincible world-destroying compressed Wind-Water-Thunder Rasengan formed from the transformation of three attributes: wind, water, and thunder, which evaporated the thousands-meter-high Pyramid, erasing it from the earth.\nTo think, at that time, Austin had just recently entered the Gold stage!\nThe Rasengan born from the transformation of three Elemental Powers erupted with exponential power, reaching an incredible stage.\nHowever, later on, Austin never used the supremely invincible world-destroying compressed Wind-Water-Thunder Rasengan in battles again, typically resorting to Rasengan of a single attribute.\nWhy so?\nBecause, after the two transformations of the Rasengan’s nature, the difficulty in controlling it exponentially increased as well.\nA slight carelessness would cause a conflict of the two Elemental Powers within the Rasengan leading to its collapse.\nIf two element’s transformation is tricky enough, adding a third Attribute Power only complicates it further.\nPrecisely why, despite the multi-attribute transforming Rasengan having greater offensive power, in intense battles, it’s nearly impossible to spend much energy on gathering a multi-attribute transforming Rasengan.\nThus, after obliterating the Undead Pyramid, Austin never deployed the supremely invincible world-destroying compressed Wind-Water-Thunder Rasengan again.\nThe reason being, in intense battles, opportunities pass in the blink of an eye, leaving no room to spend time gathering a killing move.\nBut now, everything has changed.\nAs Austin took the integration of the four Law Divine Swords as a whole and comprehended the operation of the four Law Powers, he faintly felt a resonance regarding Elemental Power’s operational linkage.\nLike touching upon a certain bottleneck, advancing further.\nWhile comprehending the four Law Divine Swords, Austin reflected and pondered momentarily, his Spiritual Power invoked within the void.\nBoom!!!\nSuddenly, visible ripples in the void rippled and twisted, transforming into a vortex.\nA large amount of Magic Power surged in, forming a Magic Power Rasengan.\nNext, the Law Power fluctuated, causing the rapidly spinning attribute-less Magic Power within the Rasengan to transform in nature.\nThe Wind and Thunder powers completed their transformation in an instant.\n\"It worked! Indeed, using the concept of Wind and Thunder Dual Swords Unification as a foundation, combined with my understandings these recent times, the Wind-Thunder dual attributes transforming Rasengan can also be instantly triggered.\"\nGazing at the dual attribute transforming Rasengan he held, Austin exhaled deeply.\nIt seemed as though eternally small needle-like electric lights converged within the Rasengan spinning rapidly, and the terrifying power contained within the wind-thunder attribute transforming mixed Rasengan warped the surrounding void, causing visible faint ripples to radiate in the air.\nThe perfect fusion of the dual Attribute Powers within the Rasengan resulted in a convergence nearly quadrupling the power of an ordinary single-attribute transforming Rasengan!\n\"What a pleasant surprise.\"\nThe frustration from previously hitting bottlenecks while comprehending the four Law Divine Swords instantly vanished for Austin.\nBeing able to instantly unleash a multi-attribute Rasengan in battle meant significantly amplifying his attack power, enhancing his combat capability enormously.\nAnd all of this could only be considered an unforeseen bounty amidst the comprehension of the four Law Divine Swords.",

In terms of offensive and defensive capabilities, it still had a long way to go before success.\n\"What should I do next?\"\nAustin couldn’t help but fall into contemplation.\n...\nJust as Austin was painstakingly creating the Four Spirits Sword Array and the Dragon Nest Tribe was steadily developing.\nAt this moment in the outside world, war had already spread, with blades and fire sweeping across large areas of the Kawa Great Forest.\nThe Beastman Tribe Alliance’s army finally launched a massive offensive against the undead-occupied lands before the cold winter ended.\nThose large super-beastman tribes once supported along the border to fight humans in blood battles had become a sharp blade turned against themselves.\nNot only the Tribe Alliance participated, but humans also joined in, with tens of thousands of elite troops and beastman armies together conducting this sweeping retaliatory war across the Kawa Great Forest.\nThe timing of this counterattack was meticulously chosen.\nDuring the cold winter, these mutated undead were already limited in activity sensitivity.\nWith the human elite army joining in, the united forces progressed swiftly like a hot knife through butter.\nVast areas were raided, countless undead were purged.\nThe lands controlled by undead were entirely fallen, and those pyramid structures were destroyed, leaving nothing behind.\nEverything proceeded smoothly, though some wise individuals sensed something amiss.\nYet, more were optimistic about the future of warfare, and any dissent was submerged in the crowd.\nMeanwhile, the legendary figures behind everything remained eerily silent.\nCannon fodder is ultimately meant to be consumed.\nIf the Beastman Royal Court had no backup plan, the legacy of the Beastman Empire from years past would have been fully depleted, and everything would be joyous.\nHowever, if those pure-blooded beastmen possessed a secret weapon, consuming one wave to probe reality wouldn’t be bad.\nThe numerous Tribe Alliance beastmen were the best reconnaissance tool.\nThus,\nThe triumphantly advancing united army charged straight into the core region occupied by the Beastman Royal Court, intending to eliminate the remnants of the Beastman Empire entirely.\nTheir momentum was unstoppable.\nThe vast multitude, over a million beastman armies, hadn’t realized they were merely reconnaissance cannon fodder.\nSo, they surged mightily towards the core area.\nThen, they encountered an annihilating attack.\nThat day,\nUpon passing a massive gorge, before reaching the core area of the Kawa Great Forest, three to four hundred miles away from the Beastman Royal Court.\nAn explosion suddenly occurred.\nLike a sun rising slowly from the horizon, the intense heat instantly evaporated tens of thousands of central beastmen, even soil and rock turned to glass instantly, vast soil transformed into dark red lava under the sweep of the fiery shockwave.\nMassive clouds of smoke ascended, rising above the intense heat of the Fireball, like a gigantic mushroom cloud slowly ascending across the land!\nThat unknown explosion took away tens of thousands of beastman lives in an instant.\nMore beastmen were seriously injured under the subsequent shockwave sweep,\nWith the Beastman Alliance army’s fortunes reversed, over a million suffered casualties, leading to their defeat.\nFrom beginning to end, the Beastman Royal Court didn’t even reveal itself.\nSimultaneously, afar on the battlefield.\nA perceivable tide rippled in the void, several magnificent figures gathered together.\nThe powerful aura of these figures merged into the void, seemingly casting aside the entire heaven and earth.\nThey were figures of great stature.\nMoreover, among great figures, their words could decide the fall of a duchy, the lives and deaths of hundreds of thousands of beings.\nThey stood at the undisputed peak of the Prime Material Plane while Divine beings were hidden, and Epic figures were in retreat.\nYet, at this moment,\nThese great figures gazed at the mushroom cloud slowly ascending in the distance, remaining silent, unable to utter a word.\nThis was the battlefield over a thousand kilometers apart.\nEven over such a remote distance, the destructive power could still be felt.\n\"How do you see this?\"\nA deep voice reverberated through the void, lightly rippling the air.\n\"As expected of the pure-blooded beastmen who founded the Beastman Empire back then. Even though they’ve fallen, they still possess means to survive or achieve mutual destruction.\"\nAnother slightly sharp and sinister voice sounded.\nA brief silence followed.\nFor as legendary figures, they too felt the destructive force emanating from the battlefield where the mushroom cloud arose,\nA terrifying power even they couldn’t withstand!\nA force capable of slaying anyone among them.\nThe probe was indeed correct.\nOver a million beastman alliance forces ultimately uncovered something.\n\"Likely, the pure-blooded beastmen may have nothing more, but if they do, it won’t be much. Next, we need to continue organizing counterattacks.\"\n\"But the alliance has already collapsed, over half a million beastmen casualties, they won’t continue anymore.\"\n\"The human coalition hasn’t been defeated, presumably they pre-received intelligence to evade this catastrophe, afterward, rally all external forces surrounding the Kawa Great Forest, attack together. Once isn’t enough, then twice, thrice, until all of their depths are exhausted!\"\nSomeone’s cold voice uttered, devoid of any emotion.\nHis intention was to organize all sentient forces in the Kawa Great Forest, whether large or small tribes, or Lords of Magical Beasts with minions, into a grand army to continue using lives to deplete the Beastman Royal Court’s destructive weaponry.\n\"What if someone doesn’t follow orders?\"\n\"Do they dare?\"\nIndeed they daren’t,\nThe order united by several legendary figures.\nUnless a power was inherently within the Legendary Realm, or had legend-level backing.\nOtherwise, destined to be reconnaissance cannon fodder.\nThe negotiation was decided.\nFollowing the collapse of the tribe alliance, and gathering remaining forces, individual strong emissaries, bearing legends’ orders, started heading out in all directions.",

      "content": "Chapter 313: Chapter 309 Urgency (1st update, seeking subscription)\nOn the mountain peak, Austin was concentrating all his heart and soul on the formation of the Four Spirits Sword Array.\nVaguely, there was a slight rumbling sound from afar, even the Celestial Secret Aura seemed to ripple, and the sky’s light somewhere appeared slightly brighter.\nThis vibration was not large, the rumbling sound was somewhat subdued, and the brightness of half the sky was even faint; without careful perception, one would hardly notice anything unusual.\nThe creatures near the Dragon Nest Tribe did not feel anything at all, going about their business as usual.\nHowever,\nEntering a Void Meditation State, Austin, who was comprehending the Law Divine Sword, was extraordinarily sensitive to changes in the aura of heaven and earth.\nThe original aura of the four Law Divine Swords was converging in the void, and the external fluctuations acted as an amplifier within the aura field formed by the four Law Divine Swords.\nThis naturally made Austin aware of this phenomenon, waking him from his deep concentration.\n\"Huh? Is that the direction of the core region?\"\nLooking towards the core region of the Kawa Great Forest, Austin’s face was full of seriousness.\nDespite being separated by such a great distance, he could still sense the shockwave produced by the explosion.\nThe destructive aura that rushed towards the heavens stirred the Celestial Secret Aura into chaos.\nThough it had weakened to an almost negligible level by the time it spread here, it raised tumultuous waves in Austin’s heart.\n\"Could the great war have begun? Such a level of attack...\"\nAlthough the Dragon Nest Tribe was in a secluded corner, it wasn’t completely ignorant.\nYears ago, after a conflict between the Dragon Nest Tribe and Blood Claw Tribe, Austin trained some talents in intelligence to make up for this deficiency.\nInformation about the gathering of tribal alliance armies, the subsequent involvement of human armies.\nEven the specific date of the coalition’s counterattack, the Dragon Nest Tribe learned from those secret spy informants.\nAustin was mostly clear about the coalition’s movements.\nIf there were no surprises, with the coalition’s previous momentum, they were close to breaking through the undead and undead’s defenses to formally engage the Beastman Royal Court.\nIt seemed that the Beastman Royal Court had deployed some powerful weapon.\nConsidering the explosion’s impact, the coalition must have suffered significant damage.\n\"Such degree of power, even a Legendary figure could hardly withstand it. No wonder up to now no Legendary figures have personally intervened for a decapitation strategy, instead expending extensive manpower and resources for a gradual attrition against the core region’s Beastman Royal Court.\"\nWith a turn of thought, Austin understood some of the cause and effect.\nBack then, the mysterious bald Guppa had advised Austin not to easily get involved in this war.\nNow it seemed that it was the right decision.\nThe power involved was far beyond what Austin, who was just Gold Middle Tier at the time, could face. In such a war, he would be nothing more than a slightly larger grasshopper, doomed to vanish without a trace upon the slightest mistake.\n\"Even if the coalition suffers heavy losses, those high-ranking Legendary figures would never give up, potentially leading to new changes in the future.\"\nAustin pondered, looking towards the core region of the Forest Land, with a heavy heart.\nAt that time, perhaps he and the Clan Tribe under his command might be forcibly drawn into this war.\n\"The Four Spirits Sword Array needs to accelerate, I need stronger power!\"\nAt this moment, Austin felt a sudden urgency.\nOnly with stronger strength could one hope to have more influence in certain matters.\nUnderstanding this, Austin resumed his contemplation.\nFortunately, since the explosion, there had been no movement from the core region, allowing him to calmly perceive and ponder.\nPerhaps it was the pressure from afar or the shockwave from the explosion that sparked Austin’s insight.\nHe quickly thought of a problem.\nThe Four Spirits Sword Array, rooted in the concept of the Cyan Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise, had an indispensable connection to these four Holy Beasts.\nThus, when building the framework, should this point be emphasized?\n\"Without essence, perhaps this is the state of the four Law Divine Swords. Without the true Four Symbols, how can one forcibly claim it is the Four Spirits Sword Array?\"\nA gentle epiphany arose in Austin’s mind.\nEssence, he needed to imbue the four Law Divine Swords with true essence!\nBut how exactly should this be done?\nAustin thought for a long while, his past life’s knowledge flashing through his mind.\nFinally, he came up with an idea.\nContemplation Method.\nIn some fantasy and immortal hero novels of the past life, there was something called the Contemplation Method.\nNo matter the novel, this Contemplation Method was related to Spiritual Power and some mysterious \"Divine Will.\"\nIf one could visualize the forms of the Cyan Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise in the mind, obtaining a trace of their Divine Will, and integrating it into the four Law Divine Swords.\nIn doing so, could the Undead Sword Array naturally form, completing itself?\nThe possibility is great!\nAt least, the principle is quite convincing.\nUpon the thought, Austin began the attempt.\nLuckily, he could roughly visualize the form of the Four Symbols Holy Beasts based on past descriptions.\nThus, he started the visualization of the four Holy Beasts in his mind.\nTime passed, day by day.\nCold winter quietly ended, spring returned to the earth, and the snow-covered world finally regained its vitality.\nThe Dragon Nest Beastmen began a new round of cultivation, while also gathering sufficient resources from the outside forest.\nThe military continued its training to enhance its strength.\nA half-month later, Austin opened his eyes again, filled with undisguised excitement and joy.\nHe succeeded.\nThe forms of the Four Symbols Holy Beasts have been visualized, condensing into a mark deep within Austin’s mind.\nIn the past life, no matter how much he visualized, nothing discernible came about.\nHowever, in this world where extraordinary power manifests, through Spiritual Power visualization, the kind of visualization technique that seemed fictional exhibited its effect.\nThe Cyan Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise have crossed dimension for rebirth.\nThe Four Holy Beasts have shaped and gained a trace of Divine Will through Austin’s visualization and comprehension.\nWith the appearance of these beasts possessing a trace of Divine Will, Austin noticed an inexplicable subtle relationship among their shadows.\nWithout hesitation, Austin then began to forge the Divine Will of the four Holy Beasts into the four Law Divine Swords.",

Will of the Four Divine Beasts’ shadows had been fully visualized, and the next step was to merge them into the four Law Divine Swords, fusing the Law Divine Swords and the shadows of the Divine Beasts together.\nCyan Dragon governs thunder, White Tiger governs wind, Vermilion Bird governs fire, and Black Tortoise governs water.\nAt the same time, the Four Divine Beasts must also align with the four cardinal directions of east, west, south, and north.\nAs the Divine Will of the Four Divine Beasts’ shadows infused into the Law Divine Swords of their respective attributes and entered the four positions within the void,\nA strange transformation was born leisurely within the mysterious connection.\nThe auras interwove and merged in between, with streaks of energy blending in the void, that pervasive vacuous aura of heaven and earth constantly rising, and the Elemental Power became restless, causing the entire void to undulate like tides.\nFinally, at a certain moment, the four Law Divine Swords transformed!\nRumble!!!\nA loud bang, as if the Four Spirits Sword Array crossed boundaries to be reborn, the terrifying aura that surged through the heavens and earth flooded the sky, the sharp aura seemingly slicing through space, as if carving a territory within a radius of several miles, separating it independently.\nThis was a true separation, extracting a region from the vast universe, forming a sword array world of its own!\nWithin this sword array world, the waves surged as tides rose and fell like ocean waves, storms and lightning filled the four directions, while flames and water coiled up.\nIn the trembling space, four streams of aura rose from the ground and penetrated the sky, like four gigantic pillars supporting the entire space.\nStreams of energy circulated, filling every corner of the void, filled with boundless murderous intent and a pervasive ferocity.\nIt succeeded!\nNo matter which enemy, upon being trapped within the sword array, they would face endless entanglement of energy strands.\nUnless they broke the four Law Divine Swords located in the southeast, northwest directions, there was no escape.\nBut, the four Law Divine Swords were united, dealing with one would be like dealing with four swords at the same time.\nAfter the infusion of the Four Divine Beasts’ shadows, they seemed to possess a consciousness of their own.\nThe close connection between them made it so that facing any one Law Divine Sword felt like confronting the power of all four!\nThis was not something that could be done just by placing four Law Divine Swords together, but rather it formed a transformation that even Austin could not comprehend.\nThis was a true Four Spirits Sword Array, possessing the genuine power of the Four Spirits Sword Array!\n\"After spending so much time, it has finally succeeded!\"\nAt the mountain peak, Austin’s pupils revealed an irrepressible joy.\nThe power of the Four Spirits Sword Array left him quite satisfied.\nThe barely exposed, awe-inspiring aura alone was enough for Austin to sense its terrifying power within.\nTearing through the vacuum, re-enacting earth, fire, wind, and water.\nEven if a Legendary Realm were to fall in, it might not fare well at all!\nAustin made a rough estimate of the Four Spirits Sword Array in his heart, and his heart also settled down.\nEven in the face of a legend, with the strength he had now gained, he might not be powerless to resist.\nThe Four Spirits Sword Array could serve as his newest trump card.\nWith a thought, the Law Divine Swords suspended in the east, west, south, and north directions turned into streaks of light, penetrating the layers of void, and returned to Austin’s body, with the anomalies in the surrounding void dispersing and calming down as well.\nThe four Law Divine Swords were nurtured within Austin’s body to enhance their power.\nThrough the nurturing method of Sword Nurturing Technique, the power of the Four Spirits Sword Array at the moment of drawing would only be even stronger!\n\"This time, the closed-door training yielded a lot.\"\nFirst, he became thoroughly familiar with controlling his power that had surged to the Half-Legendary Level, then his precision in controlling his own Magic Power also reached an extremely fine level.\nThen, through comprehending the four Law Divine Swords, he unexpectedly broke through the bottleneck of the Multi-attribute Rasengan and reached a higher level.\nLastly, the completion of the Four Spirits Sword Array gave him a fighting chance even in the face of legends.\nThis time the closed-door training was quite fruitful.\nHis strength improved significantly!\nThroughout the Kawa Great Forest, he now had enough power to protect himself.\nEven if the war were intense, he had enough confidence to remain uninvolved.\nNor did he need to worry about someday falling into a disaster and becoming a corpse in the wilderness, turned to dust beneath the earth.\nThinking this far, having obtained enough power to protect himself, Austin also breathed a sigh of relief.\nThe heavy stone pressing on his mind felt as if it had been lifted away.\nFrom now on, the sky’s the limit allowing him to soar freely.\nOf course, it’s still safer to travel the world after ascending to the Legendary Realm.\nThis retreat was highly rewarding, but it also consumed a lot of his time.\nFor more than half a year, Austin spent most of his time in a state of secluded cultivation.\nMoreover, as his level grew, each retreat became increasingly lengthy.\nHowever, this \"lengthy\" duration was insignificant compared to the thousands of years of lifespan of the Dragon Race.\n\"Secluded for so long, it’s time to go back.\"\nAustin stretched his wings, moved his muscles and bones, feeling an unprecedented comfort.\nThis is the confidence that comes with power.\nNow, he already had the confidence to stand firm within the Kawa Great Forest.\n\"In a few years, when I ascend to Legendary, the war in the Great Forest will probably be over, hmm, this time the Beastman Tribe Alliance must have suffered significant losses, just in time, when those legends leave, the Kawa Great Forest will be my, Austin’s, era!\"\nBack then, with only a few subordinate beastmen under his command, he wanted to establish a Beastman Empire.\nNow, after only a few years, he had already glimpsed a ray of hope.\nAll that remained was to wait until the end of the war.\nBut, can he really ascend to Legendary in a few years?\nActually, Austin himself was not very sure.\nThere is a great difference between the Legendary and peak Gold Levels.\nWhile dragons reach Legendary upon maturity due to the advantage of their bloodline, relying on the awakening of the Law Origin within the Giant Dragon Bloodline to automatically enter the Legendary Realm,\nalthough Austin was a giant dragon, achieving legendary status before maturity was no easier than for other creatures.\nAchieving Legendary as a juvenile offered no particular advantage.\nWithout some great opportunity, it is difficult.\nHowever, if he could ascend to Legendary through his efforts, he might gain more benefits.\n\"Forget it, I still have at least a hundred years before I reach maturity, I’ll consider future matters then.\"\nThe young dragons of his age must still be struggling at the Silver Level.\nThinking of this, Austin’s mood improved significantly.\nCasting aside various thoughts, Austin flapped his wings, stirring the wind attribute elements in the surrounding void, causing a fierce storm to rise around him.\nHis massive form, under a powerful lift, soared upward, heading towards the direction of the Dragon Nest Tribe.",

      "content": "Chapter 315: Chapter 311: Shadow Stripe Tiger People (Third Update, Seeking Monthly Pass)\nA hundred miles away from the Dragon Nest Tribe, amidst a certain mountain range.\nA group of powerful beastmen walked through the mountains, murderous aura permeating and soaring into the sky.\n\"Master Vira, up ahead is the tribe of that Blue Young Dragon. It’s said that the former greatest warrior of the Blood Claw Tribe also met their end at its hands. Are we really going to barge right in?\"\nAs they walked, a beastman with a sharp face cautiously asked the leader, a dark-striped tiger beastman who exuded a domineering presence like a giant iron tower.\nThey were the emissaries dispatched by the Legendaries.\nAt the forefront was the dark-striped tiger beastman, Vira, a powerful half-legendary warrior.\nHowever, in front of the Legendaries, they could only obediently play the role of messengers, tasked with uniting and rallying the forces from all directions to form a coalition army against the Beastman Royal Court.\nAlong this journey, they traveled thousands of kilometers, visiting any tribe with a bit of strength.\nEven small and medium-sized tribes scattered across the Forest Land with only a few hundred people were not left out. Of course, they wouldn’t waste time personally visiting each one to showcase their strength one by one.\nTo this end, not a single beastman tribe refused.\nBecause, the leaders of any tribe that refused had all perished.\nAlong the way, the beastmen crushed by the powerful strength of the dark-striped tiger beastman Vira numbered no less than a thousand, including several Silver-level tribal leaders, and even some Gold-level beastmen met their demise at his hands.\nDisagree?\nKill those who disagree, and the rest will naturally comply.\nOne by one, the beastman tribes were subdued and integrated, even some intelligent alien creatures were incorporated into the coalition.\nThis was the will of the Legendaries: the strong reign supreme, defy and perish!\n\"Hahaha, a mere Gold-level creature dares to call itself the greatest warrior? Do you think I’m of the same ilk as that thing?\"\nThe dark-striped tiger beastman laughed heartily, his voice shaking the void, causing the sharp-faced beastman to bleed from his nose and mouth.\n\"Yes, yes, my lord’s divine might is naturally invincible. A measly Blue Dragon is just something that’ll kneel at your feet and kiss the dirt by your toes.\"\nFear surged in his heart as he fawned repeatedly.\n\"Hmm, you’re good. Don’t worry. Are you sure that Young Dragon has no backing?\"\n\"Master Vira, this is certain. The nearby beastmen all know that dragon appeared alone a few years ago. Initially, he hunted and foraged on his own. Even after establishing a Clan Tribe, no adult Giant Dragons have been seen visiting. It’s definitely an orphaned dragon or an exiled Young Dragon.\"\nThe sharp-faced beastman chattered away, revealing almost all of Austin’s background.\n\"Just a Young Dragon, then. Although it has some capabilities, it’s nothing more than that.\"\nVira grinned, revealing fearsome fangs, then looked over at the sharp-faced beastman who had stopped beside him.\n\"Very good, mud spawn, you’ve pleased me. What reward do you want?\"\nUnder Vira’s gaze, the beastman suddenly felt a mountain-like pressure descend on his shoulders, feeling both fear and excitement.\n\"Master Vira, I...\"\nHowever, he hadn’t finished speaking.\nSplut!\nSuddenly, his head exploded, spraying red and white all over the ground.\nThe headless beastman stood there as hot blood gushed from his neck, splattering onto the ground.\nVira didn’t spare him a glance, continuing forward, and the team behind followed suit, ignoring the corpse as they walked past.\n\"On second thought, rewards are too much trouble, so let’s just kill him. Everyone, push on a bit more. Before it gets dark, your lord wants to rest in that Dragon Nest Tribe!\"\nThe team moved far away, leaving only a headless body behind.\nSoon, the wild beasts that had been intimidated by the group’s presence began to gather around, devouring the corpse.\nBeastmen have hierarchies as well.\nIn front of a powerful being, that sharp-faced beastman was just a backcountry native, ranking even below a slave.\nA group of mountain monkeys, actually expecting a reward?\nHaving the opportunity to serve a noble was already their greatest fortune.\nUnfortunately, that beastman hadn’t realized this.\nSo, he died, left by the roadside, becoming food for wild beasts.\n...\nWithin the Dragon Nest Tribe, the entire tribe efficiently operated, steadily developing.\n\"His Highness has been in seclusion for over a winter now. Who knows when he will emerge.\"\nThe term ’seclusion’ was brought by Austin.\nTo the beastmen, power was gained through battle, more battle, and breakthroughs in battle.\nAustin’s method of gaining strength through seclusion was something they’d never heard of—it could only be said that a dragon does extraordinary things.\nAs Austin’s admirers, the beastmen of the Dragon Nest Tribe weren’t surprised.\n\"Indeed, without His Highness, it’s hard to make decisions, especially with the current state of war. The Dragon Nest Tribe might be facing a great danger.\"\nAt this moment, inside the City Hall, looking out the window at the rising clusters of buildings below.\nThe administrator, Vini, was having a daily conversation with Quik.\n\"His Highness mentioned that this war is likely being orchestrated from behind by Legendaries on the Beastman Tribe Alliance side. Now that the Tribe Alliance has suffered a major defeat with significant losses, if the Legendaries refuse to give up, they’ll have to seek reinforcements elsewhere.\"\n\"Does that mean the Dragon Nest Tribe is destined to be drawn into this war? Back then, the Tribe Alliance did send emissaries to us, but His Highness refused them. This time, it seems difficult to avoid being drawn in.\"\n\"It seems avoiding war is indeed unlikely.\"\nThe atmosphere suddenly turned heavy.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe was not afraid of war, but they had no desire to be dragged into a war with no benefit.\nAfter Austin destroyed the Pyramid, the Beastman Royal Court in the core region had stopped sending the Undead Army against the Dragon Nest Tribe, so there hadn’t been much conflict.\nMoreover, the coalition beastman army numbering millions from the Tribe Alliance hadn’t even reached the core region before suffering devastating attacks.\nThough the Dragon Nest Legion was strong, in a war of this magnitude, they would likely suffer heavy losses.\nHowever, no matter how unwilling, in the end, they had to join.\nAfter all, that was the will of the Legendaries.\n\"Since it’s unavoidable, let Rodney train the army and prepare for battle. We must showcase our strength and not rely entirely on His Highness. Besides, from the Beastman Royal Court, perhaps those weapons are few in number.\"\n\"As long as those weapons don’t appear on the battlefield, our tribe’s legion can sweep through those so-called pure-bloods!\"\nVini let out a long sigh, making a decision.\nHowever, unexpectedly, Quik’s heavy expression remained unchanged.\n\"Vini, the Beastman Royal Court isn’t that simple.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nVini looked at Quik, eyes filled with inquiry.\nAfter a moment’s hesitation, Quik finally spoke up, though his voice was strained:\n\"Vini, actually, I come from the core region and have witnessed certain things. Pure-blooded beastmen are far more terrifying than you imagine....\"\nQuik’s words, though not loud, stirred waves of shock in the heart of Vini the Kobold.\n\"What?!!!\"\nYet before he could inquire further.\nBoom!!!\nA thunderous roar suddenly erupted in the heavens, followed by a tsunami-like torrent accompanied by flying debris, covering the entire Dragon Nest Tribe.\nIn an instant, more than half of the buildings in the Dragon Nest Tribe collapsed.\n\"Young ones, get out here and welcome your Lord Vira!\"",

A terrifying aura permeated the void, descending from the sky.\nWithin the whole Dragon Nest Tribe, all Dragon Nest Beastmen felt as if a mountain was weighing heavily on their shoulders.\n\"Enemy attack!!!\"\n\"Someone’s attacking, everyone assemble!\"\nAccompanied by roars, Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers swiftly emerged from all directions, forming neat military formations to surround the giant gap filled with swirling dust.\nThe rolling dust rose high, the tall walls blasted open a huge breach, shattered bricks and wood scattered across the ground.\n\"Who are you!\"\nGazing at the powerful figures emerging from the breach, the leading Beastman Officer among the Dragon Nest Beastman army shouted loudly.\n\"Tsk tsk, so this is the tribe established by that dragon? Not bad, the army indeed appears somewhat elite, perfect as top-grade cannon fodder.\"\nAs the smoke and dust gradually dissipated, figures stepped forth.\nAt the forefront, dark-patterned tiger-man Vira held a Dragon Nest Beastmen soldier’s head, casually snapped it, and dropped it like a useless snake, smashing it into pulp.\nHis gaze swept casually around,\ninstantly, Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers around felt an overwhelming pressure surging like a tidal wave.\nThe space where the dark-patterned tiger-man stood, radiated such strong power it seemed to dim the very light!\n\"Summon your foolish dragon here, your Lord Vira has orders.\"\nWith a commanding presence, the dark-patterned tiger-man’s deep voice filled with arrogance.\nThis is his style in handling everything.\nAlong the way, achieving victories over stronger tribes directly, subduing their leaders, then issuing orders to unite the armies with an overwhelming announcement.\nThose daring to resist were dealt with simply by being killed, leaving those alive inclined to organize the troops.\nThis approach proved highly effective, especially in this wilderness where might rules and only the strong survive.\nMoreover, to quickly gather a sufficient amount of cannon fodder, this was the only method.\nWith his Half-Legendary level, this overbearing approach encountered no resistance.\nNow, dark-patterned tiger-man Vira applied this crude and simple style to the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nKilling a batch of people, then facing the Blue Young Dragon to relay the orders.\nIf disobedient, crush with force or neutralize.\n\"Courting death! You’re provoking His Highness!\"\nVira’s words immediately incited boundless fury among the Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers.\nIn every Beastman’s heart in the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin, who created the entire Dragon Nest Tribe, is almost like a deity to them, how could they let him be easily insulted?\nAt that moment, the leading Beastman Officer in the Dragon Nest army instantly took action.\nStepping on the ground, his figure shot up, agile like a streak of black lightning, appearing above dark-patterned tiger-man Vira.\n\"You scum insulting His Highness, die!\"\nA punch crashed from the sky, as if carrying a colossal force, like a small mountain smashing down from above.\n\"Hmm? Such an interesting way of exerting force, but, a mere Silver Level ant, who gave you the courage to challenge me?\"\nThe dark-patterned tiger-man Vira showed a ferocious expression, a huge hand burst through the air, surprisingly overtaking, like lightning piercing through the Beastman Officer’s defense, grabbing his head.\nAs if gripping the surrounding air, the void sank, the immense power lifted Beastman Officer’s head, slamming it down heavily.\nBoom!!!\nWith a massive roar, blood burst forth with rock and soil, the ground collapsed, cracks like a spider web spread across.\nIn an instant, the Beastman Officer’s head was crushed, the body embedded upside down in the mud pit.\nBut that’s not all!\n\"Scram!\"\nWatching Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers charging ahead, Vira roared, like thunder echoing.\nAs if a storm surged from flatland, visible shockwaves rippled.\nThe assembling Dragon Nest Beastman Legion was swept away in the torrent, further Beastmen retreated like dominoes from the violent impact.\nWith just one roar, the first hundred soldiers gathered were defeated like fallen leaves!\n\"The enemy is too strong! Soldiers withdraw, all officers take action, capture this scum insulting His Highness!\"\nAt this moment, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe mobilized almost completely.\nThe army quickly prepared, powerful Beastman Generals arriving ahead.\nIn an instant, multiple Beastman Officers leapt into the air, using the power of kicking the air, shot like cannonballs.\nOne by one, Fighting Qi Rasengan whistled in the air, crashing towards the dark-patterned tiger-man.\n\"Another strange combat technique, get lost, you damned muddy mongrels!\"\nFacing several Beastman Officers’ attack, Vira roared, his Fighting Qi erupted like a volcano.\nHalf-Legendary power burst forth instantly, like a vast ocean wave surging in the void.\nHolding a Fighting Qi Rasengan, the rapidly approaching Beastman Officers were struck by the explosive aura, their bodies suddenly stiffened.\nThe next moment, a long whip shadow swept past, the airborne Beastman Officers hit like being struck by lightning, flew away with even greater speed.\n\"A bunch of little rats dare to defy an elephant’s majesty? Since the cowardly dragon won’t come out, today I shall slaughter here!\"\nVira’s voice, deep as thunder, resonated between heaven and earth, beneath him the aura surged like waves, reflecting him as if a Demon God from mythology.\nA domineering gaze swept across the sky, treating them like dead men, imposing suffocating pressure on each Beastman.\n\"Die!\"\nVira stomped on the ground, the earth within several meters collapsed.\nEnormous power erupted at his feet, eyes flashing with bloodthirsty light.\nHis companions stepped back.\nBecause, this state of Vira signifies yet another round of slaughter!\nAs it was before, perhaps so it will be now!\nYet just as Vira prepared to act, to kill these Dragon Nest Beastmen in front of him, suddenly, his hair stood on end!",

like a bucket of icy cold water poured over the head.\nNot good!\nIn the next moment, Vira, the dark-striped Tiger Man, suddenly awakened.\nSuddenly, an overwhelming, terrifying pressure abruptly descended from the sky, carrying an aura of annihilation, instantly covering Vira, the dark-striped Tiger Man, completely.\n\"Who gave you the courage to cause trouble on my territory?\"\nA voice, seemingly from beyond the heavens, resounded, faintly accompanied by waves of thundering anger, with murderous intent almost freezing the surrounding space at this moment.\nBuzz!!!\nAn intensely radiant halo appeared out of nowhere in the void before his eyes, its invisible power distorting the air.\nVira’s hair stood on end, as if facing the scythe of Death, his body instinctively flitting backward in a rapid retreat.\nSilently, the light blossomed.\nThen, the light sphere abruptly expanded, swallowing up the entire space where Vira, the dark-striped Tiger Man, had just been.\nThe halo suddenly inflated, its diameter spreading to several meters in an instant, its radiance severing the vacuum, as if slicing away the space.\nFortunately, it did not continue to explode, the brilliant light only flared for a few seconds, the light sphere did not diffuse or explode but gradually dissipated, leaving a huge void in its wake, the ground underneath also vanishing into a large pit.\nSplash!\nAs if a massive void had torn open in the ocean, air surged in like tides, stirring the void like seismic waves.\n\"This is... the Law!\"\nVira, the dark-striped Tiger Man, who had retreated to the back, looked at the giant rift before him with lingering fear.\nIf he hadn’t reacted quickly, he would surely have suffered heavy damage this time.\nTo master the Law so effortlessly and to wield its destructive power without letting it spread but dispersing it easily instead.\nHalf-Legendary!\nIn an instant, Vira had a clear understanding of Austin’s strength.\nDamn it!\nThis dragon turned out to be Half-Legendary, and at an extremely powerful level among them, who the hell said he was just Gold Level!\nAt some point, Austin’s figure had appeared above the Dragon Nest Tribe, the whirlwinds spiraled between heaven and earth, gathering a storm of swirling clouds that shrouded the entire heavens in an abyss of unfathomable darkness.\nThe vast aura swept across the sky, shaking the surrounding void like a surging sea.\nWatching the sky ahead dim, with shadows cast over the sky, the dark-striped Tiger Man nearly cursed aloud.\nThe intelligence on this dragon was never accurate.\n\"I didn’t expect Your Excellency to have already reached the threshold of the Legendary, sorry, this time it was my offense.\"\nA myriad of thoughts flickered through Vira’s mind as he nodded slightly at Austin, expressing apology, though the apology lacked sincerity.\nSince they were at Half-Legendary, with strength similar to his, refusing to fight was not an option.\nBut fortunately, he was carrying out orders from those Legendary behind him, so there was no need to be overly humble, just offer a slight concession.\nHowever, Vira overlooked one point.\nIn the eyes of other Half-Legendaries, subordinates and clans being easily fought and killed didn’t matter.\nThe existence of a Half-Legendary was nearing the doors of the Legendary, not easily offending another powerful contender of the same rank over a few subordinate lives.\nBut, Austin was an exception.\nThe education from a previous life reminded him of a phrase he deeply remembered: \"Those who offend my strong Han shall be punished, no matter how distant they are!\"\nIn this Otherworld, he no longer had the blood of that nation, but his thoughts remained aligned.\nThe Clan Beastmen were his people, the Beastmen belonging to his Clan Tribe!\nThey were the treasures Austin had painstakingly trained, the seeds for the nation he would build in the future!\nWhen Vira ruthlessly cut down the Dragon Nest Beastmen, with their blood on his hands, it symbolized an unending feud with Austin, with no possibility of conciliation.\n\"You bastards, you really think I’m a sick cat if I don’t show my power, go to hell!\"\nIn the sky above, Austin’s rage surged to the heavens.\nTremendous pressure descended from the sky, like a mountain crushing down on Vira and the other Beastman envoys.\nFrom the moment the tribe was established, they had been repeatedly attacked, suffering severe damages time and again.\nHe merely wanted a place to farm and cultivate peacefully, why wouldn’t some people let him live quietly?\nWhy would they force him to kill!\nDid they really take Austin as a clay effigy with no temper?\nThis time, Vira’s brutal massacre of the Dragon Nest Beastmen completely unleashed the pent-up hostility within Austin.\nBoom!!!\nA terrifying aura surged to the sky, piercing through the void of heaven and earth.\nAt some point, four phantom Divine Swords containing a mysterious and profound aura rose from the nether realm, their aura spreading like sunlight over the long river of stars, engulfing the heavens and earth.\nSimultaneously, four divine roars resounded from distant ethereal heavens.\nThe phantoms of the Cyan Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise rose from the four Law Divine Swords, their aura converging across the sky and earth, forming a complete cycle of harmonious unity.\nThe entire space, at that moment, seemed to be cleaved apart, entrapping all of them within!\n\"Damn Blue Dragon! Are you challenging the authority of the Legendary Lords?\"\nThe dark-striped Tiger Man did not know why Austin suddenly attacked, nor did he understand what the sword shadows sealing the space were.\nBut the blinding killing intent sweeping from all around made him truly feel Austin’s resolute determination to kill him without delay!\nThe overwhelming killing intent, like thorns in his back!\nAustin did not respond,\nBy then, he had made up his mind to use this arrogant guy as a sacrificial banner.\nWith the blood of a Half-Legendary powerhouse, to tell all who dared to attack the Dragon Nest Tribe that there was only one end for provocateurs!\nWith a gentle hum of Sword Dao, threads of aura severed the void, as if spilled from the Milky Way, pouring down toward Vira, the dark-striped Tiger Man.\nDense and innumerable, each strand of Sword Qi carried the aura of Law, like a torrential storm, slicing the space into countless sword scars.\n\"Damn it, what’s this lunatic up to!\"\nA look of utter shock appeared on the face of Vira, the dark-striped Tiger Man.\nBoth in awe at Austin’s sudden frenzy, and shocked by this incredibly strange yet overwhelmingly lethal attack technique!\nA type of attack he’d never seen before, extremely peculiar, yet it instilled a profound sense of fear and oppression from deep within.\nThe four strange longswords hovering in the four cardinal directions formed an indescribable connection in the unseen,\ncapable of ending his life!",

I’d like to see what gives you the confidence!\"\nHis monstrous body, already three to four meters tall, rose even further, the ground beneath him cracked inch by inch, and a fierce wind swept around.\nMomentum skyrocketed, as if transformed into a giant, Vira raised his fist to the sky, launching an explosive punch upwards at the incoming sword aura.\nBoom!!!\nLike wind, like tsunami, like thundering eruption, seemingly, a divine demon from ancient times emerged from the void, delivering a punch through the myriad realms.\nIt was as if the space shattered, visible shockwaves rippled outward, raising violent winds between heaven and earth.\nBoom boom boom!!!\nFist and swords collided; the explosion of sword lights dissipated the giant fist’s power bit by bit, visibly fading the black fist shadow.\nUltimately, after a breath’s worth of collision, countless sword shadows shattered one after another, and the towering fist shadow collapsed into fragments.\n\"What!\"\nWatching his full-force punch shatter, Vira’s pupils contracted sharply.\nBut before he could react, the sky full of sword shadows poured down at supersonic speed instantly.\nBoom boom boom!!!\nThousands of sword lights fell, under the continuous sharp aura bombardment, the space and ground broke into pieces, collapsing, raising a cloud of dust, dyeing half the sky yellow.\nAll around, the beastmen, whether Dragon Nest Beastmen or Tribe Alliance envoys, watched with mouths agape, faces filled with astonishment.\nThe strength reached such a degree, akin to possessing the power to change heaven and earth!\nThis is Legendary power!\nEven though neither one dragon nor one beastman has entered that realm.\nBut merely a Half-Legendary duel already holds the might to destroy mountains and devastate rivers!\nAustin hovered above the ninth heaven, his gaze deep.\nThe endless sharp aura transformed into sword lights persisted for a while, seeming to obliterate the area where Vira stood, before finally ceasing.\nThe dust clouded the view.\nUnable to see the situation below.\nSilence fell around.\nIn the dust, there were no sounds, Vira the Dark-striped Tiger seemed to have turned into powder under the previous bombardment of sword shadows.\nSuddenly, Austin’s eyes narrowed.\n\"Law of Power?\"\nThere was an inexplicable meaning in his voice.\n\"This path of proving life through power...\"\nOf course, this proving life through power is far from the grand feat of the Pangu god who created the world with human power, still thousands of miles away.\nBelow, the dust gradually dispersed, revealing Vira the Dark-striped Tiger’s battered figure.\nAt this moment, on the ground, a pit hundreds of meters in diameter was blasted, above it floated Vira, heavily wounded, glaring at Austin in the sky.\n\"Brat, you’ve angered me! Next, I’ll let you taste what fear truly is!\"\nFor the first time, pushed to such an extent.\nIf he hadn’t decisively used the Law of Power, amplifying his might several times over to withstand the thousands of sword lights, he would likely be a corpse by now!\nAnger, unparalleled anger erupted in his chest, already drowning his reason!\nBefore his words were completed,\nBoom!!!\nAccompanied by Vira the Dark-striped Tiger’s fierce roar, resounding across the heavens and earth, a terrifying aura swept skyward.\nIn that moment, he was like a mad dragon plunging into the ninth heaven, his body emitting black fighting Qi, the rolling aura transforming into smoke rising to the sky, within a kilometer radius the void became a storm-laced ocean!\nWhile still in mid-air,\nhe swung a punch across the void, aimed at Austin in the sky.\nBoom!!!\nThis punch, imbued all his life’s beliefs.\nThe void, seemingly empty, under this punch, surging like a tsunami, producing continuous explosions.\nSpace in that moment trembled like a mirror, shattered, deep cracks spread through the void, seemingly engulfing all light above and below.\nUnder the amplification of all Law of Power, this punch shattered the space, condensed into a phenomenal spectacle of destruction!",

      "content": "Chapter 320: Chapter 316 Special\nThe spiral sphere formed by the fusion of four attribute powers generates a force nearly sixteen times greater than that of a single attribute spiral sphere.\nThis force is not merely a simple addition; it is a true, multiplied destructive amplification.\nOnce the destructive force contained within it erupts, even the Four Symbols Sword Array will suffer significant damage.\nIf the aftermath of the explosion were to breach the sword array, it might cause a devastating impact on the entire Dragon Nest Tribe.\nFortunately, the newly created sword array is strong enough; amidst the powerful convergence of energies, it ultimately suppresses the explosive force within, dissipating it into the void.\nHowever, while the final expansive force was suppressed and dissipated by the Four Spirits Sword Array, the terrifying destructive force nonetheless exerted a mighty impact on the sword array. The energy cracks that had already appeared during the struggle against the dark-marked tiger man Vira now manifested as dense fractures, as if about to collapse.\nThe Four Spirits Sword Array, on its first appearance, was already severely damaged and on the verge of collapse.\nAfter all, it was newly created, with imperfections still present.\nHowever, compared to its achievements, it deserved to be truly considered glorious.\nA Half-Legendary existence was easily slain by Austin within the bindings of the Four Spirits Sword Array.\nIf it weren’t for this Four Spirits Sword Array, never mind whether Vira could be slain; in a life-and-death battle, Austin might have suffered severe injury on the spot.\nThough the multi-attribute spiral sphere is powerful, it takes time to condense, and if it misses the enemy, it serves no purpose.\n\"The Four Spirits Sword Array is indeed impressive in power, but now it can only be considered in a preliminary state; hence it won’t shatter so easily. It still needs further enhancement.\"\nLooking at the densely fractured surroundings in the space of the Four Spirits Sword Array about to shatter after a huge battle, Austin sighed slightly in his heart. With a motion of his spiritual power, the four Law Divine Swords stationed at the four corners transformed into streams of light and returned within his body following his thoughts.\nIndeed, it was unfortunate for the sword array; in its debut battle, it encountered Vira, who had comprehended the Law of Power. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have reached the brink of collapse.\n\"Completely dead.\"\nBelow, the earth surged with dust to the sky, and the aura of the dark-marked tiger man Vira had completely dissipated.\nMoreover, Austin had already sensed the aura of the Law Origin in the void.\nWithout any hesitation, Austin flew down from the sky, descending into the dust.\nIn the pit where Vira’s figure was now absent, there was only a mass of the Power Law Origin.\nWithout much hesitation,\nAustin directly swallowed the Power Law Origin on the verge of merging into the void in one gulp.\nPerhaps because it doesn’t contain powerful elemental forces like other Elemental Law Origins, or maybe because Austin’s level increased to Half-Legendary, and his body, hardened by the tempering of lava, was as robust as steel.\nIn any case, after swallowing the Power Law Origin, Austin merely felt a slight fullness in his stomach without suffering much impact.\nThis was good; there was no need to endure the previous kind of ordeal.\nOnce the Power Law Origin is devoured and refined, his combat strength will surely rise to another level.\nHaving mastered five laws at Half-Legendary, never mind other Half-Legendaries; even some newly ascended Legendaries, may not have sensed that many laws.\nThe perception of laws becomes increasingly difficult as one progresses.\nEspecially after reaching Legendary, due to the influence of one’s own Law Origin Path, it’s hard to perceive other laws.\nIt can be said that Austin now, compared to some weaker Legendaries, is already walking a path that advances further.\nOf course, this progress is not unrelated to his innate ability to devour laws.\nAnd Austin herself would not know at this moment what this capability represents.\nIn the future, he will discover.\nEven among all the top bloodline Dragon Race, the success rate of devouring a third law is pitifully low, and due to various reasons, may even cause more harm than good.\nOnly he is special...\nIn the huge pit, aside from the devoured Power Law Origin, nothing else was left.\nIt seems the dark-marked tiger man Vira is thoroughly obliterated.\nHaving swallowed the Power Law Origin, Austin did not linger, spreading his wings and flying out.\nWith Austin’s appearance, the whole Dragon Nest Tribe was enveloped in a fervent atmosphere.\nThe remarkable might created the glory of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAll this made Austin an object of fanatical worship in the hearts of all Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nCompared to the fervent cheers of the Dragon Nest Beastmen, the Alliance envoys were as silent as cicadas in cold.\nEven Half-Legendary Ambassador Vira was dead; what could they possibly do?\nAustin descended before them, and under that great shadow, the pressure was even more overwhelming.\n\"Great His Highness Blue Dragon, we only come in accordance with the will of your excellencies, if any offense was caused during this process, please forgive us.\"\nCompared to their previous haughty demeanor, now these Beastmen’s expressions were as humble as could be.\nHowever, Austin still keenly noticed something peculiar about the speaking Beastman envoy. From his words and actions, perhaps his status wasn’t simple, at least he was intelligent...\nAustin was also temporarily unwilling to break ties with those few Legendaries,\nLooking down at the crowd, a deep voice sounded:\n\"That fool killed my Clan, insulted me to my face, so I killed him; I ask the Alliance ambassadors to understand.\"\nThe one causing trouble in the Dragon Nest Tribe was the dark-marked tiger man Vira. Although other Beastmen envoys held haughty postures, they did not take action.\nAustin did not intend to eliminate all of them.\nAfter all, even though Austin was now Half-Legendary, he still needed to show a certain reverence for those high-ranking Legendary Level existences.\nThose hidden Legendaries’ words made Vira find no peace.\nThus, the tense atmosphere finally eased.\nAustin ordered Vini to host, leading the envoys into the grand hall for discussion.\nIn comparison to the dark-marked tiger man Vira, who had enough strength to act arrogantly, the remaining frightened deputy envoys were evidently more tactful.\nAfterwards, in the grand hall, when Austin moved spiritually and displayed the crystal scale left by a bald-headed middle-aged man from over half a year ago.\nA Beastman among the Alliance envoys immediately exclaimed:\nCelestial Dragon Island!\nAfterward, the Alliance Beastman envoys never uttered requests for Austin to send troops for counterattacks; instead, they kept bowing and apologizing.\nEvidently, among these Alliance envoys, Ambassador Vira was tasked with using his fists to subdue most unyielding factions, forcing them to unite and send troops. The deputy envoys possessed certain insights to avoid offending their own.\nIt’s unfortunate that the circumstances were unpredictable, and Vira ultimately died at Austin’s hands.",

      "content": "Chapter 321: Chapter 317 Post-War Reconstruction\nIt seems that the Celestial Dragon Island mentioned by Guppa and Avril initially appears to be a formidable force. Even after Austin killed their Half-Legendary envoy, they dared not retaliate in the slightest but instead sought to mend relations with all efforts.\nApparently, the tiger skin Austin currently wields is far larger than he had imagined.\nMoreover, after Austin presented that Crystal Dragon Scale, the attitude of these Alliance envoys changed dramatically, leading Austin to ponder further.\nOriginally, according to Avril, they were invited to reroute through here.\nAnd it seems that the bald middle-aged man named Guppa was summoned to discuss this matter.\nGuppa was well-versed in the recent war in the Kawa Great Forest, possibly even directly involved; otherwise, he wouldn’t have warned against involvement before departing.\nIt’s unclear why the Crystal Dragons are connected to this matter and what place they intend to visit, referred to as Celestial Dragon Island.\nAustin is quite interested in the Celestial Dragon Island that Guppa and his group invited him to.\nUnfortunately, it’s not the time to poke holes in the tiger skin, making it difficult for Austin to inquire deeply about too much, lest the facade falls apart.\nThe envoys from the Beastman Alliance stayed here for a day and then departed.\nThey headed straight back to the base camp.\nAfter such an incident, it’s inevitable that they must return to report, especially since the key combatant, the dark-striped Tiger Beastman Vira, has perished. The next joint campaign will certainly require another strong figure to suppress those beastmen powers.\nAustin did not obstruct them, watching the envoys depart while a weight lifted from his heart.\nA Half-Legendary is dead, along with the tiger skin of Celestial Dragon Island backing.\nIn the future, the development of the Dragon Nest Tribe shouldn’t encounter any obstruction from those major forces.\nWhen news of the Half-Legendary’s death spreads, regardless of the external turmoil it may cause, at least for the Dragon Nest Tribe, there will be a relatively stable period for some time.\nPatiently developing for a few years, one day, Austin might ascend to Legendary status, able to roam freely, and the Dragon Nest Tribe could take advantage of the post-war lull to directly rule over the entire Kawa Great Forest.\n\"Let’s hope everything goes smoothly.\"\nWatching the Alliance envoys leave, Austin thought quietly.\nThe Beastman Royal Court in the core area was virtually besieged globally, with numerous Legendaries secretly orchestrating the whole thing, seeming destined for defeat.\nYet, Austin felt a vague uneasiness.\nHe recalled the Fallen Divine Kingdom beneath the volcanic cluster domain near the second outpost of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nThat’s most likely the Divine Kingdom of the Fallen Beast God, and judging by the reaction of the old priest’s remnant soul back then, someone associated with the old priest, or something else, took the most important thing from that Divine Kingdom.\nAlso, the mysterious crystal acquired after destroying the Pyramid...\nPossibly, the person who took the item has joined the Beastman Royal Court and, using some unknown method, has instigated this grand war.\nHowever, according to the Elf Queen, weren’t the Beastman Empire and the Elf Royalty allies back then and all deemed god desecrators? How did the pure-blooded beastmen of the Royal Court then end up associating with the Divine?\nAnd those Undead, which Austin viewed as essentially zombie-like creatures transformed in this world, where did those pure-blooded beastmen acquire these things?\n\"Forget it, today’s counterattack is fueled by numerous Legendaries from behind the scenes, and there might be the tactics of the Divine as well, concerning the descendants of the Empire established by god desecrators, it’s nothing worth fretting overtoo much.\nThoughts twisted into knots in his mind, Austin shook his head and pushed the multitude of thoughts away.\nAs long as he remained uninvolved in this war, with the Dragon Nest Tribe in a secluded area, they should face no significant trouble.\nHe’s already decided to stay low during the war years.\n...\nWith the departure of the Beastman Alliance envoys, the Dragon Nest Tribe began cleaning up the aftermath and reconstructing Dragon Nest Tribe City.\nThis attack was led personally by the dark-striped Tiger Beastman Vira, swiftly cutting down the patrolling beastman troops before they had time to signal, allowing for an unimpeded advance.\nThis revealed the Dragon Nest Tribe’s inadequacies in defending against such super-powerful entities.\nTo address this issue, the Dragon Nest Tribe has decided to establish a watchtower on the mountaintops surrounding Dragon Nest Tribe City for external observation.\nAt least they could receive pivotal information before the enemy strikes.\nMeanwhile, the architecture of Dragon Nest Tribe City also poses quite a challenge.\nInitially, to prevent fires, Austin instructed the beastmen to construct houses with a mixed wood and brick structure.\nBack then, manpower was insufficient, preventing a full transition to brick and stone structures, relying on these wood-brick hybrid houses for interim solutions.\nDuring a mercenary invasion later on, infiltrating human mercenaries started fires throughout the tribe city, and these houses played a significant role in preventing uncontrolled fire spread.\nBut now, these wood-brick hybrid houses are clearly not suitable for the Dragon Nest Tribe’s current situation.\nIn earlier years, in the hot and rainy climate of the Kawa Great Forest, some supporting wooden beams had already begun rotting, becoming rather dilapidated.\nAfter Vira’s previous assault, numerous houses collapsed under excessive weight.\nNo casualties were caused, but reconstruction is necessary.\nGiving the need for rebuild, naturally, the choice is to opt for the best available.\nAustin plans to replace the wooden-brick hybrid houses in Dragon Nest Tribe City entirely with brick and stone structures to strengthen the city’s resistance against external shocks like storms.\nFortunately, with the Dragon Nest Tribe’s population boom, human resources aren’t as stretched as they were initially, supporting the new wave of reconstruction work.\nWith Austin overseeing the tribe, the Dragon Nest Tribe embarked on a massive reconstruction.\nMeanwhile, various production and farming efforts haven’t ceased.\nLand cultivation continues, with large amounts of food crops yielded from newly cultivated fields, serving as a vital factor for the Dragon Nest Tribe’s rapid expansion.\nThe grain output from farming allows the Dragon Nest Tribe to accommodate more people and expand its territory further.\nFood production through farming has become a vital source for sustaining Dragon Nest Tribe’s development.\nDuring major reconstruction, the tribe hasn’t halted its external expansion efforts.\nNow, in the area surrounding the main Dragon Nest Tribe location within a hundred miles radius, there are virtually no other beastman tribes, and beyond a hundred miles, because of food transport considerations, it is regarded as an expedition, posing many inconveniences.\nThe outpost plan is innately one of expansion’s original intents.\nLeveraging outposts, consolidating the territory they hold while using them as strongholds for continuous outward expansion.\nBut as time progresses, the second outpost has now reached the limit of population capacity and territorial occupation, further expansion would require more effort and energy, becoming futile, thus they plan to establish a third outpost.",

      "content": "Chapter 322: Chapter 318 Knowledge and Technology\nThe tribe is gradually becoming stronger, as the development of its territory expands, it is slowly spreading its influence externally.\nA vast amount of territory has been incorporated into the control region of the Dragon Nest Tribe, with dangerous beasts, magic beasts, and giant beasts within the territory being cleaned out one by one by the Beastman Legion.\nLarge swathes of area have become a paradise for the peaceful development of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nFor the next long period, the environment in which the Dragon Nest Tribe develops will basically be stable.\nWhat the Dragon Nest Tribe needs most for its development is time.\nFortunately, after Austin slew the Half-Legendary Realm dark-striped tiger man Vira and pulled a tiger pelt from Celestial Dragon Island, the Dragon Nest Tribe is about to experience a relatively stable period.\nExternal wars will not disturb this remote corner.\nIn any case, relying on that tiger pelt in his back, Austin has already extricated himself from that war.\nOr rather, it is precisely because of the broad-reaching war outside that Austin and his Dragon Nest Tribe have drawn away the majority of attention.\nAs long as they develop quietly during the war period, there will basically be no problems.\nAs for the timespan of this war sweeping across the entire Kawa Great Forest, by Austin’s estimation, it won’t end for several years.\nNot to mention the lengthy time needed for the tug-of-war with the Beastman Royal Court, even just the preliminary preparations for gathering a coalition of the various Beastman forces within the Kawa Great Forest require at least over a year.\nIn this uncivilized Barbaric Zone, with no unified government and endless war between the various tribal powers, if not for being subdued by strong power, gathering a large number of Beastmen may not be accomplished in a year.\nMoreover, after gathering the Beastman army, various logistics coordination and the subsequent tug-of-war with the Beastman Royal Court would extend the war for several years with no way of ending it.\nThese few years will be the golden phase of development for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nWith the absorption of the remaining wealth from the Elf Kingdom, the Dragon Nest Tribe now has replenishments in areas they lacked, like crafting extraordinary weapons, alchemy, potion-making, and spellcaster inheritance, supplemented by the rich Magic Resources within the Kawa Great Forest.\nI believe that within these years, the overall strength of the tribe will see a significant increase.\nOf course, since the Elf Kingdom’s defeat was so abrupt, much of the profound knowledge essence didn’t survive, and coupled with the fact that the elves stagnated over the subsequent millennia, the already scant technology faded over time, leaving only the most basic public knowledge.\nWhether in alchemy, potion-making, or extraordinary weapon crafting, it is at most entry-level technological heritage, sufficient only to train an Alchemy Apprentice or attempt basic potion making.\nBut even this is enough.\nEven apprentice-level knowledge is enough to greatly enhance the strength of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nVarious introductory potions, primary alchemy materials, and basic extraordinary weapons, though elementary, are far better than having no foundation at all.\nThe basic extraordinary weapons crafted are always more effective than those ordinary bronze weapons.\nThe basic potions concocted through alchemy are more potent than common herbs.\nAlthough basic, these items have already crossed the barrier of being extraordinary.\nHowever, the material costs to craft these extraordinary items remain quite high, requiring materials imbued with Magic Power to produce.\nEven with the mobilization and collection capacity of the Dragon Nest Tribe, it is impossible to gather too many magic-infused materials.\nMoreover, up till now, the Dragon Nest Tribe has yet to cultivate many talents in potion-making or extraordinary weapon crafting, so these items remain in short supply for the tribe; it’s impossible for every individual to have an extraordinary weapon or a potion bottle.\nIn such circumstances, bronze-forged armor and weapons, along with commonly harvested and processed everyday herbs, remain the prevalently used items in the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nNow, the goblins in the manufacturing workshop have begun trying to use iron ore to forge steel weapons near the volcanic cluster domain around the second base, making use of the rich mineral resources of the volcanic area nearby.\nOnce the forging of steel weapons and armor succeeds, it will only be a matter of time before they replace the bronze armor and weapons on a large scale.\nStill, even steel weapons lag considerably behind the true extraordinary weapons.\nEven with the goblins making significant improvements to the steel forging techniques, replacing the rare extraordinary weapons is impossible.\nFor the foreseeable future, extraordinary weapons will primarily be allocated to Beastman officers and Beastman transcendent beings, while ordinary Beastman soldiers will be outfitted with steel weapons.\nThe potent magic alchemy potions will only be prioritized for critically injured personnel.\nFor a long time to come, the scarcity of production capacity will keep these extraordinary items from becoming widespread, and this situation will persist for quite some time.\n\"Steel, potion-making, extraordinary weapon forging...\"\nIn planning for the future, Austin specifically highlighted these areas.\nThough the knowledge technologies absorbed from the Elf Kingdom are foundational, for the Dragon Nest Tribe, they represent an unparalleled gain.\nThese foundational knowledge harvesting means a leap from zero to one for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nWith these extraordinary power insights from the Elf Kingdom as a base, the Beastmen can gradually elevate and develop more detailed and superior technologies through continued experimentation.\nBack then, the development of the Beastman Six Techniques, the successful forging of bronze weapons, and the establishment of a medical herb system were all achieved through trial and error identification of a correct path.\nNow, it’s the same for the knowledge riches from the Elf Kingdom.\nThose more profound knowledge technologies can ultimately be understood through relentless exploration, potentially crafting a research framework suitable for the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nWith solid foundational groundwork over several years, absorbing the knowledge wealth of the Elf Kingdom, plus Austin’s guidance with some modern thinking theories, what kind of outcomes can be realized is something Austin eagerly anticipates.\nHaving determined some of the general developmental directions for the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin turned his attention to the establishment of the upcoming third base.\nThe first and second bases have expanded to their limits, signaling the time for the third base to be developed.\nBut just before Austin could finalize the location for the third base, Vini and Quik came together to pay respects, revealing some information that swayed his thoughts, causing his original steadfast decision not to participate in the war to waver.",

      "content": "Chapter 323: Chapter 319: Earth-Shattering Secret\nAt the very beginning of the development of the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin felt that the Fox-faced Man, Quik, seemed to have some secret.\nAt that time, he just thought that Quik was probably from a Great Tribe, and there was no need to get to the bottom of it. As the Dragon Nest Tribe gradually expanded and all sorts of affairs increased, Austin put it out of his mind.\nUnexpectedly, one day, Quik, under the collusion of Vini, came to Austin to confess.\nAccording to Quik, he came from the core of the Forest Land and once served the Beastman Royal Court.\nOf course, he was just a nameless low-level soldier, like the Beastman Armor in a background story.\nHowever, with his wit, he managed to gain quite a decent status among the lower-ranking beastmen.\nA role similar to a flattering follower of a Beastman army captain.\nHowever, it was this role that led Quik to accidentally discover some core secrets of the Beastman Royal Court during an unexpected event.\nHe disguised it well later on and wasn’t found out.\nBut not long after, the Beastman army to which Quik belonged received orders from above to leave the core area and go to search the Outer Domain of the Kawa Great Forest for some strange large-eared creatures, namely elves.\nNow it seems that the mission of the army Quik belonged to back then was to search for the remnants of the Elf Kingdom that had escaped years ago.\nUnfortunately, after a thousand years, the traces left by the Elf Kingdom’s escape had long disappeared without a trace.\nIn the vast region of the Kawa Great Forest, trying to find their traces was like looking for a needle in a haystack.\nAnd Quik’s army, likely due to a one-in-a-million chance held by the pure-blooded Beastmen of the Beastman Royal Court, was not very prioritized. Ever since the army left the core area with the mission, they never received any supplies or support.\nThe Royal Court’s army searched outward, and the perilous Forest Land continued to inflict heavy casualties on the army, until during an attack by a swarm of bone ants, Quik fled in panic, getting separated from the Royal Court’s army.\nLater, Quik met Rodney, and a series of events began.\nAustin wasn’t much interested in the arduous experiences Quik went through during the search.\nWhat truly shocked Austin and made him plan to overthrow his previous plans and personally join the war against the Beastman Royal Court was the secret Quik revealed about the Royal Court!\nAn earth-shattering secret!\nThe Beastman Royal Court might possess a method of traveling across worlds!\nAnd moreover, it might very well be the Doomsday Plane they were entering, from where the undead zombies originated!\nBeing a native of this world, Quik certainly wouldn’t know what a Doomsday Plane is.\nAll this, Austin deduced from Quik’s speech.\nAccording to Quik, a Beastman friend he made at the Beastman Royal Court was a guard at a valley warehouse.\nDuring a casual conversation, Quik’s Beastman friend boasted in front of him, using some bizarre items from the valley warehouse as talking points, like an iron horse that roars when drinking pungent water, some strange iron bars that automatically spray fire and cause death, and in his fear, he also leaked words like \"resurrected from death, with rotting flesh-covered moving corpses.\"\nQuik couldn’t understand those bizarre \"magic items\" at all, but he understood that within the Beastman Royal Court, there was an enormous colossal decayed soldier army.\nAccording to that Beastman friend, each colossal decayed soldier was hundreds of meters tall, looking like a mountain from afar.\nThese colossal decayed soldiers gathered together, forming an Iron Wall Great Wall guarding the Royal Court. When needed, these colossal soldier troops would break through the sealing rock layers outside, delivering a disaster-like blow to the enemies.\nQuik was shocked by the Royal Court’s secretive power and also feared being implicated, hence he proactively reduced contact with that Beastman friend.\nLater, it was heard that the Beastman friend encountered an accident and died in a mission.\nFeeling cold-hearted, Quik focused more on hiding himself and only left the core area when dispatched to search for the remnants of the Elf Kingdom.\nAlthough Quik was merely reiterating his Beastman friend’s words, Austin’s scales almost stood on end.\nDespite lacking concrete evidence, his innate intuition told him,\nThe Beastman Royal Court might truly possess a method to travel to the Doomsday World and obtain certain items from it!\nThe undead zombies might actually be real zombies!\nIt was precisely this deduction that stirred within Austin a strong urge to explore the core area.\nIf the Beastman Royal Court indeed had a method to travel to the Doomsday World.\nThen, using that method, could he return to the world of his past life?\nEven now no longer human, Austin still longed to go back and see his homeland.\nMoreover, most importantly, the ability to freely travel worlds almost meant a chance of transcendence!\nIt was only with great difficulty that Austin managed to suppress his urge.\n\"It’s not the time yet, various legendary beings, possibly even the Divine, are watching this war. It’s not my time to get involved yet.\"\nEven if he went, the results he wanted might not be attainable.\nCompeting in front of so many Great Divine Power users, Austin wasn’t sure he’d have the protagonist’s aura, and be the final winner.\nNevertheless, though he pressed down the notion, a seed had already deeply taken root in his heart.\nThe war in the core area, he would ultimately get involved.\nThis required thorough preparation, but fortunately, there were still likely a few years before the final decisive battle.\nAustin began to organize his thoughts.\n\"Traveling the Doomsday World... I wonder what method they used to achieve this. If it’s true that they can travel and bring back certain things, perhaps that groundbreaking explosion was a nuclear bomb.\"\nHis thoughts rapidly churned in his mind.\nInformation, Austin needed information that could help him make a judgment!\nAll of this was just his speculation after all.\nEverything Quik knew had been uncovered, who else might know about the Beastman Royal Court?\nSuddenly, Austin thought of the Elf Kingdom.\nPerhaps the Elf Royal Court, which made an ancient alliance with it, might know something.\n\"According to Quik’s words, it seemed apparent that the Beastman Royal Court only decided to seek out the remnants of the Elf Royal Court about eight or nine years ago. That period coincides with the initial emergence of the undead zombies, and the mystery man took something essential from the Beast God Divine Kingdom to maintain the kingdom... All these changes seem to have occurred around that time period.\"\nNumerous thoughts flashed rapidly through his mind, and Austin frantically sorted through this information mentally.\n\"In that case, perhaps something happened during those years that put immense pressure on the Beastman Royal Court, prompting them to try various methods of self-rescue. At that time, it’s possible that the Legendaries had already decided to overthrow the pure-bloods’ Beastman Royal Court established in the core, and began various probes and actions.\"\n\"Only this could drive those pure-blooded Beastmen to such frenzied action.\"\nBut why do they want to recover the remnants of the Elf Royal Court?\nCould it be that the Beastman Royal Court still hopes the Elf Royal Court will uphold that so-called ancient alliance?\nThe Elf Kingdom must have secrets.\nSome secrets that could enhance the Beastman Royal Court’s power, otherwise, in such a crisis, the Royal Court wouldn’t recall the Elf royals they’d betrayed millennia ago, and even expend efforts searching for them.\nFor the Beastman Royal Court, the remnants of the Elf Kingdom are of such importance, and there’s also that ancient alliance from long ago...\nThe Elves, perhaps, hold some insights into the Beastman Kingdom’s cross-world travels.",

The connections between the elves of that time and the Pure-blooded Beastmen must have been even closer, perhaps the Elf Kingdom also knows a thing or two about world crossing.\"\nHowever, the Pure-blooded Beastmen back then retaliated too quickly, and the fall of the Elf Kingdom was likewise swift.\nAt that time, the Elf Queen was still just a little girl, and moreover, a branch relatively distant from the royal line; those so-called elders left were not the high-ranking members of the Elf Kingdom back then.\nThe true high-ranking members and most of the elf royals died in that rebellion.\nThe Elf Queen didn’t deceive me; she indeed revealed everything she knew, this was Austin’s intuition.\nThe intuition of the Giant Dragon is very keen, and the Elf Queen had no reason to hide anything.\nHowever, as it is, the clues are caught in a dilemma.\nWhen Vinek and others withdrew, Austin fell into deep thought.\nThe clear path ahead gradually became shrouded in fog, and it seemed as though everything had entered a dead end.\nPure-blooded Beastmen, elf royals, Blasphemers, Alliance, Fallen Beast God, various legendary forces, humans, the Divine...\nRecalling the cause and effect, the entire Kawa Great Forest now seems like a gigantic quagmire, entangling all the forces as if it had become the center of all turmoil.\nShould I really get involved in this war?\nThat method of crossing worlds might allow me to return to my homeland for a look.\nEven in my current form, without mastering the Transformation Technique, there’s no way I could return to the original world.\nHowever.\nThe method of crossing planes is really attractive to Austin, and his intuition tells him that if he misses this opportunity, he will regret it for a lifetime.\nIn Austin’s heart, he wavered.\n\"Regardless of whether to go or not, first find out some situations to avoid becoming a pawn or sacrifice in the future, or, there’s someone... no, something that might know some inside story.\"\nAccording to Quik’s words, the Beastman Royal Court is definitely not simple.\nThe counterattack war won’t end overnight, there’s no hurry, there’s still plenty of time.\nCurrently, the most important thing is intelligence information.\nThe remnants of the Elf Kingdom might have missed most of the things, but there is a tree, perhaps it knows the cause and effect.\nThe Elven Mother Tree!\nThat day, Austin left the Dragon Nest Tribe, flying towards the direction of the second base.\nThere, the former Elf Kingdom station was connected with the second base, relying on each other to form the second base tribe.\nThe Elven Mother Tree has always been growing there, relying on the power of the surrounding forest land, supporting the space where the Elf Kingdom survives.\nShortly after, Austin appeared above the second base.\nGazing down at the towering trees below, Austin’s eyes flickered.\nAt first, when attacking the Elf Kingdom, the Elven Mother Tree had intervened, blocking Austin’s Attribute Rasengan attack.\nAt that time, Austin seemed to feel a sigh.\nJust later, he didn’t think much of it, especially when he had just consumed the Wind Law Origin and was about to find a place to refine it.\nOnce the Wind Law Origin was refined, those trifles were already left behind.\nNow it seems that this Elven Mother Tree very likely possesses wise consciousness.\nAnd this is precisely the reason Austin came here.\nAs a crucial plant maintaining the elf race, perhaps the Elven Mother Tree knows more about certain things than the Elf Queen.\nPossibly, the purpose of the Beastman Royal Court’s army searching the remnants of the Elf Kingdom back then was precisely for this Elven Mother Tree!\n...\nAt this moment, inside the hall where the Elven Mother Tree resides.\nThe Elf Queen is kneeling before the branches of the Mother Tree, sincerely praying in her heart.\nSince the Elf Kingdom was annexed, she was subdued by Austin, and the Elf Queen has always lived in seclusion near the Mother Tree, attending to it daily.\nAll she could do were tasks like these.\nTo the elf clan within the Dragon Nest Tribe now, the Elf Queen is the clan’s representative, symbol, and seal, high above, akin to the role of a priest serving the Divine in a temple.\nIn fact, after more than a year of integration, the elf clan has already merged into the Dragon Nest Tribe in all aspects.\nThe elves are naturally kind and skillful in agriculture, with weaving and other crafts also being quite good. Various alchemy, weapon forging, which were not originally the Dragon Nest Tribe’s techniques, are among the few sources of spellcasters within the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nBetter living conditions have led the elves to continuously split up, tying themselves more closely to the Dragon Nest Tribe’s original system.\nCurrently, the elf race, within the Dragon Nest Tribe, resembles the concept of merged nations in Austin’s past life, with cultural differences only noticeable during certain grand festivals.\nHaving shed her responsibilities, the Elf Queen now dedicates herself to caring for the Mother Tree.\nThe Mother Tree, the cornerstone for the continuation of the elf race.\nCaring for the Mother Tree also aligns with the current position of the Elf Queen.\nAfter praying, she opened her eyes.\nGazing at the enormous tree in front of her, which dozens of people could barely encircle, impossibly tall, supporting a sky-covering canopy, appearing even more lush after the kingdom’s incorporation into the Dragon Nest Tribe, the Elf Queen Eve also felt somewhat complicated.\nThe Mother Tree nurtures the next generation of elves, and its energy doesn’t come out of thin air.\nVarious Magic Ores, Magic Materials, and even the droppings of Magic Beasts or Giant Beasts are sources of magic nurturing the next generation of elves by the Mother Tree.\nBut during these thousand years of hiding and enduring, the elves were confined within their kingdom space, weakened to the extreme, restricted from going out. How could they bring enough Magic Resources to the Mother Tree?\nOne must admit, during that thousand-year period, most of what was consumed to nurture the elf children was by the Mother Tree autonomously absorbing Magic Energy from the forest land.\nAnd they, just like vampires, were leeching on the Mother Tree.\nUntil the kingdom was destroyed, the situation began to change.",

      "content": "Chapter 325: Chapter 321: The Origin of Beastmen\nBefore the Elf Kingdom was assimilated, the impoverished kingdom was unable to provide the Mother Tree with enough Magic Resources, leading to its gradual withering day by day. The leaves turned yellow and fell, the branches became sparse, and fewer buds grew each year.\nThe Elf Queen had long been worried about the Mother Tree’s condition, watching helplessly and feeling anxious, but besides adding to her worries, she could do nothing about it.\nDuring the millennia of hiding in exile, the Elves had lost their courage to forge ahead.\nNesting in the kingdom space supported by the Mother Tree, receiving its protection, they had lost the courage to venture outside.\nUsing the excuse of invincible and powerful foreign enemies, they cowered under the Mother Tree’s protection, eking out a living.\nThey couldn’t even gather the Magic Resources that the Mother Tree needed for growth.\nBefore that, they were like a group of vampires, existing by sucking the lifeblood of the Mother Tree.\nSurviving in the kingdom space by relying on the Mother Tree’s centuries of continuous contribution.\nBut all of this changed after the kingdom’s downfall.\nThe Elves, who were assimilated into the Dragon Nest Tribe, found a new life under its system.\nFor the newly established Dragon Nest Beastman Tribe, struggle, enterprise, and striving embodied the spirit of the tribe.\nThe once somber Elves, after undergoing military training and transformation by the Dragon Nest Beastmen, began to face the challenges of life with a new attitude.\nUnder these circumstances, relying on the Dragon Nest Tribe, the Elves gained access to a variety of discarded Magic Power materials.\nParts unwanted in Magic Potion materials, slag left from forging Magic Ore, magic-infused soil from veins, and even excrement from various Magic Beasts and Giant Beasts—all considered waste by the Dragon Nest Beastmen—became fertilizer for the Mother Tree’s growth.\nThus, the Mother Tree was freed from the predicament of insufficient resources.\nThese items, difficult for the former Elf Kingdom to obtain as Magic Resources, were easily accessible for the Dragon Nest Beastman Tribe, conveniently providing a place for daily waste disposal with the Elves’ help.\nOwing to this, after the Elf Kingdom’s assimilation, the Elves received a large amount of Magic Power waste from the Dragon Nest Beastmen, allowing the Mother Tree left here to flourish even more vibrantly.\nAn ample supply of Magic Power waste brought many changes to the Elf Mother Tree.\nIf the past was a fading, twilight obsession, the present Mother Tree exuded an aura of vibrant vitality.\nLooking at the more flourishing Mother Tree after becoming part of the Dragon Nest Tribe,\nAnd thinking about the many Elven citizens now, whose faces bore heartfelt smiles, made the Elf Queen Eve feel her own ineptitude even more.\nDuring her reign, she couldn’t provide a prosperous and stable life for her people, nor a healthy living environment for the Mother Tree; instead, they gained all this after the kingdom’s downfall.\nWhat an irony this was?\nShe was unfit to be the king of the Elven race.\n\"Sigh... child, you are not to blame for all this; you need not be so hard on yourself, taking all the responsibility onto your shoulders.\"\nAs the Elf Queen was repenting in her heart, a gentle, soothing voice, reminiscent of a mother’s, resonated from the depths of her heart.\nThe Elf Queen Eve was taken aback, and she looked up in astonishment at the Elf Mother Tree before her.\nFrom her intimate connection with the Elves, intuition told her that the voice from the depths of her heart came from the Mother Tree right in front of her!\nBut before Eve could say anything, the gentle voice echoed again within her:\n\"Child, a distinguished guest has arrived, please return.\"\nWithin the gentle voice, the Elf Queen felt a mild force act upon her, allowing no room for negotiation, and she was promptly ushered out of the grand hall.\nAs Eve felt puzzled,\nsimultaneously,\nWhoosh!\nA massive torrent swept across the high sky, causing the lush branches of the Mother Tree to rustle, rising and falling like green waves.\nFeeling the majestic Dragon Power from the sky, the Elf Queen Eve knew,\nit was the Lord of the Dragon Nest Tribe, His Highness Blue Dragon Austin, who had arrived.\nOutside, Eve, who was sent out, bowed to the Mother Tree and the enormous figure that landed next to it in the sky, then withdrew with complex thoughts.\n\"Greetings, Your Highness Austin, Little Tree thought you would come much sooner after that battle, but perhaps I thought too much.\"\nThe gentle voice resonated within Austin’s mind,\ncommunicating through Spiritual Power, making the voice’s gender indistinct.\n\"That was my oversight; I should have visited sooner, to pay my respects to you, O elder.\"\nDespite being the victor himself, and knowing that the Elf Mother Tree had surrendered to him as a captive, Austin bore no conceit.\nAfter all, the tree before him had grown for at least a millennium.\nCompared to its age, he was just a child, and addressing it as an elder wasn’t unfitting.\n\"Your Highness, such a title as ’elder’ is too grand for Little Tree.\"\nAfter some pleasantries, they discussed the recent situation of the Elf race.\nDuring the conversation, Austin learned that the Elf Mother Tree indeed knew a lot of things.\nOwing to the Mother Tree’s way of production, it could pass on some important information from the previous generation, similar to the Dragon Race.\nGiven this, Austin dove straight to the topic.\n\"I’m curious, what was the relationship between the Elf race and the Pure-blooded Beastmen a thousand years ago? And what exactly was that covenant with the Pure-blooded Beastmen? If you know anything, elder, could you please tell me?\"\n\"This story is long.\"\nThe Elf Mother Tree’s voice was filled with sighs, as if recalling memories from an ancient past.\n\"Does Your Highness know what the original nature of the Pure-blooded Beastmen and the Elves was?\"\nAustin shook his head.\nThese things, he indeed did not know.\nThe Dragon Race’s inherited memories contain many survival techniques and some common knowledge.\nThese things could be learned from the scholars on the Seta Continent with a little inquiry.\nAustin listened intently.\nHe knew that the Elf Mother Tree wouldn’t ask this question without a purpose.\nIndeed, the voice of the Mother Tree soon sounded in Austin’s mind:\n\"Long, long ago, on the Seta Continent, Pure-blooded Beastmen did not exist, nor did the Elf race. Even the Half-Beastmen, who now commonly live in the Kawa Great Forest, did not actually exist.\"\n\"We were, in fact, designed and created.\"\n\"Pure-blooded Beastmen were originally designed and created as war weapons. The Elf race, including myself, were also designed and created as tools for production. And the Half-Beastmen were the failed experiments during the process of designing and creating Pure-blooded Beastmen...\"",

Were they Divine?\"\nFull of doubts, Austin asked aloud.\nIn this world, perhaps only the Divine could create a race, and it must be a Divine with strong divine power to have such ability.\nHowever, as soon as the words left his mouth, Austin realized something was wrong.\nAccording to the Elf Queen’s words, years ago, pure-blooded Beastmen and the Elf Race were blasphemers.\nIf the creators were Divine, how could these two races become blasphemers?\nClearly, their creation was not by the Divine, but very likely by the Divine’s enemies.\nThe second base point, the Fallen Divine Kingdom below the Volcanic Cluster Domain, flashed through his mind.\n\"No, it was not the Divine, but the enemies of the Divine, the Arcane Mages.\"\nSure enough, the Mother Tree gave a negative answer.\n\"Arcane Mages?\"\nUnexpected, yet logical.\nArcane Mages are a group who pursue the path of science, exploring the mysteries and truths of the world, naturally at odds with the Divine.\nMoreover, to them, creating races that should not exist through experiments is not impossible.\nIn the Dragon Race’s inherited memories, these people are described as madmen, though it seems Arcane Mages have not appeared on the Seta Continent for a long time.\nWere they suppressed to extinction?\n\"Indeed, it was the Arcane Mages, long ago, who claimed to share the rights under the starry sky with the Divine.\"\nThe Mother Tree seemed to gaze at the sky, her eyes seeing the distant past, slowly recounting an ancient history that had occurred in this world.\n\"Once, Arcane Mages who pursued truth created an incredibly glorious civilization, their footprints traversing every corner of the Multi-universe, unveiling hidden truths and creating countless brilliance.\"\n\"It was a supremely glorious era, Arcane Mages stood high, shoulder to shoulder with the Divine, a vast Sky City like a continent, floating among the stars, adjacent to the Divine Kingdom, stars shining.\"\n\"Whether it was the Elf Race, pure-blooded Beastmen, or Half-Beastmen, they were merely part of the brilliant works of the Arcane Empire.\"\n\"Initially, the purpose of designing elves was to help Arcane Mages produce and cultivate Magic Potions, while pure-blooded Beastmen were the humble scavengers created to clear resisting pests in the Multi-universe, and Half-Beastmen were just failures in the process of creating pure-bloods.\"\n\"At that time, Arcane Mages ruled the Multi-universe with invincible divine might, and even the Divine dared not face their brilliance.\"\n\"Then, war broke out.\"\n\"A war between Arcane Mages and the Divine spread across the Multi-universe, countless material planes were obliterated, the Divine Kingdom fell from the sky, countless divine beings perished, yet ultimately the war ended with a pyrrhic victory for the Divine, ending the era of Arcane Mages’ glory.\"\n\"The Divine, although victorious, were also badly affected, with most divine beings perishing, and the rest falling into slumber, only remnants of divine power responding to prayers on the continent, causing the Seta Continent to enter an era without gods.\"\n\"Twilight of the Gods, is what later generations called that war.\"\n\"The Arcane Council extinguished, gods fell into slumber, the Seta Continent, deprived of powerful realms, fell into chaotic warfare, where various races battled for supremacy of the continent.\"\n\"Later, amid the warfare, the two branches inheriting the Arcane Mages’ legacy from the previous era, pure-blooded Beastmen, and the Elf Race began to join forces.\"\n\"On the Central Earth Continent, pure-blooded Beastmen, originally designed as war weapons, combined with inheriting most of the Arcane Mages’ legacy, allied with the Elf Race, causing races already gravely affected by continuous wars between the Divine and Arcane Mages to no longer resist, retreating under pure-blooded Beastmen’s attacks, establishing a gigantic Beastman Empire. Meanwhile, in the south of the continent, the Elf Race likewise occupied vast forest lands, dominating the entire southern continent.\"\n\"An alliance was formed at that time, a pact concerning the two created races, in that era, they joined forces.\"\n\"As the deities faded, the Beastman Empire rose in that era, continuing for a millennium, ruling the continent with its glory.\"\n\"Yet mysteriously, several thousand years ago, the vast Beastman Empire suddenly collapsed overnight, simultaneously, the Elf Royal Court was heavily damaged, retreating into the Kawa Great Forest.\"\n\"The surviving pure-blooded Beastmen mixed among the numerous Half-Beastmen, escaped to the Kawa Great Forest, sheltering by surviving in the forest, under the protection of the also mysteriously damaged Elf Kingdom.\"\nA vast history of the world slowly unfolded before Austin’s eyes as the Elf Mother Tree narrated.\nAs if taking him to that epic era, witnessing the rise and fall of civilization’s history.\nThis enormous amount of information, concerning the shifts of the Seta Continent from ancient times to the present, made Austin unable to come to his senses for a long time.\nThis Elf Mother Tree, despite having an age spanning a millennium.\nYet the lineage of the Elf Mother Tree almost merges all experiences and memories into the seeds of the next generation, allowing the new generation not only to contain everything experienced by the previous generation, but even being some wars’ eyewitness from remote ancient times.\nTherefore, the Elf Mother Tree seems to have personally experienced numerous ancient events, including the war causing Twilight of the Gods, vividly visible.\nRegarding the conversation, particularly the epic-like history on the Seta Continent, Austin was filled with awe and amazement.\nNever expected, everything had such a chain reaction.\nThe rise and fall of a Beastman Empire was intimately linked to the previous era of Arcane Mages.\nAnd those Arcane Mages who rivaled the Divine, what majestic demeanor they must have had!\nAfter a long time, Austin managed to calm his turbulent thoughts.\n\"May the senior know if the Arcane Mages of those days left any method or artifact to traverse worlds?\"\nThinking it over, Austin asked the question he most wanted to know.\nAnd he shared some information he heard from Quik.\n\"To traverse worlds? It is said that after achieving epic status, one can transcend time and space, sense the boundary of the main matter realm, and start exploring the Multi-universe. But I do remember one thing that can allow ordinary people to traverse the boundaries between worlds.\"\n\"It is the Arcane Council’s supreme creation: the Gate of Truth!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 327: Chapter 323: Gate of Truth\n\"The Gate of Truth, the highest achievement constructed by the powerhouses of the Arcane Council to exhaust all truths in the world. I have heard that the gate contains all the truths of the universe, surpassing all divine artifacts as a Chaos Artifact.\"\n\"Back in those days, the Arcane Mages spread fear across the multiverse, collecting resources from countless planes and dispatching pure-blooded Beastmen to cross the world’s boundaries to clear those planes of rebellious natives, relying on the Gate of Truth.\"\n\"That gate was the core object used by the Arcane Mages to dominate the multiverse.\"\n\"However, during the Twilight of the Gods, the Gate of Truth was shattered in the final battle, and the pure-blooded Beastmen acquired some of its fragments. It’s estimated that after all these years, they have researched something out of it and are using it to traverse planes.\"\nThe Fairy Mother Tree is not very clear about the actual situation.\nEven with inherited memories, it is not omniscient. In the previous era of the Arcane Mages, its inherited memories were just another among numerous minor entities in the background.\nOnly the publicly known and widely proclaimed matters could the Mother Tree know a little about from its memories.\nThe truly important secrets were always beyond its grasp.\n\"So you’re saying, the Beastman Royal Court at the forest core gained the ability to traverse planes using fragments of the Gate of Truth from back then?\"\nThe highest creation of the Arcane Mage Era... If I can learn these secrets from the Fairy Mother Tree, then what about other forces? Do those legendary or even epic existences also know the same secrets?\nA cloud of doubt loomed over the heart.\nIf in this grand battle, those legendary beings behind it all know of the Gate of Truth, Austin doesn’t believe he can stand out to reap the greatest reward.\nTo contend with legendary epics, with his current half-legendary strength, he is still far from enough.\n\"Your Highness need not worry too much, even if they can traverse planes, the Beastman Royal Court only holds part of the fragments. Even if they can barely use them, a large cost is likely required. Otherwise, in this dangerous situation, why do the pure-bloods not directly use the remaining power of the Gate of Truth to cross into another world to hide and live? It must be the limitation of the cost.\"\nSeeing Austin frown, the Fairy Mother Tree could not help but explain.\n\"Moreover, besides the supreme creation of the Arcane Mages, the Gate of Truth, there’s also the Plane Teleportation Array. This array is an improved version of the Otherworld Birth Array, mastered by demons, and, by spending a great cost, also holds certain world-crossing capabilities. It may not necessarily be the power of the Gate of Truth.\"\nThis explains why the competition might not be too fierce.\nAfter all, if it were the complete Gate of Truth from back then, it would be a Chaos Artifact above all divine artifacts, naturally attracting covetous eyes from countless beings.\nBut now, what the Beastman Royal Court holds is only a fraction, greatly diminished in capability. Moreover, there is an alternative in the Plane Teleportation Array, making legendary beings capable of devising their own methods.\nThe pressure suddenly eased a lot.\nHowever, the actions of the Beastman Royal Court still drew countless attention.\nAfter all, no matter how incomplete, it remained a supreme creation of the Arcane Mage Council from back then.\nThinking this over, Austin’s thoughts became more active.\nPerhaps in the coming years, he could elevate his cultivation level to legendary, and then partake in the war to divide the Beastman Royal Court.\nSuddenly, Austin had a thought, pondering a question.\n\"A few years ago, the Beastman Royal Court sent an army to search for the elf race, at a time when the pure-blooded were at a crisis. Could it be that the presence of the elf race could help them resolve their crisis? Do you know why they sent for the search?\"\n\"Perhaps, it was for little me.\"\nThe Fairy Mother Tree thought for a while, saying uncertainly.\n\"After the kingdom was destroyed and fled from the core area, all the wealth was left there, leaving us remnants hiding nearby. It seems I am the only one who could attract the pure-bloods’ attention.\"\n\"Oh, why is that?\"\n\"It should still relate to the Gate of Truth. Though I’m unclear about the detailed whereabouts of the fragments after its shattering, the starlight scattering across the starry sky is somewhat recorded in the inherited memories. Coupled with the innate talents of the Mother Tree, we might find some fragments of the Gate of Truth scattered back then, to repair the fragments held by the pure-bloods.\"\nWith earlier conjectures in mind, the line of thinking became smoother.\n\"Perhaps, those pure-bloods really entertained the idea of fleeing to the Otherworld, but due to the limitations of the shattered Gate of Truth they possess, they sought out me hoping to find enough fragments to repair it and escape this world.\"\nThe Fairy Mother Tree gazed at Austin, carefully speaking:\n\"Actually, Your Highness, I originally let Eve take root and stay nearby because the inherited memory hinted that a relatively large fragment of the shattered Gate of Truth had fallen here. It was hoped to draw upon the power of the forest land to find it, to help the Elf Kingdom rise again. But unfortunately...\"\nThe Fairy Mother Tree did not continue, clearly having failed in its plan.\nPerhaps due to the passage of time, positions also shifted, or some other reasons. In the end, it couldn’t find that fragment of the Gate of Truth.\nThen, one dragon and one tree continued to converse for a while.\nBut the following dialogue no longer held much value.\nAfterward, Austin took his leave.\nThis trip proved to be very fruitful.\nThe Arcane Era, Twilight of the Gods, Beastman Empire, Elf, Pure-blooded Beastmen, Half-Beastman, and the Gate of Truth.\nAll these outlined the vast historical landscape of the Prime Material Plane.\nThe conversation revealed so much information, to unravel the current situation in Kawa Great Forest from such complex relationships, Austin needed to return to the tribe for a thorough analysis.\nAnd then.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe entered a phase of low-profile development, quietly cultivating agriculture while establishing a third base. The Dragon Nest Beastmen army swept through nearby wild Beastman Tribes, incorporating many Beastman captives into its system, enhancing its strength.\nThe tribe developed day by day, and its strength was growing.\nAs for Austin, ever since conversing with the Fairy Mother Tree, he has primarily kept a low profile.\nConstantly watching the war situation within Kawa Great Forest while striving to enhance his own power to the fullest extent.\nTime passed quietly over the next half a year.",

      "content": "Chapter 328: Chapter 324: Half-Year Recuperation\nDuring the past half year, the Kawa Great Forest has been in chaos, with many scattered factions forcibly integrated and starting to gather at the Allies Headquarters.\nThroughout this process, conflicts and skirmishes among the various beastman factions happened frequently, plunging the entire Kawa Great Forest into chaos.\nThe blade’s fierce fire spread to every corner of the Forest Land.\nHowever, the outside turmoil did not affect the Dragon Nest Tribe at all.\nPerhaps due to the presence of the Celestial Dragon Island backing, or perhaps due to the deterrence of Austin slaying the half-legendary dark-striped tiger man Vira, during this half year of development, the Dragon Nest Tribe did not encounter any trouble from the outside.\nThe tribe developed peacefully, and Austin also worked hard to enhance his strength during this time.\nThe previously consumed Power Law Origin, after refining for half a year, finally successfully integrated into his body.\nUnlike other Elemental Laws, the pure attribute of the Power Law is much harder to refine, costing Austin considerable effort, more difficult than refining other Law Origins before.\nOf course, the rewards after refining were greater as well.\nUnder the augmentation of the Power Law, the body that had been refined by volcanic lava was further strengthened, with not only enhanced scale defense but also the force within becoming sufficient to crumble the soil and land.\nWith pure physical power, Austin’s giant dragon race talent, along with the enhancement of the Power Law within, has reached the peak of the Half-Legendary.\nEven against a true Legendary, Austin dares to wrestle in terms of raw physical power.\nAlthough, it is only in terms of physical attributes.\nIn this half year, besides refining the Power Law, the power of the nurtured Four Spirits Sword Array has been further enhanced.\nThe power of the four Law Divine Swords nurtured with magic momentum within the body for half a year is unknown to Austin.\nBut at least, if Austin were to face the dark-striped tiger man Vira again now, the Four Spirits Sword Array formed by the four Law Divine Swords would not be easily shattered.\nHowever, Austin also realized that solely relying on the Four Spirits Sword Array made his strength somewhat singular.\nThe Four Spirits Sword Array is for defense and trapping and lacks a powerful offensive technique.\nThus, while nurturing the four Law Divine Swords, Austin did not forget to explore the direction of merging the four swords.\nWith the Rasengan of the four-element attribute fusion, Austin gained direction in exploring the merger of the four swords.\nHaving similar prior experience, it was naturally much easier.\nAustin has already made significant progress in the fusion of the four Law Divine Swords.\nOverall, after conversing with the Elf Mother Tree for half a year, Austin’s strength increased by at least twofold.\nUnfortunately, despite the substantial increase in real power, his level cultivation showed no progress.\nIt’s unclear whether the consumed magic resources were too low in level or if he encountered some issue himself, but Austin’s level remained at the Half-Legendary Realm, with no breakthrough over the half year.\nOne could say it’s a give and take.\nIn this half year, besides Austin’s increase in strength, the scale and power of the Dragon Nest Tribe also developed to a certain extent.\nWith the popularization of the Beastman Six Techniques and the completion of training for the first batch of modified beastmen, the Dragon Nest Tribe lacked nothing in terms of mid to high-end combat power.\nUnder sufficient mid to high-end combat power command, the surrounding beastman tribes were no match and were easily conquered and annexed.\nThe dangerous areas within the territorial range were also eliminated one by one, with vast amounts of Magic Ore and Magic Plants developed.\nCurrently, the Dragon Nest Tribe’s dominance over surrounding territories reached a new height.\nAt the same time, in terms of ordinary beastmen, the third outpost was completed, greatly increasing the area of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s actual control while the total population of the tribe exceeded the 130,000 boundary.\nThis time, the development of the third outpost did not require Austin to intervene again.\nRelying on the powerful Dragon Nest Legion and extraordinary squads, the Dragon Nest Tribe easily cleared the Lord of Magical Beasts settled near the outpost and seized that area.\nThen, a major sweep began.\nNear the third outpost, beastman tribes were conquered one after another, with thousands to tens of thousands of beastmen captured.\nThe vast population resources provided ample workforce for developing the third outpost.\nIn a short time, the third outpost was firmly established nearby.\nLarge-scale land reclamation and farming, along with vigorous development of animal husbandry and fishery, ensured the Dragon Nest Tribe had no lack of food, drawing more impoverished beastman tribes to join voluntarily, absorbing more beastman population.\nThe tribe’s development was flourishing and magnificent.\nLooking at the intertwined systems, there already seemed to be the shadow of a kingdom emerging.\nWith time, much no longer required Austin’s personal involvement; the seeds casually sown years ago had grown sufficiently self-sustaining.\nSeeing his strength increase to a certain extent, and the Dragon Nest Tribe stable with no major issues,\nAustin shifted his gaze elsewhere.\nThe lakes and reservoirs near the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nOne day, after talking with the Elf Mother Tree, Austin had a rough understanding of the current state within the Kawa Great Forest.\nIn any case, if a great war were to erupt, it would not end in a few years with the pure-blooded beastmen’s strength.\nTherefore, Austin planned to raise his strength to a certain level before engaging, ideally reaching the Legendary Realm.\nCurrently, Austin has reached the Half-Legendary Realm. After digesting the Power Law Origin, he found it difficult to make progress and would not consider getting involved in that turmoil for now.\nHowever, during that conversation, aside from the history of the Arcane Mages and pure-blooded beastmen, there was another thing that caught his attention.\nThat was the Elf Mother Tree mentioned that it settled the Elf Kingdom nearby to find fragments of the Gate of Truth that had drifted here in the past.\nThe Elf Mother Tree couldn’t find them.\nBut Austin had some ideas.\nThat was the lakes and reservoirs near the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nYears ago, Austin acquired a beast skin note left by a gold-level great mage.\nIt recorded some matters concerning the lakes and reservoirs near the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nOne of them was the revelation that the lakes and reservoirs in the Lush Forest were not naturally formed but resembled craters caused by a falling star.\nThat gold-level great mage also used some methods to obtain a skeleton from the crater’s depths, gaining some demonic artifacts of the Divine Artifact type.\nAt that time, Austin had the idea of exploring the lakes and reservoirs.\nHowever, due to the terrifying nature of the mysterious ghost grass at the lake’s bottom, his several exploration attempts ended fruitlessly.",

      "content": "Chapter 329: Chapter 325: The Gate at the Bottom of the Lake\nAfter a certain slumber at Gold Level, Austin originally thought that his body could resist the eerie flames caused by those \"dandelions.\"\nHowever, after several experiments, the facts proved that he was overconfident.\nA few strange flames in the water could be barely endured, but when the quantity increased to thousands, breaking through the ghost grass blockade without the protection of the Legendary Domain was impossible.\nIt was precisely for this reason that Austin’s previous attempts always ended in near failure.\nBut now, he has regained the confidence to venture again.\nAfter arranging some basic strategies for the Dragon Nest Tribe, Austin began to infiltrate the lakes and reservoirs near the Dragon’s Nest.\nStarlit glimmers shone at the center of the lake, with clusters of ghost grass swaying with the currents, like flowing galaxies in the dark lake bottom.\nEverything was exactly the same as several years ago.\nNo, something was different; the fish that lived nearby, and relied on the consumption of those rising \"dandelions,\" had scales that began to emit a faint glow.\n\"Is this... mutation?\"\nOr perhaps, radiation change?\nWith doubts, Austin continued to dive.\nAs the massive shadow descended, the surrounding fish scattered quickly.\nAs they darted around, Austin seemed to sense an almost imperceptible ripple in space.\nWas it an illusion?\nWithout lingering, he continued to dive deeper.\nSoon, as he reached a certain boundary, countless ghostly blue \"dandelions\" below ignited like exploding stardust, transforming into a tsunami of torrents rising toward Austin.\n\"These damned plants again.\"\nWatching the dense ghostly blue starlight rise from below, reminiscent of previous embarrassments, Austin’s expression turned grim.\nThe current momentum was far more terrifying than before.\nHowever, he was no longer his former self.\nCrash!\nThe sound of waves surging suddenly came from below the water, and numerous Divine Swords faded out from the void, their energies interconnecting to form a spatial field.\nAustin did not unleash the Law Divine Sword’s accumulated aura, which he’d nurtured for more than half a year. The power of the Four Spirits Sword Array was far from its peak, achieving only about thirty to forty percent of its combat strength.\nBut at this level, it was enough.\nRoar roar roar...\nDense starlight impacted the space of the Four Spirits Sword Array, erupting in countless ghostly blue flames outside, like a wildfire aiming to consume everything.\nYet beneath these flames, the surrounding waters showed no sign of boiling, indeed peculiar.\nThese blue flames were not mere fire.\nSeeing the Four Spirits Sword Array begin to shake under the impact of the blue flames, Austin didn’t linger, directing the sword array deeper inside.\nAt the lake bottom,\nThe ghost grass grew like strands of hair, extending tens of meters long, rooted below like fur.\nAustin rushed into the lake bottom, as if entering a world of blue fibers.\nEach strand of ghost grass seemed stimulated, twisting towards the space of the Four Spirits Sword Array as if trying to bind and strangle the intruder.\nWithout delay, he continued to plunge at high speed, escaping the pursuit of the ghost grass above.\nIn just a breath, he reached the bottom.\nHere, he was at least five hundred meters deep, facing unimaginable pressure.\nYet what lay before him shocked Austin greatly.\nThe ghost grass above was not growing in the lakebed soil but sprouted from the void, rooted in the void eating space’s power as nourishment!\nAs Austin descended, the space at the bottom rippled visibly, spreading waves outward.\nBefore Austin could react, as if drawn by the spreading swamp, it swallowed him and the Four Spirits Sword Array instantly.\nThe ghost grass surrounding hesitated momentarily after losing its target before dispersing.\nQuite soon, tranquility was restored, as if nothing had happened.\n...\nLike being sucked into a vortex, the dense spatial power around constantly squeezed Austin’s body.\nThe violent tumbling almost made him dizzy.\nInstinctively, Austin was about to unleash the Four Spirits Sword Array to break free.\nYet in the next moment, everything spun around, and he found himself in a wondrous space.\nThe entire space seemed like an enormous vortex tunnel, with vacuum distorted by a peculiar power, forming a massive dome overhead.\n\"Where is this...\"\nAustin’s gaze suddenly focused.\nBecause at the far end of the space, a door appeared.\nThe door was only a phantom, yet it stood before him, gathering the essence of myriad paths, with light shining from the end of the world, accommodating all beauty and grandeur, like the world’s limit, the end of all things.\nStaring at the gate in the distance, Austin’s eyes glimmered.\nThe door was incomplete, only a substantial base remaining, with cracks like dog teeth, webs stretching upon it, unimaginable conflict must have been severe to cause such destruction.\nYet even with just a base, it still conveyed the sense of being a door.\nUpon seeing it, one could immediately sense that it was a door.\nAs if etched into time, it wasn’t in the past, present, or future.\nAfter pondering briefly, Austin slowly walked toward the base.\nUntil he stood before it, still nothing changed, only brilliant light converging in the void, flashing indescribable profound glow.\n\"Is this the Gate of Truth?\"\nEven if incomplete, one could still feel its dreadful divine might.\nIt’s hard to imagine its full state back then and the miraculous power it held.\n\"Let’s leave this here and ask the Elf Mother Tree later about using it.\"\nDeciding so, Austin thought it best to let the Gate of Truth’s base remain here.\nWho knows if this thing poses a danger? Better secure the usage method and investigate further.\nAfter all, it’s been submerged for years unnoticed; safest to leave it as is.\nWho knows if bringing it back to the Dragon’s Nest might evoke spatial fluctuations sensed by enemies, attracting great foes?\nAustin is a cautious dragon.\nBut just as Austin was about to turn and leave.\nSuddenly, the gate seemed pulled by some force and swooped toward Austin.\n\"What!\"\nStartled, Austin’s pupils contracted.\nHowever, as the Gate of Truth moved, the surrounding space and time seemed frozen, compressing him into immobility.\nAs if traversing through multiple spaces, the door then penetrated Austin’s body, settling into the deepest realm of the spirit sea.\nThere resides a soul wholly distinct from this world.\nBoom!!!\nWith a flicker in the Gate of Truth’s base core material, the gate crashed there directly.\n\"Damn!\"\nWith this final thought conveyed, Austin’s consciousness fell into an endless abyss of darkness.",

      "content": "Chapter 330: Chapter 001: Otherworld\nCentral Plains, Celestial Essence Sect.\nThe cold wind was like a knife, howling through the courtyard, and the biting chill made the young servants standing there shiver incessantly.\n\"Our Celestial Essence Sect has been established for four hundred and thirty-two years. We never keep useless people within the sect. The sect has supported you for ten years, which is already more than generous. As servants, you must have the consciousness of a servant, and do good work for the disciples and elders of the sect. One day you might catch the elders’ attention and be accepted into the sect.\"\nIn front of the courtyard, a middle-aged man with dark skin was baring his teeth as he loudly lectured.\nThis person had an average build and a smooth demeanor, clearly playing the role of a steward or manager within the sect.\nAs he finished speaking, the young servants in the field stirred restlessly.\nThe Celestial Essence Sect was one of the top prestigious sects in the Central Plains. If one day they could truly attract the attention of the elders and be accepted, it would indeed be a meteoric rise.\nFrom then on, they could roam the martial world freely, carefree across the world, wielding a sword as they journeyed afar, which is the dream of so many youths.\nWith an expressionless face, the dark-skinned middle-aged man glanced at the group of servants below, all bearing hopeful expressions, with a flash of disdain in his eyes.\nThese words can only deceive these inexperienced fellows in front of him; it’s merely some empty talk meant to incite them to work harder. Actually believing it is truly laughable.\nDon’t they look at their own origins? Do they really think they can climb high from their position and be accepted into the Celestial Essence Sect?\nThe servants in front of him were primarily descendants of various servants within the sect who swept and tidied up.\nTheir status was, in fact, not much different from the offspring of some influential families.\nEven somewhat lower.\nAfter all, the offspring of influential families could ultimately rely on loyalty to be promoted to the management level and leap into a position envied by others.\nBut a sect is different. A sect recruits disciples from the outside world, and the loyalty of the disciples is fundamental to the cohesion of a sect.\nAs for these generations of servants serving the sect?\nWhy would they need you to be loyal when your task is cleaning and mucking out?\nAt this lowly status, the elders within the sect, for the sake of face, wouldn’t truly accept a servant as a disciple.\nThat’s lower than those peasants.\n\"Now, let’s begin assigning duties. Those named should report to their respective senior brothers...\"\nWithout saying any unnecessary words, the dark-skinned middle-aged man took out a book from his pocket and started reading the names within.\nOne by one, the names of the young servants were called, and they were subsequently led away.\nAt this moment,\nin the crowd, a servant-clad Li Hu, with an unremarkable appearance, looked around at the group of ancient people and the nearby ancient architecture, his gaze bewildered.\nJust a moment ago, he was exploring the bottom of the lake, observing the fragments of the Gate of Truth. Unexpectedly, he was struck by the Gate of Truth the next moment, causing him to spin around and land in this ancient world.\nWhat is going on? Did he transmigrate again?\nIn his previous life, he had clearly read many similar novels, so this completely unfamiliar environment didn’t leave him too bewildered for long.\nHe then began to ponder his current situation.\n\"Li Hu, huh? What kind of lousy name is this? Forget it, let’s settle down first and then talk.\"\nFrom today onwards, he could only initially accept the name Li Hu.\nWith a brief adaptation, Austin accepted the reality of becoming Li Hu.\nBut before he could fully grasp his current situation, a voice rang out:\n\"Li Hu, report to Senior Brother Zhao at the Miscellaneous Task Hall in the Library.\"\nThe dark-skinned man’s instruction decided Li Hu’s fate for the time being.\nLi Hu did not resist and followed the arrangements, going with the flow, waiting to understand the situation of this world first.\nThere was neither any oppression nor defiance; everything was calm. Li Hu found Senior Brother Zhao and from that day on became a servant cleaning the Library.\nFrom then on, Li Hu began his life of cleaning the vast Library.\nThe Library, akin to the sect’s library and Scripture Hall.\nIt held a large amount of martial arts history, sect miscellany, various experiences from disciples’ journeys, and many sects’ basic martial arts.\nOf course, these were just basic martial arts. The basic martial arts of every sect in the Central Plains were approximately similar. The true profound inheritance was held by the various Grand Elders of the Celestial Essence Sect, so although the Library held hundreds of thousands of books, its status was not particularly high.\nAfter all, if accepted by an elder, naturally a teacher would personally guide them. The basic martial arts across various sects were much alike, so there was no need for confidentiality.\nThis is precisely why a servant descendant like Li Hu could enter and clean the Library.\nSince the books in the Library range from important to unimportant.\nIt’s all trivial.\nCleaning the Library was an extremely laborious and unrewarding task. With hundreds of thousands of recorded books, classic historical collections, basic martial arts, various booklets, and magazines, managing them alone consumed much effort daily, let alone dusting and mopping, which left one exhausted.\nMoreover, the disciples visiting the Library were primarily outer sect disciples without any backing, making it a poor place for networking, essentially a troublesome and unrewarding position.\nWithin half a month, the servants cleaning the Library alongside Li Hu began maneuvering to leave, leaving only Li Hu, a chatty skinny monkey, and a foolish-minded servant named Dasha still within the Library.\nLi Hu actually wanted to leave too, but unfortunately, it was practically impossible.\nBecause Li Hu’s father was a minor character.\nWhat is a minor character?\nHis real name was unknown, others called him Li Si; his height and appearance were probably poor, fortunate to have married a kitchen maid. It’s said that he was skilled in archery and sincere, but even at over thirty, he could only serve tea to senior brothers. He died at thirty-six, due to breaking an elder’s snuff bottle by mistake, punished to kneel for two days and nights. After death, the sect gave him a thin coffin and tossed it into the disorderly graveyard, never stepping out of the sect gates more than twenty miles in his life. The martial world? His martial world was sweeping, chopping wood, and serving spit for heroes.\nLi Hu was the son of such a minor character.\nWhen he was born, his mother died in childbirth, and upon hearing the news, his father mistakenly broke the elder’s beloved item; hence he became an orphan, randomly fostered within the sect, until now at thirteen or fourteen capable of working, continuing to contribute to the sect.\nEven if he wanted to leave, lacking money and connections, Senior Brother Zhao would certainly not release him.\nHe could only continue as a servant cleaning and sorting in the Library.\nFortunately, with his soul switched, Li Hu’s nature was resilient, considering the arduous task of maintaining the Library as self-training. Back when he was born in the Main World, he lurked in water for two days and nights to hunt a deer, even eating soil when starving.\nAbove all, the vast books, travel notes, and various basic martial arts within the Library are indeed the best place to understand this world, aren’t they?\nFor Li Hu newly arrived in the Otherworld, the Library was the best starting place possible.",

      "content": "Chapter 331: Chapter 002 Library\nAfter entering the Library as a servant, besides sweeping and cleaning, Li Hu read extensively about the history and origins of Martial Arts in this world, along with various books on the Eight Extraordinary Meridians and Basic Martial Arts, leaving almost no book unread.\nRegarding the Extraordinary Power of this world, Li Hu had already gained some understanding.\nAccording to legend, in ancient times, humans mimicked tigers and leopards, learned from nature, and cultivated the first trace of True Qi, thus beginning the path of Martial Arts.\nLater, through changes in dynasties and the development of ages, it gradually formed today’s Martial World where the righteous sects of the Central Plains are thriving, while the Demon Sect lurks in the damp, poisonous insect-infested lands of the south.\nFor many years, the Demon Sect had constant friction with the righteous path of the Central Plains, ambitiously trying to invade the Central Plains.\nSimply put, there was confrontation between the righteous and the demonic in the Martial World, with a tense situation.\nHowever, matters of the Demon Sect had nothing to do with Li Hu, who was sweeping in the Library.\nProficient in the essence of survival, Li Hu, after roughly understanding the Martial Arts of this world, began practicing Martial Arts.\nIn the Library, hundreds, even thousands of Basic Martial Arts Secret Manuals were collected. Although there were no advanced secret manuals, Li Hu was apparently more interested in these basic martial arts.\nThe Nourishing Essence Technique, an ordinary technique for refining Inner Power True Qi, a common commodity in the Martial World.\nThe Body Strengthening Skill, adapted from Five Animals Qigong, a basic external technique with the effect of strengthening the body.\nThese two were the martial arts Li Hu prepared to cultivate.\nThey were also the martial arts Li Hu carefully selected after reading hundreds or thousands of basic martial arts in the Library.\n\"To rely on this world’s original Martial Arts System, there’s simply no way to go back! I have to carve my path.\"\nWhen Li Hu began communicating with the Gate of Truth in his spiritual mind, he had no choice but to decide to carve his own path based on this world’s Martial Arts System.\nLi Hu, or rather Austin,\nafter more than half a month of sorting things out, had roughly clarified his situation.\nThe Gate of Truth, after crashing into his mind that day, caused some unknown transformation, directly bringing his soul to this world, thus falling into a state of weakness.\nWith the Gate of Truth in this state, Austin could weakly sense the connection between the Main World, but relying on its residual power to return was out of the question.\nIt’s as if there’s an unbreakable barrier, preventing the Gate of Truth from bringing his soul back.\nThat barrier should be the constraint of heaven and earth space.\nTherefore, to return, he must shatter the vacuum constraint between heaven and earth.\nMoreover, perhaps due to the Laws of Heaven and Earth, Austin did not feel the presence of any Magic Power Energy between heaven and earth.\nIn other words, this world did not have the foundation of Magic Energy’s Extraordinary Power.\nTo break through the spatial constraints, the only way is to rely on this world’s native Martial Arts System to achieve the level of Void Shattering.\nAt that time, after breaking through the void, perhaps he could rely on the power of the Gate of Truth to return to his main world’s body.\n\"An unexpected disaster.\"\nRegarding the unexpected situation with the Gate of Truth, Austin was also helpless.\nFortunately, in his previous life, he was also an Oriental, had some understanding of Wuxia culture, and did not feel much discomfort.\nAlthough, after living in the Western Fantasy World for so many years, he now occasionally felt a little strange.\n\"Even the highest Divine Skill Secret Manual of Celestial Essence Sect, the Celestial Heart Treasure Manual, only historically leads to the Grandmaster Realm at most, and doesn’t reach the final destination. This world’s Martial Arts is too narrow, unable to reach the other shore. One must absorb the essence of Martial Arts from the entire world, and demonstrate it personally, only then might there be a chance to reach the world’s limit.\"\nIn this world, Martial Arts starts with Postnatal Qi Cultivation, then Innate, Grandmaster, and finally the cultivation above all, the Grandmaster above all others.\nGenerations of martial artists developed and advanced, yet throughout history, there has never been one who broke through beyond the void shattering level.\nSince this world has no path, Austin could only carve his own path.\nWith his eyesight and realm, having been exposed to Law Origin, he had already surpassed the several levels of the strongest martial artists in this world.\nDespite the different systems, in terms of profound Dao Origin, Austin’s vision was still far ahead of this era.\nAs the saying goes, a blank paper is easy to draw on,\nby relying on the common martial arts of Nourishing Essence Technique and Body Strengthening Skill, and entering the Extraordinary Domain, absorbing the concepts and essence of other martial arts, he might carve an even bigger and farther path.\nIn truth, the simpler and more ordinary the martial arts, the more capable it is of encompassing all.\n....\nThus, during the day, Li Hu swept and organized the Library, and at night, he took advantage of a little spare time to roam in the ocean of various books, while also starting to cultivate two martial arts.\nPerhaps due to the experience of crossing over, Li Hu’s Spiritual Power was at least eight or nine times stronger than ordinary people, and he could even use it to have the effect of introspection.\nThe strong Spiritual Ability allowed Li Hu to precisely control every meridian and muscle, conducting even more precise cultivation.\nIt was precisely due to this that Li Hu’s cultivation speed of the two martial arts was almost a thousand miles a day.\nAnd after cultivation, Li Hu’s physical quality became stronger, and his speed in the daily cleaning and management work of the Library was greatly enhanced, allowing him to devote more time to reading and cultivation.\nTime,\npassed day by day in the routine of daytime sweeping, and nighttime reading and practice.\nUnknowingly, a year had passed since Austin crossed over to become Li Hu.\nIn this year, it was said that among the batch of servants who started with Li Hu, someone named Zhang Feng, recognized for his extraordinary talent by an Elder, was accepted as a disciple, thus rising to become a disciple of the Celestial Essence Sect.\nThis event caused quite a stir within the entire Celestial Essence Sect, and among thousands of servants, it sparked a lot of enthusiasm.\nIn the following half year, countless servants worked hard to showcase their greatest enthusiasm, hoping to become the next fortunate one.\nHowever, all the hustle and bustle outside had little to do with Li Hu.\nIn this year, he mostly lived a life that revolved around the canteen, the Library, and the dormitory.\nHe did not make friends, nor would anyone try to befriend someone relegated as a drudge in a Library.\nThe allocated Senior Brother Zhao in the Library had no incidents either, and his presence was rarely felt.\nAmong the Library servants, the talkative Skinny Monkey also got transferred away due to a connection with a Senior Brother, so only Li Hu and the slightly deranged Dunce were left among the library’s servants.\nIsolated from the outside world, as if being isolated outside the Celestial Essence Sect.\nYet, Li Hu didn’t mind, for the Library was a rare quiet place amidst the tumultuous outside world.\nIn the spring warmth and autumn chill, summer heat and winter cold.\nIn such a quiet year, Li Hu’s cultivation realm quietly broke through to the Innate.",

Such an achievement, if known to the outside world, would certainly cause a huge stir in the martial arts community.\nNot to mention anything else, just Li Hu entering the Innate Realm at the young age of thirteen or fourteen would be enough to astonish a vast number of people in the martial world.\nYou should know that the youngest among the current martial artists to reach the Innate Realm is Celestial Sword Manor’s successor, Dao Yuange, who is twenty years old.\nThis age for the Innate Realm has already broken the record for the youngest ever innate powerhouse in martial arts history.\nHowever, Li Hu entered the Innate Realm completely quietly.\nAfter entering the Innate Realm, life remained much as usual.\nHe ate when he needed to, slept when he needed to, worked as he needed to, showing nothing out of the ordinary.\nAmong the thousands of people in the Celestial Essence Sect, no one was aware that their sect now had an additional Innate master.\nWithin the library, there were many disciples coming and going, but Li Hu, who often appeared in a corner of the library sweeping and organizing books, was like an invisible person, not attracting anyone’s attention.\n\"Have you heard? That servant-born Zhang Feng won first place in the outer sect competition and, after a year of cultivation, has already broken through to the Postnatal Fourth Layer!\"\n\"I heard, Fang Pingqing has lost a lot of face this time.\"\n\"Hmph, that damn servant brat, really don’t know why the Elder accepted him into the sect, making it so there are always some lowly servants with delusions of grandeur...\"\nOne day, while returning to the library after eating, several voices talking idly came from afar.\nSome Celestial Essence Sect disciples were gossiping during their cultivation break.\nThe subject was the ambitious Zhang Feng, a servant-born disciple in the same group as Li Hu, who was later noticed by an Elder and exceptionably accepted into the Celestial Essence Sect.\nThen a series of events unfolded, starting with Zhang Feng’s background clashing with some henchman, after winning, he was challenged by a more powerful underling’s relative, and following that, he provoked Fang Pingqing, the top of the outer sect...\nZhang Feng’s name and cultivation soared with each successive conflict.\nIt is said that Fang Pingqing has connections in the inner sect too; it seems likely that once Zhang Feng enters the inner sect, others will come looking for trouble with him.\nLi Hu had no interest in paying attention to anyone; his mind was set, determined to shatter the void and return to the Main World, but the past year’s dramatic antics involving that guy were so noteworthy and frequently discussed by others that even Li Hu, who was focusing on quiet cultivation, had become familiar with that individual’s rise to prominence.\nCalmly, Li Hu left without drawing the attention of those gossiping disciples.\nFor Li Hu, this was nothing he cared much about.\nEven though Zhang Feng’s path seemed reminiscent of protagonists from novels Li Hu had read in his past life, Li Hu had little intention of ingratiating himself or participating in such ’plots’.\nWhat situation awaited in the Main World was a complete unknown to him; he also didn’t understand why he came to this world or what his status here was.\nUnder such circumstances, Li Hu couldn’t afford to spend time on participating in various ’stories’.\nHe needed to forge a path quickly, shatter the void, and rely on the Gate of Truth within his soul to return to the Main World.\nBack in the Book Pavilion, sweeping, dusting, organizing books, taking on one task at a time, moving slowly, occasionally the outer sect disciples coming to borrow books would pass by him as if he didn’t exist.\nYet if one were to observe carefully,\nthey would find that in Li Hu’s every movement, even his breathing seemed to resonate with a certain rhythm.\nWalking, breathing, sweeping—they were all aligned with a sort of pattern.\nThis was a technique Li Hu developed by combining the Nourishing Essence Technique with the Body Strengthening Skill, as well as referencing numerous Basic Martial Arts Secret Manuals, allowing him to cultivate at any time and place.\nHe practiced while walking, practiced while going about his day, even while lying down and sleeping.\nAll the time engaged in cultivation, integrating techniques into everyday life.\nLi Hu was able to step into the Innate Realm within a year, largely thanks to this martial art.\nMeanwhile, during the process of sweeping and wiping, Li Hu was using his Spiritual Power in three ways, mentally browsing the books on the shelves.\nAfter stepping into the Innate Realm, his Spiritual Power had further expanded, now able to cover the entire library, penetrating the books, and extracting information from them.\nDespite the vastness of the library, containing tens of thousands of books, and Li Hu’s powerful Spiritual Power granting him almost photographic memory, understanding and fully comprehending a Basic Martial Arts Technique took no less than a day’s work for each book.\nEven as his Spiritual Power quickly grew, and his reading capacity simultaneously increased, over the past year, Li Hu had only thoroughly read around two to three thousand books.\nMoreover, these included various travel journals, disciple adventure tales, memoirs of sect elders, and other assorted topics.\nCompared to the entirety of the library, this was merely one percent.\nTrying to integrate the entire world’s path, to reach the shattering void, without reading and understanding the basics of the whole world, is completely impossible.\nTime passed slowly as Li Hu continued to read and cultivate.\nAnother year went by,\nWithin this year, the once widely known Zhang Feng broke through to the Postnatal Seventh Layer and further boosted his reputation in the Celestial Essence Sect’s large competition and sparring duels with other sects, entering the inner sect.\nZhang Feng’s name had nearly become synonymous with fame in the Celestial Essence Sect.\nIn the entire Celestial Essence Sect, no disciple didn’t know Zhang Feng, who learned martial arts two years ago, maintained a pace of breaking three realms annually, shocking people—a rising star.\nHowever, he also attracted much more powerful enemies because of this, even offending several elders.\nThe whole Celestial Essence Sect was bustling because of him.\nBut none of this had anything to do with Li Hu.\nIn the second year in this world, Li Hu maintained his previous year’s lifestyle, staying mostly secluded.\nSweeping, cultivating, reading.\nNo face-slapping incidents, living peacefully and quietly day by day.\nWhile cultivating, he continued to comprehend the true meaning of martial arts.\nOver the course of the year, Li Hu’s cultivation reached the pinnacle of the Innate Realm, just one step away from Grandmaster.\nIn the Celestial Essence Sect, apart from the Grandmaster-level Grand Elder who stood as the sect’s pillar, no one else had strength surpassing Li Hu.\nWith Li Hu’s strength, he was comparable to the Sect Leader of Celestial Essence, ranking among the top and leading experts in this martial world, possessing a prowess akin to a martial elder, yet the entire sect remained unaware.\nLi Hu also did not boast.\nThe outer sect disciples who frequently borrowed books from the library also did not realize that the young man sweeping and dusting beside them possessed power magnitudes beyond theirs.\nAnother fellow library worker dubbed ’Second Fool’ wouldn’t think to worry about unrelated matters either.\nWatering, sweeping, organizing books.\nNo one paid attention to such an insignificant person.\nOver a year of deep cultivation in the Book Pavilion, Li Hu had already read through one-third of the books.\nHis strength growing, his Spiritual Power even more powerful, increasing the speed of his reading as well.\nHowever, the smooth path of cultivation also met a bottleneck.\nThe books and martial arts in the library were only basic. The Martial Arts Techniques, when involving the Innate Realm, reached their limit, and barely touched on anything at the Grandmaster threshold.\nEven in the memoirs of the Celestial Essence progenitors and elders, there’s no content related to Grandmaster.\nLi Hu speculated, the Grandmaster threshold is likely a sect-orchestrated secret tradition.",

      "content": "Chapter 333: Chapter 004 Three Years as Grandmaster (Second Update)\nThe Library, in the end, is not a very important place within the Celestial Essence Sect.\nThe various martial arts within it are just basic materials in the entire martial world, and the martial arts secret manuals above the middle level of the Celestial Essence Sect could never be stored in such a place.\nThat Li Hu was able to cultivate to the peak of the Innate Realm relying on the hundreds of basic martial arts secret manuals in the Library, was already considered extremely incredible by outsiders.\nAs for the secrets above the Grandmaster level, those secrets that concern the rise and fall of a sect, and the sect’s secret teachings, would only be tightly held in the hands of a few high-level sect members like the Sect Leader and the Inheritance Elder.\nEven though, with his own realm and the scattered descriptions in the books of the Library about Grandmasters, Li Hu could deduce the techniques of the Grandmaster Realm by himself.\nBut, it was still not enough.\nWanting to shatter the void and create a path to a realm never tread upon by his predecessors, such difficulty was indeed overwhelming.\nBeing able to rapidly enhance his cultivation through a high realm did not mean that Li Hu could create another path in this world out of thin air.\nHe needed to learn.\nTo learn the knowledge and experiences of predecessors, to integrate various ingenious ideas from the forefathers, and to go one step further in creating a path of void shattering that belonged to him on the foundation of this world.\nThus, Li Hu’s spiritual power began to disperse, starting to expand beyond the Library.\nWhen in the Main World, Austin, who comprehended the Law of Wind, had developed a method of listening to the voice of the wind, forming a secret technique similar to Downwind Ear.\nAlthough this world had no Magic Power, nor the Law of Wind.\nBut the combination of sound vibrations and wind allowed Li Hu to eavesdrop through powerful spiritual power.\nBy referencing and improving on some techniques of enhancing hearing mentioned in tens of thousands of books in the Library, Li Hu successfully enveloped the entire Celestial Essence Sect under his surveillance.\nThe secret teachings of the Grand Elders, the various secrets between sects, the hidden locations of some critical inheritances.\nCountless secrets were eavesdropped by Li Hu.\nBy learning stealthily, Li Hu absorbed the essence of various martial arts from the hands of Celestial Essence Sect Elders, drawing from their profound meanings, step by step solidifying his foundation in martial arts.\nMeanwhile, in the dead of night, relying on powerful spiritual power and martial arts strength to sneak past patrolling personnel like a ghost, he infiltrated hidden places and perused the various secret teachings of the Celestial Essence Sect.\nEven the highest heart method of the sect, the Celestial Heart Treasure Manual, was memorized word for word by Li Hu.\nThe Celestial Essence Sect indeed well-deserved its reputation as a renowned sect in the Central Plains, with a variety of ingenious martial arts, each differing from the other, and some martial arts involving the power of Yin Yang Water and Fire, although rudimentary and lacking, the underlying concepts gave Li Hu great inspiration.\nFor example, the Fiery Palm essentially involves the transformation between True Qi and flames.\nAs well as the Cold Ice Profound Palm, Fiery Sun True Skill, Yin Luo Claw, etc.\nThese transformations of True Qi properties are somewhat similar to the natural element transformation of non-attribute Magic Power in the Main World; however, the activity of True Qi ultimately cannot compare to Magic Power, unable to directly condense into Fireball-like techniques as Magic Power can.\nAttribute damage for True Qi can only be considered secondary.\nThis interesting aspect of Inner Power, Li Hu directly noted it down, as if he cannot cultivate to shatter the void in the future, he might be able to use the Four Spirits Sword Array from the Main World, using external power to shatter the void.\nThis counts as a fallback for the future.\nVarious martial arts gave Li Hu great enlightenment, causing the Nourishing Essence Technique he cultivated to flow toward the direction of myriad ways converging, continually accommodating new cultivation technique ideas, and perfecting itself.\nThe one that played the greatest role in this was the Celestial Heart Treasure Manual, the sect’s secret masterpiece.\nAs the sect’s iconic secret book, it is the supreme martial arts of the entire Celestial Essence Sect.\nIn the history of Celestial Essence Sect, more than one Grandmaster has achieved the state of enlightenment through this Inner Power Heart Method; it can be said to be a divine skill secret manual that points directly to the Grandmaster.\nIts underlying concept is, more than anything, to harmonize between the human heart and the Celestial Heart, to perceive the power of heaven and earth nature, to gather the world’s majestic power into oneself.\nThe concept alone surpasses the various martial arts Li Hu gleaned from the sect elders by several levels, providing him with the greatest help.\nThis martial art gave Li Hu a particularly peculiar feeling.\nIt seems that the Celestial Essence Sect’s founding ancestor who left this martial art, had already touched the limit of a Grandmaster.\nPerhaps, had explored the bottleneck of the next realm.\nCelestial Being!\nThat is a realm that the world of martial arts history has never reached before.\nLi Hu had no intention of switching to the Celestial Heart Treasure Manual, because he felt that even if he truly cultivated the Celestial Heart Treasure Manual to the highest level, and broke into the Grandmaster, it would still be unlikely to shatter the void.\nThus, Li Hu, using the Celestial Heart Treasure Manual as a foundation, incorporated various concepts and profound meanings into his Inner Power.\nWith knowledge beyond the limits of this world, and powerful spiritual deduction abilities.\nThe Inner Power Li Hu cultivates today is no longer the original Nourishing Essence Technique; it’s an Inner Power method based on it, absorbing a large amount of martial arts essence.\nThis martial art, created by Li Hu himself by observing numerous martial arts and through extraordinary insight, is already a rare supreme skill in the world.\nNow, having absorbed some of the concept’s essence of the Celestial Heart Treasure Manual, it’s elevated further.\nTime,\nThus passed another year with Li Hu sweeping through the Library, listening to whispers around the Celestial Essence Sect’s gates, secretly learning martial arts secrets, and refining his own cultivation technique.\nA year later, with the Nourishing Essence Technique as the core, Li Hu integrated a vast amount of martial arts essence from the Celestial Essence Sect, creating a powerful Inner Power that surpassed the Celestial Heart Treasure Manual, ultimately achieving great success in divine skill, naturally breaking through the bottleneck of the peak of Innate, entering the Grandmaster Realm.\nEverything fell into place quietly and silently.\nIn absolute silence, no one knew there was already a second Grandmaster within the Celestial Essence Sect.\nMoreover, this newly promoted Grandmaster was unbelievably young.\nYet, despite the breakthrough to Grandmaster, standing among the top masters of this world, Li Hu’s life was without the slightest ripple.\nHe still read books, cultivated, and managed miscellaneous tasks.\nIn the Grandmaster Realm, through powerful spiritual power to manipulate True Qi, it was easy for him to clean the Library thoroughly.\nLi Hu then devoted more time to studying martial arts and cultivation.\nStriving for cultivation, reading more books, hoping to reach the realm of void shattering as soon as possible.\nThe entire Celestial Essence Sect had basically no secrets in his eyes, with the foundation of a whole sect, it was enough for Li Hu to cultivate to the Grandmaster Realm.\nAfter he integrated the martial arts of the entire Celestial Essence Sect to create that divine skill, the path for a Grandmaster was already a smooth one.\nNext, what he needed to do was cultivate.\nTo continue cultivating until breaking through to the Grandmaster, or even to a higher realm.\nThree years to achieve Grandmaster, Li Hu had already become one of the top level masters in this world, but he had no intention of leaving the Library to experience the outside world.\nHe needed to reach void shattering faster and return to the Main World, not having time to play games of wandering the martial world, acting chivalrous and upholding justice.\nUnless there was no further progress, then Li Hu would go down the mountain, seeking greater opportunity for advancement.\nIn the third year when Li Hu calmly achieved the Grandmaster realm, many things happened within the Celestial Essence Sect as well, with the reputed protagonist Zhang Feng’s fame spreading throughout the Sect, and beginning to show his edge in the martial world.\nFirst participating in the martial competition of the major factions in the Central Plains and winning first place, later braving several adventures, thwarting a certain Demon Sect conspiracy, with the title of Celestial Essence Sect’s foremost young talent beginning to spread across the world, with allied forces all saying that the Celestial Essence Sect had a promising future.\nDuring this period, Zhang Feng also made numerous enemies, once even attracting an enemy at the Grandmaster level, requiring the Grand Elder to take action.\nLooking at his experiences, it can be said that he is like a jinx, causing trouble wherever he goes.\nMeanwhile, Li Hu, as a Library servant, continued to sweep peacefully.",

He didn’t miss the tens of thousands of volumes of canon history collections and the travel journals of the ancestors of the Celestial Essence Sect.\nPhilosophical reflections from certain Daoist sages and ancient sages led Li Hu to some enlightenment.\nIn the mundane life of reading and sweeping, Li Hu’s mindset elevated to a new level.\nThe impatience of his early days dissipated, and through reading, cultivating his character, he gained a hint of the Daoist tranquility and naturalism.\nNowadays, if Li Hu were to return to the main world, even though his martial arts power might not be inheritable due to his body and the world, the spiritual cultivation he acquired from reading tens of thousands of books over these years would be a great gain.\nA strong spiritual cultivation aids in leveling up.\nWhen he returns to the main world, the legendary bottleneck blocking him will not be so immovable and difficult to overcome.\nThis unexpected journey brought him a big trouble, but if he could get through it, it would also be a significant gain.\nAs he improved his mindset at the same time,\nThrough reading tens of thousands of books over three years, his heart and mind became clear and wise, his cultivation realm silently broke through to the Grandmaster Realm.\nGrandmaster, already at the pinnacle of the world.\nLooking across the entire martial world, only three people have reached the Grandmaster Realm.\nThe leader of the righteous path, the master of Celestial Sword Manor, the Celestial Sword Elder, the Demon Sect Leader Jue Wutian, and the carefree wanderer Hai Wuya.\nThese three stand at the pinnacle of an era, watching the rise and fall of the times, deciding the destiny of sects and eras.\nBut now, the martial world is unaware that the three have become four.\nA lowly servant sweeping the library in the Celestial Essence Sect.\nLi Hu broke through to the Grandmaster Realm, yet no one knows. Scanning the entire Celestial Essence Sect, the highest martial arts cultivation belongs to the ancient master, the aging Grand Elder of the sect.\nWith Li Hu’s skills, if he doesn’t want others to know, no one can detect it.\nOne could say, the entire Celestial Essence Sect has become his backyard.\nNone of the thousands in the Celestial Essence Sect would ever imagine that there’s such a terrifying powerhouse hidden within their sect.\nIn fact, regarding the vast Celestial Essence Sect, they might not even recall or know of such an insignificant servant.\nLi Hu feels indifferent about the Celestial Essence Sect’s neglect.\nHe also doesn’t have any notions of a vulnerable grandmaster. In these six years at the library, each and every action has deeply ingrained itself into his martial practice instinct, being here is fine, no need to change location.\nLiving alongside the books in the library day and night, Li Hu subtly regards each book as his friend.\nComing to this world was just an accident.\nLi Hu has no intention to become famous throughout the world; he knows very clearly what his path is, which is to shatter the void.\nAnd now, after six years of diligent cultivation, his cultivation has reached the zenith of martial arts in this world.\nGrandmaster, already the highest realm in the history of this world.\nThere’s no road ahead in this world.\nThe rest is up to him to pave a new path, a road directly towards shattering the void.\nHaving read tens of thousands of books in the library, Li Hu already has some ideas.\nIn the hundreds of years of the Celestial Essence Sect’s existence, occasionally there were extraordinary individuals with ideas, creating secret techniques that even impressed Li Hu.\nCombining these with the fantastical notions of some fantasy novels he read in his previous life, Li Hu has conceived several ideas for shattering the void.\nFor example, compressing True Qi within his body, until its quantity changes produce qualitative changes, ultimately generating power comparable to the shattering level.\nOr seeking the ultimate principles of heaven and earth, harnessing the power of the sun, moon, and stars to cleanse himself, pursuing transcendence through the power of the Dao.\nOr, like in immortal fantasies, forming a Martial Arts Golden Core, attracting tribulation, thereby gaining the power to ascend.\nIf Li Hu’s any idea were shared with outsiders, countless martial artists would dismiss it as mere fantasies of idle people.\nThese paths transcend this martial world, surpassing its martial arts, appearing more like imagination.\nBut how would ordinary people know that when martial arts reach their extreme, how different is it from legend?\nMoreover, these three paths are merely extensions and deductions from failing secret techniques found amongst the tens of thousands of books in the Celestial Essence Sect’s library.\nIt can be said that any path has a certain foundation.\nBut Li Hu is not eager to personally attempt to create these paths.\nYears of polishing his mindset have dissipated his initial impatience, making his actions more cautious.\nThe most important thing is that his own cultivation level has just entered the Grandmaster Realm.\nSince the founding ancestor of the Celestial Essence Sect who left the Celestial Heart Treasure Manual managed to explore the extremes of the Grandmaster and the threshold of the Celestial Human Dao, it means that while the Grandmaster is the pinnacle of martial arts history, it hasn’t reached its ultimate limit yet.\nHe still needs to cultivate further until reaching the extremes of the Grandmaster, or break through to the unprecedented Celestial Human Realm.\nOnly when reaching the ultimate limit of martial arts in this world, when there’s no way forward, will Li Hu try those paths.\nBecause only standing in a higher place can you see further.\nTouching the limits of this world, one is qualified to speak of pioneering a new path of shattering the void.\nFurthermore, these ideas are ultimately just ideas, not mature systems, creating a Heaven-Reaching Dao is incredibly difficult.\nReaching the end of this road, then paving another.\nIt will always be easier.\nFor three years, Li Hu quietly swept the floor in the Book Pavilion, while the seemingly protagonist Celestial Essence Sect disciple Zhang Feng after years of cultivation, entered the Innate realm in one stroke, breaking the record of the youngest age to enter Innate set by the sword gentleman of Celestial Sword Manor.\nLater, during his travels in the Central Plains, various plot developments unfold, rescuing damsels in distress, attracting admiration from various heroines, making enemies of aristocratic disciples, breaking through Demon Sect conspiracies, exploring ruins and receiving martial arts inheritance from a dying elder, discovering treasures and acquiring divine weapons in caves...\nRecently, at the martial arts assembly, he defeated the martial world’s sword gentleman Dao Yuange, becoming the leader of the younger generation in the martial world.\nHe was renowned nationwide, becoming the personal disciple of the Celestial Essence Sect’s Grand Elder, gaining the affection of countless martial heroines and sect sisters, practically reaching the peak of life.\nTo this, Li Hu, sweeping the floor in the library, just smiled knowingly.\nNo matter how it looks, it’s like some ancient web novel tropes, but it has nothing to do with him.\nThe Celestial Essence Sect was abuzz with excitement over the emergence of a genius, and the martial world was stirred by Zhang Feng, but none of it affected life in the tranquil library.\nSince it doesn’t affect him, Li Hu naturally has no intention of getting involved.\nHowever, the unchanging life was ultimately broken.\nShortly after Zhang Feng reached the peak of life, the old master of the Celestial Essence Sect passed away, shattering the last pillar of the sect.\nOn that day,\nOne of the four Demon Venerables of the Demon Sect, the Cyan Dragon, led a large number of Demon Sect followers to strike the Celestial Essence Sect.\nWith the only Grandmaster fallen, the crisis of sect extermination is imminent.\nThe peaceful life of cultivation was ultimately shattered in an instant.",

Elders, follow me into battle!\"\nThe sorrowful voice echoed throughout the grand hall, filled with a momentum of facing death head-on.\nBoom!\nA vast aura unfolded within the hall, sweeping like a tsunami. The air currents trembled in the void, pressing forth with a rolling force, making the entire hall seem to shiver.\nThe Celestial Essence Sect Leader and the few remaining elders behind him soared like meteors, gathering powerful energy as they rushed out of the hall.\nAt this moment, everyone was fully unleashing their innate level power.\nThis was a fight to the death!\nEven at the cost of their lives, they needed to leave a glimmer of hope for the seeds of the Celestial Essence Sect!\nHowever, just as the Celestial Essence Sect’s elders and others, harboring the resolve to die, flew out of the hall—\nOne of the four demon lords of the Demon Sect, Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable, had already arrived!\n\"Hahaha! The Celestial Essence Sect is truly in decline! With that old fogey dead, only you incompetent juniors are left. In that case, to prevent you from sullying the sacred land’s name of the martial world, let the Celestial Essence Sect be erased from the world today!\"\nA voice, resonant like a great bell, instantly echoed between heaven and earth, seemingly imbued with majestic magic power. It surged like a tide, rolling from the sky like a mighty torrent.\nThe deafening sound caused the sect leader and elders, who had just flown past the hall doors, to have their breaths caught, almost vomiting blood.\nBut that wasn’t the end.\n\"Great Sorrow Demon Palm!\"\nAccompanied by a thunderous voice akin to divine wrath, the light dimmed in the skies outside the hall. Strange phenomena erupted abruptly, seeming as if an enormous demonic figure several zhang high sat in the void, its demonic seal reaching to the hearts. A terrifying demonic hand conjured countless phantasmal shadows, covering the skies as it descended upon the Celestial Essence Sect’s leaders.\nBoom boom boom!\nThunder roared, powerful energy swept, the Celestial Essence Sect Leader and the innate elders had no power to resist, being blasted away.\nSwooping figures hadn’t even crossed the hall’s threshold before being sent flying back!\nMeanwhile, the powerful residual palm force, its True Qi reverberating, filled the surroundings, making the entire hall rumble like a terrifying thunderclap.\nThe tremendous explosion echoed around, causing half of the hall to collapse with a thunderous crash!\nTiles crumbled, beams shattered, and wooden splinters fell like snow, scattering dust in all directions.\n\"Pfft!\"\nFalling to the ground along with the collapsing debris were the Celestial Essence Sect Leader and elders who were sent flying back, spitting a mouthful of blood.\nWith just one clash, several high-tier innate martial artists couldn’t even resist, falling like decaying wood in utter defeat.\nThis is a grandmaster!\nCyan Dragon Demon Venerable, one of the infamous demon sect grandmasters in the martial world!\n\"Celestial Essence Sect, so that’s all it amounts to.\"\nWith a cold and eerie voice, a withered, sharp-featured middle-aged man suddenly appeared.\nHis speed was such that he seemed to flash over, crossing several spans to appear amidst the mostly collapsed grand hall.\nGlancing around at the crowd, he indifferently flicked his fingers a few times. Sharp black energy shot out, piercing the heads of the elders who had fallen to the ground, their breath withering.\nPop pop pop.\nTheir heads exploded, and the Celestial Essence Sect elders lay scattered on the ground, blood and brains smeared everywhere, with no breath left.\nWitnessing this, the elite Celestial Essence Sect disciples retreating from the hall felt their eyes tear up in rage.\nAmong them was the cherished disciple, Zhang Feng, of the Celestial Essence Sect.\nThough in the sect’s rise, he faced a lot of suppression, he had many family and companions.\nThe lively little junior sister, the gentle senior sister, the master with a sharp tongue and a soft heart, the solemn sect leader, and the long-passed grand elder who held high hopes for him, tirelessly covering up his troubles!\nBut now, everything had turned to ashes under the Demon Sect’s assault.\n\"Demon Sect, one day I will repay this enmity tenfold!\"\nPerhaps Zhang Feng’s gaze was too intense with hatred, catching the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable’s attention from afar.\n\"So there’s still a bunch of little rats. Today our sect aims to annihilate yours, how can we let you escape.\"\nCyan Dragon Demon Venerable leaped, seemingly traversing tens of zhang to suddenly appear in front of the fleeing Celestial Essence Sect disciples. With a casual wave, a towering tsunami-like giant wave surged towards them.\nThe divine might swept forth, leaving no chance of escape, no room to dodge!\nIn this moment of crisis, a figure dashed forward.\n\"Go!\"\nIt was the Celestial Essence Sect Leader, hanging onto a breath of life, arriving just in time, grabbing Zhang Feng, while simultaneously pushing the surrounding disciples out of Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable’s palm force range, then flying away.\nBam!\nThough Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable’s palm force had not yet dissipated, its aftershock struck the Celestial Essence Sect Leader’s back, immediately inflicting serious injury, blasting him like a cannonball into a tall building behind.\nBoom!\nThe walls exploded, splinters flew.\nThrough the massive breach in the wall, fallen shelves could be seen, books scattered all around.\nThis was clearly the Celestial Essence Sect’s library.\n\"Hmph, since you wish to die so much, I’ll send you to King Yama ahead of time!\"\nBecause of the Celestial Essence Sect Leader’s intervention, those disciples of the Celestial Essence Sect managed to scatter and flee.\nCyan Dragon Demon Venerable’s face darkened. With a cold snort, his form swooped like a poisonous serpent, swiftly covering dozens of zhang, suddenly passing through the gaping hole in the wall to enter the library.\nSweeping his gaze around, he saw not far away the Celestial Essence Sect Leader, gravely injured and collapsed, blood gushing from his mouth.\nJust as Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable was about to strike to kill him, his actions suddenly halted.\nUnbeknownst to when,\nthe surrounding space echoed with the rustling sound of sweeping,\nIn the empty and desolate grand hall, a shadowy figure slowly approached from the depths of the dim bookcases.",

Some buildings had even caught fire, black smoke billowing into the sky.\nHowever, at this moment inside the Library, the atmosphere was completely different from the external world filled with murderous intent and chaotic warfare.\nPeace, tranquility.\nAs if isolated from the chaotic world, standing silently.\nVast and desolate, quietly profound.\nA servant slowly walked over from a distance, holding a simple broom that had lost almost all its bristles.\nSweeping the dust from the ground, one stroke at a time.\nAs if everything outside had nothing to do with him, the entire Library was enveloped in a peaceful and serene air.\nOut of place with the external world.\nCyan Dragon Demon Venerable instinctively sensed something amiss.\nYet he couldn’t pinpoint where it was wrong.\nAs one of the rare Grandmaster Level experts in the current Martial World, Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable had an extraordinarily keen sense of danger since childhood.\nIt was precisely this keen intuition that allowed him to evade countless dangers in the harsh and brutal Demon Sect, eventually rising to become one of the four Demon Venerables, a high-ranking figure within the sect.\nHowever, today, the intuition that repeatedly helped him escape danger seemed shrouded in mist, becoming obscure.\nIncredibly bizarre.\nAs Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable’s expression flickered with doubt and uncertainty.\nThe sweeping servant had already reached him.\nWhen sweeping broken bricks and wooden debris on the ground, the servant stopped, looking around.\nHis gaze touched upon the wall with a large hole in front, the floor strewn with rubble, and the messy scattered books around, his eyes filled with confusion.\nAfter a long while,\nHis eyes cleared once more.\nHis dark pupils, like a deep Starry Sky, devoid of any impurities.\n\"Venerable, are you one of the Demon Sect from the south? Celestial Essence is already defeated, the sect’s Grandmasters have fallen, Elders and disciples have suffered heavy losses, no longer able to resist your sect’s matters, can today’s events end here?\"\nThe calm voice pulled Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable’s thoughts back to reality.\nLooking at the unremarkable young sweeping servant before him, who seemed unable even to grasp the situation, Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable spoke indifferently:\n\"Oh, what if I say no?\"\n\"The Buddhist scriptures say, put down the butcher knife and become a Buddha immediately, as heaven has the virtue of cherishing life. Celestial Essence is defeated, nine out of ten disciples are gone, further slaughter is of no benefit. I believe Venerable will agree.\"\nThe young servant earnestly expressed, his eyes shining with a gleam.\n\"Buddhist scriptures? I am a demon, the enemy of the Buddha after all!\"\nCyan Dragon Demon Venerable showed a mocking smile, his deep voice spread out.\nBefore the words were completely out, his figure suddenly flashed like drifting clouds, his right hand reached out into the void, black True Qi condensed into the Yin Luo Ghost Claw, carrying a dark Senluo Qi, lowering the surrounding temperature, and clawed towards the servant’s head.\nMoments ago it was all smiles and pleasantries, but in the next instant, it was full of murderous intent.\nThis claw came too fast, in a blink of an eye the chilling Yin Luo Ghost Claw was just a few feet away from the servant’s head!\nCyan Dragon Demon Venerable did not hold back at all, going all out, he even used the Demon Sect’s ultimate skill.\nFor the inexplicably appearing servant before him, he instinctively felt something was off.\nThis sense of unease made him decide to nip this threat in the bud.\nIn this world, almost no one could withstand a Grandmaster’s full-force sneak attack.\nThe servant in front of him would be no exception,\nSeeing the ordinary young servant about to perish under this claw, at this moment,\n\"Alas.\"\nA sigh, Li Hu shook his head, his broom slowly drawing across the ground.\nHis movements weren’t fast, compared to the toppling Yin Luo Ghost Claw, it was more like an old man leisurely practicing Tai Chi.\nHowever, what seemed slow, instead was ahead, completed the stroke before the Yin Luo Ghost Claw descended.\nFast and slow, at this moment seemed to achieve opposite effects,\nAs if the flow of time in that area had changed.\nWhoosh!\nAll of a sudden, before Li Hu, appeared an invisible, intangible three-foot wall of energy, Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable only felt as if he had crashed into a wall of copper and iron, unable to advance an inch!\nNo, with his Grandmaster Level cultivation, he could still break through a copper and iron wall with one palm.\nBut the invisible barrier before him, caused his Yin Luo Ghost Claw to freeze in midair!\nUtterly shocked and without time to react,\nLi Hu pulled back the broom as if filled with some mysterious trackline.\nBoom!!!\nIn an instant, powerful energy raged fiercely as gigantic waves surged forth like a tempest in the ocean, rolling up an immense torrent, sweeping in countless rubble, dust, and wood chips.\nCyan Dragon Demon Venerable was about to retreat, but was hit in the chest by the great wave, crashing through the large hole in the Library’s wall, being flung out.\nThud, thud, thud!\nForcing himself to stabilize mid-air, landing on the hard granite ground outside, leaving a trail of shattered footprints.\nSteadying himself once more, Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable looked gravely ahead at the Library.\nWho is that kid after all, and what technique is this?!\nThe large hole in the wall, like a gaping dark mouth of a monster, seemingly ready to devour everything.\n\"Greetings, Venerable!\"\nAt this moment, the Demon Sect followers in black night-wind clothing gathered around, facing Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable, kneeling on one knee.\nFrom a distance, some powerful Demon Sect members were also flying towards this direction.\nGlancing at the Library ahead that seemed to hide some evil spirits, then at the many Demon Sect members behind.\nGritting his teeth, his expression changed several times.\n\"Men, prepare oil and fire, burn the building in front, if anyone comes out, kill without mercy!\"\nThis time, Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable accepted the Sect Leader’s order to annihilate Celestial Essence, it was also the first large-scale operation of the southern Demon Sect in ten years.\nIf he couldn’t exterminate all the Celestial Essence Sect people, he might be seen as lacking ability by the Sect Leader.\nMoreover, with many Demon Sect members around, it gave him the confidence to deal with that mysterious young man of unknown depth.\nWhoosh!\nIn a few breaths, a team of Demon Sect members drew flaming arrows.\nBending bows, nocking arrows.\nFormed in rows, facing the Book Pavilion ahead.\nAt this moment,\n\"Alas!\"\nAnother sigh, but this sigh, compared to the previous one, was exceptionally long, full of helplessness from breaking the calm life, and more showing pity for those about to die.\nBefore the Demon Sect members could think of its meaning,\nBoom!\nSuddenly, an earth-shaking aura rose up into the sky, shooting straight to the highest heavens, causing the entire sky’s light to dim at that moment.\nDivine might omnipresent, as if heaven and earth!\nThe terrifying, boundless pressure rolled towards all beings.\n\"Grandmaster!!!\"\nCyan Dragon Demon Venerable’s face showed unprecedented horror, his figure stumbling as if about to crash to the ground, his eyes filled with disbelief, his voice becoming sharp.\nHow is this possible!",

      "content": "Chapter 337: Chapter 008: Graceful Departure\nNo matter what, the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable could not believe that at the very last moment when the Celestial Essence Sect was about to be destroyed, a peak-level supreme martial artist appeared!\nThat is a Grandmaster, after all. In today’s martial world, at this time, there are only three such people.\nIn these twenty years, it has been these three who dominated every change in the world’s situation!\nThe pinnacle of martial arts in the world, almost surpassing all existence!\nRecalling everything that happened earlier, how could the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable not realize that the seemingly ordinary servant sweeping the floor was the hidden grandmaster who unleashed this terrifying aura!\nBut how is that possible!\nThat unknown kid sweeping the floor in the sect is actually a Grandmaster?\nHowever, no matter how absurd the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable found it, this vast and terrifying aura in front of him was something he felt only on the Demon Sect Leader, Jue Wutian!\nThe absurd thought proved to be true!\nThe vast and boundless aura surged into the sky, instantly stirring the cosmic changes!\nAs the expansive aura unfolded, the terrifying force overwhelming the heavens swept forth. Inside the library, it seemed as if a fearsome primordial giant beast was slowly awakening, opening its eyes that could subdue heaven and earth, delivering immense oppression to all beings!\nAt some unknown time, a pitch-black, mountain-heavy cloud enshrouded the sky above.\nThe surrounding light dimmed at that moment, as if about to plunge into an infinite abyss of darkness.\nThe hundreds of Demon Sect followers surrounding the library, facing the increasingly terrifying oppressive aura in front of them, felt as if a mountain pressed down on their backs and their hearts were gripped by an invisible giant hand, forcing their bodies to retreat in terror.\nAt the same time, everyone on the scene had their pupils contracted, their scalps numb, and an inexplicable sense of great terror and impending doom surged from the bottom of their hearts.\nHorror, ominous!\nThe Demon Sect followers with their bows and arrows were so frightened that their faces turned pale, their bows and arrows dropped directly to the ground, and some even had mental breakdowns and fainted in fright.\nThis is a Grandmaster!\nJust the eruption of aura alone prompted a change in the cosmos, making people not even dare to think of resisting!\nThe Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable looked at the phenomenon ahead, feeling the endless fear from the depths of his soul, with horror and disbelief on his face, he stumbled back a few steps.\nThen, he suddenly shot forward, turning into a long black streak fleeing away, leaping tens of yards away before the many Demon Sect followers could react, vanishing into the crowd, like a bolt of lightning streaking down the mountain.\nWithout a care, he directly abandoned his subordinates around him,\nHe only wanted to escape this place as quickly as possible!\nA Grandmaster stands at the pinnacle of martial arts, wielding unparalleled power to shatter mountains and sever ridges.\nEven though the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable is a renowned grandmaster-level expert in the martial world, deemed a mighty figure anywhere in the martial arts realm, he still has no confidence in facing a grandmaster-level powerhouse.\nEscape!\nImmediately escape!\nIf the mission fails, it fails; even if he becomes marginalized within the sect, he must escape immediately!\nIn the blink of an eye, the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable had already fled several hundred yards from the library, about to cross the shattered gate of the Celestial Essence Sect.\nThe terrifying grandmaster behind him did not pursue.\nThe Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable felt a sense of joy at escaping death, but also a sense of resentment.\nWhen returning to the sect, he would report this matter to the Sect Leader, perhaps even embellish the story a bit.\nEven if he cannot take revenge on that kid himself, being forced to flee in such a sorry state today, this grudge cannot be left unavenged!\nIn any case, since he managed to escape with his life this time, he resolved to take revenge. If he could not convince the Sect Leader to personally take that damned guy’s head as a chamber pot, then he would not be one of the four Demon Venerables of the Southern Demon Sect, the Cyan Dragon!\nHowever, just as the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable was full of malicious thoughts, planning on how to sow discord when he returned.\nThe mysterious aura from the library, interwoven with the void, resulted in endless changes in the celestial secret aura.\nHuā lā lā!\nOne vortex after another gathered in the sky, raising a fierce storm that pierced through heaven and earth, shattering the dense surrounding dark clouds.\nThe black cloud in the sky enlarged due to the vortex, seemingly turning into a tornado-like whirlpool, with the pitch-black color spreading ominously, engulfing the surrounding airflow, seemingly devouring even the light as the heavy cloud whirlpool consumed it, making the sky dim rapidly.\nBut this was not the end!\nThe dense clouds were abruptly gathered by an invisible force, layer by layer, transforming into an enormous cloud hand above the sky like divine punishment, descending from the nine heavens!\nThe heavens possess five energies, the earth forms four seasons!\nReaching the grandmaster level in the realm of divine communication, one clearly perceives the five energies and four seasons and mastering Wind and Thunder Divine Techniques is no difficult feat.\nIt is precisely because they can wield the Power of Heaven and Earth and turn it into their own strength that grandmasters hold the supreme position in the martial world!\nThe Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable, in his rapid escape, suddenly felt a strong sense of foreboding, his heart chilled as if facing an apocalyptic catastrophe.\nHe turned around in terror,\nonly to see behind him, in the sky, a giant hand woven of clouds, Thunder, and lightning covering the heavens, shrouding the void, like the Five Finger Mountain in Buddha’s hand, suppressing him like the Monkey King.\nThe pitch-black palm, like a collapsing and falling sky!\n\"No!!!\"\nThe face of the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable showed unparalleled terror as the surrounding void seemed frozen, fixing him in place, unable to escape or evade!\nHe only managed to let out a final scream before that terrifying cloud hand descended with majestic divine power!\nWith no ability to resist, the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable, one of the four demon venerables of the invincible, mighty Demon Sect, was crushed into the earth like a fly swatted flat by that giant cloud hand!\nKaboom!!!\nAmidst the earth-shattering roar, the entire mountain gate of Celestial Essence Sect crumbled, huge rocks and soil collapsing, forming a gigantic palm print dozens of yards long, deeply embedded in the earth.\nMeanwhile, dust and soil rose in large swathes, obscuring the sky, and in an instant, the earth was filled with flying sand and stones, as if ushering in an apocalyptic disaster.\nThe tremors between heaven and earth lasted for some time before they subsided.\nThe Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable, under this single palm across hundreds of feet, was completely reduced to flesh.\nThe entire Celestial Essence Sect was plunged into dead silence.\nMany Demon Sect followers stood dumbstruck, unable to hold onto their weapons, which dropped to the ground unnoticed.\n\"Invincible, unbeatable! What kind of martial arts is this, is it an immortal technique?\"\n\"Legendary martial arts, reaching the utmost, possesses the power to connect heaven and earth; the rumors were true!\"\n\"I... I won’t fight! Even the venerable got crushed by a palm. Whether I stay or leave makes no difference!\"\nSome Demon Sect followers muttered in a daze.\nSome Demon Sect followers, terrified by this myth-like spectacle before them, dropped their weapons and ran off in horror.\nSoon, fear spread to all Demon Sect followers attacking the mountain. Many felt weakness in limbs, abandoning weapons, fleeing helter-skelter.\nIn no time, the countless Demon Sect followers who had previously ravaged the Celestial Essence Sect disappeared completely, leaving behind only a desolate ruin scattered around.\nWithin the library, the severely injured Sect Leader of Celestial Essence Sect stared blankly, stunned at the young servant still slowly sweeping the floor not far away, unable to comprehend.\nThe remaining disciples of Celestial Essence Sect also stood dazedly, bewildered.\nZhang Feng was no exception,\neveryone remaining in Celestial Essence Sect was completely lost.\nThe entire Celestial Essence Sect was deathly silent.\nWhen the gaze of the remaining people accidentally touched the direction of the library, they all tightened inwardly, dared not look directly, and turned their gaze away.\nSoon, after the sweeping was done.\nLi Hu placed the broom in the usual corner, opened the library door, and stepped out.\nBehind him, the door leaves closed automatically, with an invisible force lifting the previously collapsed shelves, restoring each book to its place.\nEverything reverted to its original state, except for the large hole that had been broken in the library, though the surrounding debris was also swept clean.\nAs the sun set, the blood-stained sunlight outside the library spilled across the land.\nLi Hu walked with steady steps, casting a long shadow behind him, heading towards the distance.\n\"Life is like a dream, also like illusion; morning creeps like dew, evening blooms like sunset; caught in the worldly haze, thousands of causes and effects, born and extinct, freely meandering...\"\nHis steps weren’t fast, but seemed to shrink distances, disappearing from everyone’s sight in the blink of an eye, leaving only a clear song echoing in the heavens, lingering for long...",

      "content": "Chapter 338: Chapter 009: Shocking the World (First Update)\n\"Celestial Essence Sect’s grandmaster-level Aoki Elder has passed away, and the Demon Sect launched a surprise attack on the mountain.\"\n\"A mysterious grandmaster appeared, saving the day; with a single palm strike, he annihilated one of the Demon Sect’s four mighty Demon Venerables, the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable!\"\n\"Rumors say the recently appointed grandmaster was but a floor-sweeping servant of the Celestial Essence Sect, who revealed breathtaking cultivation prowess at just nineteen years old!\"\nThat day near the Celestial Essence Sect, countless carrier pigeons flew, numerous horses ran to death, spreading explosive news across the world.\nLike a bolt from the blue in the martial arts world, all across the land it caused a sensation, shaking the very foundations, and turning the martial arts world into a bubbling cauldron, thoroughly boiling over.\nUnknown and unseen, one becomes famous overnight.\nIn short, this encapsulates the life of the most prominent, widely discussed, and intensely debated new grandmaster from the Celestial Essence Sect who emerged suddenly in the martial arts world.\nFrom the day Li Hu struck with one palm against the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable, showing an immense hand of legend across the sky, killing the infamous Cyan Dragon, and driving back the Demon Sect, then left swiftly,\nthe news spread to the outside world, instantly causing a sensation throughout the martial arts world.\nAlong with numerous incredible stories and details emerging, the name Li Hu spread rapidly, shaking the world.\nFame brought shock to the entire world overnight.\nNo announcement has ever stirred such intense discussion and spurred topics so widely.\nThe protagonist’s legendary story is truly unbelievable, beyond imagination.\nCountless eyes turned to the Celestial Essence Sect, digging out information on the new grandmaster.\nEvery martial artist who saw the details found them incredibly baffling, unable to comprehend how this person ascended to the pinnacle realm of grandmaster-level martial arts.\n\"Orphaned young, raised in the Celestial Essence Sect, became a floor-sweeping servant at thirteen, then swept floors below the library for years, solitary and withdrawn, few in the Sect knew him...\"\nA plain name and simple background.\nNot a disgrace, never rejected in marriage, no elder oppression, nor did he encounter any scheming against him.\nFor years, his routine consisted only of sweeping, eating, sleeping in a monotonous cycle, with no signs of martial arts practice or guidance from any renowned master.\nAmong countless background characters supporting the rise of protagonists, he remains one with an unnoticed name.\nYet such a commonplace servant suddenly displayed the pinnacle of martial arts prowess, achieving a realm countless dreams of at a tender age!\nIf not for the death of the old grandmaster bringing about the Demon Sect’s attack, perhaps neither the Celestial Essence Sect nor anyone in the world would know a grandmaster had emerged on the martial arts scene!\nEveryone who heard this news felt as if they had seen a ghost, preferring to believe they were dreaming instead of accepting that such a grandmaster-level expert surfaced abruptly.\nIs there anything remarkable in this resume?\nNo!\nSwept floors for years and then reached the absolute pinnacle of martial arts?\nRidiculous, not even novels dare write such a tale.\nEven more shocking is that even if the new grandmaster began cultivating within the womb, at most he has only reached eighteen now!\nIn such a short time, he achieved earth-shattering accomplishments, reaching a realm countless martial artists of previous generations failed to attain throughout their lives, enough to make any talented martial artist hide their face in shame.\n\"Barely nineteen yet dominates the world, reaching the pinnacle, all my decades of bitter cultivation amount to what?!\"\nAn elder in the martial arts world during a breakthrough banquet into the Innate mid-stage was left speechless upon hearing the news, expressing embarrassment.\nHalf a life of cultivation inferior to a youth.\nIf it were anything else, even Celestial Sword Manor’s Sword Prince in the Innate mid-stage surpassed numerous forebears but remained within reason, elders in the martial world at most sighing that the waves of the Yangtze push onwards, without being so disheartened.\nGrandmaster-level, the distance too great, leading to despair, shattering one’s resolve.\n\"A mere servant and slave before reaching adulthood exceeds the martial world’s peak, probably making him the first in history!\"\n\"I foolishly believed myself a genius in the eyes of townsfolk, now revealed as merely a frog in a well.\"\nA newly rising martial prodigy hears the news and weeps, covering his face.\n\"My sect also has a similarly solitary servant who has swept for fifty years, I wonder if he’s made it to grandmaster level, might I still have time to become his disciple.\"\nYouth, quick-witted.\nThe martial arts world is bustling, amidst strange concerns seemingly mixed within.\nWithin days, various sects and families saw turmoil with numerous sweeping servants troubled by youths seeking to become disciples, leaving them terrified yet puzzled, feeling harassed.\nSome families were so disturbed that elders grew angry, punishing dream-chasing youths by making them squat under the sun all day.\nBut even the full day of squatting brought news.\nIn the Scripture Pavilion of Shaolin Temple, indeed, there is an unnamed sweeping old monk who hides as a grandmaster-level expert.\nIt’s said when the old monk was discovered, faced with visiting monks, he seemed utterly bewildered, unaware how he was exposed.\nWith Shaolin Temple’s news, family sects’ youths grew even more excited, some elders couldn’t resist going to investigate.\nOf course, these bits of news were mere interludes amidst the bustling martial arts world; most eyes remained on the newly departed grandmaster.\nThose with insight know well what a newly risen grandmaster signifies.\nThe formerly three-way stand-off becomes a division into four factions, meaning balance is broken, a sign that world order is about to shift dramatically!\nYet, unexpectedly for the leaders fretting day and night,\nsince the departure of the new grandmaster from Celestial Essence Sect, he has vanished into the masses, with no news henceforth.\nJust as he once guarded the library silently for years, thereafter no information emerged, seeming to treat martial world fame as dirt.\nEven with endless discussions in the martial arts world about the legendary grandmaster, with time the topic’s intensity gradually waned as the person did not stir.\nSome say the \"sweeper\" sought no fame, now secluded in the secluded valley.\nOthers claim since the \"sweeper\" killed the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable, it drew the arrogant Demon Sect Leader Jue Wutian to kill him in desolation, his body lying in the wilderness.\nSpeculation abounds, without consensus.\nIn a flash, three years passed.",

      "content": "Chapter 339: Chapter 010: The Origin of Martial Arts\nThree years later, outside Xiangyun City.\nThese days, the area outside Xiangyun City has become lively.\nMartial artists from afar have braved hardships to come here, inch by inch searching the vast forests for something.\nThese martial artists come in strange numbers, as Xiangyun City isn’t a Martial Arts Sacred Land nor the site of any martial arts gathering, yet the sudden influx of so many martial practitioners has left the mountain villagers perplexed.\nFortunately, among this large number of martial artists, there are many gallant heroes who treat riches like dirt, often spending lavishly to hire strong young men from the villages to venture into the Vast Mountains as guides, giving the villagers a rare opportunity to earn a considerable amount of silver coins.\nThe reason for this large gathering of martial artists is a rumor spreading across the martial world.\nIt is said that a Hunter, while evading a predator, accidentally stumbled into a secluded valley and discovered a mysterious White Jade Stele, bringing out a mostly destroyed ancient Cultivation Bamboo Scroll.\nA capable individual in the martial world translated the first five characters of the scroll, which read:\nMartial Arts Origin Scripture!\nThis incident stirred up great waves in the martial world, even rivaling the emergence of the mysterious Celestial Essence Grandmaster three years ago.\nBecause the Martial Arts Origin Scripture is tied to an ancient legend about the origins of martial arts in this world.\nIn the martial world, it is commonly believed that the origin of martial arts dates back to the earliest ancestors who mimicked tigers and leopards, following nature, and cultivated the first wisp of True Qi, thereby opening the path to martial arts.\nSubsequently, through the changes of dynasties and the passage of time, it evolved to the flourishing diversity we see today.\nThis explanation is generally accepted by martial artists, and some major sects have even recorded it within their doctrines.\nHowever, alongside this widespread belief, another theory circulates.\nIt is said that in ancient times, the ancestors mimicked tigers and leopards, fighting beasts in the White Water Black Mountain, but what they learned as \"martial\" was merely ordinary combat techniques, lacking any mystical elements of martial arts, nor did they cultivate True Qi.\nWhat truly introduced Qi Cultivation in martial arts came from an extraordinary individual before the ancient Qin times—the Martial Ancestor!\nLegend has it that back then, the Dao Ancestor and Martial Ancestor were exchanging teachings under Purple Bamboo Mountain, when one day a strange stone descended from the heavens and landed outside Purple Bamboo Mountain.\nThe Dao Ancestor comprehended the strange stone, observed the ways of nature, and thus obtained the Tao Te Ching, marking the opening of the great path.\nThe Martial Ancestor sat in meditation for seven days and nights, copying the patterns from the stone, and suddenly achieved enlightenment, thus paving the way for Qi Cultivation in martial arts.\nLater, they debated for three days and nights, and the disciple of Dao Ancestor, Guan Yinzi, inscribed all the teachings of the two sages on the bamboo scrolls, naming it the Martial Arts Origin Scripture.\nHowever, when the last word was inscribed and the scripture was completed,\nheaven and earth reacted, with howling winds descending, akin to the wails of thousands of vengeful spirits, and blood rain fell from the sky.\nAmidst the upheaval of wind and thunder, purple lightning struck down from the sky, obliterating most of the bamboo scroll that recorded the Martial Arts Origin Scripture.\nThe Dao Ancestor remarked, \"A divine object is born and inevitably suffers the jealousy of heaven; the heavens wish not for its completion, there is no need to force it.\"\nThe Martial Ancestor also said, \"The great path has fifty, and the heavens evolve forty-nine, leaving a thread of opportunity; this is as it should be.\"\nThus, they did not record it again.\nAfterwards, the Martial Ancestor spread his teachings across the land, and martial arts began to flourish, gradually evolving into the state of Divine Land Martial Arts today.\nThe reason the Martial Ancestor fades from official history is said to be because, after achieving mastery in martial arts, he entered the Imperial Palace and, with unimaginable abilities, slew the ruler of the Liang Kingdom, the overlord of the Seven Kingdoms, under the watchful eyes of many, and single-handedly subdued the Seven Kingdoms, standing above worldly power.\nAfter the Martial Ancestor vanished, the descendants of the Seven Kingdoms, feeling it too humiliating, burned books and buried scholars, erasing the Martial Ancestor’s name from history, leaving only fragments in unofficial histories, becoming a legend in the martial world.\nAlthough it’s just a legend, as the saying goes, where there’s smoke, there’s fire, perhaps in the distant ancient times, there really was such a Martial Ancestor.\nNow that the Martial Arts Origin Scripture has emerged, how could it not attract the attention of martial artists?\nBut if it were only that, if merely some unofficial history of the Martial Ancestor surfaced, it might not have stirred such a storm.\nAfter all, not everyone is interested in delving into history.\nBut this time involves the Martial Arts Origin Scripture, which is said to be rejected by heaven and earth!\nAccording to legend, the Martial Ancestor, as the founder of martial arts under heaven, blessed by heaven and earth, reached an unparalleled realm that transcends even the Grandmaster level, surpassing all worldly powers!\nAnd if one could obtain the Martial Arts Origin Scripture, they would unravel all the mysteries of martial arts, and even the most dull-witted could swiftly reach the ultimate pinnacle of martial arts.\nThis is the revelation that truly caused an uproar in the martial world, leading countless martial artists to flock to Xiangyun City.\nThe villager who obtained the Martial Arts Origin Scripture disappeared without a trace after selling it to the Treasure Pavilion in Xiangyun City, along with the ruin of his village.\nFollowing that, the Treasure Pavilion also fell prey to a mysterious attack, turning to ruins overnight, and the Martial Arts Origin Scripture vanished without a trace.\nInitially, it was just rumors, and although they aroused some interest, it wouldn’t compel countless martial artists to abandon their pursuits and rush to Xiangyun City.\nWhat truly set things off was an incident half a month ago, involving the sole survivor of the Hongfu Escort Agency massacre, Zhang Zhiqi, who miraculously escaped with severed meridians. Somehow, he gained near Grandmaster-level cultivation and stormed the Taihang Mountain, annihilating the Taixing Thirteen Bandits who had slaughtered the Hongfu Escort Agency decades ago.\nHow could a person with shattered Dantian and severed meridians acquire such martial prowess overnight?\nIt truly makes one ponder deeply.\nLater, it was discovered that during the mysterious attack on the Treasure Pavilion in Xiangyun City, Zhang Zhiqi happened to be in Xiangyun City.\nAfter extensive investigation, it was concluded that on that very day, Zhang Zhiqi, who begged his way to Xiangyun City, fortuitously acquired the incomplete Martial Arts Origin Scripture amidst the chaos and received a great fortune, achieving astonishing cultivation powers and avenging his enemies.\nThis sparked a frenzy in the entire martial world.\nNumerous people who dream of leaping to greatness became excited, eager to seize the Martial Arts Origin Scripture.\nBut after vanquishing the Taixing Thirteen Bandits, Zhang Zhiqi vanished without a trace.\nWith no other choice, in pursuit of further opportunities and the chance for that leap to greatness, countless martial artists gathered outside Xiangyun City, hoping to find the secluded valley that lucky Hunter had reached, hoping to discover the relics left by the Martial Ancestor, even if it were just a fragment of the Martial Arts Origin Scripture.\nHence, during this period, a large number of martial artists have gathered here, continuously exploring the mountains outside Xiangyun City.",

      "content": "Chapter 340: Chapter 011: In Front of the Gate of the Celestial Being (Third Update)\nOutside Xiangyun City, amidst a bustling crowd, inside a quiet courtyard, Li Hu sat on a stone stool, holding a half-charred ancient bamboo slip in his hand, and sighed helplessly.\n\"Master, this matter arose because of the servant. Allow me to go explain clearly to those people.\"\nAt this moment, a young man dressed as a servant standing respectfully beside Li Hu stepped forward and spoke.\nThis person was clearly only about twenty years old, yet his face showed a weariness unexpected for someone of his age.\nIf someone familiar were here, they would surely be shocked, for the young man attending Li Hu was surprisingly Zhang Zhiqi, who had recently stirred great waves in the Martial World from the remnants of Hongfu Escort Agency!\n\"No need for that. Although these people have disrupted my plans, having them scout is not bad. The mountains outside Xiangyun City stretch for hundreds and thousands of miles. If I were to search alone, who knows when I’d find the place. If they can locate it, that would be excellent.\"\nLi Hu shook his head slightly, speaking in a faint voice.\nHe tidied up the Martial Arts Origin Scripture in his hand and looked at the young man beside him.\n\"You need not do so. Although I granted you this strength, it was merely to find someone to test my skills. It was your luck that you survived and broke through to a half-step Grandmaster. Moreover, you offered the Martial Arts Origin Scripture to me. There is no debt between us.\"\nHis indifferent voice flowed like clear music in the air; Li Hu no longer looked at the person before him and slowly stood up.\nWith a few steps, he disappeared outside the door in an instant, as if shrinking the earth into inches, leaving only a faint voice resonating in the air.\n\"Go, you have avenged your great enemies. Do not demean yourself; I do not need a servant...\"\n\"Master!\"\nZhang Zhiqi was greatly alarmed, yet Li Hu’s figure had already drifted away, completely disappearing from his perception.\nHe stood motionless for a long, long time before bowing deeply towards the direction Li Hu left.\n\"Master teaches me Techniques, guides me onto the path, helps me to avenge, with grace as heavy as a mountain; how could a mere booklet be enough to repay?\"\nZhang Zhiqi’s eyes reddened slightly, tears streaming down.\nAlas, Li Hu had already gone far away.\nThe speculation in the Martial World was correct; the Martial Arts Origin Scripture was indeed acquired by Zhang Zhiqi that day.\nBut the Martial Arts Origin Scripture was not the cause of his transformation into a half-step Grandmaster; a mere ancient bamboo slip, even if influenced by the Purple Thunder Power, couldn’t possibly grant someone Heaven-Reaching Cultivation overnight.\nIf it truly could, the original lucky Hunter who first obtained the Martial Arts Origin Scripture wouldn’t have left no bones behind, and the Treasure Pavilion managers wouldn’t have perished under mysterious attackers.\n...\nLi Hu, drifting away, faintly perceived Zhang Zhiqi’s reaction behind him,\nbut he did not care.\nDuring these three years, he transformed countless times and traveled everywhere, sometimes as the Shaolin Firework Head Monk, chopping wood and burning fires in the kitchen for half a year.\nSometimes he transformed into a merchant, selling local specialties on the street before Celestial Sword Manor.\nOther times he became a barefoot doctor, traversing the South Wilderness Mountains.\nIn these three years, he practically traversed the entire world.\nFrom the Sacred Land of Martial Arts at Shaolin Temple, to the seven major sects of the Central Plains, and even the Demon Sect Forbidden Cave, countless places have seen his shadow.\nSimultaneously, with extremely powerful Spiritual Power’s help, every sect, every family, all their archived books and secret martial arts manuals have fallen into Li Hu’s hands.\nThe various secret martial arts of the entire Martial World were all explored and acquired by him, assimilated within himself.\nThis is the effect of extremely powerful Spiritual Power. Although various Talent Magic in the Main World cannot be utilized in this non-magical world, Spiritual Power, except for its physical endurance limit, has no restriction.\nEven due to different Martial Arts, the powerful Spiritual Power has formed an effect similar to Divine Sense in Cultivation.\nAnd it is because of this immense Spiritual Power that Li Hu not only acquired ninety-nine percent of the Martial Arts Secret Manuals as if in a realm without anyone, but comprehended them thoroughly, assimilating them within himself.\nNo one in the entire Martial World knows that their cherished martial inheritance has been utterly stolen by an unremarkable, ghostly wanderer, becoming his own possession.\nAnd having assimilated ninety-nine percent of today’s Martial Arts essence, Li Hu’s Cultivation has reached the pinnacle unobtainable in worldly Martial Arts.\nThe pinnacle of Grandmaster!\nResiding in this Realm, he can already touch the unseen yet existent ceiling above.\nIf he could break through the ceiling’s bottleneck constraints, he would enter another Realm—\nCelestial Being!\nThe Celestial Essence Sect’s founder who left the Celestial Heart Treasure Manual only deduced the possibility of the Celestial Human Realm’s existence.\nBut now, Li Hu has truly seen the existence of that Realm, and stands before its door.\nLi Hu’s strength is now undeniably the foremost in the Martial World.\nHowever, Li Hu cares not for fame and fortune within the Martial World, having not acted for three years, leaving outsiders completely unaware.\nUnfortunately, even though Li Hu has ascended to the peak of Martial Arts and thoroughly studied the secret manuals of ninety-nine percent of the world, possessing unfathomable knowledge, he still has no clue on entering the Celestial Human Realm.\nTo pave a direct path to breaking space-time, besides great wisdom and determination, one must at least reach the ultimate pinnacle of Martial Arts, only then having the possibility to pioneer with an advantage.\nTo achieve this goal, transcend the world.\nThe Martial Arts Celestial Being is the precondition for his testimony before that.\nHowever, the barrier before Celestial Being remains insurmountable.\nWhile Li Hu was pondering deeply, he inadvertently traveled to Xiangyun City and watched an interesting drama.\nA fortunate Hunter survived disaster and acquired a treasure, the greedy Treasure Pavilion managers murdered to seize treasure, acted rashly and leaked the news, leading to the intervention of the hidden Demon Sect in the city.\nUltimately, amidst the chaos, it fell into the hands of Zhang Zhiqi, a disabled beggar for years.\nLi Hu recalled the world’s rumors of the origin of Martial Arts, thinking of tracing back ancient origins that might reveal the hint to break into the Celestial Human.\nThus, he appeared before Zhang Zhiqi, proposing a trade to acquire the Martial Arts Origin Scripture.\nThis was the true situation.\nThe Martial Arts Origin Scripture merely recorded the words exchanged between the Dao Ancestor and the Martial Ancestor discussing the Dao years ago, with half of it already erased by Purple Thunder.\nAlthough the mutual discussions within transport Li Hu through space-time, back to ancient times hearing two greatest ancestors’ lectures, the weave of various ideologies made him gain tremendously.\nYet, in reality, the Martial Arts Origin Scripture doesn’t possess such destiny-altering capability for ordinary people.\n\"Dao Ancestor and Martial Ancestor indeed possess the innate Saint demeanor. Just a few words recording their conversation already pointed me towards breaking through to Celestial Being. Their Cultivation has surely exceeded Grandmaster! Now, I’m just missing a hint to break into Celestial Human—that’s the extraterrestrial stone that fell beside Dao Ancestor and Martial Ancestor!\"\nClearing his heart of clouds, Li Hu now found his direction, quickly stepping outside the city, his figure disappearing into the crowd.",

Order the sect to be prepared, for I shall soon head north to deal with that old fool, and the sect shall soon return to the Central Plains!\"\nJue Wutian flicked his sleeve and sat down with authority in the chief seat, a heavy and oppressive aura sweeping across the entire headquarters.\n\"The Holy Lord’s divine skill is unparalleled, ruling the Martial World forever!\"\nThe Demon Sect members shouted loudly,\nJue Wutian on the high platform looked down at the dense crowd of thousands in submission beneath his feet, his heart swelled with grandeur.\n\"Hahaha...\"\nHis laughter thundered like storm clouds, sweeping across the four corners of Demon God Mountain, announcing his arrival.\nTen years ago, the brilliant Demon Sect Leader Jue Wutian ascended to the Grandmaster realm, then led the Demon Sect on a massive invasion of the Central Plains.\nFor a time, the Southern lands were ablaze with fire, one force after another attacked and destroyed, placing the entire Central Plains Martial Arts world in peril.\nIn this crisis, the righteous path of the Central Plains invited the first Grandmaster under heaven, Celestial Sword Elder, to duel with the Demon Sect Leader Jue Wutian on Dongting Lake.\nThat battle shattered the heavens and earth; Jue Wutian, newly ascended to Grandmaster, with unstable foundations, ultimately lost to the sword of Celestial Sword Elder, fleeing back to the Southern Wilderness in embarrassment.\nBack at the Demon Sect headquarters, Jue Wutian sought to erase his shame, entering the forbidden area of Demon God Mountain in seclusion, hoping to break through the sect’s supreme Demon Scripture Netherworld Divine Skill to the Twelfth Layer, continuing until today.\nIn fact, three years ago, Jue Wutian’s Netherworld Divine Skill had already broken through to the Twelfth Layer, unprecedented and unmatched, subsequently spending time honing and stabilizing the realm, to increase his chances in the battle with Celestial Sword Elder.\nThree years ago, the Demon Sect was ready to head north, and the massacre of the Celestial Essence Sect was precisely a probe arranged by Jue Wutian during his seclusion.\nA large number of Demon Sect members gathered, and had prepared in the southern region of the Central Plains.\nThe great battle, about to erupt.\nDark clouds shrouded the sky, a storm was approaching.\n\"Hmm, where is Cyan Dragon? Only you three are here, where did Cyan Dragon run off to?\"\nOnce the members dispersed, with only the Demon Sect high-ranking remaining around the headquarters, within the deep main hall of the Demon Sect headquarters, Jue Wutian squinted his eyes slightly, his thunderous voice echoing within the hall.\nThree years ago, emboldened by his breakthrough to the Twelfth Layer of Netherworld Divine Skill, he sent forces north to probe.\nThe previous defeat against Celestial Sword Elder indeed taught him a lesson, making him more cautious than before.\nUnexpectedly, having just broken through, his realm was not yet stable, subsequently requiring him to re-enter seclusion until today to complete his consolidation and emerge.\n\"To report to the Holy Lord, three years ago Cyan Dragon, under the Holy Lord’s command, led the sect north...\"\nThe remaining three Demon Venerables exchanged glances, White Tiger stepped forward, narrating the events of three years ago.\nWithin the deep hall, silence prevailed, only the voice of White Tiger Venerable slowly echoing in the air, the atmosphere extremely oppressive.\nAfter White Tiger finished narrating,\nWith a loud bang, Jue Wutian slammed his hand on the armrest beside him, causing the air to subtly twist and reverberate.\n\"Audacious! Daring to kill my men!\"\nThe entire hall grew darker, the surrounding candlelight seemingly at its end, icy murderous intent nearly freezing upon the ground.\nJue Wutian’s gaze was deep, his sinister voice echoing:\n\"Very well, a mere newcomer, this time when I return to the Central Plains, before the showdown with Celestial Sword Elder, I need a Grandmaster’s head to offer to my banner!\"\nFrom the seat above, Jue Wutian slowly extended his hand, his face revealing a menacing expression.\nA black vortex appeared in the void, devouring the light of the entire hall, at that moment, where Jue Wutian was, transformed into a giant black hole, absorbing all worldly radiance.\nThe failure ten years ago indeed restrained Jue Wutian’s arrogant demeanor somewhat.\nBut after ten years of seclusion, the sect’s divine skill already practiced to the historically only theorized Twelfth Layer Realm, greatly enhancing his strength, even facing the current number one martial artist under heaven, Celestial Sword Elder, he was not the least afraid, much less just a newcomer Grandmaster?\nWith his current power, facing his ten-year-ago self, he was confident in taking him down within fifty moves.\nThough a Grandmaster is the peak of Martial World, Grandmasters among themselves ultimately differ!\n\"The Holy Lord’s divine skill is unparalleled, rule the Martial World forever!\"\nFeeling the presence of this Demon God-like abyssal Jue Wutian before them, the three Demon Venerables broke out in cold sweat, loudly shouting under the pressure of his mighty force.\n\"Hahaha!\"\n\"Send a challenge to Celestial Sword Manor, see you on Dongting Lake in a month, to death or life!\"\n\"Activate all operatives in the Central Plains! Locate that newcomer’s whereabouts! Before the decisive battle with Celestial Sword Elder, I want his head to announce my return to the Martial World!\"\nJue Wushen’s darkly ominous gaze turned northward, as though piercing through layers of space, seeing the Celestial Sword standing tall on the Divine Land, his immense fighting spirit soaring to the sky.\nHis true enemy remained the one who dominated the Central Plains for decades, Celestial Sword Elder.\nAs for that Grandmaster from Celestial Essence Sect, just an appetizer before the main course!\nDaring to provoke him, merely a casual matter to handle.",

      "content": "Chapter 342: Chapter 013 Raid\nOn the frontlines at the edge of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, stands an unnamed small town, several miles away from Xiangyun City.\nThe town is tiny, with such towns scattered across the Divine Land like stars in the sky.\nOrdinarily, someone at the First and Second Level of the Postnatal Realm would be considered an expert in this town.\nHowever, as the Martial Arts Origin Scripture spread, a multitude of martial artists flooded in, bringing a significant influx of people to this outpost deep in the Hundred Thousand Mountains.\nThe crowd bustled as martial artists from the Martial World mingled.\nMajor sects and forces sent their people to explore, and many hidden martial arts masters lurked in the shadows.\nNowadays, even someone with Innate abilities, once a rare sight, can be encountered casually on the streets.\n\"Look, those people are from the Celestial Essence Sect!\"\n\"Is that the most outstanding figure of the Celestial Essence Sect’s younger generation, Zhang Feng? It’s unexpected that, after not being seen since the Martial Arts Conference years ago, he’s already advanced to the mid-Innate Realm. It’s said that he recently defeated Dai Zong, the Southwest Divine Traveler. No wonder he’s a leading figure of the young generation. It seems after Qingsong Zhenren’s death, the Celestial Essence Sect finally has a successor.\"\n\"Hey, brother, you’re not quite right. Zhang Feng may be formidable, but in front of that person from Celestial Essence, what would that make him? It’s just a pity that those guys from Celestial Essence missed the greatest opportunity for sect revitalization due to their mediocrity.\"\n\"Indeed, the True Dragon has hidden for years, and yet their insight is lacking. No wonder one of the Martial Arts Sacred Lands has declined till now.\"\n\"Heh, even if they realized it, what use would it be? For me, if I didn’t wipe out Celestial Essence, that’d be a grace itself. And to think they helped them kill Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable and repelled the Demon Sect’s assault. Grandmaster Li, truly acts with noble intent.\"\nOn the streets, Zhang Feng led a group of Celestial Essence Sect disciples walking by.\nRecognizing them, those around began to chatter, and some disciples from other sects directly voiced their ridicule.\nThe purple-clad young woman behind Zhang Feng looked indignant, glaring at those mocking voices, ready to draw her sword in anger.\n\"Junior sister, there’s no need for anger. Don’t cause trouble here.\"\nA hand suddenly reached out, unobtrusively blocking the sword the young woman was about to draw.\nIt was Zhang Feng, striding nonchalantly ahead.\n\"Oh my, a little firecracker here, such a pretty little doll. You’ve offended the Demon Sect, and your forlorn sect is about to crumble. Why not hurry and find yourself a husband? Then you’d have someone to lean on, hahahaha.\"\nAt this, with a sarcastic voice, the purple-clad young woman fumed once more.\n\"Little junior sister, they are nothing but loudmouth cowards.\"\nSeeing her senior brother’s stern gaze, the young woman could only step back in frustration.\nSeeing her junior sister’s face torn between grievance and anger, Zhang Feng had to gently explain.\n\"Those people are merely from sects opposed to ours. In the past, they’ve said far worse, but they’re just cowards fleetingly flaunting their bravado. If our sect weren’t facing hard times and needed to lie low, wouldn’t senior brother already vent your anger? Those guys were nothing more than my defeated opponents at the Martial Arts Conference a few years ago.\"\nHearing Zhang Feng’s explanation, the purple-clad young woman calmed down a bit.\nStill, she appeared somewhat discontented, muttering under her breath.\n\"Senior brother, isn’t that person from the same cohort as you? Why doesn’t he lend a hand? If he just showed his face, our Celestial Essence Sect wouldn’t need to suffer such humiliation today.\"\nNaturally, she referred to Grandmaster Li Hu, who emerged on the scene three years ago.\nDespite the Celestial Essence Sect suffering significant blows during the Demon Sect’s attack, the entire Martial World knew that if that individual merely expressed slight intent, the Celestial Essence Sect would once again ascend as a Martial Arts Sacred Land.\nBut since the day he killed Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable, Li Hu has vanished without a trace.\nToday, the Celestial Essence Sect, guarding its assets, has no choice but to tread carefully.\nToward Li Hu, every disciple of the Celestial Essence Sect harbors complex feelings.\n\"It’s not like that. Though he was from the same batch as me, I only vaguely have an impression of him. We hardly share any relationship.\"\nZhang Feng slightly shook his head, his tone complex as he spoke.\nHis feelings about Li Hu were mixed with both admiration and envy.\nIf not for that person, he would have already been the star across the Martial World, the young generation’s leader.\nBut due to that person’s appearance, Zhang Feng’s brilliance, which could have shone in any era, was overshadowed like stars before the sun.\nA Grandmaster under twenty, such a feat, is simply too extraordinary and unimaginable.\nFor ages past, perhaps there’d only be this one instance.\nExcept, amidst that dazzling brilliance, living in the same era was the sorrow of all young martial geniuses.\nOnce that person emerged, they had already reached the peak that countless spend their entire lives failing to reach, standing atop the Martial World.\nThe extreme realm countless dream of, was, in his hands, easily achieved, seeing all fame and fortune as nothing.\nSuch talent and heart left Zhang Feng nothing but compelled admiration.\n\"That person not making a move, surely has his reasons. We just need to do our best and strive to develop Celestial Essence Sect.\"\nZhang Feng spoke somewhat ambiguously, brushing things aside.\nThough the Celestial Essence Sect had taken him in, the deaths of his parents and some past unsavory incidents in Celestial Essence weren’t suitable for detailed discussion with his junior sister.\nFor Li Hu’s decision, Zhang Feng understood.\nRelying on others is worse than relying on oneself. Although that man hailed from Celestial Essence, there wasn’t much affection to speak of. Their visit to this small town was to see if they had the chance to attain the Martial Ancestor’s legacy, gain the Martial Arts Origin Scripture, and alter the awkward circumstances of Celestial Essence today.\nAfter the street taunts, the group’s pace quickened.\nIn the town, people came and went.\nWithin the bustling streets and towns, undercurrents surged invisibly.\nHowever, since this area was within the Central Plains, where righteous forces flourished, no significant disturbances arose within the town.\nAll sect leaders and Innate elders only contended in the shadows, without openly displaying confrontations.\nThis unnamed town, to return to peace, would likely require a year and half of time, until all martial artists left in frustration after achieving nothing, it might gradually regain tranquility.\nSuddenly,\nas Zhang Feng led the Celestial Essence Sect members toward the inn, sneers and mockeries arose from the martial artists behind them, with hawkers selling goods all around and carts rumbling down the central road.\nAll appeared utterly calm when,\nat the inn of the unnamed town, a terrifying aura burst forth like thunder, several figures soaring into the air.\nBoom!!!\nThe void trembled, with expansive aura surging skyward, prompting a change in celestial secrets above, the oppressive aura swept across the entire world like a tide.\n\"Li Hu, three years ago you killed people of our Holy Sect, today our Sect Leader emerges from seclusion, we shall take your head to toast the Sect Leader!\"",

One might get lucky and learn some news.\nTherefore, he undertook his main trade and disguised as an innkeeper, dutifully working in the inn.\nAn inn is always a good place to gather information.\nAlthough Li Hu’s reputation is tremendous, the destruction of the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable with a single strike in Celestial Essence shook the entire Martial Arts world.\nBut in reality, very few in the Martial Arts community can recognize him by appearance.\nIn these three years, he has overheard others discussing him more than once,\nand little did those people know that the servant serving tea and sweeping the floor beside them was the sweeping master, the fourth Grandmaster famed throughout the world!\nWithin the inn, Li Hu continued his cultivation in seclusion while using his powerful Spiritual Power to eavesdrop on information.\nAs he expected, these wandering martial artists would always reveal some traces, and by comparing these clues and calculating on the map, Li Hu has roughly estimated the area of the valley perilous land reached by that lucky Hunter back then.\nThrough the Martial Arts Origin Scripture, Li Hu has already gleaned some of the mystical ideals of the Dao Ancestor and Martial Ancestor from ancient times, seeing the great paths they had walked through space-time.\nLi Hu is certain that,\nthe Martial Ancestor must have been a Celestial Human level expert,\nor even beyond!\nThat is the realm of the founding master of Martial Arts, a level never reached by any second person in history.\nTo create their own world and path, truly deserving of the title of ancestor.\nDuring these days of comprehending the Martial Arts Origin Scripture, although Li Hu has seen some of the mysteries above the Grandmaster realm in the Celestial Human Realm, he still lacks a stroke of Spiritual Mechanism to step into that Celestial Human Realm.\nHeavenly Stone.\nIn those years, during the Dao discussion between the Martial Ancestor and Dao Ancestor, a Heavenly Stone descended from the sky, which the Martial Ancestor comprehended for seven days and nights, thus founding the path of Qi Cultivation in Martial Arts.\nWhat Li Hu lacks, that missing stroke of Spiritual Mechanism, is the Heavenly Stone.\nNow that he has found a clue, Li Hu does not intend to wait any longer.\nEarly in the morning, he went to the market, negotiated a fair price with Wang, the vegetable delivery man, and purchased a batch of vegetables.\nPassing by a rice shop, he ordered three big bags of rice according to the shopkeeper’s instruction.\nHaving completed these menial tasks, on his way back he encountered Zhang Feng and his entourage from the Celestial Essence Sect.\nThis was Li Hu’s first encounter with Zhang Feng.\nWhen he was secluded for cultivation in the Library of the Celestial Essence Sect back then, Zhang Feng’s name was well-known, but he hadn’t seen him much face-to-face.\nSeeing that scene on the long street,\nLi Hu paid no mind, nor did he linger, he directly moved on.\nWith the affairs of this body, that strike from years ago has already fully repaid everything.\nThe crowd from the Celestial Essence Sect did not know that among the dense crowd, the person they were discussing was just brushing past them.\nReturning to the inn, after preparing all of today’s work, Li Hu intended to quit his job with the innkeeper.\nThe innkeeper pleaded with him to stay repeatedly, for someone like Li Hu, who worked diligently without pay, was always beneficial to the inn.\nBut Li Hu had already made up his mind,\nnot just to explore the remnants left by the Martial Ancestor in the Wilderness Forest, seeking that Heavenly Stone.\nMore so because these days, his Spiritual Sense told him some trouble was coming for him.\nLi Hu does not fear trouble, but he hates it, hence he prepared to leave.\nHowever, what was meant to come could not be avoided.\nWith a declaration resonating through the sky, three Grandmaster Level auras bloomed in the sky, sweeping like a tsunami in all directions, stirring up violent tempests.\n\"Die!!!\"\nA dark star, accompanied by an aura as sharp as a master, suddenly descended from the sky, swirling into a fierce gale over the entire long street, countless razor-sharp fragmented energies like a Milky Way waterfall crashing down from the heavens!\nAt the same time,\nA figure whose appearance on the long street went unnoticed detonated the energy under its feet like a bomb, the ground shattering with a roar, debris splintering outward in all directions, and the entire figure transformed into a gray lightning bolt with sheer formidable energy sprinting forward.\nAt the same moment, a soft hand unexpectedly broke through the void, coming forth mightily, the currents of air all around drawn by its True Qi, undulating unpredictably like the tides, layers of power piling up, crashing towards Li Hu’s back.\nThe three appeared so quickly, their attack arrived too hastily,\nIn a blink, from above, in front, and behind, the three deadly strikes closed off all space for Li Hu to evade.\n\"That is... Grandmasters! A siege by three Grandmasters!\"\nIn a flash, as the three unleashed their overwhelming momentum, all the martial artists present turned pale in shock.\nEvery Grandmaster is an exceptional master of great rarity in the Martial World, capable of founding their sect and dominating a region.\nYet today, three Grandmasters unexpectedly appeared together to strike?!\nIn an instant, their combined deadly strike had reached Li Hu, leaving him nowhere to escape, nowhere to hide!\nLi Hu stood there in a daze, seemingly unable to react, as if resigned to his fate.\nThe three figures, in that moment, revealed vicious smiles on their faces, they had planned and laid ambush here for a long time, their concentrated killer move was impactful even for a Grandmaster to endure.\nTo use Grandmasters to counterattack a Grandmaster, achieving an almost nonexistent feat in the history of the Martial Arts, was about to occur at their hands!\n\"I have no intent to kill others, why then do they come courting death?\"\nThe eerie voice reached their ears, before they could react,\nSuddenly,\nThe person before them \"disappeared\"!\nNot in the literal sense of vanishing, for his figure was still right there, but at that moment, he became nonexistent, became nothing.\nThe void was profound, formless, and shapeless.\nHis entire strength seemed to plunge into the endless void.\nLi Hu’s entire being seemed to vanish from the world, though his figure was clearly in sight, it was as if he had disappeared between heaven and earth.\n\"Not good!\"\nThe trio became greatly alarmed in their hearts, a sense of extreme danger loomed above them.\nHowever, there was no time to change their move.\nA palm descended, as if hitting the void.\nTheir whole existence seemed to disappear from the world, though his silhouette was right before their eyes, yet it seemed as if he had vanished from the realms.\nAssembling all the strength of a Grandmaster’s full strike, vast and grand force instantly dispersed.\nVaguely, before their eyes, a yin-yang shadow loomed, and the next moment,\nBoom boom boom!\nAn even more terrifying, indescribable force struck their chests, as if heaven and earth collapsed, earth’s fire erupted, tides surged...\nThe three Grandmaster-level experts, with even faster speed, were knocked back, like cannonballs crashing heavily into buildings, collapsing several houses with a boom.",

Boom! Boom!\nThe continuous rumble shook the entire town. Large areas of houses collapsed, and dust and wood chips swept up, creating a whirlwind on the street like a tsunami, as if a mountain flood was pouring down the street.\nIn a flash, before everyone could react, the overwhelmingly strong three streams of energy had already been blown away and defeated.\nCountless Martial Artists gathered there were shocked and scattered like headless flies, screaming and fleeing in panic.\n\"A Grandmaster battle! Who is that young man?!\"\n\"Li Hu, the Grandmaster who appeared at the Celestial Essence Sect three years ago! Those three are the four Demon Venerables of the Demon Sect? They were defeated so quickly!\"\n\"Indeed, three years ago, when the sweeper Li Hu appeared and killed the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable with one palm, he became famous throughout the land. The Demon Sect is here for revenge this time!\"\n\"Earlier, that Demon Venerable said the Demon Sect Leader has emerged. Is the martial world about to be thrown into chaos again?\"\nOne after another, the Martial Artists felt the explosive surges of energy and fled in all directions, looking fearfully at the distant place where dust and smoke rose into the sky.\nHeart Spirit!\nThe sudden outbreak of battle and the explosive energy scattered Martial Artists within a hundred meters, sending them flying, spitting blood, and getting injured.\nThe power of a Grandmaster battle, with energy waves affecting dozens of yards away!\nBut the sweeper was clearly more terrifying as, under the combined attack of three Grandmasters, he resolved this deadly offensive with ease and dealt a heavy blow instead!\nSeverely wounding the three Demon Venerables in one move, Li Hu showed no sign of joy on his face.\nStanding quietly in place, his gaze deep.\nLooking at the empty street ahead, as if trying to see a flower there.\nThe air was silent, and no one around dared to make a sound.\nSuddenly, the sun in the sky seemed to stretch infinitely, and the distance of space became extremely vast.\nAt that moment, all the colors of the world seemed to gather on Li Hu, a profound and mysterious atmosphere spread, like dust entering everywhere, infecting the mind of every Martial Artist present.\nAfter an unknown amount of time, a calm voice suddenly echoed in the air.\n\"Demon Sect Leader Jue Wutian? Aren’t you planning to make a move yet?\"\nThe tone was calm, without a ripple.\nAs that voice spread, it was like a stone dropped into a calm lake, breaking the mirror-like stillness, and the Martial Artists around finally woke up from that vast and serene atmosphere.\nOnly at this moment did everyone realize with shock,\nThe Grandmaster’s casually emitted aura had infected and assimilated their Heart Spirit in that instant!\nMany people were astonished, their expressions changing, quickly backtracking several dozen yards to avoid being affected by that terrifying Grandmaster’s aura again.\n\"Hahahaha!\"\nSuddenly, a thunderous laughter came from the sky, like a clear sky explosion, terrifying energy rippled from the distance, making every Martial Artist in the nameless town feel as if they had fallen into a dark abyss.\n\"Senior Brother....\"\nOn a distant street, among the travelers of the Celestial Essence Sect, a young woman in purple was pale, feeling a terrifying tremor descending from the sky above.\n\"Don’t be afraid, his target is not us, let’s leave!\"\nLooking at the dimming sky in the distance, Zhang Feng was also shocked.\nUnlike his juniors and juniors, with his mid-Innate cultivation, he could already feel the vast energy surging from the high sky, like a black sun falling from the sky, creating an overwhelming aura!\nJust the residual wave alone made him feel an inescapable terror!\nZhang Feng clearly felt that if he faced that vast aura, he might not even dare to draw his sword before being easily crushed by its owner.\nGrandmaster!\nThis is a Grandmaster,\nA casually emitted Heart Spirit that infected over half the Martial Artists in the town with its aura.\nThe other hasn’t even arrived, yet the overwhelming pressure has dimmed the sky.\nThis is the power at the pinnacle of Martial Arts!\n\"Let’s go!\"\nZhang Feng, along with his juniors from the Celestial Essence Sect, quickly flew away, while Martial Artists in the nameless town also scattered like birds and beasts, rapidly fleeing the town.\nThis place is about to become a Grandmaster’s battlefield!\nRumble!\nAs the Martial Artists fled in all directions, a muffled thunder sounded from the sky, and overlapping dark clouds unknowingly covered the entire sky, veiling the daylight, making the area instantly dark and deep, as if excluded from the world.\nUnder the dark clouds, everyone inexplicably felt a fear, as if facing an impending apocalypse, an invisible pressure almost driving them insane.\n\"Grandmaster! Grandmaster!\"\nAn old Martial Artist shouted madly, eyes wide, witnessing the scene of the changing sky before him.\nThe surrounding crowd fled in panic, a chaotic scene.\nThe old Martial Artist knelt toward the sky covered by dark clouds, arms stretched wide, appearing prominently.\n\"Hearing the Tao in the morning, I would die content by evening! Grandmaster, ah, Grandmaster!\"\nHe shouted, tears streaming down his face.\nAccording to legends, when Martial Arts reaches its peak, it can alter heaven and earth, shatter mountains, and break ridges.\nA lifetime of practicing Martial Arts seemed futile, but ultimately he could witness the resplendent Realm he pursued all his life before dying.\nInstantly he sobbed with tears and mucus.\nCrash! Crash!\nUnder the gloomy sky, a figure like a dark meteor fell from the heavens, absorbing the surrounding light, making half the sky darken.\nThe overwhelming darkness swept in all directions, revealing the figure like a demon bringing a dark abyss to the world.\n\"Are you Li Hu, who ascended to the Grandmaster Realm three years ago?\"\nThe figure of the Demon Sect Leader, Jue Wutian, appeared high above like a dark overlord, looking down on Li Hu on the ground with indifferent eyes, as if looking at a dead person.\n\"Correct, reaching the pinnacle of Martial Arts at your age, you are qualified to stand in the same position as me. However, you shouldn’t have, under any circumstances, dared to touch my people!\"\n\"You should take your own life.\"\nThe tone was filled with undeniable divine authority.\nClearly words condemning someone to death, yet filled with an order from on high.\nSilence, no sound.\nLi Hu stood there, a calm expression on his face.\nThe surrounding space was silent.\nLi Hu didn’t speak, and Jue Wutian remained high above without a word.\nAfter a long time,\n\"Forget it, I see you are not one to willingly die, so I’ll reluctantly send you into Reincarnation instead.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 345: Chapter 016 Netherworld Divine Skill\nIf this Martial Arts World is a world within a novel, then the experience of the Demon Sect Leader Jue Wutian is a history of Long Aotian’s growth.\nAs the only son of the previous generation’s Demon Sect Leader, he attracted the attention of the entire Martial World as soon as he was born, and his Martial Arts aptitude could be called heaven-defying.\nAt five years old, he started Qi Cultivation; at ten, he had reached the pinnacle of the Postnatal stage; by twenty, he had already advanced to the Realm of a Grandmaster.\nIn the Central Plains Martial Arts, the Sword Young Master, who was called the number one genius of the younger generation a few years ago, was actually nothing compared to the previous generation’s Jue Wutian, only because the orthodox path of Central Plains was flourishing, they deliberately concealed Jue Wutian’s shocking talent, thus Sword Young Master was in the dominant position.\nSince the age of thirty, Jue Wutian roamed the Martial World, unbeaten, advancing to the status of a Grandmaster with an invincible aura.\nLater, the Demon Sect marched north on a large scale, facing off against the current top martial artist in the world, the elderly Celestial Sword, over Dongting Lake.\nIt was then that he experienced the first defeat of his life.\nEven so, no one dared to underestimate him.\nEveryone knew that with Jue Wutian’s formidable talent and youthful advantage, surpassing the elderly Celestial Sword to become the number one martial artist in the Martial World was only a matter of time.\nSince his defeat at Dongting Lake, Jue Wutian secluded himself in the forbidden grounds of the Demon Sect, and it has now been ten years.\nNo one knows to what extent Jue Wutian will reach upon re-emerging after ten years.\nBut it can be confirmed that Jue Wutian’s return will surely unleash a catastrophe upon the Central Plains Martial Arts!\nAn invincible path has endowed Jue Wutian with an invincible nature.\nPerhaps in the eyes of others, Jue Wutian’s actions are arrogant and overbearing, but in his own eyes, he sees it as a matter of course.\nLetting a Grandmaster commit suicide may seem absurd to others, but he truly believes so.\n\"Or perhaps you’ve reached the peak of the Martial Arts and think you can contend with me, then let me show you that there’s a huge difference even between Grandmasters!\"\nWith an indifferent tone, Jue Wutian slightly raised his palm and waved gently toward Li Hu.\nBOOM!!!\nAccompanied by a deafening explosion, a pitch-black vortex suddenly appeared above Li Hu, devouring everything around it like a black hole.\nAll the myriad lights were swallowed in, and the entire space dimmed, as if the vacuum had collapsed.\nNetherworld Devouring Heaven!\nWhoosh!\nAs if a huge hole collapsed in the ocean, countless air surged like tidal waves, the surrounding houses collapsed, and wood and stone thrown into the air were swept into it like a flood.\nThe black hole, with a diameter of several meters and infinite might, plummeted toward Li Hu!\nThe surrounding void seemed to solidify at this moment, and the incomparably powerful force acted on Li Hu, making him feel as if he was fixed in place, unable to move, only able to watch as the black hole in front of him engulfed him.\n\"Netherworld Divine Skill! The highest sacred law of the Southern Demon Sect, the Netherworld Divine Skill!\"\nMartial Artists who fled far away looked toward the direction of the small town, seeing the twisted void and dimmed light, as if a vortex of black sun manifesting vacuum, even their sight and Divine Soul seemed to be absorbed into it, looking shocked.\n\"Rumor has it that when the Netherworld Divine Skill is cultivated to the Twelfth Layer, it can devour the vacuum, drawing all things into the Netherworld Reincarnation, but wasn’t that only fictional in theoretical inference? Could it be that Jue Wutian has already cultivated the Netherworld Divine Skill to the Twelfth Layer?!\"\n\"It must be, I saw with my own eyes the duel between Jue Wutian and Celestial Sword ten years ago, at that time Jue Wutian’s Netherworld Divine Skill definitely hadn’t been this powerful!\"\n\"It’s over, that janitor is sure to lose; the Twelfth Layer of the Netherworld Divine Skill, perhaps in the entire Martial Arts World, only the Celestial Intent Swordsmanship of the elderly Celestial Sword, with the Hongtian Sword, could resist, but the janitor has only been a Grandmaster for three years, how could he withstand it.\"\n\"What a pity, if the janitor were given another ten years with his astonishing talent, he might have been able to contend with Jue Wutian in the future, but acting imprudently today is leading to his downfall.\"\nA veteran Grandmaster outside the small town with insight spoke.\nThis time, the Martial Ancestor ruins have emerged, a mingling of dragons and serpents, with even a veteran Grandmaster who had been reclusive for a long time appearing here.\nAs an elder in the Martial World, of course, he knows some deeper truths.\nThe origin of the Netherworld Divine Skill is mysterious, possessing all sorts of incredible divine powers. In the battle at Dongting Lake years ago between Celestial Sword and Jue Wutian, it was because of unfamiliarity with the Netherworld Divine Skill that Celestial Sword suffered considerable losses.\nBack then, Jue Wutian’s Netherworld Divine Skill was at the Eleventh Layer and was already like this. When it reaches the Twelfth Layer, perhaps the only martial technique in the Martial Arts World that can contend with it would be the Celestial Intent Swordsmanship of the elderly Celestial Sword.\n\"What a pity, if Li Hu had fled from the start, he might have escaped with his life, but now it’s a dead end, and after the elderly Celestial Sword is gone, who will be Jue Wutian’s rival?\"\nLooking at the dimly lit wind-stirring vortex of the black hole in front of him, the veteran Grandmaster couldn’t help but frown, as if he already saw a future where the Central Plains Martial Arts plunged into great calamity.\nFacing the dark void above, which even swallowed the vacuum, a glimmer flashed in Li Hu’s otherwise calm eyes.\n\"Twelfth Layer of Netherworld Divine Skill? Interesting...\"\nA few years ago, he traveled the world, collecting various Martial Arts to strengthen his own foundation.\nWith his powerful Spiritual Power and various methods, the Divine Skill Secret Manuals of different sects were completely unguarded; entering various Scripture Pavilions and secret territories was as if entering an uninhabited land, unnoticed by anyone.\nThis included the Southern Demon Sect as well.\nThe Netherworld Divine Skill was long backed up in his mind.\nAt that time, he even spent some time studying it.\nAlthough not practiced, some essential Techniques within that skill gave him quite a bit of inspiration.\nWithout mastering it, one naturally doesn’t grasp its true mysteries.\nFurthermore, the Twelfth Layer of the Netherworld Divine Skill only exists in theoretical imagination.\nFrom the black vortex unleashed by Jue Wutian, Li Hu vaguely perceived a sense of shattering space.\nIt couldn’t really be considered space-shattering, but the technique of devouring all things, concentrating power at an extreme point to achieve a space-devouring technique, greatly enlightened him.\n\"A very fine technique, among the top tier in Martial Arts history, but alas...\"\nIn a low murmur, Li Hu stopped hesitating and suddenly took action.\nIn an instant, like a burst of Celestial Intent, myriad flows converged!",

What martial art is this!!!\"\nHidden among the crowd, several grandmasters were horrified, their eyes revealing a look of terror.\nMartial artists around stood in place, mesmerized by the mystical aura, gazing into the distance with a look of intoxicated fascination on their faces.\nEven those at the Innate Level could not escape the infection on their divine soul spiritual mechanism.\nOnly those few grandmasters who broke into the Innate Realm could barely stir their aura to resist the invasion from the Daoist technique’s divine soul, barely maintaining a clear spirit.\n\"Retreat quickly!\"\nSeveral grandmasters were utterly terrified, retreating repeatedly, withdrawing a hundred feet before stopping at a high place where the nameless small town was the size of a grindstone, watching in fear the sky darkening beneath the clouds.\nIt is said in legends that those who reach the pinnacle of martial arts possess the power to change the day and night.\nAs it stands now, although not truly having the ability to change the day and night, just the mere aftermath of the energy from battle holds power akin to immortal gods!\nAt this moment, within the small town,\nspace swayed, swinging rapidly like a mirror, the entire nameless small town collapsing into ruins after successive waves of energy rampage.\nRumble!!!\nA world-shaking collision suddenly erupted, layers of air currents surged skyward, raising clouds of dust and debris, sweeping outward in all directions.\nThe grandmasters watching from afar saw the small town before them suddenly erupt into a tsunami at that moment, visible waves of energy spreading around, houses collapsing like a mountain torrent forming a tidal storm, pouring past the ruins.\nEven at a distance of hundreds of feet, the grandmasters could feel the power of the powerful energy whistling around.\nBut in the small town, the surrounding void twisted under the collision of two mighty and terrifying energies, like a mirror.\nThe void swayed, dreamlike and illusory.\nJue Wutian’s Heart Spirit became serious in this moment as well.\nThe strength of this youth likely has but a small gap from himself.\n\"I didn’t expect you could reach this step, and your martial arts are also quite extraordinary..\"\nThough it was just a probing exchange, he had already felt the prowess of this youth named Li Hu before him.\nOriginally, having broken through the Twelfth Layer of the Netherworld Divine Skill, confident of being invincible in the world, Jue Wutian had to admit.\nIn a life-and-death struggle, this person before him might inflict injuries on him during their desperate final fight.\nThis was not part of his plan.\nSoon, he was to challenge the Celestial Sword Elder again to avenge the shame of defeat years ago.\nDespite his confidence in the power of his Twelfth Layer Netherworld Divine Skill, dealing with a grandmaster suppressing the martial world for decades, he must be in a complete state, at least.\nThis youth in front of him is, after all, an incidental person. While confident in slaying this fellow, in a desperate fight, he might not retreat unscathed.\nAfter some time, after killing the Celestial Sword Elder, wouldn’t he have time to deal with this guy?\nHis gaze flickered as he weighed it in his heart, and Jue Wutian calmly said:\n\"Apparently, being able to kill Cyan Dragon with one palm wasn’t just luck; I acknowledge your strength.\"\nDespite saying so, Jue Wutian’s tone remained arrogant.\n\"Among the billions in the martial world, grandmasters are few and far between, the fall of one is ultimately a great loss to the martial world, so why should we engage in a life-and-death struggle? If you and I join forces, we could sweep the entire Central Plains Martial World, standing high among billions of beings, wouldn’t that be better?\"\nLi Hu, noncommittal, said indifferently:\n\"What if I say no?\"\nSilence, with not a sound in the air.\nA supremely oppressive killing intent spread, the space seemed to freeze at that moment.\nFor a long time, Jue Wutian looked down at Li Hu with an indifferent gaze.\n\"Those who follow me prosper, those who oppose me perish, refuse, and then die!\"\nThe words were spoken plainly.\nBut filled with an undeniable implication.\n\"How about it?\"\nLi Hu raised his head, with a brilliant mysterious light shining in his pupils.\nAt that moment, his entire presence surged like a volcanic eruption, as if the rhythm of heaven and earth descended upon the mortal realm.\nA cold voice resonated between the void.\n\"No matter, join forces or not, dominate the martial world or not, it matters not to me, I just want to beat you to death now!\"\nHaving grown utterly weary of Jue Wutian’s attitude, Li Hu was too lazy to speak further.\nTo deal with such an all-encompassing, self-important Long Aotian, the best way is with fists.\nOnly force is the real truth!\n\"Very well! Since you seek death, then I shall fulfill you!\"\nJue Wutian showed neither sorrow nor joy, his whole body’s energy suddenly burst forth like wind and thunder, like a tsunami, suddenly covering hundreds of feet radius of the void.\nThe grandmaster-level energy resonances immediately altered the weather, bringing on howling black winds, as if the Netherworld Ghost Land had descended to the mortal world.\n\"To kill you, one move is enough!\"\nJue Wutian’s expression was calm, spreading his hands wide.\nThe black wind grew fiercer, as if malevolent ghosts howled between heaven and earth, the sunlight above entirely obscured by clouds, fell into a gloomy domain.\nBoom!!!\nWith a roar, the Netherworld Divine Skill erupted inside, his palms suddenly manifested clusters of black void whirlpools, slowly rotating, tearing and devouring even the void.\nAn incredibly pure darkness, like a black hole, swallowed all the surrounding light, engulfing all radiance of the world, as if expelling this realm from existence.\nNetherworld Devouring Heaven!\nRustle!\nThe black vortex rapidly expanded, spreading out in all directions.",

Just the emission of their aura stirred the Celestial Secret Aura violently like tidal waves, sweeping across a hundred zhang, as if drawing that entire space into a dark abyss.\nThe space was torn and twisted, like a massive void opening in the sea, immense air rushing in like surging tides, and within it, unimaginably terrifying power was coalescing.\nNetherworld Devouring Heaven, one of the supreme techniques of the Twelfth Layer of Netherworld Divine Skill, is said to possess the ability to devour the heavens and earth, bringing the dark Netherworld down to the mortal realm.\nThis move was originally Jue Wutian’s trump card against the Elder of the Celestial Sword.\nBut now, to kill Li Hu without damage, Jue Wutian had no choice but to use this technique he had prepared for ten years.\n\"Just right, use the blood of a Grandmaster to consecrate the birth of Netherworld Devouring Heaven!\"\nJue Wutian’s face showed a ruthless expression,\nonly to see his hands come together, and the two void vortex black holes merged into one, transforming into a massive black hole several zhang in diameter.\nAs if a black sun descended upon the human world, the void trembled.\n\"Go!\"\nAs Jue Wutian pressed downwards, that vortex of black hole, seemingly devouring everything in the world, fell towards Li Hu with a roar.\nThe surrounding void violently shook and swayed, countless spaces stretched and compressed, surging towards that black sun.\nThe nearby space seemed to solidify at this moment, powerful forces acting on Li Hu, as if trying to swallow both him and the surrounding void into that deep black hole.\n\"Netherworld Divine Skill, practiced to the extreme, can produce such changes, perhaps...\"\nSome thought flashed through his mind.\nThe next moment, a vast aura surged from his body, carrying an ethereal, otherworldly aura, stirring the entire world’s void.\n\"For Thunder, it is the pivot of heaven and earth...\"\nA light chant, a clear voice echoed in the void, the aura around him woven with the mysterious forces of heaven and earth.\nYin-Yang Qiankun: Thunder Heavenly Punishment!\nBOOM!!!\nAn arc of lightning, stretching several hundred zhang, suddenly flashed between the dark clouds above, tearing through the sky, as if opening a rift in the void. From within exploded countless lightning sparks, merging with the heavenly aura, immediately transforming into bolts of lightning erupting in the void.\nThunder and lightning, this majestic power of heaven and earth, at this moment, was actually summoned and used by Li Hu!\nIn the Main World, Li Hu was already a master of thunder, having awakened the Thunder Law Origin within the Giant Dragon, adeptly using various Thunder Magics. His comprehension of thunder had reached a very profound level.\nIn this world, though there was no fundamental existence of Magic Power,\nbut the deep understanding of Thunder Power and some application of Thunderbolt Power, in essence, were connected.\nLi Hu, through refining and evolving certain extraordinary Thunder Attribute techniques from the martial world for his own use, drew upon the pivot of heaven and earth, creating this Grandmaster Level pinnacle technique of commanding thunder and rendering divine punishment with unfathomable might.\nZIZLA!\nCountless electric lights gathered in the void at this moment, transforming into a sword containing myriad thunders, as if a star river of devastation!\nWhen that Thunderbolt Divine Sword appeared in the void, it stirred the Celestial Secret Aura between heaven and earth, turbulent like a tide, roaring as if earthfire surged, boiling up.\n\"Commanding thunder? Mastering the might of heavenly punishment with human power, how is this possible?!!!\"\nFrom afar, martial artists, left in an extremely disheveled state by the previous impact, widened their eyes in shock.\nThat Thunderbolt Divine Sword stood suspended in the void, its brilliant light shining, electric arcs and sparks radiating in all directions, causing the firmament above to seem transformed into a sea of thunder, with bolts of lightning blooming, emitting roaring thunderous booms, and its blinding light illuminating the entire world.\n\"It is said that reaching the peak of martial arts, one possesses incredible powers akin to Immortals. The Martial Ancestor who founded martial arts once suppressed the world single-handedly, possessing divine might capable of shattering ten thousand armies with one hand. Previously thought to be mere myth, it now seems such abilities akin to Immortal Gods truly exist!\"\nEven strong Grandmaster-level experts under this awe-inspiring heavenly might felt no more significant than ants, capable of being obliterated with a wave of a hand!\nEven a Martial Arts Grandmaster could not withstand the might of a single stroke of thunderous divine punishment!\nAt the same moment, concealed within the massive black hole vortex, Jue Wutian also felt an inexplicable trepidation.\nWatching as the black hole vortex, with the power to devour void and earth, fell with a roar, Li Hu did not linger.\n\"Go!\"\nWith a distant point, the Thunderbolt Divine Sword suspended in the void in front swiftly thrust out.\nAs if traversing through space, wandering in the void,\nIn one moment it was before him, the next it appeared dozens of zhang away.\nIn the space, just a fleeting flash of disappearing light, the Thunderbolt Divine Sword, forged by thunder, brilliant as a star river, brought the awe-inspiring might of heavenly punishment, with a momentum capable of seizing the brilliance of heaven and earth, crashing towards the black hole vortex triggered by Netherworld Devouring Heaven.\nCRACK!\nAt that moment, the entire world seemed to split and collapse into two halves.\nAt the boundary, cracks in the void spread out, space appearing like glass with spiderweb-like fissures, crisscrossing and spreading.\nFrom afar, martial artists observing were already dumbfounded, deathly silent.\nThe space, unexpectedly shattered!\nWatching this scene unfold before his eyes, Li Hu’s gaze also radiated a dazzling brilliance, like reflecting a sun instantly lighting up.\n\"Shattered void...\"\nLi Hu murmured softly, already imprinting the scene before him into his formidable spirit.\nThen,\nhe decided to no longer hold back.\nRUSTLE!\nThe ethereal aura traversed the Cyan Nether, crossing the nine heavens and ten earths, majestic like a heavenly river, in an instant sweeping several li.\nAt this moment, Li Hu’s peak Grandmaster Level aura, fully blossomed.\nThe mighty aura surged into the firmament, stirring changes in winds and clouds, the sky dimming, as a shadow arose blocking all light from heaven and earth.\nLike a comet crashing into the atmosphere, shaking the land for several li, that incomparably strong wave of power struck the Celestial Secret Aura with unparalleled speed, violently shaking the entire world!\nThis power of aura far surpassed Jue Wutian!\n\"How is this possible!\"\nJue Wutian’s expression drastically changed, showing incredulous shock.\nThis was the first time during battle that his expression drastically shifted,\na once confident battle now suddenly turned disastrous, as if in an instant descended into ruinous peril!\nThis radiant aura erupting skyward, like a sun plummeting into rivers, clearly exceeded him both in quality and quantity!\nThis indicated, the opponent’s martial arts realm,\nsurpassed his own,\nby yet another level?!!!\nHow is this possible!\nThe lamb he initially thought could be casually slaughtered, in this moment unexpectedly transformed into a fierce tiger!\n\"This battle, ends here...\"\nIn the clear voice, Li Hu made his move.\nQiankun Heaven and Earth: Hongtian Dream!",

      "content": "Chapter 348: Chapter 019 Hongtian Dream\nSince the Gate of Truth underwent its mutation, Li Hu has been in this world for ten years now.\nIn ten years, with an exceedingly strong Spiritual Power, he has read through ninety-nine percent of the martial arts under heaven, merging ten thousand forms of martial arts into a single entity, forming Li Hu’s current Qiankun Dao above martial arts.\nQiankun, the universe, encompassing all life within it.\nThe one path of Qiankun is the road where all paths converge.\nAnd Hongtian Dream is the most brilliant crystallization condensed from Li Hu’s Qiankun essence, which embodies tens of thousands of martial arts in his being!\nThe mere initial stance is enough to send a chill straight into Jue Wutian’s heart, as if his heart was plunged into an icy cave, feeling boundless coldness surging into his mind!\nJue Wutian, bearing the name of being without heaven.\nIf heaven opposes me, I must defy heaven.\nOne can imagine the arrogance in his heart!\nYet at this moment, Jue Wutian felt an inexplicable surge of terror, an unprecedented fear. Even when facing the Celestial Sword Elder’s elusive intent in the past, he had only felt a significant threat, but never such heartfelt dread!\nWith Li Hu’s strike, an indescribable sensation descended.\nA clear, moon-like mysterious light emerged from the void, illuminating the sky for miles around.\nThe dust in the air, the whirling wind currents, the caterpillar on the treetop, the collapsing stones, the cocoon in the soil... everything was frozen in this instant.\nSpace-time stood still, and everything was fixed together, as if transformed into a solidified scene.\n\"What is that!!!\"\nEven martial artists hundreds of feet away were stunned in horror.\nSpace seemed to be compressed together, and countless details poured into everyone’s eyes. The leaves frozen in midair, the dust swirling around, the collapsing ruins, everything seemed to occur right in front of them. The influx of information almost caused everyone a splitting headache.\nThis was a spreading, pervading solidified world, a dead space.\nAll colors, all sounds, and all Life Force were stripped away in this moment.\nIt was incomprehensible, even unimaginable. Even if witnessed firsthand, one could not describe with words the bizarre scenes.\nIf earlier, Li Hu’s overwhelming aura stirred up the heavens and void, commanding the thunder and heavenly punishment, and using the laws of all things, such incredible methods might still be guessed based on one’s own martial arts foundation,\nthen the current heavenly immortal-like methods left even a Grandmaster with no basis for understanding, as if they were dreamlike, fantastical techniques only achievable in dreams.\nFearful, terrifying!\nAll the spaces and materials swept by the mysterious light felt as though they were being ensnared in a painting, that surreal sense of reality filled everyone’s eyes, blurring the line between illusion and reality, leaving people lost in this power.\nThe crowd watching from afar already felt an impending catastrophe from which they couldn’t escape, a calamity they couldn’t avoid.\nFacing this move directly, Jue Wutian felt an innate dread.\nHe could not block it!\nNot to mention the opponent’s martial arts cultivation was a whole tier above his own, this inexplicable and boundless method was utterly incomprehensible.\nHongtian Dream, a fleeting dream.\nThe surrounding void, all materials, were drawn into the fixed scene, then transformed into nothingness.\nLarge chunks of houses were solidified in the painting, a sense of existence had completely vanished, as if materials existing in reality were erased by an invisible hand, leaving only an immense and hollow scene!\nThis technique is already comparable to a Celestial Emperor and otherworldly power!\n\"Netherworld Devouring Heaven!!!\"\nAs that terrifying scene spread, Jue Wutian unleashed the most powerful force of his life.\nHow could he die here like this!\nIn his heart, whether or not Jue Wutian regretted the hunt this time was unknown to others, but now, Li Hu’s power far exceeded his imagination, leaving only the desperate struggle as his only sliver of hope!\nEndless power surged forth, creating a massive void vortex with immense attraction, even space seemed to be drawn in and absorbed.\nFar outside the small town hundreds of feet away, those martial artists below the Innate level were involuntarily drawn toward the dark vortex under this incomparable force.\n\"No! Retreat quickly!\"\nSome martial artists awoke in terror, scrambling to retreat.\nBut in their haste, dozens to hundreds of martial artists below the Innate Level were absorbed by that massive dark vortex, shattered into a mass of flesh mid-air, and swirled into the dark vortex of Jue Wutian.\nThe void trembled, rippling with black waves.\nThe black hole that devoured the Life Essence of dozens to hundreds of people grew stronger as if evolving into a black sun god wheel slowly rising from the ocean, devouring everything between the void!\nAt this moment, the fixed scene of Hongtian Dream had reached before Jue Wutian’s eyes.\nSplash!\nA sound as clear as flowing water echoed between the void, and that power which seemed to draw everything in reality into a Dream World had spread and enshrouded that massive black hole vortex.\nThe downfall had begun.\nThe black sun god wheel, which had gathered the Life Essence of dozens to hundreds of martial artists, was like falling into a black abyss. Under the dreamy mysterious light filled with surrealism, it slowly sank into virtual oblivion, drawn into the fixed solidified scene as if trapped in an endless dream.\nIn merely a few breaths, that black sun god wheel emitting terrifying waves had already sunk into the illusory dream, fixed in that solidified, illusory mysterious light.\nDespite the darkness and depth of the black hole vortex, anyone who saw it could sense it.\nIts power had already perished!\nBut ultimately, Jue Wutian’s desperate resistance played a role.\nAfter swallowing the black sun god wheel, the spreading mysterious light stopped at last, that supreme martial essence of Hongtian Dream had already expanded to its limit.\nTime stood frozen for a moment.\nThe next moment, the fixed space collapsed with a booming sound!\nThis was a collapse beyond verbal description, the world fixed in Hongtian Dream disappeared in large swaths, whether it was the crumbling ruins, the dirt and earth, or the surrounding trees, all vanished into oblivion like a dream collapsing.\nIn mere moments, that fixed world had vanished completely, as if someone used an eraser to wipe clean everything from the void scene.\nTransforming into a vast expanse of whiteness.\nThe unknown small town vanished entirely, leaving only a massive crater in its place.\nFortunately, during the previous series of battles, the people in the town had already scattered completely.\nOtherwise, they would have already been obliterated in the terrifying aftermath.",

      "content": "Chapter 349: Chapter 020 After the Battle\nOutside the nameless town, the air was deathly still.\nAll the martial artists around were staring blankly at the massive crater before them, mouths agape in shock, minds in a haze, feeling that everything that had transpired earlier had completely overturned the worldview of all the martial artists present.\nWhether it was Jue Wutian’s Netherworld Divine Skill at the twelfth layer or Li Hu’s command over the Celestial Punishment Thunder, drawing space into a void-like dream, it all made each martial artist feel the peak of martial arts and that unbelievable power.\nIf they hadn’t witnessed it with their own eyes, no one would have believed such mythical feats existed in this world.\nIf prior to this, someone had described the details of such a battle to them, they would have thought the person was a madman.\n\"Did he escape...\"\nAt this moment, hovering in the void above the massive crater, Li Hu’s body emanated ripples as his robe fluttered in the wind, like an immortal god descending upon the mortal realm.\nHis gaze swept indifferently across the empty void before him, where the Demon Sect Leader Jue Wutian had long since vanished, evidently having fled during the collapse of the Hongtian Dream that had drawn him into the illusionary realm.\nLi Hu had no intention of pursuing him.\nTen years ago, when he arrived in this world, Jue Wutian was a grandmaster and had already been defeated and gone into seclusion.\nAnd ten years later, he had reached the pinnacle of martial arts, with the Celestial Human Realm within sight, while Jue Wutian had only taken a small step beyond being a grandmaster.\nSuch a person posed no threat to Li Hu.\nOr rather, if at some point in the future, Jue Wutian could bring him some surprises, it would be even better.\nThis world had no path to shatter the void, and even the Dao Ancestor and Martial Ancestor who had opened up great paths had long since perished in the river of time.\nLi Hu may not have the immense talent needed to create a new path on his own.\nAt that time, he may need to rely on the geniuses of this world to test some of his martial arts.\nThus, Li Hu no longer lingered, his form rippling with visible waves as he gradually dissipated like ink dissolved in clean water.\nAt the original site of the nameless town, only that colossal circular crater remained, drawn into illusion by the Hongtian Dream, now collapsed and shattered into void.\nThe surrounding martial artists, gazing at the empty crater before them, felt as though they had woken from a grand dream.\n\"Jue Wutian’s strength has increased again, ten years ago, when he faced the Celestial Sword Elder with a single sword, he had not reached this level, this time it seems he has indeed broken into the twelfth layer of Netherworld Divine Skill, after ten years, he’s back in the martial world, probably to duel the Celestial Sword Elder once more.\"\n\"Indeed, the Netherworld Divine Skill at the twelfth layer is a realm of unprecedented and never-to-be-seen-again, truly worthy of the astonishingly talented Demon Sect Leader.\"\n\"But, he was defeated, defeated by an even more talented and monstrous figure.\"\n\"Yes, with such martial arts cultivation, even the Celestial Sword Elder might not be able to compare to that person, the title of the world’s number one is likely to change hands now.\"\n\"Let’s go, let’s go, what does this have to do with me? Being born in the same era as such a prodigious talent is really disheartening...\"\nAfter a while, whispers of astonishment filled the air among the surrounding martial artists.\nSome left in shame, some cautiously approached the crater to investigate, some stood dazed on the spot, eyes blank.\nThe reactions of everyone varied.\nBut no matter what, the battle between these two pinnacle figures of martial arts undoubtedly left a deep imprint in the hearts of every martial artist.\n...\nWithin just a few days, the massive battle outside Xiangyun City spread throughout the world.\nThis time, it was even more intense than Li Hu’s sudden appearance three years ago.\nBecause Li Hu’s opponent was the most feared nightmare of the Central Plains’ righteous martial arts — the Demon Sect Leader Jue Wutian!\nAlthough ten years ago, the Celestial Sword Elder defeated Jue Wutian on Dongting Lake, halting the Demon Sect’s northward invasion.\nBut anyone could see that compared to the already aging Celestial Sword Elder, who dwelled in the southern Demon Cave, the young and vigorous Demon Sect Leader Jue Wutian posed a greater threat.\nWithout the support of his cultivation, the Celestial Sword Elder would be nothing more than an old man in his twilight years.\nEven though he relied on deep cultivation for support, how much longer could he last?\nIn any case, it won’t be longer than Jue Wutian.\nAnd once the Celestial Sword Elder passes, in the Central Plains Martial Arts, who could uphold the banner of righteousness to withstand the Demon Sect’s offensive?\nFor the past ten years, the threat of the southern Demon Sect has been like a guillotine hanging overhead, ready to fall at any moment!\nJue Wutian’s name constantly preoccupied the Heart Spirit of the Central Plains’ righteous martial arts.\nThree years ago, when Li Hu suddenly emerged, many Central Plains martial artists viewed him as the successor of righteousness, a mainstay against the Demon Sect’s northern invasion, especially after he killed a Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable with one strike.\nUnfortunately, since that stunning appearance three years ago, Li Hu’s trail had completely vanished, as if he never existed in this world.\nSome believed Li Hu didn’t possess grandmaster-level combat power, and that the Cyan Dragon Demon Venerable’s death was merely a calculated assassination. Some think Li Hu had offended the Demon Sect, posing a huge threat, and was secretly killed by Jue Wutian during his seclusion.\nUnder such unforeseen circumstances, the battle outside Xiangyun City almost overturned everyone’s perception.\nNobody anticipated that, after ten years in seclusion, Jue Wutian would emerge, with an even greater martial arts cultivation.\nAnd even more unexpected, despite his significant increase in strength, Jue Wutian suffered an unprecedented defeat against Li Hu, forcing the proud Jue Wutian to flee in disgrace.\nThe details circulating from the battle, including the method of silently erasing an entire town from existence, made every martial artist who heard it feel like they were listening to a mythical story.\nIf not for the fact that many martial artists witnessed the battle firsthand, anyone would have considered it a madman’s delusion.\nEspecially when a certain old grandmaster present at a banquet got drunk, someone seized the opportunity to ask, and in drunken envy, the old grandmaster replied with a cryptic line: \"Heavens beyond heaven, people beyond people.\"\nThis comment further solidified the account of that battle.\nA once-in-a-decade battle sensationalized the world,\nfrom then on, the name Li Hu became known by everyone in the world.\nHe subtly surpassed the Celestial Sword Elder, being hailed as the world’s greatest master.\nHis exploits became a living martial arts legend in the mouths of wanderers in Jianghu.",

      "content": "Chapter 350: Chapter 021: Dao Rhythm\nLi Hu, who reappeared before the people of the Martial World, was as formidable as three years ago; whenever he took action, it would shock the entire world.\nThe Martial World was in turmoil because of the battle outside Xiangyun City, stirring countless undercurrents and storms.\nIt can be said that although Li Hu only appeared twice in the eyes of the people, each appearance stirred significant storms in the Martial World, gathering all worldly eyes upon him.\nAdmiration, melancholy, determination, everyone who heard of Li Hu’s deeds felt an endless stream of emotions within.\nHowever, the external storms had little influence on Li Hu, and he felt no need to pay attention.\nIt had been nearly ten years since he came to this Martial Arts World.\nIn ten years, he spent most of his time cultivating and reading, even when Zhang Feng, suspected to be the protagonist of the Celestial Essence Sect, appeared before him, he had no desire to participate in the \"plot\".\nAlthough he didn’t know what strange change occurred beyond the Gate of Truth, Li Hu was very clear that his coming to this world was only accidental, and he was just a passerby in the Martial World.\nHis foundation, his everything remained in the Main World.\nFrom beginning to end, his goal was to shatter the void, relying on the Gate of Truth above his soul to return to the body of the Giant Dragon.\nHaving defeated the mysterious Jue Wutian, Li Hu did not linger, directly delving deeper into the Desolate Mountain Range.\nAlthough Jue Wutian fled, he was severely injured by that strike, dead or heavily wounded, naturally without the strength or willingness to trouble Li Hu again.\nThere were no more obstacles on the way.\n\"Shattering the void, finally seeing a glimmer of insight...\"\nIn the lush forest, Li Hu traversed the dense woods, his vast Spiritual Power scanning around while pondering the gains from the previous battle with Jue Wutian.\nGreat gains indeed.\nAlthough he had records of the Netherworld Divine Skill, he had not cultivated it, naturally unaware of the true power after breaking through to the Twelfth Layer.\nThis battle with Jue Wutian not only allowed Li Hu to see another form of Martial Arts, but it also sparked more ideas.\nEspecially the collision of those two moves, which caused even the void to crack.\nThough far from breaking the void, it was like a tightly closed door revealing a slight crack, seeing a thread of insight.\nAt that moment, the Gate of Truth deep within his soul clearly stirred, the fierce worldly binding force slightly loosened, making Li Hu more certain that shattering the void was the method to return to the Main World.\n\"Devour, compress, the extreme of Power...\"\nSome thoughts that never existed before began to emerge from his mind.\nThis battle with the pinnacle of Martial Arts gave him particularly substantial insights.\nAt Li Hu’s level, progressing on his own path was difficult, the high-level opponents provided him with much inspiration.\n\"Significant gains, although not enough to immediately break the Grandmaster bottleneck and enter the true pinnacle of Martial Arts, the Celestial Human Realm, I already have a premonition that as long as I find that ancient mysterious stone, it will allow me to smoothly enter the Celestial Human Realm.\"\nBack then, the Dao Ancestor and Martial Ancestor discussed under Purple Bamboo Mountain.\nThe mysterious stone arrived through space-time, the Martial Ancestor studied it for seven days and nights, thus founding the Martial Arts of this world.\nIt can be said, all Martial Arts in this world originate from that mysterious stone.\nLi Hu held more than ninety-nine percent of the Martial Arts in the world, understood tens of thousands of Martial Arts Secret Manuals, comprehending most of the mysteries from start to end of Martial Arts Qi Cultivation.\nBut ultimately, he lacked that final thread, yet to achieve Perfection.\nThus, he stood before the Celestial Human Gate without progress.\nLi Hu knew clearly what he lacked, and where his opportunity to break the barriers lay.\nIf he could trace back to ancient origins, witness the first ray of Martial Arts glory, it would be the moment Li Hu achieved Martial Arts Perfection, breaking into the Celestial Human Realm.\nLi Hu traversed step by step among the mountains and forests on his journey.\nEach step was measured with precision.\nSpiritual Power scanned constantly around.\nTime passed in a flash, in the blink of an eye seven days and nights had passed.\nDuring these seven days and nights, Li Hu kept walking,\nwithout a moment of pause.\nNo need for sleep, food, water, nor rest.\nHis aura brimmed, ethereal like an Immortal, without a speck of dust.\nHe had a sense akin to those who feed on Qi and are immortal.\nMartial Arts reached divine precision, at his level, viewed as deities by ordinary people was not an exaggeration.\nFinally, at the end of the seventh night.\nAs dawn broke, Li Hu followed the guidance of the Celestial Secret and arrived at a cliff-enclosed valley.\nClouds shrouded it, towering cliffs!\nThis was likely the valley reached by the fortunate hunter who obtained the Martial Arts Origin Scripture.\nAccording to legend, the Martial Arts Origin Scripture recorded by Guan Yinzi was half destroyed by purple lightning, but its final whereabouts were not detailed.\nNow possessing the Martial Arts Origin Scripture, Li Hu’s keen eyesight recognized the possibility that the ancient manuscript might be the original struck by celestial lightning in Guan Yinzi’s hands.\nCombined with the hunter’s account, that place contained both the book and a peculiar stone.\nLi Hu speculated that after the Dao Ancestor and Martial Ancestor departed Purple Bamboo Mountain, Guan Yinzi, upon leaving with the Dao Ancestor, placed the damaged Martial Arts Origin Scripture beside the mysterious stone.\nChronicles of time, sea changes.\nThe Purple Bamboo Mountain had vanished without trace, the mysterious stone and Martial Arts Origin Scripture remained hidden within the layered mountains, coming into the world today.\n\"It should be here.\"\nFeeling the vibrant and eager Spiritual Mechanism within his body, Li Hu did not pause, stepping into the valley as though traversing the void.\nClean, serene.\nA lush purple bamboo stood, a small stream encircled it, making clear sounds.\nUnder the purple bamboo were two timeless mats, spotless as if time had frozen there.\nAnd atop the mats lay a stone filled with mysterious patterns, half buried in the soil.\nUpon entering the valley, Li Hu knew he had come to the right place.\nHere, it likely was the site where the Dao Ancestor and Martial Ancestor sat and discussed the Dao.\nAbove the mats, the stone filled with mysterious patterns was indeed that mysterious stone!\nThe entire valley was permeated with an enigmatic and indescribable aura of Dao and Celestial Secret.\nEven at the peak of worldly Martial Arts, Li Hu still felt an incomprehensible mystery in the face of this Dao essence.\nIt was this pervasive aura that allowed the valley to remain untouched by thousands of years, unchanged from yesterday.\n\"Celestial Human...\"\nLi Hu pondered,\nThe aura between voids not only made him feel his gaze traversing time-space, as if witnessing the image of two great Dao sages sitting and discussing the Dao in days gone by!",

      "content": "Chapter 351: Chapter 022: Advancement to Celestial Being\nThe Dao’s resonance has spread for millennia, still lingering and unchanged, preserving this unnamed valley through thousands of years.\nStanding here, Li Hu could almost see in a daze,\nthe scene of Dao Ancestor and Martial Ancestor sitting and discussing Dao thousands of years ago.\nThis kind of technique, as if engraved in time, made Li Hu recall a certain realm in the Main World—Epic!\nAccording to rumors, epic-level strong ones possess the ability to leave traces of their existence in time.\nThe realm of Martial Ancestor and Dao Ancestor is beyond Li Hu’s understanding, but the scene before him clearly holds the power of an Epic.\n\"Celestial Being....\"\nBack then, the Martial Ancestor and Dao Ancestor, their Martial Arts realm perhaps surpassed even Celestial Beings!\nYet, whether they are Celestial Beings or not, time flows on like this.\nAs thousands of years wash away, traces of those two ultimately disappeared from this world, lost in vast history.\nTime is vast, eternal life remains elusive.\nThis journey, who knows when it will reach its end?\nIf he is not of this world, once cultivation reaches the realm of invincibility, with no rivals in sight, will he still seek a path to climb even higher?\nAt that time, will he also have the question within:\nA lifetime of cultivation, for what purpose?\nWith a sigh, Li Hu casts away that fleeting feeling in his heart.\nThis emotion is the tribulation of the Dao heart naturally occurring when a martial artist cultivates to a certain realm.\nFacing the passage of time, witnessing friends and family eventually passing away, being alone at the peak, surrounded by unfamiliar faces, when the world no longer relates to him, a deep sense of loneliness will fill his heart’s every corner, dragging him into the abyss of death.\nIf one cannot emerge from this twilight state of mind, even if lifespan far from its limit, the soul would perish in the twilight.\nThus Li Hu arrived at the valley where once Martial Ancestor and Dao Ancestor discussed Dao, seeing the Dao resonance filling the space, triggering the Dao heart tribulation.\nHowever, compared to other martial artists in this world, Li Hu is not from this world.\nHe is more aware of the vastness beyond this world, its endless wonder, unable to fully explore even in a lifetime.\nMoreover, Li Hu’s foundation is not rooted in this world, but in the distant Main World where he spent massive effort.\nConsequently, the terrifying tribulation of the Dao heart for any cultivator only brings Li Hu momentary sadness, then vanishes.\nUnaware he passed a Martial Arts hurdle, Li Hu’s gaze gathers on the celestial stone ahead.\nThousands of years ago, it was this celestial stone descending that opened the Martial Arts path in this world.\nLi Hu stands firmly in place.\nAhead, suddenly divine patterns on the celestial stone begin to shine.\nIn a trance, it seemed to pull Li Hu’s spirit into a vast boundless heaven.\nAs if the Great Dao manifests,\nduring ten years in this world, the ten thousand volumes he’s read swiftly surface before his eyes.\nFrom Refining Essence and Qi begins the Martial Arts path, to wielding divine might at the Grandmaster pinnacle.\nIn his eyes, each unfolds without any secrets.\nTime, passing day by day.\nOn Li Hu, an indescribable transformation is taking place.\nIf someone were here, they’d see, upon entering the Deserted Valley, Li Hu’s energy was high but still within human scope.\nBut now, his aura and even his presence are like turning ethereal, blending into the earthly void.\nThe person is clearly before him, yet seems separated by a space, a world.\nAs if the person is gradually stepping to transcend beyond heaven and earth.\nOn the seventh day,\nthe sky is somber, rain falls steadily.\nBetween mountains, the clear sound of rain falling echoes.\nLi Hu stands in the Deserted Valley, slowly lifts his head, and opens the eyes closed for seven days and nights.\nThe star-like radiant eyes gaze at the sky as if reflecting the entire world.\nRustle!\nThe clear splashes sound, rain curtain rolls heavenward, as if obeying his command, daring not touch his face.\n\"No ancients seen before, nor followers after, thinking of the vast universe, alone evokes tears....\"\nSince the start of Qi Cultivation on the Martial Arts path, in thousands of years past, countless people have climbed the peak, but how many have broken through the summit spanning Martial Arts, reaching its limits?\nAt this moment, Li Hu’s aura has completed its transformation.\nThe rain in the sky stopped.\nThe clouds dispersed.\nThe rising sun floods the world with morning light.\nOn Li Hu, yin and yang, light and dark, right and wrong, all concepts seem to vanish.\nThis is the supreme Martial Arts realm, completely above all in the world.\nCelestial Being!\nAt this moment, all secrets in the river of Martial Arts are clear before his eyes.\nThis represents the most splendid blossom of Martial Arts in this world.\n\"Celestial Being, has completely reached the pinnacle of Martial Arts in this world.\"\nHenceforth, to Li Hu, in the Martial World whether Grandmaster or Postnatal Martial Artist, it holds no meaning.\nCelestial Being, akin to the spokesperson of the world’s heavens!\nLi Hu’s gaze reaches into the void, the void ahead extends infinitely, seemingly seeing through the limits of the world.\n\"On the Martial Arts path, Refining Essence and Qi, this is the road created by Martial Ancestor over thousands of years.\"\n\"This road reaches an end, no further shore.\"\n\"To shatter the void, I must rely on myself, create a new road to validate the Great Dao!\"\nThough, this

      "content": "Chapter 352: Chapter 023 Foundation Stone\nFive years later, deep within Jade Capital Mountain,\na secluded and expansive courtyard stood quietly amidst the vast, rolling mountains.\nJade Capital Mountain, the first among the five sacred peaks of the Central Plains, has long been the site of imperial sacrifices, imbued with the fortune of Heaven and Earth, its landscapes picturesque and its spiritual atmosphere harmonious, attracting many Daoist recluses for their cultivation.\nThis grand courtyard was established many years ago by a high-ranking noble as a place for peaceful retreat away from the mundane world.\nUnfortunately, after that noble’s family fell from grace, the courtyard naturally changed hands to others.\nFive years ago, a mysterious young man purchased this courtyard.\nMost of the original servants were given a sum of money and then dismissed, leaving only a few lonely or homeless ones to stay behind and manage some of the external affairs.\nSince this mysterious young man bought the courtyard, he has often stayed indoors, with no notable friends visiting, frequently secluding himself deep within the courtyard doing unknown things, forbidding anyone from venturing further inside, even the original servants could only clean the periphery.\nOccasionally, only an old Daoist from the nearby White Cloud Temple would come over for a friendly visit.\nThe behavior of the courtyard’s owner naturally stirred speculation among the nearby villagers.\nHowever, the owner has dealt fairly in the past when buying and selling vegetables and other goods, and unlike the oppressive scions in other places, he never harassed the common people, which was considered a blessing by the local villagers.\nOn this day,\ndeep within the courtyard, in a grand hall adorned with a Yin Yang Tai Chi Diagram and filled with Daoist aura, Li Hu sat cross-legged on a meditation mat, completing his practice and exhaling deeply.\nMist condensed into Sword Qi and shot out, seemingly slicing through the very void before dissipating slowly after a moment.\nIn front of him, a massive alchemy tripod stood at the center of the hall, its heat gradually dispersing to the surroundings.\nUpon lifting the lid, a rich fragrance of elixir wafted out, permeating every corner of the hall.\nAt the center of the alchemy tripod, several flawless, radiant pills hovered, exuding an alluring elixir scent.\nLi Hu took out a pill and swallowed it directly.\nWith the refinement of True Essence inside his body, the potent medicinal power spread out, replenishing a trace of the Primordial Qi he had consumed in an instant.\nDon’t underestimate this mere trace—in terms of Li Hu’s Celestial Human Realm, which is vast and seemingly infinite.\nIf it were an ordinary Postnatal Martial Artist, one pill would be enough to replenish the consumed Primordial Qi.\nEven for Innate, Grandmaster Level experts, the effect is remarkable.\n\"It’s finally done!\"\nPutting the pills from the alchemy tripod back into a jade bottle, he gazed at the fruits of his five-year labor in the palm of his hand, a smile of delight appearing at the corners of his mouth, his eyes filled with joy.\nUsing the Nourishing Yuan Pill as an aid during cultivation at least equates to ten days of effort.\nWith these pills that can substantially replenish a martial artist’s Qi, the speed of Refining Essence and Qi will increase by ten times or even dozens of times!\n\"The Moon Star Grass has been successfully cultivated, and with the Nourishing Yuan Pill derived from Moonwalking Grass, great things can be achieved!\"\nEven with Li Hu’s disposition, he couldn’t help but feel a stir of excitement at this moment.\nFive years ago,\nafter advancing to the Celestial Human Realm of Martial Arts, with no further progress, Li Hu began to seek the path to shatter barriers in this world.\nAfter much consideration, he decided to spread martial arts under heaven, to create a mystical immortal path based on martial arts.\nBut this path was not easy.\nFirstly, there were issues with this world itself.\nEver since the Martial Ancestor pioneered the martial path of Refining Essence and Qi thousands of years ago, no one has transcended the Celestial Human Realm to establish a new lineage, causing a fundamental advance in the world. This is not due to the lack of geniuses throughout Divine Land’s thousands of years but rather the restrictions of the world itself.\nRefining Essence and Qi means internal refinement, transforming essence into Qi.\nUnless one is an exceptionally talented genius able to harmonize essence and Qi, martial artists require substantial quantities of meat or medicinal materials to replenish the Primordial Qi they consume during Qi cultivation.\nOtherwise, excessive cultivation would lead to a depletion of bodily Qi, making the great path all the more elusive.\nLi Hu was able to advance from nothing to Grandmaster in just six years thanks to his powerful Spiritual Power, allowing him to fine-tune operations so that the Nourishing Essence Technique and Body Strengthening Skill complemented each other, drawing in Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi to replenish himself.\nEven so, during the early stages of Qi Refining, Li Hu more than once had to rely on the Celestial Essence Sect’s kitchen.\nIf it were anyone else, not to mention becoming a Grandmaster,\nit would be impossible to reach the Grandmaster Level in just six years without adequate resources, and Refining Essence and Qi would otherwise reduce a person to nothing.\nUnless one is a genius naturally blessed with rapid cultivation speed and martial arts comprehension, backed by a great power and supported by countless centuries-old medicinal materials, along with various pills to enhance power and other such advantages combined.\nOtherwise, a regular person practicing straightforward perseverance without rest would need at least sixty to seventy years just to break through to Grandmaster.\nThis timeline assumes continual training without rest; otherwise, these calculations should be doubled.\nConsidering all these stringent conditions, how many have met them in the thousands of years of martial arts history?\nThe scarcity of resources at the base, constraints on Refining Essence and Qi, have kept the number of high-end martial artists at a significantly limited range.\nIn the entire Divine Land martial world, each era produces no more than five Grandmasters, and even fewer than fifty at the Grandmaster Level.\nHistorically, every successful societal transformation has come from the bottom up, driven by a strong grassroots base, enabling active change.\nIn such scarcity of high-end martial power, how can Divine Land’s martial world enact a transformation or cause an evolution in martial arts, catalyzing a rise in the world?\nBecause of such restrictions, throughout thousands of years, even though many divine skills and brilliant ideas emerged in the martial world, they couldn’t spread due to the world’s limitations, fading into the river of time, unable to change martial arts development or push the world’s advancement.\nThe economic base determines the superstructure.\nWithout a solid foundation, even if Li Hu created more divine skills, even if he developed a mystical immortal path, what use would it be if no one can cultivate it to a profound realm?\nNot everyone is like Li Hu, who, wielding powerful bonuses, could ascend to Grandmaster Level with the simple Nourishing Essence Technique.\nWithout enabling individuals to cultivate some of his experimental cultivation techniques to high realms, how could Li Hu rely on the martial world to test the broken path he created?\nIt is precisely because of this, seeing this flaw in the martial world’s development history, that Li Hu decided to make a change.\nThe Star Moon Grass and Nourishing Yuan Pill were products of this decision.\nJust like the food chain in biology, only a vastly enriched primary producer base can sustain more life.\nStarting with the Star Moon Grass and Nourishing Yuan Pill, by significantly enhancing a martial artist’s ability to replenish the Qi consumed during Refining Essence and Qi from nature, by relying on elixirs to rapidly boost martial artists’ cultivation speed, it lays the foundation for martial arts to thrive and undergo transformation.\nAfter five years of effort, I have finally developed the cornerstone for changing the world today.",

      "content": "Chapter 353: Chapter 024 Elixir\nLi Hu stood up tall, his steps as if shrinking inches, and in just a few breaths, he walked into the inner courtyard.\nIn front of him, in this secluded clearing, a medicinal field had been opened up.\nOn it grew sparse and uneven plants, with leaves resembling the starry sky at night, the Star Moon Grass.\nThe servants were always forbidden from entering the inner courtyard.\nThis was because of the entire garden of Star Moon Grass.\nIt is the primary material for refining the Nourishing Yuan Pill, and also the key for Li Hu to change the Divine Land Martial Arts, elevating the Martial Hero World to a fantasy Xianxia world.\n\"Simply relying on the power of starlight and moonlight is ultimately not enough. We must find a way to concentrate the power of starlight and moonlight around here at night. Only then can the cultivated Star Moon Grass grow more luxuriantly. I wonder if, when the concentrated starlight and moonlight reach a certain level, it will produce the legendary Emperor’s Liquid.\"\n\"The transformation of plants cannot stop. Although the achievement of five years only successfully transformed the Star Moon Grass, other types of plants cannot be abandoned. I must try more, strive to transform more kinds of spirit medicine to provide for the development of alchemy...\"\nGazing at the sparse Star Moon Grass in front of him, Li Hu secretly calculated in his heart.\nFive years ago, Li Hu began to travel the world, searching for something that could change the world. After several years, he finally found it growing in the high mountain tundra of the freezing ice plateau in the southwest—a grass plant that absorbed starlight and moonlight, capable of replenishing a martial artist’s primordial Qi.\nLi Hu meticulously researched its growing environment, using methods as wondrous as a celestial being, akin to an earthly immortal, to catalyze its growth and gradually improve it, until it could finally grow in normal environments, and then brought it back to the Central Plains, naming it Star Moon Grass.\nIn the martial world, there were also martial arts secret techniques practiced by absorbing the power of starlight and moonlight. Back when Li Hu was sweeping and cultivating quietly in the Celestial Essence Sect’s library, he had also thought about a divine skill art based on the absorption of star moon energy.\nIf it were Li Hu’s previous material world, the light from stars and moons at night would naturally hold no energy.\nBut in this world, the Power of the Constellations truly exists. The starry sky above contains extremely vast energy. Although that energy is greatly consumed passing through layers of atmospheric protection, the mere trace that leaks out is enough to support the growth and reproduction of Star Moon Grass.\nThrough the transformation by Star Moon Grass, the violent Star Evil Energy scattered from above the nine heavens is converted into primordial Qi between heaven and earth, continuously strengthening the world’s foundation.\nUltimately, only with a sufficiently robust foundation can it sustain Li Hu’s plan to transform the martial hero world in his mind.\nIn the span of five years, Li Hu, using mysterious methods akin to celestial beings, both cultivated Star Moon Grass and integrated medical tomes from around the world, becoming proficient in the five energies of the human body, yin and yang operations, and exploring the method of using Star Moon Grass to concoct cultivation elixirs.\nThrough five years of exploration, Li Hu finally succeeded not only in cultivating Star Moon Grass that could survive in ordinary conditions but also in figuring out a fundamental alchemy dao technique.\nThe Nourishing Yuan Pill was the fruit of that successful experiment in alchemy.\n\"It’s just a pity that the cultivation of the Star Moon Grass still requires certain conditions and is somewhat difficult to breed. Moreover, due to the Star Evil Power being blocked by the atmosphere, it takes at least three years from planting to maturity, and it still needs further improvement.\"\n\"However, it is sufficient for now. Over these five years, I’ve also developed cultivation techniques of the fantasy Xianxia type that allow rapid advancement using the Nourishing Yuan Pill. It’s time to start laying the groundwork.\"\nHe has already completed the conditions needed to change the world.\nWhat remains is how to widely spread it across the world.\nAlthough Star Moon Grass and the Nourishing Yuan Pill are excellent, directly giving others the means to cultivate them is out of the question, as they might suspect ulterior motives behind such free benefits.\nSo the promotion requires careful planning.\n\"Perhaps, I should establish a sect?\"\nLi Hu frowned slightly. The thought of establishing a force in this world was something he really didn’t want to consider.\nForget it, he thought. Rest and consolidate the harvest of these past five years first. This matter can be revisited later.\nLi Hu put aside the worries in his mind.\nThen, the voice of a servant came from outside the courtyard:\n\"Young Master, the Baiyang Daoist from the White Cloud Temple is here to visit.\"\nWhite Cloud Temple stood not far from Li Hu’s secluded courtyard. Initially, that old Baiyang Daoist seemed very interested in Li Hu’s arrival. After a few casual visits, Li Hu discovered that this old Taoist had cultivated for most of his life, mastering various pharmacology and alchemy techniques, and thus was not stingy with their friendship.\nThough Li Hu’s fame in the martial world was widespread, he had only appeared in public two or three times. This world was not the same as the modern one full of information, where famous celebrities could upload a photo and become world-renowned, being recognized wherever they went. As a result, few in the martial world truly recognized him, let alone an old hermit like Baiyang.\nOf course, most critically, Li Hu was the only one in thousands of years to advance to the Celestial Human Realm, with power and divine prestige akin to a Martial Arts Celestial Emperor.\nWith such a gap in levels, if he chose not to show himself, others simply couldn’t recognize him.\nThough in daily life Li Hu was very restrained, reaching a realm of returning to simplicity, the divine couldn’t be gazed upon directly. If he chose to hide, no one under heaven could find him.\n\"Understood, go entertain him for a bit, and I’ll be there shortly.\"\nThe Baiyang Daoist was deeply versed in medicine and alchemy dao, though the elixirs he concocted were mostly potent pills and remedies for injuries, far from the Nourishing Yuan Pill, and even further from the alchemy technique Li Hu had founded after years of contemplation.\nNevertheless, both medicine and alchemy require not just talent but ample practice.\nThe practical experience of the Baiyang Daoist had provided much assistance to Li Hu.\nAnd through their mutual exchanges, the two had become friends.\nNow that his alchemy technique was established and Star Moon Grass successfully cultivated, Baiyang Daoist’s help was indispensable.\nA moment later, having tidied himself up, Li Hu emerged from the back hall.\nIn the hall, an old Taoist with white hair and beard was already seated in the guest seat.\n\"Haha, as soon as I entered, I heard the magpies chirping joyfully overhead and smelled a rich fragrance in the air. Did you have any gains today, my young brother?\"\nStroking his white beard, Baiyang Daoist greeted Li Hu with a smile upon his arrival.\n\"I knew I couldn’t hide it from your dog’s nose. This is the result of my years of research. Take a look.\"\nSaying this, Li Hu turned his hand over and took out the jade bottle from earlier, tossing it over to the Baiyang Daoist before sitting down to drink tea.\n\"This elixir has a nice aroma. Seems like you’ve had some significant gains recently!\"\nEven though the jade bottle had been sealed with beeswax, threads of fragrance still leaked out.\n\"Tsk, even knowing you’ve had a breakthrough recently, such things shouldn’t be casually thrown out. What if it breaks?\"\nWhile muttering, Baiyang Daoist opened the seal.\nImmediately, a rich aroma wafted out, and just by inhaling it briefly, he felt an impending breakthrough within his cultivation, which had stagnated for years.\n\"This is!!!\"\nThe serene expression on Baiyang Daoist’s face changed drastically in an instant.\nAfter all, he was an innately skilled martial artist, so what kind of elixir was this!!!\nJust a single whiff of its scent made him feel as if his bottleneck was loosening, on the verge of a breakthrough!",

      "content": "Chapter 354: Chapter 25: Dao Ancestor\nThe old Daoist Baiyang had spent his entire life crafting elixirs, and naturally, he had keen insight. The newly brewed nameless elixir before him was truly within the scope of a divine elixir.\nEven Shaolin Temple’s treasured Great Rejuvenation Pill couldn’t possibly compare to the terrifying effect of this elixir.\nIn a daze, the old Daoist Baiyang recalled when Li Hu arrived here five years ago.\nAt that time, his courtyard in the deep mountains began a massive relocation, and having cultivated for half his life, he suddenly had a feeling about this new neighbor being extraordinary. So, he took the opportunity of the other’s housewarming to deliberately establish a relationship.\nHe then discovered the young man was beginning to delve into the techniques of alchemy, which hit Baiyang’s interest.\nYou should know that in the Martial World, such skills are really not much appreciated by ordinary martial artists, considered as lowly, unrefined arts.\nBaiyang had cultivated for half his life with a honed proficiency in alchemy, a skill more or less known only to himself on regular days. Now, with the sudden appearance of a kindred spirit, how could he resist? Driven by his heart’s inclination to teach, he couldn’t help but guide and engage in exchanges.\nThe friendship between the two was thus established.\nOld Daoist Baiyang knew this young man had great talent in alchemy because, within half a year’s effort, he had exhausted all of Baiyang’s half-life alchemy experience and was basically untaughtable, even being able to teach in return.\nBut no matter how talented, there must be some degree of limit, right?\nThe elixir in his hand—how could this be possible!\nThis is definitely an entirely new elixir, a recipe that could change the entire Martial Arts world!\nWithin just five years, how could this young man have reached such a level?\nThe old Daoist Baiyang fell into a trance, with a feeling akin to being the waves behind the Yangtze River, crashing upon the waves before, washed ashore on the beach.\nNow, he no longer understood the world.\nFirst, there appeared the once-in-a-millennium peerless demonic genius Jue Wutian, and then the overwhelmingly brilliant Grandmaster Li Hu.\nDespite a lifetime of cultivation, he and others were no match even for a single finger of this youth.\nNow even his most skilled artistry, alchemy, was overshadowed by this young man from God-knows-where.\nHe was old, truly old.\nIn his heart, the old Daoist Baiyang sighed continuously.\nThe complexity in the old Daoist’s heart was naturally unknown to Li Hu.\n\"This bottle of elixir is a gift to you, old Daoist. I also have a compendium of new alchemy techniques I’ve organized over the past five years for you, as thanks for your care to me during this time.\"\nSaying this, he took out a booklet and handed it to the old Daoist Baiyang.\nThe old Daoist Baiyang solemnly received it, composed himself, and couldn’t resist flipping through it.\nAfter a while, he closed the booklet, his face full of amazement.\n\"Extraordinary talent! You intend to forge a new path of alchemy. In the future, the Martial World will surely witness the rise of a new lineage of Pill Sect!\"\nCompared to the old Daoist’s method of using firewood to craft elixirs, the alchemy basics in this book seemed almost miraculous.\nThe bottle of Nourishing Yuan Pill, although its effect was greatly enhanced due to the Star Moon Grass,\nEven without the Star Moon Grass, with this basic handbook on alchemy, the old Daoist Baiyang believed that soon, he would be able to use ordinary ingredients to concoct pills comparable to Shaolin Temple’s Great Rejuvenation Pill!\nIn a thousand years, based on Li Hu’s accomplishments, he could be known as the Pill Ancestor!\n\"Alas, your gift is of great importance; I know myself best. In the beginning, even if I didn’t share those alchemy experiences, you could’ve figured them out by yourself.\"\nWith a gesture, the old Daoist Baiyang stopped Li Hu from speaking further and continued:\n\"Having received such a grand gift from you, I’m truly undeserving. But having seen and memorized your alchemy technique, I can at least offer you a reasonable recompense.\"\n\"Old Daoist, you don’t need to do this. These things are of little concern to me.\"\nLi Hu declined, as he had no intention of hoarding his knowledge.\nWhen he initially developed alchemy, it was to strengthen the foundation of the Divine Land Martial Arts, to conduct experiments in world ascension, and to forge a path of shattered voids.\nIf he could propagate the Star Moon Grass and alchemy in a short period, he would be delighted beyond measure.\nHowever, the old Daoist Baiyang seemed not to have heard him, continuing to ask on his own:\n\"Little brother, did you know, back when the Martial Ancestor pioneered martial arts and the Dao Ancestor once also established a lineage?\"\n\"Oh, Dao Ancestor?\"\nAccording to legend, thousands of years ago, the Martial Ancestor and Dao Ancestor debated beneath Purple Bamboo Mountain when a meteorite came from the heavens. The Martial Ancestor observed the stone for seven days and nights to develop martial arts and Qi cultivation.\nThis martial arts legend had already been widely spread since the emergence of the Martial Arts Origin Scripture five years ago.\nAnd in that unnamed valley, there were two meditation cushions, the Dao aura filling the valley, and that meteorite from beyond the skies.\nBased on the valley’s conditions, Li Hu was certain that there were few discrepancies from the actual events.\nHowever, Li Hu always had a question.\nThis question remained unanswered despite traveling the world and using Divine Sense to explore countless books.\nThat is,\nThe Martial Ancestor pioneered martial arts and Qi cultivation and was hence known as Martial Ancestor,\nThen what about the Dao Ancestor?\nWhy is the Dao Ancestor called the Dao Ancestor?\nIn historical texts, traces of the Martial Ancestor, like the dominance among the Seven Central Plains Countries, still existed.\nBut the Dao Ancestor seemed to have emerged from thin air.\nAside from the debate with the Martial Ancestor below Purple Bamboo Mountain and the creation of the Martial Arts Origin Scripture, there were no other tales of the Dao Ancestor.\nLike a historical phantom that suddenly appeared, everyone naturally called him the Dao Ancestor.\nVery strange,\nNo deeds yet naturally called the Dao Ancestor.\nMoreover, when the two ancestors debated at Purple Bamboo Mountain, the Dao Ancestor should have also gleaned something from the meteorite. But why has no Dao Ancestor lineage or inheritance ever appeared in this world?\nThus, when the old Daoist Baiyang mentioned the Dao Ancestor, it immediately captured Li Hu’s attention.\n\"Actually, a long time ago, I don’t know exactly when, but the Dao Ancestor did have a lineage, just like the Martial Ancestor’s martial arts and Qi cultivation. Then a great change occurred; I don’t know what happened exactly, and probably no one in the Martial World knows either. But after that, the Dao Ancestor’s direct lineage vanished from this world.\"\n\"Although the Dao Ancestor’s direct lineage disappeared, some offshoot branches survived. Due to that great change, ancestors avoided declaring it. These offshoots were passed down internally from generation to generation, unbeknownst to the Martial World.\"\n\"Our White Cloud Temple is one of those offshoot branches of the Dao Ancestor’s lineage.\"\n\"Alchemy, array, divination, Eight Trigrams, Qimen Qi Fortune Divination... all these things thought of as martial cons are actually true, part of the Dao Ancestor’s offshoot lineage.\"\n\"My alchemical methods are one of those inheritances.\"\n\"Unfortunately, after thousands of years, many inheritances have been lost or remain incomplete. I spent half my life thinking I was supplementing the Dao Ancestor’s ancillary alchemy technique but compared to you, it’s a joke.\"\n\"I lack talent and holding onto it would only bring ridicule, so I’ll willingly pass it all onto you. If you could complete the Dao Ancestor’s lineage, it would put my heart at ease when I meet our ancestors from the White Cloud Temple after I pass.\"\nOriginally, Li Hu intended to decline the old Daoist Baiyang’s offer.\nBut upon hearing the words ’Dao Ancestor’s offshoot lineage’, ’Qimen Dunjia’, and ’array’, he could no longer shift his focus away.\nIf arrays and Qimen Dunjia could help, they might significantly enhance the starlight and moonshine in the medicinal fields, thus realizing the maturity and large-scale cultivation of Star Moon Grass!\nMoreover, he was genuinely intrigued by the Dao Ancestor’s offshoot lineage.\nWhat exactly happened back then that caused the existence and lineage of the Dao Ancestor to disappear from history?\nAnd back then, what matter remained from an entity of the same level as the Martial Ancestor? Could it reveal a glimpse into the charisma left behind by the Dao Ancestor?\nFurthermore, during their time, the Dao Ancestor, who was an equal to the Martial Ancestor, must have left behind something significant. Could it help to restore the lost legacy of the ancient traditions?\nWhen the old Daoist Baiyang brought up the Dao Ancestor, it immediately drew Li Hu’s focused attention.\n\"In truth, a long time ago, I can’t recall when, but there was a lineage from the Dao Ancestor too, like the Martial Ancestor’s martial arts and Qi cultivation. Later, something drastic happened. I don’t really know what it was, but probably nobody in the Martial World knows for sure. After that, the direct lineage of the Dao Ancestor vanished.\"\n\"But the auxiliary branches of the Dao Ancestor’s lineage still survived because, due to that great change, our forebears didn’t dare declare it. These auxiliary pathways have been handed down secretly from generation to generation, and now they are not known in the Martial World.\"\n\"Our White Cloud Temple is one of those offshoot branches of the Dao Ancestor’s lineage.\"\n\"Alchemy, array, divination, Eight Trigrams, these signs you mentioned, these techniques are indeed the offshoot lineage of the Dao Ancestor.\"\n\"My alchemical techniques are one of the handed-down inheritances.\"\n\"I spent half my life thinking I had completed the Dao Ancestor’s auxiliary art of alchemy, and now compared to you, that’s simply a joke.\"\n\"Unfortunately, over thousands of years, many inheritances have been lost or remain incomplete. I thought I had completed the Dao Ancestor’s auxiliary art of alchemy, but compared to you, that is simply laughable.\"\n\"Nevertheless, I will pass everything I know to you. If you can complete the Dao Ancestor’s lineage, I can rest in peace when meeting the ancestors of White Cloud Temple in the afterlife.\"\nInitially, Li Hu intended to decline the old Daoist Baiyang’s goodwill.\nBut upon hearing the words ’Dao Ancestor’s offshoot lineage’, ’Qimen Dunjia’, ’array’ his attention could no longer shift away.",

You can transplant some back, and I can also teach you some planting techniques.\"\nBack in the day, Li Hu traveled the world, peeking at Martial Arts books primarily from large sects and grand families.\nSects like the White Cloud Temple, hidden in deep forests, are countless throughout the Jade Capital Mountain range, and Li Hu could not scour the entire world inch by inch.\nSince the old Daoist Baiyang is such a tactful person, Li Hu naturally couldn’t take advantage casually.\nThe old Daoist Baiyang nodded, feeling both joyful and complex inside.\nHowever, that day, he copied a portion of the Dao Ancestor’s branch arts within the temple and soon immersed himself in Li Hu’s Alchemy.\nLi Hu didn’t linger either; he started researching upon receiving the copy.\nIn the blink of an eye, another five years passed.\nDuring these five years, Li Hu finally understood many techniques in the Dao Ancestor’s branch inheritance and filled in the missing parts based on his understanding.\nUtilizing the Qimen Dunjia Array, Li Hu established an array akin to the Spirit Gathering Array to gather the radiant Power of Starlight and Moonlight at night, enhancing the Star Evil Power in the medicinal fields to catalyze the growth of Star Moon Grass.\nWith this, Li Hu’s preparations were nearly complete.\nThe next day, Li Hu visited the old Daoist Baiyang, exchanging what he had gained amidst various gazes of envy, jealousy, and hatred, leaving behind some copies.\nAfterward, Li Hu bid farewell to the old Daoist Baiyang, closed the courtyard where he had lived for ten years, and left Jade Capital Mountain.\nComing into this world had already been twenty years; Li Hu embarked once more to roam the world.\nBut this time, it wasn’t to peer into others’ secret manuals or search for medicinal spirit herbs; it was to start deploying plans across the world.\nUtilizing the enlightenment from the techniques of Feng Shui and Qimen Dunjia Array, combined with the power of earth and mountains, Li Hu would arrive at a place and create Secret Realms akin to those in fantasy Immortal novels.\nUsing the earth as the base, and the energy of mountains and rivers as materials, he created one Secret Realm after another hidden within the Wilderness Forest.\nThrough Li Hu’s modifications, the Secret Realm would fully converge the Power of Starlight and Moonlight from above the Nine Heavens, then cultivate a myriad of Star Moon Grass and other Spirit Plants transformed by his celestial techniques.\nThese Spirit Plants would solidify the rich Star Evil Power into tremendous Primordial Qi within the plant, becoming the primary spirit medicine for refining Elixirs like the Nourishing Yuan Pill.\nAt the same time, within the Secret Realm, Li Hu left behind techniques he created, resembling those powerful attack moves in fantasy Immortal stories.\nAs Li Hu moved, Secret Realms began to be established, leaving behind techniques once only imagined.\nJust waiting for a period, allowing the Secret Realm to develop and form, will emit great brilliance and produce significant noise, indicating to people within a hundred miles that this Secret Realm has matured, treasures emerging.\nAnd when treasure seekers have scoured the spirit medicine and inheritances within, Li Hu’s array established with the mountain river will automatically operate and close.\nJust like this, circulating repeatedly, gradually enhancing the Martial Artists’ strength in this world step by step.\nThis is Li Hu’s strategy to spread Martial Arts throughout the world!\nTime passed within Li Hu’s step-by-step deployment, during which he also encountered many people and matters.\nThe years in the Martial World rush people to age; generations of young heroes rise, creating one Legendary saga after another, though all this had nothing to do with Li Hu.\nHe was like an observer of the world, executing strategies while sowing the seeds of growth in this world.\nYet he wasn’t as indifferent as the Heavenly Dao.\nOccasionally, witnessing the sins in the world, he wasn’t stingy about lending assistance, sometimes even leaving behind some inheritances, sowing a thread of hope into the world.\nFor instance, while passing through a certain city where gangsters broke children’s hands and feet, abused young beggars for money, Li Hu wasn’t stingy about casually eliminating those gangs, healing the children’s wounds, and leaving behind one or two life-saving Martial Arts moves.\nWherever there is light in the world, there will naturally be darkness.\nLi Hu wasn’t some virtuous figure trying to eliminate the darkness of the world; he wasn’t that idle.\nHowever, if encountered, he naturally wouldn’t hesitate to lend assistance.\nAlso, feeling amused at times, he would hand a Martial Arts secret manual to someone appearing with auspicious fate on the roadside or give pointers to a dissatisfied beggar to change their life.\nHe was like an old monster wandering through the world, watching the Martial World like the ebb and flow of tides.\nWith such a mindset, another five years passed in the blink of an eye.\nIn these five years, waves were stirred in the Martial World due to Li Hu’s mischievous dispersal of Martial Arts secret manuals.\nSeeing a resolute village lad receiving Daoist’s guidance on Profound Skill wasn’t uncommon.\nThose Martial Arts, similar in inheritance to the Martial Arts legacy yet differ in power and advancement.\nHis mischief must have brought countless storms to the Martial World.\nIf this world were a novel, and the protagonist were to defy destiny, pacifying the chaos in the Martial World, Li Hu would undoubtedly be the final mastermind villain behind the scenes.\nAfter five years of planning, the arrangements around the world were mostly completed.\nHowever, the maturity of the first Secret Realm was still some time away, so Li Hu returned to Jade Capital Mountain, establishing a field and releasing news that he would soon lecture the Martial Artists of the world for seven days here.\nThis news instantly stirred the entire Martial Arts world.\nFifteen years ago, Li Hu, who defeated Jue Wutian, was faintly known as the world’s top expert.\nNow, fifteen years have passed; although Li Hu has been inconspicuous, everyone speculates on his level of strength.\nAt less than twenty years, he was already unparalleled in the world, let alone now?\nProbably now, Li Hu’s strength is truly the number one in the world!\nSuch a Grandmaster lecturing, especially an open lecture, is unprecedented; how can it not cause a tremendous stir in the Martial World!\nNumerous Martial Artists who received the news flocked to Jade Capital Mountain, and for some unaffiliated individuals, this lecture was seen as an incredibly important opportunity, arriving early at Jade Capital Mountain.\nJust when all eyes were gathered on Jade Capital Mountain, the three Grandmasters in the Martial World, the Demon Sect Leader in the south Jue Wutian, the Celestial Sword Elder from Celestial Sword Manor, and the carefree man from East Sea Bibo Island.\nSuddenly joined forces to challenge Li Hu on Jade Capital Mountain.",

      "content": "Chapter 356: Chapter 027: Three Grandmasters\nCrash!\nIn the void, three grand and towering figures hovered above the firmament, their gaze fixed on the immense mountain peak rising to the sky in the distance.\nTheir majestic aura spread out, causing the nearby void to tremble.\nA tremendously powerful aura seemed to fill the heavens and earth, attracting numerous awe-filled gazes from the surrounding shadows.\nThe three Grandmasters who once subdued the world have come together today!\nEven the most clueless in the Martial World felt an impending storm, a sense that a massive tidal wave was about to overturn the entire Martial World.\n\"Old Tian Jian, I didn’t expect you to actually come. Aren’t you afraid the Martial World will accuse you of colluding with the Demon Sect?\"\nIn the void, Jue Wutian, with an aura as dark as an abyss, had grown even stronger than he was fifteen years ago.\nAt this moment, his gaze was sharp as he looked at the white-haired and dark-robed old Tian Jian, his voice sinister.\n\"To think, once holding the seat of the world’s number one, and the leader of the righteous path in the Central Plains, has now fallen to colluding with the Demon Sect. Truly, life is unpredictable!\"\n\"Young Wutian, save your worries. Fifteen years ago, you were defeated by that person. I wonder if you still have the strength to lift your fists once more.\"\nTian Jian stood in the void, upright like a long sword piercing the heavens.\nHis face, lined with wrinkles, remained calm, eyes closed, hands folded, and his old voice indifferent and unchanging.\n\"Hahaha, I am well, no need for an old man destined to be abandoned by time to worry. If you’re not convinced, you can have a bout before facing that person.\"\nJue Wutian’s gaze towards Tian Jian was deep, carrying a hint of killing intent.\n\"If you wish to fight, I will accompany you. I want to see if, after more than twenty springs, you can still withstand one of my sword strikes.\"\nTian Jian remained with his eyes closed, responding indifferently.\nIn an instant, the air seemed to solidify.\nKilling intent filled the sky.\n\"Enough, Junior Brother Jue, Fellow Daoist Tian Jian, the enemy is at hand. We should abandon past grievances and work together to face the enemy.\"\nSeeing the conflict about to erupt, Hai Wuya from the East Sea had to speak up.\n\"Hmph, traitor. One day I will take your head.\"\nJue Wutian snorted coldly, his gaze full of killing intent swept over Hai Wuya, before moving away.\nEventually, he spoke no more.\nFifteen years ago, after fighting that person, he knew quite well the strength of that young man named Li Hu.\nEven after fifteen years of arduous cultivation, he knew his strength was still not enough to match him.\nTherefore, the Alliance was necessary.\nOnly by combining the forces of the three Grandmasters standing at the pinnacle of the Martial Arts could they possibly suppress that person.\nEnduring a temporary loss was nothing, as long as they could remove that obstacle, then no one in the Martial World could prevent him from dominating the Central Plains Martial Arts.\nTian Jian, the old man?\nHmph, just a withered bone in a tomb!\nThe three of them each harbored their own thoughts, but the immense pressure from Li Hu forced the three opposing forces to unite.\nEven if they couldn’t truly align their minds, the combined power of the three at the pinnacle of Martial Arts was enough to dominate the entire world.\nThe air was silent.\nTime slowly passed amidst this deathly stillness.\nAt the foot of Jade Capital Mountain, Martial Artists who came to listen gradually arrived, and the number of Martial Artists gathered there increased.\nSeeing the three towering figures blocking the front of Jade Capital Mountain, the martial artists sensibly kept their distance.\nAs time passed, the number of Martial Artists gathered at the foot of the mountain reached tens of thousands.\nSome discussions started to arise.\n\"Grandmasters, at the peak of Martial Arts, the four Grandmasters who stand at the pinnacle of the Martial World have all gathered here. Even if we gain nothing today, just witnessing such a scene is enough!\"\n\"Indeed, any one of the Grandmasters would usually be like a hidden dragon, and today they all gather at Jade Capital Mountain. It’s truly a grand event in the Martial World.\"\n\"Speaking of which, why did those three come together? Did the sweeper Li Hu offend the other three Grandmasters at the same time?\"\n\"It’s understandable for the Demon Sect Leader Jue Wutian. Fifteen years ago, he suffered a humiliating defeat at Xiangyun City, even losing the four Demon Venerables. With his personality, revenge is certain, but it’s puzzling to see him rope in Tian Jian and Hai Wuya.\"\n\"Indeed, Grandmaster Li hasn’t offended Tian Jian or Hai Wuya since his rise. His few battles have been against the Demon Sect, which is indeed strange.\"\n\"Ha, could it be that Tian Jian and Hai Wuya, seeing Grandmaster Li’s strength continuously growing, are afraid that one day, he might overshadow them, so they’re preemptively...\"\nOne raggedly dressed martial artist, with a pointed face, joked.\nHowever, before he could finish his sentence,\na clear sword hum suddenly resonated across heaven and earth, closing in abruptly, echoing by the ear.\nThe void rippled like waves for a moment, a fleeting ripple shimmered and vanished.\nScree!\nIn an instant, the surrounding void seemed to be sliced open, and that martial artist, along with dozens around him, were swept into that terrifying invisible Sword Qi, torn in half.\nBlood gushed out.\nForming rivers on the ground.\nThe surrounding crowd retreated in fear, staring at the bloody scene ahead, enveloped in silence.\n\"Misfortune comes from the mouth, a Grandmaster cannot be insulted, and how could the likes of you irrelevant people casually discuss a Grandmaster.\"\nHai Wuya coldly swept his gaze over the frightened crowd, his voice devoid of any emotion, resonating through the void.\nThe one who acted was Tian Jian, seeming as if he had done something trivial, his expression unchanging.\nAt that moment, every Martial Artist’s heart was filled with fear and reverence.\nJust a single joke, leading not only to that person’s death but also affecting dozens around him.\nKilling dozens with a word!\nThis was the Celestial Sword of the old Tian Jian,\nThe Heavenly Dao is merciless!\n\"Heh....\"\nJue Wutian cast a fleeting glance at the white-haired, ethereally immortal Tian Jian, his gaze deep, with a tone of sarcasm, as if pondering something.\nAfter this event, none dared make a sound.\nAt the foot of Jade Capital Mountain, a deathly silence enveloped the tens of thousands.\nThe air was filled with oppression, and not even the corpses on the ground were dared to be cleared away.\nNo one knew how long this dead silence lasted,\nSoon, a path suddenly split open on Jade Capital Mountain, shrouded in a misty cloud, as if exuding immortal light, a figure emerged from within.\nIt was a Daoist Child, appearing six or seven years old, holding something like a letter.\nUnder the gaze of all, he walked down from the mountain gate, unafraid.\n\"That kid Li must be scared, only sends a child to meet death.\"\nTian Jian’s eyes remained indifferent, looking ahead, his voice devoid of any emotion.",

      "content": "Chapter 357: Chapter 028 A Calligraphy Sheet\nThe Celestial Sword Elder’s gaze was indifferent, looking at the Daoist child as if looking at a dead person.\nThere was some commotion among the surrounding martial artists.\n\"Is Grandmaster Li about to concede? I wonder if the lecture can still proceed as planned this time.\"\n\"Probably not, with the three Grandmasters joining forces, who in the world can withstand them?\"\n\"Indeed, although Grandmaster Li is astonishingly talented and young, standing at the pinnacle of the martial world upon his debut, ultimately he stands alone and weak.\"\n\"It’s a pity we’ll come all this way for nothing, but witnessing such a scene will be enough for me to boast about for a lifetime.\"\nAlthough the previous sword strike of the Celestial Sword Elder had intimidated many martial artists present,\nultimately, someone couldn’t help but express their opinions.\nHowever, compared to before, the surrounding martial artists were much more restrained, as the pile of bodies cut in half and the blood yet to dry starkly warned everyone of the consequences of careless words.\n\"This lecture might end without a result, hopefully, Grandmaster Li can hold another one next time. A Grandmaster level guidance, even a glimpse from the outside, would be enough, what a pity.\"\n\"Yes, it’s a real pity this time.\"\nAmidst the murmurs of regret, no one had hope for Li Hu.\nThis was normal, for as strong as Li Hu was, there was still a limit.\nIn the path of martial arts, the further one advanced, the less the gap between those of the same level.\nIn the postnatal stage, a genius postnatal martial artist battling more than ten ordinary postnatal martial artists of the same level was not a difficult task.\nBut at the Grandmaster level, two newly ascended Grandmasters could usually defeat a veteran Grandmaster who had been immersed in that realm for many years.\nThis is because,\nevery Grandmaster was once an astonishing figure in the martial world, a figure of renown in their youth.\nThe experience to become a Grandmaster martial artist is nothing short of legendary.\nTo emerge victorious among tens of thousands of martial artists, each is considered a paragon of their era.\nAs the martial realm advances, the gap between those of the same level naturally reduces.\nIt’s true of Grandmasters, let alone great Grandmasters?\nEvery great Grandmaster is a living legend in the martial arts world.\nWhen they are present, the world is silent.\nWith the arrival of the three great Grandmasters, it wasn’t a question of winning or losing; if Li Hu could escape alive from the three Grandmasters’ combined might, it would already shock the world.\nBeneath Jade Capital Mountain, a kind of martial artist felt regret in their hearts.\nThe outcome, decided the moment the three Grandmasters appeared.\nNo one held any hope for Li Hu, even if his past achievements were showcased; no one was optimistic about this conflict.\nIn the eyes of many, a Daoist child descended from Jade Capital Mountain, calmly approaching the gate, paying respects to the three Grandmasters suspended in the air.\nIn a youthful voice, he said:\n\"Seniors, having traveled from afar, the ancestor specially tasked me to bring something to greet you.\"\nWith that, he lifted the illustrated text in his hand.\n\"Is that kid scared, so he sent you, a child, to deliver an apology letter?\"\nThe Celestial Sword Elder stood with arms crossed, standing distantly in the void, said indifferently:\n\"You may go back, tell that kid surnamed Li to immediately leave Jade Capital Mountain, hand over the Martial Arts Origin Scripture and his entire heritage, abolish his martial arts, and from now on, never return to the martial world, and we can spare his life.\"\nThe voice was filled with condescension,\nlike a high-up noble showing pity to a roadside beggar.\nSparing his life,\nwas already an exceptional grace from the Celestial Sword Elder.\nAll around was dead silent, every martial artist felt a sense of oppression, an innate fear.\nThe Celestial Sword Elder, although always a leader of the righteous path in the martial world, only the seasoned old martial artists knew, that high-up individual’s disposition was not good.\nThe law of the jungle, survival of the fittest, was starkly displayed before all martial artists.\nThe Daoist child remained unmoved,\nin the eyes of all, he clumsily opened the illustrated text, face towards the three.\nIn the void, the three Grandmasters observed this with indifference.\nBut soon,\nthey regretted it,\nthat deep-seated regret.\nIf life could be lived again, they swore they would run as far as possible.\nBefore that Daoist child opened the illustrated text, they would never set foot on Jade Capital Mountain even for a step!\nOn that ordinary sheet of paper, a stack of which could be bought for two taels of silver on the street,\nwas a word written with an ordinary brush, ordinary ink—\nGET OUT!!!\nWhen the paper opened, the word \"GET OUT\" appeared in the void.\nThe next moment, boundless light burst forth from the paper, stroke by stroke, as if connecting with the essence of heaven and earth, as if a decree from the Celestial Emperor, bringing imperial might to all living things!\nThe sky exploded, and immediately a vast and mighty aura surged forth, permeating the universe, filling the heavens and earth!\nAt that moment, the three great Grandmasters, renowned across the world,\nimmediately felt an immeasurable pressure assaulting them, a weight incomparable to the lands and seas of the world.\nIt was pressure from the whole world, as if facing the hostility of the entire world!\n\"Ah!!!\"\nIn a daze, the three only felt as though they were facing a towering giant Celestial Emperor that filled the entire universe!\nThat immense and imposing figure merely glanced in their direction, and instantly boundless killing intent enveloped them, the whole world plunging into a dark abyss!\nDEATH!!!\nA bloody character for death overshadowed the sky, as if the heavens were collapsing!\nThis was truly the law from the spoken word, their frenzied spiritual sense wildly warned them of a fact:\nIf they couldn’t stop it, they would die!\nIn a moment of crisis, the three unleashed the most powerful techniques they have ever mastered.\n\"Heaven’s Intention is Elusive!\"\n\"Netherworld Divine Domain!\"\n\"Boundless Vast Sea!\"\nThe Celestial Sword Elder could no longer maintain his demeanor, as the longsword in his hand roared forth, transforming into a stream of light in the air.\nThis sword, as if resonating with the will of heaven,\nseemed endowed with earth-splitting power, coming from the alternate void, cutting through and tearing the layers of space at that moment.\nThis was the ultimate move of the Celestial Sword Elder, the most dazzling, pinnacle of swordsmanship in the world.\nSimultaneously, Jue Wutian seemed to transform into the Netherworld.\nA colossal black hole swallowed all the light within a hundred-foot radius of the void, engulfing souls along with it, creating a massive void where existence seemed to vanish completely in that region.\nAfter fifteen years, Jue Wutian’s Netherworld Divine Skill advanced, as if turning the world into an Asura battlefield!\nHai Wuya at this moment turned into the Vast Sea, the sky and clouds changed dramatically, as if the sound of countless waves reverberated through the void.\nThe whole firmament transformed into a vast sea and blue sky, a tidal wave surging like the sky collapsing, engulfing everything ahead!\nThe three killer moves were the most brilliant displays of the martial world,\npresenting a force that seemed to shatter and destroy the whole world.\nHowever,\nin the face of the word \"GET OUT\" emanating an immense power that bridged heaven and earth and brought the supreme decree of divine retribution to the realm of humanity, as if the Celestial Emperor descended to the mortal world,\nit was like smashing against a great indomitable god of ultimate command,\nCRACK!!!\nIn an instant, the longsword that had accompanied the Celestial Sword Elder for decades shattered into pieces, its force obliterated by the formidable power emanating from that one word.\nJue Wutian’s Netherworld was instantly erased into nothingness, the massive gravitational force dissipating in an instant.\nHai Wuya’s Vast Sea Power was instead reversed like a tsunami, consuming all the resistance of the three like a tidal wave.\nIn an instant, the surrounding space seemed to collapse piece by piece, as an overwhelming force swept away all their resistance like dried wood,\nleaving the three Grandmasters as fallen stars, propelled backward and striking the distant mountains with a thunderous crash.\nAll around fell dead silent.",

The Grandmaster has declared that the lecture will begin in ten days. Please prepare yourselves.\"\nThe Daoist Child slowly put away the piece of paper, addressing the assembly in a young, tender voice.\nAfter speaking, without waiting for any response from the deathly silent crowd of martial arts figures below, he turned around and slowly walked toward the mountain.\nAs he reached the summit, the mist on Jade Capital Mountain automatically gathered, blocking everyone’s view.\nThe Daoist Child’s figure gradually disappeared into the mist-covered summit of Jade Capital Mountain.\nIn the original place, only a bewildered, silent group of martial artists remained.\n...\nUnder Jade Capital Mountain, a piece of paper defeated the Grandmasters.\nThe events of that day quickly shook the entire Martial World.\nThis news was too shocking and too unbelievable.\nBut in the face of reality, they had no choice but to believe.\n\"That one’s methods always exceed people’s expectations time and again!\"\n\"Invincible, with just one word, gravely injuring and nearly killing the three Grandmasters, such divine means make him invincible in the world.\"\n\"Too powerful. Three hundred years ago, Grandmaster Yan Kuangtu fought two other Grandmasters of the same Level and was undefeated.

I must attend this Immortal God’s lecture!\"\nWith the outcome of that battle spreading, Li Hu’s name immediately gained worldwide fame, sparking huge discussions in the Martial World.\nBecause of the terrifying strength displayed by Li Hu in the drama under Jade Capital Mountain, many martial artists dared not even mention his name, instead referring to him as \"that one.\"\nUnlike the stunning debut from the Celestial Essence Sect, unlike the unexpected defeat of Jue Wutian.\nThe battle under Jade Capital Mountain has thoroughly established Li Hu as the number one in the world.\nOr rather, not just simply the number one.\nThe miraculous method of injuring three Grandmasters with one word made many martial artists believe that Li Hu had transcended the pinnacle of Martial Arts, reaching another level.\nThat level is like the difference between an Immortal and a human.\n\"That one has already become a person like an Immortal God above all life!\"\nIndeed, anyone who witnessed firsthand what happened under Jade Capital Mountain would not think the three Grandmasters were on the same level as that one, let alone the weaker themselves?\nThat is the universally recognized Immortal God standing above all life!\nAmidst the hustle and bustle, many martial artists who initially didn’t plan to attend the lecture at Jade Capital Mountain put down their matters and headed there.\nThroughout the vast Martial World, whether a fresh young hero just emerging or a hidden master in various places, or famous Grandmasters, a large number of martial artists gathered, almost half of the Martial World’s martial artists converged on Jade Capital Mountain.\nEven the southern Demon Sect quietly sent people.\nThe eyes of the world are gathered on Jade Capital Mountain.",

Confrontations and vendettas are not rare when enemies meet and their eyes blaze with hatred.\nHowever, within these ten days, beneath Jade Capital Mountain,\nno one has dared to cause a major disturbance.\nIt is all due to that deity-like figure on Jade Capital Mountain and the immense anticipation martial artists hold for the teachings of someone who has transcended the current Martial Arts realm, prompting the natural maintenance of order.\nAny confrontation that might lead to chaos is quickly halted by seasoned veterans from the Martial Arts world.\nThe methods displayed by that figure are akin to those of Immortal Gods, so having the opportunity to sit and listen to his teachings, what a rare chance is this?\nIf one could use this to elevate their Martial Arts even further, who wouldn’t value such an opportunity?\nWith self-imposed restraint, even though the number of martial artists under Jade Capital Mountain grew over ten days, stability was maintained throughout.\nOf course,\nthe restraint of the martial artists beneath Jade Capital Mountain is not unconnected to the terrifying pressure emanating from the cloud-shrouded summit.\nThat feeling is like the watchful eye of the Heavenly Dao, observing their every move from above.\nLike pins and needles on their backs.\nTime passed quickly,\nten days later,\nJade Capital Mountain opened, and a streaming glow of multicolored light flowed forth, stretching across the sky.\nAmidst the celestial light, the stairway ascending to the peak of Jade Capital Mountain seemed to extend infinitely, reaching far into the endless depths, as if directly connecting to the Celestial Court.\nAmidst the tense anticipation of countless martial artists, a clear voice filled with mysterious Dao resonance suddenly echoed in their minds:\n\"This is the Heaven-Ascending Ladder of 108,000 steps. Those who reach the end, regardless of age or sect, may receive my personal transmission.\"\nIn a simple statement, a storm of emotional waves surged through the hearts of these martial artists.\nAs contemporary figures in the Martial Arts world as well as throughout the development of Martial Arts over thousands of years, these individuals stood at the pinnacle, transcending mortal beings to reach the Divine Realm,\nsuch a being’s personal transmission—isn’t this an alluring temptation!\nRUSH!!!\nInstantly, countless martial artists charged toward the Heaven-Ascending Ladder like floodwaters bursting forth, boiling and surging with excitement.\n\"Ah!\"\nHowever, the moment they set foot on the street leading to the heavens, a mountain-like gravity pressed down on each martial artist; some who were weaker and impatient were immediately crushed and fell, tumbling down the stairs, covered in bruises.\n\"Something’s strange, be careful!\"\nThrough the firsthand experiences of the initial vanguard, the martial artists behind were forcibly calmed.\nAfter hesitating, those entering the 108,000-step heavenly street gradually slowed down, becoming less impatient and better prepared for re-entry.\nThe crowd was vast, converging like a reverse-flowing river.\nAt this moment,\nat the top of Jade Capital Mountain, in an incomparably vast White Jade Space.\nThe sky above,\nthe surrounding void reflected true vacuum-like ripples, as if Li Hu was seated in another dimension. His clear gaze pierced through numerous layers of void, witnessing every scene on the street beneath him.\nHis expression was as still as an ancient well, much like the Heavenly Dao observing the lives struggling between life and death.\nThis was a trial he had set up.\nThe 108,000 steps, created through a combined array and his supreme methods, were both an illusory and a real training experience.\nThe gravity weighing down on martial artists automatically adjusts according to each individual’s strength. It is more like an illusion technique that transcends the boundary between fantasy and reality, originating from within one’s heart.\nOnly those with great perseverance and determination can pass the first ten thousand steps of the Heavenly Ladder.\nAs for the remaining eight thousand steps of the Heavenly Ladder, in addition to the physical pressure, many internal demons lure martial artists, and only with great perseverance can they break through everything and reach the end, completing the journey through the 108,000-step Heavenly Ladder.\nOf course,\nthis 108,000-step Heavenly Ladder test is only there to select from among the crowd those suitable for Li Hu’s creation, based on his lifelong study and Martial Arts insights, of the fragmented void Dao techniques.\nThese techniques are not just experiments; each one embodies a significant portion of Li Hu’s life’s Martial Arts essence.\nBesides those with great perseverance, determination, and persistence who pass the 108,000-step Heavenly Ladder, the eliminated martial artists are still able to attend this lecture.\nThe 108,000-step Heavenly Ladder is merely a combination of illusion and array formation. Once eliminated, they are automatically transferred to this White Jade Space.\nAnd these eliminated individuals become targets for Li Hu’s broader dissemination.\nAs time ticks away,\nquickly, one bedraggled martial artist drenched in sweat appears in the vast White Jade Space, followed by a second, a third, and more and more.\nAn hour later, all martial artists who participated in the Heavenly Ladder trial have appeared within the enormous White Jade Space.\nWith a clear and resounding chime filled with boundless Dao resonance from above the sky, a world of glowing light unfolds, revealing a figure ethereal as an immortal, slowly manifesting in the void, seemingly isolated by an Alternate Void.\nLike an Immortal God, even more so like a Dao Ancestor.\nSitting cross-legged in the void.\nThe entire White Jade Space instantly falls into silence.\nBelow him, seven people are seated on prayer mats.\nThose seven are the martial artists who passed the 108,000-step Heaven-Ascending Ladder.\nAmong them are men and women, the old and the young, even a farmer’s son with no martial skills.\nBut every one of them had eyes filled with incredible resolve.\n\"You have done well. After the lecture, you may inherit my full transmission.\"\nLi Hu’s gaze lightly swept across the seven, his voice echoing within the void.\n\"Thank you, teacher.\"\nThe seven stood and bowed in respect.\nLi Hu waved his arm, an invisible force stilled the entire audience.\nThe lecture then began.\nOn the first day, Li Hu began with the origins of Martial Arts, from Refining Essence and Qi of the Postnatal to Refining Qi and Spirit of the Innate, advancing to the realms of Grandmasters and Supreme Grandmasters.\nFrom low to high, he thoroughly explained the Martial Arts system.\nThat very day saw over a thousand people achieve breakthroughs in their realms.\nOn the second day, Li Hu began to discuss the Dao of Heaven and the principles of diminishing surplus and supplementing deficiency.\nIn the world, the Great Dao and its principles flow, all of which became clear as lines on a palm under Li Hu’s lecture.\nOnce again, individuals broke through realms that day, including Grandmasters and a newly advanced Supreme Grandmaster.\nOn the third day, with Martial Arts and Heavenly Dao already expounded, Li Hu moved onto the path of the Martial Arts Master breaking the void.\nIf the first two days still belonged within the realm of martial arts, then the following days gradually transitioned to magical modifications, creating a fantasy system of battling heaven and earth based on martial arts, culminating in the ultimate sublimation of void fracture.\nOn the fourth day, the focus shifted towards an immortal hero style.\nThe crafting of Immortal Arts emphasizes Divine Cultivation, employing the training of Divine Sense and the tempering of one’s True Essence to undergo a qualitative transformation, from Qi Refining to Foundation Establishment, then the Martial Arts Golden Core, Nascent Soul incarnation, advancing toward the final transcendence through Heaven’s Tribulation for metamorphic ascension.\nIn the last three days, Li Hu also discussed legacy teachings left by Dao Ancestors, Alchemy Dao, Qimen Dunjia, Array Techniques, Mechanisms, and other supplementary arts.\nAmong these, Alchemy is a particularly important new system.\nShortly thereafter, when the Secret Realm he had once laid out in the world emerges, Alchemy will be the most crucial support for the Martial Arts System to branch into fantasy and immortal hero narratives!\nSeven days later, the lecture concluded, and Jade Capital Mountain closed.\nThe great transformation of the world began.",

      "content": "Chapter 360: Chapter 31: The Beginning of Great Change\nThe teachings on Jade Capital Mountain have brought an unparalleled sensation to the Martial World.\nFor thousands of years, the Martial Arts System had developed continuously, yet it never transcended the bounds of Postnatal, Innate, Grandmasters, and Grandmaster Grandmasters.\nThe path of Refining Essence and Qi, pioneered by the Martial Ancestor in ancient times, has continued to this day.\nLike a great tree, the Martial Arts philosophy established by the Martial Ancestor serves as its trunk, while the martial arts developments over thousands of years have become the flourishing branches and leaves that extend from it.\nNo matter how flourishing the foliage becomes, it cannot escape the constraints of the trunk’s system.\nHowever, Li Hu’s teachings on Jade Capital Mountain have opened another path.\nBased on martial arts, yet transcending its realm, opening a Heaven-Reaching Dao far above!\nSuch mastery, wandering the nine heavens, entering and exiting the Netherworld with Immortal Gods techniques, inspires boundless reverence in every martial artist.\nGod of Martial Arts, Saint of the Mortal Realm!\nNow, Li Hu on Jade Capital Mountain is universally recognized by the martial artists as a holy being transcending all worldly existence.\nAnd because of Li Hu’s open teachings to learners of all kinds, people in the Martial World refer to him simply as that one.\nMoreover, Jade Capital Mountain has become the unique holy place in the hearts of all martial artists today.\nAs the teachings concluded, Jade Capital Mountain closed, and countless martial artists carried Li Hu’s philosophies across the world, like sparks, spreading the seeds of extraordinary enlightenment throughout the Divine Land.\nThe Martial World found itself in an extreme bottleneck for a time.\nMartial artists were digesting the insights gained from the teachings on Jade Capital Mountain, starting to try new Laws, delve into Alchemy, Qimen Dunjia, Mechanical Techniques and more auxiliary skills.\nAt the same time, countless martial artists were putting more energy into waiting.\nWaiting for the great opportunity for all martial artists of the world, as mentioned by that one before the end of the Jade Capital Mountain teachings.\nBefore leaving Jade Capital Mountain, that one had this to say.\nWith the limits of Heaven and Earth, even though he had pioneered the methods of shattering the void and crossing tribulation ascending through two Dao systems, due to the lack of Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi, even the mightiest path would be hard to prove.\nHowever, he had found a way.\nDuring his travels across the world in the past, he saw a place of beautiful geomancy, and using the geomancy of the mountains combined with a Qimen Dunjia Array to draw upon the starry sky, he established a series of Void Heaven Secret Realms within a subspace.\nWithin these secret realms, the vast starlight and moonlight suffused the universe. There, he cultivated Star Moon Grass to transmute a great amount of Star Evil Qi into Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi, and this Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi, along with the dense starlight and moonlight, would in a few years give rise to countless Spirit Plants and Spirit Medicines.\nAdditionally, in a location within the secret realm, he left detailed inheritances of various Cultivation Techniques, as well as some of the Divine Weapons and Elixirs he had forged, all precious cultivation resources.\nA few years later, once the secret realm matured, it would open automatically.\nAt that time, anyone in the Martial World could enter.\nAll the treasures within would be theirs for the taking if they are fated.\nSuch things, like myths and legends, would have in the past been dismissed with scorn by ninety-nine percent of those in the Martial World upon hearing the news.\nBut after the events of defeating the Three Grandmasters with a single word, transcending the Void Outside the Sky, and then the teachings at Jade Capital Mountain pioneering the Immortal Gods Dao,\nAfter experiencing so many wondrous occurrences, no martial artist would dare question that one on Jade Capital Mountain anymore.\nBecause of this, numerous martial artists in the Martial World were preparing eagerly, waiting for the secret realm to open, so they could seize a great fortune, bringing calm to the land.\nIt must be known that at Jade Capital Mountain, the content of the seven-day teachings only laid the foundation, presenting a complete system for the people, allowing them to explore forward along the established framework, just like the Martial Ancestor’s founding of the path of Refining Essence and Qi.\nBut among these, there were no detailed cultivation techniques.\nAfter all, not everyone is a genius capable of creating a suitable system reaching the pinnacle of the Dao in a short amount of time; such talents are scarcely found.\nCompared to techniques created by others, they preferred to trust the ones left by Saint Li Hu, who achieved unparalleled realms, pioneering the two Dao paths of Fantasy and Immortal Heroes.\nMoreover, within the secret realm, there were countless natural treasures, arts inheritances, various Divine Weapons, Spiritual Objects, and Elixirs?\nAny of these, should they be obtained, could sustain a family lineage for a thousand years.\nIn comparison to immediate gains and losses, it was better to prepare well and be ready to reach for a big opportunity when the secret realm opened.\nTime passed slowly in this calm.\nWith many eyes eagerly watching,\nThe first secret realm finally opened on a certain day three years later.\nIt was reported that on that day, celestial light shook the heavens, penetrating the nine skies, spreading a massive vibration far and wide.\nEven a thousand miles away, one could vaguely see the phenomenon in the distance.\nInstantly, the entire Martial World was in an uproar.\nIn a short time, the secret realm located in the remote mountains was filled with more than half the martial artists of the Martial World, even attracting those from gangs who knew only simple Kung Fu, unwilling farmer’s sons, and even descendants of scholarly families.\nCountless people surged towards the direction of the secret realm, one could say the opening of this secret realm captured the attentions of everyone in the world.\nCrossing the threshold of the secret realm,\nwas like crossing space, entering a different world.\nThis world too had blue skies, white clouds, and as far as the eye could see, there seemed to be no end.\nThis was a world within an array space, existing between illusion and reality, yet truly present, overlapping with the world.\nWithin the secret realm, the atmosphere was dense to the extreme, almost condensing into raindrops.\nThis was because the vast Star Evil Qi from the starry sky was absorbed and transformed by the altered Star Moon Grass and similar Spirit Medicines, generating effects comparable to paradise and sacred grottos.\nWhen creating the secret realm, Li Hu, in order to gather more Star Evil Qi, not only utilized arrays to transform the secret realm into a funnel-like environment for absorbing starlight and moonlight, but also pierced through the dense atmosphere blocking the starlight and moonlight, allowing the entire secret realm to face the vast void directly, devouring the endless Star Evil Qi.\nUnder the surging aggregation of the vast starlight and moonlight energy, along with the function of Spirit Medicines modified by Li Hu, a large quantity of starlight and moonlight was converted into Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi, creating a secret realm with abundant Primordial Qi after years of accumulation.\n\"Such dense Primordial Qi, this place can truly be called a paradise and sacred grotto!\"\n\"Hiss! Such strong medicinal effects, a random weed on the ground contains the Primordial Power of ordinary herbs! This secret realm is so terrifying!\"\nA martial artist casually picked a weed, tried it, and felt the immense energy inside, showing an incredulous expression.\n\"Using the Alchemy techniques passed down by that one, refining the Spirit Medicines in this secret realm into Elixirs could even support breakthroughs for tens of thousands of martial artists!\"\n\"The stones here have also mutated, hiss! After being infused with dense Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi, ordinary stones have turned into Spirit Materials, which with Artifact Refining Techniques could even create Extraordinary Magical Treasures! If placed three years ago, this would be akin to Meteorite Iron for Divine Weapons!\"\n\"Treasure, this is like a massive treasure trove!\"\n\"Too terrifying, this secret realm has no visible end, that one indeed ascended to Immortal God status, surpassing the ordinary world! To have been able to create such a formidable place, and there are even more similar secret realms laid out by that one beyond the Central Plains throughout the land!\"\n\"Hurry, there are more treasures deeper within, and the lineage manuals left by that one!\"\nCountless martial artists scrambled and spread out to explore and search in all directions.\nThe entire secret realm, like a massive treasure trove.\nEspecially since Li Hu of Jade Capital Mountain pioneered Alchemy and Artifact Refining, it could be said that everything within the secret realm, even a handful of soil from the ground, was natural treasure capable of enhancing martial artists’ strength!\nThe secret realm was vast, even an Innate Martial Artist could fly in one direction for three days and three nights without reaching the edge.\nAs such a vast secret realm became scattered with martial artists spreading out, it started to divide off.\nBe it the Wilderness Forest, deep caves, damp swamps, or endless deserts, signs of martial artists began to appear in various terrains.\nIn the secret realm, various natural treasures began to be harvested by martial artists one after another.\nAnd as martial artists dispersed throughout this vast secret realm, conflicts began to gradually emerge.\nHowever, within this secret realm.\nThe most dangerous enemies are not fellow human martial artists!\n\"Be careful!\"\n\"Ah! What is this thing!\"\nA team of martial artists was looking at ripe Vermilion Fruits glowing with a red light, when a shadow flashed through the sky, the entire space seemed to crack open a seam, and among them, a martial artist was sliced in half!",

Old Wu is gone!\"\n\"Damn, what the hell is that thing!\"\nA corpse, severed in half at the waist, lay on the ground, blood splattered everywhere.\nThe faces of the people were filled with fear, their weapons clenched tightly, as they gazed in terror at the yellow shadow ahead.\n\"Is that a leopard?\"\nOn the trunk of the Vermilion Fruit tree ahead, a creature the size of a house cat, covered in spots, was crouched on a branch, slowly licking the blood off its paws.\nIts pupils, glowing with a green light, swept over the group, its grim mouth curling slightly into a mocking human-like smile.\nTerror, dread!\nIn an instant, a chill ran down the spine of every martial artist in the group.\nTheir backs were chilled!\nAs if plunged into an ice hole in the dead of winter, a bucket of cold water poured over their heads, a chill surged from the soles of their feet, freezing their blood in its veins.\n\"This, this... is a Cat Demon!\"\nWhoosh!\nSuddenly, the creature on the branch vanished, transforming into a flash of yellow lightning and rushing into the crowd.\nSwoosh, swoosh, swoosh!\nThe sharp claws restored in mid-air, as if tearing through space; the martial artists’ weapons crumbled like tofu, shattered upon contact, and sharp powerful energy instantly sliced their bodies into pieces, blood splattering everywhere.\nAs if entering a no man’s land, in an entire team of martial artists, no one could withstand the might of that little creature’s claw.\n\"Ah! I quit!\"\n\"Run! Run quickly! It’s a monster!\"\nIn an instant, the team suffered heavy losses, the remaining martial artists’ legs trembled, unable to even hold their weapons, which clanged to the ground as they fled in panic, rolling and crawling in all directions.\n\"Damn! Get back here!\"\nThe large, scarred leader, his face fierce, was immediately enraged and shouted angrily:\n\"Whoever the bastard dares to run again, I’ll kill his whole family when I get back! Get back here!\"\nThis group of martial artists was merely a band of bullies from some small town, used to oppressing ordinary people by strength in numbers, but when faced with such a ferocious creature, how could they have the courage to stay?\nEven with the leader’s anger, those guys ran no slower.\nAmidst the scar-faced man’s rage, suddenly, it felt as if some weight had been added to his shoulder.\nAngrily turning his head,\nhe met a pair of mocking eyes.\nThe little creature stood on his shoulder, at some unknown moment!\nClang!\nThe scarred leader’s knife fell to the ground, his teeth chattering with fear.\n\"Divine, Immortal....\"\nRiiip!\nBefore he could finish his words, a shadow flashed by, causing only a slight ripple in the air.\nThe scarred leader’s head flew off, and from his smooth neck, a spray of blood gushed forth.\n\"Meow!\"\nThe few remaining people had already fled far away, and the little creature did not give chase, fading silently amid a few leaps into the lush branches and leaves of the Vermilion Fruit tree.\nOn the spot, only a heap of mangled corpses remained, and blood that stained the soil red...\nAs the blood seeped into the ground, tendrils slowly emerged from beneath the soil, white threads sprouting to cover the bodies lying on the ground.\nWithin the time it took for an hour to pass, the maimed bodies on the ground seemed to have all nutrients drained from them, like mummies dried for millennia, turned into dust and scattered across the surrounding grassland.\nUpon that tree, the Vermilion Fruits became even more bright red and vibrant...\nThe scene that unfolded on the Nameless Prairie was merely one of the many microcosms of poison within the Secret Realm.\nThere were mammoths like mountains, charging wildly.\nThe great tiger, calling upon mountain winds.\nIn the sky, a giant eagle, its feathers hard like iron plates, could kill with silent swiftness.\nAnd in the desert, the terrifying swarm of ants devoured everything, in the forest, the man-eating demonic flower vine.\nVarious terrifying creatures, even Innate Level experts, in this perilous Secret Realm, might not make it out intact.\nEven approaching the central area, where power, Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi, and starlight mists gathered the most.\nThe dangers hidden within were even more terrifying!\nEven Grandmaster Level experts could not necessarily remain unscathed!\nCountless martial artists fought in the Secret Realm world, lives lost in its depths.\nHowever, there were also many lucky ones who, after defeating those dangerous Guardian Beasts, obtained rich resources.\nNot only did the heavenly materials and earthly treasures they guarded have strong effects, but even the bodies of the exotic beasts greatly aided in the enhancement of the martial artists.\nQuite a few martial artists, under such abundant Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi and ample resources, broke through their barriers, significantly increasing their strength.\nAt this moment, the entire Secret Realm had become a brutal trial ground.\nAt every moment, scenes of all life’s various states unfolded.\n...\nOn Jade Capital Mountain.\nLi Hu sat cross-legged in the void, the energy around him surging, like immortal aura swirling around.\nIn the void before him, a mirror spontaneously appeared, reflecting scenes from the opening Secret Realm miles away.\n\"Demon Plants, Demon Beasts... However, in just ten years, it’s impossible to develop so quickly, right...\"\nWatching those evolved beasts with various Divine Artifact abilities in the mirror, Li Hu frowned slightly in thought.\nThough the Secret Realms I created, due to various reasons, had very abundant Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi, everything inside, whether plant or beast, was merely ordinary at the time.\nSince the first Secret Realm was established to its current opening, it’s only been over eight years.\nIn such a short time, to see the emergence of this new demon beast tribe is indeed hard to believe.\nUnless some powerful force is driving it all.\n\"A push from the Heavenly Dao...\"\nLi Hu gazed into the void, his sight seemingly piercing through the universe, spanning nine heavens and ten lands.\nFor a long time, he spoke softly into the empty void:\n\"Sensing an opportunity for advancement, so instinctively pushing it all, can I understand this as you picking the fruit?\"\nThe Secret Realms he created back then were continually evolving, constantly absorbing the vast energy from the starry sky, while relentlessly expanding.\nLike fruit growing on a tree, forming continually.\nWhen ripe, they will merge into this world, drastically altering the world’s environment and causing enormous expansion as the vast regions integrate.\nIn this world, Li Hu has forgotten how many Secret Realms he established.\nAnd when these numerous Secret Realms \"mature\" and merge, the entire world’s territory will expand dozens or even hundreds of times.\nAt the same time, the vast Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi will cause an upgrade effect on the world.\nHowever, the initial intent behind creating the Secret Realms was not for world ascension and consumption.\nStrictly speaking, this is the Heavenly Dao picking my fruit.\nAs Li Hu’s cool and profound voice echoed in the void,\nhe seemed to faintly feel an impression, a sensation surged into his heart.\nIt was like,\na young and innocent child, caught stealing something by an adult, but stubbornly refusing to give it back even after being caught.\n\"Never mind, unfortunately, it’s all the same destination in the end, this time I’ll let it go, but be cautious of my wrath if you do it again without my permission.\"\nLi Hu shook his head slightly.\nFortunately, his goal in creating Secret Realms was to transform the world, then cast his influence across the land, opening paths for ascension or shattering through boundaries.\nThis naive Heavenly Dao’s actions align somewhat with his own goals, so there’s no need to be overly concerned.\nHowever,\nthis Heavenly Dao, is quite interesting.\nLi Hu’s eyes flashed, then closed as he entered meditation and cultivation.",

      "content": "Chapter 362: Chapter 33: The Struggle of the Great Era (First Update)\nIn the space isolated from the outside world, Li Hu was deep in thought.\nHeavenly Dao Consciousness, or perhaps the consciousness of all living beings.\nHe clearly felt that this consciousness was still in its nascent stage, like an ignorant child, curiously exploring everything in the outside world, while instinctively absorbing what was beneficial to itself.\nLi Hu didn’t really mind that it was promoting the expansion of the Secret Realm and absorbing the fruits it bore.\nAfter all, the world’s devouring of numerous Secret Realms and its evolution were instrumental in advancing his path of breaking through and ascending to propagate the great Dao.\nLi Hu was more curious about when the subtle spark of intelligence in the Heavenly Dao Consciousness had emerged.\nClearly, when he initially ascended to become a Celestial Being and was in harmony with Heaven and Earth, his perception was that the Heavenly Dao was merely like a mechanical program, following the most ancient Law of the jungle, the survival of the fittest, coldly and mechanically driving everything forward.\nBut now, it seemed that this Heavenly Dao had gained a hint of nimbleness.\nAlthough that intelligence was only akin to that of an infant, it was genuine intelligence.\n\"Heavenly Dao Consciousness, Consciousness of All Living Beings...\"\nA sense of clarity arose in Li Hu’s heart.\nIf the world were equivalent to a human body, then the Heavenly Dao Consciousness would be like the soul of that body.\nAnd all the living things within the world, including humans, beasts, plants, and everything, were akin to the myriad cells within a body.\nThe philosophy of a previous life stated that the human body is a microcosm, and this was indeed quite accurate.\nThe cycle of all things in the world is similar to the cycles within the human body.\nLi Hu had come to this world and became a part of it, though as part of countless life forms, his individual importance was negligible.\nHowever, when he ascended to become a Celestial Being and experienced sublimation, as a part of all living things, this trace of sublimation was like a spiritual mechanism, bringing a billionth probability of change to the vast consciousness of all living beings, giving rise to intelligence.\n\"Indeed, as an amalgamation of Heaven and Earth, to it, whether humans, plants, or animals, are just cells within its body. There is no distinction of good or bad, nor any differentiation of intimacy or distance. The great Dao is impartial, and promoting plants and beasts to evolve into demon beasts is only natural.\"\nIn this way, some doubts were naturally resolved.\nHowever,\nboth the Martial Ancestor and the Dao Ancestor should have transcended Celestial Beings back then, reaching a mysterious and inscrutable Realm.\nSo why, at that time, did they not cause the consciousness of all living beings to produce intelligence?\nAnd what about that strange stone from beyond the heavens?\nWhere exactly did it come from?\nWhat happened back then, why was there not a single trace or record left about the Dao Ancestor, as if an invisible hand had wiped clean all records, leaving only the deeply ingrained title of Dao Ancestor in people’s minds?\nAs for why the Dao Ancestor was called the Dao Ancestor, no one knew.\nAnd back then, where did the Dao Ancestor and Martial Ancestor go? Did they die of old age in the Hidden Valley, ascend to the Immortal Realm, or hide in some corner of the world, smiling at the rise and fall of worldly events?\nNo one knows.\nEven now, as Li Hu’s power grows day by day, he himself does not know what Realm he has reached, deciphering the mysteries of Heaven and Earth, yet he cannot deduce the reason.\n\"Forget it, I am not an archaeological historian. Even if something really happened in ancient times, so what? What I need to do now is break through the world’s constraints and leverage the remaining power of the Gate of Truth to return to my original form.\"\nSlightly shaking his head, he suppressed the myriad thoughts in his mind.\nLi Hu was not particularly interested in pursuing the truth hidden in history back then.\nThe immediate task of spreading martial arts across the world and transforming it was what truly required attention.\nWith a wave of his sleeve, the void ahead shifted, like a whirlpool on a lake surface, rippling with waves and turning into a mirror.\nThrough the mirror, Li Hu’s gaze swept over, monitoring everything happening within the Secret Realm, observing the development of the seeds he had sown.\n...\nThe years in the Martial World age people, one generation of youth replaces the old.\nThis had always been the cycle of the Martial World for thousands of years, with geniuses born in every era, dominating their contemporaries with renowned prowess in the Martial World.\nThere were also prominent figures from previous generations who retreated into obscurity, disappearing from the Martial World.\nStories of influential figures never cease, and neither do the tangled webs of grudges and feuds.\nThis is Jianghu.\nHowever, ever since that one person on Jade Capital Mountain subdued a Grandmaster with a mere note three years ago, expounding the Dao to the world and opening the path to eternal life,\nthe entire Martial World has been set ablaze.\nThe era of the Martial World has since ended.\nFollowing this is an era of great contention for the new generation!\nCountless martial artists, whether young prodigies or retired veterans from secluded mountains, all became frenzied for the opening Secret Realm.\nThe rich Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi, bountiful heavenly materials, immensely powerful Divine Weapons, Divine Pills that could propel one to great heights, and the Divine Skill Secret Manuals pointing directly to the Daoist Techniques.\nNoble families, sects, and countless martial artists surged into the Secret Realm in search of resources.\nIf possible, no one would refuse eternal life, no one would refuse to traverse the Netherworld and soar through the nine heavens.\nStruggle, conflict.\nSurvival of the fittest, the strong prevail, this is the characteristic of the era of great contention for the new generation.\nBut, in this new era,\nhumans are destined not to be the sole actors on this stage of Heaven and Earth.\nWhen martial artists, seeking opportunities in the Secret Realm, suffered great casualties, when those who escaped came back with rich spoils, when they tearfully recounted their near-death experiences against terrifying demon beasts,\neverything within the Secret Realm gradually revealed itself to the world.\nIt was vast, abundant in Primordial Qi, with heavenly materials and treasures everywhere, home to countless terrifying demon beasts, where many martial artists perished in the jaws of those fearsome creatures.\nThe information brought back by escaping martial artists shook the entire world.\nEspecially the news about those powerful demon beasts, possessing immense strength, that even Grandmaster level experts, if encountered, might not escape uninjured.\nAnd the most terrifying part was, those Great Demons possessed very high intelligence!\nThe release of this news caused a worldwide uproar.\nUntil this moment, only then did the world truly realize that a new era was about to descend!\nThis was an unprecedented major transformation in the human world for thousands of years, where humans could cultivate for eternal life, and humans in the world would no longer be the only rulers.\nIn this treacherous and unpredictable world, some were bewildered and at a loss, while others forged ahead relentlessly.\nAs time passed, one by one, martial artists returned from the Secret Realm, and the vast Secret Realm began to gradually unveil its mysterious veil.\nTo better explore, a naturally established small town quickly rose near the entrance of the Secret Realm, becoming the frontline base for various forces exploring the Secret Realm.\nMany martial artists, wandering swordsmen would purchase information within the town before entering the Secret Realm, trading Divine Weapons, Elixirs, etc., and various resources harvested from the Secret Realm would circulate to every corner of the world through the town.\nGradually, the town transformed into a massive Market.",

      "content": "Chapter 363: Chapter 34: Market Evolution (Second Update)\nRelying on the abundant resources produced by the Secret Realm, various Spirit Medicine and Spirit Material, and Demon Beast corpses flow through the frontier of the Secret Realm, then spread to all corners of the world.\nWith a large number of transactions taking place, a new type of market, evolved from a small town, began to rise.\nDisciples and masters of Sects, descendants of prominent families, wanderers of the Martial World, people from all walks of life gathered in the market, bringing massive crowds to the area.\nAt the same time, as the teachings of Li Hu at Jade Capital Mountain spread, some talented individuals who grasped a little essence of Alchemy and Artifact Refining, claimed themselves as Alchemists and Artifact Refiners, set up shops in the market, handling resources brought from the Secret Realm by various wanderers of the Martial World.\nThey refined Spirit Medicine into Elixirs that could enhance Cultivation, and crafted Spirit Material and minerals into Divine Weapon and Magical Artifact that greatly boosted individual power.\nThe market became an important transfer station.\nElixirs and Divine Weapon and Magical Artifact are ultimately closely related to Cultivation and power.\nTherefore, with the Secret Realm’s abundant output, Alchemists and Artifact Refiners also started to gain attention and develop.\nIf not for the talent required in Alchemy and Artifact Refining, along with the need for substantial resources for practice, the conditions to become a true Alchemist or Artifact Refiner would not be so harsh, and Alchemy and Artifact Refining would likely have already become basic skills learned by Martial Artists.\nWith the advent of Alchemists and Artifact Refiners, the once invaluable Divine Elixirs and Divine Weapon began to appear extensively on the market.\nMany years ago, a Great Rejuvenation Pill from Shaolin Temple that increased twenty years of Power was still an unattainable legend in the Martial World.\nSword Casting Manor had to spend the energy of three generations of Master Swordsmiths over a century to forge a single Divine Weapon.\nBut now, with the rise of new Alchemists and Artifact Refiners, those previously unattainable precious treasures began to appear in large quantities.\nAs long as you can bring enough Spirit Medicine from the Secret Realm or precious Spirit Minerals and Materials, and prepare sufficient compensation, any Alchemist or Artifact Refiner could provide you with a Spirit Pill comparable to the efficacy of Shaolin Temple’s Great Rejuvenation Pill, or a Divine Weapon and Magical Artifact comparable to Sword Casting Manor’s peerless Divine Sword.\nThis is the progress of the era, also the result of Li Hu’s teachings.\nAside from Alchemists and Artifact Refiners, various side arts like Array Masters, Talisman Masters, Mechanicians, Puppet Masters in the market are also gradually rising.\nIn previous Martial World duels, the outcome was typically determined by one’s Power and Martial Techniques.\nBut in today’s new era of great struggle, perhaps when you exhaust your opponent, they might suddenly swallow an Elixir to restore Primordial Qi, or suddenly unleash a powerful Talisman for a reversal kill.\nIn this grand epoch, in battles among Cultivators, Martial Arts is no longer the sole determining factor of victory.\nElixirs, Divine Weapons, Talismans, even Arrays and Puppets, all constitute part of the combat power.\nThe emergence of various new items has brought significant impact to the ancient combat methods of the Martial World.\nThis impact is gradually spreading from the market to the whole world.\nBecause relying on the Secret Realm, and its numerous output resources, Alchemists and Artifact Refiners can produce more Elixirs and Divine Weapon and Magical Artifact, spreading across the world through traveling merchants.\nUnder the collision of this grand era, ancient techniques will inevitably be phased out due to falling behind.\nIn various regions within the Secret Realm, various dangerous Demon Beasts and lurking peers are the most perilous enemies for Martial Artists exploring the Secret Realm.\nIn the Secret Realm’s brutal and bloody battlefields, only greater combat power forms the foundation and assurance for Martial Artists to stand firm.\nFor Martial Artists exploring the Secret Realm, they are more inclined to accept various Elixirs, Divine Weapon and Magical Artifact, Mechanical Puppets, Arrays, and other items that could greatly enhance their combat power.\nOver time, while ancient traditions of the Martial World still exist in farther places, the Secret Realm and market have already become the forefront of melee with Elixirs, Divine Weapon and Magical Artifact, Talismans, etc.\nThis is the progress of the new era, which no one can resist.\nOf course, while Elixirs and Divine Weapon and Magical Artifact can improve Martial Artists’ strength to some extent.\nThese are only supplementary means.\nThe truly important thing is one’s own Cultivation.\nIf the gap between Cultivation Levels becomes too large, the effectiveness of these external items becomes very limited.\nAside from the rise of Elixirs, Divine Weapon and Magical Artifact, Talismans, Arrays, Mechanical Puppets, and other new things.\nWith the opening of the Secret Realm, changes in Martial Arts Techniques have also appeared.\nIn battles with the Secret Realm’s Demon Beasts and various dangers,\nMartial Artists exploring the Secret Realm began to discover the traditional Martial Arts were not very effective against enemies.\nTherefore, these fighters at the forefront started trying to improve and enhance their Martial Arts according to Li Hu’s teachings, progressing significantly toward fantasy and the Immortal side.\nLi Hu has made clear two paths at the Jade Capital Mountain lectures.\nMartial Artists only need to follow the foundational systems provided by Li Hu, making appropriate improvements to convert their martial techniques into fantasy or cultivation techniques, greatly enhancing their power.\nDuring the gradual transformation process, each Martial Arts technique improved had different effects.\nFor a time, in the frontier market established relying on the Secret Realm, a situation of a hundred flowers blooming appeared.\nAs this serves as the forefront of the world-changing battle front.\nThe existence of the market has become one of the places Martial Artists from all over the world must visit to broaden their knowledge.\nEven if Martial Artists do not enter the Secret Realm to explore, while traveling the world, they inevitably come to this market to see and broaden their horizons.\nDuring this period, numerous stories naturally unfold.\nCertain disciples from small remote Sects and families, upon entering the market, are like country bumpkins entering the city, dazzled by all the new items.\nWhen the Martial World they remembered was still in the era of blades and swords clashing, Martial Art competitions, and passionate Martial World,\nSuddenly, seeing various powerful Spirit Pills, Magical Artifacts with incredible powers, various mysterious Talismans, Arrays, Mechanical Puppets, and seeing people fly with swords outside the market, their True Essence forming wings to soar the skies, what an experience it was.\nThe worldview built from childhood was challenged to an unimaginable extent under such circumstances!\nThe feeling was like walking out of the poorest primitive tribe in Africa, into the center of a modern city with towering skyscrapers.\nIt was like ancient people from a previous era seeing cars and planes for the first time, being completely astounded.\nNot long ago, a hidden family’s genius, carrying the mission to shock the world and uphold the family name, descended from the mountain, intending to become famous worldwide.\nAfter hearing about the Secret Realm and the market in the Martial World, they eagerly ventured to the market.\nTheir experiences almost shattered their Dao Heart.\nAfter half a life of practicing Martial Arts and honing Inner Power, mastering the Seventy-Two Weapon Techniques, practicing diligently daily, they emerged to uphold their name, only to find this world was a fantasy Immortal world capable of anything.\nWhat a frustrating realization.\nAs the era proceeds, the market established relying on the Secret Realm continues to push forward amidst this clash of new and old perspectives, constantly growing.\nWith the continuous evolution of the cultivation system, the influence of the market is also gradually increasing.\nOn the frontier of this Secret Realm, initially, it started as a small town, solving the accommodation and food needs of Martial Artists exploring the Secret Realm.\nBut soon, with the large output of heavenly treasures from the Secret Realm and the transactions taking place, it gradually formed into a market.\nUltimately, the market continuously developed, rapidly forming into a giant city.\nCountless eyes from around the world focus here, becoming the newest forefront of the world’s great transformation.",

      "content": "Chapter 364: Chapter 035 Celestial Emperor Position (Third Update)\nTime slowly passed, and in the blink of an eye, three years had gone by.\nWith the opening of the first Secret Realm and the establishment of the first Market, various Cultivation Systems gradually upgraded, marking the beginning of a brilliant and glorious era.\nIn this era, the old Martial World had already ended, and new Legends were gradually unfolding.\nLi Hu’s initial arrangements also began to gradually bear fruit.\nOne after another, prodigies of the era and lucky individuals gained the opportunities left by Li Hu, starting to stand out and show their own brilliance in the new era, stirring up the world.\nAnd Li Hu, still high above on Jade Capital Mountain, silently watched all this from the shadows.\nJust like the hidden mastermind manipulating the changes in the world.\nThe entire Divine Land World steadily moved from a pure Martial Hero World style towards a fantastical Immortal Hero Dao style.\nAnd during this period, Li Hu also collected a large amount of sample materials through the Cultivation paths of countless Cultivators, beginning to perfect the two transcendence paths he had created.\nHowever, there were some unexpected events in between.\n\"I didn’t expect that it would turn out this way in the end...\"\nOn Jade Capital Mountain, Li Hu, as if suspended in a different dimensional space, revealed a look of being at a loss whether to laugh or cry.\nEverything he did in this world was to achieve the purpose of shattering the void or Crossing Tribulation and Ascending, breaking the world’s constraints on himself, and then relying on the Gate of Truth deep within his soul to return to the Main World.\nHowever, the pathway to shattering the void had not been completed, and the attempt to Cross Tribulation and Ascend had not yet been undertaken.\nLi Hu now, however, had already acquired the ability to leave this world in advance.\nThat’s right, the world’s constraints on him had vanished.\nHe could already return to the Main World through the Gate of Truth deep within his soul now!\n\"Does this count as the flowers not blooming despite deliberate planting, but the willows growing without intent?\"\nLi Hu was somewhat speechless.\nAll of this, to speak of it, was still related to the transformation of the world.\nIn these three years, with the opening of the Secret Realms, a large amount of Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi began to flood into various parts of the world.\nAt the same time, the Secret Realms produced a large amount of Elixirs crafted from heavenly materials and earthly treasures that enhanced Cultivation.\nThere was also the exploration of fantasy-style, Immortal-Dao style Cultivation Techniques.\nAll these reasons allowed the power of a large number of Martial Artists to improve, ultimately raising the strength of the entire Cultivation Realm by one level.\nThis era of grand competition, in another sense,\nwas the hidden hand Li Hu leveraging unparalleled methods to stir up the wave of Spiritual Qi Revival.\nWhat Li Hu did, even though it was only for himself, was precisely because of his actions that Heaven and Earth were given an opportunity to ascend, and the mechanized Heavenly Dao developed wisdom.\nThis kind of behavior brought about great merit to Heaven and Earth.\nAs he spoke of the Dao to all beings, opening up the great path for them, he was later favored by Heaven and Earth.\nTherefore, as the world gradually ascended throughout these years, Li Hu imperceptibly gained the fortune and position akin to that of a Celestial Emperor.\nThis was feedback from the Heavenly Dao Consciousness to Li Hu as the strength of the entire world continued to elevate.\nThe Secret Realm established by Li Hu was picked by the Heavenly Dao Consciousness, but it was not without compensation.\nThe Heavenly Dao Consciousness’ compensation was granting Li Hu the Heaven and Earth Authority to manage all beings, essentially the Celestial Emperor Position.\nAs Celestial Emperor, he ruled over everything in the world.\nThis was also the Heavenly Dao Consciousness’s affirmation of him, as well as the reward for picking the fruit that Li Hu had planted.\nOf course, even without the Heavenly Dao’s confirmation,\nLi Hu, given his impact on the world, naturally held transcendent privileges as the world ascended.\nMuch like Hong Jun in the novels of ancient legends in his past life.\nThe Heavenly Dao Consciousness’s affirmation was merely the icing on the cake.\nAnd under this transcendent position, Li Hu possessed the ability to transcend the world.\nThe world’s constraints on him had completely disappeared.\nThis resulted in Li Hu being able to return to the Main World through the Gate of Truth deep within his soul.\n\"Is this what it means to achieve sanctification through merit like in the ancient legends?\"\nOriginally, he was wholeheartedly focused on developing the pathways of shattering the void and Crossing Tribulation and Ascending, yet the unintentional fruits he planted led him to achieve his ultimate objective unexpectedly.\nThis can only be said to be unexpected, yet reasonable.\nLi Hu’s Celestial Emperor Position was in place even before the awakening of the Heavenly Dao Consciousness.\nAnd after all, the Heavenly Dao is the collective consciousness of all beings, and the grand way is fair; even though it developed awareness, it would have no personal bias.\nThe relationship between Li Hu and the Heavenly Dao Consciousness was akin to the relationship between later shareholders and founders of a company.\nLi Hu was the founder, the helmsman, possessing absolute managerial rights, while the Heavenly Dao Consciousness was a shareholder with ownership but without management rights, which rested with Li Hu, who held the Celestial Emperor Position.\nMoreover, in this world, Li Hu’s Celestial Emperor was far superior to the Heaven Emperor Haotian in the legendary ancient world.\nNo one could bind him.\n\"It’s a pity, though this world is good, it’s ultimately not the world I’m meant to linger in forever.\"\nFor a moment, Li Hu felt an urge to remain in this world indefinitely.\nBut quickly, this thought was cast aside.\nBecause, although he could act with impunity in this world, undefeated in the realm,\nwhat difference was it from a Martial Artist dominating a village or a pond?\nThe stage he needed was a bigger world beyond, a greater Multi-universe!\nAnd all of these were not what this world could offer.\n\"Let’s leave for now; so many years have passed, I wonder how the other side of the Main World is doing.\"\nLi Hu pondered for a moment and had already made up his mind.\nIt’s just a pity that after staying here for so many years, he really had some reluctance.\nLi Hu sighed softly, his gaze somewhat deep.\nHowever, the next moment, an inspiration suddenly flashed through his mind.\n\"Although I am merely returning to the Seta Continent, it doesn’t mean I have to abandon this world! This world still holds great value, especially as it is currently undergoing intense transformation, and after its ascension is complete, the benefits will only be greater, not to mention that I currently occupy the Celestial Emperor Position, of which completely abandoning would result in too much loss!\"\nUnwilling to give up.\nThus, Li Hu thought of a compromise.\nWithin the body in this world, he would leave a strand of Split Soul as an extension, overseeing the world, to wait for the day he returns to reap the harvest.\nThe Martial Hero World naturally didn’t have the operation of Split Soul, but the Immortal Hero Dao that Li Hu created did.\nSlicing off a piece of Split Soul hardly affected the main body.\nAfter all, even after the Divine Sense was split, it could regenerate automatically.\nAnd as his Divine Fragment, it could also oversee this world and direct all the progressive transformations.\nHe acted immediately upon thought.\nLi Hu promptly began retreating to split his Divine Soul.\nAfter several days, he successfully sliced off a strand of Divine Soul.\nOnce he confirmed there were no issues,\nhe sent a message through the void, instructing those disciples he had taken under his name to descend the mountain, and notifying the Daoist Child on Jade Capital Mountain that he was about to go into seclusion.\nSubsequently, Jade Capital Mountain was completely sealed off.\nLi Hu’s body was controlled by the Split Soul.\nAnd Austin’s Spiritual Body, by invoking the Gate of Truth within his mind, returned to the main body in the Main World.",

If time flowed the same way in the Main World, thirty to forty years without eating or drinking—even though the Giant Dragon Race can sleep for decades—would leave the body as a skeleton if returned unprepared.\nFortunately, the worst-case scenario did not occur.\nJust a little unfamiliar with his body, but he quickly recovered.\nLooking around, aside from the disappearance of the Gate of Truth’s base, nothing else has changed.\nThe traces left when he entered this space were still fresh, indicating it hadn’t been very long.\nPerhaps, the flow of time between worlds is different?\nSoon, Austin composed himself.\n\"After all the hardships, I’ve finally returned!\"\nTaking some time to readjust to his body, Austin mused inwardly.\nThe unexpected travel was simply an unforeseen journey in his dragon life.\nHis foundation remains in this world.\nLuckily, the gains from this trip weren’t bad.\nFirstly, within the Split Soul, there was still a faint connection present.\nThough separated by vast distances between worlds, relying on the Fragment of the Gate of Truth within his soul, he managed to achieve mutual sensing.\nVery well.\nAlthough specific information couldn’t be transmitted, retaining a sense was already very good.\nAfter all, the Celestial Emperor Position, ruler of worlds, and the world undergoing elevation—\nThe grand opportunities involved are not easily encountered.\nIn the future, with time, he can use this connection to return to that world and reap some benefits.\nWith the most important gains preserved, Austin felt content.\nSecondly, it’s about the martial arts honed in that world.\nThe Martial Arts Cultivation left with Li Hu’s Divine Fragment in the Martial Hero World.\nThe extensive martial arts knowledge and the formidable realm he once reached were brought back together.\nHowever, upon attempting cultivation, it proved futile.\nMartial arts cannot be replicated in this world.\nPerhaps due to differing world rules, neither the martial arts’ inner power nor Li Hu’s self-created mystical fantasy martial arts techniques could be cultivated here.\nThe outcome was anticipated.\nAfter all, this world does not have the concept of meridians.\nOf course, he tried it himself, realizing the dragon’s physique and beastman, human physique were different. Only testing Clan cultivation could truly confirm it.\nHowever, Austin did not have high expectations.\nNevertheless, this doesn’t mean the martial arts knowledge absorbed in the Martial Hero World is useless.\nIn that world, he transcended martial arts, becoming a creator of his own grand path.\nEven if inner power true Qi cannot be refined, there’s still fighting Qi.\nThis world doesn’t have chakra, yet he could still borrow its principles to create Magic Power Rasengan.\nPower resembles principles; using these experiences to establish a new system is not difficult.\nEspecially for Austin.\nWith the experience of creating mystical fantasy martial arts, adapting fighting Qi for cultivation is simple.\nPlus, elixirs, artifact refining, array techniques, etc.,\nEven if they can’t be realized here, using principles, a new system can be created.\nThe decades of experience and knowledge wealth from the Martial Hero World are one of the biggest gains from his trip.\nAside from the above, the last gain is the elevation of his realm and vision.\nIn the Martial Hero World, Austin held the Celestial Emperor Position.\nHis strength gradually surpassed that of a Celestial Being as time passed.\nAt that time, Li Hu didn’t know what realm he had truly reached, but at least he could sense his power was comparable to Legendary in this world, advancing towards Epic!\nThis means,\nThrough this journey, Austin’s vision stood above the Legendary Realm!\nSpiritual soul cultivation is not based on physical power.\nReturning to his body, the spiritual soul gains were entirely brought back from the Martial Hero World.\nBefore the crossing, though Austin’s body had reached the Half-Legendary Realm,\nThe higher Legendary Realm remained elusive.\nA bottleneck as insurmountable as a chasm lay ahead.\nBut now, with Austin’s soul returning to his body, the path ahead was clear as day.\nThe grand path was wide open, no bottleneck remained.\nGiven sufficient Magic Power, he could ascend to Legendary in no time!\nMoreover, the soul gains weren’t just limited to this.\nBecause he had reached a higher realm, his understanding and use of power deepened.\nJust like a former Grandmaster, even if the realm regressed, possessing deeper martial arts understanding, his strength surpasses others of the same level.\nIgnoring other factors, this higher level of power understanding alone could increase Austin’s strength by more than a fold!\nAnd with his body’s cultivation level enhancement, this increase would grow.\n\"Though this crossing was a dangerous accident, a slight misstep and I would’ve been trapped in the Martial Hero World forever unable to transcend, the great danger paired with immense rewards.\"\nFor a while, towards the unwelcome guest in the depths of his soul’s sea of consciousness, Austin felt conflicted.\nDespite the substantial gains, unless necessary, Austin wouldn’t employ that thing again.\nThis time luck held, taking his soul to the Martial Hero World, at least offering a chance for transcendence.\nIf he were dragged to a modern world with Extraordinary hidden, that would be real trouble.\nNo superpowers, unable to cultivate or transcend, his end would be trapped in those worlds, aging and dying.\nThese probabilistic experiments, it’s best not to attempt.\n\"However, if the components of the Gate of Truth could be found and restored, could dimensional travel through the Multi-universe be done freely, resolving the flaw of going without return?\"\nAustin pondered silently in his heart.\nSuddenly, he thought of the Beastman Royal Court at the heart of the Kawa Great Forest.\nThe Pure-blooded Beastmen there hold some fragments of the Gate of Truth!",

In the case of any unexpected events, ultimately, he could rely only on his own strength.\n\"First, enhance my strength. At least reach the Legendary stage before the great battle, to qualify for reaping benefits amidst the chaos!\"\nIn an instant, Austin had made up his mind.\nDue to the crossing, the path to the realm ahead was clear, with no obstacles, except for the lack of sufficient Magic Power.\n\"The location of the Dragon’s Nest is rather remote, and even if the whole Dragon Nest Tribe is mobilized, gathering enough magic resources is difficult, unless destructively mining the various Magic Ore Veins, but that’s impossible; depending solely on the Clan Tribe to gather magic is still a bit slow.\"\nAustin began to ponder.\nTo elevate his strength and collect more Magic Power for his breakthrough, additional auxiliary methods were needed.\nIn the end, Austin turned his gaze to the numerous martial arts memories he had brought back.\n\"Perhaps, I can perform a magic modification on a martial art that devours the Magic Power between heaven and earth for support.\"\nIn the Martial Hero World, there existed a heretical martial art that absorbed others’ power for one’s use.\nBack when Li Hu traveled the world, he naturally acquired and studied this martial art.\nUnfortunately, no matter how it was researched and optimized, the issue of chaotic True Qi from absorbing others’ power couldn’t be resolved.\nThat path was too narrow, unable to reach the other shore.\nIn the end, Li Hu had to modify it to devour Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi for one’s own use.\nUnfortunately, the human body was too fragile to withstand the massive, explosive Primordial Qi’s erosion, and unprocessed Primordial Qi entering the meridians would only blow a person to bloody pieces.\nUltimately, that martial art came to an unsatisfactory end, left untouched by Li Hu in a corner.\n\"The human body is fragile and can’t withstand the influx of Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi, but the body of a Giant Dragon is different. Moreover, my original body has been tempered by lava and further compressed and refined by the Law of Power, making it almost as tough as a Divine Weapon, fundamentally unafraid of Heaven and Earth Power’s impact.\"\n\"What’s more, while the Heaven and Earth in the Martial Hero World is filled with Primordial Qi, this world is imbued with Magic Power, which, unlike uncontrolled Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi, can be manipulated with strong Spiritual Power.\"\n\"By altering this technique to a Secret Technique that devours the Magic Power of heaven and earth, perhaps I could greatly reduce the time needed to accumulate magic power and advance to Legendary!\"\nA decision had already been made in his heart, but Austin was not in a hurry.\nApart from his cultivation level, he also needed to enhance his combat methods.\nThe divine sword forged with the Law still resided within his dragon body, being nourished by the dragon’s might and vast Magic Power.\nInitially condensing the Law Divine Sword was a result of delving deeply into the concepts from novels he had read in his previous life, trying different approaches.\nNow, after decades of experience in the Martial Hero World, he also learned about numerous secret techniques in the Martial World for nurturing the Law Divine Sword.\nWith his expanded perspective, the way to nurture the Law Divine Sword had to be improved, and he had even better methods now.\nThen there was the issue of the Four Spirits Sword Array.\nPreviously, when Austin crafted the Four Spirits Sword Array, he merely relied on the mysterious connection between the four Law Divine Swords and the imagined images of the four Holy Beasts to stabilize it, thus achieving the sword array.\nThis method was extremely crude, akin to primitive humans sharpening a Wooden Spear as a weapon.\nHe knew how it worked but not why it worked, so he had to strain to make do.\nBut now, everything had changed.\nIn the Martial World, he had studied the discipline of array creations passed down by the Dao Ancestor.\nHis understanding of arrays was crystal clear.\nIn Austin’s current view, if he organized the layout of his simplistic Four Spirits Sword Array according to an array structure,\nits power could increase at least threefold!\nLastly, there was the application of the Law of Power and the development and application of the combination of the four swords.\nAll these required Austin to devote time and energy to research.\n\"So the next plan is to seclude myself, organize various knowledge systems, and boost my own strength as quickly as possible!\"\nAfter setting the upcoming plan, Austin stood up.\nWith a complex gaze, he glanced around the spatial area and then turned to leave it.\nAs soon as he stepped out, the space beneath the vortex seemed to lose some sustaining force, collapsing like a waterfall.\nThe spatial fluctuations shook violently, causing the ground to tremble faintly.\nClearly, without the support of the Gate of Truth, that space had collapsed.\nAt the bottom of the lake reservoir, nothing else remained.\nHe didn’t linger for long and flew swiftly towards the water’s surface.\nReturning to the tribe, Austin summoned a beastman, and only after inquiring did he learn that merely three days had passed.\nIn the Martial World, three to four decades had gone by, yet in the Main World, it had only been three short days.\nThe time difference was indeed astonishing.\nFortunately, due to Austin’s regular seclusion and cultivation, most major affairs had been handed over to Vini and other high-ranking beastmen, so there were no disturbances from his absence in those days.\nHowever, as the Dragon Nest Tribe developed rapidly and expanded, Vini and other high-level Dragon Nest Beastmen were starting to find their management capabilities stretched to the limit.\nIt was nearly ten years since Austin established the Dragon Nest Tribe and gathered the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nIn ten years, from having only seven and a half Kobolds, the Dragon Nest Tribe had grown to over 130,000 individuals, marching toward a population of 150,000.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe’s territory had expanded to a fourth outpost, connecting to form a vast area.\nAn enormous region, with a massive population.\nIn the Human World, it would even compare to some remote, weak Duchies.\nThis was reaching the limit of the talent and management ability of Vini and the other high-ranking members of the Dragon Nest Tribe.",

      "content": "Chapter 367: Chapter 38 Two Years (Part 3)\nThis is the limitation of talent.\nPerhaps Vini, Quik, and Rodney have been growing all along, but their growth simply cannot keep up with the development speed of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nLearning to manage requires talent as well, especially in the rapidly expanding situation of the Dragon Nest Tribe. To keep up with the degree of development, talent becomes all the more important.\nThis needs to change!\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe follows a military group strategy with military force at its core and production as a complement.\nIn the entire Clan Tribe, the army occupies the main part.\nIn terms of production, it is also organized and managed militarily during opening expansion and basic large-scale production.\nEvery Beastman, whether a wandering Beastman or a captured Beastman, old or young, must undergo military training transformation before becoming a member of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nIn this military system, each Beastman in management has struggled up from the bottom, carrying a lot of military style.\nThis semi-militarized group brings significant benefits to the management of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nHigh-efficiency execution and a militarized management system are the foundations for the rapid expansion of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nHowever, no system is perfect.\nAfter the initial stage of rapid expansion, especially with the sharp increase in population, base development, and land area growth, if one lacks certain talent, it is nearly impossible to sort out a large amount of affairs in an orderly manner.\nBack then, Kobold Vini was merely the leader of a destitute and near-extinct Kobold tribe.\nFox-faced Man Quik and Lizardman Rodney had similar origins.\nIf they had not met Austin, they would have remained insignificant wild Beastmen in the vast region of the Kawa Great Forest, dying unknown, with no one ever remembering them.\nInitially, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe had less than a hundred members, struggling to survive in the perilous forest. Who would have thought that the small Clan Tribe would grow to what it is today?\nNo one would have or dared to imagine.\nTheir talents were just among the ordinary.\nIf not for standing on Austin’s windfall, they could never have soared.\nThey understood this, and as the increasing affairs of the Dragon Nest Tribe became overwhelming, they had to submit their resignations to Austin.\n\"Your Highness, your loyal servant can no longer handle the increasingly complex government affairs. Please entrust the position of Tribe Governor to someone capable.\"\nInside the hall, looking at Vini deeply bowing his head, Austin’s heart was also complicated.\nAlthough most of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s development strategies were formulated by himself,\nVini also played a significant role in the tribe’s development process.\nAt least, it spared Austin from being entangled in these tedious matters, allowing him to focus wholeheartedly on cultivating his strength in seclusion.\nNo merits are without hardships.\nHowever, personal talent is ultimately a limitation.\nIf given a dozen years of experience, Vini might grow into a competent leader through extensive practice.\nBut as the Dragon Nest Tribe develops rapidly, those who cannot keep up are destined to be eliminated.\n\"Vini, you...\"\nInitially, Austin intended to comfort him and then promote some high-level Beastmen in the tribe to ease his burden.\nHowever, at that moment, Austin suddenly conceived an idea.\nDuring the days in the Martial Hero World, Li Hu laid the foundation for his future deification and sanctification by scanning countless books with his powerful Spiritual Power.\nSo, is it possible to borrow some secret techniques from that world to try to complete a spiritual connection of certain knowledge and memories, and instill them in others?\nIf possible, directly transferring certain management thoughts and concepts he encountered in his previous life into Vini’s mind, would it directly enhance his management talent?\nThis idea is worth a try!\n\"Vini, I have seen your loyalty. You should continue in this position for now. If it’s really unsustainable, first promote a few smart subordinates to help share the workload. I need to continue to retreat and advance for a period, and we will talk again when I emerge.\"\nAnother matter popped up.\nTo solve these issues, it’s necessary to first absorb and digest the knowledge foundation from the Martial Hero World and adapt it locally.\nAustin became more eager to absorb the gains from the Martial Hero World.\nHe needs time.\nFortunately, with the Celestial Dragon Island as a shield, the environment around the Dragon Nest Tribe remains stable for now.\nThus, Austin continues his retreat.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe continues as usual, rapidly expanding, reclaiming land, and clearing and assimilating wild creatures while vigorously developing occupied territories, collecting a large amount of Magic Resources to supply Austin’s strength enhancement.\nThe Water Patterned Demon Iron Ore from the Wet Bone Forest, the Refined Gold and Mithril from the Volcanic Cluster Domain, magic-infused fruits found in the wild, and some Magic Crystals produced in the wilderness.\nAll these are collected massively by Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nAnd then provided to Austin in seclusion.\nMeanwhile, Austin devours Magic Resources while organizing the extensive knowledge system in his mind.\nMartial Arts Secret Techniques are organized and optimized through comparisons with Magic Power Fighting Qi and others.\nDuring this digestion and exploration process, Austin’s foundation also steadily strengthens.\nEven though Austin’s dragon form prevents the cultivation of many martial techniques, and the fundamental Laws of the world make it difficult for Beastmen to cultivate those Inner Powers.\nYet various knowledge systems greatly enriched his understanding of power.\nIn this modifying process, the collision of different Extraordinary systems offers him immense inspiration.\nHis strength, in such a situation, grows stronger day by day.\nAs time slowly passes, the Dragon Nest Tribe develops steadily, and in the blink of an eye, two years have gone by.\nIn these two years, while Austin absorbs the Magic Resources supplied by the Dragon Nest Tribe, he continually digests and modifies the knowledge system from the Martial Hero World, creating a new cultivation system centered on Fighting Qi, Spiritual Power, Magic Power, etc.\nAfter two years of effort, he has digested over ninety percent of the accumulated knowledge.\nSimultaneously, his Level Cultivation has reached the pinnacle just below the Half-Legendary level.\nOnly a half-step away from crossing the bottleneck ahead and entering the Legendary Realm.\nFrom birth to Half-Legendary peak,\nin all, Austin’s body’s age is merely ten years.\nTen years, just a step away from entering Legendary.\nThis rate of improvement is truly astonishing!\nNot to mention that for long-lived creatures like the Giant Dragon, it often takes decades or even centuries to advance a Realm.\nEven among humans, nearing the Legendary in a decade is incredibly shocking!",

      "content": "Chapter 368: Chapter 039 - Significant Progress (First Update)\nOf course, this speed increase did not come without a price.\nThe price was the consumption of a large amount of magic resources that the Dragon Nest Tribe could obtain from the forest.\nIt can be said that Austin’s cultivation level is the result of being accumulated with a large amount of magic resources.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe played a tremendous role in this process.\nIf Austin were to collect the vast magic resources from the forest on his own, it would take years of effort.\nIt would even need more time due to the complexity.\nMoreover,\nduring these two years, Austin transformed a cultivation technique from the Martial Hero World into a secret technique that could directly absorb magic power from between heaven and earth.\nAfter improving that secret technique, Austin could directly absorb a vast amount of magic power from heaven and earth, refining it into his foundation and upgrading his cultivation level.\nThe magic absorbed through that Heaven-Devouring Secret Technique did not fall short of the magic resources supplied by the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nHowever, even so, it was only enough for Austin to elevate his cultivation level to the peak of Half-Legendary.\nThis vast amount of magic power seems enormous.\nBut in fact, it’s just the normal requirement for the Dragon Race’s advancement.\nA normal young dragon, in its early growth phase, has its parents’ care, and resources like magic crystals are almost never lacking.\nMoreover, the growth of an ordinary giant dragon considers centuries as a basic unit.\nA casual slumber can last for dozens or even hundreds of years.\nUnder normal circumstances, a dragon takes at least two to three hundred years from birth to adulthood.\nThat is to say,\nAustin’s current Half-Legendary peak level should spread over two to three hundred years to be normal.\nThe large amount of magic resources he consumed, averaged over two to three hundred years, is not particularly stunning.\nBut he compressed the time to advance to the peak of Half-Legendary into just a decade, so it appears that the consumption of magic resources is incredibly huge.\nIn this world, Austin is probably the only exception.\nDue to his traversal, his soul did not need to grow in slumber.\nAt the same time, born in the wild,\nwithout the shelter of a parent’s safe haven, his desire for power was extremely intense.\nWhen young dragons of the same era were playing under parental protection and sleeping soundly in the Dragon’s Nest, Austin was already surviving independently in the perilous wilderness, struggling amidst the dangers of magic beasts, giant beasts, and other terrifying predators.\nPrecisely because of this, when young dragons of the same era were still taking advantage of their bloodline advantages idly, Austin was striving diligently to elevate his level of cultivation.\nOne step at a time, to seek survival in this chaotic wilderness.\nPerhaps, it was due to witnessing Austin’s mindset, which was completely different from other young dragons, that Guppa was willing to associate and provide protection after only one chance encounter years ago.\nThe Giant Dragon Race has been complacent for too long, having a kind of unparalleled pride due to their bloodline, to the extent of not seeing their own flaws.\nWith their innate talent to reach Legendary adulthood strongly, they did not have to work hard to achieve the pinnacle of worldly force.\nBut precisely because of the bloodline’s shackles, power comes too easily, leaving them naturally lacking struggles necessary to reach the true pinnacle.\nThe Giant Dragon Race has many legends but extremely few epic ones who truly stand at the pinnacle of this world’s power.\nToday, the Giant Dragon Race is gradually exiting the stage of the Prime Material Plane.\nGuppa might have seen some new possibilities for the next generation of dragons in Austin.\nPerhaps, he hopes that Austin’s growth will bring about a slight change to the Giant Dragon Species.\n\"Half-Legendary peak, still lacking a bit.\"\nRegarding Guppa’s kindness back in the day, Austin naturally did not have much time to ponder.\nCurrently, within the great hall, Austin examined his own strength.\nOver the past two years, aided by continually absorbing magic resources, his cultivation level had also risen to the peak of Half-Legendary.\nSimultaneously, the substantial foundational knowledge from the Martial Hero World was reorganized over these two years, transforming it into his own strength suitable for this world.\nIn addition, there is also the understanding of the laws.\nWith a higher-level perspective, Austin’s understanding of the laws improved rapidly.\nThe Law of Thunder, the Law of Wind, the Law of Fire, the Law of Water, and the Law of Power, obtained from devouring the strength of the dark-marked tiger-man Vira.\nUnderstanding of these five Law Origins reached a very profound level.\nAs a Blue Dragon, with the Blue Dragon Bloodline containing the hidden origins of both the Law of Thunder and the Law of Wind.\nThis means that once Austin advances to Legendary, he will be able to comprehend and awaken, achieving complete mastery of two Law Origins.\nThe other three laws will also become more in-depth.\nMind you, a typical Legendary powerhouse can completely grasp only one or two Law Origins at most.\nBut as soon as Austin enters Legend, he will automatically master two Law Origins entirely.\nMoreover, he is very deep into the other three Law Origins.\nThis indicates that once Austin enters the Legendary Realm, even as a newcomer, he will stand among the strong within the Legendary Level!\n\"The nourishing method of the Law Divine Sword has been improved, the array effects of the Four Spirits Sword Array have been enhanced, and combined with deeper laws, the absorption of the Martial Hero World’s background of decades—all this, with my current strength, even a Legendary Level being might not necessarily defeat me!\"\nRasengan, the Law Divine Sword nurtured for two years, the Four Spirits Sword Array, Four Swords United, the Law of Power forging the body...\nWith all these enhancements, Austin now possesses the combat power of the Legendary Level!\nEven when facing a real Legendary, he does not fear in the least.\nThe Law Divine Sword, which has been nurtured for over two years, has now accumulated extremely terrifying power; once unleashed, combined with the Four Spirits Sword Array and techniques like the Four Swords United, it could instantly deliver heavy damage to a Legendary.\nIn an instant, Austin’s confidence swelled significantly.\n\"Regrettably, I ultimately couldn’t entirely step into the Legendary Realm; otherwise, I would have had more assurance in this current scheme!\"\nSomewhat regretful.\nThough the bottleneck before Legendary had long since disappeared for Austin,\nto undergo the Legendary transformation, the required magic power accumulation is indeed too massive.\nEven other dragon races accumulate enough over two to three hundred years.\nDespite the collection by the Clan Tribe and his own secret technique of absorbing the world’s magic power, there remains quite a considerable distance from reaching the level of transformation.\n\"Forget it, achieving such an improvement is already quite extensive.\"\nTwo years of seclusion, significant advancement in strength!",

      "content": "Chapter 369: Chapter 040: Current Situation of the Dragon Nest Tribe (Second Update)\nTwo years of secluded cultivation did not bring advancement to the Legendary realm.\nAlthough somewhat disappointing, Austin was not greatly surprised.\nThere’s no way around it; to rapidly ascend to Legendary status requires obtaining extremely pure magic material, like last time’s advancement to Half-Legendary when he acquired potent magic power material.\nFor example, an Elemental Core of Legendary level.\nBack then, Austin led the Dragon Nest Beastmen to eliminate the Fire Elemental Leader in the Volcanic Cluster Domain and consumed its Elemental Essence, thereby advancing to Half-Legendary.\nAnd now, if he wants to advance to Legendary in a short period, only a Legendary-level Elemental Essence could help him improve.\nOr, a Magic Beast Crystal Core of Legendary level could also work.\nThis is a higher-level metamorphosis, requiring higher-level energy to fulfill the demands of one’s transformation.\nOtherwise, even with the magic resources gathered by the Dragon Nest Tribe, despite having a Secret Technique for devouring the world’s magic, it would still take at least over ten years to gradually achieve a breakthrough.\nNo choice; though the Dragon Race is powerful,\nThis mighty power is not without cost, and the immense dragon body requires a massive accumulation and refinement of magic power.\nThe inherent talent of Giant Dragons results in them possessing hundreds to thousands of times more magic at the same level compared to humans.\nThus, to advance in realm, the magic resources consumed naturally need to be hundreds to thousands of times greater.\nWith gains come losses, the world is very fair.\n\"Elemental Essence from a leader is rare, and a Legendary-level Magic Beast Crystal Core is hard to obtain; it seems we’ll have to wait for future opportunities.\"\nEven a magic beast without intelligence will undergo metamorphosis upon advancing to Legendary.\nIf a Golden-level magic beast’s intelligence remains beast-like, then upon transforming into a Legendary-level magic beast, its intelligence becomes nearly human-like.\nSome Legendary-level magic beasts even learn Transformation Techniques from human mages, turning into humans to mingle and play in the human world.\nIn this situation, obtaining a Legendary-level Magic Beast Crystal Core is as hard as climbing the sky.\nLegendary realm, seeking urgently cannot achieve.\nBut it doesn’t matter; anyway, with his current strength, even a Legendary doesn’t intimidate him, plus he has the backing of that Celestial Dragon Island, allowing quite a bit of calm time without needing to rush.\nTaking a long breath, Austin decided to end his seclusion.\nTwo years in seclusion, his limbs had become somewhat numb.\nUncertain about the current state of the Dragon Nest Tribe after two years of development,\nIt’s time to go out and take a look.\nThinking of this, Austin spread his huge wings, took flight, and left his place of seclusion.\n...\nIn the span of two years, the development of the Dragon Nest Tribe was rapid.\nIts population had already broken through 200,000 people, gradually approaching 300,000.\nPopulation explosion among Beastmen!\nThe cause for this was not just the absorption of new Beastmen.\nMany new Beastmen were born within the Dragon Nest Tribe, and a large number of native births contributed to the swift increase in the population of Beastmen in the tribe.\nAnd during the population boom, the number of bases established by the Dragon Nest Tribe had reached seven.\nSeven bases, centered around Dragon Nest Base City, spread outwards like a web.\nLarge expanses of territory, centered around the bases, interconnected, firmly grasped.\nAs many monsters, beasts were cleared, vast plains were expanded upon.\nWith the help of elves, the Dragon Nest Beastmen engaged in large-scale land reclamation, benefiting from the excellent climate of Kawa Great Forest to achieve abundant harvests every quarter.\nNow, regarding food, the Dragon Nest Tribe had thoroughly freed itself from the constraints of food scarcity.\nWithout the shackles of lacking food, it meant that the Dragon Nest Tribe’s military actions were more liberated.\nAs one by one, Beastman tribes outside were conquered and integrated, with their population merged and trained within the military system, laying the foundation for the perpetual strengthening of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAt the same time, the spread of the Breathing Technique through the merit point system and some Combat Techniques improved by Austin had increased the number of Extraordinary individuals, rapidly strengthening the tribe’s overall power.\nWith abundant food production from inside, and well-trained, battle-hardened military elites from outside.\nAdditionally, civilians responsible for production.\nThe systematized Dragon Nest Tribe had developed into the embryonic form of a kingdom, and this kingdom prototype had combat strength several times that of some smaller duchies.\nAnd now, the Dragon Nest Tribe truly became a local dominant force.\nRenowned far and wide.\nEvery year, numerous wandering Beastmen voluntarily came to join, while many impoverished Beastman tribes surrounding, faced with desperate situations, surrendered and accepted transformation into the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nFor in the face of nature’s disasters, the Dragon Nest Tribe was their only lifeline before impending death.\nBecause of this, during these two years, the percentage of the Dragon Nest Legion’s military actions to sweep and conquer other forest Beastman tribes had decreased progressively, as those familiar with the Dragon Nest Tribe’s reputation simply surrendered upon the Legion’s arrival.\nFor many struggling Beastmen standing between life and death, joining the Dragon Nest Tribe marked the beginning of a beautiful life.\nUnable to fear the dangers of the forest, without worry of never returning from seeking food within the forest, without concern for lacking food today and none tomorrow, ensuring safety and fullness daily.\nSuch life was an irresistible temptation for Beastmen struggling below the poverty line.\nSome bottom-tier outdoor Beastmen even eagerly awaited the day when the Dragon Nest Legion would arrive nearby, hoping to join the tribe.\nUnder this mindset, the willingness to resist among outdoor Beastmen was extremely low.\nConsequently, the Dragon Nest Tribe’s allocation of military power for conquering outdoor Beastman tribes steadily declined.\nCurrently, the Dragon Nest Legion’s main combat targets had shifted focus to the various monsters within the forest.\nTrolls, giant beasts, wolf packs, goblins, and other monsters traversing the forest significantly impacted the Dragon Nest Territory, especially those boars always inclined to destroy the crops planted by Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nOf course, clearing these nearby forest monsters was the ordinary Dragon Nest Beastmen army’s responsibility.\nAs for the most elite Extraordinary troops, they faced the hazardous zones within the forest, clearing groups of monsters with destructive power like magic beasts.\nThe magic resources expended by Austin for strengthening were sourced from the magic ore veins seized by the Extraordinary Beastmen troops during their monster nest clearing operations.\n\"Fortunately, it seems Vini has put some theories I transmitted to him into practice.\"\nAustin soared high above, looking down at the earth below, with fields stretching far and wide, lush with crops.\nRoads extended from the base city outward, spreading into the distance.\nConnections among Dragon Nest Tribe base city and its bases relied on these developed roads for transportation.\nBeastmen and elves worked uniformly under command in the fields.\nAnd beside the roads, the Dragon Nest Beastmen army was arranged in tight formations, swiftly passing through.",

      "content": "Chapter 370: Chapter 041 Development (Third Update)\nFrom a high vantage point, whether observing the city’s construction or the movement of the beastmen, the entire Dragon Nest Tribe appears orderly and exudes an unusual aesthetic, embodying the early form of a kingdom tribe.\nGazing at the bustling beastmen below, a sense of accomplishment welled up within Austin.\nA decade of struggle, starting from scratch.\nFinally, he had established a force of his own on this wild land!\nRecalling the past, when he had just been born, struggling to survive in the perilous forest, he dared not venture too far for fear of encountering formidable enemies in the dangerous wilderness.\nThose scenes of struggling to survive remain vivid in his memory.\nTwo years later, the slightly grown-up Austin encountered a defeated, wandering, and near-extinct Kobold tribe.\nFor survival, he decided to take in these few Kobolds as his clan.\nFrom that moment on, he embarked on a path of rapid development.\nWho would have thought that in just eight short years, the Dragon Nest Tribe, built on the brink of destruction of the Kobold tribe, would grow to its current state?\nStep by step, as if it was a lifetime ago.\nAustin soared high, not revealing his form.\nFrom south to north, he wanted to see with his own eyes the empire he had built.\nToday, the Dragon Nest Tribe has evolved into a stable military group system.\nThe ordinary beastmen militia is responsible for tilling the land, planting grain with the elves, while also handling routine patrols and simple guard duties.\nThe entire food supply of the Dragon Nest Tribe now primarily comes from agricultural production.\nBesides cultivated grain dominating, livestock farming, fishing, and cultivated mushrooms contribute a portion to the Dragon Nest Tribe’s food supply.\nParticularly in animal husbandry, relying on the taming of some docile wild animals, it has now reached a certain scale.\nThe tribe’s meat supply, apart from external hunting, largely comes from this animal husbandry.\nFurthermore, the tamed wild cattle, horses, and some Earth Rhinoceros Giant Beasts have made significant contributions to transportation.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe relies on the powerful transportation capabilities of these beasts to tightly control seven strongholds and expand outward, integrating the main city and strongholds into a cohesive unit, significantly strengthening the tribe’s power.\nApart from food, the next focus is tool manufacturing.\nOne must acknowledge that Austin’s decision to establish a Manufacturing Workshop to bring together skilled Goblins to focus on tool-making was a wise one.\nAs time spent in the workshop increased, the Goblins’ craftsmanship continually advanced.\nIt was as if they awakened an attribute in technology.\nVarious innovative tools gradually emerged from the Manufacturing Workshop.\nFrom early wooden spear processing platforms to water wheels for irrigation, to the blast system of the bronze and steel furnace.\nIn every aspect of the Dragon Nest Tribe, all sorts of tools produced by the Goblin Manufacturing Workshop facilitated the productive life of the Dragon Nest Beastmen.\nEspecially after annexing the Elf Kingdom.\nThe technologies possessed by various elves were assimilated, further enhancing the foundation of the Goblin Manufacturing Workshop.\nUntil now, having completed various technological accumulations, the Goblins, even following some of Austin’s ideas, began researching the power of steam.\nRecently, the Goblins have started attempting to create early steam engines.\nOf course, the prototype steam engines, with unresolved leakage issues, are practically useless.\nA severe accident almost occurred not long ago, nearly causing significant casualties.\nDespite the challenges, Austin holds considerable expectations for it.\nOnce the steam engine is successfully developed, it would then be possible to establish railway lines utilizing the forest’s abundant mineral resources, relying on the railroad’s formidable transportation capabilities to integrate the Dragon Nest Tribe’s strongholds and rapidly expand outward.\nThe steam engine is indeed a hallmark of the Industrial Revolution.\nOnce the technology accumulation of the First Industrial Revolution is completed, how far can the Second and even the Third Industrial Revolution be?\nAs the Goblin Manufacturing Workshop completes various technological accumulations and attempts to develop steam engines, progress is made in other areas as well.\nThe military capability needs no elaborate description,\nWith the development of steel blast furnaces and sufficient steel armors and weapons, the well-trained Dragon Nest Legion forms an unstoppable iron-clad torrent on the battlefield, with no opponent able to withstand this elite and terrifying force.\nThis is comparable to the elite legions of certain human duchies.\nAt the same time, investment in Extraordinary Ability Users did not diminish.\nRelying on Austin’s modified breathing cultivation techniques and the improved Beastman Six Techniques upon his return, every extraordinary beastman is elite amidst elites with extremely potent combat strength.\nThe improved Beastman Six Techniques, besides having strong offensive power, also possess the ability to modify physique and cultivate Fighting Qi.\nIf one could cultivate all six techniques to a profound level, they could undergo a metamorphosis and gain advanced abilities, although none of the Dragon Nest Beastmen have reached that realm yet.\nThe military power of the Dragon Nest Tribe has generally advanced along with the tribe.\nIn addition to these, a relatively important system within the tribe is the medical system Austin had someone establish.\nAfter years of development, accumulating various treatment experiences over the years, Dragon Nest Tribe’s medical system has reached a relatively sophisticated level.\nEspecially after Austin returned from the Martial Hero World, the comprehensive Chinese medicine system greatly inspired the medical system in the Otherworld.\nEven the human civilization of this world solely relies on priests’ divine techniques and alchemists’ healing potions for treatment, unlike the complete medical treatment system of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nIn this regard, the Dragon Nest Tribe is undoubtedly more advanced than human civilization.\nAt least for the broad ordinary populace, neither the divine techniques of priests nor the healing potions of alchemists are affordable.\nFalling ill means death.\nIn the slums, with cases of fever, the cheap doctors there only resort to bloodletting treatments.\nWhether in agriculture, military power, manufacturing workshops, or the medical system,\nEach of these constitutes the main force of the Dragon Nest Tribe, supporting the entire tribe’s rapid expansion and development.\nAustin spent the whole day, finally touring the entire domain of the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nAs he brimmed with pride, ready to return contentedly,\nSuddenly, a plume of thick smoke rose into the sky in the distance, accompanied by flames.\nIt was in the direction of the newly established seventh stronghold.\n\"Could it be an enemy attack?\"\nThis thought flashed in Austin’s mind, and after only a moment of hesitation, he immediately flew towards that direction.\nEven from a considerable distance, he could still sense the wave of Fighting Qi conflict explosion.\nWhoever that damn fellow is, daring to attack Lord Austin’s territory!\nHe must make those accursed enemies realize the outcome of offending Lord Austin!",

      "content": "Chapter 371: Chapter 42: Frost Giant (Fourth Update, Requesting Monthly Tickets)\nThe seventh stronghold of the Dragon Nest Tribe has been established hundreds of miles northeast of the main city.\nThat area is close to a plateau.\nFurther north, the temperature becomes increasingly cold, reaching a glacial plateau.\nThe Dragon Nest Tribe established a new seventh stronghold nearby due to a rather large magic crystal vein in the vicinity.\nAt the same time, the level of magic power in the surrounding area is relatively dense, with a good production of various magic resources.\nIf you go deeper into the glacial plateau, you can gain even more varied types of magic ores.\nIt can be said that this area is a relatively rich resource point.\nHowever, areas with abundant resources naturally attract stronger enemies.\nOn the glacial plateau, there is a group of Frost Giants inhabiting it.\nThese Frost Giants living on the plateau are extremely powerful in both physique and strength, with a violent temperament and a strong tendency for combat, frequently fighting even among their own tribe.\nBut due to their inclination for cold environments, they rarely venture down the plateau to loot.\nPlus, since the Dragon Nest Tribe’s military strength is not weak and Austin urgently needs magical resources, the Dragon Nest Tribe decided to establish a new stronghold near the magic crystal vein.\nAnyway, the magic crystal vein is at the bottom of the plateau, quite a distance from the Frost Giant Tribe, so there shouldn’t be any trouble.\nWhen the Dragon Nest Tribe established a stronghold, the nearby Frost Giant Tribe noticed the Dragon Nest Tribe’s new stronghold.\nRelying on teams transporting bison, wild horses, and Earth Rhinoceros Giant Beasts, a large amount of food supplies was sent near the stronghold.\nSimultaneously, the Dragon Nest Beastmen began constructing houses, defense works, gradually developing the stronghold.\nApart from this, they also merged with nearby native beastman tribes.\nWhile acquiring a large labor force, they found suitable crops for the local climate.\nThen they cultivated farmland and planted crops in the cleared fields.\nWith mature experience from colonial development systems, the seventh stronghold steadily got on track, and some grain crops began to yield, gradually forming a self-sufficient stronghold tribe system.\nThe formation of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s stronghold beneath the glacier was observed by the Frost Giants on the plateau.\nInitially, the barbaric Frost Giants didn’t care much about the little people beneath the glacier.\nHowever, as the Dragon Nest Tribe’s stronghold developed.\nIts population grew, its activity range expanded, naturally grabbing their attention.\nWhen the Frost Giants observed, they eventually discovered the Dragon Nest Tribe’s extremely rich food reserves.\nThis cannot go unchecked!\nEven though the Frost Giants are the undisputed overlords on the glacial plateau, the environment means that even dominating the plateau, the hunting produced is not rich. At times, these highly digestible Frost Giants in hunger would have to chop down trees to chew as bread.\nThe abundant food supplies of the Dragon Nest Tribe’s stronghold naturally incited the Frost Giants’ greed.\nBefore the cold winter arrived, the raid was bound to happen.\nOn this day,\nGigantic figures with rough animal hides covering key parts, wielding unknown beast bone weapons, their skin ice blue, resembling enlarged primitive humans like Frost Giants descended the mountain.\nTheir steps on the ground made the earth rumble.\nThe Frost Giant’s ranks appeared chaotic, akin to a band of wild robbers, devoid of any discipline, basically charging en masse towards the Dragon Nest Tribe’s stronghold.\nYet, even without any formation.\nJust their giant figures alone exuded an overwhelming suffocating force!\n\"Soldiers! Take up your weapons, the time has come to show loyalty to the great His Highness Austin!\"\nOn the simple city wall, former Mercenary Deputy Captain Gory raised his extraordinary weapon, shouting to the densely arrayed Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers behind him.\nAmong these Dragon Nest soldiers were some former companions from Gory’s mercenary corps.\nThey were among the few humans in the entire Dragon Nest Tribe.\n\"Long live His Highness!\"\n\"Long live His Highness Austin!\"\nBelow the wall, the neatly arrayed Dragon Nest soldiers showed no fear, raising their weapons and shouting loudly in unison, creating an echoing roar.\nThe beastmen soldiers eligible to join the development of the stronghold were seasoned elites.\nDuring their previous military careers, they had slain giant beasts, and these approaching beastmen attackers weren’t enough to scare them.\n\"Prepare, as usual, annihilate them!\"\nGory endeavored to rally the Dragon Nest Legion’s spirits, but inwardly cursed his misfortune.\nHe had barely climbed to the tribe’s upper echelon, appointed as the master of development.\nUnexpectedly unfortunate, encountering a Frost Giants raid.\nEven if the Frost Giant’s attack could be repelled, the war losses would be considerable, and unlucky circumstances could even lead to a breakthrough of the stronghold.\nThis, undoubtedly, would become a blemish on the record.\nGory enjoyed life within the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nBeing an early member, he was now considered upper echelon, wielding significant power in Dragon Nest Tribe.\nWith the rapid expansion of the Dragon Nest Tribe, the former thought of escaping with a secret technique has long vanished.\nWhat could he do upon returning to the Human World?\nContinue being a mercenary with unpredictable future?\nBetter luck could lead to joining a duchy’s military, surviving countless near-deaths to earn military merit, and eventually some discerning noble lord noticing him, promoting him briefly before retiring him with a simple title once his value was spent.\nThis lifestyle was not what he wanted.\nCompared to his status in the Dragon Nest Tribe, he wouldn’t give up everything to return to being a day-to-day mercenary.\nAs for his loyalty issue not being human-centric, that’s not a problem.\nMany human stewards served Golden Giant Dragons in this world, and compared to them, his position in power was far superior.\nOnce the Dragon Nest Tribe expands and reaches the borders of the human race, there won’t be a lack of human companionship.\nHe, Gory, was not shortsighted.\n\"Attack! Hit them hard!\"\nAs the Frost Giants closed in, Gory spit a mouthful and ordered loudly.\nInstantly, goblin crossbows on all sides of the wall fired a volley of sharp arrows like lightning, piercing the Frost Giant’s skin, causing immediate cries of agony.\nSimultaneously, the Dragon Nest Legion within the wall started striking out.\nWar erupted with a roar!\nAs the battle raged violently,\nAt this moment, on the glacial plateau.\nThe strong Frost Giant leader Albuda stood on high, observing everything unfolding on the battlefield below.\n\"Master Albuda, the sniffer dogs say, the little folk tribe beneath the glacier belongs to a blue dragon in the southwest. Wouldn’t our direct assault anger that blue dragon?\"\nAt this time, a Frost Giant warrior behind him voiced a question.\n\"No big deal, just a little blue dragon after all. Augustus, have you forgotten our ancestors who defeated the white dragons living on the glacier and conquered them as our backyard dogs!\"\n\"If that blue dragon dared to come for revenge, so be it, I’m tired of raising white dragon pets, time for a blue dragon dog!\"\nThe voice boomed like thunder, reverberating through the air.\nAlbuda swung his Bone Hammer twice, his voice filled with haughty disdain.",

      "content": "Chapter 372: Chapter 43: Fierce Battle (First Update)\nAlbuda naturally has his reasons for pride.\nThe Frost Giants, although not blessed with the Legendary Bloodline of the Dragon Race, are still considered one of the top Extraordinary Bloodlines.\nEspecially in the growth of young Frost Giants, it is filled with coldness and cruelty.\nFrom the moment they are born, after their first feeding, Frost Giant infants are thrown outside to face the natural baptism of the glacial winds.\nTheir parents remain indifferent to the cries of the babies.\nOnly those who survive until the next day qualify to live within the tribe.\nThis cruel selection among the Frost Giant tribe, even though they have a natural high resistance to ice and snow, still results in a high mortality rate among newborn Frost Giant infants under such brutal natural selection, with only one out of five surviving.\nSuch a harsh selection process is due to both tradition and the scarcity of food on the Glacial Plateau, forcing the Frost Giants to act this way.\nThrough this fierce survival of the fittest, the surviving Frost Giant infants are the most gifted and will grow to become the strongest warriors.\nHowever, passing the first hurdle of birth does not guarantee a stable life going forward.\nThe growth of the Frost Giants is filled with bloodshed and battles, from childhood to maturity.\nIn childhood, they learn combat techniques under the supervision of their parents, sparring with peers of the same age.\nIn their youth, they must venture into the depths of the ice fields alone.\nThey must battle against nature, hunting a powerful Magic Beast as their coming of age ceremony.\nHaving endured such cruel experiences, countless strong individuals and numerous legends emerge within the Frost Giant tribe.\nThough not like the Dragon Race, who become legendary upon reaching adulthood,\nThe battle prowess of the battle-hardened Frost Giants is terrifying!\nHow could the Dragon Race, who rely on their bloodline to automatically ascend to legendary status without much fierce combat, compete with them?\nMany years ago, the Glacial Plateau spanning thousands of miles to the north was originally a gathering place for a group of White Dragons.\nBut now, the Frost Giants have become the rulers of these lands.\nIt was the King of Frost Giants, once living in the barren icy corners, who led the tribe to seize survival space on the highland glaciers, pushing the scattered White Dragons into retreat.\nSome newly born White Dragon hatchlings were captured and tamed, becoming pets like dogs.\nThe Dragon Race is proud.\nEven among their kin, they do not compromise on this pride.\nThis pride makes them solitary creatures, only coming together for mating and nurturing offspring, or with the establishment of a family system by an Ancient Dragon—otherwise, herds of Giant Dragon Species are unseen.\nMost Dragon Race members prefer solitude.\nThis habit disperses their strength, making it difficult to consolidate.\nIn reality, if the White Dragons on the Glacial Plateau were to unite, they wouldn’t be oppressed by the Frost Giants. A cohesive tribe wouldn’t be driven into the corners after years of war.\nBut alas, such is the nature of dragons.\nEven if White Dragon hatchlings are enslaved by Frost Giants, unless faced by extreme racial purists, no dragon seeks trouble from these Frost Giants unless they are kin.\nMoreover, the power of the Frost Giants isn’t weak.\nThus, despite the Dragon Race having one of the top-tier bloodlines in the Prime Material Plane, they remain suppressed on the Glacial Plateau, consistently retreating during conflicts and wars.\nFor centuries, the Frost Giants have maintained an upper hand over the White Dragons due to their numbers and formidable combat power.\nAlbuda’s tribe has also been summoned by the King of Frost Giants to deal with White Dragons.\nThey hold little awe for the Dragon Race, emboldened by centuries of victories.\nWhat is there to fear from a single Blue Dragon!\n...\nAt this moment, outside the stronghold.\n\"Charge! Crush them! Seize all their food!\"\nThe Frost Giants shouted loudly. Their footsteps created thunderous sounds, causing the earth to tremble as if mountains and seas were collapsing.\nHeavy crossbow arrows shot out from the corners of the city walls, each penetrating the Frost Giant’s skin, spraying blood.\nThese heavy crossbows, redesigned by the goblins in the manufacturing workshop and infused with enchantment techniques from the Elf Kingdom, possessed demon-breaking capabilities.\nPreviously, these heavy crossbows were used to aid in hunting Giant Beasts and for defense around the city’s stronghold.\nThough now, the raiding Frost Giants felt the power of these heavy crossbows.\n\"Damn it! Destroy those heavy crossbows!\"\nA giant roared, their voice shaking the heavens.\nThe Frost Giants, towering at least twenty or thirty meters high like buildings.\nThe penetrative force of the demon-breaking heavy crossbows is strong; unless they strike the head, such injuries aren’t fatal enough for them.\nBut the pain is inevitable.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nA giant roared, casually uprooting a boulder several meters long from the ground, and hurled it toward the heavy crossbows on the stronghold defenses.\nBang!\nA section of the simple defensive wall collapsed, and the heavy crossbow atop it was completely destroyed.\n\"Ura! Ura!\"\nThe Frost Giants roared, their morale soaring.\n\"All officers, take note, our enemies are not those brainless Giant Beasts! Have the army hold them off; Junior Officers and Officers, unleash your full power, kill them!\"\nWith one heavy crossbow destroyed, Gory looked grim.\nThe stronghold defense had prepared a total of ten heavy crossbows, and now with one destroyed, only nine remained.\nThe resources required for each heavy crossbow are immense.\nThe losses were heavy.\nThankfully, aside from one Frost Giant finding a boulder, there were no more throwable objects.\nBraving the powerful penetrative force, the Frost Giants charged forward.\nLike an avalanched flood, they neared the stronghold.\n\"Charge! For the great His Highness Austin!\"\nThe Dragon Nest Legion charged out.\nA brutal melee ensued instantly.\nThe Frost Giants wielded massive weapons, crushing a row of Dragon Nest soldiers into pulp with each hit.\nEven though the Beastman soldiers wore Fine Steel Armor, under this terrifying power, it provided no defense, being crushed into a lump of metal along with their flesh.\nThe ferocious battles turned rivers into blood.\nYet the sacrifice of the melee soldiers wasn’t in vain. Within the stronghold, arrows rained down on the Frost Giants like a storm.\nMeanwhile, as the Frost Giants swung their weapons, drained of old strength and lacking new, a group of Beastman Officers leapt into the air. White Fighting Qi flickered with sharp light on their weapons, suspended above, flashing around the Frost Giants.",

Crush them!\"\nThe Frost Giants go into a frenzy.\nIn just one encounter, their comrades are more than half damaged, and the sight of the injured comrades is horrifying.\nDespite everything, there are Frost Giants who step forward, directly advancing towards the stronghold.\nStepping over the Dragon Nest Legion below, their immense power shakes the void, exploding the wall with a resounding crash.\nOne after another, Frost Giants rush into the stronghold with just a few strides, causing massive destruction.\nHouses collapse, and flames ignite from unknown origins, beginning to spread in all directions.\n\"Damn it!\"\nSeeing those few Frost Giants rush into the stronghold wreaking havoc, Gory, the highest-ranking officer in charge of the Seventh Stronghold, gazes with bloodshot eyes.\nHowever, the pressure on the battlefield intensifies with the Frost Giants’ rampage, making it impossible to offer support.\nIn their fury, the Frost Giants’ destructive power escalates to another level.\nWithin a radius of several miles, one can’t see an intact piece of ground, the surrounding cracks spreading widely, and the earth pockmarked, caving in.\nThe Dragon Nest Legion, amidst this ground-shaking upheaval, struggles to maintain formation.\nDust rises to the sky, shaking to the heavens, staining half the sky with ochre.\nGory grips the Great Sword, flashing swiftly and rotating through the air, deftly cleaving another careless Frost Giant with his formidable Great Sword.\nHe strikes once again, slashing down another!\nYet, surrounding him, the Frost Giants remain plentiful.\nGory is about to move out, to hunt those inattentive Frost Giants on the battlefield.\nAt that moment, a huge shadow suddenly envelops him, powerful oppressive force rolls in like a tsunami, as if the entire sky behind him has collapsed!\n\"Damn insect, daring to kill my subordinates, you’re courting death!\"\nBOOM!\nA mighty sound like thunder rumbles through the void, the sound waves turning into a tangible storm sweeping through the air.\nGory, under the impact of this terrifying aura, stumbles, nearly tumbling off the Frost Giant’s corpse.\n\"What!\"\nLooking up, he sees a giant twice the size of an ordinary Frost Giant appearing in front of him, its massive body blocking the high sky, casting a dark abyssal shadow over everything.\n\"Die for me!\"\nA gigantic bone club swings down from the high sky, azure light gleaming, nearly illuminating half the sky.\n\"No way!!!\"\nVast ice attribute magic power condenses on the bone club, the surrounding air seemingly about to freeze.\nGory can clearly sense that once this tremendous power erupts, it will affect the surrounding environment!\nNo time to think, Gory instantly flashes away.\nBOOM!!!\nThe bone club, as massive as a hill, crashes down from the sky, azure light blossoms high above like a vast sea tide, enveloping the void.\nAt that moment, Gory, still horizontally sweeping through the air, feels as if time itself is frozen by the extreme cold, thoughts stagnating.\nCRASH!\nAmidst clear, resonant clashes, ice crystals spread across the ground, alongside bursts of azure light, sweeping out in all directions.\nThe frost current rushes forth, and even the Dragon Nest Beastmen Soldiers are affected by the unbearable cold.\nYet this frost current sweeping through the entire encampment barely affects the Frost Giants on the battlefield!\nIt’s a nightmare!\n\"My tribesmen!

this Barbaric Land, willing to fight alongside the Dragon Nest Tribe, rather than returning to the Human World?\nWas it for status, power?\nNo, in this deserted Barbaric Land where even humans are scarce, the so-called lofty power, leading a group of Beastmen, becoming a Commander among them, is a joke.\nNobility, power, status, honor... these things only hold meaning in front of one’s kin, only in the Central Earth Human World.\nEven if he commanded an army of Beastmen, what difference was it from claiming kingship before monkeys?\nAll along, Gory was self-hypnotizing.\nIf he returned to the Human World, he would lose everything he currently possessed, continuing his life as a drifting Mercenary.\nEven if he relied on extraordinary strength, fortunately achieving merit on the battlefield, and was luckily noticed by a higher-level noble, if his merits were not completely stripped away, he might retain a small part to become a petty noble in a remote area, ultimately establishing a family lineage using the secret techniques learned from the Dragon Nest Tribe.\nCompared to now, with authority in hand and a position of leading an army, he didn’t want to go back to that life of harsh struggle with an unknown future.\nHe believed that was what he truly wanted, so he stayed with the Dragon Nest Tribe, not seeking an opportunity to escape, but striving for the growth and development of the tribe.\nYet at this moment, as life was reaching its end.\nGory finally saw through all appearances and saw his true heart.\nBecause of fairness and equality!\nWithin the Dragon Nest Tribe, he experienced a fairness and equality of personhood that he had never felt before, which did not exist in the continent’s mainstream!\n...\nAs a child, in tattered clothes, Gory knelt by the roadside, his head pressed into the dirt, waiting respectfully as the high and mighty noble was escorted by servants and passed through the center of the road with his grand horse-drawn carriage.\nIt was then that a seed was planted in his heart.\nLater, he learned the Breathing Technique from a retired old man in the village, and during conversations, learned that the old man had once been a minor civilian officer in a Duchy, who had made significant contributions in war.\nBut eventually, because he was a civilian without any backing, his merits were directly stolen by a noble officer, and he was instead accused of greedily seeking personal glory, stripped of his officer position, and demoted to an ordinary soldier.\nFurious, the old man left the army, later becoming a Mercenary to make a living, and finally retiring to his hometown to live out his final years.\nAt that time, young Gory once again felt that suffocating power on his shoulders.\nUnknowingly, the seed planted within him began to sprout.\nLater on,\nGory accepted the old man’s letter of recommendation and went to the city to make a living, becoming a Mercenary himself.\nDuring his mercenary career, his horizons broadened, and he saw more of the world.\nA noble youth, on a bad day, galloping horse down the street, accidentally killing a child on the roadside.\nAn old farmer, who worked diligently all his life but, in the end, lost everything because he could not pay taxes, forced to beg at the street corner.\nA former mercenary companion, fortunate enough to be recruited as a servant by a noble lord, yet beaten to death with clubs as the family pillar because the young master accidentally injured his hand during play.\nFrom childhood to adulthood, all these experiences gave Gory an innate ambition.\nHe wanted to become a noble, to be part of the ruling class, to be above the common people!\nBut this path was too difficult.\nSo, when Gory was captured by the Dragon Nest Tribe, when he saw the powerful secret techniques within the tribe, he was willing to stay, hoping to acquire those powerful secret techniques as a stepping stone to becoming a noble in the future.\nHowever, amidst his constant efforts and struggles.\nSome things had unknowingly begun to impact Gory’s heart.\nDifferent Beastmen might have different talents.\nWithin the Dragon Nest Tribe, Beastmen also respected the strong.\nBut within this tribe, each Beastman was equal in terms of personhood!\nNo one would oppress you because you were born a Goblin, nor would anyone allow you to kill others with impunity because you were a Black Bear person of strong lineage.\nYour achievements, no matter how humble your origins, would be recognized and praised by all.\nYour mistakes, even if you were one of the founders, would be met with the same punishment.\nIn the Dragon Nest Tribe, Beastmen might differ in talent, strength, and position, but every Beastman living in this tribe was equal in terms of personhood!\n\"So, this is my true heart, unknowingly, I have completely integrated and identified with the Dragon Nest Tribe....\"\nOnly those who have experienced hunger understand the importance of being well-fed.\nOnly a beast bound by chains knows the value of freedom.\nAnd only someone who grew up in a world of \"born inequality\", constantly seeing nobles and privileged classes above the commoners, in a world full of cruelty and oppression,\nUpon first encountering that deep-rooted fairness and equality would have Gory’s heart and soul completely captured, making him genuinely stay in the Dragon Nest Tribe, dedicating all his strength to its rise.\nAustin would never have thought that some unconscious concepts cultivated during his previous life in a civilized modern world would have such a profound impact on Gory.\nTo him, fairness and equality.\nIn the training reconstruction before the Beastmen integrated into the Dragon Nest Tribe, these were concepts never deliberately nurtured, yet they were constantly penetrating into their daily training, deeply rooted in aspects of everyday life among the Beastmen of the Dragon’s Nest Tribe.\nIn Austin’s view, officers and soldiers eating and living together, clear rewards and punishments in the military, were very commonplace.\nYet, these modern thoughts unconsciously implemented throughout the tribe provided Gory with a world-shaking shock,\nAlso making Gory genuinely recognize the Dragon Nest Tribe he fought for.\nThese things, invisible even to Austin, inadvertently changed Gory’s entire life.\n\"I truly hope that one day the Dragon Nest flag could be planted in my homeland... Your Highness, I won’t be able to help you... achieve the grand mission...\"\nIn a blur, time seemed to slow down.\nGory seemed to see that enormous Blue Dragon flag flying high in the sky.\nUnder that enormous flag, countless people gathered like a sea, wearing heartfelt smiles of happiness.\nCovered in ice, Gory closed his eyes.\nAccompanied by the roar of the Frost Giant leader Albuda, the massive Bone Hammer came crashing down!\nAt that moment,\nWhoosh!\nA circle of thunder suddenly appeared in the void behind the Frost Giant leader Albuda,\nInitially the size of a basketball, it suddenly expanded and spread out in all directions with force.\nA radiant brilliance rippled, a thunder-surrounded claw, as if probing from the Alternate Void, came crashing down from above!\n\"You speak well, dare an ant punch at a Sky Dragon? But who gave you the courage to provoke me?!\"\nAccompanied by a thunderous roar that echoed across the heavens, that sky-covering dragon claw seemed to come crossing realms from the Alternate Void and, while Albuda was caught off guard, grabbed his head and smashed it to the ground like a meteor!",

except for their leader Albuda, the attacking Frost Giants were completely annihilated!\nThis is one of the results of Austin’s two-year seclusion.\nAbsorbing all the essence of knowledge from the Martial Hero World, and undergoing certain imitation improvements to the system of this world, resulted in the extraordinarily powerful improved version of the Four Spirits Sword Array!\nThe invading Frost Giants, relying on their formidable Extraordinary Bloodline, had a cultivation level of at least Gold Level or above.\nAdd to that their massive size, a group of dozens, would gang up and kill even a Legendary Level giant dragon.\nBut at this moment, in front of Austin’s Four Spirits Sword Array, they were slain in a fleeting moment.\nThis does not mean that Austin’s power has surpassed the Legendary.\nInstead, the improved version of the Four Spirits Sword Array, plus two years of accumulated power, has an almost massacre-like overwhelming effect against enemies with lower strength.\nThis is but one of the powers of the improved Four Spirits Sword Array!\nAt this moment, the Frost Giant leader, pinned under Austin’s feet, had just woken up from his stupor.\nHe witnessed the massacre of his tribe.\n\"Roar!!!\"\nHis eyes bulged, bloodshot with rage, his mighty roar erupted with an unstoppable force like a mountainous avalanche.\nThe power unleashed in that instant, even Austin’s real body could not withstand!\nThe Frost Giant leader Albuda stood up like an ancient titan, roaring towards the sky, his deafening voice filled with blood-curdling despair.\n\"Damn reptile! You are courting death!!!\"\nThe prime fighters of the tribe, utterly exterminated here.\nThis signifies that their tribe is about to vanish completely on the Glacial Plateau!\nThis is a mortal feud, a genocidal vendetta.\nNo one knows if there is regret in Albuda’s heart at this moment, but what fills his heart now is boundless killing intent!\nAn ice-blue halo bloomed, as if dragging the entire world into winter, shimmering ice spikes spread across the ground, extending in all directions, seemingly freezing and covering the whole world.\n\"Damn lizard! Die for me!\"\nAccompanied by an earth-shaking roar, the enormous bone hammer in hand shimmered with icy blue light, descending towards Austin like a hill.\nPower surged like mountains overturning, stirring the void like raging torrents.\nAustin sneered, spread his wings, and his giant figure soared into the sky.\nIn all directions of the sky, the phantoms of the Cyan Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise flashed and vanished, converging into heavenly light that connected heaven and earth, the four streams of light coalesced together.\nMerging in the void, transforming into a world-splitting Sword Momentum, suspended beyond the heavens, crashing down on Albuda like a meteor from the sky!",

Crack!\nWith the crisp sound of breaking, visible cracks suddenly surfaced on the massive bone hammer.\nIn Albuda’s horrified gaze, the cracks, like a spider web, quickly spread across the bone hammer made from the bones of an unknown magic beast, covering the entire hammer in mere moments!\n\"No!!!\"\nOnly managing to leave behind his final words, the vast radiance pierced through the sky, shattering his weapon into countless fragments with unmatched might, fully engulfing the Frost Giant leader Albuda.\nBOOM RUMBLE!!!\nThe terrifying explosion rippled, the momentum shaking the sky, as if the entire world was about to collapse and be annihilated by this sweeping tidal force!\nThe terrifying aftershocks lasted for quite some time, with the sword array space created by the Four Spirits Sword Array seeming to be cleaved apart, everything only returning to normal after some time.\nAs the power dissipated, Austin retracted the four subtly manifesting Law Divine Swords into his body.\nWith a shimmering brilliance, the Four Spirits Sword Array space disbanded, and the dust and smoke in the world scattered away with the gentle breeze.\nEven with the spatial cutting and sealing, the aftershocks at most did not extend beyond the surroundings, yet in the center of the battlefield, the layers of earth were completely smashed and collapsed.\nA massive crater stood silently, with soil and ground collapsing in a radius of several hundred meters, and the edges of the crater stretching out like canyons.\nThis is the true power possessed by the Four Spirits Sword Array!\nBefore traversing the Martial Hero World, the Four Spirits Sword Array created by Austin was merely a simple application of the Law Power echoing among themselves, like primitive people picking up simple stone tools from the ground as instruments.\nHowever, after experiencing decades in the Martial Hero World, Austin established the Mystical Fantasy Xianxia Dao, gaining an extremely profound understanding of arrays.\nParticularly when, on that occasion, to upgrade the world, they directly used the landscape and earth veins as array materials, swallowing the vast energy in the starry sky to transform and enhance the world’s Primordial Qi concentration, achieving the world upgrade result.\nSuch earth-shattering means demonstrate the depth of understanding Austin has achieved in the art of arrays.\nDespite returning to the Main World, due to world laws, many aspects cannot be used.\nHowever, whether it’s Magic Power or Primordial Power, their relationship is comparable to the relationship between Spiritual Power and Divine Sense.\nEven if the system’s powers are different, they are common in certain directions.\nAfter two years of seclusion, Austin has successfully absorbed all the gains from the Martial Hero World, completing the transformation of the relationship between the two.\nAnd the Four Spirits Sword Array also received a fundamental enhancement.\nNow, under the improved version of the Four Spirits Sword Array, its power is so immense that with just a flick of a hand, it can annihilate an entire Frost Giant clan, and even slay a Frost Giant leader at the peak of Half-Legendary in a single strike.\nThe Frost Giant clan that attacked this time possessed enough power to besiege a mature White Dragon.\nYet under the Four Spirits Sword Array, they still turned to ash with ease.\nThis powerful means are something Austin could not have achieved before he modified the Four Spirits Sword Array after traversing the Martial Hero World.\nGazing at the devastated scene ahead, the remaining Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers stood dumbfounded, staring blankly at everything before them.\nThis overwhelming power, even an army of over ten thousand would be of no use!\nAccording to legends, once one crosses the Legendary Boundary, they rise high above the clouds, soaring above the mundane world!\nNow it seems, even if there is a gap, it is not far off.\n\"This is the power of Law; could it be that His Highness has already advanced to Legendary...\"\nGory gazed at the enormous figure, his expression dazed.\nWhether it was due to being frightened from narrowly escaping death or being shocked by Austin’s incomparably powerful force, he wouldn’t know.\n\"His Highness Austin is indeed a dragon capable of accomplishing great undertakings.\"\nBack when mercenaries attacked the Dragon Nest Tribe, they saw the dangers the Dragon Nest Tribe posed.\nAt that time, Austin’s level cultivation was only around gold.\nWho could have thought that in just a few short years, he would reach such heights!\nThis is simply an anomaly.\nNot to mention the Dragon Race; even from the perspective of short-lived humans, this level of progress is considered incredible.\n\"You’re called Gory, right? Faced with enemies far stronger than yourselves, your performance was commendable. Clean up the battlefield, relay the message back to the tribe, gather support and endurance, properly bury fallen comrades, and finally gather all operable soldiers. Dare to destroy my tribe, I shall give them a profound lesson!\"\nJust as Gory was in a daze, a powerful voice sounded like thunder in his ears.\nGory immediately stood upright, saluting.\n\"Yes, Your Highness!\"\nThen, Gory turned away, starting to direct the remaining Beastman soldiers in cleaning up the devastating battlefield.\nGiven the degree of damage to the base, it looks like it will take at least half a year to rebuild.\nWatching Gory depart, directing the Beastman soldiers to clean up the remnants of the battlefield,\nAustin turned around, flew down, and landed in the center of the crater.\nAt the center, a band of azure ice was gently swirling, emanating a cold blue light...",

      "content": "Chapter 378: Chapter 049: Assault into the Den\nCrystal clear, the azure ice band congealed from ice shards slowly rotates in the void.\nIts lush greenness makes one feel as if they are beholding the most beautiful thing in the world.\nHowever, if one assumes it’s harmless just because it’s beautiful, they would be gravely mistaken.\nRipples, visible to the naked eye, waver in the void.\nThese faint yet visible shock waves are signs that the surrounding space is also congealing.\nFrost Law Origin!\nNot just a trace, but over eighty percent of the Frost Law Origin.\nThe Frost Giant leader’s level cultivation was already at the pinnacle of legendary, with only a slight distance from the gates of being legendary.\nIt is for this reason that the Frost Law Origin comprehended by Albuda has reached over eighty percent.\nIf it were any other half-legendary powerhouse, after killing their opponent, the law origin left behind would usually dissipate into the world unless captured by special means or containers.\nBut Austin is different; he can not only devour the exposed law directly but also refine it for his own use.\nHis enormous body lightly lands in the center of the crater, without stirring much wind.\nFacing the Frost Law Origin hovering before him.\nHe swallowed it in one gulp.\nCrunch crunch...\nLike a cold front freezing over, visible ice blocks spread across his body, enveloping most of Austin.\nIn that instant, Austin felt as though his mouth and tongue were numb, frozen without any sensation.\nHowever, he didn’t mind.\nWithin his body, Magic Power circulated.\nUnder the massive refining of Magic Power, the Frost Law Origin slowly integrated into his body.\nAbout half an hour later, there were basically no more issues.\nTo fully refine it would take some time, but as of now, it wouldn’t affect any of Austin’s actions.\nAnother law power added to his arsenal.\nAlthough it didn’t seem particularly useful at the moment, having it was better than not.\nThinking about it.\nThe initially refined frost law was activated, a cold current spewing from his mouth, glowing with an azure hue, the air seemingly frozen and solidified.\nSplash!\nAmidst the crisp, clear sound, the ground ahead was covered with a layer of white frost under the spew of the cold current, spreading across a hundred-meter range, ice blocks forming and turning that fan-shaped area into solid permafrost.\nLooking at the frost-frozen ground ahead, Austin felt reasonably satisfied.\nThough, for now, he couldn’t think of its method of attack.\nBut regardless, being able to wield an additional law origin is always good.\nAt least, in the hot and humid Kawa Great Forest, sometimes when it’s too hot, it can serve as an air conditioner to cool down his lair.\nWhile Austin was digesting the Frost Law, Gory, along with the remaining beastmen soldiers, had almost cleared up the battlefield.\nThe injured comrades were rescued first, and a space not yet destroyed was cleared, serving as a simple infirmary for basic care.\nThen came the countless corpses on the battlefield.\nDue to the colossal size and immense power of the Frost Giant, many soldiers were utterly defenseless, their armor smashed flat, let alone their fleshy bodies.\nThe casualties were heavy.\nAs they cleaned up the battlefield, there was an air of heaviness among the beastman soldiers.\nDue to Austin’s influence, the Dragon’s Nest Army bore traces of his previous life’s military.\nUnity, cooperation, and a deep bond among comrades,\nThe camaraderie among Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers was unmatched by any army of this era.\nEven Austin could feel the profound sadness among them.\nThe unexpected joy of obtaining a trace of Frost Law Origin vanished without a trace.\nIn a heavyhearted mood, they cleared the bodies, and under Austin’s supervision, they conducted a solemn burial for the deceased soldiers.\nAfter that, the revenge began.\nThough the invading frost giants had been slain by Austin, the hatred could not simply disappear.\nThe invading frost giants, regardless of gender, were all main forces of adulthood.\nThis indicated that remnants of this tribe still existed on the Glacial Plateau.\nThis attack led to the near-collapse of the seventh stronghold, with over half of ten thousand Dragon Nest Beastmen lost—you can’t just let it slide without retaliation!\nMoreover, for the seventh stronghold to establish itself, frost giants nearby couldn’t be allowed to take root again.\nThus, after the burial and a brief night’s rest,\nAustin led the remaining forces straight to the Glacial Plateau!\nThe thin oxygen on the Glacial Plateau, the biting cold wind, could not halt the steps of vengeance.\nFinally, after half a day’s search, the Beastman Officer under his command found the Frost Giant Tribe located under the Glacier Mountain.\nWithout any hesitation, Austin led the Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers to assault the Frost Giant Tribe.\nIt’s clear that during the attack on the seventh stronghold, this Frost Giant Tribe had gone all out, with all the young and strong buried under Austin’s Four Spirits Sword Array.\nAll that was left were a group of frost giant cubs, some middle-aged frost giant women tending the children, and an injured young frost giant.\nBesides that, there were a few young white dragons, minds wiped by unknown means by the frost giants, losing their stature and greatly weakened, reduced to near beasts.\nAs well as some clans living nearby subdued by the frost giants: snow wolves and ice wolves.\nThis bit of strength was nowhere near enough in Austin’s eyes.\nFor this reason, this ambush came without any unexpected setbacks.\nUnder Austin’s formidable power, the remaining scant resistance of the Frost Giant Tribe was directly suppressed.\nAfter Austin annihilated the resisting young frost giants with thunderous might, the remaining frost giants, and those captive clans and white dragons, were taken prisoner without resistance, their expressions filled with immense terror.\nDuring this period, it wasn’t without defiant frost giant cubs, but after Austin executed the two most unruly ones with swift ferocity, the rest completely surrendered.\nThis group of surrendered elders and children—they wouldn’t be killed for now.\nBut they also wouldn’t be entirely forgiven.\nAs relatives of those who attacked the stronghold, their future lies in offering their strength under the Dragon Nest Tribe’s oppression, repaying their family’s crimes in full before earning the right to freedom.\nUnder the hateful gazes of the Dragon Nest Beastmen soldiers, these elder and young frost giants, with their hands and heads tied to ropes, were strung together and began their journey down the mountain.\nThe young white dragons, stripped of their intelligence and reduced to beasts, along with the reliance clans, were also captured, following behind.\nAs the captives departed,\nAustin ventured into the Frost Giant Tribe, searching for anything of value.",
